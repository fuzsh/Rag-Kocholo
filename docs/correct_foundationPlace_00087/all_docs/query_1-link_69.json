        "text": "About the course\n\nAre you a student from the UK interested in studying Chemistry, Engineering Science or Materials Science? Have your personal or educational circumstances meant you are unlikely to achieve the grades typically required for Oxford courses? If so, then choosing to apply for your course with a Foundation Year might be the right option for you.\n\nThe Astrophoria Foundation Year is free for students and is designed to be a one-year intensive academic course which will bridge any gaps between school and our academically challenging undergraduate courses.\n\nThe programme is carefully designed to build and develop your study skills, subject knowledge and academic confidence. Students that pass the course will be awarded a nationally recognised Certificate in Higher Education (CertHE) qualification.\n\nIf you pass the course at the required level, you will be automatically admitted into Oxford as an undergraduate student if you wish to be, without the need to re-apply.\n\nThe Foundation Year Chemistry, Engineering and Materials Science (CEMS) course is designed to give you a solid grounding in key areas, with particular focus on the assimilation of the underlying concepts in these topics so that they can be effectively applied to solve real-world problems.\n\nYou will follow a subject specific pathway taking modules relevant to the subject you aim to study at undergraduate level, alongside essential maths modules. You will develop subject specific problem-solving skills and undertake an independent mini project.\n\nAlongside your academic subject programme, you will take the Preparation for Undergraduate Studies course. This will help you develop the core skills that will enable you to thrive on a course at undergraduate level, whether at Oxford or another university.\n\nThese modules will provide support in building general academic skills including:\n\nacademic writing\n\ncommunication skills to support verbal discussion\n\nbroader personal development through a society and culture course and academic mentoring.\n\nVisit the Astrophoria Foundation Year website for further insights into this course and the programme.\n\nVisit the undergraduate course pages for Chemistry, Engineering or Materials Science to find out more about the undergraduate course you'll study after your foundation year.\n\nA typical week\n\nDuring your foundation year you will be expected to attend around five hours of lectures and classes per unit per week, participate in regular meetings with tutors to discuss work, carry out independent research and participate in laboratory work. All CEMS students follow two or three units per week.\n\nYour time will be spent both on academic work for your CEMS programme and work related to the Preparation for Undergraduate Studies course.\n\nIn each term you will study modules which will lead to your degree pathway. In your final term you will complete a written project on a subject related topic of your choice, deepening your subject interest and building your skills in independent study.\n\nTutorials are usually for around two students and a tutor. Classes and laboratory sessions are slightly bigger, they may vary depending on the modules that you choose. There are likely to be around four students in a class or laboratory session, however when the whole CEMS cohort is together, this may include up to 12 students.\n\nLectures are a larger format again, and are likely to be delivered to the foundation year cohort (up to 50 students) as a whole.\n\nMost tutorials, classes, and lectures are delivered by staff who are tutors in their subject. Some teaching may also be delivered by postgraduate students.\n\nTo find out more about how Oxford's teaching year is structured, visit our Academic Year page.\n\nCourse structure\n\nTerm 1\n\nCourses\n\nAssessment\n\nCourses depend on your chosen degree:\n\nChemistry\n\nIntroduction for practical based science: measurement and error analysis\n\nMaths for physical sciences 1\n\nInorganic chemistry\n\nPhysical chemistry 1\n\nEngineering Science\n\nIntroduction for practical based science: measurement and error analysis\n\nMaths for physical sciences 1\n\nPhysics, mechanics and optics\n\nPhysics, mechanics in rotation\n\nMaterials Science\n\nIntroduction for practical based science: measurement and error analysis\n\nMaths for physical sciences 1\n\nPhysics, mechanics and optics\n\nPhysical Chemistry 1\n\nAll students\n\nPreparation for Undergraduate Studies (including General Academic Skills, Communication Skills, Society and Culture)\n\nExaminations: Written papers\n\nTerm 2\n\nCourses\n\nAssessment\n\nCourses depend on your chosen degree:\n\nChemistry\n\nMaths for physical sciences 2\n\nOrganic chemistry\n\nPhysical chemistry 2\n\nEngineering Science\n\nMaths for physical sciences 2\n\nPhysics, magnetism, electricity with DC circuits and waves\n\nPhysics, electricity with AC circuits and thermodynamics\n\nMaterials Science\n\nMaths for physical sciences 2\n\nPhysics, magnetism, electricity with DC circuits and waves\n\nPhysical Chemistry 2\n\nAll students\n\nPreparation for Undergraduate Studies (including General Academic Skills, Communication Skills, Society and Culture)\n\nExamination: Written papers\n\nTerm 3\n\nAcademic requirements\n\nQualification\n\nRequirement\n\nA-levels:\n\nAAB\n\nAdvanced Highers:\n\nBB/BBC\n\nInternational Baccalaureate (IB):\n\n37 (including core points) with 665 at Higher Level, with at least a 6 at Higher Level in the most relevant subject(s) to chosen course.\n\nBTECs:\n\nBTEC Level 3 National Extended Diploma: DDM\n\nBTEC Level 3 National Diploma: DD plus A at A level.\n\nBTEC Level 3 National Subsidiary Diploma: D plus AB at A level.\n\nAccess to HE Diploma:\n\nCompletion of Access to HE Diploma with all the level 3 credits taken at Merit, and A grades in any A levels taken.\n\nAny other equivalent qualification:\n\nView information on other UK qualifications, and international qualifications.\n\nWherever possible, your grades are considered in the context in which they have been achieved.\n\nRead further information on how we use contextual data.\n\nIf you meet the eligibility requirements for the Astrophoria Foundation Year, you may wish to apply for a foundation year course when the grades you are likely to achieve fall below the academic entry requirements for your chosen undergraduate course but they meet or exceed the academic entry requirements for your chosen foundation year course.\n\nSubject requirements\n\nSubject requirements depend on the undergraduate degree course you wish to study.\n\nEssential:\n\nChemistry\n\nCandidates are expected to have Chemistry and Mathematics to A-level, Advanced Higher, Higher level in the IB or any other equivalent.

But there is so much more to an Oxford degree that the numbers can’t convey.\n\nThe Oxford tutorial\n\nCollege tutorials are central to teaching at Oxford. Typically, they take place in your college and are led by your academic tutor(s) who teach as well as do their own research. Students will also receive teaching in a variety of other ways, depending on the course. This will include lectures and classes, and may include laboratory work and fieldwork. However, tutorials offer a level of personalised attention from academic experts unavailable at most universities.\n\nDuring tutorials (normally lasting an hour), college subject tutors will give you and one or two tutorial partners feedback on prepared work and cover a topic in depth. The other student(s) in your college tutorials will be from your year group, doing the same course as you and will normally be at your college. Such regular and rigorous academic discussion develops and facilitates learning in a way that isn’t possible through lectures alone.\n\nTutorials also allow for close progress monitoring so tutors can quickly provide additional support if necessary.\n\nRead more about tutorials and an Oxford education\n\nCollege life\n\nOur colleges are at the heart of Oxford’s reputation as one of the best universities in the world.\n\nAt Oxford, everyone is a member of a college as well as their subject department(s) and the University. Students therefore have both the benefits of belonging to a large, renowned institution and to a small and friendly academic community. Each college or hall is made up of academic and support staff, and students. Colleges provide a safe, supportive environment leaving you free to focus on your studies, enjoy time with friends and make the most of the huge variety of opportunities.\n\nEach college has a unique character, but generally their facilities are similar. Each one, large or small, will have the following essential facilities:\n\nPorters’ lodge (a staffed entrance and reception)\n\nDining hall\n\nLending library (often open 24/7 in term time)\n\nStudent accommodation\n\nTutors’ teaching rooms\n\nChapel and/or music rooms\n\nLaundry\n\nGreen spaces\n\nCommon room (known as the JCR).\n\nAll foundation year and first year students are offered college accommodation either on the main site of their college or in a nearby college annexe. This means that your neighbours will also be ‘freshers’ and new to life at Oxford. This accommodation is guaranteed, so you don’t need to worry about finding somewhere to live after accepting a place here, all of this is organised for you before you arrive.\n\nAll colleges offer at least one further year of accommodation and some offer it for the entire duration of your degree. You may choose to take up the option to live in your college for the whole of your time at Oxford, or you might decide to arrange your own accommodation after your first year – perhaps because you want to live with friends from other colleges.\n\nWhile college academic tutors primarily support your academic development, you can also ask their advice on other things. Lots of other college staff including welfare officers help students settle in and are available to offer guidance on practical or health matters. Current students also actively support students in earlier years, sometimes as part of a college ‘family’ or as peer supporters trained by the University’s Counselling Service.\n\nAstrophoria Foundation Year students are currently allocated to a college. They do not apply for a specific one."
