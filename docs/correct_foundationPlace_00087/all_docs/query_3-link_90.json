        "text": "What are NSAIDs?\n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, also known as NSAIDs are medicines that are used to relieve pain, and reduce swelling (inflammation).\n\nExamples include aspirin, naproxen, ibuprofen, diclofenac, and COX-2 inhibitors such as celecoxib and meloxicam.\n\nIn Australia, you can obtain NSAIDs with a doctor’s prescription, and you can buy lower-dose forms over-the-counter in a pharmacy.\n\nWhat are NSAIDs used for?\n\nYou can use NSAIDs to relieve symptoms associated with a range of conditions, including:\n\npain (for example, headache, toothache, period cramps, muscle strains and sprains)\n\ninflammation\n\nfever\n\narthritis\n\nsome autoimmune conditions\n\nNSAIDs are widely available and you might have them in your home. You can find NSAIDs in tablets, capsules, creams, liquids, injections, sprays and suppositories.\n\nYou can check whether a medicine you’re taking is an NSAID, or contains an NSAID, on the healthdirect medicine page or the NPS MedicineWise website.\n\nWhat are NSAIDs side effects?\n\nCommon side effects that you may experience after taking NSAIDs include nausea, heartburn and indigestion. More serious but less common side effects include stomach bleeding or kidney problems. NSAIDs, including those bought over-the-counter, have also been linked to a small increase in the risk of stroke and heart attack.\n\nNSAIDs (including aspirin) can also trigger asthma in some people. If you have asthma and need an NSAID for pain relief, talk to your doctor first.\n\nIs it safe for me to take NSAIDs?\n\nDon’t take NSAIDs if you:\n\nare allergic or hypersensitive to them\n\nare pregnant or planning a pregnancy\n\nhave a kidney or liver condition\n\nhave a gastrointestinal (gut) ulcer or bleeding\n\nDon’t give aspirin to children aged under 12 years old unless advised by a doctor. In children, aspirin can cause a very rare condition known as Reye’s Syndrome, which can be life-threatening.\n\nWho is at risk of side effects?\n\nIn general, the risk of side effects can be minimised if you take NSAIDs:\n\noccasionally\n\nfor a limited time period\n\nat the lowest dose you need to control your pain, within the dose range recommended by your doctor or pharmacist\n\nThe risk of side effects increases if you:\n\nhave medical conditions such as gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), stomach ulcers, stomach bleeding, high blood pressure, heart problems, diabetes or a kidney or liver condition\n\nare older than 65, especially if you are frail, as NSAIDS may increase your risk of stroke\n\nare pregnant or planning a pregnancy\n\nare dehydrated, especially children, adolescents and older people\n\nare already taking another medicine that contains an NSAID\n\ndrink alcohol\n\ntake more than the recommended dose or take it for more than a few days at a time\n\nCertain medicines also increase your chance of experiencing side effects, including:\n\nmedicines for cardiovascular disease (including medicines for high blood pressure such as beta blockers, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs))\n\nblood thinners such as warfarin or new oral anticoagulants (also known as NOACs, including rivaroxaban, dabigatran and apixaban)\n\nthe osteoporosis treatment alendronate\n\nthe rheumatoid arthritis treatment methotrexate\n\nEven if these don’t apply to you, it’s important that you always follow the dosing instructions carefully. For children, you need to give the dose written on the bottle or packaging, according to your child’s weight.\n\nYou can minimise the changes of stomach upset by taking NSAIDs with food.\n\nThere are NSAIDs in many over-the-counter medicines, not just in pain medicines, so you need to read medication labels carefully. There are many brand names for the same medicine and many different types of NSAID available, so you need to take care to avoid an accidental overdose. If you’re unsure, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nYou may find NSAIDs in:\n\nmedications for colds and flu\n\narthritis creams\n\nteething gels\n\ncomplementary and alternative medicines such as:\n\nwillow tree bark extract\n\nherbal arthritis pills\n\nYou need to be careful not to overdose on NSAIDs by accident. For example if you have a cold, don’t take one NSAID for headache and another NSAID at the same time in a medicine for a stuffy nose. If you take an NSAID for a chronic (long-term) condition such as arthritis, ask your doctor or pharmacist before taking cold and flu medicines.\n\nStop taking NSAIDs and see your doctor if you notice anything wrong, especially any signs of stomach bleeding, such as:\n\nabdominal pain\n\nblood in your stool (poo), or very dark stool\n\ndark coffee-coloured vomit\n\nWhen should I talk to my doctor?\n\nTalk to your doctor if you have questions about the benefits and risks of NSAIDs. For many people, the health benefits of treatment outweigh the known risks.\n\nIf you are buying over-the-counter NSAIDs, talk to your pharmacist or your doctor.\n\nIf you buy NSAIDs over-the-counter, follow the instructions closely and do not exceed the recommended dose or duration of treatment.\n\nDo not give NSAIDs to your child for more than 48 hours without seeing a doctor."
