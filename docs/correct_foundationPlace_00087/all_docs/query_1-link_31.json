        "text": "Overview\n\nMost antibodies (also known as immunoglobulins) in the blood and the fluid that surround the tissues and cells of the body are of the IgG class. This class of antibodies is composed of four different subclasses: IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. Each subclass is present in different concentrations in the blood and those concentrations vary with age. The IgG in the bloodstream is 60-70% IgG1, 20-30% IgG2, 5-8% IgG3, and 1-3% IgG4. IgG1 and IgG3 reach normal adult levels by 5-7 years of age, while IgG2 and IgG4 levels rise more slowly, reaching adult levels at about ten years of age.\n\nEach subclass serves predominantly (but not exclusively) a slightly different function in protecting the body against infection. For example, IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses protect against toxins from bacteria such as diphtheria and tetanus, and against viral infections. In contrast, IgG2 predominantly protects against the polysaccharide (complex sugar) capsule of certain disease-causing bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae.\n\nIndividuals with IgG subclass deficiency are defined as having recurrent infections, persistently low levels of one or more IgG subclasses, and normal concentrations of total IgG, IgM, and IgA. IgG2 or IgG3 deficiencies are the most common IgG subclass deficiencies. Since IgG1 comprises 60% of the total IgG level, having a deficiency of IgG1 usually drops the total IgG level below the normal range, resulting in hypogammaglobulinemia.\n\nBecause IgG4 does not reach adult levels until the age of 10 years, a diagnosis of IgG4 deficiency should not be made in young children. In addition, it may also be undetectable in the serum of many healthy adult individuals, and therefore low IgG4 alone is insufficient evidence of an antibody deficiency disorder.\n\nAll individuals with IgG subclass deficiency require additional diagnostic evaluation. This evaluation must include the demonstration of a poor antibody response to vaccine challenge and careful documentation of recurrent infection. If both are present, the individual can be diagnosed with a clinically significant IgG subclass deficiency necessitating specific treatment.\n\nClinical presentation\n\nMost individuals with IgG subclass deficiency are completely asymptomatic. They may present, however, to a healthcare provider with recurrent ear and/or sinus infections; bronchitis and pneumonia may also have occurred. These infections are commonly caused by encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, infections common in other people with antibody deficiencies. These types of infections are seen most commonly among those with IgG2 deficiency, with or without IgG4 deficiency.\n\nInfections occurring in those with selective IgG subclass deficiency may not be as severe as infections in individuals with more significant antibody deficiencies, such as agammaglobulinemia or common variable immune deficiency (CVID). Individuals with IgG subclass deficiencies may have other types of invasive infections, such as episodes of bacterial meningitis or infections of the bloodstream (sepsis), but these are extraordinarily rare. Frequent viral infections have been associated with IgG3 subclass deficiencies.\n\nAs in people with selective IgA deficiency, allergic diseases, and autoimmune diseases are more common in those with IgG subclass deficiency.\n\nDiagnosing IgG subclass deficiency\n\nMeasurement of IgG subclass levels is not universally recommended as part of the evaluation of antibody-mediated immunity in individuals with recurrent or severe infections. Assessing IgG subclasses adds cost and may not add clinical value when total immunoglobulins and specific antibodies are measured. Most clinical immunologists do not obtain or measure IgG subclasses.\n\nWhen IgG subclasses are measured, all four should be measured at the same time. An abnormal level should be confirmed at least one month after the first measurement. It is important to consider that IgG subclasses vary over time and among different laboratories. In addition, normal range values are usually defined as those values found in 95% of healthy individuals of that personâ€™s age. This means that 2.5% of healthy individuals will be considered deficient, and 2.5% of normal individuals will have values above that range.\n\nMeasurement of IgG subclasses can be recommended in the presence of known associated disorders, particularly if recurrent infections are also present. These circumstances include individuals with:\n\nSelective IgA deficiency with recurrent infections to determine if there is an associated IgG2 and IgG4 subclass deficiency.\n\nWiskott-Aldrich syndrome or ataxia-telangiectasia at the onset of recurrent infections.\n\nSpecific antibody deficiency with normal total immunoglobulins.\n\nExpectations\n\nThe natural history of individuals with a clinically significant IgG subclass deficiency is not completely understood, but the outlook is generally good. Many children appear to outgrow their deficiency as they get older. For those with a persistent deficiency and impaired antibody responses, the use of prophylactic antibiotics and, in certain circumstances, the use of Ig replacement therapy may prevent serious infections and complications, such as impaired lung function, hearing loss, or injury to other organ systems.\n\nRecent studies have shown that many children with a subclass deficiency in early childhood (younger than 5 years of age) develop normal subclass levels and the ability to make antibodies to polysaccharide vaccines as they get older. IgG subclass deficiencies, however, may persist in some children and adults. In some instances, a selective IgG subclass deficiency may evolve into a more serious antibody deficiency, such as common variable immune deficiency (CVID). At this time, it is not possible to determine which individuals will have the transient type of subclass deficiency and which individuals may later evolve into a more significant immunodeficiency. For these reasons, regular reevaluation of immunoglobulin levels and function, as well as IgG subclass levels, is necessary."
