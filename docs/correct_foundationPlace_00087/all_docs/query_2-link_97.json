        "text": "English and math assessments are no longer required. Instead, Cypress College uses Guided Placement. The Guided Placement is a quick 5-minute questionnaire that helps transfer and degree seeking students select the best English, ESL, and/or math course options. Cypress College uses Multiple Measures, including your major, overall high school GPA, high school math courses, and any other relevant information such as AP, SAT, ACT scores. Students working toward certificates who do not intend to transfer or already have degrees may not need English, Math, or other General Education courses, which you can verify using Program Mapper. If you have additional questions, you may make an appointment with a counselor through our Counseling Center.\n\nSpecial Admit students are high school students who wish to attend Cypress College and high school at the same time. Though enrollment fees are waived for high school students, they must pay for the health fee (currently $19) and any material fees. Special admit students must fill out two applications: the main one and the Special Admit Student Program Application. NOTE: Special admit students may take up to 11 units ONLY.\n\nCypress College partners with area school districts to offer high school students the opportunity to earn college credit while attending high school. Students enrolled in dual enrollment courses earn credit for college classes that may be eligible to transfer to a CSU or UC institution. Courses offered in the dual enrollment program may be taken at the college or high school campus.
