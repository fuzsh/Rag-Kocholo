The IDF Diabetes Atlas (2021) reports that 10.5% of the adult population (20-79 years) has diabetes, with almost half unaware that they are living with the condition.\n\nBy 2045, IDF projections show that 1 in 8 adults, approximately 783 million, will be living with diabetes, an increase of 46%.\n\nOver 90% of people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes, which is driven by socio-economic, demographic, environmental, and genetic factors. The key contributors to the rise in type 2 diabetes include:\n\nUrbanisation\n\nAn ageing population\n\nDecreasing levels of physical activity\n\nIncreasing overweight and obesity prevalence"
