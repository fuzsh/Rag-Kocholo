        "text": "Aims of the common agricultural policy\n\nLaunched in 1962, the EU’s common agricultural policy (CAP) is a partnership between agriculture and society, and between Europe and its farmers. It aims to:\n\nsupport farmers and improve agricultural productivity, ensuring a stable supply of affordable food;\n\nsafeguard European Union farmers to make a reasonable living;\n\nhelp tackle climate change and the sustainable management of natural resources;\n\nmaintain rural areas and landscapes across the EU;\n\nkeep the rural economy alive by promoting jobs in farming, agri-food industries and associated sectors.\n\nThe CAP is a common policy for all EU countries. It is managed and funded at European level from the resources of the EU’s budget.\n\nCAP 2023-27\n\nTo consolidate the role of European agriculture for the future, the CAP has evolved over the years to meet changing economic circumstances and citizens’ requirements and needs.\n\nThe CAP 2023-27 entered into force on 1 January 2023. Support for farmers and rural stakeholders across the 27 EU countries is based on the CAP 2023-27 legal framework and the choices detailed in the CAP Strategic Plans, approved by the Commission. The approved Plans are designed to make a significant contribution to the ambitions of the European Green Deal, Farm to Fork Strategy and Biodiversity Strategy.\n\nThe CAP in practice\n\nFarming is unlike most other businesses, as the following special considerations apply:\n\ndespite the importance of food production, farmers’ income is around 40% lower compared to non-agricultural income;\n\nagriculture depends more on the weather and the climate than many other sectors;\n\nthere is an inevitable time gap between consumer demand and farmers being able to supply – growing more wheat or producing more milk inevitably takes time.\n\nWhile being cost-effective, farmers should work in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner, and maintain our soils and biodiversity.\n\nBusiness uncertainties and the environmental impact of farming justify the significant role that the public sector plays for our farmers. The CAP takes action with the following measures:\n\nincome support through direct payments ensures income stability, and remunerates farmers for environmentally friendly farming and delivering public services not normally paid for by the markets, such as taking care of the countryside;\n\nmarket measures to deal with difficult market situations such as a sudden drop in demand due to a health scare, or a fall in prices as a result of a temporary oversupply on the market;\n\nrural development measures with national and regional programmes to address the specific needs and challenges facing rural areas.\n\nCAP financing\n\nThe level of support for EU farmers from the overall EU budget reflects the many variables involved in ensuring continued access to high quality food, which includes functions such as income support to farmers, climate change action, and maintaining vibrant rural communities.\n\nThe CAP is financed through two funds as part of the EU budget:\n\nthe European agricultural guarantee fund (EAGF) provides direct support and funds market measures;\n\nthe European agricultural fund for rural development (EAFRD) finances rural development.\n\nPayments are managed at national level by each EU country. Information about the recipients of CAP payments is published by each country, in accordance with EU transparency rules.\n\nRelated information\n\nFinancing the CAP\n\nEU annual budget life-cycle\n\nEU budget\n\nThe benefits of the CAP\n\nThe CAP defines the conditions that will allow farmers to fulfil their functions in society in the following ways:\n\nFood production\n\nThere are around 10 million farms in the EU and 17 million people work regularly in the sector. They provide an impressive variety of abundant, affordable, safe and good quality products.\n\nThe EU is known throughout the world for its food and culinary traditions and is one of the world’s leading producers and net exporters of agri-food products. Due to its exceptional agricultural resources the EU could and should play a key role in ensuring food security for the world at large.\n\nRural community development\n\nWithin our countryside and its precious natural resources, there are many jobs linked to farming. Farmers need machinery, buildings, fuel, fertilisers and healthcare for their animals, also known as ‘upstream’ sectors.\n\nOther people are busy in ‘downstream’ operations – such as preparing, processing, and packaging food, as well as in food storage, transport and retail. The farming and food sectors together provide nearly 40 million jobs in the EU.\n\nTo operate efficiently and remain modern and productive, farmers, upstream and downstream sectors need ready access to the latest information on agricultural issues, farming methods and market developments. During the period 2014-20, the resources of the CAP were directed towards providing high-speed technologies, improved internet services and infrastructure to 18 million rural citizens – the equivalent of 6.4% of the EU’s rural population.\n\nEnvironmentally sustainable farming\n\nFarmers have a double challenge – to produce food whilst simultaneously protecting nature and safeguarding biodiversity. Using natural resources prudently is essential for our food production and for our quality of life – today, tomorrow and for future generations.\n\nKey contributors to the CAP\n\nThe European Commission regularly consults civil dialogue groups and agricultural committees to best shape law and policies governing agriculture. Expert groups provide input to the European Commission, such as the agricultural market task force on unfair trading practices.\n\nThe Commission carries out impact assessments when planning, preparing and proposing new European legislation, examining a need for EU action and the possible impacts of available solutions. They are a key part of the EU’s better regulation agenda. Impact assessments for agriculture and rural development took place in 2003 (mid term review), 2008 (health check – SEC(2008) 1885), 2011 (CAP towards 2020 – SEC(2011) 1153 final), and 2018 (support for strategic plans post 2020 – SWD(2018) 301 final).\n\nThe EU's Court of Auditors also plays a major role in supervising expenditure in agriculture.\n\nThe Commission regularly publishes public opinion reports (also called Eurobarometer) on Europeans' views on agriculture and the CAP. The Eurobarometer surveys, run in all EU countries, provide valuable information on citizens’ perception of the CAP. This includes awareness of the support provided through the CAP, its performance, quality matters, environment, the importance of the CAP and much more.\n\nEvaluation of the CAP\n\nEvaluation of the CAP 2023-27\n\nIn line with its transparency and monitoring requirements, the Commission put together an online dashboard presenting the targets set at national level by each EU country in its approved CAP Strategic Plan.\n\nThe CAP legislation includes 44 “result indicators”, linked to specific objectives. Not all 44 targets need to be included in each CAP Strategic Plan. Targets take into account the needs and the planned measures decided at national level.\n\nEvaluation of the CAP 2014-20\n\nThe Commission assesses the CAP through the common monitoring and evaluation framework (CMEF).\n\nThe aim of the CMEF is to demonstrate the achievements of the CAP during the 2014-20 period and improve its efficiency through CAP indicators.\n\nLegal foundations\n\nThe legal basis for the common agricultural policy is established in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n\nThe CAP 2023-27 is covered by three regulations, which generally apply since 1 January 2023:\n\nRegulation (EU) 2021/2116, repealing Regulation (EU) 1306/2013 on the financing, management and monitoring of the CAP;\n\nRegulation (EU) 2021/2115, establishing rules on support for national CAP strategic plans, and repealing Regulations (EU) 1305/2013 and 1307/2013;\n\nRegulation (EU) 2021/2117, amending Regulation (EU) 1308/2013 on the common organisation of the agricultural markets; Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 on quality schemes for agricultural products; Regulation (EU) No 251/2014 on geographical indications for aromatised wine products; and Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 laying down measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the EU.\n\nThe following four regulations set out the different elements of the CAP 2014-20:\n\nRegulation (EU) 1307/2013 on rules for direct payments to farmers;\n\nRegulation (EU) 1308/2013 on a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products;\n\nRegulation (EU) 1305/2013 on support for rural development;\n\nRegulation (EU) 1306/2013 on the financing, management and monitoring of the CAP.\n\nFor the years 2021-22, a transitional regulation (Regulation (EU) 2020/2220) was in force. The regulation laid down conditions for the provision of support from the EAGF and EAFRD during these years, extending and amending provisions set out in the preceding regulations. It remained in force until the new CAP began.\n\nThe CAP is managed by the Commission's department for agriculture and rural development. It can adopt delegated and implementing acts to implement the common agricultural policy.\n\nRelated information\n\nDirectory of legislation in force"
