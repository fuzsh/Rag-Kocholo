        "text": "A thriving Nigeria—with its rich natural resources, young and growing population, and continental leadership—is one of the most important goals for the world. Yet corruption, impunity, and mismanagement have deprived Nigeria of fulfilling its potential as citizens have limited access to quality public services and accountable governance. Nigeria also boasts a diverse and vibrant civil society, growing independent media sector, and strengthened criminal justice system. Nigerians are increasingly mobilizing and demanding a more just and accountable society. Paired with opportunities created by civil society, the media, government, and reforms in the criminal justice sector, we developed a strategy to reduce corruption and improve the quality of life for Nigerians.\n\nIn collaboration with stakeholders from civil society, donor partners, government, and academia, the On Nigeria Big Bet has been underway since 2016, and the strategy will conclude at the end of 2024.\n\nLearn About Our Strategy"
