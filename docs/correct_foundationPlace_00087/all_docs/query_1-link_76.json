        "text": "/ Asthma / Asthma Facts\n\nAsthma Facts and Figures\n\nThe burden of asthma in the United States falls disproportionately on people with low-income, senior adults, and Black, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska Native people. These groups have the highest asthma rates, deaths, and hospitalizations.\n\nWhat Is Asthma?\n\nAsthma is a chronic (long-term) disease that causes inflammation and swelling of the airways. This results in narrowing of the large and small airways that carry air from the nose and mouth to the lungs.\n\nAsthma symptoms include trouble breathing (shortness of breath), wheezing, coughing, and tightness or pain in the chest.\n\nAsthma symptoms can be triggered by different things for different people. Allergens, like seasonal pollen, mold spores, dust, or pet dander, are common triggers. Some people also develop asthma symptoms in response to respiratory infections, airway irritants, pollution, weather changes, certain foods, or with exercise.\n\nAsthma can be deadly if it is not recognized and managed appropriately.\n\nThere is no cure for asthma, but appropriate education and treatment prevents asthma attacks and can help you have a better quality of life.\n\nAsthma is one of the most common and costly diseases in the United States.\n\nHow Common Is Asthma?\n\nOver 27 million people in the U.S. have asthma. This equals about 1 in 12 people.1,2\n\nOver 22 million U.S. adults ages 18 and older have asthma.1\n\nAsthma rates are highest in American Indian or Alaska Native adults in the U.S.1\n\nAsthma is more common in female adults than male adults. Around 10.8% of female adults have asthma, compared to 6.5% of male adults.1\n\nIt is a leading chronic disease in children.3 Currently, there are about 4.5 million children under the age of 18 with asthma.2\n\nNon-Hispanic Black children are nearly 2 times more likely to have asthma compared to non-Hispanic White children.2\n\nAsthma is more common in male children than female children. Around 7.0% of male children have asthma, compared to 5.4% of female children.2\n\nAsthma is one of the most common and costly diseases in the United States.\n\nWhat Are the Rates of Asthma Attacks in Children?\n\nIn 2021, 38.7% of children ages 18 and younger who had asthma reported having one or more asthma attacks in the past year.4\n\nAbout 63.1% of children under the age of 5 with asthma had an attack.4\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), asthma attacks in children have declined from 2001 through 2020 (from 61% to 43%).5 Even though asthma is controllable, it is estimated that 44% of children with asthma have uncontrolled asthma.6\n\nWhat Are the Rates of Asthma Attacks in Adults?\n\nIn 2021, 39.6% of adults ages 18 and older who had asthma reported having one or more asthma attacks in the past year.4\n\nAccording to the CDC, asthma attacks in adults have declined from 2001 through 2020 (from 54% to 41%).5\n\nHow Many People Seek Medical Care for Asthma?\n\nIn 2019, asthma accounted for 4.9 million doctors’ office visits.7\n\nIn 2020, asthma accounted for 94,560 discharges from hospital inpatient care and 986,453 emergency department visits.8\n\nBlack people in the U.S. are nearly 6 times more likely than White people in the U.S. to visit the emergency department due to asthma.8\n\nHow Many People Die From Asthma?\n\nOn average, 10 people in the U.S. die from asthma each day. In 2021, 3,517 people died from asthma. Nearly all of these deaths are avoidable with the right treatment and care.9\n\nIn 2020, deaths due to asthma rose for the first time in 20 years. 5\n\nAdults are 6 times more likely to die from asthma than children.9\n\nFemale adults are more likely to die from asthma than male adults, and male children are more likely than female children.9\n\nBlack people in the U.S. are nearly 3 times more likely to die from asthma than White people in the U.S.9\n\nWhen sex is factored in, Black females have the highest rate of fatality due to asthma. In 2021, Black females were more than 3 times more likely to die from asthma than White males.10\n\nWhat Are the Costs of Asthma?\n\nFrom 2008-2013, the annual economic cost of asthma was more than $81.9 billion – including medical costs and loss of work and school days:11\n\n​$3 billion in losses due to missed work and school days\n\n$29 billion due to asthma-related mortality\n\n$50.3 billion in medical costs\n\nMedical costs for people with asthma are estimated to be $3,266 higher per year (in 2015 U.S. dollars) compared to medical costs for people without asthma.11\n\nAmong children ages 5 to 17, asthma is one of the top causes of missed school days. In 2013, it accounted for more than 13.8 million missed school days.12\n\nWhy Do Certain Racial or Ethnic Groups Have Higher Rates of Asthma, Asthma Attacks, or Asthma Deaths?\n\nSee AAFA’s groundbreaking research report on Asthma Disparities in America. Racial and ethnic differences in asthma frequency, illness, and death are caused by complex factors, including:\n\nStructural determinants such as systemic racism, segregation, and discriminatory policies\n\nSocial determinants such as socioeconomic status, education, neighborhood and physical environment, employment, social support networks, and access to health care\n\nBiological determinants such as genes and ancestry\n\nBehavioral determinants such as tobacco use and adherence to medicines\n\nSocial determinants and structural inequities (systemic racism) largely drive disparities in asthma. Factors such as genetics and individual behaviors contribute less to asthma disparities.\n\nWhy Do Males and Females Have Different Rates of Asthma?\n\nMale children are more likely to have asthma than female children. This trend reverses in adulthood, where female adults are more likely to have asthma than male adults.2\n\nSome studies suggest this trend reverses because of the effects of testosterone on lung cells. Testosterone, a male sex hormone, has been found to decrease the swelling of the airways in asthma.13\n\nDownload PDF\n\nAsthma Facts and Figures\n\nMedical Review: April 2024 by John M.
