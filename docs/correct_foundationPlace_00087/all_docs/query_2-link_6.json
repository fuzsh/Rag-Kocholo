This past month, we were delighted to host a series of engaging activities, starting with a memorable bingo night. Special thanks to Trystin Dunavin from Xavier High School, Andrew Lallave and his mother Miss Lallave from LaSalle Academy, and all other volunteers who contributed to the evening’s success.\n\nOur open bowling event showcased volunteer Jessica Cornils’ remarkable multitasking abilities. Her diligent assistance and scorekeeping were invaluable, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable experience for all participants. Additionally, last month’s tech talk explored the potential benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) for the blind community. A significant highlight was the introduction of OKO’s app, which utilizes AI to provide blind users with turn-by-turn directions, currently in its beta phase.\n\nFor those interested in further information about this innovative technology, please do not hesitate to contact me at the ABF office. I am eager to connect you with the company behind this promising development. Your involvement and curiosity greatly contribute to the richness of our community, transforming each event into a meaningful and enjoyable experience.
