        "text": "The uACR test checks for how much albumin and creatinine is in your urine sample, and then compares the numbers to each other. You may see many numbers from this test on your lab report – focus on the result that has the word ratio in the name. For example, the name on the report may be “alb/creat ratio”, “albumin/creat ratio”, or “albumin/creat ratio, random urine”.\n\nYour uACR results help describe the degree of albuminuria (proteinuria) you may be experiencing, if any. A lower number is better for this test, ideally lower than 30. A value of 30 or higher suggests you may be at a higher risk for kidney failure, a cardiovascular event (heart attack or stroke), heart failure, and even a shorter life expectancy (early death). The higher your number, the higher your risk.\n\nWhat to do next with your results depends on what your number is. It’s important to emphasize that this test often needs to be repeated one or more times to confirm the results. Decisions are rarely made based on the results from one sample."
