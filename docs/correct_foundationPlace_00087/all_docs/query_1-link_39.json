        "text": "Our curriculum encourages students to explore many disciplines and to develop a deep understanding in one area of concentration. Students apply to Princeton University, not to individual departments, programs or schools. Once enrolled, students may pursue either the Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) or the Bachelor of Science in Engineering (B.S.E.). Within these degree programs, students can choose from among 37 concentrations (computer science offers both A.B. and B.S.E.) and over 50 minors and interdepartmental certificate programs. The A.B. includes concentrations in Public Policy (Princeton School of Public and International Affairs) and the School of Architecture."
