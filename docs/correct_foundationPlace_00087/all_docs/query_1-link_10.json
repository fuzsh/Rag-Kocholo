And right now, more than 108,000 of those young people in the United States are waiting for someone to step forward to adopt them.\n\nAs our founder, Dave Thomas, always said,\n\n“These children are not someone else’s responsibility. They are our responsibility.”\n\nYou can help. Learn more and spread the word about the critical need for foster care adoption.\n\nDownload Adoption Guide\n\nThrough our national awareness campaigns and innovative programs, the Foundation is dedicated to achieving the vision that every child will have a permanent home and a loving family.\n\nA rigorous, five-year national evaluation revealed that children referred to our Wendy’s Wonderful Kids program are up to 3x more likely to be adopted from foster care.\n\nThe Foundation is pleased to announce the 18th Annual Best Adoption-Friendly Workplaces list, recognizing organizations that have made adoption and foster care supported options for their employees.\n\nBased on a survey of employers across the United States, the list scores participants on three criteria: financial reimbursement, paid leave and the percentage of employees who are eligible for adoption benefits.\n\nLEARN MORE"
