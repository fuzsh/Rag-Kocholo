        "text": "We began in 2006 with the idea that a different kind of economy was not only possible, but necessary — and that business could lead the way towards a new, stakeholder-driven model. B Lab became known for certifying B Corporations, which are companies that meet high standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency.\n\nBut we do much more than that. We’re building the B Corp movement to change our economic system — and to do so, we must change the rules of the game. B Lab creates standards, policies, tools, and programs that shift the behavior, culture, and structural underpinnings of capitalism. We mobilize the B Corp community towards collective action to address society’s most critical challenges.\n\nBy harnessing the power of business, B Lab positively impacts companies around the world, helping them balance profit with purpose. Together, we are shifting our global economy from a system that profits few to one that benefits all: advancing a new model that moves from concentrating wealth and power to ensuring equity, from extraction to generation, and from prioritizing individualism to embracing interdependence.\n\nWe won’t stop until all business is a force for good.\n\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\n\nB Lab has developed guidelines to minimize conflict of interest, reputational risk, and mission drift. We maintain a balance of mission-aligned philanthropic and earned revenue. Our Standards development and certification processes are transparent and clearly articulated, as is our complaints mechanism to address controversial issues and industries.\n\nSTATEMENT OF NEUTRALITY\n\nTo underscore B Lab Global's commitment to collective action, we agree to adopt a position of neutrality regarding the unionization of any employees of the organization.\n\nB INTERDEPENDENT\n\nIn 2020, B Lab Global established B Interdependent as a standalone resource for companies responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and the global uprising against racism. B Interdependent encourages the business community to lead with stakeholders at heart, with practices that ensure an inclusive, equitable, and regenerative future."
