        "text": "Las Vegas is one of the most visited places in the world, and the UNLV campus is minutes away from the excitement and opportunities the Strip has to offer. Our world-class resorts and outdoor recreational areas provide adventure, enrichment, and unique learning opportunities.\n\nWith 78 majors and 84 minors, UNLV does more than offer options — we provide opportunities. Plus, if your professional ambitions require you to obtain multiple degrees, UNLV also has more than 197 graduate degree and certificate programs and our own law, medicine, and dental medicine schools. We are proud that our academics draw upon the influences of our community, and offer an education like nowhere else.\n\nSearch Degrees\n\nHere’s the first thing to know about Rebels: You can’t define us. There is no “average” Rebel. One third of our students are the first in their families to go to college. Tagalog is one of the most-spoken second languages among our students. Military Times lists us as one of its Best for Vets. All that ripples throughout our campus. It creates a climate where you can both find your people and expand your worldview.\n\nDripping in the golden desert sun and spread across 350 acres in the heart of Las Vegas, UNLV provides nowhere-else opportunities in this 24-hour metropolis. And while Las Vegas might be the center of it all, it doesn’t take long to slip the bonds of this little oasis and get out into the desert, as we are just minutes from natural getaways and less than a day’s drive from the entire American Southwest."
