        "text": "Phase 1 tests the safety of the intervention and is performed in a very small number of subjects to find the highest dose of the new treatment that can be given without causing severe side effects. For the treatment to enter Phase 1 testing, it has already been tested in lab and animal studies. Because of the small number of people in Phase 1 studies, rare side effects may not be seen until later phases of trials.\n\nPhase 2 tests a larger group of patients (between 20 to 150) with the same disease, administering the experimental treatment as everyone gets in the Phase 1 study. Some Phase 2 studies randomly assign people to different treatment groups. These groups may get different doses or get the treatment in different ways to see which provides the best balance of safety and response. These studies may be done at major hospital centers, community hospitals or even at doctor’s offices.\n\nPhase 3 clinical trials compare the safety and effectiveness of the new experimental treatment against the current standard treatment. Because health providers do not yet know which treatment is better, participants are often picked at random (called randomized) to get either the standard treatment or the new experimental treatment.\n\nWhen possible, neither the doctor nor the patient knows which of the treatments the patient is getting. This type of study is called a double-blind study. Phase 3 studies are conducted in multiple sites and might even be done in different countries. They are often very large, involve hundreds of patients and take a long time for results. As with other trials, patients in phase 3 clinical trials are watched closely for side effects, and treatment is stopped if they’re too hard to manage.\n\nPhase 4 studies look at drugs already approved by the FDA. These drugs are available for doctors to prescribe for patients. But phase 4 studies might still be needed to answer important questions. They usually involve thousands of people and look at safety over time, as well as examine other aspects of the treatment, such as quality of life or cost effectiveness. You can get the drugs used in a Phase 4 trial without being in a study."
