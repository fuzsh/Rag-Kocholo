The ACR considers adherence to these guidelines and recommendations to be voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding their application to be made by the clinician in light of each patient's individual circumstances.\n\nGuidelines and recommendations are intended to promote beneficial or desirable outcomes but cannot guarantee any specific outcome. Guidelines and recommendations developed and/or endorsed by the ACR are subject to periodic revision as warranted by the evolution of medical knowledge, technology, and practice."
