The goal of this project is to provide a secure, efficient and extensible server that provides HTTP services in sync with the current HTTP standards.\n\nThe Apache HTTP Server (\"httpd\") was launched in 1995 and it has been the most popular web server on the Internet since April 1996. It has celebrated its 25th birthday as a project in February 2020.\n\nThe Apache HTTP Server is a project of The Apache Software Foundation.\n\nApache httpd 2.4.62 Released 2024-07-17¶\n\nThe Apache Software Foundation and the Apache HTTP Server Project are pleased to announce the release of version 2.4.62 of the Apache HTTP Server (\"httpd\").\n\nThis latest release from the 2.4.x stable branch represents the best available version of Apache HTTP Server.\n\nApache HTTP Server version 2.4.43 or newer is required in order to operate a TLS 1.3 web server with OpenSSL 1.1.1.\n\nDownload | ChangeLog for 2.4.62 | Complete ChangeLog for 2.4 | New Features in httpd 2.4\n\nApache httpd 2.2 End-of-Life 2018-01-01¶\n\nAs previously announced, the Apache HTTP Server Project has discontinued all development and patch review of the 2.2.x series of releases.\n\nThe Apache HTTP Server Project had long committed to provide maintenance releases of the 2.2.x flavor through June of 2017.
