        "text": "King's welcomes applicants to our undergraduate courses from countries all over the world.\n\nEntry requirements will vary according to the course of study, so it is important to check specific entry qualifications within our online prospectus on the individual course pages under the 'Entry requirements' section. International entry requirements can also be found in this location under 'International applicants'.\n\nIf your country or qualification is not listed on the online prospectus please contact our King's Advisors for further help.\n\nOur online prospectus will have further details of selection procedures and any other requirements for entry onto your chosen course.\n\nEvery undergraduate programme available to study at King’s will have a list of entry requirements, which can be found on our online prospectus. If a programme includes any requirements regarding applicants that have re-sat their qualifications, this will be clearly stated under the ‘Entry requirements’ tab for your chosen programme of study.\n\nWe strongly advise that you take some time to review our online prospectus before making an application to study at King's. For some of our very competitive courses, you should bear in mind that your application will be reviewed alongside other strong applicants, who might be viewed more favourably if they achieved the required grades within the standard study period, for example, two years for A-levels.\n\nApplicants who have recently achieved grades which are below the entry criteria, and have subsequently studied/are studying another eligible qualification to seek entry, such as an Access to HE Diploma or a UK Foundation programme, may also be considered as a resit applicant.\n\nWe understand that some applicants may offer a combination of level 3 qualifications taken at the same time and we can consider certain combinations for entry onto our undergraduate programmes. For example, we can consider combinations of two A-levels and one Pre-U Principal Subject or one A-level and two Pre-U Principal Subjects. Our A-level BTEC combinations can be found on the individual course pages.\n\nCombinations of different level 3 qualifications are considered on a case-by-case basis and we do not count qualifications taken in the same subject as two separate qualifications at level 3.\n\nAll the programmes below require students to take an aptitude test in addition to meeting other entry requirements. This provides us with additional information about an applicant's abilities and potential.\n\nThese tests are compulsory so it is important that you check the online prospectus entry for your programme for further details of how these test results are used in selection, and to ensure that you make arrangements for taking the test in good time (where applicable).\n\nAptitude tests\n\nA few things to note:\n\nYou must take the exact test specified: for example, for Medicine we require the UCAT, and we will not accept the BMAT.\n\nIf you usually require special arrangements for assessments (for example, extra time or a particular test environment) due to a learning difference or disability, make sure that you inform the test provider in good time.\n\nSome test providers will charge a fee for taking this test. However, usually the provider will be able to waive fees or provide a discount/bursary for applicants in financial need: exact arrangements may vary so please do check with the test provider.\n\nUnfortunately, we are unable to consider Mitigating Circumstances for issues affecting a UCAT or LNAT test.\n\nHow many subjects?\n\nOur conditional offers are based on three A-level subjects. If you are studying four or more A-level subjects, we will take the highest three grades into consideration for assessment. High achievement in additional A-level subjects may compensate for an applicant who narrowly fails to achieve the A-level offer.\n\nGrades and predictions\n\nIf you have achieved your A-level grades already please declare these on your application. If you are taking your A-levels in the year you are applying, we would expect predicted grades to be provided for these by your referee.\n\nFor the majority of our undergraduate programmes, we do not consider AS-levels and applicants are required to complete A-levels in full.\n\nEarly sittings\n\nPlease note that whilst King’s encourages students to stretch themselves academically, students who are entered early for their examinations should have the potential to achieve the same grade as might be expected if they were entered in the standard year. Therefore, if you gain an A-level B in Year 11, this will not be considered as competitive as a student who achieved a grade A in year 12.\n\nExceptions\n\nA-levels in General Studies, Critical Thinking, Thinking Skills and Global Perspectives are not accepted by King’s as one of your A-levels.\n\nPractical endorsement\n\nKing’s believes that practical skills are a vital part of a Science education. Where an applicant is studying linear A Levels in England, a pass in the practical endorsement is required in all Science subjects. This is with the exception of private candidates who are unable to take the practical component.\n\nNative language A-level\n\nAll modern foreign language A-levels can be used for entry regardless of an applicant's native language. Any subject requirements for the programme must also be met.\n\nKing’s welcomes applicants with the UK Access to HE Diploma, and will usually specify a certain number of Level 3 credits required at Distinction and Merit level.\n\nWhere our entry requirements specify compulsory or preferred subjects, you may be asked for additional information on the subject content of your Diploma. Please check the online programme pages carefully for subject specific requirements. However, where accepted, as a general guide:\n\nA-level requirements\n\nEquivalent Access to HE Diploma requirements\n\nA*A*A\n\n45 Level 3 credits: 42 must be from units awarded at Distinction, with 3 level 3 credits at Merit\n\nA*AA\n\n45 Level 3 credits: 39 must be from units awarded at Distinction, with 6 level 3 credits at Merit\n\nAAA\n\n45 Level 3 credits: 36 must be from units awarded at Distinction, with 9 level 3 credits at Merit\n\nAAB\n\n45 Level 3 credits: 33 must be from units awarded at Distinction, with 12 level 3 credits at Merit\n\nABB\n\n45 Level 3 credits: 30 must be from units awarded at Distinction, with 15 level 3 credits at Merit\n\nBBB\n\n45 Level 3 credits: 30 credits must be from units awarded at Distinction, 12 from units awarded at Merit, and 3 from units awarded at Pass\n\nThinking of taking an Access to HE Diploma?\n\nPlease check our online prospectus carefully to check acceptability for your preferred programme of study at King's. You can find a list of accredited Access to HE courses in your area on the Access to HE Diploma website.\n\nPredicted grades\n\nWe recognise that many referees may not feel in a position to accurately predict Access to HE results early in the application cycle. However, to ensure a fair assessment is applied to all applicants, we do require predicted grades and, therefore, where a referee is unable to provide predicted grades at the point of application, the Admissions team will contact you via King’s Apply to request predicted grades, and will be unable to progress your application further without them. A final deadline will be set for the predicted grades to be provided.\n\nAP Calculus AB and AP Calculus BC can be considered as individual APs. However, for programmes with a Mathematics subject requirement, applicants will need to complete AP Calculus BC or SAT Subject Test Maths Level 2 to meet the subject requirement.\n\nFor programmes with a Physics subject requirement, applicants will need to complete either AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism or AP Physics C: Mechanics or SAT Subject Test Physics.\n\nIf an applicant is taking more than one AP/SAT Subject Test in the same subject, we are only able to count it as one subject.\n\nAP Microeconomics and AP Macroeconomics can be considered as individual APs.\n\nAP European History, AP US History and AP World History can be considered as individual APs.\n\nAP Capstone Research and Seminar is not accepted. We also do not consider AP classes towards meeting our entry requirements and applicants must have taken, or be taking, AP exams.\n\nFor some highly-competitive programmes, where applicants are applying using the Just AP route, those who are studying/have studied more than the minimum required five will be considered more competitive.\n\nMost of our undergraduate programmes will consider the following Pearson BTEC and OCR Cambridge Technicals qualifications, with the exception of Medicine and Dentistry.\n\nWe accept both BTEC Nationals and BTEC International with the same entry requirements.\n\nPlease check our online prospectus for the specific requirements for the programme you are interested in.\n\nMost programmes will require a BTEC or Cambridge Technical qualification to be accompanied by one or two A-levels, and Distinctions are usually required. Where our entry requirements specify compulsory or preferred subjects, applicants will be expected to meet this with their A-level qualification.\n\nPlease note, if an application is received for a programme where the entry requirements state that A-levels are required alongside the BTEC/Cambridge Technical but no A-levels are declared on the application, the application will be made unsuccessful. Therefore, to avoid using one of your five UCAS choices on an application that will be automatically rejected, please check the entry requirements before applying to ensure you are completing the required combination of qualifications for that programme.\n\nKing's welcomes applications from students who achieved Pre-U qualifications up until their discontinuation. Each programme will require a specific level of achievement in the three Principal subjects. We recognise that some students might offer a mixed portfolio of Pre-U and A-level qualifications and are experienced in assessing such applications. As a guide:\n\nPre-U equivalencies\n\nExceptions\n\nPre-U Global Perspectives is not accepted by King’s as one of your Pre-U Principal subjects. However, the grade may be taken into account if a candidate falls just short of the conditions of their offer.\n\nWe recognise that Core Maths qualifications have the potential to develop a level of mathematical skill that would be beneficial for studying many of our undergraduate programmes, and we will accept Core Maths in lieu of any required maths grade at GCSE, using the below equivalencies. However, where maths is a required subject at A level, we would not consider Core Maths to be a suitable alternative for meeting this requirement.\n\nKing's has agreed the following grade equivalencies:\n\nGCSE (A*- G)\n\nCore Maths\n\nA*/8\n\nA\n\nA/7\n\nB\n\nB/6\n\nC\n\nC/5\n\nC\n\nApplicants studying Foundation Year programmes in the UK are welcome to apply for this programme. Foundation programmes from other universities and further education providers in the UK are considered on a case-by-case basis. Whether or not we can consider a particular foundation year as suitable for study at King's depends on the content of the syllabus and modules studied. In the past we have accepted foundation programmes from a number of other institutions.\n\nWe are unable to accept Foundation programmes that are integrated as part of a main degree at another institution. These may be called Year 0 or Integrated Foundations. We are also unable to accept non-UK Foundation courses.\n\nOnce you have submitted an application, the Admissions Office may contact you via King's Apply to ask for further details on your qualification, such as a list of modules and course specifications.\n\nThe King's International Foundation Programme has guaranteed pathways available for progression onto our King's undergraduate degree programmes, and information can be found on the website.\n\nGCSE requirements\n\nSome programmes require students to have achieved a certain standard(s) at GCSE (or equivalent below) in addition to higher qualifications (such as A-levels). For example, students applying for a degree leading to registration as a nurse or midwife must have achieved five GCSEs at grade C or above, including English Language, Mathematics and Science.\n\nGCSEs taken earlier than Year 11\n\nPlease note that whilst King’s encourages students to stretch themselves academically, students who are entered early for their public examinations should have the potential to achieve the same grade as might be expected if they were entered in the standard year. This means that a student who gains a GCSE Grade B in Year 10 will be considered to have Grade B and will not be considered favourably when compared to students who achieved Grade A in the standard year of examination.\n\nNote: If GCSE is your highest qualification, you will need to undertake further study before you are eligible to apply for a programme at King's.\n\nGCSEs (9 to 1) - England\n\nSince summer 2017, student’s GCSE English and GCSE Maths exam results are graded from 9-1 instead of A*-G. From summer 2019, all GCSE subjects are graded this way. King's has agreed the following grade equivalencies:\n\nGCSE (9 to 1)\n\nGCSEs (A* - C* - G) - Northern Ireland\n\nSince summer 2019, all GCSE subjects in Northern Ireland from CCEA are graded on a new nine-letter grading scale from A*-G. This grading scale will introduce the new C* grade. King's has agreed the following grade equivalencies:\n\nGCSEs Northern Ireland\n\nKing’s welcomes students from the UK and across the globe studying the IB Diploma. Our offers will usually specify certain marks in three subjects at Higher Level, in addition to an overall point score for the whole Diploma. Our point score includes points for Theory of Knowledge (TOK) and the Extended Essay (EE). As a guide:\n\nNew IB Mathematics requirements\n\nSince summer 2021, students can choose either the Analysis and Approaches or Applications and Interpretation pathway for Mathematics. Where Mathematics is required at Higher Level, King’s would ask applicants to study:\n\nIB Maths requirements\n\nIf Maths is a listed as a preferred subject, either pathway would be adequate preparation for the programme. When Maths is required at GCSE level, IB applicants can use either pathway at Standard Level or the Maths component of their IB Middle Years programme to meet this requirements.\n\nMeeting GCSE requirements through the IB Middle Years Programme\n\nIf a student has taken the IB Middle Years Programme and wishes to use this qualification to meet GCSE requirements for a programme, we use the following equivalencies. Please consult the online prospectus to check which programmes have GCSE requirements.\n\nGCSE IB Middle Years Programme 7/A 6 6/B 5 5/C 4 4/C 4\n\nKing’s welcomes students from the UK and across the globe studying the IB Career-related Programme (IBCP). Due to the flexible structure of the IBCP, each combination will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.\n\nMost of our programmes will consider the IBCP as a combination of IB HL courses and Level 3 BTEC diplomas. For example, for any of our courses which would accept a BTEC National Diploma (120 credits) at DM with one A-level at A, we would require a BTEC National Diploma (120 credits) at DM with one IB Higher Level course at 6.\n\nPlease check our online prospectus for programme-specific requirements for BTEC qualifications.\n\nWhere our entry requirements specify compulsory or preferred subjects, we will usually be looking for this to have been met via the subject content of IB Higher Level courses.\n\nKing's welcomes applications from students studying Scottish Highers and Advanced Highers. Our offers normally require applicants to take two Advanced Highers in addition to three Highers. Comparable typical offer requirements:\n\nRequired and preferred subjects\n\nSome of the programmes we offer require you to have studied a subject or subjects to a certain level before commencing your undergraduate studies. Any required subjects must be met at Advanced Higher level. Where our online prospectus asks for a specific subject grade at A-level, we are likely to require A in the Advanced Higher subject for an A*, A in the Advanced Higher subject for an A and B in the Advanced Higher subject for a B (see our online prospectus for details of any compulsory/preferred subjects). Where our online prospectus states 'Preferred subjects', this indicates that you may be at an advantage if you are studying the subject(s); however they are not compulsory for admission.\n\n'Double counting'\n\nKing's does not count the Higher and Advanced Higher in the same subject. As an example, this means that an applicant offering Mathematics as a Higher level subject could not also use Advanced Higher level Mathematics to meet the typical offer requirements.\n\nKing’s would normally expect applicants taking the Advanced Welsh Baccalaureate Skills Challenge Certificate to have studied three subjects to A-level as part of their qualification, and would make an offer based on these A-level grades. However, where a school or college is unable to offer students a third A-level alongside the Welsh Baccalaureate, King’s would consider making an offer based on the Advanced Skills Challenge Certificate alongside two A-levels. In these cases, a statement must be included in the first few lines of the UCAS reference to inform us of the school’s policy in this regard."
