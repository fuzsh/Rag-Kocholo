Some of the signs of foundation failure are obvious, such as foundation cracks, but there are other symptoms of stress on your foundation that aren't immediately noticeable. If you identify any of the issues listed below in your home, it’s best to have your foundation inspected by a Red Deer foundation repair professional as soon as possible.\n\nFoundation Problem Signs:\n\nCracked Brick/Stucco - Stair-step cracks in exterior foundation walls.\n\nBowing Walls - Concrete wall leaning in at the top.\n\nShearing Walls - Inward movement of the bottom of the block wall.\n\nCeiling Gaps - Space between the ceiling and the interior wall.\n\nSagging Floors - Sloping floors or gap between the floor and the interior wall.\n\nChimney Separation - Chimney separating from the house.\n\nWhat Causes Foundation Issues in Red Deer, AB\n\nFoundation problems can be caused by a variety of environmental factors, many of which are related to precipitation, soil type and density, and temperature fluctuations. In Red Deer, while rainfall only totals a moderate 53 centimeters each year, annual snowfall can exceed 105 centimeters through the winter. Couple the precipitation with central Alberta’s frigid winter temperatures, and the spring thaw can present a great deal of pressure for your home’s foundation.\n\nWhen soils moisten, freeze, and then thaw, the movement of water in the soil surrounding your home’s foundation can cause hydrostatic pressure (the weight of water on top of itself). The “fill-in” soil (the dirt that was excavated when initially digging out your foundation) is often of a different density than the soil that surrounds it, allowing for different drainage rates around your foundation. If the soil around the fill-in doesn’t drain as well, and the fill-in becomes saturated during the thaw, the weight of water contained in the fill-in will put significant pressure on your basement’s foundation and footings, leading to structural decay over time.\n\nConcrete Repair in Red Deer\n\nConcrete is susceptible to many of the same environmental factors that impact the integrity of your foundation. Outdoor concrete slabs have to contend with changing temperatures, rain and snow, changing soil levels and more, though the added factors of being outdoors year-round and exposure to the elements at the ground-level makes the life of a concrete slab or sidewalk even tougher.\n\nThe good news is most concrete can be permanently leveled and repaired without having to replace it. We offer a proven Concrete Protection System to help Red Deer homeowners quickly restore the concrete around their homes.\n\nConcrete Solutions:\n\nLift and level concrete slabs\n\nSeal concrete cracks and joints\n\nSeal concrete surfaces to protect against pitting, flaking, and staining\n\nResurface concrete to restore its look and function\n\nWhy More Red Deer Homeowners Choose Us:"
