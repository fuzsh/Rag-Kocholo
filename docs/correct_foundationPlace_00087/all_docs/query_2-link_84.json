        "text": "What the EU is doing and why\n\nThe EU taxonomy is a cornerstone of the EU’s sustainable finance framework and an important market transparency tool. It helps direct investments to the economic activities most needed for the transition, in line with the European Green Deal objectives. The taxonomy is a classification system that defines criteria for economic activities that are aligned with a net zero trajectory by 2050 and the broader environmental goals other than climate.\n\nIn order to meet the EU’s climate and energy targets for 2030 and reach the objectives of the European green deal, it is vital that we direct investments towards sustainable projects and activities. To achieve this, a common language and a clear definition of what is ‘sustainable’ is needed. This is why the action plan on financing sustainable growth called for the creation of a common classification system for sustainable economic activities, or an “EU taxonomy”.\n\nThe EU taxonomy allows financial and non-financial companies to share a common definition of economic activities that can be considered environmentally sustainable.\n\nIn this way, it plays an important role in helping the EU scale up sustainable investment, by creating security for investors, protecting private investors from greenwashing, helping companies become more climate-friendly and mitigating market fragmentation.\n\nThe Taxonomy Regulation entered into force on 12 July 2020. It establishes the basis for the EU taxonomy by setting out the 4 overarching conditions that an economic activity has to meet in order to qualify as environmentally sustainable.\n\nUnder the Taxonomy Regulation, the Commission had to come up with the actual list of environmentally sustainable activities by defining technical screening criteria for each environmental objective through delegated and implementing acts.\n\nEU taxonomy explained\n\nFactsheet on how companies, public entities, and financial actors are using the taxonomy\n\nEU taxonomy navigator\n\nThe Commission created an educational and user-friendly website offering a series of online tools to help users better understand the EU taxonomy in a simple and practical manner, ultimately facilitating its implementation and supporting companies in their reporting obligations.\n\nThe EU taxonomy navigator offers four tools that will help you navigate the EU taxonomy:\n\nEU taxonomy compass: a visual representation of sectors, activities and criteria included in the EU Taxonomy delegated acts\n\nEU taxonomy calculator: a step-by-step guide on reporting obligations\n\nFAQs repository: an overview of questions and answers on the EU taxonomy and its delegated acts\n\nEU taxonomy user guide: a guidance document on the Taxonomy for non-experts\n\nFind out more about the EU taxonomy navigator\n\nCommission expert groups on sustainable finance\n\nThe Platform is an advisory body subject to the Commission’s horizontal rules for expert groups.\n\nThe Technical expert group on sustainable finance (TEG) was set up from 2018 to 2020 to assist the Commission in developing the work put forward in the legislative proposals of May 2018.\n\nFurther information on the MSEG is available on the European Commission Register of Commission Expert Groups and similar entities.\n\nPolicy making timeline\n\n21 November 2023\n\nDelegated act - Environmental and climate\n\nPublication in the Official Journal of a Delegated Act for economic activities substantially contributing to the objectives of\n\nsustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n\ntransition to a circular economy\n\npollution prevention and control\n\nprotection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\n\nAmendments to add economic activities to the list of those substantially contributing to the objectives of climate change mitigation and adaptation, and to clarify the reporting obligations for the additional activities. The delegated acts were approved in principle on 13 June 2023 and adopted on 27 June 2023.
