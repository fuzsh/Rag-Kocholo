I received a letter from PennDOT indicating my registration plate is up for the registration plate reissuance but want to keep my current plate configuration. Can I do so?​\n\n10. Can I have my standard issued registration plate replaced with a specialty plate?\n\n​​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nA registration plate is deemed illegible when one or more numbers or letters cannot be recognized from 50 feet or if the registration plate shows any blistering, peeling, discoloration or loss of reflectivity. When a registration plate becomes illegible, PennDOT has two main ways of replacing them. First, the law allows PennDOT to reissue a registration plate upon request of a vehicle owner when an authorized representative of PennDOT or law enforcement determines that a registration plate is illegible. Vehicle safety inspection mechanics are authorized representatives of PennDOT and may determine if a registration plate is legible.\n\nTo apply for a free replacement of your current registration plate, the vehicle owner should print Form MV-46, \"Application for Replacement of Illegible Registration Plate,\" obtained from PennDOT's Driver and Vehicle Services website at www.dmv.pa.gov and taking it to either a law enforcement official or a certified inspection station to verify the need for a replacement due to illegibility. The vehicle owner is then responsible for signing and returning the completed Form MV-46 to PennDOT in order to receive a replacement registration plate free of charge.\n\nSecond, the law also allows PennDOT to order a general registration plate reissuance. Standard issue passenger registration plates that start with the tag configuration 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H' and truck registration plates that start with the tag configuration 'Y' are the oldest on the road and need to be replaced. If you have a standard issue registration plate beginning with an 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'J' or 'Y', you will get a new registration plate the next time your registration plate is transferred to a different vehicle. Passenger registration plates that start with a tag configuration 'D' are the oldest plates on the road. PennDOT has begun replacing the 'D' configuration through the mail. Customers will receive a letter informing them when they should expect to receive their new plate.\n\n1. Can a vehicle fail inspection for having an illegible registration plate?\n\nNo. The Vehicle Equipment and Inspection Regulations state that the only time a vehicle will fail an inspection is if the registration plate is hanging loosely, the registration plate is not in agreement with the numbers on the registration card, the registration plate is obscured or the registration plate lamp, if originally equipped, does not illuminate the registration plate.\n\n2. What happens if a vehicle owner does not send in Form MV-46?\n\nThe operator of the vehicle would be in violation of Section 1332 of the Pennsylvania Vehicle Code, which may result in a $100 fine.\n\n3. What does a vehicle owner do with the old registration plate?\n\nIt should be destroyed or returned to PennDOT to be recycled. Old registration plates may be returned to:\n\nBureau of Motor Vehicles, Return Tag Unit, P.O. Box 68597, Harrisburg, PA 17106-8597.\n\n4. If a vehicle has a Special Fund (e.g. Wildlife Resource) or a Special Organization (e.g. Penn State Alumni) registration plate requiring replacement, what type of registration plate will the owner receive?\n\nThe vehicle owner will receive the same type of registration plate they currently have. The configuration will not be the same, and​ if the registration plate has been redesigned, they will receive the new design. However, if the registration plate type is no longer available, they will receive a standard issue plate.\n\n5. Are there any types of registration plates that will be replaced with the same letter/number configuration?\n\nYes. If the vehicle owner has a personalized registration plate, they will receive a replacement registration plate bearing the same letters and/or numerals, free of charge. If a personalized registration plate is being replaced, the vehicle owner's inspection mechanic should complete Form MV-46, Sections A, B, and C, and the law enforcement official or inspection mechanic should be sure any spaces or dashes are listed in the proper location on Form MV-46. The customer must also include a photo of their personalized registration plate.\n\n6. ​After the owner applies for a new registration plate, how long will it take to receive the registration plate?\n\nOnce PennDOT receives the request, it could take up to 15 days for the registrant to receive their standard issue registration plate and between 6-8 weeks for a personalized registration plate.\n\n7. What does a vehicle owner do if their vehicle is not due for inspection and believes they are in need of a replacement registration plate?\n\nIt is unlawful to display on a vehicle a registration plate that is obscured or otherwise illegible. If the registration plate cannot be recognized from a distance, or if the registration plate shows any blistering, peeling, discoloration or loss of reflectivity, the vehicle owner should print Form MV-46, obtained from PennDOT's Driver and Vehicle Services website at www.dmv.pa.gov and either take it to a law enforcement official or a certified inspection station to verify the need for a replacement due illegibility. The vehicle owner is then responsible for signing and returning the completed Form MV-46 to PennDOT in order to receive a replacement registration plate free of charge.​​​\n\n​\n\n8​​​. What​ l​aw allows PennDOT to order a general registration plate reissuance for Standard issue passenger registration plates?\n\nPennDOT began a new registration plate reissuance for older Pennsylvania registration plates that may be weathered, damaged, or unreadable. Section 1331 (f) of Title 75​, the Pennsylvania Vehicle Code, provides for the reissuance of current registration plates previously issued.\n\n​ 9. I received a letter from PennDOT indicating my registration plate is up for the registration plate reissuance but want to keep my current plate configuration. ​\n\nPlease contact the phone number listed on the letter and request your current registration plate reissuance configuration be made into a personalized plate. PennDOT will advise you to complete Form MV-904​ and send it to PennDOT with the applicable fee. PennDOT will place a flag on your record so that your current plate is not replaced. You will have 90 days to send in the application and fee. When received, PennDOT will create the personalized plate with your old configuration. If the application is not received within 90 days, PennDOT will process the standard registration plate reissuance. If a customer is requesting the plate be replaced with the same configuration, they will be required to pay the personalization fee of $97.\n\n10. ​Can I have my standard issued registration plate replaced with a specialty plate?​\n\nWe are unable to replace your standard issue registration plate with a specialty plate in the general registration plate reissuance program for free. You can submit the applicable form for the specialty plate​ you would like to request and include the applicable fees.​​​\n\n​\n\nAdditional questions may be directed to PennDOT's Customer Call Center at 717-412-5300. TTY callers — please dial 711 to reach us."
