Sometimes, bullying can involve negative physical contact as well. Bullying usually involves repeated incidents or a pattern of behaviour that is intended to intimidate, offend, degrade or humiliate a particular person or group of people. It has also been described as the assertion of power through aggression.\n\nIs bullying a workplace issue?\n\nBack to top\n\nYes, bullying is a workplace issue. In Canada, occupational health and safety laws include the concept of due diligence. Due diligence means that employers shall take all reasonable precautions, under the particular circumstances, to prevent injuries or incidents in the workplace. Every person should be able to work in a safe and healthy workplace. The legislation in your jurisdiction will describe the roles and responsibilities for workplace parties with respect to workplace harassment and violence, including developing and implementing policies and programs. Definitions of harassment and violence often formally include bullying, but can be implied if not.\n\nPlease refer to the following OSH Answers documents for more information:\n\nBullying in the Workplace\n\nInternet Harassment or Cyberbullying\n\nViolence and Harassment in the Workplace\n\nViolence and Harassment in the Workplace – Family (Domestic) Violence\n\nViolence and Harassment in the Workplace – Legislation\n\nViolence and Harassment in the Workplace – Dealing with Negative Interactions\n\nViolence and Harassment in the Workplace – Parking Lot Safety\n\nViolence and Harassment in the Workplace – Warning Signs\n\nViolence and Harassment in the Workplace – Working Late\n\nWhat are examples of bullying?\n\nBack to top\n\nWhile bullying is a form of aggression, the actions can be both obvious and subtle. It is important to note that the following is not a checklist, nor does it mention all forms of bullying. There is no way to predict who may be the bully or the target.\n\nThis list is included as a way of showing some of the ways bullying may happen in a workplace. Also remember that bullying is usually considered to be a pattern of behaviour where one or more incidents will help show that bullying is taking place, but it may be one incident, especially one that has a lasting effect.\n\nExamples include:\n\nSpreading malicious rumours, gossip, or innuendo.\n\nExcluding or isolating someone socially.\n\nIntimidating a person.\n\nUndermining or deliberately impeding a person's work.\n\nPhysically abusing or threatening abuse.\n\nRemoving areas of responsibilities without cause.\n\nConstantly changing work guidelines.\n\nEstablishing impossible deadlines that will set up the individual to fail.\n\nWithholding necessary information or purposefully giving the wrong information.\n\nMaking jokes that are 'obviously offensive' by spoken word or e-mail.\n\nIntruding on a person's privacy by pestering, spying or stalking.\n\nAssigning unreasonable duties or workload which are unfavourable to one person (in a way that creates unnecessary pressure).\n\nUnderwork – creating a feeling of uselessness.\n\nYelling or using profanity.\n\nCriticizing a person persistently or constantly.\n\nBelittling a person's opinions.\n\nUnwarranted (or undeserved) punishment.\n\nBlocking applications for training, leave or promotion.\n\nTampering with a person's personal belongings or work equipment.\n\nIf you are not sure an action or statement could be considered bullying, you can use the \"reasonable person\" test. Would most people consider the action unacceptable?\n\nWhat might not be considered bullying?\n\nBack to top\n\nIt is sometimes hard to know if bullying is happening at the workplace. Bullying can be very subtle and may be more obvious once a pattern of behaviour is established.\n\nAlso, many studies acknowledge that there is a \"fine line\" between strong management and bullying. Comments that are objective and are intended to provide constructive feedback are not usually considered bullying, but rather are intended to assist the employee with their work.\n\nAs described by WorkSafeBC, bullying and harassing behaviour does not include:\n\nExpressing differences of opinion.\n\nOffering constructive feedback, guidance, or advice about work related behaviour.\n\nReasonable action taken by an employer or supervisor relating to the management and direction of workers or the place of employment (e.g., managing a worker's performance, taking reasonable disciplinary actions, assigning work).\n\nPrince Edward Island also adds that when done reasonably and fairly, the following actions are generally not considered workplace bullying or harassment:\n\nwith good reason, changing work assignments and job duties;\n\nscheduling and workloads;\n\ninspecting the workplace;\n\nimplementing health and safety measures;\n\ndelivering work instructions;\n\nassessing and evaluating work performance;\n\ndisciplinary actions; and/or\n\nany other reasonable and lawful exercise of a management function.\n\nHow can bullying affect an individual?\n\nBack to top\n\nPeople who are the targets of bullying may experience a range of effects. These reactions include:\n\nShock.\n\nAnger.\n\nFeelings of frustration and/or helplessness.\n\nIncreased sense of vulnerability.\n\nLoss of confidence.\n\nPhysical symptoms such as:\n\nInability to sleep.\n\nLoss of appetite.\n\nPsychosomatic symptoms such as:\n\nStomach pains.\n\nHeadaches.\n\nPanic or anxiety, especially about going to work.\n\nFamily tension and stress.\n\nInability to concentrate.\n\nLow morale and productivity.\n\nHow can bullying affect the workplace?\n\nBack to top\n\nBullying affects the overall \"health\" of an organization. An \"unhealthy\" workplace can have many effects. In general, these effects include:\n\nIncreased absenteeism.\n\nIncreased turnover.\n\nIncreased stress.\n\nIncreased costs for employee assistance programs (EAPs), recruitment, etc.\n\nIncreased risk for incidents.\n\nDecreased productivity and motivation.\n\nDecreased morale.\n\nReduced corporate image and customer confidence.\n\nPoor customer service.\n\nAre there any laws addressing bullying in the workplace in Canada?\n\nBack to top\n\nMany jurisdictions have defined bullying separately or have included bullying as part of the definition of behaviours associated with harassment or violence. For example, Prince Edward Island has defined harassment in their Workplace Harassment Regulations as:\n\n(b) \"harassment\" means any inappropriate conduct, comment, display, action or gesture or any bullying that the person responsible for the conduct, comment, display, action or gesture or the bullying knows, or ought reasonably to know, could have a harmful effect on a worker's psychological or physical health or safety, and includes\n\n(i) conduct that is based on any personal characteristic such as, but not limited to, race, creed, religion, colour, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability, physical size or weight, age, nationality, ancestry or place of origin, gender identity or pregnancy, and\n\n(ii) inappropriate sexual conduct that is known, or ought reasonably to be known, to the person responsible for the conduct to be unwelcome, including, but not limited to, sexual solicitations or advances, sexually suggestive remarks, jokes or gestures, circulating or sharing inappropriate images, or unwanted physical contact.\n\nOther resources include in British Columbia, WorkSafeBC has developed policies and resources related specifically to workplace bullying and harassment. The Treasury Board of Canada has published “People to People Communication – Preventing and Resolving Harassment for a Healthy Workplace”.\n\nIf there is no legislation which specifically addressed bullying, the general duty clause to provide a safe and healthy workplace establishes the duty of employers to protect employees from risks at work. These risks can include harm from both physical and psychological health aspects.\n\nIn addition, federal and provincial human right laws prohibit harassment related to race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, marital status, family status, disability, pardoned conviction, or sexual orientation. In certain situations, these laws may apply to bullying.\n\nWhat can you do if you think you are being bullied?\n\nBack to top\n\nIf you feel that you are being bullied, discriminated against, victimized or subjected to any form of harassment:\n\nDO\n\nFirmly tell the person that his or her behaviour is not acceptable and ask them to stop. You can ask a person you trust, such as supervisor or union member to be with you when you approach the person.\n\nKeep a factual journal or diary of events. Record:\n\nThe date, time and what happened in as much detail as possible.\n\nThe names of witnesses.\n\nThe outcome of the event.\n\nRemember, it is not just the character of the incidents, but intent of the behaviour and the number, frequency, and especially the pattern that can reveal the bullying or harassment.\n\nKeep copies of any letters, memos, e-mails, etc., received from the person.\n\nReport the bullying or harassment to the person identified in your workplace policy, your supervisor, or a delegated manager. If your concerns are minimized, proceed to the next level of management.\n\nDO NOT\n\nDo not retaliate. You may end up looking like the perpetrator and will most certainly cause confusion for those responsible for evaluating and responding to the situation.\n\n(Adapted from: Violence in the Workplace Prevention Guide. CCOHS)\n\nWhat can an employer do?\n\nBack to top\n\nThe most important component of any workplace prevention program is management commitment. Management commitment is best communicated in a written policy. Since bullying is a form of violence and harassment in the workplace, employers may wish to write a comprehensive policy that covers a range of incidents (from bullying and harassment to physical violence).\n\nA workplace violence and harassment prevention program should:\n\nBe developed by management and employee representatives.\n\nApply to management, employee's, clients, independent contractors and anyone who has a relationship with your company.\n\nDefine what you mean by workplace bullying (and harassment and violence) in precise, concrete language.\n\nProvide clear examples of unacceptable behaviour and working conditions.\n\nState in clear terms your organization's view toward workplace bullying and its commitment to the prevention of workplace bullying.\n\nPrecisely state the consequences of making threats or committing acts.\n\nOutline the process by which preventive measures will be developed and implemented.\n\nEncourage reporting of all incidents of bullying or other forms of workplace harassment and violence.\n\nOutline the confidential process by which employees, including witnesses, can report incidents and to whom.\n\nAssure no reprisals will be made against employees who choose to report their experiences.\n\nOutline the procedures for investigating and resolving complaints.\n\nMaintain confidentiality during the resolution process.\n\nDescribe how information about potential risks of bullying and violence will be communicated to employees.\n\nMake a commitment to provide support services to victims.\n\nOffer a confidential Employee Assistance Program (EAP) to allow employees with personal problems to seek help.\n\nMake a commitment to fulfill the prevention training needs of different levels of personnel within the organization.\n\nMake a commitment to monitor and regularly review the policy.\n\nState applicable regulatory requirements, where possible.\n\n(Adapted from: Violence in the Workplace Prevention Guide. CCOHS)\n\nWhat are some general tips for the workplace?\n\nBack to top\n\nDO\n\nEncourage everyone at the workplace to act towards others in a respectful and professional manner.\n\nHave a workplace policy in place that includes a reporting system.\n\nEducate everyone that bullying is a serious matter.\n\nTry to work out solutions before the situation gets serious or \"out of control\".\n\nEducate everyone about what is considered bullying, and whom they can go to for help.\n\nTreat all complaints seriously, and deal with complaints promptly and confidentially.\n\nTrain supervisors and managers in how to deal with complaints and potential situations. Encourage them to address situations promptly whether or not a formal complaint has been filed.\n\nHave an impartial third party help with the resolution, if necessary.\n\nDO NOT\n\nDo not ignore any potential problems.\n\nDo not delay resolution. Act as soon as possible.\n\n(Adapted from: Comprehensive Workplace Health Program Guide. CCOHS)\n\nFact sheet last revised: 2020-12-22"
