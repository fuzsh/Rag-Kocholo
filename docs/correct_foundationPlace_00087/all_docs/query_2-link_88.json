Maiura from Davidson, North Carolina. Congrats, Timothy!\n\nTwo-Factor Authentication (2FA) Now Required\n\nEffective June 2023, your NC 529 Account now requires two-factor authentication (2FA) in order to log in. 2FA is an enhanced security measure that requires you to use two different authentication methods, such as a password and a one-time security code, to access your Account. With 2FA, even if someone else has your password, they will not be able to access your Account without the one-time security code.\n\nIf you would like to change your 2FA method, you can use this Quick Reference Guide.\n\nHave you heard about our new gifting links?\n\nJust login to your NC 529 account and activate your personalized gifting link: an easy way to crowdfund your education savings. Your friends and family can now contribute directly to your account using credit cards, debit cards, bank transfers, Google Pay, and Apple Pay! Tell Me More!\n\nWhat is the NC 529 Plan?\n\nThe NC 529 Plan is a tax-advantaged saving and investment program that allows users to prepare for education expenses including college expenses and K-12 tuition. NC 529 Accounts can be used to save for your child, your grandchild, yourself, or any other future student. Contributions to an NC 529 Account and earnings thereon can be used for a myriad of Qualified Education Expenses!\n\nWhy Use an NC 529 Account?"
