Bob McMullan, a former Labor minister in the Paul Keating Government, is replacing Alaric McAusland as Ausfilmâ€™s chair despite not being a member of Ausfilm and being based in London.

That said, as a former arts minister, he has a very good understanding of the commercial and cultural value of film and television production and, as a former minister of trade, he is familiar with the challenges of succeeding in international markets. After many years in politics he also has formidable contacts.

McMullan recently retired from politics and now works as executive director to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, representing Australia, Korea, New Zealand and Egypt.

He is also an Adjunct Professor for the Crawford School of Public Policy in the Australian National University.

He takes up the new role on July 1.

The news was announced overnight during Ausfilm Week London, which is designed to develop co-production opportunities between Australian and UK producers and ends today.
