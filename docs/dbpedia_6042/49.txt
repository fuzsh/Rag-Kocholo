The Department of Arts Administration, Education and Policy prepares educators and policymakers in the areas of art education, arts policy and administration. The department’s legacy is built on the distinction of its programs; the research, teaching and service accomplishments of world-class faculty; and the diversity and aptitude of students and alumni.

“We represent a diverse community of scholars who share an unwavering commitment to the arts, challenging societal norms, disrupting traditional narratives, embracing creativity and innovation, thinking critically about and engaging with the world through the arts and ultimately engaging in rigorous teaching and scholarship about the arts and society.”
