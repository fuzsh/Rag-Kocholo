Industries with the highest levels of employment in office and administrative support occupations are local government, excluding schools and hospitals; credit intermediation and related activities; offices of physicians; general medical and surgical hospitals; the postal service (federal government); and business support services. An associate degree or certificate is typically required for these occupations. Advancement to executive level secretary or administrative assistant is typically through several years of related work experience. Additional training for industry-specific terminology may be required for legal and medical positions.2\n\n1 California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office.
