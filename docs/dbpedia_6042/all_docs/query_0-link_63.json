During this time, the thesis work he conducted with Dr. Sandra Turchi set him on a course for a career in academia dedicated to scholarly research. Stains continued his studies at the University of Arizona where his PhD work in chemistry was conducted under the guidance of Indraneel Ghosh. At the University of Arizona, his work with Carl S. Marvel was recognized with the most outstanding chemistry graduate student award. He was a NIH Ruth L. Kirschstein Postdoctoral Fellow at MIT with Professor Barbara Imperiali in 2011, where he began learning ways to design cellular therapies that can target specific aspects of a person’s biology without affecting other necessary functions. His independent career began as a professor in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln from 2011 to 2019. During this time, he published an impressive 32 papers and was awarded more than $2 million in funding.\n\nIn summer 2019 his lab moved to the Department of Chemistry at the University of Virginia, where Stains became an associate professor of chemistry. As a chemical biologist, he has continued to build upon his interest in cell-signaling, or the communication within and between cells. Stains’ approach to understanding cell signaling at the molecular level is cutting-edge scientific discovery and has already made real world implications on the development of treatments for diseases such as cancer and diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease, ALS, and Alzheimer’s.\n\nStains and his lab have designed completely new cellular communication components to better understand how these systems function and their role in human disease, redesigned proteins to understand signaling pathways in diseases, and developed new ways to accurately detect very small levels of a variety of signaling molecules in living cells; including a method that aims to detect early signs of Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, which both possess proteins that are so small that they are currently only detectable posthumously. Stains’ work has significantly contributed to the understanding of cellular communication and ultimately the fundamental processes that lead to human disease. His research is extensive and impactful, and he has received funding from the National Institutes of Health, the Michael J. Fox Foundation, and the Elsa U. Pardee Foundation.\n\nBeyond his own research, Stains has served as an advisor and mentor to countless undergraduate and post-graduate students and conducted outreach to provide high school students with access to STEM education.\n\n2019 YOUNG ALUMNI ACHIEVEMENT AWARD RECIPIENT - Nikanor I.
