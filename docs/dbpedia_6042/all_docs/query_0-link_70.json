        "text": "Part One: Denial\n\nChapter i. A Proud History\n\nEDWARD GARVEY, Engineer, Exxon Research & Engineering, 1978-83:\n\nIn 1978, my wife and I was just engaged six months prior. So we were going to get married a year after I graduated from college. I was kind of awkward, a little bit reserved. I was definitely a nerd. I mean, I grew up in a blue-collar area in Queens.\n\nEDWARD GARVEY:\n\nI went to Cooper Union, and Cooper Union was very well known. Not to toot my own horn, but you had to be pretty good to get in. So we were a draw for Exxon.\n\nEDWARD GARVEY:\n\nExxon had a recruiting program. They would go to colleges all around the country, and every year they would take the best graduates from my school. And so when Exxon offered me a position in their research division, and doing environmental monitoring, for me it was a really good fit.\n\nThe salary I got offered was about $18,600, which in those days was a lot of money for somebody fresh out of school.\n\nRICHARD WERTHAMER, Manager, Exxon Research & Engineering, 1979-82:\n\nExxon was not just the largest oil and gas company in existence, it was the largest company, period, in existence. It did business all over the world. It was enormous. And the resources were gigantic. And it had a very good reputation.\n\nAt the time I joined it, they had a company making word processors, fax machines. There was a new division of the company, Exxon Nuclear. And they had Exxon Solar.\n\nEDWARD GARVEY:\n\nExxon wanted to become an energy company. They were flush with funds—the oil business was doing really well in the '70s, and so they wanted to move into other fields related to energy.\n\nThe energy projects that they were doing were very well funded. Each one of them would have teams of five to 10 scientists, and then technicians supporting them.\n\nSo the project that I ultimately ended up working for them on was really blue sky. They weren't going to make any money on it, it was just research for the sake of doing research. For somebody who was 22 or 23 years old, I was like, wow, am I really happy here. This is a really great place to be working. I was really happy working for Exxon.\n\nMARTIN HOFFERT, Professor Emeritus, NYU:\n\nBack in the mid-'70s, I was working for NASA. It was a very exciting time because NASA was sending probes all over the solar system. And the information that was coming back was very interesting, things that we never knew. For example, we found out that Venus was very hot—it’s at least 700 degrees there—and the most plausible explanation, it came from the composition of Venus’ atmosphere: Venus is almost 100% carbon dioxide.\n\nIt was a kind of unified idea in the terrestrial planets of our solar system that greenhouse gas warming was caused by high concentrations of carbon dioxide. At the same time, some research scientists were making observations of carbon dioxide in our own atmosphere. And we have seen this curve of increasing carbon dioxide—it's become a classic icon of the carbon dioxide problem—where CO2 keeps going up and up a few parts per million every year. And we can attribute that to greenhouse gases, primarily fossil fuel burning.\n\nIt was a small group, maybe 20 or 30, who were developing models independently and checking each other. All of the models showed that the average temperature of the Earth was going to warm. The things that we didn't know were details. We didn’t know exactly where that was going to happen and how it was going to happen.\n\nThe question came up, \"What are we going to do?\" Over 85% of our energy was generated by fossil fuels. And about that time is when I had the opportunity to work as a consultant with the biggest company in the world at the time, Exxon.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nToday, the evidence of climate change is everywhere. FRONTLINE has been investigating the role of the fossil fuel industry and one of its biggest players, Exxon, in delaying and preventing action on climate change over the past four decades.\n\nThis film is based on over 100 interviews and thousands of documents, many of them newly uncovered.\n\nIt’s a story that begins with a small team of scientists inside Exxon.\n\nEDWARD GARVEY:\n\nThis is a presentation entitled, “The Proposed Exxon Research Program to Help Assess the Greenhouse Effect.” It’s presented by Edward A. Garvey, myself, Henry Shaw, Wally Broecker and Taro Takahashi at Columbia University.\n\nExxon wanted to do research related to climate change. But they wanted it to be recognized as something that Exxon could contribute that was unlikely anybody else could do. And the role of the ocean in the global balance of carbon dioxide was not well understood. And so Exxon saw an opportunity, using an oil tanker, to involve itself in that line of research and make a really significant contribution to the understanding of the global cycle of carbon dioxide.\n\n[Reading] “Program Goal: Use Exxon expertise and facilities to help determine the likelihood of a global greenhouse effect. March 26, 1979.”\n\nI wasn't dying to go to sea. I was a city kid, I wasn’t a sailor. But I think I understood from the very beginning that the oil tanker was going to be my baby, so to speak. I was going make it work.\n\n[Reading] “Rationale for Exxon Involvement: Develop expertise to assess the possible impact of the greenhouse effect on Exxon business. Form responsible team that can credibly carry bad news, if any, to the corporation.”\n\nThe work that we were doing the company was interested in at the highest levels. They wanted the knowledge.\n\nMARTIN HOFFERT:\n\nWe wrote computer programs. We plotted graphs. We analyzed the results. We compared it with data, with what nature was doing. And we would compare our results with others’ results. We would see if there's a consensus. Those papers would then get presented at meetings with the government, people from industry, people from university. And there would sort of be this sort of brick-by-brick advance in our understanding of how the system worked.\n\nEverything that we studied was basically consistent with the finding that the Earth was going to warm significantly. And we just were trying to say how it would warm.\n\nI can only speak about the research group in Exxon Research & Engineering. Everybody there accepted it. Roger Cohen completely accepted it.\n\nRoger Cohen, who was the manager of the group that I was consulting for, passed a lot of our results on to higher levels of management. Because that’s what this is—he’s writing to his boss about what the guys working for him are doing.\n\n[Reading] “There's unanimous agreement in the scientific community that temperature increase at this magnitude would bring about significant changes in the Earth's climate, including rainfall distribution and alterations in the biosphere; that our results are in accord with those of most researchers in the field and are subject to the same uncertainties.”\n\nEDWARD GARVEY:\n\nThere was no separation between Exxon's understanding and that of academia. None. Yeah, there were uncertainties. But the uncertainty was, \"When?\" \"How fast?\"\n\nThat’s what we were looking at. If we didn't reduce fossil fuel consumption in a significant fashion, we were going to be facing significant climate change in the future.\n\nMARTIN HOFFERT:\n\nAnd here he's saying that we should keep doing the research because it can inform our decisions.\n\n[Reading] “Our ethical responsibility is to permit the publication of our research in the scientific literature; indeed, to do otherwise would be a breach of Exxon's public position and ethical credo on honesty and integrity.”\n\nEDWARD GARVEY:\n\nWithin the Exxon Research & Engineering Company, at least, we knew that changes were going to be necessary. But I think Exxon was afraid we would change too fast. You just can't shut off the fossil fuels, because all of society depends on it.\n\nI was convinced that Exxon was doing this research to understand it, to get a place at the table, to be part of the solution, not so that we can deny the problem.\n\nCalifornia, 2018\n\nAustin, Texas\n\nExxon Mobil Historical Archives\n\nKERT DAVIES, Director, Climate Investigations Center:\n\nSometime in the 2000s Exxon give their archives to the library at the University of Texas. Many truckloads of documents. Perhaps it was a PR effort to show that this company has a proud history, and it's all transparent; it's all in the library. And so it was a revelation when journalists uncovered documents showing how deep the conversation was about climate change within Exxon.\n\nNEELA BANERJEE, Inside Climate News, 2015-20:\n\nWe came across letter after letter after letter to leaders of the company about carbon dioxide. And not only letters, but we came across a memo that said that if carbon dioxide concentrations continue to grow at this rate, this could be catastrophic. That was the word he used.\n\nAnybody who covered climate knew that Exxon had played a critical role in developing and funding a narrative of climate denial that began in the 1990s. So the fact that Exxon had been doing rigorous peer-reviewed research in the '80s was staggering to me.\n\nKERT DAVIES:\n\nI’ve become a curator of documents. The evidence from the Exxon documents is that there was a cadre of really smart scientists putting Exxon in a position of authority on the science of climate change.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nGasoline and fuel oil prices fell 2% last month, the third consecutive monthly decline in the price of gasoline.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nThat set the stock market skidding into its worst loss in three months, and the fallout continued as the week progressed.\n\nRICHARD WERTHAMER:\n\nNow we’re in 1982. And in 1982, oil prices dropped.\n\nEDWARD GARVEY:\n\nThe bottom fell out of the oil market, and so Exxon was having a hard time staying profitable. And it began layoffs.\n\nRICHARD WERTHAMER:\n\nOne of the things that was dropped overboard was the tanker project.\n\nEDWARD GARVEY:\n\nBasically just said, the market’s too poor, we no longer can afford this level of research. We’re going to keep the modeling team together and shut down the tanker project.\n\nRICHARD WERTHAMER:\n\nAnd by 1984, Lee Raymond was senior vice president with broad oversight for Exxon Research & Engineering. Raymond believed Exxon would always be an oil and gas company. It would never be anything else.\n\nEDWARD GARVEY:\n\nWhen Exxon retrenched and sold off its research in lithium batteries, sold off its solar energy, it’s like, you're throwing out the baby with the bathwater. These are all important lines of research for the potential for the company, and you're just getting rid of them. You're not trying to shrink them down, say, \"OK, we have to make do with a smaller budget.\" No, this is gone. We're done with this, we're done with this, we're done with that.\n\nLee Raymond\n\nInterviewed in 2005\n\nCHARLIE ROSE:\n\nAlternative fuels. There was a time in the late '70s that your company, you spent a lot of money at that time to say—\n\nLEE RAYMOND:\n\nYes, we did.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE:\n\n—is there an alternative fuel that will work so that we don't have to burn fossil fuels and put all that CO2 in the oxygen, in the air.\n\nLEE RAYMOND:\n\nWe were the first oil company that really spent a lot of money looking at all that.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE:\n\nAnd the results were what?\n\nLEE RAYMOND:\n\nNone of these technologies—and we looked at everything, I mean, we looked from soup to nuts—that none of these technologies were going to be competitive against oil. The conclusion we came to, Charlie, was that fossil fuels had such an economic—first of all, such an economic advantage, and secondly, such a relatively ease of use that it was going to be very difficult to displace them.\n\nEDWARD GARVEY:\n\nI didn't stay there that much longer after they shut down the tanker project. I know that Exxon did some really good climate-related modeling work and was still funding research at Columbia University, but effectively they turned the corner, and I just—I knew that the place that I worked in was gone. I was heartbroken.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nExxon Mobil declined to give us any interviews. In a written response to questions, the company said, \"For more than 40 years, we have supported development of climate science in partnership with governments and academic institutions\" and \"Exxon Mobil has never had any unique or superior knowledge about climate science, let alone any that was unavailable to policymakers or the public.\"\n\nBENJAMIN FRANTA, Climate historian and activist:\n\nI didn’t learn about climate change until I was in graduate school. These are documents from the '80s, the '70s, talking about climate change, and to only learn about it in 2010 shows that knowledge doesn't necessarily go in a unidirectional fashion. That we lose knowledge, we forget things all the time, both as individuals and as a society.\n\nThere are many people working on this now and we’re getting a better and better understanding all the time. We now know that Shell, for example, had a sophisticated understanding of the climate issue also by the end of the 1980s. The coal industry, too. So there is a level of foreknowledge by the fossil fuel industry that business as usual would lead to disaster around the world.\n\nPRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN:\n\nMy fellow Americans, with summer coming, a lot of Americans will be driving more than ever, in everything from vans to buses to motorbikes. This is a good time for it, because gas prices continue to fall.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nCorporate profits surged in the first quarter. Individual winners were Ford, Exxon, General Motors, IBM, Bell South and AT&T.\n\nFEMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nRetail sales jumped, reflecting a surge in demand for new cars.\n\nTOYOTA TV ADVERTISEMENT:\n\nWe hope to sell thousands more with Sellathon 3! Starlets, Corollas—\n\nFEMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nBoeing aircraft company unveiled their new 67 jetliner.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nSharp fare reductions by American Airlines underlie—\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nIt may turn out it to be a major turning point in the history of airline pricing.\n\nMALE REPORTER:\n\nWho is making the excess buck here?\n\nMALE VOICE:\n\nPrimarily U.S. refiners of petroleum products. Most of these companies have announced huge increases in their refinery profits over the last nine months.\n\nBENJAMIN FRANTA:\n\nExxon had an idea of how soon governments would start to act about global warming. The company predicted that policy action would occur around the late 1980s, which it did. So this is really when a huge battle began.\n\n1988\n\nChapter ii. Emphasize the Uncertainty\n\nDAVID HARWOOD, Aide to Sen. Wirth, 1986-93:\n\n1988 was the year that the issue of climate change moved from scientific journals into the realm of public policy.\n\nI was a 26-year-old on the lower end of the totem pole in a Senate office. And Sen. Wirth said, \"You want to work on the environment, because that’s where all the action’s going to be.\"\n\nSEN. TIMOTHY WIRTH, D-Colorado, 1987-93:\n\n[Archive] Our climate is changing very dramatically, and it's time for us to start acting on it.\n\nWe identified early on how important this was and were probably one of the first to bang away at it.\n\nDAVID HARWOOD:\n\nSen. Wirth said, \"I want to write a piece of legislation that addresses global warming.\"\n\nThe first person I reached out to was Dr. Hansen, a distinguished senior scientist at NASA.\n\nJAMES HANSEN, Dir., NASA Goddard Institute, 1981-2013:\n\nA lot had changed between the middle 1970s, when we first got interested in the problem, and the 1980s, the late 1980s. Because the real world was beginning to show signs that humans were affecting climate. That implies that we’re really going to get a significant change a few decades downstream.\n\nDAVID HARWOOD:\n\nMy response was pretty immediate. \"This is a big deal. We need to get working on a hearing.\"\n\nFebruary 1988\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nSeattle and other parts of the Northwest had their driest February in history. Irrigation reservoirs are 40-85% below normal levels.\n\nMarch 1988\n\nDAVID HARWOOD:\n\nBy the spring of 1988, there was a full-scale drought.\n\nApril 1988\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nThe earliest fire season in memory has been declared.\n\nJune 1988\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nThey're dredging around the clock on the once-mighty, now-shrunken Mississippi to free hundreds of barges.\n\nDAVID HARWOOD:\n\nIt was my perception that the media wanted to explain this drought and seemed to be at a tipping point on the issue of climate change.\n\nJAMES HANSEN:\n\nThe evening before, I was lying on my bed in a hotel in Washington writing my testimony and listening to the Yankees baseball game. And I wrote my testimony out by hand. I do think that scientists have a moral obligation to point out the implications of their findings and try to do it as clearly as possible.\n\nDAVID HARWOOD:\n\nI had a sense that it was going to be a good hearing, and that his statement would be important. And you could feel it in the room, that this was a significant moment.\n\nJAMES HANSEN:\n\n[Archive] Thank you for the opportunity to present the results of my research on the greenhouse effect, which has been carried out with my colleagues at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. I would like to draw three main conclusions. Number one, the Earth is warmer in 1988 than at any time in the history of instrumental measurements. Number two, the global warming is now large enough that we can ascribe, with a high degree of confidence, a cause-and-effect relationship to the greenhouse effect. And number three, our computer climate simulations indicate that the greenhouse effect is already large enough to begin to affect the probability of extreme events such as summer heat waves. Altogether, this evidence represents a very strong case, in my opinion, that the greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now.\n\nTIMOTHY WIRTH:\n\nThat was a kind of a magic sentence. This was not environmental groups. This was not some green cabal. This was a probably the lead climate scientist in the federal government making this statement.\n\nJAMES HANSEN:\n\nI realized I was going out on a limb. Not all scientists agreed with me that we were ready to say those things. But they were based on sound physics and observations and models.\n\nDAVID HARWOOD:\n\nIt was as if the rocket had lifted off. I wrote on the hearing transcript, \"historic.\"\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nSome experts are saying now that the whole world is heating up because of a global greenhouse effect.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nAnd in the long run that could mean devastating changes to all life on Earth.\n\nDAVID HARWOOD:\n\nBy the next morning, the story was on the front page of The New York Times.\n\nMALE REPORTER:\n\nThere are no easy solutions. We’re talking here about the use of gas and coal and oil.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nScientists urge heavy conservation, a switch to solar energy and a search for new power sources. Pragmatists would argue that we cannot change our energy habits overnight. Scientists say we had better get going.\n\nSEN. AL GORE, D-Tennessee, 1985-1993:\n\nIn those years there was still a spirit of bipartisanship. When really important challenges to the public interest appeared, you could work across the political aisle.\n\nDAVID HARWOOD:\n\nI felt like tremendous progress was being made. There was greater awareness. There was public policy emerging. There was international negotiations developing.\n\nTIMOTHY WIRTH:\n\nMomentum is on our side. And it kind of opened up the world, the feeling of \"Wow, this is really going to change.\" But the minute targets and timetables began to appear, those were magic signals to the industry. \"Uh-oh, this is serious.\" Little did we know how devastating the counterattack was going to be.\n\nTERRY YOSIE, SVP, E. Bruce Harrison PR firm, 1992-1997 :\n\nI've collected documents from every place where I've worked. My basement looks like a trash bin and a fire hazard. But nevertheless!\n\nI knew that having access to original documents, that were, in my view critical to certain decisions being made would be enormously valuable.\n\n[Archive] I’m Terry Yosie, vice president for health and environment at the American Petroleum Institute. I want to thank you—\n\nAPI at that time was tremendously influential. It was the chief lobbying organization for the petroleum industry and had representation from some of the major oil companies—Exxon, Mobil, Chevron, Shell, BP. Companies like that.\n\nBy early 1989, the newspapers, the television networks were bombarding API with questions such as, \"What do you think of Hansen's testimony?\" \"What is your view of climate change in general?\" \"What do you think needs to be done about climate change?\" \"Terry, what do you make of all of this?\"\n\nThe decision was made that a briefing needed to be prepared for industry CEOs.\n\n[Reading] “Global Warming: The Knowns and Unknowns. By Terry F. Yosie, American Petroleum Institute.\"\n\n[Reading] “There is scientific consensus that the atmosphere is changing due to human activities. There are three schools of thought that characterize the scientific and public debate over global warming. The first is that a crisis exists and that immediate measures are needed to ameliorate it through strong government actions. The second school of thought is that the problem will go away by itself. The third school of thought, and one that reflects API's present thinking, was expressed by a scientist named Patrick Michaels in a recent article in The Washington Post. ‘Our policies,’ noted Michaels, ‘should be no more drastic than the scientific conclusions they are based upon.’\"\n\nPROF. PATRICK MICHAELS, Univ. of Virginia, 1980-2007:\n\nI’m not—I hate this word—I'm not a denier. I'm a lukewarmer. Totally different. And people get that wrong. The lukewarm view on climate change, which means climate change is real, people have something to do with it, but it's probably not the end of the world. I'm probably a lukewarm libertarian, too.\n\n[Archive] There is a real problem with this so-called global warming apocalypse projection. The Earth may in fact be going in the other direction, and until we solve that, it seems to me that we ought not take any very expensive remuneration.\n\nTERRY YOSIE:\n\nPat Michaels was not a major voice in the scientific community on climate change. But I think he was primarily useful to the industry as an external voice of doubt creating more skepticism about policymakers taking action.\n\n[Reading] “In that vein, API must become an active participant in the scientific and policy debate. We are well on our way to doing that. We must make policymakers fully aware of the uncertainty surrounding the global warming issue.”\n\nKERT DAVIES:\n\nIt's amazing. I mean, it's a call to action. They're realizing it's going down, we need to be in the room talking about uncertainty and downplaying the urgency, effectively. That that is the call.\n\nJANE McMULLEN, FRONTLINE producer/director:\n\nCan I ask you to take a look at the document in front of you?\n\nKERT DAVIES:\n\nThis thing?\n\nJANE McMULLEN:\n\nYeah, which we found in the Exxon archives.\n\nKERT DAVIES:\n\nThis says it all right here. This paragraph starts, \"Exxon’s long-term public presence and contributions to the scientific field give us unique credibility within the petroleum industry. We served on a task force of the American Petroleum Institute and contributed significantly to the development of the API position on climate change.”\n\nSo essentially what we see as the API position is the Exxon position on climate change.\n\n[Reading] \"Our advice and input influenced the positions of NAM—the National Association of Manufacturers—CMA—the Chemical Manufacturers Association—and the Global Change Coalition,\" which is probably the Global Climate Coalition.\n\nThese trade associations are key. They are working with other shields and other umbrellas. Their focus is trying to emphasize uncertainty. And we can show that they pretty much did that in following years.\n\nNARRATION:\n\nIn response to questions, API said critics were \"cherry-picking information from decades ago to support a misleading predetermined narrative,\" and that as climate science has evolved, so has the industry.\n\nExxon Mobil has denied that its policy at that time was to emphasize uncertainty.\n\n1992\n\nChapter iii. The Environmental Presidency\n\nGOV. BILL CLINTON, Arkansas, 1983-1992:\n\nThe man standing beside me today has what it takes to lead this nation from the day we take office. Sen. Al Gore of Tennessee.\n\nMARC CHUPKA, White House economist, 1993-94:\n\nWhen Bill Clinton announced that his running mate was going to be Al Gore, that was very exciting.\n\nThere was an anticipation of a much greater effort to tackle climate change.\n\nBILL CLINTON:\n\nWe will finally give the United States a real environmental presidency.\n\nAL GORE:\n\nThen President-elect Clinton understood clearly that that's why I was on the ticket. That's why I agreed to run as vice president.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nHe has won this presidential race, along with Sen. Al Gore, now the vice president-elect.\n\nJANE McMULLEN:\n\nNow you’re in the White House—\n\nAL GORE:\n\nYeah.\n\nJANE McMULLEN:\n\n—to tackle it. Did you feel a sense of responsibility?\n\nAL GORE:\n\nOh, absolutely. That was the principal task that I set for myself entering the White House. And I went to work right away to try to get a carbon tax in our first budget plan.\n\nMARC CHUPKA:\n\nSen. Gore asked me to produce some quantitative results of how much various energy taxes would reduce emissions.\n\nFeb. 17, 1993\n\nPRESIDENT BILL CLINTON:\n\nOur plan does include a broad-based tax on energy, and it is environmentally responsible. It will help us in the future as well as in the present with the deficit.\n\nMARC CHUPKA:\n\nI was excited that a fairly bold step had been proposed.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nIt’s called a \"BTU tax.\"\n\nFEMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nThe tax is likely to be levied at the producer or distributor level, though consumers would feel it as energy companies passed it along in their prices.\n\nMARC CHUPKA:\n\nIt’s a tax policy. You don’t expect everyone to love it. But the opposition to this particular proposal was very strong, very strident, very aggressive.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nKoch Industries has been called the biggest company you never heard of. The sprawling giant includes pipelines, petrochemicals, asphalt plants, trading floors. Based in Wichita, Kansas, it sells everything from gasoline to beef.\n\nJEFF NESBIT, Comms. Dir., Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1993:\n\nI would say that virtually no one in the early 1990s had ever heard of Koch Industries.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nKoch's core business is distribution. It owns 37,000 miles of international pipeline.\n\nJEFF NESBIT:\n\nThey can take the heaviest oil, the dirtiest oil, the hardest to turn into a useful product and refine it. And they became the best in the world at doing that. I think it's still probably the second-largest privately held company in the world.\n\nThe two brothers who ran Koch Industries were Charles and David Koch. They had their sights set on how they were going to deal with issues that were existential to their industry. It's the heart of what they do, so they're going to fight and hang on to that till the bitter end.\n\nJERRY TAYLOR, Cato Institute, 1991-2014:\n\nThe Cato Institute was a public policy think tank. It was founded by Charles Koch. And Charles was heavily invested in energy policy discussions back in that time, particularly the emergence of climate change.\n\nThe Cato Institute position was that climate change is real, but the climate change that we're seeing today is far, far more modest than what the computer models say we should have seen by now. We need to know a lot more before we should be spending trillions of dollars to address it.\n\nJEFF NESBIT:\n\nSo the Kochs had funding directed at the Cato Institute as a libertarian think tank; they also had funding that went to Citizens for a Sound Economy, which was built for a slightly different purpose, which was to be a quote, grassroots mobilizer.\n\nJERRY TAYLOR:\n\nComing out of the gate, we then get served up with a proposed BTU tax. It was obvious to us at the Cato Institute that once that tax is in place, it's going to be very hard to get rid of.\n\nJEFF NESBIT:\n\nWe walked over from Citizens for a Sound Economy over to the American Petroleum Institute, and we met with the entire leadership of API. And the meeting was all about, let's just knock out the BTU tax in its infancy.\n\nJERRY TAYLOR:\n\nWe would be meeting in various locales in Washington with over 100 people in the room. It was a real war room situation.\n\nJERRY JASINOWSKI, President of the National Association of Manufacturers :\n\n[Archive] This coalition is one of the fastest growing and strongest that I've seen. We will stop the BTU tax and I believe substitute spending cuts in its place. Thank you very much for coming.\n\nOklahoma\n\nRON HOWELL, Former consultant, Koch Industries:\n\nWe were known, and I think we made ourselves known that way, as the oil capital of the world. Almost everywhere you'd look had behind it oil industry dollars.\n\nI thought that the tax was a bad idea for America, but predominantly a bad idea for Oklahoma. Oklahoma was not in a good spot at that time at all. Oil wells were being shut. That meant a lot of lost jobs, a lot of lost companies. And this was putting the heel of the boot down hard.\n\nI got a call from Koch Industries telling me the industry is very concerned about this, but we're worried that this word isn't getting out. Our particular goal was to focus on Sen. Boren.\n\nJEFF NESBIT:\n\nDavid Boren was a moderate Democrat who chaired the relevant committee that would deal with the Clinton budget.\n\nRON HOWELL:\n\nWe were hearing that he wanted to be left to do his own revising of it behind closed doors.\n\nJEFF NESBIT:\n\nThey basically said if we can get David Boren to flip, we win. So they said, we're going to do whatever it takes.\n\nRON HOWELL:\n\nWe set about what I would call a grasstops and a grassroots campaign. The grassroots were encouraged to call Sen. Boren and let him know that you do not want a tax, after seeing an ad that showed \"take shower, pay a tax; start your car, pay a tax.\"\n\nJEFF NESBIT:\n\nEverybody was given their marching orders out of this playbook. People would stand up behind politicians with signs about no BTU tax. There were rallies.\n\nENERGY INDUSTRY SPOKESMAN:\n\n—cost to the average household in Oklahoma is going to be roughly about $500 a year.\n\nRON HOWELL:\n\nMy main role was what I would call the grasstops. You may be a civic leader, you may be a CEO. Often it would be Mr. Koch would call them, or myself, and talk them through \"Did you know it does this, this, this and this?\" Encourage strongly Sen. Boren kill it.\n\nJEFF NESBIT:\n\nWhat they told the public and what the policymakers were led to believe was that there was an army of folks who were ready to march in the streets. Maybe there were a handful of folks who thought, \"Oh, gosh, I should call my senator and register my complaint,\" but they had no such grassroots army. It was funded and fueled by the corporate interests.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nCSE says its work isn’t done yet. It’s joined forces with other lobbying groups, stoking the flames of the prairie fire, hoping they’ll spread and burn the BTU tax for good.\n\nRON HOWELL:\n\nI remember a very late night or early morning phone call, and it was actually Sen. Boren's communications guy. \"We want those ads to stop. And we want the CEOs to quit calling us, and in return, Sen. Boren’s going to announce his intentions to vote against it.\"\n\nSEN. DAVID BOREN, D-Oklahoma, 1979-94 :\n\nOur proposal is fairer than that put forward by the administration—that is the BTU tax, which is the tax which is a part of the administration's plan that does hit lower- and middle-income Americans.\n\nJEFF NESBIT:\n\nHe folded right away. It’s like wow, this can really work. We can pick our targets strategically and win, even when we’re not in political power.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nAt the time, David Boren disputed he was influenced by the oil industry. He said he was responding to concerns from the American public, and he opposed the tax because it would hurt consumers and businesspeople.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nPresident Clinton has pulled the plug on his proposed BTU energy tax.\n\nFEMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nCritics said it would cost jobs and devastate the economy, and there weren't enough votes in the Senate to pass it. Besides, who the heck knew what it was?\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nThis is after all a nation addicted to its cars and to the idea of driving down the open road.\n\nAL GORE:\n\nIt was extremely disappointing to not get the votes. It was just the raw power of all the money that they threw into this. But we just decided to regroup and try to skin the cat a different way.\n\nMARC CHUPKA:\n\nThey never proposed another energy tax. It was just considered radioactive.\n\nJEFF NESBIT:\n\nI think some of the leadership of the Koch network were really quite excited that it worked so well. So that's how that playbook first began. It was developed right then. What I didn’t know at the time was that it would become the beginning of something much bigger. And that playbook is still in use today.\n\nI don't feel embarrassed or regretful. In hindsight, I shouldn't have done that. There's no question I shouldn't have done that. But they were my client. I was a contractor. I was paid, I'm going to do my job. And my job was to do that.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nCharles Koch did not respond to questions about the campaign against the BTU tax. In 1994, a top Koch executive said, \"Our belief is that the tax, over time, may have destroyed our business.\"\n\nCentral China, 2021\n\nENERGY INDUSTRY PROMOTIONAL VIDEO:\n\nAs more and more scientists are confirming, our world is deficient in carbon dioxide and a doubling of atmospheric CO2 is very beneficial.\n\nDAVID HARWOOD:\n\nI was aware that this emerging industry of naysayers was growing, this effort to cast doubt. You had reams of material coming out of the government. They were at NOAA, at NASA, this expanding network of people working on this day in and day out, saying that this was a legitimate issue and that we needed to do something about it. And on the other hand, you had two or three guys who went around to conferences and said, \"Oh, I'm not sure. Oh, maybe there's clouds?\"\n\nProf. Patrick Michaels, 1992\n\nPATRICK MICHAELS:\n\nI would like to show you the warming that satellites sensed over the same region from 1979 to now, which is the next slide, if you could. Thanks. Nothing.\n\nDAVID HARWOOD:\n\nIt quickly became apparent that these were private interests who had a stake in the status quo.\n\nProf. Fred Singer, 1991\n\nFRED SINGER:\n\nA respectable body of opinion in the international scientific community believes that any climate warming is as likely to be beneficial as harmful.\n\nJOHN PASSACANTANDO, Founder, Ozone Action, 1992-2000:\n\nI remember seeing in the press this skeptic, Fred Singer, saying that global warming was not a problem for the planet. You saw that he had worked on tobacco and a number of other issues. He was sort of a specialist in denial. I thought, that’s odd. When I brought that up to some of my peers in the environmental movement, they really didn’t think it was that important.\n\nBut then every time a new piece of science comes out, the same story will have somebody you'd never heard of saying, \"No, that's completely wrong.\" So you start to think, well, who are these people, and where are they coming from? Oh, interesting. They're funded by Exxon’s foundation. And then you see this pattern repeated over and over and over. It was coming from the coal-fired power utilities, Western Fuels Association, the Koch brothers, Global Climate Coalition. And they’re funding climate deniers.\n\nJOHN SHLAES, Executive Director, Global Climate Coalition:\n\n[Archive] We are not an ad hoc group anymore, but as a matter of fact the Global Climate Coalition formalized not too long ago.\n\nTERRY YOSIE, SVP, E. Bruce Harrison PR firm, 1992-97:\n\nThe Global Climate Coalition consisted of every major manufacturing trade association that produced or consumed fossil fuels and every major company that was in the fossil fuels industry. And so it’s a considerable coalition of business interests.\n\nThe Global Climate Coalition put out a bid for a contractor to provide communication services. I had left API in the late spring and I had come over to the Harrison firm, a public relations firm devoted exclusively to environmental issues.\n\n[Reading] “Communication Proposal Prepared for the Global Climate Coalition by the E. Bruce Harrison Company.”\n\nI was asked to be a part of the pitch team because I was well known in the petroleum industry.\n\nDON RHEEM, E. Bruce Harrison PR firm, 1993-97:\n\nEverybody wanted to get the Global Climate Coalition account because it was a coalition of the biggest industries in America.\n\nI was brought in to handle press relations for the Global Climate Coalition. A lot of reporters were assigned to write stories, and they were struggling with the complexity of the issue. So I would write backgrounders so that reporters could read them and get up to speed.\n\nTERRY YOSIE:\n\n[Reading] “It is important for GCC to continue to emphasize the scientific uncertainty surrounding climate change.”\n\n[Reading] “Scientists, economists, academics and other noted experts carry greater credibility with the media and general public than industry representatives.”\n\n[Reading] “Communication efforts should be directed toward expanding the platform for third-party spokespersons.”\n\nThe idea behind a third party is that you form a relationship with somebody who already has some stature or standing around a particular topic, in this case climate change, and you recruit that person, you pay that person to give a speech or write an op-ed. The Global Climate Coalition would do the background work of placing that op-ed or maybe editing it.\n\nDON RHEEM:\n\nI met some really brilliant climatologists and meteorologists. I met Pat Michaels. He'd struck me as someone who was very smart. He loved talking about this issue.\n\nJANE McMULLEN:\n\nWhat was your relationship with the GCC? Global Climate Coalition?\n\nPATRICK MICHAELS:\n\nOh, God. Not much.\n\nJANE McMULLEN:\n\nYou were on their scientific advisory board.\n\nPATRICK MICHAELS:\n\nYeah. What does that mean? I don't think we ever had a meeting.\n\nJANE McMULLEN:\n\nI understand you did.\n\nPATRICK MICHAELS:\n\nWe did? It wasn't much of a relationship at all. I mean, when you bring up GCC, it's like, \"Oh, wait a minute, who were those guys?\"\n\nJANE McMULLEN:\n\nHow did the funding that you received from the fossil fuel industry impact what you were able to do work-wise and impact the views that you took?\n\nPATRICK MICHAELS:\n\nDidn't change what I do, didn't change the way I think.\n\nJANE McMULLEN:\n\nHow much do you think you did receive from industry?\n\nPATRICK MICHAELS:\n\nI don’t know.\n\nJANE McMULLEN:\n\nDo you feel like in a way you were sort of used by them, that you were—\n\nPATRICK MICHAELS:\n\nNo, I was using them. You got that wrong. What—I mean—I'm somewhat verbal, and I like to write, and I have an overestimation of my ability, my sense of humor. But can you imagine somebody giving you a little bit of money to say \"Write whatever you want every two weeks?\" We had a blast doing that. We weren't doing what we were told; we were doing what we wanted.\n\nJOHN PASSACANTANDO:\n\nThe Global Climate Coalition is seeding doubt everywhere, sort of fogging the air with these counterarguments that are contradictory and nonsensical. Running this propaganda across the country, putting millions of dollars into this media effort. And environmentalists really don't know what's hitting them.\n\nJANE McMULLEN:\n\nDid it cross your mind or give you any late-night worries that you were being paid by a group that had a vested interest in delaying action, blocking action, creating doubt in the minds of the public and policymakers?\n\nDON RHEEM:\n\nThe backgrounders I was writing, the narrative that I represented as the communications lead for the Global Climate Coalition was not a popular narrative. There's no question about that. Was there truth in all the materials? Yes, there was. There was a lot we didn't know at the time, and part of my role was to highlight what we didn't know. It wasn't just that we, that is the Global Climate Coalition, needed to come up with contrarian voices. The media needed them to have balance.\n\nJOHN PASSACANTANDO:\n\nYou want to make an assumption that it's a meritocracy. A good argument will prevail, and it will displace a bad argument. But what the geniuses of the PR firms who work for these big fossil fuel companies know is that truth has nothing to do with who wins the argument. If you say something enough times, people will begin to believe it.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nFinally tonight, some new word on the temperature of the world. Charlayne Hunter-Gault has that story.\n\nCHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT:\n\nIt's warmer than ever, and last year set a record. That's what British meteorologists reported—\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nThey say that 1995 was the warmest year since records first were kept in 1856.\n\nMALE SPEAKER:\n\nYou have ice slowly melting. You have sea levels rising. You have places like the Maldive Islands, that’s only a meter above sea level, that could be completely underwater.\n\nBENJAMIN SANTER, Lawrence Livermore Natl. Laboratory, 1992-2021:\n\nWe knew. We knew in '95 that humans were affecting the global climate. In 1990, the First Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC, concludes that it's too soon to tell definitively whether there is or is not a human-caused global warming signal. Five years later, a very, very different finding: People at different institutes, using different statistical methods, different models, formally identified a human-caused global warming signal. This was a paradigm shift in scientific understanding of the reality of human effects on climate.\n\nI was 40 years old. I had spent 1 1/2 years working as convening lead author for Chapter 8 of the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report, \"Detection of Climate Change and Attribution of Causes.\"\n\nWe were in plenary in the beautiful Palacio de Congresos de Madrid, delegates from nearly 100 countries. We're all there to discuss the language that was relevant to Chapter 8. Some of the industry scientists were involved in the process. Haroon Kheshgi from Exxon was there from the beginning of our work on Chapter 8 right through to the end.\n\nThe Global Climate Coalition and the Saudis and Kuwaitis dominated the plenary sessions, saying,\n\n\"If you say something's uncertain, then it can be overturned.\" Which led to all of these sometimes heated exchanges, because uncertainty is an irreducible part of climate science. The notion that uncertainties mean you can't say anything useful about anything is preposterous.\n\nThere were these extraordinary back-and-forth discussions. And my job was to implement those changes that we had discussed and agreed upon. I think the most critical part of the changes after Madrid was the deletion of the concluding summary.\n\nChapter 8 had a summary up front and a summary at the end. No other chapter had a summary at the end. Now the second summary discussed many of the uncertainties, essentially repeating much of the up-front summary. So some of the government comments that we received said, \"You need to delete the second summary.\" Which we did.\n\nThe bottom-line finding agreed upon by all countries present in Madrid was 12 words: quote, the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate, unquote.\n\nMadrid was a triumph of the science. The science won. It was a big deal.\n\nFEMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nHi, I’m Joie Chen. An international panel of scientists agrees we can blame ourselves for global warming.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\n—in Madrid, where 2,500 scientists from around the world have finally agreed with one another and are convinced that burning oil and coal is causing the world's temperature to rise, which may bring with it environmental disaster.\n\nCHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT:\n\nHow do you think this is going to affect policy action on this?\n\nMALE SPEAKER:\n\nIt's certainly ammunition for those that would like more government regulation of industry to move away from fossil fuels to other forms of energy.\n\nBENJAMIN SANTER:\n\nIn retrospect those 12 words were the handwriting on the wall.\n\nWhat happened next was that the Global Climate Coalition really came onto my radar screen. In the spring of 1996, they published this report, \"The IPCC: Institutionalized 'Scientific Cleansing.'\" They were arguing that I had purged all discussion of uncertainty from the document, which was patently untrue. Twenty percent of Chapter 8 was specifically devoted to the discussion of uncertainties.\n\n[Reading] \"The changes quite clearly have the obvious political purpose of cleansing the underlying scientific report of important information and scientific analysis that would lead policymakers and the public to be very cautious, if not skeptical, about blaming human activities for climate change over the past century.\"\n\nI had grandparents who were \"cleansed\" because of their religion in the Second World War. People were being cleansed because of their religion in Bosnia. And the Global Climate Coalition, through this odious \"scientific cleansing,\" was arguing that I was guilty of a crime.\n\n[Reading] \"These revisions raise very serious questions about whether the IPCC has compromised or even lost its scientific integrity.\"\n\nDON RHEEM:\n\nUm, I certainly had a, probably a role in the creation of this. There's a level of detail here I just, I don't remember. But what I do—I do remember the gist of this, where things were said at one point in the process and then they disappeared at the next, and that struck me as troubling. And so I noted that to the folks in the Coalition.\n\nBENJAMIN SANTER:\n\nThis stuff caught on like wildfire. Patrick Michaels devoted substantial time to amplifying the Global Climate Coalition’s allegations. Others picked up that report and repeated bits of it verbatim. Things became worse when Prof. Frederick Seitz wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal. I was accused of the worst abuse of the peer-reviewed system that Prof. Seitz had seen in his 60 years as a scientist. Folks were calling for my dismissal with dishonor from my position. A gentleman intimated that I was about to be indicted by the Hague International Court of Justice for quote, falsification of international scientific documents.\n\nJANE McMULLEN:\n\nThat document set in motion a number of public attacks on the lead scientist, the lead author of that chapter.\n\nDON RHEEM:\n\nOh.\n\nJANE McMULLEN:\n\nHe was particularly shaken by the accusation that he was guilty of scientific cleansing. He found that hard to take.\n\nDON RHEEM:\n\nYeah, that wouldn't have been terminology, by the way, that I would have used. How this was used and what others did with it was outside of my control and purview. And it troubles me to hear that this had such an impact on an individual. That's not something I would want to do to anybody.\n\nBENJAMIN SANTER:\n\nThis attack on individuals, on their integrity, decency, honesty, involved high personal cost, and the Global Climate Coalition knew what they were doing. Sow those seeds of doubt, and watch them grow and mature. And they did.\n\nKERT DAVIES:\n\nClearly, one of the GCC’s main missions was to blunt the scientific urgency driven by scientific reports.\n\nSimultaneously, there's an assessment done, written by a Mobil scientist within the GCC. So it says, \"Can human activities affect the climate?\" And the answer is, \"The scientific basis for the greenhouse effect and the potential impact of human emissions of greenhouse gases such as CO2 on the climate is well established and cannot be denied.\"\n\nWhat's really interesting about this document is the back six pages—and this is just a draft; this was never published as far as we know. [Reading] \"Several arguments have been put forward attempting to challenge the conventional view of greenhouse gas-induced climate change.\"\n\nPatrick Michaels is named as one of the people putting forward these arguments and concludes, \"They do not offer convincing arguments against the conventional model of greenhouse gas emission-induced climate change.\" So don’t use don’t use their voice!\n\nNEELA BANERJEE, Supervising Climate Editor, NPR:\n\nThe science was growing more certain, and Exxon's own scientists were working with scientists in academia to discern the human fingerprint on a changing climate.\n\nI'm looking at an article written by Lee Raymond, who was chairman of Exxon Corp., and it looks like this is from the mid-1990s. \"Global warming: who's right? Facts about a debate that's turned up more questions than answers.\"\n\nLee Raymond was certainly the person with the greatest stature in the oil industry to push for this narrative, that the science around climate change was uncertain and therefore we shouldn't act precipitously to address it.\n\nPROF. MARTIN HOFFERT, Exxon consultant, 1981-87:\n\nWhat's the date of this? My God. Is this '82? No, this says 1996. We—[laughs] I am just flabbergasted by this.\n\n[Reading] “The unproven theory [laughs]—This policy, if implemented, has ominous economic implications, yet scientific evidence remains inconclusive as to whether human activities affect global climate.”\n\nIt's just total baloney. This person should never be the CEO of an energy company. I think it's outrageous that he would say such a thing because he has a world-class climate and carbon cycle research group in his own laboratory in Exxon Research & Engineering. He could pick up the phone and ask one of the people in that group if that statement is true, and they would tell him that it isn't.\n\nHe's using something which is a lie to justify a policy which is bad for the world. And I would have to say that on an ethical basis, it's actually evil. I think he should be ashamed of himself. And I think he should apologize to the world for saying that.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nLee Raymond did not respond to interview requests.\n\nIn its statement to us, Exxon Mobil insisted that its \"public statements about climate change are, and have always been, truthful, fact-based, transparent and consistent with the contemporary understanding of mainstream climate science.\"\n\nUntil his retirement in 2005, Lee Raymond continued to publicly question the science of climate change.\n\nLee Raymond\n\nInterviewed in 2005\n\nLEE RAYMOND:\n\nThere is a natural variability that has nothing to do with man.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE:\n\nWhat would that be?\n\nLEE RAYMOND:\n\nThe climate has changed every year for millions of years. Now the question is, is part of what's happening related to something other than natural variability? And if so, how do you determine what that is? And the reality is, the science isn't there to make that determination.\n\nChapter iv. The Grand Fog\n\nMarch 17, 1995\n\nVICE PRESIDENT AL GORE, 1993-2001:\n\nTwo weeks from now, this issue of global climate change will be discussed by more than 120 different countries in Berlin. This administration will be at the forefront of this global effort.\n\nI wanted the United States of America to lead the world community to agree on a set of global initiatives and policies.\n\n[Archive] The United States is committed to reaching 1990-levels of greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2000. Let us make sure that our next steps are the right ones. Thank you very much.\n\nDAVID HARWOOD, State Dept. Special Adviser on Env., 1993-97:\n\nWe said that the United States was prepared to engage in targets and timetables. I mean, that was obviously a massive threshold for us to cross.\n\nU.N. CONFERENCE CHAIRMAN:\n\nI declare open the first session of the Conference of the Parties. The convention is coming of age.\n\nDAVID HARWOOD:\n\nThe question was, who goes first?\n\nAL GORE:\n\nIt was in no way possible to get a global treaty with a proposal that the poorest countries in the world would have to take the same obligations that the wealthy countries were undertaking.\n\nDAVID HARWOOD:\n\nAnd the idea was, those who developed the most and had contributed historically the most to the problem should step up to the plate first in the effort to reduce emissions.\n\nU.N. CONFERENCE CHAIRMAN:\n\nI should bang the hammer now.\n\nAL GORE:\n\nThat was the formula that the world agreed was the only way to make progress toward a truly global agreement.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nAt a follow-up in Kyoto, Japan, negotiators hope to agree on binding limits.\n\nFEMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nThe negotiators did agree they would exempt developing countries from the caps negotiated in Kyoto.\n\nAL GORE:\n\nBut the fossil fuel companies took that feature of the agreement and made that a bete noire. They made that a politically salient issue that they used to great effect.\n\nJOHN PASSACANTANDO, Former Exec. Director, Greenpeace USA:\n\nThis is a plan from the PR firm E. Bruce Harrison, after Berlin, prepared for the GCC board. This is the strategy of the grand fog. [Reading] \"Third-party recruitment and op-ed placement efforts will continue, although with a new emphasis on economists.\" So the strategy is evolving.\n\nPAUL BERNSTEIN, Charles River Associates, 1996-2004, 2006-11:\n\nIn 1996, I had finished up grad school and accepted a job at Charles River Associates. We were doing work for the American Petroleum Institute, so they had a particular point of view. If the U.S. goes ahead and reduces its emissions, and countries like China and India don't do anything, the U.S. puts itself at a competitive disadvantage. To try and put numbers on what those damages would do, how much they were hurt, I think is important, right?\n\nWe wrote a couple papers on our findings. I had general surprise of how much attention it got. It was finding its way into the airwaves.\n\nFEMALE ADVERTISEMENT VOICE:\n\nOur president must decide if he'll sign a U.N. climate treaty that could increase the cost of gasoline by 50 cents a gallon and raise electricity and natural gas prices by 25 to 50%. Meanwhile, countries like China, India and Mexico are exempt.\n\nMALE ADVERTISEMENT ACTOR:\n\nWe pay the price, and they're exempt?\n\nFEMALE ADVERTISEMENT VOICE:\n\nIt’s not global, and it won’t work.\n\nPAUL BERNSTEIN:\n\nThere's great pressure that came from the clients to talk about jobs. We tried to tell clients we really can't measure jobs accurately. But you have to get paid at the end of the day. So we ended up doing the best we could talking about jobs. But you don’t really—you don't really know.\n\nROBERT MURRAY, CEO, Murray Energy:\n\n[Archive] The first people that will lose their jobs are the American coal miner.\n\nJOHN SHLAES:\n\n[Archive] It would cost probably 5, 6, 700,000 jobs a year.\n\nANDREW CARD, President, American Automobile Manufacturers Association:\n\n[Archive] And that would hurt the U.S. automobile industry, and it would hurt the U.S. economy.\n\nWILLIAM O’KEEFE, Vice President of American Petroleum Institute:\n\n[Archive] Every independent—and I say every independent economic study has come to the same conclusion: that the impact is negative, and it's going to cost jobs.\n\nBENJAMIN FRANTA, Graduate fellow, Stanford University:\n\nAlthough the studies themselves acknowledge their funding from the industry, that funding is often not acknowledged when the results are presented to the public through advertorials that oil companies would take out in big venues like The New York Times without saying that the industry had paid for the study or what the limitations of the studies were. So it gave an impression that there were independent economists coming to this conclusion, when in reality they are hired by the fossil fuel industry. The analysis completely ignored the benefits of taking action about climate change.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nNeither the API nor Charles River Associates responded to questions about their work together.\n\nPAUL BERNSTEIN:\n\nI had misgivings about just telling half the story. What do we get? If we reduce emissions, we get less damage from climate change. And we’re not putting that in there.\n\nYeah, I wish I weren't a part of that, looking back. I wish I weren't a part of delaying action. Clearly on the wrong side of history.\n\nLouisiana, 2021\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nEighteen weather- and climate-related disasters, with a damage total of more than $1 billion each.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nGlobal damages estimated at around $280 billion.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nThese natural disasters could push the nation's infrastructure to the brink.\n\nNovember 1996\n\nMALE VOICE:\n\nPlease welcome our chairman, Lee Raymond. Lee?\n\nLEE RAYMOND:\n\nRight now, a United Nations effort is moving toward a decision in 1997 to cut the use of fossil fuels, based on the unproved theory that they affect the Earth's climate. If implemented, such a policy could inflict severe economic damage. So it's critical that we in the industry provide a voice of common sense on this important issue.\n\nIt means cooperating more closely with other associations within our industry. And it extends to the circle of logical allies outside our industry that stand with us on any given issue. One example is our close cooperation with the automobile industry. Recently, they have become engaged in the global climate issue and are active, aggressive allies.\n\nIf we all work toward the same goal, I believe we can change the perceptions of the American people about energy.\n\nKERT DAVIES:\n\nIt's a call to arms. He's trying to rally the oil industry to speak as one to oppose climate change action—to fight, basically, the run-up to the Kyoto Protocol.\n\nThis is when it really ramps up. We know Exxon has been funding a bunch of right-wing and libertarian conservative think tanks. Suddenly, in '97, the sums in those grants goes way up. They know that this is the big fight.\n\nJOHN PASSACANTANDO:\n\nIn the run-up to Kyoto, you're seeing these ad campaigns, the denial ad campaigns. You're seeing TV ads, you're seeing print ads. There's op-eds.\n\nKERT DAVIES:\n\nMillions and millions of dollars worth of advertising. \"Why is the U.S. being obliged to do more than everyone else?\"\n\nJOHN PASSACANTANDO:\n\n\"It's not global, and it won't work.\" And everybody sung from the same song sheet.\n\nJERRY TAYLOR:\n\nThe administration had just completely misread the political situation. There was no way in heck that the American public was going to accept regulating greenhouse gases in a fashion which would disadvantage American industry. That's an easy argument to make politically. You can make that in your sleep.\n\nFRED SINGER:\n\n[Archive] The biggest loser in all of this will be science. And I'm here to defend science.\n\nJOHN PASSACANTANDO:\n\nAnd then the Senate issues this Byrd-Hagel Resolution, which passes 95 to zero.\n\nSEN. CHUCK HAGEL, R-Nebraska, 1997-2009:\n\n[Archive] S. Res. 98 puts the administration on notice that an overwhelming and bipartisan majority of the United States Senate rejects its current negotiating position on a proposed new global climate treaty.\n\nFor me, it was a big deal. As a freshman senator, it was my first year in the Senate, with Bob Byrd.\n\nSEN. ROBERT BYRD, D-West Virginia, 1959-2010:\n\n[Archive] Any effort to avoid the effects of global climate change will be doomed to failure from the start without the participation of the developing world.\n\nCHUCK HAGEL:\n\n[Archive] This treaty would be a lead weight on our nation's future economic growth, killing jobs and opportunities for generations of Americans to come.\n\nByrd-Hagel got 95 votes—95 senators. Nobody voted against it.\n\n[Archive] Even using conservative assumptions, Charles River Associates, a leading economic modeling firm, for example, has estimated that holding emissions at 1990 levels would reduce economic growth by 1% a year, rising to 3%—\n\nI was not going to support a treaty that would affect our economy and everything else when we didn't have the absolute scientific evidence, first of all, to prove it, and second, and maybe even more important, let all these other countries off.\n\n[Archive] If anything has become clear during congressional hearings on this issue, it is that the science is unclear; is that the scientific community has not even come close to definitively concluding that we have a problem.\n\nI'm not a scientist. I'm not a climatologist. I listened to a lot of people. I asked for a lot of opinions. I had scientists coming in, I had other people come in.\n\nJANE McMULLEN:\n\nWe unearthed documents that show a series of meetings and briefings.\n\nJOHN PASSACANTANDO:\n\nOh, wow. It's quite amazing. Here's a memo from the American Petroleum Institute. They're putting on a luncheon, they're hosting Sen. Hagel and they're going to brief him. [Reading] \"Scientists do not have a precise understanding of this issue.\" Doubt, doubt.\n\nMeeting with Sen. Hagel and the Ford Motor Company. This is the American Automobile Manufacturers Association. The Aluminum Association. Chemical Manufacturers Association.\n\nYou know, I'm emphasizing Sen. Hagel, but this is happening all throughout the Senate. Ninety-five senators voted this certain way. But if you pull that lens back, you’re going to see they're working politicians with the most sophisticated legislative campaigns.\n\nJANE McMULLEN:\n\nWhat were they saying to you in those meetings? And did you learn anything that did help to shape your views?\n\nCHUCK HAGEL:\n\nWell, they made their case, they made their point. So you listen to them like you would anybody. I wasn't surprised by anything I heard.\n\nJANE McMULLEN:\n\nYou met Lee Raymond, the chairman and CEO of Exxon. What kind of relationship did you have with him?\n\nCHUCK HAGEL:\n\nWell, Lee Raymond was a South Dakota boy. I remember that. I didn't have a close relationship with him. But I listened to him. He's head of the largest oil company in the country. I listened to everybody's opinions.\n\nKERT DAVIES:\n\nSo this is a page from a briefing document. And it’s—the title is \"The Dilemma for Congress.\" [Reading] \"Draft resolution is attached for your consideration.\"\n\nJOHN PASSACANTANDO:\n\nSo the American Automobile Manufacturers Association is putting forth, on behalf, I think, of the Global Climate Coalition the draft resolution for the Senate to preemptively kill the Kyoto Protocol.\n\nCHUCK HAGEL:\n\nYou mean the Byrd-Hagel Resolution? They didn't draft that. We had many people coming forward with written examples—\"Why don't you do this?\" That's not unusual at all. Because our staffs work with them and so on. But that resolution wasn't an AMA resolution. That resolution was decided by us, by the senators.\n\nDecember 1997\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nVice President Al Gore is on his way to Kyoto, Japan, to attend the global warming summit. Now the goal of the conference is an international treaty to protect the environment, but so far, it's been hard to find anything the diplomats can agree on.\n\nTIMOTHY WIRTH, Undersecretary of State, 1993-Nov. '97:\n\nI think Byrd-Hagel really destroyed any hope of getting something done in Kyoto. There was no argument by the administration against the Byrd-Hagel Resolution. The Clinton administration certainly didn’t want to go into open war.\n\nAL GORE:\n\n[Archive] To those who seek to obfuscate and obstruct, we say we will not allow you to put narrow special interests above the interests of all humankind.\n\nMALE PROTESTER:\n\nCorporate American leadership will not save the world!\n\nJOHN PASSACANTANDO:\n\nIt was just an unbelievable mess. He did broker a deal and got as much out of Kyoto as he could have. But we were not going to get steep cuts in CO2 emissions out of a global agreement with all the industry fighting against them.\n\nFEMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nDelegates from the U.S. and 149 other countries have approved the treaty known as the Kyoto Protocol. President Clinton is praising the agreement, but he may have trouble getting it ratified.\n\nJERRY TAYLOR:\n\nThe Clinton administration never even put the Kyoto Protocol up for a vote in the Senate. It was DOA. And I think they understood that within a week of return from Kyoto.\n\nDAVID HARWOOD:\n\nI feel that at the end of the day, the Clinton-Gore administration was not able to deliver on the lofty promise of American leadership. The door closed for the next 10 years. So it was a significant missed opportunity.\n\nJERRY TAYLOR:\n\nWhen I became part of that world, we thought the odds were pretty long against us. We did not expect to prevail in the climate debate.\n\n[Archive]—to protect against a problem that most scientists don't say exist.\n\nBy the end of the decade, however, the climate skeptics and denialists were in a position of strength. Now, they had pretty much run the table. In every decisive fight, we had won.\n\nAL GORE:\n\nThey won the battle. I was intent that they would not win the war. It became clear to me at that point that it was going to be a longer war.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nWe approached multiple members of the industry coalition that campaigned against Kyoto. None would sit for an interview. For its part, Exxon Mobil has stated publicly that \"we recognize that our past participation in industry coalitions to oppose ineffective climate policies subjects us to criticism by climate-activist groups\" and that the Kyoto Protocol was \"unrealistic\" and \"economically damaging.\"\n\nCentral Japan, 2021\n\nFEMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nIt is unequivocal that human activities are responsible for climate change. That’s the finding of a new study by the U.N.’s intergovernmental panel on climate change.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nA dire warning and a stark reality. The head of the U.N. referred to this as \"code red\" for humanity.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nGlobal temperatures are the hottest in 100,000 years, and many effects of climate change are already irreversible.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nIf we want to avoid catastrophe, we have to drastically cut emissions—now.\n\nJANE McMULLEN:\n\nWe now know that Exxon was making a concerted effort through the 1990s to cast doubt on the science. Do you feel that you were misled?\n\nCHUCK HAGEL:\n\nWell, what we now know about some of these large oil companies’ positions, they lied. And yes, I was misled. Others were misled. When they had evidence in their own institutions that countered what they were saying publicly—I mean, they lied.\n\nJANE McMULLEN:\n\nIf they had said that, if they had held their hands up then and said, \"Yes, this is real,\" could it have been different?\n\nCHUCK HAGEL:\n\nOh, absolutely. It would have changed everything. I think it would have changed the average citizen’s appreciation of climate change.\n\nJANE McMULLEN:\n\nAnd yours?\n\nCHUCK HAGEL:\n\nAnd mine, of course. It would have put the United States and the world on a whole different track, and today we would have been so much further ahead than we are. It’s cost this country, and it cost the world.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nExxon Mobil continues to defend its record on climate change.\n\nCongressional Hearing\n\nOctober 2021\n\nDARREN WOODS:\n\nMy name is Darren Woods. I'm the chairman and chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil Corp.\n\nExxon Mobil has long recognized that climate change is real and poses serious risks. But there are no easy answers. Our position in this space has been consistent with the general consensus in the scientific community.\n\nMARTIN HOFFERT:\n\nI’m 83 years old. Three or four decades ago, we predicted it. As a scientist, to have those predictions come true, that's sort of the golden icon that you look for. However, as a human being, and as an inhabitant of planet Earth, I'm horrified to watch the lack of response to this. I’m trying as much as possible to distance myself emotionally.\n\nJANE McMULLEN:\n\nSo you're angry.\n\nMARTIN HOFFERT:\n\nYes. I'm furious.\n\nEDWARD GARVEY:\n\nIt's heartbreaking to me. I saw all of that potential there, at least at that point in time, to really solve the problem in many different ways. Had Exxon chosen to pick up the ball then and begin to lead, the discussions would have been about how to do it. We had solar scientists doing research. We had lithium battery chemists doing research. Think of how important these sciences are to the world currently.\n\nParts of the world are going to suffer enormously, unnecessarily so, and for something that we could have done something about. Not doing anything for decades, that—that's just squandered time, and we're going to pay for it.\n\nPart Two: Doubt\n\nKERT DAVIES, Director, Climate Investigations Center:\n\nIn 1998, there was this meeting in D.C. It's convened by the American Petroleum Institute. Exxon is in the room, Chevron, Southern Company, with various think tank officers, communications professionals and right-wing libertarian professionals. They're hatching a plan to stop people from worrying about climate change.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nLess than a year earlier, some of those in the room had helped block American participation in a major international attempt to combat climate change. They feared more threats on the horizon.\n\nKERT DAVIES:\n\nThe plan is a wide and concerted effort to install uncertainty around climate science, to decrease political pressure by sowing doubt around the science. Their targets include media, members of Congress, schoolteachers, average citizens. The plan right at the top says, \"Victory will be achieved when recognition of uncertainties becomes part of the quote, conventional wisdom.\" They said that it was never implemented, but what it shows is an intentionality—we need people to not care so much about climate change. We need uncertainty to rule the day.\n\n2000\n\nAL GORE, Presidential candidate, 2000:\n\n[Archive] Our country faces a big choice about the future. We are truly at a fork in the road.\n\nGEORGE W. BUSH, Presidential candidate:\n\nWith the help of Congress, environmental groups and industry, we will require all power plants to meet clean air standards in order to reduce emissions.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nThe new millennium began with a presidential campaign. One candidate had long advocated for action to combat global warming.\n\nAL GORE [campaign ad]:\n\nIn this election, the environment itself is on the ballot, and there’s a big difference between us. I’ll never put polluters in charge of our environmental laws.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nHis Republican rival was an oilman from Texas who was also talking about action on climate change.\n\nGEORGE W. BUSH:\n\nLook, global warming needs to be taken very seriously, and I take it seriously. Both of us care a lot about the environment. We may have different approaches.\n\nAL GORE:\n\nDuring the campaign of 2000, George W. Bush put out a position paper and a speech and a statement saying that he was all in favor of putting limits on carbon emissions. And he was in favor of all kinds of government measures. It dampened the sharp contrast that I had thought [laughs] was going to be very clear.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nWhenever there’s a transition of power in Washington, D.C., there’s a great deal of talk about a change in the culture as well.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nBush had pledged that he would place a national limit on America’s carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nPRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH:\n\nGov. Whitman reflects a growing consensus in this country about environmental policy. She and I share the same point of view.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nOnce in office, President Bush tapped Christie Todd Whitman to run the Environmental Protection Agency to turn his pledge into action.\n\nCHRISTINE TODD WHITMAN, EPA Administrator, 2001-03:\n\nWe had talked about it before I accepted the position. Some sort of a cap on carbon that limits the amount of emissions is what's critical. And the president agreed with me; we were on the same page.\n\nI thought that this was our opportunity, that we could really get it done.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nLess than two months after the inauguration, Whitman prepared to travel to a gathering of environmental ministers from eight of the world’s largest economies.\n\nCHRISTINE TODD WHITMAN:\n\nBefore I went to my first G8 environmental ministers meeting in Italy, I went to the White House and I basically said, \"Look, I am going to say we'll put a cap on carbon,\" because that had been in the campaign literature. And I ran that all the way up the flagpole at the White House to make sure it was OK and—\"Fine. Go ahead.\"\n\nTrieste, Italy\n\nCHRISTINE TODD WHITMAN:\n\n[Archive] The president has indicated he acknowledges that global warming is of primary importance. It’s at the top of his agenda.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nBut while Whitman was in Italy, a very different message was being promoted through the top ranks of the Bush administration. Haley Barbour, an influential Republican and energy lobbyist, had written to Vice President Dick Cheney, questioning whether the carbon cap idea was “eco-extremism” and risked exacerbating the country’s energy problems. Other prominent voices, some from think tanks funded by the fossil fuel industry, joined in, too, opposing climate action.\n\nBILL O’REILLY, FOX News:\n\nThis global warming controversy is unprovable, but that doesn't stop people on both sides from swearing they know what the heck is going on. Joining us now from Washington is Jerry Taylor, the Cato Institute’s director of natural resource studies.\n\nJERRY TAYLOR, Cato Institute, 1991-2014:\n\nMy objective while at Cato was to demonstrate to smart, engaged people that the case against climate action was far stronger than they realized. And I honestly and in good faith felt that the arguments against climate action were far, far stronger. And so that was my job. And I did it well.\n\nFor most people, if things are very uncertain, they're not going to commit a lot of resources to address them until that certain uncertainty clears up.\n\nBILL O’REILLY:\n\nDo you believe that the people of the United States should do anything because of the weather?\n\nDEB CALLAHAN, League of Conservation Voters:\n\nYou know, in fact, EPA Administrator Christie Whitman—\n\nJERRY TAYLOR:\n\nDebate is performance art. I was pretty good at that performance art. I was the good communicating gunslinger.\n\nDEB CALLAHAN:\n\nThings that will save money and save the environment.\n\nBILL O’REILLY:\n\nMr. Taylor, last word.\n\nJERRY TAYLOR:\n\n[Archive] We've already had about a third of the amount of warming that we're going to get this century. It's already happened, and crop yields are up, life expectancy is up.\n\nBILL O’REILLY:\n\nAll right. So you’re fine and Ms. Callahan is battening down the hatches. Well—\n\nJERRY TAYLOR:\n\n[Archive] Things are fine so far.\n\nCHRISTINE TODD WHITMAN:\n\nWhen I returned from Italy, I heard some rumors that all of a sudden we weren't going to go forward with a cap on carbon. So I asked for a meeting with the president, went over and met with him. And it was a done deal.\n\nIn fact, as I walked out of the office after that meeting, the vice president was just coming by and said, \"Do you have the letter for me?\" I didn't know what letter he was talking about. He asked the secretary, and they handed him an envelope. And he was on his way up to the Hill. And it was the letter that said, \"We're not doing a cap on carbon—too bad, rest of the world.\"\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nThe president claims he dropped the plan because it would drive up already inflated energy costs. But the announcement left his EPA chief, who had vigorously promoted the curbs, twisting in the wind.\n\nCHRISTINE TODD WHITMAN:\n\nI was really blindsided when I found that we were backing out of that pledge. I was monumentally disappointed. The administration was extremely close to the energy industry. The vice president was industry, through and through. And he was very persuasive in his arguments, as were the some of the Republicans on the Hill about how this was going to kill the economy, that we needed more energy. We could not start to put a cap on carbon. And so there just was no appetite, economically, politically or otherwise, to go forward with a cap on carbon.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nThe vice president was stressing the need for more fossil fuels.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT DICK CHENEY:\n\nSome things about the future we cannot know. Years down the road, alternative fuels may become a great deal more plentiful than they are today. But we are not yet in any position to stake our economy and our way of life on that possibility. For years down the road, this will continue to be true.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nThe president, too, veered from the tone he’d struck as a candidate and was emphasizing the uncertainty of climate science.\n\nGEORGE W. BUSH:\n\nClimate change, with its potential to impact every corner of the world, is an issue that must be addressed by the world. We do not know how fast change will occur or even how some of our actions could impact it.\n\nCHRISTINE TODD WHITMAN:\n\nIt really was a tragedy. If President Bush had gone forward with a cap on carbon, it would have made an enormous difference. It would have been a huge signal coming from a Republican administration.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nThe head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced her resignation today. Christine Whitman said she wanted to spend more time with her family.\n\nCHRISTINE TODD WHITMAN:\n\nOnce we'd gone through this what I would call a debacle over the cap on carbon, there was no appetite for addressing climate change at all. It wasn't going to be the number one issue. It just wasn't. That was it. I mean, you just didn't talk about it. The industry was winning a lot of battles that I was losing. I mean, ultimately, that's what led me to leave the administration. I wasn't going to just be a rubber stamp for industry. And I just had had enough.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nHistory’s biggest merger created America’s largest company, and together Exxon and Mobil will be the biggest oil company in the world: 123,000 employees, $200 billion in revenue and 47,000 gas stations worldwide.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nThe Bush administration’s U-turn was a victory for Big Oil—especially Exxon Mobil. Its CEO, Lee Raymond, was close to the vice president, who’d been an oil industry executive himself.\n\nRUSSELL GOLD, The Wall Street Journal, 2000-21:\n\nThese men were business associates. They were friendly. They were part of the same fraternity—the oil fraternity.\n\nCorporate citizenship award presentation, 2003\n\nDICK CHENEY:\n\nYou rolling?\n\nMALE VOICE:\n\nYes, sir.\n\nDICK CHENEY:\n\nAs chairman and chief executive officer of one of the world’s leading energy companies, Lee Raymond has helped to improve the lives of countless people all over the world. And as the head of a major science and knowledge-based corporation, Lee understands the critical importance of science and technology to continued progress and economic growth, both at home and abroad.\n\nKERT DAVIES:\n\nI've been investigating the fossil industry for decades, and Exxon was a ringleader. And they were at the center of the campaigns that were around in the late '90s, early 2000s, to stall climate policy.\n\nExxon had emerged as the real bully on climate change, headed by Lee Raymond, who was a hardened denier.\n\nShareholder meeting\n\nLEE RAYMOND:\n\nNumber two, please.\n\nMALE SPEAKER:\n\nThank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to comment on the findings of fact about the relationship between the burning of fossil fuels and of climate deterioration. I understand that the corporation's policy is that this remains in the realm of the unproven, but I would like to state from the broad scientific community that this is, in fact, a well-established fact.\n\nLEE RAYMOND:\n\nThere is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane or other greenhouse gases is causing or will in the foreseeable future cause catastrophic heating of the Earth’s atmosphere and disruption of the Earth’s climate.\n\nNEELA BANERJEE, Supervising Climate Editor, NPR:\n\nLee Raymond is salient because he kept hammering away at the idea of scientific uncertainty about human activity driving climate change, even as the science grew more certain.\n\nLEE RAYMOND:\n\nThere is a substantial difference of view in the scientific community as to what exactly is going on. I could assert to you that I don't think this is happening. My mind is open enough to say I’m going to listen to the science.\n\nKERT DAVIES:\n\nFrom 1998 to 2014, Exxon alone put over $30 million into think tanks that were proffering uncertainty, that were questioning the climate science, questioning policies that were being proposed, really casting doubt on anything to do with climate change at the state level, at the national level and internationally.\n\nBILL HEINS, Geoscientist, Exxon Mobil, 2001-19:\n\nI started working at Exxon Mobil shortly after the merger. At the turn of the century, they were making on the order of $5 billion a year.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nGeoscientist Bill Heins had spent years studying past climate change before joining Exxon Mobil.\n\nThis is the first time he’s been interviewed about his experiences at the company.\n\nBILL HEINS:\n\nI'm disappointed, I'm angry, I'm disenchanted at the duplicity exhibited by Exxon Mobil to say one thing internally and to say a different thing with a much different consequence in the political arena.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nHe’d been hired to use his expertise in climate change to help discover new oil deposits.\n\nBILL HEINS:\n\nMy ambition when I joined Exxon was to keep doing my science. And I was blown away, doing all kinds of really interesting earth science research at technical levels above what was happening even in top universities. And not only was it appreciated, but it was for a reason: People need energy to live. And we were providing that energy.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nHeins says scientists at the company had developed a deep understanding of climate change and the role of burning fossil fuels.\n\nBILL HEINS:\n\nThis was real fundamental earth science. We really tore apart \"How does the Earth work?\" And climate is a really important part of that system. So you’ve got to understand the climate system to search for oil and gas. The fundamental idea that we put CO2 in the atmosphere, and that makes the temperature go up, and that's bad, everybody understands that, completely, clearly.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nHe says he quickly saw signs of a disconnect between what he and his colleagues knew and the position the company wanted to stress.\n\nBILL HEINS:\n\nShortly after I joined Exxon Mobil there was a presentation by Art Green, who was the chief geoscientist of Exxon Mobil Exploration. All the scientific staff are there, and Art got up and gave his presentation about how ice core records were unreliable. And here were temperature excursions in the past when there couldn't possibly be any human influence. And here's all these reasons why we really don't have to worry about climate change. He didn’t clearly state it, but the subtext appeared to be that his bosses didn’t believe that climate change was something to be concerned about.\n\nThere was kind of stunned silence in the room. And Exxon Mobil is a very polite place. In that context, the reaction was quite remarkable. Translated in modern parlance, if my children were explaining the reaction, they would say, \"Are you nuts? No, we don't believe you! We're scientists here, we don’t want to hear this stuff.\"\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nArthur Green is retired from Exxon Mobil and did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe company would not grant us any interviews but said in a statement that it “has long acknowledged the reality and risks of climate change, and it has devoted significant resources to addressing those risks.” And it said that “it should not be surprising that there are competing views about how best to address the risks of climate change.”\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nHurricane Mitch smashed homes, wrecked crops, killed thousands of people.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nTwenty-five people were killed by mudslides in southern Italy caused by two days of torrential rain.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nThe people had no warning of the deluge. It came in the dead of night as they slept.\n\nFEMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nRecord temperatures in Italy, Kosovo and France have also sparked blazes.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nMichael MacCracken was one of the government’s senior scientists investigating climate change during the Bush administration.\n\nMICHAEL MacCRACKEN:\n\nMy career was in climate modeling. From 1997 to 2002, I was in charge of helping make the first climate assessment on the U.S., what would be the impacts. And what we found is that there was no question that it was rising concentrations of CO2 doing that.\n\n[Archive] If we really want to do something significant to slow this so that our grandchildren don't face a changing world, we're going to have to do a substantial movement away from the key fossil fuels of coal and oil, particularly.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nIn January 2001, MacCracken participated in a headline-grabbing report for the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The IPCC said there was now “new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities.”\n\nMICHAEL MacCRACKEN, U.S. Global Change Research Program, 1993-2002:\n\nThe statement that came out of the IPCC said, \"Look, humans are the main cause.\" And that turned out to be very controversial.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nExxon Mobil’s response was severe. A company lobbyist faxed the Bush administration demanding MacCracken and several others who worked with the IPCC be removed, accusing them of scientific bias.\n\nMICHAEL MacCRACKEN:\n\nThe fax was sent by Randy Randol, the senior environmental adviser to Exxon Mobil. It says, “The U.S. was represented by Clinton-Gore carryovers with aggressive agendas.” And so he offered his thoughts on what should be done.\n\nExxon just didn’t like the science that was coming out and so was basically calling for a complete replacement of those who were leading the scientific enterprise.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nWithin two years, the scientists that Exxon Mobil had named, including MacCracken, would retire or be replaced.\n\nMICHAEL MacCRACKEN:\n\nExxon Mobil tried to control the discussion in the United States and then put off the problem. We'll make our profits now and we'll slowly change, but we won't do anything urgent enough as the science was indicating.\n\nAnd so I chose to write a letter, directed to Lee Raymond as chairman and chief executive but copied to everybody else.\n\n[Reading] \"Dear Mr. Raymond. While my departure may be satisfying to Exxon Mobil, I can assure you that this will not make the scientific challenge of climate change and its impacts go away. That 150 countries unanimously agree about the science of this issue is not because of some green conspiracy, but because of the solid scientific underpinning for this issue. To call Exxon Mobil's position out of the mainstream is thus a gross understatement.\"\n\nAnd then a few weeks later, I received a response from Kenneth Cohen, who was vice president for public affairs.\n\n[Reading] \"In summary, we regret that you apparently don't understand the company's actions and activities related to this complex issue. Possible human-induced climate change is a long-term risk that we at Exxon Mobil take very seriously.\"\n\nThey had to write something. [Laughs]\n\nMALE TV ANNOUNCER:\n\nFrom our studios in New York City, this is Charlie Rose.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE:\n\nLee Raymond is here. Exxon Mobil is having a record year in 2005. His career has been a remarkable financial performance. He retires at the end of this year. Welcome back.\n\nLEE RAYMOND:\n\nSounds ominous, Charlie. It's good to be here, thank you.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE:\n\nThe environmental community thinks you are part of the problem.\n\nLEE RAYMOND:\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nCHARLIE ROSE:\n\nThey say the following: Global warming is produced by CO2 emission in the air.\n\nLEE RAYMOND:\n\nDo I disagree with the premise that the Earth is getting warmer?\n\nCHARLIE ROSE:\n\nYes, sir.\n\nLEE RAYMOND:\n\nNo, I really don't disagree with that. The climate has changed every year for millions of years. If we weren't here, the climate would change. There have been times in the Earth's history where there has been no ice on the Earth. No ice on the Earth. Man didn't have anything to do with it.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nExxon Mobil itself had been reinforcing this kind of message, using “advertorials”—advertisements with the appearance of editorial content—in major newspapers. They promoted the idea that the science of climate change was still too uncertain to limit the use of fossil fuels.\n\nBILL HEINS:\n\nWhen I looked at those advertorials at the time, I didn't take them as being that important. Sitting inside the organization and doing good science, I thought, \"We’re for good science.\" I averted my gaze.\n\nSo this one about \"unsettled science\" is highlighting uncertainties or variabilities that are true, but they’re not important to the issue. It's not something that deflects us from the basic idea that more CO2 changes the climate in a bad way. They were sowing doubt. It was not just public posturing, it was truly casting aspersions on science.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nLee Raymond did not respond to our request for an interview.\n\nIn its statements to us, Exxon Mobil said, “There is no truth to the suggestion that Exxon Mobil ever misled the public or policymakers about climate change.\" And the company said it has been consistent with the “contemporary understanding of mainstream climate science.”\n\nBILL HEINS:\n\nSo it would be correct to say that Lee Raymond was consistent with science in saying that we don't quite know exactly what the answer is. But he was out of sync with the science of the time, which said, \"If you keep going in this direction, it's going to be bad.\" That is a different thing than the strictly legalistic argument about being consistent with the science.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nScientists are telling us that these kinds of events will become more frequent and probably more intense.\n\nFEMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nExtreme drought conditions are providing dangerous fuel for wildfires.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nThere are many predictions that Hurricane Katrina will turn out to be the nation’s most expensive natural disaster.\n\nMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nHurricane activity, that's gone up so much in correlation with the rise in tropical ocean temperatures, which globally is attributable to global warming. The signal is pretty unmistakable.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nAs the science and the warnings became clearer and more urgent, some of the fossil fuel industry’s most reliable allies started having doubts.\n\nJERRY TAYLOR:\n\nI look back on the work I did at that time with a lot of regrets. If I had known at the time what Exxon Mobil internally knew, as we are becoming increasingly aware, no, I would definitely have been in a different place.\n\n[Archive] Well, sure, you can run through your parade of horribles that we've heard about over the years. We were told that there would be massive die-offs from overpopulation and famine, and then that never happened. And people would starve, and that never happened. And now we’ve got a global warming situation, allegedly.\n\nIt became increasingly clear to me that as I debated smart people on the other side, using state-of-the-art information that was being generated in real time in the academic literature, that my job became increasingly difficult. The arguments weren't holding up. That began my move away from climate skepticism. Because as the 2000s play out, the arguments for action on the scientific front become stronger and stronger and stronger.\n\nCROWD [chanting]:\n\nWhat do we want? Clean fuel. When do we want it? Now! What do we want? Clean fuel. When do we want it? Now!\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nAt Exxon Mobil, under a new CEO, Rex Tillerson, they had now made a public acknowledgement that the risks of climate change justified taking action. But at the same time, they were still raising the uncertainties and funding groups who disputed the scientific consensus.\n\nShareholder meeting press conference\n\nMALE REPORTER:\n\nIs Exxon still funding organizations and individuals that consistently put forward the view that global warming is not caused by human activity?\n\nREX TILLERSON:\n\nI don’t really read that. And when I read what these groups are publishing, what they're examining are holes in science, gaps in the science, things that don't have a good scientific basis.\n\nNEELA BANERJEE:\n\nUnder Rex Tillerson, what they said was, \"We just don't know, and do we really want to overturn our economies and upend things to address growing CO2 levels when we just don't know?\"\n\nREX TILLERSON:\n\nAs I said earlier, I think having a good debate on this is what's sorely needed. And this rush to everyone wanting to say \"We've got it figured out,\" that's just—I hate to say it, but that ain’t so.\n\nJERRY SEINFELD:\n\nAnd the Oscar goes to An Inconvenient Truth, Davis Guggenheim.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nIn 2006, Al Gore’s film, An Inconvenient Truth, sounded the alarm to a widening audience, warning of a \"planetary emergency.\"\n\n“An Inconvenient Truth” trailer\n\nVICE PRESIDENT AL GORE, 1993-2001:\n\n[Archive] All over the world we need to solve the climate crisis. We have everything we need to get started, with the possible exception of the will to act. That’s a renewable resource. Let's renew it.\n\nWe had reality on our side. And tragically, the felt consequences of the climate crisis were growing in intensity and frequency and severity. It was time to regroup again and double down.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nThe president wasn’t persuaded to pursue legislative action but by now had publicly stated that humans were causing climate change. Other Republicans were shifting their positions, too.\n\nREP. BOB INGLIS, R-SC, 1993-99, 2005-11:\n\nFor my first six years in Congress, I said that climate change was nonsense. I didn't know anything about it except that Al Gore was for it. That was the end of the inquiry. But then our son, the eldest of our five kids, had just turned 18, so he was voting for the first time. And he came to me and he said, \"Dad, I'll vote for you, but you're going to clean up your act on the environment.\" So that was step one of a metamorphosis for me. Step two was going to Antarctica with the Science Committee, seeing the evidence in the ice core drillings. In that mile of ice is an amazing record of the Earth's atmosphere. What it shows is stable levels of CO2 and then an uptick that coincides with the Industrial Revolution.\n\nWe make climate science sound so complicated. It's really not.\n\nJONATHAN PHILLIPS, Congressional staff, 2007-14:\n\nIn 2007, climate change was at its most bipartisan level that I think it ever was. You had Republican members of Congress introducing bills about it. Politically, sort of public awareness-wise, this was a bit of a golden era in the United States.\n\nAlliance for Climate Protection promotional video\n\nNANCY PELOSI:\n\nHi, I'm Nancy Pelosi, lifelong Democrat and speaker of the House.\n\nNEWT GINGRICH:\n\nAnd I'm Newt Gingrich, lifelong Republican, and I used to be speaker.\n\nNANCY PELOSI:\n\nWe don’t always see eye to eye, do we, Newt?\n\nNEWT GINGRICH:\n\nNo, but we do agree our country must take action to address climate change.\n\nNANCY PELOSI:\n\nWe need cleaner forms of energy, and we need them fast.\n\nJONATHAN PHILLIPS:\n\nOne of the first things that Nancy Pelosi did as speaker was to create the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, and I was lucky enough to land my dream job and be a staffer on this committee. This is where laws would be made to deal with what I believed was an existential crisis for humanity.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nThe committee picked up the idea of a carbon cap that the Bush administration had rejected years earlier. They wanted to set a national limit on greenhouse gas emissions and require companies to trade amongst themselves for how much each could emit.\n\nJONATHAN PHILLIPS:\n\nThe ultimate goal of the bill was to reduce carbon emissions by 80% below 2005 levels by 2050. And that's a lot of fossil industry. A lot of oil and gas producers—the coal miners, the coal companies, refineries. It was going to hit someone’s pocketbook.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nThe plan emerged as the 2008 presidential campaign was ramping up. Republican candidate John McCain came out in support of the cap and trade approach.\n\nSEN. JOHN McCAIN, R-Arizona:\n\nThe facts of global warming demand our urgent attention, especially in Washington.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nSo did his opponent, Democrat Barack Obama.\n\nSEN. BARACK OBAMA, D-Illinois:\n\nI am absolutely certain that generations from now, we will be able to look back and tell our children this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal.\n\nHEATHER ZICHAL, Environmental policy director, Obama campaign:\n\nHaving worked on many presidential races and around presidential politics, that was the first year where we really saw climate change as something that American voters really wanted to hear from candidates on. It was interesting, because we were not necessarily having a debate about whether or not climate change was real. It was really, \"How collectively can we make a meaningful contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions across the economy?\"\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nShortly before the presidential election, Exxon Mobil contacted corporate responsibility specialist Bennett Freeman.\n\nBENNETT FREEMAN, SVP, Calvert Investments, 2006-15:\n\nI had an informal conversation in the back of a limousine with Ken Cohen at Exxon Mobil, who was essentially their chief policymaker and public affairs officer. I think the observation that got Ken Cohen's attention was that we had this unprecedented situation where both the Republican and the Democratic nominee for president both committed to the climate agenda. And we had a pretty frank conversation about the implications for the company, particularly on climate.\n\nI thought that Exxon was shamefully out of the action because it had become so apparent that climate science was real. So my advice to Ken was for the company to finally take a public position on climate policy. To make an unequivocal statement accepting the reality of climate science. To make a unequivocal commitment to not fund any more climate denial research, which Exxon was infamous for supporting, for funding directly. And to take a positive, proactive position supporting action at the U.S. federal level.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nTwo weeks before President Obama was inaugurated, Exxon Mobil CEO Tillerson would give a speech that went farther than the company had ever gone on the urgency of the climate change issue.\n\nBENNETT FREEMAN:\n\nAmazingly, that speech happened.\n\nJanuary 2009\n\nREX TILLERSON:\n\nGlobally, the outlook for energy expects energy-related carbon dioxide emissions to rise by an average of 1% per year through the year 2030. These two fundamental realities, meeting enormous demand growth and managing the risk of greenhouse gas emissions, are the twin challenges of our time.\n\nBENNETT FREEMAN:\n\nIt was, I think, the first time that at least at the CEO level, they started, just started to take a policy position that was potentially constructive. It's important to acknowledge that this was an initial step. But it's equally important, even more important, in my opinion, to emphasize that it was a step that was little and late.\n\nRUSSELL GOLD, FRONTLINE consultant:\n\nI covered Exxon Mobil at The Wall Street Journal at that time, and Rex Tillerson was a breath of fresh air. He starts talking about the importance of pursuing a lower carbon path. But at the end of the day, I can't really point to anything substantive that changed.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nRex Tillerson did not respond to interview requests.\n\nDespite his speech, Exxon Mobil did not endorse cap and trade. The bill, sponsored by Democrats Henry Waxman and Edward Markey, narrowly passed the House.\n\nMALE SPEAKER:\n\nYeas are 219, nays are 212. [Applause] The bill is passed.\n\nFEMALE NEWSREADER:\n\nThe president won a victory in the House of Representatives on a sweeping climate bill.\n\nJONATHAN PHILLIPS:\n\nJune 26, 2009. It was a big day. It was the culmination of years of work. Inside, I think there was a lot of relieved and happy people, because this was the end of a very long road. It was a huge moment.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nIt was the first legislation to curb greenhouse gas emissions to pass the House of Representatives. Now the bill needed to get through the Senate.\n\nJONATHAN PHILLIPS:\n\nWe were optimistic that the Senate would pick up the bill that summer. And I think we were a little bit naive about t"
