        "text": "At Ausfilm’s 2018 AGM held on Thursday 16th August at Fox Studios the Chair of Ausfilm, the Hon. Bob McMullan announced the results of the election of two corporate member positions on the Ausfilm Board.\n\nExisting Board members, Zareh Nalbandian from Animal Logic and Tony Clark from Rising Sun Pictures were both re-elected to the Ausfilm Board for another three-year term. There were four nominees in this year’s Board election which are elected by the Ausfilm corporate membership.\n\nThe Ausfilm Board members are:\n\nThe Hon. Bob McMullan (Independent Chair)\n\nCorporate Members\n\nZareh Nalbandian, Animal Logic (Deputy Chair)\n\nWayne Borg, Fox Studios Australia\n\nSimon Rosenthal, Method Australia\n\nTony Clark, Rising Sun Pictures\n\nLynne Benzie, Village Roadshow Studios\n\nScreen Agency Board Members (incl. designated observer)\n\nElizabeth W. Scott, Create NSW\n\nCaroline Pitcher, Film Victoria\n\nGraeme Mason, Screen Australia\n\nTracey Vieira, Screen Queensland\n\nSeph McKenna, Screenwest\n\nCourtney Gibson, South Australian Film Corporation (SAFC)\n\nMichael Brealey (Create NSW) and Richard Harris (Screen Australia) left their positions during the year and Jenny Tosi (Film Victoria) and Ian Booth (Screenwest) had announced their departure at last year’s AGM. So we had quite a few new Board members to welcome: Courtney Gibson joined the Board as the CEO of the SAFC as well as Caroline Pitcher for Film Victoria, Seph McKenna for Screenwest and Elizabeth W. Scott for Create NSW.\n\nAt the AGM the Chair and CEO welcomed the new Board members and re-capped the year which is also the 20th anniversary year for Ausfilm.\n\nBut this wasn’t the only reason to celebrate. In 2018 the Federal Government also introduced the AUD$140 million Location Incentive to supplement the existing 16.5% Location Offset tax rebate. Applications have opened and Ausfilm is looking forward to more productions locating to Australia or completing their post, sound, music or visual effects with Australia’s talented and creative post and VFX companies."
