        "text": "NEW YORK – New York City Mayor Eric Adams today announced the appointment of Assistant Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Louis A. Molina as the next commissioner of the New York City Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS). Assistant Deputy Mayor Molina, a veteran public servant who has held leadership positions across New York City government and other localities, will be tasked with leading the operational agency that manages the city’s hiring and training, buildings, procurement processes, municipal vehicle fleet, and efforts to reduce carbon emissions from government operations, among other critical functions.\n\n“DCAS is the foundation of our city government — ultimately making it possible for city agencies to carry out our vision of protecting public safety, rebuilding our economy, and making this city more livable,” said Mayor Adams. “Louis Molina is a proven and dynamic leader who has used his decades of experience, across multiple agencies, to make government run better and improve the way we serve New Yorkers. I could not think of a more deserving or equipped leader to serve our administration in this critical role.”\n\n“Since the start of this administration, DCAS has been one of the most effective vehicles for advancing our administration’s priorities — from delivering employment opportunities to underrepresented communities to making our city’s fleet safer and more sustainable,” said First Deputy Mayor Sheena Wright. “We are thrilled to have Louis Molina, with his deep government operations experience and decades of leadership, steer this invaluable agency through its next chapter, and help it make an even bigger impact on the lives of New Yorkers.”\n\n“Louis Molina has been front and center in Mayor Adams’ mission to protect public safety in our city. First as Department of Correction commissioner and, most recently, as assistant deputy mayor, he has proven himself time and again as an innovative leader with a deep dedication to ensuring the safety of New York City and all New Yorkers,” said Deputy Mayor Philip Banks III. “I’m excited to work with Lou in this new role where I know he will continue to flourish, as he helps hire and train the next generation of civil servants, including those heroic New Yorkers who keep our city safe.”\n\n“Public service has been my passion and my life’s work, first serving my country as a United States Marine, and then my city as a police officer, and in leadership roles that shaped public safety and vital services for New Yorkers,” said Assistant Deputy Mayor and incoming DCAS Commissioner Molina. “DCAS makes city government work for our city, and I’m grateful to Mayor Adams for entrusting me with this crucial mission for his administration. I’m eager to help New Yorkers follow their dreams like I once did and discover their own passion for city service, and I am eager to, once again, lead a dedicated group of public servants who work hard to deliver for our city every day.”\n\nAbout Louis Molina\n\nLouis A. Molina is a veteran public safety leader with experience in government, law enforcement, and corrections. Molina assumed the role of assistant deputy mayor for public safety in October 2023, where he has coordinated with all city agencies on public safety matters affecting New Yorkers, including chairing Retail Task Force meetings, evaluating technology for public safety agencies, hosting community public safety outreach briefings, and representing New York City at the European Parliament with the Strong Cities Network, a global network of more than 180 cities dedicated to addressing all forms of hate, extremism, and polarization that can lead to violence.\n\nImmediately prior to serving as assistant deputy mayor, he served as the commissioner of the New York City Department of Correction (DOC), joining at the start of the Adams administration in January 2022. As DOC commissioner, Molina oversaw reductions in violence in jails, including significant declines in incidents of slashings and stabbings and assaults on staff, as well as dramatic declines in staff absenteeism and improvements to training of uniformed staff.\n\nPrior to joining the Adams administration, Molina served as chief for the City of Las Vegas’ Department of Public Safety, where he oversaw the city’s jail, deputy city marshals, and Animal Protection Services. In 2018, Molina served as the first deputy commissioner for the Westchester County Department of Correction, where he was credited with implementing significant reforms to the county jail and successfully obtaining compliance with U.S. Department of Justice federal oversight agreement, leading to the successful conclusion with remedying constitutional violations at the county jail.\n\nMolina has also served as chief internal monitor and acting assistant commissioner of the Nunez Compliance unit at DOC, as well as a senior advisor for security and emergency operations at the New York City Department of Homeless Services, and as first deputy chief of the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission. Molina started his career in law enforcement as a police officer in the New York City Police Department and rose to the rank of detective.\n\nMolina is also a decorated veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Philosophy from Chaminade University, a Master of Public Administration from Marist College School of Management, a Master of Arts degree in Human Rights Studies from Columbia University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and studied abroad at the University of Cambridge, United Kingdom.
