        "text": "Sugar Levy, Ethanol, Paid Maternity Leave\n\nBob McMullan - Shadow Treasurer\n\nDoorstop Interview\n\nTranscript - Parliament House, Canberra - 13 September 2002\n\nE & OE - PROOF ONLY\n\nMCMULLAN: Well, next week in Parliament the Opposition will be taking the opportunity to call the Government to account for a series of attacks on the living standards of Australian families. We have seen, just this week, decisions to increase the price of private health insurance, decisions to increase the price of sugar, decisions that will lead to an increase in the price of petrol. And as soon as somebody puts forward a proposition to try and help Australian families, like paid maternity leave, the Government is out in force trying the kill the proposition. But every time there is a proposition where they can get a bit more revenue out of Australian families or hit Australian consumers, Peter Costello has an unerring eye for unfair taxes as a solution to every problem.\n\nThe Government seems totally unaware of the fact that family budgets are already under pressure, particularly as a result of the explosion of household debt and the consequent effect on families' repayments of their debts and interest.\n\nIt is a sure sign of a Government that is overconfident, tired, and has run out of ideas that they continue to turn to taxes on Australian families and opposition to propositions to improve the living standards of Australian families, like paid maternity leave.\n\nJOURNALIST: Can you explain how the ethanol decision will increase the price of petrol at the pump?\n\nMCMULLAN: Well, the Automobile Association has said it will do it straight away, and I can see that there are circumstances in which that could happen; but what you should notice is, that the increase in excise is permanent, the compensating bounty is only for 12 months.\n\nJOURNALIST: So how will it instantly increase the price?\n\nMCMULLAN: Well, what I am saying is, the Automobile Association says it will do it instantly, and I think they could be right  it depends upon the impact, for example, whether people are using imported ethanol, where it will increase the price, and it depends on the relative price of ethanol and petrol. But, in 12 months time, there is a very serious potential problem for families, and we have asked the question already: How can the Government guarantee that some of the independent retailers who use imported ethanol won't wind up paying higher petrol prices at the pump, and what are they going to do in 12 months time when the subsidy runs out while the excise continues'?\n\nJOURNALIST: Will the Opposition be looking into this allegation that a so-called friend of the Liberal Party has benefited greatly from this Manildra Group?\n\nMCMULLAN: Well, I have read that with interest and that is a matter that I am sure will get a lot of detailed scrutiny when, for example, the Estimates Committee comes around. But that also raises another issue, which is, there is a fascination with the idea that in some way, assistance to ethanol will help the sugar industry, when in Australia, 90 per cent of the ethanol that is produced is produced from wheat [ ] Government's friends at Manildra, and there is no reason to believe that that is going to change.\n\nJOURNALIST: Would the Opposition support domestically produced ethanol being free of fuel excise?\n\nMCMULLAN: Well, I think that question really arises if you make a decision to make it mandatory -- that is where you get a significant cost if you don't do something about the excise -- the key question at the moment is [ ]the first thing is, do we need to have a levy on sugar to fund assistance to the sugar industry because that is what is driving most of this: the serious and real problems in the sugar industry and the need to assist them.\n\nJOURNALIST: Does the Opposition think\n\nMCMULLAN: Just hold on a second. Well no we don't, thanks Jim, I thought you were asking a different question.\n\nJOURNALIST: I am asking both.\n\nMCMULLAN: The question with regard to the levy is this. It is clear that there should be assistance to the sugar industry. We want to see the detail and the package as to whether we support every dot and comma of what is proposed and some of my colleagues will be leading the debate for us on that. But the idea of assistance we welcome and support. But there is no need for a levy of this sort to fund it. We provide much, much more support to other industries, like the car industry, with no consequential levy to fund it. It is simply a product of the Government having developed a propensity to put an unfair tax to fund all their policy initiatives, in some part because they have blown the Budget and can't afford to fund what is actually quite modest assistance to an industry in need. It is a very unfair tax. Every Australian family, whether they are rich or poor, will be paying the same amount which is not the principle on which a fair tax system is based.\n\nJOURNALIST: To go back to the previous question then  does the Opposition think ethanol ought to be mandated, and if it is, should it be free of excise?\n\nMCMULLAN: Well, we will be having a look at the question of whether it should be mandated in the near future and there are some very real concerns people have raised about consumer consequences for motorists, the impact of mandated ethanol levels on the quality, on warranties for motor vehicles, on car engines and fuel lines et cetera, and a number of my colleagues are bringing a submission with me to the Shadow Cabinet about that and we will have a detailed look at it. I don't want to pretend that every bit about the motor vehicle impact of ethanol is in my personal level of expertise. I can start a car and I can steer a car and after that I am just about worn out.\n\nJOURNALIST: On the question of paid maternity leave, the Government is saying that it will be yet another impost that couldn't be afforded. What is the Opposition's position?\n\nMCMULLAN: Thank you. It is a very important question. It really makes me very angry that Nick Minchin talks about paid maternity leave as middle-class welfare. He has obviously never met the hundreds of thousands of families battling out there for whom this is just basic justice. They are not going to be rich out of paid maternity leave, they are just going to have some chance to make ends meet. I think he has released inflated costings deliberately, to try to turn the debate against the proposition that women in Australian are entitled to continue to be paid when they leave the workforce to have children. We support the principle of paid maternity leave. We will continue to support the principle of paid maternity leave and we will be putting out our costings when we announce the detail of our proposition.\n\nJOURNALIST: Which of those options the Minister has costed does Labor favour?\n\nMCMULLAN: Well, I have a strong view about that but we will be announcing our policy -- and it won't be me announcing it  pretty soon I think.\n\nJOURNALIST: Would the Labor Party support paid maternity leave as an additional impost on the Budget or would you recalibrate other family payments to meet the cap?\n\nMCMULLAN: Well, I will be making a recommendation to the Shadow Cabinet about that, but we will release the detail when my colleague, who is actually responsible for it, makes the announcement. But I can tell you this  we will be putting forward a specific costed proposition to introduce paid maternity leave, we support the principle and we are prepared to put out the detail and back it with our strong support. I know that there will be people who want to argue against it, both from the Senator Minchin conservative position and for all sorts of other arguments, but we think it is right so we are going to support it.\n\nJOURNALIST: Is it your notion to have it in any event or would it have to be done on a no additional cost to the Budget' basis?\n\nMCMULLAN: It won't necessarily need to be done at a no additional cost to the Budget'. No.\n\nJOURNALIST: Would you like to see a full wage replacement or a minimum wage offer?\n\nMCMULLAN: That is a matter of detail that I will be leaving to others to announce. Obviously I have got a strong view but I am not going to be announcing the Opposition's policy on paid maternity leave here  I simply repeat what we said before  we support it, we won't be killing it off, we will be putting forward a specific proposition in support of paid maternity leave. It is only an overdue element of justice. It is a scandal that Australia is now one of the two OECD countries in which women don't get access to paid maternity leave. If that scandal persists until the next election, we will change it when we get in straight afterwards.\n\nJOURNALIST: And if $415 million a year is an over-inflated estimate, what is a more accurate estimate?\n\nMCMULLAN: Something less than that.\n\nJOURNALIST: After President Bush's speech to the UN overnight, do you think that we are any less likely or more likely to end up in a conflict with Iraq?\n\nMCMULLAN: Well I think Simon has really spoken for us on this and I am the economic spokesman but I think every member of the Labor Party would welcome the fact that the matter is now before the United Nations  that is the proper place for it to be considered and that is what we have been calling for and I welcome that, I think that is a step in the right direction but I don't want to duplicate, I heard Simon speaking on our behalf this morning on the radio and I support what he said.\n\nJOURNALIST: But the Iraqi Foreign Minister has already rejected the idea of inspectors going in on an unencumbered basis, it doesn't seem particularly optimistic does it?\n\nMCMULLAN: I haven't heard that but it doesn't surprise me  but there are few twists to go in that. But I think that before it plays out, before the United Nations, and between the United Nations and Iraq, the Security Council hasn't made its resolution yet. Let's wait for that and then we will see what the response is as they seek to implement it. But everybody in the Labor Party would welcome the fact that the matter is before the United Nations  that is the proper place for it to be."
