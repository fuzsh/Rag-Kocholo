The Australian Government is committed to increasing its engagement with the UN, and seeks a greater role for the UN in international affairs.\n\nThe multilateral system plays a critical role in maintaining the rules-based international order that underpins global security and prosperity.\n\nThe Australian Government seeks a greater role for the UN, and co-operative multilateralism, in international affairs.\n\nAustralia is therefore strongly committed to working through the UN, and the multilateral system more generally, to tackle the complex global challenges that no country can address on its own.\n\nThis includes addressing climate change, countering transnational terrorism, and preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nThe Government has worked proactively and constructively since taking office to enhance its engagement with the UN, including through:\n\nPrime Minister Kevin Rudd’s signature of the instrument of ratification of the Kyoto Protocol on 3 December as the first official act of the new Government; and Foreign Minister Stephen Smith’s visit to the United Nations Headquarters in New York during his official visit from 24-27 January 2008.\n\nThe Australian Government supports UN reform in order to increase the efficiency, effectiveness and accountability of UN operations.\n\nWe also support reform of the UN Security Council to better reflect the modern world (including the permanent membership of Japan and India in a reformed Security Council).\n\nVisit by New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark\n\nIn their first formal bilateral meeting, held on 27 February in Canberra, Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd his New Zealand counterpart Helen Clark affirmed that the two governments would work closely on a range of global, regional and bilateral issues, including climate change, the South Pacific and advancement of a single trans-Tasman economic market.\n\nThe prime ministers re-affirmed their commitment to close and comprehensive trans-Tasman relations.\n\nMr Rudd noted that this had assisted both countries’ national interests greatly over a long period of time.\n\nMr Rudd emphasised that the South Pacific presents Australia and New Zealand with major challenges which need to be met in partnership, including with Pacific Island states, taking coordinated development assistance cooperation.\n\nThe prime ministers expressed their concern over developments in Fiji, including government interference with media independence.\n\nMr Rudd and Miss Clark stated their governments’ commitment to advance a single trans-Tasman economic market under the umbrella of the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relationship Trade Agreement.\n\nMr Rudd and Miss Clark agreed Australia and New Zealand would work together on efforts to address climate change, including in international negotiations and in developing domestic emissions trading schemes.\n\nMiss Clark welcomed Australia’s ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and stressed the value New Zealand placed on working with Australia in a combined diplomatic effort in working for a post-2012 international climate change agreement.\n\nSydney is the world’s best city – again\n\nSydney and Melbourne have been rated in the top ten cities in the world, with Sydney ranking number one for the second consecutive year.\n\nThe annual Anholt City Brands Index, which measures perceptions of 40 cities around the world, has again ranked Sydney number one, with Melbourne moving from eight to sixth position.\n\nAccording to the report, although Sydney is not as well known as cities such as London or New York, it still leads the field because of its overwhelmingly positive image.\n\nSydney is perceived as an attractive place with a good climate, welcoming people and excellent amenities.\n\nIt also ranked in the top three cities for employment and business opportunities, alongside New York and London.\n\nMelbourne’s improvement in the overall rankings, coming in ahead of cities such as Barcelona, Vancouver and Berlin, underlines its image as a vibrant, affordable and liveable city.\n\nThe results demonstrate the strong international reputation Australia’s cities have as lifestyle and business destinations.\n\nThe Anholt City Brands Index, published by British public diplomacy consultant Simon Anholt, is based on a survey of over 10,000 people in 20 countries around the world.\n\nThe top ten cities are: Sydney, London, Paris, New York, Rome, Melbourne, Barcelona, Vancouver, Amsterdam, and Montreal.\n\nNews Stories 28 February 2008\n\nAustralia-United States Ministerial Consultations (AUSMIN)\n\nThe Australia-United States Ministerial Consultations (AUSMIN), which were held in Canberra on 23 February, confirmed the fundamental and indispensable nature of our alliance relationship and its centrality to Australia’s security arrangements.\n\nThe AUSMIN consultations are the primary vehicle for the strategic management of our alliance relationship with the United States.

Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte led the US delegation.\n\nThe meeting confirmed that the alliance is enduring; that it remains the bedrock of our defence security and strategic arrangements; and that it is indispensable to our national interest. The meeting also confirmed both countries’ long-term commitment to the alliance.\n\nThe two sides: - exchanged insights on regional and global strategic issues and security challenges, including Iraq, Afghanistan, Weapons of Mass Destruction proliferation and terrorism;\n\n- discussed further strengthening bilateral defence cooperation, which delivers important security dividends to Australia and contributes to regional stability, particularly in three key areas: humanitarian assistance/disaster relief;\n\nintelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; and enhancing joint and combined training;\n\n- and focused on practical cooperation that our two countries can undertake, including to promote stability and prosperity in the Asia Pacific region.\n\nThe two sides agreed that our cooperation on counter-terrorism and capacity-building on maritime security in the region should continue and deepen.\n\nAustralia welcomes conduct of elections in Pakistan\n\nThe Australian Government welcomed the successful conduct of elections in Pakistan and looks forward to working with a new democratically-elected Government in Pakistan.\n\nAustralia’s Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Stephen Smith, welcomed the largely peaceful conduct of parliamentary elections in Pakistan on 18 February and the efforts of the parties to move quickly to establish a broad-based government.\n\nThe successful elections demonstrate the commitment of Pakistan’s people to democracy and represent a serious setback for extremism.\n\nAustralia has important strategic interests in Pakistan and a strong interest in Pakistan’s stability and democracy developments in Pakistan are central to the global fight against terrorism and extremism.

has a permanent population; is likely to have an effective government; and will have the capacity to enter into relations with other states.\n\nWhile there is no international unanimity on recognition, the United States, the United Kingdom, other European countries, and a cross section of non-European countries have already supported Kosovo’s independence, with more to come.\n\nAustralia has strongly urged the leaders of both Kosovo and Serbia to demonstrate resolve and political determination in settling their differences peacefully and has condemned the violent actions of rioters who last week burned part of the United States Embassy in Belgrade and attacked several other missions while calling on the new government in Kosovo to ensure the rights and safety of minorities, as well as to protect cultural and religious sites.\n\nVisit by Foreign Minister to the Solomon Islands\n\nThe visit to Solomon Islands by Minister for Foreign Affairs, Stephen Smith, provided a further opportunity to underscore the fresh start in the bilateral relationship and to strengthen our partnership with the Solomon Islands Government and region on RAMSI.\n\nThe Minister for Foreign Affairs, Stephen Smith, visited Solomon Islands on 21-22 February to attend the inaugural Pacific Islands Forum Ministerial Standing Committee (FMSC) meeting on the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI).\n\nHe was accompanied by the Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs, Duncan Kerr, and the Parliamentary Secretary for International Development Assistance, Bob McMullan.\n\nMr Smith met separately the Solomon Islands Prime Minister, Dr Derek Sikua, and the Niue Premier, Young Vivian, who will assume the Chair of the Pacific Islands Forum and host the annual Leaders’ meeting in August 2008.\n\nMr Smith’s visit closely followed the successful 22-23 January visit to Australia by Dr Sikua and Solomon Islands Foreign Minister William Haomae.\n\nThe Australian Government welcomes the new Solomon Islands Government’s willingness to work closely and cooperatively with Australia on bilateral issues and RAMSI.\n\nThe inaugural FMSC meeting was productive and positive and provided an opportunity to underscore Australia’s ongoing commitment to RAMSI and close cooperation with the Solomon Islands Government and regional partners.\n\nThe Committee underlined the importance of consultation between the Solomon Islands Government and RAMSI to develop jointly agreed development strategies, and endorsed a proposal to jointly develop a Solomon Islands Government-RAMSI ‘Partnership Framework’.\n\nThe Framework will provide a mechanism for mutual responsibility in setting priorities to achieve the Solomon Islands Government’s broader policy objectives by developing mutually-agreed, conditions-based timelines with a view to reducing RAMSI’s engagement in critical areas of government.\n\nArchived News Stories 2008\n\nFebruary\n\n14 & 21 February"
