        "text": "J.R. Campbell\n\nExecutive Director, Design Innovation Initiative\n\nEmail: jrcamp@kent.edu\n\nPhone: 330-672-0192\n\nWeb: www.kent.edu/designinnovation\n\nBlog: www.designinnovationintersection.com\n\nJ.R. Campbell is helping to cultivate the Design Innovation Initiative at Kent State University to support design thinking, project-based learning, technology-infused maker communities and the curation of cross-disciplinary collaborative teams to tackle \"wicked\" problems. Students and faculty from every discipline are encouraged to participate in this intersectional engine for the university. By August 2020, the initiative will be housed in the \"Design Innovation Hub” through the renovation of the old Art Building at the center of the Kent Campus.\n\nCampbell’s first degree was a Bachelor of Science in environmental design (1994), followed by a Master of Fine Arts in textile arts and costume design (1996), both from the University of California, Davis. He then taught textiles, computer-aided fashion design and color theory in San Francisco before being appointed assistant professor in the Department of Textiles and Clothing at Iowa State University in 1998. He was tenured and promoted to associate professor there in 2004. In July 2005, he moved to Scotland to become \"Research Fellow\" at the Centre for Advanced Textiles at the Glasgow School of Art, where he directed research for the Centre, located in the School of Design. While in Glasgow, Campbell completed a postgraduate certificate (PGCert) course in supervising postgraduate (doctoral) research degrees for professionals in art, design and communication from the Centre for Learning and Teaching in Art and Design at University of the Arts London, which was granted in November 2006. He has been a visiting scholar and conducted workshops at the Beijing Institute of Fashion Technology in China and the Auckland University of Technology's Textile Design Laboratory in New Zealand. Campbell came to Kent State University to start his position as professor and director of The Fashion School in July 2009. He stepped away from this role in July 2018 to take on the role of executive director for the Design Innovation Initiative.\n\nCampbell has been researching, designing and creating artwork with digital textile/imaging technologies for more than 25 years. His work pushes the limits of imaging technologies as they relate to clothing, our environment and the human form. Campbell's art/design work has been shown in more than 80 national or international exhibitions, receiving 20 awards, including the International Artist of the Year Award for the South Korean Fashion & Culture Association in 2010. Campbell has consulted for a number of academic institutions as they have integrated the technology into their teaching/research labs, and has published on subjects of design methods/issues, controlling color and integrating the technology into the design process for textiles and apparel.\n\nAt Kent State, Campbell launched his TechStyleLAB (TSLAB) concept in The Fashion School in 2009. The TSLAB functions as a research, teaching and commercial environment to investigate the broadest range of digital textile and fashion design technologies and their implications for new product concepts, business development and sustainable practices. It has become an integrated component of the successful school’s experiential learning environments. Campbell has also been a champion for building study-away programs for students in the fashion school and across the university. He has served as the university’s representative to the National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD) and, in 2014, partnered with KSU LaunchNET to pioneer the largest national, annual college-based “Fashion/Tech Hackathon,” a competitive, team-based event that has hosted more than 150 students from 30+ universities for each of the last five years.\n\nMargarita Benitez\n\nAssociate Professor, Fashion Design & Merchandising\n\nJames Blank\n\nProfessor, Biological Sciences, College of Arts and Sciences\n\nEmail: jblank@kent.edu\n\nChristina Bloebaum\n\nDean, College of Aeronautics and Engineering\n\nChristina Bloebaum, Ph.D., became dean of the College of Aeronautics and Engineering Aug. 1, 2018. Before coming to Kent State, Bloebaum held the Dennis and Rebecca Muilenburg Professorship of Aerospace Engineering at Iowa State University. She joined Iowa State in 2012 and while there served in various administrative positions, including director of the Iowa Space Grant Consortium. Prior to that time, she was the program director for the Engineering and Systems Design (ESD) and System Science (SYS) programs at the National Science Foundation from 2009-2012. She was on leave from the State University of New York at Buffalo, where she had been a member of the faculty, holding numerous administrative and research positions since 1991. Bloebaum's present research area is in the design of large-scale complex engineered systems. She spent much of her career looking at challenges in the Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) field – developing new optimization, visualization and tradespace methodologies for these inherently complex systems. She has most recently been engaged in research on new value-based, systems-engineering frameworks built upon the rigorous foundations of Decision Analysis, MDO and Value Driven Design (VDD).\n\nBloebaum is the 2012 recipient of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) Multidisciplinary Design Optimization Award and a fellow of the AIAA. She was the recipient of the SUNY Chancellor’s Award for Excellence in Teaching, was honored for Notable Contributions to Teaching and Learning at University at Buffalo (UB), was recognized by the SUNY Research Foundation for Excellence in Research, and was named a Visionary Innovator by UB’s office of technology transfer. She was the recipient of the first UB Chair for Competitive Product and Process Design while establishing the New York State Center for Engineering Design and Industrial Innovation (NYSCEDII), for which she was the executive director. Bloebaum was recipient of the prestigious NSF Presidential Faculty Fellow Award, has graduated 14 doctorate students and more than 70 master's students, and has been awarded over $10 million in research funding.\n\nMarie Bukowski\n\nDirector, School of Art\n\nEmail: mbukows1@kent.edu\n\nPhone: 330-672-2192\n\nWeb: http://mariebukowski.com/\n\nMarie Bukowski began her art studies at Carnegie Mellon University where she received her bachelor's in fine arts with a double major in painting and 19th century German literature and a double minor in printmaking and linguistics and rhetoric in 1992. She received her certificate in art history and Polish language from the Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland in 1999. Bukowski went on to receive her Master of Fine Arts with honors with a double degree in painting and printmaking in 2000 from the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nUpon receiving her master's degree, Bukowski took a position in the School of Art at Louisiana Tech University where she was professor of art, graduate program coordinator, and BFA Studio Program Coordinator for 13 years. She served as the director of the School of Art and Design at Southern Illinois University Carbondale for four years and is currently the director of the School of Art at Kent State University.\n\nBukowski became interested in cross-disciplinary work while she was at Louisiana Tech University. In 2010, she became the first Institute for Micromanufacturing Faculty Fellow. The Institute for Micromanufacturing (IfM) and Center for Biomedical Engineering and Rehabilitation Science (CBERS) joined forces to offer faculty fellowships and promote interdisciplinary collaboration between IfM and CBERS faculty and colleagues in other colleges at Louisiana Tech University. This fellowship was suggested based on four questions from IfM faculty: “Why is it that scientific and technological achievements of 200-300 years old look rather outdated, but 100-year-old art (pictures, music, poetry) are perfect? Can artists catch something ingenious which is unavailable to a rational mind? What is this genius? Could we, scientists and engineers, learn just a little from their inspiration?”\n\nDuring this fellowship, Bukowski collaborated with nanotechnologists, chemists and biomedical engineers. This led to a portfolio of highly successful programs integrating students and faculty into enhanced art and science education, by extending the university’s positive cross-disciplinary impact far beyond campus. This experience has been critical to leading the efforts in the School of Art at Kent State to create curricula around innovation focusing on the ARTech Studio (the school’s digital fabrication lab). The School of Art has been able to promote collaboration outside of art, and to stimulate productivity in all fields of endeavor by broadening the understanding of the interactions of technology and society.\n\nKen Burhanna\n\nInterim Dean, University Libraries\n\nEmail: Kburhann@kent.edu\n\nPhone: 330-672-2962\n\nKen Burhanna is currently interim dean of Kent State University Libraries.
