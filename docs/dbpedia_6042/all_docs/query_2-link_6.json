        "text": "When the 1838 Constitution created the office of the Secretary of State, the Secretary was the keeper of the Great Seal and the custodian of the Laws of Florida.\n\nSince that time, the Secretary’s duties have multiplied and expanded. Today, the Secretary of State is Florida’s State Protocol Officer, Chief Election Officer, Chief Arts and Culture Officer, and the head of the Department of State.\n\nThe Department is organized into the Office of the Secretary, the Divisions of Administrative Services, Corporations, Arts and Culture, Elections, Historical Resources, Library and Information Services, and the Offices of International Affairs and Election Crimes and Security.\n\nThe Division of Administrative Services houses the agency’s information technology office and is responsible for keeping our data secure. The division also oversees department finances, human resources, and general services.\n\nThe Division of Arts and Culture is Florida’s state arts agency. It offers grant funding opportunities and other resources that support Florida’s creative institutions and promote Florida’s vibrant arts and culture offerings.\n\nThe Division of Corporations is the central location for business filings.
