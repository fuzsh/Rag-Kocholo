        "text": "Duration\n\nThe program commences at the start of each Spring semester (January) and concludes at the end of the Fall semester (December/January). Spring and Fall semesters adhere to a full-time enrollment schedule, and a part-time schedule during Summer session – a typical summer session runs anywhere between five to six weeks in duration.\n\nOptions\n\nOption A: Prospective candidates who wish to earn their Tier I Certification/MA in Educational Administration at a slower pace that extends beyond 12 months (2.5 academic semesters) are welcome to enroll on a part-time basis by obtaining prior authorization from the program’s coordinator.\n\nOption B: Prospective candidates who do not want to earn the Preliminary Administrative Services Credential (Tier I/Certificate of Eligibility) are eligible to apply and pursue a master’s degree only option.\n\nCalAPA Tier 1 Certification Requirement\n\nAs of May 31, 2019, all candidates who aspire to earn an Administrative Services Credential are subject to CalAPA (similar to EdTPA for teachers). SFSU’s Educational Administration Program embeds CalAPA competencies in its coursework – each CalAPA cycle is supported by two classes (taken progressively as candidates move through the program) to aid candidates toward a successful completion of the CCTC’s CalAPA requirements.\n\nCost\n\nThe cohort model (12 months/2.5 semester) offers considerable savings in tuition and fees, which amounts to approximately $11,500 for the entire program (excluding books) based on the 2019-20 tuition schedule.\n\nCurriculum\n\nThe curriculum includes theory and practice under simulated conditions in the classroom; application and analysis of theory in real-life situations, mostly the candidate’s school and/or district; and application as well as participation in field practicums (EDAD 714 & 892) supervised by a school or district administrator.\n\nCoursework (33 units total):\n\nSemester 1/Spring (12 units): EDAD 713: Administrative Processes (3 units); ISED 797: Seminar in Educational Research (3 units); EDAD 714: Practicum: Site Administration I (3 units); EDAD 763: Law and Education (3 units)\n\nSemester 2/Summer (6 units): EDAD 743: Educational Planning, Technology & Evaluation (3 units) & EDAD 774: Change Processes and Education (3 units)\n\nSemester 3/Fall (15 units): EDAD 723: School Administration (3 units); EDAD 753: Human Resource Administration (3 units); EDAD 784: Special Education Administration (3 units); EDAD 733: Curricular Leadership for Multicultural Education (3 units); & EDAD 892: Internship/Educational Administration II (3 units)\n\nAdmission to Program\n\nAdmission to the program is open to candidates with a bachelor’s degree from an accredited institution and a 3.0-grade point average in the last 60 units of college coursework. Prospective candidates must submit a CSU graduate application: https://www2.calstate.edu/apply/graduate, which includes, two letters of recommendation, a statement of purpose, and transcripts. A faculty committee regularly reviews applications for admission. Educational Administration Program candidates are admitted in the spring semester only. Spring admission to the program allows candidates to finish the program in the fall and enter the university-job pipeline in time for PK-12 early Winter-Spring job announcements.\n\nPreconditions/Requirements for Administrative Credentials: Preliminary Administrative Services (Tier I)\n\n1. Baccalaureate degree from a regionally-accredited college or university (required for admission)\n\n2. Possess one of the following valid credentials:\n\na. a clear or life California teaching credential that requires a baccalaureate degree and a program of professional preparation, including student teaching or the equivalent, and holds an English learner authorization; or\n\nb. a clear or life California designated subjects teaching credential in adult education, career technical education, vocational education or special subjects, provided the applicant also possesses a baccalaureate degree, and holds an English learner authorization; or\n\nc. a clear or life California services credential in pupil personnel services, health services for school nurse, teacher librarian services, or speech-language pathology or clinical or rehabilitative services requiring a baccalaureate degree and a program of professional preparation, including field work or the equivalent.\n\n3. Basic Skills Requirement. Options for meeting the Basic Skills Requirement are explained on the CTC Basic Skills Requirement page.\n\n4. A minimum of five years of successful full-time work experience teaching or pupil personnel or health services, or library services experience (or a combination—please consult item #2 above for a complete list) in public schools or private schools of equal status upon completion of the program. Please note that school substitute service and/or community college experience is not acceptable.\n\n5. A successful completion of (a) SFSU’s Tier I Administrative Services Credential Program, and (b) CalAPA Cycles 1 through 3.\n\nUpon completion of the program, the candidate will receive a Preliminary Administrative Services Credential (Tier I) or a Certificate of Eligibility if an administrator position is not yet secured. The certificate of eligibility authorizes one to seek initial employment as an administrator but does not authorize actual administrative service until an administrative position is secured.\n\nInternship Program\n\nThe internship program is available to candidates who are offered administrative positions and need the administrative internship credential. Entry into this program requires a request from the district office to the Educational Administration Program Coordinator and Chair of the Department of Equity, Leadership Studies, and Instructional Technologies (ELSIT). Intern candidates must meet the criteria for the preliminary administrative services program, as stated above, before assuming internship administrative responsibilities. Internship program candidates enroll in the same courses as preliminary administrative services program candidates.\n\nOut-of-State Resident Tuition Exchange Program\n\nResidents of these Western U.S. States and Territories are eligible to participate in the WICHE-WRGP tuition exchange program, and pay California in-state tuition for the Educational Administration and Leadership MA program. Learn more about the WICHE-WRGP tuition exchange program.\n\nContact an Advisor\n\nFor additional information, please contact Educational Administration Master of Arts and Credential Program Coordinator Dr. Okhremtchouk at irinao@sfsu.edu or Dr. Vincent Matthews at vincentm@sfsu.edu.\n\nELSIT Department"
