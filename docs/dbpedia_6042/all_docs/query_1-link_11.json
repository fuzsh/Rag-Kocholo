        "text": "Monica Attard: He's the ultimate ALP insider and he holds one of the safest seats in the country. And as we head towards an election, he's about to cut loose and head off into the wild blue yonder. He's Bob McMullan, and he's my guest today on Sunday Profile. I'm Monica Attard, welcome to the show.\n\nBob McMullan joined the Labor Party back in the 1960s. He was a little out of the mould then; for starters he was university educated. From there it was up, up and up for the quietly spoken, unaligned Bob McMullan, who's managed three and a half decades in Labor Party politics without being pigeon-holed into a faction.\n\nHe's been involved in every federal election campaign since 1974, becoming National Secretary of the ALP in 1981. Which means, of course, that he was at the centre of the action when Bob Hawke came to power. And he was a minister in the Keating government after nine years in the Senate.\n\nBut after three and a half decades in politics, he's lost his passion for it. So is the upcoming election an event he can't wait for? Or will it be tinged with sadness?\n\nBob McMullan: Yes and no. I mean, I'm looking forward to my new life, but I'm actually very excited about parts of what I'm doing now and I want to finish it before the election. So I have an apprehension that I won't get everything done before the election, but I also have an enthusiasm. So I'm a bit schizophrenic about it.\n\nMonica Attard: So which of the things that you've undertaken now do you actually really desperately want to finish before you leave?\n\nBob McMullan: There are major things that I've put in place like the strategy about assistance for people with disabilities in developing countries. We've got a terrific strategy out there which people around the world have been very kindly saying is the world leading strategy about it. Now we've got to put some flesh on the bones - we've actually got to do it. So I want, by the time I leave, to have the first stages of the concrete implementation plan underway.\n\nMonica Attard: But I assume, as well, that, you know, leaving the parliament after all these years, and leaving politics indeed after all these decades, is going to be tinged by sadness?\n\nBob McMullan: Yes, it is. I never want to say anything critical about the political process. Being part of the debate about how the country should be run is an honorable thing and I've been privileged to be part of it, but I've had enough of it, you know?\n\nSo no, I'm not really sad; I'm looking forward to it. But it's been an enormous privilege, I am so lucky to have had this chance to do it for so long.\n\nMonica Attard: And when you say you've had enough of it, is there a bit of boredom that's crept in there?\n\nBob McMullan: Perhaps that's what it is. I don't think so, but I find some of the small irritations that I've just glided over, over the years, are annoying me more than is reasonable, and I think that's a small part.\n\nMy real reason for leaving is that my passion has moved on from the politics to the development assistance which has been a lifelong interest of mine, and so I'm following my heart really. But I do also find that, as I said, the little things that have always been there -- like being in parliament and the process things that really can be quite annoying -- they've just been trivial annoyances that I've brushed aside. But I find myself worrying about them more than is reasonable, and I never want to be one of those people who sits around complaining.\n\nMonica Attard: And is Question Time one of those small irritations?\n\nBob McMullan: Yes.\n\nMonica Attard: Why?\n\nBob McMullan: Well, mainly because I haven't got a role. Parliamentary secretaries are betwixt and between, you know? You're not a backbencher to ask questions, you're not a minister to answer them, you just sit there.\n\nBut I have campaigned to reform question time, and unsuccessfully, so that annoys me a bit too and I think we can all do it a bit better. But it's very hard. It's easy to say, very hard to do. I think it will happen but, you know, it'll take somebody quite brave.\n\nAnd the problem is not that it's too hard, it's that it's never quite important enough to get to the top of the agenda. Politics is no different to the rest of our lives; the immediate displaces the important, you know?\n\nIt's an important thing but there is no day on which it's the most important thing.\n\nMonica Attard: Well, I mean, you wouldn't be alone in finding Question Time a little irritating. If you could change something, what needs to be changed in Question Time?\n\nBob McMullan: Well I think we need to get rid of all those silly standing orders that limit what the content of questions can be, which no one takes any notice of anyway. Simply limit them by time, so you can ask anything about the public life of a minister; you can't ask about their private life, but anything about their public activities, provided the question is not too long - probably a minute and put some sort of time limit on the answer - and then get rid of all the other pretenses that are seen to be obstacles in the way of just an intelligent flow. That, I think, is the first thing.\n\nMonica Attard: The Dorothy Dixers?\n\nBob McMullan: Well, I think they'd be different if the answers were shorter, you know? The government's entitled to put its view and use ... Question Time is the thing that most people watch and listen to.\n\nMonica Attard: It's the interface, isn't it, between the public and the parliament.\n\nBob McMullan: Yeah, and so the government's entitled to put its side of the story as well, and the government backbench is entitled to be seen and heard. I think getting rid of Dorothy Dixers is a distraction from the main question which is holding the government accountable for its actions, and there shouldn't be procedural impediments in the way of that.\n\nYou can't write a reasonable standing order that precludes half the parliament from asking questions of the government.\n\nMonica Attard: OK, now Bob, you pointed out already that there's, you know, a little bit of frustration there not being on the frontbench, but I wonder whether if you had been given a frontbench position whether you might have stuck round for a bit longer -- perhaps another term?\n\nBob McMullan: I don't know the answer to that question. I think the answer is probably no, I still would have moved on because I think if I'd been minister, I'd have been minister in this area in which I am now working, and I think it probably would have had the same affect on my passion and enthusiasm, but I suspect I probably still would have moved on.\n\nMonica Attard: Which portfolio would you like to have had?\n\nBob McMullan: Well no, this is the area I would have loved to work in, Kevin knew that. When I was on the backbench in my period of temporary political exile and he was shadow minister for foreign affairs, we worked together on development assistance policy. I wrote about it -- it's one of the passions of my life. I've been engaged in it since the '70s.\n\nIf he'd asked me to be minister for something else I think I would have said 'thank you very much, yes'. But he knew this is where I wanted to work and that's why it's been such enormous fun.\n\nMonica Attard: You did at one point say that you wanted to stick around for another term. Why did you change you mind?\n\nBob McMullan: I have to say, in politics, you can't be thinking about going, you can't publicly muse and say, 'well, I think I might leave' -- you have to say 'I'm staying' or 'I'm going'. So I have always said until the day I said I was going, I said I was staying. You don't have any choice.\n\nBut over Christmas and the last few months, I had to think about whether I wanted to spend three more years in parliament, which I thought I did. I'd have been 65 then and that seemed like a pretty good time to finish. But I did feel that my heart had moved on, and my passion was in the development area, not in the political area.\n\nI still care a lot about politics, I care about who governs the country, I care about those issues just like a citizen, but it's not what I want to do with my life anymore. And I thought well I'm young enough to do something new, I'm healthy -- I don't know about fit, but I'm healthy -- let me take a chance at doing something new or else I'll regret it the rest of my life.\n\nMonica Attard: OK. Now Bob, let's talk about what brought you to the Labor Party to begin with. I mean, you came from a working class family and, as I read, neither of your two brothers even got to the end of school because money was in such short supply.\n\nWas it like many before you; a sense of, you know, working class injustice? Was it a desire to change things, shake things up? What brought you to the Labor Party?\n\nBob McMullan: Well, the Vietnam War is the immediate cause, my sort of political philosophy was shaped by my background. And you're quite right; being the youngest in the family I was able to go to university because my two brothers who are equally intelligent, if not smarter, had left school at 15 to go out and work and so the family could afford me to stay on. So that ... probably the luckiest thing in my life was being born as the youngest in the family, because these things wouldn't have all happened to me otherwise.\n\nMonica Attard: And you objected to conscription?\n\nBob McMullan: That's right, I was against the Vietnam War, and then the government tried to conscript me, and I was against that. But it was the war and I was involved in an anti-Vietnam campaign and people said to me, well, if you're really serious about it, you've got to be equally serious about trying to change the government because that's the only way to stop Australia's involvement in the war. And eventually I came to the view that they were right and I joined the Labor Party for that reason. I mean, I always had a broad Labor view philosophically, but that's what actually made me sign the bit of paper in 1967 to join up.\n\nMonica Attard: OK, so when you joined the ALP, of course, it was recovering from a period of disunity and a lack of relevance really in the afterglow of the Menzies era. At that point did you feel a need to modernise the party or change it?\n\nBob McMullan: Yes, I was a young ... not the first day I came in, of course, but over time pretty quickly I became what I thought was a moderniser in the Labor Party -- I hope I've always been one -- and Gough was trying to modernise it and most people of my generation in the party were broadly supportive of the changes he was trying to make. And in Western Australia where I joined there was a lot of resistance to those changes, so that led me to engagement in the organisational part of the party that I never really expected to have.\n\nMonica Attard: And after the Whitlam era, of course, there was a long drought for Labor. Tony Eggleton once commented that it's a pity a large party can't lose without making things worse for themselves. That struck me as such an apt comment, because it's happened notably on both sides, and you've said very recently there's nothing that you miss about being in opposition. But there must be some element of being in opposition after a long period of power which is important and which is renewing, in a sense.\n\nBob McMullan: Yes, I mean, one of my colleagues said in 1996 - flying out from the Canberra airport having been a minister in the government - and they said to him 'What's your reaction?' He said, 'Well, terrible to lose, but it's better than living in a country where you can't,' you know?\n\nOpposition is a fundamentally important part of our democracy, and if that's all you do, it's a job worth doing and you can refresh your policies -- you can go away and think and re-examine.\n\nMonica Attard: But as Party Secretary, I mean, how hard did you find convincing your colleagues that that's what they needed to do?\n\nBob McMullan: I remember talking to a colleague who said you have to look at the Labor Party as the party of semi-permanent opposition -- I have to say I never shared that view. But some did, and they felt that there was an honorable role in the being the voice of good policy and alternative views and occasionally having the pleasant opportunity to implement a few of them. That's never been my view of the world, but it's not a terrible one.\n\nMonica Attard: Is that to say that you see the Labor Party as the natural party of power?\n\nBob McMullan: No, no, I think that we are equal, you know? The country's pretty evenly divided between the two parties; it's why our election's are always close. People always seem to be surprised that as elections get closer the polls narrow - it always happens, federal elections are almost always very close, and I imagine the next one will be too, and that's a healthy thing, and so we ought to aspire to be the government as often as we can be. Because if we believe in what we advocate, we ought to aspire to have the maximum opportunity to implement it.\n\nMonica Attard: Do you think Labor could have handled life in opposition, after Paul Keating lost, with a little more grace?\n\nBob McMullan: In '96 to '98 we were a terrific opposition reflected in the fact that in the '98 election we got 52 per cent of the vote -- nothing unfair, just the quirk of the fall of the dice, we didn't win the election. Then I think we had a pretty gloomy period from '98 through about 2006, I think.\n\nMonica Attard: With lots of leadership changes.\n\nBob McMullan: Yes, and the leadership change was just a proxy for a general sense of malaise. But we did a lot of good policy work in that time and a lot of that is reflected in what has emerged with the Rudd government, and I'm pleased about it.\n\nMonica Attard: But the public perception is -- particularly after Kim Beazley was ousted -- that the Labor Party was just licking its wounds because it couldn't handle being in opposition.\n\nBob McMullan: Well, if you look at the equivalent period: '96 to '98 to 2007 to 2010 -- we didn't change our leaders and they changed theirs three times, we were ahead in the polls most of the time -- they've never been ahead in the polls, and we were leading the debate on some of the important issues in the country.\n\nWe spent a period as a good opposition, we spent a period then as a dreadful one, we'll see what happens if we win the next election what happens to the opposition. But the opposition is appealing to its base intelligently, and that will bring the polls back nearer to equilibrium.\n\nMonica Attard: But you're talking about the current opposition?\n\nBob McMullan: Yes, that's right. Tony Abbott has a strategy of clearly appealing to the party's traditional base and going to things that appeal to core Liberal voters, even if not to the rest of the country, and that's a strategy that will pull your base who want to vote for you, back to you. May or may not be one that wins an election, time will tell.\n\nMonica Attard: So that fact that Tony Abbott is finally getting some traction, it comes as no surprise to you?\n\nBob McMullan: No, elections are always close in Australia. I expected it to happen. Tony Abbott is surrounded by some of the toughest, shrewdest political operators in the country. They know what needs to be done; he is a shrewd politician too.\n\nMonica Attard: OK now, what about the ALP now? I mean, there's a fair number of commentators who think it's got too many political operatives, you know, white collar unionists and political staff as people who are perhaps drawn more to the politics of power than good governance.\n\nBob McMullan: I don't share that view, I mean, you could say that about me, you know? But you judge people not by what they've done, but by what they believe in, what they do.\n\nThere are people who have had other careers for years and been a staffer for twelve months and so they said 'oh, that person's a political staffer, right, but they've been lawyers, they've been whatever'. And if you're like me; I trained as an economist and decided I would use my economics to serve working people working as a trade union official. I don't think that excludes me from being a person who has serious aspirations for the betterment of the country.\n\nMonica Attard: OK. Well, let's look at your very own, very safe seat of Fraser in Canberra. Do you think that Alistair Jordan, the PM's chief of staff, would make a good successor?\n\nBob McMullan: I think Alistair's terrific, but I know he's not interested. I asked him.\n\nMonica Attard: So what's your bet on who might get up there?\n\nBob McMullan: Well, I see the field emerging and there's university professors, lawyers, public servants. There's one who works for the Labor Party, I mean public knowledge -- the Assistant National Secretary of the Labor Party, Nick Martin, is interested and he's a good candidate.\n\nBut most of the other candidates come from different backgrounds; there's a dentist, there's two university professors, there's a woman who runs a community organisation, there's at least one senior public servant, there's an independent consultant in a development area. These are just people who have spoken to me; I'm sure there's a few others.\n\nMonica Attard: OK, now, as we head into the election year with a lot of people commenting, both in the commentariat and in and among the public, that Kevin Rudd is a fairly colourless character. Can I ask you, as somebody who's been there for a really long time, are there any truly colourful figures in the current-day ALP of the ilk of, you know, Bob Hawke or Paul Keating?\n\nBob McMullan: The Keatings and Hawkes don't come along very often, but I actually think there's a lot more in common between Kevin Rudd and Bob Hawke. I think the only two people who really understand that are Kevin Rudd and Bob Hawke.\n\nMonica Attard: Do tell.\n\nBob McMullan: I think they're very similar, but let me come back to that in a moment. I think there are some people ... you look at their performances in the House, you find there are some people like Anthony Albanese, clearly very good at, sort of, scoring a few political points off the opposition and he does it with panache, and there are others who will emerge when their political fortunes improve. You know, people on the backbench who've got a bit of interest and background. People emerge and they always surprise you.\n\nMonica Attard: But there's nobody that you can name that's as colourful as...\n\nBob McMullan: Well, if I was to name them I'd probably do them a terrible disservice. But underpinning your question, there is a fact that modern 24 hour communication cycle does suck the colour out of a lot of politics because you don't get any reward in public life for being colourful, all you do is get attacked.\n\nMonica Attard: It hasn't sucked the life out of Tony Abbott, though; I mean, he's very colourful.\n\nBob McMullan: Well, that's right, I mean I'm sure there are people telling him to be much less colourful than he used to be, that's undoubtedly the advice he's getting, and you already see it reflected in his behaviour. I think you could certainly say Julia Gillard is a very colourful character; I think she captures public imagination, she is articulate and attractive and she's the sort of person who people talk about in the street.\n\nSo I don't think there's a lack of it, but you do get penalised for originality; if you say something that's a bit different, if you say something in a colourful manner, you don't get any points for that. I mean, I think there are some worrying signs about the way politics in reported in Australia -- it's as if it's a sport and the opinion polls are the score, you know?\n\nMonica Attard: But it's conducted like it's a sport.\n\nBob McMullan: I don't think it is conducted like that at all. It's conducted like it's a serious debate about the future of the country -- it's reported like it's a sport, and I think that's a great disappointment. I've never complained about media coverage. I've been in public life for 37 years, I've never complained, I'm not complaining now, I just notice with concern that I think the media reporting of politics trivialises it.\n\nMonica Attard: Well, I don't mean to be too defensive, but as a practitioner it seems to me that spin doctors and press advisors who are hired by politicians make their politicians play like sports men and women.\n\nBob McMullan: It's not that it's not a contest. Of course there's an element of contest about it; there'd be something bizarre in a democracy if there wasn't. And there are people who try to say how can we get the best public presentation out of the position we have, and how can we score points off the other? And it is true that I think that leads to some exploitation of anybody who's a bit colourful. So it is a symbiotic relationship between politicians and the media and it always has been and always will be. Might be better if it wasn't, but I can't see anything you can do to prevent that.\n\nMonica Attard: And was Mark Latham one of those genuinely colourful characters of the parliament?\n\nBob McMullan: I don't really want to talk about him.\n\nMonica Attard: On ABC Radio you're listening to Sunday Profile, I'm Monica Attard, and we're joined by the long serving Labor MP, Bob McMullan, who will retire come the next federal election.\n\nBob McMullan, given your experience as a minister in the Keating government, do you think that Kevin Rudd's claim that his ministers are chosen on merit is questionable, given the performance of the Environment minister, Peter Garrett, over the insulation program?\n\nBob McMullan: Let me come back to Peter, but I am absolutely of the view that any merit-based process would have had Peter Garrett in the best thirty people in our caucus to be in the ministry, and I don't share this sort of current passion for criticising him. But can I go back to your more fundamental question. Clearly I'm obviously not the most objective observer about whether the thirty people chosen were the best thirty, because everybody knows I'd like to be in and I wasn't. So some of the surprise choices he made turned out to be quite well, I think, and I think the team is much more trouble-free than any other government you can think of.\n\nCan I talk about Peter? I think Peter has been both a good Environment minister and a good Arts minister. We're just currently getting a bit of a feeding frenzy. Clever people are exploiting the feeding frenzy to pursue with their own agendas about whether their competitors should be able to import things into Australia and all that sort of stuff, and people are reporting it as if somehow or other it's Peter Garrett's fault. Soon we'll have the fact that there was a traffic accident on the way to somebody putting in a solar panel, and that was undoubtedly Peter's fault -- I mean it's just got ridiculous.\n\nMonica Attard: Somebody like Belinda Neal -- do you think there comes a time where politicians ought to just fall on their sword for the good of the party? Do you think she should go?\n\nBob McMullan: Belinda handled the controversy around John Della Bosca magnificently, and it did her a lot of good in public esteem.\n\nMonica Attard: But what about Iguana Gate?\n\nBob McMullan: Well, these things come and go. I think that did her damage, I'm not a really objective observer of it, but it clearly did her damage, but...\n\nMonica Attard: And if you were national secretary now, would you want her to simply stand down?\n\nBob McMullan: No, that's not my view. I'm not going to go around axing any of my colleagues, but I don't think that she's a person who needs to be pushed out for any particular reason. I hope she's the candidate, and I hope she wins the seat.\n\nMonica Attard: OK, let's move on and let's talk a little bit more intensely about you, because you've expressed an interest in moving into the area of global poverty international development. Any ideas at this point? Is the World Bank perhaps an option for you?\n\nBob McMullan: Well, look I've got lots of ideas. I know this area pretty well and what I do know is career opportunities don't come up on queue and I'm going to be full time occupied with this job until the election, then I'll have a holiday, then I'll have a look and I'll see what comes up. You can't say I want to go here or there. So I think I've got some skills, I think I've got a relatively unique combination of skills and experience and I hope somebody will want to use it. But it is a passion of my life to focus on doing something about the great global inequalities, poverty, the problem of people with disabilities in developing countries, issues particularly around education. But I'm not the sort of person who'd be that good going out to Africa to dig a well. If they want someone to do that, I'd be better raising the money for someone else to do it.\n\nMonica Attard: And would you consider using diplomacy as a means to make that contribution?\n\nBob McMullan: I'm not interested in being an ambassador, no; I meet lots of our ambassadors and they are terrific people, and that's not for me, I don't think.\n\nMonica Attard: I was actually referring more to perhaps a UN body like UNESCO which looks at the area of poverty and development.\n\nBob McMullan: Well, I am a multi-lateralist. There are a lot of multi-lateral agencies, development banks, UN institutions and others where if an opportunity arose I'd be happy to do it. But I don't have a slot to say [oh gee, I'm really aiming to get there'.\n\nIf there was a slot today it would be filled by the time I became available, and I am not going to apply for another job while I'm in this one. This is a full time job, I love being the member for Fraser, and I want to represent those people as well as I can. I enjoy being the parliamentary secretary, I want to do that job full-time and then I'll have a look.\n\nMonica Attard: Bob McMullan, a final question. Recently Senator Barnaby Joyce asked questions about the level and purpose of the almost $4 billion that we spend each year on bi-lateral and multi-lateral aid. Should Australia's international development assistance budget be subject to value for money tests?\n\nBob McMullan: Absolutely it should. We are spending other people's money. I am very committed to significantly increasing our development budget and I'm delighted to have the prime minister's support for that task, but we aren't exempt from the normal scrutiny. We spend other people's money. We have an absolute obligation to spend it efficiently and effectively.\n\nI think on balance we do and we're pretty transparent about reviewing how well we do it, but we could always do it better. Every human organisation can be improved; those things that go to the way we run our aid budget can be improved. I think we're getting the geographic spread of it better, I think we're getting the focus of it better, but we need to keep improving.\n\nMonica Attard: Bob McMullan, heading off in search of meaningful work in the field of global poverty and international development assistance.\n\nAnd that's the show for this week. Thanks for listening and thanks also to producer, Belinda Sommer."
