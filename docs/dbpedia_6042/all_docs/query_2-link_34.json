        "text": "The Center for the Arts is comprised of two buildings connected by an atrium with a continuous skylight. Inside the center are an 1800-seat mainstage theater, a 360-seat drama theater, a 200-seat experimental black box theater, a 150-seat experimental theater, a 200-seat media screening room, video production and sound studios, a general art gallery, a student art gallery, and two dance/performance studios. The center was built to invite all people in the community at large who are involved with and interested in the arts. An arts advisory council promotes and supports artistic programs. More than 150,000 people each year attend performances in the CFA. It is home to the UB Art Gallery and the departments of Media Study and Art."
