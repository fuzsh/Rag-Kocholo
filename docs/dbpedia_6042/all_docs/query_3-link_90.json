        "text": "The Administration Division is under the direction of the Administrative Officer. This division is responsible for preparing the Ontario Fire Department annual budget, overseeing the daily business transactions, processing payroll, purchasing supplies and equipment, and grant management. The Ontario Fire Department receives between $500,000 and $1 million dollars in grant funding annually.\n\nThe Office of Emergency Management is under the direction of the Emergency Manager who coordinates all functions.\n\nThe main function of disaster and emergency preparedness is to ready a community for potential disaster, and then reduce its effects and impacts after the event occurs. Emergency Management is comprised of four key components: Preparedness, Mitigation, Response, and Recovery. This four-part concept was adopted by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the California Office of Emergency Services (CalOES).\n\nMore information about Emergency Management:\n\nDownload the Emergency Preparedness Guide below!\n\nThe Fire Technology Division, a new division to the Ontario Fire Department, is led by our Senior Fire Business Analyst who maintains all things technology related in the Department. Fire Technology works collaboratively with all bureaus and divisions, ensuring the department leverages technology to the maximum extent possible to increase operational efficiency. By monitoring our key performance indicators and tracking department wide statistics and response times, Fire Technology ensures our personnel are able to deliver exceptional customer service each and every day."
