        "text": "The shorthand definition of arts administration is “the business side of the arts.” That’s true, but it goes deeper. Arts Administration is a broad field that connects art, artists, and communities. We ask the question, “How can the arts have a real impact on improving our society? How do we actually make that happen?” We teach students what they need to know to work in this dynamic, fulfilling field, whether they want to work in arts organizations and businesses, start something new in the arts, or have a fulfilling and sustainable career as an artist. The Arts Administration Program at UNC Greensboro is interdisciplinary, with students who want to work in visual art, dance, music, theater, or any of an infinite number of combinations of forms.\n\nProgram Distinctions\n\nAll of our faculty have professional experience in arts administration, with specializations across performing and visual arts, as well as different ways of making and sharing art, from established nonprofit arts organizations to successful solo entrepreneurship. Faculty remain connected to current arts administration practice through their research and giving back to the field through developmental workshops for working professionals and artists.\n\nUNCG is one of only a handful of undergraduate degree programs in Arts Administration in the United States. A special distinction is our optional concentration in Art Museum Studies in collaboration with the Art History department. Majoring in Arts Administration is friendly for transfer students or students switching into the program; the courses specific to the major can be completed in two years.\n\nThe Student Experience\n\nArts Administration classes feature real-world projects so students practice what they’ll actually be doing in professional settings. Internship placements bridge the transition from school to working life. Arts Professionals are regular guests in class and as mentors for class projects. Career exploration and advising within the program happens throughout a student’s time at UNCG. See an ever-growing list of places where Arts Administration students have recently interned here.\n\nStudents in Arts Administration learn about strategy for arts organizations and businesses, programming, community relationships, marketing, communications and sales, fundraising, managing finances and leadership. We teach professional skills needed to succeed, such as communication, teamwork, and professional writing skills. Many of our students double major, usually in one of the other majors available in the College of Visual and Performing Arts. Minoring in Entrepreneurship or Business with the Bryan School of Business and Economics is also common.\n\nAfter Graduation\n\nArts Administration graduates can enter the profession directly after completing an undergraduate degree – and getting experience prior to graduation is possible and recommended through part-time jobs, independent projects, or internships.\n\nSelection of positions held by Arts Administration alums:\n\nDirector of Development, Burning Coal Theatre\n\nPatron Services Manager, Winston-Salem Symphony\n\nDevelopment Officer, Santa Fe Symphony Orchestra & Chorus\n\nEducation and Community Engagement Coordinator, Nashville Symphony\n\nStudents may decide to continue studying to further their career. Graduate programs in arts management, business, law, education, or a specialized degree would all be helpful for a long career. UNCG Arts Administration Alums are also currently pursuing graduate studies at: Goucher College (Arts Administration), the Berklee School of Music (Music Business), University of South Carolina (Art History), UNCG Bryan School of Business and Economics (MBA), and University of North Carolina at Charlotte (Educational Leadership for Higher Education).\n\nAFFILIATED MINORS"
