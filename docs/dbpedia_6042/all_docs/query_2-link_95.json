Do artists have a right to be offensive? Or a duty? Should artists, authors, and musicians abide by a professional code of ethics? Should we avoid or denounce art of an artist who behaves reprehensibly? Who owns a work of art, theatre, literature, music or dance? Is the art market a “pump-and-dump” or a Ponzi scheme? How should we resolve disputes about art that offends?\n\nThe course will take a case-study approach, with an emphasis on contemporary art, music, comedy, dance, literature, and other art forms.
