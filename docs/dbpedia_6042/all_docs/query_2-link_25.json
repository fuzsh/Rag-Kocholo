        "text": "After a national recruitment, seasoned finance professional Dahle Bulosan has been named Director of Administrative Services for the City of Irvine.\n\nBulosan has more than 23 years of progressive finance experience and is joining Irvine from the City of Huntington Beach, where for the past 16 years, he’s held several key finance positions, including Chief Financial Officer.\n\n“After conducting a rigorous assessment process, I’m delighted that Dahle has agreed to join our team,” said City Manager Oliver Chi. “More important than the premier technical finance skills that Dahle will be bringing to our organization is the way in which he leads people. Dahle serves with supreme humility, and his approach is closely aligned with our One Irvine team-oriented values structure. I’m confident that Dahle will be a terrific addition to Irvine as we continue our pursuit of a City that provides an exceptional quality of life.”\n\nIn his director role, Dahle will oversee the Department of Administrative Services and leading a team of 51 staff members responsible for payroll, finance & accounting, treasury, budget, purchasing, and information technology (IT) services. Additionally, the Administrative Services Department, which has an annual operating budget of $30.1 million, is tasked with assessing and responding to fiscal trends, coordinating financial transactions, developing contract standards, and providing IT support. The department also provides staffing support for the Finance Commission.\n\nBulosan holds a Bachelor of Business Administration degree in accounting from the University of Hawaii at Manoa, as well as a Master of Business Administration degree with a focus on finance from California State University, Long Beach.\n\nBulosan will join the City of Irvine January 16, 2023."
