        "text": "All full-time faculty, including those on the clinical, research, and teaching track, are invited to participate in this year’s anonymous faculty satisfaction survey. In the next two weeks, faculty will be offered the opportunity to participate in an independent, research-driven, comparative study of faculty satisfaction that allows benchmarking with peer institutions. It is administered in partnership with the Collaborative on Academic Careers in Higher Education (COACHE). Your unique link to the survey will be sent to you from one of the following emails: coachefaculty@abtassoc.com or coache@gse.harvard.edu.\n\nThis 25-minute survey can be completed in one sitting or saved allowing you the flexibility to complete it later. Due to previous faculty participation, the 2020 COACHE survey resulted in a new parental leave policy and more transparent compensation practices.\n\nVisit COACHE Faculty Satisfaction Survey for more information.\n\nFrom Writing Blocks to Building Blocks\n\nThe Center for Faculty Development and Excellence will host a workshop from noon-1:30 p.m., February 23 that will focus on the common blocks that writers encounter: behaviors, beliefs, and feelings that frustrate your efforts at scholarly productivity. Participants will go through an exercise designed to help assess and understand individual experiences of writer’s block.\n\nWe will also identify and apply ways to chip away at a block and move beyond it. This workshop is presented by Allison Adams, director, scholarly writing and research, CFDE. Learn more and register on the CFDE webpage.\n\nCascade Website Maintenance Training Resources Available\n\nTraining resources are available to faculty and staff who edit and manage department websites via Cascade, the university’s content management system for our websites.\n\nResources include:\n\nWriting for the Web: A 10-minute video reviewing the fundamentals of web writing.\n\nCascade Training Videos: Over 15 videos covering frequently used basic and complex web edits.\n\n1-on-1 Training: For those who prefer or need initial hands-on training. Available via Zoom or Microsoft TEAMS\n\nEmail the Emory College Web Team at ecas.comm@emory.edu with any questions and to access these online resources.\n\nNominations are now open for faculty and student awards given during the university’s Commencement and the Emory College graduation ceremony.\n\n2022-2023 Cuttino Award for Mentoring\n\nThe Cuttino Award is named in honor of the late George Peddy Cuttino, a member of our history department from 1952 to 1984. The successful recipient of this prestigious award will be a regular member of the College faculty and should exhibit a similar record of exceptional mentoring of students.\n\nWe invite nominations from any regular faculty member of Emory College. Your one-page nomination letter should include specific information about the nominee’s record as a mentor at Emory. Send your letter to the Dean_of_Faculty@emory.edu account with Cuttino Award in the subject line. Nominations are due by Friday, March 3, 2023. Those not chosen for the award this year will be held and reconsidered for three years.\n\nPlease take time to identify people most deserving of this important honor.\n\nMcMullan Award\n\nEmory College is soliciting nominations for the Lucius Lamar McMullan Award. The McMullan Award is meant to honor a graduating senior of uncommon stature in the eyes of the Emory community. Academic achievement is an important criterion, but not the sole measure of excellence.\n\nThe recipient should also demonstrate outstanding citizenship, exceptional leadership, and singular qualities of mind and character. The winner of the McMullan Award will receive $30,000 at the time of graduation to be used for any purpose of their choosing.\n\nNominations should be submitted via the nomination form by Thursday, March 2. Please see the call for nominations or email Robert Torre, rtorre@emory.edu, for more information.\n\nBrittain Award\n\nThe 2023 M.L. Brittain Award nomination process led by Campus Life is now open. The award is given annually at Commencement to one undergraduate and one graduate student who have performed the most “significant, meritorious and devoted service to Emory University.” Fall 2023 or spring 2023 graduates are eligible for nomination.\n\nNomination letters should be submitted to Sandra Edwards, sandra.edwards@emory.edu, by Friday, February 17. Please see the call for nominations for more information about the award.\n\nEmory University 2023 Award of Distinction\n\nThe Award of Distinction Program recognizes staff members who have consistently demonstrated outstanding job performance and who have made specific contributions that have impacted their department/school or the university. The recognized honorees will be invited to a special dinner hosted by President Fenves and receive a $1,000 award.\n\nAll regular full-time and part-time staff or post-docs, who have been employed for at least one year are eligible to be nominated for the Award of Distinction. Emory Healthcare employees, faculty, faculty equivalents, librarians and retirees are not eligible.\n\nAll nominations must be received by 5 p.m., Monday, February 13. More information, full criteria, and how to submit nominations are available on the Human Resources website. If you have questions, please contact Melissa Morgan at melissa.morgan@emory.edu."
