        "text": "Across two days last week, Signature Program participants took part in their Mid-Year reflections at Woodside Energy. What an amazing first half of the Program it‚Äôs been! Participants looked inwards as they were joined by David Price, Leadership Coach at Growth Coaching International Pty Ltd. David delved into moral leadership, discussed democratic fragility and unpacked what makes a moral leader. The cohort then participated in a workshop that focused on mental health in the workplace and was kindly facilitated by Tasha Broomhall, Founder and Director of Blooming Minds. The workshop was highly interactive and explored psychosocial safety, as well as supporting and leading in different situations. On Day 2, participants heard from Liz Westcott, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Australia at Woodside. Liz explained the importance of building connections through storytelling with stakeholders. Following a networking lunch with Leadership WA Alumni from Woodside, our participants turned their focus to group working. The cohort have observed, heard and read a lot about the challenges and opportunities in WA over the past 6 months. Participants worked in groups to utilise their reflections and develop community projects that they then pitched in shark tank style presentations! We look forward to watching you continue to develop your leadership in the second half of the Program. If you would like to apply for the 2025 Signature Leadership Program, you can discover more using the link in the comments below. üëá Thank you to our speakers for sharing your knowledge with our cohort, to our Alumni who joined us for lunch and to Woodside for hosting us. #Leadership #LeadershipDevelopment #Reflection #Reflections #MoralLeadership #MentalHealth #Storytelling #Community\n\nFORM ARTS & CULTURAL CONSULTANCY We are currently seeking expressions of interest from artists for four largescale murals that will make up the River Country Art Trail, across the Murray River Council footprint in Regional NSW.

That was a question posed by Wales‚Äô first Future Generations Commissioner Sophie Howe to our audience at the Future Ready Forum: Keynote Address yesterday, and one we will be continuing to explore in our future conversations. Sophie shared her important presentation to Committee for Perth members, which included over 30% young people, about the strategies activated to create a plan for Wales that led to the launch of the 2015 Wellbeing for Future Generations (Wales) Act. Sophie reminded us that success comes from ‚Äòstarting from the perspective of the citizen in terms of co-design‚Äô. She is driven by the need to leave the world better than it is and encouraged us to think about the future we want for Perth, through long-term planning and setting an agenda to co-create the best future possible for generations to come. Students from Curtin University, All Saints' College, Wesley College, Perth, and IDEA, as well as Perth business leaders, were given the chance to ask Sophie questions about making long-term change and how young people can be more involved. A big thank you to Curtin University for hosting another event from our Future Ready Forum series, which explores tomorrow‚Äôs opportunities.

This year marks the seventh anniversary of our program dedicated to nurturing creative learning in Western Australia. March has been an action packed month with the metro PL following on from the successful launch of the regional PL in the South-West a couple of weeks ago. Against the serene backdrop of Matilda Bay, we embarked on a journey of igniting creativity and critical thinking within the curriculum. Our time was filled with collaborative sessions, where Principals, Teachers, and Creative Practitioners worked shoulder to shoulder to brainstorm and craft innovative project ideas aimed at shaping the creative learning landscape in their school communities for the year ahead. It is such a privilege to partner with: Bayswater PS, Belmont PS, Bob Hawke College, Calista PS, Clarkson PS, Curtin PS, Hollywood PS, Jandakot PS, Joseph Banks SC, Kalamunda SHS, Piara Waters HS, Walliston PS, Willetton PS, and Winthrop PS. As we embark on this years creative learning journey, we're deeply grateful to Mathilda Joubert, PhD for her tireless dedication and enlightening professional learning sessions, setting the stage for an another extraordinary year of growth and innovation. Creative Schools thrives thanks to the unwavering support of the Department of Education, Western Australia, Department of Local Government, Sport and Cultural Industries, Healthway and our valued philanthropy partners. #CreativeSchools #InnovationInEducation #formwa #creativethinking #reflectivepractise Laura Motherway Tabitha McMullan\n\nüì£ PERTH DESIGN WEEK | SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT üì£ We're super excited to share that we have a special guest joining us on Wednesday, 20 March, for our Perth Design Week Design, Art & Industry Mixer at FORM Gallery - the immensely talented Global Creative Director, Ken Leung.
