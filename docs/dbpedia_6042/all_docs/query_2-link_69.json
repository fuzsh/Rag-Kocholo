        "text": "The Philadelphia Museum of Art is a registered Pennsylvania not-for-profit corporation, led by a director and privately administered by a Board of Trustees. In June 2022, the Board elected Sasha Suda as the museum’s new director and CEO, marking a shift toward new-generation leadership and a commitment to civic engagement.\n\nThe City of Philadelphia owns the museum’s main building, the Rodin Museum building, the Ruth and Raymond G. Perelman building, and the Mount Pleasant and Cedar Grove historic houses in Fairmount Park. The museum provides administrative services for the Rodin Museum and both historic houses, as well as the Samuel S. Fleisher Art Memorial.\n\nWe are supported by endowments, voluntary gifts, corporate support, private foundation grants, and state and federal grants, as well as by admissions, membership fees, and merchandise sales.\n\nOur fiscal year begins each July 1. Both the Board of Trustees and the Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees meet five times a year.\n\nBorn in Toronto to Czech parents, she studied at Princeton University before completing her Master’s degree in art history at Williams College and her PhD at New York University. Her professional career began at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, where she worked in various roles in the Medieval Department between 2003 and 2011. She returned to her native Toronto to work at the Art Gallery of Ontario, first as an assistant curator, and eventually as Curator of European Art and the Elliott Chair of Prints & Drawings. In these roles, she led major international exhibition projects and spearheaded innovative digital initiatives that presented historical art to audiences in a new light. From 2019 until 2022, she served as director and CEO of the National Gallery of Canada where she led the revitalization of its purpose, vision, and mission and first-ever strategic planning process, leading to advances in digital rebranding, exhibition planning, and external stakeholder engagement, with a focus on justice, equity, diversity, inclusion, and accessibility."
