        "text": "Conference home\n\nReparations for the stolen\n\ngenerations - ATSIC responds\n\nSpeech delivered by Commissioner\n\nMarion Hansen\n\nI would like to thank the Minister, Philip Ruddock, his Opposition counterpart,\n\nBob McMullan, and Australian Democrats deputy leader, Senator Aden Ridgeway,\n\nfor their contributions today. It is now my task, on behalf of ATSIC,\n\nto give a response to the plans outlined by the major political parties\n\nas to how they would move the stolen generations issue forward.\n\nTo assist me, I\n\nhave asked a young Aboriginal mother, Diane Jarrett, who herself is\n\na member of the stolen generations. Diane will demonstrate the point,\n\nas she did so powerfully yesterday at this conference, that the damage\n\ncaused by policies of forced removals is ongoing. The pain, suffering\n\nand trauma are still being felt by the present generations, as well\n\nas the past.\n\nHer story and those\n\nof many others puts lie to any claims that the current Government has\n\nno case to answer. Diane will give her response immediately after this.\n\nI must say, with\n\na Federal election only months away, that the timing of this conference\n\ncould not have been better. It has afforded us all an opportunity to\n\nhear directly from the combatants what they will and won't do if they\n\nwere to win office. I must also say that while I'm not surprised at\n\nthe current Federal Government's response here today, I am still disappointed.\n\nThe Minister had\n\nan opportunity today to look members of the stolen generations in the\n\neye and tell them he has heard and understood their concerns. He had\n\nan opportunity to acknowledge their dissatisfaction with the Government's\n\ncurrent response to the Bringing them home recommendations. He\n\nhad an opportunity to say on behalf of the Government that they have\n\nlistened and learned and they were now prepared to make the appropriate\n\nresponse.\n\nHe could even have\n\nsaid sorry.\n\nInstead, we are\n\ntold what we already know. The Government's response to moving the stolen\n\ngenerations issue forward after four years is \"just say no\".\n\nNo apology and no reparations. It would be wrong to say, of course,\n\nthat the Government is doing nothing.\n\nAs a formal response\n\nto the Bringing them home report the Government is spending $63\n\nmillion on a \"practical assistance\" package for counselling,\n\nparenting support, family reunion and an oral history project.\n\nATSIC has received\n\njust over $11 million of this funding to administer the Link-Up program\n\nwhich focuses on family reunions.\n\nLast year's Senate\n\ninquiry, however, has made it clear that this \"practical\"\n\npackage was not effectively meeting the needs of the people it was meant\n\nto be helping. It also found the package was fundamentally flawed due\n\nto a lack of monitoring and co-ordination. In the light of these findings\n\nhow can the Government persist with its view that it is adequately responding\n\nto the plight of the stolen generations? Why won't it subject its package\n\nto an independent audit of its performance?\n\nI take no joy in\n\nbeing critical of the Government but it has to be made aware of the\n\nfeelings of the people they claim to be helping. The Government should\n\nbe aware that many stolen generations people at this conference believe\n\nthere will be no proper resolution of their plight if it were re-elected.\n\nSome people here\n\nhave also said that only the election of a Labor Government will ensure\n\nthere is real progress made towards the healing of the wounds inflicted\n\non so many of us by the forced removal of children. The reality is of\n\ncourse that Labor has a lot more work to do if it wants to win government\n\nand a lot more work to do on the stolen generations issue as well. ATSIC\n\nwelcomes Mr McMullan's reaffirmation of his leader Kim Beazley's statement\n\nduring May that a Labor government would sanction a national apology\n\nduring the first sitting week of a new parliament.\n\nIt also welcomes\n\nLabor's pledges to convene a national conference of stakeholders to\n\nexamine the best means of \"resolving the consequences of forced\n\nremoval\" as well as giving HREOC an official monitoring role.\n\nI have to say,\n\nhowever, there is still some consternation among our people about the\n\nfailure of Mr Beazley's statement to specifically mention a reparations\n\ntribunal. Labor strongly backed the proposal for a tribunal only last\n\nyear in the majority report of the Senate inquiry into the stolen generations.\n\nWe would be very concerned if Labor were now backing away from this\n\nproposal.\n\nAfter listening\n\nto the Democrats' deputy leader Senator Ridgeway I can only say it's\n\na pity they are unable to form a government in their own right. We heartily\n\nendorse the Democrats' view that all measures in the Senate majority\n\nreport, including a tribunal, should be put into action as a matter\n\nof urgency. We also endorse the Democrats' call for a significant increase\n\nin funding for the Government's current package so as to ensure the\n\nneeds of the stolen generations are better met.\n\nFor ATSIC's part,\n\nwe are very pleased to have worked with HREOC and PIAC in the organisation\n\nof this conference. The contributions made by both international and\n\ndomestic delegates have been outstanding.\n\nThe conference\n\nproceedings have reinforced ATSIC's belief that a reparations tribunal\n\nis the way forward to bring some relief to the thousands upon thousands\n\nof our people who have been damaged by policies of forced removal.\n\nThe current system's\n\nreliance on redress through the courts is costing tens of millions of\n\ndollars and helping no one, except perhaps the lawyers. Legal battles\n\nbring about further trauma for victims, take too long, cost too much\n\nand are based on a non-indigenous framework which is not equipped to\n\ndeal with the issues on hand. We definitely do not want a rerun of the\n\nnative title experience in dealing with these issues.\n\nI also want to\n\nmake it clear that a reparations tribunal should be empowered to deal\n\nwith claims by all of our people affected by forced removal policies\n\n-- not just those who were snatched away from their families. The legacy\n\nof these policies has also directly hurt the descendants and extended\n\nfamilies of the stolen generations members and they are entitled to\n\nexpect that amends will be made to them.\n\nI think is has\n\nnow also been made clear that we are not about seeking some token lump\n\nsum payouts for members of the stolen generations. A reparations tribunal\n\nshould be given the means to provide a wide range of relief measures.\n\nThese measures\n\ncould include counselling, parental education, community assistance\n\nand facilities, family reunion funding, memorials or land as well as\n\nmonetary compensation for individuals.\n\nIt should also\n\ngive all of those afflicted by forced removal policies the chance to\n\ntell their stories in a non-legalistic or adversarial setting.\n\nMembers of this\n\naudience may be aware that ATSIC is committed to a rights-based agenda\n\nwhich in the context of the reparations process has led to the endorsed\n\npolicy position I have just outlined.\n\nOur policy also\n\ndemands that the Australian Parliament formally apologise to Aboriginal\n\nand Torres Strait Islander peoples for the devastating effects of past\n\nlaws and practices which sanctioned forced removals.\n\nATSIC also believes\n\nthat any negotiations with stolen generations' members on the best means\n\nof addressing their issues should be based on the principle of self-determination.\n\nATSIC's rights-based\n\nagenda is firmly based on the foundation of the right to self-determination.\n\nIn this context\n\nit means that all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have\n\nthe right to be included in the design and delivery of programs and\n\nprocesses established to give effect to the Bringing them home report's\n\nrecommendations.\n\nATSIC again thanks\n\neverybody involved in the staging of this important conference. We look\n\nforward to working together with HREOC, PIAC and other interested parties\n\non the detailed development of a fair and viable alternative to the\n\nway things are now."
