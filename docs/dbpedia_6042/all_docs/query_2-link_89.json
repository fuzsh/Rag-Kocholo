        "text": "×\n\nAbout the program\n\nEffective educational leaders strive to create educational opportunities driven by equity and culturally responsive practices to promote their student’s academic success and well-being. SDSU’s Online Preliminary Administrative Services Credential (OPASC) program is designed to help you become a quality-driven school leader, capable of empowering engaged, inspired, and successful learners at all levels of your school community.\n\nRequest Info\n\nDriven by expert faculty from SDSU’s College of Education — ranked #1 in the CSU system and #8 in California by U.S. News & World Report — this program will help you develop your educational leadership skills and knowledge through a combination of online coursework and field experiences. All classes are 100% online and asynchronous. The curriculum is closely tied to the latest California Administrator Performance Expectations (CAPEs) and will prepare you to pass all three CalAPA (California Administrator Performance Assessment) cycles required for licensure as a school administrator in the State of California.\n\nIs This Program Right for Me?\n\nThis program is designed for current education professionals who aspire to become quality-driven school administrators in the State of California. As an aspiring administrator, you’ll learn how to self-evaluate and reflect on your leadership skills by asking essential questions designed to stimulate thought and provoke action:\n\nDo our stakeholders (including students) feel informed, valued, and engaged in creating conditions for all students to aspire and achieve in school and life?\n\nDo my words and behavior as a school leader build trust and communicate, model, and promote our shared vision of engaged, inspired, and successful learners?\n\nIs our student body fully composed of engaged, inspired, and successful learners who can perform at the ambitious academic levels needed to succeed in school and community?\n\nTo successfully join the program and start working towards your Preliminary Administrative Services Credential, you’ll need to satisfy at least one of the following requirements:\n\nA valid California clear or life teaching credential requiring a bachelor’s degree and a program of professional preparation, including student teaching, or\n\nA valid California clear or life Designated Subjects Teaching Credential, provided the holder also possesses a bachelor’s or higher degree from a regionally-accredited college or university, or\n\nA valid clear or life California Pupil Personnel Services Credential, Teacher Librarian Services Credential, Speech-Language Pathology Services Credential, Clinical or Rehabilitative Services Credential, or a School Nurse Services Credential, requiring a bachelor’s degree and a program of professional preparation, including field practice or the equivalent.\n\nBest of all, the program is entirely online and self-directed, which means you’ll be able to access and complete the required coursework in a way that fits into your busy schedule.\n\nWhat Can I Learn?\n\nThrough a series of 7-week online courses and guided field experiences in your community, this online administrator credential program will provide you with the educational leadership skills you need to empower your students and your teachers.\n\nStudent cohorts begin the program in the fall and spring semesters. Each cohort includes approximately 25–35 students, all of whom are working professionals in public or private schools or other educational settings. You’ll complete your coursework in just one year, held over three semesters (e.g., fall, spring, and summer). Your cohort is your learning community — you’ll work together to discuss the coursework, examine day-to-day work-related challenges, and provide encouragement when needed.\n\nYour classes are 100% online and asynchronous. You can expect to spend an average of 10 hours per week on the learning platform and completing coursework. In addition to online learning, you’ll have the opportunity to apply the coursework through a series of field experiences. These job-embedded tasks are designed to help you practice leadership and learn what it takes to become an administrator and meet the challenges facing today’s school communities. Field experiences are required and are supervised by university instructors along with a local site mentor.\n\nLearn More\n\nChoose a Proven Curriculum\n\nIn addition to required coursework and fieldwork, candidates are required to pass three cycles of the California Administrator Performance Assessments (CalAPA) to be recommended for the Preliminary Administrative Services Credential. Our entire program curriculum, including the field experiences, is designed to prepare aspiring administrators for successful completion of the California Administrator Performance Assessments (CalAPA) requirement. You’ll complete a total of three CalAPA Cycles during the program.\n\nTo help you pass your cycles and earn your credential, you’ll have access to additional support systems, including remediation plans and one-on-one faculty support tailored to help you become a better administrator.\n\nMeet Your Faculty\n\nDouglas Fisher and Nancy Frey, experienced leaders in the education industry, have been deeply involved with the development of the Preliminary Administrative Services Credential program. Professor Fisher is the Department Chair of Educational Leadership and oversees the Administrative Services program. Nancy Frey will be co-teaching several courses in the program, including EDL 650, Professional Growth Leadership. Both professors have won Faculty Monty Awards at SDSU and serve the community by teaching and leading at Health Sciences High in City Heights. Fisher and Frey designed the entire learning experience and will be personally involved in the field placement experiences to ensure students get the most out of the Online Preliminary Administrative Services Credential program.\n\nCareer Outcomes\n\nNow more than ever, institutions across the state need strong leadership to guide our schools through unprecedented changes. To meet this demand, California needs highly-educated school administrators who can create growth, foster positive student outcomes, and build equitable learning environments for all members of our school communities.\n\nThe job outlook for school administrators is bright. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were more than 270,000 school administrators employed across the country in 2020.\n\nIn California, job openings for PK-12 administrators are projected to grow by 6% over the next decade, which translates to nearly 2,500 new positions for administrators across the state. Most job openings in California are seeking superintendents, school principals, assistant school principals, and individuals ready to serve in elementary and secondary school administrative roles.\n\nSalary varies depending on prior experience and credentials, local demand, and other factors. In California, annual wages can range from $90,000 for the bottom 10% of earners to nearly $175,000 for top earners.\n\nRequest Info\n\nWhy Should You Choose Us?\n\nExpert Faculty\n\nThe program is designed by a panel of expert faculty from SDSU’s College of Education. Our faculty are locally and internationally renowned for their educational leadership. Many are also teacher-scholars, leading researchers, and active practitioners of the concepts that they teach.\n\nReputation\n\nSan Diego State University has a track record for success in pedagogical education. SDSU was originally founded as a school for teachers in 1897. For over 120 years, San Diego State University has been preparing future school leaders for dynamic leadership roles across the world. Today, U.S. News & World Report ranks the College of Education #1 in the California State University system, #8 among all California schools, and #55 among all universities nationwide.\n\nAccessibility\n\nWe know that today’s educational professionals are busier than ever. All courses are 100% online, self-directed, and can be completed in just one year, which means that you can prepare for your CalAPA cycles and earn your license on your schedule, without putting your professional responsibilities on hold."
