On a personal level, Bob has always been a valued source of advice and mentoring for me over his 22 years of Parliamentary service and prior to that as ALP National Secretary. It was a pleasure to work closely with Bob on parliamentary tactics in the lead up to the 2007 election when he held the position of Deputy Manager of Opposition Business. Among a long list of Parliamentary achievements, Bob served as a Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services, Minister for Administrative Services and Minister for Trade in the former Labor Government. As the Parliamentary Secretary for International Development Assistance in the Rudd Labor Government, Bob has made a significant contribution to the government&rsquo;s efforts to reduce poverty within our region and strengthen our nation&rsquo;s commitment to the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. For more than thirteen years Bob served the Australian Labor Party as a State and National Secretary with professionalism and passion. I wish Bob and his wife Robin well in their future together beyond the Parliament.",
