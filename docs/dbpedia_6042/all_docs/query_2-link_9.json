        "text": "A Message from the Director\n\nWelcome. The Department of Finance and Administrative Services (FAS) is often the public's first interaction with the City of Seattle, operating as a customer-focused front door that assists with everything from paying utilities or reporting a pothole to requesting public information or even adopting a new pet.\n\nThe 500-plus employees of FAS span across 10 divisions and work behind-the-scenes providing critical functions, like managing 120 City facilities—including police and fire stations—overseeing the City's neighborhood customer service centers and Customer Service Bureau, and making sure minority-owned businesses can equitably compete for City contracts. No matter the need, FAS is here—at your service.\n\nKiersten Grove\n\nActing Department Director\n\nWant to learn more about FAS?\n\nView some of our publications and reports about our work.\n\nFacts and Department Overview\n\nFAS Leadership Team\n\nFAS Values\n\nStay Connected\n\nAt Your Service blog\n\nWant to keep track of the latest news and information coming out of FAS? Stay connected and follow our blog.\n\nSocial Media\n\nFAS has gone social! Follow us on Twitter.\n\nContact us\n\nNeed help? Call 206-684-CITY (2489) for assistance and information.\n\nPublic-facing Divisions\n\nConsumer Protection regulates 21 specific business types including short-term rentals, adult entertainment, marijuana businesses, taxis, for-hire or TNC vehicles and others to protect consumers.\n\nCustomer Service leads the City's 311 phone service and serves constituents through its Customer Service Bureau and seven customer service centers.\n\nPurchasing and Contracting manages contracting needs that include bids, public works and over 1200 blanket contracts for goods and services. The division also supports the City’s race and social justice initiative by expanding contracting equity for women- and minority-owned businesses and supporting labor equity on City construction projects."
