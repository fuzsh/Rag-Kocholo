        "text": "The Administrative Services Division is the support for other Divisions in the Department. We are also the âfaceâ of the Department when citizens come to the Police Department and need assistance. We are committed to customer service with our citizens and officers. The Administrative Services Division takes care of accident reports, finger prints, work cards, billings, sex offender and felon registration, and all other clerical support services. Copies of reports can be requested by filling out a report request form. The forms are located in the lobby.\n\nTo request a patrol officer, or to report suspicious people or vehicles or any non-life threatening event dial 702-346-6911.\n\nThe Administrative Services Division can provide police reports to the public according to Nevada State law. It is important to remember that if you are not involved with an incident you will not be able to obtain the report unless a person involved provides written notarized permission for you to pick up the report on their behalf. Other factors may also prevent you from obtaining a police report including, but not limited to, the case status, the type of case, and whether or not there were any juveniles involved with the incident. Any reports taken on juveniles are not in the custody of the Mesquite police department and therefore cannot be obtained through our Administrative Services Division. To obtain a juvenile report you must contact Juvenile Parole and Probation. Please Keep in mind the following when requesting Reports.\n\nReport requests forms are available online under Forms"
