        "text": "The whole \"Preadators rip off\" thing was completely accidental because I had forgotten that they even had gold jerseys when I made this set 8 months ago. And if you look, their jerseys are actually rip offs of the Blues' home and roads. Teams accidentally copy each other all the time. And of course these have different logos, the gold jersey is the ALTERNATE jersey so I used an ALTERNATE logo. But thank you to MDM and the other 250 people that have given this 4 1/2 stars. I like the Blues' third jersey better than their regular set, and would love to see them promote it to full time status along with a matching white version.\n\nI'm in the minority about the Blues - I love the current home/away (I think the royal/navy blue is a great compliment for a team called the Blues) and only like the alternate. That said, these two jerseys added to the current third would be incredible. I love the gold jersey particularly, and I don't think it resembles the Predators' current home jersey any more than the Florida Panthers' home jersey resembles the New Jersey Devils' home jersey - they may be the same color, but the design is entirely different. If anything, this set makes them look LESS like the Predators since the Preds' set is a layout-copy of St. Louis' current set.\n\nI don't want to suggest the Blues making another unique logo (we all remember the Keenan-busted alternates a few years ago), but I wish that St. Louis had a different logo to use for the shoulders. I love the bluenote, but it's not different enough from the suggested crest (bluenote in circle over the Arch) to make them stand apart. Still, awesome, awesome set.\n\nIn the concept, I like the white away jersey more than the gold alternate. Personally though, I love the current home/away jerseys. I really don't want the Blues to make their current 3rd jersey the home jersey. I do like the alternate logo a lot, but the Blues' regular jerseys need to have the large bluenote. It's one of the best logos in the NHL and they need to continue wearing it proudly. If anything, I think the concept white away jersey should be an additional alternate for the road only. Thanks for sharing the concept! GO BLUES!"
