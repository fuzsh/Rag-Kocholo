The Blues made their debut in October 1967 and in 2019 won the franchise's first Stanley Cup championship. In 2020, the Blues were named Team of the Year across all sports by the Sports Business Journal for their success on the ice and the many achievements off the ice, which included the opening of the Centene Community Ice Center, the renovation of Enterprise Center and the hosting of the Honda NHL All-Star Weekend, among other major milestones.\n\nThe St. Louis Blues play in and operate the downtown Enterprise Center and operate the adjacent Stifel Theatre. The St. Louis Blues are owned by a local group of business leaders chaired by Tom Stillman, whose guidance and leadership has been an inspiration to fans and the community overall."
