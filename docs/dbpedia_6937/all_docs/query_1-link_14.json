        "text": "The Blues debuted their new Reverse Retro uniforms last night (additional photos here), and goddamn if they didn’t look like the hottest thing in the league. I mean, look at that — sensational! (Well, except for that jersey ad.)\n\nYou probably know this already, but just in case: The St. Looie RR design is based on a pair of prototype jerseys worn by coach/GM Lynn Patrick and owner Sid Salomon III shortly after the team was awarded an NHL franchise in 1966. By the time the Blues made their on-ice debut a year later, they had scrapped the prototype designs and gone in a different aesthetic direction, but the prototypes have remained somewhat legendary over the years among uniform aficionados.\n\nHere’s how the new RRs looked in action:\n\nMissed last night’s game? No worries — you have six more opportunities to see this excellent uniform. Here are the dates. Meanwhile, here’s hoping the Blues find a way to work this design into their regular wardrobe after this season — it’s too good to be relegated to one-season status.\n\nToday Is Twins Unveiling Day\n\nThe Twins are scheduled to have a uniform-unveiling event at 12:30pm Eastern. I assume it will be streaming on their website.\n\nOnce the new set is unveiled, I’ll write a new blog entry with a summary and some first impressions. Since the unveiling event begins at 12:30, the actual reveal probably won’t be until closer to 1pm, so figure I’ll have something published about an hour after that. See you then!\n\nGift Guide Reminder\n\nIn case you missed it on Thursday, the 2022 Uni Watch Holiday Gift Guide, your go-to source for the coolest uni-related gift items for that special someone on your shopping list (or just for yourself), is now available over on Substack. You can read the first chunk of it here. To read the whole thing, you’ll have to become a paid subscriber, which I hope you’ll consider doing. Thanks!\n\nWhat Paul Did Last Night Yesterday\n\nI took yesterday afternoon off to meet up with an old friend at the New York Public Library’s Lou Reed exhibit, which is a treasure trove of photos, audio recordings, notebook pages, tour artifacts, and just about anything else you can imagine having to do with Reed, all drawn from Reed’s personal archives, which were donated to the NYPL by his widow, Laurie Anderson.\n\nI really enjoyed the exhibit, but it’s more of a celebration than an argument. If you’re a fan, you should definitely see it; if you’re not a fan, it probably won’t convert you.\n\nFor what it’s worth, the exhibit includes two 1970s photos of Lou wearing what appears to be some kind of jersey:"
