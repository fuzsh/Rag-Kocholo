        "text": "On Friday night, the St. Louis Blues officially revealed their 2022 NHLÂ Winter Classic uniformâa vintage throwback to their inaugural look from 1967.\n\nRyan OâReilly and David Perron modeled the new look in video and photos released by the club. Take a peek.\n\nThe jerseys are almost exactly the same as what the Blues wore in their first seasonâexcept one thing. The bright white base has been replaced with what teams like to call âvintage white.â IÂ suppose itâs meant to make us think these jerseys have just been packed away with mothballs for the last 55 years.\n\nThe lack of pure white is meant to evoke a retro aestheticâa core element of the Winter Classic itself. However, thereâs been only one other Winter Classic where both teams wore this off-white hue. It was 10 years ago at the 2012 Winter Classic between the Rangers and Flyers.\n\nBut I digress.\n\nPublicity images aside, the first time the new Blues sweater was seen out in the world came during the ceremonial first pitch of the St. Louis Cardinals game tonightâin honor of the WinterÂ Classic being played on a baseball field, perhaps. Brayden Schenn was there wearing a sweater without the Winter Classic shoulder patch.\n\nWe can also see from photos released by the Blues that this sweater will use the same name and number font as the teamâs 2017 Winter Classic sweater, which has been used as a third jersey since 2018. It makes sense. This new design is the counterpart to that jersey.\n\nAnd thatâs pretty much that.\n\nIn case you missed it, hereâs a look at the 1930s-inspired sweater the Minnesota Wild will don when hosting the Blues next January.\n\nAs usual, Adidas has done a remarkable job in creating a gorgeous aesthetic for the outdoor event. Itâs always something for jersey fans to look forward to and this year will be no different.\n\nAnd as I wrap up, IÂ should also draw some attention to the event logo itself.\n\nWinter Classic logos donât typically account for team colors of the gameâs participants, but this year we get a nice mix of Blues blue and Wild greenâas well as a touch of that wheat/vintage white that weâll see on both uniforms.\n\nIÂ also love that this Winter Classic logo is the first ever to really focus on the pond hockey sceneâthe whole reason this outdoor game even exists. Itâs up there as one of my all-time favorites.\n\nSpeaking of which, hereâs a look at all 13 Winter Classic logos going back to the launch in 2008âto see how the new one fits in.\n\nWhich is your favorite?Â And what do you think of the look of the 2022 NHLÂ Winter Classic?"
