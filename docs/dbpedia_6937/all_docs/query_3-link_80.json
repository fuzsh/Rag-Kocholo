        "text": "ST. LOUISâJamie Rivers, a former Blues defenseman, has been named the teamâs lead TV analyst, according to Bally Sports. He signed a multi-year deal to call the telecasts.\n\nRivers will replace Darren Pang who left the Blues to announce for the Blackhawks.\n\nBally Sports says Rivers will call all local Blues telecasts alongside play-by-play announcer John Kelly. Rivers provided game analysis on 12 games during the 2022-2023 season.\n\nâIâm extremely proud and excited for this opportunity,â said Rivers. âPlaying for the Blues was an honor, and now being able to broadcast Blues games is an incredible opportunity. Iâm excited to continue working alongside John Kelly and the rest of our amazing Bally Sports team.â\n\nRivers, who was drafted by the Blues in 1993 and played 454 games over 11 NHL seasons, began working for Bally Sports over 10 years ago as an analyst during pregame, postgame and intermission.\n\nHe also will continue to co-host The Fast Lane on 101 ESPN Radio where he has worked since 2019.\n\nRivers returned to St. Louis after his playing career, and has worked to develop youth hockey in the region through his work in coaching and skills camps through Synergy Hockey."
