Showcase your team spirit when you hang this panoramic art print that was created from state-of-the-art cameras that capture amazing high definition photos of stadiums, arenas and aerials. This panorama is so clear and life-like, you'll feel like you were there. The art print begins as a high definition photo that is printed on heavy art stock paper to resist waviness and warping from heat and humidity and then topped with a UV resistant coating to minimize fading. If you choose an option to frame this art print, only high quality moulding and tempered glass (like a car window) is used. You will receive a professionally framed art print that will look great and extend the life of your artwork. For indoor use only. Comes ready to hang. Made in the USA.\n\nThis is an Officially Licensed NHL Product.\n\nPhoto Information: This panorama captures the raising of the St. Louis Blues first Stanley Cup Championship Banner above their home ice at the Enterprise Center in St. Louis, Missouri. The Blues were one of the six teams added to the National Hockey League in the 1967 expansion.

The Blues got off to a successful start, reaching the Stanley Cup Final in each of its first three seasons. 2019 marks the first time in franchise history the Blues have brought the coveted Stanley Cup trophy home to their fans.\n\nSizes:\n\nUnframed - 40\"L x 13.5\"H\n\nStandard Frame - 40.25\"L x 13.75\"H\n\nSelect Frame - 42\"L x 15.5\"H\n\nDeluxe Frame - 44\"L x 18\"H\n\nFrame Details:\n\nStandard Frame: The frame moulding is 3/8\" rounded glossy black aluminum.
