        "text": "After Part One and Part Two were so well-received, I hope I don’t disappoint with Part Three!\n\nAs I’ve stated in the previous sections of this series, some teams should NEVER make any changes to their uniforms. To keep with the consistency of redesigning the entire NHL, however, I have switched up every team’s uniforms, even if my designs are admittedly not anywhere near as good as the real ones.\n\nAnd, again, most templates are taken from Bmac’s Blog’s NHL 2012 project. Take a look if you’re into more concepts.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nChicago Blackhawks\n\nWe start off with the team that boasts what may not only be the best jerseys in hockey, but the best jerseys in all of sports.\n\nThe Blackhawks should never make any changes to what they currently wear, but, like I said, I had to do something to keep with the consistency of this project.\n\nFor the home and road jerseys, I took nearly everything good about Chicago’s current design (colors, logos, etc.) and mashed it with the striping from the team’s very first look.\n\nI also eliminated the outlines around the numbers to provide a cleaner, more vintage look.\n\nFor the alternate, I took the current home jersey and replaced the Indian head with the one from the team’s 1957-1965 primary logo.\n\nColorado Avalanche\n\nColorado is in desperate need of a redesign. Keep the logo, go back to the Sasquatch footprint as a shoulder patch, and add a more traditional striping design. The Reebok practice jersey look is still as bad as it was when it was introduced nine years ago.\n\nFor the home and road jerseys, I used Colorado’s current sock design as part of the inspiration.\n\nIf you’re wondering where the rest of the inspiration came from, as well as the entire template for the third jersey, look no further than the very first Quebec Nordiques jersey – back from the WHA days.\n\nDallas Stars\n\nDallas’s 2013 redesign was a successful one. The logo is solid and the new shade of green brought a lot more color to the NHL’s palette.\n\nThe issue with the redesign is that Dallas’s current jerseys look very much like green Chicago Blackhawks jerseys.\n\nHere, I gave the Stars a new design that mixes their current color scheme with their pre-Reebok template: a unique look that everyone seemed to like when it was in circulation.\n\nThe result seems pretty nice.\n\nMinnesota Wild\n\nMinnesota’s green third jerseys have gotten a lot of praise since they were introduced in 2009.\n\nThe only drawback? The current uniforms feature a wordmark (that actually looks pretty decent) other than a primary logo that ranks with the old Hartford Whalers mark in terms of creativity and ingenuity.\n\nTo fix this, I slapped the primary logo onto the third jersey, added a little red to make it pop and created a white version.\n\nNashville Predators\n\nKudos to the Predators for switching to a bright, eye-catching color scheme in 2011 and also doing what no other team had done in decades by making yellow/gold their primary color.\n\nThe only issue with their 2011 redesign was the ugly Reebok practice jersey template, including a tough-to-read number font.\n\nI stuck with Nashville’s current color scheme and logo, but applied them to a cleaner much more traditional template.\n\nSt. Louis Blues\n\nWhen St. Louis revamped its jerseys in 2014, it suddenly became one of the best-looking clubs in the NHL.\n\nHowever, even though the team’s name is the “Blues”, something about the navy blue on its jerseys does not mix well with the royal blue and gold.\n\nI decided to eliminate the navy blue, make gold a bit more prominent, and make a very slight change to the logo by eliminating the navy blue outline.\n\nThese changes can also be seen on the third jersey, which has been immensely popular since it was introduced in 2008. What’s seen here is essentially the same sweater as the one the Blues currently wear, except the jersey is royal blue instead of navy and the blue note inside the circle logo has undergone the same changes as it did on the other jerseys.\n\nWinnipeg Jets\n\nWinnipeg’s current jerseys are decent, but the color scheme used on the uniforms does not match the colors seen in the logo.\n\nHere, I made the jersey’s colors match the ones seen in the logo while giving the Jets a template that seems to create somewhat of an aeronautic feel to fit the team’s name.\n\nThat’s it for Part Three. Hope you enjoyed it! Check back next week for the Pacific Division, which will include the new Las Vegas franchise."
