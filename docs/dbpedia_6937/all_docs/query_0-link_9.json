        "text": "Welcome to our comprehensive guide to NHL team colors, where we dive deep into the vibrant world of hockey's most iconic color palettes. From the fiery reds of the Calgary Flames to the cool blues of the Toronto Maple Leafs, each team's colors hold a rich history and deep symbolism. These colors unite fans and represent the heart and soul of each franchise.\n\nWhen creating a NHL-themed hockey room, you'll want to ensure you get the colors right. That's why we did the homework for you! Below is your cheat sheet of NHL team colours in RGB, HEX, and CMYK values - these colors are applicable for digital design and printing. Further down, you'll find PANTONE values. The Pantone Color System, or PMS, is a standardized color matching system, which is widely used around the world.

The Pantone Color System allows you to specify colors that cannot be mixed in traditional CMYK.\n\nNHL Team RGB, HEX, and CMYK Color Values:\n\nAnaheim Ducks:\n\nPrimary Colors:\n\nRGB: 0, 39,
