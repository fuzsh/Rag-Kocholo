        "text": "The St. Louis Blues made barging into the third round of the\n\nplayoffs last week look as easy as one, two, 2.9. No semifinalist\n\nseemed as thoroughly grounded as the Blues in Stanley Cup\n\nfundamentals: Expert penalty-killing, traffic jams in the crease,\n\ndefensive commitment and solid goaltending were all in evidence\n\nas they swept the Dallas Stars. St. Louis had all the basics\n\ndown, except counting.\n\nWith 2.9 seconds left in the first overtime of Game 3 and a\n\nface-off in the Stars' zone, Blues coach Joel Quenneville pulled\n\ngoalie Roman Turek for an extra attacker, hoping to win the draw\n\nand get a final scoring chance. To his surprise Mike Eastwood was\n\nbooted out of the circle. To his horror the Stars' Mike Modano\n\ncleanly won the face-off from Jamal Mayers and drew the puck back\n\nto defenseman Richard Matvichuk, who slapped it nearly 200 feet\n\nand missed the deserted St. Louis net by inches with .4 of a\n\nsecond on the clock. Quenneville's cheeks turned from playoff\n\npallor to hot pink, roughly the color of the slip general manager\n\nLarry Pleau might have had to consider if the puck had gone in\n\nand dramatically changed the tenor of the series. \"I'm on the\n\nbench and didn't see the puck off the draw,\" Blues defenseman\n\nChris Pronger said, \"and all of a sudden the puck is heading\n\ntoward our net and everybody on the bench goes, 'Woooooo.' Can\n\nyou imagine if we lose like that?\"\n\nThere's a fascination with the time-space continuum in St.\n\nLouis, maybe because it has been 15 years since the Blues made\n\ntheir way through two playoff rounds and maybe because those 2.9\n\nseconds were only a fraction of the 38 minutes and 16 seconds\n\nPronger wasn't on the ice in a match that ended in the second\n\novertime. Pronger played 51 minutes, 10 seconds. Placed in the\n\ncontext of 35 years ago, when teams generally dressed five\n\ndefensemen and often used only four, Pronger's playing 57.2% of\n\na postseason game is hardly unprecedented. In the modern era of\n\nsix defensemen and short shifts, that number borders on the\n\nsurreal. \"I believe he could play a whole regular-season game in\n\nthe right situation,\" Pleau says. \"It would have to be the right\n\nnight, but, yeah, 60 minutes. Just leave him out there.\"\n\nPronger, who was on for all but 30 seconds of a four-minute\n\nDallas power play in Game 2, had averaged 33:48 minutes per game\n\nin the playoffs, more than three minutes greater than any other\n\nskater. Where he spent his rare idle moments--on the bench, not\n\nin the penalty box--was equally noteworthy. He was whistled for\n\n32 penalty minutes in seven playoff games against the San Jose\n\nSharks a year ago. Through 10 games and two rounds this spring\n\nhe had pared it to 24 minutes, including two on a phantom\n\ninterference call early in Game 4 of the series against Dallas.\n\nPronger still can blow up, but he has added discipline to\n\ntoughness and reach and positioning, attributes that could turn\n\nthe Norris Trophy into his personal paperweight in the coming\n\ndecade. \"He's more aware this year of what opponents are trying\n\nto do to frustrate him, to get him off his game,\" Quenneville\n\nsays. \"He's learned that other players will do whatever they can\n\nto get him off the ice.\"\n\nThe surest way to keep Pronger off the ice in the regular season\n\nwas injuries--left knee surgery and a broken left forearm that\n\nsidelined him for more than two months, beginning in late\n\nJanuary. Pronger missed 30 of 32 matches, a stretch during which\n\nthe Blues, the NHL's best team in the first half of the season,\n\nwon only eight. Pronger did not return until April 1, when only\n\nfour games remained in the regular season, but he instantly\n\nbecame the 6'6\" Maypole that a fragile team could dance around.\n\n\"We never really played a lot of games together as a group,\" says\n\nvenerable defenseman Al MacInnis, who was out 23 of the 30 games\n\nPronger missed because of a corneal abrasion to his left eye.\n\n\"There were a lot of injuries down the stretch, and we made some\n\nmoves at the trading deadline. We just wanted to continue playing\n\nand blend everything together, hoping that we would get better as\n\nwe went along.\"\n\nPleau began fiddling with the Blues last summer. His guiding\n\nprinciple was bringing in players with what he calls \"puck\n\ngrit\"--the ability to win battles for loose pucks, to make plays\n\nin traffic, to get to those hard places where most goals are\n\nscored. His first key acquisition was 6-foot, 190-pound free\n\nagent Dallas Drake, a right wing who might be the NHL's best\n\nhitter among players 6 feet or shorter. In February, Pleau\n\nobtained Scott Mellanby, the former Florida Panthers captain, and\n\nat the trading deadline a month later Pleau shed his reputation\n\nfor timidity by making a play for estranged Philadelphia Flyers\n\ncenter Eric Lindros and then pulling off a blockbuster with the\n\nPhoenix Coyotes for Keith Tkachuk.\n\nThe team that played so confidently in the third period with a\n\none-goal lead before putting Dallas to bed 4-1 last Thursday\n\nincluded 10 players who weren't on the team that San Jose had\n\nbullied out of the playoffs a year earlier. Cory Stillman,\n\nanother deadline acquisition, ended Pronger's half marathon in\n\nGame 3 with a 35-foot blast past Ed Belfour. Tkachuk scored the\n\nwinner in Game 4, camping in the crease and backhanding a rebound\n\ninto the net.\n\nThe toughness has spread like a contagion this spring. In St.\n\nLouis's only pivotal playoff moment that hadn't involved an empty\n\nnet in overtime, Pierre Turgeon, never the NHL's poster child for\n\nunbridled determination, spit out three teeth after getting hit\n\nwith a puck and returned to the ice one shift later to set up\n\nDrake's goal late in the third period that tied Game 5 against\n\nthe Sharks. Turgeon, who through two rounds ranked sixth in\n\nplayoff scoring with 12 points, had enough reasons to look back\n\n(he knew Pleau had offered to trade him for Lindros) and to peek\n\nahead (as an unrestricted free agent on July 1, he'll undoubtedly\n\nsign a contract that will pay him $7 million a year). However, no\n\nmatter what occurs in the Western Conference finals, Turgeon\n\nfinally put his mouth where his money is.\n\n\"Last year we didn't go through any adversity, came into the\n\nplayoffs, lost a couple of games and didn't know how to handle\n\nit,\" Pronger says. \"We had to go through the maturation process\n\nof losing before we could start winning.\"\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: PHOTOGRAPHS BY DAVID E.
