        "text": "Bring back AC St Louis!\n\nColors and badge\n\nThe inverted shield features a fleur-de-lis with a golden flame beneath a catenary arch. The fleur-de-lis, a long time symbol of the city featured heavily in the region's iconography, was a symbol of French monarchs including Louis IX of France, for whom the city is named. The flame alludes to the 1904 Summer Olympics which were held in St. Louis as part of the St. Louis World's Fair, and is seen by many St. Louisans to be one of the formative events in the city's history. The arch represents the Gateway Arch, which was built in 1965 as a memorial to the city's placement in American history as the \"Gateway to the West.\" A.C. is an homage to the Missouri Athletic Club, which has promoted soccer in the region for more than 100 years.\n\nBack when the MLS2STL group was originally announced, I too had voiced the hope the city flag colors get used (which worked a lot better when the Cardinals and Blues were directly involved, red/white+blue/yellow = STL flag) since the STL is one of the best flags out there (really, it placed top5 in polls) and other cities/states with awesome flags have similarly had their sports teams use them (Chicago Red Stars with the Chicago flag, DC United with the DC flag, and any UMD team with the Maryland flag).\n\nI would further continue the flag play and hope the team is named the Saint Louis Confluence; I feel like \"Confluence\" is both a nod to the common \"United\" moniker (similar meaning of coming together) while also being nicely Americanized with how unique it is to STL. Then you could have the (official?) nickname as \"the Rivermen\" since \"Confluence\" isn't such a great name to fling around on fan message boards. X-D\n\nWhat's the obsession with wolves? They don't have anything to do with the history or culture of STL.\n\nI don't care how \"cool\" they are, they're a complete non-sequitur for the city.\n\n=edit=\n\nActually, I take it back - there is *one* culture reference with wolves and STL.\n\nIt's the \"Who's on first\"? Abbott and Costello skit.\n\nAll the more reason to stay the HELL away from using wolves. We don't want our team to be looked at in the context of a comedy routine or as a baseball reference.\n\nWolves are badass, wolves work together to hunt their prey. Wolves are badass. Wolves are not used by any MLS Team, Wolves are badass.\n\nLast I checked, there are no Lakes in LA, no Grizzlies in Memphis, no Lions in Detroit or Orlando, or St. Louis, etc etc, that argument, is irrelevant and overly used...Im not suggesting it as an official name, just as a mascot.\n\nJust because something has precedent doesn't mean it isn't completely dumb. Team names and logos should reflect their cities.\n\nAlso, you're completely ignorant of team history if you're using those examples. The Lakers were originally in Minneapolis - in the state known as \"The Land of 10,000 Lakes\". Similarly, the Grizzlies were originally in Vancouver, in the thick of bear country. And even without any actual lions in Detroit, the name was a nod to the fact that the Detroit Tigers already existed, and the new owner wanted his team to be \"king of the jungle\" in the NFL, and Orlando City using lions was also a nod to the historical Orlando Lions team - so at least there's some logic in both of those. I see no logic whatsoever in having wolves with a soccer team in STL. Unless you really want the Abbott&Costello baseball association.\n\nUh, you're making assumptions. I know very well the histories of those clubs. The teams that moved, could have very easily re-branded themselves. So that's not an excuse.\n\nIs still remains, that none of those cities or states have those animals, not the originals nor the ones that are giving a nod, to other teams before them, etc...\n\nHaving a wolf as a mascot would be original for any North American professional team(other than the NBA's Timberwolves).\n\nAnd not to many people over the age 30 are even aware of that movie. But I am and it didnt even cross my mind...\n\nYou're the one making excuses. Right now, for any STL MLS team, you're trying to name/brand a team from scratch. So you *have* to talk about the origins and any related history.\n\nIn fact, if you want to invoke the idea that \"those team could have re-branded\", then you're agreeing with me that when a team wants a new name/brand, it shouldn't be something unrelated to the city.\n\nDoesn't change the fact that people *will* bring it up if it gets even close to becoming a reality."
