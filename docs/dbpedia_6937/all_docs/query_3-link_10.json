        "text": "The St. Louis Blues will be going into the upcoming 2019-20 season with some new items in their cabinet and in their closet as well. For starters, they will be defending the Stanley Cup after making a miracle run from the bottom of the standings to the pinnacle of hockey. They will also have some new uniforms to wear on occasion during next season.\n\nIf you’re already lamenting the loss of the popular throwback-inspired uniforms that they wore as alternate uniforms following the 2017 Winter Classic, don’t worry – they will still wear them for Saturday night home games this season. They aren’t going away for now.\n\nThe new uniforms are actual throwbacks from a decade that is currently popular at the moment. We’ve finally reached a point where the 1990s are deep enough in the rear-view mirror to have something of a throwback craze dedicated to that decade. We’ve seen 90s throwbacks in plenty of other sports and we’re starting to see it in the NHL, as the Blues are the latest team to hop on the craze.\n\nThe Blues will be wearing their blue uniform from the mid-1990s as an alternate uniform for the upcoming season. What makes this uniform stick out from the rest of St. Louis’s uniform catalog is the heavy presence of red. While the Blues had been using red as an accent color since 1984, this was the first time where the color was a major part of the uniform. In an era where plenty of teams in the NHL were forsaking their traditional color schemes in favor of something new, the Blues were doing the same thing and keeping up with the trends of the time.\n\nThis particular uniform didn’t last too long – the Blues only wore them for four seasons until using their third jersey from the 1997-98 season as the basis for their new set of primary uniforms. Still, the bold design choices served as a representation of what the 90s was like in terms of sports uniform trends and so it makes sense that the team would bring it back as a symbol of that decade.\n\nThe short run would also indicate that these uniforms weren’t exactly popular when they were around. Despite having such greats as Brett Hull and Grant Fuhr and even Wayne Gretzky don the uniform with the massive red stripes, the uniforms were polarizing back then (as this local news clipping in Chris Creamer’s coverage of the unveiling proves) and they’ll likely be polarizing today as well."
