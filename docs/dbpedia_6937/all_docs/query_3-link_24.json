        "text": "St. Louis Blues Logo PNG\n\nHockey runs in this team’s blood, so they even adapted music to their favorite sport. Indeed, the club uses the unusual logo of St. Louis Blues – with a stylized note resembling a hockey stick. The players are inspired by such support and gladly take to the ice arena to demonstrate their skills.\n\nSt. Louis Blues: Brand overview\n\nSt. Louis Blues is an American professional hockey team established in 1967 in St. Louis, Missouri. It is part of the National Hockey League, a member of the Central Division, and belongs to the Western Conference. The club emerged as one of the NHL’s expansion franchises. Currently, it is owned by SLB Acquisition Holdings LLC and managed by General Manager Doug Armstrong.\n\nMeaning and History\n\nSt. Louis is the birthplace of blues and jazz – musical genres intimately linked with this city. Therefore, for Sid Salomon Jr., who received the franchise, the team’s name posed no difficulties. He immediately approved the term “St. Louis Blues,” seeing it as an excellent choice for a venue fond of singing.\n\nHis reasoning was manifold:\n\nIt’s part of the region where the hockey team is based.\n\nIt connects with the city’s legendary performers and traditions.\n\nIt’s the name of the famous tune Saint Louis Blues, written by W.C. Handy in St. Louis as he reflected on his beloved one morning.\n\nConsequently, a symbolic element for the logo was unequivocally chosen – a winged blue note. Over the years, the club’s emblem has changed seven times but has always remained linked to the musical theme. Despite redesigns, it accurately conveyed the athletes’ geography.\n\nWhat is St. Louis Blues?\n\nIt’s a professional-level hockey team from St. Louis, Missouri. It’s a member of the NHL, competes in the Central Division, and is part of the Western Conference. The team was founded in 1964. Its home stadium is the Enterprise Center. In 2019, the club won the Stanley Cup.\n\n1967 – 1978\n\nThe debut version contains just one element, being clean, precise, and concise in meaning. It fully supports the team leadership concept: it reflects the connection with the city of blues, which is known worldwide.\n\nThe note is depicted with a slanted stem pointing left. It features an improvised wing – a symbol of ascent, achievability of high goals, and career agility. It consists of four different types of feathers, neatly arranged by length: the largest at the top and the shortest at the bottom. The last element has “down” in the form of two miniature protrusions. All lines are straight, strict, and calibrated. The emblem’s figure has a yellow contour at the edges.\n\n1978 – 1984\n\nIn 1978, the club decided to change. As a result, the emblem gained a circle, enclosing the legendary note. The additional element was made in the same style as the central part. The wide band has a triple border of thinner lines.\n\nAt the top of the field, which simultaneously resembles a vinyl record and a puck, is the inscription “St. Louis,” and below – “Blues.” Blue letters on a yellow background are very legible. The wing also underwent changes: a deep notch at the beginning of the top feather was painted yellow.\n\n1984 – 1987\n\nFor a very short period, the hockey players’ emblem consisted of two separate parts: graphic and verbal. The former contained the musical note but with a red frame. The latter was located at the top and looked like a semi-arch of the word “Blues.”\n\n1987 – 1989\n\nA year later, the club administration approved an updated emblem: the famous winged note with two ends. The developers removed the top inscription, leaving “St. Louis” on the first feather. Moreover, in this version, they enlarged the central detail.\n\n1989 – 1998\n\nIn 1989, the team moved to a logo with an exquisite red stripe along the contour. It was used for almost a decade.\n\n1998 – 1999\n\nAfter another redesign, the club returned to the old version of the emblem, which is still in use. The designers then darkened the blue color, removed the red outline, removed the “St. Louis” inscription, and sharpened the top part of the stem. Moreover, they made all lines clear and even.\n\n1999 – 2008\n\nWith the millennium’s arrival, the shade of the outer contouring stripe on the musical note changed: it became much darker.\n\n2008 – today\n\nIn 2008, the designers adjusted the yellow color, increasing it to a golden hue. No other changes followed.\n\nSt. Louis Blues: Interesting Facts\n\nThe St. Louis Blues, a hockey team from St. Louis, Missouri, are known for their strong history and performances in the NHL. They’re part of the Central Division in the Western Conference.\n\nStarting Out: The Blues were added to the NHL in 1967, making the league bigger and bringing hockey to new places in the West.\n\nWhy “Blues”? The city’s name comes from the song “Saint Louis Blues” by W.C. Handy, showing its deep connection to blues music.\n\nQuick Success: The Blues immediately made it to the Stanley Cup Finals thrice but didn’t win. They were up against some of the oldest and strongest teams.\n\nThe Monday Night Miracle: In 1986, during a crucial playoff game, the Blues came back from a big deficit to win in overtime, keeping their season alive.\n\nA Long Journey: Before 2019, the Blues had waited longer than any other team to win their first Stanley Cup despite making the playoffs many times.\n\nFinally Winning: In the 2018-2019 season, the Blues won their first Stanley Cup, which was a huge deal because they were last place in January.\n\nTheir Look: The Blues’ logo, a blue note with wings, is well-known in hockey. It hasn’t changed much, showing the team’s long history and love for blues music.\n\nBrett Hull: Brett Hull, the team’s top goal scorer, played a big part in the Blues’ history during his time with the team from 1987 to 1998.\n\nBig Rivalries: The Blues have big rivalries, especially with the Chicago Blackhawks, Detroit Red Wings, and Nashville Predators, making for some great games.\n\nHelping Out: Off the ice, the Blues do a lot for their community, like health programs, supporting education, and helping with youth hockey and cancer care through their Blues for Kids foundation.\n\nFrom their early days to winning the Stanley Cup and everything in between, the St. Louis Blues have shown they’re a resilient and important part of the NHL and their community.\n\nFont and Colors\n\nThroughout the franchise’s existence, the musical note was considered the leading element of the logo. In the current version, it’s alone, consisting of a head (oval), stem (leg with a slant to the left), and flag (wing with four feathers).\n\nEarly versions used two types of fonts: a chopped sans serif from the Sans Serif category and a custom broad serif. All letters were uppercase. In the current version, the textual part is absent.\n\nThe emblem’s corporate palette is associated with the hockey club’s name and the color blue, so blue is considered primary. It changed from classic Oxford blue to royal blue. The emblem also features white and Spanish yellow colors.\n\nSt. Louis Blues color codes\n\nFAQ\n\nWhere did the “St. Louis Blues” logo come from?\n\nThe club got its name in honor of W.C.
