        "text": "1967-68\n\nThanks to modern-day travel, it becomes much easier for St. Louis to host an NHL franchise. More than 30 years following the demise fo the one-season wonder Eagles, the St. Louis Blues take to the ice wearing (appropriately) blue (and gold) jerseys. The sleeve and tail stripes on the white jersey would change for the playoffs.\n\n1968-73\n\nThe shoulder yoke becomes longer, extending down into the top of the sleeve. Also, the sleeve numbers on the white jersey go away.\n\n1973-74\n\nThe sleeve numbers on the white jerseys are restored, and the color pattern on the blue jersey's stripes are reversed.\n\n1984-85\n\nThe blue becomes a shade darker, and the blue note is joined by a script logo above.\n\n2008-14\n\nA new navy blue alternate uniform is introduced, along with a new circular crest that features the city's famous Gateway Arch.\n\n2014-16\n\nVertical piping on the primary home and away jerseys gives way to more traditional horizontal striping.\n\n2017-18\n\nWith the notable exception of the numbers changing from gold to white on the home jerseys, the uniforms essentially remain unchanged when Reebok gives way to Adidas.\n\n2018-present\n\nThe Blues dust off their Winter Classic uniforms from 2017 and make them their new alternate, to be worn during Saturday home games.\n\n2017 Winter Classic\n\nThe Blues wore replicas of their original blue uniform as they hosted the Blackhawks, beating them 4-1, in the 2017 Winter Classic.\n\n2021 Reverse Retro\n\nThe Blues go red, going with a recolored version of their 1995-98 road uniforms for their Reverse Retro set.\n\n2022 Winter Classic\n\nJust as it had for their previous Winter Classic appearance, the Blues wore ar replicas of their original uniforms as they took on the Wild in Minneapolis in the 2022 Winter Classic. This time, it was their original (vintage) white uniform that they wore as they won the coldest game in NHL history, 6-4."
