        "text": "Muscat: Alargan Towell Investment Company, one of the Sultanate’s leading real estate development companies, announced the addition of a new phase at the \"Mazar’a Al Harth\" project in the wilayat of Barka.\n\nThe new phase includes 121 residential lands with areas starting from 600 square metres. This addition is due to the success of the project’s previous phase and the sale of all the land areas being done in record time. Nearly 80 per cent of the previously purchased lands are currently being constructed on.\n\nCommenting on the launch of the new phase, Mohammed bin Moosa Al Abri, Chief Executive Officer of Alargan Towell Investment Company, said, “There was an increase in customer demand after the sale of the previous phase’s plot areas. Owing to this, the management decided to launch a new phase to meet the high demand. Additionally, due to the increase in the pace of construction works in the previous phase, 80 per cent of the purchased lands have been handed over to their owners.”\n\n“The region is considered to be one of the most attractive areas for real estate development. As Barka is an extension of Muscat, it offers plots that are reasonably priced, as compared to other regions, especially when it comes to properties launched by Alargan Towell in Mazar’a Al Harth.\"\n\n\"Alongside the availability of basic services and internal roads implemented by the company in the previous phase, the attractive residential plots present a promising investment opportunity. Subsequently, the company’s reputation and the success of its previous projects over the last 15 years have enhanced customer confidence and the desire to purchase plots that are established by the company,” Al Abri added.\n\nNawal Al Nasiri, Sales Manager of Alargan Towell Investment Company, said, “The project is strategically located in the heart of the wilayat of Barka and close to all basic amenities. The company has also allocated plots for the building of a mosque and a park in the centre of the property. Due to its strong relationship with most local banks, Alargan also offers payment facilities. This will enable potential buyers to obtain an easy financing option for their lands and to begin construction in a short time. Additionally, the company offers buyers unique designs for their homes free of charge, if required.”\n\nAlargan Towell Investment Company was founded in 2003 in the Sultanate as a result of the strategic alliance between Alargan International Real Estate Company and the reputed WJ Towell. Alargan Towell activities focus on the creation of quality yet affordable housing opportunities for Omanis in the middle-income bracket. This innovative partnership led to the construction of a number of successful and integrated projects, such as Beyout Al Faye in Al Khoud, Al Waha project in Barka, Mazar’a Al Harth in Barka, Al Mawalih Villa’s project, Al Hail homes project, and Al Qurum Gardens project, along with the new project “Alargan Village- Al Bustan”.\n\nAdditionally, the company is currently in the preparation stage for the Al Nakheel mega development project, which is expected to be the first Integrated Tourism Complex project in the wilayat of Barka.\n\nAs a direct result of their many successes, Alargan Towell has received numerous international, regional and local awards. Most recently, they received \"The Affordable Housing Project of the year 2016\", from the Oman Real Estate Association. The award was given to Alargan for the Al-Waha project in Barka. The company also received the Best Developer Award for Residential Neighbourhoods at the Oman Real Estate Awards, 2015. Additionally, the Al Nakheel project was highly commended at the prominent regional real estate development awards, the Arabian Property Awards, in Dubai in 2015."
