        "text": "01 January 2008\n\nKuwait-based Alargan International Real Estate Company has recently commenced construction work on Saar Gate, its first development project in Bahrain with an estimated value of BD21 million ($55.83 million).\n\nA first-of-its-kind in the country, the project will specifically cater to the needs of the middle-income local families. Located 600 m from the Shaikh Isa bin Salman Road - leading to the King Fahd Causeway - the development will occupy a total area of 54,773 sq m.\n\nSaar Gate will have a total of 102 villas and 184 apartments, split over six towers, each featuring a host of commodities and amenities and is conveniently located close to various facilities and services such as restaurants, post office, supermarket, schools, clinics and shopping centers.\n\nBeing developed by Alargan Bahrain, construction work for the apartment towers is set to commence this month and is expected to be completed by June 2009. The work on the villas, which began in May last year, is nearing completion and will be ready for handover by March 2009.\n\nAhmed Isa Constructions is the principal contractor for the project. The Bahrain-based construction company was established in 1983 and has been involved in property development projects including hotels, housing units and buildings.\n\nCreated by City Engineering, the Saar Gate development will be distinctive in its design. The work of architect designer Majeed Al Sedea evokes traditional Bahraini-style homes with the amenities of a modern lifestyle and contemporary touches, while at the same time maintaining a high level of quality standards throughout the planning, design and execution of the development to ensure that it meets the needs and expectations of the residents.\n\nThe project will also include green areas, parks and gardens to complement the housing units.\n\nThe villas will have three to four bedrooms with a total area of 307 sq m in addition to a living room, storage, hall and dining room, some of which will have the possibility of adding a swimming pool later on, while there will be no less than eight different floor plans for the apartments which will range in size from 128.64 sq m to 181.56 sq m, with two to three bedrooms, as options.\n\nAs one of the leading developers in Kuwait since 1994, Alargan has evolved to become a regional pioneer in high quality residential and commercial development projects.\n\nMore Stories\n\nOmagine appoints CCC as contractor\n\nOmanâs Blue City breaks ground\n\nUpdate\n\nGulf GRC gets into the big league\n\nOriental set to open $10m printing press\n\nSatlub to set up lube plant at KAEC\n\nL&T Oman secures $190m deals\n\nWorkshop focuses on SCC benefits\n\nAlargan starts work on $55m Saar Gate\n\nPDREC launches Platinum Tower"
