        "text": "Share\n\nTweet\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nEmail\n\nOnce complete, the new bridge will boost connectivity around the Telal Al Qurm community\n\nOman property developer Alargan is set to break ground this month on a new low-water bridge – technically known as an ‘Irish’ bridge – within its Telal Al Qurm development in Muscat.\n\nTelal Al Qurm is a signature project by Alargan, providing a lifestyle-themed community in the heart of the city. The mixed-use development includes over 1,500 apartments and 46 townhouses, as well as 190 serviced apartments. The picturesque setting is complemented by two four-star hotels with a total of 370 keys, an aqua park, cinema complex and commercial spaces.\n\nBreaking ground on August 20, the four-month ‘transformative’ Irish bridge project will adhere to the strict Oman Highway Design Standards 2017.\n\nThe approval was granted following a comprehensive hydrology study, which will ensure structural stability and efficient water flow during rainy seasons and all year round. The implementation of meticulous drainage measures will further optimise surface water drainage.\n\nAlargan has gone beyond the development’s land boundary, showcasing its dedication to community development by solely funding the Irish bridge connection in the public domain.\n\nThe bridge, measuring 4x4m with 27 cells, will play a pivotal role in establishing an uninterrupted connection to Telal Al Qurm throughout the year, ensuring the safety and security of the residents in the new development as well as the neighbourhood and the general population.\n\nCommenting on the milestone, Engineer Maher Joujou, Acting General Manager of Telal Al Qurm, said: “At Alargan, we consistently strive to enhance the living experience for our valued residents and investors. Safety remains a paramount concern, making it a top priority throughout the bridge’s development. The approval of the Irish bridge reflects our unwavering commitment to creating thriving communities with top-tier infrastructure and safety.”"
