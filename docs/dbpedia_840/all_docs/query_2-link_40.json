Traditionally, Burgan Bank has been a leading participant in the growing bond arena,” said May Al-Mudhaf, Burgan Bank’s chief investment banking and treasury officer.\n\n“The bank continues to achieve excellent returns for its shareholders, and is expected to strengthen its top-line performance, having witnessed a growth in its loan portfolio across commercial and private financial services segments.”\n\n“Such transactions are vital to encourage companies who enjoy high capital adequacy ratio rates to issue bonds as well as sukuks to be able to achieve their desired levels of liquidity, Furthermore, the bank is keen to offer a wide array of investment products for its clients and the opportunity to participate in Alargan’s bond issue was one of them” added Al-Mudhaf.\n\n“The issuance of this bond comes at an opportune time as we witness a renewed growth of the local bonds market, more so for the real estate sector,” said Khalid Al Mash’an, chairman and managing director of Alargan International Real Estate Company."
