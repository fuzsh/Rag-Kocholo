The resources will be used to finance an initial project to develop and manage residential and commercial space in Casablanca.\n\nFollowing this operation, Alargan plans to pursue its achievements by borrowing from banks and wants to mobilize nearly 2 billion dirhams for new projects. The firm, which is also involved in the management and rental of tourist facilities, wishes to enter the social housing sector in Morocco."
