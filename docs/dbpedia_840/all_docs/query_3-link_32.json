        "text": "Global View\n\nAccording to a business research company, the real estate global size in 2021 was $3.4 trillion. It is expected to grow to $3.7 trillion. The International Monetary Funds forecast the global real gross domestic profit to have a 3.7% growth from 2021 to 2023. In 2021, the Asian Pacific region was ranked top in the real estate market, followed by the North American area.\n\nThe facility management service global market in 2021 was valued at 1,239.99 Billion US Dollars, as reported by Fortune Business Insights. It is expected to rise to about 1.9 Billion US Dollars by 2030, according to Precedence research. North America holds the fastest-growing market size in facility management. At the same time, Asia leads in the highest revenue holder due to standard structures and surge in demand.\n\nAfrica\n\nAccording to a report by Business Day archive, the gross asset value of Africa’s real estate sector is 113 Billion Euros, accounting for 1% of the world’s total value.\n\nAccording to the Egypt Ministry of Planning, Egypt saw a growth (approximately $10 billion in sales for 2021; an additional $500 million in foreign investment) with an 8% growth. Despite economic challenges, Kenya has a resilient boost in investment and foreign market attraction. It is expected to rise to 5.9% in 2022 from 5.2%in 2021 (Kenya National Bureau of Statistics). In addition, there is global business confidence in the real estate industry, as seen in Nigeria, South Africa and Ghana’s real estate market. Meanwhile, with stable progress, Africa’s size for facility management has been forecasted to grow to around 7% from 2021 to 2025.\n\nGhana\n\nGhana’s real estate sector has expanded over the past three years due to a concentration of developers operating in mid to high-end segments, the arrival of non-resident Ghanaians, and foreign investors such as Grit, a REIT and GREA, a German corporate finance and investment management firm. Before the pandemic, the real estate sector’s contribution to GDP was robust due to growing transaction volumes and an increase in the supply of real estate assets. Most real estate transactions in the Ghanaian market are concentrated in Accra and Kumasi.\n\nAn estimated 42.1% of Ghanaians own their dwelling unit, while 29.7% live rent-free. Typically, Ghanaians prefer to build and own their houses incrementally, which accounts for the moderation in land use intensity. Numbers from the Centre for Affordable Housing (CAHF) indicate that compound houses account for 57.3%. In comparison, detached and semi-detached houses account for 28% and 4.7% respectively. Huts and flats account for 4.8% and 3.3%. As high-interest mortgages are the order of the day, the government continues to support affordable homes by easing access to housing credit for government workers. As a result, developers focus on the middle to high-income segments of the housing market.\n\nThe strength of the 2018 and 2019 economy led to an increased demand for Grade A offices as the government made the business environment more welcoming for multinational companies. This contributed to an over-supply of office buildings. Goldkey properties completed the PWC tower in January 2020.\n\nKenya\n\nReal estate added 525.7 billion Kenyan shillings (KSh), approximately 4.7 billion U.S. dollars, to Kenya’s GDP in the first half of 2021. The annual value added by the sector in 2020 was measured at 996 billion KSh (over 8.8 billion U.S. dollars). It has overall increased since 2016. Kenya GDP: Real Estate data was reported at 280,646.000 KES mn in Mar 2022.\n\nThis increased from 272,197.000 KES million from Dec 2021.\n\nThe thriving tourism industry in Kenya positively impacts the growth of the hospitality sector and, subsequently, the real estate industry and facility management. Thirteen new hotels were projected to be introduced in the country by 2021, invariably increasing the demand for facility management services.\n\nAccording to the MarkNtel Advisors’ research report titled “Kenya Facility Management Services Market Analysis, 2020”, the Facility Management market is projected to register a CAGR of around 7% during 2020-25.\n\nThe demand for integrated facility management services is expected to rise in the years to come. The single and bundled service providers captured the highest share in the facility management market in 2019. However, the domestic and foreign end customers are more attracted to integrated facility management providers. The ease of contract negotiation, lower cost, and best-in-class services have led to an inclination of the large corporations toward integrated management. Therefore, the demand for integrated facility management services is expected to rise in the years to come.\n\nNigeria\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics, Nigeria, the real estate sector in 2020 accounted for around $7.3 billion, 6.39% of Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Profit (GDP). This makes Nigerian real estate valuable. However, the housing deficit in Nigeria is 20 million units, the highest in Africa, according to research. The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs report suggests that about 700,000 thousand units of houses ought to be built every year in Nigeria to contain the high demand for housing.\n\nNigeria’s facility management size was valued at $8,446.0 million in 2019 and is expected to reach 12,662.1 Million USDollars in 2027.\n\nAccording to a UN report, the Nigerian market evaluation for facility management growth will surpass 6% by 2025. The Federal Capital Territory (FCT Abuja, tops the charts in Nigeria and is suggested to become Africa’s fastest-growing real estate city. It was valued at $8,446.0 Million in 2019 and is expected to rise to $12,662.1 million by 2026. Also, the Nigerian in Diaspora Commission (NIDC) has partnered with the Federal Mortgage Bank (FMB) to launch the Diaspora Housing Scheme.\n\nSouth Africa\n\nThe South African real estate industry generated total revenues of $22.4 billion in 2020, according to a report by Research & Market, which represents a cumulative annual rate of change (CARC) of -2.2% between 2016 and 2020. Between 2016 and 2020, the industry’s consumption volume expanded with a CAGR of 2.5%, reaching a total of 4.3 million units in 2020.\n\n15.6 million South Africans are estimated to be between the ages of 20 and 34 by statistics. Some will make their market debuts as first-time purchasers if a correct economic opportunity arises. Others who already own a home are learning how valuable real estate can be in building wealth. As a result, they are beginning to develop real estate portfolios rather than moving up to a bigger home as their next step.\n\nIn 2020 according to a Modor Intelligence report on “South African Residential Real Estate Market”, a sizable portion of South Africa’s affordable housing stock was made up of housing provided by the government. Government subsidies now account for over 31% (2,204,041) of all homes in the nation, up from 29% in 2009. Compared to Gauteng, which has the lowest percentage of government-subsidised housing (27%), the Northern Cape has the highest rate (47%) across all the provinces.\n\nThe South African facility management market is anticipated to expand at a CAGR of 3.4%, according to the Mordor Intelligence report, during the forecast period 2022-2027.\n\nThe main factors influencing the growth of the facility market include rising demand for outsourced facility management, infrastructure improvements, and private sector investments. As a result, the FM industry’s services have become largely interchangeable commodities. Additionally, because end users are so sensitive to pricing, contracts are designed to be shorter in duration. Customers have been cutting back on FM services due to pressure on rent returns brought on by an oversupply of real estate."
