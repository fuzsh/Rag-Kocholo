It will include an artificial lake covering 35,000sqm and an entertainment centre, as well as the aqua park.\n\nThe complex is being developed in a mixed-use resort style, with a number of leisure amenities planned. These include three hotels with a total of 530 keys, as well as residential properties – a mix of 259 villas, 55 townhouses, 266 apartments and three serviced apartment buildings with 476 units. The development will also feature commercial properties including a traditional mixed-use souq and a shopping mall.\n\nDuring the launch of Phase One, the developer said the project will be ready within 10 to 15 years, and will offer a total of 1,436 residential apartments, villas and town houses to both citizens and expatriates, the ONA report said.\n\nThe scope of work for Phase One includes the construction of the crystal lagoon, along with other recreational facilities, a 188-key four-star hotel and the souq. In addition, several apartments and residential villas will be built, as well as internal roads and other infrastructure works.\n\nThe launch event was attended by Minister of Heritage and Tourism Salim bin Mohammed Al Mahrouqi along with senior officials of Alargan Towell Investment Company including Murtadha Ahmed Sultan, a primary investor in the project, Khaled Al Mashaan, CEO and Vice-Chairman of Alargan International Real Estate Company and Mohammed Moosa Al Abri, CEO of Al Nakheel project.\n\n“The project aligns with the ministry’s plan to build a diversified tourism sector that meets the needs and requirements of the domestic and regional tourism industry,” remarked Al Mahrouqi.\n\nIt will enhance competitive capabilities of the country, combining natural, historical, cultural, heritage and social elements that are unique to the Gulf region, he added.\n\nAccording to Sultan, the project aims to strengthen infrastructure of the tourism sector, increase the number of hotel rooms, create rewarding employment opportunities for Omanis, and achieve other goals that are related to the development of the tourism sector in the sultanate in line with Oman Tourism Strategy 2040.\n\nOn the upcoming project, Abri said: “It aims to create a tourist destination in Barka that is attractive to citizens, residents and tourists visiting Oman.\n\n“In addition to the Crystal Lagoon and its other design characteristics, the Al Nakheel ITC project will be distinct from other ITC projects by virtue of reasonable pricing of residential units which will be within the reach of citizens and residents alike,” he concluded."
