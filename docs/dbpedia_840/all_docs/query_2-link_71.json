Glad to see that both my bank (NBK) and my telecom company (Zain) are at the top.\n\n(The number on the right column is the company‚Äôs rank in the Middle East, not in Kuwait)\n\nI got an email from the sweet Danderma (Many thanks to her) notifying me that my blog is on the list of top 100 blogs in Kuwait! I could have never imagined! I have just started blogging 3 months ago and I‚Äôm already ranking at #70!\n\n3 months..in blogging time..equals like 3 weeks hehe. It‚Äôs well known that a blogger has to be VERY patient to get more interaction and views. And that‚Äôs what I had in mind. I wasn‚Äôt expecting any ‚Äúacheivements‚Äù in such short notice!\n\nI can‚Äôt thank you enough. You, my readers, are the reason why I‚Äôm on that list. I haven‚Äôt put the best of me in this blog yet. You wait and see in summer. And I have even bigger plans after I graduate inshallah.\n\nCongrats for the fellow bloggers on that list.
