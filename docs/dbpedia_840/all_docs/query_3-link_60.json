        "text": "Capital standards report that “the real estate sector in Kuwait experienced unparalleled growth during 2000–2007. Post 2007, however, the performance of the sector has remained lackluster.” The contribution of the sector to GDP in Kuwait has been roughly 3.7%.\n\nFurthermore, Capital standards says that 3 major segments private residential real estate, investment properties and commercial properties contribute (53%, 28% and 15%) to Kuwait’s total transaction value. Residential real estate has been the least touched by the crisis fueled by the demand from the growing local population. Currently, there are at least 90 000 application pending under the housing scheme of the government.\n\nThe residential real-estate will continue to suffer from lack of supply as per Law no.8 stipulating that only 3-4% of the land in Kuwait can be put to residential properties. The commercial real estate will continue to head downward as more office space is poised to hit the market. Kuwait Stock Exchange (KSE) has 50 listed companies operating predominantly in real estate sector, 14 of which claim to be Shariah compliant, says Capital standards.\n\nThe industry is heavily indepted as a result of the events. Majority of real estate companies in Kuwait are owned or co-owned by the large Kuwaiti investment holdings.
