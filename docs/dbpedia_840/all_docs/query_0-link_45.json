        "text": "Muscat: ALARGAN, proudly announces that its esteemed CEO, Engineer Khaled Al-Mashaan, has been awarded for his commitment and contribution to the real estate sector at the Muscat Exhibition and Forum for Tourism Investment Opportunities, held at the Oman Convention and Exhibition Center on August 7th. The award reflects not only Mr. Al-Mashaan’s exemplary leadership but also ALARGAN’s commitment to transforming communities through sustainable and empowering developments.\n\nFor over three decades, Mr. Khaled Al-Mashaan’s expertise in civil engineering and real estate development has been instrumental in guiding ALARGAN’s remarkable journey. Founded in 1994 as a family-owned contracting business, Mr. Al-Mashaan’s visionary leadership transformed ALARGAN into a pioneering real estate development company, boasting an expansive portfolio of affordable housing and commercial outlets across the GCC region.\n\nAs a responsible business, ALARGAN strives to empower societies and create sustainable developments that positively impact communities. The company takes immense pride in being the first and only company in Kuwait to obtain the LEED (Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design) Platinum Certification for the design and construction of its headquarters located in ARGAN Business Park. This prestigious certification, awarded by the US Green Building Council (USGBC), reflects ALARGAN’s commitment to environmentally friendly and energy-efficient practices.\n\nALARGAN’s dedication to sustainability extends beyond its headquarters, as demonstrated by the development of the first LEED Platinum home in its Telal Al Qurm project in Oman. Under the LEED for Homes rating system, this groundbreaking project showcased sustainable design features such as solar power generation, contributing to lower energy, water, and material consumption.\n\nIn pursuit of innovation and collaboration, ALARGAN has fostered a successful partnership with W.J Towell from Oman, resulting in the construction of several integrated and thriving projects. These include the Al Hail homes project, Beyout Al Faye, Al Qurm gardens project, and the Al Waha project. Currently, the company is gearing up for the Al Nakheel project, anticipated to be the first integrated tourism project in the Wilayat of Barka, marking another significant milestone in ALARGAN’s progressive journey.\n\nLooking to the future, ALARGAN is excited to introduce its flagship project, Al Nakheel, a master-planned community that harmoniously fuses various amenities and luxuries for residents, visitors, and children. With a 5-star hotel, two 4-star hotels, and 514 serviced apartments, the community offers an abundance of facilities for everyone. The project’s convenience is enhanced by its close proximity to a shopping mall, mixed-use souk, and commercial spaces, along with awe-inspiring attractions like the Aqua Park and Crystal Lagoon. Al Nakheel also includes a school, further reinforcing its commitment to creating an optimal and holistic community.\n\nThe award bestowed upon Mr. Khaled Al-Mashaan is a testament to his exceptional leadership and ALARGAN’s commitment to shaping sustainable communities in Oman. ALARGAN expresses its gratitude to the Oman Chamber of Commerce and Industry for organizing this prestigious event, celebrating industry leaders who champion innovation, sustainability, and the future of real estate development."
