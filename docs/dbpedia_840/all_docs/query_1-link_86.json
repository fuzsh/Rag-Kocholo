        "text": "Muscat: After the commencement of construction works at Alargan Village Al Bustan project last May, Alargan Towell Investment Company, the developer of the project, has offered potential buyers the opportunity to visit the location.\n\nThis is to allow them to view the progress of the operations and the steady development of construction works that are expected to be completed. It is expected to start handing over the units to the new owners in the fourth quarter of 2019.\n\nStating the advantages of the village, Mohammed bin Moosa Al Abri, CEO of Alargan Towell Investment Company, said, “Everyone knows that living in Muscat is the goal of most people looking for their dream house. This is because living in the capital reflects positively on the economic and social level of the family since Muscat comprises some of the largest proportion of businesses, economic, social and educational activities in the Sultanate.\"\n\n\"This step may be a big investment for several people, but which is beyond their buying ability. Therefore, we at Alargan Towell, step in to offer the best solution to this challenging issue by offering reasonable choices at Al Argan Village, with affordable prices suitable for everyone,” he added.\n\nThe project, which comprises 44 villas, is located at a strategic location close to Al Bustan Beach and the major attractions of Muscat such as Majlis Oman and Al Bustan Palace Hotel, and is expected to be open in the fourth quarter of this year. It is only seven kilometres away from Ruwi commercial area and Muttrah Corniche and its traditional market that is a major attraction for citizens, residents and tourists.\n\nThe developing company has launched a campaign to publicise its project. The campaign took place in MGM and will continue until next October. Those willing to purchase, can find out more about the project by visiting the company’s suite on the first floor next to Starbucks for inquiries and reservations. They also can visit the project site to see the progress of the construction works first-hand.\n\nThe average construction area of the residential units is some 200 to 235 square metres for a villa of two-and-a-half floors and it includes three bedrooms, a reception area, and a spacious living room. In addition to a kitchen and three bathrooms, there is an extra room with a bathroom on the third floor that can be used as a maid’s room. Each villa also consists of a small private garden and one parking lot, with the possibility to expand it into two, if required by the owner.\n\nNawal Al Nasiri, Sales Manager at the company, said, “There seems to be significant interest from customers in this project, where a number of units were sold before the start of the construction work. We are expecting a high demand in the coming weeks, after the start of the construction work, which will promote client confidence in the project and its schedule.\"\n\n\"The booking system provided by the company to its clients will enhance the attractiveness of the project for large segments of people looking for affordable options and prices, in an area that is considered among one of the most expensive areas in the capital,\" he added.\n\n\"Additionally, the banking facilities agreed on between Alargan Towell and most operating banks in the Sultanate has enabled those wishing to purchase housing or to invest, to complete loan transactions easily,” he said.\n\nAlargan Towell Investment Company was founded in 2003 in Oman as a result of the strategic alliance between Alargan International Real Estate Company and the reputed WJ Towell. Alargan Towell activities focus on the creation of quality yet affordable housing opportunities for Omanis in the middle-income bracket.\n\nThis innovative partnership led to the construction of a number of successful and integrated projects, such as Beyout Al Faye in Al Khoud, Al Waha project in Barka, Mazar’a Al Harth in Barka, Al Mawalih Villa’s project, Al Hail homes project, and Al Qurum Gardens project, along with the new project, “Alargan Village- Al Bustan”. Additionally, the company is currently in the preparation stage for the Al Nakheel mega development project, which is expected to be the first Integrated Tourism Complex project in the wilayat of Barka.\n\nAs a direct result of their many successes, Alargan Towell has received numerous international, regional and local awards. Most recently, they received \"The Affordable Housing Project of the year 2016\", from the Oman Real Estate Association. The award was given to Alargan for the Al-Waha project in Barka. The company also received the Best Developer Award for Residential Neighbourhoods at the Oman Real Estate Awards 2015. Additionally, the Al Nakheel project was highly commended at the prominent regional real estate development awards, the Arabian Property Awards, in Dubai in 2015."
