        "text": "28 May, 2014 / News\n\nOman is all set to add yet another dimension to its tourism collection in the form of a huge lagoon in Barka that will be developed by Crystal Lagoons Corp., the creator of massive crystalline lagoons in the world.\n\nThe four-hectare lagoon will be built within the Barka Resort on the shores of the Sea of Oman, which is being developed by the Alargan International Real Estate Company.\n\nThe project is scheduled to break ground between the third and fourth quarter of 2014 and is expected to be complete by the end of 2015, Crystal Lagoons CEO Kevin P. Morgan told the Times of Oman.\n\nMorgan said the development will help accentuate the exquisite beauty of Barka, which is emerging as a tourist resort.\n\n“The Crystal Lagoons phase of the project will cater to both, local residents and tourists, in Oman.\n\nCrystal Lagoons will allow visitors to experience the beachfront lagoon where they can enjoy all sorts of water sports and activities such as swimming, sailing, kayaking, windsurfing and so on,” he said.\n\nHe added, “The Crystal Lagoons concept creates an idyllic beach environment, whether it is on existing beaches that may not be suitable for swimming, inland and urban locations or even deserts. These are some examples of where Crystal Lagoons has been able to develop lagoons of unlimited scope at low construction and maintenance costs.\n\n“Our experience has shown that Crystal Lagoons adds tremendous value to any destination’s tourism proposition by attracting large numbers of visitors who will create demand for accommodation and food and beverage.”\n\nCrystal Lagoons is currently building the world’s largest crystalline man made lagoon in Dubai.\n\nCrystal Lagoons Corp. is an international innovation company, founded by scientist Fernando Fischmann, that has developed and patented technology that allows for the low-cost construction and maintenance of unlimited size bodies of water in crystal-clear condition.\n\nSource\n\nTags: Crystal Lagoons®, Fernando Fischmann\n\nTe puede interesar"
