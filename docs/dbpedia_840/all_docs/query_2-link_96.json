        "text": "Capital Intelligence Ratings has raised the Rating on the KWD 26.5 million five-year bond issued by Alargan International Real Estate Company (ARE) in April 2012 to ‘BBB’. The Outlook for the Rating is revised to ‘Stable’.\n\nThe principal factor supporting the upgrade of Alargan’s bond is that there are already clearly identified resources in place to repay this particular obligation.\n\nThe rating upgrade also reflects the increase in equity and the fall in debt that has resulted from the successful exit from an erstwhile associate.\n\nMore generally, Alargan (profile) continues to enjoy a sound financial profile, a geographically diversified business model, and a good funding structure – there is almost no reliance on short-term bank borrowing (although the bond issue itself has now become a current liability).\n\nThe main constraints on the bond rating remains the size of the company, in balance sheet terms, and the risk profile of the sector in which it operates, although ongoing changes to the business model have already begun to lower the overall risk profile.\n\nThis process will continue, with the proportion of revenues coming from recurring rental income steadily increasing over time.\n\nWhile profitability has in the past been neither a supporting nor constraining factor, it has been consistently sound, while the effect of the results in 2015 in lowering leverage are a supporting positive.\n\nMore generally, the company has had in the past a good earnings track record and the change to the business model to build up a larger base of recurring rental income is also a supporting factor.\n\nSet against this, however, is the fact that the shift in the business model will have the effect of reducing revenues in the near term and this will impact full year 2016 profitability – and possibly that of H1 2017 as well.\n\nAlargan is a small company in purely balance sheet terms, but – to a certain extent – its size reflects the corporate structure that had in the past been used for development projects, whereby most were held off-balance sheet through special purpose vehicles with their own non-recourse (to Alargan) financing arrangements.\n\nWhile any real estate development business involves risk, Alargan has generally sought to reduce this risk through development partnerships, through the financial and funding structures selected, and through the sale of developments while they are still in the construction phase.\n\nNonetheless, risks remained. Alargan has always sought to further mitigate these by keeping the exposure to any single project or financing vehicle as low as possible and this will continue to be the pattern in the future for development activities, especially outside Kuwait.\n\nThe new business model adds activities that are generally lower on the risk spectrum for real estate.\n\nThe intention is to steadily build up a portfolio of income producing properties.\n\nIn Kuwait this will be through developments by Alargan itself.\n\nIn non-MENA markets this will be through taking small individual stakes in larger income-producing and fully let assets in mature markets in Western Europe and North America.\n\nThe fact that secured borrowings still remain contributes to an element of structural subordination – although this has steadily reduced as almost all secured borrowings outside the main funding facility have been repaid.\n\nThe amount of such remaining borrowing is not considered large enough to impact the rating, while its maturity structure (more than three-quarters is repayable after the maturity date of the bond) is also a significant positive.\n\nIn addition, Alargan has a solid balance sheet with improved financial ratios, which are forecast to remain strong throughout the short remaining life span of the bond.\n\nAfter a very strong 2015, 2016 will see a sharp reduction in both net profit and profitability.\n\nEven stripping out a large disposal gain from the comparison, the current year will be somewhat lackluster in terms of earnings.\n\nThis, however, in large part reflects a much more liquid balance sheet and the timing of expected revenues from the sale from ongoing developments.\n\nHowever, next year should hopefully see a rather stronger performance.\n\nThe changes that are taking place in the business model will mean that the revenue streams become steadily more predictable over time – and less ‘lumpy’ – as the proportion of recurring rental income steadily rises.\n\nAlargan expects post 2016 net profit going forward to improve on higher rental income and from the gains on sales.\n\nIn terms of balance sheet, overall debt will rise in 2017 as leverage is added to the non-MENA investments in income-producing properties.\n\nThis will raise leverage a little but the forecast leverage ratios are at a comfortable level.\n\nFunding risks will also reduce as additional borrowings to buy non-MENA income producing assets under the new business model are linked, in that the asset will come packaged with pre-arranged long-term local-currency funding in the country concerned.\n\nAlargan International Real Estate Company was established in March 2002, but the origins of the group date back to 1994. The company was listed on the Kuwait Stock Exchange in July 2007.\n\nCapital Intelligence Ratings (CI Ratings) can be found at http://www.ciratings.com/."
