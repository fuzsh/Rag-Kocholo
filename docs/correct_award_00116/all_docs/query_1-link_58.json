Title: John Galsworthy Letters Dates: 1909-1931 (bulk: 1909-1910) Quantity: 1 folder (SC) Abstract: Letters (7) of the English dramatist, novelist, bound in a single volume to H.S. Salt concerning a pamphlet entitled \"The spirit of punishment\" (1910), which Galsworthy was writing for the Humanitarian League on the solitary confinement of prisoners. Also, a single letter (1931 Apr. 25) to Eugene Gantner. Language: English Repository: Special Collections Research Center,\n\nSyracuse University Libraries\n\n222 Waverly Avenue\n\nSyracuse, NY 13244-2010\n\nhttps://library.syracuse.edu/special-collections-research-center\n\nBiographical History\n\nJohn Galsworthy was an English dramatist and novelist. Educated as a barrister at Harrow and New College, Oxford, he instead decided to travel, attending to his family's shipping business abroad, and then began writing. His first book, From the Four Winds, was a collection of short stories published under the name John Sinjohn, a name he continued to write under until 1904. Particularly notable works include The Forsyte Saga (1906-1921) and its numerous sequels, A Modern Comedy and End of the Chapter. Galsworthy won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1932.\n\nScope and Contents of the Collection\n\nSpanning 1910 to 1931, the John Galsworthy Letters comprises eight items of correspondence of the English dramatist and novelist (1867-1933).\n\nThe collection includes a single bound volume containing seven letters written between 1909 and 1910 to Henry Stephens Salt of the Humanitarian League. The letters concern a pamphlet, The Spirit of Punishment (1910), which Galsworthy wrote on the treatment of prisoners. (Gift of Sol Feinstone)\n\nThe collection also contains a single letter (1931 Apr. 25) written to Eugene Gantner in which Galsworthy declares:\n\nTo take me for a propagandist is a shallow point of view. My themes raise debate no doubt, but when I've turned the ground over, the only conclusion that emerges is that it would be well if human beings had more tolerance and power of understanding. If that, indeed, can justly be called propaganda, I plead guilty, not otherwise.\n\nAlso included is a copy of the letter by Gantner to which Galsworthy was responding.
