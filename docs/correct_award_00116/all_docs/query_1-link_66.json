        "text": "The 107th Nobel Prize for literature, the richest literary prize in the world, is awarded today. Over it's history, the prize has been awarded to works in over 25 different languages.There have been 10 British winners (including one British prime minister) four joint wins, 13 female recipients, one Yiddish winner and two writers who have declined the substantial prize.\n\nThe award has not been without controversy, with prominent and successful writers often rejected in favour of more obscure choices and selections often tainted by political bias. The Prize has, however, celebrated some of the finest literary output of the last century.\n\nW.B. Yeats (1923): The beloved Irish poet was awarded the prize \"for his always inspired poetry, which in a highly artistic form gives expression to the spirit of a whole nation\". Reflecting this, Yeats claimed that he accepted the award \"less as an individual than as a representative of Irish literature.\"\n\nErnest Hemingway (1954): One of the most significant writers of the twentieth-century, Hemingway was awarded his Prize in recognition of an individual work. The Old Man and the Sea (1951) was singled out as an example of his \"mastery of the art of narrative.\"\n\nJean Paul Sartre (1964): Sartre was the second writer to decline a Nobel Prize, out of a habit of refusing all official honours. The first was Boris Pasternak in 1958 who initially accepted but then was forced to decline, under pressure from his native Soviet Union. Sartre refused as he felt it was wrong for a writer to turn himself into \"an institution\" yet was selected for having \"exerted a far-reaching influence on our age\".\n\nSamuel Beckett (1969): The avant-garde playwright and novelist was honoured for his writing, which \"in new forms for the novel and drama - in the destitution of modern man acquires its elevation\".\n\nGabriel Garcia Marquez (1982): The magic realist novelist, and auhor of the highly acclaimed One Hundred Years of Solitude (1967), was honoured for \"his novels and short stories, in which the fantastic and the realistic are combined in a richly composed world of imagination, reflecting a continent's life and conflicts\".\n\nWole Soyinka (1986): was the first African in Africa and in Diaspora to be honoured with a Nobel Prize for literature. The Nigerian writer was chosen for his works which \"in a wide cultural perspective and with poetic overtones fashion the drama of existence\".\n\nElvyind Johnson and Harry Martinson (1974): The choice of the joint prize for these Swedish authors was an unpopular one. The Prize has long been criticised for favouring European authors, particularly authors from Sweden, as the award is granted by The Swedish Academy. The relatively unknown Johnson and Martinson, who were both Nobel Prize judges, controversially beat Graham Greene and Vladimir Nabakov to the award.\n\nDario Fo (1997): Viewed as one of the least worthy winners, Fo was primarily a performance artist who had been censored by the Roman Catholic Church. What made his selection even more unpopular was that he succeeded over other, more established, writers: Salman Rushdie and Arthur Miller. Rushdie's rejection was widely criticised and two academy members resigned over its refusal to support the writer after a fatwa was issued against him in 1989. The selection of Fo was defended by the academy, however, who awarded the prize on the grounds that Fo: \"emulates the jesters of the Middle Ages in scourging authority and upholding the dignity of the downtrodden\".\n\nElfriede Jelenik (2004): Jelenik herself believed that she should not have received a Nobel Prize. She believed she had only been chosen for \"being a woman\" and praised her competitors instead. A member of the Swedish Academy, Knut Ahnlud, shared Jelenik's belief and resigned over her selecton, claiming she had \"done irreparable damage\" to the prize.\n\nHerta Muller (2009): The academy believed that the Romanian-born German novelist was deserving of the award for she \"with the concentration of poetry and the frankness of prose, depicts the landscape of the dispossessed\". Others were not as convinced and the selection of Muller was heavily criticised for returning the award to its Eurocentric bias.\n\nRuyard Kipling (1907): The first British author to be awarded the prize, Kipling has become something of an institution. The prize was awarded \"in consideration of the power of observation, originality of imagination, virility of ideas and remarkable talent for narration\". Kipling remains the youngest Nobel Laureate for Literature, receiving his award at 42.\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw (1925): The Irish-born writer has often been heralded as the most significant British dramatist since Shakespeare. He was recognised: \"for his work which is marked by both idealism and humanity, its stimulating satire often being infused with a singular poetic beauty.\"\n\nJohn Galsworthy (1932): The prize is typically awarded in recognition of a writer's life's work. On nine occasions, however, the prize was given to recognise a single piece. Galsworthy's The Forsythe Saga in 1932 was among these.\n\nT.S Eliot (1948): American-born Eliot, acclaimed poet and literary essayist, received the award in recognition of his \"outstanding, pioneer contribution to present-day poetry.\"\n\nBertrand Russell (1950): The philosopher and social critic was decorated for his humanitarian focus and his championing of \"freedom of thought.\"\n\nWinston Churchill (1953): The only British prime minister to receive a Nobel Prize for Literature, recognised for his historical and biographical description, specifically in his works The Second World War and A History of the English Speaking Peoples.\n\nWilliam Golding (1983): received the 1983 prize \"for his novels which, with the perspicuity of realistic narrative art and the diversity and universality of myth, illuminate the human condition in the world of today.\"\n\nV.S Naipaul (2001): the Trinidadian-British writer is best known for his focus upon the legacy and impact of British colonialism. He was recognised in 2001 for \"incorruptible scrutiny in works that compel us to see the presence of suppressed histories\".\n\nHarold Pinter (2005): The acclaimed and beloved playwright and screenwriter was honoured for his plays which force \"entry into oppression's closed rooms\".\n\nDoris Lessing (2007): The oldest recipient of the award, at 88, Lessing was named \"that epicist of the female experience, who with scepticism, fire and visionary power has subjected a divided civilisation to scrutiny\". She is one of twelve women to win the award, the first was Selma Lagerlof in 1909."
