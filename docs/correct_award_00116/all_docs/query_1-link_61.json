John Galsworthy was a renowned English novelist and playwright born in 1867 who came from a wealthy family but did not practice law. He had an affair with his cousin's wife Ada Pearson and later married her in 1905. Galsworthy published his first works under a pen name due to his father being alive but later published under his own name. He is best known for his novels like The Forsyte Saga about British upper-middle class society and the changing social roles of the time. Galsworthy used his writing to advocate for various social causes and received many honors like the Nobel Prize in Literature before his death in 1933.",
