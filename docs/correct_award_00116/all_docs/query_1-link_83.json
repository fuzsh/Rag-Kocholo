        "text": "________\n\nOn or about December 1910, a ferment of debate began over the aesthetics of modernity in general and the form, function, and scope of the novel, more specifically. This was not exactly a cataclysmic moment of rupture and dislocation; rather, this marked the beginning (more or less) of a literary quarrel over the \"proper stuff of fiction.\" This context deserves review in reconsidering Galsworthy's role in it. H. G. Wells, who was considered one of the \"greatest names in English literature at the time\"6 (and who considered himself an innovator), argued in \"The Contemporary Novel\" (1911) for an approach to novel writing that was unhampered by conventions. According to Wells, the novel was \"a discursive thing\" (\"a woven tapestry of interests\") and demanded for the novelist the \"right to roam\"—to have a \"free hand\" and \"unrestricted field\" in \"his choice of topic and incident and in his method of treatment.\"7 On the other hand, in \"The Younger Generation\" (1914), Henry James criticized the \"contemporary novelists\" (Arnold Bennett and Wells, particularly) for their tendency toward narrative \"saturation\" and over-\"documentation.\"8 Notably, Woolf would later claim such materialism-in-style criticism as her own when she began taking potshots at her literary forebears. These debates, carried out in lectures, journals, and small literary magazines, continued for two decades, with Woolf's \"Modern Fiction\" (1919) and \"Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown\" (1924) emerging as the most influential, enduring texts in shaping our later twentieth-century understanding of the modernist transition.9 Curiously, there has been insufficient critical attention to the [End Page 432] ways those two pivotal essays were not only in dialogue with, but also derivative of other voices—particularly Galsworthy's—in the ongoing debates over modernity and the aesthetic ideals of representation.10\n\nIt was during the early 1920s, when Galsworthy's status as a literary titan was at its height, that the so-called literary quarrels began. Desperate to achieve the literary status that her Edwardian rivals enjoyed, Woolf instigated the dispute:\n\nif we speak of quarrelling with Mr. Wells, Mr. Bennett, and Mr. Galsworthy it is partly that by the mere fact of their existence in the flesh their work has a living, breathing, everyday imperfection which bids us take what liberties with it we choose.… [They] have excited so many hopes and disappointed them so persistently that our gratitude largely takes the form of thanking them for having shown us what they might have done but have not done; what we certainly could not do, but as certainly, perhaps, do not wish to do.11\n\nAnd Woolf's obloquy does not stop there: \"the sooner English fiction turns its back upon them, as politely as may be, and marches, if only into the desert, the better for its soul.\"12 Woolf was not alone in her churlish attempt to supplant her formidable literary rivals. Several years later, Lawrence issued a vindictive philippic on Galsworthy specifically.13 Echoing Woolf's claim that the distinctive feature of Edwardian fiction was its \"lifelessness,\"14 Lawrence alleged that the characters of Galsworthy's magnum opus The Forsyte Saga are either \"abstractions\" or \"corpses.\" They \"have no blood and bones,\" Lawrence alleged, and \"their emotions are, faked, faked.\"15\n\nLawrence's disdain for Galsworthy was nothing new. His scathing attack was the culmination of years of seething animosity: \"We have to hate our immediate predecessors, to get free from their authority.\"16 Though Lawrence was referring to Galsworthy's stature (along with Strindberg and Ibsen) as the leading dramatists of the era, this hostility would continue to fester over the next fifteen years as Galsworthy's literary reputation and popularity steadily grew. Though the two men met only once over a brief lunch in 1917, their impressions of one another were mutually disparaging: Lawrence described Galsworthy as a \"sawdust bore\"17 and Galsworthy condescendingly referred to Lawrence as a \"provincial genius.\"18 Prior to their meeting, Galsworthy had read both Sons and Lovers and The Rainbow and was emphatically unimpressed, faulting Lawrence particularly for his inability to reveal the \"soul\" of his fictional characters. In a 1915 letter to J. B. Pinker, Galsworthy deemed The Rainbow to be \"aesthetically detestable.\" He was revolted by the novel's \"perfervid futuristic style\" and believed that [End Page 433] Lawrence's overemphasis on sex \"falsife[d] all the values of his work\": \"What real discovery, what of the spirit, what that is touching, or even true?\"19 What perhaps most incensed Lawrence, and added fuel to the growing flames of animosity, was Galsworthy's refusal to lend support for the publication of Women in Love—an endorsement that Lawrence desperately needed.20\n\nThe argument then that Woolf described first in \"Modern Fiction\" and then expanded in \"Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown\"21 was nothing less than a struggle (a hostile takeover, if you will) for cultural capital—an attempt by a new generation of writers to take down a formidable literary luminary in order to establish their own aesthetic foothold. Pierre Bourdieu describes the strategy of \"young challengers\" to a cultural field who seek to \"make their mark\" quickly and decisively:\n\nThe ageing of authors, schools, and works is far from being the product of a mechanical, chronological, slide into the past; it results from the struggle between those who had made their mark (fait date—\"made an epoch\") and who are fighting to persist, and those who cannot make their own mark without pushing into the past those who have an interest in stopping the clock, externalizing the present stage of things. \"Making one's mark,\" initiating a new epoch, means winning recognition … of one's difference from other producers, especially the most consecrated among them [and] creating a new position, ahead of the positions already occupied, in the vanguard.22\n\nIndeed, in order to make their mark, Woolf and Lawrence had to issue passionate denunciations of what they perceived as outmoded \"Edwardian\" literary traditions, while at the same time trumpeting their epochal \"new\" visions of art and life. Consider Woolf's brazen declaration in 1916 when she had only one published novel: \"No age of literature is so little submissive to authority as ours, so free from the dominion of the great.\"23 Woolf was bolder in \"How It Strikes A Contemporary\" (1923):\n\nWe are sharply cut off from our predecessors.… Every day we find ourselves doing, saying, or thinking things that would have been impossible to our fathers . . . New books lure us to read them partly in the hope that they will reflect this re-arrangement of our attitude—those scenes, thoughts, and apparently fortuitous groupings of incongruous things which impinge upon us with so keen a sense of novelty.… No age can have been more rich than ours in writers determined to give expression to the differences which separate them from the past and not to the resemblances which connect them with it.24 [End Page 434]\n\nIt is no surprise that these so-called \"quarrels\" grew in intensity and frequency around 1922—the annus mirabilis of literary modernism.25 That year saw the publication of T. S. Eliot's The Wasteland, James Joyce's Ulysses, and Woolf's Jacob's Room alongside Galsworthy's The Forsyte Saga. Significantly, the three seminal works of modernism were all brought out by obscure imprints in minuscule editions. To add insult to injury, the critical reception of these works ranged from ambivalent to derisive.26 On the other hand, the overwhelming success of Galsworthy's The Forsyte Saga—sales quickly topped one million in both Britain and the United States27—along with the critical and financial success of his latest play, The Skin Game, solidified Galsworthy's status as the preeminent living English writer.28 It is also no wonder that Woolf and Lawrence were so bitterly resentful of this literary lion and the reading public that loved him. Indeed, as a best-selling author Galsworthy \"was subject more than ever to the envy of the less successful, [and] the detraction of the snobs.\"29 As Galsworthy quipped, \"a living writer very seldom has a passion for other living writers; on the contrary, he is generally in a passion about them.\"30\n\nThe generation of writers who Woolf identified as \"Georgian\" (including Forster, Lawrence, Lytton Strachey, Joyce, and Eliot) attempted to promote new forms of expression and new subjects for literature that were distinctly different from that of their \"old-fashioned\" Edwardian predecessors. Woolf saw Wells, Bennett, and Galsworthy as \"slaves\" of a \"powerful and unscrupulous tyrant\" who makes them write \"predictable\" realist novels: \"Is life like this? Must novels be like this?\"31 Lawrence similarly blasted the Georgians: \"You can put anything you like in a novel. So why do people [implicitly referring to Galsworthy, Bennett, Wells] always go on putting the same thing?\"32 The fundamental nature of the grievance according to Woolf—the reason for the necessary \"break between one [literary] generation and the next\"—was that Galsworthy and his literary brethren failed to capture the essence of modern character. They ignored the inner life or \"spirit\" of the individual and instead placed \"enormous stress on the fabric of things.\"33 She castigated the anti-modern \"materialists\" for their alleged preoccupation with social and political problems, which stifled any opportunity for artistic innovation.34 While Woolf showed little restraint in touting the originality of her own artistic credo, many of her complaints about the Edwardian \"materialists\" were not exactly new. In an earlier, somewhat more ponderous critique, \"The Younger Generation,\" James first called attention to what he regarded as a limitation of the new [End Page 435] novelists (including Joseph Conrad, Bennett, Galsworthy, Lawrence, and others). They attempted to give the reader a thickly buttered \"slice of life,\" but ultimately fell short in their endeavors because they did not address \"the supreme reference\"—that is, they failed to account for how their slice was cut or from what loaf it came.35\n\nSuch criticism, according to Galsworthy, whether from James, Woolf, or any other detractor, was reductive and inaccurate. In \"Faith of a Novelist\" (1926), an essay written shortly after the \"Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown\" attack, he argued that fiction could (or should) not be separated from its cultural contexts. A novelist, Galsworthy explained, will \"often seem to be exploiting some social problem, or grinding the axe of a reform, when he has really only selected circumstances and environment which will most surely and suitably bring out the fundamental qualities of his characters.\"36 Galsworthy, that is, employed the \"slice of life\" approach that both James and Woolf disparaged not to marginalize the inner life of the individual, but rather to emphasize how the material environment was a vital influence on human nature—in other words, to \"look within\" and \"look without.\"\n\nKeen to trumpet her own aesthetic aims, Woolf challenged her fellow Georgians to \"bring back character from the shapelessness into which it has lapsed, to sharpen its edges, deepen its compass.\"37 Echoing James's charge that the novel had been for too long dependent on its \"compositional and structural office,\"38 she argued that it was incumbent upon the novelist to throw off the shackles of moribund (traditional realist) narrative conventions and develop new artistic forms, styles, and ideologies: \"Those tools are not our tools, and that business is not our business. For us, those conventions are ruin, those tools are death.\"39 Lawrence also urged writers to completely obliterate \"the monster with many faces\"—the modern novel. The novel of the future, he ranted, must\n\nhave the courage to tackle new propositions without using abstractions; it's got to present us with new, really new feelings, a whole line of new emotion, which will get us out of the emotional rut. Instead of sniveling about what is and has been, or inventing new sensations in the old line, it's got to break a way through, like a hole in the wall.40\n\nWoolf and Lawrence saw the smashing and breaking away from convention as crucial for advancing an entirely new aesthetic ideology and practice for the modern era. Their boastful agendas however were not necessarily conceived in isolation nor were they wholly original. Ironically, years before Woolf declared that \"a different outline of form\" [End Page 436] would be \"incomprehensible to her predecessors,\"41 Galsworthy had made the following percipient observation of stylistic innovation:\n\nThe new novel has as many bemoaners as the old novel had when it was new. It is no question of better or worse, but of differing forms—of change dictated by gradual suitability to the changing conditions of our social life, and to the ever fresh discoveries of craftsmen, in the intoxication of which, old and equally worthy craftsmanship is—by the way—too often for the moment mislaid.42\n\nT. E. Hulme had also issued a similar challenge in 1914 for the artist to see things anew—\"to see things as they really are, and apart from the conventional ways in which [one] has been trained to see them.\"43 Perhaps most compellingly was Ford Madox Ford's contention that ultimately the novelist \"should strive to fulfil what he may regard as the particular canon of his Art.\"44\n\nThough Galsworthy believed that \"conversion to others to his own way of thinking is no direct part of a novelist's business,\"45 he was an advocate for the free rein approach that both Hulme and Ford were promoting. In his 1923 address, \"Six Novelists in Profile,\" Galsworthy issued the following corrective to Woolf's and Lawrence's claims for the proper stuff of fiction:\n\nUsing the stuff of real life for the purposes of his art, a great novelist can, by the light he throws, forward the organic growth of human society, and colour the ethics of his time. He need not be conscious teacher or conscious rebel. He need only see widely, feel deeply, and be able to mould what he has seen or felt into that which has a new and significant life of its own…. No patterns, no theories guide his efforts. He must discover. He must forge for himself out of life's raw material the design which suits.46\n\nIn Galsworthy's rebuke (\"no patterns, no theories\") there are also unmistakable echoes of Wells's early call for the novel to \"be kept free from the restrictions imposed upon it by the fierce pedantries of those who would define a general form for it. Every art nowadays must steer its way between the rocks of trivial and degrading standards and the whirlpool of arbitrary and irrational criticism.\" 47\n\nYet as both Woolf and Lawrence anxiously sought to \"make their mark,\" to usher in a new age of English literature, they deliberately constructed an imminent sense of rupture. They insisted that the established form of the novel—the realist tradition—was no longer adequate or appropriate to capturing what Woolf described as the \"the spirit we live by.\"48 And the \"form of fiction most in vogue more often misses than secures the thing we seek. Whether we call it life or spirit, [End Page 437] truth or reality, this, the essential thing, has moved off, or on, and refused to be contained any longer.\"49 The writer, Woolf declared emphatically, must have complete aesthetic freedom to convey the uniqueness and unpredictability of individual character. Galsworthy was unlikely to have disagreed with this \"revolutionary\" vision. While Woolf and Lawrence repeatedly criticized their predecessors for evading \"life\" in their fiction, \"Life itself\" (a phrase which Woolf did not coin, but rather co-opted) had, in fact, always been central to Galsworthy's artistic philosophy. In that pre-quarrel years essay, \"Vague Thoughts on Art,\" he proposed a new and unmistakably modern way of categorizing artistic practice:\n\nIs not the artist, of all men … the discoverer of that jack-o'-lantern— Truth.… Truth—it seems to me—is no absolute thing, but always relative, the essential symmetry in the varying relationships of life; and the most perfect truth is but the concrete expression of the most penetrating vision. Life seen throughout as a countless show of the finest works of Art; Life shaped, and purged of the irrelevant, the gross, and the extravagant; Life, as it were, spiritually selected—that is Truth; a thing as multiple and changing, as subtle, and strange, as Life itself, and as little to be bound by dogma.50\n\nLater, Galsworthy explained that \"art [and] even the art of the novel, has always been the subject of a 'tug-of-war,'\" but ultimately \"its essence—that which makes it a work of art—is the presence of the mysterious quality called 'life.'\"51\n\nIf it seems remarkable that we can locate between Woolf and Galsworthy a shared artistic outlook—indeed, that the \"business of Art is the creation of vital things\"52—then it is all the more remarkable (if not blasphemous to Lawrence devotees) to suggest that a temperamental similarity—if not shared ideology—may also be found in Lawrence's diatribe \"Morality and the Novel\" (1925). In that essay, Lawrence proclaims self-righteously that the\n\nbusiness of art is to reveal the relation between man and his circumambient universe, at the living moment.… If we think about it, we find that our life consists in this achieving of a pure relationship between ourselves and the living universe about us.… The novel is a perfect medium for revealing to us the changing rainbow of our living relationships. The novel can help us to live, as nothing else can.\"53\n\nAnd therein we can discern the anxiety of influence writ large. Further evidence of this ideological affinity may also be detected in \"Why the Novel Matters\" (1925) where Lawrence appears to echo some of [End Page 438] the very phrases and artistic beliefs that Galsworthy had propounded throughout his essays:\n\nLet us learn from the novel. In the novel, the characters can do nothing but live. If they keep on being good, according to pattern, or bad, according to pattern, or even volatile, according to pattern, they cease to live, and the novel falls dead. A character in a novel has got to live, or it is nothing.\n\nWe, likewise, in life have got to live, or we are nothing.54\n\nThe similarities do not end there. While Galsworthy and Lawrence found the work of the other to be aesthetically inferior (if not \"detestable\"), they nonetheless seemed to agree that a work of art should be judged on its emotional impact. Galsworthy believed \"the object, and the test of Art, is always the awakening of vibration, of impersonal emotion,\"55 while Lawrence began his intemperate attack on Galsworthy with the directive to critics to \"judge a work on art by its effect on our sincere and vital emotion, nothing else…. A critic must be able to feel the impact of a work of art in all its complexity and its force.\"56\n\nGalsworthy would continue to respond indirectly in his essays and addresses to the various proclamations, imperatives, and credos of his \"young challengers.\" In doing so, however, he sought not to further provoke, but rather to collapse the polemical distinctions that Woolf and Lawrence were so keen to promulgate.57 In \"Faith of a Novelist,\" for instance, Galsworthy gestures toward points of continuity and emphasizes (as did his so-called detractors) that \"life itself\" was indeed the province of the novelist: \"after all, we do not choose our subjects—it is they who choose us. Life forces itself on us and gives us no rest until it has secured expression and received thereby quietus.\"58\n\nWoolf had further denounced the \"materialists\" for their failure to accurately express human consciousness. For Woolf, the \"proper stuff of fiction\" is the new novelist's attention to the workings of the mind—the ability to \"reveal the flickerings of that innermost flame which flashes its messages through the brain.\"59 The novelist, Woolf proclaimed, must have the \"courage to say that what interests him is no longer 'this' but 'that'.… For the moderns 'that,' the point of interest, lies very likely in the dark places of psychology … the emphasis is on hitherto something ignored … [and] something incomprehensible to our predecessors.\"60 Lawrence would also fault Galsworthy for what he perceived to be a misplaced emphasis on the \"psychology of the social being\" rather than a focus on the \"psychology of the free human individual.\"61\n\nGalsworthy unequivocally rejected Woolf's and Lawrence's self-serving claims that the new experiments in fiction that \"come close to the [End Page 439] quick of the mind\" were a more accurate rendition of modern life.62 Almost a decade before Woolf and Lawrence would begin pontificating about the \"proper stuff of fiction\" and their dissatisfaction with traditional realistic techniques, Galsworthy was already redefining what it meant to be a realist: \"realism\" and \"realistic\" are no longer applicable to \"technique\"; rather, Galsworthy explained, \"a realist … characterizes that artist whose temperamental preoccupation is with revelation of the actual interrelating spirit of life, character, and thought.\"63 And later, in an implicit response to Woolf's charge that the Edwardians were \"concerned not with the spirit, but with the body,\"64 he attempted to dissolve the distinction between spiritualism and materialism:\n\nI distrust the word spiritual. We must be able to smell, and see, hear, feel, and taste our ideal as well; must know by plain evidence that it is lifting human life, the heritage of all, not merely of the refined and leisured. The body and soul are one for the purpose of all real evolution, and regrettable is any term suggestive of divorce between them.65\n\nWhile Woolf and Lawrence lambasted Galsworthy for what they perceived as a lack of psychological insight and an inability to express the complexities of consciousness in his fiction, it was none other than Sigmund Freud, the \"father\" of psychoanalysis, who praised Galsworthy among all other contemporary writers for his fictional rendering of the unconscious.66\n\nGalsworthy went on to discredit Woolf's unqualified (and now clichéd) declaration \"on or about December 1910, human character changed\"67: \"As to the claim … that some fresh human faculty has been aroused, that there is a real new demand of the mind, which the old writers, painters, and composers cannot satisfy—let us consider!\" No, Galsworthy declared incredulously, \"the human being doesn't change so quickly as all that.\" This \"new faculty and demand is probably not at all new. To-day is simply satisfying an old craving in a different and more compendious fashion … on the whole we must reject the theory of a new faculty in the modern mind, and fall back on a simple shift of categories.\"68 Galsworthy further questioned the extent to which the modernists' preoccupation with human consciousness came at the expense of creating memorable and enduring literary characters69: \"The whole question of character creation is mysterious, perhaps more mysterious to one who creates character than to those who smile or sniff under the creation; the process has no dossier, is devoid of documentation, and resists precise definition. Whether in literature or in life, creation has the same baffling inscrutability.70 [End Page 440]\n\nContrary to Woolf's injunctions, Galsworthy insisted there is \"no rule\" for creating characters is literature. Varying as it does from novelist to novelist, he explained, the creative process is \"inscrutable\"; the nearest approach to a common formula is when\n\na real incident, or person, impinges sharply on a receptive mood of a novelist's particular nature or temperament; the thing observed and the mood of the observer click, as it were, like two cells clinging together to form the germ-point of creation. To this germ-point are attracted suitable impacts or impressions that have been stored in the subconscious mind, till the germ swells to proportions which demand the relief of expression, and in written words the novelist proceeds to free himself.71"
