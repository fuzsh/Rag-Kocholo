In 1895 Galsworthy began an affair with Ada Nemesis Pearson Cooper, the wife of Maj. Arthur Galsworthy, one of his cousins. After her divorce ten years later, the pair married on 23 rd September 1905 and stayed together until his death in 1933.\n\n7. From the Four Winds , a collection of short stories, was Galsworthy's first published work in 1897. These, and several subsequent works, were published under the pen name John Sinjohn In 1904 he began publishing under his own name, probably owing to the death of his father.\n\n8. His first play, The Silver Box (1906), became a success and he followed it up with The Man of Property (1906), the first in the Forsyte trilogy.\n\n9. Although he continued writing both plays and novels it was as a playwright that he was mainly appreciated for at the time.\n\n10. He is known for The Forsyte Saga , the first of three trilogies of novels about the eponymous family and connected lives. These works dealt with class, and in particular upper-middle class lives. Although sympathetic to his characters he highlights their insular, snobbish and acquisitive attitudes and their suffocating moral codes.\n\n11.

He is one of the first writers of the Edwardian era. Challenged some of the ideals of society depicted in the preceding literature of Victorian England in his works.\n\n13. The depiction of a woman in an unhappy marriage furnishes another recurring theme in his work. The character of Irene in The Forsyte Saga is drawn from Ada Pearson even though her previous marriage was not as miserable as Irene's.\n\n14. His work is often less convincing when it deals with the changing face of wider British society and how it affects people of the lower social classes. Through his writings he campaigned for a variety of causes including prison reform, women's rights, animal welfare and the opposition of censorship.\n\n15. During the First World War Galsworthy was 47 years old. He worked in France at the Benevole Hospital for disabled soldiers. He also signed over his family house as a rest home for members of the British Army recovering from war injuries.\n\n17.

He died from a brain tumour on 31 st January 1933 at his London home, Grove Lodge, Hampstead. In accordance with his will he was cremated at Woking and his ashes scattered over the South Downs from an aero plane.\n\n21. The popularity of his fiction waned quickly after his death but the hugely successful adaptation of The Forsyte Saga in 1967 renewed interest in his work.\n\n22.
