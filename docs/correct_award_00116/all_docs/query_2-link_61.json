        "text": "The works of Rudyard Kipling, the first and the youngest, Doris Lessing the last and the oldest and at the same time the only female author and John Galsworthy the only lawyer-novelist Nobel Prize winners of Britain are critically analysed in this paper to investigate the common core of the literary nobility of their selected works, The Jungle Books, The Good Terrorist and The Forsyte Saga respectively. This paper also intends to find the noble literary quality of the aforementioned works which made them worthy of Nobel Prize in literature. At the turn of the 20th century, Alfred Nobel, in his will, decided to found an organization in order to cherish scholars and scientists who have done significant activities in their fields. To nobody’s surprise, he included literature as one of the fields worthy of the reward, being immensely interested in literature himself. It is imperative to point out that firstly, the researcher’s examination of the Nobel laureates is narrowed down to novelists and secondly, they are chosen to cover different periods of the life of the Nobel Prize, having in mind that the history of the Nobel Prize is divided into different periods by literary commentators concerned with the Nobel Prize and its standards according to the approaches taken for choosing the winners in each phase. Covering different periods of the history of the Nobel Prize, it appears that some other non-literary factors may have played a significant role in choosing the winners. On the one hand, there have been writers who won the Noble Prize due to political prejudices of the Academy like Kipling; on the other hand, writers like Galsworthy and Lessing seem to have benefited from this approach of the Nobel Academy. Galsworthy, striving to give voice to the other silent part of society and suppressed writers and Lessing, a constant supporter of the change and improvement in the condition of women, were involved in some political issues in attempts to bring into light political and social flaws of society and political system."
