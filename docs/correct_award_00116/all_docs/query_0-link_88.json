        "text": "John Galsworthy's The Forsyte Saga will come to London's Park Theatre in two parts next year.\n\nThe world premiere adaptation by Shaun McKenna and Lin Coghlan will be staged from October 11, 2024 through December 7, with opening night set for October 19. The two plays will play across alternate nights, with consecutive runs on matinee days.\n\nTitled The Forsyte Saga Part 1: Irene and The Forsyte Saga Part 2: Fleur, both plays will be directed by Josh Roche. Additional creative team members, and cast information, will be released at a later date.\n\nSet in 1886 London, the saga centers on Soames Forsyte, a wealthy solicitor and man of property, and his wife Irene, who he considers to be his prized possession. Years later, their daughter Fleur is forced to confront the families shocking secret when history begins to repeat itself. Spanning the 40 years of immense change between the end of the Victorian era and the beginning of the Roaring '20s, the epic directly dissects the concepts of class, respectability, and possessive patriarchy."
