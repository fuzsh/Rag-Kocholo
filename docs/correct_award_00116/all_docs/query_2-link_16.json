But there is one constant element — human nature. The tides and currents of human feeling and of human conduct change with a speed which may best be compared with that of glaciers, or even of the mountains where those glaciers form. I would dare hazard the opinion that the field of life before us writers, twenty years hence, will, save for the colour of the grass, be practically what it is today.”"
