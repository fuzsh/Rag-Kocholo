        "text": "My dear friends, thinkers, readers and man and women of all thoughts, ideas and opinion, I bid you and ask you to join with me in another voyage of intellectual discovery where those who may wish to engage in critical thinking and do not engage in and accept media lies, falsehoods, political code words, and hype can join in the effort to gain truth and facts amid the barrage of corruption and virtual darkness we are confronted with and befuddled and made effective fools of. I welcome you in this quest and task of attaining and coming to know intellectual honesty and honest discernment. Join with me in this voyage of discovery to get at and find what is valid and authentic in the world of confusion and to come with me in tearing apart the curtain of lies and darkness that hides from us what is truth and facts.\n\nToday I will analyze the life and literary works of one of our greatest English authors of the past. I ask you, lovers of thought and literature, to join with me in coming to know and treasure the English writer John Galsworthy, one of the greats of the past never for me to be forgotten. I have spoken of the great English and American novelists and poets of the past in these pages such as the novelists Dickens, Thackeray, Kipling, Forster, Lewis, and John Steinbeck; and such poets as Keats, Shelley, Byron, Tennyson, and Browning, and many others and I now have the honor and privileges of writing and speaking on one for me of the greats, John Galsworthy who though not as read and even known now as he used to be, is well-worthy the attention of all of us. This writer was born in 1867 and died in 1933 and was an English novelist and playwright and is best known for his great work The Forsyte Saga and its sequels The Modern Comedy and The End of the Chapter. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1932. He was born in Surrey, England and attended the Harrow School and New College at Oxford and took a second in law at Oxford and in 1889 was called to the bar and trained as a barrister. He lacked interest in a legal career and travelled abroad to look after his family's shipping business. He married in 1905 and published a collection of short stories in 1897, The Four Winds, which was his first published work. He published The Island Pharisees in 1904. His first play was The Silver Box and this was followed by the first novel in The Forsyte Saga in 1906, The Man of Property and two of his best known plays addressing the class system including Strife in 1909 and The Skin Game in 1920. He is best known for his novels, in particular The Forsyte Saga, the story of the events and history of an upper middle class family. The characters in his series of novels are seen and projected as snobbish; they are greedy, devoted to goods and money, and victims of a suffocating moral code. He challenged in these novels the ideals of society depicted in the literature of the former Victorian era and was one of the first writers of the Edwardian era to challenge the Victorian code. He depicted in these novels a woman in an unhappy marriage.\n\nGalsworthy campaigned for a variety of causes in his life including prison reform; women's rights; and animal welfare. He was against censorship and was a supporter of British involvement in the First World War and called for a war against Germany to protect the little country, Belgium. He was passed over for military service and worked as an orderly in a hospital in France and in 1917 turned down a knighthood. He was a humanitarian and a member of the Humanitarian League. In 1921, he was the first president of the PEN International Literary Club and received the Nobel prize in 1932, although he was too ill to attend the ceremony and died seven weeks later and donated the prize money to PEN. He died of a brain tumor at his London home and was cremated. The popularity of his fiction waned after his death but the TV adaptation of his great work The Forsyte Saga in 1967 renewed interest in his work.\n\nJohn Galsworthy, though perhaps not seen as a major literary figure today as he was in his lifetime, deserves our attention. In his great work The Forsyte Saga, he portrayed with great effectiveness the era of the apex of British capitalism where money and class ruled the day in that country and in that society. He showed the gross defects of that system based on class snobbery and where women had little to say in either the family or the world. He painted a picture of an era long past now, but led us to understand the capitalist system of that day and why is has since been modified and in some sense demolished if not eliminated to some degree."
