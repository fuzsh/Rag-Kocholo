John Galsworthy was an English novelist and playwright who won the 1932 Nobel Prize in Literature. He was born into a wealthy family in London in 1867. His most famous work was The Forsyte Saga, a series of novels chronicling the lives of an upper-middle class British family between the 1880s and 1920s. The first novel, The Man of Property, was a critique of the English upper classes. Galsworthy produced many other novels, stories, and plays throughout his career.",
