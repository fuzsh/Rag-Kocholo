        "text": "Some TikTok audios are immediately written into the hall of fame, seemingly declared as okay to use forever and ever until the app eventually crumbles into dust – and a good example of this is the “nobody’s gonna know” TikTok audio. We’ve experienced it with the “oh no” song that refuses to die, just as we have with the “step on the gas” one, but it seems like not a day goes by when you don’t hear “nobody’s gonna know… oh my god!” on the app.\n\nBut where did it come from? Everyone seems to think it was from a reality show of some sort, but it turns out that it’s actually from a random TikTok made in 2020. Here’s the story behind the “nobody’s gonna know” TikTok audio.\n\nWhere does the “nobody’s gonna know” TikTok audio come from?\n\nSo, you’re here because you assumed it was from a reality show. Well, whilst the music certainly makes it seem like it could be, it’s actually from a TikTok skit by user @cgleason22.\n\n@cgleason22me debating myself on whether or not i should make a fake account just to post comments on my videos ##comedy ##reality ##kuwtk ##drama ##fyp ##foryou♬ how would they know bad girls club – Chris Gleason\n\nCaptioned “me debating myself on whether or not I should make a fake account just to post comments on my videos”, the video was originally uploaded in March 2020 and has since garnered over one million likes.\n\nThe reason you may have assumed the audio was from a TV show of some sort is likely because the music in the background is from Bad Girls Club, an American reality TV series that uses the very same music when things are kicking off between the characters:\n\nSo, that’s literally all there is to it – a massively viral TikTok audio came from a video that nobody ever saw. However, there are some pretty interesting videos when you click on the audio, so here are the best:\n\n@karenlafleur##chichen Itza ##2021 ##mexico♬ how would they know bad girls club – Chris Gleason\n\n@no2pencilblogUpdated countertops for less than $200 🙌🏻♬ how would they know bad girls club – Chris Gleason\n\n@rxthismNobody’s gonna know ##fyp ##foryou ##lipstick ##makeuphacks ##hack ##tutorial ##makeup ##beconvincing ##crucialcatch ##foryoupage♬ how would they know bad girls club – Chris Gleason\n\n@pizza_4_meWhen you’re hungry at work! ##itsajoke ##pizza ##foodie ##fypage ##rectanglepizzaforlife♬ how would they know bad girls club – Chris Gleason\n\nRelated stories recommended by this writer:"
