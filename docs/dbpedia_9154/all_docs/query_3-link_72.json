        "text": "It's normal to be worried about pain when someone is in their last weeks, days or hours of life. Not everyone experiences pain and there are different ways that pain can be managed. We know it can be difficult when someone close to you is in pain. There are things that can help with their pain and there is support available for you.\n\nThis information is for family and friends of someone who is approaching the end of their life. It may also be useful for people living with a terminal or life-limiting illness.\n\nIf you have any questions or need support, our free Marie Curie Support Line is here for you on 0800 090 2309* or you can email us at support@mariecurie.org.uk\n\nOn this page:\n\nDoes everyone get pain when they are dying?\n\nDoes dying hurt?\n\nWhat causes pain at the end of life?\n\nHow is pain assessed?\n\nWhen should I ask for help with pain?\n\nWho can help with pain when someone is dying?\n\nEnd of life pain relief\n\nEnd of life pain medication\n\nOther ways to manage end of life pain\n\nWhat if the pain cannot be managed?\n\nHow can family and friends help with pain?\n\nSupport for family and friends\n\nDoes everyone get pain when they are dying?\n\nSome people experience pain as their illness progresses and in their last weeks, days or hours of life. But not everyone gets pain – some people have no pain at all.\n\nThere are different things that can help with pain including medication, support, heat and cold therapy, changing position and equipment. These things might be arranged by the GP or district nurse, and sometimes people will need help from a specialist team. These healthcare professionals should help to get the pain under control.\n\nThe pain might not go away completely, but medicines and support should help to make it more manageable. If you are the person's family member or friend, there are things you can do to help as well.\n\nDoes dying hurt?\n\nNo one knows exactly what people feel when they are dying. Many people look calm or relaxed when they die, so dying itself probably does not cause pain.\n\nSome people experience pain or discomfort in their last weeks and days of life. This can be caused by an illness, treatment or other things. There are things that can help to manage their pain and things you can do to help them.\n\nRead more about how family and friends can help to manage pain.\n\nWhat causes pain at the end of life?\n\nPain happens when damaged areas of the body send signals to the brain. Sometimes pain continues even when the initial damage or injury has healed (this is sometimes called 'chronic pain'). Pain can be caused by a person's illness, by a treatment or operation, or by a condition they've had for a while, such as arthritis.\n\nPeople who have experienced pain during their illness or who have certain conditions, such as cancer that has spread around their body, may need more support to manage their pain.\n\nAlthough pain is a physical feeling, we also know that lots of other things can affect how people experience pain. Feeling stressed, anxious, worried, tired, or alone can all make pain worse. Pain can sometimes be worse if someone is finding it difficult to accept that they are dying or they are worried about how others will cope when they are gone.\n\nRead more about different types of pain that people may experience.\n\nYour family member or friend may also be experiencing other symptoms. Read more about what to expect in someone's last weeks and days.\n\nHow is pain assessed?\n\nThe healthcare professional will talk to your family member or friend about their pain so they can find the right treatment for them. This might involve asking them questions and doing a physical examination. They might ask questions about their pain, such as:\n\nWhere is the pain?\n\nWhat does it feel like? (aching, tingling, sharp, burning)\n\nWhen did it start?\n\nIs it constant or on and off?\n\nDoes anything make it better or worse?\n\nHow bad is the pain on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is 'no pain' and 10 is 'the worst pain possible'?\n\nEveryone feels pain in their own way and everyone responds to it differently. This means the person is in the best position to say what their pain is like.\n\nRead more about pain in terminal illness, including questions the doctor or nurse might ask and different types of pain.\n\nIf your family member or friend is unable to communicate\n\nWhen someone is in their last weeks or days of life, it is normal that they sleep more or might become unconscious. They might also have a condition or disability that makes it difficult for them to communicate verbally. The doctor or nurse should try to involve them in discussions and decisions if possible by asking yes or no questions, or using visual aids (like a pain scale).\n\nSigns of pain\n\nIf the person cannot speak or tell you about their pain, you can look for signs that they are in pain. Some of these things are normal changes towards the end of life. They may not always be a sign that the person is in pain.\n\nSigns of pain might include:\n\nchanges in their facial expression – for example, frowning, grimacing or clenching their teeth\n\nmaking noises – for example, crying or groaning\n\nchanges in body language – for example, becoming withdrawn or not making eye contact\n\nchanges in their posture – for example, looking tense or holding on to furniture or their body\n\nbecoming restless – for example, changing their position, rocking or constant hand motions\n\nchanges in their mood – for example, being quieter or becoming aggressive\n\nchanges in their sleep pattern\n\nchanges in their routine – for example, refusing food or drink (although this can be a normal part of dying)\n\nagitation or distress\n\nnot being able to concentrate or seeming confused\n\nrubbing or holding areas of their body\n\nphysical changes – for example, increased blood pressure or heart rate.\n\nTell the doctor or nurse if you've noticed any changes, and they can assess your family member or friend.\n\nWhen should I ask for help with pain?\n\nYou should ask for help if your family member or friend has:\n\nnew pain (for example, the pain might feel different or be in a new part of their body)\n\npain that gets worse\n\npain that is not managed by their current medication or care.\n\nIf your family member or friend has any of the symptoms above or you're worried about them, speak to their doctor or nurse.\n\nWho can help with pain when someone is dying?\n\nIf the person is at home or in a care home, you can contact the person's GP, or district or community nurse. We know that it can sometimes be difficult to get through to the GP surgery or get an appointment, and this can be frustrating and upsetting. If you feel that the person needs medical care or advice that day, tell the receptionist.\n\nYou may have been given contact details for a specialist team who you can contact directly. If you have, it's best to contact this team first. Keep their contact details in a safe place and share them with anyone who will be helping to look after your family member or friend.\n\nIf the person is in a hospital or hospice, ask the staff who should be responsible for their care or pain management.\n\nRead more about the different people who may be involved in their care.\n\nEnd of life pain relief\n\nThere are different ways to manage pain when someone is in their last weeks or days of life. The focus will be on making them as comfortable as possible.\n\nWhat works best might depend on:\n\nwhat's causing the pain\n\nwhat type of pain they have (for example, aching or stabbing)\n\nhow severe their pain is, and\n\nwhat is most helpful to them as an individual.\n\nTell the doctor or nurse if there's something that has or has not worked well in the past. They might need to try different things to see what works best. Always speak to the person's doctor or nurse if you have any questions.\n\nEnd of life pain medication\n\nThere are lots of different medicines for treating pain. Some are for different types or severity (amount) of pain. It can take a while to find the medicines that work best for your family member or friend.\n\nThe three main types of painkillers are:\n\nsimple painkillers for mild pain, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen\n\nweak opioids for moderate pain, such as codeine\n\nstrong opioids for severe pain, such as morphine or oxycodone.\n\nSimple painkillers can usually be taken as well as opioids for moderate or severe pain.\n\nOther medicines, such as anti-depressants and steroids, can also be used to treat pain.\n\nRead more about different pain medicines, including side effects.\n\nWhen to take pain medicines\n\nYour doctor or nurse will tell you when the medicines need to be taken. Many people will need to take painkillers regularly (sometimes called 'around the clock doses').\n\nSome people think they should wait until the pain is bad before taking any painkillers, but this is not true. It is better to take painkillers as often as your doctor prescribed, even if you're not experiencing pain at the time. This helps to keep the pain under control between doses.\n\nIf you're taking pain medicine regularly and it's not managing your pain, speak to your doctor or nurse. They may give you extra painkillers to take in between your regular doses if you need it (sometimes called a 'rescue dose' or 'breakthrough dose'). Pain is not something that you have to put up with.\n\nManaging medications\n\nTaking medication regularly as the doctor or nurse has prescribed is important. But this can be difficult, especially if they are taking a lot of different medications.\n\nHere are some things that can help to manage medicines:\n\nAsk their GP or doctor to review their medicines to see if there are any they might not still need.\n\nCreate a chart of what needs to be taken and when, and tick things off when they have been taken.\n\nUse a plastic box with different compartments to see what needs to be taken at what time (called a 'dosette box'). You can ask the pharmacist for one or buy one.\n\nUse an app that can help with this if you have a smartphone or tablet.\n\nIf you're finding it difficult to keep track of your family member or friend's medication, tell their pharmacist, doctor or nurse.\n\nRead more about managing medications.\n\nJust in case medication\n\n'Just in case' or 'anticipatory medicines' are medicines that your family member or friend does not need now but might need if they become more ill or in pain towards the end of life. It means you do not have to get a prescription or go to a pharmacy in an emergency.\n\nA doctor or specialist nurse can prescribe them these medicines in England, Scotland and Wales. You then keep the medicines at home in case your family member or friend needs them. If you do, a district or community nurse can come and to give them to your family member or friend.\n\nFor emergency medical supplies in Northern Ireland, speak to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.\n\nRead more about just in case medication.\n\nSyringe drivers\n\nThere are different ways to have medicines including tablets, injections, patches and syringe drivers.\n\nA syringe driver (or syringe pump) is a small battery-powered pump. It delivers a steady flow of medicines through small tube under the skin. It can be useful if the person is not able to swallow tablets, is feeling or being sick, or if the tablets are not working.\n\nSyringe drivers are often used at the end of life because they are sometimes the easiest way to give someone the medicines they need to feel comfortable, but they can be used at any stage of an illness.\n\nRead more about having a syringe driver.\n\nCommon worries about medicines\n\nSome people worry that having strong pain killers such as morphine can make someone die more quickly. But there is no evidence for this. We know that morphine and other opioids are very safe and effective when prescribed and taken correctly. Morphine and other strong painkillers can even be taken for a long time.\n\nSome people are worried about the risk of addiction. If the person takes the medicines as prescribed by their doctor and is approaching the end of their life, this is not usually a problem.\n\nIf someone has a history of a substance use disorder or addiction problems, they may still benefit from opioid painkillers if they are in pain. Worries about future substance use addiction may not be so relevant when they are dying. Speak to their doctor about the benefits and risks of taking medicines, and what alternatives may be available.\n\nIf you're worried about any of these things, speak to your doctor or nurse. They can tell you what medicines might be suitable for you and answer any questions you might have.\n\nOther ways to manage end of life pain\n\nThere are a lot of other things that can help to control pain or make it better:\n\nMaking someone comfortable – things like having a wash, brushing their teeth, toileting or changing clothes can help.\n\nPositioning – changing position or using pillows for support may help them.\n\nEquipment – getting a hospital bed or supportive chair may help someone feel more comfortable. Speak to their doctor or nurse.\n\nDistraction – try to distract the person with things they might enjoy, like talking, listening to music, watching TV or reading a magazine.\n\nHeat and cold – using a hot water bottle or ice pack may help reduce someone's pain.\n\nEmotional support – talking to someone about concerns they have can help. They might be able to get support through a local hospice or hospital.\n\nSpiritual support – sharing their thoughts about life, hope, feeling lost or religion. A hospital or hospice may have a faith leader or be able to find this support, whether they are religious or not.\n\nWhat if the pain cannot be managed?\n\nSometimes, it's difficult to manage pain. The medication they are on may not be keeping their pain under control. Or they may be getting breakthrough pain, where they have pain even though they are taking regular pain medication.\n\nThe doctor or nurse will assess the person's pain to see what might work. It can take time to find the medicines that work best for the person.\n\nSometimes the person will need to be looked after by experts in pain management. This might be done at home or in a care home, where people will visit them to give medication. But sometimes it may be appropriate to manage pain in a hospital or a hospice. Hospices are experts in pain management and often people find it reassuring to have support to help keep the pain under control. Read more about hospice care.\n\nIt can be upsetting to see your family member or friend in pain. You can support them by comforting them and using some of the techniques below. You can also speak to a nurse or trained member of staff on our free Support Line on 0800 090 2309* or email us at support@mariecurie.org.uk\n\nHow can family and friends help with pain?\n\nThere are a lot of things that you can do to support your family member or friend during this time:\n\nSpeak to their doctor or nurse if their pain is not being managed or you have any concerns.\n\nMake sure they have just in case medications arranged if they are at home – speak to their GP, district nurse or community nurse if they do not. Read more about just in case medications.\n\nHelp with medication – you could create a chart, medicine box or set up an app with reminders.\n\nHelp them to feel more comfortable – if the person needs help and you are able to, you could help with things like washing, going to the toilet and mouth care.\n\nSpend time with them – you could listen to music, read them a book or watch TV. You might want to talk about your lives or watch videos of other family and friends. They might also need time to rest, but may still appreciate you just being there.\n\nHave physical contact – they might want a cuddle or for you to hold their hand. Even if someone is unconscious, they may still be able to feel you holding their hand or hear you speaking to them.\n\nListen to any worries or concerns they might have – try to listen without judgement. Acknowledge their concerns and see if there's anything you can do to support them. You could ask them questions such as, 'Is there anything on your mind?' or 'Is there anything you're worried about?'\n\nHelp them achieve small goals – they might want to watch a programme together, sit outside for a bit or write a letter to someone.\n\nPain can be made better or worse by how someone is feeling. So, you can make a big difference by listening to them and giving them support during this time.\n\nSupport for family and friends\n\nIt's also important that you get support that you need during this time. It might help to take short breaks away from caring if you want to and feel able to. It can also help to talk to other people about how you're feeling – you might feel alone or that no one else understands what you're going through. You may have family or friends you can speak to, or a local carers support group.\n\nMarie Curie offers a wide range of support for people living with a terminal illness, and their family and friends. We can support with the following:\n\nMarie Curie Nurses and hospice care at home service who can help you in your own home with expert nursing and personal care, as well as bereavement support.\n\nMarie Curie Hospices – our hospices offer expert medical care and bereavement support for people staying or visiting for support.\n\nMarie Curie Support Line – you can call us on 0800 090 2309* or email us at support@mariecurie.org.uk\n\nMarie Curie Companion service, where a volunteer can visit you at home or in hospital.\n\nMarie Curie Companion over the phone service, where you can get regular support from a trained volunteer.\n\nMarie Curie Bereavement service, where a trained volunteer can offer regular support over the phone.\n\nMarie Curie's information booklets, which cover topics such as managing symptoms, what to expect at the end of life, and looking after yourself as a carer.\n\nAll of these services are free and many are available across the UK.
