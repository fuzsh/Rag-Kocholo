        "text": "It’s been six years since Boston’s We’re all Gonna Die released their third and to-date final outing, Kiss the Ground, Curse the Sky on Underdogma Records, and a half-decade since they last played a show. In the interim, drummer Scott Healey has played in the crusty sludge/thrash outfit Gut, bassist Jesse Sherman has moved onto Tired Old Bones and guitarist/vocalist Jim Healey has been fronting Black Thai and performing as a solo artist. Not like these dudes haven’t kept busy in the meantime, but after five years, We’re all Gonna Die are about due to book a gig or two.\n\nOr three. They’ll play in Allston, Manchester, New Hampshire, and Portland, Maine, over the next month, a Saturday series that will be further marked by the release of new single “Pleurisy,” which was written during their initial run but never released. Among heavy rockers in the middle part of the last decade, We’re all Gonna Die was always a little darker, a little more aggressive than the stoner bunch, but still more melodic than outright sludge would warrant. They toed that line well, and it’ll be good to see them again after so long.\n\nThe PR wire brings confirmation:\n\nAFTER FIVE-YEAR HIATUS, BOSTON FAVORITE HARD ROCK TRIO WE’RE ALL GONNA DIE REUNITES FOR THREE SUMMER SHOWS AND RELEASES NEW SONG “PLEURISY”\n\nSPECIAL LIVE IN-STUDIO RADIO PERFORMANCE — BOSTON EMISSIONS, WZLX 100.7, SUNDAY, JULY 13, 11PM\n\nBoston hard-rock favorite trio WE’RE ALL GONNA DIE reunites this summer for three shows at Great Scott (Allston, MA), The Shaskeen (Manchester, NH), and Geno’s (Portland, ME). To celebrate they will also release a new song, “Pleurisy,” recorded this spring and be a special guest performing live on WZLX’s Boston Emissions.\n\nSaturday, July 19, 2014 Great Scott Allston, MA Doors @ 8:30pm $10 21+\n\nwith special guests Cocked N’ Loaded, Murcielago, The Humanoids, and Wolfsmyth\n\nSaturday, August 2, 2014 The Shaskeen Manchester, NH Doors @ 9pm 21+\n\nwith special guests Thunderhawk and Hey Zeus\n\nSaturday, August 9, 2014 Geno’s Portland, ME 21+\n\nwith Murcielago and special guests Blackwolfgoat\n\nWE’RE ALL GONNA DIE formed in 1998, recorded three full-length albums on Underdogma Records: Kiss the Ground, Curse the Sky (2008), The Wreck of the Minot (2005), and Go to Hell (2004). They toured the U.S. and Ireland before going on hiatus after their September 2009 performance at the Stoner Hand of Doom festival in Frederick, MD. The trio’s current line-up features Jim Healey on vocals and guitars (also plays in Black Thai and the Jim Healey Band), Jesse Sherman on bass (also plays in Tired Old Bones), and Scott Healey on drums (also plays in Gut and Give Up!).\n\n“We haven’t played in 5 years,” says WE’RE ALL GONNA DIE front-man Jim Healey. “I felt it was time to get together, play a few shows, and see where things went from there. The band will probably only ever play a few shows a year, but it’s great to play together, and see the fans.”\n\n“We recorded a ‘new’ song (written in 2007, but never rerecorded) called “Pleurisy,” Healey says. “It will be available for download along with 5 other unreleased WAGD tracks, spanning the history of the band in all its member formations.”\n\nFor more WE’RE ALL GONNA DIE information:\n\nhttp://www.wereallgonnadie.com/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/wereallgonnadieboston\n\nhttp://wereallgonnadieband.bandcamp.com/\n\nhttp://wzlx.cbslocal.com/show/boston-emissions/\n\nWe’re all Gonna Die, Kiss the Ground, Curse the Sky (2008)\n\nKiss the Ground, Curse the Sky by We're All Gonna Die\n\nTags: Boston, Massachusetts, Underdogma Records, We're all Gonna Die"
