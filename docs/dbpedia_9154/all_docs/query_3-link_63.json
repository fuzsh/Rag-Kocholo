        "text": "You’re not typically responsible for repaying the debt of someone who’s died, unless:\n\nYou’re a co-signer on a loan with outstanding debt\n\nYou’re a joint account holder on a credit card. Note: this is different from an authorized user\n\nYou’re a surviving spouse and your state law requires spouses to pay a particular type of debt\n\nYou’re the executor or administrator of the deceased person’s estate and your state law requires executors or administrators to pay an outstanding bill out of property that was jointly owned by the surviving and deceased spouses\n\nYou’re a surviving spouse and you live in a community property state that requires surviving spouses to use jointly-held property to pay debts of a deceased spouse. These states include Alaska (if a special agreement is signed), Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin.\n\nIf there was no co-signer, joint account holder, or other exception, only the estate of the deceased person owes the debt.\n\nIf you’re a surviving spouse or a personal representative, executor, or administrator of a deceased person’s estate, debt collectors can contact you to discuss debts and payments from the estate. However, it’s not legal for them to state or imply that you’re personally responsible for paying the person’s debts from your own assets, unless your situation falls into one of the specific circumstances listed above that would make you legally obligated for the debt.\n\nUnder the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), debt collectors may not harass, oppress, or abuse you or any third parties they contact. Even if you’re legally responsible for a debt, you have the right to tell a debt collector to stop contacting you.\n\nTalk with a lawyer\n\nIf you have questions about whether you’re responsible for a deceased person’s debts, you may want to talk to a lawyer. To find an attorney, you can contact a lawyer referral service in your area and ask for a lawyer with experience in consumer law, estate or probate matters, debt collection defense, or the FDCPA.\n\nSome attorneys may offer free services or charge a reduced fee. There may also be legal aid offices or legal clinics in your area that will offer their services for free if you meet their criteria. Servicemembers should consult their local JAG office .\n\nFor older Americans and their caregivers, the Eldercare Locator also provides trustworthy local support resources, including free legal aid for eligible older adults.\n\nGet details in writing\n\nDebt collectors are required to provide specific information about a debt during your first communication with them or within 5 days of the first communication. This information is known as a validation notice. If the collector refuses to give you any information about the debt – even though you are a surviving spouse, parent of a deceased minor, or personal representative of the estate – it might be a scam.\n\nIf you’re having an issue with debt collection, you can submit a complaint with the CFPB."
