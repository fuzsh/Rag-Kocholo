        "text": "Boyish was formed by India Shore and Claire Altendahl in 2016. They met at Berklee College of Music when India needed a guitarist for an audition tape and Claire volunteered. Their musical compatibility quickly became apparent and they started collaborating soon after under the name \"The Blue”. The duo went on to write and produce their debut project Carnation in 2018, which received positive write-ups from several publications. The New Yorker described them as “looking uncertainty straight in the eye in songs that are confident in their musicality even when tackling themes of angst and doubt“. Carnation was nominated for Alt-Country Album of the Year at the Independent Music Awards.\n\nBoyish released their most recent EP “We’re all gonne die, but here’s my contribution” on May 28th of 2021. The project received praise from Nylon, NPR, Ones To Watch, Them., The GLAAD Wrap, and Lyrical Lemonade. The lead single “Superstar” has been streamed over 400,000 times and was added to Spotify playlists such as “Fresh Finds”, “Lorem”, “All New Indie”, and “Softly”. Their single “whatshisname” was played on BBC Radio 6 and their third and final single “Your Best Friend” was featured as the KUTX Song of The Day."
