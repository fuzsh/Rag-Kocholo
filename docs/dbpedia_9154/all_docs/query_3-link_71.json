        "text": "Who Will Be in 'Only Murders' Season 4?\n\nNews is starting to trickle in about the cast. The first thing fans could take comfort in is knowing the show’s core trio — Mabel, Charles and Oliver — will be returning, without a doubt. Despite season three’s devastating loss of Sazz, Lynch will be back, most likely in flashbacks, similar to how Rudd’s Ben had a role in season three despite dying in the first episode.\n\nIn an interview with People, the Glee star confirmed that she has “some really great flashbacks” and revealed that she’ll “also appear in [the season] another way” but wouldn’t specify how. “I don’t want to give it away though, but I’m in it a lot,” she said, smiling. “I’m in five out of 10 episodes, so I’m excited.”\n\nMeryl Streep and Jesse Williams both joined the show’s third season, as well as a few other new faces. Co-creator Hoffman told THR after last season ended that there was “no greater hope for me” than bringing the two of them back: “I love them both, Jesse and Meryl, everyone. I mean, for God’s sakes, I would bring Paul back if we can. Listen, I would bring everyone back, and that might happen. Victims, killers, they’re all able to play in the landscape within this sort of certain narrative ways we can tell our stories.”\n\nIt’s been confirmed that Streep will indeed be returning. The Oscar-winning actress will reprise her role as Loretta Durkin, the love interest to Short’s Oliver Putnam. Season three ended with Loretta getting an offer to work in Los Angeles. Much to fans’ joy, Rudd will also be returning in some capacity. “Meryl Streep. Melissa McCarthy. Eugene Levy. Zach Galifianakis. Paul Rudd,” Longoria told Entertainment Tonight of her Only Murders co-stars. “There was one scene we were, all of us, we were there and I was like, ‘How is this my life?’ I’m so excited.”\n\nOther castmembers who are likely to return for season four are Michael Cyril Creighton’s Howard, Ryan Broussard’s Will, Jackie Hoffman’s Uma, Da’Vine Joy Randolph’s Detective Dee Williams, Jason Veasey’s Jonathan and James Caverly’s Theo. While Nathan Lane’s Teddy Dimas wasn’t in season three due to scheduling conflicts, he has said he’s open to returning to the series if he’s able to. Hopefully, Tina Fey’s Cinda Canning will come back as well, though her role in season three was pretty limited — only appearing in one episode to try to convince Mabel to join her podcast.\n\nIn February, news broke that Molly Shannon is joining Only Murders in the Building season 4. She will play a high-powered, Los Angeles businesswoman, who finds herself drawn into the world of Sazz’s murder investigation in New York. Not much else is known about her role.\n\nShannon may have been the first new castmember announced for this season, but Longoria, Eugene Levy, Kumail Nanjiani and Zach Galifianakis’ castings quickly followed. Like Shannon’s character, Longoria, Levy and Nanjiani’s roles were kept under wraps when announced. But, in June, Hulu revealed Levy, Longoria and Galifianakis would be playing themselves as they take on the roles of Charles, Mabel and Oliver in the movie being made about their podcast.\n\nWhat Will 'Only Murders' Season 4 Be About?\n\nAs with every other season, the final moments of season three revealed whose murder the trio will be investigating in season four. This time around, Mabel, Charles and Oliver will have to find who killed their beloved friend and Charles’ longtime stunt double, Sazz. Only Murders in the Building executive producer Jess Rosenthal suggested Sazz be the person who gets murdered, and Hoffman immediately lit up at the idea. He told THR he thought it was simultaneously “awful” and “perfect.”\n\n“I immediately, it’s the thing of like, if we get a chance to go more, it’ll be the thing that it just started exploding ideas in my head,” he said. “So, that was thrilling. And then the second part of that was actually talking to Jane Lynch about it and saying, ‘This is what we’re thinking.’ We had to do that pretty early, too, and that was very sweet. She was like, ‘I love it.'”\n\nAt the very end of the final episode of season three, as Sazz was dying, it looked like she was trying to write something on Charles’ kitchen floor with her own blood. What that is is unknown, but it will certainly come up in the next installment of the show. Hoffman explained that during production, there were discussions about how long to hold the shot of her trying to write something and how long to have her finger moving for. They decided to keep it as abstract as possible for now in order to keep their options open for the fourth season.\n\n“It feels very in her character to send a message,” he continued. “She’s been trying to do it to Charles throughout the season. She’s hinting to him in episode five that she’s picking up some ham radio chatter, certainly, right when she arrives in the finale, she’s saying, ‘Can I grab you for a few minutes? It’s a little sensitive.’ So, there’s something on her mind and something she may know but to be found out.”\n\nAs for who may have wanted to kill Charles — if that’s what they were trying to do — is also still up in the air. Hoffman played coy, only sharing that there’s a lot of exploring to do down that road. One thing they had in mind when thinking of season four’s victim was wanting to choose someone who is close to someone in the trio because the more personal it is to one of them, the better. Sazz’s death felt like an opportunity to make the victim someone Charles was close to and explore their connection.\n\n“We’ve loved writing Sazz so much, and that’s the beauty of the show is, you get a lot more time with the victims,” Hoffman said. “They’re not gone when some ill fate happens to them. And that’s, I think, also why Jane said she was excited because it’s a good opportunity to go deeper with Sazz and find out what the whole big life and everything else was with her and the world of stunt doubling.”\n\nIs There an 'Only Murders' Season 4 Trailer?\n\nOnly Murders released the first teaser for its upcoming season as a part of Disney’s upfront presentation in May, then dropped a full trailer for season four in August.\n\nBoth trailers tease the show’s new season as the “starriest” one yet, showing clips of characters played by Eugene Levy, Eva Longoria, Zach Galifianakis, Molly Shannon, Kumail Nanjiani, Richard Kind and Melissa McCarthy.\n\nSeason four of the Emmy-winning series will pick up right after the end of season three, where Mabel, Oliver and Charles celebrated a successful Death Rattle Dazzle opening night. With the party over and the season’s killers unmasked, the trio is eager for their next murder mystery when they discover Sazz’s body on Charles’ kitchen floor.\n\nOliver immediately dives into the mystery, despite Charles’ shock learning his longtime stunt double and friend is dead. When Mabel announces she’s received an email from a Hollywood studio that wants to turn their podcast into a movie, the pals pack their bags and head for Los Angeles, which just so happens to be where Streep’s Loretta Durkin ended up after season three.\n\n“The pictures?!” Oliver exclaims in the teaser. “Pack your bags, bitches. We’re going to the movies!”\n\nIn June, the show revealed that Longoria, Levy and Galifianakis would play themselves as actors cast to star as the podcast crew, and the August trailer offered a further glimpse at the tension between the main trio and their new onscreen counterparts. The new trailer also previewed Shannon’s role as a Hollywood bigwig behind the podcast’s movie adaptation and McCarthy as Charles’ sister in Long Island.\n\nThe trailer also features appearances from returning stars Lynch, Da’Vine Joy Randolph, Michael Cyril Creighton and Meryl Streep."
