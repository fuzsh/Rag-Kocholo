        "text": "Hilarious how a bunch of Rocketjump fans are gonna go into this thinking it’s a riot comedy but in reality it’s a poignant and resonant dissertation about grief. Possibly the best Ashly Burch performance in her career and I mean in ALL THE MEDIUMS she’s in.\n\nI laughed and cried. The person next to me was double-handed wiping tears from their face. As always Beth May was my favorite part.\n\nI also got to tell both Matt and Freddie personally how great it was!!!\n\nIf Rocketjump has no fans I am dead.\n\nSuch an honor to attend the world premiere of their first feature—a beautiful, funny, heartfelt, TRULY independent film which is both exactly in keeping with the strengths of its directors and something totally new and fresh. Sure, it wryly crafts a post-apocalyptic American West both horrifying and banal—but its real strength (as has been Rocketjump’s strength before) is the space it creates for powerful character moments and rich, raw emotionality.\n\nThese guys are paving a new path for how movies are made, and I know there are only bigger things to come.\n\nFreddie Wong is a large part of why I decided to pursue filmmaking in the first place so to watch his feature debut and tell him this while shaking his hand was a delight.\n\n[Free Screening & Q&A with Filmmakers]\n\nThis movie was so fun but the Q&A after made me want to be on a set TOMORROW. These guys and their work were one of the first things that made filmmaking seem not just appealing, but tangible. Very grateful I got to hear from them (and on my birthday too!). I love da movies!\n\nPossibly blinded by my love of Dungeons and Daddies, but I don't care. I also got to meet Matt Arnold after the movie, so I'm very happy right now.\n\n47th Asian American International Film Festival Screening:\n\nFun road trip adventure with a few uneven bumps on the road that is more of a testament to the creative team trying fun new nuggets. Ultimately it works given the indie charm and chemistry of the two leads."
