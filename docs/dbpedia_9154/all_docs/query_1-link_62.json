Responding to your body's needs. Everything you hear and read about diets, Nutrition and sleeping position and detoxifying your system, And buying machines that they advertise to help you exercise. Herbs to revitalize you if you're traumatized. Soaps that will sanitize. Sprays to deordorize. Liquid to neutralize acids and pesticides. Free weights to maximize your strength and muscle size. Shots that will immunize. Pills to re-energize you. But remember that for all your pain and gain Eventually the story ends the same... You can quite smokin', but you're still gonna die. Cut out cokin', but you're still gonna die. Eliminate everything fatty or fried, And you get real healthy, but you're still gonna die. Stop drinkin' booze, you're still gonna die. Stay away from cooze, you're still gonna die. You can cut out coffee and never get high, But you're still gonna, still gonna, still gonna die. You're still gonna, still gonna, still gonna die. Still gonna, still gonna, still gonna die. You can even give aerobics one more try, But when the music stops playin', you're still gonna die. Put seat belts in your car, you're still gonna die. Cut nicotine tar, you're still gonna die. You can exercise that cellulite off your thigh. Get slimmer and trimmer, but you're still gonna die. Stop gettin' a tan, you're still gonna die. You can search for UFO's up in the sky They might fly you to Mars where you're still gonna die. You're still gonna, still gonna, still gonna die. Still gonna, still gonna, still gonna die. And all the Reeboks and Nikes and Adidas you buy You can jog up to heaven and you're still gonna die. Drink ginseng tonics, you're still gonna die. Try high colonics, you're still gonna die. You can have yourself frozen and suspended in time, But when they do thaw you out, you're still gonna die. You can have safe sex, you're still gonna die. You can switch to Crest, you're still gonna die. You can get rid of stress, get a lot of rest, Get an AIDS test, enroll in EST, Move out west where it's sunny and dry And you'll live to be a hundred But you're still gonna die. You're still gonna, still gonna, still gonna die. Still gonna, still gonna, still gonna die. So you'd better have some fun 'Fore you say bye-bye, 'Cause you're still gonna, still gonna, still gonna die."
