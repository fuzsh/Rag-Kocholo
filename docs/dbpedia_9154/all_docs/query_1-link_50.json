        "text": "\"We're All Gonna Die\" is a darkly humorous and collaborative board game designed for adults aged 16 and above. In this game, players must work together to cheat death in a series of ridiculous and often embarrassing scenarios. The objective is to survive 20 death scenarios by rolling dice and matching them to the icons on death cards.\n\nThe game includes a game board, rules sheet, six life-saving dice, 45 death cards, and five embarrassing but non-lethal cards. To play, players set up the game board with the death cards placed face down in a deck next to space 1. Each player takes turns attempting to roll the dice to match the combination on the revealed death card. Players have three attempts to succeed or face the consequences.\n\nThe death scenarios are filled with dark humor, featuring absurd deaths like \"BLACK FRIDAY STAMPEDE\" and \"FORK IN A TOASTER.\" Some outcomes are not deadly but instead bring embarrassment. The game continues until either a death card is placed on the \"YOUâ€™RE DEAD\" space, leading to the demise of all players and ending the game, or the team manages to beat enough cards from the death deck to secure their survival and win.\n\n\"We're All Gonna Die\" offers a mix of strategy, teamwork, and laughter as players navigate the perilous and comical world of avoiding bizarre deaths. Whether played solo or with friends, the game promises moments of hilarity and suspense as you roll the dice to outwit death itself."
