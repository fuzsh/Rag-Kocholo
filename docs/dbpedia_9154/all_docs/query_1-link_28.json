        "text": "When Taylor Goldsmith and his band Dawes named the group’s album “We’re All Gonna Die” in 2016, no one was thinking about a possible nuclear war with North Korea or any of the other more dangerous aspects of 2017.\n\n“The irony isn’t lost on us,” says Goldsmith. “We made the record in March 2016, and a lot of the reasons for naming the record something like that were yet to present themselves, but it just seemed more and more appropriate. … While it’s definitely true in the long run, I hope it’s not true in the short term.”\n\nThe album is definitely more produced and maybe darker than the group’s past works. Dawes evolved from an earlier group Simon Dawes, which featured guitarist/vocalist Goldsmith, bassist Wylie Gelber and vocalist/guitarist Blake Mills. Mills didn’t stay with the group in its transition (which found Goldsmith’s brother Griffin Goldsmith joining as drummer), but produced the newest album. The group also includes keyboardist Lee Pardini.\n\nTaylor says the most recent album may not show the group’s early influences as much as older discs did, but if it does, he’s not worried.\n\n“I’m not ashamed of the things I love coming through,” he says. “I think for a lot of my favorite artists it’s very similar. You don’t question the Rolling Stones’ love of Chuck Berry or Bob Dylan’s love of Woody Guthrie. For us, if someone says ‘That sounds like a Warren Zevon song’ or ‘You must listen to Dire Straits,’ I’m honored. … As much as Keith Richards loves Chuck Berry he’s still only Keith Richards and so identifiable in the way he plays his guitar. You just have to hope your personality is strong enough to break through your influences. If you listen to ‘Tell Me Why’ on ‘After the Gold Rush,’ it feels like Neil Young is saying, ‘I love those Bob Dylan songs. I want to write a Bob Dylan song.’ But he is so fiercely Neil Young that he will never not sound like him! I think the longer you do it the better you get at it. Our early records we might have worn our influences on our sleeves more blatantly. It was fun at the time. But now making records like ‘All Your Favorite Bands,’ or this new album, we have created enough of our own sound. The dream is to get to the point where someone says to someone, ‘Hey, your song sounds like a Dawes song.’”\n\nSome listeners might be surprised at one of Goldsmith’s heaviest influences. He says he latched on to groups that were appropriate for a young teen, including Green Day and Weezer, and then The Beatles, which nearly every aspiring songwriter is touched by. However, Steely Dan is what really grabbed him in his mid-teens.\n\n“I couldn’t listen to anything else for a good year, year and a half,” says Goldsmith. “It really skewed my concept of music. They were so jazzy and so perfect. It was great for a kid who was learning how to play. It forced me to hunker down and listen closely. But, it kept me from really understanding the genius of the Rolling Stones or David Bowie or Bob Dylan. It was like, ‘Well, the Stones are just using three chords, but Steely Dan is using like 50!’ My criteria was so (messed) up! I still love Steely Dan, but at about 18 or 19 was when I started to really understand why The Stones were the Stones and Bowie was Bowie and Dylan was Dylan.”\n\nGoldsmith would, in fact, collaborate with Dylan in a way many years later when he joined Elvis Costello, Rhiannon Giddens, Jim James and Marcus Mumford in composing music for Dylan lyrics for the project “Lost on the River.” Goldsmith didn’t try to imitate tunes that Dylan might have composed.\n\nGoldsmith isn’t only influenced by other songwriters, though. He says books have a big influence on his work.\n\n“It’s important for me to get some solid reading time in as often as I can for me to find new ideas to apply to songs,” says Goldsmith. “Which is funny, because I tend to be an autobiographical writer. Even though I read a bunch of stories, I’m not writing a bunch of stories. I’m writing reflections of what’s been going on in my own life. In some cases I try to keep it one step removed in hopes that that makes it more relatable. If I can find the right perspective to go through my own emotions and make it seem like I’m not involved. Sometimes that not only makes it more relatable, but it helps me come back toward the subject.”\n\nGoldsmith says he has never felt like his band had a handle on being “most relevant” or “contemporary.”\n\n“In some cases I love those bands. The latest Tame Impala or Bon Iver or War on Drugs record, it feels like it has the finger on the pulse of what 2017 sounds like. … I’ve never felt like I had any understanding of that as far as being a songwriter. It’s as foreign to me as jazz music. I can respect it and identify it, but I don’t know how they’re doing that — if they’re even trying to. It could be just that they came along at the right time and it just spoke for everybody.”\n\nAnd as far as having an album title that seems frighteningly relevant, Goldsmith says there’s no smirk in its meaning:\n\n“There’s probably somebody the week the record came out whose mom died the week before or best friend died the week before. A record like that probably wouldn’t hit them as just something funny. We wanted to be respectful of that when considering the title. We didn’t want something that just made you chuckle, because it’s not funny. But when you listen to the song, I like the kind of air of ridiculousness of singing a line like that over a beautiful string arrangement or a mellow, it’s not some punk song that you might envision a title like that going along with. What that title refers to is going to be on the level of ridiculousness. … I think it all comes down to, at least for me, it’s often a healthy reminder to be mindful that we’re all gonna die. I’m not gonna be here forever and this thing that I’m taking oh so seriously, you can make a point that it’s pretty pointless.”\n\nDawes\n\nWhen: 8 p.m. Wednesday, April 26\n\nWhere: Bijou Theatre"
