        "text": "Introduction\n\nA will is a written document that sets out what you would like to happen to your possessions after you die. A will must be signed and witnessed.\n\nWhen you die, your possessions are called your ‘estate’. A ‘testator’ is a person who writes a will. If you die without leaving a will, you die ‘intestate’.\n\nYou can also read about:\n\nWhat happens to a deceased person person's money and possessions?\n\nDealing with a deceased person’s money and possessions\n\nHere you can read information about how to make a valid will, the things you should consider when writing your will, and what will happen if you die without leaving a will.\n\nReasons for making a will\n\nYou do not have to make a will. If you die without making a will, your estate will be distributed according to the law on succession - see ‘What happens if you die without leaving a will’ below.\n\nIf you want to have a say over who inherits all or part of your estate, you should make a will. You can also keep an updated list of the things that you own and information that people may need after your death. You can use a form like our form:\n\nWhere my possessions are kept (MS Word)\n\nWhere my possessions are kept (pdf)\n\nIt will make it easier to identify and trace your possessions after you die. You should keep the list in a safe place.\n\nHow do I make a will?\n\nYou can write a will yourself, or have a solicitor write it for you.\n\nA solicitor can advise you about your will and can make sure that your will is legally valid. You may also need legal advice for more complicated inheritance matters.\n\nIf you write your own will, you should make sure that it is valid. It can only be valid if:\n\nThe will is in writing\n\nYou are over 18\n\nYou are of sound mind\n\nYou sign or mark the will (or confirm that you made the signature or mark) in the presence of two witnesses, present at the same time if possible (the witnesses do not have to see the contents of the will).\n\nYour two witnesses sign the will in your presence\n\nYour signature or mark is at the end of the will\n\nGifts left to a witness or their spouse or civil partner are not valid.\n\nWhether you write your will yourself or have a solicitor write it, you can read more about ‘What should my will contain’ below.\n\nWhat does being ‘of sound mind’ mean?\n\nIn order to make a valid will, you must have, in the eyes of the law, the mental capacity to do so. This means you must understand and be able to decide what you are doing. If you have a medical condition that could affect your ability to understand and make decisions about what you should put in your will, you should ask your doctor or specialist to certify that you are capable of making a will.\n\nFor example, if you have a history of mental illness, or if you are in the early stages of a condition that can affect your ability to think and understand (like dementia for instance), you should ask your doctor or specialist to certify that you are currently mentally capable of making a will.\n\nCost of making a will\n\nThere is no set cost for having a solicitor write your will, and you can get quotations on prices on a solicitor’s website or by calling their offices. You may be able to save money by shopping around.\n\nWhat should my will contain?\n\nYou do not have to have your will in any set format. However, it is important that the will has the following:\n\nYour name and address.\n\nA statement that says you revoke or disown all earlier wills or codicils.\n\nThe appointment of one or more executors, or people who will carry out your wishes in your will after you die, along with their names and addresses.\n\nYour will should be dated and signed by you and your witnesses. This statement is called an attestation clause.\n\nResiduary Clauses\n\nA residuary clause, is a section in your will that sets out what to do with any property not specifically dealt with in the will. For example, your residuary clause could say that anything not identified in your will should be left to your spouse.\n\nYou may leave a part of your estate to someone, but that gift (sometimes called a bequest) could later found to be invalid. When this happens, that part of your estate becomes part of the residue of your estate, along with other things that are not specifically mentioned in the will.\n\nSigning your will\n\nYou have to sign your will in the presence of 2 witnesses. They have to sign the will to attest (witness) that you have signed the will.\n\nIf you are unable to sign your will because you cannot write, you can make a mark that should be witnessed like a signature.\n\nIf you are physically disabled and are unable to sign or mark your will, you can direct an agent or representative to sign your will for you. Your agent must sign the will in your presence and on your direction and your two witnesses must be present.\n\nProvisions for your spouse, partner and dependents\n\nYour spouse or civil partner has a ‘legal right share’ to your estate. This means that they are entitled to benefit from your will, even if you do not provide for them in your will. Your children also may have entitlements. Partners (that you were not married to or in a civil partnership with) may also be able to claim a share of your estate.\n\nYou can read more about the legal right share of spouses and civil partners.\n\nProperty abroad\n\nIf you have property in other countries, you should make a will in each of those countries due to possible differences in succession law.\n\nUnder EU Regulation 650/2012 on matters of succession (Brussels IV), if you have property in another EU member state, apart from Denmark, you can direct in your will that the law of your nationality should apply to the property.\n\nChanging or revoking your will\n\nIf you want to change your will, you and your witnesses must sign or initial your will in the margin of the page beside the changes. You can also change your will in the form of a memorandum or written note that is signed by you and your witnesses that refers clearly to the changes.\n\nTo change your will, you can also make a separate document, called a codicil, which is like an update added to the end of your will. This document, again signed by you and your witnesses, should set out clearly and accurately the changes you want to make to your will. These changes are then legally binding.\n\nIf you plan to make a lot of changes to your will it might be easier to simply revoke or cancel your current will by making a new one. This can only be challenged if your mental capacity when you revoked your will is called into question.\n\nYour will is revoked automatically in certain situations:\n\nIf you marry or enter into a civil partnership, your will is revoked, unless your will was made with the marriage or civil partnership clearly in mind\n\nIf you make another will, the previous will you made is revoked.\n\nIf you draw up a written document that is executed in accordance with the requirements for a will, your previous will shall be revoked.\n\nIf you burn, tear or destroy your will, it will no longer be considered valid. Or, if you have someone else destroy it, your will shall be revoked, provided this was done in your presence, with your consent, and with the intention of revoking your will.\n\nWhat happens if I die without leaving a will?\n\nIf you die without leaving a will, then your estate will be distributed in accordance with the law of succession.\n\nThis also happens:\n\nWhen the will is not valid because it was not made properly\n\nWhen a legal challenge to the validity of the will has been successful\n\nThe law of succession also applies to assets which are not covered by a will where there is no residuary clause\n\nThe order in which your estate is distributed in these cases is set out in the Succession Act 1965.\n\nIf you are survived by:\n\nA spouse or civil partner but no children (or grandchildren): your spouse or civil partner gets the entire estate.\n\nA spouse or civil partner and children: your spouse/civil partner gets two-thirds of your estate and the remaining one-third is divided equally among your children. If one of your children has died, that share goes to his/her children.\n\nChildren, but no spouse or civil partner: your estate is divided equally among your children (or their children).\n\nParents, but no spouse, civil partner or children: your estate is divided equally between your parents or given entirely to one parent if only one is living.\n\nBrothers and sisters only: your estate is shared equally among them, with the children of a deceased brother or sister taking his/her share.\n\nNieces and nephews only: your estate is divided equally among those surviving.\n\nOther relatives only: your estate is divided equally between the nearest equal relations.\n\nNo relatives: your estate goes to the State.\n\nCan I give my possessions away before I die?\n\nYou can give your property away before you die, but you should consider:\n\nThe rules on Capital Acquisition Tax (CAT) mean that the person you are giving your possessions to might have to pay tax. CAT may also be charged on an inheritance.\n\nIf a court finds that you gave away property before you died with the intention of unfairly reducing the legal right share of a spouse, civil partner or the rights of any child, the person who received the inheritance could be made to pay it back to the estate.\n\nCommon problems and disputes about wills\n\nWhen you make your will, you should consider some common problems that result in a gift made in a will being invalid.\n\nThe possession that you want to leave to someone may be lost or no longer exist at the time of your death.\n\nThere is confusion about the identity of a beneficiary. For example, you leave a gift to your cousin, Jim, and you have two cousins named Jim.\n\nIf the gift is not clearly identified in your will or it does not conform to its description in the will.\n\nIf you leave a gift to a person who is a witness to your will, that gift will be invalid.\n\nJoint bank accounts\n\nIf you have a joint bank account with your spouse, civil partner or child, usually the surviving account holder will be fully entitled to the money in the account when you die.\n\nIf you open a joint bank account with a relative or friend so that they can help you manage your money and do not intend that person to own the money in the account after you die, you should make this clear when you are opening the account.\n\nDisputes about wills\n\nMost wills are not disputed, but if there is a disagreement, it must be settled in court. The court will give effect to the testator’s wishes as expressed in the will if possible.\n\nThe testator's wishes are taken from a reading of the will as a whole, with words and phrases given their ordinary meaning unless they are technical words and it can be assumed the testator meant them to be taken in their technical meaning.\n\nEvidence outside the will, like letters or notes that refer to the will in advance of its making, may be introduced to the court to explain more fully the testator's intentions and to help discover the true meaning of the will.\n\nBecause wills can be disputed, it is important that you write your will in simple, straightforward language. Statements which could have more than one meaning should be avoided.\n\nUndue Influence\n\nActing under undue influence means that you are acting under pressure from another person or persons. Your will can be challenged on the basis that you were acting under duress when you made it and the will doesn’t reflect what you actually wanted.\n\nWho can read my will after I die?\n\nAfter probate has been taken out on a person's will, that will then becomes a public document and anyone can get a copy of the will and the grant of probate of these documents from the Probate Office or relevant District Probate Registry using Form PAS1 (doc). Probate is the process of getting authorisation to represent you and carry out the wishes set out in your will.\n\nThe grant sets out the name and address of the executor or administrator of the estate and the name of the solicitor acting on their behalf (if any). It also sets out the gross value and the net value of the estate.\n\nDetailed information about the estate is not normally available to the general public, however, certain people may be able to inspect the Inland Revenue Affidavit or the Statement of Affairs (Probate) SA.2 Form which contains the detailed information. They include:\n\nA beneficiary who is named in the will\n\nSomeone who is entitled to a share of the estate\n\nA child who is entitled to bring proceedings against the estate under Section 117 of the Succession Act 1965\n\nInformation on obtaining a copy of a will is available on the Courts Service website as well as in the information notes of Form PAS1.\n\nThe Probate Office also sends copies of the will, the Grant of Representation and the Inland Revenue Affidavit to the Revenue Commissioners.\n\nFurther information and contacts"
