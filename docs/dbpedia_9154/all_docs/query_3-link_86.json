        "text": "Death is a part of life. We know this is true for ourselves, and also for the people we care about. There are many treatment options to help extend a person’s life. But they often don’t improve a person’s quality of life. And nothing can hold off death forever. All of this means that dying can be a complicated process to navigate.\n\nIt’s even more confusing when someone seems to get better just before they die. Some people get a surge of physical or mental energy in their final hours or days. They might even start to speak clearly for the first time in weeks, or years. But what does that mean for the person who is dying? And how can families and friends make sense of it?\n\nWhy do some people get a burst of energy before dying?\n\nIn the final days and weeks of life, a person’s body slows down a lot. They will talk less and sleep more. And they may eat and drink very little, or not at all.\n\nAbout 4 out of every 10 people will have a final surge of energy before they die. It’s sometimes called an “end-of-life rally.” If it happens at all, it’s usually just one episode in the last couple days of life. It may last just a few minutes. Or it might happen on and off for a day or so.\n\nBut why and how does this happen? Many people believe the answers are psychological or spiritual. There are many things that affect a person’s behavior, thoughts, and emotions in life. And so, it makes sense that what happens as we die, is also complex.\n\nFrom a medical and scientific standpoint, the understanding of end-of-life experiences isn’t clear. There aren’t many studies on what happens in a person’s brain as they’re dying. But in the studies that have been done, the brain seems to work harder just before death. Brain wave patterns in people who are dying look similar to the patterns seen when someone is processing something or trying to make sense of things.\n\nWhat a burst of energy can look like\n\nDuring this time, a dying person may:\n\nSuddenly sit up in bed\n\nSpeak more clearly, and for longer periods of time\n\nBe clear in their thinking when they weren’t before\n\nWant to have specific conversations\n\nAsk to eat or drink something\n\nSome people may have other end-of-life experiences in the days before they die. These could include:\n\nVisions of family or friends who have died\n\nConversations with people who aren’t in the room\n\nFeeling the presence of a person, animal, or spirit who brings them comfort\n\nA sense of being between two worlds\n\nImages of light, peace, or going on a journey\n\nWhat is terminal lucidity?\n\nTerminal lucidity is a type of mental energy surge before death. This is when a person who has a condition that affects their brain, can suddenly think and speak clearly. For example, a person who has dementia may remember and speak the names of family members — even if they haven’t been able to do so for a long time.\n\nSometimes, a serious disease like cancer can affect a person’s brain function at the end of their life. Their thinking or speech may have been hard to understand for days or weeks. But with terminal lucidity, they may be more focused and are able to have conversations.\n\nTerminal lucidity feels like a dying person unexpectedly comes back to being themselves. It might be as simple as a meaningful look or a smile. Or the person may speak just a few words. But caregivers often report that the person seems to be speaking almost normally. Terminal lucidity might only last moments. Or, it may happen on and off for a few days.\n\nTerminal lucidity doesn’t mean a person is going to recover. Usually, it means that someone is close to death. Often this happens within a few hours or days. And, like all end-of-life surges, scientists don’t know why it happens in some people and not in others.\n\nSome people with chronic conditions may have these kinds of episodes at other times. This is called paradoxical lucidity. For example, a person with Alzheimer’s disease may have moments or days when their thinking suddenly appears much clearer. With paradoxical lucidity, it doesn’t always mean a person is going to die right away. But it is more common toward the end of their life.\n\nHow to recognize a final surge of energy before death\n\nIn the last days of life, a dying person can sometimes seem more active in different ways. They may seem more confused or agitated. They might pick at the bedcovers or at their clothes. They may grimace, moan, reach for things in the air, or talk in a way that doesn’t make sense.\n\nThese signs are more common in a condition called delirium. Delirium may be a result of the person’s underlying health condition. Or it may be part of the dying process itself.\n\nIf someone seems upset, uncomfortable, or disturbed, medications may help.\n\nBut an end-of-life energy surge is different. The dying person doesn’t seem confused or in pain.\n\nSomeone experiencing an end-of-life surge is awake, and usually calm. They may try to communicate more. They might want to sit up, or even eat. For some people, this is a time to say their goodbyes or complete a certain task. It may be part of a final effort to make meaning of their life, or to reconcile relationships.\n\nThey might also be seeing or hearing things that other people can’t. And they can often describe what they’re experiencing. They may be surprised by their visions and dreams, or curious about them. Sometimes they ask if other people see or hear the same things they do. But they’re not troubled or upset. Often, these experiences bring them comfort.\n\nHow to cope when a loved one experiences terminal lucidity\n\nTerminal lucidity — or any kind of energy surge — can be a source of comfort for a person’s loved ones. And for the dying person themselves. It may provide an opportunity for meaningful conversations, or a time to share important information.\n\nBut terminal lucidity and final surges can also be confusing. It might feel like a person is going to recover. But it’s actually a sign that they are close to death. These can create false hope, and may cause conflicts within a family. They may even lead to attempts to keep someone alive when that’s not the best course of action.\n\nIf a loved one experiences a final energy surge, be open to whatever happens. Take in what they have to say, and share your feelings with them.\n\nIf they see or experience things that you don’t, it’s best just to listen. Sharing end-of-life experiences may be a comfort to them. But if they think they are being judged, or told their experiences aren’t real, they’ll be less likely to share. Stay curious. Listen and ask questions, rather than correcting or arguing.\n\nAnd if someone doesn’t have an end-of-life rally toward the end of their life, that’s also completely normal. Dying is something that everyone does in their own way. Try to make your loved one comfortable. Honor their wishes as much as possible. Beyond that, there is no right or wrong way to die.\n\nBeing with someone as they’re dying can be a profound and meaningful experience. But caregiving can also be exhausting. There are lots of emotions involved. Take care of yourself by:\n\nMaking space for your own feelings\n\nGetting enough sleep\n\nEating regular, nutritious meals\n\nTaking care of your own health needs\n\nTaking breaks\n\nPracticing deep breathing, mindfulness, or prayer\n\nUsing hospice as a resource when you can\n\nLeaning on others, including family, friends, neighbors, and faith communities\n\nThe bottom line\n\nSome people have a burst of physical and mental energy in the hours or days before they die. For the person and their loved ones, a final surge of energy may be a surprising and meaningful part of the dying process. Although it may appear that they are getting better, it usually means they are close to death. People may also have other end-of-life experiences like dreams and visions. But not everyone does. How a person dies is as unique as the way they lived their life."
