We're All Gonna Die is Freddie Wong and Matt Arnold's first feature film starring Ashly Burch and Jordan Rodrigues, and had its world premiere at SXSW 2024. In the near future, a towering alien "spike" materializes in Earth's atmosphere, wreaking havoc. Years later, it's still around. A struggling beekeeper is forced to team up with an emotionally raw EMT on a roadtrip to retrieve her bees (and his car) after their stuff is suddenly teleported across the country by the alien spike.
