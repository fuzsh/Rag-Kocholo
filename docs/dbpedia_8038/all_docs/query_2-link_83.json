Han of Iceland (original French title: Han d'Islande ) is the first novel written by the French poet and novelist Victor Hugo . Published in 1823 , when the author was twenty-one years old, it is one of the works that establishes him as a great master of Romanticism . Although it is a mere melodrama , this novel already points to Hugo's wayand his taste for contrasts that reveal the perpetual struggle of good and evil. The novel takes place in 1699 , in a fictional kingdom of Iceland imagined by the author. Ordener Guldenlew, a knight, son of an important baron of the Scandinavian Kingdom, loves Ethel, a girl who lives in a prison with her father, Schumaker, who twenty years ago was a Chancellor of the Kingdom imprisoned on false accusations made by a rival, Ordener Guldenlew's father, who intended to usurp his position. Ethel, also in love with the knight, does not know the surname of her lover."
