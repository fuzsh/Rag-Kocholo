        "text": "Victor Marie Hugo was a leading figure in the French Romantic movement. His prolific body of work, which includes novels, plays, poems, and political speeches, demonstrates his mastery of language and his commitment to social justice.\n\nHugo's poetry is characterized by its emotional intensity, lyrical beauty, and epic scope. He experimented with various poetic forms, from sonnets to dramatic monologues, and explored themes of love, loss, nature, and the human condition. He often employed vivid imagery and symbolism, infusing his verse with a sense of grandeur and pathos.\n\nWriting during a period of rapid social and political change, Hugo's work reflects the revolutionary spirit of the times. He was a staunch advocate for democracy, freedom of speech, and the abolition of poverty and oppression. These ideals found expression in his writing, particularly in his epic novels, such as Les Mis√©rables and Notre-Dame de Paris, which remain enduring classics today."
