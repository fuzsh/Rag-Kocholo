        "text": "(1802–85). The great French novelist and poet Victor Hugo created two of the most famous characters in literature—Jean Valjean, the ex-convict hero of Les Misérables, and the hunchback Quasimodo in The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Known for the vast range and immense quantity of his output, Hugo was able during much of his long life to write as many as 100 lines of verse or 20 pages of prose each day.\n\nVictor-Marie Hugo was born in Besançon on Feb. 26, 1802, the son of an officer in Napoleon’s army. Hugo’s father and mother did not get along, and most of his early years were spent in Paris, where his mother preferred to live. Hugo and his two brothers knew their father from occasional visits as a grand man in a splendid uniform.\n\nIn preparatory school, Hugo began to write. He won poetry prizes and wrote for a literary magazine he helped found. In 1821 the magazine failed. Hugo’s mother died the same year. After a period of extreme poverty, Hugo was awarded an annual pension by Louis XVIII for his ‘Miscellaneous Odes and Poems’, published in 1822. He then married his childhood sweetheart, Adèle Foucher.\n\nBetween 1822 and 1832 Hugo established himself as a major literary figure in France. He wrote poetry, novels, and plays and became a leader in the Romantic movement. (See also French literature.)\n\nIn 1830 his play Hernani was a spectacular success. By shattering the artificial rules that had previously governed the writing of French drama, Hugo brought new freedom to the French stage. His novel Notre Dame de Paris was published in 1831. Translated as The Hunchback of Notre Dame, it became vastly popular in many countries. In 1832 his play Le Roi s’amuse, or The King’s Diversion, on which Giuseppe Verdi later based his opera Rigoletto, was staged. Like so many of Hugo’s works, The Hunchback of Notre Dame and The King’s Diversion were criticisms of social and political injustice. Another reason for writing the plays was to provide parts for the young actress Juliette Negroni, who became his mistress in 1833 and was to be his companion for the rest of her life.\n\nIn 1841 Hugo was elected to the French Academy, and in 1849 he became a member of the National Assembly. An outspoken political opponent of Napoleon III, Hugo had to flee France in 1851.\n\nHe remained in exile until 1870. During that time he wrote some of his finest works. In 1862 appeared Les Misérables, one of the most popular novels of all time. Hugo’s wife died in 1868, and Negroni moved into his home.\n\nAfter the fall of the empire in 1870, Hugo returned to Paris. There he lived the rest of his life as a literary idol. Huge crowds turned out to celebrate his 80th birthday. Hugo died in Paris on May 22, 1885, and is buried in the Panthéon."
