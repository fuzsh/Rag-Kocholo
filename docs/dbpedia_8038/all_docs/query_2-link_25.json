        "text": "Few writers have the honour of becoming an eternal symbol for the literature of their country (a feat that is especially complicated in turbulent times of literary frenzy, as that of 19th century France). It is the case of the emblematic Victor Hugo, the author who should be considered France’s national writer, because of his unique, extensive works (across all genres) and his even more extensive domination of French literature in his era. Although Victor Hugo wasn’t the father of French Romanticism, title exclusive to Chateaubriand (curiously, the idol of his youth), in him it reached its perfection and its most impacting, most human form.\n\nVictor Hugo’s fame abroad originates from his novels. Although difficult to classify because of Hugo’s constant evolution, blurred literary barriers and marked idiosyncrasy, his spectrum ranges from social criticism to Romantic fantasy. He maintains a quite poetic and passionate prose, with strong dialogue, lengthy descriptions and myriad digressions on philosophical, moral, social, historical, political or religious themes that underpin the novels’ messages. The Last Day of a Condemned Man is at one end, conveying a forceful and direct social criticism against death penalty; on the other end there is Toilers of the Sea, a prose epic full of grandiosity, driven by Romantic elements such as an imposing, feared Nature, the unknown and deformed yet beautiful characters. Victor Hugo’s best novels lie in a sort of middle-ground, following the Romantic fashion for historical backgrounds. Notre-Dame de Paris (The Hunchback of Notre-Dame) is a Gothic historical epic of memorable Romantic protagonists: the poet Gringoire, the bohemian Esmeralda and Quasimodo the Hunchback (nowadays distorted by Disney). Esmeralda’s beauty ends in fatality and Gringoire is corrupted whilst Quasimodo demonstrates intelligence and sensibility, in an ironic tragedy that deals with destiny’s fatal turns, political and historical thought and the deformation of viewpoints. Moreover, the setting includes admirable descriptions of Gothic architecture in the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. Les Misérables (The Miserable), Victor Hugo’s famous masterpiece, is closer to melancholic observation of real social problems. Hugo displays his thoughts from a Romantic perspective on oppression, poverty, ideal love as saviour, religious hope… The protagonist Jean Valjean, centre of the novel, evolves throughout, in a biographical arc that reflects the triumph of good in the universal human soul despite misery in society. Around Valjean, in a world of lowliness and dire social conditions, the other characters seek some dignity. Although he was quite distant from Realism, Hugo innovatively introduced here slang and vernacular as well, adding the last straw for his Misérables to become absolutely revolutionary.\n\nThe political and religious ideas Victor Hugo started defending in his novels were very controversial, even for literary intellectuals like Flaubert, who ironically was later on put to trial for the ‘indecency’ of his Madame Bovary. Hugo campaigned for liberalism, social causes and republicanism. He also took an anti-Catholic position, claiming his inclination towards rational freethought in the line of Voltaire’s Deism.\n\nRegarding his poetry, from the many volumes he published, perhaps the most significant are The Contemplations, Songs of Twilight, Leafs of Autumn… As one may notice from the titles, Hugo explored the key Romantic lyrical notions of darkness and the Gothic, introspection and meditation, nostalgia and melancholy, the intimate… However, he also deals with social issues, a personal preoccupation of his, by writing satires, some of them against Napoleon III, dictatorial ruler of the time. Age and the unexpected, accidental death of his beloved daughter Léopoldine made Hugo feel as melancholic as ever, which is reflected in his writing (particularly the elegies to Léopoldine). In his great epic in two volumes called The Legend of the Centuries, Hugo then comes back on all of his lyrical, satirical, Gothic and intimate voices to depict the evolution of humanity. His poetic style is at times rhetorical, following the Romantic standard, but maintains an overall polished approach. Careful musicality and rhythm are also very present, albeit much of it is lost in translation.\n\nIn his theatrical works, Victor Hugo was far from being a lesser figure. Inspired by Shakespeare, he aimed to unite the dichotomised aspects of classic French theatre (the comical, satirical style of Molière and the historical, tragic style of Corneille or Racine), for blends between social criticism and artistic beauty as well as comedy and tragedy. Therefore, Hugo became one of the key players in the renewal of French theatre through Romantic drama. In The King Amuses Himself and Lucrezia Borgia, he uses an historical background as basis for tragicomic social criticism. What is most remarkable is Hugo’s creation of the Romantic anti-hero Triboulet in The King Amuses Himself, a Shakespearean jester who is paradoxically both grotesque and sublime, and his inversion of roles (eg. servants becoming powerful).\n\n[Anecdote: Victor Hugo was also interested in drawing. It seems he had no artistic frontiers. See one of his drawings below]\n\nPASSAGE FROM LES MISÉRABLES\n\nThe soul gropes in search of a soul, and finds it. And that soul, found and proven, is a woman. A hand sustains you, it is hers; lips lightly touch your forehead, they are her lips; you hear breathing near you, it is she. To have her wholly, from her devotion to her pity, never to be left alone, to have that sweet shyness as, to lean on that unbending reed, to touch, Providence with your hands and be able to grasp it in your arms; God made palpable, what transport! The heart, that dark celestial flower, bursts into a mysterious bloom. You would not give up that shade for all the light in the world! The angel soul is there, forever there; if she goes away, it is only to return; she fades away in a dream and reappears in reality. You feel an approaching warmth, she is there. You overflow with serenity, gaiety, and ecstasy; you are radiant in your darkness. And the thousand little cares! The trifles that are enormous in this void. The most ineffable accents of the womanly voice used to comfort you, and replacing for you the vanished universe! You are caressed through the soul. You see nothing but you feel yourself adored. It is paradise of darkness."
