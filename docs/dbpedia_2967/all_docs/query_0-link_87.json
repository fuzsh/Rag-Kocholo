        "text": "Inhalation and ingestion of lead particles and fumes during firing and handling of weapons and ammunition\n\nMost ammunition (bullets) contains lead. They are either made entirely from lead, a lead alloy (brass or copper casing) or include a lead primer, which is the explosive that ignites the gunpowder and commonly consists of lead styphnate.\n\nWhen a bullet is fired, fumes and fine lead particles are released into the air. Any person standing close by can breathe in the fumes and particles which when inhaled into the lungs are absorbed directly into the bloodstream.\n\nLead particles can also settle on the skin of a person’s hands and body or be transferred to the skin when a person handles ammunition particularly during reloading, cleaning the gun or firing the gun. You can ingest lead from your hands if you don’t wash them before drinking, eating, smoking or preparing food.\n\nLead particles collecting on a person’s body and other surfaces\n\nLead particles are very fine and can remain suspended in air for longer than expected and/or stick to a person’s face, hands, hair, clothing or shoes. Not only can a person inhale the fine suspended particles, but they can also transport the fine lead particles on their body, clothing and equipment into their car and then into their home.\n\nSurfaces at a shooting range, both indoor and outdoor can become contaminated with lead particles which can be ingested or inhaled.\n\nCasting bullets\n\nThe highest exposure for people who cast bullets is from inhaling the lead fumes released during the melting process of lead. Ingesting fine lead particles released from processes involving the solid lead and handling bullets and spent casings without gloves also increases exposure.\n\nLead exposure can cause serious health problems and lead is particularly hazardous to infants, children, and pregnant women.\n\nIf you are pregnant, take appropriate precautions to minimise exposure to lead.\n\nWe recommend children do not attend shooting ranges and that you take precautions to ensure that your clothes and body are free from any lead particles before hugging children or handling toys.\n\nIt is important that anyone in the household who uses guns and ammunition takes steps to reduce lead exposure so that lead particles are not brought into the car or home on clothes, body (face and hands), or the equipment used.\n\nIf you regularly visit shooting ranges let your GP or doctor know and get your blood lead level tested.\n\nMinimising contact with the lead fumes and particles is the best way to prevent exposure.\n\n1. Choose your shooting range carefully\n\nBefore you use a shooting range, ask yourself the following:\n\nIs it well ventilated?\n\nDoes the range have a well maintained and effective ventilation system?\n\nIs the range and the communal areas well maintained, clean and free from visible dust?\n\nDoes the facility promote good hygiene practices?\n\nDoes it offer showers and change rooms facilities?\n\n2. Wear a properly fitted respirator (particularly when casting bullets)\n\nWear a properly fitted respirator that meets Australian Standards (AS/NZS 1716). A disposable or reusable Class P2 half face respirators (particulate filter for dust and fumes) is commonly used. Trim and shave facial hair so that you are clean shaven where the respirator seals/fits on the face. Remember to regularly replace filters on reusable respirators.\n\n3. Wear gloves and eye protection\n\nWearing gloves and eye protection whilst shooting, cleaning and reloading will minimise your exposure to lead.\n\n4. Don’t eat, drink, chew gum or smoke while shooting\n\nLead particles can inadvertently be ingested by hand to mouth contact. Avoid eating, drinking, chewing and smoking when shooting. Cigarettes contain lead so quitting smoking will help to minimise exposure.\n\n5. Wash hands, face and neck after shooting\n\nReduce the likelihood of fine particles of lead remaining on your body by washing your hands, face and neck after shooting in cold soapy water.\n\n6. Change and clean your clothes\n\nAfter shooting, change your clothes, preferably at the range, place them in a washable or disposable bag, and wash them separately to other laundry in the home.\n\n7. Transition to lead free ammunition\n\nUse lead-free primers and lead-free bullets or jacketed bullets (e.g. coated with copper/nylon)."
