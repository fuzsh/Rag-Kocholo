        "text": "1. Always wear proper eye and ear protection while shooting.\n\n2. All persons must remain behind the shooter when the target is in use.\n\n3. Target must have a proper backstop and never be shot at an angle from the side that might cause a bullet to deflect in an unsafe direction.\n\n4. Target must be placed over a surface that will reduce or eliminate the likelihood of bullet fragments traveling in an unsafe direction.\n\n5. Use target only in an area that will not cause a fire due to hot bullet fragments or sparks caused by bullet impact with target or target mounting system.\n\n6. Target must be mounted with the shooting face of the target angled down toward the ground. A 10-20 degree angle from vertical is recommended.\n\n7. 1/4” thick targets are intended for use with non-magnum class handgun, shotgun birdshot, and supersonic .22LR rimfire ammunition only at appropriate distances described below.\n\n8. 3/8” thick targets are intended for use with handgun, rifle, and supersonic rimfire cartridges as well as shotgun birdshot, buckshot and slugs only at appropriate distances described below.\n\n9. 15 yards is the minimum shooting distance when using non-magnum class handgun, supersonic .22LR rimfire, and shotgun birdshot ammunition.\n\n10. 25 yards is the minimum shooting distance when using shotgun buckshot.\n\n11. 50 yards is the minimum shooting distance when using magnum class handgun ammunition, and shotgun slugs.\n\n12. 100 yards is the minimum shooting distance when using standard rifle ammunition under 2,500 fps upon impact and less than 3000 ft/lb of energy upon impact.\n\n13. 250 yards is the minimum shooting distance when using magnum class rifle ammunition under 2,500 fps upon impact and less than 3000 ft/lb of energy upon impact.\n\n14. To extend the life of your target, projectiles must be traveling less than 2500 fps upon impact and deliver less than 3000 ft/lb of energy upon impact while maintaining the above minimum distances. Reference ballistic tables for your cartridge to determine appropriate shooting distances while maintaining the above minimum distances.\n\n15. Steel targets are not rated for use with sub-sonic rimfire ammunition, steel shot, non-lead pellets or BB’s, steel core, steel jacketed, bi-metal jacketed, incendiary, armor piercing, tracer, A-frame style, solids, solid brass, or solid copper bullets. Targets are designed for use with lead and copper jacketed lead core bullets only.\n\n16. All targets are considered consumable and will wear as they are shot. It is the responsibility of the user to only shoot the target at safe distances and distances that minimize wear of the target. If you notice unacceptable wear, ensure you are following the above directions for minimum shooting distances. Otherwise extend the shooting distance to the target until wear is minimized.\n\n17. Inspect target before each use and replace target when severely pitted or otherwise damaged. Remember, both sides of the target can be used. A severely pitted or damage steel target can present a hazardous situation due to unpredictable bullet fragmentation or ricochet.\n\n18. Targets and target stands will accumulate lead residue when shot. Always wash your hands with soap and water after handling targets, target stands, and before eating or drinking."
