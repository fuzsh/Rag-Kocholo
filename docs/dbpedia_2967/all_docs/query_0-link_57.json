        "text": "I agree with most L.Dutch says, including the point that only skilled and heroic characters should attempt this. One little issue regarding the semi-automatic pistol:\n\nRacking the slide back and holding it open should prevent fire. Pulling it back ejects the unfired round in the chamber, holding it prevents the chambering of a new round. It might be possible (but painful) to jam a finger in somewhere to prevent the grip from slipping.\n\n(Disclaimer: I don't know that from personal experience. Sounds like a way to the Darwin Awards. But the mechanics seem straightforward.)\n\nA somewhat silly solution:\n\nA good bunch of handguns have a considerable amount of empty space behind the trigger. If you can slide your finger there, you'll prevent the trigger from being pulled at all, so no firing can take place.\n\nKeep in mind that the possibility of pulling this off varies wildly with every trigger design. Some weapons have enough space to put a finger behind the trigger, others don't, others don't even have any gap there. Furthermore, as @JGreenwell points out, some modifications can change the weapon's behavior and cause the weapon to fire even when there is space to do such a thing.\n\nThat said, since this is your work of fiction, it is not hard at all to set up things to make this trick possible by choosing a proper handgun for the scene.\n\nOther people have answered but nobody has actually given reasons this is done/not done so let me relate my military police training:\n\nFirst, yes to all of your questions with a bit of a caveat: there are small hammer and hammer-less guns which prevent blocking the hammer (see pg. 3 and 20 of police tactics document) so only option there is cylinder2 or slide.\n\nNow for what officers and military teach for this situation:\n\nGross-motor skills are limited in \"fight or flight\" situations (pg. 14). So reaching, grabbing, and trying to stick fingers or remember to hold a weapon \"just so\" are not skills you want to rely on. What we do teach is to use your elbows and knees and grab the weapon with both hands. Part of the reason is that if I have both hands on the weapon I at least have a chance to stop the slide, hammer, or cylinder.1\n\nUse improvised weapons - for officers this involves getting them to know that \"if I have a heavy radio/clipboard/pen it will hurt when I swing it\" (pg.9-11). So the tactics would be more to ensure the muzzle is not pointed at you - again with gross-motor skills this involves more of a push or grabbing the wrist for better control - then bashing the suspect with whatever you got or even just throw stuff at him to distract and confuse so you can either get away or get in close. In fact, we advise against grabbing the actual gun3 because if it does fire - your hand will now be damaged (burned or \"bitten\"1).\n\nSo yes, yes you can stop the hammer, cylinder, or slide and have a handgun not fire but if it happens it would likely look more like the above than anything like hollywood shows.\n\nPolice Survival Guide, Police: the law enforcement magazine\n\n1 Search for beretta bite if you want to know what that pain looks like\n\n2 There is a story in Ip Man's biography (and portrayed in the movie from it) that he once knocked the cylinder out of an old (pre-WWII to WWII) revolver - unknown validity\n\n3 At this point, the idea would be once the suspect is in pain/distracted - then try and take the gun using standard hand-to-hand techniques. However, I've actually seen another officer grab a suspect weapon when doing this and manage to both stop the gun from firing and pop the magazine out (he admitted it was dumb luck, surprised him as much as suspect, but it happens)\n\nFor a revolver type, blocking the hammer or the cylinder can prevent firing. I think these are two of the reasons why a revolver can get jammed and fail to fire.\n\nFor an automatic or semi automatic gun, the slider moves after the shot has been fired to allow the expulsion of the muzzle. So, even if you were able to hold it in place, the bullet would already be travelling to its target.\n\nIn both cases, considering that the gun won't be calmly in place but its holder would probably attempt to shake it free from your grip, I think it's, to put it mildly, a rather daring attempt.\n\nAddendum: incidentally, I just watched City Hunter, season 1 episode 35. They prevent the bad guy from firing a revolver exactly by holding the barrel.\n\nTL;DR : Most of the time, yes.\n\nIt is actually very possible for both type of handguns.\n\nA semi automatic handgun (the one you call slider) can, on its own, fail to go into battery. I'll let you look for pictures but the point is that the slide did not complete its travel to \"close\", even by as few as 1 or 2 millimeters. The striker then can't hit the primer on the bullet therefore gun not firing. Applying pressure on a loaded gun with your hand to get slide slightly back would effectively partially disarm the firearm.\n\nBlocking the hammer on a classic revolver pistol will have the desired effect. Why do I precise classic ? Because some revolvers, mostly subcompacts only have internal hammers which can't be grabbed.\n\nAnother solution could be engaging the safety or blocking the trigger but those are even more complicated and risky.\n\nI see lots of speculation here, but there is no need. Infantry soldiers are trained to deal with this situation. If someone is pointing a loaded and non-safety firearm at a person and has a finger on the trigger, there is no way to disable the weapon from firing.\n\nThe proper way to handle such a situation is to push the firearm down in the direction opposite the hand on the trigger. That is the direction in which the hand is weakest and least likely to cause an accidental discharge. Needless to say, it is very risky and your hero would do good to jump in the opposite direction as well as push. Keep in mind that the weapon will likely discharge, so don't do that if your daughter is standing to that side. Just take the bullet yourself in that situation.\n\nTo make the task easier, have your hero distract the weapon-holder. Perhaps the hero could glance at a non-existent object behind the weapon-holder, causing the weapon-holder to momentarily glance rearward."
