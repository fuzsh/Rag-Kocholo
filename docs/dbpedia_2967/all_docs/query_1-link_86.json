        "text": "For months along the campaign trail, candidate Craig Greenberg promised one of his administration’s first priorities would be to find a way around a longstanding Kentucky law that requires police departments to send confiscated guns to the State Police for sale at auction.\n\nLess than two months after taking office, the new Louisville mayor unveiled that plan.\n\nIn a press conference Thursday morning at Metro Hall, Greenberg said he directed Louisville police to remove the firing pins from every seized weapon bound for auction, essentially rendering the guns temporarily inoperable.\n\nEach gun and its detached firing pin would be affixed with a warning label ― akin to the Surgeon General’s warnings on cigarette packs ― stating: \"Deadly weapons like this one caused 146 homicides by gunshot wound in Louisville in 2022. Fourteen of those deaths were children.\"\n\n\"Today is just the first step in our administration's effort to end our illegal gun trade, to end our illegal gun crisis and get metro government out of the gun business,\" Greenberg said.\n\nIt’s unclear how many auctioned guns end up being used in crimes, as no agency in the state tracks that data.\n\nBut two years ago, a Courier Journal investigation of State Police and Louisville police records uncovered more than two dozen examples of guns sold at auction later resurfacing in criminal cases across the city.\n\nWhile aimed at tamping down Louisville’s seemingly intractable gun violence epidemic, the move could be largely symbolic: One local gunsmith told The Courier Journal that firing pins are generally plentiful and inexpensive. Replacing them, while not always easy, is not terribly difficult either.\n\nA Kentucky State Police spokesman did not respond to a phone message and email asking what the agency would do with guns from Louisville.\n\nCJ investigation:Kentucky sells seized guns at auction and pockets the profits. Some get used in crimes\n\nIn fulfilling this campaign pledge, Greenberg sets Louisville up for a possible court challenge over the legality of his plan and potentially pits the new administration against a decidedly pro-Second Amendment legislative body that, with about a month left this session, could quickly amend the law to close the loophole Greenberg is attempting to exploit.\n\n“I don’t think the mayor of the largest city in the state should start his administration in a battle with the General Assembly,” said former Rep. Robert Damron, a Democrat-turned-Republican from Nicholasville, Kentucky, who authored the firearms auction law more than two decades ago.\n\nDuring Thursday's press conference, Greenberg encouraged lawmakers to pass a bill from Rep. Keturah Herron, D-Louisville, that would allow the city to permanently destroy confiscated firearms instead of sending them to auction.\n\n\"My team and I will be fighting for this bill in Frankfort,\" Greenberg said. \"And we hope state legislators will do the right thing and give Louisville the freedom that we want and need to get guns off of our streets once and for all.\"\n\nThe day after the mayor's announcement, another Democratic lawmaker from Louisville, Sen. Karen Berg, filed a similar bill that would require confiscated guns to be destroyed.\n\nNearly 30-year-old law funds police grants\n\nSince 1998, Kentucky law enforcement has been banned from destroying the deadly weapons they take off the streets. Instead, guns that cannot be returned to their legal owners must be sent to Kentucky State Police and sold at auction to federally licensed gun dealers.\n\nUnder the law, 20% of the proceeds from the sale of confiscated guns goes to the State Police to administer the auctions. The rest goes to the Law Enforcement Protection Program grants, administered by the state’s Office of Homeland Security.\n\nTens of thousands of weapons — pistols, rifles and shotguns — have been auctioned to the highest bidder over the years, netting millions of dollars in grants that help law enforcement agencies pay for potentially life-saving equipment for officers: body armor, tasers and duty weapons.\n\nLouisville police are by far the largest source of confiscated guns, sending around 8,000 to auction in 5 ½ years, The Courier Journal previously reported.\n\nIn that same span, the state awarded 380 grants totaling nearly $2.8 million to more than 200 entities across the commonwealth — large and small city police departments, county sheriffs, jails, university and school police.\n\n“Every firearm he renders useless, that’s taking money away from police departments and sheriff’s offices all over the state of Kentucky,” Damron said of the mayor’s plan. “And maybe they don’t have as much resources and tax capacity as Louisville, but they certainly have a need to protect law enforcement.”\n\nIn 2017 and again in 2019, the city of Louisville and Louisville police received more than $35,000 in grants to buy duty weapons and body armor.\n\n\"I will ensure that as long as I'm mayor, LMPD has the resources and they do not fall short in their resources in that regard because of this change of policy,\" Greenberg said.\n\nThe Kentucky State Fraternal Order of Police issued a statement on Twitter opposing the mayor's plan and Herron's bill.\n\n\"Statewide, this will have far reaching ramifications for police & sheriffs departments that rely on funds from the sale of these firearms to purchase life saving body armor for law enforcement,\" the FOP statement reads.\n\nMore:Shootings happen every day, yet Louisville can't pass tougher gun laws. Here's why:\n\nCritics fear law puts guns back on the streets\n\nFrom its inception, the auction law drew harsh rebukes and efforts by police chiefs in Louisville and Lexington to circumvent it by stockpiling confiscated weapons. Legislators responded by adding a 90-day deadline for sending guns to auction.\n\nCritics note the irony of a state selling guns to buy equipment to protect people from being killed by people with guns.\n\nMore:Awash in Guns: ‘It’s real easy to get a gun’ in Louisville. And it’s costing lives\n\nThe families of some crime victims, meanwhile, fear the gun used to kill or terrorize their loved ones could one day be back on the streets and inflict more harm.\n\nDamron and other defenders insist auctioned guns are no more likely to end up in the hands of criminals than any retail firearm.\n\nBut Kentucky’s limited gun laws and its fierce defense of the Second Amendment have created pipelines for auctioned guns to flow into the wrong hands. The Courier Journal’s past investigation found 31 incidents in which an auctioned gun was later tied to a criminal case in Louisville. A dozen of those guns had been auctioned more than once.\n\nAdditionally, nine auctioned guns were later reported stolen in Louisville.\n\nAll told, it’s a fraction compared with the thousands of guns auctioned each year in the state. But Louisville’s numbers alone indicate there likely are dozens more, if not hundreds, being used to commit crimes.\n\nBut Greenberg, noting the timing of his announcement Thursday — one year and two days from the day he was nearly killed in a shooting at his then-campaign office — said his plan for auctioned guns was worthwhile if it prevented one person from being killed or wounded in a shooting, or one family from having to suffer like the Gwynn family, who joined the mayor at his press conference.\n\nIn 2019, Krista and Navada Gwynn lost their son Christian, 19, to a fatal shooting. Two years later, their daughter, also 19, was wounded by gunfire that eventually killed 17-year-old DaJuan Coward.\n\n\"Taking the pin out right now is a steppingstone, and I appreciate that,\" Krista Gwynn said through tears. \"But the gun that killed my son should be destroyed. The gun that shot my daughter should be destroyed.\""
