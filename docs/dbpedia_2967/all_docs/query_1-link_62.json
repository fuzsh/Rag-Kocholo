Towns may regulate the discharge of firearms as provided by Title 30-A; however, they cannot regulate or charge fees to hunt, fish or trap.\n\nBack to top\n\nIllegal Devices\n\nIt is unlawful to hunt with the use of (or sell or offer for sale for the purpose of hunting) a set gun, or any medicinal, poisonous or stupefying substance (except rodenticide for orchard mouse control and gas cartridges for woodchuck control).\n\nDrawlocks and set bows are illegal unless otherwise permitted for disabled hunters.\n\nCrossbows cannot be used to hunt deer during the muzzleloader seasons.\n\nPlease see exceptions and additional information related to Crossbow Hunting.\n\nBack to top\n\nIllegal Use of Lights\n\nFrom September 1 to December 15, it is unlawful to use artificial lights from 1/2 hour after sunset until 1/2 hour before sunrise to illuminate, jack, locate, attempt to locate or show up wild animals or wild birds except raccoons which may be hunted at night with flashlights during the open season (see General Hunting Laws for details).\n\nAn exception to this may be made for agents appointed by the commissioner to hunt coyotes at night during this period under policies established by the Department.\n\nBack to top\n\nFirearms Laws\n\nIt is Unlawful to Hunt with, or Possess for Hunting, Any:\n\nAutomatic firearm (a firearm that continues to fire as long as the trigger is held back.)\n\nAuto-loading firearm (a firearm that reloads itself after each shot and requires a separate trigger pull for each shot) with a magazine capacity of more than 5 cartridges (plus 1 in the chamber for a total of 6), unless the magazine has been permanently altered to contain not more than 5 cartridges.\n\nNote: This provision does not apply to .22 caliber rimfire or smaller caliber guns or to auto-loading pistols with barrel lengths of less than 8 inches.\n\n3-shell Max for Migratory Game Birds:\n\nIt is unlawful to hunt any migratory game bird with a shotgun capable of holding more than 3 shells unless the magazine has been cut off, altered, or plugged with a one-piece filler (incapable of removal without disassembling the gun), so as to reduce the capacity of the gun to not more than 3 shells in the magazine and chamber combined.\n\nSilencers:\n\nWhile a person no longer needs a permit from Warden Service to hunt with a suppressor device, anyone who wishes to possess a firearm fitted or contrived with any device for deadening the sound of the explosion must still obtain the appropriate tax stamp from The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).\n\nBullet Types:\n\nIt is unlawful to hunt with cartridges that contain tracer bullets or explosive bullets.\n\nCartridges:\n\nFirearms with .17 or .22 caliber rimfire cartridges may not be used for deer, moose, or bear hunting, except that .22 magnum can be used for deer hunting.\n\nShotguns using shot loads cannot be used to hunt bear or moose.\n\nArchery Season Provisions:\n\nNo firearms of any kind may be carried while hunting deer with archery equipment during the regular archery or expanded archery seasons on deer, except a person may carry a handgun in accordance with Title 25 section 2001-A; but it cannot be used to shoot a deer or dispatch a wounded deer.\n\nBack to top\n\nLoaded Firearms in Motor Vehicles\n\nIt is unlawful to have a loaded firearm or archery equipment in or on a motor vehicle (including trailer, ATV, aircraft, snowmobile, or railway car), unless otherwise specified.

A crossbow is considered loaded if cocked and armed. Exceptions apply when carrying a con­cealed pistol or revolver.\n\nBack to top\n\nCarrying Concealed Firearms\n\nA person may carry a concealed handgun without a permit and may have that concealed, loaded pistol or revolver in, or on, a motor vehicle or trailer if:\n\nThe person is 21 years of age or older and is not otherwise prohibited from possessing a firearm or;\n\nThe person is 18 years of age or older and under 21 years of age and on active duty in the Armed Forces of the United States or the National Guard or is an honorably discharged veteran of the Armed Forces of the United States or the National Guard and is not otherwise prohibited from carrying a firearm.\n\nUpon contact with a law enforcement officer, a person carrying a concealed handgun without a permit is required to notify them immediately.\n\nBack to top\n\nArchery Information\n\nArchery Equipment: Archery equipment means a bow and arrow or crossbow.\n\nSeasons: The regular archery license allows archery equipment to be used to hunt all legal game throughout the year, except for deer during the muzzleloader season.\n\nLicenses: You must have an archery license to hunt with archery equipment during the regular and expanded archery deer seasons or hunt with archery equipment in general.\n\nJunior hunters who hold a valid Junior Hunting License are allowed to hunt with archery equipment when accompanied by a junior hunter supervisor (see Junior Hunters).\n\nLaws that allow you to hunt without a license on your own land under certain conditions apply to archery hunting (see Who Needs a License).\n\nPermits: In addition to an archery license, hunters participating in the expanded archery deer season (designated areas only) must also purchase permits. Multiple antlerless deer permits may be purchased for $12 each, and an either-sex permit for the expanded archery deer season is $32.\n\nExceptions: Complimentary archery license holders (Disabled Veteran, Native American) and junior hunting license holders may hunt with those licenses during the expanded archery deer season.\n\nObtaining an Archery License: Applicants for the regular archery license must show proof of having successfully completed an archery hunter education course or of having held a Maine adult archery license in any year after 1979, or evidence of previously holding a crossbow permit in Maine prior to 2024.

Use of a crossbow during the archery season doesnât require wearing hunter orange clothing unless firearms or muzzleloader hunting for deer can occur in that WMD or while a moose hunt is taking place, the November firearms season for deer is open or the muzzleloader season is open. These 3 seasons can overlap with expanded archery locations and the regular archery season.\n\nMoose Hunting Season\n\nAnyone who hunts any species with a firearm or crossbow in a Wildlife Management District that is open to moose hunting must wear one article of solid-colored hunter orange clothing (hats count).
