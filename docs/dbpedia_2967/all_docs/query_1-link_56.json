        "text": "Nope, I’m not talking about Johnnie Walker scotch or beer. Black Label is the name Browning has attached to a line of what they call “tactical gear” though I think “shooter’s gear” is probably a better name for the stuff. Part of the Black Label product line is clothing and while I wear a lot of Mountain Khaki clothing my Black Label, Tracer Soft Shell Jacket goes with me almost everywhere.\n\nBut that’s not the point of this post. If you have been following this blog you know that I am not at SHOT but I do have – in a tactical sense – operatives on the ground. The Intel I received this morning deals with a new handgun from Browning that is also part of the Black Label line.\n\nGuns have lot of serious uses but guns should also be fun. One of the most fun guns to shoot I have ever wrapped my hands around is Browning’s miniature 1911-22. (Check out the VIDEO) For 2014 Browning has tricked out this little gem and added practical sights, an ambidextrous thumb safety, a beavertail grip safety with a checkered memory pad, checkered front and back straps, skeletonized trigger and hammer and a rail on the dust cover.\n\nYep it looks like a high speed, low drag pistol but remember, this is a .22 LR pistol that is only 85% the size of a real 1911. These make great trail or house guns and your kids and wife will love to shoot them. They are particularly practical as a starter gun for the young and the old. This updated version of the Browning 1911-22 should sale about as well as Walker’s scotch but I’m thinking it will cost a few dollars more. Its not available for viewing on the Browning.com yet but the other four models of this pistol are. While you are checking those out, might as well investigate one of todays most overlooked defensive handguns."
