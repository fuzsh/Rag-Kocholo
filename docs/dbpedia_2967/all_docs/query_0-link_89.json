        "text": "Although firearms have changed a great deal since they were first invented, the terms used for their parts have changed very little. All modern firearms have three basic groups of parts: action, stock, and barrel.\n\nAction: The action is the heart of the firearmâ€”the moving parts that load and fire the ammunition and eject the shells or cartridges. Several types of actions are used in modern firearms. Muzzleloaders have locks instead of actions.\n\nStock: The stock is the part of the firearm that is held by the shooter. The stock also serves as the platform for supporting the action and the barrel."
