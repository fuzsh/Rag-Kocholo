        "text": "A man was found shot to death in a crashed car in a shooting that police said spread over more than a city block in West Philadelphia early Tuesday.\n\nOfficers were called to the Walnut Street just before 1 a.m. on Aug. 6, 2024, for a report of gunshots, Philadelphia Police Capt. Andrew DiSanto said.\n\n\"Prior to that call we had two vehicles proceeding westbound on the 5300 block of Walnut Street that encountered each other, a black Cadillac and a burgundy jeep,\" DiSanto said.\n\nThe driver of the Cadillac came under fire from up to several occupants of the Jeep, DiSanto said.\n\nBoth vehicles eventually crashed on the 5500 block of Walnut Street, striking several parked cars, police said.\n\nPolice found the Cadillac driver -- later identified as 30-year-old Tyree Allen of South 54th Street -- dead in the driver's seat of his crashed car, investigators said.\n\nOfficers also found the jeep with an AR-style rifle in the backseat and a 30-round extended magazine in the front seat. A few houses down the block, police found a pistol on the sidewalk.\n\nThere was evidence that at least 17 shots were fired, DiSanto said.\n\nHowever, police said they didn't find any people in the crashed jeep.\n\nBoth vehicles came to a rest against several parked cars, moving those cars several feet.\n\n\"They would have had quite a bit of force and speed behind the crash,\" DiSanto said.\n\nWalnut Street was closed for about five hours as police searched for clues. Investigators hoped that surveillance video would help them track down the shooters.\n\nDeadly violence is down this year in Philadelphia, but still taking its toll. Entering Wednesday, at least 161 people have been killed in Philadelphia this year, according to police data. That's down about 37% from the same date last year and the lowest homicide total since 2015.\n\nAs is the case for all homicides cases in Philadelphia, a $20,000 reward is being offered form info leading to an arrest and conviction. Anyone with info can contact police at 215-686-TIPS (8477) or homicide detectives at 215-686-3334."
