        "text": "HARRIS COUNTY, Texas (KTRK) -- Investigators say a man's dancing may have led to his shooting death in west Harris County earlier this week.\n\nThe Harris County Sheriff's Office said the alleged gunman, 43-year-old Nicholas Jackson, was arrested and charged with the murder of his cousin's boyfriend, 38-year-old Roy Perro.\n\nOn Monday, at about 7:20 p.m., deputies responded to the shooting in the 24100 block of Avogadro Drive, near Katy, and found the victim lying in the driveway next to a white SUV with an apparent gunshot wound to the head.\n\nORIGINAL REPORT: Man dies after being found shot in head in driveway of home near Katy, 2nd man charged with murder\n\nHCSO said Perro was taken to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.\n\nAccording to the sheriff's office, Perro's girlfriend was driving the SUV with her two male cousins in the back seat. One of the cousins, who officials identified as Jackson, started arguing with Perro before he allegedly pulled out a pistol and shot him in the head.\n\nJackson appeared in court Tuesday afternoon, where officials accused him of shooting the victim because he was apparently dancing in the car.\n\n\"Appears to be a shooting because the victim was dancing too much,\" a court official said. Authorities added the people in the car were allegedly using PCP.\n\nJackson's bond was set at $100,000.\n\nSubmit a tip or story idea to ABC13"
