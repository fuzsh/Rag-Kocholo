        "text": "Clear, clearing\n\nThe process of completely unloading a firearm and demonstrating that it is safe. “Clear” may also refer to a “safe range” in certain shooting competitions.\n\nClip, stripper clip, en bloc clip\n\nArchaically, the term “clip” was often used to refer to a removable box magazine, even by militaries and manufacturers. However, modern usage dictates that a clip is a device for holding cartridges together for ready insertion into a firearm’s magazine. A stripper clip is used to strip fresh rounds into an internal or detachable magazine and is then discarded, while an “en bloc” clip is inserted fully into the magazine (example: M1 Garand rifle) and is ejected with the empty casing when the firearm runs empty.\n\nCock, cocking\n\nThe act of manually pulling back the hammer, slide, or cocking piece of a gun, preparing it to be fired. The “cock” is also the part of a flintlock firearm that holds the flint and which falls when the trigger is pulled.\n\nCold range\n\nA range command or condition indicating it’s safe to walk down range, replace targets, etc. Usually, no firearms may be handled while the range is cold.\n\nCompensator\n\nSimilar to a muzzle brake, a compensator is a device attached or integral to a barrel’s muzzle, designed to reduce muzzle “flip” or climb by redirecting the expanding gases upward.\n\nCrosshairs\n\nTraditional telescopic sights (or scopes) contain physical or etched-on vertical and horizontal lines to aid with aiming. They are known as crosshairs due to their intersecting, cross-shaped design and thin profile.\n\nCylinder\n\nIn a revolver, a rotating cylinder contains multiple chambers. As the mechanism rotates each chamber into alignment with the barrel, the next projectile can be fired.\n\nCylinder bore\n\nA shotgun term designating that there is no choke or restriction at the front of the barrel.\n\nDecock, decocker\n\nThe action or part that safely lowers the hammer or removes tension on the striker when the shooter doesn’t wish to immediately fire a shot. Common on many double-action semi-automatic pistols.\n\nDA/SA\n\nThis acronym is used to describe “traditional” double action/single action semi-automatic pistols, such as the Beretta 92 series, the SIG P220 series, and the CZ75 series. These pistols have two trigger modes: 1. Double action (meaning the trigger performs both the function of cocking the hammer and firing the firearm) for the first shot; and 2. Single action for subsequent shots (meaning the trigger, once the hammer is cocked by the user or by the reciprocating slide after firing a shot, performs the single action of firing the next shot until the pistol is decocked or returned to double-action mode).\n\nDouble action, DA\n\nThis term refers to a firearm with a trigger system in which the trigger performs two functions: 1. Cocking the hammer (or striker), and 2. Releasing the hammer/firing a shot. Almost all modern defensive revolvers are double-action. However, on a traditional double-action revolver, the hammer may also be manually cocked by the shooter to fire a “single action” shot if desired.\n\nDouble action only, DAO\n\nA firearm (usually a revolver or semi-automatic handgun) with a trigger that returns fully forward, and a hammer or striker that returns to its down/forward or rested, uncocked position after each shot. The hammer or striker may not be manually cocked for a “single action” shot in this design.\n\nDouble tap\n\nWhen a shooter fires two shots in rapid succession.\n\nDown range, downrange\n\nThe area of a formal or informal shooting range in front of the firing line, where shooters may place targets and safely discharge their firearms.\n\nDram, dram equivalent\n\nShotgun projectile weights are typically measured in ounces in the US, and shotgun powder weights are often listed in drams or (usually) smokeless powder “dram equivalents” on commercial shotgun ammunition packaging. (A dram is an archaic weight measure left over from the days of black powder shotgun cartridges, but is still used today. Using that measure, 16 drams of black powder equal one ounce of weight, and 256 drams of black powder weigh one pound.)\n\nDry firing\n\nFiring a firearm when it’s “dry” means “unloaded.” For checking proper function or for training purposes, dry firing can be a useful practice. Certain competitions also require you to dry fire your firearm in a safe direction after unloading and showing “clear” to the Safety Officer. Always remove all ammo from the area and triple-check that the gun is unloaded before dry firing. Also, refer to your owner’s manual: some firearms cannot safely be dry-fired without damaging the gun.\n\nDud\n\nA round of ammunition that does not fire when the primer is struck by the striker or firing pin. A dud may be caused by deterioration (or absence) of the priming compound, a faulty primer, a weak hammer/striker spring, contaminated powder, or other factors.\n\nDummy, dummy round\n\nA training or action-proving round that contains no primer or powder.\n\nEars\n\nA gun-culture term for proper hearing protection. Often used by Safety Officers or trainers in the phrase “eyes and ears.”\n\nEjector\n\nA solid or spring-assisted firearm part that applies pressure to (usually) the left part of the rear surface of the fired cartridge case and pushes it out of the ejection port.\n\nExtractor\n\nThe extractor is a claw-like part that grabs onto the rim of the case and helps pull the spent case from the chamber.\n\nEyes\n\nA gun-culture term for proper protective eyewear. Often used by Safety Officers or trainers in the phrase “eyes and ears.”\n\nFailure to eject (FTE), stovepipe\n\nA type of malfunction in automatic or semi-automatic firearms where the fired/empty case is not completely ejected from the firearm, and may remain in the chamber or stuck partially in the ejection port. In pistol training, this may be referred to as a “stovepipe” when the empty brass is stuck between the slide/ejection port and the rear of the barrel, and it looks similar to an old stovepipe on top of a wood-burning stove.\n\nFailure to feed (FTF)\n\nA type of malfunction where the cartridge fails to properly enter the chamber for firing.\n\nFailure to Fire (Misfire)\n\nA type of malfunction when the trigger is pulled and the hammer, cock, or striker falls, but the primer, percussion cap, or flintlock charge fails to ignite the primary powder charge, and no projectile is fired.\n\nFor modern cartridge-firing guns, the NRA recommends waiting 60 seconds after a failure to fire before opening the action, with the muzzle pointed in a safe direction, and 2 minutes for a muzzleloader.\n\nFiring line\n\nAt a range, the line or area that shooters stay behind to safely fire their guns down range.\n\nFiring pin\n\nThis part is what impacts the primer, causing the powder to ignite, and fire the gun.\n\nFlintlock\n\nThis type of ignition system (for muzzleloaders) employs a piece of sharp flint to strike a metal surface, making sparks that ignite the priming charge of black powder, which then ignite the main charge and fire the gun. Sometimes informally called a “rock lock.” (Flint is a type of rock.)\n\nForend, forearm\n\nThe integral or separate part of a firearm’s stock where the shooter’s “support hand” grasps the firearm, usually below the barrel.\n\nFouling\n\nThis term describes any type of firing debris, carbon, lead, wax, or plastic in a firearm’s action or bore which can impede regular function, impair accuracy, and damage the gun if not removed through cleaning.\n\nFour rules, or the four rules of firearm safety\n\nThe four rules of firearm safety were initially developed by Colonel Jeff Cooper, the father of the Modern Technique of handgun shooting. There are many variations in wording, but the main points are:\n\n1. Always treat firearms as if they are loaded;\n\n2. Never let the muzzle cover anything you are not willing to destroy (in other words, always keep guns pointed in a safe direction);\n\n3. Keep your finger off the trigger until your sights are on the target and you’re ready to shoot,; and\n\n4. Be sure of your target and what’s behind it.\n\nFurniture\n\nIn gun speak, furniture refers to the buttstock and forend on a shotgun or rifle, usually when discussing wood parts, but also may refer to the buttstock, forend, and grip set of a modular rifle like the AR-15.\n\nGauge\n\nIn firearm terms, “gauge” refers to the size of a shotgun’s bore diameter or caliber. The smaller the gauge, the larger the bore diameter. A shotgun’s gauge was originally determined by the number of pure lead balls of bore diameter that would weigh one pound. The larger the gauge/ball, the fewer balls would weigh one pound. So, a 20-gauge shotgun (where 20 lead balls of bore diameter weigh one pound) has a smaller bore diameter than a 12-gauge shotgun (where only 12, larger, lead balls weigh one pound).\n\nThe term “gauge” may also refer to a measuring device to check cartridge headspace in reloading, or timing in a semi-automatic or automatic firearm, or headspace when setting barrel/chamber dimensions, or for other uses.\n\nGlock\n\nAny of various semi-automatic, short recoil-operated handguns designed and produced by the Austrian company, Glock Ges.m.b.H (trademarked as GLOCK). Glocks are now made in both Austria and the USA.\n\nGrain, grains\n\nBullet weights and powder charges for rifles and shotguns are typically measured in grains in most western countries. Grain is not an individual flake or granule of gunpowder, but rather a grain is a measurement of weight equal to 1/7,000th of a pound (there are 7,000 grains in one pound).\n\nGrip\n\nThe part of a firearm held by the firing hand (which manipulates the trigger). A grip can be a separate, removable piece, as on most revolvers or AR-15s, or it can simply describe the area of the wood or polymer buttstock of a rifle or shotgun where you grip it. A pistol’s grip may be integral to the frame, like on many polymer handguns, or it may have removable “grip panels” that the user can remove, replace, and customize as desired.\n\nHair-trigger\n\nA semi-archaic term describing a very sensitive trigger that will fire the gun with very little pressure. The term derives from the hyperbolic statement that the weight of a single hair is enough to fire the shot.\n\nHammer\n\nThe (usually external) part of some firearms is manually or mechanically “cocked,” or retracted against spring tension, and which is released when the trigger is pulled. The hammer then falls and strikes the firing pin or percussion cap, firing the gun.\n\nHandgun\n\nIn common usage, a handgun is a firearm designed and intended to be used by one or both hands, rather than resting a portion of the firearm against the shooter’s shoulder or cheek.\n\nHangfire or hang fire\n\nMore common in black powder firearms, or when using surplus cartridges of questionable quality and age, a hangfire is a momentary delay between the press of the trigger and the ignition of the primary powder charge. This can be a fraction of a second, or up to several seconds in extreme cases, and can be very dangerous if the shooter moves the gun off target or (worse) opens the action before the round discharges.\n\nHollow point, hollowpoint, JHP\n\nA bullet with a hollowed-out nose causes the bullet to expand on impact, delivering more energy to the target and controlling penetration. “Jacketed hollow point” or JHP is a common acronym used in defensive or hunting ammunition. The “jacket” is a copper (or similar) metal sleeve swaged or plated onto the exterior of a lead bullet.\n\nHolster\n\nThe means for carrying a firearm when not in the shooter’s hand. Usually, this term relates to a handgun, typically on the user’s belt, though there are pocket holsters and other holsters intended for mounting to tactical vests or in automobiles, etc. Most holsters today are made of polymer/Kydex, leather, or nylon.\n\nHot range, “range is hot”\n\nThis term describes an informal or formal shooting range that is being used or approved for live fire. It is not safe to walk downrange because firearms may be loaded and fired at any time.\n\nMuzzle\n\nThe end of a gun barrel where the fired projectile exits. In basic orientation terms, the muzzle is the opposite of the breech. “Muzzle” is also sometimes a range command during some practical shooting events, which a Safety Officer may call “muzzle” if you are pointing your firearm close to the limits of the shooting area or your own body. (See: Sweep.)\n\nMuzzleloader or muzzle-loader\n\nA firearm that is loaded from the muzzle, rather than from the breech, using loose black powder or compressed gunpowder pellets, and a separate projectile and priming mechanism, rather than utilizing a self-contained cartridge.\n\nOpen sight, open sights\n\nUsually, this term describes a type of iron sights where the rear sight is a simple notch that is “open” on top, rather than containing any sort of aperture or “peep” sight.\n\nOptic\n\nThis term generally refers to any electronic or mechanical sight that provides the shooter with a larger field of view around the target compared to open/iron sights. An optic may be magnified or non-magnified.\n\nPeep sight\n\nSee: Aperture sight.\n\nPercussion cap, cap\n\nIn black powder shooting, the percussion cap or “cap” is effectively the primer (see below) that ignites the powder charge when struck by the hammer, but some modern muzzleloader designs use primers in place of percussion caps.\n\nPistol\n\nOriginally the term pistol was used to describe any firearm intended to be held and fired with one hand, but today “pistol” usually refers to a semi-automatic handgun. A revolver is the other primary type of handgun.\n\nPlinking\n\nInformal target shooting at non-paper targets such as soda cans, clay pigeons, fruit, etc., is typically not done at a regulated shooting range. (Be sure to always clean up your mess.)\n\nPrimer\n\nThe part of a cartridge containing a small amount of shock-sensitive explosive material such as fulminate of mercury, lead styphnate, or bismuth oxide, which ignites when struck by the striker or firing pin, igniting the powder charge and firing the gun. In black powder shooting, the percussion cap or “cap” is effectively the primer, but some modern muzzleloaders use modern primers in place of percussion caps.\n\nRack\n\n“Rack the slide” or “rack the action” is a term typically used when discussing loading semi-automatic pistols and rifles, and describes the retraction of the slide or bolt to load/unload the chamber or to clear a malfunction.\n\nRecoil\n\nThe rearward movement of a gun when it is fired. (See also: Kick.)\n\nRed dot\n\nA type of electronically, chemically, radioactively, or solar-illuminated optic that uses a red dot or other reticle as the aiming point as you look through the device. (“Red dot” is a general term; many optics of this type use green or yellow illumination, and some can be switched selectively by the user.)\n\nRevolver\n\nA type of firearm, usually a handgun, includes a revolving cylinder containing multiple chambers, which are mechanically aligned with the barrel for each shot.\n\nRifling, rifled\n\nRifling is the spiral-patterned grooves in a firearm’s barrel that spin the bullet, improving accuracy. A rifled barrel has rifling; a smoothbore does not.\n\nRound\n\nToday, in common non-military usage, a round refers to one piece of ammunition or a single cartridge.\n\nScattergun\n\nAn archaic nickname for “shotgun.”\n\nSafety\n\nA manual or internal mechanism that prevents the firearm from being discharged unintentionally.\n\nSBR, short-barreled rifle\n\nIn the USA, a rifle with a barrel shorter than 16 inches must be registered as a “short-barreled rifle” with the ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives) and the owner must complete federal paperwork and pay a $200 tax prior to manufacturing or purchasing/transferring the rifle.\n\nScope\n\nA “telescopic sight,” (or scope) usually generally tubular in shape, is attached to the top of a firearm, allowing better target identification and improved potential accuracy at longer distances.\n\nSingle-action, single action only, SAO\n\nThis term usually refers to either a traditional, “cowboy-type” revolver or a semi-automatic pistol in which the hammer must be cocked before each shot, either manually by the shooter (in the case of the revolver) or mechanically by the reciprocation of the slide (in the case of the pistol).\n\nSilencer, suppressor\n\nA device attached (or integral) to the barrel of a firearm to reduce the amount of noise and flash generated when the gun is fired.\n\nSlide\n\nUsually, this refers to the top portion of a semi-automatic handgun that reciprocates rearward and forward as the firearm is fired.\n\nSlide stop, slide release, slide lock lever\n\nGenerally, these and similar terms (depending on the manufacturer’s terminology) refer to the mechanism that manually or automatically locks a pistol’s slide to the rear, either when the magazine runs empty, or for inspection/cleaning/disassembly.\n\nSling\n\nA strap of fabric or leather is used to secure a firearm (usually on a shooter’s shoulder for ease of transport) or assist in accurate aiming. Most commonly used on rifles.\n\nSlug\n\nTechnically, and most commonly, a slug refers to a shotgun round that contains a single projectile, rather than multiple pellets of shot. Informally, a slug may refer to any bullet, typically when referring to a projectile that has been fired and recovered. For more details see our Shotgun Ammo 101 article.\n\nSmith\n\nThis term is used both to refer informally to a Smith & Wesson brand firearm and as an abbreviated term for “gunsmith.”\n\nSmoothbore\n\nA firearm with a barrel that is not rifled. Almost all shotguns are smoothbores. Many antique and replica black powder muzzle-loading firearms are smoothbores.\n\nSquib\n\nA squib (also called squib round or squib load) is a dangerous condition in which either there is insufficient gunpowder in a cartridge to fully expel the projectile from the barrel, or the powder doesn’t ignite fully due to contamination, a bad primer, or other factors. This can result in the projectile being fired into the barrel and becoming lodged, and if not remedied before firing a subsequent shot, can destroy the firearm and injure the shooter or bystanders.\n\nStock, gunstock\n\nThe stock (commonly used) or gunstock is the part of a long gun that provides structural support, and to which the barreled action is attached. The stock also provides a means for the shooter to grasp and brace the gun, and hold the butt portion of the stock against the shoulder when aiming and shooting. “Stocks” may also refer to a revolver’s grip, usually when discussing wood or bone grips.\n\nStriker-fire, striker-fired\n\nIn modern nomenclature, the striker is effectively the firing pin that strikes the primer, causing the gun to fire. In a striker-fired design, there is no external or internal hammer that must be cocked in order to fire the gun. The internal striker is partially or fully retracted and released as the trigger is pulled, and the striker then moves forward under spring pressure to strike the primer. The Glock series of pistols is the most common modern type of striker-fired firearm.\n\nStrong hand\n\nIn firearm training or competition, your strong hand is your primary firing hand, or the hand you use to grip a handgun and to pull the trigger. Usually, if you’re right-handed, your right hand is your strong hand.\n\nSupport hand, weak hand\n\nIn firearm training or competition, your support hand is the hand other than your “strong hand,” and is used to provide a more stable grip on a handgun or to support the weight of a long gun. Usually, if you’re right-handed, your left hand is your support hand.\n\nSweep, sweeping\n\nIf you break the second of the four rules of firearm safety (see above), and allow the muzzle of your gun to inadvertently point at another person or part of your own body, it’s called “sweeping.” This will result in being disqualified from a shooting competition and possible disciplinary action in a police or military unit.\n\nTap-rack, tap-rack-bang\n\nA training term sometimes used in instructing shooters to clear malfunctions in semi-automatic or automatic firearms. “Tap” indicates the shooter should firmly strike the bottom of the magazine to ensure it’s fully seated, and “rack” indicates the shooter should smartly retract the slide, bolt, or bolt handle to expel a dud round, empty casing, or another firing blockage.\n\nTrigger, trigger guard\n\nThe trigger is what the shooter presses to make the gunfire, usually a vertical part that slides or pivots to the rear. Typically a shooter presses or “pulls” the trigger with his/her index finger. The trigger guard is the surrounding area of the firearm that prevents the trigger from being bumped or inadvertently contacted by clothing, brush, objects, etc.\n\nVault, gun vault, handgun vault, gun locker\n\nThe best home safe is very different from a gun vault or handgun vault. In common usage, the term “gun vault” is a room or enclosure with a secure locking mechanism, a hinged “safe” door, and provision inside for storage of firearms and protecting them from theft, unauthorized access, corrosion, and fire damage. Of course, other valuables and items may be stored in a gun vault as well. Since each room and gun vault builder is different, “gun vault” is necessarily a broadly defined term, but basically, the vault door is integral to creating a gun vault. The vault itself can be any room in your home, place of residence, or office that you secure with a vault door. That room effectively becomes your “gun vault.”\n\nA gun safe is a stand-alone container, usually made of steel, that may be moved from one location to another, and is generally much smaller than a vault. If you travel a lot, you can purchase a truck gun safe that is small enough to fit in your vehicle. The door and locking mechanism of a gun safe may be very similar to that of a gun vault. You can even purchase a biometric gun safe that will only open with the right fingerprint, just like large gun vaults.\n\nThere’s another way the term “gun vault” is sometimes used, though “gun vault” most often refers to a vault room with a vault door securing it. Handgun vaults are small gun safes intended to hold one or two handguns and other small valuables, which keep them secure but available for ready access to the authorized user. But when someone says “gun vault” they’re most often talking about a secure room with a “safe door” or vault door.\n\nFor more details, see our article on the difference between a gun safe and a vault.\n\nWadcutter, semi-wadcutter, SWC\n\nThis term refers to a specific type of bullet, designed to cut clean holes in paper targets for easier/more accurate scoring. A wadcutter, or “full wadcutter” bullet has a completely flat nose with sharp edges, basically a flying cylinder. A semi-wadcutter bullet takes that cylinder and adds an integral, truncated cone shape on top of it, also with a sharp, flat nose. Semi-wadcutter bullets are also sometimes used in hunting and defensive roles.\n\nWheelgun\n\nA gun-culture nickname for “revolver,” usually a double-action revolver.\n\nZero, zeroing\n\nYour gun’s “zero” is the point at which the sights are aligned with the desired point of projectile impact at a specified distance. You can adjust your gun’s zero by adjusting the iron sights (if an adjustment is possible on your firearm) or using the adjustment dials on a telescopic sight. This process is sometimes called “zeroing in” or “zeroing” your firearm.\n\nGet the best gun safes at Liberty Safe\n\nAs you become familiar with the relevant gun terms and safety practices, be sure to invest in a quality, USA-made gun closet gun safe or gun vault.
