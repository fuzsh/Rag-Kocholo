        "text": "by Susan Flantzer\n\n© Unofficial Royalty 2024\n\nNew Year’s Speech – December 31 – Denmark\n\nQueen Margrethe II gave the traditional New Year’s Speech on December 31, 2023. During the speech, she announced she would be abdicating on January 14, 2024 after 52 years on the throne.\n\nBackground\n\nEvery year at 6:00 PM, on December 31, the Danish monarch delivers the New Year’s Speech from Amalienborg, a complex of four palaces in Copenhagen, Denmark. Queen Margrethe II (reigned 1972 – 2024), who abdicated in 2024, gave the speech from Christian IX’s Palace, her home since 1967. Her son and successor King Frederik X will probably give the speech from Frederik VIII’s Palace, his home at Amalienborg since he married Queen Mary (born Mary Donaldson in Australia) in 2004. The speech is broadcast live on television and radio.\n\nThe origins of the New Year’s speech go back to King Christian IX (reigned 1863 – 1906) who gave a “toast to the fatherland” at the New Year’s Banquet on January 1 beginning in the 1880s. During the reign of King Frederik VIII (reigned 1906 – 1912), the nationwide daily newspapers began to publish the New Year’s Speech. In 1909, King Frederik VIII closed his speech with Gud Bevare Danmark! (God preserve Denmark!) Every Danish monarch since has closed their New Year’s Speech in the same manner.\n\nIn 1940, during World War II, Germany occupied Denmark. Unlike King Haakon VII of Norway and Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, both of whom went into exile during the German occupation of their countries, King Christian X (reigned 1912 – 1947) remained in Denmark. He is remembered for his daily horse ride without a guard through the streets of Copenhagen during the German occupation of Denmark, a symbol of Danish sovereignty. His New Year’s Speeches during World War II rallied the Danish people and offered hope and encouragement to a country in the grip of a German occupation.\n\nIn 1941, King Christian X gave the first New Year’s speech to be broadcast live over the radio, and seventeen years later, his son King Frederik IX gave the first televised New Year’s Speech in 1958. King Frederik IX was skeptical about television and avoided eye contact with the camera.\n\nHowever, when King Frederik IX’s daughter Queen Margrethe II came to the throne in 1972, she was well aware of television’s impact. Queen Margrethe II was not averse to reprimanding the Danish people, which she did in 1984, criticizing their behavior toward immigrants: “Then we come along with our Danish humor and little stupid, clever remarks. Then we respond to them with cold-heartedness, and then it’s not far to harassment and rougher methods – that’s not nice of us.” On December 31, 2023, in what would be her last New Year’s Speech, Queen Margrethe II unexpectedly announced that she would abdicate in favor of her son Crown Prince Frederik, just two weeks later, on January 14, 2024, the anniversary of her accession to the throne in 1972, upon the death of her father King Frederik IX.\n\nThe Text of the New Year’s Speech\n\nIn the early years, the Prime Minister’s office wrote the New Year’s speech which the Danish monarch read without making any changes. This changed during the reign of Queen Margrethe II who wanted to write the speech herself. The Prime Minister’s Office sent her a list of suggested topics in mid-October, and then she wrote the speech with the advisement of close colleagues. Shortly before New Year’s Eve, the Prime Minister’s office received the final draft for review.\n\nKing Frederik X will probably follow the guidelines of his mother Queen Margrethe II. Her New Year’s Speech began with a general discussion of the past year and then went on to a personal review, and the most important events of the past year. Upcoming events or anniversaries, especially of the royal family, were mentioned. The Danish monarch cannot interfere in politics and stays out of party political issues. However, Queen Margrethe II’s moral values influenced by her Christian faith were often evident. In her first New Year’s Speech in 1972, Queen Margrethe II expressed her hope for peace in the Vietnam War and addressed Denmark’s entry into the European Economic Community. Special greetings and thanks are given to selected groups at the end of the speech, and thanks are also given to Danes serving abroad or at sea or working in the police and military. The speech ends with the now traditional “Gud Bevare Danmark!” (God preserve Denmark!)\n\nNew Year’s Banquet and Levees – Early January – Denmark\n\nBackground\n\nAt least from the time of King Frederik III (reigned 1648 – 1670), the Danish public was allowed to come to Copenhagen Castle on New Year’s Eve, stand in rows along the wall, and watch the Danish royal family and the court eat. On New Year’s Day, anyone could go to the royal apartments to congratulate the King and Queen and deliver gifts and New Year’s poems. This custom ended during the reign of King Christian VI (reigned 1730 – 1746) when Copenhagen Castle was demolished and Christiansborg Palace was built on its site. The Danish royal family moved to Christiansborg Palace where the public did not have access.\n\nInstead, at midnight, trumpets sounded the New Year from in the Christiansborg Palace courtyard. The Danish royal family and the court wished each other a Happy New Year and exchanged New Year’s gifts. New Year’s music was played indoors at midnight, performed by the Royal Life Guards Music Band, which also performs at today’s New Year’s banquets and levees. In-person New Year’s Day greetings were limited to certain people and groups.\n\nAfter King Christian V established the Order of Dannebrog in 1671 and the Order of the Elephant in 1693, the knights of the orders and the Danish royal family had a banquet on New Year’s Eve. The first knights of the orders were the king’s court knights and closest advisers who were the government officials of the time. When the Folketing, the People’s Assembly or the Danish Parliament, was established in 1849, the government ministers and leaders of Folketing took their places at the New Year’s banquet tables.\n\nWhen the New Year’s banquet was no longer exclusively for knights, invitations were extended to the royal ladies, those who managed the royal court, the Royal Life Guards who protected the king, the military who protected the country, and the police who protected the citizens. Leaders of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Denmark, the Danish Supreme Court, and the University of Copenhagen also received invitations. Today, leaders of these institutions are also on the guest list for the modern New Year’s Banquet.\n\nToday’s Banquet and Levees\n\nToday, the banquet and levees are held over three days in early January.

Since the death of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom on September 8, 2022, Queen Margrethe II had been Europe’s longest-reigning monarch, the world’s only Queen Regnant, and the longest-serving incumbent female head of state. After her abdication, Margrethe held the style and title Her Majesty Queen Margrethe.\n\nQueen Margrethe II had previously said she would never abdicate the throne. In 2012, as she celebrated forty years on the Danish throne, Queen Margrethe II said, “I will remain on the throne until I fall off.” It is thought that no one was aware of Queen Margrethe II’s plan to abdicate with the exception of a few unnamed people, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen (the second woman to be Prime Minister of Denmark and the youngest prime minister in Danish history), and Queen Margrethe’s first cousin King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden (Margrethe’s mother Princess Ingrid of Sweden and Carl Gustaf’s father Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden were siblings, the children of King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden and Princess Margaret of Connaught (who died before her husband became king).\n\nUpon her abdication, Queen Margrethe II’s elder son fifty-five year old Crown Prince Frederik became His Majesty King Frederik X of Denmark and his Australian-born wife Crown Princess Mary became Her Majesty Queen Mary of Denmark.\n\nAlready styled as His Royal Highness, Frederik and Mary’s elder son eighteen year old Prince Christian (born 2005) became His Royal Highness Crown Prince Christian of Denmark, the heir to the Danish throne.\n\nQueen Margrethe II announces that she will abdicate during her New Year’s Speech\n\nIn her New Year’s Speech, Queen Margrethe II stated:\n\nIn two weeks time I have been Queen of Denmark for 52 years. Such an amount will leave its mark on anybody – also on me! The time takes its toll, and the number of “ailments” increases. One cannot undertake as much as one managed in the past.\n\nIn February this year I underwent extensive back surgery. Everything went well, thanks to the competent health personnel, who took care of me. Inevitably, the operation gave cause to thoughts about the future – whether now would be an appropriate time to pass on the responsibility to the next generation.\n\nI have decided that now is the right time. On 14th January 2024 – 52 years after I succeeded my beloved father – I will step down as Queen of Denmark. I will hand over the throne to my son Crown Prince Frederik.\n\nThe last Danish monarch to abdicate was King Erik III in 1146. The reasons for Erik III’s abdication are unclear. His abdication has been explained as his realization of his inability to govern or an illness that ultimately killed him. After abdicating, Erik III entered St. Canute’s Abbey in Odense, Denmark, where he died on August 27, 1146, soon after his abdication, and was buried at St. Canute’s Abbey.\n\n********************\n\nAbdications in the 21st Century\n\nBefore the abdication of Queen Margrethe II, in the 21st century, there were nine voluntary abdications. Except for one abdication due to illness, the abdications occurred to pass the throne to the heir sooner. In Luxembourg and the Netherlands, there is a history of such abdications. In Luxembourg, although Grand Duchess Marie-Adélaïde abdicated in 1919 in favor of her sister Charlotte due to political reasons, Grand Duchess Charlotte abdicated in favor of her son Jean and Grand Duke Jean abdicated in favor of his son Henri. In the Netherlands, the last three monarchs, all Queens – Wilhelmina, Juliana, and Beatrix – abdicated in favor of their heirs. With people living longer, it may be likely that we will see more monarchs abdicating to pass their thrones to their heirs sooner.\n\nOctober 7, 2000 – Grand Duke Jean of Luxembourg abdicated in favor of his son Henri.\n\nOctober 7, 2004 – King Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia abdicated in favor of his son Norodom Sihamoni.\n\nJanuary 4, 2005 – Emir Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salim Al-Sabah of Kuwait abdicated due to illness. The Kuwaiti Cabinet nominated Prime Minister Sabah bin Ahmad Al-Sabah to become the next Emir.\n\nDecember 9, 2006 – King Jigme Singye Wangchuck of Bhutan abdicated in favor of his son Jigme Khesar Namgyal Wangchuck.\n\nApril 30, 2013 – Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands abdicated in favor of her son Willem-Alexander.\n\nJune 25, 2013 – Emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani of Qatar abdicated in favor of his son Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.\n\nJuly 21, 2013 – Albert II, King of the Belgians abdicated in favor of his son Philippe.\n\nJune 19, 2014 – King Juan Carlos I of Spain abdicated in favor of his Felipe VI.\n\nApril 30, 2019 – Emperor Akihito of Japan abdicated in favor of his son Naruhito.\n\n********************\n\nEvents on Sunday, January 14, 2024\n\nThe succession of King Frederik X took place during a meeting of the Council of State in the State Council Hall at Christiansborg Palace, the seat of the Danish Parliament, in Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, at the moment Queen Margrethe II signed the declaration of her abdication. Denmark does not have a coronation. Denmark formerly had a coronation but in 1660, the coronation was replaced with a ceremony of anointing. The new monarch would arrive at the coronation site already wearing the crown and was then anointed.\n\nQueen Margrethe II and her husband Prince Henrik, Prince Consort of Denmark wave from the balcony at Christiansborg Palace on January 15, 1972 after the proclamation of her succession to the Danish throne. The couple’s two young sons Frederik and Joachim can be seen.\n\nThe ceremony of anointing was abolished with the introduction of the Danish Constitution in 1849, and a simple proclamation has been used since then. Denmark does have regalia but it plays no role in the ceremonies for a new monarch. Now, a public announcement of a new monarch’s accession is made from the balcony of Christiansborg Palace. The new king or queen is presented and proclaimed by the Prime Minister, followed by a ninefold “hurrah” by the crowds below.\n\nAmalienborg in Copenhagen, Denmark is the official residence of the Danish royal family. It consists of four identical classical palaces around an octagonal square. Frederik VIII’s Palace is the northeastern palace and has been the home of King Frederik X and Queen Mary since their marriage in 2004. Christian IX’s Palace is the southeastern palace and has been the home of Queen Margrethe II since 1967. Both King Frederik X and his family and Queen Margrethe II will remain at their respective homes.\n\nBelow is the program for the abdication of Queen Margrethe II and the accession of King Frederik X. The times listed are Danish times.\n\nCrown Prince Prince Frederik, Crown Princess Mary & Prince Christian traveled to Christiansborg Palace\n\n13:35 – Crown Prince Frederik, Crown Princess Mary, and their elder son Prince Christian left their home Frederik VIII’s Palace, Amalienborg in Copenhagen, and traveled by car to Christiansborg Palace, the seat of the Danish Parliament in Copenhagen.\n\nQueen Margrethe traveled to Christiansborg Palace to abdicate\n\n13:37 – Queen Margrethe II left her home Christian IX’s Palace, Amalienborg in Copenhagen, and traveled by carriage to Christiansborg Palace escorted by the Guard Hussar Regiment.\n\n14:00 – Queen Margrethe II, Crown Prince Frederik, and Prince Christian met with the Council of State in the State Council Hall at Christiansborg Palace. The succession of the Danish throne took place during the Council of State meeting at the moment when Queen Margrethe II signed a declaration of her abdication. Queen Margrethe then gave up her seat and offered it to the new King. At the same time, the new heir to the throne, Crown Prince Christian, took the seat to the right of the King. After this, the visibly-moved Queen Margrethe said “Gud bevare kongen” (God save the king) and left the State Council Hall.\n\nQueen Margrethe, after her abdication, on her way to her home Christian IX’s Palace\n\n14:15 – Queen Margrethe left Christiansborg Palace and traveled by car to her home Christian IX’s Palace, Amalienborg.\n\n14:30 – King Frederik X and Queen Mary held a reception for invited people at Christiansborg Palace.\n\nPrime Minister Mette Frederiksen proclaimed King Frederik X’s accession to the throne\n\n15:00 – King Frederik X stepped out on the balcony of Christiansborg Palace and Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen proclaimed King Frederik X’s accession to the throne. According to Danish state custom, the Prime Minister proclaimed three times: “Her Majesty Queen Margrethe II has abdicated. Long live His Majesty King Frederik X!” This was followed by the traditional ninefold cheer from the crowd of tens of thousands who turned out to witness the proclamation.\n\nKing Frederik X spoke after his proclamation as Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen stood next to him\n\n15:00 – King Frederik X gave a short speech,”My mother, Her Majesty Queen Margrethe II, has ruled Denmark for 52 years. For half a century, she has followed the times with our common heritage as a starting point. She will always be remembered as a Monarch beyond the ordinary. Like few, my mother has managed to be at one with her kingdom. Today, the throne passes on. My hope is to become an unifying king of tomorrow. It’s a task I’ve been waiting for all my life. It is a responsibility I take on with respect, pride and great joy. It is a deed I will take pains to carry out and carry through the position I have been entrusted with. I need all the support I can get. From my beloved wife, from my family, from you and from that which is greater than us. I face the future knowing that I am not alone.”\n\nKing Frederik X announced his motto, “Bound, committed, for the Kingdom of Denmark.”\n\nLeft to right: Princess Isabella, Crown Prince Christian, King Frederik X, Queen Mary, Princess Josephine, and Prince Vincent\n\nAfter his speech, King Frederik X was joined on the balcony by his family: Queen Mary, Crown Prince Christian, Princess Isabella, and twins Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine.\n\n15:10 – After the proclamation, an honorary cannon salute was fired from the Sixtus Battery at Holmen Naval Base in Copenhagen.\n\nThe royal standard was raised over King Frederik X’s home Frederik VIII’s Palace, Amalienborg\n\n15:10 – After the proclamation, the royal standard was lowered at Queen Margrethe’s home Christian IX’s Palace and then raised at King Frederik X’s home Frederik VIII’s Palace, Amalienborg.\n\nKing Frederik X and Queen Mary rode in a carriage to their home Frederik VIII’s Palace\n\n15:30 – After the proclamation, King Frederik X and Queen Mary rode in a carriage, escorted by the Guard Hussar Regiment’s mounted squadron, from Christiansborg Palace to their home Frederik VIII’s Palace, Amalienborg.\n\n17:00 – The royal colors were transferred from Queen Margrethe’s home Christian IX’s Palace to Frederik VIII’s Palace, King Frederik X’s home.\n\nRead news articles from January 14, 2024 regarding the abdication and accession at the link below.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Royal News Recap for Sunday, January 14, 2024 – Abdication of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark and Accession of King Frederik X of Denmark\n\n********************\n\nEvent on Monday, January 15, 2024\n\nThe Danish Parliament acknowledges the Danish Royal Family, seated above the clock\n\n10:00 – King Frederik, Queen Mary, Crown Prince Christian, Queen Margrethe, Prince Joachim (Queen Margrethe’s younger son) and Princess Benedikte (Queen Margrethe’s sister) participated in the Danish Parliament’s celebration of the succession of the throne.

She is the second longest-reigning Danish monarch after King Christian IV who reigned for 59 years, 330 days, from April 4, 1588 until February 28, 1648. As of January 14, 2022, the only current monarchs who reigned longer than Queen Margrethe II were Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom (reigned since February 6, 1952) and Hassanal Bolkiah, Sultan of Brunei (reigned since October 5, 1967). Queen Margrethe II stated several times that she had no intention of abdicating as several other European monarchs had done. She viewed her position as a job for life and recognized Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom as a source of inspiration for her devotion to duty.\n\nIn January 1972, shortly after King Frederik IX of Denmark had given his New Year speech, he became ill with flu-like symptoms. On January 3, 1972, he had a cardiac arrest and was rushed to Copenhagen Municipal Hospital. The king improved for a time but then took a turn for the worse, and on January 14, 1972, King Frederik IX died at the age of 72. His eldest daughter succeeded him as Queen Margrethe II of Denmark. She became the first female monarch in Denmark since Margrethe I, Queen of Denmark (reigned 1387 – 1412), Norway (reigned 1388 – 1412), and Sweden (reigned 1389 – 1412).\n\nMargrethe and her family in 1956: left to right Princess Benedikte, Princess Anne-Marie, Queen Ingrid, Princess Margrethe, and King Frederik IX\n\nIn 1947, King Frederik IX succeeded to the Danish throne upon the death of his father King Christian X. At that time, women were excluded from the line of succession. Having only three daughters, and unlikely that there would be more children, King Frederik IX’s heir presumptive was his younger brother Prince Knud. Frederik soon began to work toward changing the succession laws in Denmark. Finally, in 1953, a new Act of Succession was passed, changing the succession to male-preference cognatic primogeniture – meaning that sons would come before daughters. (A 2009 succession law now allows for the succession of the firstborn child regardless of gender.) The 1953 Act of Succession meant that in the absence of a son, King Frederik IX’s daughters could succeed to the throne, and Frederik’s eldest daughter Margrethe became the heiress-presumptive. Her uncle Prince Knud, who had held the title of Hereditary Prince of Denmark, was not very happy with the new laws, as he and his two sons were now pushed further down the line. In somewhat of a consolation, Knud was given the title Hereditary Prince Knud even though he was no longer the direct heir to the throne. However, Margrethe, as heiress-presumptive, was never given the title of Crown Princess.\n\nOn January 15, 1972, in keeping with tradition, Margrethe was formally proclaimed Queen of Denmark by Prime Minister Jens Otto Krag from the balcony at Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen. To the crowds gathered below, she gave a brief speech: “My beloved father, our King, is dead. The task that my father had carried for nearly 25 years is now resting on my shoulders. I pray to God to give me help and strength to carry the heavy heritage. May the trust that was given to my father also be granted to me.” After being joined briefly on the balcony by her husband Prince Henrik, the couple traveled back to Amalienborg where they again appeared on the balcony, this time with their two young sons, three-and-a-half-year-old Crown Prince Frederik and two-and-a-half-year-old Prince Joachim.\n\nQueen Margrethe II with her husband Prince Henrik and their sons Crown Prince Frederik and Prince Joachim on the balcony at Amalienborg on January 15, 1972\n\n*********************\n\nThe first official photograph of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, 1972\n\nDue to COVID-19, a number of the events that had been scheduled in mid-January 2022 to mark the 50th anniversary were rescheduled for September 2022. These include a celebration at the Copenhagen City Hall, a command performance at the Royal Danish Theatre’s Old Stage, a celebratory church service in Copenhagen Cathedral, and a gala banquet at Christiansborg Palace.\n\nQueen Margrethe’s youngest sister Queen Anne-Marie of Greece was unable to participate in the limited number of events on January 14, 2022. Her husband former King Constantine II of Greece was ill with COVID-19 and because she had been exposed to COVID-19, Anne-Marie was not allowed to travel to Denmark.\n\nThe program for January 14, 2022 was as follows.\n\n9:30 AM – Queen Margrethe II began the day with a Council of State at Christiansborg Palace together with her son Crown Prince Frederik\n\n10:00 AM – Queen Margrethe II, her son Crown Prince Frederik and his wife Crown Princess Mary, her son Prince Joachim and his wife Princess Marie, and her sister Princess Benedikte attended the Danish Parliament’s official celebration of the anniversary of Her Majesty’s accession to the throne.\n\n12:00 PM – Queen Margrethe II, her son Crown Prince Frederik and his wife Crown Princess Mary, her son Prince Joachim and his wife Princess Marie, and her sister Princess Benedikte participate in a wreath-laying ceremony at King Frederik IX and Queen Ingrid’s grave outside Roskilde Cathedral.\n\nFor more information see:\n\nDanish Royal House: The 50-year anniversary of HM The Queen’s accession to the throne\n\nDanish Royal House: The 50th anniversary of Her Majesty The Queen’s accession to the throne (adjusted schedule)\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Queen Margrethe II of Denmark\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Wedding of Queen Margrethe II and Henri Laborde de Monpezat\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Ancestors of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark\n\nUnofficial Royalty: First Cousins of Queen Margrethe II\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

Born in Copenhagen, Denmark on September 11, 1656, she was the sixth of the eight children and fourth of the five daughters of Frederik III, King of Denmark and Norway and Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-Lüneburg. Her paternal grandparents were Christian IV, King of Denmark and Norway and Anna Katharina of Brandenburg. Her maternal grandparents were Georg, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and Anna Eleonora of Hesse-Darmstadt. Ulrika Eleonora was the sister of Christian V, King of Denmark and Prince Jørgen of Denmark, better known as Prince George, Duke of Cumberland, the husband of Queen Anne of Great Britain.\n\nUlrika Eleonora had seven siblings:\n\nChristian V, King of Denmark (1646 – 1699), married Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Kassel, had eight children\n\nAnna Sophie of Denmark (1647 – 1717), married Johann Georg III, Elector of Saxony, had two children\n\nFrederica Amalia of Denmark (1649 – 1704), married Christian Albrecht, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, had three children\n\nWilhelmina Ernestina of Denmark (1650 – 1706), married Karl II, Elector Palatine, no children\n\nFrederik of Denmark (1651 – 1652), died in infancy\n\nJørgen of Denmark (1653 – 1708), married Anne, Queen of Great Britain, Anne had 17 pregnancies with only five children being born alive. Two died on the day of their birth, two died at less than two years old within six days of each from smallpox, and one died at age 11.\n\nDorothea of Denmark (1657 – 1658), died in infancy\n\nIn 1675, Ulrika Eleonora became betrothed to Karl XI, King of Sweden. Ulrika Eleonora’s brother King Christian V was not in favor of the match but he left the final decision up to his mother who favored the match because her daughter would be a queen. However, the Scanian War between Denmark and Sweden from 1675 – 1679 postponed the wedding. King Christian V broke off the engagement but his sister still considered herself betrothed to Karl XI. In the peace negotiations between Sweden and Denmark in 1679, a marriage between Ulrika Eleonora and Karl XI, King of Sweden was on the agenda, and a marriage was agreed upon. Ulrika Eleonora and Karl XI were married on May 6, 1680, in Skottorp Castle in Skummeslöv, Halland, Sweden. The new Queen of Sweden was crowned on November 25, 1680, at Storkyrkan (Great Church) in Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nUlrika Eleonora and Karl XI had seven children but only three survived childhood:\n\nHedwig Sophia of Sweden (1681 – 1708), married her first cousin Friedrich IV, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, had one son, paternal grandparents of Peter III, Emperor of All Russia\n\nKarl XII, King of Sweden (1682 – 1718), unmarried\n\nGustav of Sweden (1683 – 1685), died in early childhood\n\nUlric of Sweden (1684 – 1685), died in infancy\n\nFredrik of Sweden (born and died 1685), died in infancy\n\nKarl Gustav of Sweden (1686 – 1687), died in infancy\n\nUlrika Eleonora, Queen of Sweden (1688 – 1741), married Friedrich of Hesse-Kassel, later Fredrik I, King of Sweden and Friedrich V, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, no children Ulrika Eleonora succeeded her childless brother and two years later abdicated the Swedish throne in favor of her husband\n\nUlrika Eleonora’s husband had become King of Sweden when he was only four years old. His mother Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp, who was Dowager Queen for 55 years and would survive both her son and her daughter-in-law, was the Regent of Sweden until Karl XI reached his majority. Ulrika Eleonora had no political influence as her husband preferred to discuss politics with his mother. Hedwig Eleonora remained the first lady of the court. Karl XI always referred to Ulrika Eleonora as “My Wife” and his mother as “The Queen”. Foreign ambassadors always paid their respects to Hedwig Eleonora first, and then to Ulrika Eleonora. The hostility between Hedwig Eleonora’s homeland Holstein-Gottorp and Ulrika Eleonora’s homeland Denmark made the relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law even more tense.\n\nUlrika Eleonora was very active in charity. She founded a large number of charitable institutions that were administered by her chamberlain Sophia Amalia Marschalk and her principal lady-in-waiting and mistress of the robes Maria Elisabeth Stenbock. It is estimated that 7/8 of Ulrika Eleonora’s income went to her charities and she even sold her possessions to finance her charitable projects. Her best-known projects were a tapestry school at Karlberg Palace where orphan girls were educated in tapestry manufacturing, the Queen’s House, a home for poor widows in Stockholm, and a poor house at Kungsholmen. Ulrika Eleonora arranged for food to be distributed to areas suffering from failed crops and starvation and paid the medical bills for a large number of people in Stockholm. She commissioned doctors and midwives to develop scientific-based obstetrics and an orderly birth system in Sweden. Ulrika Eleonora supported a large number of needy people with regular allowances from her income. In 1693, the year of her death, 17,000 people were supported by her.\n\nAfter the birth of her seventh and last child in 1688, Ulrika Eleonora’s health continually weakened, so much so that she seldom participated in court events. A trip to see her family in Denmark in 1688 had to be canceled. In 1690, Ulrika Eleonora developed a fatal non-diagnosed illness. Her doctors recommended a trip to the hot springs and funds were set aside for the trip but Ulrika Eleonora refused to go and instead used the funds for charity.\n\nUlrika Eleonora died at Karlberg Palace in Solna Municipality, Sweden, outside Stockholm, on July 26, 1693, aged 36, after having spent 1692 -1693 in bed. Her husband Karl XI mourned her greatly and remarked upon her death, “Here I leave half of my heart.” She had requested a simple funeral and that her husband give most of the funds set aside for her funeral to charity. Karl XI did not respect her wish for a simple funeral but he did contribute the cost of her funeral to the poor. Ulrika Eleonora was buried at Riddarholmen Church in Stockholm, Sweden. Karl XI survived his wife by less than four years, dying on April 5, 1697, at Tre Kronor Castle in Stockholm, Sweden, aged 41. He had suffered from abdominal pains for three years. An autopsy revealed that he had developed cancer that had spread throughout the abdominal cavity. Karl was buried with his wife at Riddarholmen Church.\n\nThere is an eerie legend associated with the death of Ulrika Eleonora. After the death of Ulrika Eleonora, she was laid out at Karlberg Palace before her funeral. One night, a carriage arrived from Stockholm carrying Maria Elisabeth Stenbock, Ulrika Eleonora’s principal lady-in-waiting and mistress of the robes. Maria Elisabeth, who was carrying her little dog Camillo, was escorted to Ulrika Eleonora’s room by the officer in charge Captain Stormcrantz. When he thought she was taking too long, he looked through the keyhole and saw Maria Elisabeth and Ulrika Eleonora standing by the window talking to each other. Captain Stormcrantz was so shocked by the sight that he started coughing up blood. Maria Elisabeth, as well as her carriage, were gone the next moment. When the matter was investigated, it was discovered that Maria Elisabeth had been in bed, gravely ill, and had not left her home. King Karl XI gave orders that the incident was not to be mentioned again. Whatever the explanation, Captain Stormcrantz died soon after, reportedly from shock after what he thought he had witnessed, and Maria Elisabeth Stenbock died of her illness on October 9, 1693.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

It has been the main site for Danish royal burials since the 15th century and most monarchs and their consorts from the House of Oldenburg (1448 – 1863) and the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg (1863 – present) are buried there. The cathedral was also used for non-royal burials and the floor is covered with hundreds of grave markers with additional graves in the crypts.\n\nKing Harald Bluetooth named Roskilde the capital of Denmark in 960 and a small wooden church dedicated to the Holy Trinity was built on the location of the current cathedral. The first stone cathedral, in the Romanesque style, was completed in 1080 and a monastery was completed soon afterward.\n\nIn 1200, an expansion of the cathedral began and was completed in 1280, resulting in the Brick Gothic cathedral we see today The magnificent red brick building consists of about 2.5 million bricks and is twice as high as the old cathedral. A fire in 1443 damaged the cathedral, requiring renovations. During the Protestant Reformation, in 1538, Roskilde Cathedral ceased being a place of Catholic worship and became a house of Protestant worship.\n\nRoyal Burials\n\nTo accommodate the many royal burials, chapels were added to the 13th century Brick Gothic cathedral, each built in the architectural style of its time. There are also burials of other members of the Danish royal family in the crypts. The years below are birth and death years.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Danish Royal Burial Sites: House of Oldenburg, 1448 – 1863\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Danish Royal Burial Sites: House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, 1863 – present\n\nHoly Trinity Church\n\nHarald Bluetooth, King of Denmark and Norway (died circa 985 – 986)\n\nSweyn Forkbeard‎, King of Denmark, Norway, and England (963 – 1014)\n\nHarald Bluetooth, who introduced Christianity to Denmark, was buried at the Holy Trinity Church, the wooden first church on the site. His son Sweyn Forkbeard was first buried in England and his remains were later moved to Denmark where they were interred near his father at the Holy Trinity Church. However, their tombs have never been found.\n\nPier in the Apse\n\nSweyn II Estridsen, King of Denmark (1019 – 1076\n\nSweyn II Ertridsen was interred in the southeastern pier. A pier is similar to a column and is designed to support arches. In the photo below, a portrait of Sweyn II Ertridsen on the right marks the pier where he is buried.\n\nChoir\n\nMargrethe I, Queen of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden (1353 – 1412)\n\nQueen Margrethe I was interred in a sarcophagus behind the high altar. Her beautiful sarcophagus was made by German sculptor Johannes Junge (link in German) in 1423. She had left property to the Roskilde Cathedral on the condition that Masses for her soul would be said regularly in the future. This was discontinued in 1536 during the Protestant Reformation although a special bell is still rung twice daily in memory of Queen Margrethe I.\n\n********************\n\nTombs in the Apse\n\nThe apse is the end of a cathedral opposite the main entrance. It is often circular as it is at Roskilde Cathedral. The sarcophagi here are all grand white marble structures except for King Christopher III’s who lived more than two hundred years earlier and has a tomb with an effigy.\n\nChristopher III of Bavaria, King of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway (1416 – 1448)\n\nChristian V, King of Denmark and Norway (1646 – 1699\n\nCharlotte Amalie of Hesse-Kassel, wife of Christian V (1650 – 1714)\n\nFrederik IV, King of Denmark and Norway (1671 – 1730)\n\nLouise of Mecklenburg-Güstrow, first wife of Frederik IV (1667 – 1721)\n\n********************\n\nTrolle Chapel\n\nAnna Sophie von Reventlow, mistress, bigamous wife, and then 2nd legal wife of Frederik IV (1693 – 1743)\n\nAnna Sophie was hated by Frederik IV’s children from his first marriage to Louise of Mecklenburg-Güstrow. Upon Frederik IV’s death, his son and successor King Christian VI banished Anne Sophie from the court and kept her under house arrest at Clausholm Castle, her family home. When Anna Sophie died, King Christian VI allowed her to be buried at Roskilde Cathedral, but in the Trolle Chapel, originally built for members of the Trolle noble family, which is on the opposite side of the cathedral, far away from his parents’ tombs. The two smaller tombs are the tombs of two of six children (who all died in infancy) of Frederik IV and Anna Sophie.\n\n********************\n\nChapel of the Magi (Christian I’s Chapel)\n\nChristian I, King of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden (1426 – 1481)\n\nDorothea of Brandenburg, wife of Christian I (1431 – 1495)\n\nChristian III, King of Denmark and Norway (1503 – 1559)\n\nDorothea of Saxe-Lauenburg, wife of Christian III (1511 – 1571)\n\nFrederik II, King of Denmark and Norway (1534 – 1588)\n\nSophie of Mecklenburg-Güstrow, wife of Frederik II (1557 – 1631)\n\nKing Christian I, the first monarch of the House of Oldenburg, built the Chapel of the Magi as a family burial chapel for the House of Oldenburg. While the elaborate tombs of King Christian III, King Frederik II, and their consorts are in the Chapel of the Magi, the graves of King Christian I and Queen Dorothea are marked with simple stones because the chapel itself was to be considered their memorial monument.\n\n********************\n\nChristian IV’s Chapel\n\nChristian IV, King of Denmark and Norway (1577 – 1648)\n\nAnna Katharina of Brandenburg, first wife of Christian IV (1575 – 1612)\n\nChristian, Prince Elect of Denmark, Crown Prince of Norway, son of Christian IV ( 1603 – 1647)\n\nFrederik III, King of Denmark and Norway (1609 – 1670)\n\nSophie Amalie of Brunswick-Lüneburg, wife of Frederik III (1628 – 1685)\n\nIn 1613, a year after the death of his first wife Anna Katharina, Christian IV ordered the construction of a new burial chapel because the space inside Roskilde Cathedral for burials was very limited. Two older chapels were demolished to make space for the new burial chapel. The exterior of the new chapel was completed by 1641. However, when Christian IV died in 1648, the interior had not been completed and his coffin was placed in the crypt below. The interior of the chapel was not completed until 1866. Two large paintings illustrating important scenes from Christian IV’s life are on the walls and a statue of Christian IV watches over the chapel. King Christian IV’s silver-plated casket now stands in the middle of the chapel. His casket is surrounded by the caskets of his first wife Anna Katharina of Brandenburg, his eldest son and heir apparent Christian who predeceased him, his second son who succeeded him as King Frederik III, and Frederik III’s wife Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-Lüneberg.\n\n********************\n\nFrederik V’s Chapel\n\nChristian VI, King of Denmark and Norway (1699 – 1746)\n\nSophia Magdalena of Brandenburg-Kulmbach, wife of Christian VI (1700 – 1770)\n\nFrederik V, King of Denmark and Norway (1723 – 1766)\n\nLouisa of Great Britain, first wife of Frederik V (1724 – 1751)\n\nJuliana Maria of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, second wife of Frederik V (1729 – 1796)\n\nChristian VII, King of Denmark and Norway (1749 – 1808)\n\nFrederik VI, King of Denmark and Norway (1768 – 1839)\n\nMarie of Hesse-Kassel, wife of Frederik VI (1767 – 1852)\n\nChristian VIII, King of Denmark (1786 – 1848)\n\nCaroline Amalie of Schleswig-Holstein, second wife of Christia VIII (1796 – 1881)\n\nFrederik VII, King of Denmark (1808 – 1863)\n\nFrederik V’s Chapel consists of two chapels in the neoclassical style, constructed 1774–1825 and required the removal of a previous existing chapel. One chapel has two adjoining rooms and is referred to as Christian VI’s Chapel. The other, Frederik’s V Chapel, is a domed chapel in the shape of a cross. The interiors have the classic white-washed wall. The chapels show a gradual trend in moving from grand marble sarcophagi to more simple velvet-covered coffins, and in the case of Frederik VII, a wooden coffin. An example of a marble sarcophagus and examples of velvet-covered coffins can be seen in the photo below.\n\n********************\n\nChristian IX’s Chapel\n\nChristian IX, King of Denmark (1818 – 1906)\n\nLouise of Hesse-Kassel, wife of Christian IX (1817 – 1898)\n\nFrederik VIII, King of Denmark (1843 – 1912)\n\nLouise of Sweden, wife of Frederik VIII (1851 – 1926)\n\nChristian X, King of Denmark (1870 – 1947)\n\nAlexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, wife of Christian X (1879 – 1952)\n\nThe tombs of the first three kings and queen consorts of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg are in the rather small Christian IX’s Chapel also known as the Glücksburg Chapel. When Christian IX died, a competition was held for a design of a double sarcophagus for him and his wife Queen Louise who had predeceased him. The winning design was later determined to be too controversial. Instead, the sarcophagus was designed by Edvard Eriksen, who created the famous Little Mermaid statue in the Copenhagen harbor, and architect Hack Kampmann. They created a large sarcophagus in white marble surrounded by three graceful sculptures depicting Remembrance, Love, and Sorrow.\n\n********************\n\nMaria Feodorovna’s Temporary Burial Site\n\nMaria Feodorovna, Empress of All Russia, born Prince Dagmar of Denmark (1847 – 1928)\n\nEmpress Maria Feodorovna of Russian, the wife of Alexander III, Emperor of All Russia and mother of Nicholas II, Emperor of All Russia, was born Princess Dagmar of Denmark, the daughter of Christian IX, King of Denmark. After escaping from Russia after the Russian Revolution, she lived the rest of her life in Denmark. Upon her death in 1928, she was buried at Roskilde Cathedral. She had wished that at some point in time she could be buried with her husband. In 2005, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed, along with their governments, that her wish should be fulfilled. Her remains were transported to St. Petersburg and interred next to her husband in the Peter and Paul Cathedral on September 28, 2006.\n\n********************\n\nFrederik IX’s Burial Site\n\nFrederick IX, King of Denmark (1899 – 1972)\n\nIngrid of Sweden, wife of Frederik IX (1910 – 2000)\n\nKing Frederik IX had a career in the Royal Danish Navy where he had several senior commands and attained the rank of Rear Admiral. Unlike other Danish monarchs who had been buried inside Roskilde Cathedral, Frederik wanted to be buried outside the cathedral in sight of the sea. The two photos below of the burial site right outside of Roskilde Catherdral were taken by this author who can verify that the Roskilde Fjord can be seen from the site of the grave.\n\n********************\n\nSt. Brigid’s Chapel – Margrethe II’s Future Burial Site\n\nMargrethe II, Queen of Denmark (born 1940)\n\nIn 2010, it was announced that Queen Margrethe II had chosen St. Brigid’s Chapel at Roskilde Cathedral as the burial site for herself and her husband Prince Henrik. St. Bridgid’s Chapel, built in 1485, is one of the two remaining old chapels. However, the Danish Royal Court announced on August 3, 2017, that Prince Henrik did not want to be buried in Roskilde Cathedral. Following his funeral in 2018, Prince Henrik’s remains were cremated with half of his ashes spread over Danish waters, and the other half interred in the private garden at Fredensborg Castle.\n\nDanish artist Bjørn Nørgaard designed the sarcophagus. The photos below are from this author’s visit to Roskilde Cathedral in August 2011 where she was able to see a conservator restoring the 500-year-old murals on the chapel’s walls and a display about Queen Margrethe II’s tomb. Since this author’s visit, the sarcophagus has been finished and installed but is covered until the death of Queen Margrethe II.\n\n********************\n\nOther Royal Burials\n\nThe following are also buried in Roskilde Cathedral, mostly in the crypts.\n\nPrince Christopher of Denmark, Duke of Lolland, son of Valdemar IV (1341 – 1363)\n\nPrince Magnus of Denmark, Duke of Holstein, son of Christian III‎ (1540 – 1583)\n\nPrince Ulrik of Denmark, son of Frederik II (1578 – 1624)‎\n\nPrince Hans of Denmark, son of Frederik II (1583 – 1602)‎\n\nPrince Ulrik of Denmark, son of Christian IV (1611 – 1633)‎\n\nPrincess Magdalena Sibylle of Saxony, wife of Christian, Prince Elect of Denmark, Crown Prince of Norway, son of Christian IV (1617 – 1668)\n\nPrince Christian of Denmark, son of Christian V (1675 – 1695)\n\nPrincess Sophie Hedwig of Denmark, daughter of Christian V‎ (1677 – 1735)\n\nPrince Vilhelm of Denmark, son of Christian V (1687 – 1705)\n\nPrince Carl of Denmark, son of Christian V‎ (1680 – 1729)\n\nPrincess Charlotte Amalie of Denmark, daughter of Frederik IV‎ (1706 – 1782)\n\nFrederik, Hereditary Prince of Denmark and Norway‎, son of Frederik V (1753 – 1805)\n\nSophie Friederike of Mecklenburg, wife of Frederik, Hereditary Prince of Denmark‎, son of Frederik V 1758 – 1794\n\nPrincess Juliane of Denmark, daughter of ‎Frederik, Hereditary Prince of Denmark and Norway (1788 – 1850)\n\nPrincess Louise Charlotte of Denmark, daughter of ‎ Frederik, Hereditary Prince of Denmark and Norway (1789 – 1864)\n\nFerdinand, Hereditary Prince of Denmark, son of ‎Frederik, Hereditary Prince of Denmark (1792 – 1863)\n\nPrincess Caroline of Denmark, daughter of Frederick VI ‎(1793 – 1881)\n\nPrince Wilhelm of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg‎ (1816 – 1893), brother of Christian IX\n\nPrince Johann von Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, brother of Christian IX‎ (1825 – 1911)\n\nPrince Valdemar of Denmark, son of Christian IX‎ (1858 – 1939)\n\nPrincess Marie of Orléans, wife of Prince Valdemar (1865 – 1909)‎\n\nPrince Harald of Denmark, son of Frederik VIII‎ (1876 – 1949)\n\nPrincess Thyra of Denmark, daughter of Frederik VIII (1880 – 1945)‎\n\nPrince Gustav of Denmark, son of Frederik VIII‎ (1887 – 1944)\n\nPrince Erik, Count of Rosenborg, son of Prince Valdemar, grandson of Christian IX‎ (1890–1950)\n\nPrince Viggo, Count of Rosenborg, son of Prince Valdemar, grandson of Christian IX‎ (1893 – 1970)\n\nEleanor Margaret Green, Princess Viggo, Countess of Rosenborg, wife of Prince Viggo (1895 – 1966)\n\nPrincess Margaret of Denmark, daughter of Prince Valdemar, granddaughter of Christian IX‎ (1895 – 1992)\n\nHereditary Prince Knud of Denmark‎, son of Christian X (1900 – 1976)\n\nPrincess Caroline-Mathilde of Denmark, daughter of Prince Harald, granddaughter of Frederik VIII,‎ wife of Knud, Hereditary Prince of Denmark (1912 – 1995)\n\nPrince Gorm of Denmark‎, son of Prince Harald of Denmark, grandson of Frederik VIII) (1919 – 1991)\n\nCount Christian of Rosenborg, son of Prince Erik, Count of Rosenborg, grandson of Prince Valdemar (1932 – 1997)\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

The church has long had a connection to ships and the Danish navy and is located on the water. In medieval Copenhagen, Holmen was an island but in the 16th century, city restructuring made it a peninsula surrounded by Holmens Canal. On this peninsula, King Christian III founded a shipyard that became synonymous with the name Holmen. In 1617, King Christian IV built houses for the shipyard workers. This increased the population of the area and it was necessary to build a larger church which was constructed in a building that had been used as a forge for anchors. This church required only interior work and no major redesign of the basic structure of the building and was consecrated on September 5, 1619.\n\nThe church quickly became too small, and in 1641 it was decided to expand the church. Architect Leonhard Blasius was the builder of the second church, but it was King Christian IV who determined the design of the church which was modeled after the Glücksburg Castle Church. The major Copenhagen fires of 1728 and 1795 did not affect Holmens Church, and the bombardments in 1659 and 1807 only caused minor damage to the church.\n\nToday’s church is much the same as the second church built by King Christian IV. Holmens Church still has the original whitewashed walls, the barrel-vaulted ceiling with stucco decoration, and the large oak altarpiece and the oak pulpit made by sculptor Abel Schrøder the Younger. The only major addition was the chapel hall begun in 1705 under the direction of Danish architect Johann Conrad Ernst where the tombs of famous Danish naval personnel rest.\n\nThere are no royal burials at Holmens Church except for two possibilities. The crypt under the chapel hall has an inscription that tells of two small corpses transferred from the chapel of a royal castle. It is assumed that these are two of the six children of King Frederik IV and Anna Sophie Reventlow, his mistress, bigamous wife, and 2nd legal wife. Three of their children were born before the legal marriage in 1721 but none survived infancy. The three children born after the 1721 marriage were styled as Prince/Princess of Denmark and Norway but none of them survived infancy either. The deaths of all six children of Frederik IV and Anna Sophie were seen by many as divine punishment for their bigamous marriage.\n\nKing Frederik IX had a career in the Royal Danish Navy and had a great love for the sea. Perhaps that was the reason his three children were christened at Holmens Church. His eldest daughter and successor Queen Margrethe II was also married there and her son King Frederik X and his twin son and daughter Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine were christened at Holmens Church.\n\nRoyal Events at Holmens Church\n\nChristening of the future King Frederik X.
