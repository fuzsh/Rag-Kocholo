        "text": "Matilda of Holstein or Mechthild (1220 or 1225 – 1288 in Kiel) was a Danish queen consort, married to King Abel of Denmark and then to Birger Jarl, Regent of Sweden.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n\n2 Issue\n\n3 Ancestry\n\n4 References\n\nBiography\n\nMatilda was the child of Adolf IV, Count of Holstein, and Hedwig of Lippe. In 25 April 1237 she was married to Abel of Denmark in Schleswig. When Abel became king in 1250, she was crowned with him in Roskilde on 1 November.\n\nWhen Abel died in 1252, she was forced to leave Denmark and enter a convent. She managed to get her son Valdemar released from the captivity of the archbishop of Cologne and fought for the inheritance of her children in the Duchy of Schleswig. In 1260, she pawned the areas Eider and Schlei in southern Denmark to her brothers. She made a pact with Jacob Erlandsen, archbishop of Lund, and then broke her vows of the convent by marrying the Swedish regent Birger Jarl in 1261. After the death of Birger in 1266, she moved to Kiel.\n\nIn 1288, shortly before her death, she gave up Eider and Schlei to her brothers. She was unpopular in Denmark, where she was called the daughter of the Devil and accused of destroying letters from the Pope and emperor to King Valdemar II.\n\nIssue\n\nQueen Matilda bore her first husband three sons and a daughter:\n\nValdemar III (1238–1257); Duke of Schleswig 1254–1257\n\nSophie (born 1240, date of death unknown)\n\nEric I (c. 1241 – 27 May 1272); Duke of Schleswig 1260–1272\n\nAbel (1252–1279)\n\nAncestry\n\nReferences\n\nDansk Biografisk Lexikon, volume 11, pp. 205–206, Copenhagen 1897\n\nAnnales Stadenses 1237–1241, MGH SS XVI, sida 363–367\n\nMatilda of Holstein\n\nHouse of Schaumburg\n\nBorn: 1220s Died: 1288 Danish royalty Preceded by\n\nJutta of Saxony Queen consort of Denmark\n\n1250–1252 Succeeded by\n\nMargaret Sambiria"
