They settled in Arcadia where Henry learned the grocery trade. They then moved to Manilla where he worked in the same capacity for several years.\n\nIn 1920, they became residents of Manning where Henry and his brother, Leo, opened a general store located between Frahm's tavern and Ohde's Furniture Store on Main Street. Business flourished until the depression years when hundreds of unpaid grocery bills forced Henry to abandon the store and seek employment elsewhere. He worked for the Manning Creamery Co. until their move to Omaha, Nebraska in 1943.\n\nThey had four children: Clarence, who was employed at Alcoa in California for 30 years until his death in 1970; DeNage Lowe, R.N., who served in World War II as a Navy Nurse in the Mariana Islands, and who now is a resident of San Antonio, Texas; Marie VanScoy, a secretary for The Las Vegas Young Audiences, Inc.; and Louise O'Donnell, also an R.N., who is Director of Nursing Services for the Medical Personnel Office in Omaha.\n\nDuring his years in Manning, Henry played Santa Claus for the town, as well as for many families. Each Christmas he brought joy to youngsters of all ages.\n\nMEMORIAL BASKETS\n\nDo you remember when as a child you dressed in your best on Memorial Day and went to the Hod Free Home at 105 Ann Street? There Mrs. Free had some 50 or 60 grape baskets that she had painted white. The ladies of the Relief Corps filled them with flowers. Each child was given a basket of flowers to carry in the parade. Mr. and Mrs. Free died many years ago. The Free house was torn down a few years ago and in the attic were some 50 white baskets covered with dust and filled with memories.\n\nALBERT KLOCKE\n\nBack: Larry, Karen, Joleen, Diane; front: Alvina and Albert Klocke\n\nAlbert Klocke was born in 1912 near Templeton.

Only Ted Hansen, Gord Sutherland, Tom Parkhouse, O.W. Emmons, my brother Ed, and a few others had cars in Manning at the time. You could only get 4,000 miles on a tire in those days, and gas was 8c a gallon.\n\nI drove to Minnesota one time and ran into mud. When I got to Mason City I bought another set of chains to put on the front tires, too. This was before the roads were paved.\n\n---Ed Stuhr\n\nContinued from page 344\n\nFRANK A.

Hard times were with us from the Depression, and the drought didn't help matters.\n\nWe had 200 acres of corn north of Aspinwall, which my two brothers and I picked by ourselves. The crop that year was so poor that we could work all morning and not fill the bottom of the wagon.\n\n---Amanda Koester Lamp\n\nContinued from page 346\n\nHENRY KRUSE\n\nHeinrick Kruse, Jr., was born in Germany in 1856 and came to America in 1866. He married Madyeline Lemster, also a native of Germany, in 1882. They farmed five miles northwest of Manning, where eight children were born before he died in 1898, Harry, Herman, Lena, Laura, William, Henry, Johann, and Amanda. Two of their children, William and Henry, settled around Manning.\n\nHenry married Helma Strathman, daughter of John and Christina Hagge Strathman, on February 18, 1920.

KRUSE\n\nHarm and Hermine Kruse and four children emigrated from Ostfriesland, Germany in 1871 and homesteaded 160 acres east of Westside in Crawford County. Six more children were born there in a four-room frame house built with lumber hauled from the railroad in Arcadia. There were no trees for miles and the prairie grass \"stood as high as a horse's chin.\"\n\nJohn was the youngest child, born in 1882. He graduated from Westside High School in 1899, and later studied civil engineering at Iowa State. In 1903 he took over farming the land while becoming a familiar musician by playing for dances and celebrations in the area. Music was his lifetime avocation, and in his later years he was still gathering fellow musicians for local celebrations. He was also a familiar auctioneer through the years.\n\nAfter the birth of his daughter, Ione Emma, and the death of his wife, Emma Schweke, in 1912, he remarried in 1913 to Beryl Olive of Scranton. They built a new house on the homestead in 1920, and restored the old, original homestead. Together they started the first chick hatchery in Iowa in the basement of their farm home. It grew in size until in 1930 they owned four hatcheries in the surrounding towns, and it was necessary to purchase a large brick building on Main Street in Manning to move their main operation there. A 10-room hotel was also established in the same building.\n\nJohn was active in the Manning community, and for several years was chairman of the annual Children's Day. He enjoyed working with the 4-H, and encouraging young people. He'll be remembered by many for his help in their time of need, providing a home, job or encouragement when needed. In 1941 the Kruses moved to Carroll, and leased the Manning Hatchery.\n\nJohn was the father of four children: Ione, Allen Wendell (died in infancy), Joan Olive and Wallace David. The family farm was sold in the 1940's, Beryl and Wallace (Bill) died in 1943, and Ione (Mrs. Verdis Hansen) died in 1968. One daughter, Joan, two grandchildren and four great-grandchildren survive.\n\nI CAN REMEMBER---\n\nThe programs and box socials in the country schools. The ladies would bring a tasty lunch for two, often in a crepe paper decorated shoe box. These were auctioned to the men, and lunch partners were determined in this way. The auctioneer often was my father, Emil Wiese. The evening entertainment would begin with a program by the school pupils in grades one through eight. The money from the Box Social Auction was used to purchase various supplies for the school.\n\n---Alta Hansen\n\nJim Ramsey Transfer\n\nContinued from page 347\n\nWILLIAM KRUSE\n\nHarry and Laura Kruse, daughters Willetta Sander, Florence Ramsey and Delores Brockman\n\nWilliam Kruse was born Oct. 6, 1860, in Stokendorf, Germany.

They were the parents of three daughters: Willetta Sander, Florence Ramsey, and Dolores Brockman.\n\nWilletta and her husband, William Sander, farmed the home place from 1945 to 1952. They were the parents of four daughters: Corrine Jahn, Marlys Groth, Judith Brookbank, and Susan Siefken.\n\nFlorence and her husband, William Ramsey, farmed the home place from 1952 to 1962. They have one daughter, Donna Maasen. Florence graduated from Manning High School in 1933, William in 1932, and Donna in 1966.\n\nCorrine and her husband, Wayne Jahn, farmed the home place from 1968 to 1971. The farm was sold in 1970. Corrine also graduated from Manning High School, in 1953. They have five children: Randy, Rick, Jeffrey, Brenda, and Gina, and a granddaughter, Rachel Jahn, daughter of Randy and Linda Jahn; this makes a six generation family, with the family farm owned for at least 86 years.\n\nWM. JOHN KRUSE\n\nWilliam John Kruse was born in 1892 in Crawford County. He was the son of Heinrick Kruse, Jr. and Magdeline Lemster. Heinrick was born in Stokendorf, Germany, in 1856, and came to America with his parents, Heinrick Kruse, Sr. and Helena Lamp Kruse, when he was 10. He married Magdeline Lemster in 1882. She was also a native of Germany, born in Rommels in 1863. William's father died when he was six years old. After his mother married William Hagedorn, the family moved to South Dakota.

They live on a farm near Buck Grove. Luanne married Arlan Sandvik and they live in Story City.\n\nI CAN REMEMBER---\n\nI hardly remember my mother when she wasn't wearing an apron. It was the handiest garment to chase the chickens out of the house yard or carry fluffy yellow chicks to the brooder house. Her apron made a basket to carry eggs in when choring, a flip of the apron chased the pesky flies from the screen door, and it was always handy as a pot holder. Vegetables and fruit from the garden all found their way to the kitchen via Mom's carry-all apron, and it was used countless times to wipe a perspiring brow as she bent over the hot wood stove or hoed the garden under a hot summer sun. It even served as a quick dust cloth when company was seen coming in the lane. Its uses were limitless.\n\n---Florence Genzen\n\nContinued from page 348\n\nH. E. KUHL\n\nH. E.

When the water was finally hot, the homemade lye soap was cut into the water and it was dipped into the wash machine. Dad was called to start the engine on the machine and then he would go to the field or start at his own work.

He was born in Carroll County in 1896 and spent his lifetime in the Crawford and Carroll County area. He married Elsie Kusel in 1930. They made their home in the Westside area, where Otto's work centered around agriculture. Together they raised one son, Glen Kusel. In 1952 they moved to Manning where their son had located, and have made their home here.\n\nGlen married Arlene Subbert in 1946. He worked with the hatchery business for 21 years. Eleven of those years were spent with Priebe & Son, and in 1959 he opened his own hatchery. In 1961, a partnership was formed and he operated G & R Hatchery as a co-owner until 1971. At that time, Glen began operation of Kusel Dozer Service and has been serving the community in that capacity ever since. His wife, Arlene, began operation of Kiddie Korner Day Care in Manning in 1978.\n\nGlen and Arlene have four daughters. Pamela married Alan Kusel and they have two daughters, Amy Jo and Beth Ann.

After her death, he returned to Manning in 1918 with his two children, Elsie (Mrs. Otto Schroeder) and Herman. Her August established a new family which also included his wife, Ida Grau, her daughter Eunice (Mrs. Hugo Ahrendsen), and later two sons, Amos and Melvin, completed this family.\n\nAfter his marriage to Marjorie Kuhn in 1943, Melvin began farming the Parker land one mile north of Manning and since 1948 \"Parker's corner\" has been their home. Since this farm was located adjacent to both his family home and his brother Amos' farm, it enabled the brothers to work together in farming and cattle raising, while Melvin was also engaged for 20 years in a trucking operation. The men were also partners in a custom combining service, which still continues through Melvin and Barry Kusel; Barry is the oldest son of Amos, now deceased, and his wife, Dorothy (Ehrichs).\n\nMelvin and Marge are the parents of two children.

Their daughter Karla, now Mrs. Dan Richmond of Colorado, has two sons, Rick and Phillip.\n\nI CAN REMEMBER---\n\nMy great-grandfather left Germany in 1840 and settled near Davenport. His son Detlef Wiese came to Westside by horseback in 1860 to stake out land for three of his brothers and himself. The land was recorded and Detlef rode back to Davenport to report to his family. They loaded a prairie schooner and left for the new land they had claimed. It took them three months to get here, because there were no roads or bridges, and they had to chop down trees and make rafts to cross the rivers. They settled two miles north of the Five Mile House, choosing this area because there were trees already growing there while further south there was nothing but prairie grass.\n\nDetlef's son Ed came to Manning in 1904 and settled on the farm that has been our home place all these years. They had to go to Denison to \"Chapman's Grove\" to get seedling trees and haul them home in their wagons to plant on the farm. Since there was no wood to burn, they cut waist-tall grass or gathered buffalo chips for fuel.\n\nThe sixth generation of our family is now living in this area."
