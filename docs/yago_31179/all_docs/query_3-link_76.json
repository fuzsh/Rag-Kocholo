She produced 64,130 pounds of milk and 1,891 pounds of protein, both of which rank Flipper first nationally for milk and protein in the senior-three-year-old division as well. She peaked at 242 pounds in one day.\n\nClassified Excellent-91 at 4 years 1 month of age, Flipper produced a great lactation as a two-year-old as well, with 42,870 pounds of milk, 1,730 pounds of butterfat and 1,305 pounds of protein on three times-a-day milking, calving at 2-2.\n\n“Anyone who has had a cow like Flipper knows there’s a lot of luck involved in making this kind of record,” Page said. “What’s most phenomenal about Flipper is her exceptional udder quality. I’ve never seen a cow milk this much and have such great udder quality.”\n\nFlipper is a daughter of Calbrett-I H H Champion-ET and is out of Clinita Terry Future-ET, an EX-92 Dam of Merit with a top record of 3-9, 2x, 365d, 36,420M, 795F, 973P.\n\nPage purchased Flipper in the Norman Bayless dispersal in April 2006, and less than two weeks later she was the fourth place senior two-year-old at the Southern National Holstein show.\n\nPage said one of the funniest things about Flipper’s record is that he didn’t want her to milk that much because he wanted to show her as a three-year-old at World Dairy Expo. “We tried to slow her down by just giving her hay and grain,” Page said, “but she just kept losing condition, so we put her on a TMR and away she went. If we hadn’t tried to slow her down, she probably would have set the all-time milk record too.”\n\nDerek farms with his parents, Leon and Betty. The herd is enrolled on Holstein COMPLETE and the 100-cow Holstein herd has a rolling herd average of nearly 30,000 pounds of milk.\n\nFor more information, contact Lindsey Worden, Communications Manager, at 800-952-5200, ext. 4096.\n\n^ back to top ^\n\nHolstein Foundation Names New Trustee\n\nBrattleboro, Vt.

Excitement for U.S. Registered HolsteinsSM and their owners abounded as 1,800 Holstein enthusiasts participated in the convention.\n\nIt is a sign of the times when it comes to the Holstein cow and her Association. As Holstein Association USA Chief Executive Officer John M. Meyer presented in his report, “Our year was highlighted by considerable increases in key areas that measure breed interest and the strength of a dairy breed association. In 2007, your Association registered 317,128 of your animals, a four percent increase over the previous year's total. It is interesting to note that well over three times as many Holsteins were registered in 2007 than the combined total of all other dairy breeds.”\n\nIn his State of the Association address, Meyer pointed out, “The unprecedented growth the Association has seen in program participation, not only in the past year, but over the last five years, is an excellent indication of the value dairy producers see in U.S. Registered Holsteins.” Meyer indicated that over the last five years, registrations have increased by ten percent, the number of cows classified have increased by 16 percent, the number of Holsteins on official production test increased by 20 percent and the number of herds enrolled in the Association's hallmark program, Holstein COMPLETE, increased 123 percent, while the number of cows enrolled in COMPLETE increased 120 percent.\n\nThe Wisconsin native also stated, “These illustrations detail how we have successfully increased our market share in an industry that is getting smaller every day.” Meyer credited the members of the Association for the excellent growth, stating, “What is the real secret of this success? It is you, the members of Holstein Association USA. From our youngest junior member to the oldest adult member, you have supported and participated in the programs your Association offers.”\n\nThe demand for U.S. Registered Holsteins continues to soar. The Wisconsin Nationals Sale, managed by Tom Morris LTD, averaged $12,831 on 86 lots.\n\nThe Association's financial strength continues as the year ending December 31, 2007 recognized revenues of $18,064,000, an increase of four percent over 2006. The Association recognized net income of $1,259,000 and an increase in net assets of $499,000.\n\nDuring the convention, John Bierbaum of Burnsville, Minnesota, director at-large, and Jay Houser of Spring Mills, Pennsylvania, director representing Region II, retired from the Holstein Association board of directors. Elected to replace them are James Burdette of Mercersburg, Pennsylvania in Region II, and Boyd Schaufelberger of Greenville, Illinois as director at-large.\n\nNext year's Holstein Association USA national convention and annual meeting will be held in Sacramento, Calif. June 26-30.\n\nFor more information, contact Lindsey Worden, Communications Manager, at 800-952-5200, ext. 4096.\n\n^ back to top ^\n\n2009 Delegate Election Process Has Started\n\nThe delegate election is underway for the 2009 National Convention in Sacramento, California, June 29-30, 2009.

Herzog was honored at the recent National Holstein Convention in Wisconsin Dells, Wis. The award recognizes those who have bred outstanding animals, thereby making a notable contribution to the advancement of the Holstein breed in the United States.\n\nSleepy Hollow Dairy started in the Holstein business in 1903, and for nearly 100 years, was one of the most respected providers of outstanding Registered Holstein genetics in the dairy industry. The first registered animal entered the herd in 1925 and three years later, the herd was moved by Kip's dad, Max, to Petaluma. Kip became a partner in 1961 and managed the herd until it was sold to Ron Pietersma in 2000.\n\nFrom the time Kip took over the herd until it was sold, the name Sleepy Hollow was synonymous with superior genetics. Numerous internationally recognized cow families were developed at Sleepy Hollow, among which 151 cows were designated Gold Medal Dams and 77 Dams of Merit. A total of 173 cows were classified Excellent.\n\nFor years, Sleepy Hollow led the nation in the development of Gold Medal Dams, which showcased the strength of their breeding and reproductive programs. The herd also regularly stood at the top of the DHIR and Production Honor lists. Breeding and developing cows that produced and reproduced at this elite level set the herd apart from its peers.\n\nThe Sleepy Hollow prefix was an international legend for years, first in Japan and later in Europe. More Sleepy Hollow bulls were sold to Germany and France than from any other U.S. breeder, not only because of the outstanding genetics, but also because of the honesty and integrity of the breeding program.\n\nKip tended to use bloodlines that originated from outstanding cow families because he knew they would breed true and maintain the values he wanted in his cows…long-necked dairy machines with huge, open ribs, high and wide rear udders and more substance of bone than most herds. This breeding philosophy was why there were so many older cows in the herd that just kept calving year after year and adding to their lifetime milk totals generation after generation.\n\nBreeding cows that became brood cows, providing the seed stock for dairy producers worldwide, and providing leadership locally and within the Holstein industry are what set Kip Herzog apart from the average breeder. The respect other breeders had for him and the reputation he earned as a man of honor and integrity truly made him an Elite Breeder.\n\nFor more information, contact Lindsey Worden, Communications Manager, at 800-952-5200, ext. 4096.\n\n^ back to top ^\n\nRichard Coyne Receives Distinguished Leadership Award\n\nFrom Holstein Association USA\n\nBrattleboro, Vermont (June 30, 2008)…Richard Coyne, Avon, New York, is the 2008 recipient of the Holstein Association USA's Distinguished Leadership Award. The award was presented at the Association's recent National Convention in Wisconsin Dells, Wis.\n\nIn its second year, the award recognizes an individual who has demonstrated outstanding and unselfish leadership for the betterment of the dairy industry.\n\nAs a young 4-H member 70 years ago, Richard “Dick” Coyne made the decision to introduce Registered Holsteins to his family farm, a decision that had a major impact on his life and career. When he and his brother, Gerald, formed a partnership a few years later, they continued to expand their herd, worked to breed a genetically-superior herd, and Dick added his leadership in local, state and national dairy levels.\n\n“Registered Holsteins have provided my family and me with a great living, brought us many friends, and allowed us to travel, especially during my years on the Holstein board,” Dick said. “I'll always be grateful for that opportunity.”\n\nDick served on the National Holstein board of directors from 1984 to 1992. During his tenure, Dick's knowledge and expertise in breeding, merchandising and showing dairy cattle were of great benefit as a member of the Genetic Advancement Committee (GAC). As a GAC member, he was one of the directors who led the board in changing the TPI formula to a better balance of type and production. That decision paved the way for the TPI formula to include information other than type and production that would guide the U.S. dairy industry toward breeding more profitable cows.\n\nDick always understood the importance of dairy farmers providing a positive image of dairying in the public eye. He was a member of the founding committee for the Dairy of Distinction Program in New York, which recognizes farms for their overall appearance. Coyne Farms was a recipient of the award and Dick continues to serve on the program committee.\n\nPerhaps Dick's greatest leadership accomplishment and contribution to preserving agriculture in his local community was entering Coyne Farms in the New York State Farmland Protection Grants Program. It provides a perpetual restriction on the development of the land, which is located less than 20 miles south of the city of Rochester and bordered by a major interstate. The program will ensure the preservation of the farm and will help protect the rich tradition of agriculture in the Avon community.\n\nDick is a past president of the New York Holstein Association and his son, Greg, is the current president, making them the first father and son to hold the position. Over the years, Dick selected cattle for many regional Holstein club sales and the New York State Sale. He was co-chairman of the 1993 National Convention Holstein Sale in Rochester, N.Y. During his presidency, New York was divided into districts which held individual district Holstein shows and which are still held today.\n\nDick and Jerry have made it inviting for the next generation to farm. They recognized the importance of handing over management responsibilities and giving the next generation a stake in the future of the operation by allowing them to make decisions and try new things. Two of Dick's sons, Greg and Shawn, a nephew, Malachy, and a grandson, Brian, are partners in the operation. Another grandson, Steven, has also returned to the farm after graduating from college.\n\nThere is no doubt Dick's passion for the dairy business has rubbed off on his sons and grandsons and made it an attractive livelihood for them. Nephew Malachy said it best when commenting on what drives his dad and uncle: “I believe their drive and determination come from a desire to have the next generation enjoy the unexplainable satisfaction that is dairy farming.”\n\nFor more information, contact Lindsey Worden, Communications Manager, at 800-952-5200, ext. 4096.\n\n^ back to top ^\n\nMark and Angie Ulness Named Distinguished Young Holstein Breeders\n\nBrattleboro, Vermont (June 30, 2008)…Mark and Angie Ulness, Valders, Wis., are Holstein Association USA's 2008 Distinguished Young Holstein Breeders. They were presented with the award at the recent National Holstein Convention in Wisconsin Dells, Wis.\n\nThe Ulness' have made great strides since taking over their operation in 2002, building a strong foundation for their future with Registered Holsteins based on hard work, careful decision making and strong values.\n\nBoth Mark-31 and Angie-30 grew up on Registered Holstein farms in northeast Wisconsin. Mark's parents, Wally and Ava, established the Ragnar prefix in 1976 and started building their Registered Holstein herd. Angie grew up at Cycle Farms, a fourth-generation Registered Holstein farm, owned by Bill and Clarice Brey and their family.\n\nMark and Angie were actively involved in 4-H and Junior Holstein activities growing up. Following graduation from the University of Wisconsin-Madison with degrees in Dairy Science, Mark returned to the home farm and Angie was employed by the Holstein Association as a regional field representative from 2000-2005.\n\nMark and Angie purchased the herd and machinery in May 2002 and were married that September. In October 2003, they purchased the house, buildings and 80 acres and continue to rent the remaining 140 acres.\n\nHerd Management Considerable improvement has been made in cow comfort and nutrition, which in turn has increased production per cow. The current rolling herd average on twice daily milking is 27,714 pounds of milk, 1,068 pounds of butterfat and 892 pounds of protein on 69 cows.\n\nBreeding Program Mark and Angie believe in using the best AI sires available to maximize genetic improvement and longevity in their herd. “The sires we use combine high type with high production and do it consistently,” Mark said. “Cows need to have strength, width and depth to allow them to consume large amounts of feed and in turn produce large quantities of milk. And if they do that over several lactations, it allows us to market more animals for dairy replacements.” Sires currently being used at Ragnar include Goldwyn, Shottle, Stormatic, Durham, Linjet, Talent, Damion, Advent, Bolton, and Fortune.\n\nProductive Life (PL) is another tool used to help enhance the longevity of the herd. “Just in our herd, we've seen that daughters of bulls with high PL ratings matured gracefully and lived long, trouble-free lives while those from low PL sires often left the herd at a young age or were high maintenance animals,” Mark said.\n\nOver the past six years, Mark and Angie have been working on developing cow families and improving profitability. “We are working on building pedigrees with Very Good and Excellent cows that have the ability to produce large amounts of milk over the course of their lifetimes,” Mark said.\n\n“The ultimate goal of our breeding program is to breed a well-respected herd, consign animals to sales with our prefix that will have a positive impact on other people's herds, breed an animal that will compete well at national shows and be nominated All- American, and to develop a cow family and merchandising program that will have international demand,” Angie said. “Having Registered Holsteins has allowed us to sell our genetics at a premium, resulting in extra income we have put toward paying down loans, reinvesting in new cow families and making capital investments on the farm,” she added. The Holstein COMPLETE program has saved the Ulness' money on the many Holstein Association USA programs and products they use to market their genetics effectively.\n\nThe Ragnar herd has received the Holstein Progressive Breeders Registry Award for the past 15 years. Many of the top cows in the herd trace back to Ragnar Linjet Callie EX-93-3E-GMD-DOM, the granddam of the first bull they sent to AI. The herd's current BAA is 108.9, with 14 cows scored Excellent, 29 Very Good and 21 Good Plus. Six cows have been named Gold Medal Dams and six cows in the herd have produced over 200,000 pounds of milk in their lifetime.\n\nIndustry Involvement Mark and Angie are highly involved in the dairy industry and their local community, serving on national, state and local committees. In February, they received the Wisconsin Holstein Association Distinguished Young Holstein Breeder Award.\n\nWorking with and developing Registered Holsteins is the passion of Mark and Angie. They believe their investment in classification, milk testing, registration, buying higher value semen, embryo transfer, advertising and having a Web site (www.holsteinworld.com/ragnar) will pay off over time. They also see their time spent in the Registered Holstein industry as being beneficial. “Being a part of the Registered Holstein industry has given us the chance to meet many people and develop many friendships,” Angie said. “We cherish the time we spend with breeders who share the same goals and passion we do.”\n\nBoth Mark and Angie want to raise their family like they were raised, giving their three children, Clarissa-4, Garrett-3 and Whitney-8 months, the opportunity to experience many of the “life lessons” on the farm and fun activities involving Registered Holsteins as they did. “We strive to raise our children to be honest and hard working, and to have fun and dream big,” Mark and Angie said. “By paying close attention to the things we can control, and with luck on our side, we can do what we love to do everyday – work with Registered Holsteins successfully.”\n\nFor more information, contact Lindsey Worden, Communications Manager, at 800-952-5200, ext. 4096.\n\n^ back to top ^\n\nSix Finalists Named in Distinguished Junior Member Contest\n\nBrattleboro, Vermont (June 30, 2008)…Six finalists were named in the 2008 Distinguished Junior Holstein Member (DJM) competition at the National Junior Holstein Convention on June 26.

From January to May, registration totals increased 16 percent from the same period in 2007. Transfers totaled 33,406 so far this year, up 4 percent from 2007. Holstein COMPLETE enrollment continues to grow, with 1,788 herds enrolled, including 215,610 animals. In comparing May 2007 to May 2008, enrollment has seen a 13 percent increase in the number of herds enrolled, and a 19 percent increase in the number of cows enrolled. Classification is seeing growth as well, with the classification team scoring 99,868 animals in 2,435 herds so far this year.\n\n2008 Financial Update\n\nChief Financial Officer and Treasurer Barbara Casna presented to the directors the Holstein Association's consolidated financial statements as of May 31, 2008 and reviewed the reserve fund report for the same time period. The Association and its subsidiaries show year-to-date profit on operations of $576,000, which is $95,000 more than May 2007. Through the end of May, the Association's operating revenues increased 1 percent to $7,517,000 compared to the previous year. For the same period, total operating expenses decreased 2 percent to $6,728,000. As of May 31, the reserve fund was valued at $23,684,000.\n\nBylaw Amendment Proposals\n\nThe board reviewed the two bylaw amendment proposals that will be presented to and voted on by the delegate body at the 2008 annual meeting. Bylaw proposal #1, presented by President Doug Maddox on behalf of the board of directors, would allow more members the opportunity to serve as delegates by counting years delegates are elected, whether or not they served, toward their three consecutive years of eligibility and increasing from one to two years the time period before they are again eligible to be elected. It also increases the time period to withdraw from nomination. Bylaw proposal #2, not supported by the board, attempts to restrict AI organizations from changing the common names of their sires.\n\nOther Board Action\n\nThe board adopted a Conflict of Interest policy for officers and directors.\n\nBased on a governance committee recommendation, Executive Director of Association and Processing Services Peter Cole presented a review of the current policy regarding delegate elections and the current governance regions. The board took no action in regard to changing the current system.\n\nResolutions from the Iowa and Minnesota state Holstein associations were reviewed, with five selected to be submitted to the Constitution, Bylaws and Resolutions Committee to be presented at the 2008 annual meeting. The resolutions addressed premises ID, mandatory animal ID, bovine tuberculosis, Johne's disease, and country of origin labeling of agriculture products.\n\nUpcoming Meetings\n\nThe Holstein Association board will hold its Fall board meeting November 13-14, 2008 in St. Louis, Missouri, and its Spring meeting March 26-27, 2009 in Brattleboro, Vermont.\n\nFor more information, contact Lindsey Worden, Communications Manager, at 800-952-5200, ext. 4096.\n\n^ back to top ^\n\nOsborn Named 2008 Rumler Scholarship Recipient\n\nBrattleboro, Vermont (June 16, 2008)…Kasey Osborn, Genoa, New York, is the 2008 Robert H. Rumler Scholarship winner. Kasey is currently enrolled in the HEC MBA Program at the HEC School of Management in Paris, France with an anticipated May 2009 graduation date.\n\n“Having an MBA will make a tremendous difference to me as a potential agri-business leader,” Osborn said. “It will create a more global perspective and provide credibility to not only myself, but our industry in general.”\n\nOsborn's vision is focused on making a positive impact on the dairy industry and he realizes significant changes will be required to make the industry competitive on a worldwide basis. To build on his dairy management and animal health expertise gained in the U.S., he is one of only two Americans in his MBA class, made up people mostly from Europe, Asia and South America.\n\nAt age 27, Osborn has achieved academic and professional excellence well beyond his years. As an animal science undergraduate student at Cornell University, his talents were noticed quickly.\n\n“Due to Kasey's acedemic prowess, he was admitted into Cornell's School of Veterinary Medicine, the top ranked veterinary school in the U.S., as a third year undergraduate student.” said Michael E. Van Amburgh, Associate Professor, Cornell University. “He is one of less than eight of our undergraduate students in the last ten years to achieve such a feat, and that demonstrates his tremendous intellectual capacity and maturity.”\n\nAfter completing veterinary school, Osborn continued on to his true passion in broader dairy management consulting with Linwood Management Group. They hire outstanding professionals to go into currently operating dairy facilities to improve their management, labor, productivity and profitability. On the 2,000-cow dairy, Osborn managed everything from cow care to personnel, while also serving as staff veterinarian.\n\nTo further challenge himself, Osborn then accepted a lecturer position at Cornell. He developed and taught the undergraduate class “Evidenced Based Decision Making on Farms” that integrated financial and production management aspects of dairy farm management. He even worked as a large animal emergency clinician for Midstates Veterinary Clinic on nights and weekends.\n\nOsborn's quickly advancing career has left many cheerleaders behind. Among them, John A. Noble, Linwood Management Group, said, “It was hard for us to lose a blossoming star, but exciting to be a part in helping to encourage an individual committed to this industry.”\n\nHolstein Association USA is proud to assist in those endeavors by providing Osborn with the Robert H. Rumler Scholarship, which was established in 1984. Robert H. Rumler led the Association as Executive Secretary for 25 years and believes U.S. agribusiness needs and deserves the best trained, most highly qualified leaders the nation's educational system and practical experience can provide.\n\nFor more information, contact Lindsey Worden, Communications Manager, at 800-952-5200, ext. 4096.\n\n^ back to top ^\n\n“Ladies of Wisconsin” to Be Offered at National Convention Sale to Benefit Holstein Foundation\n\nBrattleboro, Vt.

This forum could serve as a catalyst for young people, and perhaps others of all ages to get involved in the dairy industry.\n\nThe innovative dairy producer-panelists are: Mark Crave, Waterloo, Wis., Randy Gross, Elkton, S.D., Stephen Maddox, Jr., Riverdale, Calif., Kylie Quesnel, Whiting, Vt., and Mark Ulness, Valders, Wis. They represent a wide array of dairy operations, from coast to coast, in terms of management systems and number of cows. These individuals could be successful in many professions, but they have decided to cast their lot in the dairy industry as actual dairy producers. Three of the five are Young Dairy Leaders Institute (YDLI) alumni.\n\nThe panelists will discuss why they chose to make a career of dairying, and share their perspective on the future of the dairy industry. Additionally, they will address how they got started, what makes their dairies unique, and their management philosophies.\n\nMark Crave\n\nMark Crave is a partner and herd manager at Crave Brothers Farm LLC in Waterloo, Wis. With three of his brothers, he operates a 950-cow, 1,700-acre dairy farm, which also produces award-winning cheese.\n\nThe herd has a RHA of 28,116 milk, 1,017 fat and 844 protein. The BAA of 103.7 is in the top ten nationally for herds its size. The herd has also had show-ring success with several homebred animals receiving All-Wisconsin, Junior All-American and All-American honors recently.\n\nThe Crave Brothers were featured on the NBC Nightly News for producing green energy on their farm. They are also hosting Wisconsin Farm Technology days in July 2009.\n\nMark holds a bachelor's degree in Dairy Science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He has judged shows locally and internationally, and is a YDLI Class I alumnus. Mark and his wife, Tina, have two children, Jacob and Claire.\n\nRandy Gross\n\nRandy Gross and his wife, Jennifer, are the managing partners of Prairie Gold Dairy LLC near Elkton, S.D. Prairie Gold Dairy is in its fourth year of operation, milking 3,000 cows three times daily with 38 full-time employees.\n\nCurrently, ten percent of the herd is registered, but since the start of the dairy, all heifer calves are identified with Holstein tags at birth and enrolled in Basic ID and registered if parentage is 87% RHA or higher. The herd is enrolled in Holstein COMPLETE.\n\nInterestingly, Randy did not grow up on a dairy farm, though he was active in Junior Holstein activities and 4-H. Prior to starting Prairie Gold Dairy, Randy worked in the AI industry for four years in California, then five years as a herdsman at a Wisconsin dairy, where he and Jennifer met. Randy has been elected as a delegate from South Dakota for this year's Annual Convention.\n\nStephen Maddox, Jr.\n\nStephen Maddox, Jr. is a third-generation dairyman whose passion for the dairy industry stemmed from growing up on his family's dairy in Riverdale, Calif. He currently manages the milking herd at Maddox Dairy, where his forward thinking and innovative ideas have helped modernize the dairy's procedures and protocols.\n\nStephen graduated from Cal Poly with a degree in Dairy Science and a minor in Ag Business in 2006. Shortly after graduation, he returned to the home farm to pursue his dream of working on his family's dairy.\n\nStephen is a board member for the Fresno-Madera Holstein Club and a member of the Cal Poly Dairy Advisory Committee.\n\nKylie Quesnel\n\nKylie Quesnel, with her parents and siblings, operate the family's 1,000-cow Perry Brook Dairy in Shoreham, Vt.

She is co-chair for the 2008 International Forum for Women in Dairying, a 4-H leader, and co-chair of the Addison County Young Farmers group. Kylie is also a YDLI Class 5 alumna, and now serves on the YDLI Advisory Committee.\n\nKylie's perspective is unique, as there are not a lot of women her age who manage 1,000-cow dairies.\n\nMark Ulness\n\nMark Ulness and his wife, Angie, farm 220 acres and milk 85 Registered HolsteinsSM near Valders, Wis. Their current rolling herd average on twice daily milking is 27,714 pounds of milk, 1,068 pounds of fat and 892 pounds of protein.\n\nThe Ragnar herd has received the Holstein Progressive Breeders Registry Award for the past 14 years. One of the top cows in the herd is Ragnar Linjet Callie EX-93-GMD-DOM, from which they sent their first bull to AI. The herd's current BAA is 108.5, with 16 cows scored Excellent, 29 Very Good and 20 Good Plus.

An elite group of eleven dairy producers from throughout the United States have met the stringent criteria to qualify as the first members who will receive the prestigious award. Those criteria are:\n\nMust be 25 percent above breed average Mature Equivalent (ME) for milk, fat and protein;\n\nMust have an actual average classification score of 83 points or higher;\n\nMust be 70 percent homebred;\n\nMust be enrolled in the Association's TriStar program;\n\nMust have classified in the award year.\n\nTim Baker\n\nStar-Summit Holsteins\n\nByron Center, Michigan\n\nMore than 94 percent of Tim Baker's 55 cow Registered HolsteinSM herd is homebred and their average classification score is 88.29. They have ME production averages of 32,936M, 1,230F, 1,014P.\n\nTim's parents, Henry and Ruth own the 200-acre farm while Tim and his wife, Jennifer, own the dairy herd. They have two sons, Gerrit-9 and Jack-7, and a daughter, Elise-3.\n\nThanks to having Registered Holsteins, Tim has been able to do a considerable amount of merchandising, which in turn has allowed him to maintain a relatively small herd. Females are consigned to sales, bulls are sold for breeding purposes, and a considerable number of embryos are sold annually.\n\nThe Bakers use the top end proven AI sires that transmit a balance of production and type, breeding to get the best females possible, with strong feet and legs their number one type goal. They like big, strong cows that last and that they can breed from. One of the top cows they bred was Star-Summit Mars Betsy that was EX-93-4E and made a record of 51,410 pounds of milk in 365 days as a ten-year-old and finished with over 380,000 pounds lifetime.\n\nA cow Tim bought when he was 19 years old, LWS Patty Segis, was EX-91-5E, made over 265,000 pounds of milk lifetime and was the foundation of one of their best cow families.\n\nThe cows are milked twice a day in comfort stalls and are housed in a free-stall barn with sand bedding. Henry started the herd in 1957 and is in the process of putting together a 50-year history of the herd. With the outstanding cows and cow families they have developed, it should be a history worth reading.\n\nBack row, l-r, Marcia DeBuhr, Sunny-Valley Advent Frito-Red-ET, Ron and Jean DeBuhr, Sunny-Valley Freelance Elsie-ET, Wayne DeBuhr.

Fourteen years later, Sunny-Valley Registered Holsteins came into existence as a 100 percent registered and AI herd.\n\nSunny-Valley is a family farm, with Ron and Jean DeBuhr the owners and operators with the kids key assets as well. Wayne does the marketing, mating and showing. Marcia does the veterinary work and assists with showing. Sheila does the registration paperwork and assists with the bookkeeping while her husband, Trevor, is a Programmer for Great Lakes Higher Education.\n\nCurrently, three main cow families are being flushed. One they have had great success with is the “Ellie Bell” cow family with Sunny-Valley Durham Electra being the family member Sunny-Valley is best known for. Electra is classified Excellent-95 with a four-year-old, 2x record of 37,930M, 1,755F and 1,220P. Electra was unanimous All-American Junior three-year-old in 2004, two-time Reserve All-American and Reserve Grand Champion at the Eastern Fall National in 2006 and also second place five-year-old at World Dairy Expo in 2006. Her most exciting award came in 2004 when she was named first junior three-year-old, Intermediate Champion and Reserve Grand Champion at World Dairy Expo.\n\nAnother major show cow at Sunny-Valley is April-Day D Burgundy-Red that was purchased as a calf. Currently classified Excellent-90, she has been to World Dairy Expo every year and in 2006 won the Junior three-year-old class and was first in the Kingsmill Futurity.\n\nFrom left, Mark Brehm, Libby Schmitt, Tim Schmitt, Tom Schmitt, Peter Schmitt and Zach Nilles.\n\nPaul, Tom and Tim Schmitt\n\nMorningview Holsteins\n\nDurango, Iowa\n\nThe 90-cow Registered Holstein herd owned by Paul and Donna Schmitt, and their sons Tom and Tim, has ME production averages of 32,038M, 1,231F, 968P. The herd has an average classification score of 84.83 and is 78 percent homebred. The herd is milked twice a day in a tie-stall barn.\n\nIn 1990, the Schmitts made the decision to switch to an all registered herd and get more involved in merchandising. They purchased Walnutknoll Memorial Judy that turned out to be the foundation of one of their best cow families. One of her granddaughters, Morningview Converse Judy EX-93, made over 38,000 pounds of milk as a three-year-old and ended up with 12 sons in AI along with numerous female offspring.\n\nThe herd is on Holstein COMPLETE, is classified at least every seven months, uses the EASY program for registering calves and uses custom Holstein tags. “With so many calves to register, the EASY program is a real time-saver,” Tim said.\n\nWith three families to support, merchandising has been very important to the success at Morningview. The Schmitts do lots of flushing and sell numerous embryos each year, both in the U.S. and internationally. “One of the most enjoyable parts of the registered business is having people visit our farm and showing them our cattle,” Tim said. “That's an important part of merchandising.”\n\nAs far as service sires, “we use a little of everything,” Tim said. Sires that improve feet, legs and udders are most important. “We like to milk cows with good type,” he added.\n\nTom and his wife, Donna, have three kids, as do Tim and his wife, Kim. Everyone is involved in the management and ownership of the dairy.\n\nJoe Brantmeier, center, with sons Andy, left, and Jeff, right.\n\nJoe and Chris Brantmeier\n\nHilrose Holsteins\n\nSherwood, Wisconsin\n\nJoe Brantmeier took over Hilrose Holsteins when his dad retired in 1981. At the time, the herd totaled about 50 cows, not all of which were registered. By 1990, the herd was all registered, and today totals 108 cows on test, 78 percent of which are homebred. They have an average classification score of 86.25 and ME production averages of 32,162M, 1,239F, 956P.\n\nJoe and his wife, Chris, who is a longtime teacher, have two sons, Andy and Jeff, who are active in the operation. Their daughter, Sarah, works for Pfizer.\n\nJoe's main breeding goal is to develop cows with long productive lives, so service sires used have extremely high type, good components and higher reliability. “Because we keep cows longer, we sell a lot of fresh heifers,” Joe said, “so having good type is important. It adds value because no dairyman wants animals with poor type.”\n\nThe Hilrose herd is on Holstein COMPLETE, classifies regularly and uses the EASY program for registering calves. “We love the EASY program because it's so simple and quick,” Joe said. A button tag is put in the calves at birth and custom Holstein tags with the registration number and sire ID after they are registered.\n\nJoe sees the added value Registered Holsteins bring to their dairy. “They are no more work than grades,” he said, “and they give you a chance to develop the really good ones, do some merchandising, and provide additional income.”\n\nJoe and his sons share the workload at Hilrose and work together to make breeding decisions for the herd. “And to be honest,” Joe said, “if we didn't have a registered herd, I'm not sure the boys would want to be dairying. So that's another benefit.”\n\nRandy and Jana Kortus\n\nMainstream Holsteins\n\nLynden, Washington\n\nMainstream Holsteins was started by Randy Kortus in 1981 with 45 Registered Holsteins. Today the herd includes 55 Holstein cows and 22 Registered Jerseys. The Holstein herd is 100 percent homebred, has an average classification score of 84.95 and has ME production averages of 36,466M, 1,406F and 1,087P.\n\nThe herd is grazed, supplemented with grain and other forage as needed.\n\nAs far as breeding goals, Kortus concentrates on production. “Of course we also breed for type,” he said, “but we never lose sight of the importance of production.” Several cows in the herd are flushed regularly, depending on the embryo market. The herd has had considerable AI interest in recent years, with about 15 bulls sent to AI annually. The herd is classified every seven months, with special classifications scheduled as needed.\n\nA highlight for the Kortus' herd in 2007 was having their first cow produce over 60,000 pounds in a single lactation. Mainstream Beaver Heavenly, VG-86, produced the record at 3-4 on 2x milking, peaking at 203 pounds per day. The 365-day record of 60,420M places her first for milk nationally in her class.\n\nHeavenly's granddam, Mainstream Emory Hershey, EX-90, made a great record of 6-7, 365d, 2x, 56,390M, 2,433F, 1,507P. Another cow, Mainstream Adan Harbor, EX-91-2E, has two records over 57,000 pounds of milk, including 4-7, 365d, 2x, 59,590M, 1,845F, 1,645P that places her second nationally for milk in her class.\n\nRandy and Jana have four children, including sons Mark and Mike, who are active on the dairy, and Matt and Melissa, who work off the farm. Randy currently serves as president of the Select Sires board of directors.\n\nFrom left, Tim, Julie, Kristi and Sandy VerHage.\n\nTim and Sandy VerHage\n\nVerHage Holstein Farm\n\nAllegan, Michigan\n\nTim and Sandy VerHage have a 94 percent homebred herd of 59 Registered Holsteins that have ME production averages of 35,425M, 1,730F and 1,006P. Their average classification score is 83.2.\n\nThe VerHage herd ranked number one for production in Michigan in 2007, the sixth time it garnered that honor in the past 10 years, and was also the number one dollar value herd. Also in 2007, the herd was a National Dairy Quality Award Gold winner, with a Somatic Cell Count less than 86,000. It received NDQA recognition in 2006 as well.\n\nThe VerHage herd is on Holstein COMPLETE and usually classifies twice a year. Tim breeds for a balance between type and production, hoping to get cows with long productive lives.\n\nIn 1996, they sold their first embryo and first bull to AI and have since sold hundreds of embryos and several bulls to AI each year.\n\nTim is sold on the added value provided by registered cattle. “Registered animals allow us to market our genetics and provide another income so we can keep our herd small and remain profitable,” Tim said.\n\nThe cow that got the VerHage herd rolling was SFL Bootpeg W Bethany-ET that they purchased as a just fresh two-year-old. Bethany, EX-91-2E-GMD-DOM had a top record of 4-2 365d 2x 48,660M, 2,571F, 1,661P. She and her offspring have been the focal point of the VerHage breeding program, with numerous embryos exported and five sons going to AI. A grandson of Bethany's is currently #50 on the top 100 TPI list.\n\nTim and Sandy have two daughters, Julie-17 and Kristi-15.\n\nAt right is Allen Johnson, owner of Jafral Holsteins, and at left, his nephew, Kevin Huie.\n\nAllen Johnson\n\nJafral Holsteins\n\nHamptonville, North Carolina\n\nAllen Johnson's 39-cow Registered Holstein herd is 100 percent homebred and has ME production averages of 34,552M, 1,236F, 1,014P along with an average classification score of 86.2.\n\nAllen's parents started the commercial herd in 1945. Allen took over the dairy after getting out of the Marines in 1972 and over the next decade sold the grades and replaced them with registered animals. By 1981, the herd was all-registered.\n\nToday's herd basically has two cow families. One started with Rilara Mars Las Ravena that Johnson bought in 1981 as a bred heifer. She was EX-91-2E-GMD. The other was Bonnyside Bova Brenda EX-90-2E-GMD that he bought in 1986.\n\nPrior to last year, the highest record a cow had produced in the herd was just over 45,000 pounds of milk. But last year, a Finley daughter topped that with a record of 3-1, 365d, 2x, 55,700M.\n\nJohnson breeds to maintain stature and front end strength in his cows. “If they have strength of front end, they'll generally have strength throughout,” he said. The herd has an overall CTPI of over 1550 and is classified every seven months.\n\nWorking with Allen on the dairy are his nephew Kevin Huie, who does the outside feeding and cropping, and Kevin's mom, Janet, who feeds calves. The cows are fed corn silage and hay along with a 24 percent protein pellet in the parlor. Grain totals 26-30 pounds per cow per day.\n\nEvie and John Hamilton and their son, Charlie.\n\nJohn and Evie Hamilton\n\nHill-Ton Holsteins\n\nCuba City, Wisconsin\n\nJohn Hamilton has farmed with his dad, William, since 1980. William owns the farm and helps with fieldwork, while John and his wife, Evie, own the dairy herd. The Hamiltons milk 52 Registered Holsteins, 100 percent of which are homebred. They have an average classification score of 85.11 and ME production averages of 32,024M, 1,218F, 951P.\n\nService sires used in the herd must improve strength and stature and be plus for foot & leg composite, udder composite and component percentages.\n\nThe Hamiltons have earned the Progressive Breeders Registry award for 14 consecutive years. They have bred 33 Excellent cows. There are currently five Excellent and 32 Very Good cows in the Hill-Ton herd.\n\nJohn and Evie's son, Charlie, has shown at the county and district levels and plans to show at the state fair this summer. He just recently received a junior member recognition award in the 12 and under age group from the Wisconsin Holstein Association. His best cow, “Cheery,” is VG-88, made over 23,000 pounds of milk as a two year old and will make over 30,000 pounds of milk in 305 days in her second lactation.\n\nBruce and Brenda Long\n\nB-Long Holsteins\n\nNew London, Wisconsin\n\nBruce and Brenda Long started B-Long Holsteins in 1990. Today, their 55-cow Registered Holstein herd is 96 percent homebred and has ME production averages of 34,765M, 1,221F, 1,013P. Classification average is 85.38. There are currently five Excellent and 34 Very Good cows in the herd.\n\nThe Longs have developed 16 cows with over 200,000 pounds of milk lifetime and four over 300,000 pounds, along with 16 Gold Medal Dams and 10 Dams of Merit.\n\nBreeding decisions are based on a balance of production and type, with emphasis on improving type and components. They also consider health traits that they hope will improve their cows' longevity and help their merchandising program.\n\nThe Long herd consists of three main cow families. The top genetic cows are flushed each year to fill AI and embryo contracts and to breed the next generation of top females in the herd.\n\nInvesting in Registered Holsteins has been very beneficial to the Longs financially. Animals consigned to sales have brought excellent prices and embryos and bulls have sold well, too. “Merchandising Registered Holsteins has allowed us to stay a true family farm,” Bruce said, “and the extra income has allowed us to continue dairying without expanding or hiring help.”\n\nBruce and Brenda, who were the Holstein Association USA Distinguished Young Holstein Breeders in 2007, have three sons, Bryant-18, Brandon-17 and Bret-16.\n\nSteve and Amanda Killian and their children, from left, Christian, Olivia and Samuel.\n\nSteve and Amanda Killian\n\nDirt-Road Holsteins\n\nBlair, Wisconsin\n\nSteve and Amanda Killian having been farming on their own since they bought a 284-acre farm from Amanda's mother in 2000. They have a herd of 60 cows, 25 of which are Registered Holsteins, the others Registered Jerseys. The ME production averages on the Holsteins, 72 percent of which are homebred, are: 34,393M, 1,312F, 1,079P. The herd has an average classification score of 84.27.\n\nThe herd is enrolled on the Holstein COMPLETE program and is classified every seven months. Cows are milked twice a day, with Steve handling most of the milkings.\n\nIn 2007, the Killians received a special award at the Wisconsin Holstein Convention for their cow “Jody” that made a 305-day, junior four-year-old, 2x record of 53,273M, 2,078F and 1,505P. It was the first cow in their herd to produce a 305-day record over 50,000 pounds of milk.\n\nSteve and Amanda enjoy the Registered Holstein business including the challenge of matching bulls with cows to breed the best animals possible. They know having records adds greater value to their herd as well. Service sires used must transmit high components and very strong type.\n\n“We want to build a herd of really beautiful, high-producing cows,” Amanda said. “Our cows seem to get better every year and the heifers coming up are the best we've ever bred,” she added. “We're very excited about the future.”\n\nSteve and Amanda have two sons, Sam and Christian, and a daughter, Olivia, with their fourth child due in July.\n\nJake, Sally and Adam Tanis\n\nIdeal Holsteins\n\nCentre Hall, Pennsylvania\n\nJake Tanis III and his wife, Sally, and their son, Adam, own Ideal Holsteins, an 85-cow herd of which 96 percent are homebred and have ME production averages of 33,590M, 1,264F, 988P. The herd's classification average is 84.64 points.\n\nThe herd is classified regularly and uses the EASY program for registering calves. Holstein tags are used on all animals in the herd.\n\nAfter spending 10 years in Missouri raising registered Angus cattle, Jake moved to New Jersey in 1983 and started milking about 70 Holsteins. All were Holsteins, but not all were registered. Five years later, he moved to his present location in Pennsylvania, at which time about 95 percent of the herd was registered.\n\nJake likes strong cows with wide front ends that track straight ahead and have good udders. He believes in the importance of having strong cow families as well. Emphasis for service sires is on type and components.\n\nJake says a lot of credit for the herd's success has to go to Sally and Adam. Sally did not grow up around cows, but today does all the record-keeping for the herd and has as much interest in the cows as Jake does. Adam, a graduate of Penn State, worked for eight years at North Florida Holsteins before joining his parents' operation. He does most of the milking and does a great job of raising crops on their 400-acre farm. He also serves as the operation's mechanic and electrician.\n\nThe cows are milked in a tie-stall barn with newspaper bedding. “Every cow is treated the same,” Jake said. Several cows in the herd have produced records over 45,000 pounds of milk and one has surpassed 300,000 pounds of milk lifetime.\n\nFor more information, contact Lindsey Worden, Communications Manager, at 800-952-5200, ext. 4096.\n\n^ back to top ^\n\nHolstein Association USA Recognizes Outstanding Junior Project Work\n\nBrattleboro, Vt.

March 27-28.\n\nDuring the meeting, the board approved the 2007 financial report presented by CFO Barbara Casna, which showed the Association realized net income of $331,000, which was $47,000 higher than 2006 results. Financial highlights included an increase in revenues from Holstein COMPLETE of 16 percent, an increase in TriStar revenues of five percent, an increase of 27 percent in ear tag sales, an increase in revenues received from registrations of four percent and an increase in revenues from classification of 10 percent.\n\nA total of 215,632 animals were classified, an 11 percent increase, while number of herds classified increased to 5,174, or four percent. At year end, there were 197,680 animals enrolled in Holstein COMPLETE in 1,705 herds which is a 15 percent increase in the number of animals enrolled in the program and a 13 percent increase in herds compared to 2006.\n\nStaff members provided updates on the 2008 Management-by-Objective Business Plan and directors and staff reviewed discussions from the recently-completed regional member meetings. Also discussed were the responsibilities and requirements of national convention hosts.\n\nCommittee Reports\n\nThe board heard reports of the following committees:\n\n-Audit\n\n-Governance\n\n-Nominating\n\n-International\n\n-Junior Advisory\n\n-National FAIR\n\nWithin the Governance Committee report, the board approved a motion to recommend that the President state at the beginning of each annual meeting that, unless the delegates object, the rules of the annual meeting will allow all members present to speak to issues being discussed. In the past, any member could have the floor during the first day's business session, while only delegates were allowed to address the convention on the second day.\n\nAlso from the Governance Committee, the board approved a motion to amend Article III, Section 7 of the Bylaws to read: A person serving or elected as a delegate at three consecutive Annual Meetings is not eligible to be nominated to be a delegate again until at least two Annual Meetings are held.\n\nDirector Glen Brown and staffer Tom Lawlor provided an update on the Association's research on Genomic Selection. This cutting edge technology could speed up genetic improvement within the breed.\n\nPresident Doug Maddox appointed a special Type Advisory Committee, which will be chaired by director Bill Peck. The charge of the committee is to evaluate the current dairy cattle scorecard to discuss its relevancy in today's dairy industry. The committee plans to meet in May and will report to the board at its June meeting in Wisconsin.\n\nThe board approved a motion to grant the Great Western Holstein Show, to be held September 1 in Oregon, “National Show” designation for the open show and “Regional Show” designation for the junior show.\n\nStaff members provided demonstrations of the updated software for Red Book Plus, DairyVision Trend Analysis Program (DVTAP) and DairyVision Current Herd Analysis Program (DVCHAP). They also reviewed the development of a new internet tag ordering system.\n\nOne of the major initiatives of the Association's communications department for 2008 is a complete redesign of the Association's Web site. The board previewed the progress that has been made on the redesign, which is scheduled to go “live” during the fourth quarter of the year.\n\nThe next meeting of the board of directors will be held prior to the annual meeting in Wisconsin Dells, Wis., on June 22-23.

For the first time, Ireland has been honored with hosting the event this coming October.\n\nThe Irish Holstein Friesian Association, a member organization with 3,500 members in 13 Club areas, will be hosting the 12th World Holstein Friesian Conference in Killarney, Ireland October 9-11. The event consists of a two-day conference, a world conference show and various tours. Approximately 400 delegates from over 40 dairying countries are expected to attend, along with up to 10,000 people from all over Ireland, England, Europe and world-wide. The show will be a huge showpiece for Irish cattle and Irish genetics.\n\nThe scheduled educational sessions include: Quality Data for Optimum Management, New Tools for Genetic Progress, The Breeder and Scientist…Working Together, A Holistic Approach to Improvement in Dairy Cow Fertility and The Holstein-Friesian…maximizing her potential.\n\nIreland Agriculture Minister Mary Coughlan said Irish Holstein-Friesian farmers, who consistently breed top quality animals, will be able to showcase to an international audience the high standards of cattle breeding in Ireland. “The conference will provide an opportunity to add value to the sector by creating export opportunities for Irish Holstein-Friesian genetics through the sale of genetically superior live cattle, their semen, ova and embryos,” Coughlan said. She also said dairying is Ireland's most important sector in their agri-food industry.\n\nFor complete details about the conference, including registration information, go to the IHFA Website: www.ihfa.ie.\n\n^ back to top ^\n\nYoung Dairy Leaders Institute Class Six Completes Phase I\n\nBrattleboro, Vt.
