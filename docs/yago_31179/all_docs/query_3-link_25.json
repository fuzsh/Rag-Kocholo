        "text": "Category Archives: Schleswig-Holstein Royals\n\nLuise of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, Princess of Waldeck and Pyrmont\n\nby Susan Flantzer\n\n© Unofficial Royalty 2024\n\nThe County of Waldeck was a county within the Holy Roman Empire since 1180. In 1625, the much smaller County of Pyrmont became part of the much larger County of Waldeck through inheritance and the combined territory was known as the County of Waldeck-Pyrmont. In 1712, Friedrich Anton Ulrich, Count of Waldeck-Pyrmont was elevated to Prince of Waldeck-Pyrmont by Holy Emperor Karl VI.\n\nFriedrich, the last Prince of Waldeck-Pyrmont, abdicated on November 13, 1918, and negotiated an agreement with the government that gave him and his descendants the ownership of the family home Arolsen Castle and Arolsen Forest. Today the territory that encompassed the Principality of Waldeck-Pyrmont is located in the German states of Hesse and Lower Saxony\n\n********************\n\nThe second wife of Georg Viktor, Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont, Princess Luise of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg was born on January 6, 1858, at Schloss Luisenlund in Kiel, Duchy of Schleswig, now in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein. Named Luise Karoline Juliane, she was the third of the three children and the second of the three daughters of Friedrich, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg and Princess Adelheid of Schaumburg-Lippe. Luise’s paternal grandparents were Friedrich Wilhelm, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg and Princess Luise Karoline of Hesse-Kassel. Her maternal grandparents were Georg Wilhelm, Prince of Schaumburg-Lippe and Princess Ida of Waldeck and Pyrmont.\n\nLuise had four siblings:\n\nPrincess Auguste of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg (1844 – 1932), married (his fourth wife) Prince Wilhelm of Hesse-Philippsthal-Barchfeld, had one son\n\nFriedrich Ferdinand, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein (1855 – 1934), married Princess Karoline Mathilde of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg, had six children\n\nPrincess Marie of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg (1859 – 1941), unmarried; Abbess of the Itzehoe Monastery, a Protestant unmarried or widowed noble women’s monastery\n\nPrince Albrecht of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg (1863 – 1948), married (1) Countess Ortrud von Isenburg-Büdingen, had four children (2) Princess Hertha von Isenburg-Büdingen, had one daughter Ortrud who married Prince Ernst August IV of Hanover\n\nHelena of Nassau, the first wife of Georg Viktor, Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont, had been in poor health for the last decade of her life and died on October 28, 1888, aged 57. On April 29, 1891, at Schloss Luisenlund in Güby, Duchy of Schleswig, now in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein, 60-year-old Georg Viktor married 33-year-old Luise of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg.\n\nLuise became the stepmother to Georg Viktor’s five surviving children. Her eldest stepchild was three years older than Luise, the youngest was fifteen years younger.\n\nPrincess Pauline of Waldeck and Pyrmont (1855 – 1925), married Alexis, Prince of Bentheim and Steinfurt, had eight children\n\nPrincess Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont (1858 – 1934), married King Willem III of the Netherlands, had one child Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands\n\nPrincess Helena of Waldeck and Pyrmont (1861 – 1922), married the youngest son of Queen Victoria, Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, had two children including Charles Edward, last reigning Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha whose daughter Sibylla married Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden, Duke of Västerbotten, their son is King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden\n\nFriedrich, Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont (1865 – 1946), married Princess Bathildis of Schaumburg-Lippe, had four children\n\nPrincess Elisabeth of Waldeck and Pyrmont (1873 – 1961) married Alexander, Prince of Erbach-Schönberg, had four children\n\nLuise and Georg Viktor had one son Prince Wolrad of Waldeck and Pyrmont, born on June 26, 1892, in Arolsen, Principality of Waldeck-Pyrmont, now in the German state of Hesse. Through his half-sister Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont, Wolrad was the uncle of Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, the reigning monarch during World War I. He was also the uncle of Charles Edward, the reigning Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha during World War I, and Princess Alice of Albany through his half-sister Helena of Waldeck and Pyrmont who had married Prince, Leopold, Duke of Albany, the youngest son of Queen Victoria.\n\nA year after the birth of his son Wolrad, Georg Viktor, aged 62, died from pneumonia on May 12, 1893, in the spa town Marienbad, Kingdom of Bohemia, now in the Czech Republic. He was buried with his first wife Helena in the Princely Cemetery at Schloss Rhoden (link in German) in Rhoden, Principality of Waldeck-Pyrmont, now in the German state of Hesse.\n\nBecause he showed little interest in his studies, Wolrad was directed toward a military career. He became a Lieutenant in the Dragoon Regiment of the Grand Ducal Hessian Division of the Imperial German Army. During World War I, he fought during the early battles, the Battle of the Frontiers (August 7 – September 6, 1914) and the First Battle of the Marne (September 6 – September 12, 1914). On the evening of October 17, 1914, two months after the start of World War I, Prince Wolrad led a cavalry patrol near Moorslede, Belgium. The patrol came under fire from the advancing British troops. Several of the dragoons were hit and fell off their horses and Prince Wolrad’s horse was also hit. The prince and his aide reached a nearby trench, but then Prince Wolrad saw one of his men lying injured a short distance from the trench. The prince crawled to the wounded man and tried to pull him to safety, but was fatally hit by gunfire and died from his wounds at the age of 22.\n\nLuise survived her husband by 43 years, dying on July 2, 1936, aged 78, in Marburg an der Lahn, Germany. She was buried with her husband Georg Viktor, their son Wolrad, and her husband’s first wife Helena of Nassau in the Princely Cemetery at Schloss Rhoden (link in German) in Rhoden, Hesse, Germany.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

She was born on October 23, 1636, at Gottorp Castle at Schleswig, in the Duchy of Schleswig, now in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein. Hedwig Eleonora was the sixth of the sixteen children and the fourth of the eight daughters of Friedrich III, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp and Marie Elisabeth of Saxony. Hedwig Eleonora’s paternal grandparents were Johann Adolf, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp and Augusta of Denmark, a daughter of Frederik II, King of Denmark. Her maternal grandparents were Johann Georg I, Elector of Saxony and Magdalene Sibylle of Prussia.\n\nHedwig Eleonora had fifteen siblings but only six survived childhood:\n\nSofie Auguste of Holstein-Gottorp (1630 – 1680), married Johann VI, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst, had fifteen children, great-grandparents of Catherine II (the Great), Empress of All Russia, born Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst who married Peter III, Emperor of All Russia (see below)\n\nMagdalene Sibylle of Holstein-Gottorp (1631 – 1719), married Gustav Adolph, Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow, had eleven children including Louise of Mecklenburg-Güstrow who married Frederik IV, King of Denmark\n\nJohann Adolf of Holstein-Gottorp (1632 – 1633), died in infancy\n\nMarie Elisabeth of Holstein-Gottorp (1634 – 1665), married Ludwig VI, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt, had eight children, died in childbirth\n\nFriedrich of Holstein-Gottorp (1635 – 1654), died in his teens\n\nAdolf August of Holstein-Gottorp (born and died 1637), died in infancy\n\nJohann Georg of Holstein-Gottorp (1638 – 1655), died in his teens\n\nAnna Dorothea of Holstein-Gottorp (1640 – 1713), unmarried\n\nChristian Albrecht, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp (1641 – 1695), Frederica Amalia of Denmark, daughter of Frederik III, King of Denmark, had four children, great-grandparents of Peter III, Emperor of All Russia, born Karl Peter Ulrich of Holstein-Gottorp who married the future Catherine II (the Great), Empress of All Russia (see above)\n\nGustav Ulrich of Holstein-Gottorp (born and died 1642), died in infancy\n\nChristine Sabine of Holstein-Gottorp (1643 – 1644), died in infancy\n\nAugust Friedrich of Holstein-Gottorp, Prince-Bishop of Lübeck (link in German) (1646 – 1705), married Christine of Saxe-Weissenfels, no children\n\nAdolf of Holstein-Gottorp (born and died 1647), twin of Elisabeth Sofie, died in infancy\n\nElisabeth Sofie of Holstein-Gottorp (born and died 1647), twin of Adolf, died in infancy\n\nAuguste Marie of Holstein-Gottorp (1649 – 1728), married Friedrich VII, Margrave of Baden-Durlach, had eleven children\n\nHedwig Eleonora’s future husband Karl Gustav became King of Sweden in 1654 upon the abdication of his cousin Christina, Queen of Sweden. The 32-year-old new King of Sweden was unmarried as he has expected that he would marry his cousin Queen Christina and he needed to find a bride as soon as possible to provide an heir. The former Queen Christina of Sweden had met Hedwig Eleonora on her way to Rome, where she would spend the rest of her life. Concerned that Karl Gustav was unmarried, Christina suggested the match. However, Hedwig Eleonora was already engaged to Gustav Adolph, Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow, and so Christina recommended Hedwig Eleonora’s elder sister Magdalene Sibylle instead. After seeing portraits of both sisters, Karl Gustav chose Hedwig Eleonora because of her beauty, and her current fiancé was instead married to her sister Magdalena Sibylle.\n\nOn October 24, 1654, the day after her eighteenth birthday, Hedwig Eleonora was married to Karl Gustav at the Tre Kronor Castle in Stockholm, Sweden. Three days later, Hedwig Eleonora was crowned Queen of Sweden at the Storkrykan (Great Church) in Stockholm.\n\nKarl Gustav and Hedwig Eleonora had only one child, a son who succeeded his father:\n\nKarl XI, King of Sweden (1655 – 1697), married Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark, had seven children but only three survived childhood\n\nSweden was involved in the Second Northern War against Denmark-Norway and Poland-Lithuania and so Karl Gustav was often away on military campaigns. However, after the birth of her son Hedwig Eleonora often accompanied Karl Gustav on his military campaigns. She was very interested in the arts, particularly painting and architecture. Under her leadership, Drottningholm Palace, the current residence of the Swedish monarch, was built. Sadly, Hedwig Eleonora’s marriage lasted less than six years. Her husband Karl X Gustav, King of Sweden died at the age of 37 on February 13, 1660, from influenza and pneumonia, leaving his four-year-old son to succeed him as Karl XI, King of Sweden.\n\nAfter the death of her husband, Hedwig Eleonora was the dowager queen for 55 years. She remained visible in Swedish politics and society until her death. Karl X Gustav left specific instructions in his will for the regency of his son. Hedwig Eleonora was to be Regent of Sweden and her son’s guardian until he reached his majority. She would be the chairperson of the regency council and be responsible for the government along with five senior government officials. However, Hedwig Eleonora would have the advantage of having two votes on the regency council. Throughout her son’s regency, Hedwig Eleonora was present at all council meetings except when she was away to administrate her dower lands. She did not take an active part in politics but used her position as regent to protect her son’s interests and rights. Aware that she lacked the knowledge and support to pursue politics, Hedwig Eleonora did not want to give the regency council any excuse to prevent her from attending the meetings. She learned about the issues that were discussed, made statements, and suggested solutions, but did not actively pursue any of her own opinions.\n\nHedwig Eleonora was only 24-years-old when her husband died and in 1661, she was considered a possible wife for King Charles II of England. She refused the proposal with the official excuse that she wished to remain faithful to her deceased husband. In 1667, 18-year-old Count Carl Gyllenstierna (link in Swedish) became Hedwig Eleonora’s chamberlain. He became her favorite and his career quickly advanced. It is possible that he also became her lover.\n\nEven after her son married Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark, Hedwig Eleonora remained the first lady of the court. Foreign ambassadors always paid their respects to Hedwig Eleonora first, and then to Ulrika Eleonora. The hostility between Hedwig Eleonora’s homeland Holstein-Gottorp and Ulrika Eleonora’s homeland Denmark made the relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law even more tense.\n\nHedwig Eleonora survived her husband by fifty-five years and her son by eighteen years, dying on November 24, 1715, in Stockholm, Sweden at the age of 79. She was buried with her husband at Riddarholmen Church.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

Born on April 13, 1573, in Kiel, Duchy of Holstein-Gottorp, now in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein, she was the fourth of the ten children and the second of the five daughters of Adolf, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, and Christine of Hesse. Her father was the third son of King Frederik I of Denmark and Norway and his second wife Sophie of Pomerania. In 1544, Adolf, his brother Johann, and their half-brother King Christian III of Denmark divided the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein which belonged to Denmark. Adolf, as the youngest, got the first choice. Since he selected the part with the Gottorp Castle, the line of the House of Oldenburg founded by him was called the House of Holstein-Gottorp.\n\nChristina had nine siblings:\n\nFriedrich II, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp (1568 – 1587), unmarried, died in his teens\n\nSophie of Holstein-Gottorp (1569 – 1634), married Johann VII, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, had three childre\n\nPhilipp, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp (1570 – 1590), unmarried\n\nElisabeth of Holstein-Gottorp (1574 – 1587), died in childhood\n\nJohann Adolf, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp (1575 – 1616), married Princess Augusta of Denmark, had eight children\n\nAnna of Holstein-Gottorp (1575 – 1610), married to Count Enno III of Ostfriesland, had three children\n\nChristian of Holstein-Gottorp (1576 – 1577), died in infancy\n\nAgnes of Holstein-Gottorp (1578 – 1627)\n\nJohann Friedrich, Lutheran Administrator of the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen, the Prince-Bishopric of Lübeck and the Prince-Bishopric of Verden (1579 – 1634), unmarried\n\nMaria of Palatinate-Simmern, the first wife of the future Karl IX, King of Sweden died in 1589 at the age of 28. Three years later, forty-two-year-old Karl married nineteen-year-old Christina, the first cousin of his first wife. The couple was married on August 27, 1592, at Nyköping Castle in Nyköping, Södermanland, Sweden. At the time of the marriage, Karl was a Prince of Sweden and the Duke of Södermanland and so Christina became a Princess of Sweden and the Duchess of Södermanland. Karl was a staunch Lutheran and Sweden was then ruled by Karl’s brother Johan III, King of Sweden who, although Protestant, was married to a Catholic Polish princess and had Catholic sympathies. Karl’s marriage with Christina created a stronger alliance with the German Protestants.\n\nKarl had six children with his first wife Maria but five of them died in infancy or childhood before his second marriage. Christina became the stepmother of Karl’s only surviving child:\n\nKatharina of Sweden (1584 – 1638), married Count Palatine Johann Kasimir of Palitinate-Zweibrücken-Kleeburg, had eight children including Carl X Gustav, King of Sweden\n\nChristina and Karl had four children of their own:\n\nGustavus II Adolphus the Great, King of Sweden (1594 – 1632), married Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg, had two daughters, only one survived infancy and succeeded her father as Christina, Queen of Sweden\n\nMaria Elisabet of Sweden (1596 – 1618), married her paternal first cousin Prince Johan of Sweden, Duke of Östergötland, no children\n\nKristina of Sweden (1598 – 1599), died in infancy\n\nKarl Philip of Sweden (1601 – 1622), married morganatically Elizabet Ribbing, had one posthumous daughter\n\nIn 1592, Karl’s brother Johan III, King of Sweden died and he was succeeded by his Roman Catholic son Sigismund III Vasa, who was already King of Poland. Eventually, because of religious issues, the Riksdag (legislature) gained control of the Swedish government and appointed the Lutheran Karl Regent of Sweden. Finally, on February 24, 1604, the Swedish Riksdag declared that Karl’s nephew Sigismund abdicated the Swedish throne and he was recognized as the sovereign – Karl IX, King of Sweden. After a delay of three years, Karl and his wife Christina were crowned King and Queen of Sweden on March 15, 1607, at Uppsala Cathedral in Uppsala, Sweden.\n\nIn 1604, Christina was appointed to be regent in the event that Karl should die before their sons reached the age of majority. As the potential guardian, Christina held an important leadership position. Although Karl did not allow Christina to dictate policy, he did ask for her advice. She did prevent the potential election of her son Karl Filip as Tsar of Russia. Count Jacob Pontusson De la Gardie, a Swedish statesman had proposed ten-year-old Karl Philip as a candidate for Tsar of Russia. When her husband Karl died in 1611, Christina refused to allow Karl Philip to leave for Russia. However, in 1613, Karl Filip went to Denmark to discuss the terms of a potential tsardom. When he got to Denmark, Karl Philip found out that Russian nobles had rejected several candidates, including him, and that Michael Romanov became the consensus candidate and had been elected the first Romanov ruler of Russia. Christina was relieved that the Russian affair was finally over.\n\nChristina’s elder son Gustav II Adolf, King of Sweden in his youth\n\nOn October 30, 1611, at Nyköping Castle in Nyköping, Södermanland, Sweden, 61-year-old Karl IX, King of Sweden died. He was buried at Strängnäs Cathedral in Strängnäs, Södermanland, Sweden. After the death of Karl IX, Christina and Johan, Duke of Östergötland, the son of Karl’s brother Johan III, King of Sweden, shared the short regency of Gustav II Adolf, King of Sweden. The regency lasted from October 1611 to December 1611, when Christina’s elder son was declared of age. However, Christina remained the guardian of her younger son Karl Philip and was regent for his Duchies of Södermanland, Närke, and Värmland. Despite the short regency for her elder son, Christina was considered the real power behind the throne during the early years of Gustav II Adolf’s reign. She prevented the marriage of his marriage to Ebba Magnusdotter Brahe because she feared the complications of marriage with a noble and because she realized a dynastic marriage could have substantial political benefits.\n\nIn 1621, Christina’s younger son Karl Philip accompanied his brother Gustav II Adolf on his military campaign in the Baltic States. During the campaign, Karl Philip became seriously ill and traveled to Narva, then a Swedish possession, now in Estonia for treatment and rest. However, Karl Philip did not recover, dying on January 25, 1622, at the age of only 20. Christina was heartbroken after the death of her younger son, and she retired from public life and lived in seclusion. After Karl Philip’s death, his morganatic, secret marriage to Elisabet Ribbing was discovered, and Christina became the guardian of his posthumous daughter Elisabet Gyllenhielm.\n\nChristina survived her husband by fourteen years, dying at the age of 52, on December 8, 1625, at Gripsholm Castle in Mariefred, Södermanland, Sweden. She was buried in the family crypt at Strängnäs Cathedral in Strängnäs, Sweden, below her husband’s most unusual grave monument – a rider on a horse wearing gold armor placed over the family crypt. The gold armor had been made by twelve of Stockholm’s most prominent goldsmiths.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

She was born at Buckingham Palace on May 25, 1846. Known within the family as Lenchen, Helena’s childhood was spent at her mother’s various homes, in the care of nurses and nannies. An accomplished artist and pianist from a young age, she was overshadowed throughout her life by her siblings. Helena was closest to her brother Alfred, and the two remained so for their entire lives.\n\nHelena’s life would change drastically in 1861, with the death of her beloved father. She began helping her sister Alice who became an unofficial secretary to their mother. After Alice’s marriage, Helena would continue in this role, along with her younger sister Louise, before the role was primarily taken by her youngest sister, Beatrice.\n\nHelena had a brief romance with Carl Ruland, who had served as her father’s librarian. When the Queen discovered her daughter’s interest in one of the servants, Ruland was quickly dispatched back to Germany. Victoria then began a quest to find Helena an appropriate husband.\n\nFor more information on Princess Helena, see Unofficial Royalty: Princess Helena of the United Kingdom, Princess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein\n\nChristian’s Early Life\n\nPrince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg, generally shortened to Schleswig-Holstein was born on January 22, 1831, in Augustenborg, Denmark, the sixth of the seven children of Christian August, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg and Countess Louise Sophie of Danneskiold-Samsøe. His elder surviving brother was Friedrich VIII, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein who married Princess Adelheid of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, a daughter of Queen Victoria’s half-sister Feodora of Leiningen, Princess of Hohenlohe-Langenburg. Among Friedrich and Adelheid’s children was Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein who married Queen Victoria’s grandson Wilhelm II, German Emperor and King of Prussia.\n\nWhile attending the University of Bonn, Christian became close friends with the future German Emperor Friedrich III. This friendship would serve him well in later years, as Friedrich’s wife was Victoria, Princess Royal, the eldest sister of Christian’s future wife.\n\nFor more information on Prince Christian, see Unofficial Royalty: Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein\n\nThe Engagement\n\nHelena was described by her mother as plump, dowdy, uncomplicated, unambitious, obedient, and without charm – which did not help her with marriage prospects. One of Queen Victoria’s requirements for Helena’s husband was that he had to be prepared to live near the Queen so that Helena could continue to be her companion and secretary. This eliminated many potential husbands. The final candidate in Queen Victoria’s search was a 35-year-old impoverished prince, Christian of Schleswig-Holstein, suggested by Queen Victoria’s uncle Leopold I, King of the Belgians.\n\nBeing fifteen years older than Helena, Christian was closer in age to Queen Victoria. When Christian was first summoned to meet Queen Victoria, he assumed that the widowed Queen was inspecting him as a new husband for herself rather than as a husband for one of her daughters. Christian was balding, looked older than his age, and was not considered handsome, certainly not the type of prince a 19-year-old princess sees in her dreams. However, Christian was agreeable and easy-going, spoke fluent English, and had been a long-time friend of Helena’s brother-in-law, the future German Emperor Friedrich III.\n\nIn August 1865, Queen Victoria and all her children went to Coburg to unveil a statue of Prince Albert. It was there that Helena and Christian first met. The possibility of a marriage between Helena and Christian was not met with unanimous approval within the royal family. The Princess of Wales (formerly Princess Alexandra of Denmark) could not tolerate a marriage to someone who, she felt, took the Schleswig and Holstein duchies away from her own father, the King of Denmark. The Prince of Wales supported his wife in this. Helena’s sister Alice also disapproved as she felt Queen Victoria was pushing Helena into this marriage to ensure that Helena would remain near her side. The fact that Christian was 15 years older than Helena certainly did not help that suggestion. However, Helena and Christian knew they did not have many marriage prospects and were both agreeable to the marriage. Their engagement was announced on December 5, 1865.\n\nThe Wedding Site\n\nThe Private Chapel in Windsor Castle was created for Queen Victoria by architect Edward Blore between 1840 and 1847. There were niches with marble sculptures, pews, and a large Gothic chandelier hanging from the ceiling. On November 20, 1992, a fire began in the Private Chapel in Windsor Castle when a painter left a spotlight too close to the curtains. The fire caused much damage to Windsor Castle. The Private Chapel was later restored but the new Private Chapel is much smaller, has chairs instead of pews, and is only able to fit thirty people. The new altar was made by Queen Elizabeth II’s nephew David Armstrong-Jones, 2nd Earl of Snowdon, a furniture designer and maker.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Private Chapel, Windsor Castle in Windsor, England\n\nThe Wedding Guests\n\nThis is a complete list from the London Gazette, Issue 23140, 17 July 1866.\n\nRoyal Guests\n\nQueen Victoria, mother of the bride\n\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales, brother and sister-in-law of the bride\n\nPrince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, brother of the bride\n\nPrince Louise, sister of the bride\n\nPrince Arthur, brother of the bride\n\nPrince Leopold, brother of the bride\n\nPrincess Beatrice, sister of the bride\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge, great-aunt of the bride\n\nLeopold II, King of the Belgians, first cousin once removed of the bride, and his wife Queen Marie Henriette\n\nErnst, 4th Prince of Leiningen, half-first cousin of the bride, and his wife Marie, Princess of Leiningen\n\nPrince Edward of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach\n\nPrince Friedrich of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg, brother of the groom\n\nThe Maharajah Duleep Singh\n\nThe Queen’s Household – participated in the royal, bridegroom’s and bride’s procession\n\nElizabeth Wellesley, Duchess of Wellington, Mistress of the Robes\n\nSusanna Innes-Kerr, Duchess of Roxburghe, Lady of the Bedchamber in Waiting\n\nThe Honorable Mrs. Robert Bruce, Woman of the Bedchamber in Waiting\n\nJohn Townshend, Viscount Sydney, Lord Chamberlain of the Household\n\nValentine Browne, Viscount Castlerosse, Vice-Chamberlain of the Household\n\nJohn Ponsonby, 5th Earl of Bessborough, Lord Steward\n\nGeorge Brudenell-Bruce, 2nd Marquess of Ailesbury, Master of the Horse\n\nLieutenant General The Honorable Charles Grey, Joint Keeper of the Privy Purse, Equerry in Waiting\n\nMajor General Sir Thomas Biddulph, Joint Keeper of the Privy Purse\n\nLord Otho Fitzgerald, Treasurer of the Household\n\nGranville Proby, 4th Earl of Carysfort, Comptroller of the Household\n\nGeorge Bingham, 3rd Earl of Lucan, Gold Stick in Waiting\n\nThomas Foley, 4th Baron Foley, Captain of the Gentlemen-at-Arms\n\nHenry Reynolds-Moreton, 3rd Earl of Ducie, Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard\n\nRichard Boyle, 9th Earl of Cork, Master of the Buckhounds\n\nMajor Sir John Cowell, Master of the Household\n\nFrederick Methuen, 2nd Baron Methuen, Lord in Waiting\n\nLieutenant-Colonel W.H.F.

The design of the lace featured roses, ivy, and myrtle. The train, also made of the Honiton lace, had bouquets of orange blossom and myrtle attached. On her head, Helena wore a wreath of orange blossoms and myrtle with a veil made of Honiton lace which matched her dress. She wore a necklace, earrings, and a brooch, all of opals and diamonds, a wedding gift from her mother Queen Victoria. In addition, Helena wore bracelets set with miniatures and the Royal Order of Victoria and Albert.\n\nThe eight bridesmaids were dressed in white glacé dresses covered with tulle under a long tunic of silver tulle, which was looped up on one side with a chatelaine of pink roses, forget-me-nots, and white heather. The bodice and skirt were also trimmed with pink roses, forget-me-nots, and heather. On their heads, the bridesmaids wore a wreath of pink roses, forget-me-nots, and heather with a long tulle veil.\n\nThe Wedding\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nThe wedding ceremony was held at 12:30 PM on July 5, 1866, at the Private Chapel in Windsor Castle in Windsor, England. At noon, members of the British royal family, along with other royalty and important guests gathered in the White Drawing Room in Windsor Castle. Princess Helena remained in Queen Victoria’s Private Apartments while members of her procession assembled in the corridor outside Queen Victoria’s Private Apartments. Prince Christian, his supporters and members of his procession waited in the Red Room. The Ladies and Gentlemen of The Queen’s Household along with the Ladies and Gentlemen of foreign royalty assembled in the corridor. Ambassadors, Foreign Ministers, Cabinet Ministers, and other guests assembled in the Red and Green Drawing Rooms and were then conducted to their seats. The Archbishop of Canterbury and the other clergy taking part in the wedding ceremony assembled in the Audience Chamber. They then proceeded to the Private Chapel and took their places at the altar.\n\nAfter the Ambassadors, Foreign Ministers, Cabinet Ministers, and other guests had taken their seats and the clergy had assembled in the Private Chapel, the Royal Procession formed in the corridor outside the White Drawing Room and were conducted to the Private Chapel by the Lord Chamberlain and the Vice-Chamberlain. The Lord Chamberlain and the Vice-Chamberlain then proceeded to the Red Room and conducted Prince Christian’s procession to the Private Chapel. Finally, the Lord Chamberlain and the Vice-Chamberlain proceeded to Queen Victoria’s Private Apartments and conducted Princess Helena’s procession to the Private Chapel. As her father had died in 1861, Helena was escorted by her mother Queen Victoria, her eldest brother The Prince of Wales, and her eight bridesmaids.\n\nAs the Bride’s Procession made its way to the Private Chapel, the March from the opera “Scipio” by Georg Friedrich Handel was played. When Helena arrived in the Private Chapel she took her place on the left side of the altar while Queen Victoria was led to her seat.\n\nCharles Longley, Archbishop of Canterbury performed the entire wedding ceremony. The responses of both Helena and Christian were made in a firm and audible voice and Christian spoke with a decidedly foreign accent. When the Archbishop of Canterbury asked, “Who giveth this Woman to be married to this Man?”, it was Queen Victoria, in lieu of her deceased husband, who answered in a dignified and determined manner.

She was born on January 18, 1808, in Kiel Castle in Kiel, Duchy of Holstein, now in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.\n\nVilhelmine Marie had seven siblings but unfortunately, six of them died in infancy:\n\nChristian (born and died September 1791), died in infancy\n\nMarie Louise (1792 – 1793), died in infancy\n\nCaroline (1793 – 1881), married her father’s first cousin Ferdinand, Hereditary Prince of Denmark, no children\n\nLouise (August 1795 – December 1795), died in infancy\n\nChristian (born and died September 1797), died in infancy\n\nJuliana Louise (born and died February 1802), died in infancy\n\nFrederikke Marie (June 1805 – July 1805), died in infancy\n\nVilhelmine Marie had several prospects for marriage including the future King Oscar I of Sweden of the new Bernadotte dynasty but an internal Danish marriage was arranged for her to Prince Frederik of Denmark (the future King Frederik VII), the only surviving child of King Christian VIII and his first wife Charlotte Frederica of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Vilhelmine Marie and Frederik were half-second cousins, both descended from King Frederik V of Denmark. Vilhelmine Marie was a great-grandchild of King Frederik V of Denmark and his first queen Louisa of Great Britain. Frederik was a great-grandchild of King Frederik V and his second queen Juliana Maria of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel.\n\nThis marriage arrangement was mainly due to the desirability of a union of the two branches of the Danish royal family whose relationship was strained. Frederik and Vilhelmine Marie’s wishes and needs were not considered at all. Vilhelmine Marie and Frederick were engaged on May 28, 1826. The wedding was postponed for two years while Frederik was sent on an educational trip to Switzerland, France, and Italy. Frederik and Vilhelmine Marie were married on November 1, 1828, at the Christiansborg Castle Church in Copenhagen, Denmark. The wedding was very popular with the Danish people who participated in the many wedding festivities.\n\nHowever, the marriage was childless and unhappy. Not only was Frederik a heavy drinker, but he was also unfaithful. Vilhelmine Marie, who had a kind-hearted and mild personality, was unable to have any influence on her husband who frequently hurt her feelings. Even Vilhelmine Marie’s parents, the reigning King Frederik VI and his wife Queen Marie, felt sorry for their daughter. The couple separated in 1834 and divorced in 1837.\n\nOne year later, on May 19, 1838, at Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen, Vilhelmine Marie married her first cousin Karl, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, the eldest son of Friedrich Wilhelm, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg and Princess Louise Caroline of Hesse-Kassel. Karl was also the elder brother of Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, the future King Christian IX of Denmark who would succeed King Frederik VII, Vilhelmine Marie’s thrice-married but childless first husband. The marriage was a happy one but Vilhelmine and Karl had no children. It is believed that Vilhelmine Marie was unable to have children as there are no records of any miscarriages or stillbirths.\n\nDuring the First Schleswig War (1848–1851), which Denmark won, Karl served as commander of a Schleswig-Holstein brigade fighting against Denmark. This caused Vilhelmine Marie’s relations with her Danish family to be cut off for a period of time. In 1852, Vilhelmine Marie reconciled with her Danish relatives. From then on, Vilhelmine Marie and her husband Karl lived mainly in Kiel Castle and Louisenlund Castle in Schleswig-Holstein\n\nIn 1864, after the Second Schleswig War, which Denmark lost, Karl’s duchy was annexed by Prussia and Karl lost his ducal title. Vilhelmine Marie and Karl were able to live at the family ancestral home, Schloss Glücksburg, which Wilhelm I, German Emperor allowed the former ducal family to keep. On October 24, 1878, Karl died at Schloss Glücksburg.\n\nVilhelmine Marie’s charitable work made her popular in Glücksburg. She was sad about Denmark’s loss of the Schleswig-Holstein duchies but the new Danish dynasty founded by her brother-in-law King Christian IX gave her much joy. Eventually, she became more and more isolated as her hearing loss made it difficult to communicate. Vilhelmine Marie survived her husband Karl for thirteen years, dying on May 30, 1891, at the age of 83 at Schloss Glücksburg in Schleswig-Holstein, Prussia, German Empire. She was buried next to her husband in the Ducal Mausoleum in the Neuer Friedhof Glücksburg (New Cemetery Glücksburg).\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

Born in Copenhagen, Denmark on June 28, 1796, she was the eldest of the three children and the only daughter of Friedrich Christian II, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg, and Princess Louise Auguste of Denmark. Caroline Amalie’s mother was the only daughter of King Christian VII of Denmark and Caroline Matilda of Wales, the sister of King George III of the United Kingdom. There is strong evidence that Louise Auguste’s father was her mother’s lover Johann Friedrich Struensee.\n\nCaroline Amalie had two younger brothers:\n\nChristian August II, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg (1798 – 1869), married his second cousin Countess Lovisa-Sophie Danneskjold-Samsøe, had seven children including Friedrich VIII, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein- Sonderburg-Augustenburg whose daughter Augusta Victoria married Wilhelm II, German Emperor and Christian who married Queen Victoria’s daughter Princess Helena\n\nFrederik, Prince of Noër (1800 – 1865), married (1) his second cousin Countess Henriette of Danneskjold-Samsøe, had four children (2) married morganatically Mary Esther Lee, daughter of David Lee, a New York merchant, no children\n\nCaroline Amalie spent most of her childhood in Denmark, moving with her family to Augustenborg Palace in her father’s duchy in 1807. In 1808, Prince Christian of Denmark, the eldest son of Hereditary Prince Frederik of Denmark, became the heir presumptive to the Danish throne when his half-uncle King Christian VII died. King Frederik VI, the new king, the only son of King Christian VII, had no surviving sons. Prince Christian had divorced his first wife and needed a new wife. His half-aunt Princess Louise Auguste of Denmark, also the sister of King Frederik VI, suggested her only daughter Caroline Amalie.\n\nIn December 1814, Caroline Amalie became engaged to Christian, now the Hereditary Prince of Denmark. The couple was married on May 22, 1815, at Augustenborg Palace. After having no success conceiving a child, Christian and Caroline Amalie visited many spas throughout Europe from 1818 – 1822 seeking a cure for their inability to have children. Sadly, the couple remained childless.\n\nKing Frederik VI died on December 3, 1839, and Christian inherited the throne as King Christian VIII and Caroline Amalie became Queen. On June 28, 1849, Caroline Amalie attended Christian VIII’s anointing at the Frederiksborg Castle Church. He was the last Danish monarch to be anointed.\n\nCaroline Amalie was a composer of piano music and founded and supported several orphanages. She also was instrumental in opening a school for disadvantaged children and establishing the Women’s Care Association, whose purpose was to provide maternity nursing care for needy women.\n\nOn January 20, 1848, at Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen, 61-year-old King Christian VIII died of blood poisoning after a blood-letting. After her husband’s death, Caroline Amalie spent the winters at Amalienborg Palace and the summers at Sorgenfri Castle north of Copenhagen. Caroline Amalie continued her charitable projects. When Queen Marie, wife of King Frederik VI died in 1852, she took over as patron of the charitable women’s society Det Kvindelige Velgørende Selskab, which remained in existence until 2004.\n\nCaroline Amalie outlived her stepson King Frederik VII and in 1863, saw the resolution of the Danish succession crisis with the establishment of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg when King Christian IX, born Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, became the King of Denmark.\n\nQueen Caroline Amalie survived her husband by 33 years, dying at Sorgenfri Castle north of Copenhagen, Denmark on March 9, 1881, surrounded by the Danish royal family, at the age of 84. She was buried next to her husband at Roskilde Cathedral in Roskilde, Denmark in the Frederik V Chapel.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

In 1864, following the Second Schleswig War, the Duchy of Holstein and the Duchy of Schleswig became occupied territories of the German Confederation and two years later, following the Austro-Prussian War, part of the new Prussian Province of Schleswig-Holstein.

Dorothea had one older brother:\n\nPrince Leopold Clement of Belgium (1878-1916) – unmarried\n\nOn August 2, 1898, in Coburg, Dorothea married Ernst Günther, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein. He was the son of Friedrich VIII, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein and Princess Adelheid of Hohenlohe-Langenburg. Upon his father’s death in January 1880, Ernst Günther had inherited his father’s title. However, just like his father before him, the title was merely in pretense, as the Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein had been annexed by Prussia following the Austro-Prussian War in 1866. Ernst Günther served as a General in the Cavalry and was a member of the Prussian House of Lords.\n\nDorothea and Ernst Günther had no children of their own, but in 1920, they adopted Princess Marie Luise and Prince Johann Georg of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, the children of Prince Albrecht of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg and his first wife, Countess Ortrud of Ysenburg and Büdingen.\n\nWidowed in 1921, Dorothea survived her husband by nearly 46 years.

He was born in Dolzig, Kingdom of Prussia, now in Poland, on August 11, 1863, to Friedrich VIII, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein and Princess Adelheid of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, a daughter of Queen Victoria’s half-sister Feodora of Leiningen.\n\nErnst Günther had six siblings:\n\nPrince Friedrich (1857-1858) – died in childhood\n\nPrincess Auguste Viktoria (1858-1921) – married Wilhelm II, German Emperor, had issue\n\nPrincess Karoline Mathilde (1860) – married Friedrich Ferdinand, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, had issue\n\nPrince Gerhard (born and died 1862) – died in infancy\n\nPrincess Luise Sophie (1866-1952) – married Prince Friedrich Leopold of Prussia, had issue\n\nPrincess Feodora Adelheid (1874-1910) – unmarried\n\nUpon his father’s death in January 1880, Ernst Günther inherited his father’s title. However, just like his father before him, the title was merely in pretense, as the Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein had been annexed by Prussia following the Austro-Prussian War in 1866. He served as a General in the Cavalry and was a member of the Prussian House of Lords.\n\nAn affair in 1896 caused a great scandal within Germany. Ernst Günther had fallen in love with Baroness Johanna von Spitzemberg, the daughter of Hildegard von Spitzemberg, a noted hostess in Berlin, and a friend of the German Imperial Family. Ernst Günther and Johanna wanted to marry, but Kaiser Wilhelm and Kaiserin Auguste Viktoria – Ernst Günther’s sister – quickly made it clear that marriage would not be permitted.\n\nTwo years later, on August 2, 1898, in Coburg, Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, now in the German state of Bavaria, Ernst Günther married Princess Dorothea of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the daughter of Prince Philipp of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Princess Louise of Belgium. They had no children. However, in 1920, they adopted Princess Marie Luise and Prince Johann Georg of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, the children of Prince Albrecht of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg and his first wife, Countess Ortrud of Ysenburg and Büdingen.\n\nErnst Günther died at Schloss Primkenau in Primkenau, Germany, now in Przemków, Poland, on February 22, 1921. He is buried in the Ducal Graveyard in Primkenau.

She was born Princess Adelheid Victoria Amalie Louise Maria Konstanze on July 20, 1835, in Langenburg, Principality of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, now in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, the daughter of Ernst I, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg and Princess Feodora of Leiningen, the elder half-sister of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom.\n\nAdelheid had five siblings:\n\nCarl Ludwig II, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg (1829-1907) – married Marie Dorothea Grathwohl, had issue\n\nPrincess Elise (1830-1850) – unmarried\n\nHermann, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg (1832-1913) – married Princess Leopoldine of Baden, had issue\n\nPrince Victor (1833-1891) – married Laura Seymour, had issue\n\nPrincess Feodora (1839-1872) – married Georg II, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen, had issue\n\nIn 1852, the new French Emperor Napoléon III proposed to Adelheid, hoping that marriage to Queen Victoria’s niece would bring a closer alliance with the United Kingdom. However, Queen Victoria was horrified by the idea but remained silent. Adelheid’s family understood that Victoria’s silence indicated her disapproval and declined the Emperor’s proposal. He went on to marry Eugénie de Montijo, who would later become a close friend of Queen Victoria and her family.\n\nFour years later, in Langenburg on September 11, 1856, Adelheid married Friedrich of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg, the future Friedrich VIII, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein. He was the son of Christian August II, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg and Countess Louise Sophie of Danneskiold-Samsøe. They had seven children:\n\nPrince Friedrich (1857-1858) – died in infancy\n\nPrincess Auguste Viktoria (1858-1921) – married Wilhelm II, German Emperor, had issue\n\nPrincess Karoline Mathilde (1860-1932) – married Friedrich Ferdinand, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, had issue\n\nPrince Gerhard (born and died1862) – died in infancy\n\nErnst Günther, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein (1863-1921) – married Princess Dorothea of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, no issue\n\nPrincess Luise Sophie (1866-1952) – married Prince Friedrich Leopold of Prussia, had issue\n\nPrincess Feodora Adelheid (1874-1910) – unmarried\n\nIn November 1863, Adelheid’s husband claimed his succession to the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein, following the death of the Danish King Frederik VII, and the family moved to Kiel in the Duchy of Holstein. After the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein were annexed by Prussia following the Austro-Prussian War, Adelheid and her family returned to Dolzig, in Lower Lusatia, then part of Prussia, now in Poland, where they had resided after their marriage. They alternated between Dolzig, Gotha, Schloss Primkenau in Silesia, and Schloss Gravenstein near Sonderburg (now known as Gråsten Palace). Schloss Gravenstein had been confiscated from Friedrich’s father in 1852 due to his part in the Schleswig-Holstein War. Following Prussia’s annexation of the duchies, Schloss Gravenstein was returned to Friedrich. Today, it is a summer residence of the Danish Royal Family.\n\nSoon after her husband died in 1880, and her eldest daughter’s marriage in early 1881, Adelheid retired from public life, settling in Dresden, Kingdom of Saxony, now in the German state of Saxony, where she spent her time painting and enjoying the arts. She died on January 25, 1900, in Dresden and was buried in the Ducal Graveyard in Primkenau, Kingdom of Prussia, now in Przemków, Poland.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

His claim was formally recognized by many of the smaller German states and the Federation, but Prussia and Austria adamantly refused. They tried, unsuccessfully, to force the German Confederation to disavow Friedrich’s claim and the sovereignty of Schleswig and Holstein.\n\nThis soon led to the Second Schleswig War which began in February 1864. Just nine months later, the war was over and under the Treaty of Vienna, the two duchies were ceded to Prussia and Austria. Less than two years later, as a result of the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, Schleswig and Holstein were formally annexed by Prussia, becoming the Province of Schleswig-Holstein. Friedrich was permitted to keep his title and later served on the staff of the Prussian Crown Prince (later Friedrich III, German Emperor and King of Prussia) during the Franco-Prussian War.\n\nAt just 50 years old, Friedrich VIII died in Wiesbaden, Kingdom of Prussia, now in Hesse, Germany on January 14, 1880. He is buried in the Ducal Graveyard in Primkenau, Kingdom of Prussia, now in Przemków, Poland.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.
