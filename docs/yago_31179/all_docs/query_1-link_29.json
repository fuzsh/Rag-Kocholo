        "text": "Christian I (February 1426 – May 21, 1481) was a German noble and Scandinavian monarch under the Kalmar Union. He was king of Denmark (1448–1481), Norway (1450–1481) and Sweden (1457–1464).\n\nFrom 1460 to 1481, he was also Duke of Schleswig (within Denmark) and Count (after 1474, Duke) of Holstein (within the Holy Roman Empire). He was the first King from the House of Oldenburg.\n\nKing Christian I was born in February 1426 in Oldenburg in Northern Germany as the eldest son of Count Dietrich of Oldenburg by his second wife, Helvig of Holstein (died 1436). Christian had two younger brothers, Maurice (1428–1464) and Gerhard (1430–1500), and one sister Adelheid.\n\nChristian’s mother, Helvig, was a daughter of Gerhard VI, Count of Holstein, and a sister of Adolphus, Duke of Schleswig.\n\nThrough his mother, Christian was also a cognatic descendant of King Eric V of Denmark through his second daughter Richeza (died 1308) and also a cognatic descendant of King Abel of Denmark through his daughter Sophie.\n\nThrough his father, Christian was a cognatic descendant of King Eric IV of Denmark through his daughter Sophia. Christian thus descended from the three surviving sons of Valdemar II and his second wife Infanta Berengaria of Portugal. He was also a cognatic descendant of King Magnus III of Sweden.\n\nIn January 1448, King Christopher III of Denmark, Sweden and Norway died suddenly and without natural heirs. His death resulted in the break-up of the union of the three kingdoms, as Denmark and Sweden went their separate ways and Norway’s affiliation was unclear.\n\nThe vacant Danish throne was first offered by the Council of the Realm to Duke Adolphus of Schleswig, being the most prominent feudal lord of Danish dominions. The duke declined and recommended his nephew, Count Christian of Oldenburg.\n\nBefore being elected, Christian had to promise to obey the Constitutio Valdemariana, a provision in the ascension promissory of King Valdemar III of Denmark, that promised that in the future, the same person could never be both ruler of the Duchy of Schleswig and Denmark simultaneously.\n\nThe council also demanded that Christian should marry dowager Queen Dorothea of Brandenburg (ca 1430–1495), widow of his predecessor King Christopher III.\n\nOn September 1, 1448, after signing his ascension promissory, Count Christian was elected to the Danish throne as King Christian I of Denmark at the assembly in Viborg.\n\nHis coronation was held on October 28, 1449, in the Church of Our Lady in Copenhagen, at which occasion his marriage with dowager Queen Dorothea was also celebrated.\n\nSweden elected Carl Karl Knutsson King of Sweden with the intent to reestablish the Kalmar Union under a Swedish king.\n\nKing Carl VIII of Sweden was born in October 1408 or 1409, at Ekholmen Castle, the son of Knut Tordsson (Bonde), knight and member of the privy council (riksråd), and Margareta Karlsdotter (Sparre av Tofta), the only daughter and heiress of Carl Ulvsson, Lord of Tofta. Carl was elected King of Norway in the following year.\n\nRegnal name\n\nCarl Knutsson was the second Swedish king by the name of Carl. Carl VIII is a posthumous invention, counting backwards from Carl IX (r. 1604–1611) who adopted his numeral according to a fictitious history of Sweden. King Carl VIII was the first Swedish monarch of the name to actually use a regnal number as Carl II (later retrospectively renumbered VIII), on his wife’s tombstone (1451) at Vadstena.\n\nKing Christian I of Denmark subsequent accessions to the thrones of Norway (in 1450) and Sweden (in 1457) restored the unity of the Kalmar Union for a short period. In 1463, Sweden broke away from the union and Christian’s attempt at a reconquest resulted in his defeat by the Swedish regent Sten Sture the Elder at the Battle of Brunkeberg in 1471.\n\nIn 1460, following the death of his uncle, Duke Adolphus of Schleswig, Count of Holstein, Christian also became Duke of Schleswig and Count of Holstein.\n\nIn 1474 Holy Roman Emperor Friedrich III elevated Christian I from Count of Holstein to Duke of Holstein, thus becoming an immediate imperial vassal of the Emperor.\n\nKing Christian died at Copenhagen Castle on May 21, 1481 at the age of 55. He was interred at the Chapel of the Magi at Roskilde Cathedral, a richly decorated chapel he and Queen Dorothea had erected to serve as a family sepulchral chapel for the House of Oldenburg.\n\nFrederik Christian II, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg (September 28, 1765 – June 14, 1814 ) was a Danish prince and feudal magnate.\n\nFrederik Christian II was born the eldest son of Frederik Christian I, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg (1721–1794), by his wife and cousin Princess Charlotte of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Plön (1744–1770), daughter of Frederik Charles, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Plön and his wife Countess Christiane Armgard von Reventlow.\n\nUntil his father’s death, he was styled “Hereditary Prince of Augustenburg”.\n\nHe was a prince with an exceptionally high level of Danish blood in his ancestry: his maternal grandmother, paternal grandmother, and paternal great-grandmother having been born, respectively, Countess of Reventlow, Countess of Danneskiold-Samsøe, and Countess of Ahlefeldt-Langeland.\n\nHe was closely related to all important families of the Danish high nobility of the time. The negative side was that his ancestry was rather too much “comital” and too little royal. Instead of including royal princesses and duchesses of small and large German states, as was customary with the Oldenburg royal family, their marriage connections had been mostly with the nobility (chiefly of Denmark).\n\nThus, although they were undoubtedly the senior cadet line of the Royal House of Denmark (Oldenburg), the family was regarded as a bit lower than the Ebenbürtige which the rulers of small Germany principalities thought to be the standard.\n\nBy marriage, however, Frederik Christian drew closer to his cousins, the Danish Royal Family. In 1786, the twenty-year-old hereditary prince married his distant cousin, the fourteen-year-old Princess Louise Auguste of Denmark and Norway (1771–1843), purported daughter of Christian VII of Denmark by his wife, the late Queen Caroline Matilda, the youngest and posthumous daughter of Frederick Louis, Prince of Wales, by Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, Caroline Matilda was raised in a secluded family atmosphere away from the royal court of her grandfather King George II of Great Britain.\n\nAt the age of fifteen, she was married to her first cousin, King Christian VII of Denmark and Norway, who suffered from a mental illness and was cold to his wife throughout the marriage. She had two children: the future King Frederik VI of Denmark and Louise Augusta; the latter’s biological father may have been the German physician Johann Friedrich Struensee.\n\nLouise Auguste’s father, the king, was a man with mental disabilities and, throughout his reign, effective control was in the hands of other people (ranging from his step-mother to his wife to his half-brother to various courtiers).\n\nThe king’s mental condition, and his unharmonious relationship with his wife, gave rise to speculation that Louise had been sired by someone other than him, and rumour awarded fatherhood to Johann Friedrich Struensee, the king’s court physician and de facto regent of the country at the time of Louise’s birth.\n\nIndeed, she was at times referred to as la petite Struensee. The truth of the matter cannot be definitely ascertained.\n\nThe story of antecedents of Prince Frederik Christian’s marriage goes as follows: In February 1779, the nation’s foremost statesman, Chief Minister Count Andreas Peter Bernstorff, hatched an ingenious plan for the young princess, something that often has been customary with a royal child suspected of not being sired by its nominal father but in its mother’s illicit liaison: to marry such a child to another member of the royal house.\n\nSince a male child of hers could inherit the throne some day, it would be advantageous to arrange a marriage early, and to marry the “half-royal” back into the extended royal house, to the Hereditary Prince of Augustenburg.\n\nThis plan had the positive effect of more closely connecting the Danish royal house’s two lines, the ruling House of Oldenborg and the cadet House of Augustenburg, thus not only discouraging any breakup of the kingdom but also forestalling the possibility of a foreigner gaining influence into Danish affairs through marriage with her.\n\nThis would certainly happen, for instance, if Louise were to marry her closer relations, the Swedish royals. The danger of Louise Auguste marrying into the Swedish royal house (the latter danger was rather low, however: at that time, there were Swedish princes only twenty years or more her senior, and her first cousin, the future King Gustaf IV Adolph of Sweden, had just been born when she already was seven).\n\nBinding agreements were made as early as in 1780, when Frederik Christian was 15 and Louise was only 9 years old. Five years later, in the spring of 1785, the young Frederik Christian came to Copenhagen. The engagement was announced then, and a year later, on May 27, 1786, the wedding was celebrated at Christiansborg Palace.\n\nThe couple lived at the Castle for many years until the Christiansburg Palace fire of 1794 and the death of his father, the Duke of Augustenborg Frederik Christian I, at which point the prince inherited the estate and the duchy. After 1794, the couple lived during the summer on the island of Als and in Gråsten.\n\nDuke Frederik Charles died on June 14, 1814. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Christian August II, then but sixteen years old. Louise Auguste took control of the Augustenburg estates and the children’s upbringing. The estates were turned over to the son and heir on his return from an extended foreign tour in 1820.\n\nKing Frederik VII (October 6, 1808 – November 15, 1863) was King of Denmark from 1848 to 1863. He was the last Danish monarch of the older Royal branch of the House of Oldenburg and the last king of Denmark to rule as an absolute monarch. During his reign, he signed a constitution that established a Danish parliament and made the country a constitutional monarchy.\n\nMarriages\n\nKing Frederik VII’s first two marriages both ended in scandal and divorce. He was first married in Copenhagen on November 1, 1828 to his second cousin Princess Wilhelmine Marie of Denmark, a daughter of King Frederik VI of Denmark by his wife and first cousin Princess Marie Sophie of Hesse-Cassel. Her father Frederik VI was the only son of King Christian VII of Denmark.\n\nThey separated in 1834 and divorced in 1837. On June 10, 1841 he married for a second time to Duchess Caroline Charlotte Mariane of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, the daughter of Georg, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, and his consort Princess Marie of Hesse-Cassel.\n\nVery early on, the marriage proved to be a very unhappy one, due in large part to The Crown Prince (as Frederik VI was then) displayed a very bad temperament, excessive drinking and shameless womanizing. Princess Caroline Mariane, who was described as incurably shy and nervous, lacked the ability to serve as a calming influence over her consort. After a visit to her parents in Germany in 1844, Caroline Mariane refused to return to Denmark. The divorce was completed in 1846.\n\nOn August 7, 1850 in Frederiksborg Palace, he morganatically married Louise Christina Rasmussen, whom he created Landgravine Danner in 1850 a milliner and former ballet dancer who had for many years been his acquaintance or mistress, the natural daughter of Gotthilf L. Køppen and of Juliane Caroline Rasmussen. This marriage seems to have been happy, although it aroused great moral indignation among the nobility and the bourgeoisie.\n\nAfter three marriages without any issue it created a succession crisis as there was no clear heir to succeed King Frederik VII.\n\nAlso at stake was the future of the duchies of Schleswig (a Danish fief) and of Holstein and Lauenburg (German fiefs) which were joined by personal union with the Kingdom of Denmark. However, since Frederik VII of Denmark was childless, a change in dynasty was imminent and the lines of succession for the duchies and Denmark diverged.\n\nLondon Protocol.\n\nOn May 8, 1852, after the First War of Schleswig, an agreement called the London Protocol was signed. This international treaty was the revision of an earlier protocol, which had been ratified on August 2, 1850, by the major German powers of Austria and Prussia.\n\nThe second London Protocol was recognised by the five major European powers—Austria, France, Prussia, Russia, and the United Kingdom—as well as by the Baltic Sea powers of Denmark and Sweden. The aim of this Protocol was to determine the future of the Schleswig-Holstein duchies and find a suitable heir to the Danish throne.\n\nThe Protocol affirmed the integrity of the Danish federation as a “European necessity and standing principle”.\n\nThat meant that, contrary to the Protocol, the new king of Denmark would not also be the new Duke of Holstein and Lauenburg. So for this purpose, the line of succession to the duchies was modified. Further, it was affirmed that the duchies were to remain as independent entities, and that Schleswig would have no greater constitutional affinity to Denmark than Holstein did.\n\nIn 1851, Russian Emperor Nicholas I had recommended that Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg (born 1818) should be advanced in the Danish succession.\n\nPrince Christian was a younger son of Friedrich Wilhelm, Duke of Glücksburg.\n\nChristian grew up in the Duchy of Schleswig as a Prince of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, a junior branch of the House of Oldenburg which had ruled Denmark since 1448. Following the early death of the father in 1831, Christian grew up in Denmark and was educated at the Military Academy of Copenhagen. After unsuccessfully seeking the hand of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom in marriage, he married his double second cousin, Princess Louise of Hesse-Cassel, in 1842.\n\nPrince Christian of Glücksburg had also been a foster grandson of the royal couple King Frederik VI and Queen Marie Sophie, and thus was well known at the royal court. Prince Christian was a nephew of Queen Marie Sophie and descended from a first cousin of Frederik VI. He was brought up as a Dane, having lived in Danish-speaking lands of the royal dynasty and never bore arms for German interests against Denmark, as had other princes of the House of Glücksburg and the House of Augustenburg.\n\nA further justification for this choice was Christian’s marriage in 1842 to Louise of Hesse-Cassel, who was a daughter of the closest female relative of Frederik VII. Louise’s mother and elder siblings renounced their rights to the Danish throne in favor of Louise and her husband.\n\nBeing of the House of Glücksburg made him a relatively attractive royal candidate from the Danish viewpoint since, as a descendant of Frederik III, he was eligible to succeed in Denmark, although not first-in-line. He was also, but separately, eligible to inherit the dual duchies, but was not first-in-line\n\nThis proposal to have Prince Christian was confirmed by the London Protocol on 8 May 1852, when Prince Christian was chosen to follow Frederik VII’s aging uncle Ferdinand in the line of succession.\n\nThe decision of the London Protocol was implemented by the Danish Law of Succession of July 15, 1853 entitled Royal Ordinance settling the Succession to the Crown on Prince Christian of Glücksburg. This designated him as second-in-line to the Danish throne, following the elderly Prince Ferdinand. Consequently, Prince Christian and his family were granted the titles of Prince and Princess of Denmark and the style of Highness.\n\nFrederick VII died in Glücksburg on November 15, 1863 following an attack of erysipelas and was interred in Roskilde Cathedral. Prince Christian took the throne as King Christian IX.\n\nIn November 1863, Friedrich of Augustenborg claimed the twin-duchies in succession to Frederik VII of Denmark, who also was the last king of Denmark who, by primogeniture, was also sovereign Duke of Schleswig and Holstein, but whose death extinguished the patriline of Denmark’s hereditary Oldenburg kings. The resulting divergence of hereditary claims to the duchies eventually developed into the Second War of Schleswig.\n\nChristian IX’s six children with Louise married into other European royal families, earning him the sobriquet “the father-in-law of Europe”. Among his descendants are Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, King Philippe of Belgium, King Harald V of Norway, Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg, King Charles III of the United Kingdom, former King Constantine II of Greece, and King Felipe VI of Spain.\n\nChristian I (February 1426 – May 21, 1481) was a Scandinavian monarch under the Kalmar Union. He was King of Denmark (1448–1481), Norway (1450–1481) and Sweden (1457–1464). From 1460 to 1481, he was also Duke of Schleswig (within Denmark) and Count (after 1474, Duke) of Holstein (within the Holy Roman Empire). He was the first King of Denmark from the House of Oldenburg.\n\nEarly years\n\nChristian I was born in February 1426 in Oldenburg in Northern Germany as the eldest son of Count Dietrich of Oldenburg by his second wife, Helvig of Holstein (died 1436). Christian had two younger brothers, Maurice (1428–1464) and Gerhard (1430–1500), and one sister Adelheid.\n\nThrough his father, he belonged to the House of Oldenburg, a comital family established since the 12th century in an area west of the River Weser in north-western Germany. Based on the two strongholds of Oldenburg and Delmenhorst, the family had gradually expanded its rule over the neighbouring Frisian tribes of the area.\n\nChristian’s father was called the Fortunate as he had reunited and expanded the family’s territory. Christian’s mother, Helvig, was a daughter of Gerhard VI, Count of Holstein, and a sister of Adolphus, Duke of Schleswig. Through his mother, Christian was also a cognatic descendant of King Eric V of Denmark through his second daughter Richeza (died 1308) and also a cognatic descendant of King Abel of Denmark through his daughter Sophie.\n\nThrough his father, Christian was a cognatic descendant of King Eric IV of Denmark through his daughter Sophia. Christian thus descended from the three surviving sons of Valdemar II and his second wife Berengaria of Portugal.\n\nAt the death of their father in 1440, Christian and his brothers jointly succeeded Dietrich as Count of Oldenburg and Delmenhorst. Christian was raised by his uncle, Duke Adolphus of Schleswig, Count of Holstein (1401–1459) as the childless duke wished for his young nephew to become his heir, and also succeeded in having Christian elected as his successor in the Duchy of Schleswig.\n\nKing of Denmark\n\nIn January 1448, King Christopher III of Denmark, Sweden and Norway died suddenly and without natural heirs. His death resulted in the break-up of the union of the three kingdoms, as Denmark and Sweden went their separate ways and Norway’s affiliation was unclear.\n\nIn the power vacuum that arose following the death of King Christopher III (1416–1448) without a direct heir, Sweden elected Carl Knutsson as King Carl VIII of Sweden (1408–1470) king with the intent to reestablish the union under a Swedish king. Carl VIII was elected as King Carl I of Norway in the following year.\n\nThe vacant Danish throne was first offered by the Council of the Realm to Duke Adolphus of Schleswig, being the most prominent feudal lord of Danish dominions. The duke declined and recommended his nephew, Count Christian of Oldenburg.\n\nBefore being elected, Christian had to promise to obey to the Constitutio Valdemariana, a provision in the ascension promissory of King Valdemar III of Denmark, that promised that in the future, the same person could never be both ruler of the Duchy of Schleswig and Denmark simultaneously.\n\nThe council also demanded that Christian should marry dowager queen Dorothea of Brandenburg (ca 1430–1495), widow of his predecessor King Christopher III. On September 1, 1448, after signing his ascension promissory, count Christian was elected to the Danish throne as King Christian I at the assembly in Viborg. His coronation was held on October 28, 1449, in the Church of Our Lady in Copenhagen, at which occasion his marriage with dowager queen Dorothea was also celebrated.\n\nKing Christian I’s subsequent accessions to the thrones of Norway (in 1450) and Sweden (in 1457), restored the unity of the Kalmar Union for a short period. In 1463, Sweden broke away from the union and Christian’s attempt at a reconquest resulted in his defeat by the Swedish regent Sten Sture the Elder at the Battle of Brunkeberg in 1471.\n\nIn 1460, following the death of his uncle, Duke Adolphus of Schleswig, Count of Holstein, King Christian I also became Duke of Schleswig and Count of Holstein.\n\nFrederik I (October 7, 1471 – April 10, 1533) was the King of Denmark and Norway. Frederik was the last Roman Catholic monarch to reign over Denmark and Norway, when subsequent monarchs embraced Lutheranism after the Protestant Reformation. As King of Norway, Frederik is most remarkable in never having visited the country and was never crowned as such. Therefore, he was styled King of Denmark, the Vends and the Goths, elected King of Norway. Frederik’s reign began the enduring tradition of calling kings of Denmark alternatively by the names Christian and Frederick, which has continued up to the reign of the current monarch, Margrethe II.\n\nBackground\n\nFrederik was the younger son of the first Oldenburg King Christian I of Denmark, Norway and Sweden (1426–81) and of Dorothea of Brandenburg (1430–95). Soon after the death of his father, the underage Frederik was elected co-Duke of Schleswig and Holstein in 1482, the other co-duke being his elder brother, King Hans of Denmark. In 1490 at Frederik’s majority, both duchies were divided between the brothers.\n\nIn 1500 he had convinced his brother King Hans to conquer Dithmarschen. A great army was called from not only the duchies, but with additions from all of the Kalmar Union for which his brother briefly was king. In addition, numerous German mercenaries took part. The expedition failed miserably, however, in the Battle of Hemmingstedt, where one third of all knights of Schleswig and Holstein lost their lives.\n\nReign\n\nWhen his brother, King Hans died, a group of Jutish nobles had offered Frederik the throne as early as 1513, but he had declined, rightly believing that the majority of the Danish nobility would be loyal to his nephew Christian II. In 1523, Christian was forced by disloyal nobles to abdicate, and Frederik took the throne. It is not certain that Frederik ever learned to speak Danish.\n\nAfter becoming king, he continued spending most of his time at Gottorp, a castle and estate in the city of Schleswig.\n\nIn 1524 and 1525 Frederik had to suppress revolts among the peasants in Agder, Jutland and Scania who demanded the restoration of Christian II. The high point of the rebellion came in 1525 when Søren Norby, the governor (statholder) of Gotland, invaded Blekinge in an attempt to restore Christian II to power. He raised 8000 men who besieged Kärnan (Helsingborgs slott), a castle in Helsingborg. Frederik’s general, Johann Rantzau, moved his army to Scania and defeated the peasants soundly in April and May 1525.\n\nFrederik played a central role in the spread of Lutheran teaching throughout Denmark. In his coronation charter, he was made the solemn protector (værner) of Roman Catholicism in Denmark. In that role, he asserted his right to select bishops for the Roman Catholic dioceses in the country. Christian II had been intolerant of Protestant teaching, but Frederik took a more opportunist approach. For example, he ordered that Lutherans and Roman Catholics share the same churches and encouraged the first publication of the Bible in the Danish language.\n\nIn 1526, when Lutheran Reformer Hans Tausen was threatened with arrest and trial for heresy, Frederik appointed him his personal chaplain to give him immunity.\n\nStarting in 1527, Frederik authorized the closure of Franciscan houses and monasteries in 28 Danish cities. He used the popular anti-establishment feelings that ran against some persons of the Roman Catholic hierarchy and nobility of Denmark as well as keen propaganda to decrease the power of bishops and Roman Catholic nobles.\n\nDuring his reign, Frederik was skillful enough to prevent all-out warfare between Protestants and Roman Catholics. In 1532 he succeeded in capturing Christian II who had tried to invade Norway, and to make himself king of the country.\n\nFrederik died on April 10, 1533 in Gottorp, at the age of 61, and was buried in Schleswig Cathedral. Upon Frederik’s death, tensions between Roman Catholics and Protestants rose to a fever pitch which would result in the Count’s Feud (Grevens Fejde).\n\nFamily and children\n\nOn April 10, 1502, Frederik married Anna of Brandenburg (1487–1514), the daughter of Johann Cicero, Elector of Brandenburg and Margaret of Thuringia. The couple had two children:\n\nChristian III, King of Denmark and Norway (August 12, 1503 – January 1, 1559)\n\nDorothea of Denmark (August 1, 1504 – April 11, 1547), married July 1, 1526 to Albert, Duke of Prussia.\n\nFrederik’s wife Anna died on May 5, 1514, 26 years old. Four years later on October 9, 1518 at Kiel, Frederik married Sophie of Pomerania (20 years old; 1498–1568), a daughter of Bogislaw “the Great”, Duke of Pomerania. Sophie and Frederik had six children:\n\nHans II of Denmark, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Haderslev (June 28, 1521 – October 2, 1580)\n\nElizabeth of Denmark (October 14, 1524 – October 15 1586), married:\n\non August 26, 1543 to Magnus III of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.\n\non February 14, 1556 to Ulrich III, Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow.\n\nAdolf of Denmark, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp (January 25, 1526 – October 1, 1586)\n\nAnna of Denmark (1527 – June 4, 1535)\n\nDorothea of Denmark (1528 – November 11, 1575), married on October 27, 1573 to Christopher, Duke of Mecklenburg-Gadebusch.\n\nFrederik of Denmark (April 13, 1532 – October 27, 1556), Prince-Bishop of Hildesheim and Bishop of Schleswig.\n\nOn July 17, 1917 HM King George V of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland changed the name of the royal house from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Windsor. With World War I raging at the time there was a considerable amount of anti-German feelings in the land. For many people it didn’t seem right that the King had a German name while they were fighting a war against the German Empire In searching for a name to rechristened the royal dynasty they decided on the name Windsor, which was felt personified and the strength of the country and it also went along with the royal tradition that many European Royal Houses had of naming their dynasties after a Castle. The original Windsor Castle was built-in the 11th century after the Norman invasion by William the Conqueror. Since the time of Henry I, it has been used by succeeding monarchs and it is the longest-occupied palace in Europe.\n\nThe royal house of the United Kingdom has been known as Windsor now for almost 100 years. Will it remain Windsor one Charles becomes king or will it change? Often when the throne passes through the female line the name of the dynasty will change to reflect the patrilineal descent of the new monarch. This has been the case for the majority of royal houses in Europe although there are exceptions. Some claim that the changing the name of dynasties was the invention of modern historians and that during some of these time periods dynastic names were not consistently used. Even with the kings and queens of England dynastic name changes have not always been consistent. For example, King Stephen was technically a member of the House of Blois but most historians and text books place him as a member of the House of Normandy. The same case happens with William III. Most books place him as a member of the House of Stuart yet he was, in the male line, a member of the Dutch House of Orange.\n\nFrom a Genelaogically perspective, Elizabeth II is a member of the Wettin Dynasty from the collateral branch of the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha line via her descent from Prince Albert, the consort of Queen Victoria. Her husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, is a member of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg. This makes The Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge and his future offsprings members of that dynasty. This is all from a genealogical aspect of course because technically they are members of the House of Windsor. The House of Glücksburg itself is a collateral branch of the House of Oldenburg. The Oldenburg dynasty has ruled in Denmark, Russia, Greece, Norway, Schleswig, Holstein, Oldenburg and Sweden. The question now becomes will the name of the royal house change when Charles succeeds to the throne?\n\nThere has been no indication either way that it will change or that it will not change. In times past this would not have been an issue and the name of the royal house would automatically change once the Crown passed through the female line to reflect the patrilineal line. With the name Windsor the British monarchy has a name that does not have foreign roots like many of the former British royal houses had. This trend, of adopting or keeping nationalistic names for European Monarchies has become the new tradition. Many extant monarchies have chosen to keep the dynastic name even when passing through the female line. For example, in the Netherlands the dynastic name of the royal family is Orange-Nassau despite passing through the female line in the last three generations. Even further back in time Austria kept the Habsburg name even though the last male line Habsburg, Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI, died in 1740. In Russia the name of Romanov was kept even though the last male line Romanov died with the death of Emperor Peter II in 1730.\n\nThe dynasty that replaced the Romanov’s were the House of Holstein-Gottorp a collateral branch of the House of Oldenburg, but because Romanov was the name so associated with the Russian royal family it was decided to retain the name. In Belgium and Luxembourg they also have distanced themselves from their dynastic titles. In 1986, former Grand Duke Jean of Luxembourg, dropped the dynastic title of the House of Bourbon-Parma, because the head of that house, Duke Carlo-Hugo of Bourbon Parma deemed that Jean’s son, the current Grand Duke Henri, had entered into an unequal marriage. In 1921 King Albert I of Belgium dropped the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha dynastic name for the same reasons George V did. Today the Belgian royal family is simply known as being “of Belgium.”\n\nWith Britain now having a gender neutral succession it seems wise to just retain the name of Windsor for the name of the royal family even though it may, or will, pass through the female line many times in the future. With such a proud British (or specifically English) name such as Windsor attached to the royal family this association would be lost by changing it to the House of Glücksburg. It would once again be placing the family name under something foreign and not British or English. Some have theorized that a future Charles III could hyphenate Windsor with Mountbatten, something the queen herself decreed in 1961 for all their descendants who did not hold a royal title, or Charles III could call the royal house the House of Mountbatten or even the House Edinburgh. However, none of those scenarios seem likely.\n\nHopefully this all doesn’t sound xenophobic. My intent was to demonstrate that since the political atmosphere has changed over the centuries when royal families ruled over many different nation-states, and that the modern monarchy is more nationalistic, it makes great sense to abandon that old practice of renaming the royal dynasty when it passed through the female line and to retain a name that reflects and honors the people who the royal family serves.\n\nResuming our look at King Christian IX of Denmark we will begin in the mid 1840s when he began to be a claimant to the throne of Denmark. In 1839 King Christian VIII mounted the throne of Denmark and by the the mid 1840s it was apparent that the heir to the throne, Crown Prince Frederik, would not be producing any heirs, nor would Prince Ferdinand of Denmark, the other in line to the throne. The succession to the Danish throne was semi-Salic among the descendants of King Frederik III of Denmark. This means that after all the direct male descendants of Frederik III had died off those of the female line could inherit the throne.\n\nThe problem with the extinction of the Oldenburg line was not too problematic in Denmark as far as the Danish throne itself was concerned. The problem was with the twin duchies of Schleswig-Holstein. These two territories have been claimed by both the Kingdom of Denmark and the Holy Roman Empire for centuries. The history of these duchies is too complex to do it justice in this simple post on this blog. Suffice it to say that by the 19th century the question of what to do with the duchies was vitally important as German nationalism was on the rise and the question to which state did these duchies belonged, had to be resolved. From the Danish perspective, finding an heir who also had legal claims to both Denmark and Schleswig-Holstein would resolve the issue.\n\nHowever, finding and heir who held claims to both presented a rather large problem. The closest female relative of Frederik VII was his paternal aunt, Princess Louise Charlotte of Denmark, who had married Landgraf Wilhelm of Hesse-Casse. Their eldest son, Friedrich Wilhelm, was also a possible heir. Louise Charlotte and Wilhelm had five daughter and one of the eldest, Louise, was married to Prince Christian. The problem was that since they were not agnatic descendants of the Danish royal family they were not eligible to succeed in Schleswig-Holstein.\n\nThe female heiress of the House of Oldenburg considered most eligible according to the original law of primogeniture established by Frederik III was Princess Caroline of Denmark (1793–1881) who was the eldest daughter of the late king Frederick VI. The problem with Caroline was that by 1847 she was 54 years of age and childless and incapable of producing an heir. Her sister, Princess Wilhelmine of Denmark (1808–1891) presented a similar problem. She had been married and divorced from her cousin, the future Frederik VII, and her second marriage was to Karl, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, the older brother of Prince Christian, and this union was also childless. The next female heir was Princess Louise of Denmark, sister of Frederik VI, who had married Friedrich Christian II, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg. By the 1840s the heir to that line was the her grandson, Duke Frederick of Augustenburg, who would lay claim the throne of Schleswig-Holstein in 1863.\n\nThe House of Glücksburg, the line from which Christian IX descended, also desired the succession to the throne. Even though this was a Junior line of the Danish Royal House and did not hold a claim according to the laws of succession which limited the succession to the throne via the male line of Frederik III, they were also descendants of his through the daughter of King Frederik V of Denmark and after the extinction of all the male descendants of Frederik III the Glücksburg line did have claims to the throne.\n\nThere were many other issues besides his direct genealogy that made Prince Christian a suitable claimant to the Danish throne. At one point he had been a a foster “grandson” of the Frederik VI and his Queen consort Marie Sophie (born Princess Marie Sophie of Hesse-Cassel). During his time spent with Frederik VI and Marie Sophie he had become familiar with the royal court and the traditions of the Danish kings. Despite belonging to a line of the Royal Family that was Germanic in every way, Christian was raised as if he were Danish and he lived in areas that were Danish-speaking and he shunned German nationalism. He did hold a distant claims to both the thrones of Denmark and Schleswig-Holstein although there were people who had superior claims. As was said last week, in 1842 Prince Christian had married a woman, Princess Louise of Hesse-Cassel, with a better claim to the throne than he himself possessed.\n\nIn 1842, Louise’s mother and brother, and elder sister all renounced their rights to the thrones of Denmark and Schleswig-Holstein in favor of Louise and her husband. Prince Christian’s wife was now the closest female heiress of Frederick VII. In 1852, the difficult question of Denmark’s succession was resolved by the London Protocol of that year. The London Protocol selected Christian as next-in-line for the throne after Frederick VII and his uncle. This decision was made a law in Denmark entitled the Danish Law of Succession of 31 July 1853. It was at this time his wife rennounced her claim to the Danish throne and Prince Christian was granted the title of His Highness Prince Christian of Denmark. In 1858 he was raised once again in rank to His Royal Highness Prince Christian of Denmark.\n\nOn November 15, 1863 King Frederik VII of Denmark passed away and Prince Christian succeeded to the throne of Denmark as King Christian IX.\n\nWell, I see I have still a way to go before I am done…so stay tuned to next Friday for more on Christian IX. I am not sure if I will complete it next week, but we shall see!"
