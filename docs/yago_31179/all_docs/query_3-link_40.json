        "text": "6. Georgia Ann Holstein\n\nHOLSTEIN, GEORGIA ANN (1849-1899): Georgia Ann Holstein was born in 1849 to William and Mary A. Holstein of Chambers County, Alabama. Georgia had a twin brother, William W., and three sisters; Lucinda, Elizabeth, and Martha. The circumstances surrounding Georgia’s arrival in Pilot Point are unclear. However, once in North Texas, Georgia lived with her husband, Levi Holstein, by the Denton-Cooke County line, near St. John’s. Levi owned thirty-five acres of land on the Joseph Jeffries survey and made a living in agriculture. On March 16, 1899, at the age of fifty years old, Georgia passed away of unknown circumstances and was buried in St. John’s Cemetery in Pilot Point.\n\nAnn Allen | Isaac Allen | Matilda Allen | Thomas Allen | Martha Billingslea | John Burton | Louisa Burton | Dora Davis | Wash Davis | Charles Ellis | Mrs. Charles Ellis | Gus Finch | Josaphine Finch | Mary Turner Fourteen | Eliza Jane White Green | Hezekiah Griffin | Lindsay Haflin | Melvinie Hays | Charity Shears Holloway Helm | Henry Holloway | Georgia Ann Holstein | Abraham Lyles | Mary Varner Lyles | Marvin Newsom | Charles Oliver | Peggy Oliver | Mary B.
