        "text": "Related Families-Page 8\n\nJurian Westfall\n\nMy gr. gr. gr. gr. gr. gr. gr. gr. grandfather was Juriaen Westfall (Westvael) born in 1629. My first recorded Westfall ancestor was Jurian Westfall who came to America in 1642. On August 4, 1642 my ancestor Jurian Westfall (Juriaen Van Westphalen) arrived in New Amsterdam, New York aboard a ship called \"The Houttuyn\" from Luyderdorp, Holland. He was only 13 at the time. His family had migrated to Holland from Westphalia in Germany in the 1600's. It is not known whether his parents died in Holland or enroute, or he came with other relatives.\n\nHe then went up the Hudson River 135 miles arriving at Fort Orange (later Albany) New York on August 11, 1642. He arrived as an indentured servant to killiaen Van Reassalaer. He was placed in the home of Michael Jansen ... Jurian moved south of Albany to Esopus (later Kingston) New York with his friend and fellow indentured servant Evert Pels in about 1653. He was granted 32 morgan (70 acres) of land Sept. of 1654. He married Marretge Jansen in that same year. On Aug. 17, 1659 Jurian and 12 others petitioned Peter Stuyvesant to establish a chuch at Wiltwyck (Esopus was briefly named Wiltwyck and later after British rule called Kingston}. Jurian signed with a three pronged fork of trident mark. The church was established. Numerous records regarding Jurian and his descendants are available in records of the then Dutch Reformed Church of New York.\n\nI found the following information in a book \"American Nomads\" written by Emily Stowell whose ancestor Jacob Kuykendall married Sara Westfall daughter of Johannes.... The Esopus Indians lived near Wiltwyck and for a number of years they were peaceful, but in 1663 they burned and looted the town. There were 12 men, 2 children, and 4 women killed, and 6 women and 7 children taken prisoner. Jurian and his family escaped harm at the time, but later in 1667 or 1668 Jurian was killed by Indians who were at war with the Esopus Indians while he was guiding a troop of British soldiers.\n\nJurian married Marretje Hansen Van Nordstrand (or Van Nostrand) in abt. 1653 or 1654. Marretje was born in about 1636 in Nordstrand, Schleswig-Holstein, Denmark (now Germany). Her father was Hans Hansen or Jansen (Hans Hansen Van Nordstrand). Hans was born Bet. 1600 and 1610 on Nordstrand Island, Schleswig-Holstein, Denmark (now Germany), and migrated to New Amsterdam in 1639. Hans was a farmer, and owned a farm in the Flatbush neighborhood located in the borough of Brooklyn in Kings County, Long Island, New York. The community name derives from the Dutch for \"level forest\" and is presently bounded by Parkside Avenue, Nostrand Avenue, Avenue H and Coney Island Avenue. It includes the southernmost portion of Prospect Park. Marretje's father Hans Hansen Van Nostrand (or Nordstrand) married 1st Rymerig Volkert, and they had these children-Jan, Volkert, Marritje, Simon, and Rommetje Hansen Van Nostrand. His first wife died before 1645, and Hans placed Marritje who was just 9 in the home of a farmer Phillip Garretsen where she learned the art of homemaking. Hans Hansen Van Nostrand married for a second time 29 Nov 1652 at Kingston, NY to Janneken Gerrits Van Loon, and they had these children: Catherine, Gerret, Jan, and Peter Hansen Van Nostrand. The children and descendants of Hans most often spelled their name Van Nostrand, though it often appears recorded spelled a number of different ways, Van Noorstrand, Van Nordstrand, Van Norstrand, Van Noordstrandt. Hans died in 1690 in Flatlands, (Brooklyn), Kings, Co., NY. After Jurian's death Marritje remarried to Jacob Jansen Stoutenburgh. Marritje died after 1670 in Ulster, Kingston County, New York.\n\nJurian and Marretje (Hansen) Westfall had 6 children-Rymerick Westfall, Nicholas Claes Westfall, Johannes Juriaen Westfall, Abel Westfall, Symen Westfall, and Elsjen Westfall.\n\n(1) Rymerick Westfall\n\nJurian and Marretje (Hansen Van Nordstrand) Westfall's daughter Rymerick Westfall was born in 1656 Esopus, Kingston, Ulster County, New York.

As a youth, he explored Cuddy Mountain fishing the creeks and streams with friends and family. He graduated from Cambridge High School in 1950 and joined the U.S. Air Force in 1951. He completed basic training at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas, and was assigned to Brooks Air Force Base, San Antonio, until 1953. His first tour of duty took him to Libya.

They traveled to Michigan and Oregon. Don taught in the ROTC program at the University of Oregon, worked part-time and went to night school. Don was chosen for the USAF Security Service and received a Top Secret Cryptographic Security Clearance. USAFSS was composed primarily of airmen culled from the cream of the Air Force's enlisted recruits. It was a secretive and tight-knit branch tasked with monitoring, collecting and interpreting military voice and electronic signals of countries of interest, which often were Soviet or Eastern bloc. Don was sent to language school at Syracuse University in New York where he became fluent in Russian. In addition to language school, again, he worked part-time and went to night school. He completed his college credits there and received a bachelor of arts degree in 1969. The presence of a wife and six children ages 3-13, was noted at his graduation ceremony. Don's time in the USAFSS took him and his family across the nation and the world as he completed assignments in Maryland, Alaska, Germany, Turkey and Japan. In 1971, Don retired from the Air Force with an honorable discharge. He settled in Nampa with his wife and children and lived there for the rest of his life. He was employed by the Idaho Department of Employment in Nampa. During his time with the department he was a senior job consultant and a labor market analyst, traveling Southwest Idaho to write monthly reports on labor activity.

He and Shirley traveled in the Pacific Northwest visiting the San Juan Islands, Mount St. Helens, the Oregon Coast, Glacier National Park and Yellowstone. He enjoyed many other travels, including a special trip in 2000 to England and Scotland. Don loved the outdoors and was an avid fisherman, hunter and gardener. When he was not outdoors, Don could be found reading a spy or mystery novel, watching football, playing Solitaire, or listening to classical music or opera in his red pick-up truck. Don will be remembered by his wife as a good man and loving partner in this adventure. He was a companion through good times and trying circumstances. Dad will be remembered by his children as their biggest fan, and as a quiet, forgiving man who was a compassionate counselor in times of crisis. He was there as a Little League member, Boy Scout leader, Rainbow Dad, football fan, babysitter, and devoted grandfather. He taught his children an appreciation of learning, a love of the outdoors, the value of community service, love of country, and the importance of remembering the \"little things\" like favorite foods, anniversary, birthdays and Valentines. He is survived by his mother Margaret of Cambridge; his wife Shirley of Nampa; his sister and her husband Marthlyn and Laurence Johnson of Boise; his six children  son Donald Jr. of Nampa; son Alex of Boise; daughter Stephanie Sherlock and her husband Jack, of Boise; son Scott and his wife Sharon Westfall of Nampa; daughter Allison Westfall and her husband David Johnson of Nampa; and daughter Valerie Dunnigan and her husband Todd Dunnigan of Caldwell; 18 grandchildren; and 16 great grandchildren, and several nieces and nephews.
