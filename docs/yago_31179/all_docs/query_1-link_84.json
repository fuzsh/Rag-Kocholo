In 1917, George V issued letters patent that precisely regulated these matters, specifying that a certain set of individuals were exclusively entitled to certain styles. Before 1917, styles and titles were regulated by a mixture of partial rules and customs.\n\nThis introduction presents an overview of what these rules and customs were prior to 1917. The rest of the page analyzes in more detail the actual practice, and provides the texts of a number of grants.\n\nTitles and Styles: some general principles\n\nSee also what I have to say on royal styles.\n\nTitles and styles, like dignities, precedence, distinctions, orders and decorations, emanate from the sovereign who is the fons honorum, fount of all honors. There is, however, a substantial difference between some of these honors and the rest: to peerages is attached a very high privilege, that of sitting in the House of Lords (the privilege was severely curtailed, but not altogether eliminated, by the House of Lords Act 1999). Holders of peerages are not just recipients of honors emanating from the sovereign, they are called to play an important constitutional role. For this reason, the dignity to which this role is linked has become part of constitutional law, and around it has grown a substantial body of law defining and protecting the rights and duties of holders of peerages. In particular, a peerage may only be created in a very specific form (by letters patent passed under the Great Seal) under governmental advice, holders of peerages cannot be deprived except by an Act of Parliament, peerages may be resigned only under certain procedures defined by statutes.\n\nNone of this body of law applies in the slightest way to other titles and styles, such as those of Prince and Highness. These styles and titles were, until comparatively recently (1917), governed mostly by sometimes ambiguous custom. They have remained part of the royal prerogative, and their conferral does not necessitate the advice of government. They can be conferred in a variety of ways: \"group conferrals\" (a single document defining a limited or unlimited class of people who receive them) or conferrals ad personam. The forms can be letters patent or royal warrant. The \"group conferrals\" are typically passed under the Great Seal, while the warrants ad personam are generally not.\n\nMore importantly, the conferral of a title or style does not create any substantial rights, certainly not rights that can be defended in the courts. For example, if the Sovereign issues an order by royal warrant which is not being carried out, there is no way for the courts to enforce its execution: it is up to the sovereign to do something about it (scolding the recipient of the royal warrant or removing him). Also, once a title has been conferred, nothing but custom and tradition dictates that it cannot be taken away. \"The Lord giveth, The Lord taketh away\". It may seem inappopriate or unfair, but it is certainly not illegal.\n\nFundamentally, the conferral of a style is an order given by the sovereign to his subjects, and in particular to the officers who are in charge of ceremonial and precedence (the Earl Marshal and the kings of arms and heralds), to call someone in a particular way. The order may or should be followed by dutiful subjects until such time as the sovereign changes his mind, at which point any obligation (which cannot be enforced anyway) ceases.\n\nAs to the form that this order can take, there is no rule, either for the conferral or the alteration, or the withdrawal of the style. Formal written documents like letters patent and royal warrants are merely written evidence for the expression of the sovereign's will, but it is the sovereign's will that counts, however it may be publicized. Of course, the traditional medieval forms of letters patent are the best-known and most familiar.\n\nIn what follows, I will call \"prince\" a title, and the varieties of \"Serene Highness\", \"Highness\", \"Royal Highness\" styles. This distinction is purely for my convenience; it is not made in the documents which typically call either one \"style, title, or attribute\". In German, the latter styles and titles are called Prädikat, in French, \"traitement\", but the English language does not seem to make a consistent distinction.\n\nPatterns and Customs: an overview\n\nUntil 1917, one of the main questions to arise was that of the descendants of the sovereign beyond the first degree. Since Stuart times if not earlier, the children (male and female) of the sovereign were called \"Prince\" or \"Princess\", and no later than the Restoration were styled \"Royal Highness\". What of more remote relatives?\n\nThe problem of styling grandchildren of the sovereign at the English court did not arise much during the Tudors and the Stuarts:\n\nthe only grandchildren of Henry VII born during his lifetime were the children of his daughter Margaret and James IV of Scotland, born outside the realm\n\nHenry VIII had no grandchildren\n\nMary I and Elizabeth I had no children\n\nThe only grandchildren of James I born during his lifetime were the children of his daughter Elizabeth and the Elector Palatine, all born overseas, either Heidelberg or the Hague\n\nonly two of those children, Prince Rupert (on whom more below) and Elizabeth, abbess of Herford, ever resided in Britain\n\nThe only child of Charles I married during his lifetime was Mary, whose only son William (future William III) was born in the Hague in 1650, a year after Charles I's death\n\nUnder the late Stuarts, the situation arose with the children of the duke of York (son of Charles I, brother of Charles II) and the children of Princess Anne (daughter of James II, sister of Mary II). It appears that these grandchildren/nephews of sovereigns were titled \"Prince\" for grandsons in male line, \"Lord\" or \"Prince\" for grandsons in female line, \"Lady\" for granddaughters in either male or female line, and were not styled \"Highness\" (except the very special case of the duke of Gloucester, second in line to the throne).\n\nWith the Hanoverians, new situations arose.\n\nGeorge I had siblings who were not male-line descendants of a sovereign. He also came to the throne a grandfather, since his son had several children. Under his reign, the practice was to title these grandchildren (who were all children of an eldest son) Princes and Princesses, and to give them the style of \"Highness\". Consistent with this, from the reign of George II at least daughters of sovereigns start using special coronets to indicate their rank (whereas the warrant of 1662 regulating coronets for the royal family does not prescribe any coronets for females).\n\nUnder George II, there were again grandchildren (all children of an eldest son), but the practice changed and they were styled \"Royal Highness\", in 1737. The practice was formalized by letters patent of 1864.\n\nThe grandchildren in male line of George III (other than children of the Prince of Wales) were called princes and princesses, but only styled Highness until 1830. The change to Royal Highness seems to originate with William IV (see Garter's memorandum), and was formalized by the letters patent of 1864 (see PRO HO 45/8933/2, letter of C. B. Phipps to the Lord Chancellor, Jan 21, 1864: \"The Queen is quite decided as to the propriety of extending the title of Royal Highness to all grandchildren, being the children of sons of a Sovereign. \" [emphasis added].)\n\nGeorge III's reign saw the first great-grandchildren of a sovereign in male line, the 2nd duke of Gloucester and his sister, who were also the nephew and niece of a sovereign. They were titled \"Prince\" and \"Princess\", but were styled \"Highness\" until they received a formal grant of the style \"Royal Highness\" late in their life (1816, when he married George III's daughter). It is not absolutely clear, however, whether the title of Prince was due to being great-grandson of George II or nephew of George III (as the latter, the 2nd duke of Gloucester was entitled to a special coronet distinguishing him from other dukes, by virtue of a warrant of 1662). The custom that \"Princes and Princesses of [the] Royal Family descended from and in lineal succession to the Crown as now established by law all bear the style and title of Highness\" is declared in the preamble to the Letters Patent of 1864.\n\nUnder the last of the Hanoverians, Queen Victoria, the case of even more distant relations arose:\n\na great-grandchild in male line who was not also nephew of a sovereign (the 2nd duke of Cumberland, b. 1845)\n\ngreat-great-grandchildren in male line of a sovereign (the children of the former, from 1879)\n\ngreat-grandchildren in male line of a living sovereign (the children of the duke of York, from 1894)\n\ngreat-grandchildren in male line of a living sovereign not descended from the prince of Wales (the children of the reigning duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, from 1906)\n\nThe third case occasioned a formal decision in 1898 to grant the children of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales the style of \"Royal Highness\"; prior to that date, they appear to have been considered as Princes, and, according to the preamble of the Letters Patent of 1864, were entitled to the style of \"Highness\". The 4th case is similar to the 1st. It, like the first two cases, is somewhat obscured in practice by the fact that the individuals concerned mostly lived abroad (except for the 2d duke of Cumberland's sister, who, as a matter of fact, used the coronet of a British princess) and were also entitled to other styles: \"Royal Highness\" (members of the royal, albeit deposed, house of Hanover), \"Highness\" (the eldest son of the reigning duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha), \"Serene Highness\" (the other children of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha). Hence their alternate styles could very well mask any British style. It would be interesting to know what style the younger children of the 2nd duke of Albany (reigning duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha) would have had in Britain, but the oldest was 7 by the time World War I broke out, and had always lived in Germany, so it is unlikely that the question ever arose. It is a fact, however, that the individuals in the second case were officially called \"born princes of Great Britain and Ireland\" (in the consents to their marriages), which implies that the same must have been the case with their father. It is also interesting that the official consent to the marriage of the 2nd duke of Albany also calls him \"born prince of Great Britain and Ireland\" (which he obviously was), a qualification that is not otherwise used, as if to assert in advance of the marriage the hereditary nature of the title.\n\nAnother novelty arose under Queen Victoria. Until the 19th century, princesses married abroad, so that the status of their issue was never a question for the British court. Some of Queen Victoria's daughters, however, remained in Britain after their marriage, their husbands were naturalixed, and their children were raised in Britain as British subjects. This raised the question of the rank of children of daughters of a sovereign, a question that had not been posed since 1688. The practice appeared to be to confer the style of \"Royal Highness\" on the husband of Victoria's daughter (when he was a foreigner, as with Alice, Helena, Beatrice; but this did not happen with the husband of Louise, who happened to be the only Briton among Victoria's sons-in-law), and the style of \"Highness\" on the children of the marriage being British born subjects. The children of these marriages used their father's foreign title of Prince (Schleswig-Holstein, Battenberg; the duchess of Argyll had no children). This pattern repeated itself with the only daughter of Edward VII, whose British husband received no style (but did receive a dukedom) and whose daughters were given the title of \"Princess\" and the style of \"Highness\". George V's only daughter Mary did not marry until after the letters patent of 1917.\n\nThose five cases are suggestive of a pattern, if not a custom. What happened with more distant issue? The only case with such issue residing in Britain were the Battenbergs, who were customarily given their German style of \"Serene Highness\", and the son of the duchess of Fife, who was probably entitled to more than that through his father, as seen below.\n\nTwo more interesting cases arose before 1917, both a month apart in 1914:\n\nthe children of the duke and duchess of Brunswick were the first great-great-great-grandchildren in male line of a sovereign; they were considered to be princes of Great Britain from birth and were explicitly granted the style of Highness by George V\n\nAlastair Arthur of Connaught, born in 1914, the first instance of a great-grandchild of a sovereign in male line born in Britain who was not more closely related to a sovereign (the 2nd duke of Gloucester and his sister had an uncle king, the Cumberlands and the Saxe-Coburg-Gothas were born abroad). It appears that he was a prince. As for the style of \"Highness\", several publications give it to him until about 1924. He happened to be the son of the duchess of Fife mentioned above.\n\nBoth cases are discussed in more detail below.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe following conclusions can be drawn:\n\nuntil 1917, the title of Prince was purely customary (except for the grant in 1905 to the daughters of the Princess Royal, and in 1914 to the children of the duke and duchess of Brunswick)\n\nsons of the sovereign were princes and RH from the 17th c. (formalized in 1864 and 1917)\n\ndaughters of the sovereign were princesses from the Restoration, RH from George I\n\nsons of the eldest son of the Sovereign were Prince and H from George I, RH from 1737\n\ndaughters of the eldest son of the Sovereign were Princess under George I, Lady under George II, Princess thereafter; H from George I, RH from 1737\n\nother grandsons of the sovereign (in male line) were Prince from George I, H from Charles II, RH after 1830 (formalized in 1864 and 1917)\n\nother granddaughters of the sovereign (in male line) were Princess and H under George I and from George III, RH after 1830 (formalized in 1864 and 1917)\n\nunder Victoria, a pattern developed to make British children of daughters of the sovereign \"Prince\" and \"Highness\" (grants ad personam 1867, 1887, 1905; practice ended after 1917); they had been H under James II\n\ngreat-grandchildren of the sovereign who were children of the eldest son of any Prince of Wales were \"Prince/ss\" and \"Royal Highness\" (formal grant in 1898; restricted to the eldest living son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales in 1917)\n\ngreat-grandchildren of the sovereign (in male line) were Prince/ss and H except in the previous case (preamble of the Letters Patent of 1864; first instance under George III; ended in 1917)\n\nmore distant descendants of the sovereign (in male line) were probably Prince/ss and H (preamble of the Letters Patent of 1864; ended in 1917)\n\nThese conclusions are more or less listed in decreasing degree of kinship with the sovereign. This is also roughly the order of decreasing frequency in which these cases occurred, for natural reasons. It follows that, since these rules are customary and can therefore be ascertained mainly through actual practice, the fewer instances of a particular case, the less of a basis to infer what the rule was for that case. In other words, these conclusions are also listed in decreasing degree of certainty.\n\nThe letters patent of 1864 and 1917\n\nGenesis\n\nTo be completed.\n\nEffects\n\nThe letters patent of 1864 and 1917 are the two main general dispositions concerning styles and titles in the royal family. They are, however, of a different nature:\n\nthe letters patent of 1864 have the effect of\n\nconfirming, and making explicit, what was hitherto a century-old custom, namely, giving the style of \"Royal Highness\" to the children of a sovereign and to the children of sons of a sovereign.\n\nIt said nothing about the title of prince, except to implicitly confirm that the same people received it.\n\nIt also said nothing, either positive or negative, about usage for other individuals. However, subsequent letters patent (1867, 1886, 1905) refer in their preamble to the letters of 1864 as \"defining and limiting\" the style of Royal Highness.\n\nthe letters patent of 1917 have the effect of\n\nconfirming the dispositions of the letters of 1864,\n\nrestricting the dispositions of the letters of 1898 to the eldest living son of the eldest son of the prince of Wales (although these letters are not cited in the preamble), and\n\ndenying the title of prince and the styles of royal highness, highness or serene highness to anyone else, except those already granted by letters patent and remaining unrevoked\n\nThus, the letters of 1864 granted or confirmed certain styles for certain people without explicitly confirming or denying them for the rest, while the letters of 1917 explicitly deny the styles to those who are not explicitly entitled to them. The letters of 1917 are thus much more complete and precise.\n\nSince the letters of 1917 denied certain styles to certain people, what happened to those who already had them at the time they were passed? Many of these titles had been granted by royal warrant rather than letters patent, but it is doubtful that the distinction is meaningful here. The last holder of a British style of Highness died in 2005.\n\nPrince of what?\n\nWhen we speak of the title of Prince, is there a territorial designation attached to it? Not necessarily. Actual practice shows little consistency in the matter.\n\nWhile the expression \"prince of Great Britain\" appears under the Hanoverians (e.g., the styles of the prince of Wales in 1714, 1729, 1751) and that of \"Prince of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\" under Victoria and George V (e.g., the styles of the prince of Wales in 1841 and 1911), the only formal grant of the style prior to 1914 (in 1905) does not specify any territorial designation. That of 1914 (for the children of the duke and duchess of Brunswick) adds a territorial designation (\"of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\") to an existing title of prince, whereas their father and aunts had been declared \"born prince/ss of Great Britain and Ireland\" before. The 2nd duke of Albany is called \"born prince of Great Britain and Ireland\" in the consent to his marriage. Princess Frederica of Hanover is called \"princess of Great Britain and Ireland\", while the members of the next generation of Cumberlands (1900-13) are called \"born prince(ss) of Great Britain and Ireland\".. But Ernst August, in 1951, is called \"prince of Great Britain\".\n\nThe letters patent of November 1917, which grant the title of prince explicitly to children of a sovereign and children of sons of a sovereign, specify no territorial designation. The only formal grant posterior to 1917 (to the duke of Edinburgh in 1957) specifies \"of the United Kingdom\". It is now considered that the title of prince conferred by the letters patent of November 1917 is that of prince of the United Kingdom.\n\nPractice and Customs from 1660 to 1917\n\nThe Stuarts\n\nThe only interesting cases are\n\nthe children of the duke of York, nephews and nieces of Charles II, before the accession of their father as James II; and\n\nthe children of the Princess Anne of Denmark by her husband Prince George of Denmark, all of whom died before her accession as Queen Anne on March 8, 1702. Before 1688 they were grandchildren of the king (in female line), after 1688 they were nephews/nieces of the sovereign.\n\nInformation on their styles can be found in a couple sources:\n\ntheir \"deposita\", i.e., the inscriptions placed on their coffins at burial in Westminster Abbey (see more on the deposita of the British royal family).

He also had two brothers, Maximilian Wilhelm (1666-1726), who lived in Austria, and Ernst August (1674-1728) who was created duke of York on July 14, 1716 (n.s.). The duke of York was styled Highness.\n\nHis only son (the future George II) was created prince of Wales on Sep. 27, 1714 (o.s.). This prince of Wales had one son and three daughters when George I succeeded, and this was the first instance of a reigning sovereign with grandchildren in the male line since Edward III. However, these grandchildren were all children of a sovereign's eldest son.\n\nGeorge I's grandchildren were:\n\nFrederick Lewis (Jan 31 1707 n.s. -Mar 20 1751 n.s.), cr. duke of Edinburgh in 1726\n\nGeorge William (Nov 13 1717 n.s. - Feb 17 1718 n.s.)\n\nWilliam Augustus of Wales (Apr 26 1721n.s. - Oct 31 1765), cr. duke of Cumberland in 1726, who never married;\n\nAnne (Feb 11 1709-Jan 12 1759), created Princess Royal on Aug 30, 1727, who married the prince of Orange in 1734;\n\nAmelia (Jul 10 1711- Oct 31 1786);\n\nCaroline Elizabeth (1713-Dec 28 1757);\n\nMary (Mar 5 1723 n.s. - Jan 14 1772) who married the future landgrave of Hesse-Cassel in 1740;\n\nLouisa (Dec 18 1724 n.s. - Dec 19 1751 n.s.) who married the future king of Denmark in 1743.\n\nDuring the reign of George I, it appears that royal grandchildren, even children of the Prince of Wales, were styled princes and princesses but received the attribute of \"Highness\" rather than \"Royal Highness\". See for example the gazetting of the creation of his two grandsons as dukes on July 15/26, 1726 (London Gazette 6494): \"His Majesty has been pleased to create his Highness Prince Frederick, a Baron, Viscount, Earl, Marquess, and Duke of the Kingdom of Great Britain, by the Names Stiles and Titles of Baron of Snaudon in the County of Caernarvon, Viscount of Lanceston in the County of Cornwall, Earl of Eltham in the County of Kent, Marquess of the Isle of Wight and Duke of Edinburgh. His Majesty has been pleased to create his Highness Prince William, a Baron, Viscount, Earl, Marquess, and Duke of the Kingdom of Great Britain, by the Names Stiles and Titles of Baron of the Isle of Alderney, Viscount of Trematon in the County of Cornwall, Earl of Kinnington in the county of Surrey, Marquess of Berkhamstead in the County of Hertford, and Duke of Cumberland.\" Garter's memorandum states that George William was buried with the style of Highness.\n\nA statement of the current practice appears in Chamberlayne's Magnae Britanniae Notitia (e.g., 1726 edition, p. 61): \"The daughters of England are stiled Princesses, the Eldest of which to violate unmarried is High-Treason at this Day. To all the King's children belong the Title of Royal Highness [...] All the King's Sons, Grandsons, Brothers, Uncles, and Nephews of the King, are by Stat. 3 Hen VIII to precede other in England. it is true, the Word Grandson is not there in terminis, but it is understood (as Sir Edward Coke holds) by Nephew, which in Latin being Nepos, signifies also, and chiefly, a Grandson.\"\n\nAn example of the styles of the Royal Family can be found in An Exact List of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, 1719. The list of members of the House of Lords begins as follows :\n\nHis Royal Highness George Augustus (Prince of Great Britain, Electoral Prince of Brunswick-Lunenburgh, Duke of Cornwall and Rothesaye, Duke and Marquis of Cambridge, Earl of Milford-Haven, and of Carreck, Viscount Northallerton, Baron of Tewkesbury, and of Renfrew, Lord of the Isles, and Steward of Scotland, and Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Garter,) Prince of Wales, and Earl of Chester. P.C.\n\nHis Royal Highness Earnest Augustus (Prince of Brunswick-Lunenburgh, Bishop of Osnabrugh), Duke of York and Albany, and Earl of Ulster.\n\nHis Highness Prince Frederick (eldest son of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales) Duke of Gloucester.\n\nOther examples of contemporary usage (although less authoritative): Basil Kennett's Romae antiquae notitia (London, 1726) is dedicated to \"His Highness the duke of Gloucester\", Saint John Fisher's Practical discourse upon private prayer (London, 1719) is dedicated to \"His Highness Princess Anne.\" On the other hand, the Historical Register (1717, p. 90; 1727, p. 55) uses the phrase \"His Royal Highness Prince Frederick\", but this seems to be an exception.\n\nGeorge II\n\nWhen George II acceded in 1727 none of his children were not married, but in the course of his reign he would see nine grandchildren, all born to his son Frederick Lewis prince of Wales:\n\nGeorge William Frederick (June 4 1738 n.s. - Jan 29 1820), later George III\n\nEdward Augustus, Duke of York and Albany (Mar 25 1739 n.s.- Sep 17 1767)\n\nWilliam Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh (Nov 25 1743 n.s.- Aug 25 1805)\n\nHenry Frederick, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn (Nov 7 1745 n.s.- Sep 18 1790)\n\nFrederick William (May 24 1750 n.s. - Dec 29 1765)\n\nAugusta (Dec 8 1737 n.s. - Mar 23 1813), married the hereditary prince (later duke) of Brunswick in 1764\n\none of her daughters, Caroline, married in 1795 the Prince of Wales\n\nElizabeth Caroline (Jan 10 1741 n.s. - Sep 4 1759)\n\nLouisa Anne (Mar 19 1749-May 13 1768)\n\nCaroline Matilda (Jul 22 1751n.s. - May 10 1775), married the king of Denmark in 1766\n\nOf these, the only one to have any issue was the duke of Gloucester, who had William Frederick, later 2nd duke of Gloucester, and Sophia Mathilda. As the first great-grandchildren of a sovereign in male line they will be examined in detail below.\n\nOnce again, from 1738 there were grandchildren of the sovereign in male line, but they were all children of the Prince of Wales. But, contrary to the preceding reign, it appears that these grandchildren were styled royal highnesses, although the daughters were not Princesses. This was a decision of the Prince of Wales, according to Garter's memorandum. For further evidence, see the announcement of the creation of Edward Augustus as duke of York and Albany: \"Whitehall, April 1. The King has been pleased to grant unto His Majesty's dearly beloved Grandson Prince Edward Augustus, and to the Heirs Male of his Royal Highness, the Dignities of Duke of the Kingdom of Great Britain, and of Earl of the Kingdom of Ireland, by the Names, Stiles and Titles of Duke of York and of Albany in the said Kingdom of Great Britain, and of Earl of Ulster in the said Kingdom of Ireland\" (London Gazette 9981, March 29, 1760). See likewise the entry in the register of burials at St. Peter's, Westminster (Harleian Society Publications, vol. 10, p. 395): \"Her Royal Highness Princess Elizabeth Caroline, 2d daughter of his late Royal Highness Frederick Prince of Wales\".\n\nGeorge III\n\nGeorge III acceded in 1760, unmarried. His brothers were sons of an eldest son of king. He married in 1761 and had a number of children, including the following sons:\n\nGeorge Augustus Frederick, prince of Wales, later George IV (1762-1830)\n\nCharlotte (1796-1817)\n\n~ 1816 Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha\n\nFrederick Augustus, duke of York (1763-1827), married without issue\n\nWilliam Henry, duke of Clarence (1765-1837), later William IV\n\ntwo daughters who died in infancy\n\nEdward Augustus, duke of Kent (1767-1820)\n\nQueen Victoria\n\nErnest Augustus, duke of Cumberland (1771-1851), later Ernst August I of Hanover\n\none son\n\nfurther issue (see below)\n\nAugustus Frederick, duke of Sussex (1773-1843)\n\nAdolphus Frederick, duke of Cambridge (1774-1850)\n\nGeorge, 2nd duke of Cambridge (1819-1904)\n\nAugusta (1822-1916)\n\n~ 1843 grand-duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz\n\nMary Adelaide (1833-1897)\n\n~ 1866 Francis, duke of Teck [H 1887]\n\nGeorge III had many sons, but few grandchildren in male line: two grandsons and three granddaughters. Of his sons, the duke of York married in 1791 but had no issue, the prince of Wales married in 1795 and had only one daughter, princess Charlotte; the duke of Cumberland married in 1815 and his only son Georg was born in Berlin in May 1819, seven months before the death of George III. Sussex married in contravention to the Royal Marriages Act. The dukes of Clarence, Kent, and Cambridge all married in 1818, in a rush to produce heirs after the untimely death of Charlotte of Wales. Kent had one daughter who became Queen Victoria. Clarence had two daughters who died in infancy. Only the duke of Cambridge produced a son, born in Hanover in March 1819, a few months before the death of George III. Cambridge also had two daughters, one of whom married the grand-duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in 1843. The other, Princess Mary Adelaide, was since1843 the only unmarried British princess other than Queen Victoria's daughters. She was finally married in 1866 to the 1st duke of Teck, who was created a Highness in 1887 and took up residence in Britain. Their eldest son the 2nd duke of Teck was created a Highness in 1911.\n\nGeorge III's grandchildren, even after his death (whereby they became nephews and nieces of the sovereign) were styled Highness: examples include the announcement of the death of Princess Elizabeth, daughter of the duke of Clarence, in 1821; the act in 1825 providing an annual sum for the support of Prince George Frederic of Cumberland, the act of the same year providing a sum for the support of Princess Alexandrina Victoria of Kent (later Queen Victoria).\n\nAfter 1830, however, the grandchildren of George III were styled Royal Highness. This began at the funeral of George IV, where Prince George of Cambridge was so styled by command of the new king. Likewise, the Act of the same year providing for a regency in case Victoria should accede as a minor styles her Royal Highness. At the election of Princes George of Cambridge and George Frederic of Cumberland to the Order of the Garter in 1835, the king again directed that they be so styled. Queen Victoria continued this custom, as appears from two acts (6& 7 Vict c 25 and 13 & 14 Vic cap 7) concerning George and Mary of Cambridge. It was her desire to formally extend the style to grandchildren of the sovereign in male line that led to the Letters Patent of 1864 (see C. B. Phipps' letter to the Lord Chancellor of Jan 21, 1864, in National Archives, HO 45/8933/2: \"The Queen is quite decided as to the propriety of extending the title of Royal Highness to all grandchildren, being the children of sons of a Sovereign.\")\n\nThe next generation in male line is even sparser, since the second duke of Cambridge, grandson of George III, married in contravention to the Royal Marriages Act and died in 1904. George III's only other grandson in male line, the duke of Cumberland, had male issue that continues to this day. As it is the second instance of great-grandchildren of a sovereign in male line it will be examined below.\n\nOf the daughters of George III:\n\nCharlotte Augusta Matilda (1766-1828), Princess Royal, married in 1797 the hereditary prince (later duke, still later king) of Wurttemberg\n\nAugusta Sophia (1768-1840) never married\n\nElizabeth (1770-1840) married in 1818 the landgrave of Hesse-Homburg\n\nMary (1776-1857) married in 1816 her cousin the 2nd duke of Gloucester, who was created HRH on that occasion; they had no issue\n\nSophia (1777-1848) never married\n\nAmelia (1783-1810) never married\n\nso there were no grandchildren of George III in female line who resided in the UK.\n\nThe 2nd Duke of Gloucester\n\nThe only grandson of George I in male line to have any issue (aside from George III) was William Henry (Nov 14/25, 1743 - Aug 25, 1805). He was created duke of Gloucester on Nov. 17 or 19, 1764. About that time, he fell in love with Maria Waldegrave (1736-1807), widow of the 2nd earl Waldegrave. She was the daughter of Sir Edward Walpole (a younger son of the Prime Minister) and Dorothy Clement or Clements, who were not married. She was thus not only of relatively modest origin (certainly not royal), but also a bastard child. Her family connections nevertheless let her enter society and marry rather successfully the earl Waldegrave, who had been lord of the bedchamber of George II and governor of the future George III. He died of smallpox in 1763 and left her widowed with three daughters. Prince William Henry married her secretly on Sept. 6, 1766. But he did not reveal the marriage; instead, she took the role of official mistress, and even received a pension from George III on the Irish revenues. But, after the duke of Cumberland's marriage became public in 1771, Gloucester revealed his own to his brother in 1772. George III ordered an inquiry into the validity of the marriage, which was certified as valid a few days before the birth of their first child, Sophia Mathilda, on May 29, 1773. Two other children followed: Caroline Augusta Maria (June 24 1774- March 1775) and William Frederick on Jan 15, 1776 in Rome. By 1777 George III and his brother were reconciled and legislation to provide for the family was passed in 1778 (18 Geo III c. 31). In the act, the two surviving children of the duke of Gloucester are called \"his Highness Prince William Frederick, the son of his said Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester\" and his sister \"her Highness Princess Sophia Matilda, the daughter of his said Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester\".\n\nThe marriages of Cumberland and Gloucester prompted the passage of the Royal Marriages Act in 1776, which for the first time placed restrictions on princes' ability to marry without consent. But, as the marriages had taken place before and were technically valid in English law, there was no way to deny the issue their status in the British royal family. Matters were different in Hanover, where rules about unequal marriages certainly precluded the marriage of a Hanoverian dynast with the illegitimate daughter of a member of the gentry from being admitted as valid for succession purposes. Gloucester's marriage was unequal, and his issue was in principle excluded from the dynasty. In fact, the duke of Gloucesters's two children were not listed in the genealogical listing of the electoral house of Hanover in the Königlicher Groß-Britannischer und Kurfürstlicher Braunschweig-Lüneburgscher Staats-Kalender, although he was. Hermann Schulze (Hausgesetze, vol. 1, p. 408) states that William Frederick was treated in Germany as a British prince but not as an agnate of the house of Brunswick, and cites Carl Friedrich Häberlin: Staats-Archiv, vol. 1 [1796], p. 91 and Karl Friedrich Eichhorn: Über die Ehe des Herzogs von Sussexp. 170. He also notes the significant fact that the William Frederick, as 2nd duke of Gloucester, was not invited to sign the family compact of the house of Brunswick-Luneburg in 1831 when all other agnates residing in Britain did so. Since family compacts needed the consent of all agnates, this is clear evidence that William Frederick was not considered an agnate of the house of Brunswick-Luneburg.\n\nIn Britain, the children of the 1st duke of Gloucester were consistently given the rank of prince and the style of Highness:\n\nAnnual Register 1789, p. 250;\n\nLondon Gazette13685, Jul. 15, 1794, p. 728, account of his election as Knight of the Garter: \"Prince William Frederick (now out of the Kingdom), son of his Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester\";\n\nAnnual Register 1794, p. 323, Chron. p. 68;\n\nGentleman's Magazine 1794 i. 375;\n\nLondon Gazette13755 Feb. 24, 1795, p. 187: \"His Highness Prince William, of the 115th Foot, to be major-general in the army\").\n\nCourt and City Register 1795, p. 144: \"His Highness Prince William of Gloucester\";\n\nAnnual Register 1799 chron. appendix p. 145;\n\nAnnual Register 1806 Chron. p. 173;\n\nJournal of the House of Lords (1806): account of his reception when he succeeded his father: \"His Highness the Duke of Gloucester\"\n\nA few exceptions: the Annual Register on his admission to the degree of MA at Cambridge in 1790 (p. 210): \"his royal highness prince William Frederick\".\n\nA brief account of the 2nd duke of Gloucester's unremarkable career:\n\nMA Canta 1790, LLD 1796, chancellor of the university Mar 26, 1811, installed June 29.

Ranger of Bagshot Walk 1798, governor Portsmouth 1827.\n\nWilliam Frederick (1776-1834), the 2nd duke of Gloucester, as only male agnate in Britain aside from the brothers of George III, was long kept in reserve while Princess Charlotte, only daughter of the Prince Regent and heir presumptive, decided whom to marry. Her marriage to prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha allowed the duke to marry his long-time love, George III's daughter Mary (1776-1857), on July 22, 1816. According to the Complete Peerage (vol. 5, p. 745) \"The style of 'Royal Highness' was not, however, allowed to him till 22 July 1816, he being (though nephew and son-in-law of the then King) only great-grandson (not grandson) of a King of England\". His sister received the same style the next day. The Complete Peerage does not provide any source for this (perhaps a warrant is registered at the College of Arms?).\n\nThe dukes of Cumberland\n\nThe second instance of a great-grandson of a sovereign in male line came with the dukes of Cumberland. They were even more remote from the sovereign than the Gloucesters, since the 2nd duke of Gloucester was a great-grandson of George II but also a nephew of George III.\n\nHere is the line of the dukes of Cumberland to the 5th generation in male line from George III:\n\nGeorge III\n\nErnst August I (1771-1851), duke of Cumberland, king of Hanover 1837\n\nGeorg V (1819-78) king of Hanover 1851-66, 2nd duke of Cumberland\n\nErnst August (1845-1923), 3d duke of Cumberland 1878-1919\n\n~ 1878 Thyra of Denmark\n\nMarie Louise (1879-1948)\n\n~ 1900 Maximilian prince of Baden\n\nGeorg Wilhelm (1880-1912)\n\nAlexandra (1882-1963)\n\n~ 1904 Friedrich Franz grand-duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin\n\nOlga (1884-1958)\n\nChristian Friedrich (1885-1901)\n\nErnst August (1887-1953), duke of Brunswick 1913-18\n\n~ 1913 Viktoria Luise of Prussia\n\nErnst August (1914-87)\n\n~ 1951\n\nfurther issue\n\nGeorg Wilhelm (1915-2005)\n\nfurther issue\n\nFriederike Luise (1917-81)\n\n~ 1937 king Paul of the Hellenes\n\nChristian (1919-81)\n\nfurther issue\n\nWelf Heinrich (1923-97)\n\nFrederica (1848-1926)\n\n~1880 Alfons von Pawel Ra(m)mingen\n\nMarie Ernestine (1849-1904)\n\nGeorge III's son Ernest Augustus, duke of Cumberland (1771-1851) succeeded William IV as king of Hanover in 1837. His son Georg V, who was born in Great Britain and blinded in an accident in 1833, succeeded him in 1851 but was dispossessed during the war of 1866 by Prussia. He moved to Gmunden, in Austria, and always refused to accept the annexation of his kingdom by Prussia. He died in Paris on June 12,1878, and was buried on June 23 in St. George's Chapel, Windsor. Interestingly, the Court Circular styles him \"His late Majesty King George of Hanover, his Royal Highness the duke of Cumberland, K.G., First Cousin of Her Majesty the Queen, General in her Majesty's Army\", thus allowing him a (British) style of Royal Highness distinct from his (Hanoverian) style of Majesty.\n\nGeorge V's son Ernst August succeeded him at the head of the house of Hanover.\n\nAt the time [July 11 according to Allemagne Dynastique 3:185, July 10 according to other sources], he sent a letter to the the king of Prussia (translation from the Times, Feb 3, 1879, p. 3D):\n\n\"Most illustrious, most potent Prince, dearest Brother and Cousin:\n\nWith a deeply-troubled heart I fulfil the sad duty of announcing to you that it has pleased God in His unsearchable counsels to summon away from this life my much-loved father His Majesty King George V., King of Hanover, Prince Royal of Great Britain and Ireland, Duke of Cumberland, Duke of Brunswick and Luneburg, etc., who died at Paris on the 12th of June this year, after long sufferings. \"In consequence of this stroke of death , involving great tribulation to me and my House, all rights, prerogatives, and titles which appertained to the King, my father, above all, and more particularly, with respect to the kingdom of Hanover have now passed to me in virtue of the law in my House regulating succession to the throne. All these rights, prerogatives, and titles do I maintain in their fulness and entirety. As, however, the exercise of the same with regard to the kingdom of Hanover is impeded by restrictions which, of course, are not legally binding on me, I have resolved, pending the duration of these obstacles, to bear the title of 'Duke of Cumberland, Duke of Brunswick and Luneburg' with the prefix 'Royal Highness.'\n\nWhile, moreover, making this communication I do not deem it necessary to intimate that the full and independent rights of me and my House can inno wise be abolished or restricted by the temporary non-use of the titles and dignities denoting the same.\n\nI remain your Majesty's well-wisher, brother, and cousin.\n\nErnst August\n\nTo His Majesty the King of Prussia\n\nGmund, July 1878\"\n\nThis assertion of his rights (and explicit refusal to recognize the German Empire of 1871) precluded any settlement of the remaining Hanover issues, but also would block him from succeeding to the duchy of Brunswick, to which he was the heir presumptive. The declaration also meant that the family, for the time being, was not using any title related to the former kingdom of Hanover (in particular, that of prince or princess of Hanover); the family resumed the use of these titles on Aug 29, 1931 (Allemagne Dynastique 3:199).\n\nThe duke of Cumberland was made a knight of the Garter on June 24, 1878 (dispensation on July 20, 1878): in the London Gazette announcement he is styled \"His Royal Highness Ernest Augustus William Adolphus George Frederick of Hanover, duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale\". At that point, according to Ann Lyon ('A Reaction to Popular Hysteria: The Titles Deprivation Act 1917.' Liverpool Law Review (2000) 22:173-203), his position was considered and \"The then Garter, Sir Albert Woods, had been of the view that 'the Princely title ceases with the grandchildren of the Sovereign' but admitted that no precedent could be quoted\". In the royal consent given to his marriage on Sept. 27, 1878, he is styled \"Our Dear Cousin His Royal Highness The Prince Ernest Augustus WIlliam Adolphus George Frederick Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale, Earl of Armagh, Knight of Our Most Noble Order of the Garter\" (PRO HO 124/18). On Dec. 21 of the same year he married Thyra, daughter of king Christian IX of Denmark and sister of the princess of Wales, the result of a negotiation that had begun while Georg V was still alive.\n\nWhatever the doubts about his status as prince, they were resolved two years later, when his sister Frederica married at Windsor on Apr 24, 1880 Alphonse, baron von Pawel-Rammingen, former court official of her father and settled in Britain (they had one child who died in infancy and was buried at Windsor). She is styled \"Our Dear Cousin Her Royal Highness The Princess Frederica Sophia Maria Henrietta Amelia Theresa of Hanover, Princess of Great Britain and Ireland \" in the instrument passed under the Great Seal signifying the Queen's consent to the marriage (PRO HO 124/19). It is known that she used the arms of England and the coronet of a niece of the sovereign (Fox-Davies 1909, p. 365, who asks for a warrant to settle the question of what coronet she should be entitled to as great-grandchild of a sovereign not being a niece of a sovereign).\n\nErnst August of Hannover (1887-1953), great-great-grandson of George III (but also first cousin of George V through his mother) and duke of Brunswick, is described as \"born prince of Great Britain and Ireland\" by George V in the instrument signifying royal consent to the marriage in 1913; likewise his sister Princess Alexandra is styled \"born princess of Great Britain and Ireland\" (PRO C 188/2; see also the London Gazette).\n\nThe titles of the Cumberlands came under scrutiny during World War I, when it was debated what British titles and styles they had, whether they could and should be removed, and how. Sir Alfred Scott-Gatty, Garter King of Arms, reported to Lord Sanderson, a member of the Select Committee considering the Bill, on 24th April 1917 (Lyon, op. cit.): he \"seems inclined to have believed the Duke of Cumberland to be a holder of royal titles\". He cited the 1913 marriage consent and said that it was hard to see how the Duke of Brunswick could have been \"born Prince of of Great Britain and Ireland\" other than through his father.\n\nAt the time of the birth of the duke and duchess of Brunswick's first son in March 1914, a note in the Times (March 19, 1914) read: \"The British Councillor of Embassy here [Berlin], Sir Horace Rumbold, is staying at Brunswick to certify the birth of a Prince of Great Britain and Ireland.\" Here is Sir Horace Rumbold's interesting account of the event:\n\n\"The Duchess of Brunswick, the Emperor's only daughter, was expecting her confinement in the first half of March, and, although the Duke was one of the German Federal Prince, he wished, as the Duke of Cumberland's son, to be also considered as an English Prince. Her therefore intimated that he would be glad if my Chief [Sir E. Goschen] would go to Brunswick and be present in the Palace at the birth of his child, on the analogy of the presence of the Home Secretary at the birth of a child of an English Sovereign. Sir E. Goschen, not being well, instructed me to go to Brunswick in his place. I went there accordingly on March 8 [...] On the seventh day of my stay, I received a message from the Duchess, conveyed, of course, quite privately, to the effect that I should have to wait on some time longer, as the doctor had deveidently made a mistake about the date of the confinement. [...] I asked the Duke, after consulting the Minister, for leave to return to Berlin. This was at once granted on the understanding that I would come back to Brunswick as soon as I was sent for. Early in the morning of March 18 I was rung up from Brunswick by the Chamberlain and asked to return there at once, as the Duchess had just given birth to a boy. I caught the first available train and reached Brunswick at 11 a.m. Flags were flying throughout the State in honour of the birth of an heir to the throne. On reaching the Palace, I was taken to a room in which were the Duke, the Minister of State and the doctor, who had not been allowed to leave the building pending my arrival. We went up to the nursery, where we inspected the newly born infant, andwhere the Minister of State and the doctor certified that it was the very child which had been born five or six hours earlier. An elaborate luncheon, washed down by the finest Rhine wine, completed the proceedings as far as I was concerned, and I then returned to Berlin.\"\n\nSir Horace Rumbold: The War Crisis in Berlin, July-August 1914.

But the consent given to the marriage of Ernst August (1914-87) with Ortrud of Schleswig-Holstein on Aug 1, 1951 styles him \"His Royal Highness Prince Ernest Augustus George William Christian Louis Francis Joseph Nicholas Oscar of Hanover, born Prince of Great Britain, Duke of Brunswick-Luneburg\" (PRO HO 124/49). The consent given to him for his second marriage on June 10, 1981 (Gazette 48638) styles them \"His Royal Highness Prince Ernst August Georg of Brunswick-Luneburg\". His son Ernst August (b. 1954) received consent to his (first) marriage the same day under the style \"His Royal Highness Prince Ernst August Albert of Hanover\". Ernst August's younger brother Ludwig (1955-88) was given consent in 1987 as \"His Royal Highness Prince Ludwig Rudolph Georg Wilhelm Philipp Friedrich Wolrad Maximilian of Hanover\" (Gazette 51069).\n\nThe case of Attorney-General v HRH Prince Ernest Augustus of Hanover:\n\nThis case is not germane to the subject but I mention it because of its antiquarian interest. In the early 1950s Prince Ernst August of Hanover petitioned for British citizenship on the basis of the Act of 1705 which naturalized all descendants of the Electress Sophia. The statute had been completely forgotten until the 1930s. Lower courts accepted the British government's position that its clauses should be ignored because applying them in the present time would go far beyond the intent of the drafters and produce ridiculous results, but the House of Lords sided with the plaintiff and affirmed that the Act was still in force.\n\nLegal references:\n\n[1955] 1 All ER 746 = [1955] Ch 440\n\n[1955] 3 All ER 647 = [1956] Ch 188\n\n[1957] 1 All ER 49 = [1957] AC 436\n\nIt was customary to naturalize husbands (and also sometimes wives) of members of the British Royal Family.

Prince Ernst August was born before the letters patent of 1914 which declared that his designation should be \"Prince of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\" Thus, if he was a \"born Prince of Great Britain\", it was not by virtue of the letters patent of 1914. This style is certainly consistent with the custom that prevailed until 1917, but one wonders why the style of Prince to which he was entitled by custom at birth was not revoked by the letters patent of 1917, and why the style that undoubtedly belonged to him (the letters patent of 1914 being unrevoked) was not used instead.\n\nQueen Victoria\n\nQueen Victoria was the first British sovereign to see the birth of a great-grandchild.\n\nAlbert Edward, Prince of Wales (1841-1910) later Edward VII\n\n~ Alexandra of Denmark\n\nAlbert Victor, duke of Clarence and Avondale (1864-92)\n\nGeorge, duke of York (1864-1936), later Prince of Wales, later George V\n\n~ Mary of Teck\n\nEdward of York (1894-1972), later Prince of Wales 1910, later Edward VIII (1936)\n\nAlbert of York (1895-1932), later duke of York , later George VI\n\nHenry of York (1900-1972), duke of Gloucester 1928\n\nGeorge of York (1902-42), duke of Kent 19??\n\nJohn of Wales (1905-19)\n\nMary of York (1895-1965), later Princess Royal, viscountess Lascelles 1922, countess of Harewood 1929\n\nLouise of Wales (1867-1931), duchess of Fife 1889, Princess Royal 1905\n\n~ 1889 Alexander Duff, cr duke of Fife 1889 (1849-1912)\n\nAlexandra (1891-1959), [H 1905] duchess of Fife 1912\n\n~ 1913 Arthur, Prince of Connaught\n\nMaud (1893-1945) [H 1905]\n\nVictoria of Wales (1868-1935)\n\nMaud of Wales (1869-1938), Princess Carl of Denmark 1895, queen of Norway 1905\n\nAlfred, duke of Edinburgh (1844-1900), duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha 1893\n\nAlfred (1874-99)\n\nMarie\n\nVictoria Melita\n\nAlexandra\n\nBeatrice\n\nArthur, duke of Connaught and Strathearn (1850-1942)\n\nArthur (1883-1938)\n\nAlastair Arthur (1914-43), 2nd duke of Connaught\n\nMargaret (1882-1920), Crown Princess of Sweden 1905\n\nPatricia (1886-1974), Lady Patricia Ramsay 1919\n\n~ 1919 Sir Alexander Ramsay\n\nAlexander Ramsay (1919-2000)\n\nLeopold, duke of Albany (1853-84)\n\nCharles Edward (1884-1954), duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha 1900-1918\n\nJohann Leopold (1906-72)\n\nHubertus (1909-43)\n\nFriedrich Josias (1918-98)\n\nSibylla (1917-72)\n\nCaroline Mathilde (1912-83)\n\nAlice (1883-1981), Princess Alexander of Teck 1904, countess of Athlone 1917\n\nVictoria (1840-1901), Princess Royal, Crown Princess of Prussia 1858, Crown Princess of Germany 1871, Empress 1888, \"Empress Frederick\" 1888\n\nAlice (1843-78), princess of Hesse 1862, grand-duchess of Hesse 1877\n\n~ 1862 Prince Louis of Hesse [RH 1862]\n\nHelena (1846-1923), Princess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein 1866, Princess Christian (?) 1917\n\n~ 1866 Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein [RH 1866]\n\nChristian Victor (1867-1900)\n\nAlbert (1869-1931)\n\nHelena Victoria (1870-1948) [H 1917]\n\nLouise Marie (1872-1956) [H 1917]\n\nLouise (1848-1939), marchioness of Lorne 1871, duchess of Argyll 1900\n\n~ 1871 John, duke of Argyll (1845-1914)\n\nBeatrice (1857-1944), Princess Henry of Battenberg 1885\n\n~ 1885 Prince Henry of Battenberg [RH 1885]\n\nAlexander (1886-1960), [H 1886] marquess of Carisbrooke 1917\n\nLeopold (1889-1922) [H 1886]\n\nMaurice (1891-1914) [H 1886]\n\nVictoria Eugénie Julia Ena [H 1886, RH 1906]\n\nThe great-grandchildren of Queen Victoria in male line were\n\nthe children of the duke of York (born between 1894 and 1905),\n\nAlastair Arthur, grandson of the 1st duke of Connaught (b. 1914), and\n\nthe children of Karl Eduard, reigning duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (born between 1906 and 1918).\n\nThe children of the duke of York between 1894 and 1898\n\nThe Letters Patent of May 28, 1898 granted the style of Royal Highness to \"the children of the eldest son of any Prince of Wales ... in addition to such titular dignity of Prince or Princess ... as they may otherwise possess\". The letters themselves did not grant the title of Prince (in fact, it explicitly doesn't do so by the use of the word \"otherwise\"). So the title of prince which these children undoubtedly had (Burke's Peerage for 1895 styles the only child of the duke of York \"Prince\") is customary as all others at the time.\n\nThe grant was made to \"the children of the eldest son of any Prince of Wales\". This was taken to apply to the children of the duke of York, second-born but eldest living son of the then Prince of Wales (future Edward VII). In 1901, these children became children of a son of the sovereign, and their style was now based on the letters patent of 1864. The letters patent were amended by those of Nov 30, 1917 (although they were not cited in their preamble), since the style of Royal Highness was now reserved to, among others, \"the eldest living son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales\". There are two differences: \"the eldest living son\", not \"the children\", and \"the Prince of Wales\" (i.e. the prince of Wales at any point in time), not \"any Prince of Wales\". Also, by specifying \"eldest living son\", the letters imply that \"eldest son\" means first-born. The letters patent of 1917 work differently from those of 1898: (1) Suppose a sovereign A whose eldest son B is Prince of Wales. He has two sons C and D. C dies, leaving no issue. D's eldest son would not be HRH, being son of the eldest-living son but not eldest son of the Prince of Wales. This was in fact the situation between 1894 and 1901. (2) Suppose that B dies, leaving C and D. C is created Prince of Wales, then has a son E: E (greatgrandchild of the sovereign) would not be HRH, being eldest son of the eldest son of \"a\" (late) Prince of Wales but not of \"the\" prince of Wales. This changes were recognized at the time the letters of 1917 were drafted, but as no one found a concise way to encompass the various possible situations, it was thought that such cases could be dealt with in an ad-hoc fashion.\n\nIt is interesting to note that an earlier draft of the letters patent contained the additional clause: \"and that the title of \"Highness\" shall be held and enjoyed by the other great grandchildren of the sovereign\". This explicit grant of the style of Highness was dropped, under circumstances I do not know.\n\nAlastair Arthur of Connaught\n\nAlastair Arthur was born in 1914, the son of Prince Arthur of Connaught (grandson of Queen Victoria) and Princess Alexandra, duchess of Fife (granddaughter of King Edward VII). He was the first great-grandson of Queen Victoria in male line to be born in the United Kingdom. His birth registration (see a copy here) designates him as a \"Prince\". Several contemporary references (Kelly's Handbook, Whitaker's Peerage) style him as prince. However, it appears that, as a result of the letters patent of 1917, he lost the style of Prince. Burke's Peerage (\"The Princes of Great Britain\", 1963 edition, pp xxvii-xxxii) considers this to be an injustice. He became 2nd duke of Connaught on the death of his grandfather in 1942 and died in 1943 without issue.\n\nKelly's Handbook to the Titled Landed and Official Classes lists \"HH Prince Alastair Arthur, b. 10 Aug 1914\" in its section on the royal family in the following editions:\n\n1915 ed., p. 26; 1916 ed., p. 23; 1917 ed., p. 23; 1918 ed., p. 25; 1919 ed., p. 25; 1920 ed., p. 26; 1921 ed., p. 26; 1922 ed., p. 26; 1923 ed., p. 31.\n\nWith the 1924 edition (p. 30) he becomes \"Alastair Arthur, Earl of Macduff\".\n\nWhitaker's Peerage, Baronetage, Knightage and Compagnionage lists \"Prince Alastair Arthur of Connaught, Earl of Macduff, b. 9th Aug. 1914\" in:\n\n1915 ed., p. 112; 1916 ed., p. 112; 1917 ed., p. 112; 1918 ed., p. 111; 1919 ed., p. 115; 1920 ed., p. 115; 1921 ed., p. 95; 1922 ed., p. 95; 1923 ed., p. 95.\n\nThe word \"Prince\" is removed from the entry in the 1924 ed., p. 96.\n\nThe only Burke's I have consulted so far is the 1921 ed., which has (p. 21) \"Alastair Arthur, Earl of Macduff, b. 9 Aug 1914\".\n\nSee also\n\nGerman and British Titles and Styles\n\nFrom 1714 to 1917, the ruling house of Great Britain used titles and styles that were both native (British) and foreign (German). From 1714 to 1901 the sovereigns were members of the house of Brunswick-Luneburg, and until 1837 combined the British crown with the electoral (1714 to 1814) or royal (1814 to 1837) crown of Hanover. In 1837 the British crown passed to Queen Victoria, who married in 1840 a German prince, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Her descendants until 1917 combined the titles and styles to which they were entitled as members of the ducal house of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, with those to which they were entitled as members of the royal house of the United Kingdom. All this ended with the proclamation of July 17, 1917.\n\nStyles of the Princes of Wales\n\nWhat follows are the styles of the heirs apparent between 1714 and the present as they appear in the letters patent creating them as Princes of Wales. For most I only have the gazetting of the letters patent, but in two instances (1841 and 1911) I have the full text of the letters patent. However, it seems likely that the styles as they are gazetted are taken directly from the letters patent."
