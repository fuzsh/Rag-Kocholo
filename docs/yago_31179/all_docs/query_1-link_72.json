        "text": "You have all no doubt been lying sleepless at night wondering about these two questions:\n\nHow did Viking Age Denmark look like in regards to the landscape?\n\nWhere would a Viking feel at home in modern Denmark, landscape wise?\n\nYou can now sleep soundly again, because here is the answer: https://jyllands-posten.dk/rejser/E...n-viking-foele-sig-hjemme-i-nutidens-danmark/\n\nLoose clusters of farms and very small hamlets, for safety and because most would have been related, with small fields surrounding the farms and hamlets in a bewildering pattern.\n\nAlready by the Viking Age the deep forests that covered DK from coast to coast during the Stone Age had long since been broken up by societies with an insatiable appetite for wood. And by the 1600s only 4 % was woodland and forest. (Today it's a little more than 20 %.)\n\nDuring the Viking Age crops was the main produce for farms, and really not much more than what an extended family needed as there were very few towns around. Protein mainly came from fowl and lots of fish.\n\nThe first town in the Danish realm was Hedeby, which was a center for slave trade BTW. That is today located in Germany.\n\nBut the first ethnic Danish town was Ribe, that was founded around 704. The town is still around, distinctly medieval and very charming. I can only recommend you come visiting should you ever come to DK. Especially in the early evening you will feel like you have gone back to an affluent merchant town anno 1870.\n\nBut back to the Viking Age around anno 1000. The loose cluster of small hamlets and farms was how Denmark had been looking for some 5.000 years. Albeit ever more of them and with the forest being cleared more and more. And that's how DK looked until the 1300's.\n\nThe climate changed slightly around that time and DK at the time had an extremely profitable export of salt herring going south, especially during Lent. But due to the climate changes DK changed from an agricultural country with crops feeding the population to cattle. Lots of cattle!\n\nSeveral times a year you would see large herds of cattle driven, or just as commonly, sailed south, flanked by cowboys - on foot.\n\nThese \"cowboys\" were all men, being away for several weeks at a time. Mainly because men took care of the fields and cattle (as well as fishing. Most hamlets and larger farms would have at least one fishing boat) while women looked after the pigs and poultry and as such it was women and teenage girls who drove the geese, ducks, milk-cows and pigs to town.\n\nDenmark was a cattle and herring country until well into the 1800's.\n\nToday you no doubt think that DK is a well-groomed country with rolling fields and meadows with grassing cows, interrupted by the odd wood. And you would be right - and wrong at the same time.\n\nSome 25 km from where I set right now, in our backyard, are herds of wild horses.\n\nhttps://app.box.com/s/flobtgncdxu1tr08lkt53rkf5pinhkas\n\nThe live in the national park Mols Mountains. - They are hardly the most impressive mountains in the world though.\n\nHere is a view from Mols Mountains. And just in the faint haze of the horizon to the far right is the village where I sit right now.\n\nhttps://app.box.com/s/m6zzh3wa91u4t7usjosi8y8obr1qcp6q\n\nWe have had wolves passing close by our village several times. But there have been few reports of wolves this year, so either they have been shot, become more careful or migrated back to Germany.\n\nhttps://bt.bmcdn.dk/media/cache/resolve/image_1240/image/1/19640/10954765-ulv.jpg\n\nSome 50 km to the east of where I sit are several hundred thousand red deer, breeding like they were paid for it!\n\nhttps://www.nordseeholidays.dk/medi...&width=1200&height=800&rnd=132192307169030000\n\nSome 25 km to the north are beavers, having a merry time chewing away. Not least in the general area of where my in-laws live.\n\nhttps://www.dn.dk/media/28676/baever.jpg\n\nhttps://images.jfmedier.dk/images/0...f6c4_2_90_0_0_4928_3280_1440_958_2a8dfa9c.jpg\n\nAlong the sparsely populated and touristed coastline north of here are quite a few nesting what we call King Eagles:\n\nhttps://asset.dr.dk/imagescaler01/h...822495481856_n.jpg&w=1200&675&scaleAfter=crop\n\nAnd Sea Eagles:\n\nhttps://nationalparkskjoldungernesland.dk/media/250356/havoern.jpg\n\nSo slowly DK, despite having a population of now 5.8 million, is reverting to the landscape we had in the Viking Age.\n\nSleep well.\n\nAs you probably know by now, Gorm the Old is officially considered the first king of Denmark and the first in the unbroken Danish line (albeit pretty twisted) of monarchs.\n\nBut we know of quite a few before Gorm the Old. And Denmark, or most of Denmark would have been united probably several times under some of these kings. Certainly united enough to undertake major national constructions, like the defensive wall of Dannevirke south of the current Danish/German border.\n\nSome of the names that are known for certain during the 700 and 800s are:\n\nAngantyr (Tyr was the God of War in the Nordic mythology. He only had one arm because the Fenris-wolf bit off his arm.)\n\nSigfred. (A common Germannic name. The Danes is a Germannic people and our language is Germannic.)\n\nHemming. (A Nordic name. Today the name if Henning.)\n\nHarald. (Very much a Nordic name and often used by kings or pretenders.)\n\nUffe. (A very common Nordic name, still a common name today.)\n\nGudfred. (Who according to the myth resided in the most peaceful and honest epoch in Danish history. You could drop a gold coin on the road on the way to the market and it would still lay there, when you returned. The name means God's Peace. And it's a nickname, just as Bluetooth and The Old.)\n\nHorik. (Also a common Nordic name. Not in use today though.)\n\nGnupa. (Probably and Old-Danish name.)\n\nHardeknud. (A common name for kings, or pretenders.)\n\nIcelandic sagas refer to Dan as the first king, because he was the one who led the Danes across from what is now Sweden, to what is now Denmark. And it's after him our country is named Danmark = Dan's land.\n\nThat at the time (and still is) was inhabited by Jutes, Angles and Cimbrians.\n\nBut Dan is a mythical king.\n\nWhat is certain though is that all of Denmark by the last half of the 900's was a united kingdom under one king and that's how it has remained - with a few minor hickups during the 1200's, where we had three kings, Svend, Knud and Valdemar - Valdemar ended up being the last man standing though. Knud got an axe in the head during a conference, and Svend was killed in battle."
