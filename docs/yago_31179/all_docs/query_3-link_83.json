        "text": "The event which attracted a record breaking entry and crowd saw Alister Laird, son Colin and his wife Izzy, of Blyth Holsteins, Blythbridge, West Linton, land the breed honours and overall champion of champions with Mag Pandor.\n\nThis fresh third calver was bought privately in Bordeaux, France, 14 months ago from Ferme Mag Holsteins and is part owned by Ferme Blondin who bought a share in this Walnutlawn Sidekick daughter after seeing her at UK Dairy Day where she stood reserve champion last year. Reserve at the Royal Highland and first at AgriScot, she classified VG89 as a second calver and since calving in the first week of February is now giving 60litres per day.\n\nReserve Holstein was Salvy Esquirido and Robbie Scott and family's Clydeview Sidekick Matilda, bred by Ewan and Emma Kennedy of the Clydeview herd from Perryston, Ayrshire. Originally purchased by Mr Esquirido, who bought her privately after she won the best individual cow in the West of Scotland Winter Herds competition earlier this year, he said: \"She's the best cow I've ever seen.\"\n\nAnother by Sidekick, Matilda calved her second on the first of January and is also giving 60litres per day.\n\nOut with the Holsteins, regular Dumfriesshire-based winner, Jonny Lochhead, won the top two awards amongst the Brown Swiss; Basil and Adam Lawson, North Cassingray, Largoward, Fife, won the British Friesian section and the Scottish-bred red and white, Nethervalley Awesome Rosanne Red, from Hefyn Wilson, topped its section.\n\nFor full report and pictures see next week's Scottish Farmer (23rd March 2024)"
