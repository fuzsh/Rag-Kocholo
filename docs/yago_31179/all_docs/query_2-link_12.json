Some of the details are corroborated by Adam of Bremen . In addition, the Annales Ryenses list numerous pre-8th century kings of Denmark whose existence must be considered mythical . The early 9th century Danish kings led the Viking expeditions which raided north-west Germany. This brought them into conflict with the Carolingian rulers who were extending their territorial control northwards, which accounts for the interest shown in their activities by contemporary Frankish sources. Their followers eventually settled in Friesland, where Godefrid was appointed duke in 882. During the first half of the 9th century, Denmark appears to have been a unified kingdom under a single ruler, but this unity quickly fell apart. The sources record continual disputes within the Danish ruling family, with frequent assassinations and changes of rulers. The family of the early Danish rulers can be reconstructed with reasonable certainty from the available sources, assuming that they accurately report the events and family relationships. However, during the second half of the 9th century the picture becomes much less clear. As will be seen in Chapter 1 of this document, little is known about some of the late 9th century kings beyond their names. We have even less information regarding the early 10th century kings. Even Adam of Bremen is obliged to admit that it is uncertain how many kings reigned in Denmark during this period .\n\nA clearer picture of Danish history emerges from the mid-10th century with the accession of King Gorm den Gamle/the Old. He and his descendants are shown in Chapter 2. Denmark started to extend its territorial influence under Gorm´s son King Harald I, who invaded Norway in 965 and imposed his nominee as regent for the Norwegian king. Harald´s son King Svend I started raiding England soon after his accession in [987], culminating in a full-scale invasion in 1013 when Svend succeeded in imposing himself as de facto ruler of the country. Svend´s son King Knud I defeated and killed the English king Edmund Ironsides and established himself as king of England in 1016.\n\nAfter the death in 1042 of Hardeknud, last known male descendant of King Gorm, Magnus II King of Norway invaded Denmark and conquered most of the country. Danish resistance was led by Svend Estridsen, the son of King Knud´s sister, who reasserted control of Denmark by 1047. His descendants ruled the country until 1412 (Chapter 3). In common with Sweden and Norway, the Danish throne then passed through the female line to the families of the dukes of Pomerania and the Wittelsbach dukes of Bavaria. The Danish kings between 1412 and 1448 are shown in outline form only in Chapter 4 of this document. From 1449, the Danish crown was united with the Norwegian when Christian Duke of Oldenburg was chosen as king of Denmark and Norway.\n\nThe main early sources which provide genealogical information relating to the kings of Denmark are:\n\n§ Adam of Bremen's Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiæ pontificum, completed in the 1070s, the history of northern Germany and Scandinavia from the time of Emperor Charlemagne. Later copies include additions by subsequent scholars.\n\n§ The Roskilde Chronicle (Chronicon Roskildense) , written between 1139 and 1143 by a clerk at Roskilde Cathedral, with a continuation covering the reign of King Valdemar I exists in three different manuscripts, the earliest dating from the late 13th century at Kiel, the early part mostly being derived from Adam of Bremen.\n\n§ Sveno's Brevis historia regum Dacie, written some time between 1185 and 1202 by a nephew of Archbishop Eskil, surviving in a text printed in 1642 and another later one, reconstituted text collated in 1915 by Gertz. This source has not yet been consulted.\n\n§ Saxo Grammaticus, who started writing his chronicle in [1185] and appears to have used all the earlier works, the last event described being King Valdemar II's expedition to Bremen in 1208. Saxo's work survives in different manuscripts but was not widely available until the first published edition in 1514, with additional parts discovered in later centuries. The first nine books are of little value from a genealogical point of view as they consist mainly of folkloric narratives of mythical or semi-legendary kings whose existence is rarely corroborated by other sources. The chronicle appears to be on firmer ground with books ten to sixteen, although it is difficult to assess the accuracy of specific points of detail given the flowing narrative style and nationalistic slant which is given to events.\n\n§ The Sagas, the question of whose reliability is discussed in the Introduction to the document NORWAY KINGS.\n\nChapter 1. KINGS of the DANES, 9th CENTURY\n\nEuropäische Stammtafeln sets out the outline genealogy of a family referred to as \"the Kings of Haithabu\". The first two generations are reproduced below, unchanged. The primary sources on which these two generations are based have not yet been identified, except as otherwise indicated below. The information in the later generations of the Europäische Stammtafeln chart is not completely supported by the information obtained from the primary sources so far consulted. It has therefore largely been ignored in the reconstruction of the later generations of the family. Considerable doubt persists about the precise relationships between the 9th century Danish rulers.\n\nThree brothers, one sister:\n\n1.SIGEFRID [Sigurd] ([750]-798). First \"King of Haithabu\". The Annales Fuldenses record that \"Sigifridi regis Danorum\" sent \"Halbdani cum sociis suis\" as missi to a council held by Charles I King of the Franks at \"Lippia\" . One child:\n\na)ONUND ([790]-).\n\n2.HARALD ([750]-killed in battle in the Irish Sea 804). Second \"King of Haithabu\". m IMHILD, daughter of WARNECHIN Graf von Engern & his wife Kunhilde von Rügen. Three children:\n\na)HALFDAN (-killed in battle Walcheren 810) . Third \"King of Haithabu\".\n\n- see below.\n\nb) HARALD ([775/80]-murdered Haithabu 804). Fourth \"King of Haithabu\".\n\nc)HOLGER ([780]-807). Danish.\n\n3. HALFDAN Mildi ([750]-802, bur Borro) . King of Vestfold.\n\n- see below.\n\n4.GEVA ([755]-) . This marriage is shown in Europäische Stammtafeln but the primary source on which it is based has not been identified. m ([775]) WIDUKIND Saxon Duke, son of --- (-7 Jan 810).\n\nHALFDAN \"Mildi\", son of --- ([750]-802, bur Borro) . King of Vestfold.\n\nm LIF of Westmare, daughter and heiress of DAG King of Westmare & his wife ---.\n\nKing Halfdan & his wife had [three] children:\n\n1. GODEFRID (-murdered 810) . Godefrid is shown in Europäische Stammtafeln as the son of King Halfdan, but the primary source on which this is based has not yet been identified. He succeeded as GODEFRID King of the Danes. King of Vestfold, Hedeland, Vaermland, Westmare and Hedemarken . The Annales Ryenses record that \"Karolus Imperator\" came with all his army against \"Godefrith regem Daciæ\" in 776 , although the dating would be questionable if this refers to the same King Godefrid. Adam of Bremen names \"rex Godafridus\" as the Danish leader against whom Emperor Charlemagne made war . The Royal Frankish Annals record that King Godefrid exchanged envoys with Emperor Charles in Schleswig in 804 . Einhard records a dispute between \"Drasconem ducem Abodritorum\" and \"Godelaibum alium ducem et cum eis filium fratris sui Reginoldum\", the latter being killed in 808 . Einhard records that \"Thrasco dux Abodritorum\" was killed by \"hominibus Godofridi\" in \"emporie Rerie\" in 809 . The Royal Frankish Annals also record that King Godefrid attacked the Obotrites in 808 and destroyed their commercial centre at Reria . He attacked the Frisians in 810 . Einhard records the death of \"Godefrido Danorum rege\" in 810 and the succession of \"Hemmingus filius fratris eius\" . The Annales Fuldenses record the death in 810 of \"Godafrido Danorum rege\", the succession by \"Hemmingus filius fratris eius\", and the latter making peace with the emperor . He was murdered by one of his retainers . King Godefrid had [four or more] children:\n\na) son (-killed in battle 814). He and his brothers were exiled to Sweden after the death of their father. They returned in 813 and expelled King Harald and King Reginfred . Einhard's Annales record that \"Harioldus et Reginfredus reges Danorum\" who, in the previous year had been expelled from Denmark by \"filiis Godofredi\", attacked again in 814 but \"Reginfridus et unus de filiis Godofredi qui maior natu erat\" were killed .\n\nb) son (-after 827). Joint King of the Danes 813. The Annales Fuldenses record that Emperor Louis sent a Frankish army to help \"Herioldo Danorum regi\" against \"filios Godafridi\" in 815 . They are their brothers were driven out in 819 by King Harald, with the help of Emperor Louis I \"le Pieux\" and the Obotrites .\n\nc) other sons (-after 819). Joint King of the Danes 813. The Annales Fuldenses record that Emperor Louis sent a Frankish army to help \"Herioldo Danorum regi\" against \"filios Godafridi\" in 815 . No source has so far been identified which names the sons of King Godefrid or states how many sons there were. They are their brothers were driven out in 819 by King Harald, with the help of Emperor Louis I \"le Pieux\" and the Obotrites .\n\n2. [SIGURD] (-killed in battle Bardowick 810). King Godefrid's brother is named Sigurd in Europäische Stammtafeln , but the primary source on which this is based has not yet been identified.\n\na) REGINOLD [Ragnvald] (-killed in battle 808). Einhard records a battle between \"Drasconem ducem Abodritorum\" and \"Godelaibum alium ducem et cum eis filium fratris sui Reginoldum\", the latter being killed in 808 . The Royal Frankish Annals name \"Reginold, his [King Godefred's] brother's son\" when recording that he was killed fighting the Obotrites . The Annales Fuldenses record the battle between \"Godafridus rex Danorum\" and the Abotrites in which \"Reginoldo filio fratris sui\" was killed .\n\nb) HEMMING (-812). The Gesta Francorum names \"Hemmingus filius fratris eius [=Godefrido Danorum rege]\" when recording that he succeeded his uncle in 810 . He succeeded his paternal uncle in 810 as HEMMING King of the Danes. Adam of Bremen names \"rex Godafridus\" as patruelis of Hemming on the latter's accession as Danish king . Einhard records the death of \"Godefrido Danorum rege\" in 810 and the succession of \"Hemmingus filius fratris eius\" . The Annales Fuldenses record the death in 810 of \"Godafrido Danorum rege\", the succession by \"Hemmingus filius fratris eius\", and the latter making peace with the emperor . He made peace with Emperor Charlemagne in 810, confirmed by a treaty signed at Heiligen on the river Eider in Spring 811 . Einhard's Annales name \"fratres Hemmingi, Hancwin et Angandeo, Osfred cognomento Turdimulo, et Warstein, et Suomi, et Urm, et alius Osfrid filius Heiligen, et Osfred de Sconsowe et Hebbi et Aowin\" as the Danish signatories of the peace agreed with the Franks in 811 . The Royal Frankish Annals record the death of King Hemming in 812 . Civil war broke out after King Hemming died. Einhard's Annales record that news of the death of \"Hemmingus Danorum rex\" arrived in 812, that \"Sigifridus nepos Godofredi regis et Anulo nepos Herioldi quondam regis\" both claimed the succession, and that the faction supporting \"Anulonis\" was victorious, with \"fratres eius Herioldum et Reginfredum\" being installed as kings . The Annales Fuldenses record the death in 812 of \"Hemmingo Danorum rege\", the succession dispute between \"Sigifredo nepos Godofredi regis et Anulo nepos Herioldi\", the battle in which both were killed but which Anulo's supporters won, and the accession of \"Herioldum et Reginfredum fratres eius regis\" .\n\nc) HANKWIN [Hakon/Holkwin] (-killed in battle Haithabu Summer 812). Einhard's Annales name \"fratres Hemmingi, Hancwin et Angandeo \" as the Danish signatories of the peace agreed in 811 .\n\nd) ANGANDEO [Angantyr] (-Haithabu Summer 812). Einhard's Annales name \"fratres Hemmingi, Hancwin et Angandeo \" as the Danish signatories of the peace agreed in 811 .\n\n3. [--- . m ---.] One child:\n\na) SIGURD [Sigfrid] (-killed in battle Summer 812). Einhard's Annales record that news of the death of \"Hemmingus Danorum rex\" arrived in 812, that \"Sigifridus nepos Godofredi regis et Anulo nepos Herioldi quondam regis\" both claimed the succession, and that the faction supporting \"Anulonis\" was victorious, with \"fratres eius Herioldum et Reginfredum\" being installed as kings . The Annales Fuldenses record the death in 812 of \"Hemmingo Danorum rege\", the succession dispute between \"Sigifredo nepos Godofredi regis et Anulo nepos Herioldi\", the battle in which both were killed but which Anulo's supporters won, and the accession by \"Herioldum et Reginfredum fratres eius regis\" . Assuming that \"nepos\" should here be translated as nephew, from the context of these passages it is likely that Sigfrid's parent was a different sibling of King Godofrid from the latter's brother who was King Hemming's father. Adam of Bremen names \"Sigafrid et Anuleo, nepotes Godafridi\" when recording that they fought to succeed after the death of King Hemming .\n\nHALFDAN, son of HARALD King of Haithabu & his wife Imhild --- (-killed in battle Walcheren 810) . Halfdan is shown in Europäische Stammtafeln as the son of King Harald, but the primary source on which this is based has not yet been identified. However, Einhard's Annales record that \" Anulo nepos Herioldi quondam regis\" was one of the claimants to the throne in 812 which, assuming that \"nepos\" should here be translated as grandson, indicates that this may be correct. The Annales Fuldenses record that \"Sigifridi regis Danorum\" sent \"Halbdani cum sociis suis\" as missi to a council held by Charles I King of the Franks at \"Lippia\" , although it is not known to which Halfdan this refers.\n\nHalfdan had [six] children:\n\n1. HEMMING (-killed in battle Walcheren [Walchram] 17 Jun 837). His parentage is established by the Annales Fuldenses which records the death of \" Hemmingum, Halldani filium\" (see below) . Described as brother of Kings Harald and Reginfred, Hemming must have been captured by Emperor Charlemagne as Einhard's Annales record that \"Harioldus et Reginfredus reges Danorum\" sent envoys to Emperor Charlemagne in 812 asking for the release of \"fratrum suum Hemmingum\" . The Royal Frankish Annals record that he was freed later in 812 . The Annales Fuldenses record that \"Nordmanni\" exacted tribute in \"Walchram insulam\", where \"Eggihardum eiusdem loci comitem et Hemmingum Halbdani filium\" were killed \"837 XV Kal Iul\" and \"Dorestadum\" was devastated .\n\n2. ANULO [Ali] (-killed in battle Haithabu 812). Although the primary source which confirms that Anulo was the son of Halfdan has not yet been identified, the sources cited below indicate that he was \"nepos\" (grandson?) of King Harald. Einhard's Annales record that news of the death of \"Hemmingus Danorum rex\" arrived in 812, that \"Sigifridus nepos Godofredi regis et Anulo nepos Herioldi quondam regis\" both claimed the succession, and that the faction supporting \"Anulonis\" was victorious, with \"fratres eius Herioldum et Reginfredum\" being installed as kings . The Annales Fuldenses record the death in 812 of \"Hemmingo Danorum rege\", the succession dispute between \"Sigifredo nepos Godofredi regis et Anulo nepos Herioldi\", the battle in which both were killed but which Anulo's supporters won, and the accession by \"Herioldum et Reginfredum fratres eius regis\" . Described as the nephew of \"Heriold and of the former king\", the latter presumably being King Hemming, he disputed the succession on King Hemming's death but was killed fighting the rival claimant Sigfrid . Adam of Bremen names \"Sigafrid et Anuleo, nepotes Godafridi\" when recording that they fought to succeed after the death of King Hemming .\n\n3.HARALD \"Klak\" [Heriold] (-killed in battle Walcheren 844). Einhard's Annales record that news of the death of \"Hemmingus Danorum rex\" arrived in 812, that \"Sigifridus nepos Godofredi regis et Anulo nepos Herioldi quondam regis\" both claimed the succession, and that the faction supporting \"Anulonis\" was victorious, with \"fratres eius Herioldum et Reginfredum\" being installed as kings . The Annales Fuldenses record the death in 812 of \"Hemmingo Danorum rege\", the succession dispute between \"Sigifredo nepos Godofredi regis et Anulo nepos Herioldi\", the battle in which both were killed but which Anulo's supporters won, and the accession by \"Herioldum et Reginfredum fratres eius regis\" . Adam of Bremen names \"Reginfridum et Haraldum\" as successors to Anulo without specifying their relationship to each other, recording that the sons of Godefrid devastasted the kingdom, forcing Harald to seek help from Emperor Louis I . Einhard's Annales record that \"Harioldus et Reginfredus reges Danorum\" sent envoys to Emperor Charlemagne in 812 asking for the release of \"fratrum suum Hemmingum\" . They made peace with Charles I King of the Franks, but were driven from Denmark by the sons of King Godefrid. The Annales Fuldenses record that Emperor Louis sent a Frankish army to help \"Herioldo Danorum regi\" against \"filios Godafridi\" in 815 . He and his brother Reginfred attacked the sons of King Godefrid in 814 in an attempt to regain the throne but were defeated, after which Harald \"came to the emperor [Louis I] and put himself under his protection\" . Einhard's Annales record that \"Harioldus et Reginfredus reges Danorum\" who, in the previous year had been expelled from Denmark by \"filiis Godofredi\", attacked again in 814 but \"Reginfridus et unus de filiis Godofredi qui maior natu erat\" were killed while \"Herioldus\" sought protection from the emperor . Einhard's Annales record that the Saxons and Abotrites, with \"Baldrico\" imperial legate, crossed \"Aegidoram fluvium in terram Nordmannorum vocabulo Sinlendi\" in 815 to help the deposed Harald King of Denmark . King Harald was restored as king by Emperor Louis I \"le Pieux\" in 819 with the help of the Obotrites. Einhard's Annales record that \"Harioldus\" was appointed joint-king by \"filiis Godofredi\" in 821 . Thegan records the baptism of Heriolt de Danais...et uxorem eius at Ingelheim together with the grant to him of magnam partem Fresonum . The Annales Fuldenses record that \"Herioldus cum uxore et magna Danorum multitudine\" were baptised at Mainz in 826 , when he was given the territory of Rüstringen on the mouth of the Weser in upper Frisia, the first portion of Frankish land to be ceded to the Danes. The Chronicon Roskildense records that \"Haraldus rex Danorum frater eius Hericus et uxor regis\" was baptised in 826 at Mainz by \"Othgario archiepiscopo\" . The Vita Hludowici Imperatoris records that \"Herioldum\" was expelled from Denmark [in 827] by \"filii Godefridi Danorum quondam regis\" . The Annales Bertiniani record that \"Gualacras\" (Walcheren) was granted to \"Herioldo\" by Emperor Lothaire in 841 . m --- (-after 826). The name of Harald´s wife is not known. Thegan records the baptism of Heriolt de Danais...et uxorem eius at Ingelheim . The Chronicon Roskildense records that \"Haraldus rex Danorum frater eius Hericus et uxor regis\" was baptised in 826 at Mainz by \"Othgario archiepiscopo\" . King Harald had three children:\n\na) GODEFRID (-murdered Jun 885) . The Annales Bertiniani record that \"Godefridus, Herioldi Dani filius\", who had been baptised at Mainz during the reign of Emperor Louis, defected from Emperor Lothar in 852, raided Frisia, and sailed up the Scheldt and the Seine . The Annales Fuldenses record that \"Nordmanni Godafredo duce\" sailed up the Seine in 850 and that Charles II \"le Chauve\" King of the West Franks granted him territory, without specifying where this was . He lost control of Rüstringen in 856. The Annales Bertiniani record that \"Roric et Godofridus\" returned to Denmark after Emperor Lothaire gave Frisia to his son Lothaire in 855, but recovered most of Frisia at the end of the same year, establishing themselves at Dorestad . Duke [of Frisia] 882. The Annales Fuldenses names \"Nortmannorum cum ipsis regibus Sigifredo et Godofrido, principis Vurm, Hals\" when recording a Viking attack in 882, in another manuscript recording the baptism of \"Gotafridum\" and that he was given \"comitatus et benefice qua Rorich Nordmannus in Kinnin [Kennemerland]\" held from the Frankish kings . The Annales Vedastini record that \"Godefridus rex\" was granted land which \"olim Roricus Danus tenuerat\" in 882 . The Annales Vedastini record that \"Godefridus Danus\" was killed in the city of \"Gerulfi sui fidelis\" by \"Heinrico duce\" in 885 . m (882) GISELA, illegitimate daughter of LOTHAIRE II King of Lotharingia [Carolingian] & his mistress Waldrada --- ([860/65]-[21 May/26 Oct] 907) . Regino records the marriage in 882 of \"Gisla filia Hlotharii\" and \"rex Godofridus Nordmannorum\" . The Annales Fuldenses record the marriage of \"Gotafrid Nordmannus qui superiore anno fuerat baptizatus\" and \"Hugone Hlutharii filio eiusque sororem\" in 883 . The Annales Vedastini record the marriage in 882 between \"Godefridus rex\" and \"Gislam filiam Hlotharii regis\" . Abbess at Nivelles and Fosses, after her husband died. \"Zendeboldus rex\" gave \"proprietatem in loco VII Fontes\" to \"propinqua nostra Kisla regis Lotharii filia abbatisse\" by charter dated 30 Jul 896 . \"Zuendebolchus rex\" gave property to \"neptis nostre Gissele Nyuialensis abbaciæ\" for her abbey by charter dated 26 Jul 897 .\n\ni) [REINHILD (-11 May ----) . The wife of Theoderich is named \"Reinhildam, Danorum Fresonumque germine procreatam\" in the Vita Mathildis Reginæ . According to Europäische Stammtafeln , she was the daughter of Duke Godefrid & his wife Gisela [Carolingian], which is presumably a guess based on this description in the Vita Mathildis. However, the chronology is not ideal. Regino records the marriage in 882 of \"Gisla filia Hlotharii\" and \"rex Godofridus Nordmannorum\" . If this couple's daughter was the mother of Queen Mathilde, the latter's estimated birth date (see below) would need to be pushed forward by several years, which makes the chronology for her known descendants tight. A better fit for the wife of Theoderich may be Regenlind, [sister of Bovo Bishop of Chalons, daughter of ---]. The known sister of Bishop Bovo was Frederuna, wife of Charles III \"le Simple\" King of the Franks. This hypothesis would therefore explain (1) the name Frederuna being transmitted to Regenhild's daughter, and (2) Berenger Bishop of Cambrai, recorded elsewhere as nepos of Queen Frederuna, being described as \" Ottonis imperatoris proxime consanguineus\" in the Gesta Episcoporum Cameracensium . If this is correct, the reference to Reginlind being \"Danorum Fresonumque germine procreatam\" has not been explained. m ([900]) THEODERICH, son of --- & his wife Mathilde --- (-8 Feb 917).]\n\nb) ROLF (-870). The Annales Bertiniani name \"Rodulfo Normanno, Herioldi filio\" when recording that he extracted money and provisions from \"Hlotharius Hlotharii filius\" in 864 .\n\nc) GUTHORM (-killed in battle 854). The Annales Fuldenses record the war in 854 between \"Horih regem Danorum et Godurm filium fratris eius\" in which both were killed, leaving only \"unus puer\" as the sole surviving member of the Danish royal family . Adam of Bremen records that \"Gudurm principe Nortmannorum\" challenged \"patruo rege Danorum Horico\", specifying that the only survivor of the conflict was \"puerum unum Horicum\" .\n\n4. RÖRIK [Horik/Heric] (-killed in battle 854). Adam of Bremen names \"fratri eius [=Haraldi] Horuch\" when recording that he was granted part of Frisia . The Chronicon Roskildense records that \"Haraldus rex Danorum frater eius Hericus et uxor regis\" was baptised in 826 at Mainz by \"Othgario archiepiscopo\" . The Chronicon Roskildense records that \"fratrem regis Haraldi Ericum\" succeeded as king \"nam mortuo Haraldo\" . The Annales Fuldenses record that \"Rorih natione Nordmannus\", who during the reign of Emperor Louis held \"cum fratre Herioldo vicum Dorestadum\", was captured in 850 . The Annales Fuldenses record the war in 854 between \"Horih regem Danorum et Godurm filium fratris eius\" in which both were killed, leaving only \"unus puer\" as the sole surviving member of the Danish royal family . Adam of Bremen records that \"Gudurm principe Nortmannorum\" challenged \"patruo rege Danorum Horico\", specifying that the only survivor of the conflict was \"puerum unum Horicum\" . The Chronicon Roskildense records that \"Hericum regem\" was killed and succeeded by \"Hericus puer\" . On his death, the kingdom of Denmark seems to have disintegrated .\n\n5. RAGNFRID (-killed in battle 814). Einhard's Annales record that news of the death of \"Hemmingus Danorum rex\" arrived in 812, that \"Sigifridus nepos Godofredi regis et Anulo nepos Herioldi quondam regis\" both claimed the succession, and that the faction supporting \"Anulonis\" was victorious, with \"fratres eius Herioldum et Reginfredum\" being installed as kings . The Annales Fuldenses record the death in 812 of \"Hemmingo Danorum rege\", the succession dispute between \"Sigifredo nepos Godofredi regis et Anulo nepos Herioldi\", the battle in which both were killed but which Anulo's supporters won, and the accession by \"Herioldum et Reginfredum fratres eius regis\" . Adam of Bremen names \"Reginfridum et Haraldum\" as successors to Anulo but does not specify their relationship to each other . Einhard's Annales record that \"Harioldus et Reginfredus reges Danorum\" sent envoys to Emperor Charlemagne in 812 asking for the release of \"fratrum suum Hemmingum\" . He and his brother were driven out of Denmark by the sons of King Godefrid in 813. He and his brother Reginfred attacked the sons of King Godefrid in 814 in an attempt to regain the throne but were defeated, Reginfred being killed . Einhard's Annales record that \"Harioldus et Reginfredus reges Danorum\" who, in the previous year had been expelled from Denmark by \"filiis Godofredi\", attacked again in 814 but \"Reginfridus et unus de filiis Godofredi qui maior natu erat\" were killed .\n\n6. [---.] Two children:\n\na) SIGFRID (-killed in battle 891). The only indication about the parentage of Sigfrid is provided by the Annales Vedastini which name \"Sigefridum Danum, christianum regique fidelim, qui nepos fuerat Heorici Dani\" when recording that he swore allegiance at \"Compendio palatio\" in 884 . The Annales Bertiniani name \"Sigefrido duce\" among the Danes resident \"in Carento [Charente]\" in 865 . The Annales Fuldenses record that \"Sigifridi Danorum regis\" negotiated peace with Ludwig II \"der Deutsche\" King of the East Franks in 873 at \"villa Bisestat prope Wormatiam\" . The Gesta Francorum names \"Sigifridi Danorum regis\" in 873 . The Annales Vedastini record that \"Sigefridum Danum, christianum regique fidelim, qui nepos fuerat Heorici Dani\" swore allegiance at \"Compendio palatio\" in 884 . The Annales Fuldenses names \"Nortmannorum cum ipsis regibus Sigifredo et Godofrido, principis Vurm, Hals\" when recording a Viking attack in 882 . The Gesta Francorum records that \"duo rege eorum Sigifredus et Godofridus\" were killed in battle in 891 . The Annales Fuldenses record that \"duo reges eorum, Sigifridus et Godofridus\" were killed in battle in 891 .\n\nb) HALFDAN (-after [876]). The Annales Fuldenses record that \"Halbdani frater Sigifridi regis\" attended a council held at \"urbem Mediomatricorum\" in Aug 873 . Adam of Bremen names \"Sigafrid cum fratre Halpdani\" as kings of Denmark, specifying that their names are recorded only \"in Hystoria Francorum\" not in Danish sources, and names \"Horich, Orwig, Gotafrid, Rudolf et Inguar tyranni\" as other leaders of the \"Danorum vel Nortmannorum\", the cruellest being \"Inguar filius Lodparchi\" . This passage is undated but immediately precedes the paragraph recording events in 876.\n\n1. RÖRIK [Horik] (-after 857). The Annales Bertiniani record that \"Roric et Godofridus\" returned to Denmark after Emperor Lothar gave Frisia to his son Lothar in 855 . The Annales Fuldenses record that \"Rorih Nordmannus\" who governed \"Dorestado\" sailed with a fleet to Denmark with the consent of \"domini sui Hlotharii regis\" in 857 and with the consent of \"Horico Danorum rege\" ruled part of the country between the sea and \"Egidoram\" . No indication has so far been found of the parentage of this Rörik.\n\n1. RÖRIK [Horik] (-after 858). Adam of Bremen records that \"Gudurm principe Nortmannorum\" challenged \"patruo rege Danorum Horico\", specifying that the only survivor of the conflict was \"puerum unum Horicum\" . The Chronicon Roskildense records that \"Hericum regem\" was killed and succeeded by \"Hericus puer\" . Adam of Bremen records that \"iuniorem Horicum\" recovered the kingdom in Denmark , undated but the passage immediately follows one recording events in 858. On his death, the kingdom of Denmark seems to have disintegrated . No indication has so far been found of the parentage of this Rörik.\n\na) [RAGNHILD \"the Rich\" (-[897) . Snorre names \"Ragnhild the Mighty\", a daughter of King Eirik from Jutland\" as one of the wives of King Harald, commenting that \"it is said that he put away nine wives\" when he married her . No indication has been found in the primary sources so far consulted about which King Rörik may have been Ragnhild's father. However, from a chronological point of view it is more likely that he was the most junior of the kings of this name. According to Snorre, \"Queen Ragnhild the Mighty\" lived three years after she came to Norway . m ([894]) as his sixth wife, HARALD I \"Hårfagre/Harfagri/Fairhair\" King of Norway, son of HALFDAN \"Swarti/the Black\" King of Vestfold & his second wife [Ragnhild Sigurdsdatter] ([853/54] or 860-Hogaland 933, 934 or 940, bur \"under a mound at Haugar in Karmtsund, near the church in Haugesund\").]\n\n1. HARALD (-after 852). The Annales Fuldenses record that \"Herioldus Nordmannus\", who had previously fled from \"domini sui Horih Danorum regis\", joined in 852 \"regem Hludowicum\" and was baptised . No indication has so far been found of the parentage of this Harald.\n\n1. RUDOLF (-after Jun 873). The Annales Fuldenses record that \"Hruodolfus quidam Nordmannus de regio genere\", who had devastated the kingdom of the West Franks, launched a fleet against \"in regnum Hludowici regis in comitatum Albdagi\" in Jun 873 . It is not known how Rudolf may have been related to the family of the kings of Denmark.\n\n1. GODEFRID (-killed in battle 891). The Chronicon Roskildense records that \"Frothi\" succeeded after the death of \"Hericus rex\" and was baptised by \"Unni Bremensis archiepiscopus\" and built churches in \"Sleswicensis et Ripensis [et] in honore sancte Trinitatis apud Arusam\" . The Gesta Francorum records that \"duo rege eorum Sigifredus et Godofridus\" were killed in battle in 891 . The Annales Fuldenses record that \"duo reges eorum, Sigifridus et Godofridus\" were killed in battle in 891 . It is not known how Godefrid may have been related to the other kings of Denmark.\n\n1. HALFDAN (-killed ----). The Chronicon Roskildense records that \"[Swen] huius filii Gorm et Hartha Knut\" invaded Denmark, killed \"rege Danorum Haldano cum filiis eius\" and divided the kingdom between them, adding that it is in doubt whether \"Haldanus\" was \"filius Clac Haraldi an non\", dating the event to around the time of the death of King Svend . This passage in the Chronicon Roskildense is confused and the alleged King Halfdan has not otherwise been identified.\n\n1. SVEND . Adam of Bremen names \"Sueonum principum\" as ruler of Denmark with his sons \"post Olaph\" , although the reference is too vague to be able to date his reign precisely.\n\na) HARDEKNUD . Adam of Bremen records that \"Hardegon filius Suein\" deprived \"Sigerich\" of the kingdom, but qualifies this by saying that it was uncertain how many kings reigned in Denmark during this period . The passage is undated but immediately precedes the recording of an event in 915. The Chronicon Roskildense records that \"[Swen] huius filii Gorm et Hartha Knut\" invaded Denmark, killed \"rege Danorum Haldano cum filiis eius\" and divided the kingdom between them . This passage in the Chronicon Roskildense is confused but appears to refer to the same Hardeknud as Adam of Bremen, but making him the brother instead of father of Gorm.\n\ni) GORM (-before 950, bur Jelling) . Adam of Bremen records that \"Hardecnudth Wrm crudelissimus\" was ruler in Denmark, and that \"Worm regem\" was forced to sue for peace by Heinrich I King of Germany who captured \"apud Sliaswich, quæ nunc Heidiba dicitur\" . It is unclear from these passages whether both deal with the same individual \"Hardeknud Gorm\" or with two separate individuals \"Hardeknud\" and [his son] \"Gorm\". Snorre names Gorm as father of Harald King of Denmark, and \"King Hordaknut\" as the latter's grandfather .\n\n- see Chapter 2. KINGS of DENMARK.\n\n1. SIGERICH . Adam of Bremen records that \"Sigerich\" replaced \"Sueonum principum\" as ruler of Denmark but ruled only a short time . No indication has been found of the dates of his reign.\n\nChapter 2. KINGS of DENMARK 935-1042 (FAMILY of GORM)\n\nGORM, son of [HARDEKNUD] & his wife his [wife] --- (-before 950, bur Jelling) . The Chronicon Roskildense records that \"[Swen] huius filii Gorm et Hartha Knut\" invaded Denmark, killed \"rege Danorum Haldano cum filiis eius\" and divided the kingdom between them . GORM \"den Gamle/the Old\" King of Denmark. Snorre names Gorm as father of Harald King of Denmark, and \"King Hordaknut\" as the latter's grandfather . Adam of Bremen records that \"Hardecnudth Wrm crudelissimus\" was ruler in Denmark, and that \"Worm regem\" was forced to sue for peace by Heinrich I King of Germany who captured \"apud Sliaswich, quæ nunc Heidiba dicitur\" , although as noted above it is unclear whether these passages both deal with the same individual \"Hardeknud Gorm\" or with two. The accuracy of the peace arrangements made with Germany is challenged by Danish historians . Thietmar of Merseburg refers to \"Knud I\" King of Denmark in this respect , which appears to support the co-identity of Hardeknud and Gorm. The Chronicon Roskildense records that \"Gorm crudelissimus rex\" established his capital \"apud Selandiam\" .\n\nm TYRE \"Danebod\" (-[935], bur Jelling). Saxo Grammaticus names Thyra as mother of King Harald, in the passage which records his third marriage (quoted more fully below) .\n\nKing Gorm & his wife had four children:\n\n1.KNUD Gormsen Danaast (-murdered 940). His parentage is confirmed by Snorre who names \"Harald, a son of Knut Gormson, and a brother's son of King Harald\" . One child:\n\na) HARALD Knudsen Guld-Harald (-murdered 965). Snorre names \"Harald, a son of Knut Gormson, and a brother's son of King Harald\", commenting that he gathered great riches from a long Viking raid . After his uncle King Harald refused to divide the kingdom with him, Haakon Sigurdson (in exile from Norway at the Danish court) proposed him as King of Norway . He defeated and killed Harald II King of Norway at Limfjord [965]. Having been betrayed by Jarl Haakon, the latter captured him and had him hanged .\n\n2. [GUNHILD ([910/20]-after 970) . The Historia Norwegie records the marriage of \"Ericus Blothex\" and \"de Dania Gunnildam Gorms Stultissimi Danorum regis filiam ac Thyri\", specifying that she was \"malificam et iniquissimam\" . According to Snorre, the wife of King Erik was the daughter of Ozur Tote, a Finn who lived in Halogaland . Her birth date range is estimated from her allegedly having nine sons by her husband, who were probably born in the range [935/50] if the indications in Snorre's narrative are correct. If this is correct, she was probably older than her brother King Harald, assuming that her Danish origin is correct. She returned to Orkney with her sons after her husband's death , departing in [spring/summer] 955 for Denmark where her sons received fiefs from King Harald. After her son succeeded as king of Norway, she was known as the \"King mother\" and exercised considerable influence in governing the country . She returned to Orkney with her surviving sons after the defeat of her son King Harald. m ([922]) ERIK I \"Blodøks/Bloodaxe\" King of Norway, son of HARALD Hårfagre/Fairhair King of Norway & his wife Ragnhild Eiriksdatter ([895]-954).

Adam of Bremen records that \"filium autem regis [=Worm] Haroldum\" succeeded as ruler in Denmark . He succeeded his father before 950 as HARALD I \"Blåtand/Bluetooth\" King of Denmark.\n\n- see below.\n\n4.TOKE Val-Toke Gormsen (-killed in battle [Fyrisvallarna], near Uppsala [985]). A Runic stone in Hällerstad church, Skåne, Sweden records that \"Eskil sat stone this aft Toke Gorms son, his gracious king. He fled not at Uppsala\" (referring to the battle at Fyrisvallarna in [985]) . m ---. The name of Toke´s wife is not known. Toke & his wife had one child:\n\na) ASBJØRN Tokesen (-killed in battle [Fyrisvall] near Uppsala [985]). The primary source which confirms his parentage has not yet been identified.\n\nHARALD Gormsen, son of GORM \"den Gamle/the Old\" King of Denmark & his wife Tyre \"Danebod\" ([925/35]-Jomsborg 1 Dec [986/87], bur Roskilde Cathedral ) . Adam of Bremen records that \"filium autem regis [=Worm] Haroldum\" succeeded as ruler in Denmark . Saxo Grammaticus names Harald as son of Tyre . The Chronicon Roskildense names \"Gorm pater Haraldi\", specifying that \"Haraldus\" reigned for 15 years during the life of his father and 50 years after his father died, and was known as \"Blatan sive Clac Harald\", on the other hand a later passage specifies that Harald succeeded his father Gorm . He succeeded his father before 950 as HARALD I \"Blåtand/Bluetooth\" King of Denmark. Snorre records that \"King Harald Gormson\" ruled in Denmark when the sons of King Eirik \"Blodøks\" sought refuge there in [955] . According to Snorre, he invaded Norway in 965 after the death of King Harald II, supported by Jarl Haakon Sigurdson, Harald Gudrodson \"Grenske\" and other Norwegian exiles . He effectively made himself ruler of Norway, but returned to Denmark after leaving Jarl Haakon in Norway as his regent . Emperor Otto invaded Jutland and defeated King Harald, who took refuge at Limafjord on the island of Marsey where he was converted to Christianity by Bishop Poppo after agreeing a truce with the emperor . Adam of Bremen records that King Harald submitted to Emperor Otto and was baptised \"cum uxore Gunhild et filio parvulo\" . Adam of Bremen names \"Suein Otto, filius magni Haroldi regis Danorum\" when recording that he deposed and expelled his father who fled to \"civitatem Sclavorum quæ Iumne dicitur\" where King Harald died from his wounds. Adam specifies that his body was repatriated to Roskilde for burial in the church of the Holy Trinity which he had built, that King Harald had ruled for 50 years and that he died \"in festivitate omnium sanctorum\" . Saxo Grammaticus records that his son Svend rebelled against him and forced his father to flee to Iulinum [Jomsborg] where he died from wounds received while counter-attacking his son's forces . Guillaume of Jumièges records that Aigroldus rex Danorum was expelled from his kingdom by \"filio suo...Sveno\" and was received in Normandy by dux [Guillaume Comte de Normandie] who granted him Constantiensem comitatum , although this is evidently anachronistic as Duke Guillaume died in 942. Guillaume of Jumièges records that Louis IV King of the West Franks, after the death of Richard´s father, marched on Rouen, was received by Rodulphus et Bernardus atque Anslech totius Normannici ducatus tutores, and captured Richard, who was taken to Laon but was freed by Osmundus...consilio cum Yvone patre Willelmi de Belismo and taken to Silvanectis where Bernardus...comes protected nepotem suum Richardum , a passage dated to [945] from the context. According to King Olav Trygvason's Saga, King Harald defeated his son but died from wounds received in the battle . Modern-day \"Bluetooth\" computer technology was named after King Harald, his union of Denmark and Norway being considered by the inventors, for some reason, as analogous with the wire-free linking of computer devices .\n\nm firstly ([before 960]) GUNHILD, daughter of ---. Adam of Bremen names Gunhild as wife of King Harald when recording that the couple were baptised with their small son .\n\nm secondly TOVE, daughter of [MSTIVOJ] & his wife --- (-[990]). Her marriage and parentage are confirmed by a Runic stone at Sönder Vissing, Denmark which records that \"Tufa let gera [make] kuml [monument], Mistiuis do´tter,ept [daughter] Mo´thur [mother] sina.Kona [queen] Haralds hins Goda,Gorms sonar\" . According to Europäische Stammtafeln she was Tove, daughter of Mstivoj the Wendish prince. The name of Tove´s father, \"Mistiuis\", on the Runic stone bears some similarity to Mstivoj. However, one difficulty is the apparent chronological discrepancy. The only other reference to Mstivoj is dated to 1000 (see MECKLENBURG) and gives no idea about his age at the time. Nor is there any indication of the date of Tove´s marriage, although it appears unlikely that she married much later than 980 considering the date her husband died. This would place her birth in [960] which, in turn, would mean that Mstivoj would have been over 60 years old when he is mentioned in 1000. This is not impossible, but it seems a little surprising. Another possibility is that she was Tove of Poland, daughter of Mieszko I Prince of Poland, presumably by one of his early wives. The name \"Mieszko\" is just as similar to \"Mistiuis\" as \"Mstivoj\". If this hypothesis is correct, Tove could have been the sister of the first wife of King Harald´s son, King Svend, implying a father/son double marriage with two sisters.\n\n[m [thirdly] ([984/85]) GYRITHA of Sweden, sister of STYRBJÖRN \"den Starke/the Strong\" King of Sweden, daughter of ---. This marriage is only referred to by Saxo Grammaticus, who says that King Styrbjörn had sought help from King Harald after being deposed as king of Sweden by his cousin and granted Harald his sister in marriage: he records that Sturbionus, Suetici regis Biornonis filius was deposed by patrui Olaui filio, Erico, despite help from Haraldum [Harald I King of Denmark], cui Thyra mater extitit, cum sorore Gyritha supplex migravit...quanto illi eiusdem sororis sue matrimonium...permisit, dated to [984/85] .]\n\nKing Harald I had six children, maybe all by his first wife although this is not certain:\n\n1. HAKON Haraldsen (-before 987). According to Saxo Grammaticus , Hakon attacked the Sembi (a Prussian tribe living north of modern-day Kaliningrad). Adam of Bremen records that King Harald sent \"Hiring filium\" with an army to England and the death of Hiring in Northumbria , the paragraph being undated but following that recording the succession of Emperor Otto III in 983.\n\n2. SVEND Haraldsen ([960]-Gainsborough 3 Feb 1014, bur in England, later removed to Roskilde Cathedral) . Adam of Bremen names \"Suein Otto, filius magni Haroldi regis Danorum\" when recording that he deposed and expelled his father . He succeeded his father in [987] as SVEND I \"Tveskæg/Forkbeard\" King of Denmark.\n\n- see below.\n\n3. TYRE Haraldsdatter (-18 Sep [1000]) . The primary source which confirms her first marriage has not been identified. The Historia Norwegie, when recording her third marriage, says that \"sororem Sweinonis regis Tyri\" had earlier been betrothed to \"dux quidam de Sclauia\" . Saxo Grammaticus records that Erik King of Denmark deposed her first husband, dated to [984/85] . The following source suggests that Erik received Polish help at the time: one manuscript of Adam of Bremen records that \"Hericus rex Sueonum\" made a treaty with rege Polanorum Bolizlao and that Bolizlaus gave filiam vel sororem to Herico . It is therefore not a great leap to assume that, at the same time, the marriage was arranged between Bolesław of Poland and the widow of Eriks predecessor. A variation on this theme is provided by Snorre, who records Sigvalde...earl over Jomsborg in Vindland capturing Svend King of Denmark (soon after he deposed his father) and taking him to Vindland, to Jomsborg, where he forced him to make peace with Burizleif, the king of the Vinds, the arrangement including Svends marriage to Gunhild, King Burizleifs daughter and the marriage of King Burizleif to Thyre, a daughter of Harald, and King Sveins sister . This passage is shown to be inaccurate regarding King Svend (see below under his first marriage), but the report about Tyres marriage is believable. Hlawitschka, in his analysis of the wives of Erik King of Sweden and Svend King of Denmark (discussed further below), suggests that Burislaw/Burizleif of the Wends was in fact the same person as Bolesław I \"Chrobry/the Brave\" Prince of Poland , which is consistent with Adams statement. In a later passage, Snorre records Tyre's flight to Norway from her second husband and her subsequent marriage to King Olav . The Historia Norwegie records the marriage of King Olav and \"sororem Sweinonis regis Tyri\" . Adam of Bremen records the marriage of \"Olaph Trucconis filius\" and \"a Dania superbissimam Thore\" soon after he returned to Norway after exile in England . Adam of Bremen records that, after the death of her husband, his wife starved herself to death . m firstly STYRBJÖRN[Björn] den Starke/the Strong\" of Sweden, son of [BJÖRN Erkison/OLOF Björnsson King of Sweden & his wife ---] (-killed in battle Fyrisvall, near Uppsala 985). m secondly ([987], divorced) as his [third] wife, BOŁESLAW of Poland, son of MIESZKO I Prince of Poland & his [eighth] wife Dobrava [Dobroslawa] of Bohemia ([967]-17 Jun 1025), or (less likely) as his [---] wife, Burislaw Prince of the Wends, son of ---. m thirdly (Tønsberg 998) as his third wife, OLAV ITrygveson King of Norway, son of TRYGVE Olavvsson King in Romerike & his wife Åstrid Eiriksdatter ([968]-in a sea battle in the Øresund, off Svold near Rügen 9 Sep [1000]).\n\n4.

Adam of Bremen names \"Suein Otto, filius magni Haroldi regis Danorum\" when recording that he deposed and expelled his father . Converted to Christianity with his father, he was baptised \"OTTO SVEND\" in honour of Emperor Otto . Snorre records that \"Svein, King Harald's son\" rebelled after his father refused to share the kingdom with him, but was forced to flee, although his father had been mortally wounded and Svend was chosen as king after he died . Saxo Grammaticus records that Svend rebelled against his father who fled to Iulinum [Jomsborg] where he died from wounds received while counter-attacking his son's forces . He succeeded in [early 987] as SVEND I \"Tveskæg/Forkbeard\" King of Denmark. Saxo Grammaticus records that King Svend immediately set about restoring the heathen religion in Denmark . Adam of Bremen records that King Svend persecuted Christians in Denmark (Suein rex persecutionem christianorum exercuisset in Dania) . Adam also records that \"rex Sueonum Hericus\" invaded Denmark and expelled Suein, derelictus a Deo, frustra sperans in ydolis suis, the latter phrase suggesting that the invasion occurred after Svend had abandoned christianity . Thietmar (writing [1012/18]) records that \"Sueino Haraldi fillio\" was \"post mortem patris sui\" captured a Northmannis insurgentibus . Adam of Bremen records that King Svend made war contra Sclavos and was twice captured et in Sclavaniam ductus . Snorre expanded the story, noting that Sigvalde...earl over Jomsborg in Vindland... captured King Svend and took him to Jomsborg, threatening to deliver him into the hands of the Wends unless he made peace . Adam of Bremen records that \"rex Sueonum Hericus\" invaded Denmark and expelled King Svend, who was eventually received by \"rex Scotthorum\" with whom he stayed seven years until the death of King Erik [994/95], after which he returned to Denmark after 14 years exile (anno depulsionis vel peregrinatioinis suæ 14) , although the length of his absence must be exaggerated. The implication of Adams report is that King Svend first attacked England during his exile: the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records in 994 that \"came Anlaf [Olav Tryggveson, who succeeded in [995] as Olav I King of Norway] and Swein to London with ninety-four ships and kept up an unceasing attack on the city\" 8 Sep 994 . The Chronicle of the Princes of Wales records that \"the isle of Man was devastated by Swain son of Harold\" in 994 . At that time, Stenton suggests that there was some support to declare Svend as king of England from those who despaired of the government of King Æthelred \"the Unready\" . Adam of Bremen records that Olof King of Sweden (Olaph sane, qui post obitum patris Herici regnum super Suevos accepit) invaded Denmark, expelled infelicem Suein a regno and conquered the kingdom (et ipse optinuit Daniam), but that Olof restored Svend in regnum suum, eo quod matrem suam habuerit\" . Olav I King of Norway attempted to invade Denmark but was defeated by King Svend in a naval battle \"inter Sconiam et Seland\", during which King Olav was drowned, after which Svend imposed himself as king of Norway . Danish raids on England intensified after King Æthelred ordered the massacre of Danes in England 13 Nov 1002, which included the death of King Svend's sister Gunhild sister of King Svend. A full-scale Danish invasion came in 1013 and by the end of the year Svend had become SVEINde factoKing of England. King Æthelred fled to Normandy after Christmas 1013 , but after Svend's death in Feb 1014 he was invited back, but on condition he improve his rule. Adam of Bremen records that King Svend held England for only a short time before he died . Guillaume of Jumièges records that Danamarchæ...regique Sveno invaded England but died apud Lundoniam, was buried apud Danamarcham, and was succeeded by filius eius...Chunutus who launched a new invasion with Lacman equidem Suauorum et Olavum Noricorum . The Encomium Emmæ Reginæ records his sons shipped their fathers body \"in Danomarchiam\" .\n\nThere is considerable confusion between the sources regarding King Svends marriages :\n\nm firstly ([before 987?]) --- (-before [994/95]). No primary source has been found which names King Svends first wife convincingly. It is assumed that Svend did have an earlier wife, as a first marriage (with the Polish princess, see below) in [995?] would seem late considering his estimated birth date. This first marriage would presumably be dated to before or around the time of his accession to the Danish throne. The issue is confused by Snorre who names \"Geira, Gunhild and Astrid\" as the three daughters of \"in Vindland a king called Burizleif\" , and in a later passage records that Sigvalde...earl over Jomsborg in Vindland captured Svend King of Denmark (soon after he deposed his father) and took him to Vindland, to Jomsborg where he forced him to make peace with Burizleif, the king of the Vinds, the arrangement including Svends marriage to Gunhild, King Burizleifs daughter and the marriage of King Burizleif to Thyre, a daughter of Harald, and King Sveins sister . If Snorre is correct, Svends first wife would be Gunhild of the Wends, daughter of Burislav King of the Wends & his [first] wife ---. Svends capture (but not his marriage) is confirmed by Thietmar (writing [1012/18]) who records that \"Sueino Haraldi filio\" was \"post mortem patris sui\" (therefore dated to [987]) captured a Northmannis insurgentibus . Further details are provided by Adam of Bremen (writing [1075/85]) who records that \"rex Sueonum Hericus\" invaded Denmark and expelled Suein, derelictus a Deo, frustra sperans in ydolis suis , and in another passage that \"Hericus rex Sueonum\" made a treaty with rege Polanorum Bolizlao and that Bolizlaus gave filiam vel sororem to Herico . Adam therefore contradicts Snorre regarding the involvement of Sigvalde and about who married whom at the time. The dating of Snorres sagas to [1230] suggests that the earlier sources should be preferred, although there are indications that the Icelandic/Norse sagas were based on earlier documentation which no longer survives (discussed in the Introduction to the document NORWAY KINGS). Hlawitschka, as part of his discussion about the wives of Erik King of Sweden and Svend King of Denmark, suggests that Burislaw/Burizleif of the Wends never existed and was in fact Bolesław I \"Chrobry/the Brave\" Prince of Poland . Thietmars and Adams reports suggest that Hlawitschka is correct, while the other sources cited below indicate that the Polish princess was King Svends second wife whom he married in [994/95]. Snorre confuses the issue further, by recording elsewhere that Toste had a daughter...proud and high-minded...Sigrid who married \"the Swedish king, Eirik the Victorious, and had a son by him...Olaf\" and, in another saga, that after his first wife died [Gunhild, see above] the Danish king Svein Tjuguskeg married Sigrid the Haughty, a daughter of Skoglartoste, and mother of the Swedish king Olaf noting that by means of this relationship there was great friendship between the kings... . If that is correct, Svend married [as her second husband] Sigrid Storråda/the Haughty, widow of Erik Segersäll/the Victorious King of Sweden, daughter of \"Skoglar\" Toste & his wife ---, which directly contradicts all the sources quoted below which indicate the Polish princess as the widow of the Swedish king and second wife of Svend (and also that she was the lady who was Storråda/the Haughty). Fagrskinna also names Sigrid, mother of King Olof, as daughter of Skoglar-Tosta . Hlawitschka attempts to resolve the confusion by suggesting that King Svend married firstly the composite person Gunhild, daughter of Skoglar Toste . This possibility cannot be dismissed, but the suggestion, in particular that Svends first wife was named Gunhild, is uncorroborated by primary sources except Snorre. The attempt also does not explain Snorres reference to Skoglar Tostes daughter marrying the Swedish king, by whom she was mother of his successor (which also contradicts the other sources cited below). Another possibility is presumably that Sigrid, daughter of Skoglar Toste, married firstly the Swedish king (as his first wife) who repudiated her, and secondly married the Danish king (also as his first wife) who may have repudiated her as well, in which case the confusion in the sources could be attributed to both Svends wives being named Sigrid.\n\nm secondly ([995?], [repudiated]) as her second husband, SIGRID [Syritha] [Czcirada/Czirada/więtosława] [Storråda/the Haughty] of Poland, widow of ERIK Segersäll/the Victorious King of Sweden, daughter of MIESZKO I Prince of Poland & his [first/seventh wife --- or [eighth] wife Dobrava [Dobroslawa] of Bohemia] (-[after Summer 1015]). Thietmar refers to the mother of \"filiis Suenni\" as \"Miseconis filia ducis, soror Bolizlavi successoris eius et nati [=cognati?, [eius?] referring to Svend?]\", commenting that a viro suimet [=Svend] diu depulsa non minimam cum cæteris perpessa est controversiam (\"long exiled by her husband this woman suffered no small amount of controversy\") [suggesting her repudiation, as discussed further below] . As these events occurred only about 15/20 years before Thietmar was writing (in [1012/18?]), his report is probably as reliable as could be expected. Adam of Bremen (writing [1075/85]) broadly reflects the same information, recording the marriage of King Svend and \"Herici relictam, matrem Olaph\" , another manuscript stating that \"Hericus rex Sueonum\" had made a treaty with rege Polanorum Bolizlao·and that Bolizlaus gave filiam vel sororem to Herico . Her two marriages are further confirmed by Adam who records that [her son by her first marriage] Olof King of Sweden (Olaph sane, qui post obitum patris Herici regnum super Suevos accepit) invaded Denmark, expelled infelicem Suein a regno and conquered the kingdom (et ipse optinuit Daniam), but that Olof restored Svend in regnum suum, eo quod matrem suam habuerit\" . Neither Thietmar nor Adam name the Polish kings daughter. Saxo Grammaticus (writing about a century after Adam) confirms her name (but not her family origin) and two marriages, noting that King Svend married \"Syritha Suetiam\" after she was unsuccessfully wooed by Olav I King of Norway, and naming Olof King of Sweden as King Svend's stepson . Morkinskinna confirms Saxo by naming \"Sigridr en stórráda\" as mother of the lady Ástrídr sister of two kings, Knútr the Great and Óláfr the Swede who married Jarl Úlfr sprakaleggr . The name Sigrid/Syritha could of course be a Norse/German adaptation of a Polish name. Hlawitschka analyses secondary sources which discuss Sigrids Polish origin, including those which propose alternative Polish names Czcirada/Czirada or więtosława . Thietmars reference to Svend repudiating his second wife appears corroborated by Saxo Grammaticus who records that, after his father's death, Olof returned to Sweden [from Denmark] with \"his mother Syritha, and stayed there exercising his sovereignty under his mother's tutelage\" (Erici filius Olavus cum matre Syritha Suetiam repetivit, ibique degens regnum materno arbitrio subiectum habuit) . This passage suggests that Olof arrived in Denmark with his mother on her second marriage and returned to Sweden with her (presumably after Svend repudiated her), when he was still a minor. At some point, Sigrid presumably left Scandinavia and returned to her native homeland as the Encomium Emmæ Reginæ records that \"Cnuto\" [and his brother?] visited Sclavoniam in [Summer] 1015 and brought back matrem suam, quæ illuc morabatur [who was staying there] . The date of Sigrids death is not known. Sigrid of Poland was studied by Rafal T. Prinke (his article has not been studied in detail as it is in the Polish language) .\n\nMistress (1): ---. The primary source which confirms the name of Svends possible mistress, maybe mother of his daughter Gyda, shown below, has not been identified.\n\nKing Svend & his [first wife/Mistress (1)] had one [maybe illegitimate] child:\n\n1.GYDA Svendsdatter . Snorre records the marriage of Eirik and Gyda, daughter of King Svend, in 996 . According to Brenner, she was either illegitimate or the daughter of one of King Svend's marriages . If Snorres date is correct, Gyda could not have been born from her fathers second marriage. Europäische Stammtafeln shows her as King Svend's legitimate daughter, as his oldest child so presumably by his first marriage (not specified) . m (996) EIRIK Håkonsson Jarl, son of HÅKON Sigurdsson Jarl (-in England [1023]). Regent in Norway 1000-1015. Jarl in Northumbria 1015.\n\nKing Svend & his [second] wife had [five] children:\n\n2. KNUD Svendsen ([995]-Shaftesbury, Dorset 12 Nov 1035, bur Winchester Cathedral, Old Minster) . The Encomium Emmæ Reginæ names \"Cnutone filio suo [=Sueinum] maiore\" . He succeeded King Edmund II \"Ironsides\" in 1016 as CANUTE King of England. He succeeded his brother in 1018 as KNUD I \"den Storre/the Great\" King of Denmark.\n\n- see below.\n\n3. HARALD Svendsen (-[1018]). It is uncertain whether Harald was the older or younger son of King Svend. Thietmar names (in order) \"fratres Harald et Cnut\" when recording their arrival in England in 1016 with \"dux Thurcil\" and laying siege to London . If the Encomium Emmæ Reginæ was right, Harald was King Svend's younger son as it names \"Cnutone filio suo [=Sueinum] maiore\" . Stenton refers to Harald as King Svend's older son: the basis for this is not stated, but was presumably the Encomium. At first sight his accession in Denmark suggests that he was the older son. However, it is not impossible that England was considered the greater prize and that his brother Knud relegated his younger brother to succeed in Denmark. He succeeded his father in 1014 as HARALD II King of Denmark.\n\n4. [--- . Her parentage and marriage are indicated by Florence of Worcester as noted below under her daughter. As Florence refers to her Canutes sister, she could have been his full sister or half-sister, maybe even born from another husband of one of King Svends wives. The date of her daughters marriage suggests that she was one of her parents older children. Her husband has not otherwise been identified. m WYRTGEORN [Vortigern?], son of ---.] One child:\n\na) GUNHILD (-after 1045) . Florence of Worcester names \"the noble lady Gunhilda daughter of king Wyrtgeorn by Canute's sister and successively the wife of earls Hakon and Harold\" when recording that she was banished from England in 1044 with her two sons Haakon and Harald and went to Bruges, later to DenmarkGunhild is named \"kinswoman of King Cnut\" in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, when recording that she was expelled from England in 1045 and for a long time thereafter lived at Bruges before going to Denmark . m firstly (1029) HAKON Eiriksson Jarl in Norway, son of ERIK Hakonsson Earl of Northumbria & his wife Gyda Svendsdatter ([998]-drowned Pentland Firth 1030 before 29 Jul ). According to Florence of Worcester, \"Hakon a Danish earl who had married the noble lady Gunilda, his [=King Canute's] sister's daughter by Wyrtgeorn king of the Winidi\" was banished from England in 1029 by King Canute \"for he feared that the earl would take either his life or his kingdom\" . m secondly ([1031]) HARALD Thorkilsen Jarl, son of THORKIL \"Havi/the Tall\" Ealdorman of East Anglia & his [first] wife --- (after 1017-murdered 1043).]\n\n5. ESTRID [Margrete] Svendsdatter (-9 May ----, bur Roskilde) . The sources quoted below indicate her parentage, although her description as King Knuds sister does not automatically mean that they shared the same mother. Adam of Bremen records that \"Chnud rex Danorum\" gave \"suam germanam Margaretam pro foedere\" to \"comitis Nortmannorum Rikardi\" and, after she was repudiated by Richard, to \"Wolf duci Angliæ\" . The Chronicon Roskildense records that \"Kanutus\" gave \"sororem Estrith\" to \"Richardo\", who repudiated her, after which she married \"duci Ulf\" without her brother´s consent . Snorre names \"Astrid, a daughter of King Svein Forkbeard\" as wife of Earl Ulf, specifying that she was \"a sister of Canute the Great by the father's side and of the Swedish king Olaf Eirikson by the mother's side, for her mother was Queen Sigrid the Haughty, a daughter of Skoglar Toste\" . Morkinskinna names the lady Ástrídr sister of two kings, Knútr the Great and Óláfr the Swede as daughter of King Sveinn Forkbeard and Sigrídr en stórráda who had previously been married to King Eirikr enn sigrsæli and wife of Jarl Úlfr sprakalegge . Saxo Grammaticus also records her betrothal . Betrothed (after 1017) to RICHARD II \"le Bon/l'Irascible\" Duke of Normandy, son of RICHARD I \"Sans Peur\" Comte [de Normandie] & his second wife Gunnora --- (-23 Aug 1026). m ULF Thrugilson Jarl [Wulfsige Sprakling], son of THORGILS Sprakling [THRUGILS Sprakaleg] & his wife --- (-murdered Roskilde 1026, bur Roskilde).\n\n6. SANTSLAVA . \"h' Santslaue soror Cnvti regis nostri\" is named in an undated list of \"Nomina feminarum illustrium\" in the Liber vitae of Winchester Cathedral . Her name, possibly of Slavic origin, suggests that she was born from King Knud's second marriage (assuming that, as suggested above, his second wife was the Polish princess).\n\nKNUD Svendsen, son of SVEND I \"Tveskæg/Forkbeard\" King of Denmark & his [second wife Sigrid of Poland] ([995]-Shaftesbury, Dorset 12 Nov 1035, bur Winchester Cathedral, Old Minster) . The Encomium Emmæ Reginæ names \"Cnutone filio suo [=Sueinum] maiore\" . The identity of Knud's mother is open to doubt (it is linked to the question of his fathers wives discussed above), although the Encomium records that \"Cnuto\" [and his brother?] visited Sclavoniam in [Summer] 1015 and brought back matrem suam, quæ illuc morabatur [who was staying there] which suggests that she was his fathers second wife. Thietmar refers to the mother of \"filiis Suenni\" as \"Miseconis filia ducis, soror Bolizlavi successoris eius et nati [=cognati [eius]?, referring to Svend?]\", commenting that a viro suimet [=Svend] diu depulsa non minimam cum cæteris perpessa est controversiam (\"long exiled by her husband this woman suffered no small amount of controversy\") (this last comment is unexplained further) . Adam of Bremen (writing [1075/85]) records the marriage of Svend King of Denmark and \"Herici relictam, matrem Olaph\" and their son Chnut , another manuscript stating in an earlier passage that \"Hericus rex Sueonum\" made a treaty with rege Polanorum Bolizlao and that Bolizlaus gave filiam vel sororem to Herico . The Fagrskinna suggests that Knud was the son of King Svend's first marriage by stating that Astrid, daughter of King Svend and Sigrid Skoglar-Tosta, had the same father as King Knud and the same mother as Olof King of Sweden . According to Ronay, Knud was taken back to Poland with his mother after her divorce and fostered by Thorkell \"the Tall\" at the fortress of Jömsborg at the mouth of the River Oder , presumably elaborating on Thietmar. Knud took part in the invasion of England led by his father in 1013. After the death of King Svend, Æthelred II King of England counter-attacked the Danes in Lindsey, and the Danish fleet under Knud withdrew to Denmark. In August 1015, Knud invaded England again. Guillaume of Jumièges records that Danamarchæ...regique Sveno invaded England but died apud Lundoniam, was buried apud Danamarcham, and succeeded by filius eius...Chunutus who launched a new invasion with Lacman equidem Suauorum et Olavum Noricorum . By the end of 1015, he was in control of Wessex, helped by the defection of Eadric \"Streona/the Acquisitor\" Ealdorman of Mercia. The Danes controlled Northumbria in early 1016, then turned their attention to London and the south-east. After the death of King Æthelred in Apr 1016, the Witan offered the throne to Knud, to whom a group of nobles and church dignitaries from southern England swore allegiance at Southampton . Knud's fleet laid siege to London, which was relieved by King Æthelred's son King Edmund \"Ironside\" who had been proclaimed king by an assembly in London. Knud turned his attention to Mercia, Eadric \"Streona\" defecting back to King Edmund's forces at Aylesford, only to return to Knud at Ashingdon in Essex where Danish forces finally defeated King Edmund in Oct 1016 . At Alney, near Deerhurst, the king agreed a compromise division of the country with Knud, Edmund taking Wessex and Knud the north, but Edmund died in Nov 1016 before this could be implemented. After the death of King Edmund II, Knud was accepted as CANUTE King of England, crowned maybe at Old St Pauls Cathedral, London 6 Jan 1017. After succeeding in England, he divided the country into four districts for administrative purposes . He appointed Eadric \"Streona\" as Ealdorman of Mercia (\"slain in London\" the same year ), gave East Anglia to Thorkell the tall, confirmed Erik Haakonsson Jarl in Norway as Earl of Northumbria, and kept direct control over Wessex. He held a national assembly at Oxford in 1018 which decided the legal form of his rule, largely following that of King Edgar \"the Peaceable\". He succeeded his brother in 1018 as KNUD I \"den Storre/the Great\" King of Denmark, leaving England for Denmark to take possession in 1019. His position in Denmark did not go unchallenged, for he was defeated at the Holy River in [1025] by Olaf King of Norway and Amund King of Sweden . He expelled Olav King of Norway in 1028, declaring himself KNUD King of Norway. Malcolm II King of Scotland submitted to him in 1031 . The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records the death of King Canute at Shaftesbury on 12 Nov 1035 and his burial in the Old Minster, Winchester .\n\nm (2 or 31 Jul 1017) as her second husband, EMMA de Normandie, widow of ÆTHELRED II King of England, daughter of RICHARD I \"Sans Peur\" Comte de Normandie & his second wife Gunnora --- ([985]-Winchester 14 Mar 1052, bur Winchester Cathedral, Old Minster ). Adam of Bremen records the marriage of \"Chnud\" and \"regnum Adelradi uxoremque eius Immam soror comitis Nortmannorum Rikardi\" . Emma was described by Henry of Huntingdon as \"Emma Normanorum gemma\" , although it is not known whether this was a particular indication of her beauty or mere hyperbole. She was known as \"ÆLFGIFU\" in England . Her first husband sent her to her brother's court in Normandy in 1013 after the invasion of Svend King of Denmark . She was living in Normandy in 1017 when King Æthelred's successor King Canute proposed marriage to her. Guillaume of Jumièges records that, after the death of Edelredus rex, Emmam reginam married rex...Chunutus...Christiano more, and names their children Hardechunutum postmodum regem Danorum et filiam...Gunnildem quæ nupsit Henrico Romanorum Imperatori . Roger of Wendover records the marriage in Jul 1018 of \"Cnuto\" and \"ducem Ricardum Emmam sororem suam et regis Ethelredi relictam\" . After the death of her second husband, she continued to live at Winchester. After the election of her step-son as regent in early 1036, it was recognised that she would continue to live there to look after the interests of her son Harthacnut (then absent in Denmark), who had nominally succeeded his father as king of England and Denmark. It is likely that she encouraged her sons by her first husband, Edward and Alfred, to join her. After Harold was recognised as king of England in 1037, Emma was expelled from England and took refuge at Bruges . She commissioned the Encomium Emmæ Reginæ from a Flemish convent at Saint-Omer, maybe St Bertin's, designed to promote her son Harthacnut's claim to the English throne. Harthacnut joined her in Bruges in early 1040, and after the death of King Harold I, they returned together to England. After the accession of her son by her first husband, Edward \"the Confessor\" to the English throne, Emma appears to have supported the rival claim of Magnus King of Norway . King Magnus had claimed the throne of Denmark on the basis of an alleged agreement reached with Harthacnut in 1039, and invaded and took control of large parts of Denmark on the strength of it. He claimed the English throne on the same basis and threatened to invade, but was too preoccupied with conquering Denmark to carry out the threat. Whatever the truth of this, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reports that King Edward did confiscate her property in 1043 . She seems to have spent the last years of her life in retirement in Winchester . The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records the death of \"Ælfgifu Emma, the mother of king Edward and of king Harthacnut\" in 1052 .\n\nMistress (1): (before [1015]) ÆLFGIFUÆlfhelmsdotter of Northampton, daughter of Ealdorman ÆLFHELM of Deira & his wife Wulfrun of Northampton (-after [1042]). Roger of Wendover names \"Algiva, Elfelmi comitis filia\" as first wife of \"regis Cnutonis\" and mother of \"duos filios Suanum et Haroldum\" . She was known as ALFIFA in Denmark and Norway. King Knud took her as a \"temporary wife\" , but the \"marriage\" was not recognised by the church. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Harold claimed that he was the son of King Canute by \"Ælfgifu of Northampton, although it was not true\", another passage commenting that \"many thought this [claim] quite incredible\" . She continued to behave as Queen in the north of England after King Canute married Emma. King Canute appointed her co-regent in Norway in 1030 for their son Svend. Morkinskinna records that Álfifa accompanied her son Svend back to Denmark after he was overthrown as king of Norway (in 1035) . Morkinskinna records that Álfifa tried unsuccessfully to poison Magnus King of Norway but killed King Hordaknútr instead (dated to 1042), and that she vanished instantly so that she could not be punished, stating that this took place in the sixth year of King Magnus´s reign . Morkinskinna records that Álfífa tricked a powerful duke named Otto south in Saxony, when visiting Norway and arrived in Vik, into thinking that her daughter not King Sveinn´s sister by the same father was Ulfhild, sister of Magnus King of Norway . The paragraph refers to Ordulf Duke of Saxony who later married Ulfhild, their marriage being dated to Nov 1042. This is the only reference so far identified to this supposed daughter. However, it seems surprising that Ælfgifu would have been present in Norway and have been in a position to welcome foreign visitors, given that her son by King Canute had been overthrown as king of Norway by King Magnus. All passages in Morkinskinna which refer to Álfífa treat her with disdain as the archetypal wicked queen figure, suggesting that they should all be treated with caution. Weir gives her date of death as 1044? without any basis for her conjecture . Roger of Wendover records that death \"Algiva, Elfelmi comitis filia\", first wife of \"regis Cnutonis\", died in 1018 , but this date is incompatible with the other sources quoted above.\n\nKing Canute & his wife Queen Emma [Ælfgifu] had two children:\n\n1. HARDEKNUD (England 1018-Lambeth 8 Jun 1042, bur Winchester Cathedral). Guillaume of Jumièges records that, after the death of Edelredus rex, Emmam reginam married rex...Chunutus...Christiano more, and names their children Hardechunutum postmodum regem Danorum et filiam...Gunnildem quæ nupsit Henrico Romanorum Imperatori . Adam of Bremen names \"Hardechnut\" as son of King Knud and Emma when recording that he succeeded his father in Denmark . Hardeknud may have been the son of King Knud who in 1023 was delivered as a hostage to Thorkell \"Havi/the Tall\", in exchange for Thorkell's son, when Thorkell was reconciled with the king and appointed regent in Denmark . Hardeknud was proclaimed associate king of Denmark in 1028 at Nidaros. He succeeded his father in 1035 as HARDEKNUD King of Denmark. It seems that his father intended that Hardeknud and his half-brother Harald should succeed jointly in England, but Hardeknud was unable to leave Denmark to claim the English throne. He finally arrived at Bruges, where his mother was living in exile, in 1039 . He was there when his half-brother died, whereupon he succeeded as HARTHACNUT King of England. He sailed back to England with his mother, landing at Sandwich 17 Jun 1040 . He is said to have been crowned at Canterbury Cathedral in Jun 1040 . His uterine half-brother Edward came to England in 1041 and was \"sworn in as future king\" . Florence of Worcester records that King Harthacnut fell down \"by a sad mischance while in the act of drinking\" at the wedding feast of his father's retainer, Tovi the Proud, and \"continued speechless\" until he died a few days later . Morkinskinna records that Álfifa tried unsuccessfully to poison Magnus King of Norway but killed King Hordaknútr instead (dated to 1042), and that she vanished instantly so that she could not be punished, stating that this took place in the sixth year of King Magnus´s reign . The Libellus de Anniversariis of Ramsey Monastery records the death VI Id Jun of Hardcnute rex, qui dedit Hemingford .\n\n2.GUNHILD [Æthelfryth] ([1020]-in Italy 18 Jul 1038, bur Limburg Klosterkirche). Guillaume of Jumièges records that, after the death of Edelredus rex, Emmam reginam married rex...Chunutus...Christiano more, and names their children Hardechunutum postmodum regem Danorum et filiam...Gunnildem quæ nupsit Henrico Romanorum Imperatori . Adam of Bremen records that the daughter of King Knud married \"imperator filio suo\" . Her parentage is stated by Orderic Vitalis, who also refers to her marriage . Wipo names \"Chnutonis regis Anglorum filiam, nomine Chunehildem\" as wife of \"Heinricus rex, filius imperatoris\" when recording their marriage in 1036 . The Annalista Saxo records that the wife of King Heinrich III was \"filiam Cnud regis Danorum\", specifying that the marriage was arranged by Unwan Archbishop of Bremen , although this seems unlikely as Archbishop Unwan died in 1029 . Herimannus names \"Chunihildem, Cnutonis Danorum et Anglorum regis filiam\" when recording her marriage to \"Heinricus rex, filius imperatoris\" in 1036 . She adopted the name KUNIGUND on her marriage. The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines records that \"uxor imperatoris Henrici Gunhildis imperatrix de Anglia\" was accused of adultery, that she was defended in trial by combat, but that after her champion's victory she disdained the success and became a nun . William of Malmesbury also recounts that she was accused of adultery and retired to a convent . She died during her husband's expedition to Italy , the death of \"regina Conihild\" being recorded in the Annalista Saxo \"XV Kal Aug\" . The necrology of Speyer records the death \"XV Kal Aug\" of \"Cunehilt regina\" . m (Nijmegen [29] Jun 1036) as his first wife, HEINRICH III King of Germany, Duke of Bavaria, son of Emperor KONRAD II & his wife Gisela of Swabia (Ostrebeck 28 Oct 1017-Burg Bodfeld im Harz 5 Oct 1056, bur Speyer Cathedral).

Adam of Bremen names \"Suein\" as son of King Knud \"a concubina\" when recording that he succeeded in Norway . Roger of Wendover names \"Algiva, Elfelmi comitis filia\" as first wife of \"regis Cnutonis\" and mother of \"duos filios Suanum et Haroldum\", but adds that \"others said that they were conceived \"ex fornicatione\" . According to Florence of Worcester, it was asserted at the time that his mother \"desired to have a son by the king but, as she could not, she caused the new-born child of a certain priest to be brought to her\" and made the king believe it was his son . His father appointed him SVEND King of Norway in 1030, under the regency of his mother. Morkinskinna records hostility between Sveinn Álfífuson and King Yaroslav [of Russia] because the king correctly judged that the Norwegians had betrayed Saint Óláfr . He continued to rule in Norway until 1035, when Norwegian nobles from the Trondheim area, dissatisfied with Danish rule, recalled Magnus Olavsson from Novgorod and installed him as king of Norway. Morkinskinna records that King Sveinn the son of Álfifa died in Denmark in the winfer after he was overthrown as king of Norway .\n\n4.HARALD (maybe Northampton [1016/17]-Oxford 17 Mar 1040, bur Abbey Church of St Peter Westminster , probably later removed to St Clement Danes, Strand, London). Adam of Bremen names \"Haroldus\" as son of King Knud \"a concubina\" when recording that he succeeded in England . Roger of Wendover names \"Algiva, Elfelmi comitis filia\" as first wife of \"regis Cnutonis\" and mother of \"duos filios Suanum et Haroldum\", but adds that \"others said that they were conceived \"ex fornicatione\" . According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Harold claimed that he was the son of King Canute by \"Ælfgifu of Northampton, although it was not true\", another passage commenting that \"many thought this [claim] quite incredible\" . Florence of Worcester comments that \"some say that he was the son of a cobbler\" and that his mother had acted with him in the same way as with his brother Svend (see above) . In Mercia when King Canute died, in early 1036 Harald was elected regent of England \"on behalf of himself and his brother Harthacnut\" in Oxford by a council led by Leofric Earl of Mercia, while Harthacnut was absent in Denmark. This text appears to imply that a joint kingship was intended at the time. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that Harald confiscated King Canute's \"best valuables\" from Queen Emma at Winchester in 1036, but allowed her to continue to live in the town . Harold \"began to reign as though he was the lawful heir\" and shortly afterwards the kingdom was divided by lot, Harold getting the north and Harthacnut the south . In Harthacnut's continuing absence, Harald was chosen as king in England in 1037 , when he can be taken to have succeeded as HAROLD I\"Harefod/Harefoot\" King of England, crowned in 1037 at Oxford. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, King Harold's body was \"disinterred and cast into a marsh\" on King Harthacnut's orders .\n\nChapter 3. KINGS of DENMARK 1047-1412 (FAMILY of THORGILS)\n\nA.

Bjørn was killed on board the ship of his cousin Earl Svein, son of Godwin Earl of Wessex.\n\nc) ASBJØRN Ulfsen (-1086). Adam of Bremen names \"in Anglia duces Bern [et] Osbern\" as brothers of \"Suein regis\" . As Asbjørn is not named with his brothers in the earlier passage which names their mother, it is possible that he was their half-brother born from a concubine. Like his brother, he lived in England.

KINGS of DENMARK 1047-1412\n\nSVEND Estridsen, son of ULF Thrugilson [WULFSIGE Sprakling] & his wife Estrid [Margrete] Svendsdatter of Denmark ([1020]-Søderup [28] Apr 1074, bur Roskilde Cathedral) . Adam of Bremen names \"Bern ducem et Suein regem\" as sons of \"Wolf duci Angliæ\" & his wife . Morkinskinna names Sveinn as son of Jarl Úlfr sprakalegge and the lady Ástrídr . He fled to Sweden after the death of his father . Created Jarl in 1042 by Magnus King of Norway. He claimed Denmark on the death of his cousin Hardeknud, but Magnus II \"the Good\" King of Norway also claimed the Danish throne based on an alleged agreement with Hardeknud before the latter's death. King Magnus invaded Denmark and was master of most of the country before the end of 1046. Magnus King of Norway died on an expedition against Svend Estridsen, who was able to succeed in 1047 as SVEND II King of Denmark. The Chronicon Roskildense records the succession of \"Sven, regis Gambliknut ex sorore nepos filius Estrid et Ulf\", adding that he had \"filios filiasque ex diversis mulieribus\" . He was defeated by Harald III \"Hardråde\" King of Norway at Nissa in 1062, but made peace with Norway at Gota in 1064. Orderic Vitalis records that Suenus rex Danorum sent a fleet led by duos...filios suos et Osbernum fratrem suum to attack England, that they were repulsed at Dover, Sandwich and Ipswich, and at Norwich by Radulfus de Guader, that they were joined by Adelinus, Guallevus, Siguardus but defeated on the Humber, entered York headed by Guallevus...Gaius Patricius, Marius Suenus, Elnocinus, Archillus et quatuor filii Karoli but were eventually expelled, dated to 1069 . Saxo Grammaticus says that King Svend was \"famed for his generosity, remarkably benevolent\", encouraged the building of churches and the spread of Christianity, but \"soiled this spotless conduct only by the excesses of his lust\" . According to William of Malmesbury, King Svend bound the inhabitants of Denmark by oath that \"as he had 14 sons, they should confer the kingdom on each of them in succession as long as his issue remained\" . Simeon of Durham records the death in 1076 of \"Suane king of the Danes a man well imbued with learning\" . The Chronicon Roskildense records the death in 1074 of \"rex Danorum Sveno Magnus in Iucia\" after reigning for 31 years and his burial \"Roskildie\" .\n\nm firstly ([1052], divorced 1054) as her second husband, GUNHILD Svensdatter, widow of ANUND JAKOB King of Sweden, daughter of Jarl SVEN Haakonsson & his wife Holmfrid of Sweden (-1060 or after). Adam of Bremen refers to the marriage of \"rex iuvenis Suein\" and \"consanguineam a Suedia\", the king being threatened with excommunication by the Archbishop of Bremen and papal letters, his wife being named \"Gunhild [vel Giuthe] reginam\" in a later passage which records that after her separation she devoted herself to charitable activities on her estates . Snorre records that \"Gunhild, Earl Svein's other daughter\" was married to \"the Danish king Svein Ulfson\" . Her parentage is referred to in Knytlinga Saga .\n\nm secondly (divorced 1055) GYDA, daughter of --- (bur Gudheim). Adam of Bremen names Gyda as King Svend's legitimate queen, adding that she was poisoned by Thora . She was the same person as King Svend's first wife shown above, according to Saxo Grammaticus .\n\nm thirdly THORA, daughter of ---. Adam of Bremen names Gyda as King Svend's legitimate queen, adding that she was poisoned by Thora . According to Brenner , she was Thora Thorbergsdatter, mistress of Harald III Hardråde King of Norway, daughter of Thorberg Arnesson [Arnung] from Giske, married after the death of King Harald although there appears to be no direct evidence to corroborate this. Christiansen considers that the identification is far-fetched , in view of what must have been her age at the time of the supposed marriage: it is likely that she was born in [1020/25] considering the likely birth dates of her sons by King Harald. There appears to be another chronological problem: the proposed consecration of Thora's son Magnus at Rome is best explained if he was King Svend's oldest son, which would place his birth (and therefore his parents' marriage) in the late 1030s/early 1040s. Another oddity is that Thora would have given the same name to her son by King Svend as her older son by King Harald.\n\nKing Svend II & his first wife had one child:\n\n1. SVEND Svendsen ([1053]-) . His legitimate parentage is referred to in Knytlinga Saga . Saxo Grammaticus refers to one illegitimate son of King Svend named Svend, listed third in the order of sons, and implies that he was the full brother of Eymund . same person as ? SVEND (-murdered near Philomelum, Asia Minor 1097). William of Tyre records \"Danorum regis filius Sueno nomine\" who with 1500 men was killed by Turks near Nikaia . Albert of Aix records \"filius regis Danorum Sueno nomine\" who, with 1500 men travelling to Antioch from Nikaia, was ambushed and killed between Philomelum and Pherna . He has been identified with Svend Svendsen . However, if this is correct it is not clear why he was not considered for the succession on his father's death or on the subsequent deaths of his brothers. [Betrothed to FLEURINE de Bourgogne, daughter of [EUDES I Duke of Burgundy [Capet] & his wife Sibylle de Bourgogne [Comté]] (-murdered near Philomelum, Asia Minor 1097). Albert of Aix records that \"Florina filia ducis Burgundiæ\", widow of \"Philippensium principi\", accompanied the expedition of \"Danorum regis filius Sueno\" across Asia Minor \"sperans post triumphum Fidelium tanto tamque nobili sociari marito\" but that they were attacked between Philomelum and Pherna and killed . The dating of the supposed expedition to 1097 is consistent with the context of the passage. Albert of Aix appears to be the only source which gives any information relating to her. She is not mentioned in any of the Burgundian sources which have so far been consulted during the preparation of Medieval Lands. If she did exist, the chronology dictates that Eudes I must have been the duke of Burgundy who was her father. There appears to be no satisfactory way of identifying her husband \"Philippensium principis\". The text of Albert of Aix does not clearly indicate her betrothal to Svend of Denmark, although secondary sources assume that it took place. It is of course not impossible that Albert´s report is garbled and that, when he left on crusade in late 1100 (see above), Duke Eudes took with him one of his daughters whom he married to a local dignitary. If that is correct, the expedition during which she was killed must have been a different one from the one reported by Albert of Aix and the connection with Svend of Denmark doubtful. Kerrebrouck doubts the existence of Fleurine, who \"died in Palestine in [1102], married to a Macedonian Lord\".]\n\nKing Svend II & his third wife had one child:\n\n2. MAGNUS (-young). Son of King Svend and Thora according to Adam of Bremen, who says that he was sent to Rome to be consecrated for kingship . same person as ? KNUD . Illegitimate son of King Svend listed in Knytlinga Saga, first in order in the list, but not referred to in other sources .\n\nKing Svend II had [eighteen] illegitimate children by unknown mistresses. The order of birth of King Svend's illegitimate sons is uncertain. The order shown below is as set out in Knytlinga Saga , except where otherwise noted. As can be seen, this order is completely different from that set out in Saxo Grammaticus but reflects the order of succession to the throne which presumably (although not inevitably) followed seniority of age:\n\n3. GORM (-[before 1069]). Illegitimate son of King Svend according to Saxo Grammaticus who lists him first in the order of sons and implies that he was the full brother of Harald . He is not named among King Svend's sons in the list in Knytlinga Saga, unless he was the same person as \"Guthorm\" who is named there. He is not named among the sons of King Svend who accompanied the expedition to England in 1069 .\n\n4. HARALD (-17 Apr 1080, bur Dalby Abbey, near Lund) . Illegitimate son of King Svend listed in Knytlinga Saga, second in order in the list , while Saxo Grammaticus lists him second in order and implies that he was the full brother of Gorm . Saxo Grammaticus says that Harald was possessed by \"an everlasting slothful inertia\" since boyhood . Florence of Worcester records that \"Suani regis Danorum filii, Haroldus, Canutus et patruus eorum Esbernus comes et comes Turkillus\" sailed from Denmark in [1069] and landed \"in ostio Humbræ fluminis\" . He succeeded his father in 1074 as HARALD III \"Hein/the Whetstone\" King of Denmark. The Chronicon Roskildense records that \"filius eius Haroldus\" succeeded on the death of \"rex Danorum Sveno Magnus in Iucia\" and ruled for seven years . Snorre records that \"his son Harald Hein\" succeeded King Svend and ruled for three years . m [his first cousin, MARGRETE Asbjørnsdatter, daughter of ASBJØRN Ulfsen Jarl in Denmark & his wife ---. A Queen Margreta is referred to in the Liber daticus Roskildensis who was assigned to King Harald III in the 19th century . The marriage of King Harald to the unnamed daughter of Asbjørn is referred to in Knytlinga Saga .]\n\n5. SIGRID Svendsdatter ([1040/43] -) . Illegitimate daughter of King Svend according to Saxo Grammaticus who lists her separately from all his sons, suggesting that she was from a different mother . 1066. m [as his second wife,] GOTTSCHALK Prince of the Wends, son of PRIBIGNEV & his wife --- (-murdered 7 Jun 1066).\n\n6.KNUD (-murdered Odense, St Albans Church 10 Jul 1086, bur Odense, St Albans Church, later called St Knuds Church) . Illegitimate son of King Svend listed in Knytlinga Saga, third in order in the list , while Saxo Grammaticus lists him ninth in order and implies that he was the full brother of Erik . Florence of Worcester records that \"Suani regis Danorum filii, Haroldus, Canutus et patruus eorum Esbernus comes et comes Turkillus\" sailed from Denmark in [1069] and landed \"in ostio Humbræ fluminis\" . He challenged the succession of his brother Harald in 1074, supported in particular by the Scanians, but went into exile when he was unsuccessful . Jarl in Sjælland 1074. He invaded England in 1075, joining a revolt against William I King of England, raiding Yorkshire. He succeeded his brother in 1080 as KNUD II den Hellige/the Holy King of Denmark. The Chronicon Roskildense records that \"frater eius Kanutus\" succeeded on the death of \"Haroldus\" . He led expeditions against the Curones (in coastal Latvia, later Courland) and Estonians . He was planning another invasion of England with his father-in-law in 1085, but was delayed \"almost two years by the adverseness of the wind, changed his design, affirming that it must be the determination of God that he could not put to sea\", but later being \"misled by the suggestions of some persons who attributed the failure of their passage to the conjurations of certain old women, he sentenced the chiefs whose wives were accused to an intolerable fine\" and was murdered in consequence . Saxo Grammaticus records that he was besieged in the church of St Alban, while praying, by \"the mutinous populace\" who eventually broke in and killed him on the altar . The Chronicon Roskildense records that \"Kanutus\" was killed \"Othinse in ecclesia sancti Albani\" in 1090 in the eleventh year of his reign . Canonised 1100 by Pope Pascal II, feast day 19 Jan. m ([1080]) as her first husband, ADELA de Flandre, daughter of ROBERT I \"le Frison\" Count of Flanders & his wife Gertrud of Saxony [Billung] ([1065]-Apr 1115).

She married secondly (1092) Roger\"Borsa/the Purse\" Duke of Apulia. King Knud II & his wife had three children:\n\na) CARL ([1084]-murdered Bruges 2 Mar 1127, bur Bruges, St Donatien, later Saint-Sauveur) .
