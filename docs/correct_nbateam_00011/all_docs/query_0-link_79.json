        "text": "The New York Knicks, losers of their last five games, could certainly use a spark. Head coach David Fizdale reached deep into his bag of tricks and pulled out something magnificent for his squad during Sunday’s practice: a special guest appearance from franchise legend Rasheed Wallace.*\n\n*Some will say that Wallace, who only played 21 games for the Knicks, does not qualify as a “franchise legend.” To them, I say this...\n\nWas Sheed’s tenure in New York awesome? Hell yes. Have the Knicks reached the playoffs since Sheed left? Hell no.\n\nAnyway, the former All-Star big man was invited to practice to impart his unique brand of wisdom upon the Knicks’ young frontline. And impart he did.\n\n“Bullshitting and lollygagging” — truly Sheed is a poet of the roundball.\n\nRookie Mitchell Robinson talked to Stefan Bondy about what it was like to work with Sheed:\n\n“He pushed me to talk more on defense. I have a tendency to be a little quiet. And him, he brings it,” said Robinson, who didn’t watch Wallace much live because (want to feel old?), “that was way before my time.”\n\nThank, Mitch...now I feel terrible about my age.\n\nLong story short, the Knicks are gonna win tomorrow."
