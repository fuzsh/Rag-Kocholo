        "text": "Rasheed Wallace has retired from professional basketball for the second time, the New York Knicks announced in a press release on Wednesday. The 38-year-old forward came out of retirement to sign with the Knicks before the start of the 2012-13 season. The last time he had played in the NBA was with the Boston Celtics in 2010.\n\n\"Rasheed has given this team everything he had,\" Knicks head coach Mike Woodson said in a statement. \"He is a winner, true professional, and leader on and off the court.\"\n\nWallace appeared in 21 games for the Knicks, averaging 7.0 points and 4.0 rebounds a game while providing a defensive presence off the bench. His season was cut short by foot surgery that sidelined him most of the year. He played for the Knicks on Monday against the Charlotte Bobcats, but after getting hurt again, he announced his retirement.\n\nWallace was drafted by the Washington Bullets in 1995 and played one season before being traded to the Portland Trail Blazers the following summer. With the Blazers, he reached the Western Conference Finals twice and made two All-Star teams, while becoming one of the most colorful players in the NBA. He set a league record by picking up 41 technical fouls during the 2000-01 season.\n\nWallace was traded to the Atlanta Hawks during the 2003-04 season, and appeared in just one game in Atlanta before being traded to the Detroit Pistons. He played a major role on Detroit's NBA championship team that year, and had several more successful seasons with the Pistons. He was named an All-Star in 2006 and 2007.\n\nWallace remained with the Pistons until 2009, when he signed as a free agent with the Celtics and helped them reach the NBA Finals, where they lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in seven games."
