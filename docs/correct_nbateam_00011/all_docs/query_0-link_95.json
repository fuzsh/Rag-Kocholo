        "text": "The New York Knicks confirmed on Saturday that Rasheed Wallace has a stress reaction and chronic condition in his left foot. The Knicks are still listing him as day to day, when he was previously diagnosed with a “sore left foot.” Wallace, who had been serving as Tyson Chandler’s backup at center, has missed the past four games, during which the Knicks have gone 2-2. With Wallace out, Chandler has been playing additional minutes. Not only is Wallace out, but Marcus Camby has plantar fasciitis.\n\nRasheed Wallace’s mysterious “sore foot” injury is really a stress fracture, according to a Knicks source. Officially, the team is listing Wallace’s status as day-to-day, but privately it is optimistic that the injury won’t sideline the veteran forward for an extended period of time. Wallace missed his fourth straight game on Friday and hasn’t practiced or played in 10 days.\n\nThe hope is that he’ll be back at some point after the Knicks’ three-game West Coast trip that begins on Christmas Day against the Lakers in Los Angeles. Wallace, who has missed six games overall because of his foot injury, is using a walking boot on his left foot. Wallace, 38, returned to the NBA after sitting out the past two seasons for unspecified reasons. He insists that he was never retired and has made an important contribution to the team. Wallace is averaging 7.2 points, 4.2 rebounds and 14.6 minutes per game while serving as a de-facto defensive coach.\n\nWith Rasheed Wallace’s sore left foot becoming a bigger issue, the Knicks’ need for Amar’e Stoudemire has grown. Thursday will be a huge day as Stoudemire will participate in the Erie Bayhawks’ practice for the second time, to be conducted at the Westchester facility. Stoudemire rested his sore left knee Wednesday, but how it goes Thursday with the Knicks’ D-League affiliate could determine whether there’s any possible chance of suiting up at the end of the homestand Sunday vs. Minnesota. Stoudemire said he has no date set on his season debut and reported his knee being “sore’’ after his initial practice Tuesday.\n\nYou have to give Rasheed Wallace credit: He knows how to make an exit. The New York Knicks forward yelled at officials after being called for a foul on Phoenix Suns forward Luis Scola in their game at Madison Square Garden. Then he yelled at them again after Goran Dragic shot the technical free throw. Part of what he yelled was his signature “Ball don’t lie”. Wallace has been called for four technical fouls this season, but that doesn’t lead the league. His teammate Carmelo Anthony and the Sacramento Kings’ DeMarcus Cousins have five. Here’s a clip of what Wallace had to say:\n\nLatrell Sprewell once famously said after a particularly poor performance on a Sunday afternoon, “I’m not a morning person.” The game, it should be noted, began at noon and not 7 a.m. Maybe Rasheed Wallace isn’t a morning person either because the 38-year-old lasted only 85 seconds before being ejected in the Knicks 106-99 victory over the Phoenix Suns. Wallace received two technical fouls, one for arguing a foul call and the other for screaming his signature phrase “Ball Don’t Lie” when Goran Dragic missed the free throw. Wallace extended his NBA record of technical fouls to 317, including four with the Knicks. His Sunday was over late in the first quarter and just in time for the 1 p.m. NFL games. That was also the time that Carmelo Anthony was just getting starting. Apparently, Melo can ball at any hour. The Knicks forward scored 34 points on 11-for-27 shooting as the Knicks improved to 12-4 overall and 7-0 at the Garden. Under Mike Woodson, the Knicks are 18-1 at MSG."
