        "text": "Former Portland Trail Blazers star Rasheed Wallace is joining the Memphis Tigers men’s basketball coaching staff under Penny Hardaway, The Athletic reported Wednesday.\n\nThe four-time NBA All-Star will join his former head coach with the Detroit Pistons, Larry Brown, as an assistant coach for the Tigers. Wallace won a title with the Pistons in 2004 under Brown.\n\nThe 16-year NBA veteran emerged as a prime candidate to jump from preps to college and join Hardaway’s staff at the beginning of the month.\n\nWallace, 46, transitioned to coaching after retiring from the NBA in 2013. He was previously the head coach at NC Better Best Academy in North Carolina. Before taking the job in June, he spent the past two seasons as head coach at Jordan High in Durham. Before that, he spent one year as an assistant under Maurice Cheeks in Detroit (2013-14).\n\nHardaway has served as Memphis’ head coach since 2018, where the program is 63-32 during his three seasons. He signed a five-year extension with the Tigers through the 2025-26 season last December.\n\n-- Aron Yohannes"
