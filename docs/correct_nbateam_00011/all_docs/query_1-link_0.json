        "text": "Gregory Shamus/Getty Images\n\nFormer Knick Stephon Marbury had an interesting comment concerning the organization's acquisition of Carmelo Anthony in 2011 (via ESPN New York's Ian Begley):\n\n\"I don't know if (Knicks owner James) Dolan brought him in to win games or to make money,\" Marbury said. \"I think it was to make money.\"\n\nYou can't help but wonder if similar considerations motivated the newfound interest in 38-year-old Rasheed Wallace. Let's face it—at this point, Wallace's biggest asset is his name.\n\nNevertheless, The New York Post's Marc Berman reports that this isn't just a James Dolan thing:\n\nKnicks coach Mike Woodson, who was on Larry Brown’s staff in 2004 when the Pistons won the title with Wallace as a linchpin, wants this to happen. The Knicks feel they have nothing to lose for the veteran’s minimum of $1.7 million.\n\nNothing to lose? How about a roster spot and $1.7 million?\n\nIf Dolan is looking to give that kind of money away, I bet more than a few Knicks fans will get in line.\n\nBerman goes on to discuss Woodson's love of experienced veterans and the team's reliance upon aging depth in the paint, all valid premises in theory.\n\nBut how about a little context? This team is anything but short on veteran leadership. Between Jason Kidd (39), Marcus Camby (38) and Kurt Thomas (almost 40), the Knicks are already halfway to playing out their careers on a stage somewhere in Vegas.\n\nIt might make sense to add Wallace if he were still hungry for a ring, but he's had one since 2004. The only thing he's hungry for at this age is an early bird dinner, as evidenced by the fact that multiple teams have attempted to pry him from retirement over the last two years to no avail.\n\nOkay, so maybe Wallace wouldn't lend that burning desire, but surely he'd serve as yet another mentor, right?\n\nMaybe, but how many mentors does a locker room need?\n\nWith the Knicks' second unit looking more like a staff of assistant coaches, you'd have to worry about there being too many cooks in the kitchen. A little bit of wisdom can go a long way, and we all know the last thing Carmelo Anthony and J.R. Smith want to hear are four different accounts of walking to school in the frigid snow.\n\nPlus, Wallace probably isn't the guy you want mentoring anyone. After collecting an all-time league-leading 304 career technical fouls, Sheed may be the one in need of a mentor—even now.\n\nThe thought of him setting an example for the likes of J.R. Smith or Iman Shumpert isn't especially comforting.\n\nAnd that's the problem with all the reasons for adding Wallace. They sound good for all of five seconds, and then you remember we're talking about a guy who hasn't played in two seasons and last shot 28 percent from behind the arc in 2009-10 during his one campaign with the Boston Celtics.\n\nYou remember that Wallace spent the better part of his career causing distractions, rebounding less than he should have and taking tons of three-pointers regardless of how many were actually falling.\n\nThe preoccupation with adding depth at the 4-spot is especially baffling given how successful Carmelo Anthony was at the position during stretches of last season.\n\nIf anything, you'd think NYC would be looking for another small forward or two so that 'Melo could do more of the same this time around, alternating with Amar'e Stoudemire so that they each have opportunities to play as the lone, featured scorer.\n\nDon't forget Steve Novak. He won't bring Wallace's temper, but if you want a spread-4 who doesn't rebound, he's your man.\n\nBy almost any metric, this one is a head-scratcher, even by Dolan standards.\n\nIt almost seems as though Woodson is telling everyone what Dolan wants to hear, which wouldn't be terribly surprising given a new coach's interest in endearing himself to a franchise that tears through coaches at a steady clip."
