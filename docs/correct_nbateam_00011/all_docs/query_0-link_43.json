        "text": "The New York Knicks signed forward Rasheed Wallace, a four-time All-Star who is ending a two-year retirement.\n\nWallace, 38, last played for the Celtics in the 2009-10 season. Terms of his contract, which was signed Wednesday, were not announced.\n\nWallace averaged 14.6 points and 6.7 rebounds in 15 seasons. The temperamental 6-foot-11-inch Wallace frequently clashed with referees but was a respected teammate and versatile player who helped the Pistons win the 2004 NBA title. Knicks coach Mike Woodson was an assistant on that team.\n\nStopping flopping"
