        "text": "Per a tweet from ESPN NBA analyst and San Francisco area radio host Ric Bucher, there is a possibility that former Portland Trailblazers, Detroit Pistons, and Boston Celtics star Rasheed Wallace could come out of his brief retirement to become a part of the New York Knicks.\n\nIf it is indeed true that the Knicks are considering adding Wallace, then New York would be adding to an already long and experienced roster. As pointed out by Posting and Toasting, SB Nation's New York Knicks blog, the 38-year-old Rasheed Wallace would only be the fourth-oldest player on the New York roster were he to sign today.\n\nWith Amare Stoudemire, Carmelo Anthony, Tyson Chandler, Marcus Camby and Kurt Thomas already a part of the Knicks organization, it is interesting to think that New York could be in the market for yet another big man. However, Wallace could bring significant and valuable experience to a franchise hungry to win again.\n\nDuring his long NBA career, Wallace was a controversial and often-criticized player for his aggression and propensity for technical fouls. Wallace is currently the NBA's all-time leader in technical fouls with 304, and set the single-season mark for technical fouls with 41 in 2000-01. In spite of that, though, Wallace is a four-time NBA All-Star and was an important part of the Detroit Pistons' 2004 NBA Championship team.\n\nFor more New York Knicks coverage, visit Posting and Toasting, SB Nation New York, and the SB Nation NBA hub."
