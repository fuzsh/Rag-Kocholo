        "text": "GREENBURGH, N.Y. -- New York Knicks forward\n\nretired again from the NBA on Wednesday after he was unable to recover from a left foot injury.\n\nShortly after coach Mike Woodson said Wallace was still struggling with soreness, the Knicks made the announcement in a press release.\n\n\"Rasheed has given this team everything he had,\" Woodson said in the statement. \"He is a winner, true professional and leader on and off the court. Due to his injury, he will not be available to play for us during the playoffs. We owe this season's success to veterans like Rasheed.\"\n\nIt's a damaging blow for the Knicks, who loaded up on veteran big men this season but have now lost two of them for good in Kurt Thomas and Wallace, and have gotten almost nothing from Marcus Camby. All three are former\n\n.\n\nAlso, Amare Stoudemire's status for the postseason is unclear as he recovers from right knee surgery.\n\nThe Knicks added another big man Wednesday by signing Earl Barron, another former Blazer.\n\nWallace, 38, ended a two-year retirement this season to join the Knicks and play for Woodson, who was an assistant in Detroit when Wallace helped the Pistons win the 2004 NBA title. The 6-foot-11 forward was a key player off the bench during the Knicks' strong start, but hadn't played since December before returning Monday against Charlotte.\n\nWallace, who had surgery to repair a broken left foot on Feb. 28, lasted only 4 minutes before exiting because of continued soreness.\n\nWoodson said during the Knicks' morning shootaround that Wallace was still bothered by pain and it wasn't known if he would be able to play Saturday against Boston in the postseason opener.\n\n\"Again, it's not my foot, so I don't know,\" Woodson said. \"I mean, as long as I've known him, he's had a high tolerance for pain, but obviously it's bothering him and we're going to have to be cautious of that.\"\n\n, from 1996-2004, and had his best season statistically in 2001-02, when he averaged 19.3 points and 8.2 rebounds. The four-time All-Star finishes with career averages of 14.4 points and 6.7 rebounds.\n\nThe Knicks were hoping Wallace would be able to give them a few minutes a game in the postseason, but Woodson acknowledged earlier Wednesday that the soreness was a \"big problem.\"\n\n\"Again guys, I'm not a doctor and I've never had foot problems, so I can't even begin to relate to what these cats are going through. But only thing (is) I feel for them, because I do know that they do want to be on the floor,\" Woodson said. \"They feel like that they can help us and right now that's not the case with Rasheed.\"\n\nWallace retired after helping the Celtics reach the 2010 NBA Finals. Woodson reached out to him in the offseason about a comeback, seeking Wallace's defensive toughness and veteran leadership. But Wallace could only deliver it for 21 games in his 15th season, averaging 7.0 points and 4.0 rebounds in about 14 minutes per game.\n\nThe Knicks expect Tyson Chandler (bulging disk) and Kenyon Martin (sprained left ankle) to be ready for the playoff opener.\n\nThomas was waived recently to free up a roster spot after his season ended because of a stress fracture in his foot.\n\nWoodson said Carmelo Anthony, J.R. Smith and Jason Kidd also won't play Wednesday in the regular-season finale against Atlanta. He added that Quentin Richardson, who was signed Tuesday, could play significant minutes with the Knicks so short-handed.\n\n-- The Associated Press"
