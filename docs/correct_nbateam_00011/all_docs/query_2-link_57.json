        "text": "Darvin Ham has made his first hiring as the head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, bringing on former player Rasheed Wallace to be an assistant coach on his staff. The two players were teammates together on the Detroit Pistons squad that won the NBA title in 2004, ironically over the Lakers. The team promised Ham that he would have the freedom to pick his own staff and it seems that they have made good on that promise.\n\nWallace comes over to Los Angeles after spending some time as an assistant for Penny Hardaway at the University of Memphis. The 47-year-old has served as an assistant in the NBA before, when he was on the bench for the Pistons during the 2013-2014 season. Ham wanted to bring members onto his staff that he trusted and that could bring some experience and Wallace checks those boxes.\n\nWallace will certainly bring some toughness and grittiness to this Lakers team, even as an assistant coach. He is known for his in your face, aggressive play style during his career so it’s likely that his fiery personality will show once again. Discipline and the ability to call out others is something that the Lakers lacked last season and they likely won’t lack that again.\n\nBoth Wallace and Ham are tough minded coaches and aren’t afraid to speak their mind. They don’t care if a player is a star like LeBron James or an end of the bench guy. They will hold every single player accountable and that is the type of leadership that the franchise needs. While the roster remains in question, we now know the first domino that will fall in the plan that Ham is serving up. Wallace represents the Lakers embrace to toughness and surely the roster will reflect that as well.\n\nAnytime a coaching staff inherits a roster that has both LeBron James and Anthony Davis on it, it’s typically seen as a good thing. Yet, this team needs more of a leader from the bench and the fact that the previous staff had lost the locker room was apparent. This isn’t likely to happen again and the Ham era is already off to a good start."
