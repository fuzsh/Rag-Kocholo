        "text": "According to reports, former NBA All-Star, Rasheed Wallace has been hired to an assistant coach role for the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nWallace joins former teammate and newly-appointed Lakers head coach, Darwin Ham. The two played together for the Detroit Pistons 2004 championship team.\n\nThe former 4th overall pick out of North Carolina, Wallace’s playing career spanned three decades for the Bullets (now Wizards), Trail Blazers, Hawks, Pistons, Celtics and Knicks.\n\nWallace has been a coach since his final year in New York.\n\nBefore the hire, Wallace was an assistant coach under Penny Hardaway at Memphis. Wallace has been coaching since his final NBA season in 2013. Hardaway had reportedly teased the idea that Wallace would be going to LA to join his teammate.\n\nLakers Off-season Outlook\n\nWallace joins a Lakers team in disarray. Los Angeles went 33-49 and missed the postseason for the first time since 2018. Questions surrounding point guard, Russell Westbrook and Anthony Davis have clouded the team’s future.\n\nWhile reports of potentially moving Westbrook have stalled, the future of the Lakers will be predicated on how well Ham and his new coaching staff will mesh with an aging roster."
