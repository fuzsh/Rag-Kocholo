        "text": "The morning after Penny Hardaway put the finishing touches on his second No. 1 recruiting class in three seasons, Memphis basketball announced Rasheed Wallace's addition to his coaching staff as an assistant coach.\n\nWallace, a four-time NBA All-Star, joins Hall of Famer Larry Brown and third-year assistant Cody Toppert under Hardaway. The 16-season NBA veteran played for Brown when the Detroit Pistons won the NBA title in 2004.\n\n“I’m excited about adding Rasheed to the program,” Hardaway said in a press release. “He is someone our ‘bigs,’ and our entire team, will learn a tremendous amount from. All of his experience in the NBA and knowledge of the game will be key to our success.”\n\nThe Tigers' bigs consist of five-star Jalen Duren, sophomore Malcolm Dandridge and freshman Sam Onu.\n\nMEMPHIS BASKETBALL: Why Rasheed Wallace's mentor is confident he will be successful at Memphis under Penny Hardaway\n\nEMONI BATES: What Ja Morant told Emoni Bates after Memphis basketball commitment\n\nMORE: Memphis basketball soars in one poll after Emoni Bates commits. But some remain skeptical of Tigers.\n\nWallace's coaching experience includes a one-season stint with the Pistons and two seasons at the helm of the Charles E. Jordan High program in Durham, N.C. He was also hired in June as the coach at Good Better Best Academy in North Carolina, but resigned after being hired at Memphis.\n\n“It was a surprise, but an honor and a pleasure, to receive the call from Coach Hardaway to join his coaching staff,” Wallace said in a press release. “I am extremely eager to work with the young men on the team, and I’m excited to cross paths again with Coach Brown and work with Coach (Cody) Toppert.”\n\nReach sports writer Jason Munz at jason.munz@commercialappeal.com or on Twitter @munzly."
