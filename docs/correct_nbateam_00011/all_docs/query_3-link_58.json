        "text": "\"Ball Don't Lie!\" is coming to a North Carolina high school basketball court.\n\nThat's right. Rasheed Wallace is getting back into coaching.\n\nWallace, the former Detroit Pistons' great who played in Detroit from 2004-2009, will be coaching at Durham Jordan High School in Durham, N.C., according to the News and Observer. Wallace played collegiality at North Carolina for two seasons before being drafted by the Washington Bullets in 1995.\n\n“I did have some offers from a few NBA teams to be on their staff,” Wallace told the News and Observer. “The money was good, but it’s not about the money to me, it’s about that knowledge. Knowledge should be free and it doesn’t cost anything to pass that knowledge to these young men.”\n\nThis isn't the first time Wallace is toeing the coaching waters. In the 2013-14 season, Wallace was an assistant for the Pistons. Serving on Maurice Cheeks' staff, Wallace mentored Greg Monroe, Andre Drummond — then in his second season — and the other bigs.\n\nFor his career, Wallace averaged 14.4 points and 6.7 rebounds per game. In Detroit, he averaged 13.4 points and 7.2 rebounds per contest. He was a four-time All-Star, twice with Detroit and twice with Portland.\n\nSo, the question begs to be asked: How long until someone hears \"Ball Don't Lie,\" on a North Carolina high school basketball court?"
