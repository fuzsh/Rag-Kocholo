The 38-year-old Wallace last played for the Boston Celtics in the 2009-10 season. Terms of his contract signed Wednesday were not announced. Wallace averaged 14.6 points and 6.7 rebounds in 15 seasons. The temperamental 6-foot-11 Wallace frequently clashed with referees but was a respected teammate and versatile player who helped the Detroit Pistons win the 2004 NBA title. Knicks coach Mike Woodson was an assistant on that team. Wallace joins an aging bench that includes Kurt Thomas, who turns 40 on Thursday; 39-year-old Jason Kidd and 38-year-old Marcus Camby.\n\nOriginally Published: October 3, 2012 at 8:01 p.m."
