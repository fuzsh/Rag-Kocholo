Sheed He performed the tasks of player-advisor and accompanied the team in the regular season and Playoffs.\n\nDespite the fact that the Big Apple public has shown him unconditional support and the coach woodson considers it a key piece, Wallace He does not know if he will continue to be linked to the Knicks during the next campaign.\n\n«At this moment I don't know. There is still a long summer ahead, it has just begun. This moment is for my family. \"I'm only going to be with my children,\" she told ESPN New York.\n\nWallace, who will maintain his residence this summer in New York, has won the affection of the public of the Big Apple despite the fact that he has only been able to play 21 regular season games. The former player has great memories of his time in the Knicks.\n\n«I loved the feel of the New York pavilion. When I walked onto the court and heard the crowd shouting 'Sheed, Sheed, Sheed.' There I was, as if saying: 'They are with me, they are with me.' \"I tried to answer them, but I broke my foot,\" she explained.\n\n«It was the first time the Knicks won 50 games since 2000, the first time they had a 'Best Sixth Man' and the 'League Top Scorer,' so everything intensified this year. It was a shame we couldn't beat Indiana. “It has been an incredible year,” Wallace stressed."
