        "text": "LONDON -- Rasheed Wallace and Mike Woodson refuted a report that the veteran big man's season might be over because of an injury to his left foot.\n\nWallace usually tells reporters to direct questions about his health to Woodson and the Knicks' medical staff. But Wallace addressed the report before the Knicks' 102-87 win over the Pistons Thursday at The O2 Arena.\n\n\"No, my season ain't over,\" Wallace said. \"I'm gonna be back. I've been laid off for three years, so one little foot injury ain't going to stop me. I'm good.\"\n\nBut Wallace's status remains a mystery.\n\nHe has missed 16 games with an acute stress reaction that the Knicks originally called a sore left foot. Wallace, who shot around before the game, hasn't been able to run, and all indications are he won't return anytime soon. It has sparked speculation that the Knicks might sign someone, with Kenyon Martin most prominently mentioned.\n\nBut Woodson continues to say the Knicks haven't discussed bringing in anyone, and he dismissed the report that Wallace won't be back.\n\n\"He'll play eventually,\" Woodson said. \"New news to me. That's not coming out of our camp.\"\n\nWoodson talked Wallace out of retirement and likely wants to give him a chance to return. The Knicks are a better defensive team with Wallace, who helped Detroit to the 2004 NBA title.\n\n\"He's getting treatment and doing what's asked of him,\" Woodson said. \"We're trying to get him back out on the floor.\"\n\nShumpert's debut\n\nIman Shumpert showed very little rust in his season debut after surgery on his left knee. He also showed little trepidation playing for the first time since tearing his left ACL and lateral meniscus. He attacked the basket in the first half and scored in transition in the second.\n\n\"I put in the work, so if my knee falls and collapses now, it just wasn't meant to be,\" Shumpert said after starting and scoring eight points in 14:50. \"I'm pretty confident with what is going on.\"\n\nTaking in the town"
