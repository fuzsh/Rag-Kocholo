        "text": "SHEEEED!!!!\n\nRasheed Wallace has a new gig -- he's been hired as the head basketball coach at Jordan High School in Durham, NC!!\n\nThe ex-NBA star was announced at a news conference (inside the school's library!) Friday morning ... donning a royal blue blazer and smiling from ear-to-ear.\n\n\"It's a great day to be a Falcon,\" Sheed said Friday.\n\nOf course, Sheed has ties to Durham ... he was a superstar at North Carolina for 2 years, making the Final Four in 1995.\n\nWallace went on to have a great 16-year NBA career ... winning a title with the Detroit Pistons in 2004 and making the All-Star team 4 different times.\n\nIt'll be a rebuild for Wallace .. he's taking on a team that went 7-17 this past season, according to MaxPreps.\n\nSheed had MANY memorable moments during his time in the Association -- who can forget BALL DON'T LIE?!?!?\n\nWorth noting ... Wallace ranks in the top 5 in technical fouls in NBA history, so here's hoping he keeps his chill on the sidelines."
