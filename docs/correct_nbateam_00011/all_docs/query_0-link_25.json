        "text": "Rasheed Wallace recently worked out for the New York Knicks, and is apparently contemplating coming out of retirement. According to Tyson Chandler, Wallace looked good, and Chandler would be happy to welcome him as a teammate. Per the NY Post: “After taking the last two seasons off, Wallace worked out at the Knicks practice facility, and is considering signing with the team. And after seeing him work out, Chandler thinks Wallace can help. ‘He looked good,’ Chandler said. ‘Rasheed can be a great addition to us.’ Despite his extended break from the NBA, with Wallace’s last game action coming with Boston in the 2010 Finals, Chandler said Wallace still has skills that can help the Knicks. ‘I hope he [comes],’ Chandler said. ‘I don’t know what the situation is, but he’s a great communicator on defense and we know he can knock down the open 3 and jump shot. To have myself and Amar’e [Stoudemire] with Marcus Camby and Rasheed as backups … That’s pretty nice.'”"
