        "text": "GREENBURGH, N.Y. — Enes Kanter is going to be coming off the bench for now after David Fizdale shuffled the Knicks' starting lineup, and the center is accepting his role for however it lasts.\n\nThat doesn't mean it's an easy change.\n\nThe usually outgoing and talkative Kanter gave short answers when he was asked about coming off the bench after Friday's blowout loss to the Warriors, saying he was just going to \"lead the second unit.\"\n\nKanter gave a similar answer after the Knicks' practice Sunday when asked if he had discussed it with Fizdale.\n\n\"He wants me to lead the second unit,\" said Kanter, who started all 71 games he played last season. \"That’s what I’m going to do, go out there and lead the second unit. Just keep leading them.\"\n\nKanter was dropped from the starting five after averaging 16.8 points and 10.8 rebounds through the Knicks' first five games.\n\nFizdale said he understands why Kanter might be disappointed by the switch.\n\n\"Look, players are human just like the rest of us,\" Fizdale said. \"For him to have certain feelings about things, there’s nothing wrong with that. But at the end of the day it’s how we all respond to the situation and he’s responded great.\"\n\nKanter had eight points and 13 rebounds in 20 minutes off the bench Friday against Golden State.\n\nMitchell Robinson instead got the start and finished with seven points and six rebounds in 29 minutes.\n\n\"I’m not worried about it,\" Kanter said. \"Of course everybody would want to start. But, I mean, I’m - this year I think I’ve been playing at an all-star level, so my thing is I’m trying to make the all-star this year. I’m not worried about coming from the bench or starting or not. That’s the last thing I should be worried about. My thing is just go out and try to play like an all-star. I don’t care if they put me on the bench, start me, whatever. My thing is just go out there and beat everybody.\"\n\nDeveloping the team's young players while also keeping the veterans engaged is a balancing act Fizdale has to manage. And so far he hasn't had to find Courtney Lee time as the guard has been out because of neck spasms.\n\n\"It's a tough juggle for sure,\" Fizdale said.\n\nHe reiterated Sunday that no starting lineup is set in stone and he'll continue to evaluate chunks of games.\n\n\"Because there’s just nobody that’s clearly separated and there’s no groups that’s shown this great cohesion yet,\" Fizdale said. \"And so this is going to be a work in progress all the way through the year. If we come to something that ends up getting us on a roll, yeah we’ll stay with that. But we’re always going to be looking at chunks of games.\"\n\nRasheed Wallace helps out at practice\n\nFizdale brought in former all-star big man Rasheed Wallace to help out at the Knicks' practice Sunday.\n\nFizdale said he's had a long relationship with Wallace, who played for the Pistons when Knicks general manager Scott Perry was in the front office.\n\n\"He’s a technician from an understanding fundamentals standpoint, understanding the big man position,\" Fizdale said. \"Like I said, I’m connecting with a lot of guys from our past to bring as many influences around these guys as we can.\"\n\nWallace, who played 16 seasons and had a 21-game stint with the Knicks in 2012-13, was vocal and active when running through drills with the team's bigs.\n\n\"He was an NBA legend, so actually getting to work with him it kind of felt great,\" Robinson said. \"He helped me out with pointers on the baseline as in the dunkers spot, where to flash to, get up on my screen and rolls too.\"\n\nWallace was the latest former player that Fizdale has brought in to spend time with the team in some way.\n\nFizdale had Patrick Ewing and Chris Bosh address the team during preseason.\n\nMore New York Knicks news\n\nMore: Kevin Durant sinks Knicks with huge fourth quarter as Warriors rally for win\n\nMore: David Fizdale changes starting 5 for New York Knicks' game vs. Warriors\n\nMore: The local basketball legend working on David Fizdale's New York Knicks coaching staff\n\nEmail: iseman@northhjersey.com"
