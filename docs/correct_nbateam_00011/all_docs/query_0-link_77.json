        "text": "Rasheed Wallace is coming out of retirement and will officially be a Knick by Monday, a source told Marc Berman of the New York Post.\n\nMonday also happens to be the Knicks' media day, so the official signing might not garner much media attention. There hasn't been any media availability since Jeremy Lin's departure or Jason Kidd's DUI arrest, and even though Kidd will be speaking Monday, most of the press has been itching to get general manager Glen Grunwald and coach Mike Woodson on the record.\n\nThere's always the chance that Grunwald and Woodson refuse to discuss Lin because he left in July and Monday will be Oct. 1, but of course, it was the Knicks who chose not to meet with the media during that time. Can you really blame the media for wanting answers?\n\nRegardless of how much actually gets articulated, Monday should be a revealing day at the team facility in Greenburgh, NY.\n\nIn other Knicks news:\n\n• HOOPSWORLD's Bill Ingram did a piece for USAToday.com that questions how much Wallace really has left in his tank: \"When we last saw Wallace, he was wearing the Boston green and looked like a player who was ready to retire. He had the worst year of his career in 2009-10, appearing in 79 games, starting 13, but averaging just nine points per game. He shot a career-worst 40% from the field, and his 28% three-point accuracy was his worst since his third year in the league... By the time the playoffs rolled around, the writing appeared to be on the wall for Wallace, who averaged just 6.1 points in 24 games, shooting 41% in the process.\"\n\n• Wallace's agent Bill Strickland told Ian Begley of ESPNNewYork.com that his client's choice was between signing with the Knicks or staying retired: \"Rasheed Wallace's agent, Bill Strickland, said Friday that if the power forward comes out of retirement, it will be to play for the Knicks and no other team... 'That's my understanding, based on his relationship with Coach (Mike) Woodson,' Strickland said by phone.\"\n\n• Begley also wrote a training camp preview that asks perhaps the most-important question the Knicks will be facing this season: \"Can Mike Woodson make the Amare-Melo pairing work? Woodson insists that it's all on him. He's taking full responsibility for making things work between Carmelo Anthony, Amare Stoudemire and Tyson Chandler... Through a season-and-a-half of Anthony and Stoudemire in New York, the results have been mixed. Anthony and Stoudemire have a sub-.500 regular-season record when both are in the starting lineup... According to scouts, one issue that seems to get in the way is that both players thrive in the same space on the floor: from the mid-post to the elbow.\""
