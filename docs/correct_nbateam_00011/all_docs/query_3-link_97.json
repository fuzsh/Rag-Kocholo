        "meta_description": "Rasheed Abdul Wallace (born September 17, 1974) is an American professional basketball player. He currently plays for the Detroit Pistons of the NBA. At 6 ft 11 in (212 cm) and 230 lb (104 kg), Wallace plays power forward or center depending on the opposition.\n\t\n\tOriginally selected out of the University of North Carolina by the Washington Bullets (now the Washington Wizards) as the fourth pick in the 1995 NBA Draft, Wallace was named to the All-Rookie second team following his first season. Following the same season he was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for Rod Strickland and Harvey Grant. He had a career-high 42 points against the Denver Nuggets in 2000 and was a key member of the Blazers team that made it to the Western Conference Finals that same year. Wallace had a career best 19.4 points per game in 2002 for the Blazers.\n\t\n\tIn 2004 Rasheed Wallace helped power the Detroit Pistons to the NBA title and obtained his first championship ring. In Detroit, Wallace became known for selfless team play and integrated with Ben Wallace to form the core of the Pistons' smothering defensive game. He dubbed the duo &quot;Wallace x 2&quot; shortly after he arrived in Detroit in 2004.\n\t\n\tOn October 27, 2007, Wallace stated that the NBA is no longer like a sport, but more like the World Wrestling Federation: fake and just for money and entertainment. NBA Commissioner David Stern rebuked him by calling his statement &quot;disrespectful.&quot;\n\t\n\t<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasheed_Wallace\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasheed_Wallace</a>\n\t\n\tI love what Rasheed said there about the NBA...I agree with him 100%!!!",
