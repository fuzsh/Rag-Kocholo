        "text": "Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images\n\nIt looks like the New York Knicks are actually serious about this whole Rasheed Wallace thing—go figure.\n\nWhether it has to do with sound basketball rationale or it's just an opportunity for James Dolan to add another attention-grabber to the roster, ESPN's Jared Zwerling reports that NYC's front office appears to be set on adding the 38-year-old forward/center:\n\nSource close to #Knicks: All the players expect a Rasheed Wallace signing to become official. He took his physical w/ the team yesterday.\n\n— Jared Zwerling (@JaredZwerling) September 28, 2012\n\nThe New York Post's Marc Berman is hearing the same thing.\n\nIf there were no such a thing as context, there might be a sound argument for this move. And if there were no such thing as locker-room chemistry, that argument might even be a good one.\n\nBut alas, we're living in the real world, where such considerations aren't easily wished away.\n\nYou might like the idea of adding Wallace because it adds depth to the power forward and center positions, but the roster already has three good defenders at center (Tyson Chandler, Marcus Camby and Kurt Thomas) and two good scorers at power forward (Amar'e Stoudemire and Steve Novak).\n\nThat's not counting Carmelo Anthony, who perhaps stands the most to lose with another front-court body. Anthony was at his best playing power forward during stretches late in the season when Stoudemire was unavailable.\n\nHis range spread the floor, he used his quickness against bigger defenders and actually held his own on the defensive end.\n\nJust as the Heat used LeBron James at the 4 during Chris Bosh's absence for nine games during the 2012 playoffs, 'Melo similarly proved that in today's NBA, there are at least a handful of sturdy small-forwards who do some of their best work without so many other big men clogging the paint.\n\nPlus, the opportunity to surround Anthony or James with three players who can hit perimeter shots prevents defenders from collapsing to the paint and denying penetration or helping.\n\nAs the Knicks' starting 4 last season, Anthony scored 39 points against the Pacers, 43 in a classic one-point win against the Bulls, 32 against the Bucks, 42 against the Heat and 35 against the Celtics.\n\nYou shouldn't just be impressed by the productivity, but by the fact the Anthony was doing this against the league's best defensive teams. More importantly, New York won three of those games.\n\nAdding bodies has a ripple effect on a rotation that should feature Carmelo far more frequently in and around the paint.\n\nWallace may not play the 22.5 minutes a game he averaged in his most recent action two years ago with the Boston Celtics, but signing him nevertheless complicates a front-court rotation that should be looking to use Anthony differently.\n\nAside from the on-court implications, you also have to wonder if Wallace is a good thing for the locker room. Don't confuse being liked by teammates with being a good locker room presence.\n\nThere's little doubt that Wallace would be popular with his cohorts and fans alike. The problem is that his record of serving as a destabilizing influence is impossible to ignore. Does he fire people up? Sure.\n\nBut that's not always what you want out of a veteran (something the Knicks already have plenty of).\n\nIf Amar'e Stoudemire already is punching things, what do the Knicks need with another hot-head?\n\nNo, none of these things likely will have a significant impact on New York's title hopes. But to the extent Wallace has any effect at all, there's just too much risk that it won't be a good one."
