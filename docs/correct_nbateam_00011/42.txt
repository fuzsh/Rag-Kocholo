The need for Sheed has been officially fulfilled.

The New York Knicks announced Wednesday the signing of veteran forward Rasheed Wallace. The deal had been anticipated in recent weeks.

The 38-year-old unrestricted free-agent forward hasn't played in the NBA since April 2010. He reportedly worked out for the team and underwent a physical this week.

Wallace chose to return with the Knicks because of his relationship with coach Mike Woodson, which dates back to their time together in Detroit. Woodson was an assistant and Wallace was a star forward for the Pistons. League sources tell CBSSports.com that the Knicks expect Wallace to be a positive addition to their veteran locker room, due to his well-known sense of humor and experience. However, the questions about the state of his conditioning do remain.

New York has four big men who figure to make its final roster: Tyson Chandler, Amar'e Stoudemire, Marcus Camby and Kurt Thomas.

Wallace last played for the Boston Celtics during the 2009-10 season. He announced his retirement in August 2010 but has been linked in talks of a comeback on multiple occasions, most recently in February 2012, when he was rumored to be signing with the Los Angeles Lakers.
