        "text": "Many of us have reached MULTIPLE ‘destinations’ in our lifetimes—whether that be a goal one sets to achieve or a physical location. However, there IS a ‘FINAL’ DESTINATION.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nWhen one would like to go on a trip, they need to do some pre-planning—which includes thinking about their budget, when to go, how long to stay, what to see and do, some “what ifs,” transportation, accommodations, housesitting, travel insurance, and possible ‘packages’.\n\nHowever, before one can start any kind of planning, the MOST ‘IMPORTANT’ thing for them to do is CHOOSE a ‘DESTINATION’\n\nFour weeks ago—during the first week of this month—I helped my best friend/previous business partner, Bob Hart, ‘move’ the used 30-foot Catalina sailboat he had just acquired, to the marina (‘DESTINATION’) he wanted it to be moored at.\n\nHowever, his marina (just north of Detroit in Lake St. Clair) was 194 miles southeast (on the roads) from the marina it was currently moored at (in East Tawas, Michigan). So, he had to decide whether he should have it transported over the road on a trailer—which would cost thousands of dollars and would require the mast to be taken down—or to RISK sailing an ‘UNKNOWN’ sailboat 170+ nautical miles around the ‘thumb’ of Michigan in Lake Huron.\n\nWell, being a very experienced skipper—and having had a 27-foot Catalina in his past—he decided to take the ‘risk’ and SAIL it ‘home’.\n\nSo, he made a few multi-day trips up to East Tawas—from his home in Romeo, Michigan, 165 miles away—to make the sailboat seaworthy. After it was ready, he then looked at some weather forecasts to determine when it would be best to take a 2-3 day sailing journey in the weeks to come.\n\nHe decided the weather would be the best during the Independence Day holiday, just a few weeks ago.\n\nSo then, the ‘journey’ began.\n\n<<< TABLE OF CONTENTS >>>\n\nMOST ‘POPULAR’ DESTINATIONS\n\nCOUNTRIES\n\n[ CHART ]\n\n2024 TRAVEL OUTLOOK\n\nMOST POPULAR ‘CITY’\n\n‘TRENDING’ CITIES\n\nFOR THE ‘NATURE’\n\nFOR THE ‘FOOD’\n\nFOR THE ‘CULTURE’\n\nFOR THE ‘ATTRACTION’\n\n[ CHART ]\n\nFOR ‘RETIREMENT’\n\nFOR ‘VOLUNTEERISM’\n\n‘PLANNING’ A JOURNEY\n\n‘THINGS’ TO CONSIDER\n\nDO’S AND DON’TS WHILE TRAVELING\n\nSAILBOAT-SPECIFIC JOURNEY PLANNING\n\n– 10 Yachting ‘Commandments’\n\n– “A.P.E.M.”\n\n– Passage Planning ‘Checklist’\n\n‘JUST BEFORE’ YOU LEAVE\n\nPRE-TRIP ‘CHECKLIST’\n\nMIDCOURSE ‘CORRECTIONS’\n\nNOT A STRAIGHT ‘LINE’\n\nMIDCOURSE CORRECTIONS HELP ONE ‘ACHIEVE MORE’\n\nDON’T JERK THE ‘WHEEL’\n\nTINY ACTIONS; LASER ‘FOCUS’\n\n[ ILLUSTRATION ]\n\nDEALING WITH COMMON TRAVEL ‘PROBLEMS’\n\nPLANS WILL ‘CHANGE’!\n\n‘RESILIENCE’\n\nHOW TRAVEL BUILDS ‘RESILIENCE’\n\n– 7 C’s of Resilience\n\n‘CONTINUE’ ON\n\nDEVELOPING’ COPING’ SKILLS\n\nPATIENCE\n\n‘GUIDEPOSTS’\n\nGUIDEBOOKS\n\n‘PERSONAL’ GUIDES\n\nJUST OVER THE ‘HORIZON’ (PERSEVERANCE)\n\nTHE “3 P’s”\n\nTHE ‘POWER’ OF PERSISTENCE\n\nHOW DOES ONE ‘BECOME’ PERSISTENT?\n\n“P.U.S.H.”\n\nBECOME ‘UNSTOPPABLY’ PERSISTENT\n\n‘ACCLIMATE’ TO YOUR DESTINATION\n\nWHAT TO ‘DO’ FIRST\n\nOVERCOMING ‘JET LAG’\n\nMY SAILBOAT JOURNEY\n\n[ CHART: Winds/Distance – Credit: Windy.com ]\n\n[ CHART: Depths – Credit: NOAA (Great Lakes Portal) ]\n\n[ PHOTO: East Tawas Marina – 3JUL24 ]\n\n[ PHOTO: Bob and Chuck setting ‘way points’ to Port Sanilac ]\n\n[ PHOTO: Testing The Sails In Lake Huron – 4JUL24 ]\n\n[ PHOTO: Arriving In Port Sanilac – 4JUL24 ]\n\n[ PHOTO: Leaving Port Sanilac – 5JUL24 ]\n\n[ PHOTO: Arriving In Port Huron – 5JUL24 ]\n\n[ PHOTO: Detroit River – “Freighter!” – 5JUL24 ]\n\n[ PHOTO: Detroit River – Rain – 5JUL24 ]\n\n[ PHOTO: Detroit River – St. Clair Inn – 5JUL24 ]\n\n[ PHOTO: Detroit River – Guiding Buoys – 5JUL24 ]\n\n[ PHOTO: Lake St. Clair – Home Stretch – 5JUL24 ]\n\n[ PHOTO: Clinton River – ‘Mouth’ – 5JUL24 ]\n\n[ PHOTO: Clinton River – No Wake Zone – 5JUL24 ]\n\n[ PHOTO: Clinton River – “Crews Inn” – 5JUL24 ]\n\n[ PHOTO: Clinton River – Big Boats; Small Houses – 5JUL24 ]\n\n[ PHOTO: Clinton River – ‘Fill ‘Er Up’ – 5JUL24 ]\n\n[ PHOTO: Clinton River – Entering Lambrecht Marina – 5JUL24 ]\n\n[ PHOTO: Lambrecht Marina – Final Docking Maneuvers – 5JUL24 ]\n\n[ PHOTO: Lambrecht Marina – All ‘Buttoned Up’ – 5JUL24 ]\n\nONE’S ‘LIFE’ JOURNEY\n\nFOCUS ON THE ‘GOAL’\n\nSIMILAR TO MY ‘SAILBOAT’ JOURNEY\n\n– Plan One’s Life Goal (Based on interests and a goal)\n\n– Train For One’s Goal (Consult experts)\n\n– Start Out Toward One’s Goal (Trust your instincts)\n\n– Frustrations (Trust your training)\n\n– Courage (‘Grit’ it out)\n\n– Determination (Continue no matter what)\n\n– Revise Goal (Respond to changing circumstances)\n\n– Make A Decision (Best option to reach one’s destination)\n\n– Recalculate One’s ‘Route’ (‘Listen’ to God’s ‘promptings’)\n\n– Go Forward (Press on with renewed ‘intensity’)\n\n– Being Patient (Times of ‘real’ growth)\n\n– Consider ‘Guideposts’ (Focus; Don’t veer off your ‘path’)\n\n– Persevere (“P.U.S.H.”)\n\n– See The Goal on the ‘Horizon’ (In the ‘Red Zone’)\n\n– Reach One’s Goal!

In 2023, there were 1.3 billion international tourists, with a growth of 33,4% compared to 2022 and growth of 112.2% compared to 2021. The top 10 international tourism destinations in 2023 were:\n\n[ more… ]\n\n[ CHART: Most visited destinations by international tourist arrivals in 2023 – Wikipedia ]\n\n2024 TRAVEL OUTLOOK\n\n2023 saw a resurgence of people taking holidays to all corners of the globe and the research firm, Tripadvisor, has indicated that travel is set to see that sustained momentum in 2024. Tripadvisor data reveals more than half (62%) of the Brits are planning one to two trips, and one-third (31%) are planning three to four, with 83% of British holidaymakers planning to spend the same, if not more, on travel this year.\n\nTripadvisor’s “Best of the Best Destinations” list offers inspiration from the global travel community for those planning trips for 2024. Winning destinations are determined by analyzing Tripadvisor reviews and rankings from the last 12 months, and with a multitude of destinations spanning 80 countries. This year’s list of Traveler’s Choice Awards Best of the Best Destinations, totals a whopping 221 destinations.\n\n[ more… ]\n\nMOST POPULAR ‘CITY’\n\nDubai, UAE\n\nBali, Indonesia\n\nLondon, UK\n\n[ more… ]\n\n‘TRENDING’ CITIES\n\nTokyo, Japan\n\nSeoul, South Korea\n\nHalong Bay, Vietnam\n\n[ more… ]\n\nFOR THE ‘NATURE’\n\nKathmandu, Nepal\n\nHalong Bay, Vietnam\n\nHurghada, Egypt\n\n[ more… ]\n\nFOR THE ‘FOOD’\n\nHanoi, Vietnam\n\nRome, Italy\n\nCrete, Greece\n\n[ more… ]\n\nFOR THE ‘CULTURE’\n\nCuba, Caribbean\n\nCusco, Peru\n\nAgra, India\n\n[ more… ]\n\nFOR THE ‘ATTRACTION’\n\nSo, what is the most popular tourist ‘attraction’ in the world? Well, just before the pandemic hit—in late 2019—the Las Vegas Strip was the world’s most popular tourist destination with 39,668,221 annual visitors.\n\n[ more… ]\n\n[ CHART: The most popular tourist ‘attractions’ in the world – WorldAtlas ]\n\nFOR ‘RETIREMENT’\n\nIf one is considering retirement abroad, one needs information, and lots of it. But more than that, one needs guidance on how to interpret that information. That is why “International Living” (IL) compiled their “2024 Annual Global Retirement Index”—to help one with choosing where in the world will best suit one’s needs.\n\n[ more… ]\n\nFOR ‘VOLUNTEERISM’\n\n“Give A Day Global” connects travelers with short-term volunteer opportunities at nonprofit organizations around the world.\n\nTheir mission is to empower travelers to make a difference, to support communities creating change, and to connect people as global citizens, one day at a time.\n\nThey believe that all people should have access to education, healthy food, medical care, a sustainable environment, and economic opportunities. By connecting travelers with nonprofit organizations that pursue these same goals, we aim to engage more people in making the world a better place, one day at a time.\n\nSo, they connect travelers with short-term volunteer opportunities at nonprofit organizations around the world. Their top 15 Places to travel to (in 2023) were:\n\n[ more… ]\n\n‘PLANNING’ A JOURNEY\n\nSo then, after one selects a ‘destination’ (and maybe a ‘reason’ to go there), they then need to start ‘planning’ their journey. So, what do the experts say about how to begin?\n\nWell, planning a journey itinerary can be a daunting task even if you are an experienced traveler. So, Tim and Allison Diemer (“Tim and Fin Travel”) suggest a systematic manner that will help one make decisions faster and better.\n\n[ more… ]\n\n‘THINGS’ TO CONSIDER\n\nThe following is a list of ‘specific’ things that one should consider when planning a journey:\n\n[ more… ]\n\nDO’S AND DON’TS WHILE TRAVELING\n\nWhen traveling to a new place or country, always remember important safety vacation tips for an enjoyable experience. Here are a few of our do’s and don’ts for beginners that you might want to take notes of:\n\n[ more… ]\n\nSAILBOAT-SPECIFIC JOURNEY PLANNING\n\nSo then, what kinds of things did my best friend Bob Hart probably go through when he was planning a sailing route to get his ‘new’ sailboat from the marina it was at (in East Tawas) to his marina in Lake St. Clair?\n\nWell, Denisa Nguyenová, the Operations Manager at “Yachting.com” presented a variety of factors to consider when choosing a route, which Bob, most likely explored.\n\n[ more… ]\n\n– 10 Yachting ‘Commandments’\n\nSo, before going on a journey, it is good to ask oneself some questions. Denisa offers the following “10 Yachting Commandments”:\n\n[ more… ]\n\n– “A.P.E.M.”\n\nIf you have done any ‘structured’ learning, you have probably come across the acronym A.P.E.M. It stands for Appraise, Plan, Execute, and Monitor.\n\nConcerning sailing, it helps a beginner to remember the most important things regarding planning a journey route:\n\n[ more… ]\n\n– Passage Planning ‘Checklist’\n\nThe following is a reasonably comprehensive ‘checklist’ for planning a journey on a sailboat. [ A variety of other more ‘detailed’ resources are in both the “RESOURCES” and the “ARTICLES” sections below. ]\n\n[ more… ]\n\n‘JUST BEFORE’ YOU LEAVE\n\nSo, how does one get ready for a vacation without forgetting anything? Well, the following is a reasonably complete list of everything you need to do before going on vacation, whether you’re traveling alone, as a couple, with friends, or with your family.\n\nAs you attempt to keep your enthusiasm in check, read our list of things to do at home, at work, and in general before your vacation to ensure you are well-prepared to soak up all the fun moments ahead!\n\nPRE-TRIP ‘CHECKLIST’\n\nThe following is a reasonably complete ‘pre-trip’ checklist—by Kylie Morrow and Allianz Travel—to make sure everything gets done the day before you travel.\n\n[ more… ]\n\nMIDCOURSE ‘CORRECTIONS’\n\nI’ve got to believe we have all taken a summer road trip during school break. The whole family piled into a vehicle and began driving to a specific destination. At some point along the journey, there was some road construction we did not know about. We then consulted a map or paid attention to the directions on our smartphone when it said “Recalculating.” So, to successfully get to our destination, we had to make midcourse corrections.\n\nLife is just like that. We set a goal one day and the next day we find ourselves going in a direction that will not lead us to that goal. Without careful monitoring and midcourse corrections, we can find ourselves ‘off track’ and, most likely, will not reach our destination.\n\nNOT A STRAIGHT ‘LINE’\n\nBeing in the mortgage business, Steve Strick (VP of New American Funding) has seen a lot of changes in his industry in recent years and has had to make a variety of midcourse corrections. He says that when striving to reach important goals that challenge you, your process may not always be straightforward. You may think you are doing all the right things, expecting to reach a goal soon, when an obstacle is thrown your way, or maybe you realize the ‘road’ you were on is no longer taking you where you need to go. In either scenario, it is important to have the skill of midcourse correction. This skill is all about overcoming challenges, learning from failure, and planning a new, more effective route to take.\n\n[ more… ]\n\nMIDCOURSE CORRECTIONS HELP ONE ‘ACHIEVE MORE’\n\nPeople with high pride and perfectionist qualities may see the act of midcourse correction as a sign of a fault or weakness. However, it is often these adjustments that set one up for ‘GREATER’ SUCCESS. Rather than stubbornly continuing along the same path that is full of obstacles or pointing you in an unhelpful direction, midcourse correction helps one to acknowledge their mistakes head-on and to grow from them.\n\nIn the same way that a GPS must occasionally ‘recalculate’—finding the best route—to reach one’s goals sometimes requires adjustments in their ‘navigating’. The need for midcourse correction is often a sign that one is taking the right kind of risks and is actively pursuing their goal. The ability to recognize when it is time to make a shift—and to be willing to make the change—can dramatically accelerate one’s progress towards their goal.\n\nDON’T JERK THE ‘WHEEL’\n\nMany new car drivers are in a constant state of tension and anxiety—although they don’t realize it at the time. The thing is, when someone is in a ‘state of panic’ they don’t make very good decisions—and this usually causes them to make a lot of mistakes on the road.\n\nAs an example, it is like when you’re late to work and in your rush to get out the door you stub your toe, spill your coffee, and seem to hit every red light only to get into work and be late for your first meeting. You are speeding down the road and your thoughts are racing down your to-do list (You are still trying to scarf down your breakfast with one hand off the wheel and ladies are also trying to put on their lipstick!)\n\n[ more… ]\n\nTINY ACTIONS; LASER ‘FOCUS’\n\nAnother mistake so many people make in a swift desire to change their lives is that they take BIG, massive action.\n\nSomeone who has never worked out, joins the gym, buys a whole new wardrobe, cuts their calories in half, and goes hard at the gym every day for 7 days and then quits, burns out, never goes again—and calls themselves a failure.\n\nThe thing is, big, giant action does not work, especially if you have spent an entire lifetime doubting what you are capable of. What it requires is massive internal shifts and tiny external steps.\n\n[ more… ]\n\n[ ILLUSTRATION: Journey Toward A Destination – Midcourse Corrections ]\n\nDEALING WITH COMMON TRAVEL ‘PROBLEMS’\n\nAuthor and travel blogger Adam Fraiel—of NomadicVA.com—is an experienced “worldpacker,” a very experienced worldwide traveler of many years.\n\nAdam mentions that the best solution to most travel problems is ‘PREPARATION’. Sometimes one will need to be creative and resourceful with your solutions but this is also one of the ‘joys’ of traveling. One can’t prepare for every eventuality, but know that no problem is insurmountable.\n\nWhile the situations and specific circumstances may differ, there are common problems that happen to all travelers eventually. Having experienced many problems over the years, Adam has some suggestions for 10 of the most common travel problems and how to avoid them.\n\n[ more… ]\n\nPLANS WILL ‘CHANGE’!\n\nSo, whether it is an unexpected delay, a last-minute calendar conflict, or even a global pandemic, sometimes life and, more likely, vacation plans shift. However, especially with vacation plans, that does not mean your dreams are a ‘bust’. You can go somewhere else, go with a group, do a ‘drive-to’ destination closer to home, or postpone the trip. Who knows, it might turn out to be a ‘better’ vacation than you would have had initially. It might turn out to be a longer trip, packed with more attractions. So, stay positive, and get ready for a ‘different’ experience that might show you your destination in a different and better ‘light’!\n\nMost of the time, these ‘midcourse corrections’ will make one stronger, more resourceful, and much more resilient.\n\n[ FYI: There is more info about life’s ‘midcourse corrections’ in the “ARTICLES” section below. ]\n\n‘RESILIENCE’\n\nThe American Psychological Association defines resilience as “the process and outcome of successfully adapting to difficult or challenging life experiences, especially through mental, emotional, and behavioural flexibility and adjustment to external and internal demands.” The Oxford Dictionary defines resilience as “the capacity to withstand or to recover quickly from difficulties; toughness.”\n\nWhile some people are innately resilient, studies increasingly show that resilience is not a fixed personality trait but a skill that can be developed. Hazel Joy, the travel blog content creator of “Arrivals Hall,” believes that travel can develop the ‘skill’ of resilience.\n\nHOW TRAVEL BUILDS ‘RESILIENCE’\n\nIn the field of positive psychology, there are many theories on how to build resilience. Having strong, healthy interpersonal relationships, looking after your physical and mental health, and practicing self-compassion are cornerstones of building resilience.\n\nHowever, it is Dr. Kenneth Ginsburg, a pediatrician specializing in adolescent medicine at The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, who posited that there are seven components to resilience—the “7 C’s of Resilience.”\n\n[ more… ]\n\n‘CONTINUE’ ON\n\nSo, I have added my own ‘C’, “Continue On,” since resilience is the capacity to recover from difficulties and then to ‘plow’ on. The Finish calls it “Sisu”—stoic determination, tenacity of purpose, grit, bravery, resilience, and hardiness. When traveling, one has no choice but to adapt and ‘continue on’.\n\n[ more… ]\n\nDEVELOPING’ COPING’ SKILLS\n\nFounder and editor of IceCampingPro.com, Abbot Ace—a nature-loving, comfy-camping kind of guy—says that there are seven ‘insights’ he has learned how travel can help people develop coping skills and adaptability:\n\n[ more… ]\n\nPATIENCE\n\nMost people don’t really like the ’traveling’ as much as they love the destination—and since the end of the pandemic, airports have been crazy busy. However, most people say that ’travel’ is more difficult than ever before—which then requires MUCH MORE ‘PATIENCE’! (Something I could learn to have a bit more of!)\n\nWhen flight delays come or unforeseen setbacks happen, patience needs to be one’s ‘travel companion’. Patience can help one to stay calm, composed, and reasonably ‘joyful’. With patience, one can ‘let go’ of frustrations and learn to accept and adapt to challenging situations.\n\n[ more… ]\n\n‘GUIDEPOSTS’\n\nWhen one finally decides to go to a certain destination, one of the best resources to obtain is a ‘GUIDEBOOK’. Most travel experts say that it is an ‘essential’ preparation for any journey. It gives one a comprehensive ‘synopsis’ of a travel expert’s opinion and suggestions for making one’s journey a memorable success.\n\nJust recently—probably within the last few decades—the Internet (and apps) is ‘flush’ with blogs and websites dedicated to providing a variety of information about the most popular destinations in the world (and even some ‘out-of-the-way’ destinations).\n\n[ more… ]\n\nGUIDEBOOKS\n\nProbably one of the most popular ‘guides’ in the world is Rick Steves. He has been creating guidebooks—for primarily Europe—for the past 40+ years. That’s a LOT of experience!\n\n[ more… ]\n\n‘PERSONAL’ GUIDES\n\nNow, even though you might have done a lot of research and have determined what you are going to see at a destination, a certified tour guide can sometimes be worth it. Although it is optional, many travel experts say that it can be a highly recommended service for some destinations.\n\nThe following are a few reasons for hiring a tour guide:\n\n[ more… ]\n\nJUST OVER THE ‘HORIZON’ (PERSEVERANCE)\n\nWhen one is ‘closing in’ on their goal—kind of like the “Red Zone” in football—it usually takes a lot of focused perseverance to attain their goal. As I mentioned, scientist, teacher, and author Dr. Angela Duckworth calls this “Grit,” and she wrote a best-selling book that focused on the “power of passion and perseverance.” Duckworth shows that the secret to outstanding achievement is not talent but a special blend of passion and persistence.\n\nDuckworth has found that grit is the hallmark of high achievers in every domain. She has also shared fascinating insights from history that grit can actually ‘grow’ and shows what can be gleaned from modern experiments in peak performance.\n\nTHE “3 P’s”\n\nMichelle Myers, the Creative Content Production Manager at “Women’s Leadership Today,” presents her take on grit as “3 P’s”: Passion, Perseverance, and Progress.\n\n[ more… ]\n\nTHE ‘POWER’ OF PERSISTENCE\n\nMyers then ‘picks up’ the focus of Duckworth’s book, “the power of grit,” and suggests that cultivating grit empowers one to accomplish impressive feats. Grit grows from acting on purpose, persevering through doubts, and tracking progress. Passion gives you meaning, perseverance gives you traction, and progress gives you evidence you are moving closer to your goals.\n\n[ more… ]\n\nHOW DOES ONE ‘BECOME’ PERSISTENT?\n\nSo, HOW does one become persistent? Well, that’s a good question. The thing is, persistence is never developed by accident. You ARE NOT born with it and you cannot inherit it. There is no one in the entire world who can develop persistence FOR YOU! Persistence is as ‘interwoven’ with success as the chicken is with the egg.\n\n[ more… ]\n\n“P.U.S.H.”\n\nWebster’s dictionary defines “push” as, “exerting force on someone or something, typically with one’s hands, in order to move them away from oneself or the origin of the force.”\n\nWell, in my ‘world’ of advertising and marketing, the term “push” is used to describe an intensive marketing campaign to achieve greater sales. “Push” marketing is focused on ‘loading up’ the channel, advertising heavily, and trying to ‘convince’ the customer to buy (“Push” marketing is also used in the ‘texting’ world and called “notifications”). [ Yes, there is also a “pull” strategy for marketing, where the customer comes to believe the product you have is the one they ‘have’ to buy – i.e. Apple ].\n\nNow, relating to my topic of “persistence,” there’s a very popular acronym that is used, “P.U.S.H.,” which stands for:\n\n[ more… ]\n\nBECOME ‘UNSTOPPABLY’ PERSISTENT\n\nTom Krol is a very successful real estate investor, notable career coach, and one of the most successful self-help and motivational speakers in history—with multiple successful million-dollar businesses to his credit, and listed on the “Inc. 5000.” The following are his suggestions to become successfully persistent:\n\n[ more… ]\n\n‘ACCLIMATE’ TO YOUR DESTINATION\n\nBack in 2002, a voiceover artist from Queensland Australia, Karen Jacobsen, became one of the most recognizable voices in the world. She was the original voice of GPS, and she has helped billions of people reach their destination. She quips, “I’m known as the only woman men will take directions from.”\n\n[ VIDEO: “You have reached your destination” – Karen Jacobsen ]\n\nPhew! YOU MADE IT! You have ‘REACHED’ YOUR DESTINATION! Now what?\n\nWHAT TO ‘DO’ FIRST\n\nWell, Samantha Brown, host of the PBS travel show “Samantha Brown’s Places To Love” says that as soon as she disembarks the plane, she heads to the ‘SECOND’ CLOSEST BATHROOM. She says “second” because everyone usually ‘beelines’ for the first closet one, and that means getting stuck in a line! She adds, more often than not, the second or third closest bathrooms in the airport are next to empty and you can go right on in and do your ‘business’.\n\n[ more… ]\n\nOVERCOMING ‘JET LAG’\n\nTraveling disrupts the measures your body uses to manage its internal ‘clock’, such as daylight, your temperature, and your hormones. Some people may also be more susceptible to jet lag, especially if they travel frequently and if they are older.\n\nThe thing is, there are several ways one can try to make the transition to a new time zone more quickly and with fewer symptoms.\n\n[ more… ]\n\nMY SAILBOAT JOURNEY\n\n[ CHART: Winds/Distance – Credit: Windy.com ]\n\n[ CHART: Depths – Credit: NOAA (Great Lakes Portal) ]\n\n[ PHOTO: East Tawas Marina – 3JUL24 ]\n\n[ PHOTO: Bob and Chuck setting ‘way points’ to Port Sanilac ]\n\n[ PHOTO: Testing The Sails In Lake Huron – 4JUL24 ]\n\n[ PHOTO: Arriving In Port Sanilac – 4JUL24 ]\n\n[ PHOTO: Leaving Port Sanilac – 5JUL24 ]\n\n[ PHOTO: Arriving In Port Huron – 5JUL24 ]\n\n[ PHOTO: Detroit River – “Freighter!” – 5JUL24 ]\n\n[ PHOTO: Detroit River – Rain – 5JUL24 ]\n\n[ PHOTO: Detroit River – St. Clair Inn – 5JUL24 ]\n\n[ PHOTO: Detroit River – Guiding Buoys – 5JUL24 ]\n\n[ PHOTO: Lake St. Clair – Home Stretch – 5JUL24 ]\n\n[ PHOTO: Clinton River – ‘Mouth’ – 5JUL24 ]\n\n[ PHOTO: Clinton River – No Wake Zone – 5JUL24 ]\n\n[ PHOTO: Clinton River – “Crews Inn” – 5JUL24 ]\n\n[ PHOTO: Clinton River – Big Boats; Small Houses – 5JUL24 ]\n\n[ PHOTO: Clinton River – ‘Fill ‘Er Up’ – 5JUL24 ]\n\n[ PHOTO: Clinton River – Entering Lambrecht Marina – 5JUL24 ]\n\n[ PHOTO: Lambrecht Marina – Final Docking Maneuvers – 5JUL24 ]\n\n[ PHOTO: Lambrecht Marina – All ‘Buttoned Up’ – 5JUL24 ]\n\nSo, after all the planning, organizing, double-checking, mid-course ‘corrections’, problem-solving, coping, patience, and perseverance, we SUCCESSFULLY REACHED OUR ‘DESTINATION’!!!\n\nNow, for me, that was certainly an ‘experience’ and it TAUGHT ME SOME ‘PATIENCE’—since, if you know me (or have read this blog for a while), you know I used to do “performance driving” (‘racing’) cars back ‘in the day’.

We finally reach the third biggest lake in the world” ]\n\nONE’S ‘LIFE’ JOURNEY\n\nI am thinking that you have heard the quote, “Life is a journey, not a destination.” Well, at least for me, when I ‘analyzed’ the people who were saying that, I soon realized that those people did not have any ‘concrete’ goals or ambitions. I—and MANY other people I know—are not the type of people to sit back and take what ‘life’ gives us.\n\nNow, of course, when someone ‘determines’ a goal for themselves, not everyone will be 100% successful at attaining it. However, if one doesn’t even try to determine a ‘destination’, then, as the Bible says, “Do not waver, for a person with divided loyalty is as unsettled as a wave of the sea that is blown and tossed by the wind” [ James 1:6 ].\n\n[ Paraphrase: “Don’t think you are going to get anything from [life] that way, adrift and keeping all your options open.” ]\n\nFOCUS ON THE ‘GOAL’\n\nProfessor and author Dr. Jennifer Bennett says that “keeping one’s options open is a bad idea.” She mentions that there were times in her life when she felt that she had to have a ‘cushion’—a “security blanket”—just in case something didn’t work out. However, she found out that it just created more ‘chaos’ and more ‘worry’ in her life.\n\nBennett continues saying that one gets stuck in the ‘grass is greener on the other side’ mentality—and the more one keeps their options open—the more they are left wondering if there is not something better out there, something that will make them happier and more fulfilled. As long as one is thinking this way, they will never reach their full potential and will settle for mediocrity instead of excellence and achievement. Instead, one will do ‘just enough’ until the ‘next best thing’ comes along… maybe.\n\nIn addition to this, when one is always looking for the ‘next best thing’, worry will be at the center of their life. They will constantly worry about making the right decisions and what is ‘around the corner’—even if this kind of thinking is ‘ruining’ their life. Worry tends to ‘paralyze’ people.\n\n[ more… ]\n\nSIMILAR TO MY ‘SAILBOAT’ JOURNEY\n\nIt seems that ‘life’ is similar to my sailboat journey: The journey was ‘interesting’—and even ‘character building’—but the ‘destination’ was the MOST IMPORTANT thing!\n\n[ FYI: For more details about developing one’s character, view this previous “Life’s Deep Thoughts” post:\n\nhttps://markbesh.wordpress.com/developing-ones-character-v283/ ]\n\nMy recent sailboat journey seems to have had a similar step-by-step ‘process’ that most life journeys have:\n\n– Plan One’s Life Goal (Based on interests and a goal)\n\n– Train For One’s Goal (Consult experts)\n\n– Start Out Toward One’s Goal (Trust your instincts)\n\n– Frustrations (Trust your training)\n\n– Courage (‘Grit’ it out)\n\n– Determination (Continue no matter what)\n\n– Revise Goal (Respond to changing circumstances)\n\n– Make A Decision (Best option to reach one’s destination)\n\n– Recalculate One’s ‘Route’ (‘Listen’ to God’s ‘promptings’)\n\n– Go Forward (Press on with renewed ‘intensity’)\n\n– Being Patient (Times of ‘real’ growth)\n\n– Consider ‘Guideposts’ (Focus; Don’t veer off your ‘path’)\n\n– Persevere (“P.U.S.H.”)\n\n– See The Goal on the ‘Horizon’ (In the ‘Red Zone’)\n\n– Reach One’s Goal! (The ‘destination’ God wanted for you!)\n\nPREVIOUS BLOG ‘POSTS’\n\nReflecting on the above life ‘process’ listing, I have written about a lot about the topics associated with them. If you also related to some of the topics, the following are some of the posts affiliated with them (The posts relate—as much as possible—to the same order as the above ‘process’ list):\n\n[ more… ]\n\nONE’S JOURNEY ‘AFTER’ THIS LIFE\n\nIndeed, if our brief time on earth is only the “cover and the title page” of our eternal existence, it only makes sense that we would want to know what comes after the title page.\n\nThe “cover and the title page” concept refers to C.S. Lewis’s “Chronicles of Narnia” series, where four children explore another world, ruled by Aslan the Lion. In the first six books, Aslan sends them back to their home in England after each adventure. However, as the final book draws to its close, the children find themselves in a brilliantly enhanced Narnia, and they don’t want to leave. Their world seems pale by comparison. But, Aslan has a surprise. He reveals that the railway accident that brought them to Narnia this time was a real accident, and they have, in earthly terms, died and left their everyday world for the last time. “The term is over,” Aslan says. “The holidays have begun. The dream is ended. This is the morning.”\n\n[ more… ]\n\n[ VIDEO: “The Life and Death of Lucy Pevensie” ]\n\nTHE ‘BREVITY’ OF LIFE\n\nThe Bible says one’s life is “like a puff of smoke, which appears for a moment and then disappears” [ James 4:14 ]. Other versions call life a “mist” or a “vapor”—something that vanishes into thin air after a very short time.\n\nThe Bible also tells us that what will happen after our lives here on earth is called “ETERNITY,” which Webster’s defines as “an infinite or unending time.” To illustrate this reality, author Randy Alcorn asked people to take a piece of paper, place a dot on the left side of the paper, and then draw a line from the dot to the right edge of the paper. It would look something like this:\n\n[ more… ]\n\nTWO ‘DESTINATIONS’\n\nThe two ‘gates’ and the two ‘ways’ lead to two ‘DESTINATIONS’. The ‘narrow’ way leads to “life”: The glorious state of unclouded fellowship with God, the fullness of life, eternal satisfaction, eternal life in Heaven, and unspeakable joy.\n\nHOWEVER, the broad way leads to “destruction”: Everlasting judgment, and everlasting punishment. Destruction refers to everlasting torment, where there is weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth forever and ever and ever! (Matthew 13:42). It leads to Hell! The entrance to Hell is ‘marked’ “Heaven” on the broad road That’s Satan’s great lie!\n\nYou might say “It can’t be the wrong road, look how many people are on it!” That is true, there are pleasures of sin for a season (Hebrews 11), but it just doesn’t end up in Heaven—it ends up in HELL! It just so happens that the ‘entrance’ to Hell is just outside the ‘gates’ of Heaven!\n\n[ VIDEO: “Pilgrim’s Progress: Journey To Heaven” – Thrown Into Hell From Heaven’s Gate]\n\n———\n\nThe Bible emphasizes that there are only TWO ‘DESTINATIONS’ that one will go to after this life: Eternal ‘damnation’ in HELL or eternal ‘bliss’ in HEAVEN. The ‘CHOICE’ IS YOURS!\n\n———\n\n[ VIDEO: “The Matrix” – Blue Pill or Red Pill ]\n\nSpiritually, the ‘blue pill’ is the way of Satan and Hell, and the ‘red pill’ is the way of Jesus and Heaven. The selection of the proper ‘pill’ WILL DETERMINE YOUR ETERNAL ‘DESTINATION’… FORVER!!!\n\nDESTINATION: ‘HEAVEN’\n\nThe afterlife is common to all humanity. God, we are told, “has put eternity in their hearts” (Ecclesiastes 3:11), and human beings seem to know instinctively that there is another life behind this one.\n\nIn the pyramids of Egypt, the embalmed bodies had maps beside them as a guide for the future world. The Greeks and the Romans believed in a spirit world into which the dead would enter. Native Americans, buried bows and arrows in their tribal graves for use in the happy hunting ground in the future. Today, we hear of women asking for their make-up bag to be buried with them. So, it seems that belief in a life to come is a constant element in human culture.\n\n[ more… ]\n\nSET YOUR ‘HEART’ ON THINGS ABOVE\n\nSo, I think there is a solution. It may take effort, and it will require commitment, but it can be solved: “Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God” [ Colossians 3:1 ]. The believer’s ‘heart’ is the seat of all kinds of appetites and affections.\n\nNow, to ‘hunger’ is human, but to satiate oneself on God is to ‘send’ their heart ahead to Heaven. If one ‘feeds’ on God with all their heart, they will be yanking that foot out of the ‘mud’ and stepping closer to eternity.\n\n[ more… ]\n\nSET YOUR ‘MIND’ ON THINGS ABOVE\n\nNow, the verse right after setting one’s heart on things above is “Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things” [ Colossians 3:2 ]. The original Greek of this passage is intense: “diligently, actively, single-mindedly, pursue the things above.” It is also a present tense, carrying the idea, “Perpetually keeping on seeking the things above,” making it an ‘ongoing’ process.\n\n[ more… ]\n\nLIVING WITH A ‘DESTINATION’ MINDSET\n\nTrying to live in two places at the same time can be difficult, but it is what every believer has been called to do—temporarily. Since we do not know when we will suddenly be called a way to Heaven, we have to learn how to fulfill our responsibilities in this world while preparing for the next. Although the believer is still a resident of earth, their “true country” is Heaven, as the path of the Apostle Paul reminded the Philippians: “But our citizenship is in Heaven, and from it, we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ” [Philippians 3:20]. Even though, God has ‘charged’ each believer with responsibilities in this world that involve their work, their families, and especially their ‘ministry’ for Him as “ambassadors for Christ” (2 Corinthians 5:20).\n\n[ more… ]\n\nA ‘REAL’ PLACE\n\nThe Bible contains many descriptions of Heaven. Some of them are cast in an apocalyptic language filled with symbolism and mystery. Apocalyptic symbolism in Scripture always means that something of great consequence is under discussion. HOWEVER, don’t make the error of thinking symbolic language means the thing described is unreal. The Bible asserts that Heaven is a ‘REAL’ PLACE!\n\nTHE ‘PRESENT’ HEAVEN\n\nWhen a believer dies, they enter into what theologians call the “intermediate state,” a transitional period between our past lives on Earth in our future resurrection to life on the New Earth. Usually, when most people refer to “Heaven,“ they mean the place that believers go to right after they die. When one tells their children, “Grandma’s in Heaven now,” they are referring to this ‘intermediate’ Heaven.\n\n[ more… ]\n\nA ‘FAMILIAR’ PLACE!\n\nSometimes when we look at this world’s breathtaking beauty—experiencing a gorgeous place—we feel a twinge of disappointment. Why? Well, because we know we are going to leave this place behind when we die.\n\nWe might say, in consolation, something like “This world is not my home.” However, if we are honest, we may be thinking, “But I sure wish it was.”\n\nWhat we really want is to live forever in a world with all the beauty and none of the ugliness—a world without sin, death, and all the personal and relational problems and disappointments we endure during our lives. Well, people who have their ‘citizenship’ in Heaven (believers), will see MUCH familiarity between this Earth to the New Earth!\n\nTheologian Rene Pache explained this well:\n\n[ more… ]\n\nAN ‘EDENIC’ PARADISE\n\nThis world–including all of its natural wonders, culture, and people–gives us a ‘foretaste’ and a glimpse of the next world, only they all will be PERFECT!\n\nEvery joy on earth is an inkling, a ‘whisper’ of a greater joy to come. Sometimes we describe a place as “heaven on earth.” However, they are just rough ‘sketches’ of what will be on the New Earth. The New Earth will be a place of sensory delight, breathtaking beauty, satisfying relationships, and personal joy!\n\nSo, if a deteriorating Earth is so stunning, what will it look like when it is made new, restored to the ‘original’? Well, Earth’s beauty will just gain even deeper beauty, since it will be ‘redeemed’ and perfect.\n\nTHE ‘PRINCIPLES’ OF THE NEW HEAVEN AND NEW EARTH\n\nSo, when this ‘new’ creation is finished, and God will have ‘purified’ and ‘renovated’ it—being the same Earth and the same Heaven—it will be made ‘fresh’ and new. All the things of sin will be gone! All the evidence of death and the signs of disease will all be gone! What, then, will the world be like?\n\n[ more… ]\n\nALL THINGS ‘NEW’\n\nSo, the New Heavens and the New Earth will come when the first Heaven and the first Earth have “passed away.” The Greek word translated “new” is “kainos,” which means “ New in nature, or something that has been refurbished or improved.” This stresses that the New Earth that God will create will not just be new—as opposed to old—it will also be ‘different’.\n\n[ more… ]\n\nSPECTACULAR NATURAL ‘WONDERS’\n\nThe New Earth’s natural wonders will presumably be more spectacular than those we know now. We can expect more magnificent mountains, more beautiful lakes, and more beautiful flowers than those on this earth today. When we see the New Earth, we will look back at the present Earth and conclude, creatively speaking, that God was just ‘warming up’ and getting started on creating our eternal home (i.e. C. S. Lewis’ “Shadowlands”).\n\n[ more… ]\n\nTHINGS THAT ARE ‘NO MORE’\n\nThe Bible promises that have and will be a realm of perfect bliss. Tears, pain, sorrow, and crying will have no place whatsoever in the New Heavens and the New Earth. It will be a place where God’s people will dwell together with Him eternally, utterly free from all the effects of sin and evil! Woo-hoo!\n\nThe New Heaven and New Earth will be “where righteousness dwells” (2 Peter 3:13). Isaiah says that “the former things will not be remembered, nor will they come to mind” [ Isaiah 65:17 ]. Eden WILL BE ‘restored’.\n\nIn the New Heavens and New Earth, Scripture says, there are seven things notable for their absence—things that are “no more”:\n\n[ more… ]\n\n‘INDESCRIBABLE’\n\nThe Apostle John’s own words in Revelation 21-22 no doubt represent a human attempt to describe the UTTERLY ‘INDESCRIBABLE’. Theologian John F. Walvoord—the late president of Dallas Theological Seminary—observed that “The overall impression of the city is a gigantic brilliant Jewel compared to Jasper, clear as crystal, indicates its great beauty. John was trying to describe what he saw related to what might be familiar to his readers. However, it is evident that his revelation transcends anything that can be experienced.”\n\n[ more… ]\n\n[ VIDEO: “The Pilgrim’s Progress” movie – Welcome To Heaven ]\n\n‘HOW’ TO GET INTO HEAVEN\n\nSo, you can understand humanity’s ‘problem’, let me take you back to when God created the world. The Bible tells us that it was created ‘PERFECT’. God walked and talked with Adam and Eve. He manifested His presence to them. They knew Him in a real and literal way.\n\nGod gave them MUCH freedom and only restricted them not to eat of just “ONE’ tree—the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (with possibly hundreds, thousands, or even millions of other trees to eat from!)\n\nHowever, Satan, a fallen angel, came into Paradise and began to contaminate and corrupt the world with his lies.\n\nSadly, Eve listened to Satan and ate of the forbidden tree. She then shared it with Adam. By disobeying God, they plunged the entire human race ‘into’ sin! [ In addition to that, a ‘curse’ was also placed upon the earth (Genesis 3:17-18; Romans 8:20-22) ].\n\n[ more… ]\n\nHOW TO BE ‘DELIVERED’\n\nWe have all ‘assaulted’ God (Romans 3:23), and WE ALL DESERVE HELL!\n\nGod, the righteous ‘Judge’ of all the Earth will one day call every creature into account (Genesis 18:25; Hebrews 9:27; 1 Peter 4:5). He will open the ‘books’ and mete out a JUST ‘SENTENCE’ for every sinful thought, word, and deed (Romans 2:5; Revelation 20:13). To accuse God of injustice for sentencing sinners to Hell is the height of arrogance and audacity.\n\n[ more… ]\n\nOVERCOME YOUR ‘PROCRASTINATION’\n\nExperts say that ‘procrastination’ just might be the worst ‘enemy’ when one is trying to be a responsible person.\n\nNow, life can be so hectic at times that it is only natural to want to put things off. However, a ‘responsible’ person accounts for those ‘hiccups’ in their schedule and does not save things for the last minute! So, experts suggest that one should reduce distraction, refine their motivations, write down their goals, and scrutinize their calendar for when they are wasting precious time.\n\n[ FYI: For more details about procrastination and some ‘tactics’ on how to stop it, view this previous “Life’s Deep Thoughts” post:\n\nhttps://markbesh.wordpress.com/a-sense-of-urgency-v269/ ]\n\n[ more… ]\n\nACCEPT THE ‘GIFT’ NOW!\n\nSo, what sends people to Hell? You ‘CHOOSE’ to go! (by not repenting of your sins). It’s that simple!\n\nAn illustration might make all this a bit more clear: One day, when Vice President Calvin Coolidge was presiding over the Senate, one Senator angrily told another to go “straight to hell.” The offended Senator complained to Coolidge as presiding officer, and the Vice President looked up from the book he had been leafing through while listening to the debate and wittily replied. “I’ve been looking through the rule book. You don’t have to go.”\n\nI have tried to present, from my best understanding of the Bible on this, that Hell is a real place for those who choose to ‘reject’ God, and HIS ‘parameters’ about how NOT TO GO THERE!\n\n———\n\nThe “good news” is that God has made a way for His righteousness and His love to be fully reconciled. In His incarnation, Jesus fulfilled justice (satisfying, not notifying, the demands of His law). In His death on the cross, Jesus paid the price of His people’s sin in full (assuring the triumph of perfect justice). In Jesus’ resurrection from the dead, He put a powerful ‘exclamation mark’ on His own perfect, finished work of atonement (thus sealing the promise of justification forever for those who trust Him as Lord and Savior).\n\nSo, thank God for the wonderful good news: “If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved” [ Romans 10:9-10 ].\n\nIf you are an UNBELIEVER and have not yet done this, please, DO IT NOW!\n\nWRAP-UP\n\nDo you remember driving with your kids on the family vacation? About 30 minutes into the trip, the kids start bugging you with two questions; “Are we there yet?” and then, “How much longer?”\n\nThese are questions that one will a bit of life ‘experience’ also continue to ask themselves throughout their life.\n\n‘TIPS’ TO REACH ONE’S DESTINATION\n\nSo, are there any ‘tips’ to follow to help in reaching one’s short-term ‘goal’ or even one’s lifetime ‘destination?\n\n[ more… ]\n\nGAINING ‘RESILIENCE’\n\nWhile some people are innately resilient, studies increasingly show that resilience is not a fixed personality trait but a skill that can be developed.\n\nIn the field of positive psychology, there are many theories on how to build resilience. Having strong, healthy interpersonal relationships, looking after your physical and mental health, and practicing self-compassion are cornerstones of building resilience.\n\n[ more… ]\n\nENGENDERING ‘PATIENCE’\n\nOne thing travel does—like it or not—is to build one’s ability to be patient (Which, as I mentioned, was the BIG ‘TAKEAWAY’ for me on my sailboat journey—so I spent a bit of time discussing it below.)\n\nTaken in a good way, this ability can help one become a more ‘compassionate’ person. (Hopefully, I moved a bit closer to being this kind of person with this experience!)\n\nIn a world of instantaneous everything, travel tends to ‘shake things up’. No matter what type of trip one takes—alone or with a group—travel will put one face-to-face with challenges, some profound and some fleeting. The following are some ‘takeaways’ after one has handled a situation.\n\n[ more… ]\n\n‘GUIDEPOSTS’\n\nDuring my sailing journey, there were a variety of ‘guides’ to help us navigate the waters safely—primarily buoys and beacons.\n\nA buoy functions similarly to the lane markers on the roads. It designates the safest navigable ‘channel’ where there are not any shallow hazards below the waterline. Buoys float on top of the water and are connected to the bottom with a chain—so they move a bit. Beacons, however, are a permanently fixed ‘structure’—like a lighthouse—and have a light affixed to the top of them. They do not move.\n\n[ more… ]\n\n‘BIBLICAL’ GUIDES\n\nWhen sailing, if the compass is not adjusted properly and is only one degree off, you will not arrive at your destination. A properly ‘aligned’ compass—neutralizing the boat’s magnetism—will not be skewed. It will point “true north.”\n\nThe believer’s moral ‘compass’ points to “true north”—the Bible. God’s Word is the foundation for the believer’s moral and ethical behavior, and consequences are serious when their moral compass is not correctly aligned with God’s Word.\n\n[ more… ]\n\n– Gaining ‘Wisdom\n\nThe following are a few Bible passages of ‘wisdom’ literature (Psalms and Proverbs) that pertain to how God ‘guides’ us through life:\n\n[ more… ]\n\n‘PERSEVERANCE’\n\nWebster’s defines perseverance as a “determined continuation in something with a steady and continued action of belief that occurs over a long period of time amongst and despite especially difficult circumstances.”\n\nThe Bible definitely agrees with this, and says that steadfastness produces perseverance: “Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything” [ James 1:2-4 ].\n\n[ more… ]\n\nIS HEAVEN ‘YOUR’ DESTINATION?\n\nLife is often described as a journey, and going on a journey implies that there should be a ‘destination’. Now, there will be many ‘destinations’ that will be reached during one’s life but never make the mistake of considering them to be your ‘final’ destination—Heaven.\n\nMost of us have some questions about our eternal destination, but we may say, “That is a ways off, so why worry about it now? There’s still plenty of time for me to decide.” Well, there’s a proverb in the Bible that gives us a warning about that: “Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring” [ Proverbs 27:1 ]. None of us is promised tomorrow, so “Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation” [ 2 Corinthians 6:2b ]. Make ‘peace’ with God today!\n\n[ FYI: For more details about how to make peace with God, view this previous “Life’s Deep Thoughts post:\n\nhttps://markbesh.wordpress.com/know-peace-v201/ ]\n\nBE SURE ‘YOU’ ARE GOING TO HEAVEN!\n\nWe cannot assume that if we simply show up for church every Sunday, we will be guaranteed Heaven. It just doesn’t work that way. The Word of God is clear: We must join the ‘team’ and knowingly do it by first accepting our ‘condition’.\n\nThe Bible says, “For all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God” [ Romans 3:23 ], and later, the Apostle Paul says that “the wages of sin is death.”\n\nWow, that sounds pretty ‘ominous’! But… I didn’t finish that last verse. It continues: “…but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord” [ Romans 6:23 ]. Through God’s awesome grace and mercy, He sent His only Son, Jesus, to die in our place, and ‘satisfy’ His requirements for the ‘atonement’ of all of our sins!\n\nThis is presented in the Bible this way: “God showed how much He loved us by sending His one and only Son into the world so that we might have eternal life through Him. This is real love—not that we loved God, but that He loved us first, and sent His Son as a sacrifice to take away our sins” [ 1 John 4:9-10 ].\n\nHOW TO ‘PREPARE’\n\nJesus is preparing a ‘home’ for EVERY believer in Heaven. So then, how does one ‘prepare’ for their meeting with Jesus? Well, Pastor A.W. Pink described one important way one can prepare for their heavenly dwelling—living with eager ‘anticipation’:\n\n“Today the average ‘home’ is little more than a boarding-house—a place to eat and sleep in. But “home” used to mean, and still means to a few, the place where we are loved for our own sakes; the place where we are always welcome; the place whither we can retire from the strife of the world and enjoy rest and peace, the place where loved ones are together. Such will Heaven be. Believers are now in a strange country, yea, in an enemy’s land; in the life to come, they will be at Home!”\n\nFYI: For more details about how one should prepare to meet Jesus, view this previous “Life’s Deep Thoughts” post:\n\nhttps://markbesh.wordpress.com/how-to-prepare-to-meet-someone-important-v276/ ]\n\n[ more… ]\n\nWHY IS HEAVEN ‘NEGLECTED’?\n\nOne obvious reason why many of us do not reflect on Heaven nearly as much as we should is that we are too preoccupied with this present world. We are surrounded by what we can see, hear, touch, taste, and smell. If one takes a coin in their hand and holds it close to their eye, it will block out the sun—and they will see nothing, but that small, shiny coin. Now, the sun is bigger than the coin, but because the coin is close it blocks out there, say something incomparably greater in size.\n\nThe daily realities of life may be either big, or ultimately, important, but they are ‘close’ to us, so they impinge upon us. The danger is that the very closeness of this world blocks out the infinitely far-reaching prospect of the glorious world that is to come.\n\n[ more… ]\n\nNOT ‘GUESSWORK’\n\nGoing to Heaven is NOT a matter of ‘guesswork’ or hope! (“I hope I’m going to make it to Heaven. I have done a lot of good things.”) Nope, Jesus did the ‘GOOD’ THING. He went to the Cross and died in our place. He took the wrath of God against us. When He rose from the dead, He gave us the ‘gift’ of eternal life. Everyone who wants to go to Heaven just needs to ‘authentically’ put their faith and trust in what He did. The Bible tells us that whoever will call on the name of the Lord WILL be saved (Romans 10:13).\n\n[ more… ]\n\nTHIS WORLD IS NOT YOUR ‘HOME’!\n\nThere is a tendency for most of us to hold tightly to this world because it is all that we know. It is familiar to us. All our deepest relationships are built here. We too easily think of it as ‘home’. So, we become ‘captive’ to this life.\n\nHowever, notice that the Apostle Paul says that he would rather be “at home” with the Lord. That is precisely what the Greek expression in the original text signifies. It is a form of the verb “endemeo,” which translates as “to be at home.” We are most truly “at home” only when we are finally with the Lord. Paul understood this. The knowledge that he ‘belongs’ in Heaven, was the very thing that helped him endure all the struggles he experienced in his life.\n\n[ more… ]\n\nGOD ‘WANTS’ EVERYONE TO COME HOME!\n\nAccording to a 2007 Gallup poll, 81% of adult Americans said they believed in Heaven. Nearly 80% of those questioned also said that they believed that they would be admitted into Heaven when they die. So, almost everybody who believes in Heaven expects to go there in the afterlife.\n\nNow, it is true that God “desires all men to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth” [ 1 Timothy 2:4 ], and He doesn’t want “anyone to perish, but they come to repentance” [ 2 Peter 3:9d ]. HOWEVER, He has some ‘requirements’ for that to happen.\n\nKarin Collins captured this sentiment well in her poem “It’s Time To Come Home”:\n\n[ more… ]\n\n[ VIDEO: “Are You A Good Person?” – Living Waters ]\n\n[ more… ]\n\nYOUR ‘FUTURE’ MATTERS TODAY!\n\nThe choices we make today determine what happens to us in the future, and God has a wonderful plan for our eternal destiny. The Apostle Paul said confidently: “If God is for us, who can be against us?” [ Romans 8:31 ].\n\nAuthor and Bible teacher Grant Jeffrey wrote something similar:\n\n[ more… ]\n\nENTRANCE ‘REQUIREMENTS’\n\nIf we had wanted to sail the boat over to Canada and stay over a few days in a place like Tobermory (about 110 nautical miles NE from East Tawas across Lake Huron), we would have needed to have a passport. Regardless of one’s status or ‘charisma’, that document is what qualifies one for entry and acceptance among the people in a different land.\n\nSimilarly, we all need a ‘passport’ to get into Heaven—if that is the ‘country’ where one wishes to go.\n\nNow, the Bible says that you should not imagine for a moment that you will get into Heaven without the right ‘credentials’. You will not be there because your spouse has the right to enter, or because your parents are already there. No, this is an individual matter, and only those with the right ‘passport’ will be allowed to enter.\n\n———\n\nHeaven IS real but you can’t get in without a ‘reservation’. HOWEVER, if you don’t already have one, YOU ‘CAN’ GET ONE!\n\nJust remember that there’s NO ‘PLACE’ like Heaven!!!\n\n‘JOURNEY’ OF A LIFETIME!\n\nThe Apostle John gives us a travel ‘brochure’ of sorts (in Revelation, 21:1-26:6). But, unlike slick publicity pieces, he does not exaggerate when he describes our destinations. He relates as accurately as possible what we can expect to see and experience when we enter the Kingdom of Heaven ‘ON’ EARTH. John’s only difficulty is that he does not have the words that are adequate to communicate the splendor. After all, how do you paint a picture of a perfect world, a utopian paradise that is unmatched by anything on Earth?\n\n[ FYI: View last month’s “Life’s Deep Thoughts” post to see the Top 10 places in the world where people say that they are “heaven on earth”:\n\nhttps://markbesh.wordpress.com/heaven-on-earth-v289/ ].\n\nYOUR NEXT ‘STOP’?\n\nIn the American neo-Western drama TV series “1923”—a prequel to the series “Yellowstone” (and a sequel to “1883”)—the younger son of James and Margaret Dutton, Spencer, who had witnessed the horrors of World War I, travels to Africa seeking big game.\n\nArriving in Nairobi via train, he has this interaction with the train’s porter:\n\nSPENCER: “I have no destination.”\n\nPORTER: “Do you have a ticket for Nairobi?”\n\nSPENCER: “I do.”\n\nPORTER: “Then, you have reached your destination, sir.”\n\nSPENCER: “I’ve reached my next stop. That’s all this is… Apologies for the scare… I don’t wake well.”\n\nPORTER: “No sir. I’d say you don’t.”\n\n[ VIDEO: “I have no destination.” – Spencer on the TV series “1923” ]\n\nWell, let me tell you, based on the Bible, if you do not have Heaven as your ‘DESTINATION’ after this life, your NEXT ‘STOP’ will be HELL—forever!\n\nSO, DON’T LET THAT HAPPEN!!!\n\nIf you authentically REPENT of your sins RIGHT NOW and ask Jesus to be your ‘substitution’ for all your sins, He WILL DO SO and give you the ‘gift’ of eternal life!\n\nThen, after you die (or are ‘raptured’) you WILL go to Heaven—instead of Hell—for all of ETERNITY!!!\n\n<<< END OF SUMMARY >>>\n\n<<< ALL THE DETAILS >>>\n\nThe following is a comprehensive presentation of the topic that follows the ‘headings’ laid out in the Summary.\n\nMOST ‘POPULAR’ DESTINATIONS\n\nThere are many popular destinations worldwide. In 2023, there were 1.3 billion international tourists, with a growth of 33,4% compared to 2022 and growth of 112.2% compared to 2021. The top 10 international tourism destinations in 2023 were:\n\nAustria\n\nFrance\n\nSpain\n\nUnited States\n\nItaly\n\nTurkey\n\nMexico\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\nGreece\n\n2024 TRAVEL OUTLOOK\n\n2023 saw a resurgence of people taking holidays to all corners of the globe and the research firm, Tripadvisor, has indicated that travel is set to see that sustained momentum in 2024. Tripadvisor data reveals more than half (62%) of the Brits are planning one to two trips, and one-third (31%) are planning three to four, with 83% of British holidaymakers planning to spend the same, if not more, on travel this year.\n\nTripadvisor’s “Best of the Best Destinations” list offers inspiration from the global travel community for those planning trips for 2024. Winning destinations are determined by analyzing Tripadvisor reviews and rankings from the last 12 months, and with a multitude of destinations spanning 80 countries. This year’s list of Traveler’s Choice Awards Best of the Best Destinations, totals a whopping 221 destinations.\n\nTripadvisor’s top 2024 destinations, according to global travelers, is that Dubai was named the number one “Top Destination in the World” for the third year running (and Asia dominated the “Trending Destinations” list for 2024).\n\nTripadvisor’s “Best of the Best Destinations” span seven categories for 2024: “Top Destinations” (formerly Popular Destinations), “Trending Destinations,” “Culture Destinations,” “Food Destinations,” “Nature Destinations” and two new subcategories this year: “Honeymoon Destinations” and “Sustainable Destinations.”\n\nSarah Firshein, Head of Editorial at Tripadvisor, said “Winners like Dubai, Tokyo, Paris, and Marrakech indicate that our community has an unbridled appetite for destinations with vibrant arts-and-culture scenes, top-notch restaurants, and seemingly limitless attractions and experiences. It’s also great to see a rebound on long-haul trips to Asia, with the region having fully opened up post-pandemic; as Tripadvisor’s Trending Destinations list shows, travelers are keen to get out there and explore with gusto.”\n\nSo, when it comes to emerging travel hotspots for 2024, Asia takes the crown, securing the top five places in the world for Trending Destinations and making up an impressive eight out of the top 10 destinations. Identifying the places that have seen the greatest year-over-year growth in interest, Tokyo, Japan is the number one Trending Destination in the World for 2024, followed by Seoul, South Korea at number two, and Halong Bay, Vietnam at number three. Central and South America are the only other regions to make the top 10, with Bogota, Colombia at number six and Alajuela, Costa Rica at number eight.\n\nThe following are some of Tripadvisor’s lists.\n\nMOST POPULAR ‘CITY’\n\nDubai, UAE\n\nBali, Indonesia\n\nLondon, UK\n\nHanoi, Vietnam\n\nRome, Italy\n\nParis, France\n\nCancun, Mexico\n\nMarrakech, Morocco\n\nCrete, Greece\n\nHoi An, Vietnam\n\n[ NOTE: To see the changes in the popularity of the most popular visited cities—a few years before the pandemic—the following were Tripadvisor’s most popular cities to visit in 2018:\n\nParis, France\n\nLondon, England\n\nRome, Italy\n\nBali, Indonesia\n\nCrete, Greece\n\nBarcelona, Spain\n\nPrague, Czech Republic\n\nMarrakech, Morocco\n\nIstanbul, Turkey\n\nNew York City, New York, USA\n\n[ Tokyo was 18th, and most of the other cities listed for 2024 were not on the 2018 list. ]\n\n‘TRENDING’ CITIES\n\n(Greatest year-over-year growth)\n\nTokyo, Japan\n\nSeoul, South Korea\n\nHalong Bay, Vietnam\n\nPalawan Island, Philippines\n\nSapa, Vietnam\n\nBogota, Colombia\n\nPattaya, Thailand\n\nAlajuela, Costa Rica\n\nPhnom Penh, Cambodia\n\nKuala Lumpur, Malaysia\n\nFOR THE ‘NATURE’\n\nKathmandu, Nepal\n\nHalong Bay, Vietnam\n\nHurghada, Egypt\n\nMauritius, Republic of Mauritius\n\nLombok, Indonesia\n\nKauai, U.S.\n\nZanzibar Island, Tanzania\n\nGrand Cayman, Caribbean\n\nGuadeloupe, Caribbean\n\nKruger National Park, South Africa\n\nFOR THE ‘FOOD’\n\nHanoi, Vietnam\n\nRome, Italy\n\nCrete, Greece\n\nCusco, Peru\n\nFlorence, Italy\n\nNew Delhi, India\n\nBarcelona, Spain\n\nNew Orleans, U.S.\n\nLisbon, Portugal\n\nPhuket, Thailand\n\nFOR THE ‘CULTURE’\n\nCultural tourism is all about connecting with local culture through unique activities. It’s a way to immerse yourself in the unique experiences that a new place has to offer.\n\nCuba is highly regarded as the number one cultural tourism destination. It offers travelers a rich and immersive experience. Cuba is known for its vibrant music, dance, historical architecture, and colorful traditions.\n\nCuba, Caribbean\n\nCusco, Peru\n\nAgra, India\n\nFes, Morocco\n\nAthens, Greece\n\nDublin, Ireland\n\nColombo, Sri Lanka\n\nHue, Vietnam\n\nEdinburgh, UK\n\nTokyo, Japan\n\nFOR THE ‘ATTRACTION’\n\nSo, what is the most popular tourist ‘attraction’ in the world? Well, just before the pandemic hit—in late 2019—the Las Vegas Strip was the world’s most popular tourist destination with 39,668,221 annual visitors.\n\nMany countries promote the unique natural beauty of their tourist attractions as summer vacation destinations. These may be beaches or national parks. Cultural destinations, museums, gardens, and historic structures are being advertised as tourist destinations. Legendary places, arts and crafts communities, ethnic communities, island resorts, landmarks, haunted places, and even UFO crash sites are also marketed with the same intent.\n\nDestination Popularity\n\nMany factors promote the tourist visitation of a place. The foremost is safety and universal appeal. Tourist destinations suitable for people of all ages, and all tastes are most visited. Accessibility is another important factor and as evident from the list, it is clear that all the popular tourist destinations are either located in the heart of major world cities or are easily reached from nearby urban centers. Thus, as long these factors hold true, the below-listed tourist destinations will continue to draw massive crowds, boosting the pride and income of their respective countries.\n\nFOR ‘RETIREMENT’\n\nIf one is considering retirement abroad, one needs information, and lots of it. But more than that, one needs guidance on how to interpret that information. That is why “International Living” (IL) compiled their “2024 Annual Global Retirement Index”—to help one with choosing where in the world will best suit one’s needs.\n\nWhen first conceived, their “Retirement Index” was their special way of coping with an embarrassment of riches. At that stage, IL had already spent over a decade exploring all manner of dream locales. The result was a huge and exciting variety of choices and opportunities. Fast-forward to 2024.\n\nMore than three decades have gone by, during which IL’s scouts have scoured every corner of the globe many times over. The result is a much bigger and ever-growing selection of outstanding destinations where one can live a healthier and happier life, spend a lot less money, and get a whole lot more out of life.\n\nThe “Retirement Index” is the most comprehensive and in-depth survey of its kind. It is the best way IL knows of to sift through the wealth of opportunity the world offers, bring some order, and help one pinpoint the best destination for themselves.\n\nThe index is informed by hundreds of opinions and real-life experiences—information—compiled by IL’s trusted sources in the best retirement destinations across the globe. They think of it as a tool to quickly compare and contrast one’s best options and begin to narrow down one’s choices.\n\nSo, their research revealed the best retirement havens in 2024 are:\n\nCosta Rica\n\nPortugal\n\nMexico\n\nPanama\n\nSpain\n\nEcuador\n\nGreece\n\nMalaysia\n\nFrance\n\nColumbia\n\nItaly\n\nThailand\n\nMalta\n\nUruguay\n\nIreland\n\nRoatan\n\nBelize\n\n[ FYI: For more information, the following video gives details of each of the above countries:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LJmdtmktg0&t=46s ]\n\nFOR ‘VOLUNTEERISM’\n\n“Give A Day Global” connects travelers with short-term volunteer opportunities at nonprofit organizations around the world.\n\nTheir mission is to empower travelers to make a difference, to support communities creating change, and to connect people as global citizens, one day at a time.\n\nThey believe that all people should have access to education, healthy food, medical care, a sustainable environment, and economic opportunities. By connecting travelers with nonprofit organizations that pursue these same goals, we aim to engage more people in making the world a better place, one day at a time.\n\nSo, they connect travelers with short-term volunteer opportunities at nonprofit organizations around the world. Their top 15 Places to travel to (in 2023) were:\n\nNew Zealand\n\nMorocco\n\nSouth Africa\n\nTurkey\n\nCosta Rica\n\nJapan\n\nThe Galapagos\n\nThailand\n\nMexico\n\nIceland\n\nAustralia\n\nPeru\n\nCanada\n\nAnguilla\n\nPanama\n\n[ FYI: For more details about each one of these volunteer opportunities, visit the “Give A Day Global” website:\n\nhttps://www.giveadayglobal.org/top-15-places-to-travel-in-2023/\n\n‘PLANNING’ A JOURNEY\n\nSo then, after one selects a ‘destination’ (and maybe a ‘reason’ to go there), they then need to start ‘planning’ their journey. So, what do the experts say about how to begin?\n\nWell, planning a journey itinerary can be a daunting task even if you are an experienced traveler. So, Tim and Allison Diemer (“Tim and Fin Travel”) suggest a systematic manner that will help one make decisions faster and better.\n\nStep 1: Chose Your Destination ‘Bucket List’ For Your Itinerary\n\nTraveling solo or with a friend? Spend time thinking (“daydreaming”) of places, dreaming of destinations, and scoping experiences online. Turn this time into strategic planning by marking these down somewhere. You can even create a trip planner and begin a destination ‘bucket list’.\n\nThen, with even just a few items on your list, it is easy to begin the next steps in planning your trip.\n\nStep 2: Determine The Length Of Your Stay\n\nSome locations are easier than others when it comes to itinerary planning. Just by adding a second column to your spreadsheet, you can start to account for the length of time you would need for this itinerary.\n\nStep 3: Cost Per Day\n\nThere are tons of online resources to help you predict the average trip cost per day in traveling in the regions you want to visit. Now that you have an ongoing list of destinations, you can use the number of days multiplied by the cost per day to view your entire cost per location, and thus, the cost of each trip.\n\nYou will want to be as specific as possible when assessing your trip cost. Do not just list a country name. For example, if you know you want to go to Mexico, make separate lines for the specific locations on your ‘bucket list’ because they likely have different costs. You may want to go to Mexico City and a road trip around the Yucatan. You will then be able to specify the length of stay and budget much more easily when your trip itinerary is broken down it more specific ‘pieces’.\n\nStep 4: Add Dates To Your Calendar\n\nSo, what goes into the decision about when to travel? Well, logistics, timing, weather, holidays, and festival dates are key ingredients in putting together the perfect trip itinerary.\n\nStep 5: Stay Flexible\n\nNow, just know that change and disruption to your trip itinerary are inevitable. However, most of the time this leads to something ‘special’.\n\nHow To Budget Your Trip\n\nSo, play around with the length of time in certain locations to meet your budget needs. Shorten the length of time in expensive countries or look for cheaper alternatives.\n\nLong-haul, intercontinental flights are expensive no matter if you are paying cash or using ‘miles’. Limiting the number of long flights between continents significantly changes the final cost of your trip.\n\nSo, once you can identify your “must-have” destinations, you will know things like you need at least two weeks for southern Italy. Then, all the numbers start to add up and you will realize that you do not want to shorten the length of time in your favorite places just to hit a new city/continent during your trip.\n\nFinally, be time-sensitive. You can whimsically say “Oh, wouldn’t a week in ___________ (fill in the blank) be magical?” Now, it, most likely, would be ‘magical’, you may have underestimated your time budget. Once you start to research a location you will start to learn what length of time is appropriate—even if you are short on time. Now, that is not to say that you just might be able to do a spontaneous ‘road trip’, but just be aware that it just might affect something ‘down the road’.\n\n‘THINGS’ TO CONSIDER\n\nThe following is a list of ‘specific’ things that one should consider when planning a journey:\n\n– Choose Your Destination\n\n– Define Your Goals\n\n– Set a Budget (Budget High)\n\n– Research, Research, Research!\n\n– Government Websites\n\n– Create a ‘Bucket List’\n\n– Create a Rough Itinerary\n\n– Check the Weather (Seasonal)\n\n– Arrange Transportation\n\n– Accommodations\n\n– Local Timing\n\n– Time Frame\n\n– Price Comparisons\n\n– Work To Your Budget\n\n– Things To See and Do\n\n– Check Travel Advisories\n\n– Make Reservations\n\n– Flights\n\n– Booking (Book Your First Night)\n\n– ‘Register’ Your Trip\n\n– Accommodations\n\n– Get Traveler’s Insurance\n\n– Check Your Passport’s Expiration Date\n\n– Make Copies of Your Passport Data Page\n\n– Get Entry Visas (if Needed)\n\n– Get International Driving Permit\n\n– Get Travel Vaccines\n\n– Fill Your Prescriptions\n\n– Build a Strong Immune System\n\n– Set Up Your Home For Being Empty\n\n– Housesitting\n\n– Notify Your Bank and Pay Your Bills\n\n– Packing List\n\n– Pack Light and Smart\n\n– Packing Cube\n\n– Bring Enough Cash\n\n– Confirm Carry-on and Check Luggage Restrictions\n\n– Save Info For Offline Use\n\n– Get an International Data Plan\n\n– Double Check Your Passport!\n\n– Bring Snacks\n\n– Prepare For Arrival\n\n[ NOTE: The following are a variety of apps to help with research while you are on your journey (in alphabetical order):\n\n– Booking.com\n\n– City Mapper\n\n– Holafly\n\n– Hopper\n\n– Meetup\n\n– GlobeTips\n\n– Google Maps (Lists)\n\n– Google Translate\n\n– Rick Steves Audio Europe\n\n– Rideshare App\n\n– Roadtrippers\n\n– Rome2Rio\n\n– Surfshark\n\n– Train App\n\n– TripIt\n\n– Trip Advisor\n\n– Viator Airbnb Experiences\n\n– Your Airline’s App ]\n\nDO’S AND DON’TS WHILE TRAVELING\n\nWhen traveling to a new place or country, always remember important safety vacation tips for an enjoyable experience. Here are a few of our do’s and don’ts for beginners that you might want to take notes of:\n\nDo’s\n\n– Do try to be friendly with whoever you meet along the way.\n\n– Do keep all your valuables inside a personal safe when staying at local motels or hotels.\n\n– Do pack lightly for the day. Keep all your stuff safely back at the hotel, and only bring what you need in the backpack. Remember, you’ll need to make room for souvenirs.\n\n– Do try to stay hydrated throughout the day. And the best way to do that is to carry around your bottle that was prefilled with fresh, clean water.\n\n– Do consider the best travel tips from experts before and during your trips.\n\nDon’ts\n\n– Don’t bring a lot of cash, and never try to exchange money in shady areas. You can easily become the target of robbers and thieves.\n\n– Don’t visit isolated and unpopulated areas unless you know you’re protected.\n\n– Don’t drink local water if you think they’re not safe.\n\n– Don’t hang your backpack loosely on one shoulder. Put it in the front or to the opposite side of the street, so you can avoid thefts.\n\n– Don’t be afraid to bargain the prices with the locals if you think you’re being charged with “tourist prices”\n\n[ NOTE: I have included a variety of “how to plan a trip” articles and videos in the “ARTICLES” sections below. ]\n\n‘SAILBOAT-SPECIFIC’ JOURNEY PLANNING\n\nSo then, what kinds of things did my best friend Bob Hart probably go through when he was planning a sailing route to get his ‘new’ sailboat from the marina it was at (in East Tawas) to his marina in Lake St. Clair?\n\nWell, Denisa Nguyenová, the Operations Manager at “Yachting.com” presented a variety of factors to consider when choosing a route, which Bob, most likely explored.\n\n– Before You Begin Planning The Route\n\nThe choice of destination is crucial to a successful voyage. That is how you determine all the options available to you when planning the route. A sailor’s initial step should therefore be to research the destinations concerning the experience of the crew, the weather, and the voyage dates.\n\nIf one does not do this, they could easily end up heading to Italy in August, when the whole country is on vacation and spending the trip packed like sardines. Likewise, in the Aegean Sea, the Meltemi winds blow during July and August, which could turn your sailing vacation into a bit of a nightmare.\n\nDenisa offers this tip: If you’re not a seasoned ‘sea dog’ yet, try sailing in an area where conditions are beginner-friendly.\n\n– 10 Yachting ‘Commandments’\n\nSo, before going on a journey, it is good to ask oneself some questions. Denisa offers the following “10 Yachting Commandments”:\n\n1) What Are The ‘Expectations’ Of Each Crew Member?\n\nIf you want an active, adrenaline-fueled sailing holiday, one might be fired up by a ‘tough’ destination whereas someone else might be desiring a relaxing cruise with a group of friends.\n\nThen, ask yourself if it is a ‘diverse’ crew It is conceivable that you might have adventurers on board who want to sail from morning to night with the motto “the bigger the wind and waves, the better,” as well as those who wish to bathe in deserted bays, snorkel, hunt for shells, and spend evenings at anchor far from civilization. In addition to that, some of the crew just might want to spend all day moored in harbors during the day and experiencing the ‘nightlife’ at night.\n\nIn these cases, it is obviously very difficult to reconcile everyone’s expectations. The ideal solution is to meet up before leaving and try to reach a compromise that will appeal to everyone, no matter how impossible that might seem.\n\n2) What Wii Be The Yachting ‘Infrastructure’/Conditions\n\nAn experienced sailor will prefer a place with more challenging conditions and a strong wind, so they will not mind bad weather or insufficient infrastructure. However, beginners appreciate an abundance of safe harbors, high-quality services, and predictable weather.\n\nThat is why one should also research the yachting infrastructure when choosing a journey. Look up potential anchorages en route and plan your voyage around them (such as choosing an island with a mooring sheltered from various sides).\n\n3) What Do You Want To ‘Experience’ During The Voyage?\n\nDo you want to fully immerse yourself in sailing or do you want to combine it with other activities? Diving enthusiasts will be enamored with a location teeming with life beneath the waves, while others will be charmed by places jam-packed with historical monuments or captivating natural scenery. So, one must choose their ideal location according to the interests and needs of the crew, so that there is something for everyone.\n\n4) How Many ‘Nautical Miles’ Do You Want To Cover?\n\nDepending on the weather conditions, one can sail from 80-400 nautical miles in a week. The first promises comfortable, relaxing sailing of two hours a day. For the rest of the day, you can have your fill of swimming, snorkeling, romance, and rest.\n\nWhereas, the longer distance would require 10 hours of sailing a day, long crossings motoring or under the sails. One would likely experience some great yachting, see plenty of places, and have many experiences, however, it probably would include seasickness and struggling to sleep at night on choppy seas. [ In a fore cabin, it can be as difficult as trying to fall asleep in a washing machine. ;^D ]\n\nSo, it is good to remind the novice sailors that their captain has a clear idea of what can be achieved in a week.\n\n5) Will You Be Sailing With ‘Kids’?\n\nFamilies with children value stable weather and calm, warm seas, and deserted, sandy bays accessible only by sea. If this is your desire, choose the route so that you can have adequate stops along the way. Daily sailing trips should be kept short, so the kids don’t get bored. Sailing in calm weather is ideal so mothers don’t have to worry about their kids’ safety.\n\nChildren appreciate activities off the boat as well. Choose a location where kids will be able to explore islands, deserted fortresses, and lighthouses, cool down with an ice cream, or have fun with their water toys. If the kids are older, it is important to find interesting places for snorkeling and exploring.\n\nWhen sailing with children, one must not forget to teach the main principles of safe sailing, choose appropriate safety features, adjust the route, and choose the boat with the whole family in mind.\n\n6) What Kind Of ‘Weather Conditions’ Will There Be?\n\nChoose your destination according to the dates you are going to ensure your safety at sea. If you choose well, it can take your sailing holiday to a whole new level and save you a lot of worry. Consider the expected weather and wind conditions carefully when making your choice of destination.\n\nIf it is going to be ‘high season’ in your chosen destination, then be prepared for crowded marinas and higher prices. However, in the autumn you can sail for cheaper, have more pleasant weather and favorable winds, and will be able to see a lot more.\n\nIf you are relatively inexperienced, it would be better to select another date especially if there are commonly unfavorable winds during your chosen dates.\n\nIn addition to that, if you love to swim be sure to research air and water temperatures as well.\n\n7) What ‘Size’ Boat Do You Have And What Is Its ‘Draft’?\n\nChoose the places you want to visit with the size and draft of the boat in mind. If you love small fishing harbors, a 57-foot boat or catamaran will not get into this kind of harbor. Even a racing boat with a smaller draft still might not be the right choice in old harbors.\n\n8) Sailing Off The ‘Beaten Track’\n\nIn every sailing region, there are standard routes that most boats follow, taking in the most interesting and beautiful places. So, choose these routes in ‘off-season’, since in ‘high season’ there will be boats everywhere, loads of people, full harbors and moorings, and busy restaurants and attractions.\n\nSo, if you head off the ‘beaten path’, you will have a chance of uncovering small bays with neither people nor boats even in high season. It is unlikely that you will ever be completely alone, but it will still be a big difference compared to the main yachting ‘draws’.\n\n9) Location Accessibility\n\nA deserted paradise on earth where you can moor the yacht of your dreams will remain just a dream if you can’t fly there or get there by car.\n\n10) Validity Of A Captain’s License\n\nIt is the exclusive right of every country to decide whether it wants to accept a captain’s boating license. So, one should check whether one’s license is valid in your chosen country.\n\nAfter considering the above “10 Yachting Commandments”—and the additional suggestions below—don’t be afraid to change the route and improvise. Don’t set the route in ‘stone’, so you can leave room to explore something you didn’t find in your research or for changing weather conditions. It is always good to factor in some extra time or a ‘lazy day’.\n\nThe thing is, route planning does not end with setting sail. At sea, one always needs to adapt to the weather and wind direction. So, if your planned route does not work with the weather forecast, just change it.\n\nIt also doesn’t make sense to fight against strong winds for hours, when half the crew are seasick and when you could use the tailwind to sail comfortably to another beautiful spot. In short, wind direction is the most important deciding factor regarding the route.\n\nIf one follows these and the suggestions below, they will, most likely, fulfill all of their requirements and expectations and enjoy the journey so much that, while coming into their final harbor, they are thinking about where they want to go next.\n\n– “A.P.E.M.”\n\nIf you have done any ‘structured’ learning, you have probably come across the acronym A.P.E.M. It stands for Appraise, Plan, Execute, and Monitor.\n\nConcerning sailing, it helps a beginner to remember the most important things regarding planning a journey route:\n\nAppraise:\n\nAll available information: Boat; Crew; Weather; Tide; Route; Hazards en route; Passage times; Aids to navigation\n\nPlan:\n\nDeparture and arrival; Constraints; Critical times such as tide gates, pilotage plans, and ports of refuge; Track line laid on the best-scale charts\n\nExecute:\n\nMake the passage according to the plan, taking into account the prevailing conditions; “Living Document” (Review/change in case of any special circumstances\n\nMonitor:\n\nProgress against the plan/planned route; Vessels Position (DR; Electronic navigation; Celestial; Pilotage)\n\n– Passage Plan ‘Checklist’\n\nThe following is a reasonably comprehensive ‘checklist’ for planning a journey on a sailboat.

The whole family piled into a vehicle and began driving to a specific destination. At some point along the journey, there was some road construction we did not know about. We then consulted a map or paid attention to the directions on our smartphone when it said “Recalculating.” So, to successfully get to our destination, we had to make midcourse corrections.\n\nLife is just like that. We set a goal one day and the next day we find ourselves going in a direction that will not lead us to that goal. Without careful monitoring and midcourse corrections, we can find ourselves ‘off track’ and, most likely, will not reach our destination.\n\nNOT A STRAIGHT ‘LINE’\n\nBeing in the mortgage business, Steve Strick (VP of New American Funding) has seen a lot of changes in his industry in recent years and has had to make a variety of midcourse corrections. He says that when striving to reach important goals that challenge you, your process may not always be straightforward. You may think you are doing all the right things, expecting to reach a goal soon, when an obstacle is thrown your way, or maybe you realize the ‘road’ you were on is no longer taking you where you need to go. In either scenario, it is important to have the skill of midcourse correction. This skill is all about overcoming challenges, learning from failure, and planning a new, more effective route to take.\n\nSteve says that the first part of establishing the skill of course correction is acknowledging that there are almost always MANY ‘PATHS’ that can lead to the achievement of a goal. It may sound simple, but some people develop a one-track perspective that causes them to believe there’s only one clear way to reach their goal. In reality, the avenue to success is often winding and full of turns and adjustments along the way. So, accepting that there are multiple ways to achieve success is the first step to navigating those roads gracefully.\n\nSteve then suggests that stubbornness and perfectionist tendencies can often prevent people from exercising course correction. If your outlook on failure is that of a perfectionist, you may have an underlying fear of failure that is holding you back. Perfectionists tend to have very high standards for themselves and equally high expectations for their achievement. This means that they may be less apt to admit mistakes or acknowledge failure. So, when you are working away towards a goal and you realize you’ve made some mistakes, ignoring them only prolongs your reaching success. In practicing course correction, you will ‘own’ and acknowledge the risks, mistakes, and failures you have experienced, learning what you can from them, and using that information to adjust your direction forward.\n\nThe point of course correction is to work at shifting your path along the way, not just when you feel you’ve reached a dead end. Aim to practice this skill throughout your journey so you can catch errors and misdirection early on. Review your plan and progress, and try to predict your projected path from here on out regularly. Determine if you’re still on the successful path from which you set out. If not, you’ll have the chance to re-navigate yourself in a direction that’s better set up for your success, without wasting valuable time moving in a direction that isn’t getting you closer to your goal. Being proactive is a major key to successful course correction.\n\nMIDCOURSE CORRECTIONS HELP ONE ‘ACHIEVE MORE’\n\nPeople with high pride and perfectionist qualities may see the act of midcourse correction as a sign of a fault or weakness. However, it is often these adjustments that set one up for ‘GREATER’ SUCCESS. Rather than stubbornly continuing along the same path that is full of obstacles or pointing you in an unhelpful direction, midcourse correction helps one to acknowledge their mistakes head-on and to grow from them.\n\nIn the same way that a GPS must occasionally ‘recalculate’—finding the best route—to reach one’s goals sometimes requires adjustments in their ‘navigating’. The need for midcourse correction is often a sign that one is taking the right kind of risks and is actively pursuing their goal. The ability to recognize when it is time to make a shift—and to be willing to make the change—can dramatically accelerate one’s progress towards their goal.\n\nDON’T JERK THE ‘WHEEL’\n\nMany new car drivers are in a constant state of tension and anxiety—although they don’t realize it at the time. The thing is, when someone is in a ‘state of panic’ they don’t make very good decisions—and this usually causes them to make a lot of mistakes on the road.\n\nAs an example, it is like when you’re late to work and in your rush to get out the door you stub your toe, spill your coffee, and seem to hit every red light only to get into work and be late for your first meeting. You are speeding down the road and your thoughts are racing down your to-do list (You are still trying to scarf down your breakfast with one hand off the wheel and ladies are also trying to put on their lipstick!)\n\nThen, ‘boom’, you look up and there is the expressway exit you need to take! You throw down your breakfast sandwich, jerk the wheel cutting off two other cars, and risking other potential accidents.\n\nThis is how MOST attempt to ‘course correct’ their lives. The thing is, it doesn’t work in life, as well as with a sailboat! One needs to slow you down just a bit and allow themselves to start ‘gently’ shifting their life in the direction they want it to go, without leaving a ton of ‘collateral’ damage.\n\nTINY ACTIONS; LASER ‘FOCUS’\n\nAnother mistake so many people make in a swift desire to change their lives is that they take BIG, massive action.\n\nSomeone who has never worked out, joins the gym, buys a whole new wardrobe, cuts their calories in half, and goes hard at the gym every day for 7 days and then quits, burns out, never goes again—and calls themselves a failure.\n\nThe thing is, big, giant action does not work, especially if you have spent an entire lifetime doubting what you are capable of. What it requires is massive internal shifts and tiny external steps.\n\nSo, to reach one’s destination, it is sometimes required to ‘pivot’ and adjust one’s plan—even in the middle of the journey.\n\nThe term midcourse correction was coined in the late 1950s to describe the “navigational corrections made by a ship or a spacecraft during a journey to ensure it makes it to its destination.” For these mid-course corrections to be effective, the crew needs to have a plan for getting to where it is going and know that corrections might be necessary.\n\nSo, by following the following four steps, one can identify when they are ‘drifting’ off course and begin to effectively steer it back ‘on track’.\n\n– Identify your destination with clear learning goals and appropriate expectations\n\n– Plan your route by creating a reasonable progression with multiple options\n\n– Check your course with formative assessments\n\n– Correct the course by anticipating pitfalls, making midcourse corrections\n\nMidcourse corrections require front-end planning, but they ensure that one will successfully reach their destination.\n\nDEALING WITH COMMON TRAVEL ‘PROBLEMS’\n\nAuthor and travel blogger Adam Fraiel—of NomadicVA.com—is an experienced “worldpacker,” a very experienced worldwide traveler of many years.\n\nAdam mentions that the best solution to most travel problems is ‘PREPARATION’. Sometimes one will need to be creative and resourceful with your solutions but this is also one of the ‘joys’ of traveling. One can’t prepare for every eventuality, but know that no problem is insurmountable.\n\nWhile the situations and specific circumstances may differ, there are common problems that happen to all travelers eventually. Having experienced many problems over the years, Adam has some suggestions for 10 of the most common travel problems and how to avoid them.\n\n– Getting Lost\n\nSome people have fantastic spatial awareness, others not so much, but most people have gotten lost at least once in their life. It can be a horrible feeling—your heart beating faster as the panic starts to rise. You can get lost anywhere: a supermarket, airport, town center, or in the wilderness.\n\nWith modern technology, this is one of the easier travel problems to avoid. Today almost everyone has a smartphone. Before you leave, download Google Maps and then download the offline map for whichever cities you will be visiting. (With the offline map on your phone you can browse even without an Internet connection.)\n\nThe most important thing is to not panic. If you can, take a seat and take some slow breaths. Strangers are generally nice and helpful so, if it is safe to do so, ask for directions. If you don’t speak the language you can show them the written address.\n\n– Getting Mugged\n\nSome countries are more dangerous than others. It is important to check for any government warnings before you visit. It is also advisable to check Facebook groups and other forums for the opinions of other travelers.\n\nThe first thing you need to do is report it to the police. You will need a “Crime Reference Number” to claim on your insurance.\n\nOnce that is done it is time to deal with the emotional side. You are allowed to feel anger, rage, and frustration, but you have to learn to let it go—they are ‘destructive’ emotions. The majority of the world is awesome people. Don’t let a few idiots ruin your journey.\n\n– Losing Your Phone\n\nThe thing is, most people do EVERYTHING with their phones these days. Without it, one can’t find locations like their hotel, translate into a different language, pay for things, alert their family that it had been stolen, access their travel e-tickets, and much more.\n\nLogging in from a foreign computer usually requires answering additional security questions, and then they helpfully offer to text a code to your phone. Not helpful when the phone is lost!\n\nSo, make sure you know all your passwords, update all your account details before leaving, and have a backup e-mail address to receive those security codes.\n\nThis is one of the more common travel problems as mobile phones are big business all over the world. Your shiny new iPhone could be a year’s worth of wages for a local.\n\nThe solution is to use common sense and not wave it around in public. As with all valuables, keep them out of plain sight and, wherever possible, on your person or locked in a safe.\n\n– Getting Sick\n\nTravel sickness is caused when signals from your inner ear don’t match up with your visual signals. For some people, it happens every time they travel. Others only suffer on certain types of transport.\n\nOf course, travel sickness medication is the first thing to try. Then, just try and limit ‘stimulation’. Distract yourself and take your mind off the feeling, either via conversation, music, counting things out the window, etc. Replace the sensory malfunction with another sensory input.\n\nIf you can get access to fresh air and a drink of water then hopefully you can calm the feeling and focus on other happier thoughts.\n\nJet lag is one of the lesser travel problems. While many people use jet lag just to mean tired, it is an actual condition. It’s caused when your natural body clock gets out of sync after crossing time zones. Your body still thinks it’s one time but the world is operating at a different time.\n\nSymptoms of jet lag can include tiredness or restlessness and an inability to sleep. There are a few different approaches to getting over it. You can either try and sleep it off, but this could mean missing time at the start of your trip. I prefer exercise. When you get to your destination try and be as active as possible.\n\nGo out, walk a lot, get lots of fresh air"
