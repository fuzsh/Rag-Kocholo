        "text": "Your value-focused Pantheon guide: What to know when visiting the Pantheon for the first time.\n\nWe were granted complimentary media accommodations at Hotel Canada. All research, writing, and opinions are our own. Note that some links in this post may be affiliate links, which means we are paid a small commission should you make a purchase.\n\nThere are few places in Western Europe as important as Rome's Pantheon. This ancient temple turned Catholic church is unmatched in terms of its significance regarding architectural, political, and religious importance. It's an amazing place to visit and I make a point of stopping by every time I'm in Rome. If your plans will take you into Rome for the first time or the tenth, we have the ultimate Pantheon guide to help you get the most out of your visit and make the most of your money. Here's what you need to know before you go.\n\nPantheon facts, figures, and records\n\nThe Pantheon's oculus\n\nThe Pantheon in Rome is a record holder - in so many ways! For instance, it is the most complete ancient building (125 AD) in the city. Given the massive number of ancient buildings scattered throughout Rome, this is absolutely remarkable. It still holds the record for world’s largest unreinforced concrete dome. Yep, ancient Rome's engineers knew what they were doing! And, until the 20th century, the Pantheon held the record for being the largest concrete structure in the world.\n\nWhile it's a bit harder to quantify, the Pantheon's influence in the world of art and design remains unparalleled. For instance, its Rotunda is still considered an example of architectural perfection. The space is so perfectly designed that you could fit a 43.3 meter sphere in the center. Michelangelo was enamored with the dome and studied it intensely before he started working on the dome of St Peter's Basilica.\n\nMy favourite of all Pantheon facts is that, as old as the Pantheon is, it's not actually the original building on the site. The original building was built between 25-27 BC, commissioned by Marcus Agrippa - a Roman statesman, architect, and general, under the reign of Augustus, the first Roman Emperor. However, a devastating fire in 80 AD meant that a rebuild was in order. The Pantheon was reconstructed again under Emperor Domitian but it burnt AGAIN in 110 AD, the victim of a lighting strike. The building you see today is actually the third Pantheon, built between 118-125 AD during the reign of Hadrian.\n\nWho is buried in the Pantheon?\n\nAlter of the Pantheon\n\nThe Pantheon was first a temple, and then a church. But your average Pantheon guide often fails to mention that the building isn't just a church. It's also a graveyard!\n\n​Of everyone who is buried in the Pantheon, the most \"popular\" is the artist Raphael. If you love books and movies, you probably remember seeing Raphael's tomb as an \"Angels and Demons\" filming site in Rome! Raphael is afforded a position of honor, with a sculpture by his student, Madonna del Sasso, located above his tomb. The tomb to the right is that of his fiance, Maria Antonietta di Bibbiena.\n\nAlso buried in the Pantheon is Victor Emmanuel II, the first king of Italy. You'll be able to identify his tomb as it's marked by a statue of an eagle. The engraved phrase \"Padre della Patria\" roughly translates to \"Father of the Homeland\". During my visit, his tomb was also marked by the presence of some wreaths and flowers. I think there was a national holiday earlier in the week and thus Victor Emmanuel II was remembered.\n\nFinally, there is the tomb of King Umberto I, son of Victor Emmanuel II. Italian food fans will likely know his name as Umberto was married to Margherita of Savoy, the namesake behind Italy's beloved classic Margherita pizza. She is entombed in the Pantheon as well. His tomb is recognizable thanks to a stone pillow with a replica of the Iron Crown of Lombardy.\n\nAlso buried in the Pantheon are painter Annibale Carracci, composer Arcangelo Corelli, and architect Baldassare Peruzzi.\n\nDo you need Pantheon tickets? Is there a Pantheon entry fee?\n\nNo lines!\n\nIs the Pantheon free? You bet it is! There is absolutely no kind of Pantheon admission whatsoever. Fellow frugal travelers, rejoice! You also don't need any Pantheon tickets to be admitted. You just walk on in. There is no security system or line up (though it can be rather crowded inside during peak hours).\n\nIf anyone tries to sell you a Rome package that \"includes\" Pantheon tickets or the Pantheon entry fee, know that they're really selling you a proverbial load of bricks. If, however, the package includes a guided tour at the Pantheon, that would be different as it would be a value-added service.\n\nA few years ago, the Italian government announced that there would be a 2 Euro per person fee starting in May 2018, which didn't go into effect. If you read something about a 2 Euro admission fee, it's referring to this (failed) plan.\n\nPantheon opening hours and best times to visit\n\nVisiting bright and early.\n\nPaying attention to the Pantheon opening times is EVERYTHING! We had a calm, quiet, relaxed visit when we arrived just after the Pantheon opened for the day. But when we strolled by less than two hours later, the crowds had swelled. Trust me, when you're figuring out what the Pantheon hours are, you're going to want to make an early morning visit a top priority.\n\nThe Pantheon (Rome) hours are:\n\nMonday to Saturday: 8:30 am to 7:30 pm. The last admission is at 7:15 pm.\n\nSundays: 9:00 am to 6:00 pm. The last admission is at 5:45 pm.\n\n​\n\nHolidays: 9:00 am to 1:00 pm. The last admission is at 12:45 pm.\n\nClosed: New Year's Day (January 1), May 1, and Christmas (December 25). The Pantheon is also closed for visits when mass is celebrated (Saturdays and days before holidays: 5.00 pm and Sundays: 10.30 am).\n\nSpecial dates: On April 21st at noon, sunlight enters the Pantheon through the oculus and hits the door dead on. April 21st is considered the founding date of Rome and historians believe the Pantheon was purposefully built around this lighting effect. And in mid-May (the date changes each year), rose petals, representing the blood of Christ, are sprinkled through the oculus to celebrate Pentecost. Both of these occassions are open to the public.\n\nBest time to see the beam of light from the oculus: If you can't make it on April 21, go any sunny day between 11:00 am to 1:00 pm. Sure, it's busier at this time. But seeing the powerful beam of light stream down from the oculus (the opening in the ceiling) is pretty special.\n\nVisiting during rain and snow: Yes, the Pantheon IS open during poor weather, including rain and snow. The floor is slopped ever so slightly towards the center drain, so even though rain can come in through the oculus, it quickly drains out. And the effect of seeing a gentle mist or peaceful, fluffy snow stream through the oculus is magical. Bonus: Bad weather keeps most visitors away so you'll have a more private experience.\n\nAttending Mass at the Pantheon\n\nMass and even weddings are celebrated here.\n\nYes, you can attend mass at the Pantheon! It is technically a church (since around the 600s AD). It's name is Sancta Maria ad Martyres or Saint Mary and the Martyrs. Informally, it's known as \"Saint Mary of the Rotunda\".\n\n​\n\nThe mass current schedule is Saturdays and days before holidays: 5.00 pm and Sundays: 10.30 am. The staff will try to shoo away anyone who's not attending mass at that time but if you tell them you are staying to attend church it will be okay. As always, remember to dress and act appropriately for an active house of worship.\n\nSpeaking of etiquette, silence and decorum is encouraged at all time at the Pantheon as this is both a historic site and a house of worship. Photos are allowed but tripods are not, nor can you lie on the floor (to get an epic shot of the oculus from the ground up).\n\nVisiting the Pantheon at night\n\nHead on up to the front doors and peak inside!\n\nOverall, the Pantheon opening times are pretty generous and allow for both early morning and early evening visits. While I'm a big fan of showing up first thing to take advantage of the early Pantheon opening times, there's no reason why an evening visit can't work. The average visitor spends about 20 minutes at the Pantheon (and, frankly, some people just spend about 5 minutes and that's alright too). I think it's much better to have a super short visit if the Pantheon hours aren't perfect for you than to not visit at all.\n\nBut what happens if your only opportunity to visit is much later at night when the Pantheon is long closed? I still think you should go! First of all, the exterior of the Pantheon is beautiful. You don't want to miss it.\n\nSecondly, if you go up to the front doors, there is a tiny sliver of space between them and if you line up your eye JUST right, you can see inside. Sure, it's dark but you can see the beam of moonlight streaming through the dome's opening and hitting the ground. The large doors are a touch too small for their frame as they are not the original doors but rather 15th century replacements, slightly imperfect and thus ideal for sneaking a quick peek. This is exactly how I saw the Pantheon for the first time and while I was disappointed I wasn't at the Pantheon during opening hours, it was still really cool to have my own mini-experience at night.\n\nFinally, there's a lot of action happening outside the Pantheon at night. Sure, it's the kind of action that involves touts trying to sell glow stick-esque toys and other novelties but it's entertaining people-watching all the same.\n\n​In short - GO. A night time visit to the Pantheon is pretty cool.\n\nPantheon trip tips and reminders\n\nStudying my guidebook as I go.\n\nThere are lots of unofficial and semi-official folks hanging out by the front doors, offering to be your Pantheon guide - for a fee, of course! I personally wasn't interested in their services, but if you are, be sure to ask closely what exactly get for your money and be fearless negotiating on the price. There's a good chance that they'll just follow the same script you'd find in any standard guidebook. On the other hand, they might be informative, personable, and a great source of recommendations.\n\nSpeaking of guidebooks.... You'll find Pantheon guidebooks for sale inside for about 6 Euros, as well as audio guides loaded with a 35 minute program for 5 Euros. If you're keen on guidance and information but not so into human interaction, this is a great choice. Of course, you can always use your own guidebook. I used a Lonely Planet Rome city guide and a Rick Steves Pocket Rome guide during my trips to Rome and together they were perfect.\n\nRome is notorious for its pickpockets. Thankfully - knock on wood! - we haven't had a single negative experience. But given the density of awe-struck and thus distracted tourists around the Pantheon, you can bet that pickpockets are hanging out there too. Use your usual sensible travel precautions. Instead of an over-the-shoulder, open style tote bag, use a bag which zips and locks, like a backpack or a cross body messenger bag.\n\nFinally, remember that the Pantheon experience doesn't begin and end with just one building. The square immediately outside the Pantheon, the Piazza della Rotonda, is a lively spot. It's home to the Fontana del Pantheon, a beautiful fountain, as well as the Obelisco Macutèo, originally from the Temple of Ra in Heliopolis.\n\nTaking the Metro - Pantheon options\n\nRome's Metro is great - but it won't get you to the Pantheon.\n\nAggravatingly, there is no Metro station near the Pantheon. This is typical for a lot of Rome's attractions. Relative to its size, Rome has one of the smallest subway systems in the world, thanks in large part to the challenges of excavating in and around ancient ruins.\n\nThe closest Metro stop is Spagna (the Spanish Steps), which is 1.1 km away. Colosseo (the Colosseum) is 1.8 km away. Termini (Central Station) is 2.5 km away, which sounds FAR but it's really just about a 30 minute walk and Termini is a pretty easy spot to get to - the red and blue Metro lines intersect here and, of course, all the trains pull in here too.\n\nAs there is no Metro station nearby, bus is your best public transportation option if you don't want to walk very much. The nearby Piazza Argentina (Largo di Torre Argentina) is a major bus hub and just 700 meters from the Pantheon. Frequent buses include the 40, 60 and 64 and they shuttle between the Vatican, the centre of the city and then finish up at Termini Station. Closest of all is Piazza Navona, just 300 meters away. Popular bus routes which stop here include the 70, 87, and 492. (I usually use the Rome2Rio app for navigating routes with transit options and it was - perhaps unsurprisingly - very helpful in Rome.)\n\nSeeing the best of Rome: The Colosseum to Pantheon walking route\n\nThe overall route: The Colosseum to the Pantheon\n\nThe first half, from the Colosseum to Piazza Venezia, taking in the ancient ruins along Via dei Fori Imperiali.\n\nOne option for the second section, from Piazza Venezia to Largo di Torre Argentina to the Pantheon.\n\nSure, it's not the most direct route from a Metro, but there are a lot of advantages of walking from the Colosseum to the Pantheon, beyond just seeing two important sites in one visit. First, the Colosseo Metro stop is directly next to the Colosseum. It couldn't be a better place to start. Secondly, there's a lot you can see as you make your way from the Colosseum to the Pantheon.\n\nThe first half of the walk, from the Colosseum to Piazza Venezia, goes along Via dei Fori Imperiali. Along the way it goes through parts of the Forum of Trajan, which dates to 112 AD,Forum of Augustus, which dates to 2 BC, andForum of Nerva, completed in 97 AD. Amazing!\n\nDuring the second part of the walk, depending on which route you choose, will take you past piazzas and fountains and churches. If you aren't going to be swinging by Piazza Argentina (Largo di Torre Argentina) as part of your transit route home, do so now so you can see the ongoing excavations of the ruins - this is where Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC and where several hundred cats have taken over and live in a semi-official cat sanctuary today!\n\nTracking down a decent Pantheon restaurant\n\nYou know the drill. The closer a restaurant is to a major tourist attraction like the Pantheon, the worse it has to be, right? If you want a phenomenal restaurant, Pantheon-adjacent, you might be in for a rough time. It's not that the places on the square are bad but there are better and cheaper spots just a few blocks away.\n\nHowever, I still have a Pantheon restaurant recommendation for anyone who wants or needs to eat right there. Ristorante Di Rienzo, situated on the Piazza della Rotonda (the square in front of the Pantheon), is a decent choice. I've actually been there twice! The first was on our introductory tour in 2016, discovering the city's main sights at night with City Wonders's walking tour (an awesome choice for a walking tour of Rome - we loved it). The tour included appetizers and wine and this was our stop. And then in 2018, our LivItaly small group Rome food tour stopped here to sample carbonara.\n\nI've often wondered how two very different tours came to include Ristorante Di Rienzo on their itineraries. Maybe the restaurant is very business savvy and reaches out to tour operators, emphasizing their ease at accommodating groups. Maybe they are much more busy during the day when the Pantheon is open and found a clever way to encourage night time traffic? Perhaps, while the food isn't the most spectacular in Rome, it's the most solid and dependable choice next to such a hugely popular spot.\n\nIf you're there, I can recommend the carbonara (it's made with spaghetti, which I like) and finger food style appetizers like bruschetta. And I can also recommend their clean washrooms! Both times I've been there, the staff were friendly and the service was good. Based on my experience, I'd give the food about a 5 out of 10, but would raise it to a 7 out of ten for location and washrooms!\n\nBest places to stay in Rome, Italy\n\nOur top choice among the best places to stay in Rome, Italy, is Hotel Canada (BW Premier Collection by Best Western). Yes, I completely admit that I fell in love with the property's name. The family which started the hotel lived in Canada for a number of years before moving back to Italy. And just as I hoped, Hotel Canada lived up to its cozy name. The rooms are beautifully furnished and come complete with desks, arm chairs, and bathrooms with deluxe toiletries and bathtubs (my favourite!) The look is absolute opulence but the price is pure affordability. With advanced booking, theprice can be as low as under $15o US (including a fantastic breakfast).\n\nHotel Canada is located just a few minute's walk from Termini, which is extremely convenient for transportation needs. However, it's on a quiet street with pretty buildings, so there's none of the station's noise or soot. And while I can't stay that it's the closest hotel to the Pantheon, it was within easy walking distance to visit everything on our Rome wish list.\n\nPut the Pantheon on your bucket list"
