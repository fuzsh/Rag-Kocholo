What are our best options at getting there? I know we can get a flight at 11:45am from Madrid to Santiago for like 40.00. My biggest concern is getting from Santiago to Sarria. Another option I saw was a bus or train straight from Madrid to Sarria but I can't find a schedule for train times.\n\nCWBuff\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nFrances & Finisterre 05-07/22 Fran 26? d Nort 27?\n\nMar 6, 2024\n\n#2\n\nHello and welcome to the Forum\n\nFor preliminary ideas of how to get from point A to point B you can use Rome2Rio - it works pretty good and lots of Forum members use it\n\nre: schedules for the train times - you are from US so i take it 10/2 means October 2nd. if so - you are too early for those schedules to be posted.

There is only one direct train. The alternatives require a change in Ourense. There are multiple train connections between Santiago and Sarria, again, there is only one direct train. The alternatives require a change in Ourense. When it comes to buses the availability becomes more generous but there is only one direct bus a day.

Either way it will be a long day for you...you can sleep or doze on the train or a bus.\n\nLast edited: Mar 7, 2024\n\namgrem\n\nNew Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nFrances Route, Oct 2024\n\nMar 7, 2024\n\n#14\n\nNot nessisarily quicker with a plane and bus since you have to go to Lugo and transfer, but maybe.

There are some \"works\" on the line which decrease the number of trains per day to Santiago although the number of tickets are the same, but that may have impeded the the Sarria direct train. Not sure. Last summer we had to get on a bus at Ourense due to some train works on that stretch. The bus was engaged by Renfe so we did not have to buy a separate ticket.\n\nAs an explanation, the same line serves Santiago and Sarria, but diverge at Ourense."
