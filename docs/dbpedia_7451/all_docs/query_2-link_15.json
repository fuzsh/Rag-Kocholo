        "text": "Travel review website TripAdvisor has announced that it is acquiring San Francisco-based Viator for approximately $200 million, \"substantially\" in cash. Viator is a website operated by travel insiders that curate the best local tours and activities, which have been visited by over 3 million people. Viator has more than 20,000 bookable tours and 600,000 reviews submitted by travelers, spanning over 1,500 destinations.\n\n\"Travelers want to explore local attractions while on their trip, and Viator's depth and breadth in global attractions combined with their seamless booking experience will provide immediate benefit to our community, whether in the planning phase or on the trip,\" said TripAdvisor president and CEO Stephen Kaufer in a statement.\n\nViator works with local operators to set up travelers with tours and activities. Viator is available in 10 languages and supports 10 currencies. The activities can be booked online in advance through the Viator Tours & Activities App. Viator also provides the activities through more than 3,000 affiliate partners, including airlines, hotels and travel agencies. Viator was founded by Rod Cuthbert, who is now the CEO of another travel startup called Rome2Rio.\n\nThe acquisition is subject to customary conditions and is expected to close in the third quarter of 2014. Viator is TripAdvisor's fourth acquisition this year after lafourchette, Tripbod and Vacation Home Rentals.\n\nFounded in 2000, TripAdvisor is one of the largest travel websites with nearly 280 million unique monthly visitors. There are over 170 million reviews on TripAdvisor that covers more than 4 million hotels, restaurants and tourist attractions. TripAdvisor operates in 43 countries across the world and runs 17 brands including TripAdvisor, Airfarewatchdog, BookingBuddy, FlipKey, GateGuru, OneTime, SeatGuru, Tingo, Jetsetter and TravelPod.\n\nLast year, TripAdvisor broke ground at its new 282,000 square-foot campus, which is about double the size of the company's current location in Newton, Massachusetts. It will be able to accommodate 1,500 employees when it opens up next year.\n\nTripAdvisor was acquired by InterActiveCorp (IAC) in 2004. One year later, IAC spun off its travel unit under the Expedia brand. Three years ago, Expedia split into two publicly traded companies: Expedia and TripAdvisor. TripAdvisor now has market capitalization of about $14.5 billion and Expedia is slightly more than $10.3 billion.\n\nPeople take reviews on TripAdvisor very seriously. Millions of travelers look at TripAdvisor reviews before deciding where to visit. Accommodation brands know this, which is why some have paid people to write good TripAdvisor reviews about them. More than a couple dozen hotels were blacklisted by TripAdvisor as a result. TripAdvisor now has a verification process that considers the IP address and e-mail address of the authors.\n\nViator was founded 19 years ago in Sydney, Australia and disclosed $11.1 million in funding since then, including a $6 million Series B round in June 2006. Viator's investors include Technology Venture Partners and Carlyle Venture Partners.\n\nTripAdvisor partnered with Viator last year to help travelers find and book activities. Through the partnership, TripAdvisor and City Guides app users are able to click \"Book Now\" for direct access to Viator's worldwide tours. Some of the included activities were off limits to the public like gaining exclusive early entry to the Empire State Building's 86th floor and a private viewing of the Royal Quarters at the Palace of Versailles. The acquisition definitely solidifies the existing partnership between TripAdvisor and Viator.\n\nHave you used TripAdvisor or Viator before going on a trip?
