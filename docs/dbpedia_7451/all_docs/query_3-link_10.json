        "text": "Not sure where this goes but I'll write these stories as a case study.\n\n==background==\n\nI had an LLC who was the SEO department for a tech company. It was an SEO agency who had only one client. Then we merged.\n\nThe CTO also had an LLC and he was also the development department of the tech company. He had also one client and he and his employees merged too.\n\n==My case==\n\nI had a percentage of revenue contract and they wanted to turn me salary. I balked and argued and they eventually kicked me out.\n\n==The CTOs case==\n\nThis dude is a developer with an MBA. He played ball and became an employee. I could hear the regret in his voice when I talked to him on the phone about this. I didn't want it and pursued entrepreneurship and keeping my market exposure. I started another company.\n\nI checked with another former employee today and the tech company has an OKR to increase the amount of developers in their dev team. I get what the CTO is doing. Instead of asking for more sales or increasing the contract cost for the company -- which he can no longer do as an employee -- he is increasing the head count in his department so that he can manage more people and be paid a higher salary because of the people he is managing.\n\nHe switched from selling hours as an agency to selling reasons for a raise due to increase management duties.\n\n==Conclusion==\n\nSo, if you're ever at the point where your startup is going so well that there's a merger and you're forced into a cushy salary position, you can play a new game and just hire more people and \"solve problems\" by hiring someone to solve the problem. Then you can tell the company that your number of reports increase, which is more responsibility and an increased salary.\n\nNew game, new rules, new strategy.\n\nGood move on his part but I can earn more with a new company than I could in that company. This has more risk and he picked a safe route, since he has two kids. I am still young. Plus, the company is burdened by high development costs. They think that is their biggest asset but it isn't. They can't sell the development. The old CTO is a genius. Well play A..\n\nIf you don't know, I'm starting a competing company and my dev costs is $100/month or so whereas that is just 1 hour of A. breathing. I'm going to out manurer them so good as my company is light and agile. They're the behemoth now. I took out a few to make them the behemoth, now they are on my sights.\n\nIf each of those new employees generate more revenue than the cost to employ them, then, yeah, works out great for everyone. The company makes more profit, grows, and the manager should be rewarded with more pay/incentives/perks/growth opportunity/ etc. But if those employee aren't pulling their weight, and it's costing more money to employ them than what they generate, then it is going to fall on the manager's shoulders - as they are the one responsible for their department. And when taking a deeper look at it if it turns out the manager was hiring based on their own personal agenda, rather than the values and goals of the company, then it would be time to fire that manager. And fire all those new employees that are dead weight.\n\nThe manager would not only be responsible for getting himself fired, they would also be indirectly responsible for the suffering of those new employees who shouldn't have been hired.\n\nWould also be a time to review the hiring processes, because how was a person like that (the manager) hired in the first place?\n\nIn saying that, I realize it all depends on the culture/values/goals of the company and what they choose to incentivize. If a company doesn't base pay/rewards on performance, and then incentivizes hiring without any thought to the consequences (both beneficial and harmful), and how to encourage/prevent those consequences through additional checks and balances, then you can end up in situation where people take advantage to the detriment of the company. Bloated departments, processes, low morale, degradation, and a huge waste of resources. No bueno.\n\nBut how would the manager’s manager (in this case the two co founders) know how much an employee is generating in revenue? They don’t. It is totally subjective. Unless they are salesmen, there’s no way to know exactly an employees direct contribution to the company’s bottom line. It isn’t a clear metric.\n\nOnce you have buy in and the numbers are good, adding a few extra staff to boost your head count isn’t hard. You can just take a task that used to go to one person and make it a new employees whole responsibility. Then you can say it is scaling and increased capabilities.\n\nthe marxists did this since they used the labor theory of value. They had a guy in the bus sell the ticket, another collects the ticket, and another drives the bus. You can do the same thing with your department. As long as the 20% that generates results get results, there can be an 80% “padding” to boost your own salary.\n\nlet’s say the difference between senior SEO manager and head of SEO is €40,000 (€80,000 vs €120,000), wouldn’t you do it to pad your responsibilities, title, and pay? You can just hire the 80% padding employees based upon likability so you have a pleasant day at work. You’ll be surrounded by them all workday anyways.\n\nim not saying to hire all BS roles but hire more than absolutely needed just to give yourself a raise. Making an argument for your next raise is always a good idea\n\nSome positions aren't directly tied to generating revenue like a salesman, however, in some form, every position is either growing revenue, protecting it, or both. All positions should have goals to hit, that are in alignment with department/company goals, and they should be tracked with quantifiable metrics. If any position is lacking metrics to hit, that is a failure of leadership.\n\nIf the goal is hit xx revenue for the year, you figure out what specific things can you track that will lead to that revenue goal. What processes are needed to get you there. While you can't actually know how much money you will be making by Dec 2023, you CAN know that you're hitting the metrics and milestones needed - executing on the processes that lead to that revenue goal.\n\nThus, when reviewing monthly numbers it will be easy to see that these metrics are not being hit, who is not hitting them, and who is responsible.\n\nBut anyway, really, if a manager is hiring people to pad their pay, and it's an ongoing thing without being caught, that's a failure of leadership to begin with. That means there's a lack of values, vision, metrics, direction, incentives, accountability, morality, and so on. In essence, it's a shitty company due to shitty leadership, that's hiring shitty employees.\n\nA company that values performance will not increase a managers pay just for hiring more people. You have more responsibilities? Ok, great. That's what you're supposed to be doing, taking on more responsibilities. But are you performing? Are you hitting the goals and metrics that were established beforehand? Is your department hitting them? Are the employees in that department hitting them? If not, not only are you, the manager, failing but now you just reduced the company profitability, and wasted tons of resources (time hiring, training, managing, and money) by hiring all the employees that weren't actually needed. And now more time will be spent on firing them, the exit process, and so on.\n\nHowever, hah, if working for a company that lacks the things I mentioned above, and they don't value performance, then yes, you could do what you're talking about in order to increase your pay.\n\nI will say this though, and perhaps it may help, but you're going through a bunch of mental hoops in order to find some way to \"cheat\" the system. As if you feel compelled to cause hurt. Not only will that trait not serve you, it will hinder your progress. I believe your worldview is going to cause you to hire the type of employees you don't want, and will cause you you to distrust any good employees you have - as you will suspect them of doing the very things you might do.\n\nIt's time to level up man. You need to let the bullshit go and grow up. You say you want to create a serious company, so get serious.\n\nThat darkness though, that desire for revenge in you is useful. Use that as fuel. Use it to dominate. But don't allow it to consume you. Keep it under your control. Embrace it, shape it, direct it.\n\nBut how would the manager’s manager (in this case the two co founders) know how much an employee is generating in revenue? They don’t. It is totally subjective.

Making an argument for your next raise is always a good idea\n\nDepends on the company and how it is ran.\n\nFor example, I've worked in many companies prior where it was a \"sales organization\", meaning the owners were all sales-focused, so they looked at everything as sales/numbers.. even the departments and employees that were not \"sales\".\n\nEven past that, most companies will do this:\n\nAssign a value to a department. Say they track SEO is responsible for 37% of sales revenue ( gathered from UTMs in Analytics and other ways ). They won't be assigning anything for \"branding\" though.\n\nIf it's an org that does 5m a year, then SEO is responsible for 1.85m.\n\nThey then divide the number of employees in SEO by 1.85m. If 10 employees, then each is counted as 185,000. Now take total payroll and benefits and add some margin ( bc the company doesn't want to be breaking even on payroll ) and if over/under, decide if hiring or firing is needed.\n\nThat's how ALMOST all companies work that have more than 50 employees.\n\nIs it right or wrong? Ehhh... but it's reality.\n\nNot many companies are pegging direct revenue to 1 employee, so they don't need to know how profitable each indiv employee is. They just know they need to cut back or hire more in general and other factors decide who gets fired past that. Like, how well liked someone is or culture fit they are... etc.\n\nSome positions aren't directly tied to generating revenue like a salesman, however, in some form, every position is either growing revenue, protecting it, or both.

Use it to dominate. But don't allow it to consume you. Keep it under your control. Embrace it, shape it, direct it.\n\nDude, from here https://www.buildersociety.com/thre...king-a-startup-from-36-000-to-6-000-000.6435/ it is obvious that the company I was in was toxic and under bad management. They even under-paid my bonus and gave me a non-disclosure statement during the bonus payment. Of course anyone under a broken system would cheat the system. Fuck those owners. I'm glad a work for the competitor now and my new boss/client is awesome. He actually appreciates me. Plus, no meetings\n\nAnd yes, revenge is a motivation for me but it can't be the main pursuit I'm saving up for financial independence and early retirement! It is just an added bonus that working for the competition takes money away from my old bosses. Very sweet.\n\nThey also fired half of my department after they fired me. Now parts of the fired crew work for me for the competitor to make revenge too. Plus, the employees in the company are giving us data to help us out as they might be fired any day and want to make a safety net with me in my new company. Smart of them!\n\nAs they say, if you buy cheap, you buy expensive! Old bosses were being cheap as fuck when they replaced me! Now they're being expensive\n\nAlso, yes, I'm well aware that the old company was toxic. What I learned from it is to give employees what they really want, which is financial security. In an era where companies replace people left and right, I offer long term employment and financial security and peace of mind. My guys have been with me since 2017. It has been 5 years. Some even worked a few hours here and there for free, to help me out. Two even meet IRL and had a talk and both agreed that I was an awesome boss they even told me they'd leave their new jobs to work for me again Totally agree that the old company was toxic AF.\n\nDepends on the company and how it is ran.\n\nFor example, I've worked in many companies prior where it was a \"sales organization\", meaning the owners were all sales-focused, so they looked at everything as sales/numbers.. even the departments and employees that were not \"sales\".\n\nEven past that, most companies will do this:\n\nAssign a value to a department.

They just know they need to cut back or hire more in general and other factors decide who gets fired past that. Like, how well liked someone is or culture fit they are... etc.\n\nSo, yes, if your department is way high on the $/headcount ratio, just hire padder employees\n\nAlso, the guy that replaced me hired 3 other people to do my job. Dude's lazy as fuck and the company is just spinning its wheels now. My department was seriously super high $/employee.\n\nSome positions aren't directly tied to generating revenue like a salesman, however, in some form, every position is either growing revenue, protecting it, or both. All positions should have goals to hit, that are in alignment with department/company goals, and they should be tracked with quantifiable metrics.

Use it to dominate. But don't allow it to consume you. Keep it under your control. Embrace it, shape it, direct it.\n\nI re-read this and the premise that is off is that we were hitting out metrics. The company reached record highs when I was fired. What my post is about is finding ways to argue for a raise, when the company is doing well. I know my old bosses. They would not want to give me a raise out of the goodness of their hearts and if they did, it was cents on the dollar for the value I was creating. I got better raises when I was proactive about it instead of waiting for them to give me one.\n\nAlso, I'm reading The Worldly Philosphers by Robert Heilbroner right now. In chapter 8 he covers Thorstein Veblen. Veblen argues that the engineer is the one who creates the system that produces industry and the businessman is the one who sabotages it to create a profit. If a product takes $10 to produce, the businessman would sell it for $20 and take $10 for himself. This in itself is waste and is counter-productive as it reduces the amount of people who will obtain the product.\n\nIn defence of my post, it wasn't me being a bad manager. It was me being a good businessman. It was also my bosses being a good businessman and saving themselves $300,000 a year on just my salary. It then is also me being a good businessman and going where my skill is most valuable: to their competitor.\n\nThis is just how capitalism is. They are not toxic and I wasn't a bad manager. Capitalism is what is toxic, counter-productive, and wasteful. I'm just playing by the rules."
