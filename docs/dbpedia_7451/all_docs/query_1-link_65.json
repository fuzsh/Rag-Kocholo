        "text": "Want to know how to plan an Italy trip? You’ve come to the right place. Italy trip planning is one of our favorite things to do. So much so that we set up this website.\n\nWe wrote this article to take you step by step through planning your trip. From deciding when to go and how much it will cost to what to take and how to use your mobile phone, it’s all here to remove the overwhelm and make your trip planning easier. Even if you choose to hire a travel agent to assist with your bookings, it is a good idea to walk through these steps as it will help the agent build the best trip for you.\n\nYou can see an overview of the steps you need to follow in the article contents below. Follow our guide and you’ll be on your way to planning your own trip or choosing the right tour for you and your travel companions.\n\nStep 1 – Decide when you want to go and your budget\n\nWhen to go to Italy\n\nThere is no bad time to visit Italy but there may be one that suits you better. Depending on your interests and the places you want to see you need to be aware of seasonal differences that you need to know about:\n\nSummer – June to August: peak tourist season, weather is hot and prices higher. Many Italians are on vacation and the coastal areas are very busy especially in mid August\n\nFall / Autumn – September to November: September remains hot and busy in most of the major tourist centers. By October the weather is cooling and ferry services on the coast and lakes stop running. At this time grape harvest is in full swing. November is generally quite wet but there is lots of sunshine between the showers.\n\nWinter – December to February: As the weather cools so do the crowds. Attractions are much less busy and the lead up to Christmas is magical with lights and decorations in shop windows. In January and February restaurants in many coastal areas are closed. February’s Carnevale in Venice is generally one of the most expensive times to visit the city\n\nSpring – March to May: In March and April wildflowers bloom and the countryside is awash with color. Easter is a popular holiday for Europeans to visit Italian cities especially Rome, Florence and Venice.\n\nOur favorite time to visit Italy in the shoulder months. In April and May and October and November the weather is generally sunny and mild, the crowds are manageable and you can find great value deals on your flight and accommodation.\n\nAlthough we are past the worst of the pandemic and travel restrictions, things can change quickly – you can check our article Can you travel to Italy plus current situation. We update this regularly with the latest travel news.\n\nHow much will it cost?\n\nThis will depend on your expectations, interests and travel style. You can travel very cheaply in Italy if you visit lesser-known regional areas and avoid the big cities. Even in the big cities it is possible to find free attractions and budget accommodation if you know where to look.\n\nIf you want to see the main sights and enjoy experiences such as cooking classes, private boat cruises and wine tours then the sky is really the limit when it comes to cost.\n\nMost travelers fall somewhere in the middle however and a reasonable daily budget per person for food, transport and activities is around €100 on top of flights and accommodation.\n\nExpert Assistance\n\nNeed some help planning your trip?\n\nBook in for a trip consultation with our expert Italy travel planners ready to help you build your dream vacation in Italy whether that be a classic first timer trip or an off the beaten path adventure\n\nmore information\n\nStep 2 – Do some preliminary research and preparation\n\nWhere to research your trip to Italy\n\nFrom online news and magazines, blogs, Instagram, Facebook groups (check out Italy Travel Planning) and even podcasts like ours – there are thousands of resources online. I am sure you’ve already seen quite a few of them already. Sometimes endless options can be overwhelming so we recommend collecting ideas in an online folder or scrapbook and organizing them into destinations that you really want to see.\n\nYou’ll probably want to “do it all” but really have a think about your interests and what will best suit you and your travel style. Once you have some ideas, it’s best to consult a structured resource to check your assumptions and thoughts.\n\nGuidebooks\n\nTraditional guidebooks definitely have their place for planning a trip to Italy. Well researched and structured, they’ll give you in depth information on destinations and sights to see as well as practical tips to help you plan. Even after 30+ trips to Italy we still consult guidebooks for new destinations we want to visit. You can find our favorite Italy guidebooks here.\n\nItaly travel planners\n\nWe noticed that even guidebooks can provide too much information in the planning process so we created one page travel planners for the top places to visit in Italy. Our planners tell you the top sights, best viewpoints, must have experiences and our favorite places to eat (including best gelato stops) in each place.\n\nYou can print them off or keep them on your phone and there’s a link to an online map so you can map out your days. We have guides for Rome, Florence, Venice, Milan, Cinque Terre, Amalfi Coast and Sorrento. Our goal is always to simplify the trip planning process and we know you will find them useful.\n\nGroup tour itineraries\n\nTour companies – like ours! – put a lot of effort into designing tours that cover the main sights and even lesser known regions. They know the times it takes to get around and how long you can stay in each place to get a taste or feel for the destination.\n\nWe often check itineraries of places we would like to visit as an input into our own planning. Here are some recommended tour companies and itineraries to investigate.\n\nPrivate tours\n\nIf you want maximum flexibility and comfort, consider a private driving tour. From the moment you land, to when you depart, you’ll have a personal driver with local knowledge making sure your trip is exactly what you imagined.\n\nPassports and visas\n\nAt this stage of your planning it is a good idea to check the validity of your passport and if you require a visa. Citizens of the United States, Australia, Canada, United Kingdom and New Zealand may enter Italy and stay up to 90 days without a visa within an 180 day period. You must have 6 months validity on your passport when you enter Italy. Go and check this now as it can take several months for new passports to be processed.\n\nAll other nationalities should check this Italian government site that will walk you through whether a visa is required for your visit.\n\nCitizens of the European Union can travel with photo identification.\n\nPlease note – this information is subject to change and it is always best to check with your local foreign office for the latest advice on travel to Italy.\n\nUnited States – click here\n\nAustralia – click here\n\nUnited Kingdom – click here\n\nCanada – click here\n\nStep 3 – Confirm your itinerary\n\nItinerary planning is where many people get stuck. We understand. There are so many amazing places to see in Italy that deciding where to go and how much time to spend there can be hard. As a general rule, we like to spend a minimum of three nights in each place to minimize time spent traveling and also enjoy each place as much as possible. So if you have a 10 day trip then 3 main stops would be a good baseline to start with.\n\nWhere to go\n\nFrom your research, you probably have an idea of where you want to go. You may want to visit the popular cities and regions on your first trip however each city and region in Italy offers something special.\n\nMost popular cities\n\nMost popular regions\n\nOn our site, you can also browse Italy’s lesser-known cities and regions on the destinations page or visit our article on hidden gems in Italy for inspiration.\n\nItinerary suggestions\n\nAs a general rule, for a 3-5 day trip we suggest choosing one destination – a city or region. If you have a week to 10 days then you can plan 1-3 places in either the north OR south of Italy. In a two week trip you could cover 3-4 places and see both north and south.\n\nTry not to squeeze too much in. It’s easy to underestimate transit times and getting in and out of airports and train stations. Plus you want to have plenty of time to enjoy yourself and soak up every last moment.\n\nSuggested itineraries\n\nIf it is your first trip to Italy, like many first-time visitors you may choose to start your journey in Rome and visit Florence and Venice. This 10 day Italy itinerary covers that route. It includes detailed instructions on how to make the most of your time in Italy.\n\nAlternative 10 day itinerary suggestions\n\nMost people travel to Italy for 10 to 14 days so we built some itinerary suggestions to cater for that time frame that cover both northern and southern Italy.\n\nExpert Assistance\n\nNeed some help planning your trip?\n\nBook in for a trip consultation with our expert Italy travel planners ready to help you build your dream vacation in Italy whether that be a classic first timer trip or an off the beaten path adventure\n\nmore information\n\nGroup Tours\n\nPackaged group tours of Italy are a popular way to travel and avoid the stress of planning your own trip. They are also a great option if you would like some company along the way. Here is a quick summary of popular tour companies:\n\nUntold Italy small group tours – we run exclusive small group tours for food and wine-loving travelers wanting to get off the beaten path to see hidden Italy beyond the major cities and tourist areas. We lead groups of 14 people on journeys of discovery to experience the regions of Sicily, Puglia, Piedmont, Tuscany, Umbria, Bologna and surrounds, Capri and the Cilento coasts > learn more\n\nTrafalgar – popular and well respected brand appealing to the 50+ age group. Travel is by coach and the focus is on culture and history. Expect group sizes of 40-45 passengers and 4 star hotels. Trafalgar also include interesting local experiences such as wine tastings and unique stays in their itineraries. Check out their popular Best of Italy tour\n\nIntrepid Travel – small group tours with an average of 10 travelers with plenty of free time built in for exploring. Their popular Italy Real Food Adventure is an 8 day itinerary that showcases their travel style well\n\nPeregrine – Intrepid’s premium brand offers some interesting hiking tours of the Italian Lakes and Amalfi Coast\n\nTourradar – is a market place for group packaged tours where you can browse hundreds of package tours by different operators, and by date. You then filter by your interests and age group and read detailed reviews. You can browse fully organized tours to independent self-drive or train itineraries\n\nExpert Assistance\n\nNeed some help planning your trip?\n\nBook in for a trip consultation with our expert Italy travel planners ready to help you build your dream vacation in Italy whether that be a classic first timer trip or an off the beaten path adventure\n\nmore information\n\nStep 4 – Book your flights, inbound travel & insurance\n\nFlights to Italy\n\nIt is easy to fly direct (or with a single stop) into Italy from most places in the world. Rome Fiumicino [Leonardo da Vinci](FCO) international airport is the main hub for air traffic but you can also easily fly into Milan Malpensa (MXP) or Venice Marco Polo (VCE) airports from major hubs around the world.\n\nThere are many other airports throughout the country that can be accessed within Italy and Europe. Pisa is useful for trips to Tuscany and the Cinque Terre and you will need to fly into both Sicily and Sardinia.\n\nTo source the best flight deals to Italy we use a combination of Skyscanner, CheapoAir and Google flights.\n\nSkyscanner – portal where you can view cheapest days and routes to fly and set alerts for price drops\n\nCheapoAir – uncovers the best deals on first and business class flights around the world\n\nGoogle flights – great for checking schedules and airline routes\n\nSecure the best deals by setting up alerts on Skyscanner for the month you wish to travel and wait for price drops. It’s good to have a price that you wish to pay in mind but be prepared to be flexible on dates and stopovers. It is often cheaper to fly into Milan rather than Rome and that city is a useful entry point for northern Italy itineraries.\n\nInbound rail from within Europe\n\nMajor Italian cities – Milan, Rome, Florence and Venice – have fantastic fast speed train links from other capitals and major cities in Europe. The website Seat 61 is a great resource for planning train travel within Europe.\n\nBus travel to Italy\n\nIf you’re on a tight budget and traveling within Europe, then you might want to consider coming to Italy by bus. Low cost operator Flixbus covers 3,000 destinations in 39 countries.\n\nYou can compare schedules and prices using Omio – a useful site for booking a combination of train, bus and air travel within Europe.\n\nOrganize travel insurance\n\nOnce you have booked your flights or tour, we recommend organizing travel insurance straight away. The main reason you should purchase insurance is to cover health costs and emergency repatriation to your home country should you fall ill. Since 2020 you need to check whether there is cover provided for issues relating to covid19 however general health cover is recommended regardless.\n\nCover for cancelation, delays and loss of belongings is a bonus and again they may not apply under pandemic conditions. You need to read all the terms and conditions of your cover including any exclusions before you commit to buy.\n\nPolicy costs vary by your country of residence, what is covered, age, existing conditions and the insurer. You can visit Worldnomads for a quick quote. We use this company for our family travels and find the cost, coverage and claims process to be good to excellent.\n\nAnother option if you are in the United States is Safety Wing’s Nomad Insurance. Unfortunately neither option provides policies for those aged over 69. In this case you can try Travel Insurance Master – a service that allows you to compare quotes and insurance policies.\n\nStep 5 – Book accommodation and transport\n\nAccommodation\n\nChoosing where to stay at each stop is an important part of itinerary planning. Italy has many different options for tourists and you can expect the usual range of hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation as well as apartments and villas.\n\nIf you plan to spend any time in the country, consider staying at an agriturismo or farm stay. This is accommodation offered by Italian farmers who earn additional income by providing rooms and meals. Very popular in Italy and Europe, prices ranges from budget to luxurious. You can find agriturismi (plural) with swimming pools, hammams, restaurants and wine cellars. We always try to build them into our itinerary.\n\nHow much will accommodation cost?\n\nHere is a rough guide to average prices for a double room. This will vary with prices higher in popular areas at peak times\n\nUpscale / Luxury – €210+ [USD $240+] per night\n\nMidrange / Boutique – €120-260 [USD $135-295] per night\n\nBudget / B&B – €70-130 [USD $80-150] per night\n\nUltra budget / Hostel or shared room in AirBnB – €30-45 [USD $30-40] per night\n\nBest accommodation sites\n\nOur favorite sites for booking lodging are Booking.com and Plum Guide – between them, you’ll find a huge range of options from hotels and resorts to bed and breakfast, apartments and farm stay accommodation.\n\nPlum Guide is particularly useful for longer stays in apartments and villas and if you’re traveling as a family and need some extra space. Use the code “Untold5” for a 5% discount here.\n\nOther sites we use and recommend\n\nBookingsForYou – beautiful villas and apartments in Tuscany, Italian Lakes and Puglia – 5% for readers when you mention our site or code – UntoldItaly – when booking\n\nVRBO – has some great options for long stay villas and apartments, particularly on the Amalfi Coast\n\nAgriturismo.it – great for finding smaller farm stays but the booking engine is terrible. You can usually find the same properties on Booking.com\n\nAirbnb – we have used Airbnb on many occasions in Italy but are now finding better value and booking conditions on Booking.com and VRBO\n\nFurther reading:\n\nWhere to stay in Rome – a district by district guide to the best areas to stay\n\nBest places to stay in Florence – neighborhoods and areas best suited to your trip\n\nWhere to stay in Venice – a neighborhood and area guide\n\nWhere to stay in Milan – best areas, places and hotels\n\nExpert Assistance\n\nNeed some help planning your trip?\n\nBook in for a trip consultation with our expert Italy travel planners ready to help you build your dream vacation in Italy whether that be a classic first timer trip or an off the beaten path adventure\n\nmore information\n\nTransport while in Italy\n\nAs a general rule, if you are traveling between cities and major towns then the best way to travel around Italy is by train. If you want to explore the countryside and small villages you will need to rent a car.\n\nWhen you are mapping out distances to travel between destinations use Google maps or Rome2Rio.\n\nTrain travel in Italy\n\nTrains in Italy are modern and efficient. Fast speed services link the major cities and regional trains connect smaller towns and villages. Two major train networks operate throughout Italy – Italo and Trenitalia.\n\nYou should book in advance for high speed intercity services where seats are allocated. If you purchase non-flexible tickets you can make significant savings with advance bookings. They are not required on regional services.\n\nHigh speed train intercity travel times on popular routes\n\nRome to Florence – 1 hour 30 minutes\n\nRome to Naples – 1 hour 15 minutes\n\nRome to Milan – 3 hours\n\nRome to Venice – 4 hours\n\nFlorence to Venice – 2 hours\n\nFlorence to Milan – 2 hours\n\nCar rental in Italy\n\nOne of the best ways to see the smaller towns and countryside in Italy is to rent a car and take to the open road. Driving in Italy is quite straightforward. You just need to do some forward planning and use your common sense. Here are some tips to\n\nYou are required to carry an International Drivers Permit – these can be arranged in your home country at minimal cost\n\nStandard transmission on cars is manual or stick shift. If you want to rent an automatic car expect to pay extra, if you can find one available\n\nRent the smallest car you can to fit you and your luggage – roads are often narrow and you don’t want to get stuck!\n\nHeavy fines apply if you enter ZTL zones or historic districts where driving is not allowed\n\nWe use both Car Rental by booking.com and AutoEurope to find the best car rental deals in Italy including one way options. They both search international and local providers so you get a wide variety of choice and there is 24/7 support if you need it. AutoEurope is usually your best option if you want a one way rental.\n\nInternal flights\n\nIf you want to visit the islands of Sicily or Sardinia, or travel very long distances, flying makes the most sense.\n\nCheck on Skyscanner or Google flights for routes and prices. Remember to set alerts for those routes you want to fly and book early for flights in the summer months.\n\nStep 6 – Book Attractions, tours and activities\n\nMajor attractions\n\nThe major cities of Italy – Rome, Florence, Venice and Milan – are some of the busiest cities for tourists in the world. And most visitors want to spend time at their famous attractions\n\nWe strongly advise you to prebook advance skip-the-line tickets for the following attractions – the Colosseum, Vatican Museums, Uffizi Gallery and Doge’s Palace. Otherwise, you could spend precious vacation hours standing in lines to enter these sites. Note – in winter months booking in advance is not as necessary.\n\nWe have given you the official booking sites and an alternative for approved ticket partners should you have trouble using the official site – unfortunately, that happens a lot! The direct sites are usually cheaper but the partner sites are generally more user friendly. Always check the terms and conditions of your purchase, particularly in relation to changes and refunds. GetYourGuide has a very easy cancelation policy which in many cases allows cancelation with refunds up to 24 hours prior to departure.\n\nDay tours\n\nIf you want to learn about the sites you are visiting then we recommend a group day tour. We prefer small group or private tours where you learn about the culture and history of the places you are visiting. It’s so much more fun than reading plaques and you are also able to ask questions.\n\nSo make sure to build in a couple of tours when you are planning a trip to Italy.\n\nOur favorite small group tour companies are Take Walks (formerly Walks of Italy) and LivTours and we prefer With Locals for private tours. Both offer very well designed and engaging tours of the major sights in Italy as well as interesting food and cultural tours.\n\nTake Walks have a longstanding reputation for excellent service, groups under 20 people and guaranteed departures. So if you are the only person booked on a tour it will still go ahead. We recently enjoyed our Colosseum at night tour and day trip to Tuscany with them\n\nLivTours – family run Italian company offering true small group tours of 6 people or less. All of their tours use expert guides who will help you fall in love with Italian history, culture, and food. Tours include a popular golf cart tour of Rome’s highlights and their fascinating Women’s history tours\n\nWith Locals offer great value private tours. You choose from a series of set itineraries and guides in cities across Italy. There are tours focused on history, food, culture and other themes or they can be customized them for your group. We tried their 10 Tastes of Naples recently and it was lots of fun. They also have great options for families\n\nEating Europe – food tour specialists who will ensure you discover the best local dishes\n\nFurther reading:\n\nRome: A 3 Day Itinerary\n\nThe best tours in Rome\n\nUnmissable day trips from Florence\n\nDay trip from Rome to Pompeii\n\nBest tours of the Vatican\n\nTickets and tours for the Colosseum\n\nRome’s best food tours\n\nActivities and experiences\n\nSeeing the sights of Italy is always a treat but you’ll also love immersing yourself in Italian culture. These days you can choose from a wide range of experiences and activities. From food and wine tours, to football matches, concerts and exploring the countryside by vintage car, there are memorable experiences to suit you.\n\nRecommended experiences\n\nCooking class with Nonna Nerina near Rome – Grandma Nerina teaches you how to make fresh pasta and welcomes you into her home. If you can’t wait until you get to Italy to do this she also does online classes\n\nCapri boat trip – small group on a private boat means a slower pace and more time to see the island. You can read what to expect on this day trip here\n\nOur favorite companies for searching for interesting and unique things to do in Italy are:\n\nCookly – cooking class and food and wine experiences like truffle hunting from small operators across Italy\n\nGet Your Guide – has the biggest listing of tours and experiences\n\nStep 7 – Get ready for departure\n\nOrganize your money and credit card\n\nThe local currency in Italy is the € Euro.\n\nYou do not need to carry too much cash when you are there. Credit and debit cards VISA and Mastercard are widely accepted while American Express and Diners Club are not as popular. You may want to consider a foreign currency card like the Wise Mastercard where you can convert Euros easily and cheaply from your US dollar, Australian dollar or Canadian dollar accounts (plus many other currencies)\n\nBe aware of foreign currency charges and ATM withdrawal fees applied to your account when you are abroad. You may want to review the cards you are taking with you prior to your trip. We recommend that you take two – one as a back up for emergencies. And inform your bank before you go. Sometimes they can be overzealous and place a block on your card if they see unusual activity.\n\nBook airport transfers\n\nPlanning your arrival in Italy is recommended. Most of the airports are a fair way out from the city center – and in the case of Venice, in the middle of a lagoon!\n\nCompare different transfer services on Suntransfers – a company that specializes in transfer options from major airports. They have options to suit all budgets and prices for coach, mini bus, private car and limo services.\n\nRome – transfers from Fiumicino airport\n\nTaxis are fine to take in Rome. There is a set rate into the center of €48 and the ride takes around 45 minutes. Or, if you would prefer to be met at the airport you can pre-book a transfer. A transfer is the best option if you are traveling with more than 2 people and have several items of luggage. We recommend:\n\nWelcome Pickups – available 24/7, a private car transfer means you are met at the arrivals hall and will take between 30 minutes and one hour door-to-door.\n\nSuntransfers – offers a wide range of vehicles for groups of all sizes. Transfers can be canceled up to 48 hours in advance with no penalty.\n\nAnother popular way to transfer into Rome is to take the Leonardo Express train. This non-stop service between Fiumicino and Rome Termini (the main station) takes 32 minutes. Trains depart every half hour from 6:08 to 23:23, and the cost is €14. You can purchase tickets at the station on the day. Unless you are staying close to Termini you will then need to get a taxi to your accommodation.\n\nThe cheapest transfer option – this bus goes direct from the airport to Termini – €6-7 one way.\n\nVenice transfers\n\nThe water bus company Alilaguna runs shuttles every 15 -30 minutes in peak season to and from the airport and the islands on the lagoon. This bus stops at San Marco and Rialto as well as some other secondary stops. The fare is €8 one way €15 return and the journey takes 1½ hours – you can book online here\n\nA private boat transfer or shared transfer in a water taxi is the fastest (and most glamorous) way to transfer to your accommodation in Venice. Journey times and prices depend on the number of people in your party and exclusivity. A direct private transfer to the airport takes around 45 minutes.\n\nPrivate transfer – around €200 for 6 people – book here\n\nShared water taxi transfer – around €32 per person – book here\n\nYou can also take a taxi (cost €25) or express airport bus to Piazzale Roma (cost €8) and then take a vaporetto (water bus) or walk your hotel/accommodation. A one way trip on the ferry costs €7 per person and is valid for 60 minutes.\n\nFlorence transfers from Florence airport\n\nFlorence airport is very close to the city center and a 15 minute taxi ride away. There is also an airport bus that takes around 20 minutes. A 20 minute tram ride takes you to the main Santa Maria Novella train station and costs €1.50.\n\nFlorence transfers from Pisa airport\n\nMany people fly to Pisa to reach Florence as it is a larger airport. If you arrive during the day take the PisaMover train to Pisa Centrale train station – journey time 5 minutes. Then take a train to Florence. Starts at 6.00 am and the last train departs at midnight and it costs €5.00.\n\nOn our last visit we arranged a transfer with Suntransfers as we arrived too late for the last train. There is also a coach transfer option.\n\nAmalfi Coast or Sorrento transfers from Naples airport or train station\n\nWe recommend organizing a private transfer for this journey. The train, ferry and bus via Sorrento can take 4 hours while a car service is around 1.5 hours. You can compare different services on Suntransfers – a site specializing in ground transportation.\n\nYou may find sites or groups where specific drivers are recommended. We do not recommend booking a driver this way for safety reasons – how do you know that the person recommending the driver is reputable, let alone the driver? And also for practical reasons – small operators may not have capacity or availability.\n\nPlan how to access the internet\n\nConsider how you will access the internet on your trip. You may be happy to disconnect and use paper or offline maps however many of us need internet access.\n\nItaly has high speed internet and there are many options to stay connected depending on your needs. If you use minimal data and are happy to use offline maps and guides then you should be able to get by using wifi at your hotel or accommodation. Do not expect wifi to be available in restaurants and cafes because in Italy restaurants are for eating.\n\nIf you plan to use wifi make sure to turn off international data roaming before your trip to avoid unpleasant bill surprises.\n\nPaid internet options\n\nUse your provider’s roaming plan – usually very expensive and slow speeds if coming from outside Europe\n\nLocal SIM – purchase a tourist SIM before your depart or when you arrive that has enough data for map navigation and research. Italian provider TIM comes highly recommended and there are outlets at the airports and train stations\n\nPortable wifi device – connect multiple devices to high speed internet for reasonable prices. We use and recommend Solis Wifi (Get 10% off with our code – UNTOLDM)\n\nExpert Assistance\n\nNeed some help planning your trip?\n\nBook in for a trip consultation with our expert Italy travel planners ready to help you build your dream vacation in Italy whether that be a classic first timer trip or an off the beaten path adventure\n\nmore information\n\nPacking for your Italy trip\n\nThe key to packing for Italy is to pack the minimum that you need. Many people like to take carry-on luggage only for their trips. This is a great way to travel as you will find it much easier managing trains, cobblestones and stairs that are a feature of travel in Italy.\n\nBut, most of us find that a challenge, so try to stick to a medium bag per person plus one carry on item. Large suitcases are not a good idea. You will also thank yourself if you consider your footwear carefully. Three comfortable pairs will see you through most trips.\n\nNote – We have a complete packing guide coming soon.\n\nMust have items for your trip\n\nLuggage – get the size right with our guide to the best luggage for Italy\n\nUntold Italy travel planners – one page checklists of the must see sights, restaurants and gelato bars in Italy’s most popular places\n\nCollapsible water bottle – stay hydrated and fill up at free water fountains all over Italy\n\nCamera – for your vacation snaps. We recommend lightweight mirrorless models like these ones\n\nPacking cubes – these make packing, organizing your luggage and unpacking so easy. We love them!\n\nPower cube – don’t bring lots of bulky converters. This one has 3 USB ports\n\nBattery pack – keep all your devices charged\n\nPlug adapter – you will need one!\n\nFace masks – for your safety and you may be required to wear one indoors\n\nHand sanitizer wipes – to keep germs at bay\n\nGet started and plan your Italy trip now!\n\nWe hope you now have more confidence to start planning your trip to Italy.
