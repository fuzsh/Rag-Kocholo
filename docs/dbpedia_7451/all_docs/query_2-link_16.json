        "text": "3 days in Taxco, Guerrero was like a magical fairytale. I can honestly say it was the most mesmerizing and the most beautiful place in Mexico that I’ve visited. From taking the cable car, to riding in a sturdy VW Beetle, to the Cristo Monument, to getting lost in the cobblestone streets, eating churros and learning about Taxco’s past as a silver mining town – I fell totally in love with this city which is 3 hours south of Mexico City.\n\nTaxco will surprise you. Taxco will take your breath away. Welcome to the the most Magical Pueblo Mágico of all of the Pueblo Mágicos- Taxco, Guerrero! Located just a couple of hours from Mexico City, Taxco is built upon a beautiful mountainside. It truly looks like something out of a dream! When you are walking the streets of Taxco you feel like you have stepped back in time! White with red tiled roof buildings, the streets are cobblestone, and the taxis look like VW Bugs from the 1950’s. There are surprises awaiting you around every corner and callejon!\n\nIn the early morning with the rising sun, the apricot-peach colored stone of the church of Santa Prisca and San Sebastián in Taxco, Guerrero, Mexico, seems to radiate with light. On a hill towering above the city around it, the church’s tall bell towers beckon people to enter its doors. The elaborate carvings on the façade and towers also seem to writhe with life. As shadows pass over the surface throughout the day, you could swear the building was moving. Imagine how striking it is to then enter the church and be completely overwhelmed with walls that vibrate with gold.\n\nThis is a Pueblo Mágico (Magic Town) we’ve wanted to visit for a long time and it didn’t disappoint. The Saturday silver market (Taxco is a former mining town known for its silver) – Sampling some of the local cuisine, like mezcal from Guerrero and Pozole Verde at Rosa Mexicano – Getting lost in the streets of Taxco which are like a drunken spider web.\n\nEnjoying the spectacular views of the city from various lookout points—the whitewashed buildings, red tile roofs, and mountains were so beautiful! – Taking a few cab rides in the typical VW taxis – Looking at the colorful and hand-crafted artesanías (handicrafts) like painted hats, VW bug piggie banks, and mugs – Enjoying some drinks on 2nd story balconies with views of Santa Prisca church – Staying at a historic rental with a 250-year old tree and great views\n\nTaxco was an important 18th-century silver-mining location and prior to colonization was a Nahua town. When miners found silver in 1716, the city of Taxco experienced a boom. One miner, José de la Borda, amassed an incredible fortune, and he commissioned new artistic projects, among them the Santa Prisca church. Spanish conquistador, Hernán Cortés, established the modern city of Taxco in the 1520s specifically because of it’s rich resources of silver.\n\nThe top question I got asked on social media: “Is this part of Mexico safe?”.\n\nWhile we never felt unsafe in Taxco, we did notice an police and military presence in the city. We encourage you to check for up to date travel information on your home country’s state department website and make your own informed decisions before travelling to Taxco and Guerrero Sate.\n\nThe local people were very friendly and warm. Taxco is very popular with tourists. What people fail to mention is that these crimes are mainly gang-related and not targeted at tourists and visitors. Plus it happens in certain neighborhoods, that you probably won’t be visiting. We felt absolutely safe in TAXCO. Avoid wearing flashy jewelry or shiny accessories; steer clear of dark, solitary places; keep an eye on your wallet (especially in very crowded, touristy places); keep valuables in your hotel safe; and carry one credit card, your ID and only cash you need for the day’s expenses with you while out and about.\n\nWhen to Visit:\n\nIn Taxco, the summers are long, hot, and overcast; the winters are short, warm, and mostly clear; and it is oppressive and wet year round. Over the course of the year, the temperature typically varies from 68°F to 93°F and is rarely below 63°F or above 98°F. Temperatures are pleasant all year round! The rainiest months are: June- September and August.\n\nWe recommend the month of January through April, Oct/Nov december, to visit Taxco. We felt Jan is the right time to come to Taxco , not too crowded, because the town otherwise would feel claustrophobic. The tourists have left, you’ll get reservations at restaurants easily and shops will not be crowded. We couldn’t have picked the right time to visit Taxco. We reached there Jan 3rd, the Christmas lights were still on and the tourists had left. It was perfect!\n\nHow to get to Taxco:\n\nWe flew AeroMexico direct from San Francisco (SFO) to Mexico City International Airport (MEX). It was a nonstop 4 hour and 30 minute flight, making it a fairly quick trip! We took a taxi to Taxco which is about 3 hour drive. You can also book a bus which is 10% of the price of a cab.\n\nBus – US$17–23 BOOK ONLINE HERE — Rome to Rio\n\nTaxi – US$55–70 BOOK ONLINE HERE – Rome2Rio\n\nIf you reserve the taxi through your hotel in Mexico city, you will be overcharged. So make sure to book on your own. Both options are good. We went there by a taxi and came back in a bus. Both comfortable and convenient.\n\nRead 5 days in MEXICO CITY to get an idea. You can go around MDCX and travel to Taxco. Both are simply gorgeous.\n\nHow many days to stay?\n\nThree days is more than enough. But, if you want to really soak in the culture, relax, a week will not be enough.\n\nGetting Around:\n\nWhen you arrive at Taxco, you are welcomed by a very busy main road that cuts the hilly town into two parts. You will see many taxis stopping to ask where you want to go, that’s pretty much the direction to get to your hotel. It will be about 5-10 if you are staying around the main center and will cost you 25 pesos( just more than a dollar). Do not make the mistake of driving from Mexico city to Taxco for convenience. It is a pain to drive in those small hilly cobblestone roads. Beautiful VW Beetles and Taxis are easily available. Uber doesn’t work here. You really don’t need taxis often too, this is a walkable town. The price to go to the CHRISTO will be about 100 pesos.\n\nLanguage:\n\nOne of the most challenging part was the language. We were glad that my son spoke fluent Spanish. Spanish is the official language of Taxco. Not a lot of people speak spanish, even at hotels. So Google translate (remember to download the language for offline use) comes to the rescue. We found it to be really efficient for communicating in a pinch! Learn a few words and you’ll be good to go.\n\nCurrency:\n\nMexican Peso. Though some restaurants and tourist establishments accept credit cards, there are quite a few places that are cash-only. I highly recommend converting some currency into pesos. When we were there, we saw one ATM which was crowded, so make sure to get pesos from Mexico City.\n\nElectric Plugs / Voltage:\n\nVoltage in Mexico is 110V at 60Hz. Plugs are Type B, with flat pins (same as the ones used in the US, so no need for a voltage converter or adapter if you’re traveling from the US).\n\nWeather:\n\nThe weather around January was very warm, and it was winter, Southern Hemisphere. In Taxco, the summers are long, hot, and overcast; the winters are short, warm, and mostly clear; and it is oppressive and wet year round. Over the course of the year, the temperature typically varies from 68°F to 93°F and is rarely below 63°F or above 98°F.\n\nWhere to Stay in Taxco:\n\nI would highly recommend staying around the city center. You will find an abundance of beautiful colonial style properties around this quaint town. Many of these were homes that are converted into Hotels while maintaining the natural aesthetic. I stayed in Hotel Los Arcos which I was thrilled about.\n\nHotel Los Arcos – $$\n\nThe most beautiful property in whole of Taxco. This is a 5 minute walk from the town center/Zoccolo. The interiors are gorgeous with beautiful furniture, all the amenities. Los Arcos is conveniently located near the Taxco main square which is one of its best assets, although it is also a clean, well-run place with a restaurant and lobby area to lounge around. Keys are left at the front desk upon leaving for shopping or doing other things in the area and can be picked up when one returns. There is no air conditioning in the rooms but it is not necessarily needed in light of the altitude where the city sits, but could be desired by some, especially during particularly warmer nights. Restaurants, silver stores, and other businesses and small museums are near the zocalo where free public music is often played free to the public. A good location for those not wanting to take a break far away from the city center.\n\nFew caveats is there’s no elevator, so you have to carry your luggage up the stairs. The bathrooms are not the best. It’s also situated in the main area, so you might hear noise from the street at night. Having said that, I would stay here everytime I visit.\n\nHotel William $$\n\nThis is fairly a new hotel. THis is right opposite Los Arcos and we got the opportunity to visit and checkout the rooms and the hotel. This is a very cute quaint hotel. Very clean, comfy beds, staff is great, location is great! bathroom very small, shower good size. Although by 10pm it was quite. The Hotel is 3 stories no elevator. A con is this hotel is open very late at night and it can get noisy. But, an option.\n\nDe Cantera y Plata- $$$\n\nTo reach this property, you’ll have to take a taxi up. It is not walkable distance to the city center which is the most happening. That said this is the most beautiful property to stay in Taxco. With great views, you can enjoy Taxco’s beautiful landscape! Rooms are very well equipped and nice. Service level is very good, particularly the restaurant team. Food is also very good. Ask for the delicious chilaquiles with cecina!\n\nHotel Montetaxco – $$\n\nAnother beautiful, older property to stay in Taxco. Similar to the last one, this is not close to the center. But, if you are looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city center, relax, swim, drink overlooking the most stunning views, this is the place for you.\n\nAir BnB’s\n\nSpratling House: Three Windows\n\nWe had the honor to meet the owner, and Violante’s place is excellent. Very laid back and quaintly Mexican. Cafecito’s, the small restaurant attached had excellent food. Bed is very comfortable, outside kitchen and dining table worked well. Water was supplied. Shower is only warm. Be aware though, if you stay in Taxco, the steep hills through out the town will get you in shape. Although it is not even a kilometre from the bus depot to Casa Spratling, it is all up steep cobblestone. A taxi might be a good option. But you still have to climb a steep road.\n\nRooftop House\n\nThis rooftop terrace is really great. It’s very spacious and has great views of the Parroquia and the Cristo. The spiral staircase to access the terrace was tall and narrow but after going up once or twice, it became easy. The beds are comfortable and the bathroom has what is needed. The apartment seems to be quite noisy, even at night, because of the location between two busy streets. However, we noticed that nearly all of downtown Taxco is like this due to the old, narrow streets and loud cars (mostly old Volkswagen Beatles)\n\nThings to do and see in Taxco:\n\nWalk around Taxco – The best way to see the city and to get to know the locals, is by walking. This city is a walkable one. You will cross street vendors, vegetable markets, silver stores and much much more. Taxco is made of viable winding roads and the so-called “callejones” which are small lanes made of stairs, for most of the time where cars cannot circulate. Be careful.. try to avoid isolated dark narrow lanes that are too far away from the Zoccolo.\n\n2. Zoccolo- A big and stylish TAXCO sign is placed in the middle of the plaza beside a kiosk and iron benches are there for you to relax from all the walking you have done. The Zocalo square is a small, tree-lined plaza that forms the beating heart of Taxco. This central square is a fantastic place to soak up the unhurried lifestyle of this Mexican city, and people-watch from one of the many side cafés and coffee shops.\n\nThe city’s steep cobblestone streets and ‘callejones’ (stairways) all lead off from this plaza, so it’s a great place to orient yourself on a walking tour of Taxco. The most famous landmark in the Zocalo is the famous Santa Prisca Church and the authentic pottery and silverware stalls just behind it.\n\nHang out in the Zocalo square with a churro in hand or watch one of the pop-up folk dance and musical performances often held here in the evenings. It’s a hive of activity!\n\n3. Christ the Redeemer Statue – Towering above the city on the Cerro del Atache hill, the Christ the Redeemer Statue is one of Taxco’s main tourist attractions. Built in 2002 over eight months, it offers some of the best bird’s eye views of the city from the El Cristo Panoramico (the Christ View Point).\n\nSimilar to Brazil’s Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro but on a much smaller scale, this national monument watches over the city with open arms. The best time to climb the hill to see the view and the statue is just before the sun sets, so plan accordingly. You can get a taxi to go to the Christ for about 100 pesos.\n\n4. Museo de la Plateria – The Museo de la Plateria (the Silverware Museum) is a silver factory that’s dedicated to showcasing Taxco’s impressive silver and interpreting the mysteries of the industry.Located in the center of Taxco, the exhibits feature a rather impressive silverware collection, including silver that once belonged to Don Antonio Pineda himself – a well-known Mexican modernist and silversmith.Visitors can explore the museum’s many exhibits and take a tour of the silver mine and factory to learn how the silver is made. You’ll be able to see how it goes from being mined to fine-crafted into remarkable pieces of jewelry.\n\nOpening hours\n\nFrom Tuesday through Sunday from 10:00 am to 6 pm (Monday Closed)\n\nEntrance fee\n\n$20.00 Pesos (1USD)\n\nAddress\n\nCalle Juan Ruiz de Alarcón 12 (761) 622 5501\n\n5. Silver shopping- Taxco was once a booming silver mining town. It is the renowned for its silver. In fact, it’s been dubbed Mexico’s silver capital, despite the fact that its resources are now dwindling. Visitors travel from far and wide to shop the high-quality sterling silver jewelry and trinkets for sale here.\n\nMost of the silver workshops in Taxco are reputable, offering everything from handcrafted individual pieces to mass-produced souvenirs for tourists. The items are priced by weight, depending on the quality of the silver.\n\nMake sure that you’re paying for the real deal by checking that the silver is marked with a .925 stamp, which proves that it’s indeed Sterling Silver, made up of 92.5% silver and 7.5% copper for strength. If you’re lucky, you may find something with a .950 stamp, which means it contains 95% silver, but these items are rare and will cost more.\n\nVisit the Museo de la Plateria (the Silver Museum), where you can watch the silversmiths go about their expert ancient craft. The Tianguis de la Plata (Silver Street Market) is worth a visit for affordable silverware and trinkets, and if you’re looking for something special, head to the Spratling workshop in Taxco Viejo.\n\n6. Teleferico de Taxco- The Teleferico de Taxco (the Taxco Cableway) is a mountain cable car in Mexico, and one of the best things to do when you’re visiting Taxco. The ride on this scenic Swiss-built gondola takes you to and from Hotel Montetaxco at the top of the mountain and Taxco town in about ten minutes (one way).\n\nWhether you’re staying at the hotel or not, this cable car is well worth the trip. It offers some of the best views of the city of Taxco from above, and its lush surrounding mountains.\n\nStop for an afternoon drink on the hotel terrace – the menu is more affordable than most places in Taxco’s Zocalo square – but make sure you head down before 7 p.m. as the cable car stops running in the early evenings during the week.\n\n7. Museo Guillermo Spratling- The Museo Guillermo Spratling, also known as the William Spratling Museum, is a historical and anthropological museum that features an extraordinary collection of pre-Hispanic jewelry, artwork, pottery, silverware, and handcrafted sculptures spread across three floors.\n\nVisitors can explore over 200 archaeological artifacts from Mesoamerica that formed part of famous silversmith William Spratling’s personal collection. Browse the exhibits showcasing everything from fractured bones to semi-precious stones. The highlight is the skull adorned in jade green mosaics.\n\nOther interesting exhibits include a collection of counterfeit articles and a range of silverwork designs Spratling himself created in Taxco and Taxco el Viejo.\n\n8. Templo de Santa Prisca- The Templo de Santa Prisca, also known as the Santa Prisca Church, is one of the most beautiful churches in Mexico. Located on the eastern edge of the Zocalo, Taxco’s main square, this rose-colored Baroque cathedral towers above the city.\n\nThe cathedral’s architecture is especially impressive and a bit unusual – it’s a mix of Spanish colonial Baroque architecture known as ‘Churrigueresque.’ It was built between 1751 and 1758 by Jose de la Borda – a wealthy silver mining mogul – in the same location as a working silver mine. At the time it was built, the Templo de Santa Prisca was the tallest building in Mexico.\n\nHighlights include the Churrigueresque twin towers, a chapel decorated with Spanish Talavera tiles, the colorful cupola, and the depiction of the Assumption of Mary on the cathedral portal. Don’t miss the nine floor-to-ceiling altarpieces decorated with gold, particularly the main one that honors the town’s patron saints, San Sebastian and Santa Prisca, as well as the famous paintings by Mestizo painter, Miguel Cabrera.\n\n9. Casa Borda- If you’re interested in arts and culture, don’t miss the Casa Borda, an authentic cultural center in Taxco. Built in 1759 overlooking the Borda Square and the gorgeous Santa Prisca Temple, this 18th-century colonial building features 14 exhibition rooms spread across four floors. You can spend hours exploring the paintings, contemporary sculptures, and historic photographs if you choose to.\n\nImpressive architecture and artifacts aside, the center is also used as a venue for experimental theater performances, musical shows, book presentations, and various competitions, such as the National Silver Contest and the International Guitar Competition and Festival.\n\n10. Silver Workshop – Visit the silver workshops located along Calle San Agustín, you will find more than 20 silverware with fine jewelry and fine jewelry such as necklaces, earrings, bracelets, rings, crucifixes and objects with ancient prehispanic motifs. The most famous workshops are those of Daniel Espinosa, Guillermo Arregui and Emilia Castillo. In addition to the silversmiths, there are stalls around the center where you can also buy some jewelry.\n\n11. Vist Waterfalls POZAS AZULES – The blue spring waterfalls are definitely something you’ll enjoy. If you have some time, you must go there. You have to walk down to the main road close to the bus station but further down (Acapulco direction) in front of a big shop called Coppel.\n\nRight there on that side of the road, you will find the small busses (minivan or combi or peceras) to Pozas Azules leaving every half an hour. If you go much earlier, around 8.30 you will find fewer people.\n\nThe bus will take you right in front of the entrance of the waterfalls. At the same point, you will find another bus to go back still every half an hour the last one is at 7 pm.\n\nPlaces to Eat in Taxco:\n\n1. Casa Spratling – S caffecito – Everything was delicious, the dishes were all made by hand and in the moment.\n\nThey make everything there, like the pasta.\n\nThe place is cozy and very pretty too.\n\n2.

Warm and amazing.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\n3 DAYS IN TAXCO CITY ITINERARY\n\nDay 1\n\nStart your morning by walking to the zoccolo and take your pictures before you are hit by traffic and locals getting to work.
