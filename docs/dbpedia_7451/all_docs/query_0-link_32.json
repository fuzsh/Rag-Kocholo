It (a) told me that there are only two buses to choose from, 6:15 am and late afternoon (I think it was around 4:00 pm and (b) told me that tickets could not be purchased in advance, only from the bus driver. As I discovered when I followed the link to the Monbus web site, neither of these was fully accurate.\n\nI went to the website because neither of the times listed really were ideal for me. Getting up to catch a 6:15 bus would have me up a little earlier than I wanted and a late afternoon bus would give me not enough time in Santiago. On the Monbus website I was able to find an 11:45 bus (arrives in Santiago at 13:00) and to buy a ticket for it in advance.\n\nSo if you can't find what you want on Rome2Rio, dig a little deeper.\n\n[Thread title courtesy of Forum software]\n\nJust to post a quick note that while Rome2Rio (often recommended on these forums) is a great site, it isn't always complete or accurate in its listing.\n\nI went today to look up bus options from Muxía back to Santiago de Compostela on Wednesday.

It can take a bit of sleuthing. In the old days you just went to.the station and got a ticket or bought one from the driver after checking at the bar for times and locations of the bus stops. That can still work, but we did see people who didn't have advance tickets denied access to the bus at Muxia this summer at certain times because it was full!.\n\nYes - Rome2rio is a great starting place to find options.\n\nAnother option to point out -\n\nI also have downloaded the app ( Omio ) for when I’m in Europe . I’ve used it for trains and buses in spain. Purchased the tickets online via the app.\n\nWhen you think about it you only need maybe 15 or so apps to 'plan a camino', from a logistics standpoint , with maybe a slight variance depending on where you reside, such as....\n\nTravel options - Rome2rio, Google Maps\n\nFlights - Google, Kayak, Skyscanner to search then direct book with airline(s)\n\nSurface transport - consolidator - thetrainline, Omio\n\nSurface transport - specific companies - Renfe, Alsa, Flixbus,\n\nHotac - booking.com (acknowledging many like to go direct)\n\nFinance - even as a European I know Charles Schwab is the way to go (for USA residents) / easy for European residents with many options\n\nNot exhaustive but just a thought!"
