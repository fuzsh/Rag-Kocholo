        "text": "Type of Girl about the Globe (GatG) – Adventurous GatG, Cultural GatG, Wine GatG\n\nMoldova in Europe is definitely for the cultural or adventurous solo that's why I've given it 3 out of 5 stars. Travelling to Moldova is safe but if you decide to go completely solo, you’ll need a few phrases of Romanian to get by.\n\nIt’s not uncommon to see gypsies begging outside of monasteries but as hard as it may seem, resist giving them any money. When entering Orthodox churches women have to have their heads covered so wear a hood or take a scarf with you.\n\nIs Moldova safe? Yes. There is a police presence in Moldova and you can get fined for jaywalking or stopped and asked to show your passport. Taxi drivers can be a challenge so be prepared to navigate and don't expect them to be able to find the address. If you can’t speak the language and prefer your trip to be more comfortable I definitely recommend taking a tour around the country for ease.\n\nBelow is our Moldova travel guide, including where to go in Moldova, where to stay, which tour company to use and how to get around. Find out how to get from the airport and things to do in Moldova.\n\nAll companies included have been recommended by solo female travellers and come with our Solo Female Friendly endorsement. Just choose the relevant section or read the full article. Traveling to Moldova is possible if you are solo but if you prefer company for your Moldova trip, it's worth looking into a group tour.\n\n* Before you travel, check what paperwork or visas are required for Moldova.\n\nN.b.

Formerly part of the USSR, the country declared independence in 1991. Moldova has a charm about it, and a history of traditions making it perfect for the cultural traveller.\n\nChișinău\n\nLocated on the River Bîc, Chișinău is the country’s capital which was rebuilt in a Soviet style after it suffered an earthquake in 1940. As capital cities go, it may not be the prettiest but it does offer lots of history. One of the Chisinau sights is a war memorial (in Soviet style), and eternal flame which sit as reminders of the war between 1941 to 1945, as well as a Jewish cemetery and old synagogue.\n\nPlaces To Visit in Chisinau – For Chisinau sightseeing, walk around this Moldova city to see old Orthodox churches, the Triumphal arch, and Stefan Cel Mare Central Park before stopping for a coffee in Tucano Coffee, the country’s very own coffee shop brand, before delving into the country’s past to discover more at the National History Museum. The Chisinau Town Hall is worth a look with its Italian Gothic style architecture, or see the Nativity Cathedral, the main cathedral of the Moldovan Orthodox Church is all its white glory.\n\nFor a true Moldovan experience, meander around the Central Market, an open air market that is the biggest in the country. This is where you can mingle with the sellers and buy fresh produce from farmers that come here to sell from all around the country.\n\nOther things to do in Chisinau is shop. Chișinău is surprisingly good for shopping with a giant shopping centre called MallDova to lose yourself in (with a clever spin on the country’s name). But don’t expect prices to be low here as the shops are relatively expensive compared to the cost of the rest of the country.\n\nEven though Moldova is one of the poorest Eastern European countries, Moldova nightlife is surprising with bars, nightclubs and even karaoke bars. Famous Club, and Flamingo Night Club are two of the most popular clubs here. Flamingo is only open in the summer and has a large terrace to mingle with the other revellers. If going to a club solo isn’t for you, spend an evening at a restaurant in Moldova, sampling the local cuisine instead.\n\nNorth of the capital is the Holy Trinity Monastery of Saharna, one of the centres for religious pilgrimages in Moldova. The country has several other monasteries too.\n\nWineries in Moldova\n\nMostly known for its wine, you’ll find the country’s vineyards in the south of the country and its finest wineries near its capital. When you visit Chisinau, Cricova Winery is one of one of the places to go in Moldova if you love wine, and one of the popular Chisinau attractions. It is the largest underground wine city in the world, with each underground street named after a different wine.\n\nOriginally a limestone mine, Cricova has 60 years experience in producing some of the finest wines in Moldova and hold a marathon WINE Run every year in January. It is one of the reasons to visit Moldova and the place to go for wine tasting.\n\nThen there’s Milestii Mici, which holds the Guinness World Record as the largest wine cellar in the world. You’ll find nearly two million bottles within its wine cellar located 18km from Chișinău.\n\nOne of the country’s biggest charms is its traditions including its carpet weaving tradition. Just one hour from Chișinău is the Rustic Art Craft Centre where you can learn more about the processes and watch the ladies work their magic or even participate in a carpet weaving masterclass. They organise a festival in July dedicated to the traditional Moldovan costume called “IA MANIA.”\n\nOld Orhei\n\nJust outside of the capital (about 60kms) is one of the country’s most beautiful landscapes. Old Orhei (Orheiul Vechi) is one of the oldest cities in Moldova and one of the oldest settlements in Europe. It is considered an “open air museum.”\n\nThis quaint village is home to traditional Moldavian-style houses and feels like a step back in time. Because of its natural landscape this area is fast-becoming known for its opera with an open-air opera called DescOPERA held here on the 1st weekend of June. It’s also perfect for the outdoors or culinary solo with opportunities to hike, bike, camp and take part in cooking masterclasses.\n\nOne of the highlights of Old Orhei is the cave monastery, a Moldova tourist attraction. This monastery is 500 years old and the views from outside the small door are simply breathtaking. Step inside its cave walls with a candle to light your way and if you’re lucky you may even see the monk going about his monastery duties during your visit. Outside of Chișinău you will also find one of Moldova’s wooden churches dating back 200 years.\n\nNearby is Curchi Monastery, which is thought to be one of the beautiful. Founded in 1773, the monastery sits in the Vatic valley alongside the river. Curchi Monastery still has both of its monasteries – the small one for winter and the larger one for summer. Around one hundred monks Iive within the peaceful grounds.\n\nSoroca\n\nHead north to Soroca, the famous gypsy capital, to spot sight of the gypsy king. This is one of the Moldova cities that is home to the Moldovan Roma who have created their own gypsy kingdom high on a hilltop. If you’ve ever wanted to see replicas of the U.S. Capital Building or St Peter’s Basilica, they are all here, as homes for the gypsy community. It’s definitely a unique area to visit.\n\nSoroca also has a fortress, one of the landmarks in Moldova. The Soroca Fortress is also one of the historic sites and most historical places in Moldova. Although it is quite small in size, this fortress still has the wow factor. As one of the four fortresses along the Nistru River, this round fortress helped to protect the country’s borders. Visit the fortress in the summer for the outdoor market and to buy locally-made souvenirs.\n\nLocated on a hill on the outskirts of Soroca, the Candle of Gratitude (or the Thanksgiving Candle) is one of the most significant monuments in Moldova’s modern-day history. Climb the 600 or so steps to look inside the small chapel and admire the views of the river and countryside below.\n\nGagauzia\n\nThe south of Moldova is where you’ll find the vineyards and Gagauzia – an autonomous region of Moldova which declared its independence in 1991. Technically this is still part of Moldova and is home to the Gagauz people who descended from the Turks.\n\nThis is the poorest region in the country and where locals produce their own wine. If you do get as far south as this region, visit the Gagauz National Museum of History and Ethnography to learn more about its interesting past.\n\nMoldova's Nature\n\nTaul Park is Moldova’s largest park. Although it isn’t close to the capital you can take public transportation there if you’re up for the 200km distance. The park is known for its flora and paths and trails that you can lose yourself in.\n\nAnother beautiful place for nature in the country is the Padurea Domneasca Nature Reserve, one of the oldest forests that is spread over 6,000 hectares. The park has a big heron population and the oldest tree in Moldova. See red deer and bison and the “one Hundred mounds,” a field that some believe to be the burial site of soldiers. Or explore the caves and grottoes within the cliffs where the remains of an ancient culture was found. It is easier to do a tour to visit the reserve.\n\nTransnistria\n\nAnother area of Moldova which has proclaimed independence is Transnistria, a piece of land between the river Dniester and the eastern Moldovan border with Ukraine. Transnistria is an unrecognized country and describes itself as an open-air Soviet museum with its Soviet character fully intact.\n\nThere’s evidence of Russia everywhere from a giant bust of Lenin which sits outside a disused cultural centre in Kitscani to the soviet tank proudly on display at Main Parade Square. Interesting and incredibly unique, it’s definitely recommended to cross the ‘border’ and visit Transnistria for a day or two. The capital, Tiraspol is the second largest city in Moldova. When you're here, don’t forget to visit the Kyint Brandy Factory or the Noul Neamt Monastery where monks brew their own wine.\n\nMoldova is definitely an adventure. And as tourism in Moldova isn't yet for the masses, whenever you choose to visit, as they say in the country “You come as a guest and leave as a family member”.\n\nRead Transnistria – The Last Part of The USSR\n\nRead Places To Visit in Moldova\n\nAccommodation in Moldova\n\nBooking.com offers hotels and apartments and includes dorm rooms in hostels if you're travelling on a budget. Moldova does have hostels but don’t expect them to be the same standard as those in Western Europe but they do have heating and helpful staff.\n\nPlus there’s Airbnb Moldova, which connects you to unique travel experiences and isn’t just limited to staying in a local’s spare room. You can save $20 off your first stay with this Airbnb link.\n\nIf you are looking for hostels or cheap hotels in Moldova, all of the accommodation below have been recommended by solo female travellers from our Girls about the Globe community and come with our Solo Female Friendly endorsement.

The staff are really friendly and helpful which helps when you are travelling solo.\n\nThe hostel was really warm and they give you plastic slippers to wear. It is a small hostel and only has one bathroom (similar to others in Chișinău), but it’s fine for the price and worth taking a private room for your own space. Choose from a 4 or 6 bed mixed dorm or a private room.\n\nPrices start from £4 for a bed in a 6-bed dorm\n\nTo book, check prices or availability for Retro Moldova\n\nChișinău – Chisinau Hotel\n\nIf you enjoy staying in historical places, this old Soviet-style grand hotel is one of the oldest hotels in Moldova Chisinau. It was built in the 1950’s and is located in the city centre, just 10 minutes from the train station.\n\nAlthough certain fixtures are now just for decoration (such as the fridge), and you have to wait a long time for hot water, it is definitely an experience. Choose from a standard or comfort single room, a double room or suite.\n\nPrices start from £20 for a standard single room per night\n\nTo book, check prices or availability for Chisinau Hotel\n\nOld Orhei – Vila Roz\n\nThis lovely guest house is in Trebujeni village near Old Orhei.

Bathrooms are shared and there is also a BBQ.\n\nPrices start from £20 for a single room including breakfast\n\nTo book, check prices or availability for Vila Roz\n\nTransnistria – Tiraspol Hostel\n\nIf you ever wondered what spending a night in an old Soviet apartment block is like, try Tiraspol Hostel. Tim’s place is a great experience but you do need to have a sense of adventure to stay here. It’s not a hostel as such and is in a residential part of the capital.\n\nPrices start from £15 for a dorm bed per night.\n\nTo book or check availability for Tiraspol Hostel\n\nMoldova Tours\n\nIntrepid Moldova – Intrepid Travel are a responsible tour company which are popular with solo travellers.

You can’t come all the way here and not sample the Moldovan wine.\n\nTiraspol Hostel – Tim at Tiraspol Hostel shows you the best of Transnistria on his guided tours. Anything you want to do here he’ll help you to arrange it. From a city tour to hidden Soviet villages and abandoned Soviet factories to tours of the autonomous republic of Gagauzia.\n\nTravelling Around Moldova\n\nWhen you solo travel Moldova, the most common way to get around the country is by bus. You can hire a car but some of the roads aren’t that great and you can get stopped by police and fined for no reason. The capital is the main hub for the buses but don’t expect it to look like a bus station you may be used to. If the bus has a yellow sign it is a public bus.\n\nIf you are heading to Transnistria there are buses which leave regularly. You may find yourself sharing a car to go across the ‘border’ between Moldova and Transnistria instead of a bus if you go with a man calling “Transnistria.” There is also a tram within the capital called a trolleybus where you pay onboard.\n\nWhen you travel in Moldova, taxi drivers aren’t the best and may not know where the address is so be prepared if you take a taxi. Use Rome2Rio to find your way around.\n\nMoldova Itinerary\n\nA week is a good amount of time to see Moldova. The following is a week Moldova travel itinerary of where to stay to see the best Moldova tourist attractions. Alternatively you can choose to base yourself in the capital and take full day trips from here instead.\n\nChișinău – 3 nights, Old Orhei – 1 night, Soroca – 1 night, Tiraspol – 2 nights.\n\nBest Time To Go To Moldova\n\nThere isn’t a particular season to visit Moldova although you may feel more comfortable visiting in the spring or the autumn. The winter is still a great time to sightsee although some of the outdoor activities may be limited. It can get warm in the summer months so the most ideal months and best time to visit Moldova is April and May.\n\nThis chart shows the average maximum day temperatures for Chișinău (from January to December).\n\nFrom Chisinau Airport\n\nThere are taxis at the airport but sometimes the taxi drivers can’t locate your address and they will try and rip you off. Expect to pay at least €15. Pre-book a transfer with your accommodation if you can or through Go Adventure Moldova. Their airport transfers cost €20 and will take you to your accommodation in Chișinău.\n\nBorder Crossings – (check visas before you travel)\n\nIf you are travelling south through Moldova to Transnistria you go through a border crossing. Write down the name and address of the place you are staying at. The bus takes 1 hour 20 minutes and departs every 30 minutes from Chișinău. The bus costs 25 Leu or you can ask for a shared car at the bus station for 50 Leu which takes you to the train station in Tiraspol.\n\nMoldova to Ukraine\n\nIf you visit Chișinău there is an overnight train to Kiev which takes nearly 12 hours and appears to run daily. Check here for timetables.\n\nFrom Tiraspol, the capital of Transnistria you can travel to Odessa by old Soviet train. Trains cost £6.00 and leave at 09.44 arriving in Odessa at 12.27.\n\nMoldova to Romania\n\nTo travel to Romania there is a nice train to Bucharest. You can’t book your train online so buy direct to the station. Check rail.cc for timetables.\n\nWhere can I go from here?\n\nRussia (Moscow) – 1 hour 40 mins\n\nGreece (Athens) – 2 hours\n\nItaly (Rome) – 2.5 hours\n\nFAQs\n\nCan I drink the water? Yes?\n\nIs tipping expected? No it isn’t required but being a poor country is good practice to leave 10%\n\nFixed price or barter? Fixed price\n\nAny ATMs? Yes in the towns.\n\nWhich side of the road do they drive? Right-hand side.\n\nGood for vegetarians? The capital does have some vegetarian restaurants. The traditional food does include maize and cheese so the local villages may not great for vegans.\n\nAny Seven Wonders of the World? No, none of the Moldova attractions are.\n\nMap of Moldova\n\nRelated Posts"
