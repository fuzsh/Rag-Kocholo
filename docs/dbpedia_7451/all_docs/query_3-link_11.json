        "text": "This week’s guest is Sarah Gallo. She is a travel blogger, social media expert and owns a consulting company. This is her bio so you can learn more about her…..\n\nHi, I’m Sarah, The Five Foot Traveler, and I choose to dream out loud. After conquering a crippling fear of flying, I’ve developed an unquenchable passion for traveling. Since my newfound freedom, I have set foot on all seven continents, explored 112 countries, and continue to strive to live life to the fullest. My highlights include paragliding through the Swiss Alps, ringing in the New Year on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, jumping off the world's highest bungee bridge in South Africa, trekking through Patagonia, seeing sea lions bathe their newborn pups in the Galapagos Islands, hiking from the Mediterranean Sea to the Sea of Galilee in Israel, bushcamping in the Okavango Delta in Botswana, and polar plunging in Antarctica on Christmas Day.\n\nThe reality is that I hunger for more. I want to eliminate the stereotype and prove that women can hang with the guys, even someone only five feet tall! Because of my size and gender, people are concerned for me when I travel. No, I won’t get kidnapped in Brazil or sold as a sex slave in Thailand or become infected with Ebola in Africa – I refuse to live my life in fear. I will not shy away from anyone, anything or anyplace. I have been chased by Jordanian thugs, unceremoniously dumped from a bus in the middle of the Argentinean desert, eaten caterpillars with African tribes, and swam in the icy waters of Antarctica on Christmas Day.\n\nI want to leave my footprint on the world, all while smiling, laughing, and discovering our extraordinary planet. More than anything in my life, traveling has prepared me for adult independence. From planning trips, to navigating foreign cities, to fostering international friendships, I've learned more about myself than I ever did in University. It's forced me to put myself out there, to figure out the answers to my own questions, to manage my own finances, and to be creative when confronted with unexpected roadblocks. It's taught me to appreciate the life that I've been given by opening my eyes to various cultures and customs worldwide.\n\nHappy Birthday to Nakeiltha A. Campbell a.k.a “Nikki”- percussionist, teaching artist, producer and performer whose work promotes empowerment through the celebration of African cultural heritage. Born in Colon, Panama, and raised in Los Angeles, Nikki uses drumming to express her unique Afro Latin-Carribean Panamanian lineage, extend a legacy of women drumming in the African diasporic traditions, and celebrate the intense study of rhythm. Introduced to drumming through the Mandinka and Afro Latin traditions, Nikki is rooted in a diverse repertoire including West African dun-duns, Djembe, Congas and Cuban Bata, Brazilian samba, and African American soul flavors, which she interweaves to create her unique sound. For the past ten years, Nikki has worked professionally as an artist and educator to share her talent and knowledge with young public school students, women drummers from across the USA, and the people of her home country.\n\nShe considers herself fortunate to study and work with a wide variety of local and international artist such as Mamady Keita (T.T.M Drum School) Balandugu Kan Kahlil Cummings, Robertito Melendez latin percussion school. A recipient award winner as an apprentice to study West African Music with Aboubakar Kouyate with the Alliance for California Traditional Arts. Also, for the Ambassador Award presented by Los Angeles Viva Panama Organization Inc for her contribution to the educational and musical fields.\n\nHer recording experience includes African drums in the theme song featured film \"Let the games begin\" produce by Aloe Blacc, as well for Kendrick Lamar track for his historic performance \"Alright\" at the Grammy Awards. The Rebirth Album Being thru the Eyes of a Child, Chocolate (on the coco farm) by Maya Jupiter.\n\nNikki currently tours with Lila Downs, toured with Les Amazones \"The Women Master Drummers of Guinea\", Viver Brasil dance company, Adaawe, and The Rebirth. Performed with world renown artist Stevie Wonder, Aloe Blacc and Jose Gonzales. Performed at the NAACP Image Awards with Will I AM, the 53rd Grammy Award with Rihanna, American Idol with Janelle Monae & Jidenna, Additionally, recorded an instructional percussion video with Kids for Sesame Street for Latin Heritage Month. Performed for the World Culture KCET Women in Jazz celebration, the 4th and 5th Annual Palm Springs Woman Jazz Festival.\n\nIn 2015, Nikki founded “Puentes de Poder”, a cross cultural exchange program that promotes empowerment and unity through music. Project has traveled to Costa Rica and Panama to teach, perform, and present music as a form cultural history and continuity. Nikki supports and encourages people of all ages, genders, and nationalities to explore percussion as a means of communication, connection and collaboration.\n\nHappy Birthday to Leigh Howard Stevens. His repertoire ranges from Renaissance music and the Preludes and Fugues of J. S. Bach, to original marimba works written by contemporary composers expressly for him. Many of these original compositions were considered too challenging, both technically and musically, to be performed by solo marimbists until the development of Mr. Stevens’ new system of four-mallet technique. Percussionists and marimbists, the world over, have adopted his revolutionary approach to 4-mallet technique, as set forth in his ground-breaking book, Method of Movement, which has been published in six languages.\n\nThere isn’t a single aspect of marimba technique, repertoire or design that has not been profoundly influenced by the work of Leigh Howard Stevens. From “Stevens Grip” to the types of motions used to play the instrument; from the length and material of the mallet handles to the wrapping and stitching of the heads; from the first height-adjustable all wooden marimba frame in the 1980s to the first fully-tunable resonators in the 1990s; from one-handed rolls and baroque ornaments to the use of expressive contrasting roll types; from the early polyphonic Helble Preludes to the works of John Serry, David Maslanka and Joseph Schwantner, to his own original compositions and transcriptions.\n\nConsidered “revolutionary” at the time, many of his ideas are now considered to be basic technique, and in fact, have become routine in contemporary marimba compositions and performance. It is no exaggeration to say that Leigh Howard Stevens has been at the very heart of the growth of marimba repertoire, development of its pedagogy, and improvement of the instrument’s design over the last 45 years.\n\nThis fresh approach to music making on the marimba has greatly expanded the instrument’s compositional possibilities, stimulated composer enthusiasm for the marimba’s use in solo and chamber music and ultimately led to a series of more than 30 world premiere performances by Mr. Stevens. The first performance of Raymond Helble’s Concerto for Marimba and Orchestra by Leigh Howard Stevens and the Denver Symphony in 1980 was a milestone in the development of marimba literature. His digitally recorded all-Bach album has been greeted with rave reviews for its artistry by magazines as diverse as Stereophile and Billboard.\n\nDevoted marimba lovers have sprung up all over the world – both players and the general public – converted by Leigh Howard Stevens’ solo recitals, hundreds of college campus appearances, concertos with symphony orchestra, European concert tours, masterclasses and radio and television appearances both here and abroad. He has been featured in Time Magazine, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, and appeared on National Public Radio’s All Things Considered, and Voice of America’s internationally broadcast, New York, New York. His celebrated musicianship, imaginative programming and exciting performances have inspired critical acclaim and standing ovations in 48 states in the USA and in 18 foreign countries. Mr. Stevens introduced the marimba to The People’s Republic of China in a televised performance in 1994 that reportedly reached an audience of 80 million viewers.\n\nMr. Stevens is the founder and chief creative force behind Malletech, the world leader in design and manufacturing of keyboard percussion instruments used by professional percussionists. He has been awarded nine U.S. Patents for musical instrument design. In addition to performing on a 5-octave Malletech Marimba of his own design, he also led the creative team that developed the company’s game-changing OmegaVibe and LoveVibe. Mr. Stevens taught for many years at the Royal Academy of Music in London, England, where he was Professor of Marimba. He was elected to the Percussive Arts Society Hall of Fame in 2006.\n\nSarah’s backpack of choice are made by Osprey.

Use the social media to drive your fans/followers, to your website.\n\nSarah talk about how the platforms are different for what they want from content creators.\n\nIf possible, post to each platform individually.\n\nTo get a blue checkmark, you can apply on the platforms, but you have a greater chance of receiving it if you are published in at least 5 major publications/reputable sources and/or are famous.\n\nSarah tends to post raw and unedited stuff in a story, and edited and prepared content as a post.\n\nSarah talks about insights to see when your fans/followers are online/engaging with your content.\n\nYou can use Instagram insights to learn more about overall trends across your followers and your content’s performance with your audience.

Here are some tips on how to make them better.\n\nDamon and Sarah talk about “Batching Content”.\n\nThe more preparation you can do ahead of time will make your travel smoother (i.e. have your boarding pass handy-printed or on your device, have travel insurance, having your gear insured, passport, proof of vax/PCR test results, etc). Sarah lives by a fanny pack.\n\nGET WHERE YOU NEED TO BE EARLY!\n\nMake reservations in advance (hotel, car, flight, ferry, etc).\n\nSarah mentions eating healthy before and during travel days.\n\nHere are some things you should have in your car if you are traveling by that method: EZ pass, Roadside kit (with jumper cables/flares/tire repair tools), a paper road atlas when your GPS can’t connect, AAA.\n\nSarah suggests polarized sunglasses, hair ties and sunblock in case you get stranded.\n\nDamon also keeps water Advil, dry snacks, and a flashlight in his glove compartment.\n\nSarah recommends a local sim card if you are traveling internationally. Damon asks about an International Driver’s Permit.\n\nCheck out CENTERED, a travel wellness platform. Use invite code THE5FT for access.\n\nSome other apps Sarah uses are:\n\nGoogle Translate,\n\nMomando for flights,\n\nRome2Rio for road trip routes.\n\nHopper for when to buy flights,\n\nAirbnb\n\nCampermate\n\nHappy Cow for vegan and vegetarian eating establishments.\n\nI Know the Pilot for last min travel deals\n\nTravel Safe\n\nTripIt\n\nDamon has (in addition to Airbnb and Google Translate):\n\nHotel reward apps (Hilton Honors, IHG and Marriott BonVoy)\n\nUber/Lyft\n\nHotel Tonight\n\nMaster Tour\n\nGoogle Maps/Waze\n\nParkmobile\n\nSarah recommends signing up with reward programs with all the hotels and airlines.\n\nSarah just got hip to TSA Pre check. Damon was a TSA Pre check guy and upgraded to Global Entry. Both of them have Moblie Pass on their phones.\n\nDamon brings up the “Six Month Validity” rule. It is not a requirement of the U.S. government. The six-month validity passport rule is a requirement of other countries accepting foreign travelers. The six- month passport validity rule is enforced because nations do not want to risk having travelers and tourists overstaying their passport validity. Six months is now the standard validity requirement for many countries. Most visitors to the United States are also now required to have six months validity of their passports.\n\nHere is the list of U.S. Embassies in each country.\n\nThese are the full 21 pages of the FAA musical instrument rules. TL,DR (Too long, Didn’t read)…..\n\nAirlines must accommodate musical instruments as carry-on items as long as there is room available in the overhead bin or under-seat area at the time of boarding and the instrument can be safely stowed. Instruments should be in a case or cover to avoid injuring passengers. While not all airlines permit passengers to purchase a seat for larger instruments, the DOT has encouraged them to do so.\n\nAirlines must allow musicians to check musical instruments in the baggage hold upon request, as long as the sum of the length, width, and height of the exterior case dimensions does not exceed 150 inches or the applicable size restrictions for the aircraft; its weight does not exceed 165 pounds or the applicable weight restrictions for the aircraft. As a practical matter, the aircraft’s cargo hold should be sufficiently large to accommodate such items. Larger instruments allowed as checked baggage may be subject to the same oversize or overweight fees that would apply to other checked baggage of that size and weight.\n\nHere are some Merino wool brands (DO NOT PUT THIS IN THE DRYER-AIR DRY ONLY):\n\nDarn Tough (socks)\n\nWool and Prince\n\nExOfficio (specifically the undies)\n\nUnbound\n\nOutlier\n\nIce Breaker\n\nAnatomie (for lightweight travel clothing)\n\nPatagonia\n\nPrAna\n\nCompression socks are Ahhhhh-Mazzzz-Ing. Here is a list of some. Here are even more options.\n\nSarah is diligent about working out in her hotel room on the road. Damon brings a jump rope with him.\n\nSarah makes it a point to eat healthy when traveling. Sarah mentions Airfare pouches and Damon gets snacks from Trader Joe’s.\n\nSarah prefers road trips in cars.\n\nSarah leans toward hotels in cities and Airbnb in the countryside, BUT it is a case by case basis.\n\nDamon brings up the Golden Malted industrial waffle maker that you can only get if you are a hotel, school cafeteria or own a restaurant.\n\nSarah prefers French Toast, Pancakes, Waffles and then Crepes in that order.\n\nThe end of the interview ends with Damon showing the cork globe with push pins to mark where he has traveled.\n\nYou can follow Sarah (the Five Foot Traveler) on her Website, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, and LinkedIn. You can also hire her to consult for your business.\n\nThe song leading out of the interview is “Mysterious Ways” by U2."
