        "text": "There’s no doubt about it: traveling is AWESOME. But it’s also crazy overwhelming. How do you decide where to go? What’s the secret to scoring cheap flights? Is it *really* safe to stay in a hostel? And on top of all that – how do you travel like a local?\n\nDon’t worry, I’ve got you! This is my list of top travel resources to help you plan the best trip ever! It includes all the websites I personally use to book flights, accommodation, tours and more. Ready, set, adventure!\n\nDisclosure: Some of these links are affiliate links which means I earn a small commission if you make a purchase (at no additional cost to you). Thanks for your support!\n\nTravel WiFi\n\nOnce upon a time, I used to collect SIM cards like 90’s kids collected Beanie Babies. I had one for each country I visited and multiple phone numbers I could never remember. Why? So I could always have internet (I’m an addict and I know it). Nowadays, I use a Travelwifi Hotspot. I get internet pretty much everywhere and can use it for multiple devices. You can read my review (which includes when to get one and when to get a local SIM instead) here.\n\nAnker Power Bank\n\nI don’t know if I’m a phone addict or what (jk, the answer to that is an unfortunate but resounding yes) but I legit don’t understand how people can travel without a power bank. You’re out and about all day and using your phone to navigate, take photos, and who knows what else. I always carry my Anker Power Bank with me while I’m traveling. It’s light, holds multiple charges, and charges phones quickly. Win!\n\nTortuga Outbreaker Backpack\n\nWaterproof, durable and comfortable: the Tortuga Outbreaker is hands down my #1 pick for the best travel backpack. It has a ridiculous number of pockets to keep you incredibly organized, has lockable zippers, and is height-adjustable for the perfect body fit. I can’t say enough good things about it. If you’re looking for something a little more budget-friendly, the Osprey Fairview is a spectacular option.\n\nAway Bigger Carry On\n\nI travel with my backpack most of the time (especially if I’m going to multiple cities) but if I don’t bring my backpack, I use my Away Bigger Carry On (which I’m obsessed with). I used to always buy inexpensive suitcases to save money but most of them didn’t survive longer than a few trips. This suitcase has been adventuring with me for several years and it still looks new. It’s definitely a worthy investment!\n\nCompression Packing Cubes\n\nI never understood why people needed packing cubes until I got some of my own. Now I can no longer travel without them. They’re legit the BEST for keeping organized! Now I avoid what I fondly call “exploding suitcase syndrome” – that tendency for all your things to go all over the place every time you need to get one thing from your suitcase. They’re a serious game-changer for organization.\n\nLewis N Clark Anti-Theft Purse\n\nYou know what’s a problem in a LOT of countries? Pickpocketing. Most people worry about big crimes happening while they’re on the road, but the reality is, petty theft is the most common issue travelers face. That’s why I always travel with this lockable purse. It’s not the cutest but it’s surprisingly roomy (it fits my giant wallet, several cameras and my water bottle) and has two locking pockets and sturdy straps. Do yourself a favor and pick one up!\n\nSony Rx100 ii Camera\n\nDSLRs are all the rage nowadays but I’ve been a loyal fan to my Sony Rx100 ii for the last few years (Sony is on their sixth edition of this camera now). It may look like a basic point and shoot, but it’s definitely so much more. This camera takes amazing photos thanks to a high-quality lens but is still small enough to fit in my purse or large pocket.\n\nJOBY GorillaPod\n\nHave you ever wanted to take a photo of yourself, your group or even a landscape but there’s nowhere flat to put down your camera? Then you need a GorillaPod! It’s a bendy tripod that allows you to attach your camera to trees, fences, signposts…any object really. Plus it’s smaller and much more convenient than a regular tripod. I bring mine everywhere!\n\nGRAYL Purifying Water Bottle\n\nI always bring a water bottle with me when I travel because single-use plastic sucks for the planet and buying lots of bottled water is expensive and inconvenient. In many countries, you can’t drink the tap water unless it’s filtered first, which is why I always bring this purifying water bottle with me. Not only has it saved me money in the long run and kept me healthy but it’s a small way reduce my plastic consumption. Win!"
