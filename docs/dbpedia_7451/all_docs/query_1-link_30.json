With the new access options, developers will be able to make 100,000 search requests per month without charge.\n\nThe idea here is to boost adoption of the service, encouraging sites to offer multi-modal travel search. Melbourne, Australia-based Rome2rio CEO Rod Cuthbert believes that “any site that’s serious about selling travel in Europe and Asia has to offer multi-modal search sooner or later.”"
