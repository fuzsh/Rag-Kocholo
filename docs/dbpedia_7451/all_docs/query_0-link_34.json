The scammers are not PayPal but the scammers used a PayPal feature to get it to email a message with valid PayPal links. The scam works when you use PayPal to view the invoice and can't see it so you call the phone number to see what is going on. It's the scammers number.\n\nI got the message and tracked sender and links and they were valid but I was suspicious anyway because of two things. One part of the message said \"debited to\" instead of \"debited from\" and another said \"$600. 00\" with a space which an automated program would not do. I finally realized it was fake when I checked my file where I stored my PayPal data. It was seven years since I used PayPal and I had forgotten that I signed up for it with a different email account.\n\nAnyway, here is a webpage with warning information and a YouTube video that explains how the scammers pulled off the trick if you are interested in the technical details.\n\nLast edited: Sep 3, 2022\n\nnaplesdon\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nMultiple Caminos 2010 to 2019\n\nSep 3, 2022\n\n#8\n\nI received so many scam notices from PayPal telling my account had been suspended and to respond immediately.

I quit using them and closed my account.\n\nThose notices didn't come from PayPal. I used to get them even before I had a PayPal account. Just like the notices about the credit cards I don't have (or even do have), and the Amazon deliveries I don't have, or the Microsoft virus I don't have. The scammers know that most people have some such accounts, so they do a blanket issue of the scam email. You will get these notices whether or not you have an account with the targeted site. Some land on fallow ground (where the recipient does have an account) and others do not.\n\nTincatinker\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n2012\n\nSep 3, 2022\n\n#12\n\nThere are options on the renfe website traveling from Santiago de Compostela to Madrid at noon and 2pm on Sept 20, 2022... which work better for my schedule, why do other travel tool websites like Rome2rio and Omni only show 4 making that route, 2 early in the morning, 1 late afternoon and 1 at night?\n\nAm I not understanding the Renfe site correctly?\n\nThis thread has wandered a bit but to answer the OP. It’s a reasonable assumption that the company that actually runs the trains knows what trains they are running and when.\n\nThe simplest test you can apply is to try and book a ticket for your desired train.

The original developers came up with some really great software that did an amazing job at crawling across millions of data points and delivering multiple, simple resolutions to travel logistics. Rome2rio is now owned by Omio. A ticket seller. It will not point you at a logistical resolution for which it cannot sell you a ticket.\n\nYour life has been improved.

I don’t understand why it’s cheaper or why these don’t show on Rome2Rio, hopefully it’s not a nasty surprise.\n\nIt's possibly cheaper because it's a bit slower (it stops at more stations) and I think you may have to change trains in Ourense. You can check the details of the trip on the Renfe site once you choose a particular train ticket, it's a link below the ticketing information.\n\nJ Willhaus\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n2016, 2022, 2023, 2024, planned 2025\n\nSep 4, 2022\n\n#18\n\nThank you everyone.
