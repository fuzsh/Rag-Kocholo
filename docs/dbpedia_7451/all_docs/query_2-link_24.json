We're staying a night or two in Winchester before getting on the ship at Southampton (because I must pay my respects to Jane Austen at her burial place in Winchester Cathedral).\n\nI'd like to book a car service but I'm not sure which are reliable (any recommendations would be lovely), plus I don't know how to time the booking, given we don't know how long it will take to get through customs after we deplane. If it matters, our flight lands at Heathrow at about 3pm.\n\nI looked into coach buses and trains, and neither of those options seemed very convenient. We can afford a car service and prefer that option.\n\nI figured we'd get a taxi from Winchester to Southampton. Any advice on whether that is straightforward or not, I am all ears.\n\nThank you all for any insights."
