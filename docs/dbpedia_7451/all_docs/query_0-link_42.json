        "text": "We will be travelling to Italy end of Jun to mid-July, and we are planning to visit many different places and cities in Italy, from Rome to Venice to Florence to Naples to Amalfi coast and back to Rome. We have a very busy itinerary and I want to pre-plan as much as possible. So, to get from and to our destination points, I was planning to buy all the transport tickets in advance, so that I don't have to worry about how we get from point A to point C through the point B.\n\nOf course, the most convenient and the cheapest option for most destinations is trains, so I was planning to buy all the train tickets in advance. But now reading that there are quite a few train strikes planned for May (we are in end of April now), so I assume there may be strikes in June and July too, right?\n\nAnyway, thinking if I should buy all the train tickets in advance or should I just buy them directly at the station (if there are no strikes)? Is it easy to buy from the station? Should I be worried that there might be no tickets to go where we need to? If there are train strikes, how easy it will be to have to buy bus tickets (like Flip Bus, for ex.)? Will there be enough of available bus tickets?\n\nAlso, how easy is it (and if I should?) to buy in advance bus tickets from the train stations to smaller towns (like Gaeta and Minori)? How do you normally pay for the local buses there?\n\nThank you very much for all your responses and advice!"
