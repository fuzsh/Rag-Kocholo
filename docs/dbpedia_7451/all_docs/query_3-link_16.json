        "text": "Venice really needs at least 3 nights, else you'll end up spending most of your time surrounded by mobs of other visitors at the same few sights it seems everyone wants to see. The charm of Venice is in the little canals, the lost corners. Give yourself time to explore them.\n\nI like Bologna, but you need to drop it from this trip and add at least one night to Venice. Although Bologna's large medieval center is great for exploration and the city is known for good food, one of the pluses of Bologna is that it is brilliantly positioned for day-trips to a lot of surrounding places. You don't have time to take any of those trips.\n\nI agree with acraven that Venice needs 3 nights. One of our favorites places in Italy, so much more than \"just the usual sights\"\n\nI get why you want to see Bologna as well. I'm adding it to our Sept trip and taking nights from Milan- just can't get excited about Milan- 1 night there will do I think\n\nYou could give Milan just 1 night- get up early and see what you want to see- Duomo, Galleria won't take all day. Take a late afternoon train to Venice so you have 3 nights there and can hit the ground running next am- gives you 2 full days there which is way better than 1.5\n\nWow, great feedback so far. So you're saying stay one night in Milan, get up explore and leave for Venice later afternoon? If that's the case check out will normally be around 11am?, and we probably will be down exploring around 5-6pm? So leave for Venice then, and spend a night there?\n\nI also am concerned about our luggage. Can our lodging hold our luggage and then we come back for it and grab our train. Is this frowned upon in Italy? Ideally, I'd love to check out (have them hold our bags securely) and go explore come back and grab gear and head to train for Venice.\n\nThe thing with Bologna is we need to fill 2 nights up, and it seems to fit our flow and train travel direction. One thing I remember people saying is regardless, try not to do 1 night stays. It's not worth the travel time, check in/out, and unpacking you'd have to do.\n\nYes- your hotel will hold your luggage- never been to one that didn't.\n\nYou don't need to wait til check out time to get out sightseeing- get to the Duomo, etc early before the crowds.\n\nI'd guess you could really be done with Milan earlier than 5-6.\n\nTrue about 1 night stays- but in your case it's your arrival city and probably of the least interest- so to me that's OK.\n\n2 nights in Bologna is fine as well- It's a short train trip from Venice (1.5hr) and you are not jet lagged anymore\n\nThen another short train ride to Florence (40 min) so in each location you do have that first almost full day.\n\n@Chani\n\nThank you for the tip!\n\nIs there a water taxi that can take us to the island? Or is it just a pain in the neck? I like the idea of being in the thick of it and then maybe taking a break from the other tourists. If that's possible with Venice - if not no big deal. Is there a place within the city that is hidden or tucked away where I stay that's relatively not a tourist hotel/lodging?\n\nAs far as A/C goes:\n\nI just check weather info: 70 degrees Fahrenheit average with 70% humidly. That shouldn't be too bad, right? I live in Ventura, CA and it is pretty much reflects the same statistics. Should I be worries about the heat, need for A/C options now?\n\nYou will go thru passport control in Zurich << this is where you will enter Schengen-- you are now in the Schengen Zone- look it up- so when you land in Milan you simply have to deplane, walk thru customs \"nothing to declare\" and be on your way.\n\nThe fastest/least expensive way to get to Milan is via the Malpensa Express or Malpensa Shuttle which will take you to Milan Centrale (or Cadorna Station but looks like your hotel is closer to Centrale)\n\nFrom Centrale you can either walk or take a tram or grab a taxi to your hotel (I'd take a taxi after such a long travel day)\n\nGo outside the station and find the taxi rank out front- do not go with anyone who offers a taxi unless it is in the official taxi line up.\n\nA cab from Malpensa airport to the center is probably about 100+ Euros- totally unnecessary\n\nThere is a Malpensa Express- (train) or Malpensa Shuttle (bus)-\n\nExpress is a 51-54 min ride but allow time to get TO it and get ON it. Both will drop you at Milan Centrale.\n\nhttps://www.malpensaexpress.it/en/\n\nhttps://www.malpensashuttle.it\n\nIf you haven't already-- do pick up RS Italy guide book- full of valuable, practical info\n\n( except he doesn’t include Bologna)\n\nHere is a website I like to use for figuring out transpo options:\n\nwww.rome2rio.com\n\nYou can purchase your fast train tix to Venice, Bologna, Florence and Rome in advance for nicely discounted rates - as long as you are committed to a certain time.\n\nwww.treniltaila.com\n\nThis site will tell you all you need to know about Italian trains\n\nhttps://www.seat61.com/Italy-trains.htm\n\ncory-\n\nWhat I mean is you are not stepping off the plane right onto the train. You will need to find your way to the underground station follow signs- then buy your ticket in a vending machine or ticket window, find your train and get on. That takes time when you are not familiar with the airport and you are in a foreign country. There will be some signage in English- but mostly Italian ;)\n\nBe sure to validate your ticket before you board.\n\nI always buy the full RS guide so I don't know about \"Best of\" but probably fine for where you are going (again no Bologna- for some reason Rick never includes- which is probably a good thing!)\n\nYou can buy it on Amazon for a few bucks less and free shipping if you are Prime- or at least faster shipping.\n\nshouldn't our lodging be a good balance of distance between the\n\nduomo/mall and fast-train station?\n\nYes. I've just spent the past few days looking at hotels in that area myself and there is not much other than the ones I mentioned which are closer to station than Duomo. Anything I see closer to Duomo is more expensive. We always like to be within walking distance of BOTH center and station when possible. The hotels I listed above are all about 10 min walk to station, but more like 30 min. to Duomo- at least it is flat and there is tram.\n\nAnother option that is a bit closer to Duomo is the NH Milano Touring- that's a European chain that is very nice and they have excellent bfkts. If you go to their website- sign up for the reward program and you get a discounted rate.\n\nI like booking.com- you can set your filters- search for location, price range, see the map view, AC? elevator? bkft? cancellable? (I always book a cancellable rate). Read the reviews there as they can only be posted by folks who have actually stayed there unlike TripAdvisor. You can even filter the reviews by \"wifi\" \"location\" \"quietness\" etc\n\nIf you need a place in Bologna- I just booked this hotel\n\nhttps://www.hotelinternazionalebologna.com/en/\n\nHotel Internazionale 322€ for 2 nights w/bkft- it is equi-distance from station and center- about 8 min walk either way.\n\nWe are more than twice your age so location/walking distance is really important to us!\n\nYour Rome hotel is fine- it is right at Spanish Steps which can be a bit noisy/hectic/touristy. We like staying near Pantheon/Piazza Navonna/Campo De'Fiori- from there you can walk everywhere.\n\nI don't think anyone above congratulated you on your upcoming wedding- so Congratulations! And you could not have picked a better place to honeymoon!\n\n@gerri\n\nWe plan on only using one carry one and one person item per person.\n\nI don't have a scale, but each carry on should be under 20lbs. I don't think that we will pack out each carry on more than that. However, again, I don't have a scale.\n\nSWISS 's policy is 7kg (15lbs) per carry on. So maybe I'll use my bathroom scale and weigh the bags. I'm not really worried about the carry on weight cut-off.\n\nit's the person bag weight/dimensions I'm more concern about.\n\n\"All passengers on Swiss Air can bring 1 personal item into the cabin measuring up to 15.7 x 11.8 x 3.9 inches (40 x 30 x 10 cm). Jan 20, 2020\"\n\nAs a man this is hard, lol. My fiance's purse should be okay but I don't own anything that small. However the fjallraven kanken 2 pretty much fits those specs and It can be used by men."
