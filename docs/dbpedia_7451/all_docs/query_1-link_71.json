        "text": "I live in Athens, the current capital city of Greece and I would like to go to the first capital of Modern Greece, Nafplio.\n\nAs the simplest option, I could walk. It is 126 kms from Omonia (a square in the center of Athens) via Salamina Island (take two ferries to and from the island) plus 16 kms from my house to Omonia. Google maps says I could walk there in 32 hours from my house. I am going to Nafplio for three days so for this time I skipped this option.\n\nThe second best easy option: I could cycle. From my previous experiences cycling in that region, it takes a full day for me to go there. I could cycle from my house to Piraeus (app 1.5–2 hours), then take the first boat to Methana (app 1.5–2 hours) and then cycle the next 70 kms. This is a three day trip to see Nafplio so spending two days on the road does not make sense so I passed this one too. By the way, the Methana — Epidavros — Nafplio and back to Methana route is perfect for a three day cycling trip. A kind reminder, as Google Maps does not give cycling as an option in Greece.\n\nThe other option is public transport but Google Maps does not give any route. So I checked the Rome2Rio website. KTEL is the main intercity public transport bus service in Greece. From KTEL Argolidas (3 kms to Omonia) to Nafplio, I could take a bus which takes 2 hours 10 minutes and costs €13–16. From my house it takes about 1.5 hours to go to KTEL. I want to take my bicycle with me because it will be easier to cycle around Nafplio than walking. If I take my normal size bicycle, I am sure the bus operators will resist and then ask me to disassemble my bicycle. This means I have to take my foldable bicycle with me which is convenient for this kind of situation but not as comfortable as my normal size bicycle when I travel. Besides the fuss of carrying a bicycle in a bus, I do not like sitting in a bus for two hours.\n\nSo I continue with another mode of public transport which is rail trasnport. Unfortunately there is no option for a train! But I knew that there is a railway station at Nafplio. What happened? I checked The Hellenic Railways website and I found this at The Hellenic Train`s (OSE) website:\n\nThe historical railway station of Nafplio*\n\n“Nafplion was one of the first Greek cities to be accessed by train. In 1882, it was Charilaos Trikoupis who suggested that the train should pass through town. Two years later, the implementation of the plan began. Areos square was picked for the construction of the railway station. Earlier, in the beginning of 18th century, this region was outside the city walls, surrounded by the sea. Around 1720, the area was landscaped by the Turks and adorned with flower gardens and golden kiosks, becoming one of the finest locations of the old city.\n\nThe construction of the station complex was completed in 1885. The main two-storey building with the traditional carved canopy was compatible with the Neoclassic city atmosphere. In 1886, the railway station was in place and the Nafplion train began its long-lasting journey. For many years, the station was the meeting point of residents and the heart of the city. It was there that children gathered to play, it was from there that soldiers set out during the wars, it was there that newcomers arrived fueling the residents’ curiosity.\n\nUp to 1963, the station remained fully operational, performing all railway services. For the next decade, it was used only for commercial purposes and in 1983 it was donated to the Municipality of Nafplion.\n\nNowadays, the old railway station area operates as a park and recreation area, with gardens full of flowers, old locomotives, a theater and a cafeteria. The main station building houses the Nafplion Municipal Conservatory “Constantinos Nonis” and an adjacent building houses the children’s workshops organized by the Peloponnesian Folklore Foundation.\n\nThanks to its long history, the old station is one of the elements that have shaped the character of the historic town and still contributes to Nafplion’s social, cultural and artistic life.”\n\nThen I checked the current network status of railways in Greece.**\n\nBlue: Lines in use\n\nPurple: Touristic lines\n\nRed: inoperative lines\n\no Main stations\n\nHmmm, why is theNafplio line in red? Such an important line for the history of Greece? The whole Peloponnese region? The line was re-built not long ago, 10–15 years ago, if I remember correctly? And why there is no train to Patras, the third biggest city of Greece. And some of the areas in blue in the northern part of Greece are actually red, or see very little use at all. Then I started writing a thesis about sustainable transport in Greece but that is another story. Let’s continue with how I arrived in Nafplio for my short holiday.\n\nYes with a car. With the option I least prefer. Again I am in a car, going somewhere, actually have to use the car while going there because of the lack of the options I mentioned above. If I don’t use my bicycle or any other mode of public transport, the first question is why I cannot use them and I am stuck in a metal box which destroys many things around it: pollutes the air, consumes natural sources, destroys the green areas because it needs lots of space, makes many places uglier because the places which could be parks etc become parking areas for those metal boxes. By the way do you know that “[..] the average car is parked 95 percent of the time.”***? Now imagine how these areas could be used by others who need them more for clean air, for playing, for doing exercises, for picnics in nature which supports our mental condition etc etc.\n\nThis time the question struck me between Athens and Nafplio. Some years ago, I could walk to the metro station from my house in Athens (15 minutes walking), then I could transfer to the train and take off at the center of Nafplio, then I could walk to the place where I want to go in Nafplio. Now the options for doing this trip are either using a car or taking a bus, both of which are boring at the same level for me.\n\nThe meaning of boring changes from person to person, so let me explain what it does mean for me considering different modes of transport. If I am travelling alone, especially in a place where I have never been, I like watching the scenery, trying to notice the details of the place and trying to understand the region. If it is not a new place then I read, listen to music or podcasts, sometimes sleep depending on my mood. In a car, I cannot do this, especially if I am driving. I cannot fully concentrate on listening to music or podcasts because as a responsible driver I have to focus on the road (Do you know, each day how many people die in a road accident because of other people’s mistakes, lack of concentration etc?! A lot!****) If I am not driving and travelling in a car or in a bus, then I have to sit and sit and sit for an unknown time which depends on the traffic. But miraculously in a train, I can walk, even go to the restaurant car and eat and drink (TCDD İstanbul-Eskişehir, some of you will understand what I mean) and write and hug my loved ones and and…\n\nNothing is perfect, everything has many sides, “good” or “bad” as the simplest terms, depending on where you place them. In the part II, I will tell you where I position railways and their integration with other modes of transport when I travel. Yes, it includes cycling in Nafplio. I managed to take my bicycle with me.\n\n* https://www.hellenictrain.gr/en/historical-railway-station-nafplio\n\n** “The Current Network Status of Railways in Greece” via OSE. https://ose.gr/%CF%83%CE%B9%CE%B4%CE%B7%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%B4%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%BC%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C-%CE%B4%CE%AF%CE%BA%CF%84%CF%85%CE%BF/%CF%87%CE%AC%CF%81%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%82-%CE%B4%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%84%CF%8D%CE%BF%CF%85/.\n\n*** https://www.reinventingparking.org/2013/02/cars-are-parked-95-of-time-lets-check.html\n\n**** https://drivethru.gsa.gov/DRIVERSAFETY/DistractedDrivingPosterA.pdf"
