        "text": "Chicago, IL – On Nov. 9, Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney from Georgia came to Chicago. Rep. McKinney had been one of the few in Congress to dare to speak the truth about George W. Bush’s so-called war on terrorism. For her courage in telling the truth, she was betrayed by the Democratic Party. Targeted by the pro-Israel lobby and the Republicans, she lost her re-election bid in the Democratic primary in August.\n\nShe was invited here by Ujima PAC, a local nationalist organization that had raised money and volunteers for McKinney when it became clear she was under attack this summer.\n\nThe most influential Zionist organization, the American Israeli Political Action Committee – AIPAC – came after the congresswoman because “she was critical of U.S. foreign policy in relation to the Middle East,” said Randy Evans, one of the organizers of the Nov. 9 event. “Rep. McKinney refused to vote for the resolution by AIPAC in April endorsing the Israelis’ actions in the invading the Palestinian areas of the West Bank and Gaza.”\n\nMcKinney had also earned the wrath of George W. Bush because she dared to question his actions in the investigation of September 11. Her question: what did he know and when did he know it? Plus, she pointed out that his family has investments in oil and weapons companies, so he personally benefits from the war in Afghanistan and the one he is threatening on Iraq.\n\nThese truths are such a threat to the powers-that-be in Washington that the Republicans urged their members in Georgia to cross over to the Democratic primary to vote for her opponent.\n\nRep. McKinney isn’t going away. She will be a speaker at the Jan. 18 anti-war march in Washington D.C. Further, as she said in her farewell speech to the Congressional Black Caucus, “I know that as we continue to speak out on behalf of the poor and the marginalized in this country, my supporters across the spectrum, and across America will be right there with me.”"
