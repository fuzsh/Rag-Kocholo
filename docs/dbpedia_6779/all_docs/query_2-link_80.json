        "text": "Caucuses In Lieu of a Presidential Primary Election in Nevada\n\nPursuant to Nevada law, Nevada does not conduct Primary Elections to select Presidential candidates. Instead, major political parties hold caucuses. The political parties determine the dates of the caucuses and deadlines by which to be registered to attend. The Clark County Election Department is not involved in the conduct of caucuses. Also see the Nevada Secretary of State's web page on Presidential caucuses, that includes dates and contact information.\n\nCaucuses are private events that are directly run by the major political parties, not state or local governmental entities (www.voanews.com/a/how-us-presidential-primary-process-works/3167278.html). Caucuses are unique in that participants may openly show support for the candidate of their choice. Voting is often done by raising hands or breaking into groups according to the candidate participants support. However, a party may also decide to make the voting secret. The political party uses its caucus results to determine the delegates present at county, state, and national nominating conventions. In Nevada, only registered voters may participate in a caucus, and only in the caucus of the party with which they are affiliated in voter registration records (www.factcheck.org/2008/04/caucus-vs-primary). Each major party conducts their own caucuses differently. Contact the Democratic or Republican party for details.\n\nSee the Nevada Secretary of State's web page for a \"History of Nevada Presidential Preference Primary Elections and Caucuses.\"\n\nSee the Federal Government's web page for an Overview of the Presidential Election Process."
