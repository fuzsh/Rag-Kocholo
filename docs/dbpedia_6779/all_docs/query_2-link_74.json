        "text": "DNC spokesperson calls NYT editorial 'laughable'\n\nA spokesperson for the Democratic National Committee hit back at the New York Times editorial board tonight over its op-ed saying Biden should end his re-election bid.\n\n\"It's laughable,\" said spokesperson Abhi Rahman.\n\nThe Biden campaign dismissed the op-ed earlier tonight.\n\nBiden speaks at last campaign event of busy post-debate day\n\nBiden delivered remarks tonight at a New York fundraiser, capping a day of campaigning as he attempts to rebound from last night’s debate performance.\n\n\"When you get knocked down, you get back up,\" Biden said, repeating a phrase he used at a campaign rally earlier in the day.\n\nBiden also poked fun at his age, but said that it gave him the ability to get things done and tell the truth. \"This is a nation that believes in honesty,” he said.\n\nBefore the fundraiser, Biden held a rally in North Carolina and delivered remarks at the opening ceremony for the Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center in New York.\n\nThe Biden and Trump campaigns were hoping to appeal to Black voters in the first debate, but some expressed disappointment in both candidates after the faceoff. NBC News’ Shaquille Brewster reports.\n\nFirst lady recounts conversation with Biden about the debate\n\nand\n\nIn front of a New York fundraising audience this evening, first lady Jill Biden recounted a conversation she had with her husband after last night's debate.\n\n\"As Joe said earlier today, he’s not a young man,\" she said. \"And you know, after last night’s debate, he said, ‘You know, Jill, I don’t know what happened. I didn’t feel that great.’\"\n\nThe first lady said that she responded by saying, ‘Look, Joe, we are not going to let 90 minutes define the four years that you’ve been president.’”\n\nThe Supreme Court’s Jan. 6 ruling is expected to ripple through rioters’ cases but not necessarily Trump’s\n\nThe Supreme Court’s ruling Friday in favor of a Jan. 6 defendant charged with obstruction of an official proceeding quickly triggered activity in other Capitol rioter cases to revisit that charge, but it’s unlikely to derail former President Donald Trump’s federal election interference case.\n\nJustice Department officials and attorneys for Jan. 6 defendants said that the court’s 6-3 ruling in the case involving former Pennsylvania police officer Joseph Fischer would not have an immediate effect on most of the 1,000-plus convictions secured by prosecutors.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nDespite Biden’s dismal debate performance, abortion care providers remain resolute\n\n+4\n\n, , , and\n\nProponents of abortion rights were dumbfounded by Biden’s vague and sometimes incoherent messages on abortion access during last night’s debate, especially when he declined to rebuke Trump’s false claims that Democrats are in favor of killing babies.\n\n“The debate was a disaster,” said Dr. Warren Hern, director of the Boulder Abortion Clinic in Colorado. “It’s going to be hard to recover from this.”\n\nThe debate should have been a layup for people in favor of abortion rights. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, touted the fact that he nominated three anti-abortion justices to the Supreme Court while in office from 2017 to 2021. As a result, the constitutional right to an abortion was overturned in 2022, leaving states in charge of whether to allow women to terminate a pregnancy and at what stage.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nJoh Fetterman responds to The New York Times' op-ed: 'f--- that'\n\nSen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., slammed The New York Times' editorial board's opinion piece urging the president to drop out of the 2024 race.\n\nHis message on X was just two words: \"f--- that.\"\n\nFetterman has been a stalwart supporter of Biden.\n\nDemocratic National Committee touts grassroots organizing around debate\n\nBiden's allies are touting grassroots organizing and fundraising figures from debate night in a memo first shared with NBC News.\n\nThe memo, co-written by Biden campaign communications director Michael Tyler and Democratic National Committee communications director Rosemary Boeglin, highlighted the days ahead of the debate as \"mobilizing hundreds of thousands of grassroots supports online and off.\"\n\nThey said that the Biden campaign and its allies organized 436 watch parties across the country, leading to more than 12,000 in-person attendees in battleground states.\n\nTyler and Boeglin also pointed to supporters signing up for \"more than 1,500 volunteer shifts for our weekend of action in the battleground states.\" The campaign and allies also made nearly 1 million texts and calls to voters in battlegrounds, the memo said.\n\n\"While Republicans are in disarray and the Trump campaign continues to neglect crucial constituencies on the ground, the Biden-Harris campaign and Democrats across the country are not taking a single opportunity to engage voters for granted,\" the memo said. \"That’s how we’ll win in November.\"\n\nGeorgia Democrats worry for Biden but still plan to vote for him\n\nand\n\nAnne Fayssoux, 71, couldn't believe the Biden at the podium was the same one she saw deliver a rousing State of the Union address mere months earlier. At the debate's conclusion, she said she felt \"sad, anxious and upset.\"\n\n\"I think he’s deteriorated since his State of the Union speech that went so well. They did say that he had a cold. But he seemed a little more disabled than just someone with a cold,\" Fayssoux told NBC News.\n\nEven after noting Biden's numerous slip-ups she doubled down that Biden would receive her vote: \"No, there’s no way in heaven and earth that would vote for someone who tried to overthrow our government on January 6th,\" she said. \"I’d vote for Biden 100%.\"\n\nAnother traditionally Democratic voter, Andrew Rose, 50, was more critical of Biden and the debate as a whole.\n\n\"Oh, I was so disappointed in Biden. He was hoarse. He was pale. He looked really frail,\" Rose said. \"And, I mean, Trump just lied through his teeth the entire time. It was a disaster, start to finish, both sides.\"\n\nRose said that calls to have Biden step aside for another Democrat were uncalled for and continues to have \"confidence\" in the president to continue his campaign.\n\n\"I think he’ll be okay,\" Rose said. \"Just last night was just not a good look for him, but I think he’ll be okay.\"\n\nRose added that in the second face-off between Biden and Trump, he hopes the president will \"play up\" Trump's convicted felon status.\n\nDemocrats in swing-state Michigan divided over Biden's fitness\n\nDemocratic voters in Dearborn, Michigan, are split on whether Biden should step aside in order for the Democratic Party to nominate another candidate after a stumbling debate night.\n\nRashad Asoufy said it was “surprising to see the decline in Biden’s health due to his age.”\n\n“Ideally, I would like him to step down and have someone else be the Democratic ticket,” Asoufy told NBC News. “But if he’s all we have, I would still stick with Biden because the alternative is not really good for this country because it kind of threatens our democracy.”\n\nJennifer Ganem, 59, thinks it is too late for Biden to step aside.\n\n“I think that we need to stay the course at this point of the process,” she said.\n\nWhile Ganem described Biden’s performance as “sad,” she said, “We are voting for that leader, but we also need to remember we’re voting for all the people around our president, somebody who can bring together a good team, and former President Trump did not prove that he could do that.”\n\nOn the other hand, Marsha Brazil, a 71-year-old from Dearborn, is adamant that Biden should not step aside.\n\n“Biden has the experience. Why would you want to — did they want to replace Trump? Look at all the things — he’s a convicted felon,” she said.\n\nBrazil added that “the Democrats need to get together and stick with what they got and try to improve them with what they have instead of trying to replace it. You don’t replace nothing like that.”\n\nBrazil described the debate as “horrible” because “Trump lied when he first opened up his mouth.”\n\n“Biden was trying to tell the truth, but by him being a stutterer and having problem speaking properly, and having a cold, he had a problem delivering his points because he was trying to fact-check Trump on everything,” she added.\n\nBiden addresses NYC’s LGBTQ community a day after poor debate performance\n\nand\n\nUnder the dark cloud of a lackluster debate performance and panic among some Democrats, Biden spoke today at the opening of a visitor center for LGBTQ history in New York City.\n\nBiden addressed several hundred LGBTQ attendees and allies, including singer Elton John, actor Neil Patrick Harris, fashion designer Michael Kors and “RuPaul’s Drag Race” star Courtney Act, at the opening of the Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center to commemorate Pride Month.\n\n“Today, I’m proud to unveil a new visitor center for Stonewall National Monument, the first ever LGBTQ+ visitor center in the national parks of America,” Biden said. “It matters.

Michelle Grisham and Nevada Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen. The keynote speaker was Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nBiden’s facing pressure to drop out.

That was obvious,\" Castro told host Ryan Nobles on NBC News' \"Meet the Press NOW.\" \"After last night, it became less likely that he will win. Now it’s up to him to rebuild that competence to make it more likely.\"\n\nCastro said he was \"never convinced\" that Biden was the strongest candidate for the 2024 nomination, but he said that at each juncture over the past two years, the chance to consider an alternative to Biden was \"shut down.\"\n\nCastro added that the optics are also a concern, saying, \"We’ve come to a point where this is a political liability that is is so difficult to overcome.\"\n\nSupreme Court set to rule Monday on Trump presidential immunity claims in federal election interference case\n\nThe Supreme Court is set to rule Monday on whether former President Donald Trump has sweeping presidential immunity that would shield him from prosecution for trying to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nThe justices have left the high-profile case for their final decision day before summer break.

Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., during the Democratic primaries earlier that year.\n\nPennsylvania Republican suggests the 25th Amendment is 'worth consideration'\n\nPennsylvania’s Republican Senate nominee Dave McCormick thinks there is a “possibility our Commander-in-Chief is not up to the job” — and suggested the 25th Amendment, which allows the vice president and Cabinet members to write a letter to Congress declaring the president is not fit to serve, is “worth consideration.”\n\nMcCormick, sitting next to former Attorney General Bill Barr at his \"America’s Future Tour: Safer Communities for Pennsylvania\" event just north of Pittsburgh, described this as a “sad and scary thing to say.”\n\nThe McCormick campaign later released a video titled “Bob Casey Said Over And Over That Biden Was Fit To Be President. He Was Lying.” The video shows McCormick’s opponent, incumbent Sen. Bob Casey, defending Biden and his record, as well as Biden complimenting Casey and calling him a “close friend.”\n\nWhen asked for a response, the Casey campaign referred NBC News to a comment given to PoliticsPA.com that reads, “I’m fighting for Pennsylvania against an opponent who sells out working people to enrich himself, invested in Chinese military companies, and cheered when Roe v.

I think she’d be a good president,” said Tolbert.\n\n“I think she — the people can understand her better because she can get up there and talk,” Tolbert added.\n\nTolbert, an African American originally from Alabama born to sharecroppers, said he worries what Republicans retaking the White House will mean for Black people and people of color.\n\n“If we get a Republican in ... it’s going to be bad for people of color,” Tolbert said.\n\nTolbert was also troubled by Trump.\n\n“The lies that he was telling, what he had done when he was president of the United States, none of that was true. Everything he said,” Tolbert said.\n\nDespite acknowledging Biden wasn’t an effective communicator last night, Tolbert was not panicking, even as he noted he was \"worried\" about Biden's health and his ability to make it through another four-year term.\n\n“He knows what he is doing. He’s very quiet about what he does,” said Tolbert. “He was not trying to be a superstar.\"\n\nNew York Times editorial board calls on Biden to drop out\n\nThe New York Times editorial board published a bombshell op-ed today calling on Biden to leave the race, joining the rising chorus of concerned politicians and pundits.\n\n\"The clearest path for Democrats to defeat a candidate defined by his lies is to deal truthfully with the American public: acknowledge that Mr. Biden can’t continue his race, and create a process to select someone more capable to stand in his place to defeat Mr. Trump in November,\" the editorial board wrote.\n\nThe op-ed acknowledged that ending his campaign would \"be against all of Mr. Biden’s personal and political instincts.\"\n\nThe piece highlighted that it was Biden himself who challenged Trump to the debate.\n\n\"The truth Mr. Biden needs to confront now is that he failed his own test,\" the board wrote.\n\nDuring a conversation with CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin at the Aspen Ideas Festival, venture capitalist Peter Thiel said he would vote for former President Donald Trump in the 2024 election.

Staffers working with several of those campaigns did not return requests for comment on the debate. And a few candidates did not directly answer questions about whether Biden should continue as the party’s presidential nominee.\n\n“I focus on my race. I’m not a pundit,” Sen.

They love each other.\"\n\nAt the end of his remarks, Biden introduced Elton John.\n\nDebate performance threatens to overshadow Biden's NYC event with LGBTQ voters\n\nBiden is attending the opening ceremony for the Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center in New York City, but several LGBTQ attendees suggested that last night's debate performance could overshadow the festivities.\n\nScott Dewey, an account executive at software company SAP — one of the center’s sponsors — called last night’s debate “humiliating.”\n\n“I felt so bad for Biden, but then at the same time, I was thinking, ‘Are they doing this so early, are the Democrats trying to sabotage him?’” Dewey, a gay man, told NBC News.\n\n“I mean, what the hell? It was a disgrace,” Dewey added. “He’s too old and he absolutely confirmed that last night.\"\n\nBiden campaign launches digital ad saying Trump 'only cares about himself'\n\nand\n\nThe Biden campaign is putting out a paid digital campaign following last night's debate, that uses clips from Trump's debate remarks to paint the former president as a self-serving candidate.\n\nThe 29-second ad includes snippets of Trump's comments at the debate lectern last night while discussing topics like abortion, the job market and the Capitol riot, alongside short captions from the Biden campaign that describe the former president as a candidate who doesn’t care about veterans, democracy, Black families or reproductive rights.\n\n“Donald Trump only cares about himself,\" the ad says. \"And if he wins, he’ll only help himself. Because he doesn’t care about you.\"\n\nTrump kicks off first post-debate rally by mocking Biden\n\nKicking off his first-post debate remarks at a rally in Virginia, Trump mocked Biden's performance and said the president \"didn't know what the hell he was doing.\"\n\n\"As you saw on televison last night we had a big victory against a man who is trying to destroy our country,\" Trump said. \"Despite the fact that crooked Joe Biden spent the entire week at Camp David resting, working, studying — he studied so hard he didn't know what the hell he was doing.\"\n\n\"It's not his age, it's his competence,\" the former president added. \"He's not respected anywhere in the world.\"\n\n'He’s still on message': Georgia Democrat looks to Biden's positives\n\nReporting from Marietta, Ga.\n\nPaula Billups, a registered Democrat from Marietta, said that while she is disappointed in Biden’s performance last night overall, she is “still very hopeful” that he can be re-elected this November.\n\n“He’s still on message,” Billups, 60, said of Biden, adding that she didn’t think the president “communicated the message as well as he could have last night.”\n\nHer lackluster review of his Thursday night performance, however, will not dissuade her from casting her ballot for Biden again in November.\n\n“I know a lot of people are discussing whether he should step down. No, he should not step down. He has a great team to support him,” she said, noting that Trump is only a few years younger.\n\nBillups, a professor of business administration at a local university, was also confused by Trump’s onstage comment about migrants taking “Black jobs.”\n\n“He made it seem to imply that maybe it was lower-level jobs, which that’s just not the case. You know, we hold jobs at all levels, but I’m not sure what he meant by that,” she explained.\n\nBiden supporter impressed with North Carolina rally: 'I would have loved to have seen that person at a debate last night'\n\nand\n\nAs Democrats continue to voice concerns about Biden's performance following the Thursday night debate, Biden's energized speech on Friday provided a stark contrast for Dannie Montgomery, a Biden supporter who attended his North Carolina rally.\n\n“I would have loved to have seen that person at a debate last night,” Montgomery said. \"I would have liked to seen a little bit more fire last night.\"\n\nThroughout the rally Biden made the case as to why he should remain in office and insisted that he could do the job while acknowledging his lackluster performance.\n\n“I know I’m not a young man. I don’t walk as easy as I used to,\" Biden told the crowd. \"I don’t speak as smoothly as I used to. I don’t debate as well as I used to, but I know what I do know — I know how to tell the truth!\"\n\nBiden communications director won't say whether the campaign is changing strategy ahead of Sept. debate\n\nBiden campaign communications director Michael Tyler told reporters on Air Force One there have been no high-level discussions \"whatsoever\" about the president stepping aside.\n\n\"The president said it himself today: You know, I think he didn’t have the best night on the debate stage,\" Tyler said. He roundly rejected any calls for Biden to step aside and said they are still definitely planning for the September debate.\n\nTyler wouldn’t say though if the campaign would change its overall strategy on how Biden will prepare for that one versus last night’s performance.\n\n'What defines a Black job? A job's a job,' Black voters in Georgia react to Trump debate comments\n\nand\n\nTwo Black voters in Georgia said Trump's Thursday night answer referencing \"Black jobs\" in a response about the role immigrants play in the U.S. economy, said it reveals the \"type of person Trump is.\"\n\n“They’re taking Black jobs now and it could be 18, it could be 19 and even 20 million people,” Trump said. “They’re taking Black jobs, and they’re taking Hispanic jobs, and you haven’t seen it yet, but you’re going to see something that’s going to be the worst in our history.”\n\n\"What defines a Black job? A job's a job,\" Ryan Beasley, a 45-year-old undecided voter from Atlanta, told NBC News.\n\nBeasley, a Black resident from Decatur, had always voted for the Democratic Party prior to this election. Asked what he would do if the election was tomorrow, he responded, \"Stay in bed.\"\n\nHe added, \"I think it's time for new leadership; I think it's time for younger leadership.\"\n\nRed Girma, a 24-year-old from Georgia, expressed similar concerns.\n\n\"It just felt like they were referencing, like I don’t want to say it, but like bottom-barrel jobs that are like supposed to be like Black jobs or like Hispanic jobs like,\" Girma said. \"I don’t know what he was trying to get at that.

He added that he’d be open to supporting the Democratic Party if they remove Biden from the ticket in favor of a younger candidate.\n\nAs for Biden’s chances of beating Trump in the general election, Luch remained skeptical because of the president’s age.\n\n“I think you should be alive long enough to see the ramifications of your actions,” Luch said. “We’re doomed.

Joe Biden couldn’t communicate and Donald Trump lied every time he opened his mouth,” said Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minn., who represents a competitive district.\n\nBut when asked if Biden should step aside from the 2024 race, Craig said she’s focused on her district.\n\nPrivately, many Democrats — including some lawmakers — said that they are worried.

U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols had put his sentence on hold as he pursued an appeal of his conviction, which was rejected in May.

Nancy Pelosi said she is a “very big supporter of President Biden.\"\n\n“He got off to a bad start,\" she told reporters. \"I thought he came through OK on the issues later.”\n\nMajor Biden fundraiser says Democrats should 'take a deep breath'\n\nand\n\nAlan Kessler, a Philadelphia-based Biden fundraiser, said today that Democrats should \"take a deep breath and see how things develop in a week or 10 days.\"\n\n\"In the meantime, if people want to have discussions about everything from potentially having somebody else [on the ticket] to how to handle last night, maybe that should happen,\" Kessler said. \"But before people jump off bridges or start a draft movement, let’s take a deep breath and see how things unfold.\"\n\nLongtime Biden ally Rep. James Clyburn says the president had a 'poor performance' during the debate\n\nand\n\nRep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., a longtime Biden ally, told reporters on Capitol Hill today that he thought the president's performance during last night's debate was \"poor.\"\n\nClyburn said that Biden doesn't need to change anything on \"substance,\" but on style, he argued that Biden is \"not a show horse.\"\n\n\"The debate last night had some shortcomings,\" he said, noting that infrastructure was not brought up once even though Biden signed a major bill to rebuild the nation's roads and bridges.\n\n\"We have a workhorse on behalf of the American people. We got a show horse just trying to get him out of office,\" he said.\n\nClyburn was credited with helping propel Biden's 2020 presidential campaign forward after endorsing him before the South Carolina primary.\n\nBiden campaign rakes in $14 million around the first presidential debate\n\nand\n\nThe Biden-Harris campaign raised $14 million on debate day and the morning after, a campaign official told NBC News.\n\nThe official said the hour after the debate — between 11 p.m. and 12 a.m. — was the single best hour of fundraising since the campaign’s launch in April 2023.\n\nSenior Biden adviser says Jan. 6 defendants must be held accountable after Supreme Court decision.\n\nand\n\nA senior Biden adviser said today that \"violent insurrectionists and those who encourage them must be held accountable, but Donald Trump thinks otherwise.\"\n\nThe adviser's comment comes in response to the Supreme Court's decision that sided with a Jan. 6 rioter challenging an obstruction charge.\n\n\"Just last night, Trump again defended January 6 and the insurrectionists who violently assaulted law enforcement officers and tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power,\" the adviser said about the debate. \"Today’s ruling does not change the fundamental truth that Donald Trump will always put himself over our democracy.”\n\nThe June presidential debate, by the numbers\n\nBiden and Trump touched on many topics during last night’s presidential debate, from the economy and inflation to the wars in Ukraine and the Gaza Strip, health care and immigration.\n\nNBC News kept track of how the candidates used their time during the debate. The graphics below show the time dedicated to each topic, along how long the candidate spent on each.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nGood inflation news for the Biden admin lost in debate fallout\n\nThere's good news about inflation this morning. The wonky-sounding personal consumption expenditures index (PCE) for May came in at its slowest growth rate in more than three years. It comes after other recent encouraging inflation data, including from the closely watched consumer price index (CPI).\n\nPCE is also a preferred inflation gauge for the Federal Reserve, which could end up cutting its benchmark interest once or twice this year as price growth slows down. That would be good news for Americans paying credit card bills and those who are priced out of the housing market because of high mortgage rates.\n\nBut what could be seen as a boost for Biden is likely to get lost amid the fallout from his shaky debate performance last night. When pressed on inflation yesterday, Biden incorrectly said he inherited 9% inflation from Trump. CPI hit that level in the middle of 2022, Biden's second year in office. The president also stumbled in demonstrating how the annual rate of CPI growth is now down to 3.3% and is expected to keep cooling.\n\nBiden campaign co-chair says he 'lost on style, but won on substance'\n\nMitch Landrieu, Biden's campaign co-chair, defended Biden's debate performance during an interview with CNN this morning.\n\nAsked about voters' response to the debate, Landrieu said Biden had a \"rough time\" last night. He added, \"The president might have lost a debate on style, but he won it on facts. He won it on decency.\"\n\nMonday will be the final day of Supreme Court rulings\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to issue its final rulings of the session Monday. The decision on Trump's immunity argument in one of his criminal cases remains undecided, meaning it's likely to come Monday.\n\nSupreme Court rules for Jan. 6 rioter challenging obstruction charge\n\nReporting from the Supreme Court\n\nThe Supreme Court today ruled in favor of a former police officer who is seeking to throw out an obstruction charge for joining the Capitol riot Jan. 6, 2021, in a ruling that could benefit Trump.\n\nThe justices on a 6-3 vote handed a win to defendant Joseph Fischer, who is among hundreds of Jan. 6 defendants — including Trump — who have been charged with obstructing an official proceeding over the effort to prevent Congress’ certification of Biden’s election victory.\n\nThe court concluded that the law, enacted in 2002 as part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act after the Enron accounting scandal, was only intended to apply in limited circumstances involving tampering with physical evidence.\n\nRead more about the decision here.\n\nPelosi, asked for reaction to Biden's performance, says 'not right now'\n\nand\n\nAsked to react to Biden's performance at last night's debate, former House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said she \"will have it, but not right now.\"\n\nPelosi, one of the most powerful Democratic elected officials in the nation, made the comments as she stepped into an elevator at the Capitol. She did not specify when she planned to make public comments about the debate.\n\nNBC News' Chuck Todd wrote last night that he was most intrigued to hear from Pelosi and former President Barack Obama. \"They are, arguably, the two most influential Democrats not named Joe Biden right now,\" he wrote, \"and if they went public saying, 'Thank you for your service but it’s time for new blood,' I'm not sure Biden could survive as the nominee.\"\n\nSupreme Court delivers blow to power of federal agencies, overturning 40-year-old precedent\n\nReporting from the Supreme Court\n\nThe Supreme Court today overturned a 40-year-old precedent that has been a target of the right because it is seen as bolstering the power of \"deep state\" bureaucrats.\n\nIn a ruling involving a challenge to a fisheries regulation, the court consigned to history a 1984 ruling called Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council.\n\nIt is the latest in a series of rulings in which the conservative justices have taken aim at the power of federal agencies. The ruling was 6-3 with the conservative justices in the majority and the liberal justices dissenting.\n\nRead more about the decision here.\n\nBiden campaign commits to participating in September presidential debate\n\nand\n\nThe Biden campaign said that the president still plans to participate in the second scheduled presidential debate against Trump.\n\nA Biden aide said all systems are go for the debate and they're committed to it. ABC News is set to host that debate on Sept. 10, less than two months before Election Day.\n\nHillary Clinton reiterates support for Biden post-debate\n\nIn her first public reaction following the debate last night, Hillary Clinton wrote in a post on X that she'll be voting for Biden this November.\n\nTop Democratic fundraisers sound the alarm after Biden’s debate performance\n\nand\n\nMany of the Democratic Party’s top fundraisers are privately sounding the alarm after Biden’s disappointing debate performance against Trump last night.\n\n“Disaster,” said a Biden donor who plans to attend a fundraiser with him tomorrow in the Hamptons.\n\n“This is terrible. Worse than I thought was possible. Everyone I’m speaking with thinks Biden should drop out,” said the person, who was granted anonymity to recount private conversations.\n\nCNBC began hearing from worried Democratic campaign donors and fundraisers less than 20 minutes into the 90-minute debate hosted by CNN.\n\n“Game over,” said a longtime Democratic campaign adviser, who has been raising money for congressional leaders for over a decade and helped raise money for Biden’s 2020 White House bid.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nSupreme Court allows Oregon city policy targeting homeless people\n\nReporting from the Supreme Court\n\nThe Supreme Court today rejected a constitutional challenge to ordinances enacted by a small city in Oregon that punish homeless people for sleeping on public property when they have nowhere else to go.\n\nThe justices ruled in favor of the city of Grants Pass, saying the measures do not run afoul of the Constitution’s Eighth Amendment, which bars cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nRead more about the decision here.\n\nHakeem Jeffries says Biden shouldn't step down\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries responded \"no\" when asked by reporters if he thinks Biden should step down following his debate performance last night.\n\nSupreme Court to begin announcing decisions momentarily\n\nReporting from the Supreme Court\n\nThe Supreme Court is about to begin announcing decisions. They've brought two boxes into the press room — traditionally meaning we could get more than two cases.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson says Biden is 'not up to the job'\n\nand\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., addressing reporters on Capitol Hill this morning, said he believes the presidential debate showed that Biden is not fit for the presidency.\n\n\"Everyone can see the objective fact that we have been discussing here for a long, long time, that President Biden is not up to the job,\" Johnson said.\n\nTrump has also drawn criticism for a series of falsehoods and exaggerations during the CNN presidential debate. Johnson praised Trump's performance, saying the presumptive GOP nominee \"won on every metric of measurement, I think, on the issues, on his stamina, on his temperament.\"\n\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer defends Biden while avoiding mention of his debate performance\n\nand\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, issued a post-debate statement through her political organization this morning that praised Biden without remarking at all on his performance in last night's debate.\n\n\"For hardworking people in Michigan and across the country, this election is about which candidate can do the most to make life easier for them and their families, stand up for our rights and freedoms, and leave a better country for our kids and grandkids,\" Whitmer said in the statement. \"On these questions, the difference between Joe Biden and Donald Trump as people, and as presidents, could not be clearer. \"\n\nWhitmer is among the Democrats whose names routinely surface as a potential replacement for Biden on the ballot — and her name was ringing out among panicked party insiders last night after Biden stumbled through a shaky debate with Trump.\n\n\"Joe Biden is running to serve the American people,\" Whitmer said in her statement. \"Donald Trump is running to serve Donald Trump. The difference between Joe Biden's vision for making sure everyone in America has a fair shot and Donald Trump’s dangerous, self-serving plans will only get sharper as we head toward November.\"\n\nAnother Democrat, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, raised eyebrows on X after last night's debate by sharing a photo of her and other statewide officeholders with Whitmer under the message \"Mood. #TeamMichigan.\"\n\n\"I'm proud of our team here in Michigan. And wanted to remind people that the Democratic Party is a whole lot bigger than one moment or one person,\" Benson wrote in a text to NBC News, adding that she was not suggesting that Whitmer enter the presidential race. \"Our team in Michigan is an example of that.\"\n\nSome Democrats start calling for Biden to ‘throw in the towel’ on 2024\n\nSome Democrats began calling for Biden to step aside so the party can nominate another candidate after he stumbled badly in last night’s debate.\n\n“This was like a champion boxer who gets in the ring past his prime and needs his corner to throw in the towel,” said a Democratic lawmaker, adding that he meant Biden should exit the race.\n\nThe options for a switch are limited: If the president doesn’t choose to leave of his own volition, there would have to be a revolt among Democratic National Convention delegates, the vast majority of whom were elected on their pledges to nominate Biden. But that’s what some Democrats were thinking about last night.\n\nIt’s “time to talk about an open convention and a new Democratic nominee,” said a second Democratic lawmaker who has been a solid Biden supporter.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nBiden campaign defiant against calls for him to drop out of race\n\nand\n\nBiden's campaign is defiantly pushing back against calls for the president to drop out of the race.\n\nA source familiar with the campaign’s thinking argued that Biden has been counted out by all the same pundits and reporters before, and the anonymous Democrats doubting him are anonymous because the party is behind him 100% (When pressed about why some of the doubters were going on the record, the source countered that they were TV pundits).\n\n“It’s a long, long campaign, and one debate, as we saw in 2012 with Obama, will not decide the results,” the source said.\n\nAnother source familiar with the campaign’s thinking flatly denied Biden would leave the race, saying, “Of course not.”\n\nThat source argued that a fair number of polls show the debate “as a wash” and that people hated Trump’s Jan. 6 lines and refusal to accept election results.\n\nStill, one former administration official acknowledged that attention may shift to someone else.\n\n“One thing I think this does is underscore the importance of Vice President Harris and her role in carrying her weight, and then some, on this ticket,” the source said. “It’s all eyes on Harris — and the next big media moment: Trump’s VP selection.”\n\nBiden stopped by a campaign-sponsored viewing party in Atlanta following his debate with Trump. He later went to collect an order from a Waffle House. At both stops, he accused Trump of lying during the debate.\n\nSen. John Fetterman says he refuses to join 'Democratic vultures on Biden's shoulder'\n\nSen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., suggested in a post on X this morning that he doesn't agree with calls by some Democrats to find an alternative to Biden after his debate performance.\n\n\"I refuse to join the Democratic vultures on Biden’s shoulder after the debate,\" Fetterman said. \"No one knows more than me that a rough debate is not the sum total of the person and their record.\"\n\nFetterman had a similarly poor debate performance in October 2022 against Republican Senate candidate Mehmet Oz, in part because Fetterman was still recovering from his stroke. Ultimately, Fetterman won the race in the midterm election.\n\nGov. Josh Shapiro admits Biden 'had a bad debate night,' but stresses the president is 'up to the job'\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a possible future Democratic presidential candidate, admitted in an interview this morning that Biden didn't do well last night, but stressed that Democrats should \"stop worrying.\"\n\n\"Look, I think Joe Biden had a bad debate night, but it doesn’t change the fact that Donald Trump was a bad president — a bad president who ripped away our freedoms, a bad president who drove our economy into the ditch, a bad president who exacerbated the problems of climate change, and a guy who stood on the stage last night and not only lied about his past, but lied about the kinds of things he’s proposing for the future,\" Shapiro said on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\"\n\n\"That is what I took away from this debate,\" he continued. \"That’s what I saw, and I think we still have a clear contrast in this race. Nothing about the debate changed that last night.\"\n\nShapiro, a top surrogate for Biden as a member of the campaign's national advisory board, said that Democrats should stop worrying about Biden's candidacy and focus on defeating Trump.\n\n\"I’ve had the opportunity to work closely with both the former president and President Biden, and you know what I can tell you, Joe Biden is up to the job,\" he said.\n\nPressed multiple times to address Democrats' alarm over Biden's performance, Shapiro said he had acknowledged several times that Biden had a bad debate night.\n\n\"He’s got a burden on him to show people that he is still able to move forward in these debates and in prosecuting the case against Donald Trump,\" Shapiro said. \"I believe he can do that.\"\n\nWhat are the candidates doing today?\n\nand\n\nBiden and Trump are back on the trail today after the first debate of the 2024 cycle. Trump will deliver remarks at an event in Chesapeake, Virginia, at around 3 p.m., while Biden and first lady Jill Biden will attend a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, at noon.\n\nAfter the rally, Biden and the first lady will head to New York for two other events. In the afternoon, the Bidens are scheduled to deliver remarks at the Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center grand opening ceremony in Manhattan.\n\nLater in the evening, they’re both expected to participate in a campaign reception in New York City.\n\nDNC billboard to highlight Trump's reported 'losers' and 'suckers' remarks about service members ahead of his Virginia rally\n\nThe Democratic National Committee is reminding Virginia voters of Trump’s past comments about U.S. service members, as the presumptive Republican nominee holds a campaign rally in Chesapeake, an area home to one of the largest U.S. military populations.\n\nA montage of news reports from Trump’s presidency on the topic will be played on a mobile billboard driving around the Hampton Roads area today ahead of the rally, NBC News has learned.\n\nMany of the news reports featured on the mobile billboard center on the September 2020 Atlantic article written by Jeffrey Goldberg, titled, “Trump: Americans who died in the war are ‘Losers’ and ‘Suckers’” — a topic that came up in last night’s debate.\n\n“As Donald Trump heads to Virginia today, voters will remember the disrespect and pain he inflicted on service members and their families as he callously mocked them while serving as commander in chief,” DNC spokesperson Tracy King told NBC News. “President Biden is the only candidate in this election who fights for our service members and honors their sacrifice. Virginians will head to the polls this November remembering how Donald Trump disrespected our heroes, while President Biden fights for them.”\n\nAfter Biden brought up the reported comments during the debate, Trump responded, \"The losers and suckers story that he made up is a total lie on the military, it’s a disgrace. They made it up. It was in a third-rate magazine that’s failing, like many of these magazines. He made that up.”\n\nTrump will be joined by Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin at today’s rally — the first time the two will share a stage.\n\nIn response to the candidate’s performance last night, Youngkin posted on X, “Could it be any clearer? Strength versus weakness. That’s why Virginia is in play. See you in Chesapeake tomorrow, Mr. President!”\n\n‘Babbling’ and ‘hoarse’: Biden’s debate performance sends Democrats into a panic\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nBiden, 81, was supposed to put the nation’s mind at ease over his physical and mental capacity with his debate showing last night.\n\nBut from the onset of the debate, he seemingly struggled even to talk, mostly summoning a weak, raspy voice. In the opening minutes, the president repeatedly tripped over his words, misspoke and lost his train of thought.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nDemocrats are talking about replacing Biden. That wouldn’t be so easy.\n\nand\n\nParty rules make it almost impossible to replace nominees without their consent, let alone smoothly replace them with someone else. And doing so would amount to party insiders overturning the results of primaries when Democratic voters overwhelmingly to nominate Biden. He won almost 99% of all delegates.\n\nAnd at the moment, there is no known, serious effort to push Biden off the top of the ticket.\n\nStill, the Democratic National Committee’s charter does make some provisions in case the party’s nominee is incapacitated or opts to step aside, and an anti-Biden coup at the convention is theoretically possible, if highly unlikely. So how would it work?\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nDebate takeaways: Biden confirms some voter fears as Trump leans into grievances\n\nBiden failed to mitigate his biggest liability in his re-election bid at the CNN debate last night, while Trump doubled down on his grievances and skipped past opportunities to cover his own vulnerabilities.\n\nBiden’s biggest weakness — voter concerns about his age and sharpness, according to polls — was on display throughout the more than 90-minute debate as he struggled through answers and failed to deliver the energetic performance allies believe he needed. And Trump had no new answers for voters about the issues on which he’s weakest, including his felony conviction, his role in overturning Roe v. Wade and his actions on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThe first showdown between Biden, 81, and Trump, 78, in 2024 comes early in the election year, giving voters an opportunity to see the president and his challenger side by side. Here’s what they saw — and what it means for the campaign.\n\nRead the full story here."
