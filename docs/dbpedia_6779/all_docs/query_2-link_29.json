        "text": "(1) The second presidential debate, a \"town hall\" style format, scheduled for October 15, 2020 was cancelled on October 9, 2020. The Commission on Presidential Debates modified the format of this debate stating that it would be held \"virtually\" because of concerns about public health due to President Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis. The President then chose not to participate in this modified format. Both Donald Trump and Joe Biden held \"town-hall\" events in lieu of the debate. These event transcripts are below:\n\nPresident Trump: Remarks in a Town Hall Meeting with Savannah Guthrie of NBC News at the Perez Art Museum in Miami, Florida\n\nFormer Vice President Biden: Remarks in a Town Hall Meeting with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania"
