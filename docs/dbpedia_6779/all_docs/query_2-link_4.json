But I think that he is going to continue to fight on for the values, ideals, and issues this campaign is about.\"[4]\n\nFebruary 7 – After the second inauguration of George W. Bush, in an interview with Fox News Sunday, Vice President Dick Cheney is asked whether he will seek the Republican nomination for the presidency in 2008.
