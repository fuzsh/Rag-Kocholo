        "text": "DECATUR, Ga. - Cynthia McKinney, the fiery Georgia congresswoman known for her conspiracy theories about the Sept. 11 attacks and the scuffle she had earlier this year with a U.S. Capitol police officer, lost a runoff election Tuesday for her district's Democratic nomination.\n\nAttorney Hank Johnson, a former county commissioner, soundly defeated McKinney by more than 12,000 votes, winning 59 percent of the total vote. More than 70,000 votes were cast -- 9,000 more than in the primary three weeks ago.\n\nJohnson, a political unknown three weeks ago, strode into the ballroom of his campaign party to shouts of, \"Hank! Hank! Hank!\"\n\n\"I'm here to serve you,\" Johnson told cheering supporters. \"I'm going to make you proud. Thanks for giving me the opportunity to serve you.\"\n\nMeanwhile, there was no sign of McKinney at her campaign celebration for most of the night. Her campaign manager, John Evans, blamed the loss on the ABC -- Anybody But Cynthia -- strategy.\n\n\"It's over,\" he said shortly after 11 p.m. \"Folks just beat us. They got a lot of white votes, a lot of Republican votes and they took some of our votes where we have been stable.\"\n\nEvans also pointed to low voter turnout and the March scuffle between McKinney and a Capitol Hill police officer as reasons for her defeat.\n\nLeading up to the July 18 primary, McKinney had expected an easy return to Congress this year. Instead, she was upset for the second time in the past three primary elections. Four years ago, McKinney lost to political newcomer Denise Majette, who was backed by an organized, well-funded Republican effort. McKinney returned to Congress in 2004 after Majette left the seat to run for the Senate.\n\nMcKinney was hoping the core of her constituency -- centralized in south DeKalb County, home to one of the country's most affluent black populations -- would mobilize this time to send her to a seventh term in Congress.\n\nAt White Oak Hills Baptist Church in Stone Mountain, the precinct where McKinney votes, Tony Wilson cast a ballot for her with mixed feelings.\n\n\"She's a radical, but she's ours,\" said Wilson, a 36-year-old software developer.\n\nStill, Wilson said, McKinney's public image has jeopardized her political future.\n\n\"She makes us look bad,\" he said.\n\nThe polarizing politician has a reputation for bringing out her base, although it has not always led her to victory. In 2002, McKinney was ousted from Congress despite getting 85 percent of the black vote."
