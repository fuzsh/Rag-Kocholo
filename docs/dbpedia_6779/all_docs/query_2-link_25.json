        "text": "Mnemonic benefits for emotional (vs. neutral) events are well-documented in young adults (reviewed by Holland & Kensinger, 2010; Buchanan, 2007). Emotional experiences are more likely to be remembered than neutral ones, and emotional events are often recalled more vividly (Talarico, LaBar, & Rubin, 2004). Yet even highly emotional information is not immune to reconstructive memory inconsistencies over time (e.g., Schmolck, Buffalo & Squire, 2000; McCloskey, Wible, & Cohen, 1988), despite individuals’ confidence in these memories (e.g., Neisser & Harsch, 1992; Talarico & Rubin, 2003; 2007).\n\nAlthough several aspects of an event, including its emotional intensity (Talarico et al., 2004) or personal importance (Muscatell, Addis, & Kensinger, 2010), can influence how consistently or accurately it is recalled, an event’s valence (i.e., how negatively or positively it is perceived) may have an especially important relation to memory across the adult lifespan. For example, event valence has been associated with young adults’ memory consistency, perhaps by affecting the type of information processing that is invoked at the time of encoding (reviewed by Kensinger, 2009). The “affect-as-information” approach hypothesizes that emotions provide critical information about one’s environment and guide perception and attention. In particular, negative emotions signal that something in the present environment requires one’s attention and therefore invokes greater detail-oriented and analytical processing. On the other hand, positive emotions signal a benign environment and therefore allow for a greater reliance on heuristics and schemas (e.g., Clore et al., 2001; Clore & Storbeck, 2006; see also Levine & Pizarro, 2004).\n\nIt follows from the affect-as-information approach that if negative events are processed deeply and receive more attention at and after their occurrence, such information should be especially well-remembered at retrieval. Indeed, young adults demonstrate more accurate memory for stimuli that elicit negative emotion (e.g., Kensinger & Schacter, 2006a) or for stimuli presented while in a negative mood (Storbeck & Clore, 2005; Storbeck & Clore, 2011). These benefits also extend to autobiographical memory: Individuals who felt negative (vs. positive) about the outcome of the O.J. Simpson trial were less likely to endorse false statements about the trial (Levine & Bluck, 2004), and individuals who felt negative (vs. positive) about the outcome of a sporting event had more consistent memories for the details of the game (Kensinger & Schacter, 2006b; but see Breslin & Safer, 2011, for evidence of greater memory accuracy in sports fans who felt positive about the outcome of a game). For younger adults, an event’s valence is also linked to differences in memory confidence, with positive emotion being associated with overconfidence in accuracy (Kensinger & Schacter, 2006b).\n\nAlthough age does not appear to affect emotional memory enhancements on either laboratory (e.g., Denburg et al., 2003; Otani et al., 2007) or autobiographical (Comblain, D’Argembeau, & Van der Linden, 2005; St. Jacques & Levine, 2007) memory tasks, it is unclear whether older adults show the greatest mnemonic benefits for negative information in the same way that young adults do. There is some evidence that the memory boost associated with negative information occurs on the later end of the adult lifespan, in line with the affect-as-information approach (see Kensinger, 2008, for a review). Yet these laboratory findings have not been extended into the domain of autobiographical events; only one autobiographical memory study can potentially shed light on how these laboratory findings translate to real-life events across the lifespan. Bohn and Berntsen (2007) asked individuals to retrospectively rate their emotions and recall details regarding the fall of the Berlin Wall. In line with the suggestion that negative emotion might be linked to enhanced memory for details, those individuals who reported feeling negative (vs. positive) about the event had the highest memory accuracy. The sample from Bohn and Berntsen (2007) ranged from 29 to 82 years; although the authors did not consider age in their analyses, the outcome suggests that the mnemonic benefit associated with negative emotion might extend throughout the lifespan.\n\nAlthough there is evidence that older adults demonstrate the greatest mnemonic benefit for negative (vs. positive) information, this claim is potentially contentious in light of the literature on emotional processing in aging. Socio-emotional selectivity theory predicts that when time is perceived as limited, as in aging, emotion regulation goals (i.e., diminishing negative affect) become dominant (Carstensen, Isaacowitz, & Charles, 1999). As such, older (vs. younger) adults may place a greater emphasis on positively-valenced information, for example in attention and memory (reviewed by Mather, 2006). Indeed, there are age-related changes in how quickly older adults forget negative events (Berntsen & Rubin, 2002) and in the proportion of negative versus positive images they recognize or recall (Charles, Mather, & Cartsensen, 2003).\n\nThus far, the reviewed literature has concerned individuals on either end of the adult lifespan. Far less work has considered the role of emotional valence in memory for middle-aged adults, and the extant data yield no consensus. One laboratory study found an overall benefit for negative stimuli across the adult lifespan (Denburg et al., 2003), whereas another found evidence for a shift toward mnemonic benefits for positive stimuli in middle age (Carstensen & Mikels, 2005). Given that autobiographical events are inherently more emotional and personally meaningful than traditional laboratory stimuli (e.g., Cabeza et al., 2004), investigating memory for such events may further elucidate the role of emotional valence on memory in middle age.\n\nThe goal of the present study was to examine the relation between emotional valence and memory across the adult lifespan. We sought to distinguish between two alternatives: The mnemonic benefits associated with negative emotion that are evident in younger adults could be unaffected by age (i.e., in line with the affect-as-information approach), or adult development could result in greater mnemonic benefits of positive emotion (i.e., in line with socio-emotional selectivity theory). We probed adults’ memories for the details of a real-life, emotional event: the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election. Political elections serve as a unique opportunity to examine how adults of all ages remember a publically and personally significant event whose outcome could either be viewed as highly positive or highly negative (e.g., Levine & Bluck, 1997)1. By examining an event that could be defined as negative or positive depending on individual preferences, extraneous variables such as amount of media coverage and the duration of the event are controlled (as in Bohn & Berntsen, 2007; Breslin & Safer, 2011; Kensinger & Schacter, 2006b; Levine & Bluck, 2004).\n\nWe assessed the link between valence and both memory quantity (the number of details reported about the election shortly after its outcome and again after a six-month delay) and memory consistency (the degree of overlap between the reported details across the six-month delay). A final exploratory goal was to examine the relation among aging, perceived event valence, and memory confidence.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe present study was the first to investigate the links between valence, age, and autobiographical memory—measured by both the quantity of details and consistency of those details—across the adult lifespan. Our analyses revealed a dissociation between the relation of valence with the quantity versus consistency of recalled information. Individuals who felt negative about the outcome of the election reported a lower quantity of information both immediately after the election and following a 6-month delay than those who felt positive, yet a greater proportion of the information was recalled consistently across the delay by those who felt negative.\n\nThe relation between valence and the quantity and consistency of information recalled was relatively well-preserved across the lifespan, and remained even when statistically controlling for emotional intensity ratings in the regression models. Individuals of all ages reported more information when they viewed the outcome of the election as positive. Even though aging was associated with a decline in overall memory consistency, the link between valence and memory consistency was stable across the lifespan: Feeling negative about the outcome of the election was associated with greater mnemonic consistency than feeling positive, and this effect of increasing positivity did not interact with increasing age. Even though older adults sometimes demonstrate enhanced attention toward and memory for positive information (Kennedy, Mather, & Carstensen, 2004; Mather, 2006), the present data suggest that having a positive focus is not associated with the consistent retention of event details (see Murphy & Isaacowitz, 2008; Kensinger, 2008, for similar discussion).\n\nThese results are consistent with the affect-as-information framework (Clore et al., 2001; Clore & Storbeck, 2006) suggesting that negative emotion is associated with mnemonic benefits due to the induction of a more analytical mode of information processing (see Kensinger, 2009) and are also largely consistent with prior investigations of the relation between valence and memory for public events (Bohn & Berntsen, 2007; Kensinger & Schacter, 2006; Levine & Bluck, 2004). Interestingly, a more recent study found that individuals who felt positive about the outcome of a sporting event had more accurate event memory than those who felt negative, possibly because sports fans were recruited from locations where frequent reminders of their team’s loss were unlikely to be present and negative affect could presumably fade (Breslin & Safer, 2011), as it often does relative to positive affect related to autobiographical memories (i.e., the fading affect bias; e.g., Walker & Skowronski, 2009). Indeed, the continued presence of Barack Obama in the media during the delay between the two survey time points may have influenced post-election rehearsal and elaboration (see also Hirst et al., 2009), perhaps preventing affect from fading in individuals who felt negative about the outcome of the election and adding to the mnemonic benefits associated with feeling negative at the time of encoding. It is also possible that because individuals who felt negative about the election reported fewer details overall, it was relatively easier for them to recall the details they did report consistently over time.\n\nIt should be acknowledged that the age and valence groups showed some differences on reported rehearsal variables related to the election shortly after it occurred. Regardless of age, individuals who found the election more positive and emotionally intense also found it more personally important and reported greater amounts of rehearsal4. In addition, increasing age was related to increases in ratings of personal importance and rehearsal. The finding that increasing age and positivity was associated with lower consistency over time despite greater rehearsal is somewhat surprising given that rehearsal has been associated with greater consistency (e.g., Conway et al., 2009; Schmolck et al., 2000) and accuracy (Breslin & Safer, 2011). This additional rehearsal in the positive group may have led to underestimating the relation between valence and memory consistency; if rehearsal time were equated (and positive events did not receive added rehearsal), negative valence may have an even greater advantage over positive valence. However, it is also plausible that new information learned via media coverage after the election and/or misinformation introduced through conversations about the election interfered with memory for details reported at Time 1, contributing to the valence differences seen here.\n\nThe present results add to the literature demonstrating discord between memory consistency and confidence (e.g., Kensinger & Schacter, 2006b; Talarico & Rubin, 2003; 2007). Increasing age was associated with increases in confidence ratings despite lower levels of consistency with age; this finding might fit with others’ suggestions that older adults are more likely than younger adults to overestimate memory confidence even when misremembering (Shing et al., 2009). Similarly, increasing intensity ratings were associated with increases in both current and prospective confidence ratings made 6-months following the election, a finding that lends further support to findings that emotionally intense events are characterized by greater subjective confidence in memory regardless of objective mnemonic benefits (Talarico & Rubin, 2003; 2007).\n\nAdditionally, individuals who felt positive about the outcome of the election demonstrated greater prospective confidence ratings, despite their lower levels of memory consistency when compared to individuals who felt negative about the election outcome. This inverse relation between prospective memory confidence and memory consistency is in line with prior research that has demonstrated overconfidence in memory quality when individuals perceive information as positive (Levine & Bluck, 1997; Kensinger & Schacter, 2006b). Positive valence may induce more lenient criteria for deciding the accuracy of information (Levine & Bluck, 1997), leaving open the possibility that positive valence also induces more lenient criteria when individuals make metamemory judgments about their ability to recall information in the future. Alternatively, or in addition to this possibility, individuals who felt positive about the outcome of the election may have been more confident in their ability to accurately recall the election details in the future because they based their predictions on the relatively greater quantity of information that they reported compared to individuals who felt negative or because they reported more frequent rehearsal via attention to media coverage shortly after the election (see Hirst et al., 2009).\n\nPractical Applications\n\nAdults of all ages try to learn and retain information while experiencing strong emotions. We listen to a doctor’s orders while upset about a diagnosis or while elated that a serious illness is in remission. We attend classes and meetings while under stress, and we try to remember every moment of a long-awaited celebration. The present results extend our understanding of emotional valence’s effects on young, middle-aged, and older adults’ memory beyond the laboratory to these types of real-life, dynamic events. The results emphasize the need to ensure that individuals who feel strongly positive about an experience will be able to retain the details consistently over time. Although prior studies have emphasized that negative emotion can sometimes be associated with more memory distortions (e.g., Brainerd et al., 2008), the present results emphasize that in some situations – such as when trying to remember event-related details – it may be those who feel most positively about the event who are at greatest risk for remembering information in an inconsistent manner over time.\n\nMore work that bridges the emotional autobiographical memory and lifespan developmental perspectives is critical, as is work that further extends findings like the ones presented here into the clinical domain. Although terms like “memory inconsistency” tend to have a negative connotation, the ability to flexibly update memory based on new information and emotions can be quite functional (akin to “map updating”; Levine, Lench, & Safer, 2009) and may allow for the regulation of past emotions and higher levels of well-being. One implication of the present findings may be that events that are perceived as negative are less amenable to such flexible updating and regulation (see Novak & Mather, 2009). For individuals who are susceptible to clinical disorders like depression, a lack of flexibility may lead to increased rumination of negative details, which can in turn contribute to and sustain negative mood states. Applying research designs like the one used in the present experiment to clinical populations may elucidate the contributions of emotional valence and memory to affective disorders and shed light on possible therapeutic interventions."
