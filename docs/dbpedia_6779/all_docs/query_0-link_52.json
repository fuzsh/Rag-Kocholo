It wasn’t, because the Republican Party targeted for disfranchisement the black vote – such that, across the country, one million black people went to the polls and voted in 2000, and guess what? Their votes were not even counted. What kind of an election is it when your votes aren’t even counted?\n\n[...]\n\nInterviewer: If you had to choose between Barack Obama and John McCain, who would you choose?"
