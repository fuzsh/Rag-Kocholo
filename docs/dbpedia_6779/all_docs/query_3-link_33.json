        "text": "STONE MOUNTAIN, Ga. - Four years ago, U.S. Rep. Cynthia McKinney was unseated after 10 years in Congress by a little-known political newcomer from within her own party who simply campaigned on the premise that she wouldn't embarrass constituents as she claimed Ms. McKinney did.\n\nThe primary-election ouster of Georgia's first black congresswoman by Denise Majette came after some remarks by Ms. McKinney drew national attention, including accusing former Vice President Al Gore of having a \"low Negro tolerance level\" and questioning the Bush administration's advance knowledge of the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nMs. McKinney is raising eyebrows again in an election year, this time for a recent scuffle with a Capitol Hill police officer.\n\nHer main challenger in the primary, Hank Johnson, a DeKalb County commissioner, has said that voters should hold Ms. McKinney accountable for what he called \"her continued pattern of irresponsible and reckless behavior.\"\n\nWhile that sounds familiar, voters in Ms. McKinney's suburban Atlanta district might not be too quick to remove her from office this time around.\n\nShe appears to enjoy wide support in her district, which includes most of DeKalb County and a small portion of Gwinnett County - an area with one of the highest rates of black affluence in the country.\n\n\"We tell the story about our people,\" Ms. McKinney recently told an applauding crowd, sweltering under a tent at the Tupac Amaru Shakur Center for the Arts in Stone Mountain, in the heart of her district. \"Thank you for supporting this effort to get the truth out to our people.\"\n\nOn that Saturday, Ms. McKinney was host for 300 of her constituents at the \"Hip-Hop Power Shop,\" where panelists addressed the war in Iraq, Hurricane Katrina and the unsolved death of slain rapper Tupac Shakur.\n\nFatimah Thomas, a 54-year-old Lithonia mother, listened in on a panel discussing Ms. McKinney's legislation that would establish a \"Tupac Amaru Shakur Records Collection\" at the National Archives that would give the public access to all government records in conjunction with any investigation into Mr. Shakur's life and death.\n\n\"She's one of the few that speaks truth to power. She is not afraid,\" said Ms. Thomas, an accounting specialist who helped with Ms. McKinney's campaign in 2004. \"She's strong. To me, she's one of the few soldiers that are left.\"\n\nHer support in her predominantly Democratic district might have been bolstered by her March scuffle with a police officer, with whom Ms. McKinney argued when he did not recognize her as she entered a House office building in Washington.\n\nPolice said Ms. McKinney struck the officer as he tried to stop her. She said she was defending herself after the officer \"inappropriately touched\" her.\n\nInitially, Ms. McKinney repeatedly blamed racial profiling for what happened before refusing interviews during a federal grand jury investigation into the incident. As it turned out, the grand jury refused to indict her of any criminal charges, and the Fraternal Order of Police has since called on the House ethics committee to review Ms. McKinney's conduct.\n\nTo many of her supporters, Ms. McKinney is seen as a champion of controversial causes on a national and international stage.\n\nMr. Johnson, one of her opponents, said she spends perhaps too much time fighting for issues outside her district. His campaign slogan is \"Taking Care of Home.\"\n\n\"I want to make decisions based on my conscience, not the winds of popularity,\" he said. \"Our congressperson should be a partner in attracting clean, high-tech jobs and industry.\""
