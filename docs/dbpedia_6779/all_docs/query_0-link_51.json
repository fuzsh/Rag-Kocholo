        "text": "There currently exists no electoral political option for the vast majority who want progressive societal change. The two dominant parties maintain themselves as such by constraining candidacies and offices via corporate funding and electoral fraud and collusion â€“ including their oligarchic reign over political debates. This results each presidential election in limited access to substantive debate and, of course, the imposition of the need to select only from one or the other \"lesser of evil.\" However, for those intimately aware of the historic need for the majority to earn their vote through struggle this current arrangement is simply unacceptable. For women, African and Indigenous descendants and the working poor the right to vote has come only through often bloody battles where none who suffered did so to vote for the lesser of evil. They did so believing the vote represented equal participation in and reward from this society. They thought the vote meant power. True realization of their sacrifice can only come through new electoral politics, new parties guided by new philosophies as to how the nation and world should be governed and by whom. Our campaign within the Green Party is designed to build that party. And it is our willingness to support instant run-off voting, removal of finance as a determinant in politics, national healthcare, reduced emphasis on military spending and a guaranteed national income which makes us the logical choice for a campaign and political party deserving the support of that true majority.\n\nI am a 34 year old who has realized that complaining about the system wasn't changing the system. I have been working for over eight years as a Green Party activist to build a democratic alternative to the corporate one-party oligarchy we now have. Only when we start voting for what we want instead of the lesser of two evils will we see a positive shift in candidates elected. Backing the best funded candidate just to be a part of the winning team won't get us: Socialized Medical Care; Net Neutrality; a Balanced Budget every year; Proportional Representation of electors to the electoral college; Federal Judges who will justly interpret the laws without personal bias regarding race, economic status, or religious beliefs; an End to Colonialism once and for all and recreation of the public commons that communities are built upon; Redress the effects Globalization has created in relation to degrading workers' rights, environmental stewardship, immigration, and destruction of community livelihoods; etc. We need to appoint people as heads of agencies who will enforce regulations that serve the people and not the corporations who now control the information you receive and destroy communities through their paramount regard for profits and outrageous executive salaries. I hope the youth and women of this country will seize the power they hold in their votes and use it to change the course of society. Justice is necessary for implementing social, political or economic changes. For more information about my campaign visit http://www.voteswift.org.\n\nI run to improve our basic physical security and to reform politics. Sustainability is a security issue. Communities and regions that are largely self-reliant in a manner not preventing future generations from also being self-reliant are more secure. At all levels of organization we must rapidly learn to live within our means and build sustainably and efficiently for better independence and basic security of water, food and energy. Renewable energy, local organic produce and improved health care delivery are Green issues. Electoral reform is critical to inspire confidence in voting. I work to improve the manner in which we reach decisions as a government and how we select, elect and retain candidates to public office. I support public funding of campaigns, with automatic inclusion into debates for those ballot qualified candidates who, through ballot access, have at least a statistical chance of winning. The current political system does not emphasize deep debate and the solutions that such open discussion brings. I encourage preferential voting, Instant Runoff Voting (I.R.V.) and other improvements to politics. Lobbying is bribery. Peace is important. It's not important to just end the war in Iraq but to grapple with the issue of our national addiction to war. Our nation must take a leadership role in creating the conditions that will lead to diplomatic solutions. Through improved communication and verification the younger generations of today can help put an end to war, if their hearts are in it.

There, she proved to be a courageous voice for the voiceless, speaking truth to power. She authored legislation that would have: eliminated federal subsidies for corporations taking jobs overseas; instituted a national livable wage; repealed the Military Tribunals Act; provided for national forest protection and restoration; eliminated the use of depleted uranium weapons; denied federal assistance to law enforcement agencies violating human rights; allowed 9/11/2001 victims the right to participate in the Victims Compensation Fund and sue those responsible; and impeached Bush, Cheney, and Rice. McKinney successfully extended Agent Orange benefits an additional 25 years; authorized the USDA disparity study that demonstrated USDA discrimination against minority farmers, and directed the Pentagon to study how it handled conscientious objection. Cynthia will implement radical common sense solutions to America's myriad problems. With a view toward the long term, she asks us all to be willing to do some things we've never done before in order to have some things we've never had before. The Power to the People Committee is Cynthia's way of proving what Bobby Kennedy said so long ago: \"Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope; and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring, those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.\""
