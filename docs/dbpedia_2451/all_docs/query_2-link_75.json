        "text": "After being awarded his PhD by MIT, he spent one year as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, and then accepted a position at Bell Labs in New Providence, New Jersey. It was there he developed Shor's algorithm. This development was inspired by Simon's problem, where he first solved the discrete log problem (which relates point-finding on a hypercube to a torus) and,\n\n\"Later that week, I was able to solve the factoring problem as well. There’s a strange relation between discrete log and factoring.\"[17]\n\nDue to their similarity as HSP problems, Shor discovered a related factoring problem (Shor's algorithm) that same week for which he was awarded the Nevanlinna Prize at the 23rd International Congress of Mathematicians in 1998[18][19] and the Gödel Prize in 1999.[20] In 1999, he was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship.[21] In 2017, he received the Dirac Medal of the ICTP and for 2019 the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Basic Sciences.[22]\n\nShor began his MIT position in 2003. Currently, he is the Henry Adams Morss and Henry Adams Morss, Jr. Professor of Applied Mathematics in the Department of Mathematics at MIT.[23] He also is affiliated with CSAIL.[24]\n\nHe received a Distinguished Alumni Award from Caltech in 2007.[15]\n\nOn October 1, 2011, he was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[25][26] He was elected as an ACM Fellow in 2019 \"for contributions to quantum-computing, information theory, and randomized algorithms\".[27] He was elected as a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 2002.[28] In 2020, he was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering for pioneering contributions to quantum computation.[29]\n\nIn an interview published in Nature on October 30, 2020, Shor said that he considers post-quantum cryptography to be a solution to the quantum threat, although a lot of engineering effort is required to switch from vulnerable algorithms.[30]"
