        "text": "Class of 2019-20\n\nHenry Adams Morss and Henry Adams Morss Jr. Professor\n\nApplied Mathematics\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nShor is known for devising Shor’s Algorithm, a quantum algorithm for factoring exponentially faster than the best currently known algorithm running on a classical computer. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Most recently he received the Eric E. Sumner Award for Outstanding Contributions to Communications Technology and the Micius Quantum Prize. Shor will collaborate with faculty and students in the Institute for Quantum Science and Engineering and the colleges of science and agriculture and life sciences."
