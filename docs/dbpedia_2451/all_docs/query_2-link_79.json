        "text": "Sophia Benjamin\n\nPRIMES was amazing because I got to experience the satisfaction and excitement of discovering new math and understanding and proving why it was true. I also got to experience the research process and all the pondering and playing around and making mistakes that you do to finally get results, which just makes getting the results that much more satisfying and exciting. Writing up results was also quite satisfying because we got to formalize our ideas, rigorously prove our results, and share them with the world. It was especially excellent to work with my mentor and my project partners. Our mentor was very knowledgeable and would point us in useful directions and help us understand things, and my project partners and I would build off each others' ideas and collaboratively make progress. We also just had a ton of fun working together and getting to know each other better (and collectively wondering why people kept asking us about guavas).\n\nSophia Benjamin worked with Arushi Mantri and Quinn Perian on the joint project \"On the Wasserstein distance between k-step probability measures on finite graphs\" (mentor Pakawut Jiradilok).\n\nNeil Chowdhury\n\nWhen I started my computational biology project, I expected research to be like solving a math problem: tinker around with the given information and deconstruct it, step by step. However, my PRIMES work shook up my view. In the first weeks, I studied background information and repeated my mentor’s analyses to get accustomed to biological data. When I finally started exploring my research problem, I made little headway and felt discouraged by my fruitless effort. However, I occasionally made small breakthroughs. Perhaps I ran some computation that showed something unexpected, or I found patterns and correlations in the data rather than a Gaussian blob of randomness. I remained enthusiastic thanks to these discoveries and encouragement from my mentors. My mentors were not only patient but also kind and easy to approach. Though research could be hard, I found I enjoyed challenging problems, knowing that great rewards could lie at the end. My PRIMES project taught me many essential research skills. Communicating effectively with my mentors helped me go in the right direction, and organizing my ideas made it easier to track my progress and reach my goals. Also, the involvement of scientists in several different fields taught me about the broad reach of research. My work explored biology, physics, chemistry, programming, and linear algebra, making me realize the usefulness of knowing a wide range of topics. I have learned about my interests and found joy in contributing to the scientific community.\n\nNeil Chowdhury worked on the projects \"A method to recognize universal patterns in genome structure using Hi-C\" (mentor Sameer Abraham), \"Modeling the effect of histone methylation on chromosomal organization in colon cancer cells\" (mentor Dr. Maxim Imakaev), and “Interplay between loop extrusion and compartmentalization during mitosis” (mentor Sameer Abraham).\n\nAndrew Du\n\nResearch in high school is typically something that I’ve thought of as impossible or simply faked, with the stereotype of high school “research” being a kid washing test tubes or doing manual work to contribute. But with PRIMES I’ve come to understand through firsthand experience that real research is indeed difficult, yet also not entirely inaccessible. Under the guidance of my mentor Dave, I found the support needed to navigate my way through the daunting task of reading other papers—written by people clearly more experienced than a high schooler, whose work also felt far above my level—before making our own contributions to the field. With the care put into each individual project, chosen to be accessible for high schoolers without sacrificing meaning, and the absence of tight time limits like summer programs, PRIMES offers the most realistic and enjoyable research experience a high schooler could get.\n\nAndrew Du worked on the project “Quaternion-based analytical inverse dynamics for the human body” (mentor David Darrow).\n\nVishnu Emani\n\nI joined PRIMES in my Freshman year through the Computational Biology track, and right away, I found myself immersed in extremely relevant, exciting, and meaningful research. My mentors were extraordinary and the community and administration of PRIMES did an amazing job supporting me in the process. I especially enjoyed meeting the other students and learning about their research at the annual presentation conference. The skills and community I have gotten from PRIMES will be indispensable for years to come!\n\nVishnu Emani worked on the joint project (with Kevin Zhao) \"The role of protein occupancies in DNA compartmentalization\" (mentors Sameer Abraham and Martin Falk), and on individual projects \"Statistical ranking model for candidate genes in rare genetic disorders\" (mentors Dr. Klaus Schmitz-Abe and Dr. Pankaj Agrawal, Boston Children's Hospital) and “Computational fluid modelling for surgical planning of single ventricle congenital heart defects” (mentors Dr. David Hoganson and Dr. Vijay Govindarajan, Boston Children’s Hospital).\n\nRam Goel\n\nI learned a lot through PRIMES-USA. Everything from the rigorous application, to the reading phase, to the actual research, taught me so much mathematics and the general mathematical research process. Before PRIMES, I felt intimidated by how hard it seemed to do actual research that was relevant to work in a mathematical field. The application was very rigorous, and gave a taste of what this process would be like. When I got in, I spent a couple months reading specific papers and books relevant to my field. Then, for the rest of the year, I was able to make actual progress on a real research problem with guidance from my mentor, and eventually ended with a set of new results. The entire process was made accessible by the structure and rigor of PRIMES. I would highly recommend this program to those looking to have a challenging and rewarding research experience.\n\nRam Goel worked on the project “Products of reflections in smooth Bruhat intervals” (mentor Christian Gaetz).\n\nZifan (Carl) Guo\n\nPRIMES is the most important thing that happened to my computer science journey. Because PRIMES demands me to learn at an accelerated pace to match the graduate level of research we are conducting, I learned in the last year perhaps more than all my years of studying CS combined. While I began my PRIMES project knowing basic high school CS, I was unfamiliar with the two fields that my project explores, machine learning and systems. Still, as time progressed, I grew to be more comfortable in actively investigating novel questions in the field and, hopefully, contributing my work to the literature. I also really enjoyed the “learning-by-doing” approach of research, from which I learned not only technical knowledge but also methodology for more rounds of self-learning. My mentor is amazingly flexible in his schedule and is always there whenever I need help. I’m grateful for everything that PRIMES offers.\n\nZifan (Carl) Guo worked on the project “Studying the effectiveness of transformer models for analyzing low-level programs” (mentor William Moses).\n\nAlex Hu\n\nI am grateful to the PRIMES program for giving me an amazing research experience. When I started my project, I was awestruck by the number of concepts, theorems, and ideas in quantum computing, what we already know and what we do not know for certain. Compared to competition math, math research was an experience on a whole new level of mathematical elegance and creativity. I learned that an important part of research is to read many papers, and I was able to improve my paper-reading skills. PRIMES has given me confidence that I can thrive in the rigorous research process and achieve original results. I am immensely thankful to my mentor, Andrey Khesin, for supporting me through all the ups and downs and sharing with me invaluable insights about not just working on research but also writing papers and giving presentations. I am excited to continue my math journey and work on more research projects in the future!\n\nAlex Hu worked on the project “Improved graph formalism for quantum circuit simulation” (mentor Andrey Khesin).\n\nAkhil Kammila\n\nPRIMES was one of my most rewarding and exciting experiences ever. Each step of the research journey was enjoyable and taught me valuable skills. At the start of the program, my mentor guided me through background reading and material. She was extremely helpful and was always available for me to ask questions to. I learned how to analyze past research papers and delved deep into the intriguing field of cryptography. The research throughout the remainder of the year was even more enthralling. I loved the process of brainstorming and testing ideas with my mentor, who constantly supported and encouraged me. I would undoubtedly recommend PRIMES to any peers – you won’t regret it!\n\nAkhil Kammila worked on the project “An analysis of the Tor Handshake” (mentor Kyle Hogan).\n\nYanan (Nancy) Jiang\n\nBefore I entered PRIMES, I thought math research was — like competitions — an independent endeavor. I often struggled through problems myself, communicating exclusively with my mentor until a possible solution dawned on me. However, having worked with Sophie and Ben under Dr. Felix Gotti this past year in a group research project, I realized just how precious and indispensable this experience was. My research partners helped me resolve standing questions and offered many new perspectives to our project. We bonded over revising each other’s works and sharing the frustrations of not yielding satisfactory results. Moreover, I am very grateful for my mentor, who has been incredibly supportive, encouraging, and inspiring all along. Although we weren’t able to meet or work together in person due to the ongoing pandemic, MIT PRIMES has provided me with an unparalleled and fruitful research experience that further consolidated my determination to pursue mathematics in the future.\n\nYanan (Nancy) Jiang worked on the joint project with Bangzheng (Benjamin) Li and Sophie Zhu “Factorization invariants of algebraic valuations of positive cyclic semirings” (mentor Dr. Felix Gotti).\n\nSushanth Sathish Kumar\n\nPrior to the PRIMES program, I was familiar with competitive math and the basics of higher math like abstract algebra. PRIMES exposed me to algebraic topology, an entirely new field of mathematics for me, and also to research. The math problems I worked on before were all solved (and could be solved in a relatively short time frame) so the prospect of working on an unsolved problem thrilled me. Aside from learning the background material, I learned how to break down a complicated problem and write my own paper on it. During my weekly meetings with my amazing mentor Adela Zhang, we talked not only about progress on the problem but also the bigger picture of my project, which captivated me. Discussions like these also piqued my interest in the other aspects of algebraic topology besides homology and spectral sequences. I’m extremely grateful to PRIMES for the opportunities it provided me in not only working on an unsolved problem but also realizing the beauty of a field of mathematics I had never seen before.\n\nSushanth Sathish Kumar worked on the project “Extending the restricted Lie algebra structure on the homology of a double loop space” (mentor Adela Zhang).\n\nBangzheng (Benjamin) Li\n\nBesides learning math knowledge through math books and courses, doing math research also excites me a lot. Since middle school, I have written down my findings. At that time, I arranged some of my findings into a paper. However, from my current point of view, that paper was totally trivial and did not contribute anything new. After realizing this fact, I developed a slightly pessimistic view toward doing research in high school. I even heard that only graduate students would be able to solve open problems. However, the PRIMES-USA program totally changed my mind. Under the brilliant instruction of my mentor, I successfully produced some new research findings, which made me extremely happy because for the first time I believed that even as a high school student I could still discover new theorems and propositions if I worked hard. Moreover, some of these results are so beautiful that whenever I thought about what I have done, I would smile. Through PRIMES-USA, I saw my growth and learned a lot about how to do research, and I think I am more prepared to be a mathematician in the future. As a result, I would highly recommend it to those who are interested in math research.\n\nBangzheng (Benjamin) Li worked on the joint project with Yanan (Nancy) Jiang and Sophie Zhu “Factorization invariants of algebraic valuations of positive cyclic semirings,” and on the individual project “A new class of atomic monoid algebras without the ascending chain condition on principal ideals” (both mentored by Dr. Felix Gotti).\n\nYavor Litchev\n\nMIT PRIMES was a phenomenal learning opportunity. I enjoyed reading research papers in the field of cryptography and discussing them with my mentor. I learned a lot about artificial intelligence and cryptographic concepts such as differential privacy, multiparty computation, digital signatures, and more. I was able to work on both theoretical and applied aspects of cryptography and learned a lot about doing research. Although challenging at times, I found it very thrilling whenever I understood or solved a problem. PRIMES was a great experience and I look forward to continue exploring and applying what I’ve learned.\n\nYavor Litchev worked on the project “Distributed signature scheme with monotonic access pattern” (mentor Yu Xia).\n\nTanisha Saxena\n\nPRIMES was a great opportunity for me to dive into computer science research. The unique experience of genuine discoveries and in-depth collaboration transformed the way I thought about the field. Through background reading, I learned how crucial a solid understanding of past work is for creating new research. The research process itself was satisfyingly challenging, and while occasionally it felt like there was so much to do that it was hard to determine where to begin, the invaluable insights of my mentor Jun Wan and our collaboration helped our research flourish. I am extremely grateful for the freedom PRIMES has given me to explore and develop in my areas of interest, and I look forward to seeing how I can use this experience to grow more in the future.\n\nTanisha Saxena worked on the project “A compromise between synchronous and asynchronous systems” (mentor Jun Wan).\n\nAbigail Thomas\n\nMy experience with MIT PRIMES has been one of the most life-changing and rewarding opportunities of my life. I had always had an interest in computer science, but through PRIMES, I had the opportunity to explore branches I was unfamiliar with, including cryptography, with the guidance of an approachable, knowledgeable, and dedicated mentor. Going on my third year of research with PRIMES, I also appreciate how each year has been a unique experience. In my first year, I was paired with a research partner, while in my second year, I conducted research individually. Both years, I studied entirely different sub-branches of cryptography and also acquired different soft skills from working in a team setting and working individually. Having participated in other research programs, I can also say that the duration of PRIMES makes it stand out from all other high school research programs. We have an entire year to conduct research, much longer than other high school research programs, which makes a significant difference in the quality of research presented during the PRIMES conference. For any students interested in mathematics, computer science, or computational biology research, I encourage you to apply! It is a very enriching experience that you will thoroughly enjoy.\n\nAbigail Thomas worked on the project “The implementation of model pruning to optimize zk-SNARKs” (mentor Yu Xia).\n\nEliyahu Yablon\n\nPRIMES was a great experience in which I learned a lot. I was able to delve into applied cryptography by brainstorming difficult problems with others and coming up with new ideas. I came across all kinds of interesting concepts that I had never heard of before: zero-knowledge proofs, secret sharing, and more. Not only that, but I also gained a great deal of experience in research. I now know how to effectively understand other people's papers, and how to write my own papers such that they will be enticing and coherent. Overall, I'm very thankful to the PRIMES program and to my mentor for presenting me with this wonderful opportunity to learn and grow.\n\nEliyahu Yablon worked on the joint project with Simon Beyzerov “Versatile anonymous authentication with Cloak” (mentor Sacha Servan-Schreiber).\n\nWilliam Yue\n\nMy time in the MIT PRIMES program for the last three years has been the most incredible mathematics experience of my high school career. Before PRIMES, I had a lot of exposure to math competitions and olympiads, but hadn’t explored much college math or research. In my first two years, I studied many undergraduate topics in reading groups and even conducted a theoretical CS research project over the summer! In my research project last year, my mentor helped us understand the challenging graduate level background and provided helpful guidance throughout the research aspects of the project. The work was difficult, and it required many iterative ideas or improvements to our methods over several months to prove our results. While it was unclear which ideas would be helpful and which would lead to dead ends, the mystery was an exciting part of the adventure! In addition, it was a great pleasure working with my groupmates: we could see different approaches to tackle the problem and bounce ideas off of each other. In the end, our research project was quite successful, and I’m excited for my fourth year in the program! I highly recommend the MIT PRIMES program for anyone interested in higher mathematics!\n\nWilliam Yue studied in reading groups on “Shor's algorithm and the Period Finding Problem” and “Markov chains and card shuffling” (both mentored by Chun Hong Lo) and worked on the joint project with Karthik Seetharaman and Isaac Zhu “Regularities in the lattice homology of Seifert homology spheres” (mentor Dr. Irving Dai)."
