        "text": "My original research theme was quantum and classical magnetism. Superconductivity was another research topic that attracted my interest. Superconductivity is required by some but not all types of solid-state-based quantum computer hardware.\n\nI started my research on quantum annealing in earnest when I was at NEC Labs America which provided an ideal research environment. In particular, being able to exchange opinions with the excellent researchers around me was very important, and there were such colleagues in both the United States and Japan. We were grateful that there was an atmosphere that allowed us to focus on research themes with long time horizons for impact, but which we truly believed worth tackling.\n\nIn our paper on quantum annealing, we hypothesized that quantum tunneling would cause the system to equilibrate in a shorter time than classical barrier hopping (*3). I will explain this later, but at the time of the study, we did not know how long it would take for quantum annealing to reach equilibrium. Also, the first paper did not really prove the model of the quantum tunneling mechanism. That was fully proved in the second paper, but I remember struggling with that when we wrote the first paper. We needed to convince ourselves that the model should be correct to continue our research, even if we had not be able to prove it yet.\n\n(*3)\n\nbarrier hopping: A phenomenon in which electrons that exist in places with low energy hop and attempt to move to places with lower energy with a certain probability due to energy from the outside like heat and/or light.\n\nOne of the advantages of quantum computers was shown in 1994 by the theoretical computer scientist and mathematician Peter Shor, saying it would be possible to produce prime factors of a large number by using a fast quantum algorithm with no known efficient implementation on a classical computer. His insight had a huge impact on the research community.\n\nA certain type of digital cryptography widely used is based on the fact that we cannot perform large number factorization quickly enough with current digital technology, but Shor’s work implies that it can be solved with quantum computers.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how many such problems really exist, but the fact that a quarter century has elapsed and no classical algorithm as efficient as Shor’s quantum algorithm has been found increases the belief (but of course does not prove) that there are problems that classic computers cannot handle and quantum computers can solve.\n\nAlso, in principle, quantum computers can function more efficiently than classical computers. Today's computers are very inefficient and, from a thermodynamic point of view, are less efficient than, for example, modern aircraft. Flying from Tokyo to Zurich by airliner consumes considerable kerosene and produces CO2 emissions which cannot be ignored as well. But in reality, computers are even more harmful to the environment. It is said that a search on the internet can use enough energy to boil a cup of tea. From a long-term perspective, mankind will need to more seriously exploit quantum mechanics in computers to reduce CO2 emissions.\n\nOf course, current quantum computer designs are inefficient because they require a lot of power for cooling. However, quantum computers in the future are expected to function nearer to room temperature, and should enable highly efficient data processing in the thermodynamic sense.\n\nI find it interesting that the topic of cooling efficiency of cloud services (*4) is discussed on NEC's website, showing that the increase in CO2 emissions due to IT technology is a major concern, and even if the same computational problem can be solved with a classic computer, in the long term, replacing it with an appropriate quantum computer should reduce energy costs and environmental load.\n\n(*4)\n\ncooling efficiency of cloud services: NEC's data center cooling technology utilizing phase change cooling technique reduces the summertime air-conditioning power consumption by half, compared with conventional air conditioners.\n\n<https://www.nec.com/en/global/rd/technologies/datacenter_cooling/index.html>\n\nI am attracted to quantum computing because even if it is theoretically possible, there are various challenges to achieve it in full form, and it is not clear how to meet them. (Laughs) It's worth researching on because we don't know the whole picture yet.\n\nI was interested in this field by becoming aware of Peter Shor's paper when I was at Bell Labs, and was surrounded by researchers who were actually interested in quantum mechanics at NEC Labs America, so I wished I could somehow develop an experimental demonstration of the relevance of quantum mechanics to computation. At the time, I was thinking about practical applications of quantum magnetism, one of my main research subjects, so the existence of such colleagues encouraged me very much.\n\nAlso, the famous physicist Richard Feynman had recognized the possibility of performing calculations using quantum mechanical \" behavior,\" and I was motivated by the clear relationship between his insight and quantum computers."
