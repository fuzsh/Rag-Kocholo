        "text": "06/28/2024\n\nUniversity of Copenhagen and MIT Join Forces for Transatlantic Research in Quantum Computing\n\nProfessor Morten Kjaergaard’s group at the University of Copenhagen and the EQuS group at MIT are joining forces to accelerate research in the development of advanced quantum computers. The agreement entails building two identical laboratory setups – one at UCPH and one at MIT, both financed by the Novo Nordisk Foundation Quantum Computing Programme. This collaboration will enable the two research groups to try and solve the biggest quantum puzzles that continue to challenge researchers by exchanging personnel and ideas, running parallel experiments, and comparing results.\n\n04/24/2024\n\nAmir, Ilan, Sarah, Cora, and collaborators’ manuscript, “Probing entanglement in a 2D hard-core Bose-Hubbard lattice” was published in Nature!\n\nIn this work, we probe the entanglement structure of various states using a 4×4 array of transmon qubits, observing a crossover from volume-law to area-law-type entanglement. The 4×4 qubit array emulates the Bose-Hubbard model with a many-body energy spectrum. States near the center of this spectrum exhibit a volume-law scaling of entanglement entropy, whereas states near the edge of the spectrum exhibit an area-law scaling. Creating volume-law entanglement is a key to realizing beyond-classical performance of quantum computers. Our work demonstrates a platform-independent means to characterize area-law versus volume-law entanglement that can scale to larger systems. Congratulations to all authors in the EQuS group and MIT Lincoln Laboratory.\n\n04/22/2024\n\nEQuS Alum Francisca Vasconcelos awarded 2024 Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowship\n\nEQuS alum Francisca Vasconcelo was selected to the Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowships 2024 Class of Distinguished New Americans. Fran’s parents emigrated together from Portugal to the United States in pursuit of world-class scientific research opportunities in the early 1990s. Fran was born in Boston while her parents were PhD students at MIT and Harvard University. Fran graduated from MIT in 2020 with a BS in electrical engineering, computer science, and physics. During her undergraduate years, she conducted substantial research in machine learning and data analysis for quantum computers in EQuS. In 2020, she received the Rhodes Scholarship, which allowed her to pursue an MSc in statistical sciences and an MSt in philosophy of physics at the University of Oxford. Currently, she is pursuing a computer science PhD and is an NSF Graduate Research Fellow at the University of California Berkeley. Congratulations, Fran!\n\n04/18/2024\n\nProfessor William Oliver elected fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)\n\nProfessor William D Oliver was recently elected a fellow of the AAAS (American Association for the Advancement of Science). The AAAS Fellow is a prestigious honor awarded by the AAAS to individuals who have made significant contributions to the advancement of science and technology. The fellowship is bestowed upon scientists, engineers, and innovators across various disciplines, recognizing their outstanding achievements and their efforts to advance science or its applications. The MIT cohort this year also includes Prof. Daniel Rothman, Prof. Bevin Engelward, and Prof. Vladan Vuletic. Congratulations, Will and all!\n\nThis was also featured in MIT News.\n\n09/25/2023\n\nLeon, Max, and collaborators’ manuscript, “High-Fidelity, Frequency-Flexible Two-Qubit Fluxonium Gates with a Transmon Coupler,” was published in Physical Review X!\n\nIn this experiment, we proposed and demonstrated an architecture for fluxonium-fluxonium two-qubit gates mediated by a transmon coupler. The architecture enabled strong couple (fast two-qubit gates) while suppressing unwanted ZZ interactions to the kilohertz level over a wide range of frequencies. We demonstrated single qubit gates exceeding 99.99% and two-qubit gates exceeding 99.9% using model-free reinforcement learning to tune the gates. The circuit was fabricated at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, with each fluxonium qubit comprising an array of 102 Josephson junctions. Congratulations to all authors in the EQuS group and MIT Lincoln Laboratory!\n\n08/29/2023\n\nCora, Amir, and collaborators’ manuscript, “Learning-based Calibration of Flux Crosstalk in Transmon Qubit Arrays,” was published in Physical Review Applied.\n\nIn this work, the authors investigated a learning-based approach to calibrating flux crosstalk for precise qubit frequency control, and demonstrated its efficacy on an array of 16 flux-tunable transmons. The overall calibration time for this learning-based approach grows linearly with array size, a marked improvement over quadratically-scaling direct measurement approaches. This work contributes to the growing need for extensible calibration techniques as qubit array sizes continue to increase. Congratulations to all the authors in EQuS and Lincoln Laboratory! Congratulations to all authors!\n\n06/30/2023\n\nDavid, Lamia, and collaborators’ manuscript, “Evolution of 1/f Flux Noise in Superconducting Qubits with Weak Magnetic Fields,” was published in Physical Review Letters!\n\nIn this experiment, we measured flux-noise-limited qubit dephasing while applying in-plane magnetic fields, unveiling distinct signatures that include a 1/f to approximately Lorentzian transition in the noise power spectral density below 10 Hz, and a suppression of noise above 1 MHz with increasing field. These trends suggest the importance of spin-spin interactions, and serve as new clues to elucidate the microscopic physics of 1/f flux noise in superconducting circuits. The work is a collaboration between researchers with the EQuS group, the Comin group, and MIT Lincoln Laboratory. Congratulations to all authors!\n\n06/20/2023\n\nMontpellier, France – Joel Wang, a research scientist at EQuS, recently spoke at the BNW2023 Inaugural Workshop on Hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN). The workshop highlighted the growing research community dedicated to hBN, a versatile material with applications in electronics, polaritonics, lighting, imaging, quantum technologies, biology, materials science, and theory.\n\nDuring his presentation, Joel focused on utilizing hBN as a low-loss dielectric in the construction of superconducting quantum devices. Specifically, he discussed the development of compact components like parallel plate capacitors and Josephson junctions. These hBN-based devices enable significant reductions in qubit size and minimize unwanted coupling between neighboring qubits, which is crucial for constructing multi-qubit quantum processors.\n\n05/27/2023\n\nCora and her team win the 2023 NCAA Division III National Championship\n\nEQuS UROP Cora Barrett (undergrad at Wellesley College) and her teammates from the Wellesley Varsity Crew team won the 2023 NCAA Division III National Championship on Saturday at Cooper River.

We do so by using an artificial molecule comprising two superconducting qubits strongly coupled to a bidirectional waveguide. Quantum interference between the photon emission pathways from the molecule generates single photons that selectively propagate in a chosen direction. The result effectively creates a chiral microwave waveguide. This is a first step in our path to realize high-fidelity and high-connectivity quantum interconnects and extensible networks of quantum processors.

Such interactions are counterintuitive as there is no corresponding coupling between classical objects. However, numerous proposed quantum simulation and quantum computing applications rely on many-body interactions. The work was performed on a circuit architecture in which a coupler mediates interactions between three flux qubits. Using multi-qubit pulse sequences that enable interferometry between all neighboring excitation manifolds, the team verified that the system exhibits a 3-qubit coupling that is coherently tunable.

In this work, we proposed experimental methods capable of characterizing multispin interactions in noisy spin systems by distinguishing these interactions from lower-order effects. These multispin interactions are of large practical importance as these provide a natural way of mapping combinatorial optimization problems to quantum computers. However, these interactions are hard to measure and detect experimentally due to their small magnitudes and that these are overshadowed by lower-order spin effects. Using numerical and theoretical arguments, we showed that by carefully measuring qubit transitions energies and rates, multispin interactions present a unique signature in a quantum system, which allows their observation. The proposed experimental methods are shown to be robust to experimental errors, and can be applied to realistic quantum devices, such as current noisy superconducting qubit architectures.

In this work, we consider the properties of arrays of “floating” transmon qubits, which are not all connected to the same ground. We find that an extraneous degree of freedom in these qubits, not usually considered in their analysis, can mediate a different kind of coupling in the array, even between qubits that are not physically connected. This coupling can be tuned to different regimes by changing the physical parameters of the array and could be used in designing new systems with interesting properties.

Charles, the lead author, is presenting the work this week at the ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages (POPL 2022). It was also featured in MIT CSAIL news.Programs for quantum computers are difficult to debug because of the intricate quantum correlations formed during their execution, which make tomographic verification prohibitively costly. This work presents Twist, a quantum programming language with a static type system that tracks the purity of expressions. By reasoning about entanglement in advance of program execution, Twist can prove the absence of certain bugs at the cost of adding only lightweight program annotations. Dynamic purity assertions further enhance the expressivity of the language while incurring only minimal simulation overhead.

In this work, performed in collaboration with Yariv Yanay and Charlie Tahan at the Laboratory for Physical Sciences, we performed hybrid analog-digital procedures on a strongly interacting 3×3 superconducting qubit array emulating a 2D hard-core Bose-Hubbard lattice. We used out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) and time-reversed dynamics – achieved with a Loschmidt echo – to characterize the propagation of quantum information throughout the 2D array. The complexity of quantum states makes their evolution difficult to simulate with classical computers, especially as the number of qubits increases.

Congratulations to all authors worldwide!\n\n10/22/2021\n\nTim and Thi Ha’s manuscript “Quantum computer-aided design: digital quantum simulation of quantum processors” published in Physical Review Applied\n\nTim, Thi Ha (Aspuru-Guzik group at UToronto), and co-author’s manuscript “Quantum computer-aided design: digital quantum simulation of quantum processors” was published in Physical Review Applied. The team has identified a new family of relevant applications for near-term quantum computers: The design of new quantum processors themselves. Our key observation is that the computational overhead of simulating even part of the processor will exceed existing computational resources as the quantum processor size grows. In our work, we establish the new paradigm of simulating quantum hardware on a quantum computer. The proposed framework is the first of its kind and combines near-term variational algorithms and intermediate-term techniques to compute the static and dynamic properties of individual and coupled superconducting transmon qubits. As in many digital design processes, the make-test-analyze design cycle for quantum hardware can be enhanced by using the proposed QCAD algorithm. In addition, our work opens new opportunities in quantum simulation, quantum machine learning, and quantum algorithms development. Congratulations Tim, Thi Ha, and co-authors!\n\n9/9/2021\n\nNathan Holman (Mark Eriksson group at UW-Madison) and co-authors’ manuscript “3D integration and measurement of a semiconductor double quantum dot with a high-impedance TiN resonator” published in npj Quantum Information\n\nNathan Holman (Mark Eriksson group at UW-Madison) and co-authors’ manuscript “3D integration and measurement of a semiconductor double quantum dot with a high-impedance TiN resonator” was published in npj Quantum Information. In this work, we utilize flip-chip 3D integration to couple a high-impedance superconducting TiN resonator on one chip to a double quantum dot in a Si/SiGe heterostructure on another chip. We demonstrate quantum dot qubit readout in the single electron regime with an SNR = 5.36. This demonstration shows that 3D integrated devices can maintain low-charge noise for the quantum dots and high-quality factors for the superconducting resonator (internal Q in the single-photon limit of 300,000), necessary for readout and high-fidelity two-qubit gates.

The publication was also featured in MIT News. In this work, we demonstrate a tunable coupler that turns on and off the qubit-qubit coupling and enables us to achieve state-of-the art longitudinal (CZ: 99.76+/-0.07%) and transverse (iSWAP: 99.87+/-0.23%) two-qubit interaction fidelities, each being essentially coherence-limited. To eliminate the unwanted qubit-qubit (ZZ) interaction, we harness the higher-excited states of the coupler. Furthermore, our thorough analysis of the multi-level dynamics of the two-qubit gates enables the design of optimized control pulse-shaping that results in negligible leakage to the coupler. The principles and demonstrations presented in this work will help address one of the most critical quantum hardware issues today.

Our work propels the quickly evolving field of superconducting circuit quantum computation towards greater automation: Circuits are designed by an automated discovery software, thus bypassing a large part of the tedious design process that is usually done by human researchers. Given a desired target property, the software automatically searches thousands of circuit designs for one that exhibits the property. We demonstrate the usefulness of the method by searching for a circuit that couples multiple quantum bits at the same time. After about four days of running on a computing cluster and searching through more than 250,000 circuits, our software successfully identified a coupler circuit with manageable complexity and low noise sensitivity. In this way, we speed up the design of quantum chips, inspire new design concepts, and free up scientists’ time to make the next breakthrough experimental discovery. Congratulations Tim, Florian and co-authors at EQuS, Lincoln Laboratory, Harvard, and the University of Toronto!\n\n2/11/2021\n\nYoungkyu’s manuscript “Multi-level quantum noise spectroscopy” published in Nature Communications\n\nYoungkyu, Antti, Jochen, and co-authors’ manuscript, “Multi-level quantum noise spectroscopy,” was published in Nature Communications. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a spin-locking-based noise spectroscopy protocol that accounts for – and utilizes – multiple qubit transitions. Our protocol extends the spectral range of weakly anharmonic qubit spectrometers beyond the present limitations set by their lack of strong anharmonicity. Also, the additional information gained from probing the higher-excited levels enables identifying and distinguishing contributions from different underlying noise mechanisms.

In this work, performed in collaboration with Yun-Pil Shim and Charlie Tahan at the Laboratory for Physical Science (LPS), we demonstrated the use of non-adiabatic driving to implement a universal set of gates on small-gap qubits. Our test device was a new type of “composite quantum bit” that features a small gap and affords longer coherence times with greater immunity to environmental noise than current standard architectures. The control technique demonstrated here enables fast, high-fidelity control of small-gap qubits, including so-called “protected qubits,” which like the composite qubit hold the promise of higher coherence times, but are difficult to control using standard, resonant techniques.

In this work, we use a surface loss extraction technique to identify the strength and location of loss mechanisms on the various surfaces of coplanar waveguide resonators — substrate to air, substrate to metal, and metal to air — and within the silicon substrate. We use the technique to compare aluminum and titanium nitride resonators. We then intentionally alter one fabrication step — presence or absence of a post-process hydrofluoric etch — and directly identify the change in resonator Q associated with the substrate-air interface.

These results provide a guide for minimizing flux noise in future quantum circuits.\n\n2/14/2020\n\nFrancisca Vasconcelos publishes “Quantum Computing @ MIT: The Past, Present, and Future of the Second Revolution in Computing.”\n\nUROP, Francisca Vasconcelos, interviewed four MIT quantum computing and information faculty – William Oliver, Dirk Englund, Isaac Chuang, and Aram Harrow – for the MIT Undergraduate Research Journal (MURJ). The article, “Quantum Computing @ MIT: The Past, Present, and Future of the Second Revolution in Computing,” provides a high-level overview of the history of the field, current research challenges, and future prospects of the technology.\n\n2/3/2020\n\nEQuS submits six papers to arXiv\n\nCongratulations to the lead authors and co-authors from EQuS who recently submitted papers to the arXiv during December and January!\n\nUwe von Luepke’s paper, “Two-qubit spectroscopy of spatiotemporally correlated quantum noise in superconducting qubits,” discusses noise spectroscopy of spatiotemporally correlated noise in two qubits. While error detection and correction protocols exist, most rely on an uncorrelated noise assumption. To understand and address correlated noise, one first must characterize it. In this work, Uwe and co-authors experimentally validate a protocol for achieving two-qubit quantum noise spectroscopy. Uwe was a visiting student in EQuS from 2017-2018.\n\nGraduate student, Bharath Kannan’s work, “Waveguide quantum electrodynamics with giant superconducting artificial atoms,” realizes “giant atoms” by coupling transmon qubits to multiple, well-separated locations along a waveguide. When modeling light-matter interactions, atoms are typically treated as small point-like objects. The paper probes the physics of the giant-atom regime of waveguide quantum electrodynamics (wQED) and shows that this architecture can be applied for quantum simulations and non-classical photon generation for quantum communication protocols.\n\nAna Laura Gramajo’s paper, “Quantum simulation of coherent backscattering in a system of superconducting qubits,” discusses the implementation of a quantum emulator of weak localization (WL) and universal conductance fluctuations (UCF) using coherent scattering at an avoided crossing in a system of two coupled superconducting qubits. The scattering events are controllably implemented as coherent Landau-Zener transitions by driving the two-qubit system multiple times through an avoided crossing. While a priori there is not a direct connection between driven superconducting qubits and mesoscopic disordered electronic systems, the results demonstrate how a well-controlled driven qubit system can be used to study complex effects in mesoscopic physics. Ana was a visiting student in EQuS during 2018.\n\nPostdoctoral Associate Morten Kjaergaard and Lincoln Laboratory Research Scientist Mollie Kimchi-Schwartz submitted their demonstration of a quantum algorithm, entitled “A quantum instruction set implemented on a superconducting quantum processor.” In their paper, they use two superconducting qubits to make the first experimental demonstration of the Density Matrix Exponentiation algorithm. Their experiment shows for the first time how quantum states can act as a quantum instruction set to program a quantum computer.\n\nPostdoctoral Associate Antti Vepsäläinen and graduate student Amir Karamlou submitted their work, entitled “Impact of ionizing radiation on superconducting qubit coherence.” In collaboration with the group of MIT Physics Professor Joe Formaggio, researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), and MIT Lincoln Laboratory researchers, Antti and Amir characterized the impact of ionizing radiation from the cosmic rays and environmental nuclear decay on superconducting qubit coherence. They also showed that using a lead shield can improve coherence times by reducing the flux of radiation. In order to beat down the noise, EQuS researchers performed a Dicke radiometry “lock-in” experiment, raising and lower a two-ton lead shield on a 10-minute period for 4 days(!)\n\nGraduate student Tim Menke, who holds a joint appointment at MIT and Harvard, also submitted his paper entitled “Automated discovery of superconducting circuits and its application to 4-local coupler design.” In this work, Tim used an optimization algorithm to design a superconducting qubit circuit based on a generalized network of circuit elements and a predefined cost function.\n\n2/2/2020\n\nZiqiao and Grecia win award at iQuHACK\n\nMembers of the EQuS group won the Industry Choice award for their project,”VQE for the Schwinger Model with Applications to Classical Simulations.” The event’s sponsors gave the award at the first Interdisciplinary Quantum HACKathon (iQuHACK).\n\nEQuS members, Ziqiao Ao and Grecia Castelazo, joined Artur Avkhadiev and Denis Boyda of the Center for Theoretical Physics to simulate 1 + 1D quantum electrodynamics on a superconducting quantum processor provided by IBM.
