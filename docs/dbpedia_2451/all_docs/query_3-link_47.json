        "text": "Four scientists whose research helped launch the quest for quantum computing have been awarded the 2023 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics, one of the most prestigious awards in science.\n\nGilles Brassard, Charles H. Bennett, Peter Shor, and David Deutsch were among the first scientists to recognize the incredible potential in harnessing quantum phenomena for quantum information processing and cryptography.\n\nBrassard, a long-time Perimeter affiliate based at the University of Montreal, co-created the BB84 protocol for quantum cryptography with Bennett of IBM, who held a Distinguished Visiting Research Chair (DVRC) at Perimeter between 2016 and 2019.\n\nShor, a Perimeter DVRC between 2012 and 2018, is the namesake of Shor’s algorithm, which demonstrated the ability of quantum computers to tackle factoring tasks intractable for classical computers. Deutsch, of the University of Oxford, formulated a description for a quantum Turing machine and made vital contributions to the development of quantum key distribution.\n\nSpeaking with The Globe and Mail in the wake of the announcement, Perimeter Director Robert Myers referred to the winners as \"a wonderful choice.\"\n\n\"Today's prize recognizes a field that's been growing for a long time now and will have an enormous impact on our lives in the coming years,” says Myers. \"These are the people who set the foundations for quantum information.\""
