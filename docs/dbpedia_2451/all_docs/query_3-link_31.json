        "text": "In 1994, American mathematician and computer scientist Peter Shor developed a groundbreaking quantum computer algorithm for factoring integers while working at AT&T Bell Laboratories. Shor’s algorithm drew inspiration from an earlier algorithm by Daniel Simon, which showcased the exponential speed advantage of quantum computers. Shor recognized that this advantage was linked to finding the period of a function, a crucial step in factoring integers. The algorithm was first published in the Proceedings of the 35th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science in 1994, and later in the SIAM Journal on Computing in 1997.\n\nWhat is the algorithm and how does it work?\n\nClassical computers rely on algorithms that become increasingly inefficient as the size of the number to be factored grows larger. This is known as the difficulty of factoring large numbers using classical methods. In contrast, Shor’s algorithm exploits the principles of quantum mechanics to achieve exponential speedup in factoring large numbers.\n\nIn laymen terms, Shor’s algorithm works by using a quantum computer to find the period of a special function that depends on the number to be factored. The period is the…"
