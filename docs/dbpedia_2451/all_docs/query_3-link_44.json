        "text": "Salman Beigi received his B.Sc. at Sharif University of Technology, Tehran in 2004. He finished his Ph.D. at the MIT Math Department in 2009 under the direction of Peter Shor, and continued his research as a postdoc at the Institute for Quantum Information at Caltech. He has recently started a new job at the Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences. His interests include quantum complexity theory, quantum coding theory, photography, and playing daf, a traditional Persian musical instrument.\n\nPeter Shor is a professor at MIT. He is known for his factoring algorithm."
