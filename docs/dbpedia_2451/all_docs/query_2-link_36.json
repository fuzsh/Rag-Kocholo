        "text": "THE online message board is littered with enigmatic statements. “The DME system does not reach the claimed level of security,” says one. “We looked at the EdonK KEM and found an attack,” declares another.\n\nIf that sounds vaguely ominous, think again – it is even worse than it seems. The message board is a blow-by-blow account of an ongoing battle between humans and machines. At stake is nothing less than the cybersecurity that underpins modern society. If we lose, then everything from our WhatsApp chats and medical records to government secrets will be wide open to attack. Nothing will be safe.\n\nThe danger lies in the fact that, before long, someone will build a quantum computer that can crack our most powerful encryption methods – the mathematical tricks that turn data into unreadable secret code to hide it from prying eyes. The only way to defend ourselves is to build codes that even the most powerful machines conceivable cannot crack. Which is exactly why some of the world’s smartest mathematicians have been attempting to invent a whole new class of encryption algorithms.\n\nHaving submitted their best designs to the post-quantum cryptography group at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Maryland, scores of teams are now engaged in a global race to identify the most secure by trying everything they can think of to crack each other’s codes. If we find an algorithm that survives every attack, it will emerge as the 21st-century’s gold-standard digital padlock. But for all the competitors, an almost existential question lingers at the backs of their minds: is it even possible to outsmart a…"
