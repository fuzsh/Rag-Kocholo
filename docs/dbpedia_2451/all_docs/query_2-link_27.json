        "text": "Peter Doshi, PhD, is an associate professor in the Department of Practice, Sciences, and Health Outcomes Research.\n\nPeter Doshi, PhD, is an associate professor at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy and senior editor at The BMJ. His research focuses on the drug approval process, how the risks and benefits of medical products are communicated, and improving the credibility and accuracy of evidence synthesis and biomedical publications.\n\nDoshi campaigns for greater transparency of clinical trial data and has received wide recognition for his work. In 2013, the New York Times reported on Doshi’s work to increase public access to clinical study reports. The same year he was also chosen for The Wired “Smart List.” In 2015, he received a New Investigator Award from the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy. Doshi has presented on the topic of clinical trial data sharing to the Institute of Medicine in 2013 and 2014, and served on advisory panels to the European Medicines Agency regarding its policy on proactive publication of clinical trial data.\n\nMuch of Doshi’s research has examined the science and politics of influenza policy. His most cited publication is a Cochrane systematic review of neuraminidase inhibitors for influenza. This review—the first Cochrane review to be based exclusively on clinical study reports and other regulatory documents—challenged previous understandings of the drugs’ effectiveness and raised new questions about their safety, and led to governmental inquiries in the United Kingdom. It is cited as a milestone in the James Lind Library, which chronicles the evolution of fair tests and research synthesis.\n\nDoshi leads the RIAT Support Center. The Restoring Invisible and Abandoned Trials (RIAT) initiative enables researchers everywhere to address two long-standing problems in the biomedical literature: non-publication and misreporting of trials. The RIAT Support Center aims to accelerate the correction of the scientific record of clinical trials by making publications more accurate and more complete, addressing these problems of publication bias and reporting bias.\n\nDoshi earned an A.B. in anthropology from Brown University, an A.M. in East Asian Studies from Harvard University and Ph.D. in history, anthropology, and science, technology and society from MIT. During his PhD, he was an intern at the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, a research student at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, and studied as visiting researcher at the University of Tokyo Center for Biomedical Ethics and Law. Doshi completed a fellowship in comparative effectiveness research at Johns Hopkins before joining the faculty at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy.\n\nGrants\n\nBetween 2011 and 2014, Doshi was a co-recipient of a UK National Institute for Health Research grant to carry out a Cochrane review of neuraminidase inhibitors (PI: Carl Heneghan, University of Oxford). In 2015, Doshi received a New Investigator Award from the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy to fund a PhD student to study consumer medical information about the possible harms of statins (PI: Peter Doshi). From 2015 to 2016, Doshi was a co-investigator on a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute funded grant to compare data from multiple sources (PI: Kay Dickersin, Johns Hopkins University). From 2015 to 2018, Doshi has been a co-investigator in a Cochrane Methods Innovation Fund sponsored project to develop guidance regarding when to use regulatory data in Cochrane reviews (PI: Tom Jefferson). Beginning in 2018, Doshi will be a collaborator on a Canadian Institutes of Health Research funded project “Beyond Transparency in Pharmaceutical Research and Regulation” (PI: Matthew Herder, Dalhousie University, 2018-2022). Doshi is principal investigator of the RIAT Support Center, which was funded by the Laura and John Arnold Foundation (2017-2022).\n\nPlease visit the BMJ editorial staff website for a statement of competing interests.\n\nPublications\n\nWriting/speaking on Covid-19:\n\n“The FDA and Moderna’s cosy relationship: how lax rules enable a revolving door culture” (The BMJ, Nov 1, 2023)\n\n“Concerns about this Cochrane review of COVID-19 vaccines” (Rapid response on Cochrane Library, Oct 23, 2023)\n\n“How many bite the hand that feeds them?
