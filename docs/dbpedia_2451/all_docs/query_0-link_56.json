        "text": "<p>Your age shouldn’t be an issue in the least. Our son applied to the Media Lab M.S./Ph.D. program at age 14, despite my and my husband’s thinking he was going against all odds and as such refusing to even pay the application fee (awful that this was, and I did give him a check to reimburse him when he proved me wrong and was admitted). He was also one of only two students who was invited to start in June rather than fall (and if they cared so much about the age, they certainly wouldn’t have invited him to start earlier than the others, but perhaps done something like asked him to defer a year). He is on track (far as we can tell; he submitted his final project for an optional course today and we hope the optional course doesn’t mess him up) to graduate with his M.S. on June 6, so if they admitted a 14-year-old (and indeed even allowed him to live in single person graduate housing at age 14 rather than forcing parents to move in with him into graduate family housing), I am quite confident 22 won’t be an issue in the least. I get the feeling that the average age of students in the program is over 22 (two friends of our son’s who work at the Media Lab are in their 30’s, and the youngest I know about was a 23-year-old in his first year who had no idea our son was younger than he was when he had our son as a TA in a grad class last fall, and I am not even sure if he is a Media Lab program student or just was taking an MAS grad class as people in other depts. do take MAS classes; there could be younger students there, but I am pretty sure the average is over 22 being that I can’t recall even hearing of any students who were 22 or younger since our son started in the program, other than our son of course).</p>\n\n<p>Who runs the Sociable Media group (I’m too lazy to look this up)? I believe Mitch Resnick still runs the Lifelong Kindergarten group and he is a very nice person who again can’t have anything against young students as he knew our son’s age and was the head of the Media Arts and Sciences program when our son was admitted. He took the time to attend a meeting with our son and the housing dept. people, dean of graduate students (a title that has recently been changed), and some others and showed true caring (as did they all) in our son’s welfare and happiness. Our son told me that Dr. Resnick noted to him that his having worked as an independent consultant for a year (though at the time he put in his application, it was just a few months) before coming to the Media Lab was a plus on his side, so they seem to appreciate people who have some work experience between college and graduate school (our son also had done internships started at age 9 with tech companies while in college, but I don’t think that was ever mentioned as a plus particularly, though it might have been). Some of the people from that lab have absolutely incredible resumes, though (I recall one who was a higher up in Blue Mountain Cards when it was a start-up and the guy was still in college; the company was sold for millions while he still worked for the company, I believe, and I am guessing he came to the Media Lab more for his own self-edification than to improve job opportunities, much as is the case for our son who was making $200+/hour on some of his projects before becoming an RA and having to give up other paid work).</p>\n\n<p>More than your experience or age, the one thing that you might have going against you is if you didn’t get your undergraduate degree at MIT. When I was looking into resumes from Media Lab people back when our son had applied, I could find bachelor’s degree information on 21 Media Lab people and 14 of them had a bachelor’s degree from MIT (2 out of 3 is much higher than the average for MIT labs; I think the average was around 25% of MIT graduate students having undergraduate degrees from MIT last I read the statistic), and four of the remaining 7 had their bachelor’s degrees from top universities in other countries (three European and one Canadian), leaving only three who got their bachelor’s degree from an American school that wasn’t MIT. And at least one of those was from a local university and I think had managed to somehow work at the Media Lab while in undergraduate school at the other college (our son had also spent time at the Media Lab starting at age 8, so was known by people, and I am sure this made a large difference as he wasn’t just words and numbers on an application but someone whom they had seen give presentations and corresponded with for years; he had even served on a technical advisory board for his current lab while the other members of the board were quantum computing expert Peter Shor and California Institute of Technology, Harvard, and Berkeley professors, one of whom was also an Olympic athlete years ago if I recall correctly…it was pretty surreal).</p>\n\n<p>If you really want to go to school at the Media Lab (and the Media Lab <em>only</em> accepts graduate students into their program so you don’t really need to add “at the graduate level” after “admissions to the MIT Media Lab”; though plenty of undergraduates work at the lab as UROPs, you can’t get an undergraduate degree from the Media Arts and Sciences department), APPLY. It’s really not much money to apply, right? I’d say anyone who truly dreams of working there should. And you can just take the attitude our son had when he applied - “It’s okay if I don’t get in the first time I apply. I’ll just ask what they are looking for that I don’t have, get that, and keep applying till I get in.” Meanwhile, I’ll urge you to write Dr. Resnick and whoever heads the Sociable Media group and ask <em>them</em> for information - life is too short to be shy, and going directly to who you want to work with/for makes a ton of sense when it comes to <em>any</em> research job.</p>\n\n<p>Good luck!</p>"
