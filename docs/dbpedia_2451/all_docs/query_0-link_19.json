Mattson Intel Corporation\n\nAudience: This course will be of value to programmers (C, C++ or Fortran) interested in learning about OpenMP. Experience with parallel programming is not required.\n\nCourse Description: The OpenMP Application Programming Interface (API) defines compiler directives and library routines that make it relatively easy to create programs for shared memory computers. It first appeared in 1997 and has become the de facto standard for programming shared memory computers. In this tutorial, we will provide a comprehensive overview of OpenMP. The OpenMP specifications are simple enough that in half a day we will be able to cover the entire API. We will start with basic concepts in programming shared memory computers and then move onto the basic constructs in OpenMP. This will include thread creation, assigning work to threads, managing data within the program and finally synchronization of threads. The focus of the tutorial is using OpenMP to write real applications. Therefore, we will demonstrate the OpenMP constructs using excerpts from real applications. We will use these applications to explain how to use the basic OpenMP constructs, but also how to use them effectively to maximize performance and robustness.\n\nLecturer: Dr. Mattson joined Intel in 1993 to work on a wide range of parallel computing issues. He was a senior scientist on the ASCI Teraflop computer project. Later, he helped write the OpenMP API for shared memory programming.

The tutorial should be useful to a variety of people in the field, including decision makers, technical managers, practicing engineers, research students and faculty members.\n\nCourse Description: Processors today populate a variety of markets and application domains: the traditional high-end servers, desktop and mobile computers; embedded computers, especially DSPs, network processors, etc. Traditionally, the advanced micro-architectural features used in processors, within the von Neumann model framework, have trickled down from supercomputers to workstations to PCs. While this trend continues today with embedded processors, DSPs, etc., these newer domains also incorporate processor features and technologies specially suited for just their applications. In this tutorial, we will provide a quick overview of this increasingly complex processor architecture landscape. We first identify and classify several basic processor micro-architectural techniques in the contexts of a typical general- purpose super-scalar processor model and a vector processor model. Extensive speculative processing, multi-threading, modular and hierarchically decoupled instruction issue, and dynamic code optimization are some of the more important trends in traditional high performance CPUs. Next, we will contrast the general-purpose workload’s characteristics with those of the DSP and network processing domains. This will serve as a springboard for looking at the processors (micro-architectures) of those domains. For example, vector- style processing is an important feature in DSP processors. Throughout, we will highlight example features from commercial processors of the respective domains. Finally, we will touch upon the exciting less traditional aspects of the current processor landscape. Dynamic cross-platform binary translation (and code optimization) is breaking the traditional binary compatibility lock in general-purpose and high-end computing. The newer computing domains employ important technologies such as configurable/reusable IP cores, reconfigurable fabrics, system- on-chip, special-purpose co-processors, (automated) processor customization and pecialization, etc. We will provide a quick glimpse of several of these technologies. Overall, the tutorial attendee will get a bird’s eye view of significant architectural and technological trends in processors for the different computing domains.\n\nLecturer: Sriram Vajapeyam is currently an independent consultant in computer architecture and systems.

Check the HiPC website for location information.\n\nAbout Bangalore\n\nBangalore, a bustling metropolis, is the fifth largest city in India and the capital of the state of Karnataka. It is the main center of the Information Technology industry in India; almost every Indian and multi- national IT company has a presence here. Bangalore is home to the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), a premier research institute, and many other aerospace and high technology industries including the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing. Karnataka is home of many ancient Indian architectural marvels, wildlife sanctuaries, rain forests (the Western Ghats), pristine beaches, and rich and hoary cultural traditions.\n\nSightseeing Tour\n\nThere will be a local sightseeing tour following the conference. Tentative schedule: December 22, 7:00 am – 6:00 pm. Please check the HiPC website for details.\n\nTRAVEL CHECKLIST\n\nVisa:\n\nAll non-Indian-citizens are required to have an Indian visa to enter the country. Please allow yourself sufficient time (say 2-3 weeks) to procure an appropriate visa from your nearest Indian consulate. Please check the conference website for information about Indian consulates.\n\nFlight Reservations:\n\nFlights to India tend to fill up well ahead of the December holiday season. We recommend that you make your flight reservations about 3-4 months in advance.\n\nVaccinations (shots):\n\nMany first-time travelers to India prefer to get preventive vaccinations.\n\nForeign Exchange:\n\nWhile international credit cards are widely accepted in commercial establishments in India, several places rely on cash transactions in the local currency (Indian Rupee). We suggest that you carry some Indian currency when entering India or buy Indian currency at the airport when you arrive. The current exchange rate is about Rs. 48/- per\n\nUS dollar. Once in India, you can buy additional Indian currency from local branches of Citibank, Thomas Cook, etc. However, it is typically difficult to convert Indian currency back into foreign currency because of exchange regulations.\n\nHotel Reservations:\n\nPlease make your hotel reservations ahead of time so that you get your choice of accommodation. Check the conference website for information about accommodations. You may also find attractive rates on the web.\n\nTime and Weather\n\nThe Indian Standard Time (IST) is 5 1/2 hours ahead of the Greenwich Mean Time(GMT) and is 13 1/2 hours ahead of the U. S. Pacific Standard Time(PST). In December/January the weather is mildly tropical with temperatures averaging about 21∞ Celsius (approx. 70∞ Fahrenheit) during the day and about 16∞ Celsius (approx. 60∞ Fahrenheit) during the night.\n\nSunrise: 6:06 am (approx.) Sunset: 5:28 pm (approx.)\n\nFor detailed local information, visit the HiPC website at http://www.hipc.org/hipc2002. Check out the local info and accommodation sections.\n\nAirport to Hotel Transportation The airport is 6 kms (approx 3.5 miles) from Taj Residency. The taxi fare can vary. One way prepaid taxi fare is approximately Rs. 250 plus tip.
