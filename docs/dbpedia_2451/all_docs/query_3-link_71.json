Developed by mathematician Peter Shor in 1994, this groundbreaking algorithm has the power to revolutionize the world of cryptography by efficiently factoring large numbersâonce considered an insurmountable task for classical computers.\n\nQrisp provides a dead simple interface to integer factorization using your own backend. For details how this algorithm is implemented, please check the Shor tutorial."
