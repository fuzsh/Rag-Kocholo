        "text": "As a member of the ATARC (Advanced Technology Academic Research Center) quantum working group, I had the chance to contribute to a new white paper on quantum computing. ‚ÄúDemystifying the Capabilities of Quantum Technologies Available Today and in the Future‚Äù published today and is the first in a series of white papers that the working group members are developing to inform the public policy discussion on quantum information science. You can read the paper here: https://lnkd.in/e7Ne2f96\n\nI am happy to share the first manuscript of my group at Ko√ß √úniversitesi . Meet with our recent study on analog computing. https://lnkd.in/dYGFfbnh Our method harnesses chaotic nonlinear attractors to perform machine learning tasks with low power consumption (milliwatt-scale). Inspired by neuromorphic computing, our model is a programmable, versatile, and generalized platform for machine learning tasks. It provides outstanding performance in clustering by utilizing chaotic attractors' nonlinear mapping and sensitivity to initial conditions.\n\nQuantum supremacy is the term coined by John Preskill, a theoretical physicist at Caltech, in 2012, to describe the milestone of showing that a quantum computer can solve a problem that no classical computer can solve in any feasible amount of time, regardless of how useful or meaningful the problem is. The concept of quantum supremacy dates back to the early proposals of quantum computing by Yuri Manin in 1980. and Richard Feynman in 1981, who envisioned that quantum computers could simulate physical systems that are too complex for classical computers.\n\nI'm excited to share that my recent paper, \"Neural Networks with Variational Quantum Circuits,\" has been published, and it has also received the Best Paper Award. The paper delves into the possibilities of integrating quantum computing with classical machine learning. Despite quantum computing being in its infancy, or the NISQ era, we may still obtain valuable results from it. You can access the paper at the following link: https://lnkd.in/ge2-RwzD\n\nNew research from Rice CS PhD student David Q., and his adviser Anastasios Kyrillidis, Noah Harding Assistant Professor of Computer Science, takes a novel approach to the quantum process tomography (QPT) problem in #quantumcomputing scenarios. The paper won Best Poster Award at the International Conference on Rebooting Computing (#ICRC23). Quiroga is seen here receiving the award from the IEEE Computer Society. Read more about their research: https://bit.ly/4bAoZTu\n\nACID is a premier event for academics and industry on cutting-edge Chemistry. üß™ https://www.acid-event.nl/ üß™ Together with Lucas Visscher and Alexandra De Castro, Ph.D., we'll have a session on the impact of Quantum Computing: starting with a gentle introduction, and then diving deeper into the state-of-the-art of quantum software and hardware. Marco Tibaldi\n\nThanks for having me, SIBB e.V.! While I could share my take on the Berlin #AI ecosystem, I learned a lot about the current state of #Quantum Computing. Exciting times ahead. For both AI and Quantum.\n\nOnce again the lectures series at von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics left me with much inspiration. This time about quantum computing in fluid dynamics organised by Frank Eulitz and Wim Munters . Basic concepts, algorithms and applications were introduced. In particular, I appreciated bridging the classical lattice Boltzmann methods with quantum computing. Many thanks to the organizers and all the speakers of which I will mention a few: Matthias M√∂ller , Oleksandr Kyriienko , Ren√© Steijl, Pierre Sagaut, Sauro Succi. I can highly recommend the lecture series üôÇ #fluid_dynamics #quantum_computing #lattice_boltzmann_methods"
