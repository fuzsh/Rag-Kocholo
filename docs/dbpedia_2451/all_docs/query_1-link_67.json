        "text": "A series of three courses from MIT on the theory and practice of quantum computation starts next week on the edX platform. One of the two instructors for the courses, which comprise videos of live lectures in the chalk and talk tradition, is Peter Shor, known for Shor's algorithm.\n\nThe aim of this course on quantum information science is to further advance knowledge and understanding in quantum information and quantum computing. It to will help participants to establish a foundation of knowledge for understanding what quantum computers can do, how they work, and how you can contribute to discovering new things and solving problems in quantum information science and engineering.\n\nPeter Shor is Morse Professor of Applied Mathematics and Chair of the Applied Mathematics Committee at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he is also affiliated with CSAIL, MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab. In 1994 he formulated the eponymous algorithm for integer factorization that runs on a quantum computer in polynomial time which is one of the topics covered in this course\n\nThe other instructor, Isaac Chuang, is Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Professor of Physics at MIT. and previously presented an advanced course Quantum Information Science II which was described in a review by a graduate student as \"hard\".\n\nThe new series of three courses Quantum Information Science I is at intermediate level can be seen as a prequel to the advanced course. The first one, 8.370.1x, is categorized as Computer Science the pre-requisites are calculus and linear algebra. The second course in the series which starts at the end of February, 8.370.2x, is categorized as Physics and you really need to have a background maths, physics and computing to make the most of the complete series which comprises:\n\n8.370.1x Starts Jan 15, 2018, 5 weeks, 11-13 hours per week\n\nFoundations of quantum and classical computing\n\nQuantum mechanics\n\nReversible computation\n\nQuantum measurement\n\n8.370.2x Starts Feb 26, 2018, 5 weeks, 11-13 hours per week Simple quantum protocols and algorithms\n\nQuantum teleportation and superdense coding\n\nThe Deutsch-Jozsa and Simon's algorithms\n\nGrover's quantum search algorithm\n\nShor's quantum factoring algorithm\n\n8.370.3x Starts t.b.a. 7 weeks, 11-13 hours per week\n\nFoundations of quantum communication\n\nModels of quantum noise and quantum channels\n\nQuantum error correction\n\nQuantum key distribution\n\nDistributed quantum protocols\n\nWhile the course has been authored by MIT faculty, support has been provided by IBM Research. As we recently reported IBM has announced prizes for Quantum Computing, an area it seems keen to promote.\n\nMore Information\n\nQuantum Information Science I\n\nRelated Articles\n\nIBM Announces Quantum Computing Prizes\n\nQuantum Physics Is Undecidable\n\nSolve The Riemann Hypothesis With A Quantum Computer\n\nA Quantum Computer Finds Factors\n\n$100,000 Prize For Proving Quantum Computers Are Impossible\n\nTo be informed about new articles on I Programmer, sign up for our weekly newsletter, subscribe to the RSS feed and follow us on Twitter, Facebook or Linkedin.\n\nGitHub Reveals Regional Variation In AI Usage\n\nAlmost all software developers in a survey covering the USA, India, Brazil and Germany have used AI tools, but company support varies by region.
