        "text": "Computer vision is a new emerging field of artificial intelligence using which machines are trained to make sense out of digital images and videos. An end solution which is directly going to benefit the producer and consumer in the cosmetics industry is planned to be developed with the help of state of art technologies like Computer Vision and Flask Framework. The solution planned is based on Image processing and comes under the banner of augmented reality. It is going to augment the cosmetics decided by the user and will apply on the face of the end user. It is beneficial for the user because it bypasses the need of physically applying the cosmetics on the face and instead can do it virtually with this solution. On the other hand it is also going to benefit the Producer because the producer doesn’t have to waste its cosmetic’s material for testing and instead can lend the consumer this product for trial of the cosmetics. In order to develop this solution the likes of Computer Visio...\n\nFrom color and type to patterns and illustrations, brands sense to be recognizable and convey their values and personality. Here patterns and color are key elements, as they can play a vital role in brand recognition. The images used for brand classification were handpicked and collectively named as HKDataset. We have explored various feature extractors used for classification and used automated classifiers named Linear SVM to achieve higher accuracy while tuning the model parameters to achieve optimal performance. It has been observed that Support Vector Machines performs better when using GIST descriptors combined with Bag of SIFT features. We hope to apply deep learning and other sophisticated classifiers to much-expanded categories of brands in the future.\n\nWith the development of the new generation of technological revolution, the manufacturing industry has entered the era of intelligent manufacturing, and people have higher and higher requirements for the technology, industry, and application of product manufacturing. At present, some factories have introduced intelligent image recognition technology into the production process in order to meet the needs of customers&#39; personalized customization. However, the current image recognition technology has limited capabilities. When faced with many special customized products or complex types of small batch products in the market, it is still impossible to perfectly analyze the product requirements and put them into production. Therefore, this paper conducts in-depth research on the improved model of product classification feature extraction and recognition based on intelligent image recognition: 3D modeling of the target product is carried out, and various data of the model are analyzed...\n\nThe paper describes the structure and the mathematical core of the decision support system developed by the authors for assessing the quality of cosmetic products based on machine learning approaches. The main goal of the study was to improve the system of quality control of cosmetic products, in particular, the quality of perfumes and cosmetics using intelligent methods of data processing, formalization of knowledge and experience of the experts, thus providing automatization of the decision-making process. The practical-oriented goal of the study was to obtain knowledge-supported decisions regarding the quality of the cosmetic products using the developed system of quality assessment based on intelligent methods of data processing, providing the possibility of unsupervised learning and adjustment of the developed system when changing final product characteristics.\n\nNamed Entity Recognition task needs high-quality and large-scale resources. In this paper, we present RENCO, a based-rules system focused on the recognition of entities in the Cosmetic domain (brandnames, product names, …). RENCO has two main objectives: 1) Generating resources for named entity recognition; 2) Mining new named entities relying on the previous generated resources. In order to build lexical resources for the cosmetic domain, we propose a system based on local lexico-syntactic rules complemented by a learning module. As the outcome of the system, we generate both a simple lexicon and a structured lexicon. Results of the evaluation show that even if RENCO outperforms a classic Conditional Random Fields algorithm, both systems should combine their respective strengths."
