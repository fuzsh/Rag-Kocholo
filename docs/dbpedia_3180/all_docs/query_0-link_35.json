        "text": "Small scale helicopters have been increasingly deployed for diverse scientific and commercial applications in the recent past. Their versatility has made them an ideal option for various missions ranging from film making, agriculture, volcanic surveillance to power line inspection. Compared to their full scale counterparts, however, the small scale helicopters posses a higher bandwidth of dynamics and a greater sensitivity to control inputs which make them more difficult to control. The paper deals with the control system design and testing for an autonomous small scale helicopter. A nonlinear dynamics model of the helicopter is derived from the Euler-Newton equations of motion. The nonlinear model is used as part of Hardware In the Loop Simulation (HILS) environment developed for the simulation, validation and testing of an autonomous control system. Linear control system is designed for the motion decoupled into longitudinal and lateral directional modes. The gains of the cascaded control architecture are optimized within the HILS environment. Various autonomous flight operations are achieved and it is demonstrated that the prediction from the simulations are in a good agreement with the flight experiment.\n\nUnmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and in particular quad-rotors are gaining an increasing interest owing to their flexibility and versatility. Today the challenge is to integrate these versatile platforms in a wide fleet in order to perform cooperative tasks as surveillance, search & rescue, inspection. The coalition formation problem is a pre-condition for cooperative missions. This problem can be solved with different methodologies from biologically-inspired algorithms to parasocial consensus sampling ones. In this paper a new framework for simulation of unmanned vehicles in cooperative scenarios is first presented. Then a novel method that exploits the benefits of Model Predictive Control (MPC) for a coalition formation problem (leader-follower) is introduced. The obtained results evidence the good performance of MPC to solve the problem of coalition formation for unmanned aerial vehicles finding the optimal solution taking into account different kind of constraints. The developed framework allows also to easily change from simulated agent to real one.\n\nThe design and experimental control of an unmanned Tilt-Rotor aerial vehicle operating in Bi-Rotor mode is presented in this article. Tilt-Rotor UAVs exhibit important flight characteristics due to their ability to fly both like a rotorcraft (in Bi-Rotor Mode) and like a fixed-wing aerial system. The ability of having a dual flight envelope makes ideal for complex missions where both the speed and flight endurance of a fixed-wing design and the hovering, aggressive maneuvering and vertical take-off/landing capabilities of a helicopter ..."
