However, I might not choose this hotel.The worst Manxin I had stayed. U can find other cheap hotels nearby. While I was checked in, the frontdesk asked me for paying upgrade. After I refused, he became impatient.He even didn't tell me hotel facilities. In hotel, You can smell smoke in hotel corridor.And I found a cigarette butt on lifting lobby. That means the hotel don't have a well management. The last thing I would like to complain is efficiency. My booking didn't include meal.Sometimes I ordered food delivery myself. The delivery didn't pass to me after it had been arrived 20 mins. I called to frontdesk. They just said they were busy at that moment. Would give it to me later. About 15 mins waiting, I decided to take the delivery myself. They put it on a easy take way, and didn't check wtih my room number or my identity.That means others can take my delivery easily.These happened three times. Because of this bad experience, I cannot trust Manxin anymore.\n\nShow more\n\n4.8/5\n\nOutstanding\n\nJJulian PeensThis is a beautiful hotel situated in the mountainous region of Beijing. The surroundings and view from the hotel are breathtaking at sunset and weather was extremely good during our stay. STAFF The staff were amount the most helpful and friendly that I have encountered in China thus far and I have been here more than five years and traveled to many destinations. They do not speak English but are very ready to use a translation APP or WeChat to communicate. The staff are very accommodating and even took special requests regarding the menu. FOOD The food was very well prepared and tasted delicious. Their menu unfortunately does not have pictures and the translations may be tricky if you are not particularly familiar with Chinese cuisine. Nevertheless, the food that we at was fresh, tasty and of high quality. We were able to BBQ by ourselves by reserving it a day in advance. The staff will also help you BBQ if needed. LOCATION The hotel is situated far from the city and a sense of comfort can be experienced knowing that you have left the hustle and bustle of the city behind. However, make sure all amenities and personal effects that you may need are with you as you cannot get same day delivery services. There were some construction vehicles which made noise occasionally in the area but I would suspect this is temporary and will soon pass. ROOM The rooms are beautiful and we experiences no dysfunctional amenities in the bedroom. The linen on the beds were crisp and clean, the room was clean upon arrival and daily cleaning is offered. Overall cleanliness was very good. The washroom area is stocked with a loofa, toothbrushes and toothpaste tubes, shampoo, shower gel, conditioner, razor, hand towels, cups and reasonable space for personal toiletries too. POOL AREA The outdoor patio looks out onto the pool. The water was well maintained and some pool toys were provided by the hotel. The pool area could use some maintenance, for example, around the stairs there are a couple loose tiles on the stair face and some ****ing around the footpath could be done. Other than this, the environment is completely mesmerising and leaves one completely relaxed. Calming music is played throughout the day at a low volume. At night, this area is well lit and the scenery beautiful. BAR The bar is well stocked with spirits but a slightly wider variety and maybe the addition of a drinks menu would definitely improve this. ROOFTOP The hotel has a rooftop deck perfect for sundowners and viewing the surrounding mountains. Tables and chairs are provided on the rooftop.\n\nShow more"
