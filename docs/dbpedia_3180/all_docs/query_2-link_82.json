        "text": "E-Book Overview\n\nDrives and Control for Industrial Automation presents the material necessary for an understanding of servo control in automation. Beginning with a macroscopic view of its subject, treating drives and control as parts of a single system, the book then pursues a detailed discussion of the major components of servo control: sensors, controllers and actuators. Throughout, the mechatronic approach – a synergistic integration of the components – is maintained, in keeping with contemporary practice.\n\nThe authors’ holistic approach does not preclude the reader from learning in a step-by-step fashion – each chapter contains material that can be studied separately without compromising understanding. Drives are described in several chapters organized according to the way they are usually classified in industry, each comprised of its actuators and sensors. The controller is discussed alongside. Topics of recent and current interest – piezoelectricity, digital communications and future trends – are detailed in their own dedicated chapters.\n\nDrives and Control for Industrial Automation is primarily written for engineers and researchers interested in the applications of sensors, actuators and control systems in the automated environment. The discussion is thorough with the basics laid out succinctly but in sufficient detail to be useful to non-expert readers so students will also find this monograph a profitable source of information.\n\nE-Book Content\n\nAdvances in Industrial Control\n\nFor other titles published in this series, go to www.springer.com/series/1412\n\nOther titles published in this series: Digital Controller Implementation and Fragility Robert S.H.

The rapid development of control technology has an impact on all areas of the control discipline. New theory, new controllers, actuators, sensors, new industrial processes, computer methods, new applications, new philosophies, . . ., new challenges. Much of this development work resides in industrial reports, feasibility study papers and the reports of advanced collaborative projects. The series offers an opportunity for researchers to present an extended exposition of such new work in all aspects of industrial control for wider and rapid dissemination. Monographs from the academic control community commonly have a strong focus on control system design, but this is only one aspect of industrial control, so it is pleasing to be able to introduce a monograph into the Advances in Industrial Control series that is concerned with a topic from the equally important area of control technology. Kok Kiong Tan and Andi Sudjani Putra from the National University of Singapore have worked for several years with industrial engineers and university students on the technology of drives and their applications. Their work has covered teaching, research, and applications, and now their experience has been captured in this comprehensive monograph Drives and Control for Industrial Automation. One focus of the book is to describe the hardware and working principles of hydraulic and pneumatic servo-drives, electric drives, and piezoelectric drives, all of which are presented and reviewed in one chapter each (Chapters 2–4, respectively). A general control system structure for these drives is then given in Chapter 5, where, being an industrially-oriented monograph, the control focus and discussion is on proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control. The use of a generic control system structure across the differing drive technologies reinforces the authors’ approach to the industrial servo-drive as a packaged unit integrating sensors, actuators (prime mover), power moderation, and control system. To incorporate such a drive unit into a process application leads naturally to a consideration of industrial process communication technology and communication protocols; these are described in Chapter 6, where the focus is on fieldbus technology. The final chapter of the book reports on recent and future trends in motion control. The key developments identified are an vii\n\nviii\n\nSeries Editors’ Foreword\n\nindustrial demand for miniaturisation and the growth of applications in the nanoand bio-technology fields. Readers seeking an entry and introduction to the prevalent devices and current methods for servo-drive technology will find this monograph quite accessible. Such readers might include final-year undergraduate students, engineering postgraduates, industrial engineers, control engineers, and technologists, typically from the fields of electrical, mechanical, aviation, and process engineering. The breadth of the contents of the monograph means that it can also be used as a reference text for servodrive technology. Whilst this monograph from K.K. Tan and A.S. Putra has the advantage of comprehensiveness, readers seeking further specialist knowledge might find the following Advances in Industrial Control series monographs useful. In the field of hydraulics, the monograph Hydraulic Servo-systems (ISBN 978-1-85233-692-9) by M. Jelali and A. Kroll, for electric motors, the new monograph Induction Motor Control Design (ISBN 978-1-84996-283-4) by R. Marino, P. Tomei, and G.M. Verrelli. In the field of piezoelectric devices, the monograph Piezoelectric Transducers for Vibration Control and Damping (ISBN 978-1-84628-331-4) by S.O.R. Moheimani and A.J. Fleming, and finally in communications, the monograph Measurement, Control and Communication using IEEE1588 (ISBN 978-1-84628-250-8) by J.C. Eidson. For PID control, the Advances in Industrial Control series offers a number of seminal texts including: Advances in PID Control (ISBN 978-1-85233-138-2) by K.K. Tan, Q.-G. Wang, and C.C. Hang with T.J. Hägglund; Precision Motion Control (ISBN 978-1-84800-020-9) by K.K. Tan, T.H. Lee, and S. Huang; Practical PID Control (ISBN 978-1-84628-585-1) by A. Visioli, and finally for something a little different, Model Predictive Control System Design and Implementation with MATLAB® (ISBN 978-1-84882-330-3) by L. Wang. Industrial Control Centre Glasgow Scotland, UK\n\nM.J. Grimble M.A. Johnson\n\nPreface\n\nIndustrial automation has become an important feature today, especially in this age of rapid production an high precision. Automation allows industries to achieve the level of speed and quality unattainable by labour power; with affordable cost. While industrial automation is mostly profitable for mass manufacturing and homogeneous products, the bulk of industries produce goods in low quantity. In this situation, the challenge shifts into developing automation systems in industry that still justifies the installation cost. The knowledge and skill on this area has therefore become increasingly necessary. This book recollects necessary materials related to servo control for industrial automation. It starts from a macroscopic view of servo control, especially for industrial automation, treating drives and control systems as inseparable entities. It then continues with detail discussions of major types of drives for precision control realization; namely servo hydraulic and pneumatic drives, electric drives, and piezoelectric drives. Each chapter contains detail discussions of the respective major components: actuators, sensors, and controllers—without going into the control theory. The techniques and theory of motion control itself is discussed in a separate chapter, considering that the control theory for all of the abovementioned drives is identical. For the same reason, digital communication protocol is also discussed in a separate chapter. This chapter is included as a recognition of the importance and growing trend of digitalization in motion and precision control. The more general trend in motion control is discussed in the closing chapter. Throughout the discussion, the integrity and nuance of mechatronics—a synergistic integration of the abovementioned components—are maintained, reflecting the reality of their synergy in today’s industrial automation. Despite its mechatronics nuance, the structure of this book allows traditional approach of step-by-step teaching to still be conducted should it be desired. Each chapter contains a material of its own that can be studied separately without compromising the understanding of the readers. This book is written for wide readership, from students, technicians, engineers, and researchers. The discussion is thorough, with concise basics yet sufficient details. Equations are provided as means to explain the certain concepts from the fundamentals such that it does not discourage inexperienced readers but is useful for those with prior knowledge. Readers who ix\n\nx\n\nPreface\n\nwish to know the applications of various sensors, actuators, and control systems in industrial automation will find this book of value. Readers will also find that the flow of the book reflects the current approach and view taken by the industry, yet is still sensible and is easy-to-read, which they can relate to the prior knowledge they have learned traditionally. The inclusion of hydraulic and piezoelectric drives, as well as control and communication, is intended to ensure that the book covers all necessary aspects in control system. The discussion in the book starts from the history and the basic principle of each device, as well as the assembled systems. The synergistic integration of actuators, sensors, control systems, and communication protocols are maintained throughout the course of the book to reflect the current trend in industrial applications. This book is intended for professionals, engineers, and postgraduate students whose areas of interest are drives, sensors, and control system design. For teaching purpose, it is most suitable to courses such as: Control System, Mechatronic System Design, Industrial Drives, and Instrumentation and Sensors. For professionals, it is most suitable for those working in system design and control, which require broad perspective of drives and control system of plants. This book is equipped with many illustrations, especially to present the working principles and structures of the abovementioned industrial systems. The combined usage of words and figures are prevalent in the entire book to convey clear concepts to the readers. This book would not have been possible without the generous assistance of many colleagues and friends. The authors would like to express their sincere appreciation to Dr. Huang Sunan, Dr. Zhao Shao, Dr. Tang Kok Zuea, and Mr. Chen Silu, who have provided invaluable materials for this book. The authors would also like to thank Mr. Oliver Jackson, Ms. Aislinn Bunning, and Ms. Charlotte Cross, who have been extremely helpful in the editing and publication of the book. Finally, we would like to dedicate the book to our families for their love and support.

of Servo Control\n\nThe term servo originates from a Latin word servus, which means servant or follower. Along this perspective, a servo control system can be defined as a system that is able to control some variables of interest to track user-specified objectives closely. While the first contribution of servo control has generally been attributed to Ktesbios of Alexandria (ca. 200 B.C.E.) [75] for his invention of water clock, the continuous history of modern servo control started on 1788, when James Watt invented the fly-ball governor to regulate the speed of a steam engine. Subsequent development and invention of devices such as flow valves and pressure regulators contributed, historically, to the emergence of the Industrial Revolution and, technologically, to the servo control technology. Besides those “hardware” inventions, mathematical techniques and control algorithms were also devised, such as stability theory by Lyapunov around 1890 and frequency-domain analysis around 1920. A major boost to the development in this field came along with World War II, when servo control was used in diverse military applications, including the precise guidance and control of missiles, tracking of military targets, and development of navigational systems. Today, servo control has become an integral part of almost every automation system or process, including in manufacturing, chemical, petrochemical, transportation, military, and biomedical. While the broad definition of servo control as mentioned above still holds, the expectations in terms of the tracking performance of servo control systems have risen significantly, in line with the ever tightening and stringent requirements associated with the products of today and the processes to achieve them. This book will focus primarily on servo control in the application domain of motion control systems, although some of the topics covered will remain applicable to other application domains such as in process control systems.\n\n1.1 Objectives of Servo Control Generally, the objective of a servo control system is to make a controlled signal follow or track a reference input signal, sometimes also called the set-point, at cerK.K. Tan, A.S. Putra, Drives and Control for Industrial Automation, Advances in Industrial Control, DOI 10.1007/978-1-84882-425-6_1, © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2011\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1 Overview of Servo Control\n\nFig. 1.1 Optimal ram velocity profile for injection molding system\n\ntain speed and accuracy, and to remain robust to keep the controlled signal on track, despite possible undesirable disturbances affecting the system. In the domain of motion control applications, servo control is concerned with the control of motion enablers, i.e. the actuators, to achieve desired motion profiles of the load to which they are attached to, in terms of direct motion variables such as proximity, position, velocity, and acceleration, or in terms of motion-induced variables such as force and torque. Disturbances to the achievement of this objective may arise in the form of load changes and the existence of motion impeding forces such as friction, backlash, and cogging forces. The reference signal of a servo control system is the command input to the servo control system. It can be specified to optimize the quality of a product or the performance of a process. Two examples will be provided to illustrate this point. Example 1.1 (Injection molding machine) The ram velocity profile of an injection molding machine affects the precision and consistency at which the plastic components are produced. The optimal profile depends on factors such as the specific resin material properties and the ram geometry, and it is typically designed and generated from computer simulation software with a model of the whole system. Figure 1.1 shows an example of a ram velocity profile. With the desired profile as the reference signal, the servo control of the injection molding system will work to force the ram velocity to track this profile with minimum offset. The velocity profile presented in Figure 1.1 is a typical ram velocity profile to fill a mold of increasing cross-section initially, and having a constant cross-section thereafter. The profile for this part can be divided into five sections. The profile in Section I is used for filling the runner, when velocity is very rapidly increased and then held constant. In Section II, the velocity is rapidly reduced to eliminate jetting at the gate. Section III corresponds to filling of the increasing cross-section portion of the cavity, while Section IV is concerned with filling of the constant cross-section portion of the cavity. Finally, the velocity is reduced in Section V to eliminate flushing and over-packing. All of the above objectives have to be achieved in the short duration of time available for mold filling [116].\n\n1.1 Objectives of Servo Control\n\n3\n\nFig. 1.2 Velocity profile for plane take-off, with rotation speed VR and lift-off speed VLOF ; (a) normal rotation, (b) slow rotation, (c) under rotation\n\nThe application as provided above in Injection molding machine is an example where the operation parameters are noncontinuous. There are also applications where continuous motion is a demand for various reasons, as presented in the example below. Example 1.2 (Flight control) An experienced pilot is able to take-off an airplane smoothly, causing minimal discomfort to the passengers and crews onboard. The velocity profile of the airplane along the runway determines how smooth the takeoff will be. Figure 1.2 shows a possible velocity profile for a smooth take-off with three typical scenarios. The pilot tracks this profile via a servo control system, either on the actual airplane or for trainee pilots via a flight simulator. The performance of a servo control system is therefore evaluated by indicators measuring how closely the objective reference signal is tracked, which is commonly based on the magnitude of the root-mean-square (RMS) tracking error over the profile. For point-to-point tracking (i.e. step change in reference signal), classical performance indicators can be used, including the rise time, overshoot, and steady state error. Figure 1.3 shows these indicators in relation to the response of the system to\n\n4\n\n1 Overview of Servo Control\n\nFig. 1.3 Classical performance indicator using step response of a system; O origin point, YSS steady-state value, YOV overshoot value, YR rising value, TR rise time, TS settling time\n\na unit step change in the reference signal. This is a typical response of a secondorder system to a step change, which causes the output to increase above the set point, oscillate for some time, and eventually settle down at a steady-state value according to the set point value. The amount of overshoot is usually indicated as a ratio of YOV − YSS , YSS − O with respect to Figure 1.3. Settling time is determined by the time required by the output to stay within a certain amount of oscillation from the steady-state value, i.e. typically within ±1% of the steady-state value. There are several ways to determine rise time, one of which is the time from 10% to 90% of the output, i.e. TR2 − TR1 .\n\n1.2 Elements of a Servo Control In this section, let us consider a flight simulator used for training a pilot. The flight simulator is designed so that it will emulate the actual situations of an airplane on the ground and in the sky, as closely as possible to match various plausible scenarios which an aspiring pilot is likely to encounter in real life. Through the simulator, the trainee, or even a professional pilot, can experience the feel of flying an airplane at hardly a fraction of the risk incurred. The flight simulator generates different motion profiles through a multipledegree-of-freedom motion platform based on kinematics and dynamics models of the actual plane, and according to the pilot commands, current plane parameters, and possible exceptional situations. This complex system is a typical system which can be realized through a delicate application of servo control technology.\n\n1.2 Elements of a Servo Control\n\n5\n\nThe flight simulator can be decomposed into several key functions, working in synchronization. The subsections to follow will briefly highlight the key components of a servo control system which will carry out these functions, with specific reference to the flight simulator. General details on these components will be covered in the subsequent chapters.\n\n1.2.1 Measurement In the cockpit, the pilot will be able to know the current flight parameters through arrays of display panels, meters, and alarms. These devices essentially display important measurements such as the current plane orientation, the current flight profile, and wind conditions. They will also show the operational status of key parts of the airplane, such as wings, ailerons, and tails and will sound/display alarm when faults and malfunctions are detected. This information is necessary for the pilot to make informed decisions on any necessary corrective actions. This measurement function is accomplished via a set of sensors and instrumentation circuits, which will collectively collect the data and convert them to a form that is amenable for display and control purposes.\n\n1.2.2 Actuation A framework of actuators is installed right below the cockpit to generate and deliver the appropriate motion profile of the entire platform according to the pilot’s commands, and also to generate and deliver the effects of varying weather conditions and turbulences. The cockpit is the load which is driven by these actuators. The means powering the actuators can be in the form of air pressure, hydraulic pressure, or an electromagnetic force, respectively the mechanisms to operate a pneumatic, hydraulic, or electromagnetic actuator. The actuators are capable of generating multiple degree-of-freedom motion to the cockpit to yield the same sense of flight to the pilot in a real airplane. Each actuator will therefore need to be controlled to such precision to create the overall effect which will emulate the real situation as closely as possible. In addition, the interaction and coupling between the individual actuators within the framework has to be adequately addressed, too. A high-performance control system will be necessary to fulfill this function.\n\n1.2.3 Power Moderation Power moderation is the intermediary function to match the pilot or control command signal to the final actuation signal for the actuator, both in form and energy\n\n6\n\n1 Overview of Servo Control\n\nlevel. The specific moderation varies considerably, depending on the overall system design. The moderation process may include amplification, conversion, or switching, depending on the overall system design, and the type and operational principle of the actuators used. The role of power moderation is to enable adequate communication among different components of the servo control system, considering that different components at different levels operate at different magnitude order. Suppose that the flight simulator uses DC electric motors for actuation, requiring a few hundreds of volts. Measurement signals from sensors, on the other hand, are usually in lower energy forms of the order of millivolts (mV). Power moderation may then involve signal amplification to amplify the measurement signal to a few volt level to be processed by a computer or be displayed on a meter, and then to the hundreds of volt level to drive the motors. Amplification does not only apply to electrical signals; there are also pneumatic and hydraulic amplifiers. For different types of actuators, such as pneumatic, hydraulic, or AC motors, other kinds of moderation may be necessary to convert the control signal to an alternate signal form which is needed to operate these actuators. AC motors, for example, may also require phase matching for their operation. Apart from amplification, other common moderation includes current-to-voltage conversion, currentto-pressure conversion, signal switching, and signal chopping.\n\n1.2.4 Control The control function in a servo control system is the core function which helps to integrate all other functions. Essentially, it generates and transmits the specific motion commands to the power moderator. From the cockpit of the flight simulator, the pilot can give instructions and commands via the control panel on target flight parameters to achieve, such as speed and flight path. The motion commands can be directly transmitted to the power moderator, so that the pilot directly controls the actuators. Alternatively, the motion command can serve as the reference signal or set-point for an automatic control system. In this case, the trainee pilot may only need to specify the target speed and flight path, and the automatic control system uses the specifications to manipulate the actuators based on the feedback measurements. While the first case is called open-loop control, the latter case is called closed-loop control. Apart from executing pilot commands for standard actions related to take off, landing, turning, and maneuvering, the control system will also need to respond adequately to exceptional conditions such as head wind, turbulence, storms, heavy rain, or even malfunction of some parts of the simulator. From a control system perspective, these are the disturbances which may disrupt the otherwise well-controlled systems. Thus, apart from tracking and executing commands, the control system in a flight simulator has to remain robust to the disturbances which a plane may experience.\n\n1.2 Elements of a Servo Control\n\n7\n\nFig. 1.4 Servo control system; xr reference signal, e error, u control signal, xd disturbance, y output\n\n1.2.5 Putting Them All Together These various components are now ready to be fit in place together to result in a complete system. Figure 1.4 presents the integration of these components in a simple control system; in reality, however, the servo control system may adopt more complex structures as will be covered in Chapter 5. A reference signal or command is input into the system as the desired motion profile to be achieved. This command can be an input from the pilot or, in the case of an autopilot system, one from a higher-level supervisory control system. The present output of the system is the controlled motion variable, and it can be measured by sensors to yield the feedback signal. This feedback signal is then compared to the reference signal, the difference of which is the error signal. Based on the error signal, the controller will output a necessary control signal to the actuator, via the power moderator, so as to drive the load according to the desired motion profile. In addition, disturbance signals Xd are also highlighted in Figure 1.4, representing the effects of extraneous signals seeping into the loop. The environment alone will expose the system to various conditions, which can be unpredictable. Disturbances, if not adequately compensated for, can cause the controlled variable to deviate from the reference signal. For example, due to tail wind, the plane can be accelerated beyond the desired profile. With a feedback controller, the control action will have to be reduced to bring the plane back on track. The four key functions of a servo control system will be covered in detail in subsequent chapters. Collectively, the overall system, integrating these functions, is also often referred to as a servo drive. It will be a hydraulic servo drive if hydraulic pressure is used as the mean for actuation, or an electric servo drive if an electromotive force is used. However, it is important to clarify that this is not necessarily a universal definition of drive. To some manufacturers, the term drive may exclude the actuation function. In this book, however, the full system is referred to as the drive.\n\nChapter 2\n\nServo Hydraulic and Pneumatic Drive\n\nAmong the various drives available, the hydraulic drive ranks at the forefront in terms of application history. The history of hydraulic power dated to the beginning of civilization, where artefacts show the applications of water turbines in power generation [132]. However, more significant progress in this field is generally achieved following Pascal’s pioneering work which was later known as Pascal’s law of hydrostatic. Bernoulli’s discovery of the hydrodynamic law in 1750, and the Industrial Revolution in 1850 further catalysed the development of servo hydraulic drives. They led to the first applications of hydraulic equipment as a power source to power industrial machines such as the press, the crane, and the jack, as they also contributed to the development of hydraulic pumps, driven by steam engines, which produce hydraulic energy to run hydraulic systems. In the early 20th century, a revolutionary design of hydraulic drives used the oil, instead of water, as the hydraulic liquid, which greatly expanded the applications of hydraulic drives to more devices. World War II also contributed to the development of hydraulic drives, especially in the development of submarine control systems, radar/sonar drives, and military cargo transportation. Hydraulic drives are still being used today, and, in fact, their applications are expanding to loads of increasing mass and power requirements, yet with higher speed and control precision. The main attraction of a hydraulic drive is its high power-toweight ratio, rendering it the natural servo drive to use for heavy applications found in the aircraft and space shuttle. Moreover, it possesses several desirable characteristics such as accuracy, flexibility in applications, and simplicity of operations, as it also allows for fast, smooth, and precise start, stop, and reversal actions.\n\n2.1 Overview of Servo Hydraulic and Pneumatic Drive Hydraulics has been around in human civilization since the ancient times. Historical records provide evidence that water mills had been used around 100 B.C.E. Another remarkable invention was a screw pump developed by ancient Greek’s Archimedes around 300 B.C.E. The invention of water clock by Ktesbios around 250 is regarded K.K. Tan, A.S. Putra, Drives and Control for Industrial Automation, Advances in Industrial Control, DOI 10.1007/978-1-84882-425-6_2, © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2011\n\n9\n\n10\n\n2\n\nServo Hydraulic and Pneumatic Drive\n\nFig. 2.1 Configuration of a servo hydraulic drive\n\nnot only as a remarkable invention in the field of hydraulic system, but also in the field of servo control. The development of the theoretical foundation of hydraulics and pneumatics is spearheaded by Sir Isaac Newton with his viscosity theory, Daniel Bernoulli with his Bernoulli’s equation, and Blaise Pascal with his Pascal’s law. The main events that boosted significantly the development of servo hydraulic and pneumatic drive were the Industrial Revolution and World War II. During the time of Industrial Revolution, the interest of using fluid power was growing rapidly, creating many inventions such as various pumps, mills, and steam engines. This provided a fertile ground for the development of pneumatic power system around 1900. World War II further accelerated the advancement of fluidic power system with the need to develop more powerful military aircrafts. Pneumatic drive proved to be the answer to this demand since it allowed the replacement of the cable-operated flight control, thereby allowing the pilot to operate the aircraft with a push of a button. This in turn enhanced the development of civil aviation technologies, whose working principles have been applied to less sophisticated system such as doormechanism in public transportation. Hydraulic and pneumatic systems share many similarities in terms of working principle and theoretical foundation; further discussed in Section 2.2. From this point onward, the term servo fluidic drive will be used to refer to both servo hydraulic drive and servo pneumatic drive. A servo fluidic drive comprises several fluidic components which work in unison to deliver the functions highlighted in Chapter 1. A typical configuration of a servo hydraulic drive is shown in Figure 2.1, while that of pneumatic drive is shown in Figure 2.2. In a hydraulic system, the primary power source, usually an electric motor, powers a hydraulic pump, which in turn generates a flow of the hydraulic liquid through a web of pipes, tubes, valves, and other hydraulic components, to a hydraulic actuator (a hydraulic motor or a hydraulic piston). The actuator will, in turn, drive the load. After transmitting the energy to the actuator, the hydraulic liquid will be returned to the reservoir to be recirculated by the pump. In a pneumatic system, a similar process also takes place via a pneumatic compressor, followed by a web of\n\n2.2 Fundamentals of Hydraulic and Pneumatic Drives\n\n11\n\nFig. 2.2 Configuration of a servo pneumatic drive Table 2.1 Comparison of characteristics of hydraulic and pneumatic drives Hydraulic drive\n\nPneumatic drive\n\nInstantaneous reaction\n\nDelayed reaction\n\nHold load without unwanted movement\n\nHold load with some unwanted movement\n\nProvide significant lubrication and cooling\n\nProvide limited lubrication and cooling\n\nMore complicated design\n\nLess complicated design\n\nMore expensive\n\nLess expensive\n\nPose environmental problems (oil leakage)\n\nNo environmental problems\n\npneumatic circuitry similar to that of its hydraulic counterpart before powering up an actuator to finally drive the load. The part of the drive within the dotted box is referred to as the hydraulic/pneumatic circuit, where the specific configuration depends on the fluidic characteristic required in each application. Common fluidic circuits will be presented in Section 2.4. In a servo fluidic drive, sensors and transducers are also installed to yield the measurement signals for the controller. The controller will manipulate the controllable components in the fluidic circuit to achieve the control objectives.\n\n2.2 Fundamentals of Hydraulic and Pneumatic Drives Hydraulics is the principle of transmitting energy using liquids to achieve useful work. It shares many similarities with pneumatics, which uses gases to transmit energy. Collectively, liquids and gases are also called fluids, both of which exhibit a flow tendency when there is a pressure difference between two points along the flow path. The main difference between liquids and gases lies in their compressibility; liquids are incompressible while gases are compressible. This difference influences the characteristics of a hydraulic and a pneumatic drive, and in turn, the applications suitable for each of the drives. Table 2.1 presents the main difference between hydraulic and pneumatic drives.\n\n12\n\n2\n\nServo Hydraulic and Pneumatic Drive\n\nWhen a fluidic drive is complemented with a control system to achieve better performance, it becomes a servo fluidic drive. A servo fluidic drive measures its own outputs and takes control action so as to force the outputs to quickly and accurately follow a given command signal.\n\n2.2.1 Basic Definitions and Principles Below are fundamental definitions and concepts pertaining to fluidic drives. 2.2.1.1 Weight and Weight Density Since fluid has mass, it also has weight due to gravity. The SI unit of weight is kg·m/s2 . Weight w is defined as follows: w = mg,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere m is mass, and g is acceleration due to gravity. The ratio of weight to volume is called weight density s and is a characteristic of fluids. It is defined as follows: w s= , (2.2) V where V is volume. Most hydraulic liquids—the ones used in hydraulic systems—have a weight density of about 880–930kg/m3 . 2.2.1.2 Pressure Pressure p is defined as the force applied per unit area, as follows: F (2.3) p= , A where F is force, and A is area. The SI unit of pressure is N/m2 or equal to Pascal (Pa), although the bar (equal to 105 Pa) is also commonly used. Since every component in a fluidic drive has a fixed area, pressure is equivalently the resultant force to produce useful work. Therefore, a variation of actuator force or shaft torque is achieved by a variation of the fluidic pressure. 2.2.1.3 Flow Rate Flow rate refers to the volume of moving fluid per unit time. Variation of flow rate in a fluidic circuit results in variation of rod velocity or shaft speed. Flow rate is related to pressure, in the sense that flow is the result of pressure difference in a system. Likewise, without flow there cannot be pressure rise in a system. The SI unit of flow rate is m3 /s.\n\n2.2 Fundamentals of Hydraulic and Pneumatic Drives\n\n13\n\n2.2.1.4 Pascal’s Law Pascal’s law is a very important principle in fluidics since it describes quantitatively how fluid transmits power in the form of pressure. Pascal’s law can be stated as follows: Pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished in all directions. Pascal’s law is often formulated in the form of the following equation: F1 F2 = , A1 A2\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere index 1 and index 2 denote object 1 and object 2, respectively. This equation essentially explains that heavy load can be lifted with small force using fluidics. In hydraulic drives, the operating pressure ranges from 1MPa to 40MPa, while some special applications may require operating pressures as high as 70MPa. A higher operating pressure can deliver the same amount of power at a reduced equipment size and weight, desirable characteristics for many applications.\n\n2.2.1.5 Bernoulli’s Equation Bernoulli’s equation is another important equation in fluidic circuit analysis. While Pascal’s law describes the behaviour of static fluids, Bernoulli’s equation explains the behaviour of dynamic/moving fluids. Bernoulli’s equation can be stated as follows: f1 + p1 + h1 = f2 + p2 + h2 ,\n\n(2.5)\n\nwhere f is flow, and h is elevation. Bernoulli’s equation relates to the conservation of energy in a fluidic system. All three terms in the equation relates to different forms of energy, which depend on the liquid’s flow rate, pressure, and position, respectively.\n\n2.2.1.6 Bulk Modulus Bulk modulus is the measure of fluid incompressibility, where higher bulk modulus means higher incompressibility. Bulk modulus B is defined as p , where p is pressure change, and is volume strain. The bulk modulus of a fluid changes with pressure and temperature. B =−\n\n(2.6)\n\n14\n\n2\n\nServo Hydraulic and Pneumatic Drive\n\n2.2.1.7 Boyle’s Law This law is strictly valid for gases, although it is relevant to the discussion of the accumulator of a hydraulic drive. Boyle’s law states that gases obey the following relationship: p1 V1 p2 V2 = , T1 T2\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhere T is temperature. According to this law, under constant temperature, pressurization brings about compression, and compression brings about pressurization.\n\n2.2.1.8 Viscosity Viscosity is a concept which is especially useful in hydraulic systems. Theoretically, viscosity is a measure of the internal resistance of a liquid to shear and hence to flow. Lower viscosity signifies that the fluid can flow more easily. Although the concept of viscosity is simple, the formulation is more complicated compared to other parameters. There are two measures of viscosity: • absolute viscosity, defined as the force required to move a flat plane of one unit area, separated by a liquid by one unit distance apart from a fixed plane, at one unit velocity; measured in centipoises (cP) • kinematic viscosity, defined as absolute viscosity divided by its mass density; measured in centistokes (cS) The measurement of viscosity is conducted with a Saybolt viscosimeter. This device comprises of an inner chamber containing sample liquid and an outer chamber containing standard liquid. A standard orifice is located at the bottom of the inner chamber. The measurement is done by letting the sample liquid fill a standard 60cm3 container through the orifice. The time (in seconds) to complete the filling is recorded as Saybolt Universal Seconds (SUS), which is the official unit of viscosity. The viscosity of a liquid depends on the temperature. As the temperature increases, the viscosity decreases. Liquid’s viscosity change with respect to temperature change is measured as viscosity index (VI). Oil with a low VI is more sensitive to changes in temperature.\n\n2.2.2 Hydraulic Liquid Hydraulic liquid plays a very important role in a hydraulic drive since it serves as the medium to transmit the power from the power source to the intended load in a manner according to the application requirements. In the early history of hydraulic drives, water was used as the hydraulic liquid due to its wide availability. However, with the ever strengthening requirements for higher pressure following the industrial\n\n2.2 Fundamentals of Hydraulic and Pneumatic Drives\n\n15\n\nrevolution, the constraints with using water and problems relating to oxidation and corrosion can no longer be tolerated. Since the early 20th century, oil has replaced water as the transmission medium in hydraulic drives. Hydraulic drives are designed to operate with a hydraulic liquid having a specified range of viscosity. When a drive is operated with a liquid which has viscosity above the tolerance band, the following problems may occur: • • • • • •\n\ndifficulty in starting-up stiff/sluggish operations cavitation in the pump accelerated wear of pump sticky valves and higher pressure drop higher temperature and power consumption\n\nOn the other hand, when a liquid with a viscosity below the tolerance band is used, the following problems may arise: • internal and external leakage • slow and irregular operations of the actuators • reduction in lubrication Apart from the hydraulic properties, the chemical properties of the hydraulic liquid are also important features governing the ruggedness of a hydraulic drive. While adequate hydraulic properties will ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of a hydraulic drive, adequate chemical properties will ensure that the components of the drive will not be unduly damaged or corroded over prolonged operations. Typical chemical properties to be observed include the degree of oxidation, water content, and degree of contamination. Over prolonged time, these properties may change. Various tests are available to check the condition of the hydraulic liquid, e.g. the Fluid Analysis Test and the Particle Analysis Test. These tests will help to determine if the key properties of the hydraulic liquid have deteriorated to a level which will necessitate a replacement.\n\n2.2.3 Benefits of Fluidic Drives Fluidic drives have remained an option for motion generation and power generation, despite the wide availability of electric drives. This is even more so in the case of hydraulic drives due to their ability to deliver higher power. Advantages of the fluidic drives are as follows: • higher power-to-weight ratio, compared to a servo electric drive • fluid acting simultaneously as a lubricant and coolant, apart from a power transmitter; a distinct feature of fluidic drives • flexible in nature, i.e. ability to operate under continuous or noncontinuous conditions, at variable (and reversible) speed, with step-less variations\n\n16\n\n2\n\nServo Hydraulic and Pneumatic Drive\n\n• ability to be stalled (e.g. in the case of overloading) without affecting the whole system, with simple circuitry • both linear and rotational actuators available • flexibility for interconnection of various fluidic components • low maintenance cost Disadvantages of the hydraulic drives are as follows: • not readily available, compared to electric power • costly and complicated installation, compared to mechanical or electrical system Even when fluidic drives have been selected as the driving mechanisms, there are considerations in choosing whether to use hydraulics or pneumatics based on their characteristics. For example, fluidic actuators incur a shorter response time; an important consideration in applications where time precision is critical. In terms of safety, hydraulic liquid poses fire, explosion, contamination, and leakage hazards; rendering requirements of continuous maintenance of hydraulic liquid. Due to their incompressibility, hydraulic drive has poor damping characteristics. Also, hydraulic drive is sensitive to leakage, filtration, and contamination.\n\n2.3 Components of Fluidic Drives Systems The components of a hydraulic drive can be represented by symbols. These symbols are commonly used in circuit diagram, which represents the connections of components in the system. Commonly used symbols of fluidic components are presented in Figure 2.3.\n\n2.3.1 Primary Power Source The primary power source normally consists of a prime mover, e.g. an electric motor, serving as the energy source of the fluidic drive. This component typically drives hydraulic pumps in the hydraulic drives or pneumatic compressors in the pneumatic drives.\n\n2.3.2 Hydraulic Pump The hydraulic pump converts mechanical energy into hydraulic energy, which can then be transmitted by the hydraulic liquid to the actuators (hydraulic motors or pistons). In practice, the pump also generates pressure due to hydraulic resistance of other components in the system, thereby maintaining the flow. The input energy source is usually an electric motor.\n\n2.3 Components of Fluidic Drives Systems\n\nFig. 2.3 Common symbols of fluidic components\n\n17\n\n18\n\n2\n\nServo Hydraulic and Pneumatic Drive\n\nPumps can be classified based on the variability of the internal volume. Fixed pump refers to a pump with a fixed internal volume such that it always delivers the same flow rate of hydraulic liquid. Variable pump, on the contrary, has a variable internal volume, and hence it allows a variable flow rate of the hydraulic liquid. Pumps can also be classified into positive displacement and nonpositive displacement pumps. Positive displacement pumps operate by displacing an amount of liquid from the low-pressure chamber (suction side) to the high-pressure chamber (delivery side) using its respective impeller, i.e. vane for vane pump, tooth for gear pump, etc. The flow is generated by varying the physical size of the pumping chamber, which has a larger volume for lower-pressure chamber and a smaller volume for higher-pressure chamber, so that the liquid is expelled at the high-pressure chamber accordingly. Inlet and outlet valves are installed at the inlet and outlet port, respectively, which is necessary to prevent a backward flow. Furthermore, since the operational pressure can be very high, sealing is important to prevent leakage. Valves and sealing increase the complexity of the construction of a positive displacement pump, and as such these parts have become the common sources of pump faults. Nonpositive displacement pumps are generally used for generating large flow volume at low pressure. Examples of nonpositive displacement pumps are the centrifugal pump and the axial propeller pump. Pumps used in hydraulic drives are positive displacement pumps, due to the requirement to generate and maintain a large pressure (typically up to about 13MPa) and high power at a specific certain flow rate.\n\n2.3.2.1 Types of Positive Displacement Pumps Examples of positive displacement pumps include gear pump, gerotor pump, screw pump, vane pump, and piston pump. In the selection of a pump for use in the hydraulic drive, several factors should be considered, including the load characteristics (e.g. the flow rate), the pump characteristics (e.g. the operational pressure), speed of the power source, cost, reliability, maintenance, noise generated, and the environmental condition. 1. Gear pump In an external gear pump, the pumping action is accomplished by a pair of gears meshed together on their external sides, where one gear is keyed to the motor shaft. As the electric motor drives the pump, the liquid enters the pump through the inlet port, and the teeth of the pump cause the liquid to circulate through the outer diameter of the gears. The liquid is then displaced to the higherpressure chamber and leaves the pump through the outlet port. Teeth mesh prevents the liquid from bypassing the pump through the inner diameter. Figure 2.4 presents the construction and working principle of external gear pump. In an internal gear pump, the pair of gears is meshed on their internal sides instead, where the inside gear is keyed to the motor shaft. The centres of the two gears are then not aligned, although they are parallel. This creates a variation of physical volume of the pumping chamber, allowing positive displacement action\n\n2.3 Components of Fluidic Drives Systems\n\n19\n\nFig. 2.4 External gear pump (thin arrow for low pressure, thick arrow for high pressure)\n\nto take place. As the electric motor drives the pump, the liquid enters the pump and circulates along the pumping chamber. The displacement of the liquid from the larger chamber to the smaller chamber creates a liquid flow which effectively increases the pressure of the liquid. Similar to other gear construction, gear pump, which typically uses spur gear, is not balanced. The lateral force created by the mesh of the gear creates a side force on the gears and shaft, thus reducing the pressure and speed at which the pump can be operated. 2. Gerotor pump The construction of a gerotor pump is rather similar to the internal gear pump, except that it has several, instead of only one, pumping chambers. The number of the internal teeth is one less than that of the external teeth and equal to the number of pumping chambers. The idea of the design of gerotor pump is to combine the characteristics of external and internal gear pumps. The profile of the teeth is designed inwards, so they can also act as the seal. 3. Screw pump The pumping action is accomplished by a screw, which displaces the liquid axially through the pumping chamber. The helical profile of the screw causes the liquid to be displaced without generation of a lateral force, although axial force is present. This is one desirable feature of screw pump, apart from its noiseless operations. 4. Vane pump A vane pump comprises of vanes, rotor, and cam ring. The pumping action is accomplished by the vanes, which are installed in an eccentric rotor. The rotation of the rotor, driven by a primary power source, causes the vanes to slide radially, and thereby varying the volume of the pumping chamber. When the volume increases, the liquid enters the pumping chamber due to suction effect. When the volume decreases, the liquid inside the chamber is forced to a high pressure and ejected out of the pump.\n\n20\n\n2\n\nServo Hydraulic and Pneumatic Drive\n\nFig. 2.5 Vane pump (thin arrow for low pressure, thick arrow for high pressure)\n\nFig. 2.6 Piston pump\n\nDue to its eccentric design, the performance of the pump can be significantly affected. To reduce this effect, a balancing mechanism is usually implemented to the pump. This includes the inlet and outlet port arrangement, intra-vane, and dual vanes. A variable displacement vane pump employs an unbalanced design. This is achieved by adjusting the eccentricity between the cam ring and the rotor. Figure 2.5 presents the construction and working principle of vane pump. 5. Piston pump In a radial piston pump, the pistons are located around the pump shaft at right angles, i.e. along the pump’s radius. Each piston is seated on a roller or a sliding shoe, while each roller is located on a common cam. The rotation of the cam, along with the pump shaft, will then reciprocate the pistons movement inside the bore cylinder. When the piston moves toward the centre (suction), the liquid from the low pressure chamber will be drawn into the cylinder. When the piston moves away from the centre (discharge), the liquid from the cylinder will be discharged into the high-pressure chamber. Figure 2.6 presents the construction and working principle of radial piston pump. As the shaft of the pump turns, the liquid flows into the pump through the low-pressure inlet. The inclined plate pushes the piston out, pressurising the liquid out of the pump through the high-pressure outlet. The amount of outlet pressure is adjustable via the angle of the inclined plate. Figure 2.6(a) provides maximum pressure with maximum angle (denoted with thick arrow), which can be reduced by flatting the angle as presented by Figure 2.6(b), with complete flat plate results in zero pressure build-up as in Figure 2.6(c).\n\n2.3 Components of Fluidic Drives Systems\n\n21\n\nIn an axial piston pump, the pistons are fixed in parallel around the pump, each of them seated on a shoe that is attached to a common swash plate. The swash plate is installed at an inclined angle with respect to the shaft. With the rotation of the shaft, the swash plate will reciprocate the movement of the pistons. The reciprocation of the pistons inside the cylinder will alternately draw and discharge the liquid, creating a pumping action.\n\n2.3.2.2 Boost Pump In a large hydraulic drive, an additional pump may be installed to assist the main pump. This additional pump, which is called boost pump, is installed before the main pump (between reservoir and main pump) with the following responsibilities: • to fill the circuit with oil in initial operation • to replace oil lost due to internal leakage during operation Boost pump is usually a small, fixed displacement pump, driven directly from the main pump. In many cases, the boost pump is housed within the same installation as the main pump.\n\n2.3.2.3 Performance Indicators of the Pump A key indicator of the performance of the hydraulic pump is measured by its efficiency, which is defined as follows: η=\n\nPfluid , Pinput\n\n(2.8)\n\nwhere Pfluid represents the output fluidic power, and Pinput represents the input power to the pump, which is usually electrical power. The flow rate of the pump, defined as the volume of the pumped liquid per unit time, is also an important indicator of the pump performance. Possible factors which may lower the pump efficiency include: • mechanical friction within the pump • internal leakage of the liquid in the pump • friction between the liquid and the pump components A pump performance can deteriorate over time. Improper operating conditions in a hydraulic drive may result in pump cavitation. Pump cavitation occurs when the local pressure of the pump falls below the vapor pressure of the liquid, causing the liquid to start vaporizing and creating bubbles. Cavitation can be caused by: • inadequate suction pressure • poorly designed inlet port • incorrect pump selection\n\n22\n\n2\n\nServo Hydraulic and Pneumatic Drive\n\nThe effects of cavitation are far reaching. Bubbles which are formed in the lowpressure region can move to the high-pressure region, disintegrate in this region, yielding a counter force in this region as a consequence, which can lead to severe erosion of the pump.\n\n2.3.3 Hydraulic Motor The hydraulic motor will convert the hydraulic energy from the hydraulic liquid back into mechanical energy in the form of shaft rotation, hence producing torque and speed. Various types of hydraulic motor are available, such as radial piston, axial piston, gear, and vane motor. Depending on the design, the hydraulic motor has an ability to rotate in both the clockwise and counterclockwise directions. The operation principle of hydraulic motor is exactly the reverse of a positive displacement pump. Hydraulic liquid enters the high-pressure chamber through the inlet port and pushes the energy converter component (which can be vane, piston, etc., depending on the type of the pump), which in turn rotates the motor shaft. The hydraulic liquid will then leave the motor from the outlet port with reduced pressure. Like hydraulic pumps, fixed and variable motors are available, allowing adjustment of speed and torque according to the load condition. The construction of a hydraulic motor determines the performance of the motor. Table 2.2 shows the different motor designs, their characteristics and benefits.\n\n2.3.3.1 Types of Hydraulic Motors Common types of hydraulic motors include the gear motor, the gerotor motor, the vane motor, and the piston motor. 1. Gear motor The construction of gear motor is very similar to a gear pump. A pair of gears is meshed onto each other, with one gear keyed to the output shaft. High-pressure liquid enters the motor and circulates around the outside of the gear teeth, since the inside is blocked by the mesh of the gear teeth. The circulation of the liquid from the high-pressure port to the low-pressure port around the outside diameter of both gears rotates the gear and, in turn, the shaft keyed to it. The favourable features of a gear pump is its high efficiency of up to 90%, speed range of up to 20,000rpm, power of up to 4kW; all these accomplished within a small size. Figure 2.7 presents the construction and working principle of gear motor. 2. Gerotor motor Gerotor motor operates in the exactly reversed way of a gerotor pump. The liquid enters the motor and moves into the chamber between the inner and outer gears. The high pressure of the liquid impels the gear and causes the motor to rotate, while at the same time displaces the liquid to a low-pressure chamber.\n\n2.3 Components of Fluidic Drives Systems\n\n23\n\nTable 2.2 Motor designs, characteristics, and benefits Design\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBenefits\n\nCam design\n\nMultiple stroke, large displacement\n\nHigh torque per weight (inertia) ratio\n\nEven number of pistons\n\nMain bearing unloaded from radial piston forces\n\nLong service life of bearing\n\nOptimal cam geometry\n\nConstant torque, no ripple, no pressure pulsation\n\nHigh torque, no contamination entering housing\n\nCam roller, solid, balanced\n\nReduced motor diameter\n\nLong service life\n\nGuide plate\n\nPistons unloaded from side forces, no stick slip\n\nLimited piston bore wear\n\nSide guide roller bearing\n\nNo stick slip\n\nHigh mechanical efficiency\n\nOil distributing plate\n\nLow volumetric loss\n\nHigh volumetric efficiency, good low-speed performance, low noise level\n\nPiston ring\n\nLow volumetric loss\n\nImprove volumetric efficiency\n\nStationary motor housing with torque arm\n\nCompact design\n\nMotor bed plate eliminated\n\nRotating cylinder block with hollow shaft\n\nCompact design, no key ways\n\nEase in mounting\n\nThrough-hole in centre shaft\n\nAir venting\n\nSimplify mounting, possibility for cable through the motor\n\nFig. 2.7 Gear motor (thin arrow for low pressure, thick arrow for high pressure)\n\nContacts between teeth of inner and outer gears provide the seal between adjacent chambers.

Vane motor The difference between the construction of a vane pump and a vane motor is the presence of a spring in vane motor to maintain the contact between the vanes and the cam ring. The liquid that enters the motor provides a high pressure and hence exerts a high force, against the vane. This causes rotation of the shaft, which is attached to the vanes. Figure 2.8 presents the construction and working principle of vane motor. 4. Piston motor In a radial piston motor, the pistons are arrayed in a radial construction, each of which is pressed against a cam roller. All cam rollers push against a cam ring that is keyed on the motor shaft. Piston ring is installed on every piston to prevent leakage. When the liquid, at high pressure, enters the piston bore, force is generated in the contact between the cam roller and cam ring along the tangential direction with respect to the shaft. This force produces torque and therefore rotates the shaft. While the role of the piston is to convert hydraulic energy into mechanical energy and the cam ring is to produce rotation, the role of the cam roller is to help absorbing the lateral force reaction against the piston, thereby increasing its efficiency. A torque arm is usually installed to anchor the motor within a static frame in order to prevent undesirable motor body rotation. Radial piston motor is usually used in heavy duty applications, e.g. crane hoisting, rolling mills, and railroad transportation. This is mainly because of its capability to sustain high radial and axial loads with short housing and length. Figure 2.9 presents the construction and working principle of piston motor, which is essentially the reverse of piston pump. As the high-pressure liquid flows into the motor, it pushes the piston, which in turns hits the inclined plate; thereby rotating the shaft. The liquid then flows out of the motor through low-pressure outlet. The output torque of the motor is adjustable via the angle of the inclined plate; high torque in Figure 2.9(a) with steep angle, moderate torque in Figure 2.9(b) with less angle, and no-torque in Figure 2.9(c) with flat angle. In an axial piston motor, as the name suggests, pistons are arrayed axially, each of which is pressed against a roller. All rollers push against a swash plate, instead of a cam ring, which is installed with an inclination angle with respect to the shaft. When the high-pressure liquid enters the piston bore, a tangential force is generated in the contact between the roller and the swash plate, which\n\n2.3 Components of Fluidic Drives Systems\n\n25\n\nFig. 2.9 Piston motor\n\nwill produce a torque and a shaft rotation. Adjustment of swash plate inclination angle allows a variation of the rotation speed; thus this kind of motor is also known as a variable hydraulic motor. In a large hydraulic motor, which is usually required to handle a high load, double banks of pistons and their subsequent components are installed to yield a larger torque. The rotation, however, remains unchanged. The distribution of liquid to the right piston is important to ensure proper operation of the motor. This is accomplished via valve plates installed in the inlet port, equipped with port timing. Also, in a double direction motor, a right-left connection is provided in the inlet port to allow the motor to operate in clockwise and counterclockwise directions. Piston motor can also be used as a pump if the mechanical energy is applied to the output shaft; this device is commonly called the pump-motor. This is a flexibility the piston motor construction has to offer.\n\n2.3.3.2 Performance Indicators of Hydraulic Motors The performance of a hydraulic motor can be measured by indicators in terms of its torque, speed, power, and efficiency. Efficiency is a measure of how much fluid power can be converted into usable mechanical power of the shaft, as follows: Poutput η= , (2.9) Pfluid where Poutput represents shaft output power, and Pfluid represents fluid input power.\n\n2.3.4 Hydraulic Piston/Cylinder Hydraulic piston converts hydraulic energy back into mechanical energy in the form of linear motion and force. It is basically a piston contained in a cylinder, which can have one or two protruding rods out of it. While hydraulic piston is mainly for loading purpose, it can also be applied as a cushioning device as in a suspension system. The selection of a hydraulic piston is based on considerations such as the purpose of application, construction, technical requirements (force, duty cycle, action), and environmental conditions.\n\n26\n\n2\n\nServo Hydraulic and Pneumatic Drive\n\n2.3.4.1 Loading Piston The force exerted by a hydraulic piston is proportional to the liquid pressure and the cylinder’s cross section area. Therefore, a piston with rods at both ends exerts the same force in both directions, while a piston with one rod exerts a larger force in one direction due to the difference in area. Based on the activation approach, a hydraulic piston can be classified as either a single acting or a double acting piston. A single acting hydraulic piston is activated by the hydraulic liquid from one side only. On the filling side, a channel is installed to allow oil to flow into the cylinder. When the liquid is directed to flow into the cylinder, it will push the piston by virtue of its pressure, and the load will be moved accordingly. The returning action is accomplished by external force, such as spring or load gravity. Alternatively, a drain valve can be installed to empty the liquid and thereby returns the load. A double acting hydraulic piston has channels on both sides of the cylinder. These channels allow the liquid to flow into or out of the cylinder to generate motion. Depending on the direction to which the liquid is flowing, the piston will move either in forward or backward direction. A double acting piston can have one or two rods protruding out of the cylinder.\n\n2.3.4.2 Cushioning Cylinder A variation in the application of hydraulic piston is cushioning cylinder. As its name suggests, it prevents or reduces shock to the load by decelerating a moving load. A typical application of cushioning cylinder is a shock absorber. The working principle of cushioning device is to slow down the piston movement before it contacts the end of the cylinder. It uses a taper or stepped rod that enters a sleeve mounted in one end of the cylinder. Through this design, the pressure applied to the piston increases, thereby reducing its velocity.\n\n2.3.4.3 Sealing Sealing is a very important issue to address in a hydraulic drive, especially in a hydraulic piston, because of its movable component (the rod) that extends from the pressure chamber. Since the rod is movable, there is a gap between the rod and the cylinder to allow motion. However, the gap must be as small as possible to prevent leakage. Another common problem relating to sealing lies in the seal itself, when it expands due to the repetitive movement of the rod.\n\n2.3.4.4 Performance Indicators of Hydraulic Cylinder The performance of a hydraulic cylinder can be measured by its capability to generate force, which is dependent on the pressure of the liquid and the pressure area of\n\n2.3 Components of Fluidic Drives Systems\n\n27\n\nthe cylinder as follows: F = pA.\n\n(2.10)\n\nThe velocity v at which the load is moved is also an important feature and formulated as follows: f v= . (2.11) A The stroke of the cylinder determines the total movement distance, and it is also an indicator of the performance of a cylinder.\n\n2.3.5 Control Valves Control valve is a device which is used to hydraulically regulate certain parameters, such as pressure and flow. Based on the nature of control, control valves can be classified into servo valves and proportional valves; the former referring to closedloop control valves, while the latter referring to open-loop control valves. Based on their functions, they can be classified into a directional control valve (DCV), a flow control valve, or a pressure control valve.\n\n2.3.5.1 Evolution of Control Valves The first electrically operated control valve, which will later bring on the servo valve and proportional valve, was developed after World War II. This valve used a linear spool slide unit controlled by a linear motor, and it was used in aeronautics. Hydraulic pilot control was later introduced to the valve assembly via a jet flapper and jet pipe amplifier. A few years after this invention, mechanical feedback of the spool position was incorporated, yielding the servo valve. The servo valve has gained popularity mainly because of the precision and the power balancing features which it enables. From the early 1960s, there was an increasing application of servo valve in the industries; a noteworthy example was in injection molding applications. However, that servo valves had significant drawbacks: very sensitive to contamination and costly. These issues became even more significant when a large volumetric flow and rapid control are required. These issues led to the revolutionary design and the conception of the proportional valve. The control of proportional valve was done electrically by either direct control of the spool (with magnet or motor) or by hydraulic pilot control. The proportional valve soon gained popularity and wide acceptance because of its large flow rate and its robustness to contamination. Over the time, the proportional valve continued to evolve with much effort generated towards the simplification of its control equipment. It became possible to have a robust proportional control valve under servo control. This control valve is sometimes called the servo proportional valve.\n\n28\n\n2\n\nServo Hydraulic and Pneumatic Drive\n\n2.3.5.2 Fundamentals of Control Valves The key component of a control valve is a linear spool slide, whose role is to block or unblock the flow of liquid with a sliding motion. In a more advanced design, it can also regulate the flow of the liquid. In general, this component is termed throttle. One full sliding motion is called one stroke, which ranges from 0.4 to 10.0mm. The ratio of spool diameter to the stroke is from 8:1 to 15:1. As a control device, the control valve has to achieve high precision in its operations and minimize the amount of leakage occurring. The effects of leakage are: • reduced positioning accuracy • reduced power delivery and hence efficiency • introduction of higher lateral and frictional force Therefore, a control valve requires high accuracy in its manufacturing. The allowable clearance between the spool and the housing is typically up to 1:2000 or equal to a nominal separation of not more than 2µm. The material used for the valve is also special (e.g. hardened spheroidal iron) to ensure that it has a high wear resistance. The roughness of the spool and cylinder bore is typically up to 0.4µm. O-rings are used to further prevent leakage in the control valve and are usually installed on the connection holes. The connection holes of control valve are assigned with special terminology. They are usually termed P for pressure supply (pump), T for drain (tank), A, B, and so on for actuators, and X-outlet and Y-inlet for pilot control. The size and position of the connection holes are also mostly standard to promote interoperability of equipment from different manufacturers. The pressure drop across the valve is an important factor to consider in the design and selection of control valves. Pressure drop induces thermal rise (typically 5°C per 100bar) which in turn reduces efficiency and power delivery. Typically, 75% of the pressure losses occur at the variable throttle points near the maximum stroke of the valve. Pressure drops are caused by: • friction between the hydraulic liquid and the valve wall • redirection of the flow inside the valve Pressure drop is a nonlinear phenomenon (mainly saturation), and this poses a big challenge in control design, especially when high precision is a significant factor. A typical remedy of this problem is to limit the operations of the valve in the nonsaturated operation range by means of a mechanical structure. Another cause of power reduction is due to the flow resistance force, which is in turn due to the longitudinal flow of the liquid across the valve. Since the flow induces pressure, a force will be generated across the cross-sectional area of the spool, resisting the flow. The control of the valve’s spool is accomplished electrically. Several mechanisms can be used, such as plunger coil, linear motor, torque motor, or proportional magnet. This mechanism converts electrical signal into electromagnetic force that is able to put the spool in motion. Hydraulic pilot control, however, can also be used to amplify and transmit the electromagnetic force into spool motion.\n\n2.3 Components of Fluidic Drives Systems\n\n29\n\nThe operational principle of the mechanisms, which is based on the electromagnetic principle, can be briefly described as follows. When a current is applied through the armature which is contained in a magnetic field, a force is generated. Depending to the mechanical structure, this force may be transmitted directly or indirectly to the spool, resulting in a motion. The control is accomplished by adjustment of the current’s amplitude and interval. The development of electromagnetic converters contributes to the advance in valve performance. Examples of these contributions are: • new materials for magnet, e.g. samarium–cobalt and neodymium–iron–boron, which have larger specific energy • low-power plunger, with smaller size and elimination of magnetic hysteresis • combination with hydraulic amplifier to provide larger torque/force to the spool • combination of magnetic and nonmagnetic materials to direct and to concentrate magnetic flux within the air gap The spool configuration affects the flow characteristics significantly. Spool can be configured to have an open-centre or a close-centre configuration. An open-centre spool has both control ports open to return when the spool is centred, and it is typically used with fixed pumps. A close-centre spool, on the other hand, is typically used with variable pumps to form a constant pressure hydraulic circuit. In the presence of large flow resistance force which cannot be overcome satisfactorily by electromagnetic force, a hydraulic amplifier can be applied. Hydraulic amplifier generates a hydraulic force that is typically up to 10 times larger than flow resistance force. Hydraulic amplifier is included in a hydraulic pilot control installation together with the electromagnetic converter to form an integrated pilot control. An example of hydraulic amplifier is a four-edge amplifier, which corresponds to the main stage of the flow control valve. 2.3.5.3 Proportional Control Valve Proportional control valve can be controlled continuously during its operation via an electrical signal, which is activated through manual controllers (usually located in the control station), as it is controlled in an open-loop manner. This valve can direct and meter the flow of the liquid to actuators. A proportional control valve comprises of a spool as the main regulating component, housed inside a valve bore. Valve bore forms valve cavity, connected to several channels linked to actuators, pump, and reservoir (tank). The control of the valve is executed by controlling the spool electrically with various electromagnetic converters. Despite the open-loop control configuration, a feedback signal is provided from the spool to balance the action of the electromagnetic converter so that it can maintain the valve position according to the signal from the manual controller. Hydraulic amplifier may be installed to assist controlling of proportional control valve. There are several types of common proportional control valves: jet-flapper, sliding spool pilot stage, jet-pipe, and jet-deflector valve. These are elaborated as follows.\n\n30\n\n2\n\nServo Hydraulic and Pneumatic Drive\n\n1. Jet-flapper valve In a jet-flapper amplifier, two fixed and two variable throttles are arranged in a Wheatstone full-bridge; the fixed throttles are located at the upstream, and the variable throttles are located at the downstream. The flapper is arranged between the variable throttles, with its normal position in the centre. Two jets are directed towards the variable throttles. A flow channel, which houses the spool to be controlled, is connected to both fixed and variable throttles. The hydraulic liquid flow generates pressure drop at the throttle points. If the flapper is located at the centre, equal pressure drop occurs so that no force is exerted on the control spool. If the flapper is displaced, for example, towards the left jet, the cross section of the left outlet reduces while the right outlet increases. The pressure in the left branch will then increase, while that of the right branch will decrease. This pressure difference will exert a force on the spool, pushing it to the right. If the flapper is displaced to the opposite direction, an opposite effect will occur. The movement of the flapper is controlled by an electromagnetic converter, e.g. a torque motor. The armature of the converter is designed such that it has a fast dynamic response bandwidth and bidirectional control ability. A returning spring may be added to provide an even faster returning dynamic. When the spool is in motion, a balancing flow flows from one branch of the bridge to the other branch. If the flapper happens to close a jet completely, the flow of this branch can be diverted and used for the positioning velocity. An additional throttle can be installed between the variable throttles and the drain line to stabilize incoming flow from the jet. The balancing flow is proportional to the flapper position. If the actuators are blocked, no balancing flow will occur; a differential pressure will build up, instead, leading to leakage and power loss. The jet-flapper valve is mainly used in a high performance hydraulic system. 2. Sliding spool pilot stage valve This is a variation of a jet-flapper valve, except that the flow is across two meter-in and two meter-out control edges, connected to the controlling spool. The control of the valve is performed by the opening and closing of the meter-in and meter-out control edges. This valve is commonly used in a modest performance hydraulic system. 3. Jet-pipe valve In a jet-pipe amplifier, a jet-pipe with hydraulic liquid is integrated into the control element. A fluid jet flows from the pipe through a jet against two receiving holes, which are located close to each other. A connecting pipe from each of the hole leads to both ends of the controlling spool, housed in a slide unit. In the neutral position, the jet-pipe is situated at the centre, and the liquid is therefore distributed equally to both holes, creating equal pressure on the right and left of the spool. If the jet-pipe is displaced towards, for example, the left hole, more flow will be directed to this hole, creating a pressure difference on the spool and in turn moves to spool to the right. The opposite effect will occur when the jet-pipe moves towards the opposite direction. The velocity of the movement can be regulated by the displacement of the jet-pipe.\n\n2.3 Components of Fluidic Drives Systems\n\n31\n\nDue to its construction, leakage will occur in this valve, mainly at the cross section area of the holes, inducing a power loss. 4. Jet-deflector valve This is a variation of jet-pipe valve, whereby its jet is installed and fixed opposite to the two receiving holes. The control is provided by a thin jet-deflector plate, located between the jet and the holes, perpendicular to the jet flow. The jet-deflector plate is attached to the electromagnetic converter to perform the controlling action. In the neutral position, the jet-deflector plate is situated at the centre, and the liquid is therefore distributed equally to both holes, creating equal pressure on the right and left of the spool. Displacement of the jet-deflector plate towards the left will direct more flow to the left hole, creating a pressure difference on the spool and in turn moves to spool to the right. The opposite effect will occur when the jet-deflector plate moves along the opposite direction. In short, the advantages of using a proportional control valve are as follows: • accurate control of flow and direction • installation of control valve can be near the actuators to simplify piping and plumbing • reduction of fluid leakage • several options of control available, e.g. with radio control The disadvantages of using proportional control valve are as follows: • less precise positioning as it uses open-loop control • larger installation envelope Proportional control valve is designed for a small pressure drop and therefore is suitable for a power delivery application. Typically, the pressure drop is up to 10% of the rated pressure, or equal to a nominal pressure drop of 10bar, with a flow dead zone of up to 30% of the spool stroke. Therefore, nonlinearity is a significant issue in the control of proportional control valve, especially when this valve is modified to operate in a closed-loop manner. Closed-loop control can be implemented in a proportional control valve by replacing the manual controller with an electrically activated device. This is applied, for example, in a hydrostatic transmission, where manual controller is replaced by a potentiometer. Proportional control valves are now commonly applied in the industries associated with material handling, construction equipment, and steel mill.\n\n2.3.5.4 Servo Control Valve A servo control valve produces continuous controlled output via feedback control loop, as it implements a closed-loop control system. The reference signal is compared to the actual output and is used to generate control signal, resulting in a precise positioning of the valve according to the reference signal. The positioning of\n\n32\n\n2\n\nServo Hydraulic and Pneumatic Drive\n\nthe valve is accomplished by pilot flow, while the main flow of the liquid is carried out by the main ports. To increase its flow rate, the servo valve may be staged, which will provide a higher pressure to shift the spool. Because of its more complex control system, servo control valve is more expensive than proportional control valve. The pressure drop of servo control valve can be large, reaching up to 30% of the rated pressure or equal to a nominal pressure of 70bar. The flow dead zone, however, is rather negligible. It is therefore very suitable for a precision metering application, where the effects of nonlinearity must be low. Servo control valve can be used to measure various variables, such as position, velocity, pressure, or torque. The purpose of the valve determines the sensors to be used and also the controller structure. It is often required for a hydraulic drive, via its servo control valve, to satisfy the requirements relating to a number of variables simultaneously. These requirements will further increase the number of sensors needed, and complicate the controller structure. With the advance in closed-loop control technology, many options are now available to simplify the structure of the valve’s controller without sacrificing the performance. State observers, for example, can be implemented to reduce the number of sensors in an operation. The idea is to obtain a limited number of sensor signals of certain variables and then to estimate the other variables via computation.\n\n2.3.5.5 Classification of Control Valves Based on Functions Control valves can also be classified according to the function it performs in the overall system. 1. Directional control valve (DCV) As the name suggests, DCV serves as the direction controller of the liquid flow to the actuators, which can be motors or pistons. It can therefore control the direction of the actuators—whether the motor rotates in clockwise or counterclockwise direction, or whether the piston extends or retracts but cannot control the speed or velocity of actuators. In the context of DCV, the following terms are commonly used: • PORT This refers to the number of connection of a DCV to external devices. A DCV must have at least two ports; one to a pressure source (pump) and another one to an actuator. For a DCV with more than two ports, the ports may be connected to a reservoir from the drain or to other actuators. • POSITION This refers to the number of its possible position. It may theoretically be infinite if the sliding of the DCV is not restricted by its housing. • WAY This refers to the number of flow path through the valve.\n\n2.3 Components of Fluidic Drives Systems\n\n33\n\nFig. 2.10 Examples of how DCV is named Table 2.3 Comparison of hydraulic systems with an open-centre and a close-centre valve Features\n\nOpen-centre valve\n\nClose-centre valve\n\nSystem idle time\n\nLong\n\nShort\n\nTypical power source\n\nFixed pump\n\nVariable pump\n\nTime characteristic of applications\n\nTime insignificant\n\nTime critical\n\nA DCV with m ports and n positions is called an m/n DCV, as exemplified in Figure 2.10. Directing action can be accomplished through the sliding spool, ball, plate, etc. A DCV can be controlled in various manners; with respect to its control (automatically or manually), its mechanism (mechanically, electrically, or hydraulically), and its distance from the controller (remote or direct-acting). The manner through which a DCV is controlled is presented in the symbol of the DCV. When a pilot control is used in a DCV, the pilot fluid can be isolated from the hydraulic circuit and therefore permitting the usage of other substance to control the DCV. A combination of several DCVs with proximity switches can develop into a sequencing hydraulic circuit, which can run automatically to perform a periodic task. The normal position of a DCV is important to determine the nature of the system at rest, especially in an automation system. Considerations over normal position of the valve also include the configuration of open-centre and closecentre valve. An open-centre valve connects the pump and the reservoir at rest; while a close-centre valve does not. The comparison between hydraulic systems with open-centre and close-centre valve is presented in Table 2.3. 2. Flow control valve A flow control valve is used to control the flow rate of the hydraulic liquid. By controlling the flow rate of the liquid, it can effectively control the speed or velocity of the actuator. It can therefore be used as a speed control device to complement a DCV in a hydraulic system. The operational principle of a flow control valve is based on flow restriction which will alter the flow rate of the liquid. However, flow restriction may affect the temperature and pressure, which will require timely compensation to maintain the operating conditions. For modest applications, however, compensation may not be necessary. The flow rate of the liquid across a flow control valve\n\n34\n\n2\n\nServo Hydraulic and Pneumatic Drive\n\ndepends on the pressure difference, type of valve, and the characteristics of the hydraulic liquid. With pressure compensation, the flow rate can be kept constant regardless of pressure changes in the system, which may occur due to the flow"
