FO G E L\n\nThe greatest challenge of the twenty-first century is the need to come to a new understanding of China and moreover to be able to come to a true understanding of our China in comparative context. — Gan Yang, Unifying the Three Traditions (2005)\n\nThe future of China lies in rebuilding a China rich in thought, in restoring the unity of theory and practice, and in the development of values that accord with human justice. —Rong Jian, “A China Bereft of Thought” (2013)\n\nG\n\nan Yang and Rong Jian, hardly intellectual comrades-in-arms, reflect the challenges facing China and China’s intellectuals in the twenty-first century. After some forty years of post-Mao reforms, Gan Yang, an inveterate reformer who was seen as liberal in the 1990s and as some combination of leftist and Confucian in the new century, has identified the question of the day: How are China’s history and role in the world to be understood? Meanwhile, Rong Jian, an outspoken businessman intellectual (and therefore independent of the strictures of Chinese universities) challenges fellow intellectuals to provide serious moral thought for Chinese political life.\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nGan Yang calls on his readers to “unify the three traditions” of modern China (Confucian, Maoist, and Dengist liberal reform); Rong Jian taunts them for being “bereft of thought” and challenges them to contribute to a “thinking China.” With fifteen examples of thinking China, this volume shows that Gan Yang’s and Rong Jian’s hopes have not been in vain. These essays are from some of the best minds in China today thinking about China—Where has it come from? What is it today? What should it be in the future? Chinese scholars, having benefitted from China’s openness to the world and the relative relaxation of political pressure in China (until recently), have much to say about China and the world that merits our attention. They disagree with each other, and their debates throw light not only on these key questions for understanding China itself but also on its role in the world. The disagreements as well as the underlying shared assumptions of these thoughtful and fractious public intellectuals provide a rich and complex understanding of China today and its role in our future. We have selected writings that we, the editors, in conjunction with our Chinese colleagues, feel capture the diversity of intelligent opinion about just what is or should be the “China Dream.” The selection of texts translated in this volume reflects our commitment to Chinese voices over our North American concerns or preferences. Over the course of a five-year project, we engaged with our Chinese colleagues to find out which writers and texts they feel are important.1 Scholars and writers in Shanghai and Beijing, of course, hardly constitute the full range of Chinese opinion, but they do include thoughtful and open-minded intellectuals, some of them well known in the public sphere. They responded with diligence and grace—as well as with arguments among themselves and with the non-Chinese members of our project—to the challenge of representing as wide a range of intellectual perspectives as could be achieved, especially including standpoints with which they personally disagreed. The first result of the project was a series of five collaboratively drafted mappings of the intellectual public sphere in China today published in China Information in 2018.2 This book and other translations from our project are the next result of this collaboration. These translations are voices from the Chinese century and offer the careful reader an opportunity to enter the world of intellectual debate inside China today on fundamental questions of politics and society. For Western readers, the selections from Liberal voices will likely be most familiar, though for those with progressive commitments some of the leftist voices will resonate. However, several of these texts may surprise readers, at least at first inspection. How, for example, is a eulogy for a disillusioned Communist Party intellectual (Xu Jilin’s essay on Wang Yuanhua) a worthwhile contribution to public debate? Or Qian Liqun’s very personal “introduction” to a course (and now a two-volume book) on the Mao period? Do people really read the dense prose of Sun Ge’s\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\npostcolonial theorizing? Aside from our assurance that our Chinese colleagues made the case for each of these authors, these diverse texts reflect the variety of literary forms adopted by Chinese intellectuals writing under Party supervision in the early twenty-first century. Xu Jilin’s contemporary literati elegy is one style of expression used by China’s public intellectuals—here to evoke the historical experience of the older intellectuals active in these debates. Similarly, the personal style of Qian Liqun’s lecture encodes a stinging analysis of the Mao period and a call to arms to face the historical tragedies of “Mao culture” within the form of “a letter to my father and introduction to a generation who don’t know this history.” Several of the essays included in this volume look more academic, their authors displaying different sorts of “expertise”—Liu Qing gives a nuanced philosophical reading heavy with citations to philosophers such as Charles Taylor; Wang Shaoguang offers a careful political-economy analysis with charts and tables; Chen Lai peppers his history with arcane characters and terms from Confucianism’s long history; Cai Xia provides a robust defense of constitutional democracy entirely on the basis of the Marxist-Leninist cannon; and Sun Ge reflects the engagement of some in the Sinophone Left with international postcolonial theory that has an audience as much in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan as inside China. We also include notable public lectures reposted on Internet fora (Rong Jian), thoughtful posts on Weibo and Weixin (Guo Yuhua and Cai Xia), and focused conversations between like-minded intellectuals, also made widely available over the Internet (Chen Ming and his fellow debaters). The vast majority of public intellectuals in China—in particular public intellectuals who publish in high-profile venues—are men. We may deplore this limitation, but at present it appears to be a sociological fact, even if the reasons for the imbalance are not immediately clear. Two of us met with the outspoken sociologist Guo Yuhua at Tsinghua University in early December 2018, and when we asked her to explain the male domination of China’s public intellectual world, she replied with a wry smile that “systems are gendered, too.” As we have consulted more widely, other voices have quickly emerged, and we include the commentaries by Guo Yuhua and Cai Xia of the Central Party School as well as by Sun Ge to reflect more of women’s contributions to thinking China. Individual introductions to each text provide specific information on each Chinese author and the context and key points of that text and address any salient issues of translation or terminology. This general introduction to the volume as a whole introduces the three main “voices” that Chinese intellectuals themselves recognize—Liberal, Left, and New Confucian—and offers a survey of the historical context, political system, and intellectual worlds that have shaped these intellectuals and their analysis of contemporary China. We explore the key themes and issues we see emerging from these debates and their\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nsignificance for understanding China, China’s role in the world, and what China’s intellectuals might have to offer from a newly powerful China in a time of profound challenges to the liberal global order.\n\nMapping the Intellectual Public Sphere Our volume begins with Gan Yang’s lecture at Tsinghua University in 2005. He appears as “the challenge” because we feel his characterization of contemporary China as shaped by three traditions from the twentieth century—Confucianism, Maoism, and liberal reform under Deng Xiaoping (1904–1997)—has been broadly embraced by most intellectuals who currently debate China’s political reforms in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) today. In addition, Gan’s challenge aptly identifies the questions and reflects the categories that animate all the thinkers and writers we have surveyed: how to identify and integrate the best of China’s traditional, socialist, and liberal heritages and their focus on thought, culture, and moral discourse. To present the range of answers to the challenge Gan Yang articulates, we adopt the widely accepted Chinese division of the world of public intellectuals into three “streams of thought” (sichao): the Liberals, the New Left, and the New Confucians.3 The Liberals are in many ways the most familiar to Western observers. Liu Xiaobo (b. 1955), who died in the summer of 2017 and was a prisoner of conscience and a Nobel Peace Prize winner in 2010, represents the world of Chinese dissidents who continue to struggle for the causes of democracy and human rights in China and who are willing to confront Chinese Communist Party (CCP) authority directly. However, many public intellectuals in China are liberal in a less confrontational fashion and labor in their books and on their websites to achieve liberal goals in less revolutionary ways by working within the system, by exploring forgotten liberal traditions in China, by criticizing illiberal practices in contemporary Chinese society, and by engaging New Left and New Confucian authors in debate. These Chinese Liberals seek to make China truly “modern” in the face of repressive traditions (both traditional Chinese and revolutionary) by salvaging the heritage of Western liberalism— individual freedoms, rule of law—even as they struggle with the postmodern readings of China’s rise. The five Liberals included in part II of this volume offer five ways these issues are addressed in public in China today: as careful scholarly analyses applied to burning problems, as public lectures, as snappy and direct blog posts, as analyses cast in orthodox Party language, and as heartfelt literary examples to inspire. In chapter 2, Liu Qing, a professor of political science in Shanghai, speaks from within the academy but to a broader audience in 2004 through the well-known intellectual journal Kaifang Shidai (Open times) published in\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nGuangzhou. Liu Qing gives a rigorously theoretical account of the issues confronting China and defends liberalism, drawing particularly from the communitarian liberalism of the Canadian philosopher Charles Taylor. Liu’s goal is to identify and apply useful categories of analysis to construct his liberal vision of China’s problems and solutions. He also invokes the “three traditions” of China’s twentieth century, signaling that he has joined the conversation launched by Gan Yang. Yet Liu searches for historical continuity in different ways, arguing that whatever one might think of liberalism in an abstract sense, the liberal mindset has become part of Chinese culture over the course of the past century. Chapter 3, a lecture Rong Jian delivered in Beijing in 2013, is a trenchant critique of Party rule and ideology as it applies to critical thought. It is the most politically direct and penetrating of all of the essays included in the volume (no doubt reflecting Rong’s independent status as a “businessman intellectual”). He gives a Liberal’s “history” of China’s developments and considerable detail on the conditions of intellectual public life. Rong ends with a call for a “marketplace for ideas” in China, which, in miniature, this volume reflects. The two offerings by Guo Yuhua begin in chapter 4 with a short (and now deleted) blog post chiding the government in the wake of a crude expulsion of “ low-quality people ” from Beijing in 2017. In chapter 5, Guo uses a modified question-andanswer format to provide a ferocious critique of “communist civilization” by basically undercutting all the shibboleths of Maoist and post-Mao leftist writers in a Chinese version of Hans Christian Andersen’s story “The Emperor’s New Clothes”—she takes few prisoners. In chapter 6, Cai Xia offers as strong a defense of democratic politics as Liu Qing and as harsh an assessment of Communist rule as Guo Yuhua but does so entirely on the basis of the MarxistLeninist canon in the rhetoric of what Geremie Barmé calls “Party NewSpeak.” In the final essay in part II, Xu Jilin, among the most noted of Liberal voices in China,4 is represented with a moving eulogy to one establishment intellectual: Wang Yuanhua (1920–2008). Xu offers a concrete, historical, and personal account of the emergence of Chinese liberal thought in the 1990s through the example of Wang, a disillusioned Party intellectual whose life reflects the experiences that have shaped the elder generation arguing in this volume (and parallels Qian Liqun’s reminiscences of his life under Mao Zedong in chapter 8). We have chosen thematic rather than chronological order in our presentation of these texts, but it is worth noting the chronology here: liberal thought was relatively ascendant in the early 2000s but has been eclipsed since 2012 and especially since the rise of Xi Jinping. Rong Jian’s critique from 2013 is among the last forceful expressions of Chinese liberal thought that we have seen, bar Cai Xia’s remarkable liberal defense in orthodox Party language. Guo’s more recent blog post was, as noted, quickly taken down.\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe New Left includes figures that avow socialist goals of egalitarianism and social justice. Many New Left intellectuals are more accepting of China’s revolutionary and Maoist heritage than are the Liberals and engage in both political and scholarly activism as a means to address the inequalities and corruption that have been by-products of China’s rapid economic growth. They are universally critical of the Euro-American “neoliberal” economic order, and some criticize the Chinese government for not being leftist enough. At the same time, these intellectuals embrace the current Party-state in ways Liberals do not. Some of these figures were attracted to the “Chongqing model” (which endures despite the purge and sentencing of Bo Xilai, the model’s advocate, in 2012).5 That model seeks to combine state economic intervention, police crackdown on criminality and corruption, and nostalgic Maoist populism to better the lives of Chinese workers and peasants, many of whom have not benefitted from China’s “market socialism.” One way or another, the New Left intellectuals seek to make China a truly revolutionary alternative to a neoliberal world. The New Left voices in part III include five diverse intellectuals. We begin in chapter 8 with Qian Liqun, a respected elder academic and intellectual activist. He offers a profound assessment of Mao, Maoism, and intellectuals’ involvement with Mao and the consequences of this history for himself, for intellectuals, and for China. Qian identifies himself, as did Mao, with the people or, in today’s lingo, as minjian (among the people, grassroots). A professor of literature at Peking University, Qian embodies, in the tension between his elite status and populist identity, the challenge that confronts most of the New Left intellectuals in China today. Qian faces this challenge and the tormented history of socialism squarely, in particular Mao’s abuses of power and intellectuals’ complicity in his rule. His answers are not simple, but they are compelling. He concludes with the call for a “thorough clearing up” (qingli) of Mao Zedong Thought and culture before China can truly absorb and digest its twentieth-century history and move forward. Xiao Gongqin, a professor at Shanghai Normal University, published his short essay in the Shanghai newspaper Dongfang Zaobao (Oriental morning post) in 2012. In chapter 9, Xiao, considered a leftist but also a representative of neoauthoritarian thought, offers another, more orthodox reading of history that justifies the reformist Leninism of Deng Xiaoping. Xiao addresses the question of democracy—a topic that runs through most of our texts—and comes down squarely on the authoritarian populist model known, since the days of Sun Yat-sen (1866– 1925), as “political tutelage.” That is, the authoritarian state will teach the people of China the civic values necessary for a future constitutional system. Where Qian invokes the self-critical tradition in Chinese leftism, Xiao shows just what is worth keeping from China’s century of socialism but really offers an instrumentalist defense of authoritarianism as the best road to civil society and democracy.\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nGan Yang returns in chapter 10 with a global political history of democracy that makes the case for what Wang Shaoguang in chapter 11 calls “representational democracy.” Both intellectuals offer a spirited critique of liberal democracy as practiced in Western nations today. This is not the stuff of partisan name-calling, but thoughtful and challenging historical and political science analyses of the foibles of electoral democracy. This essay by Gan Yang was published in 1999, and Liu Qing’s liberal text from 2004 (chapter 2) may be seen as a rejoinder. Gan’s theme is the inherent elitism of liberal thought and its irrelevance to the practical needs of ordinary Chinese. In making his case, Gan reflects a deep understanding of Western political theory (his academic specialty), from Edmund Burke to Rousseau to Tocqueville to Benjamin Constant and Isaiah Berlin. In contrast, Wang Shaoguang, professor emeritus at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and currently a Schwarzman Scholar at Tsinghua University in Beijing, deploys the tools of academic political science—tables, charts, surveys— to make his case for “representational” (or “responsive”) democracy as better than Western representative democracy. His goal in this essay from 2014, also published in Open Times, is to make the case why China under Xi Jinping should not be called “authoritarian” but is in fact more truly democratic than America. Finally in part III, Sun Ge’s essay from 2017 in chapter 12 offers a postmodern critical reading of Okinawan history as a window into the challenges for leftist thought in China today. Sun is a specialist on Japan and a professor of literature at the Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing. She is actively engaged with the Inter-Asia Cultural Studies group of East Asian intellectuals who seek to draw from subaltern theory to build an independent (non-Western) Asian theory. Although a minority voice (as a woman) in Chinese intellectual circles today, Sun also shows that New Left thought need not be limited to domestic concerns. New Confucians are convinced that China’s and ultimately the world’s future lies in the revival (or reinvention) of China’s Confucian past. These figures argue that China’s twentieth-century pursuit of Western knowledge was wrongheaded because neither liberalism nor Marxism will ever be sufficiently Chinese. Grounding themselves in notions of cultural exceptionalism (“China is different”), these intellectuals are convinced that the Confucian tradition of “benevolent rule” can be updated to provide a new and much-needed legitimacy to China’s authoritarian polity. They imagine a moral meritocracy that will function as a genuinely benevolent dictatorship and thereby will outperform liberal democratic regimes, corrupted by lobbying and private interests. Moreover, such a stance grows organically out of China’s glorious past and restores the traditional personal relations—China’s Confucian hierarchy—destroyed by a century of Western-inspired revolution. These intellectuals seek to make China truly Chinese in a modern world dominated by Western culture.\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn part IV, New Confucian voices are represented by three texts: a roundtable discussion published in a movement-oriented journal but more broadly accessed over the Internet, a historical survey in a university journal, and an interview published online. Indeed, the predominance of Internet material among China’s New Confucians reflects their popular orientation and ambivalent relationship with standard scholarship (and academic intellectuals such as Xu Jilin and Ge Zhaoguang are very critical of the scholarly bona fides of these advocates).6 In chapter 13, Chen Ming heads up a spirited debate among New Confucians in June 2014 that gives a vivid sense of the intellectual energy, even humor, of this community. The discussion also presents a startling narrative that simply sidelines Chinese socialism and the CCP, essentially framing the Party as a twentieth-century artifact that has fulfilled its historical mission and now needs to get out of the way of China’s true revival—Confucian civilization. The shared focus in this debate is the figure Kang Youwei (1858–1927), the radical Confucian reformer. In chapter 14, Chen Lai, a noted professor of philosophy at Tsinghua University in Beijing, offers his version of China’s modern history, focusing, understandably, on the role and fate of Confucian thought. Readers can contrast the liberal version of this history given by Rong Jian and the leftist histories offered by Qian Liqun and Xiao Gongqin. Chen Lai answers Gan Yang’s challenge to integrate China’s past and present by placing Confucian thought and social practice (Chen speaks in terms of the “subconscious” aspect of Confucianism in society) at the center of his narrative. Our final text, an interview with Jiang Qing, the noted Confucian activist and advocate for a Confucian constitution and state religion,7 returns to a major theme of China’s modern history: the May Fourth Movement. Although the title of this interview in 2015 (available on the Chinese Internet) addresses the place of modern women in society, in fact Jiang Qing does not do that topic justice but focuses on the failure of this signature movement in China’s modern and socialist history. If our volume begins with a predictable critique of Party rule by Liberals on behalf of modern values, it ends with a somewhat surprising conservative criticism of the Party by Confucians against both.\n\nThe Diverse Worlds of Thinking China It is well to keep in mind our speakers’ social place or position. All of them address the same challenges facing China today, but they do so from different social spaces and with varying identities and organizational homes. They are representatives of thinking China but cannot represent all Chinese. In this volume, we see a range of public intellectuals—academic and independent. The voices represented here draw from humanist intellectuals who speak from their university perches but to a public intellectual audience—such as Xu Jilin, Liu\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nQing, and Xiao Gongqin in Shanghai and Sun Ge, Qian Liqun, Cai Xia, Guo Yuhua, Wang Shaoguang, and Chen Lai in Beijing. They give a sense of this vibrant world dominated by intellectual stand-offs between the New Left and Liberal camps and of the New Confucians’ rising confidence. Cai Xia is fully in the establishment due to her long work in the Central Party School. Gan Yang, Rong Jian, and Jiang Qing—each broadly associated with one of the three notable sichao—are our entryway into the world of independent public intellectuals where commerce, religious and local associations, including a range of New Confucian organizations, and the Internet intersect. Between and beyond these roles for public intellectuals live the lonely souls who choose open dissent, from Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo and Ai Weiwei, the performance-art enfant terrible of the establishment, to a host of less well-known activists, lawyers, and muckrakers.8 These voices are not included here but are increasingly available in recent studies and translations.9 Although we use modern China’s “three traditions” to organize the voices in this volume, these identities are not hard and fast. These clusters define ideal types; not all intellectuals identify as Liberal or New Left or New Confucian. For example, among intellectuals translated in this volume, Liu Qing identifies as a Left Liberal; Gan Yang has moved from a liberal position to a Left Confucian stand; and although many New Left intellectuals have come in recent years to embrace the Chinese state, Sun Ge seeks to find a critical community of interests in the Sinophone Left inside and outside the PRC. Initial consultations with Chinese colleagues have emphasized two other trends of thought: neoauthoritarianism (or new conservatism), as in Xiao Gongqin, who appears in this volume, and Wang Huning (b. 1955), who is the ghost writer for the CCP leadership, and democratic socialism, as in Xie Tao (1922–2010).10 In all, the three thought streams are handy for an initial orientation to China’s diverse and dynamic intellectual world, but we should be wary of singling out of any one intellectual as embodying this or that stream. It may be more helpful to think in terms of an intellectual’s orientation and approach, or what we are calling “voices.” Intellectuals identifying as New Confucian are looking for Chinese solutions and drawing from indigenous Chinese thinkers. Chinese Liberals are looking for ways China can embrace and develop universal or global norms and draw from Western liberal thinkers. And many New Left intellectuals are looking for Asian solutions as well as socialist traditions that engage but are not limited to either Chinese or Western or universal norms; they often draw from Asian thinkers in the Global South. These distinctly different concerns contribute to a certain amount of “talking past each other” among intellectuals identified with one or none of the three sichao. Moreover, many of the ideas defended by various public intellectuals are paired with larger political, social, and intellectual projects: New Confucians build academies and launch nongovernmental organizations; New Left intellectuals\n\n10\n\nIntroduction\n\nserve in the brain trusts of politicians whose ideas they respect; Liberals seek out partnerships with Western universities and academics to use that cultural capital for influence and protection in China’s still fragile civil society. Our speakers are academic public intellectuals—scholars who have chosen to use their specialized knowledge and status to engage with the public conversation on China’s challenges. Most are currently employed in Chinese universities, but the independent intellectuals, such as Rong Jian, also adopt scholarly personae. The historians among them are reexamining China’s past to uncover themes, practices, forgotten traditions, and missed opportunities that might fill the void at the core of China’s current political/cultural identity and help forge China’s future. The sociologists, political scientists, and philosophers seek to find models and mine traditions to offer solutions to current problems. These debates are subtle, varied, and wide ranging, and they suggest a breadth and sophistication rarely hinted at in media discussions of China’s intellectual world. These qualities have impelled us to translate these texts in full so that English readers can engage with the details of these Chinese public intellectuals’ arguments and analyses. We think they have important things to say. Of course, academic public intellectuals, as significant as their work is to Chinese political contention, hardly describe the entire population of China’s lively, if not free, public sphere. There are important actors and issues not included in this corner of China’s intellectual public sphere, which is a subset of the raucous and generally commercial broader public sphere. For example, the use of China’s vibrant social media is taken up mostly with shopping, gossiping, and the equivalent of watching cat videos; a scant 10 percent of Chinese social media are used for political or social discussion.11 China’s intellectual public sphere includes journalists, business leaders speaking on social and political issues, some artists, local nongovernmental organizations, lawyers, and other social activists. All are important and covered, at least in part, in recent studies, but these actors generally focus on specific issues, particular communities, and individual cases. These public intellectuals address issues of feminism, leisure, futurism, and animal rights, along with a host of other important social and local political issues.12 Academic public intellectuals address their attention to the discursive sinews of power in the CCP’s China—ideology and “China’s story.” New studies highlight the importance of these ideological and cultural concerns. Kerry Brown’s new study of Xi Jinping’s revival of Party ideology forcefully argues that the key power issue confronting the CCP today is neither military nor economic but cultural.13 Brown sees Xi’s reforms and pronouncements, including his brutal anticorruption campaign, as efforts to re-create a moral narrative for the CCP, to make the Party legitimate in the hearts of China’s citizens. Christian Sorace’s political ethnography has documented this moral politics in practice at the local level in the case of the Party’s response to\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nthe Sichuan earthquake in 2008.14 This battle for legitimacy is now being fought precisely on the level of the ideas and norms that China’s New Confucians, Liberals, and New Left intellectuals have been debating over the past two decades. It is no wonder that the Party is now coming down hard not just on Chinese Liberals but also on New Confucians and New Left intellectuals who impugn the Party’s dignity, idealism, or ethical legitimacy. At the same time, neither the Party apparatus nor the intellectual elite fully represent the efforts of China’s resilient intellectuals across society. Sebastian Veg provides the most up-to-date and comprehensive study of China’s fearless minjian, or “grassroots,” intellectuals.15 They are educated people, lawyers, activists, and documentary filmmakers who eschew high theory to address concrete social problems and engage with local communities. Like Foucault’s “specific intellectuals,” these minjian intellectuals act out their politics. In China, this has meant a dangerous dance with the Party, both the central security forces and the often corrupt local governments. Perhaps the most important message from Veg’s book is how these grassroots intellectuals are collectively changing the society that the Party and China’s fractious academic intellectuals seek to improve. Xi Jinping has emphasized the need to “tell China’s story well” since his directive given at the National Propaganda and Ideology Work Conference in August 2013, and he has been promoting his “China Dream” as the main narrative of that story. However, recent research has shown that public opinion, at least among China’s educated urban netizens, is still far more diverse than official propaganda would suggest.16 Academic public intellectuals are key voices in this struggle to define and tell “China’s story.” These theoretical, sometimes obscure, and often philosophical debates are a major forum in which Chinese public policy—at the strategic level—is contested within China’s directed public sphere. New Confucians assert that the Chinese must think with indigenous concepts such as dao (the Way), li (rites), and ren (benevolence), for otherwise they are in the thrall of foreign powers. For Chinese Liberals, the reasoning and logic of liberalism will save the Chinese from stultifying traditionalism and radical despotism. New Left intellectuals find that only neo-Marxism and postcolonial theory can open the Chinese population’s eyes to the ills of neoliberalism and lead them to the pathway toward social equity. If we doubt the importance of these debates, simply recall that the two major outlets in which these sorts of debates have appeared within China—the journal Yanhuang Chunqiu (China through the ages) and the website Gongshi Wang (Consensus Net) were shut down by the end of 2016. The Party does not censor what it does not think is significant. It is not the case that political and social theorizing is necessarily the preferred voice for China’s academic intellectuals—who also pen lively topical commentaries on daily life and local issues. Rather, the convoluted language of\n\n12\n\nIntroduction\n\nsome of these intellectual debates is doubly political in contemporary China. The carrot is the promise of political influence. The Party, especially under Xi Jinping, continues to champion the “guiding role” of thought, and so intellectuals who hope to influence public policy perforce must cast their proposals in ideological language congenial to state actors.17 Most of the Chinese writings translated in this volume seek to identify “correct thought,” the right way to think about big issues—be it liberal political theory, neo-Marxism, or some version or other of Confucian thought. Disagreement is rife, and political retribution a constant danger, but all sides appear to accept the primary importance of getting the thought right, even Liberals, who embrace tolerance as a necessity lacking in current Chinese thought worlds.18 The second political attribute of these theoretical discussions reflects the stick: the need under China’s repressive political system, as Gloria Davies has shown, to “speak obliquely” to avoid political repression. Academic jargon serves as a screen against political criticism, an indirect avenue of criticism, and a public “hidden transcript” in which the educated reader is expected to connect the dots between Max Weber or John Rawls and current politics in China.19 In the process, we discover a great range of opinions can be expressed without openly transgressing Party orthodoxy.\n\nSame History, Different Dreams The essays translated in this volume give three clearly different narratives of the same China over recent decades. These contending narratives buttress their divergent solutions for China’s new century. For the New Confucians, the failures of socialism and the depredations of Western “hollowing out of Chinese culture” in the twentieth century cry out for a traditional Chinese solution— Confucianism. There are, of course, different Confucian solutions on offer, from Jiang Qing’s political institutions to Kang Xiaoguang’s state religion to Chen Ming’s or Bai Tongdong’s search for a sort of civil religion. According to Deng Jun and Craig Smith, these propositions offer various forms of a Chinese and de-secularized solution that reunites religion and politics for China today.20 The same world according to Chinese Liberals is a history of socialist failure and market-reform success now challenged by the lack of political reform. These challenges cry out for the best political solutions human civilizations have produced, and liberalism, they argue, has the best track record for producing stable, just, and prosperous societies in modern history. Rational and fairminded, Chinese Liberals acknowledge the limitations of Western liberalism in practice (especially since the global financial crisis of 2008 and the populist revolts in the United Kingdom and the United States in recent years). They see modern Chinese history as a local variant of universal human history and thus focus on the challenges of balancing liberty and equality, addressing challenges\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nto civil society and how to reinvigorate the tradition of Chinese constitutional government. Thoughtful assessments and suggestions are offered by Rong Jian, Xu Jilin, Guo Yuhua, Cai Xia, and Liu Qing in our translations. Among other liberal intellectuals, Qin Hui draws critically on Russian, Soviet, and post-Soviet history; Sun Liping diagnoses a “fractured society”; and Yu Jianrong focuses on how to address social conflict. All these propositions are offered in the context of debates with Left and Confucian intellectuals, and Chinese liberalism has been under considerable attack in recent years.21 Recent history, according to New Left intellectuals, shows the need for a revival of the best of state socialism as a defense against global neoliberalism. For mainland New Left intellectuals, only the Chinese state, as a reformed socialist entity, ultimately has the wherewithal to withstand the depredations of neoliberal globalization.22 Wang Hui (b. 1959) is most widely known in the West for making this case.23 In our translations, Wang Shaoguang offers a thorough critique of Western politics and economics while making the case for Chinese-style “representational” democracy that, he feels, can succeed where Western representative democracy is now failing. As mainland Chinese New Left intellectuals engage their fellow leftist intellectuals in Taiwan and Hong Kong, they confront the disturbing challenge that they as PRC citizens are part of a new colonial power. Left intellectuals in these three areas have discovered that the same ideas (anti-imperialism, anticolonialism) have different meanings in each place and that the failure to appreciate the different historical experiences in each bedevils their search for a new, emancipatory “Asian perspective.”24 Chen Kuan-hsing in Taiwan, Sun Ge in mainland China, and Johnson Chang in Hong Kong represent promising efforts to engage these different experiences and build that common Asian perspective. In our translations, Sun Ge takes the example of Japan and Okinawa as a metaphor for the challenges also facing China and the solutions that a critical theory approach can offer. We also can see some shared assumptions in this Sinophone thought among PRC academic public intellectuals as they debate and criticize each other. First, the West looms large for all sides, particularly since China’s rise has made the race between China and the West all the more exciting. For the New Confucians, Western influence, both power and culture, has been pernicious. It has hollowed out Chinese culture and left a spiritual vacuum. The “West” for New Confucians, however, includes both socialism and liberalism as invasive foreign species in China’s garden. The New Confucians frequently compare their solutions to foreign solutions, reflecting a certain lack of self-confidence. Chinese Liberals, of course, look to the best of the West while critically engaging the limitations and failures of liberal democratic practice and attending to the areas where current international liberal norms do not fit China’s situation or require adaptation (as in the avoidance among these academic intellectuals of any substantive discussion on electoral democracy at this stage). They\n\n14\n\nIntroduction\n\npragmatically focus on the liberal side of liberal democracy—looking for sound ways to implement constraints on the use of power. For New Left intellectuals, the West is both the source of emancipatory theory (though critical theory has also been greatly enriched by voices from the Global South) and the great enemy and home of neoliberalism. In all, we cannot understand contemporary Chinese intellectual life absent its profound engagement with the West—ideas from the West, political examples from the West, and examples from Western history that populate nearly every Chinese essay covered by our mapping. All efforts to create a Chinese identity among these elites inevitably come from a critical engagement with the global order that Western nations have shaped and up to now have dominated. Second, as noted, the voices in this volume accept that it is important to get one’s thinking, one’s ideology or sixiang, right. The philosophical idealism (as opposed to materialism) of most of these essays also connects contemporary Chinese thought with a long tradition of twentieth-century Chinese political thought. Finally, there is a “shared civility” among these academic public intellectuals for all but a few extremists. Despite their vociferous contention over solutions, so far none of these intellectuals is denouncing any others as “counterrevolutionaries” or for “hurting the feelings of the Chinese people.” Sadly, the increasing limitations put on public debate in China in the past few years under Xi Jinping and the increased demand that intellectuals conform to the ideology of “the leader” challenge this period of a hundred schools contending in early-twenty-first-century China.\n\nThinking China in Today’s World The current ideological moment in China—the question of the day and the remembered recent history of the past decades that shape the world of intellectuals translated in this volume—is part of the global ideological moment, albeit an importantly distinct part. The question all the voices in this volume are addressing in one way or another is: How can China become a truly great power as well as a just society and a positive leader in the world?25 Thus, although we emphasize the local conditions, domestic concerns, and parochial arguments among these intellectuals, we also see powerful resonances with our own societies in Europe, North America, and Australasia and the challenges we face today, particularly in the rising populist anger in America, the United Kingdom, and around the world. From this global perspective, China’s “new era” of the CCP’s increasingly autocratic regime under its “supreme leader,” Xi Jinping, not only is a stage and phase in the history of modern China but also partakes of the global populist reaction to the failings of a neoliberal order that has produced obscene wealth for the few, left many in poverty and insecurity,\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nand gutted the middle classes around the world.26 We no more see Xi Jinping as “the solution” than we do Donald Trump or Brexit. The point is that the Chinese intellectuals translated in this volume are consciously engaged in the assessment of these global developments. Their essays are impressively well informed on international conditions (and modern European history) and address problems we all face: the failures of political representation, the rise of social intolerance, the perdurance of economic inequality, and looming environmental crises. Thus, the translations in this volume offer insight to conditions and issues of China today as well as specifically Chinese solutions to the shared problems of governance we all face.27 Naturally enough, China’s intellectuals cast their response to these global challenges not only in terms of local ideas and experiences but also in terms of the impact of these changes on their world—their work, their lives, their society. We suggest that China’s rise and the West’s simultaneous decline from unchallenged global supremacy has had an effect on the Chinese intellectual world equivalent to that of the May Fourth period a century ago. May Fourth marked the moment when much of the intellectual elite in China decided that Confucian civilization was at best no longer functional and at worst an obstacle to China’s progress. Lu Xun’s (1881–1936) dark humor and despair reflected the gravity of that recognition, the sense of free fall. Others were less somber and set about the grim tasks of reform or revolution with appropriate energy, but with a few notable exceptions most of China’s intellectual elite at the time believed that China’s future lay in some version of modernity, be it liberal democratic or socialist.28 “With Chinese characteristics” was always there as an asterisk—Deng Xiaoping did not invent the idea—but by 1925 Chinese civilization had become a dinosaur: something fascinating, maybe worthy of study, but also something extinct. Mao may have Sinified Marxism, compared himself to Qin Shihuang, the founding emperor of the Qin dynasty in 221 BCE, and wrote classical-style poetry, but even when he soured on socialism, his goal was to remake the revolution, not to revive “feudal China.” The dictates of nationalism required modernity, and there was no obvious link between Chinese tradition and modernity. Maoism and state socialism blended the two at midcentury, but by the 1980s most Chinese felt the combination was no longer working. China’s rise in the twenty-first century has meant, first and foremost, that China has achieved modernity in the form of wealth and power. The global crisis of capitalism beginning in 2008, followed by the election of Donald Trump in 2016 and the many signs of malaise afflicting the liberal democratic world, have only boosted China’s self-confidence. Calls such as Wei Jingsheng’s (b. 1950) for a “fifth modernization” (i.e., democracy) in 1979, which may well have nagged at the conscience (or perhaps confidence) of many a reformer of the Deng era (and after), now fall flat. China’s governance today offers what the world seems\n\n16\n\nIntroduction\n\nto want: wealth, stability, mobility, promise—to most citizens who keep their noses clean and their mouths shut. The Chinese state has replaced the United States as the world’s model of efficiency and competence. Whether we like their chosen direction or not, China’s leaders appear to know where China is going and how to get there. We have entered the Chinese century. The effects of this new era on China’s intellectuals have been astounding. Reading these texts gives the impression that they inhabit a brave new world where conceptually and intellectually anything is possible; the sky’s the limit. This is a reversal of May Fourth’s antitraditionalism because “China’s back, baby, and she’s better than ever.” Lu Xun went into free fall, while a century later Chen Ming and his New Confucian colleagues soar, unmoored. Of course, this characterization does not match the lived experience of intellectuals in today’s China. As our Liberal friends and colleagues constantly remind us, what Xi Jinping hopes to achieve may well mark the beginning of the end of this period of experimentation. But many texts, in particular those of the mainland New Confucians and the New Left, seem to reflect the notion that China not only requires but is also on the verge of capturing an entirely new sixiang, a new story, a new ideology, which, by the way, will be of world-historical significance—as Chinese thought once was in the past. This is what is behind much of the work of Gan Yang and of the epigraph from him at the start of this introduction. Gan insists that China needs a new epistemology, a new historiography, that will bring together the experiences of Confucianism, socialism, and reform-era capitalism with Chinese characteristics and make sense of all of these things in a global, comparative context. Although at first glance the idea of “putting the twentieth century behind us,” particularly the political history of the twentieth century, reads like a mindless slogan, it seems to be enormously popular among Chinese intellectuals, who appear to be convinced that conventional historiography, conventional narratives, no longer apply. Like the image of Chinese tradition during the May Fourth era, for these intellectuals the notion of “China’s twentieth century” seems to stand in the way of China’s twenty-first century. Much of this iconoclasm is, of course, explained by a general rejection of the narrative of the Enlightenment, a rejection shared by many members of the New Left and the mainland New Confucians. For the mainland New Confucians, this rejection is straightforward and near total.29 Jiang Qing’s piece on women in this volume hammers this point repeatedly; in fact, the piece spends more time condemning the May Fourth movement than it does talking about women. May Fourth was, to the mainland New Confucians, a disaster from which China is only now beginning to recover, as was Maoism. These and other New Confucian critiques indict China’s liberal tradition—the notion that China’s modernization will inevitably lead to Western-style democracy—as well as its\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nsocialist heritage, in particular its internationalist aspects, and Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution. The “transcendence” of China’s liberal and socialist traditions will be based on the “Chinese people/nation” (Zhonghua minzu)—the two are conflated both linguistically and discursively—and their/its concrete needs rather than on abstract ideas based on Enlightenment discourse. This is a Confucian co-optation of the Maoist notion of “practice.” By “uniting the three traditions,” Gan Yang demands the construction of a new historical narrative that will reunite the experiences of the Qing Empire, the Republic of China, and the PRC, despite the ruptures that the current historical records have emphasized. This demand reflects a goal shared by Chen Ming and others—and demonstrated in the roundtable discussion with Chen and Gan in this volume: to create a new cultural continuity based on sixiang, to replace the manifest political discontinuity that has marked China’s experience since the Opium War. The New Left has made similar discursive moves. Their rejection of the Enlightenment is less obvious and less complete than the mainland New Confucians’ rejection, but Wang Shaoguang, who has spent his career trying to help China build “state capacity,” has turned his sights in recent years to a criticism of Western democracy. To Wang, “electoral democracy” is more “electoral” than “democratic,” and he proposes the Chinese model of “representational democracy” and “good governance” in which results rather than process or political form are what count. In addition, after years of positioning themselves as “critical intellectuals,” citing postmodern theory to criticize what they saw as the neoliberal character of China’s reforms during the 1980s and 1990s, members of the New Left have moved in recent years to embrace the state. Their intellectual inspiration is likely to be Carl Schmitt or Leo Strauss rather than Roberto Unger or Slavoj Žižek, and they fetishize state power instead of defending the interests of the little people. This shift may not be a rejection of the Enlightenment, but it is surely a subversion of it. The New Left, like the mainland New Confucians, are also engaged in reimagining China’s modern history. This, of course, is part of Wang Hui’s major, multivolume work on the history of Chinese thought, which he started long before China’s definitive rise, but Wang Shaoguang also proposes a periodization based on the rise and achievement of state power and capacity rather than on regime change.30 Perhaps due to the sensitivity of the subject, the CCP is rarely mentioned as an important actor in the drama of China’s modern and contemporary history, even by members of the New Left—or at least it wasn’t until Xi Jinping came to town. These shifts have left China’s Liberals on the defensive. Xu Jilin has devoted much of his writing over the past ten years not only to a denunciation of the cult of state power but also, more importantly, to an analysis of its intellectual underpinnings: the ideas of statism and historicism. Whatever historicism may\n\n18\n\nIntroduction\n\nhave meant elsewhere, in the contemporary Chinese context it is the idea that universal values do not exist; meaning and identity are the pure products of local history and culture, embodied in the state. Hence, notions of historicism and statism are mutually supportive and fuel the cultural pride of the mainland New Confucians, for whom traditional Chinese civilization is unique and glorious, as well as the nationalist pride of those touting the “China model,” including New Left intellectuals such as Wang Shaoguang. Xu has also attempted to fashion a liberal compromise with Chinese tradition, discussing the possibility of Confucianism’s serving as China’s “civil religion” and attempting to craft a new, more cosmopolitan Chinese foreign policy by proposing “tianxiazhuyi (Chinese universalism) 2.0.”31 Likewise, we have seen Liu Qing’s robust defense of liberalism’s ability to address the realities of China’s “social imaginary” today. As of 2018, these debates were inconclusive in China’s intellectual and political circles. Whatever the intellectual merits of these voices, these three “streams of thought,” there has been no conclusive signal that one has gained popular traction at the expense of the others. As Liu Qing and others have noted, China today and therefore thinking among various Chinese are plural. Pluralism is not a widely embraced norm, but a plural public sphere in China is a social fact. However, changes in 2018—in particular the reconfirmation of Xi Jinping’s leadership, the removal of the previous expectation that he would serve at most two terms as national leader, and the increased propaganda on Marxist ideology in general and Xi Thought in particular—all suggest that this period of a hundred flowers blooming is about to pass.32 This shift is captured on the one hand by the shutting down of the journal Yanhuang Chunqiu and the website Gongshi Wang, along with continued repression of human rights lawyers and non-Han populations in Xinjiang, and on the other hand by a concerted effort to install Xi Thought. In January 2018, Jiang Shigong’s stunning essay “Philosophy and History: Interpreting the ‘Xi Jinping Era’ Through Xi’s Report at the Nineteenth National Congress of the CCP” made an ambitious attempt at a new synthesis that, if successful, might create the new sixiang for which all our authors are searching and thus impose a new orthodoxy.33 His version of Gan Yang’s “unifying the three traditions” is China’s “standing up, getting rich, and getting strong,” and the chief actor in this historical drama is not the CCP, but the Chinese people/nation, which are led of course by the CCP and its remarkable and brilliant leader Xi Jinping. This unification represents a new synthesis of Soviet socialism and Western capitalism, a dialectical transcendence that will allow China to resume its position as world leader and move humanity forward. Xi Thought, which presumably will function as the new state orthodoxy as well, provides an official answer to Gan Yang’s questions and would shut out most of the voices in this volume. It remains to be seen if the age of new orthodoxy has arrived or not.\n\nIntroduction\n\n19\n\nThe Challenges of Listening: Scholarly Literature on China’s Intellectuals These translations and the collaborative project that produced many of them have been undertaken with the belief that it is worth hearing these Chinese voices. It is a worthwhile goal, but the task, we have discovered, has been neither simple nor straightforward. The first challenge we had to face is our own assumptions, presumptions, and habits. The second challenge was finding a way to convey what the Chinese texts say in readable, engaging, and sensible English. It turns out that listening takes considerable work. China’s intellectuals have been on the minds of Western academics and general readers at least since the start of the PRC. As exemplified by the influential works of Merle Goldman, Chinese intellectuals have often been seen as dissidents, or “Russian refuseniks with Chinese characteristics.”34 The intellectuals who have most spoken to Western readers were cast as Chinese versions of Solzhenitsyn or Sakharov. This characterization may have made sense during the Cold War, but today the “two camps” no longer exist, contact between people inside and outside of China is much greater, and shared experiences of globalized commerce and media have changed the relationship between China and “the West.” Indeed, with so much Chinese emigration and Chinese presence in most societies around the world, the dichotomy no longer makes simple sense. Nonetheless, intellectual habits endure well beyond the advent of social change, and the reader is well advised to be prepared for these Chinese intellectuals not to fit what he or she might expect. The texts included here are not dissent in the classical sense, nor are they Party propaganda. They are sincere intellectual interventions shaped by the strictures of China’s directed public sphere, the expectations of Sinophone discourse, and the social experience of the writers themselves. As academics, we cannot but be influenced by the work of our colleagues in the Western academy who have written extensively on Chinese intellectuals and Chinese public discourse. Since at least the 1950s, the scholarly focus has been on the relationship between intellectuals and the state.35 Scholarship of the 1980s and 1990s focused on the participation of intellectuals in the CCP as establishment intellectuals and their efforts to reform, rather than replace, Maoism by working from within the system.36 More recent studies have focused on the post-1992 period, emphasizing the modification of this establishment role as a result of the increasing impact of a commercial (yet controlled) media and the emergence of formal academic identities and professional responsibilities outside the state bureaucracy.37 Of course, the power and influence of the Party’s propaganda and censorship system remain defining characteristics of Chinese intellectual life. That said, recent research has shown that most intellectuals in today’s China are politically “disestablished” from the Party-state and are\n\n20\n\nIntroduction\n\nfinding unprecedented opportunities as academics and professionals, enjoying study abroad, contact with foreign scholars and diaspora Chinese, better academic pay, and—for the lucky few—considerable earning potential in China’s flourishing book and media markets.38 Scholars engaged in cultural studies have also addressed these issues from a broader cultural and academic Marxist perspective, not least Dai Jinhua and Jing Wang.39 From our perspective, what is most remarkable about today’s public intellectuals in China is that they have found their own voice, which means that their writing is increasingly important for its own sake and on its own terms, as discourse.40 In other words, intellectuals are no longer simply stalking horses for factions within the Party-state, although the political dimension of their work remains significant. The fact that Chinese intellectuals are finding their own public voices opens up new comparative possibilities. New work on knowledge production in Republican China (up to 1950) led by Robert Culp, Eddy U, and Wen-hsin Yeh provides one useful baseline in that intellectuals in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s were similarly engaged and independent.41 We embrace this historicalcomparative perspective. In addition, a project led by Leigh Jenco looks at Chinese thought for what it can contribute to general social theory and provides a vocabulary for comparing Chinese knowledge production with Western examples, particularly in the context of political philosophy.42 This approach highlights the role of Chinese thought beyond China itself. Two new books offer useful surveys of public intellectual debates, one for the benefit of Chinese readers (even though it has recently been partially translated into English) and one for English readers. In early 2012, the Chinese journalist Ma Licheng produced a popular account of eight trends of social thought in contemporary China.43 Ma’s focus is on streams of thought, from “socialism with Chinese characteristics” in the 1980s and the “old leftism” of Maoist thought during the Cultural Revolution to the New Left, democratic socialism, liberalism, nationalism, populism, and New Confucianism. His scope is wider than our focus on academic public intellectuals and by necessity more schematic in such a broad survey.44 In 2015, He Li, a political scientist teaching in the United States, published a valuable survey of political intellectual discourse in China. He, too, surveys the basic three sichao, which he translates as “schools of thought”—Liberal, New Left, and New Confucian—as well as two others: neoauthoritarianism and democratic socialism.45 Finally, some dozen scholars in our research project Reading and Writing the Chinese Dream dig into key issues and notable writers in some detail to see how their arguments build and engage others.46 The voices offered in this volume join a notable collection of fine translations (and some reportage) of Chinese intellectuals and citizens as well as studies focused on their thinking, including Wm. Theodore de Bary and Richard Lufrano, Sources of Chinese Tradition (2000); Gloria Davies, Voicing Concerns\n\nIntroduction\n\n21\n\n(2001); Wang Chaohua, One China, Many Paths (2003); Sang Ye, China Candid (2006);47 Judy Polumbaum, China Ink (2008) (profiles of Chinese journalists); and Angilee Shah and Jeffrey Wasserstrom, Chinese Characters (2012).48 They also join insightful analyses of contemporary Chinese thinking about public affairs, such as Davies, Worrying About China (2007); Mark Leonard, What Does China Think? (2008); Yu Hua, China in Ten Words (2010); and William Callahan, China Dreams (2013).49 Our volume of translations offers a more recent collection of China’s influential thinkers and writers on China’s dream.\n\nCollaborative Translation and the Coproduction of Knowledge The translations in this volume have been produced in part through a process of collaborative translation and a commitment to the coproduction of knowledge. Our approach builds upon previous research by giving priority to Chinese voices over Western frameworks and by working with Chinese scholars in collaborative translations and interpretations of these vital contemporary debates over the Chinese dream. We take as our inspiration the “New Sinology,” an approach articulated by Geremie Barmé, late of the Australian National University, which combines both theory and method.50 New Sinology is grounded in respect for Sinophone discourse and insists that research on contemporary China be based on a deep knowledge of Chinese sources, both the literary and the vernacular lects. Classical Sinology focused largely on the formative texts of China’s traditional civilization, whereas the New Sinology extends its focus to modern and contemporary Chinese discourses and their political and social contexts. This theoretical/methodological perspective in no way excludes mainstream historical and social science approaches but requires that scholarship on China be grounded in Chinese-language sources and that today’s New Sinologists work “with Chinese” rather than simply “on China.” What this means is that we are engaged in collaborative research with Chinese colleagues, not deciphering the messages hidden in their work, an approach that characterized much earlier scholarship on post-1949 China. Our core method in this project—collaborative translation—is essentially new to the treatment of works by China’s contemporary academic public intellectuals. Our inspiration comes from Gloria Davies’s book Voicing Concerns, which problematized the process of translation by transforming it into a collaborative endeavor involving Chinese and foreign scholars in conversation. For example, Davies engaged with the Beijing scholar Liu Dong (b. 1951) on clarifications and emendations to his notable essay criticizing intellectual debate in the 1990s as “pidgin scholarship.”51 We also take inspiration from Gail Hershatter’s collaboration with a Chinese colleague to produce separate books on women’s work in post-1949 China.52 Thus, this introduction is the work of three\n\n22\n\nIntroduction\n\nWestern scholars coming out of the collaborations in this project, while Chinese colleagues are doing likewise and presenting their versions in Chinese. Five of the translations in this volume are direct products of this collaborative process, as noted by the dual translators (one Anglophone, one Sinophone) for specific texts. However, from the orientation to selection of texts and the individual translations, all the work in this volume is shaped by this cooperative and collaborative approach in the international project from which it comes, Reading and Writing the Chinese Dream. This approach is fueled by a particular kind of fieldwork, constructed on the basis of personal and professional relationships between specific Canadian/ Western and Chinese scholars. It is consciously designed to be a sensitive reflection of the production of knowledge in contemporary Chinese intellectual circles to address the challenge of “translating” this production of knowledge in terms understandable by a Canadian/Western audience eager to understand “what China is thinking.” We rely in particular on the project collaborators to strengthen this work. By involving our students (from both Chinese and international universities) in our personal and professional networks, we project the process forward to a new generation, consolidate the linkages between Canadian/Western and Chinese scholars and intellectuals, and seek to produce information of use to scholars, policy makers, and the broader public.\n\nNotes 1.

He first came to prominence during the “culture fever” (wenhua re) of the 1980s as the chief editor of the influential book series Wenhua: Zhongguo yu shijie (Culture: China in the World), which made available hundreds of volumes of translations of Western thought and philosophy to Chinese readers.2 Gan himself studied Western philosophy, first at Peking University and subsequently at the University of Chicago. He is currently dean of the Boya Institute at Zhongshan University in Guangzhou and holds concurrent positions at Tsinghua University and other institutions. Gan’s intellectual orientation has evolved over the years. His engagement with the China in the World series gives the impression that he was a westernizing Liberal in the 1980s, but as he explains in the text translated here, he sees the West not as a model to be followed or imported, but as a body of historical experiences and institutional experiments that China should learn from but only selectively copy, if at all. Gan also identifies with many of the stances of China’s New Left, as illustrated by William Sima and Tang Xiaobing’s translation of his essay “Liberalism: For the Aristocrats or for the People?” in chapter 10, in which Gan’s preference for mass democracy is clear. Gan also embraces\n\n30 PART I: THE CHALLENGE\n\na certain cultural conservatism, as illustrated by his discussion of “unifying the three traditions” in the text translated here, which on occasion positions him close to China’s New Confucians. In the preface to the volume from which this translation is drawn, Gan includes a long discussion of Kang Youwei (1858–1927) and Kang’s efforts to imagine a future world where Confucian civilization would be part of a new universal modernity. Studies of Kang have subsequently become a staple of the mainland New Confucian repertoire, insisting that Kang, rather than Sun Yat-sen or Mao Zedong, should be seen as the architect of modern China.3 Compared with the bombastic tone of many authors touting the “China model” today, the tone of Gan’s text recalls an era when Chinese were more modest about their accomplishments and their heritage. Yet despite its simplicity and its lack of scholarly flourish, this text on “unifying the three traditions” has had an immense impact on the evolution of much of the Chinese thought world in the period since China’s rise. Gan argues that the task before China is to effect the merging of the “three traditions” that undergird China’s modern experience: the Confucian tradition (elitism, affective personal and local relationships), the Maoist tradition (equality and justice), and the Dengist tradition (markets and competition). Gan’s argument is essentially conservative in the sense that he believes that China needs to find a new equilibrium after a century of revolution. Appropriately, his idea of merging the three traditions draws on Confucian discourse concerning the evolution of China’s classical civilization: the “unification” of the varied historical experiences of the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties over the course of the three millennia before China’s first political unification under Qin Shihuang (259–210 BCE). The argument, first advanced by the Confucian scholar Dong Zhongshu (179–104 BCE) in the Western Han period, is that despite important differences in terms of culture and institutions and in spite of the violence that marked dynastic transitions, rulers of the successive dynasties sought out continuities linking one regime to another, which the Zhou kings crystallized into an institutional and ritual order that laid the framework for centuries of enduring, stable Confucian rule. One may question the accuracy of this origin myth. After all, China did not become thoroughly Confucian until the Song dynasty, more than a thousand years after the end of the Zhou period, and thinkers such as Qin Hui (b. 1953) have argued that the basic institutional wiring of China’s classical political order was more Legalist than Confucian.4 But Gan’s argument speaks to a powerful yearning within contemporary Chinese culture to find peace with itself and with its past. He argues, in essence, that Chinese do not have to choose between market efficiency and social justice or between being modern and being Chinese. All they need is the creativity and imagination to rethink China’s recent historical experience in the light of China’s imminent return to great-power status.\n\n“Unifying the Three Traditions” in the New Era\n\n31\n\nIt seems obvious that “unifying the three traditions” cannot occur without ignoring the manifest discontinuities that make up modern Chinese history, but Gan’s proposal electrified the Chinese thought world, and Liberals, New Confucians, and New Leftists began to experiment with the basic periodization of modern and contemporary Chinese history in search of a new formulation that would restore continuity to China’s modern experience. In the process, scholars added and subtracted “traditions” as they sought to fill in the details of Gan’s original template and build their arguments for the kind of state and society they would like China to become. The most audacious among them, such as the mainland New Confucian Chen Ming (b. 1962), basically ignored China’s socialist tradition in their pursuit of a “Confucian interpretation of the China dream.”5 The liberal constitutional scholar Gao Quanxi (b. 1962) built his argument around key “constitutional moments” in modern and contemporary Chinese history that are leading to the establishment of a postrevolutionary order.6 Scholarly enthusiasm for recasting the foundational myths of modern and contemporary China over the past decade has ultimately produced a backlash, however. Gan Yang himself has scolded mainland New Confucians for their overly ardent embrace of Kang Youwei,7 and the legal scholar Jiang Shigong (b. 1967), in what looks to be an authoritative essay issued in 2018 and linked to Xi Jinping’s efforts to reimpose ideological uniformity on China’s thought world, brings the three traditions back onto orthodox ground, identifying them as Mao Zedong’s tradition, in which China stood up; Deng Xiaoping’s tradition, in which China got rich; and Xi Jinping’s tradition, in which China is becoming powerful.8 It is too early to tell if Xi Jinping’s attempts to control China’s narrative will succeed or if the efforts by Chinese intellectuals to rethink China’s recent past and future will continue. (One might note that Xi himself has on varying occasions embraced Gan’s three traditions.) In any event, Gan Yang’s essay on “unifying the three traditions” stands as one of the most influential texts shaping intellectual currents in the age of rising China.\n\n“Unifying the Three Traditions” in the New Era: The Merging of Three Chinese Traditions (Lecture presented at Tsinghua University on May 12, 2005)\n\nThe Coexistence of Three Traditions in Contemporary China At present, we can identify three traditions in China. One is the tradition that has taken shape after twenty-five years of reform. Although this is not a lengthy tradition, many ideas and terms that have grown out of reform and opening\n\n32 PART I: THE CHALLENGE\n\nare already deeply impressed on the people’s minds and have entered into the daily language of the Chinese people, basically becoming a kind of tradition. This tradition has, for the most part, grown out of the “market” and includes many concepts with which we all are familiar today, such as freedom and rights. Another tradition began with the establishment of the People’s Republic and took form during the Mao Zedong era. This is a tradition characterized particularly by its emphasis on equality and justice. It is clear today that from the mid- to late-1990s the Maoist tradition of equality has been quite powerful, and beginning in the mid-1990s there has been a great deal of discussion of the Mao era. Ten years earlier, this would have seemed impossible, but the Maoist tradition of equality has become a powerful tradition in contemporary China. Finally, of course, there is also the tradition of Chinese civilization, forged over thousands of years. This is what we often call “traditional Chinese culture” or “Confucian culture.” It is often difficult to describe traditional Chinese culture, but in the everyday life of the Chinese people it is basically expressed, to put it simply, in terms of interpersonal relationships and ties of locality. This can be seen very clearly in many current television dramas in today’s China, especially those focusing on the family or on marriage and divorce. The coexistence of these three traditions is a unique feature of Chinese society, particularly on the Chinese mainland. If we make a comparison with Hong Kong society, we note that it has the first tradition (the tradition of markets and freedom) as well as the third tradition (highly developed sensitivity to interpersonal relations and ties of locality), but it lacks the second tradition, a tradition with a strong emphasis on “equality.” For this reason, even if Hong Kong is a highly unequal society, and even if many people are working to relieve this inequality, the problem of inequality has never provoked an intense ideological conflict. From another perspective, if we make a comparison with the United States, it has the first two traditions, with a strong emphasis on both freedom and equality—in fact, we might say that the tension between these two traditions constitutes the basic national character of the United States—but America does not have the third tradition and thus pays less attention to interpersonal relationships and locality ties and especially lacks the cultural traditions and cultural psychology that lie behind China’s third tradition. Yet we often observe in discussions in contemporary China that these three traditions seem to be placed in a position of mutual opposition. Some people will particularly emphasize one tradition while rejecting the others. Everyone has surely felt that Chinese society since the 1990s has been full of debate and that these debates have come to influence even people’s individual lives. Good friends whose relationships go back for decades suddenly have opposing viewpoints, and when the divergences become important, the friendship is threatened, which leaves everyone hurt. This is because in some of these larger debates,\n\n“Unifying the Three Traditions” in the New Era\n\n33\n\nin particular those concerning the Mao era, differences of opinion are significant, and the debates easily become emotional. The topic of today’s lecture, “the uniting of the three traditions and the revival of Chinese civilization,” is based on an interview published at the end of 2004 in Ershiyi Shiji Jingji Baodao (Economic reporting on the twenty-first century). In that interview, I talked in premature and simplistic terms about my view that today we need a new understanding of the linkages and continuity between the success of reform and opening and the Mao era as well as a new understanding of the foundational role that traditional Chinese history and civilization have played in modern China. The main point of my talk today is to emphasize that the Confucian tradition, the Mao Zedong tradition, and the Deng Xiaoping tradition all belong to a unified continuity in China’s history and civilization. To use the terms of the Gongyang tradition,9 we need to “unify the three traditions” of the new age.\n\nWhat Is “the Problem of Chinese Culture?” It seems that most people today can readily accept a positive vision of China’s traditional culture or that even if there are differences of opinion, these differences don’t necessarily lead to fights that hurt people’s feelings. But this is something that has evolved only over the past two or three years, and in the past discussions of traditional Chinese culture often led to violent disagreements. The reason for this is that behind the problem of Chinese culture in fact lies the problem of the opposition of Chinese and Western culture. What you say about Chinese culture reveals what you think about Western culture and often contains a hidden comparison of China and the West, which speaks to the debate between Chinese and Western culture that has raged incessantly across the entire twentieth century. In the 1980s, Chinese intellectuals were most worked up about the so-called culture fever (wenhua re), which in fact was nothing more than yet another “debate about Chinese and Western culture.” The good thing about the debate in the 1980s was that it led contemporary Chinese intellectuals back to the problem of Chinese tradition that had agonized Chinese intellectuals from late-Qing times onward. This problem reflected “changes unprecedented in three thousand years,”10 the fact that beginning in the late Qing all of Chinese civilization disintegrated, completely fell apart, including not only the political system and the economic system but also the cultural and educational institutions, which meant that beginning in the twentieth century Chinese intellectuals, whether studying China or the West, consistently invoked the West as their authority. They might mention Confucius but would never cite him as an authority. This seems to have started to change over the past few\n\n34 PART I: THE CHALLENGE\n\nyears, and at the end of 2004 Nanfang Zhoumo (Southern weekend) and other mainland periodicals asserted that 2004 was the year of the return of traditional culture. This year marks the centenary of the abolition of the Confucian examination system. People today have a hard time imagining what the abolition of the exams meant, what kind of attack the abolition was on Chinese intellectuals of the period. By way of comparison, imagine today’s Tsinghua students, who tested into middle school from primary school, from middle school to high school, and from high school into university. What if when you graduated, there was an announcement saying that everything you had studied to that point was useless, that your studies were not going to help you find a job? What would you think? You would surely go crazy, and some would surely think about jumping off a building. The shock would be that great. Can you imagine this sort of attack? The disintegration of Chinese society at the time was thorough and comprehensive. What was the examination system? Today’s Chinese are used to thinking about the examination system dismissively. But at the simplest level, the examination system was a basic mechanism for the reproduction of the elite system of Chinese society as a whole. In traditional China, in theory all students could take the exams. Of course, not many would make the top (jinshi) level, but all students would think about taking the exams, and at a subconscious level they would identify with the thought and the lifestyle of the Chinese traditional elites. So even if you did not become a jinshi, you were still part of China’s elite. And you could keep trying year after year; in the traditional Chinese exam system there was no age limit, so you could keep trying until you were in your seventies or eighties. Sometimes, even if you still failed, the emperor would be impressed by your age and would grant you a jinshi. Why? So that China’s latent elite would always have hope; it functioned to maintain the reproduction of the elite system. From its beginnings in the Sui-Tang period, the examination system endured for at least thirteen hundred years and was traditional China’s most basic political-cultural mechanism. The abolition of the examination system in the late Qing simply meant the thorough collapse and disintegration of the entirety of the traditional Chinese political-cultural mechanism. With its collapse, China faced the vast mission of reorganizing its society. For a society like this to establish a new set of mechanisms is no easy task. In the West, the transition from tradition to modernity required several centuries, while in China only a century or so has transpired since the Qing collapsed. We today are still living this transition, and we must see the entire process, from the late-Qing collapse through the Chinese revolution and reform, as a continuous process whose goal is the search for a new continuity on which to base modern China.\n\n“Unifying the Three Traditions” in the New Era\n\n35\n\nFamiliarity Is Not True Knowledge The American Joshua Ramo [b. 1968, vice chairman and co–chief executive of Kissinger Associates] recently coined the concept of the “Beijing Consensus” and argued that it had already displaced the “Washington Consensus.”11 The concrete details of his argument are debatable, but the point of his initiative is to remind us that understanding China is extremely difficult and requires going beyond popular clichés. From the Western perspective, the biggest problem of the twenty-first century is China. China is a problem for the West because the West has already ruled the world for several centuries, and the Westerndominated world has created a certain number of norms and procedures. Today’s China is like someone who just crashed the party, which has led the entire system to waver. What is to be done? What will China be like in the future? No one knows. Two o"
