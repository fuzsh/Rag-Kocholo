The results showed that plumbagin in vitro significantly inhibited adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-, arachidonic acid (AA)-, or platelet activating factor (PAF)-induced platelet aggregation, in a concentration-dependent manner. The medium inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were 39.4, 82.7 and 38.1 μM, respectively. Intragastric plumbagin at 10 mg/kg markedly suppressed platelet aggregation induced by ADP, AA, or PAF. Plumbagin decreased the binding between thrombin-stimulated platelets and neutrophils with an IC50 of 62.9 μM. Plumbagin significantly inhibited washed platelet aggregation stimulated by fMLP- or PAF-activated neutrophils. The IC50 values were 54.3 and 47.6 μM, respectively. On the other hand, plumbagin and aspirin increased the inhibition of intact neutrophils on AA-induced platelet aggregation. It is suggested that plumbagin inhibited platelet aggregation in vitro and ex vivo, suppressed the binding of activated platelets to neutrophils, inhibited platelet aggregation induced by activated neutrophils, and increased inhibition of intact neutrophils on platelet reactivity.\n\nAbbreviations\n\nDMSO:dimethyl sulphoxide\n\nfMLP:N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine\n\nADP:adenosine diphosphate\n\nAA:arachidonic acid\n\nPAF:platelet activating factor\n\nKey words\n\nPlumbagin - platelet aggregation - platelet-neutrophil interactions\n\nReferences\n\n1 Bendnar M, Smith B, Pinto A, Mullane K.
