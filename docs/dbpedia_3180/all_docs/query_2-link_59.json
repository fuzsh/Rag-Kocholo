        "text": "ICIP is the premier international forum for the technological advances and research results in the fields of theoretical, experimental, and applied image and video processing. The series is sponsored by the IEEE Signal Processing Society and has been held annually since 1994. Research frontiers in fields ranging from traditional image processing applications to evolving multimedia and video technologies are regularly advanced by results first reported in ICIP technical sessions. Topics include, but are not limited to: Procedure 1. Send notice of intent to bid to the Vice President â€“ Conferences and SPS Conference Services staff at sps-conf-proposals@ieee.org. Include in the notice your contact information and the proposed dates and location. 2. Conference Services staff will issue the proposal submission forms upon receipt of the letter of intent. 3. The forms must be completed and the proposal submitted to the Conference Services staff at least three months prior to the next ICIP m...\n\nInternational Conference on Signal Processing and Communication - ICSPC'17 July 28-29 2017 Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India The conference aims to bring together the Scientists, Scholars, Engineers, Industrialists and Students from in and around the world to present and share their knowledge and experience on the on-going research activities and hence to foster research relations between universities and industries. This conference provides opportunities for the delegates to exchange new ideas, insights, applications and experiences, to establish research relations and to find global partners for collaborations and to solve future problems in signal processing and communication. === Important Dates === March 15, 2017........................Tutorial Special Session proposals March 15, 2017.........................Paper submission deadline April 15, 2017........................... Notification of acceptance April 30, 2017............................Camera-ready paper submission July 28-29, 2017........................ICSPC17 Conference The authors are invited to submit technical papers of their original, unpublished work under the below-mentioned sub-themes.
