        "text": "By the early 1980s the American film industry had begun its obsession with big-concept blockbuster films, and Altman’s direction of Paramount’s big-budget musical Popeye (1980), with Robin Williams in the title role, seemed to have kept the filmmaker in the Hollywood mainstream. That Altman was an unusual choice for the project seemed immaterial until the film failed to deliver the sort of big profits the studio had expected. Thereafter the major studios turned their backs on Altman, whose filmmaking approach they now deemed too unconventional, iconoclastic, and, ultimately, unmarketable. As a result, Altman spent the 1980s working on smaller projects, many of which were low-budget adaptations of stage plays.\n\nUsing Super 16-mm cameras, he took 19 days to film Come Back to the 5 & Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (1982), a play he had directed on Broadway. Black, Sandy Dennis, and Cher starred. Streamers (1983), adapted by David Rabe from his Broadway play, focused on a group of army inductees waiting in their barracks for the call to Vietnam, and Secret Honor (1984), shot on 16-mm film at the University of Michigan, captured the one-man show in which Philip Baker Hall ranted and raved as Richard Nixon.\n\nAltman also directed The Laundromat (1985) for Canadian television; made a film version of Sam Shepard’s claustrophobic play Fool for Love in 1985, with Shepard playing one of the leading roles; and adapted Christopher Durang’s play Beyond Therapy in 1987. The teen comedy O.C. & Stiggs had marked a brief return to work for a major studio (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer), but it lingered long on the shelf before receiving a release in 1985. Prominent among Altman’s television work during this period were The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial (1988) for CBS; the groundbreaking HBO political satire Tanner ’88 (1988), a collaboration with cartoonist Garry Trudeau that revolved around the campaign of a presidential candidate played by Murphy and that included interactions with real-life politicians; and Vincent & Theo (1990), which originated as a miniseries for European television.\n\nAltman made a triumphant return to the big screen in 1992 with The Player, a corrosive portrait of the film industry that hinged on a particularly potent performance by Tim Robbins, as a rising studio executive who kills to advance his career, and that included an abundance of cameos by well-known actors. Altman was nominated for an Academy Award as best director, and the film received a nomination for best picture. He was nominated again for his direction of Short Cuts (1993), an ambitious, three-hour-plus adaptation of nine short stories by Raymond Carver that was reminiscent of Nashville in its character-driven kaleidoscopic structure. Less accomplished than these two efforts was Prêt-à-Porter (1994), an impressionistic look at the world of Paris couture that reteamed iconic actors Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni."
