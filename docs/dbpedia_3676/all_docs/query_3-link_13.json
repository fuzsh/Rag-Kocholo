        "text": "Intelligent (or at least interesting) character studies don't require intricate plots. Capiche, Stevie King fans?\n\n8/10\n\nThis movie is proof that a pretentious drama can be good. Perhaps it is true that Altman was trying to rip off Bergman’s overrated “Persona”, but either way 3W is superior to this half-baked, taste-free Swedish meatball, so it makes no difference even if he did choose a pompous Swedish director’s non-masterpiece as something to bow down to and perhaps be “inspired” by. Bergman can only wish he had a tenth of Altman’s skill-set and diversity; the Swede was mostly limited to suicidal relationship soapers, whereas Altman successfully wrote-directed several very different movies.\n\nBesides, Altman got the idea for 3W from a dream he had. No, not a wet dream, despite the fact that Sissy was in it. Interestingly enough, the dream involved Spacek and Duvall in a desert backdrop. So it is questionable how much influence Bergman had on this. Certainly the idea for initiating this particular film didn’t come from any “Persona” worship. Not to mention that they are two very different films. And anyway, how do we know that Bergman didn’t take cue’s from Polanski’s “Repulsion”?\n\nSPOILERS\n\nAltman’s choice of an atonal score, plus many close-ups of the demonic drawings, don’t have any concrete meaning, whether they were intended to or not being of no interest to me, but they are valuable in terms of helping create a unique mood – which separates this movie from practically all other dramas. Sure, the excellent “Images” that he shot several years earlier also dealt with the female psyche, or to be more specific with female mental instability, but the two films have little in common aside from the atonality and the basic theme of insanity. That was much more of psychological horror mystery whereas 3W is almost 100% character study, with only smaller doses of mystery and tiny doses of horror.\n\nDuvall’s and Spacek’s characters are very well defined, and interesting throughout. Both are great, but Spacek steals the show with what is by far her best role. There is plenty of pathos related to Duvall’s Millie, and a good measure of weird childishness related to Spacek’s Pinky, around whom the mystery exists. Her background is foggy, and her subsequent loss of memory after the suicide attempt only adds to the questions about her, because at times she acts almost like an alien visiting Earth, disguised as a woman.\n\nWhat I found very interesting, content-wise, are the shifts in power between the two women. (The film is called 3W, but in fact it’s about these two.) At first Millie is the wacky insecure eccentric who almost autistically fails to realize that she is unpopular and largely ignored. She is treated as almost invisible by most people, yet she either blocks this out as a possibility because she can’t handle it, or she is genuinely deluded i.e. slightly crazy. At the beginning Pinky is submissive and Millie is increasingly arrogant and hostile toward her, egotistical even. After the suicide attempt, Pinky gets the “upper hand”: whether through Millie’s guilt or Pinky’s own memory loss (or both), Pinky starts dominating.\n\nThis goes on for a while, until Pinky fails to hail a doctor for the 3rd woman’s birth, which ends in a stillbirth. Out of guilt, or shock, Pinky reverts back to her weird child-like behavior whereas Millie appears to me “empowered”, though far from happy. Millie is in fact very clearly not a happy person, and neither is the pregnant 3rd woman stuck in a bad marriage. Pinky sticks out as the cheerful, naïve country girl, unjaded in ways the others are. However, there can be no talk of some “alienation” theme, which gets left-wingers all wet, because the world Altman creates here isn’t real, it isn’t 70s America hence cannot be construed as any kind of “subtle critique of U.S. society”, much less capitalism – and we know that THIS is what left-wing film buffies always want to find in any drama. After all, the extent to which everyone brushes off and ignores Millie is obviously totally exaggerated, regardless of Altman’s directorial style which tends to make things look very realistic. Yet there is a big difference between the trademark realistic altmanian dialog and how the characters actually behave. Nearly everybody is strangely aloof (which is/was not typical of Americans at all) except the two women and the pregnant woman’s unfaithful husband, who turns out to be a central character in many ways. He is the only one, aside from the two, who seems to have a personality. All the others only engage in murmuring and one-dimensional wallpaper behavior.\n\nThe major end-twist however isn’t that the roles had gone back to “normal” between Pinky and Millie, it’s the fact that the women conspired to punish the husband by murdering him with one of his own guns, making it out to be an accident.\n\nAside from these two things – murder and the 2nd reversal – the film has no true ending. It doesn’t need to have one, it’s a character-based drama hence no need for convoluted plot-twists, numerous goings-on and what-not.\n\nAs for style, the film greatly benefits from that unsurpassed 70s grainy visual quality plus great photography.\n\nThis film is definitely not for everybody, not just because it has so little “real” plot, because it’s so blatantly non-commercial (the kind of film that could NEVER have been made nowadays, despite two-three women being the focus), but primarily because it’s so depressive a lot of the time, mainly due to the score and the slow pace.\n\nViewings: 90s, 00s, 2023\n\n5/10\n\nI was probably not even 20 when this played on TV. I have never had any inclination to re-visit it, because I sense I might be somewhat bored by the incessant babbling, and perhaps annoyed by how Altman portrays this segment of the American populace, him being a pompous, elitist Red film-maker and all...\n\nPlus I know how it ends, so really, no re-visit is likely. The rating is hence a guess.\n\nVery old review, from the 90s:\n\nA clever film with rather thick, complex characterizations, done with the trademark Altman \"it-all-sounds-like-real-people-and-not-actors-because-it's-partly-improvised\" style of film-making. Fortunately, unlike \"McCabe & Miller\", the dialogues rarely overlap and interfere with each other so that it's possible to follow almost all of them, without getting lost in a huge murmur of incomprehensible babble - as is the case with the other film.\n\nHowever, \"Nashville\", with all of its realism, and with it's almost documentary, fly-on-the-wall feel to it, is not up there with Altman's best, despite what the critics say. The main drawback is the music. Altman's (commendable) striving for advanced realism backfired in the music department; in his quest for realism he got the actors to not only sing country songs, but to actually write a lot of them. Bad idea. Voice-overs from real country singers would have made the music much more pleasant to the viewer's ears, and - ironically - would have made the film sound more realistic. It's far too obvious to anyone with half a hearing problem that the singing ranges from passable (Black) to mediocre (Gibson, Harris) to unbearable (Carradine). Country stars of that era were of a better calibre than the crap we get today.\n\nIn fact, listening to Carradine's rendition of his own song \"I'm Easy\" was torture to my poor, already MTV-raped ears. Considering that the songs and the singing are both blah, there are too many musical segments that go on for too long.\n\nI can also nit-pick at the casting; why this talented man sees talent where there is none (or little) as is the case with Chaplin's daughter and Carradine, is beyond me. Geraldine Chaplin's fake-sounding English accent (in spite of her Papa's British background), and Carradine's stone-face (non-)expressions are certainly not what great acting is all about. The rest of the cast is good. Nevertheless, especially in the 90s, Altman has shown a troubling tendency to cast his movies not with the best people available, but with nepotist kids. I don't understand that at all.\n\nAs for his (left-wing) politics, Altman wrongly picked the country music scene as the platform for critiquing celebrity endorsement, American politics, and America in general. It's not a bad choice - perhaps - but then again he could also make a movie about Hollywood's left-wing endorsements and the corruption, drugs, and abuse of power there.\n\nI'm kidding, of course he never will. He is a hypocrite.\n\nAltman is - allegedly - more at odds with Hollywood than he is their friend, so why doesn't he mock Hollywood's political involvement?\n\nHe has no issue with pathetic braindead movie stars endorsing the Democrats, or things he agrees with, so he doesn't touch that. As pathetic as Nashville's behind-the-scenes world is portrayed here (the accuracy of it being debatable), I can guarantee that a look behind Hollywood's facade would reveal a world that is far more pathetic, sleazy, and fake than the one shown here in this alttmanized version of Nashville.\n\nThe film is rather long, and would flow more smoothly if the musical segments had been either improved by professionals, or cut-down significantly.\n\nFirst Viewing: probably early 90s\n\nAn unsubtle display of hatred for wealthy American conservatives, badly presented through the use of unsubtle and sometimes downright idiotic humour.\n\n4/10\n\nI'd literally never heard of this film until very recently, despite it being from his more fruitful period, the 70s.\n\nIt's a typical Altman film, with zillion characters (yeah, it's a wealthy people's wedding so there's a good excuse for it this time) babbling a lot, non-stop, in the usual \"casual/spontaneous\" Altman way.\n\nThe Church intro is overly long, and generally speaking the first half-hour is very slow and only mildly interesting.\n\nThings then improve, as we get better acquainted with the multitude of characters - as much as that is even possible when you have only 120 minutes for 20-30 of them - and so there are a few good jokes here and there. Though more bad than good.\n\nUnfortunately, after the half-way mark the humour degrades, becoming too absurd hence unfunny.\n\nLet me clarify (the obvious): there are different types of comedies. Some are subtle (the satires), some extremely unsubtle and broad (farce), and some deal in absurdist humour (ZAZ for example). Altman believed he could inject a few absurdist gags and cheap shticks into a basically satiric film, which leads to several idiotic scenes.\n\nSPOILERS\n\nFor example, the ridiculous, far-fetched and utterly unfunny scene when BOTH the bride and the groom start French-kissing their \"former\" lovers, and in front of everybody. Tt the same time even, the couples standing next to each other.\n\nThis is so asinine, I can't believe it made it in the first draft (if it was there), let alone the final script. Now, if he had both the bride and groom SNEAKING a kiss in one of the rooms or the park, that would have worked. Perhaps not in a comedic way, but certainly it would have avoided degrading this at times solid comedy into a very stupid one (that wants to be clever too).\n\nBasically, Altman wanted the perennial cake. You can't have it both ways. You can't have a clever satire and idiotic absurdist jokes. Satire is closely related to reality, in fact it is based in reality, whereas absurdist comedy is only vaguely rooted in our world, it's more of a weird parallel universe type of thing. Once you CHANGE your comedic approach halfway through you've ruined the movie. You can't do that. You choose one approach and stick with it.\n\nAnother example is when a security member (this is an upper-class VIP/political wedding) actually PHYSICALLY prevents the bride's father from covering up the naked painting. Why the f*** would the security give a toss what he does with the painting? And how would the security DARE use physical force on a VIP person, at the same time a key person at the wedding? Altman and the other writers (a bunch of them, which is rarely a good thing) completely lost themselves in these kinds of scenes. They lost focus and went for cheap, completely illogical jokes that simply aren't funny.\n\nThe fact that this painting was handed to the newlyweds as a gift in the first place, at a VIP wedding, in front of so many people, is in itself quite dumb. Who'd gift the bride and groom a painting of the bride naked, at a conservative upper-class wedding?! Hence it's not funny. You can do this in an absurdist comedy or a farce, it'd be a great gag, but in a satire this is high cringe.\n\nAnother dumb scene that involved security is when they pounced on an innocent man whom they found upstairs after everyone had been evacuated into the basement. Complete and utter crap. If you're going to make top-notch security people out to be incompetent loose-cannon clowns then just go all the way and do an absurdist comedy or cheesy farce instead. At the latest after 90 minutes, this comedy had deteriorated from being a satire of the American upper-class to a silly physical comedy, almost a farce in places.\n\nThese serious security tuxedo types could have been mocked far more efficiently by using subtle methods, not broad, dumb comedy that crushes satire.\n\nRemember a golden comedy rule: humour (in satire) works only if it is believable i.e. credible enough. If it veers too far from reality then there is no longer a satiric element hence the entire foundation crumbles. A movie that neglects its own logic or contradicts its own style is doomed to fail. Beginners errors from Altman and his writers..\n\nAnother thing I disliked is the use of clumsiness to score cheap laughs. Whether it be the bishop acting as wedding priest or other characters stepping on each other's feet, I didn't find these scenes of \"mild slapstick\" suitable for the tone and style of this comedy. I expected more intelligent humour, not people dropping things or whatever. Any ass can write such crap. (Admittedly, Burnett and the big fat guy bumping into each other on a field was funny, but only because their relationship as a whole was very entertaining - the only truly funny sub-plot.)\n\nAfter the hurricane evacuation, everybody starts singing a stupid Church song, over and over, like a bunch of moron cult followers, which further killed the realism of this \"satire\". This isn't remotely how the upper-class would behave in such a situation, but Altman (who was... what he was) couldn't quite resist poking a bit of fun at \"white Christians\", the all-time favourite target of snotty liberals, but he did this in a way that doesn't seem believable at all. Seems too forced, as in forcing things to be stereotypically satirical - kinda the way Michael Moore cheats and manipulates events/interviews in his \"documentaries\" to mock certain demographics by intentionally misrepresenting them. In that sense, Altman was very politically-correct, before the term even existed. Besides, there is an unintended irony in this scene: this is what any random left-wing hippie commune might be more liable to do i.e. chant some stupid spiritual song, over and over, like fanatical Hare Krishnas. Not that Altman would have noticed the irony, i.e. this blatant similarity between the religious eccentricities/habits of Christians and hippies i.e. young Marxists (whom Altman supported).\n\nSpeaking of ironies, I was pleasantly surprised by the scene in which a blonde berates the elderly Socialist woman for being a hypocrite i.e. (paraphrasing) \"you too seem to live well off your wealth, which you haven't exactly shared with the working class\". I am amazed that this line made it into the movie, because I've practically never heard anything of that nature in an American film before. Imagine the mega-reverse-hypocrisy though (or whatever we can call it), because Altman himself never \"shared his fortune\" with the proletariat - yet he mocked OTHER left-wing hypocrites who do the same! Wow, what cajones he had. What a sanctimonious phony.\n\nThis is why he was politically speaking just another Hollywood \"do-gooder\" with nothing intelligent to convey about American society. He was comfortable only with tackling Christian/Republican/conservative hypocrisy (i.e. all these people at the wedding having affairs left and right and taking drugs - yet singing Church songs), yet where is the grand big satire exposing champagne Socialists? One line such as the one above doesn't even begin to cover it. Certainly in the absurdly overrated \"The Player\" he completely missed an opportunity to expose the massive decadence and hypocrisy of the Hollywood elites, who are nearly all left-wing and knee-deep in (illegal) debauchery. And as a supposed \"maverick director\" he was expected to do just that. Yet he chickened out. But that's just it, Altman was neither an equal-opportunity offender nor an insightful social critic. He was very partisan and biased in whom to \"expose\" and ridicule, comparable to the way CNN does 10,000 hours annually about Trump's \"evil\" and \"racism\", yet zero hours on anything negative about Obama or Biden - despite there being 100,000 hours worthy of dodgy stuff to discuss about those two \"peaceniks\". Hence why as a political and even social commentator he was absolutely useless. Whoever does satire always in a one-sided manner loses all credibility as a preacher of morality, and the films suffer for it.\n\nThe Carroll Burnett sub-plot is good though. The tall fat guy dancing with Burnett then persistently flirting with her was funny, very good situation comedy, but unfortunately just a small part of a movie too full of a multitude of characters, some of whom are plain awful such as the drunk woman. Their silly dance is not absurdist enough to not be funny, it is within-reason silliness. Nevertheless, his pushiness borders on sexual harassment, making some of these moments a little uncomfortable, because he is literally three times her weight and size, so whenever he corners her somewhere with no paths toward escape, which he does repeatedly, you have an uneasy feeling that she is totally helpless next to this lunatic who could easily force himself on her if he wanted to. Their chemistry works because these two roles were very well cast - in a movie full of sub-par casting.\n\nAltman sometimes assembled a cast of nobodies, nepotists and homely women, and this is one such movie. So many boring actors in this one. Dezi Arnaz, Geraldine Chaplin, Mia Farrow, not to mention the many obscure and dull actors. Why did he cast Geraldine so often? That woman had nothing going for her, zero: not looks, not talent, not charisma. My guess is that many film-makers who were Chaplin fanboys simply wanted to suck up to him by casting his daughter in films that were way above her skill-set.\n\nFirst Viewing: 2023\n\nWhen a Communist makes a “revisionist” western. Altman stops short of portraying Buffalo Bill like Yosemite Sam.\n\n2/10\n\nRead up the definition of “revisionist western”. It is a genre that ALLEGEDLY avoids portraying “cowboys” and “Injuns” in simplistic black-and-white terms, but instead goes for a much more realistic approach.\n\nWell, that’s the theory, anyway. In practice, these so-called “revisionist” westerns are to often simply the flip-side of pro-cowboy/anti-Indian westerns of the 20s and 30s: they are anti-white/pro-Indian. As simple as that. Instead of depicting the Wild West in non-biased terms, which they allegedly do (according to Red movie critics, who are not to be trusted on any political issue or movie), they simply deify Native Americans while portraying white settlers as evil scum.\n\nFilms such as this “revisionist western” inject their scripts with very generous lashings of “proto white guilt” i.e. early liberal self-loathing, the kind of which experienced a boom in the 90s, then completely massacred American culture and politics in this century, taking over every facet of American life, like a deadly pandemic that attacks the host’s brain and utterly pulverizes it until there is nothing left in it but empty Antifa slogans.\n\nOnce America was “fully” colonized, suddenly all these virtue-signaling voices started popping out, becoming loud and louder, moaning increasingly and ever more stupidly about how “America was taken away by evil Europeans from their rightful owners”. A very dubious and useless claim; dubious because almost EVERY NATION in existence today had been “taken away” by force from someone or other, and useless because what do you plan to do about it? Hand the few remaining Indians their lands back? I haven’t noticed Altman, Newman, Lancaster and other Hollywood liberals rushing to gift their ranches and villas to any Native Americans, just as none of them ever got involved in “wealth redistribution” i.e. giving away their many millions of dollars to the “proletariat” that they supposedly love so much…\n\n(On a side-note, there is this great irony of rich liberal celebs i.e. champagne socialists treating the Average Joe in the street with far more rudeness and arrogance than right-wing celebs, often behaving very entitled and not-at-all like “lower-class-loving Communists”, a trend I’d noticed a long time – and which makes perfect sense because the Left attracts lunatics and narcissists far more than the moderate Right does… Narcissists find a great haven in the Far Left, because it acts as a shield to their true nature, i.e. impersonating a do-gooder (when you’re the exact opposite of a good person) is like a wealthy mobster trying to buy himself a positive image by donating money to build hospitals. The same or very similar psychology is behind both these demographics: the wealthy famous celeb and the stinking rich mobster.)\n\nOr do you know of any such examples, of celebs handing out their possessions to Indians, to “even out the injustices”? Not even Brando did, and he was so cringingly vocal about “Native American rights”. Of course, the whole charade was all just an ego trip for him, one of many…\n\nIf you were to ask which is more biased, more simplistic, more stupid – the “cowboy hero” westerns or the “noble savage” white-guilt westerns – I would declare it a tie, probably. The western genre anyway bores me tremendously (with just a few rare exceptions), but these heavily biased/simplistic westerns are roughly equally worthless.\n\nAltman doesn’t give three hoots about the truth, historical facts – any of that. This is a huge con, and an obvious one. Altman’s motives are far more nefarious and hidden, and smart people reading this will know what I am referring to, if they can read between the lines…\n\nHis anti-capitalism drove him to direct such a movie. His hatred of capitalist democracy motivated him to write this politically-correct garbage. His frustration with the SUCCESS of democracy and capitalism in America (and the West in general) is at the root of movies such as this, these propaganda turds devised to hate on capitalism, history, tradition, white settlers i.e. anything that is rooted in the European Success Story, which later translated itself into the American Success Story. The Kremlin was thrilled about such movies, it was (and still is) as if the Kremlin itself dominated and controlled Hollywood – without actually having to do so.\n\nFar from this movie being a “history lesson”, or even a “clever satire”, it is in fact an abysmally unfunny, staunchly political propagandist, Marxist piece of crap. The humour is too basic and obvious i.e. there is next to nothing clever about it, and it is too awash with barely-disguised Marxist preaching to have the opportunity to be funny.\n\nAltman was as communist as you got, in the Hollywood of the 70s. Not as extremist as Maoists such as Costa-Gavras and Bertolucci, i.e. that whole European gang, but pretty far to the Left. As this movie, among a few others, clearly demonstrates.\n\nThe way Altman plays the U.S. national anthem is so full of anti-American sentiment, I’d even go far as to call it pure hatred. I mean, I too hate that damn tune, but I do so for music reasons, coz the tune stinks. Altman hates it because – to him - it represents the sound of success of western capitalism. How on Earth do you turn America communist if the system is workin?!! That’s been the age-old question for American socialists since the 40s. That frustration always seeps into the more overtly political liberal Hollywood films. Despite the fact that this movie isn’t DIRECTLY related to this hatred of capitalism and democracy, these things are very cleatrly linked. “Support” (i.e. virtue-signaling) for American Indians is only a thinly-veiled show of disapproval for the American “way of life”, which is consumerist i.e. capitalistically successful.\n\nBurt Lancaster, the film’s “voice of reason” i.e. voice of liberalism, talks about Bill’s “pack of lies”, which is the typical kind of facepalm irony one gets from these left-wing propaganda films. As a communist, Altman wouldn’t know truth if it fell on his head like a 16-ton weight.\n\nBesides, throwing in this kind of 100% humourless, holier-than-thou cheap preaching only kills the humour even more. And anyway: whenever a film-maker prioritizes political indoctrination over humour in a comedy, then that comedy is doomed to fail, by definition. Many such comedies had failed, pretty much for this exact reason.\n\nIf Altman really wanted to make a “revisionist” western i.e. one devoid of political posturing, devoid of bias, and in keeping with the history of humans (as opposed to a history that distinguished between the “goodness” of races), i.e. if he really had wanted to do a properly realistic western, he would have not portrayed Sitting Bull and his friends in such a romanticized way. Buffalo Bill is an egocentric buffoon, with numerous character faults – while Sitting Bull has more dignity than 300 Dalai Lamas. Laughable… Reverse racism, the proto version.\n\nFirst Viewing: 2023"
