        "text": "Director Robert Altman had two films in release in 1970. The first was his breakthrough film, M*A*S*H, his black comedy about medics in the Korean War. The other was Brewster McCloud and the two films couldn’t have been more dissimilar. Both had healthy streaks of satire but where M*A*S*H was laser focused on its depiction of the horrors of war Brewster McCloud is more scattershot, Altman and his credited screenwriter Doran William Cannon firing barbs in all directions. Not all of them hit their targets (the film is a failure but an honourable one) but there are plenty of odd moments scattered through its plot to make it interest.\n\nAltman plays tricks with film itself throughout Brewster McCloud. It opens with René Auberjonois’ ornithology lecturer (who will keep popping up looking increasingly worse for wear as the film goes along) announcing, “I forgot the opening lines” and within minutes, the film starts again after Margaret Hamilton’s tone deaf Daphne Heap murders the American national anthem and forces the school band accompanying to do it again when “they” get it wrong. Her performance is watched at a distance by Louise (Sally Kellerman) who has befriended the owlish young Brewster McCloud (Burt Cort) who lives in a small room somewhere in the enormous Houston Astrodome where he dreams of being able to fly. He works as a driver and whipping boy for the monstrous elderly landlord Abraham Wright (Stacy Keach) who becomes one of the victims of a strange series of murders that are haunting the people of Houston, the victims being strangled to death and covered in bird droppings.\n\nLouise seems to encourage Brewster’s fantasies but bears strange scars on her shoulder blades, as if wings have been surgically removed (it’s hinted throughout that she might be Brewster’s guardian angel) and cautions him to remain a virgin as sex will only blunt his instinct to fly. But Brewster has met and is attracted to tour guide Suzanne Davis (Shelley Duvall), “San Francisco super cop” Frank Shaft (Michael Murphy) has been flown in to investigate the killings and all roads seem to lead to Brewster who has finished work on his mechanical wings…\n\nThe Brewster McCloud we know today isn’t the Brewster McCloud written by Cannon. It was one of the most talked about scripts of the late 1960s around Hollywood, but Altman threw most of what Cannon had written out of the window and set about taking the basic idea off into directions more aligned to his own concerns, rewriting the script with uncredited collaborators. Cannon was so enraged by what Altman did that he took to the editorial column of the The New York Times to vent his anger.\n\nThe result isn’t a particularly subtle film – the satire is something of a blunt weapon in Altman’s hands but it’s still very funny (though the running gag about people being dumped on birds outstays its welcome) if occasionally completely mystifying. What’s left of the plot isn’t up to very much, but Altman makes up for it by populating it with a cast of eccentrics and grotesques (Wright is one of the most repellent characters in any 70s film.) Like all Altman’s work, it’s a film full if busy backgrounds and throwaway one-liners and the soundtrack is notable, featuring songs by John Phillips of the Mamas and the Papas whose production company, Adler-Phillips (formed in partnership with producer Lou Adler) bankrolled the film.\n\nAs well as playing tricks with film, Altman packs Brewster McCloud with many references to other movies – when Daphne Heap is killed, she’s wearing ruby-encrusted slippers in reference to actress Margaret Hamilton’s most famous role as the Wicked Witch of the West in The Wizard of Oz (1939) – it’s one of several references to Victor Fleming’s film; the name of Michael Murphy’s cop foreshadows the better known Shaft first played by Richard Roundtree the following year but his look, right down to the piercing blue eyes achieved by contact lenses, is based on Steve McQueen in Bullitt (1968); there are a couple of references for Fellini and perhaps to Hitchcock – Brewster McCloud is an unruly and wayward distant cousin of The Birds (1963), with the avian population of Houston seemingly carrying out a quiet, covert war on the human race, acting intelligently and with a collective purpose; the first three lines of the cast list is briefly visible on the Astrodome display screens at the end; and Altman manages to slip in a poster for M*A*S*H on an apartment wall.\n\nBrewster McCloud a fast-moving film that’s hard to keep up with the torrent of gags, ideas and characters and Altman stuffs it with a multitude of bird and flight metaphors – everything from the lecturer’s gradual transformation and the mysterious scars on Louise’s shoulder blades to Brewster’s climactic flight around the Astrodome and his owl-like appearance. It was said to have been Altman’s favourite of all his films but it’s more of an interesting film than a particularly good one. The story is too ill-disciplined and slapdash to work effectively but there’s so many incidental pleasures along the way that it’s still a great deal of very silly fun with some fine performances (Cort, Kellerman and Duvall, the latter in her first film role, in particular are great) and, in Houston’s gigantic Astrodome, then still fairly new at only five years old, one of the most striking locations in any 70s American film."
