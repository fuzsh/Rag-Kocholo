        "text": "CHITTENDEN COUNTY SHERIFFS\n\n1787 TO PRESENT\n\n* Noah Chittenden was also the first Sheriff of Addison County from 1785-1787. Although Noah lived in Jericho at the time, Jericho was part of Addison County until October 1787 when Chittenden County was Incorporated. Noah was brother to Thomas Chittenden the first Governor of Vermont.\n\n**Earl McLaughlin was the last Sheriff of Chittenden County to live in the County Jail. Sheriffs in Vermont ran and lived in the County Jails until the Vermont Department of Corrections took over the County Jail function on April 1, 1969. Sheriff McLaughlin lived in the County Jail with his wife Theresa McLaughlin and their 11 Children, 8 of whom have the distinction of saying they were born in a “County Jail.”\n\n***Kevin McLaughlin became Chittenden County’s longest serving Sheriff since 1787 on August 1, 2009 only to surpass his father, Earl McLaughlin who had served for 22 years 6 months before becoming US Marshal for the District of Vermont under the Carter Administration in 1977. Sheriff Kevin McLaughlin is also the longest serving full time officer of the Chittenden County Sheriffs Office. He started his career there on May 1, 1973"
