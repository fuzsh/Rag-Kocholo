        "text": "NICHOLL (NICHOL, NICHOLLS), John, b. 1636 Antrim\n\nJohn NICHOLL arrived in the Province of Maryland, Colonial America about 1665 as an indentured laborer. All branches of his many descendants carry a family tradition that says that he was an Ulster Scot (he definitely was Protestant). On examination of Ulster Muster Rolls compiled in 1630, I noted that there were four John Nicholl families in Antrim: two in Dunluce, and one each in Belfast and Masreyne. John named his five Maryland-born sons Isaac, John, Joseph, Benjamin and Moses, so I would expect to see similar given names among his siblings and forebears. My only other lead is that he was a surveyor, and one of his sons was an estate appraiser; it is likely, then, that my ancestors in Ulster also were involved in realty/estate-related trades. Perhaps the name NICHOLL survives on old property deeds or survey reports? Is there any way to ascertain this via the Internet? McAlonan - Clough and surrounding areas\n\nI'm on a quest to find the parents of my great-great-great grandfather Thomas McAlonan. Thomas was born somewhere in Antrim. (b. 1786, may have been spelled McAlonon or McAloinan on some records). He settled in Ballymena/Clough/Dunaghy/Ballycregagh .Â Thomas McAlonan (b. 1786) married Nancy Blair (b.1789). They are listed as living at 3 Ballycregagh Townland, Dunaghy parish, Co. Antrim in the 1851 Antrim census. Tom and Nancy had son James (b. 1819-20), daughter Margaret (who married a James Boyd). Unclear, but possibly there was a daughter Mary (who married a McCleary) and a son John, b. cir. 1831.Â Our lineage is derived from the above mentioned James. James McAlonan married Margaret. They had six children: Peggy Jane (Margaret or Margret) b. 1845; Elizabeth (Eliza or Lizzie) b. 1847; Thomas b. 1850; Matthew b. 1853; James b. 1853; and William Blair b. 1859. Thomas married a Margaret Patton (they are buried in Clough cemetery); Eliza married a Robert Templeton and had two children, Margaret Jane and Thomas (all are buried in Clough); Matthew moved to Detroit, Michigan, as did Willaim Blair (they came to the US around 1885). William Blair is my great-grandfather. He married Lizzie Caldwell McFetridge (in the US); they had sons William Torrens and Matthew Walter (my grandfather). Matthew Walter, \"Mickey,\" my grandpa, moved to N. Ohio where our leg of the family has remained rooted for all these years. It is said that he changed the surname McAlonan to MacAlonan because mail was getting sent to the wrong McAlonan relatives. We are the only \"Macs\" among our \"Mcs\" -- my dad never changed the name. We have 7 relatives bonrn in old Dunaghy Clough cemetery. 1851 and 1901/1911 census records that show some of our McAlonan's were still living in Clough/ Dunaghy/Ballycregagh. (1851 census, 3 Ballycregagh; 1901 census house, 16 Ballycregagh; 1911 census, 10 Ballycregagh.) The 1803 Ulster partial Agricultural census shows McAlonan's and McAlonon's in Dunlucy Upper/Loughguile, but I don't see Clough/Dunaghy and can't make a connection. I'm also hoping that the Blair, Boyd, Patton, Templeton and McLeary related surnames might aid us in tracing our history.Â mary b kelso\n\nMary B KELSO is my greatgrandmother. my grandmother, Henrietta, was born in 1900 and traveled with her brother William and sister Jenny around 1909 to the US. I can't find any records of them in Ellis Island.....Henrietta ended up in San Francisco, CA.. I am looking for anyone related....my mom has passed and i never met my grandmother. they are on the 1901 census and lived at house 6 Craigarogan Road ....in or near Belfast not on 1911 census. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks Robin Sarah Grindle/Grendle and John/James Davidson\n\nSarah and John/James both born 1825 were also both born in Ballymony. I have John/James baptism record. I have Sarah's death record. They married in approx 1844, and emigrated to Canada in 1845, their oldest son Robert was born on board ship in the mid-Atlantic in June 1845. The surname Grendle does not appear anywhere in Antrim records. Names on gravestones in Canada say Grendle, many official records say Grindle, and some of her descendants have Grindle as a second name . Baptism records for John/James list his parents as Alexander Davidson and Jane. If anyone has any information about these families please contact me. Ashe/ Ferguson families from Antrim\n\nHi am still trying to trace my Great Grandparent's families from Antrim? My Great Grandfather was Samuel Ashe ( may also have been known as Leonard?) He Married Mary Ferguson from New Park Antrim in 1900 in Antrim church. Both were added as full age on the wedding certificate so not sure about they're age or dates of birth? Mary's father was James Ferguson who was a shoe maker, and Samuel's father was also called Samuel they were from Island Lodge Muckermore I believe his wife was Agnes? on the marriage certificate the witnesses were James and Sarah Ellen Ashe but I'm not sure about the relationship to Samuel? I would be greatful for any information about either families thanks. Laurine Mary Jane ORR & John MARSHALL\n\nMary Jane ORR and John MARSHALL were my gg-grandparents. I believe they were BOTH born around 1832 in Co.Antrim, N.I. I have found record of their marriage in 1852 in Antrim. They had a brood of kids (William b.1855, MARGARET b.1858, John b.1862, Mary Jane b.1864, Harriet b.1866 and Maria b.1869) who were all born in Antrim. MARGARET was my g-grandmother; she married a Joseph TAYLOR in Failsworth, in 1880. All EIGHT Marshall-Orr family members left Antrim (in the 1870's?) and landed in the Failsworth area of Oldham, near Manchester, England, where they worked in the cotton mills. I have a good understanding of MOST of the family from here on - found in a letter written by Lawrence Taylor, a son of Margaret's, and uncle to me. I am looking for any information that might lead to knowing if John Marshall or Mary Jane Orr had brothers or sisters, and who were their parents? Records for Ireland are tough to discover. Did their Marshall or Orr parents move too? Perhaps some brothers or sisters of John or Mary Jane moved to England? Perhaps some moved to other parts of the UK, or Canada or USA, or other places? Any assistance is greatly appreciated. David Wilson\n\nLooking for information on David Wilson born about 1806 Antrim (sorry can't be more specific). He probably joined the Liverpool Police Force at/shortly after it was created in 1836. By 1841 he was a bridewell keeper at Jordan St, and rose to become a superintendent. Died 1875 in West Derby, Lancashire. Married Mary Taylor, (1814 County Down - abt 1876, probably Liverpool/West Derby). Daughter Ann born c1832 Dublin, so assume marriage took place about 1830-31, probably in Dublin (can't find a record). Children Ann 1832, Jane 1836, Mary 1838, Isabella 1841, Samuel McMaster 1843, Grace 1849, David 1853. All except Ann born in Liverpool. Would appreciate any information on his life in Ireland. Thanks. Israel Ireland and Alice Ireland\n\nIsrael and Alice Ireland arrived in New Brunswick in 1825. They were born in 1801-03 and listed Antrim Co. as \"home\". They may have been married that year also, either in Belfast, or Antrim Co. area. Areas of interest possibly: Templepatrick, Tullyrusk, Belfast, to start. This would be for family history and insight. We do not know Alice's maiden name, but know she was the eldest daughter of two, both girls. We also know very little of Israel, only how life unfolded here in Canada. Would love any info.. passenger ships leaving Belfast in 1825, what archives available, or family connections... thanks! Maggie Hopkins & Williamson\n\nI am looking for information on my G,G,G, Grandparents. Thomas Alexander Hopkins was born in Co. Antrim on 15/12/1795. He married another native of Antrim, Elizabeth Williamson who was born on 13/08/1799. I do not know when they emigrated to Australia but it was some time before 1837 because their first child, John, was born in Australia in that year. I would be very grateful for any information about them. Thank you. alexander Fitzgerald `irvine\n\nI am tracing the history of Alexander F Irvine, Author and preacher, from Antrim Northern Ireland.

James went on to marry a Mary Burns in 1854 in Workington Cockermouth. I would like to find out the families movements pre 1841. Thanks John IRVINE - BEGGS Families\n\nAndrew Irvine and his wife, Agnes Beggs, were both christened in 1820, Ballynashee Townland, Co Antrim. They were married in 1839, Co Antrim and their oldest child, Mary Ellen, was born 1841. Sometime after this they came to Canada and settled in Ontario. Siblings of Andrew that we know about are David, born 1823 and Mary Ann born 1826. David married Sarah Beggs and Mary Ann married James Cowan. The three couples are found in Ontario, Canada in the 1851 Census. According to the christening record for Andrew, Timothy Irvine is listed as the father, however no mother's name is mentioned. Since Timothy is an unfamiliar first name in this family line, we wonder if we have the correct Andrew. Our objective is to learn the correct parents for Andrew, David & Mary Ann. Any suggestions or directions anyone would care to offer would be greatly appreciated. Thanks Irwin\n\nI've read quite a few entries on the Irwin family and was wondering if anyone knew of a William Thomas Or Thomas William born in Ireland between 1902 and 1905,he was sent to Canada as a young baby or child with or without his parents.We believe his mother's name was Mary Compton and don't know anything about his father.If anyone has anything at all it will be a start,thank you for your time CUNNINGHAM\n\nI am researching JOHN CUNNINGHAM b.abt. 1808 who had a daughter Ellen Cunningham born 1832 Belfast, Antrim, Ireland.Probably christened at St. Annes in Belfast.

They married at St. Marys Church, Gateshead, Durham, Northumberland, England.Witnesses at Ellen's wedding were William & Margaret Cunningham. Were they her siblings or her brother and his wife? Did John go to Durham or did he emigrate to Richmond Australia as I have info pointing both ways!!! Any help much appreciated. Falconbridge - Glenholme\n\nA William Falconbridge married a \"Miss Kennedy\" in Antrim in 1776, Christian name unknown. Possibly their son, also William Falconbridge married Mary Glenholme in Antrim. Their eldest son John Kennedy Falconbridge was born in Coleraine in 1819 and migrated to Canada where he father Sir William Glenholme Falconbridge Kings court Judge. A number of members of this family went to Ontario and later William and Mary's youngest son Alexander migrated to Australia in 1880 with his wife Catherine and 6 children. William and Mary both died in Donegal where William was a customs excise officer for many years. Family members were in Bridgnorth Shropshire and Prestonpans Scotland and were connected with the vitriol industry - the bleaching of linen, and in Ireland were also connected with the non conformist church in Bridgnorth - Stoneway Chapel. There was also a connection with Bristol and dr Alexander Falconbridge. Any information about this family greatly received. John Kelly and Frances Finlay\n\nJohn and Frances were my great great grandparents. They married somewhere in Antrim, I believe Killyglen, around 1843. They had 4 sons, George (1844-), Robert (1847-), John (1849-1894) my great grandfather who first emigrated to Scotland, married Elizabeth Mitchell and they had 4 or 5 children before they emigrated to NSW Australia and had 4 or 5 more, and James (1851-). Frances Kelly was mentioned in the 1851 census, living at her mother's house in Killyglen with her 4 sons and her job is listed as seamstress. There is no mention at the time of John. She is listed as married and therefore not a widow. According to the LDS family site there is also mention of a John and Frances Kelly living in Carrickfergus. Hagen/O'Hagen\n\nLooking for information on the Hagen/O'Hagen family. We have information that they lived in Cerrickfergus in the early 1800's. We believe they lived on Davys street, and that one on the children, a girl worked at the YMCA. Some on the family immigrated to Canada around the middle of the 1800's. The fathers name was Samuel of Charles. We are not sure which one he went by. They settled in Ontario before heading to Alberta in the late 1800's. Any information would be greatly appreciated William John Campbell\n\nWilliam John and his brother Robert immigrated to Canada in the early to mid 1800s. The story is they sent money back to Ireland for their parents and siblings, who all got on the ship but it never arrived in Canada. William settled in Fitzroy Habour, on. and Robert across the ottawa river QC. The only record i can find about where they were born was County Antrim. I am trying to find if there is any of their family left in Ireland. Allens in NI\n\nHi,am looking for any info on George Allen,born 1876/1877 in Co.Antrim,Belfast,father Ezekiel Allen,bricklayer. Possibly born 29/06/1876 to Ezekiel Allen & Mary Jane Moore at 6,Eton Rd,Antrim.George became a male nurse,moving to Middlesex & marrying in 1904.I am looking for any info about this family.Think I have traced Ezekiel in 1911 Irish census,now married to a Jane,so maybe he re-married & had a second family or maybe it's the wrong Ezekiel.In 1911 his age is recorded as 59 & his occupation as an unemployed bricklayer,born Co.Antrim but can find no appropriate DOB for Ezekiel on any Irish websites. Have found a marriage,via IGI, for Ezekiel Allen to Mary Jane Moore in 1874 & traced some of their children (but not George)& then another marriage to Jane Mahood in 1884 but is it the same Ezekiel?. How many bricklaying Ezekiel Allens of about the correct age ,born in Antrim is there likely to be? Any help/advise gratefully received. Regards Coreen McGonnell Family\n\nHi I am searching for information about the McGonnell family who came from Antrim. Alexander McGonnell was born in 1796 and became a coast guard, moving to the Kent area of England. I think his father was a John McGonnell.Alexander married a Mary Richardson who may also have come from Antrim. The family moved to Hythe in Kent and the sons, Nicholas, John and Alexander all joined the Navy. Any information would be much appreciated. McConcie-Neil\n\nI have come to a deadend trying to find out more information about Isabella McConcie, who was born in Antrim, Ireland in 1835 and died in NSW, Australia in 1904. In 1853 she married William Neil, who was born in Downshire, Ireland in 1829. For some reason the marriage took place in Dalry, Ary, Scotland. The couple migrated to Australia shortly thereafter. I have quite a lot of information about the Searle line in Australia (which I am happy to share), and would be very grateful indeed for any information on Isabella or William."
