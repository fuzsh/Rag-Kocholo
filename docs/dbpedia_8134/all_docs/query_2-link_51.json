        "text": "James Kivetoruk Moses was born in 1903 in Cape Espenberg, Alaska. He spent the first half of his life as a subsistence hunter, but after a debilitating airplane crash in 1953 left him unable to continue hunting, Kivetoruk Moses embarked on a second life as an artist. By this point, there was a relatively consistent market for Native Alaskan art through the comings and goings of tourists and travelers to this far northeastern region.\n\nKivetoruk Moses drafted incredibly detailed images of life in the region (both real and imagined). Collectors and early scholars often praised Kivetoruk Moses for the anthropological accuracy of his works. From his depictions of subsistence hunting and fishing to clothing, regalia, tattoos, ceremonies, and dances, Kivetoruk Moses was praised for creating “authentic” depictions of lifeways under threat or already gone.\n\nThese interpretations must be questioned. While Kivetoruk Moses created images of incredible detail, the scenes were often more amalgamation, or even imaginings rather than snapshots—nor are these lifeways gone today. They continue the path of survivance that Kivetoruk Moses himself traveled some sixty years ago. His images both capture and transcend the power of the photograph in translating the past into the present. Through his scenes of ice tundras, animals, Siberian and Inupiat individuals, hunting, dancing, engaging in challenges and feats, and instructive stories of mythical and powerful beings, Kivetoruk Moses envisioned a world that, in many ways, he longed for after his debilitating injuries.\n\nBut what does an Indigenous person see in Kivetoruk Moses’s work? The contributors in this exhibition come from Inupiaq, Alutiiq, and Ahtna cultures across Alaska. While this collection currently lives in New Mexico, it is essential to gain the perspective of Indigenous people from the place in which Kivetoruk Moses created—the Arctic. Moses’s work tells a certain narrative of Inupiaq life to the western anthropologist and art historian. It is a narrative that is often reduced to a glimpse of Indigenous life as “it was”. To Indigenous people, who share history, memory, and knowledge of life in the Arctic, Kivetoruk’s narrative is one of fantasy and vision. His work was storytelling; storytelling of Indigenous subsistence and ways of life as well as a foreshadowing of the lasting effects of western contact. This perspective of the contributors in this exhibit is one that has not been shared in the context of critique or interpretation of Moses’s work. And it is one that is critical for a deeper and truer understanding of Moses’s world.\n\nConversations of Ourselves: An Indigenous survey of James Kivetoruk Moses is a modern-day story circle with Kivetoruk Moses as its point of origin. The collaborative dialogue that took place across the digital realm in the creation of this project does the crucial work of approaching the place, meaning, and ongoing significance of these incredible images from within.\n\nThe James Kivetoruk Moses pieces included in Conversations of Ourselves have been generously loaned to the Coe Center from a private collector. This project is supported in part by a National Endowment for Arts Art Works grant and is one of 1015 grants nationwide, and one of twelve in the state of New Mexico."
