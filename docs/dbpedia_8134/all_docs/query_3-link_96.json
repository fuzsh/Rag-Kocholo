        "text": "The Most Stability I've had in Years\n\nAlexander A. Manzoni\n\nThis morning, I woke up. And it finally set in.\n\nThe time is drawing closer.\n\nSoon, we will be moving.\n\nThe old house— the one looming\n\nover the historic neighborhood of Browne’s Addition, Spokane.\n\n‘Tis not ours. T’was not ours. It will ne’erbe ours.\n\nAnd that is a problem.\n\nWe need to possess that which is our own.\n\nSo that we may spread our wings and fly wherever we are so destined.\n\nWe are mere millenials, older than some, younger than the rest.\n\nWe have test’d ourselves, up here. In the mid-winter chill, in the mid-summer smoke.\n\nWe have brav’d the gauntlet— the thousand swung scimitars as they came for our throats.\n\nThankfully, they miss’d.\n\nThankfully, many lessons were learned within the confines of this old building.\n\nThankfully, no fires from the aging outdated electric system (must’ve been from when\n\nEdison was still alive, kicking, and stealing other people’s inventions to repurpose as his own).\n\nIf you didn’t know, then you do, now— they say at the local Broken Mic poetry\n\nreadings: “Thomas Edison is A WITCH!”\n\nWe must not run from our collective destinies.\n\nI wish we could stay and make it ours.\n\nBut we can’t. Instead, we are moving ahead, on a new venture.\n\nNew opportunities. New problems.\n\nNew adventures. New us.\n\nI will miss you, 428 South Hemlock, Unit F.\n\nYou have been good to me, to us, to my spirits,\n\nmy writing, my everything.\n\nAlexander Antonio Manzoni has been writing poetry for over twenty years. In September 2014, he moved to Spokane, Washington, from Newfield, New Jersey. He has lived in Browne’s Addition which inspired his poem above, but currently resides in Audubon/Downriver. His poetry and short stories been published in several online magazines & websites, and in print: “Washington State’s Best Emerging Poets 2019” and “Spokane Writes: A Poetry & Prose Anthology.” He is the host of the “Manzoni in the Morning” poetry podcast.\n\nOde to Browne's Addition Front Porch People\n\nJulie Olsen\n\nMiss Marple was her real name, my neighbor across the street.\n\nNo hobbies, the kids didn’t visit, boredom was her problem.\n\nShe sat on her front porch all day long, watched life go by.\n\nReported on the gossip,\n\nReported on the neighbors,\n\nReported on the kids and car prowlers –I think she missed her calling.\n\nIf not for fate, she could’ve been a confidential informant or a spy.\n\nDark in the early morning, a cold fog persists.\n\nOn a secluded front porch alcove, a man usually sits.\n\nCoffee, a cigarette. I smelled it in the air.\n\nMaybe a “Hello.”\n\nMaybe a “Good morning.”\n\nMaybe just a stare.\n\nAfternoon heat, looking for shade, rocking chairs on the porch,\n\nNot waiting for dates, two woke women debate.\n\nWondering why that idea/plan/recipe might fail.\n\nTalking about nothing.\n\nTalking about strife.\n\nTalking about the Rosauer’s next big 24 hour sale.\n\nMentally scroll through the options: Bijou, Browne’s, the Elk\n\nMaybe the back patio of Pacific Pizza where local hipsters hang out.\n\nNo, tonight I’ll chill on my own front porch.\n\nCome over, I’ve got extra seating – vintage green and white.\n\nExchange waveswith the parade of unwed mothers pushing 2nd hand strollers – nary a man in sight.\n\nExchange real estate prices with Darren.\n\nExchange eye rolls with Danette.\n\n(She’s a Trumper and anti-masker, but I don’t worry, she’s leaving the neighborhood soon.)\n\nHello neighbor! If your front porch is vacant, lonely or foreboding,\n\nDon’t let the silence overwhelm.\n\nCome outside! Join us, in this mosaic we’ve become.\n\nJulie Olsen is a historic home renovator, dog walker, hiker, litter picker-upper, ArtFest attending, Elkfest grieving, Browne’s Addiction t-shirt wearing 20+ year resident of Browne’s Addition.\n\nLyfe in Spokane\n\nBethany Montgomery\n\nSpokane, Spoken – eyes wide open\n\nto infinite possibilities constantly fueling my dreams with the endless amounts of scenes\n\nWhether climbing up the trees or running around downtown in a jungle of concrete\n\nHikes at Bowl and Pitcher to embrace the bigger picture\n\nWhen looking into the Spokane river the experience is as metaphorical\n\nas when I look at myself in the mirror\n\nSometimes I feel as though I’m a fish swimming against the current\n\nfighting oppression, discrimination, and preconceived judgements\n\nBeing told that Spokane is not a good place to start a poetry movement\n\nBut for me Spokane has become a solution\n\nSee I choose to tap in into the potential of Spokane\n\nmany think Spo-can’t but I know Spo-can\n\nThere is opportunity in this community and we all have the chance to be major influences\n\nYes, we will be met with opposition which will not stop our progression I am here to instill culture, diversity and inclusion Power 2 The Poetry it is more than a movement\n\nIt is a way to prove that Spokane is different that in Spokane you can still be\n\nrespected even if you have a difference of opinion\n\nIn Spokane you won’t be discriminated against because of the color of your skin\n\nthat in Spokane it is ok to be openly lesbian\n\nPeople don’t worry about pedigree and instead focus on equality\n\nThat in Spokane I can unapologetically be me in Spokane WE can all be who we want be\n\nBut you see this Spokane is not yet a real thing\n\nThis Spokane is still a dream just like our Zags winning the whole thing and finally bringing\n\na NCAA basketball championship to the city because – GO EAGS\n\nBut I do believe dreams come true so if you truly support what I say\n\nthen you too must realize YOU are the key to Spokane’s breakthrough\n\nWe all deserve to live our best lives and freely live out our truths\n\nCome on Spokane it’s time for change we don’t have much to lose but so much more to prove\n\nThe change starts with you so please Spokane\n\nBE THE BREAKTHROUGH\n\nBethany ‘B.Lyte’ Montgomery is the founder and President of Power 2 The Poetry.

Above her, Pavilion grand\n\nGlows Expo’s welcome; beseeching eyes demand\n\nA basalt safe harbor that twin plateaus frame.\n\n“Gone! Sacred home, land barons’ pomp,” cries Chief\n\nHologram tears. New droves of tired and poor\n\nLoggers with leathered hands, laboring for relief,\n\nRailway ghosts by the Tower haunt no more\n\nBuilt up by the fervent faithfuls’ belief\n\nA new colossus to be envied ever more.\n\nGrace Leaf was seven when Expo ‘74 took place, and it was her first memory of Spokane. She remembers standing frozen, watching a statue of Chief Joe, with a projected image of him crying as he talked about his people and their losses. Since then Riverfront Park has become a setting for more pleasant memories.\n\nThis poem’s structure mirrors Emma Lazarus’ poem, “The New Colossus,” about Lady Liberty being the symbol of hope and welcome to immigrants entering America on the East Coast. Grace views the Pavilion in much the same way, paying tribute to the land on which it stands, as well as reflecting on her journey from a traumatized Korean adoptee to a champion of Spokane and the park as a gateway to fun, a centering place worthy of reverence and celebration.\n\nKiss Me in Front of the Garbage Goat\n\nMatthew Weaver\n\nFill your pockets with scraps of paper\n\nOld notes and grocery receipts used as bookmarks\n\nand meet me in front of the garbage goat\n\nand let’s have our first kiss\n\nEveryone’s first kiss should be in front of the garbage goat\n\nAs we approach, anxious and excited\n\nHoping against hope the vacuum is sucking today\n\nBecause some days it’s not, and if you are going to\n\nhave your first kiss in front of the garbage goat\n\nit needs to be sucking\n\nThey say to write what you know and what I know is yearning for you\n\nI have gotten my hopes up too many times for people who I hoped were you\n\nOnly they turned out to be somebody else\n\nPlease meet me in front of the garbage goat\n\nAnd end the mystery\n\nEveryone should have their first kiss in front of the garbage goat\n\nSister Paula Mary Turnbull didn’t know that was its purpose when she forged it, but now you do\n\nSo, quick! Meet me at the garbage goat\n\nKiss me in front of the garbage goat\n\nI am so tired, tired, tired of being alone\n\nSorry. I’ll be fine.\n\nIt’s just a moment. It will pass.\n\nOK. There. It passed.\n\nI can do it. I can wait a little bit longer.\n\nBut please.Meet me there soon.\n\nAnd please, please, please.\n\nLet the goat be sucking that day.\n\nMatthew Weaver is a Spokane playwright, screenwriter and poet.\n\nEast Central\n\nGinger Grey\n\nIf you saw my kid reading to the backyard pig on Madelia,\n\nyou’d get it. The coffee at The Shop is legendarily\n\nslow, but it’s our coffee, and Perry is our street.\n\nThe Hico Mart isn’t going to have that ingredient\n\nyou need, but they have candy and wine,\n\nwhich will do in a pinch. Yesterday:\n\na single, giant snowball appeared triumphantly\n\nin the middle of Grant Park.\n\nThis isn’t Kendall Yards,\n\nbut that’s kind of the point.\n\nTake the scar on my left leg,\n\nwhere a dog ripped into me on Twelfth.\n\nHe’d strained against his tree-anchored chain\n\neach time I passed by, which I did, all the time,\n\nbecause I was afraid and didn’t want to be.\n\nBut above that scar I have quadriceps built\n\nfrom circling this neighborhood.\n\nAnd so I see you, woman with the little white Bichon,\n\ncommitted to your route by the community garden.\n\nI see you, mothers at the top of the sledding hill,\n\npanicked as your kids speed toward Ninth.\n\nI see you Justin, Deb, Susan. Ben-Burr-\n\nrunners, temple-goers, craft-beer drinkers.\n\nWe’re not South Hillers, not really. Here,\n\nsometimes the dog is off the leash, and waiting,\n\nand mean. But an East Centraler knows fear is a lousy leader,\n\nand stubbornness can be a kind of courage,\n\nand courage can be a way of life.\n\nAnd the coffee you wait for—\n\nit just tastes better.\n\nGinger Grey is a counselor in Spokane, WA, and also a writer of things.\n\nWalking in the Perry District\n\nTeresa Vanairsdale\n\nI walk this journey again, memorizing\n\neach house, the man upstairs, like God himself\n\nin his home office working, staring at his computer.\n\nI wonder what work he does – engineering,\n\nhealth care, there is a “We Support Dr. Lutz”\n\nsign in his yard, is it law he studies, or does he teach?\n\nI wonder when I walk about the man upstairs.\n\nI wonder if he observes my steady gaze\n\non him at his desk from the sidewalk\n\nacross 16th Street. I would love to see him\n\nsuddenly burst through the front door as I pass by.\n\nI would say hi.\n\nFurther down, the gray pony-tailed, skeletal woman\n\non 16th decorates her front porch with 1950’s\n\nlarge, plastic Christmas ornaments,\n\nlike those my family Christmas tree\n\nwore when I was growing up.\n\nThe sixty-something woman on the corner\n\nrakes her front lawn for the third time\n\nwhich is again covered with oak leaves.\n\nFinally I reach the dead end sign, signaling\n\nmy halfway point, feeling content\n\nwith my ruminations as I cover distance\n\nphysically and philosophically,\n\nboth of which are strenuous for me.\n\nMost days a circular logic informs\n\nmy thoughts, but sometimes\n\nI get a sense that my efforts are not\n\nas mundane as they seem as I approach\n\nthe dead end in the neighborhood of my life.\n\nTeresa Vanairsdale was born and raised in Newport, Washington and has been a grateful citizen of the Pacific Northwest and all its outdoor activities for most of her life. She finished EWU’s MFA in poetry in June of 2020.\n\nNorth Rockwood Four-Wheel Drive\n\nMichael H. Ebinger\n\nFrom Merced, CA, to Spokane and now in North Rockwood, but I like my new home.\n\nThey walk me a couple of times a day.\n\nAnd I don’t make it easy for them:\n\nI pull hard on that leash, and even pulled the man over on the ice once.\n\nMy favorite walk is past the castles on Pinecrest.\n\nMy people have a good house, but those castles are special.\n\nExcept at the end of October when the spooky things sit out front and make noise. Those noises scare me.\n\nWe have some woods, at least between houses,\n\nAnd a big grass lawn that fills with people on Sundays.\n\nAnd the turkeys—I chase them in my yard.\n\nSquirrels—I don’t let them stay on my deck. But they are fun to run after.\n\nThere is the brown UPS truck that stops sometimes, the driver\n\nIs really friendly and always wants to pet me, but I’m too rambunctious.\n\nFedEx makes a lot of noise and usually brings the big boxes, but I don’t get to say hello.\n\nNorth Rockwood has more types like me than\n\nI remember at the puppy mill.\n\nOne of my favorites is the Border Collie next door—I get to visit in his yard\n\nBut he can’t come see me because of Mr. Invisible Fence.\n\nOne of my people calls me Four-Wheel Drive. I don’t know why that is,\n\nProbably because I don’t slip or fall and can go anywhere.\n\nThe man had trouble the other night going over the snow bank,\n\nBut I just grabbed with all four and pulled through.\n\nI wish I could shed my leash and just run through the ‘hood,\n\nBut then I wouldn’t get to show off my four-wheel drive as much.\n\nMy humans are just jealous.\n\nThey may have more elevation than my 8 inches of clearance,\n\nBut I get the benefit of four-wheels pulling me around North Rockwood.\n\nEbinger retired from WSU Health Sciences Campus in 2020 and is enjoying walks with his dog, Salsa, and other activities that were not compatible with an 8-5 job. Spokane is a second home that he will probably not leave, or at least leave any time soon.\n\nRockwood\n\nWendy Levy\n\nIn Spokane, my stripper name is Muffin Syringa\n\nMy first pet, plus the name of my street, the street I live on\n\nNow but where I am still, four years later, waking up\n\na stranger.\n\nThis brick house on south syringa, tucked into pine trees on cardio hill, where\n\nwomen with strollers and blue tights and coats and dogs brave the snow and\n\nboldly roll up the street.\n\nAnd we wave from the window\n\nin the silence\n\nof the distance we take to stay alive.\n\nIn the spring and summer it was easier\n\nTo connect with the women and their strollers\n\nWe were outside tending the garden then,\n\nthe cilantro and the parsley, the tomatoes, the zucchini and peppers, the chocolate mint.\n\nHellos were easier. Please have some zucchini. Small talk\n\nwas easier, I wanted to ask\n\nhow long have you been here, what are your children up to, I have no children, let’s sit on the\n\nporch, have a glass of wine, six feet away, what does your husband do, I have no husband but\n\nmy wife is in the garden\n\njoyfully feeding the red breasted nuthatches.\n\nWhat is your stripper name? My stripper name is Muffin Syringa.\n\nAnd I feel stripped of my dignity\n\nThe temple nearby has been defaced and defamed\n\nA swastika, not the first placed here on a building meant for love\n\nI walk through Rockwood, stripped of my sense of wonder,\n\nAnd I wonder how all this beauty will survive\n\nThe long winter.\n\nWendy Levy is a filmmaker, producer, arts curator, and the Executive Director of The Alliance for Media Arts + Culture.\n\nOur 1910 House's 100th Birthday Party\n\nElaine Stevens\n\nThe house insists on a house party inviting of all former ownersfrom 1910 to 2010!\n\n1910, the land a pine forest surrounded by Manito Park\n\nencouraging housing developments around the park.\n\nGuest list researched in libraries, Court House, City Hall.\n\nThe former owners, 100 years’ accumulation of footsteps,\n\nvoices, tears, laughter, heartbreak, joy and so many stories,\n\nwallpaper designs, clothing styles, inventions, 18 presidents\n\nfrom William Howard Taft to Barack Obama.\n\nEach former resident entering the double door entry way,\n\nturning familiar antique embellished doorknobs, over the years\n\nour finger prints meeting the previous owners’ hands on them.\n\nWe gather under the same beamed-ceilings that no one\n\npainted pink or purple in the nineteen sixties,\n\nby the large fireplace with green tile, admire the built-in-hutch\n\nwith lights and leaded glass doors, the plate rail.\n\nLook out the same windows with old imperfect wavy glass\n\nnow rare, note the starburst window panes.\n\nFirst owners amazed houses now fill each block,\n\nObserve pine trees have grown extremely tall.\n\nRecall the pride for our 1920 Hutton Elementary School,\n\nthe only Spanish style school in the city,\n\nand getting confused by numbered streets renamed\n\nwhere the houses are bigger.\n\nWe express gratitude to the house for being our home,\n\nand all agree that tree lined streets and\n\nManito Park’s beauty form the soul of its neighborhood.\n\nElaine Stevens is a 51 year resident of her neighborhood, whoe mother learned to speak English memorizing poems at school. Her love of poetry is Elaine’s, too. Elaine grew up in Northern California and moved to Spokane in 1959. She retired 24 years ago from Spokane School District # 81 and taught at a number of Spokane schools, including Hutton School in her own neighborhood.\n\nNatatorium Park\n\nCatherine Grainger\n\nIt was the last stop on the street car line,\n\nthis place where dreams came true.\n\nFlowered bowers, cotton candy kisses and the carousel’s golden ring\n\nwere all up for grabs.\n\nSam grabbed them all one night, that glorious night he met Thelma.\n\nShe jumped off the street car and into his smile.\n\nThey danced to the beat of the big band,\n\nrode the rackety packety Jack Rabbit,\n\nshot a loop on the Shoot de Chute\n\nand took the plunge near The Plunge.\n\nShe wore Evening in Paris,\n\nbut no night in France could match the romance of that night\n\nin Natatorium Park.\n\nIt was a giddy whirl and its centrifuge\n\nheld Thelma in his arms for fifty years.\n\nThe park is gone now, burned to the ground,\n\nand Thelma lies in the ground across the river.\n\nSam lives in San Souci, his single wide perched among the trees.\n\nFrom there, he still traces the pathways he strolled with Thelma by the river.\n\nHe can still hear the sound of laughter caught in an evening breeze,\n\nA reminder of that Evening in Paris\n\nthat happened in Spokane.\n\nCatherine Grainger is a poet and artist who loves her historic West Central neighborhood. She can be found walking along the Centennial Trail or in the garden of her craftsman bungalow.\n\nWest Central\n\nJake Miller\n\nIn 1905 old William Nettleton\n\nFell to his death from the Great Northern high bridge,\n\nLeaving behind the West Central neighborhood,\n\nThathe and other pioneers had platted.\n\nWilliam left behind a neighborhood in its Golden Age\n\nOf gracious homes from pattern plans on smallish lots,\n\nA neighborhood of grand brick churches and schools,\n\nAnd solid short commercial buildings and retail stores and the latest in hospitals.\n\nAn exquisite new courthouse and a college.\n\nA streetcar suburb connected to downtown.\n\nA self–contained neighborhood where immigrants and settlers lived and shopped\n\nAnd went to parks and listened to music and each other.\n\nA neighborhood of opportunity.\n\nA neighborhood where every view was gracious,\n\nWrapped by the river, where natives were still to be seen.\n\nWith a railroad yard that connected Spokaneto the rest of the nation,\n\nA neighborhood in abustling and rising city.\n\nThe Golden Age left soon after William Nettleton\n\nAnd the neighborhood began to shown signs of wear.\n\nOf the kind that always comes to works of man.\n\nBut if youlisten you can hear the heart beating\n\nAnd if you look you can see the bones showing\n\nAnd if you pause you can sense the people yearning\n\nFor the old neighborhood that William Nettleton left behind in 1905.\n\nThepeople and the neighborhood are still there waiting\n\nFor another Golden Age.\n\nJake Miller is retired.\n\nIn West Central\n\nJohn M. Browning\n\nThey say people creep all night on Broadway\n\nThey say Bongs is buzzing all night on Boone\n\nBut then you wander down the street\n\nWithout a dollar all tired and beat\n\nLong hours, low pay is the treat (in West Central).\n\nThey say she couldn’t last that long on Broadway\n\nThey say the neighborhood is far too cruel\n\nShe may be humble but she’s got pride\n\nCharges to work with a confident stride\n\nMake sure her babies have a guide (in West Central).\n\nThe playing children scorch their soles on Maxwell\n\nThe pavement’s so hot it will melt their soul\n\nThey are racing down to the pool\n\nThe hood is hot but the pool is cool\n\nHanging out, they’re no fools (in West Central).\n\nA teenager rolls down the road on Gardner\n\nTwenty miles an hours on wheels of steel\n\nHe hits a crack and he goes down\n\nHis skateboard spins round and round\n\nHe gets back riding, an ache in his crown (in West Central).\n\nThey say there is gold on Summit Boulevard\n\nWhere castles sleep beside the sky\n\nA hooded man mines through the trash\n\nLooking for treasure, something to sell for cash,\n\nSomething to add to his stash (in West Central).\n\nThey say they play chicken trapped on Gardner\n\nNarrow houses on a narrower street\n\nA man halted in his Escalade\n\nBy a rusty cobalt unafraid\n\nscreaming she honks her horn and he just stays (in West Central ).\n\nThe buck is hiking down the road on Broadway\n\nFour points bowed he eats the flowers in the yard\n\nDon’t worry he won’t bite\n\nWon’t even put up a fight\n\nJust munch on your garden all the night (in West Central).\n\nJohn M. Browning is a teacher and writer who has lived in Spokane for the last 36 years. He and his wife moved into their little house in West Central 15 years ago. They live there with two cats. John writes poetry, makes doodles, and jokes around with friends as much as he can.\n\n8 years\n\nVan Parsons\n\nFor my first year, I refused to step off the sidewalk.\n\nAll I could do was simply gawk.\n\nI had never had a home,\n\nThis entire world was an unknown.\n\nFor my second year, I thought I had seen the worst of it.\n\nI was entirely immersed, my roots rotted and this place was now the most traversed.\n\nI knew it better than my decrepit woods,\n\nThis much, I understood.\n\nFor my third year, I had become like the cracks in the asphalt.\n\nAs I continued to flourish, I knew many of my neighbors had grown ‘das alte‘.\n\nI had learned that in a lesson at a local public school.\n\nSeeing as that’s all I retained, I feel a bit uncool.\n\nFor my fourth year, I graduated and continued to study.\n\nMy family never had much money,\n\nBut despite this, I was the first and only one of us to continue.\n\nThis was long past due.\n\nFor my fifth year, I was nearly done with my first degree.\n\nBut this time, I can guarantee.\n\nThat the ‘ me ‘ from my second year, and the ‘ me ‘ now would disagree.\n\nI thought I knew this city.\n\nFor my sixth year, I paid close attention to those around me.\n\nI was entranced of how the world seemingly changed around me, a devotee to the community.\n\nHow children I passed on my path, were now adults carving their way.\n\nThis had left me with little to say.\n\nFor my seventh year, I packed away my belongings.\n\nAnd in my chest felt this deep longing.\n\nI missed the sounds of my youth,\n\nThe sounds of children laughing, my parents talking.\n\nI then felt the stalling truth.\n\nIn my eighth year, I had missed what I never paid heed to.\n\nThe beauty and grace in my surroundings, things I hid from view.\n\nThrough the good and bad, West Central was home to pioneers.\n\nI, and my peers who had been here over the years are living souvenirs.\n\nGifts, and treasures of this unconquered and oldest frontier.\n\nA graduate from SFCC’s acclaimed art program (Associates in Art), Van Parsons challenges modern ideas with their work. Hailing from the Pacific Northwest, Van often takes ideas from the culture of the city. Emphasizing people’s needs over anything else, their work also highlights the little things we all miss every passing day.\n\nCrossing Bridge Street\n\nKaty Shedlock\n\nI cross Bridge Street with ease, pass through\n\nthe invisible one-way turnstile like it is a birthright,\n\nand it is – don’t you know all those townhomes\n\nare full of baby boomers from the south hill, where I was born?\n\nI cross Bridge Street like a wizard getting on platform nine\n\nand three quarters. I cross Bridge Street and disappear\n\nbehind the one-way glass into the land of beautiful people\n\nplaying volleyball on the lush lawn, a live commercial\n\nadvertising leisure that no one in West Central can afford.\n\nI cross Bridge street almost daily. I like the views from the trail.\n\nKendall Yards is like my fat pants. I wish it weren’t so comfortable, but it is.\n\nI cross Bridge street back the other way, like taking a deep breath\n\nbefore jumping into the deep end. When we moved in,\n\nthe house behind us had a broken front window\n\nand a blanket to cover the hole with that famous Japanese print\n\nof the little boat and the enormous wave curling over it.\n\nEvery time I turned the corner to come home\n\nI’d lock eyes with the wave and wonder\n\nif this neighborhood would swamp us with sorrow,\n\nor if we are the tsunami of gentrification.\n\nI eat dinner on Wednesday nights at the church across the street from my house.\n\nThe volunteers ask for prayers. Mine are lofty and generalized,\n\ndrawn from the headlines, wispy and meaningless as clouds on a nice day.\n\nEveryone else’s are dire and specific, flash floods of need and grief.\n\nAnd I wonder what hope there is\n\nfor that street to be the bridge we call it.\n\nKaty Shedlock is a pastor and poet in West Central, where she has lived for the last three years.

Who believe\n\nanimals can understand them. Your kinfolk might think\n\nlikewise. My kin rally yelps, squawks and croons from elk\n\nand coyotes, turkeys and owls. I do a decent turkey gobble\n\nmyself. Flow on, animal talkers, bird whisperers. Flow on.\n\nYou already speak to pets and no one asks if they can hear\n\nyou. We mammals grow bones in heads to transmit sound.\n\nThe hammer, anvil, stirrup. Speaking to other species\n\nmakes healthy sense in the head. Gobble on, you talkers\n\nand squawkers. Ride your words downwind, downstream.\n\nIn the spirit of the river, I urge you to babble to wildlife.\n\nNot only can they hear you; they will talk back if you learn\n\ntheir speech. Whistle to marmots in rocks beside the stream.\n\nThey might first fear you’re a fiend out to eat them; they might\n\ndive for their lairs. No matter. Let the air bear you, carry you.\n\nDon’t stop there. Open yourself like some St. Francis to\n\ninanimate beings. Address the trees, the stones, the water.\n\nLoft your language to the wind. Even if people on cliffs\n\nabove the river take you for a madman, a madwoman.\n\nEven if you come away drenched from the sheets of spray.\n\nUse words to channel water. Divide the silver like a seam.\n\nPaul Lindholdt is an English professor at EWU.

The old oak\n\nwe climbed, stark gray trunk blotched and bare like a ghost,\n\nwelcomes me to come sit again among her branches.\n\nWhenever I return, I ask:\n\nIs it a dying or a new breath?\n\nA robin lands in a nearby vacant lot,\n\ntwitches its tail twice\n\nand drops a seed.\n\nYvonne Higgins Leach is the author of Another Autumn (WordTech Editions, 2014).

Our own mortality distant, an endlessness of now.\n\nThe intention to leave; wanting more.\n\nBut who can resist the familiar, a garden.\n\nManito, Manito, Manito.\n\nAnjaela Mertens is from Spokane, she has always worked in libraries. She loves to travel to see a concert. She married a man that loves the same music. They live in an old house, work in their garden and walk around the Garland district. She is politically liberal, has a cat, and likes to dance and do yoga.\n\nOn Cannon Hill Pond\n\nNancy Lindberg\n\nOur greeting when we moved in was a pair of swans, gliding regally across the water.\n\nEvery day was like living in a National Geographic special! We watched turtles plod single file down the hill one night, moving from Manito to “our” pond to lay their eggs on the shore. Sometimes a Blue Heron would camouflage itself in the bulrushes or in a tree, waiting to dive for its lunch.\n\nWhen the autumn colors took over the flora, the honking of Canadian geese would snap our heads to the sky to watch their perfect “V.” Squirrels would scurry to and fro, digging holes for their cache.\n\nQuacking ducks and chirping birds of every color were part of the daily soundtrack. A small raft of ducks would stay the winter, floating and foraging while we skated around them on the frozen pond. The Christmas Eve caroling around the bonfire was an annual neighborhood tradition that lifted our spirits.\n\nHot summer nights were sleepless as the loud mating croaks of the bullfrogs created a racket. Then at 5:00 most mornings, a huge congress of crows in our big tree would wake us with their clamorous meetings.\n\nThe nearby church bells would ring joyful reminders every day. The trees waved as we “trip-trapped” across the stone bridges where the old trolls lived. We became rich with nature’s sights and sounds and the memories of living there will stay with us forever.\n\nNancy (MacDonald) Lindberg is a Spokane native, raised near Whitworth.

Besides\n\nactual neighbors\n\nwere in short supply: houses scattered here and there\n\nsurrounded by fields, some cold and fallow, some flushed green with\n\nwinter wheat.\n\nMy grandmother once drove me north up Five Mile Road\n\nto buy fresh milk,—straight\n\nfrom the cow, into the bottle, a thick\n\nplug of cream floating on top—\n\nfrom a “neighbor” who lived two\n\nmiles away in a house that’s still standing.\n\nBut everything\n\nelse has changed: the prairie’s become a neighborhood\n\ncrammed with dozens of neighbors but not much more: a sad, cul de\n\nsac’ed park,\n\na bursting-at-the-seams elementary school,\n\na water tower,\n\ncouple of churches, but no stores, no bars,\n\nno coffee shops, just houses\n\nand more houses, jammed tightly\n\ntogether, filled with families who will\n\nhave to look elsewhere\n\nif they desire some neighborhood amenities,\n\nbecause their bottle’s mostly empty. And there never was any cream.\n\nSpokane, and Five Mile Prairie in particularly, have been part of Dirk Stratton’s biography since the beginning. He’s not sure the Prairie qualifies as a neighborhood (even now), but it is the only part of the city with which he’s really at all familiar.\n\nTraces\n\nEric Woodard\n\nOn hot nights, we would slip through the side door\n\n(just propped, for air)\n\nto see For the Love of Benji again.\n\nThe good ones never came to the Garland\n\nuntil Paul Quam took the mic before every dollar movie.\n\nThen we got the good ones, but months,\n\nyears late.\n\nOne night we found\n\nthe door closed.\n\nWe never saw it ajar again.\n\nMy dad rarely went to the Brown Derby,\n\nbut Greg’s dad did.\n\nWe could see him through the window sometimes\n\nplaying the jukebox, pull tabs, pool.\n\nHis face was happy and his eyes were sad.\n\nThe AC was loose at Quam Jewelers.\n\nWe almost became jewel thieves\n\nbriefly,\n\nuntil we got stuck in the duct.\n\nWe walked home, bleeding.\n\nYears later, masked in the ashfall,\n\nwe walkie-talkied in the 7-11, me by the Asteroids,\n\nGreg by the beer.\n\n“Can you read me? Over.”\n\nOn a cold, dark planet, its strange, scared creatures ignored us.\n\nOn the way home, we coveted through the window\n\nthe Darth Vader mask at the Novelty Nook.\n\nWe thought that mask would make us\n\nso powerful\n\nthat nobody could pretend not to notice us again.\n\nEric Woodard has taught English and psychology at Lewis and Clark High School since 1992.

Eldred\n\nAt 2704 Northwest Boulevard you will find the Cat Hotel,\n\nquite near the snow heavy trees of Audubon Park.\n\nThe Cat Hotel is an unassuming little building;\n\na pile of scrap wood and chicken wire are stacked behind it.\n\nInside you will no doubt find some kennel cages, litter boxes,\n\nscattered toys, a bored attendant, The place smells comfortably like pee.\n\nBut come inside and look around, I think you’ll find this place a sumptuous affair.\n\nWhat we don’t know is that this is not only a Hotel for cats; it is run by cats.\n\nAs you approach the Front Desk of polished mahogany and brass\n\n(with a few claw marks on the sides admittedly, sometimes you just have to dig at wood)\n\nyou’ll be approached by the cheery bellhop in his cap with his bowtie. His tail is almost always\n\nrampant with enthusiasm while he’s chatty with you as you check in.\n\nHis enthusiasm and chin rubs on you are infectious; even if you don’t want to, you’ll like him.\n\nHis secret pain that droops his tail when he’s alone is that he’s in love with the sleek Siamese\n\nfrom Housekeeping. You’ll see why when you see her. She is exquisite, a haughty goddess that\n\npads the carpeted hallways up to an hour late every day if she feels like it. A pout is all she needs\n\nto obtain forgiveness for her trespasses, still hung over and smelling of catnip. She forever falls\n\nin love with the broken eared tattooed toms down by the dumpster behind the Satellite Diner.\n\nAt the center of all is the Hotelier. Cats can all stare with judging disdain, but he is a Master of\n\nthe Art. He says “Miaou” rather than “meow.” Despite his demeanor, everything happens with\n\nease. He nods to underlings or flicks an ear and things manifest for the guests. You sometimes\n\nfind him on the roof smoking Gauloises watching the traffic of NW Blvd go by through his\n\nmonocle. This season has been ghastly due to Covid, The Banquet Hall stands ready yet empty.\n\nThe lace tablecloth on the long table rests under the place settings with porcelain wet food bowls,\n\ndry food bowls, and crystal water and wine bowls. Truthfully, the Banquet Room was always\n\nseldom used because no one is allowed on the table. Still, the Siamese dusts in here occasionally.\n\nOh, and the Litterbox Attendant. Please tip him well. He’s been here forever, and the Bellhop\n\nclaims that the Attendant told him once that he is seventeen years old. This couldn’t have been\n\nhis dream. But he never tells what those dreams were. He does tell stories about the old days if\n\nyou ask politely and no one else is around, as he rakes the sand imported from Bermuda.\n\nCalven S.

I wonder what my kids think of it\n\nas they run back and forth inside its shadow.\n\nAcross the street I see the same bearded man I see each day I come to the park.\n\nHe sits on the same rock\n\nnear the same parking lot entrance.\n\nOne mid-July day I bought a case of water at the grocery store and walked up\n\nto the bearded man, arm extended.\n\nHe smiled and shook his head.\n\n“I’m all good. But thank you.”\n\nThe man next to him look at me, then to him, and finally back to me.\n\n“Do you want a couple,” I asked this other man.\n\n“A couple? Hell yeah, I do!” He scooped a few bottles into his arms.\n\nI look at the bearded man and think about what his unknown life.\n\nI watch him watching the cars entering\n\nand exiting the parking lot.\n\nMy kids’ laughter wafts from the water tower, but I hardly register it.\n\nI silently ask the bearded man if he is sure.\n\nHe looked back at me, letting me know he was sure\n\nwithout bothering to utter a single word.\n\nJoseph Edwin Haeger is the author of Learn to Swim (University of Hell Press, 2015).

All are the marvels of this wonderful neighborhood where man and animal are equal in this peaceful, tranquil world.\n\nIn autumn patches of brilliant golds, reds, oranges and browns dot the trails and river bends. Huge basalt outcrops take stance unexpectedly in their magnitude, mountain trails that lead to surprise adventures extend for miles as if in a Narnia experience. A sudden black panther sleuthily ascends from the abyss below, its fur sleeker than velvet. A patter of exuberant heartbeats sends ecstasy and fear through the captive onlooker.\n\nSpring brings volumes of tumulus waters cascading in channels carrying rock and debris to the fast-flowing river that waits patiently. Unexpected adventure lurks. Deer grace the path, a buck or an old bull elk has found respite in mossy grasses laden with pine boughs and needles. Once osprey had nests hovering high in the mountain trees. If one is fortunate, an eagle is seen soaring to magnificent heights.\n\nIn summer long ago as night fell, one could hear the eerie call of a pack of coyotes, or see a family and its cubs as if out for an afternoon stroll, or observe the peaceful serenity of a beaver swimming towards its den enjoying summer’s heat. A doe in the secure thicket of lodge pole pines feeling secure from her predators. Various wild flowers with hues of purples, yellows and wild balsam root with its magnificent electric color gracing the forest’s floor.\n\nWinter snows bring cross-country adventures with hundreds of trails to escape to. People now bundle up warm for cold winter blasts. Deer are now seen hovering in packs to keep warm. It is indeed a beautiful piece of heaven that nears my home. Great foresight was taken to set such a wondrous part of nature aside for all to enjoy.\n\nRiverside State Park – This is Everyone’s Neighborhood.\n\nRoots\n\nChris Coppen\n\nFrom the front steps it’s all trees – a few maples\n\nand one larch, and ponderosa pines the vestige\n\nof the region’s native forest which whispers tribes\n\nwhen the wind rises. Among them we have carved\n\na habitat – split-levels of an age that keeps roofers in business.\n\nOn these streets, Cale once rode his bike with playing cards\n\nclacking in the spokes, and now drives up to visit\n\nfrom San Francisco. Katherine calls from Missoula\n\nto have us mail a book from her bedroom shelf.\n\nAbout every third house has young kids who prattle past,\n\nholding daddy’s hand. The yards, all once an ocean\n\nof juniper, have islands of tomatoes and zucchini.\n\nEverywhere run roots of the trees, rising here and there\n\nlike memories. Underground they wind, much like\n\nthe paths we neighbors take – Mary to Christy’s\n\nwith homegrown sage and thyme, me to Pete’s to talk\n\nsnow as he rakes leaves, Molly from across the way\n\nto see our new fence. Barb’s dog crisscrosses\n\nthe street, wagging her tail at everyone.\n\nThe paths are well-worn, and mapped within us.\n\nThey feed us in our neighborly communions as\n\nthe roots feed the trees, which breathe among us.\n\nWe sit on our steps and listen in the breeze\n\nas they invite us into centuries.\n\nChris “Cop” Coppen is a clinical social worker.

Since the pandemic started, she has been back in the neighborhood and enjoying these views again. This poem is a meditation on that experience.\n\nCity Life\n\nBlaine Holland\n\nLiving life underneath an old street light\n\nCounting the cars on a cool summer night\n\nYeah, the city life it suits me fine\n\nLooking out on a broken skyline\n\nI drive up to the southside\n\nSo, I can look down on these city lights\n\nBut you know I can’t hang with the downtown crowd\n\nThat’s why you’ll find me on the northside of town\n\nUnderneath the clear blue sky\n\nEverybody gets by just fine\n\nWe got them mid-size city blues\n\nand nobody knows just what to do\n\nI was born between the river and the railroad track\n\nThey both taught me to never look back\n\nI go and see them still today\n\nWhen I get lost, they show me the way\n\nIt’s a mystic thing what these streets can do\n\nAll my secrets lie between the avenue\n\nOne day when they put me in the grave\n\nThey will find a city boy who lost his way\n\nUnderneath the clear blue sky\n\nEverybody gets by just fine\n\nWe got them mid-size city blues\n\nAnd nobody knows just what to do\n\nBlaine Holland is a singer-songwriter, born and raised in Spokane, who grew up on the Northeast side of town.\n\nIt's 6 a.m.\n\nTim Greenup\n\nIt’s 6 am\n\nand my neighbor’s truck has been idling\n\nin his driveway for almost an hour. The whole ice-crusted block\n\nsmells like diesel fuel and burnt gas station coffee.\n\nFrom inside the truck you can hear the muffled sound of 94.1\n\nThe Bear blasting ​the rock you know​ through blown out\n\nfactory speakers. When they say ​the rock you know\n\nthey mean AC/DC and Van Halen for a noisy eternity,\n\nwhich is unideal, though could also be worse.\n\nI remember hearing “Runnin’ with the Devil” for the first time\n\nin Sean Oakes’ living room. It may have been on cassette,\n\nI don’t remember. But the bass line meant everything to me.\n\nThen I learned to play it — an open, rhythmic E, over and over.\n\nA pulsing eternity. Downright sexual.\n\nElsewhere, a block over a woman is no doubt pulling her Buick aside and\n\npushing a pile of empty airplane bottles off her passenger seat\n\nand into the street. Most of them are for Fireball Whisky,\n\nthough one chic blue bottle once housed a dose of SKYY Vodka.\n\nLord, that had been a day. She chuckles to herself\n\nand fluffs her white hair in the mirror. Then throws back\n\nthe last of her current bottle before chucking that\n\ntoo into the street. She drives nondescriptly away, no doubt\n\nVan Halen’s “Runnin’ with the Devil” thumping in her heart,\n\neven if she can’t hear it. I’ll find the bottles later\n\nwhen I’m living my own rock and roll dream walking\n\nwith my son and daughter toward the trees.\n\nI’ll nudge them gently closer to the curb for safety.\n\nTim Greenup is a poet and musician.

During the day, climbers stare at the precipice\n\npreparing themselves for what’s to come.The moss covered stones\n\nremain resilient in the heavy snow,with a lush verdancy in the trees\n\nand flora growing to spite the cold.\n\nAs the sun passes through the sky the days warm, the mornings\n\nbecome a display of golden highlights caressing trees as they lean,\n\nbent from listening to the wind. The warmth brings more vibrancy\n\nto the brilliance of the colors blooming from the ground. People walk\n\ntheir dogs following different pathways, searching to breathe deep\n\nthe calm air and rest their mind from the plastic and metallic\n\nthat usually surrounds them. There are pockets of silent reverie\n\nallowing the soul to rest easy inside the chest, allowing for the harsh\n\nbeating inside to slow down and find a new rhythm. As the earth\n\nheals itself, the energy it provides heals its curious, meandering guests.\n\nHere there is a place for recovery and hope, when the snow frosts\n\nthe earth or when the new growth reaches out to the sun. The laughter\n\nfrom the children running around the playground below echoes out\n\nlike leaves on branches happily rustling in a soothing breeze.\n\nNo matter how often the area is explored, new life and voices join\n\nin the symphony of sound in the surroundings. The rhythm\n\nleaves a soft humming in the body that clears cobwebs of dust covering\n\nthe trails within, each clearing reveals to visitors that the crisp air\n\nthat encompasses all is needed to survive.\n\nSarah Rooney works as an information specialist at a library while going to school for her Masters in Information and Library Science.

Meanwhile like\n\njazz musicians our local police officers respond to daily offenses, misdemeanors as well as\n\nfelons taking away our possible nightmares or creating them?\n\nWe are besieged by a series of traumatic events…we are minor prisoners while we wait for life\n\nto be safe again. Beauty touches us as an eagle flying for the first time over the tall fir trees.\n\nAirplanes stop and we can breathe. Snowflakes save us painting over the grey dystopian quiet\n\nsplattered with red spray paint graffiti on our necks dripping Black Lives Matter.\n\nWake up.\n\nWe woke up.\n\nWe were asleep to our neighbor, our neighborhood. During summer two young tattooists sit on\n\na stoop of a green parlor in which they work. With audacity they drink beer and barbecue.\n\nNeighbors notice and our wrap around porches and front yards become gathering places, we\n\ncan see and hear each other creating heart oxygen masks for our souls. Laughter helps, too.\n\nBats become a favorite pastime as we all wait til sunset to watch them fly overhead wild and\n\nfree they do not turn into dracula.\n\nWe remember what children playing in the front yard sounds like and grandparents telling\n\nstories of days gone by become church bells opening up our imagination. Life is slow, our cats\n\nremind us of that. Dogs need to be walked many a variety becomes best in show. One dog\n\ngroomer goes under and another takes its place with even more fancy mopped hair puppies\n\ngetting manicures.\n\nIce Cream unlike snow comes in 31 flavors a local childrens watering hole…we soon realize it\n\nis a distraction created by the great spirit or maybe by buddha or gods grace topped with\n\nhumour as we notice that no rain, nor fire, or virus will keep living people away from here. Some\n\nleave without ever being able to say goodby. It helps keep the threads of our neighborhood\n\ntogether, joyful as family, friends possibly even those secret lovers.\n\nMy husband, waking, quietly puts his finger on the nape of my neck. Was I breathing?\n\nGarbage trucks rumble down the alley, waking me, a sigh of relief. Though it has just snowed, a\n\nbee sleeps awaiting to awaken a flower.\n\nJamie Absalonson is a street photographer, writer, producer, artist, activist, and sometime character actor.\n\nI am Spokane\n\nMichael Bethely\n\nI was born in a Holy Family.\n\nA Hospital.\n\nA grandson to a pastor with the same named Temple.\n\nI am an uncommon occurrence;\n\nA majority of the minority are imports.\n\nNot me.\n\nI was an export, of the city named after my favorite sport.\n\nLet’s Hoop!\n\nIt’s a town in the USA, that every now and then will get a little play.\n\nA little zig, a little Zag,\n\nA little recognition.\n\nA place you can be @…and get mentions.\n\nThe Lilac City.\n\nFull of Legends.\n\nMy hope is that the known and unknown will receive reverence.\n\nAnd that it won’t matter the color of the surface…\n\nOr how red the turf is…\n\nbut that we all fly like an Eagle.\n\nI Am Spokane.\n\nI’m small, with a big heart.\n\nGot love for the Spoken Art.\n\nI’m not the outdoorsy type,\n\nBut being creative by nature, has me on the trails of a spark…\n\nOf an idea, that I’m able to bring to life\n\nwith Action,\n\nCameras,\n\nand Lights!\n\nI Am Spokane\n\nMichael Bethely is passionate about serving and creating opportunities to inspire, encourage, and motivate people to BE.

We will learn to wear the masks, to wash the ash from our skin,\n\nto believe the particles we breathe won’t make us sick. We watch the skies and wonder when the winds\n\nwill change, when the dry heat will break, clouds tense with rain and static. We know what thunder means,\n\nthe response to the call, that new flames will flicker into life in a rush of sound like an opened dam.\n\nNow, when we make the summer drive between Seattle and Spokane, we watch for signs of sparks, a lit cigarette,\n\nplumes of white billowing from a hood, the sure signs that mean the brush will catch,\n\nsend a swirl of flame along the scrub, and char huge swaths of land before county fire can even get the call.\n\nWe see the blackened ground, the tell-tale signs where fire jumped and burned the median and channels of basalt.\n\nMore than once, we imagined the Wild Horses in flames, their steel manes engulfed, haunches bucking against the heat.\n\nOnly on the clearest days, we can see Rainier at Ryegrass. It is an elusive view, like spotting elk or coyotes who roam these hills.\n\nThe windshield and grill are mostly clear, as smoke makes fewer splotches of guts, wings, thoraces, and legs\n\nbent like geometric hazards. But the same blood stains on the road, the same gigantic wingspan of black circling above,\n\njust waiting, floating on the hazy currents for those ripping moments of carrion. We much prefer the flutter of magpie,\n\nits black and white shimmer, as it glides along the beige and wheaty stalks that line each section of road.\n\nIt used to be that fire season started in the fall, as leaves crisped from green to yellow and students sat sweating\n\nwith every window open in the schools. We remember the urgency of the sirens as Latah Creek, just beyond the city limits,\n\nwas burning, raining ash that made my mother remember the eruption. I have no memory of that day,\n\nthe way the morning darkened like the world might be at end. I only remember the late summer fires,\n\nthe afternoon heat and cold nights, Smokey’s finger always pointed to red: Extreme.\n\nJenne Knight writes poetry and creative nonfiction.

I enjoy the sight of century old\n\nPonderosa pines with dark red bark, looking like jigsaw puzzle pieces.\n\nWalking the Bluff all seasons, I am rarely alone.\n\nI spot coyotes, bald eagles, blue herons and chickadees.\n\nI meet runners, hikers, dog walkers and careless trudgers,\n\nfast mountain bikers maneuvering around people and rocks on uneven paths.\n\nI imagine we share a love of trails\n\ncarving through the hillside\n\nmisty mysterious mornings in late fall\n\nthick frosty pine needles in early\n\nwinter days and the fresh snow to follow.\n\nFaded sun at around two in winter afternoons,\n\ndelightful for the muted warmth it gives for just fifteen minutes!\n\nI imagine we share a love of\n\nthe profuse yellow of the arrow leaf balsam root in spring,\n\nan explosion of hope for the summer to come.\n\nJuneberries and elderberries ripening in June and July\n\nnot known by many now,\n\nbut enjoyed and harvested by generations of native peoples.\n\nThose warm late summer sunsets,\n\ninviting lazy strolls and an inclination not to go home.\n\nThe Bluff offers a refuge from COVID life, when\n\nI want to float a little above this difficult world.\n\nTightropes&Turkeys&Trying&Trying&Trying\n\nKailee Haong\n\nI walk the jagged rocks at the top of Cliff Drive like a balance beam, a tightrope. Impending doom is not death or broken bones but the city below.\n\nSpokane, Spokane, how you haunt me and hold me.\n\nI walk the rocks one step at a time. Don’t look down. I always look down.\n\nHeel toe Heel toe Heel toe\n\nSometimes it reeks of weed up here. Sometimes cigarette smoke streaming from cars loitering at the top of the hill. Other times, wet dirt. Fresh rain. The chalky smell of upturned gravel from a car peeling out of the place.\n\nBack down the hill is home, for now, and I dodge turkeys and tree roots blistering through the sidewalk as I return. There’s a little-free-library on my route back that I stop at, even though I already know its contents. Already have it categorized, memorized. Short little mystery book, beat-up bestseller, kid’s book, kid’s book, ratty cookbook.\n\nI tell myself I walk to make me love this place and it almost always works. I won’t be here forever. On Earth. In Spokane.\n\nBut for now, this neighborhood is mine and I am the king of it and I love my people. The men who walk their dog-show-quality border collies and the pastel-haired cashier at the grocery store and the man watching me twirl at the top of Cliff Park post-run and the picnic-goers and the ultimate-frisbee enthusiasts and you and you and you\n\n& I’m trying to burn this place into my memory so I never forget it & I’m trying to hold it and make it sacred while I can & I’m trying to leave a mark or a sign or a signal that I was here, that I lived here, that I ruled here, that I was this place and this place was me so when I return here, some 5, 10, 15 years in the future my neighborhood will open its arms and embrace me and kiss my head and say remember that time when, do you recall, let’s go for a walk, and welcome back,\n\nwe missed you.\n\nKailee Haong is a queer fiction writer.

Piecemeal these city blocks\n\nwill adorn you, or rather, it’s you now who are\n\nthe adornment, the next scrap of thread in the nest\n\nthe magpie spirit of these promontories is weaving,\n\nwoven together with those riots of tree frogs, those\n\nrafters of street turkeys who already know\n\nwhat you will discover: this corner of town\n\nis one of the centers of the earth.

I am from the busy Division street, where I and my friends cautiously cross on every walk.\n\nI am from my grandparents’ house, from the jungle gym on the couches to the camping creek spot, from the slithering snakes my grandmother would catch to the gorgeous Seattle space needle. From staying in fancy hotels to swimming in bright blue pools in Boulder Beach.\n\nI am from the smell of fruity Bath and Body Works candles burning to the smell of burning cigarettes when stepping outside. I am from my grandpa’s gross cinnamon frebreeze he loved so much.\n\nI am from my grandmother and grandpa who raised me when my mom was working. From Sarah and Rylie who have always been there as if they’re the back of my hand. From the people who told me to not turn out like them to the people who told me this life will hit you hard, and when it does, you’re going to have to get back up.\n\nI am from the weekly walks to the Duck Park until the streetlights turn on. I am from the walks back to the dinner table to eat. I am from hour-long trips to the post office and the gas station for goodies.\n\nI am from “I love you like a fat kid loves cake” to “stop crying before you’re given a reason to cry.” I am from sarcastically threatening your siblings with “I’ll get the switch!”\n\nI am from the back-alley dirt bike races and the nostalgic nighttime motorcycle rides. I am from the family fun nights of playing board games and puzzles. I am from the loud laughter to follow someone losing or raging in their defeat.\n\nI am from the Christmas Dinner banana pudding I wait for like a pleading dog. I am from the freshly picked huckleberries we scavenge for up north. I am from the store-bought watermelon that we eat in the scorching hot summer.\n\nI am from my mother’s high school stories she told around the blazing campfire. I am from the Christmas carols we played all day long to the sad and sometimes uplifting country music my family likes. I am from my mother’s CD’s that played old Chris brown songs and others.\n\nI am from the perfect pictures of me and my grandfather when I was younger stuck to my mirror. I am from the family books and baby books with every picture ever. I am from the family framed photos all along the speakers in my living room. From the professional pictures to the casual ones. These photos remind me that no matter what I go through, there is people there watching and helping me through it.\n\nAzzaraya is a 14-year-old girl attending Garry Middle School.

Wieber\n\nMy apologies in advance if I tend to go round and round about this silly prose.\n\nWas I ever delighted to discover in rather a roundabout fashion, that indeed we had acquired one!\n\nNow you may be asking at this juncture, “Acquired what”? Well let me explain.\n\nNever had I imagined the swiftness required to accomplish such a feat. It was in early summer that this old intersection residing at the interstate and historically bisected by a road named Barker would soon become the road not taken. I’d grown accustomed to the lights and backup traffic onto the freeway, and oh the waiting, waiting, waiting! For this was my primary route to work and back home for decades.

She is a college student who is hoping to pursue her love of writing, though she is currently studying environmental science.\n\nTrentwood (ca. 1965)\n\nGregory Davis\n\nBig K grocery – Shasta soda eight cents a can.\n\nWhere you could watch a red-nosed man.\n\nTurn in 400 empty beer bottles, penny apiece.\n\nEnough to buy twenty-four full ones.\n\nThrift Store – A miles’ frozen walk, dad and I\n\nfetching home ten Presto logs.\n\nSo we could survive\n\nanother zero degree night.\n\nKaiser Aluminum – Ravening hulk.\n\nSquatting south of Trent Ave.\n\nSwallowed dad for forty years.\n\nCut him loose with an arthritic knee.\n\nBlessings Tavern – Long, low dive.\n\nSteelworkers separated from their paychecks.\n\nAn ocean of three percent lager\n\nthe social lube.\n\nBreese’s Barber Shop – Old men with bad coughs\n\nspittin and chewin.\n\nCursing new words into my adolescent ears.\n\nWhile I got my boot camp style crew cut.\n\nTrentwood (ca. 1965) – Kids played on the mean streets.\n\nGrownups prayed for ends to meet.\n\nSome called the place the a slum.\n\nIt was, for some.\n\nGregory Davis is sixty-seven years old.

Tall pines, evergreens, and\n\nColorful varieties of deciduous trees dot the land\n\nThroughout the development.\n\nMostly quiet—except for the year-round sound of\n\nA faint train whistle in the distance, and on\n\nCold, winter mornings, maintenance crews scrape\n\nSnow and ice off the sidewalks.\n\nIn the Spring, Summer, and Fall, the hum of a\n\nRiding lawn mower can be heard,\n\nGrooming the grass, so property values\n\nWon’t plummet.\n\nMy condo neighbors include an artist, a retired\n\nFlight attendant, as well as a man whose second\n\nHome is in Coeur d’ Alene. Some California\n\nResidents are absent owners.\n\nFormerly a Lower South Hill resident, I chose\n\nThis location because there were no steep hills to climb,\n\nMaking exercising for thirty minutes each day\n\nSo much easier.\n\nJoan M. Kop grew up in Cottonwood, Idaho. After attending school to become a legal secretary, she was recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency. She later graduated from Gonzaga University and is the author of Spies, Lies & Psychosis and The Freedom Chaser.\n\nApproachment\n\nMary G. Seubert\n\nAn eclectic community robustly thrives where the dam recedes the Little Spokane River’s flow.\n\nWith the backdrop of buzzing flight at Felts Field (there’s joy in the antics of antique biplanes but monotony in the helicopter’s whirling roar) the small plane airfield is proud home to Mamer’s & Walker’s historic flight.\n\nTrain’s iron wheels rumble on while their mighty horns noisily announce their presence as they angrily bestow\n\nA warning to heed their length when they block the tracks (rumbling by both day and night).\n\nChurches line Park Road along with a pre-school and elementary which are supported with a day care close by.\n\nFrom Fancher to Vista this section of Spokane Valley City supports HUD houses up to multi-million-dollar mansions hanging on the river’s cliffs.\n\nA field that abuts the airfield becomes a suitable option where you can walk your leashed dogs and have a chance to say a friendly “hi”.\n\nVehicle traffic is thankfully decreased for lack of a bridge that would make the north-south areas easily swift.\n\nSeveral yards contain varied animal residents (ducks, geese, chickens, and the occasional Yorkie Pig) other than the standard squirrels, dogs, and cats.\n\nRiding by them at dusk on a one-speed bicycle I hear their quacks and clucks from the quiet streets and breathe in the scent of a flower’s bloom.\n\nPleasure from its display prompts memories that in turn frame the distant sound of baseball from the park and the happy acclaim of well-played bats.\n\nNear Nature, Near Perfect, you approach the tree-lined streets that house my home and nests of birds as they their feathers plume.\n\nMary G. Seubert is a retired female resident of Greater Spokane since 1969. She is a graduate of Fort Wright College with B.A. in Liberal Arts (Music (piano)/major, English Lit/minor).\n\nChattaroy Haiku\n\nKevin Brown\n\nThe Governor’s nuts\n\nare a popular item\n\nat the town diner\n\nScattering the crows\n\nI slow, passing the carcass\n\nhit just yesterday\n\nIn a fallow field\n\nwild turkey tracks following\n\nno clear direction\n\nUp in the pear tree\n\nthe porcupine’s glowing eyes\n\njust before I fire\n\nIn the soft moonlight\n\nharvesting our first apples\n\na giant bull moose\n\nI wake to the owls\n\nand lay in bed listening\n\nstill an old white man\n\nMorning: first snowfall\n\nThe doe paws the ground\n\nlooking for yesterday\n\nKevin Brown is a local songwriter and musician with four solo albums of original songs to his credit, as well as two with the long-running rhythm & bluegrass quartet Big Red Barn.

Browning lives with her family in the Moran Prairie neighborhood, within walking distance of the property they once rented, described in this poem. She is an instructor at Spokane Community College.\n\nFairwood Park\n\nZoey R. Zeller\n\nTrees shroud our houses, twined with deer and shade. If you came on a weekday afternoon in August, you might see kids riding their bikes to the pool with bags slung over their shoulders and teenagers crowding the bridge down the trail. You might find a tree filled with black capped chickadees or robins. Once I found a whole robin’s egg on the ground, so I rushed home and put it under a lamp, just like how it told me to online. It didn’t make it, though. In Linda Hogan’s “One Mind,” she writes, “Mallow blooms around me as I stand on the hill trying to remove the invasive burr thistle.” This is like our neighborhood cleanup days, where everyone goes down to the trail to pick up trash and plant trees and block side trails—which cause erosion—with big logs. We no longer do this because of COVID-19. History lives down the street, and my friends live in the other direction. I read in Spokane[:] Our Early History that lots near Manito Park were once sold for $250-$450. Our house near the Bozarth cost $260,000 in the 2010s. When it rains, the smell seems to bounce off the air, and it was shortly after such a rain one summer when a moose wandered our yard, plucked leaves off our cherry trees. In the winter you might see community snow forts at the park, and in our backyard you might see tips of the dogwood beneath a layer of snow.\n\nZoey R. Zeller, age 11, is an avid reader, dragon enthusiast, dog owner, fosterer of cats, big sister, and blogger—about the realities of attending school during the Covid-19 pandemic, among other things. Zoey reads a lot of novels. She does not have any social media accounts."
