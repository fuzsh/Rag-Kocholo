But they don't come to meditate among the flowers.\n\nThey come to work.\n\nBending their tired backs to weed or plant, they hear hymns drift out from the stained-glass windows of St. Mary's Church as the choir rehearses. Sailboats whisper in and out of Spa Creek. Birds gather for an evening bath in the fountain that burbles at the sandaled, granite feet of Mary and Jesus.\n\n\"And you really feel that this must be what heaven is like,\" says Laura Van Geffen. \"If it is heaven,\" she adds, \"the Saints and angels are laughing at me.\"\n\n\"I feel as if I've been tricked,\" she says as she wipes her sweaty forehead with the back of a garden-gloved hand. \"I'm Catholic, but I never understood the veneration of Mary. I used to pray, 'I don't get it. Show me how to love your mother.'\n\n\"Then this fell in my lap\". Mrs. Van Geffen drives a spade into the soft, spring earth where another rosebush will be planted.\n\n\"I would have preferred a revelation to years of backbreaking work.\"\n\nSomewhere between the muddy reality of tilled soil and the chaste beauty of the woman for whom the flowers are named, there lies the Mary Garden.\n\nThe flrst public garden dedicated to the Virgin seems to have been the Garden of Our Lady at St. Joseph's Church in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, in 1932.\n\nJohn S. Stokes Jr., who, with Edward A. G. McTague, in 1951 began a spare-time project called Mary's Gardens in Philadelphia, remains the official arbiter and historian. He says the Mary Garden at St. Mary's is the largest one in a parish, and praises it for its beauty and its spirituai roots.\n\nThe garden is tucked behind St. Mary's Church, hardly known beyond the high walls of the 300-year-old church and rectory that protect it. The breezes of nearby Spa Creek rustle it softly, like a prayer. Even parishioners who pass through it on their way to the parking lot after Mass are not all aware of its symbolism.\n\nFor the handful of women of St Mary's who tend it, this patch of earth represents something between God and gardening. It is a spiritual Journey that needs to be watered and weeded. It is a meditation on Christ's mother that requires 70 bags of mulch twice a year.\n\n\"There is a tranquility here that keeps coming back in the middle of our crazy lives,\" says Kahla Lehman. The hedge trimmer she grips with two hands flies like a sword which is a sharp contrast to her words. \"We all have weeds at home, you know.\"\n\nThe Mary Garden began as a seed in the determined mind of Nan Sears, a St. Mary's parishioner who, at 76, is not much taller than the hollyhock spikes she tends. (In the Mary Garden, they are called St. Joseph's staff.) She had been waiting since 1945, when a garden club lecturer first told her of Mary Gardens, to create such a church garden.\n\n\"Having grown up with a family who loved the woods and the wilds, it is part of me,\" says Mrs. Sears. \"I don't ever walk through a garden that I haven't thought of her. I feel she is there, a part of everything beautiful in the outdoors. I wanted a Mary Garden as a tribute to her and to be closer to her.\n\nIn 1989, the pastor of St. Mary's, the Rev. John Murray, gave Mrs. Sears his blessing to turn a patch of weeds and gum wrappers behind the church into such a tribute. \"Just don't ask me for any money,\" he said cheerfully.\n\nTony Dove, curator of the gardens at London Towne Publik House in Edgewater, and Mrs. Van Geffen, a heavy-duty volunteer who, at 50, has the freedom to garden that only older children can give you, joined Mrs. Sears in designing the garden.\n\nTons of topsoil were moved in, and a statue was commissioned. All of this was done before Mrs. Sears and Mrs. Van Geffen, at cocktail parties and in church, had collected the $35,000 to pay for It. \"I've had to believe that she wanted it there,\" says Mrs. Sears.\n\nIn 1991, Father Murray dressed in his finest vestments and sprinkled the garden with holy water. It was Sept. 8, the feast of Mary's birth, the traditional day for blessing the harvest and the seeds for the coming spring.\n\nToday, the Mary Garden is full and mature. Colors move through it in waves as the seasons change. It is a backdrop for photos of brides and first Holy Communion children. Factory workers eat lunch there. St. Mary's schoolchildren plant Mother's Day flowers there. And mourners weep there.\n\n\"One time, it is just a pretty place. Another time, it hits you hard because of something that is going on in your life,\" says Mrs. Sears.\n\n\"It is a thinking place,\" says Mrs. Lehmann, a 40-year-old stay-at-home mom from Annapolls. \"I have been working here when people come to sit. And you can feel their hearts breaking.\"\n\nA statue at the center\n\nAt the center of the garden is the granite statue of Mary and Jesus. He looks to be about 9 or 10, and he gazes up at her with the kind of love in his face that only a mother ever sees.\n\nCreated by sculptor Leo Irrera, it recalls the Holy Family's peaceful time in Nazareth, when Mary might have had a garden of her own.\n\nAround the statue and fountain are the flowers that carry Mary's name or praise her attributes, or recall some Mary of Nazareth household possession. You'd recognize them all. None is rare. But you know them by other names, not the names given them by priests, poets and storytellers in the Middle Ages. The Mary names were erased during the Reformation when devotion to the Virgin went out of fashion.\n\nForget-me-nots are the eyes of Mary: a bleeding heart is Mary's heart; sedum recalls Our Lady's hair; fuchsia, Our Lady's eardrops; lavender is known as flight to Egypt; the thrift is Our Lady's pincushion; gladiolus was her ladder to heaven; the iris, Mary's sword of sorrow.\n\nChurch fathers first referred to Mary as \"the rose of Sharon\" and \"the lily of the valley\" from references in the Old Testament that they believed foretold the virgin mother of the savior of the world. But early Christians found reminders of Mary in every flower that bloomed. The rose was an emblem of her love of God. The lily represented her purity, the myrtle her virginity, the violet her humility and the marigold her heavenly glory.\n\nIn other flowers, there was seen some resemblance to her hair, her fingers, her hands. Still others called to mind her mantle, her smock, her slippers. Others, her needles, her thread, her thimble. It seemed everything she touched was remembered in a flower.\n\nElaborate legends grew around her flowers. Manger plants - holy hay, cradlewort, Our Lady's bedstraw - were supposed to have bloomed when the newborn Jesus was laid on them. The white markings on Our Lady's thistle first appeared when her milk dropped on them as she nursed the infant. Rosemary's clean fragrance is said to have come from the days when Mary hung her wash on its bushes to dry.\n\nNot all are cheerful. Our Lady's tears appeared when she wept at the foot of the cross; Our Lady's hair, when she rended her tresses in grief.\n\nFor the people of the countryside, who could not read or had no books of theology, flowers recorded the story of Mary's life.\n\nReligious nature\n\nFor the women of St. Mary's, this is more than a horticultural hobby. Mr. Stokes has written them, urging the restoration of the prayerful dignity of gardening, the returm to the understanding that nature is the link between God and man.\n\n\"True happiness does not come from hundreds of blossoms, gigantic blooms or riotous color,\" Mr. Stokes writes. \"Neither does it come from scratching the earth and throwing in a few seeds. Rather, it comes from the devoted tending of the good and faithful steward, who realizes his or her dependence on God's providence and who sees in its fruits God's artistry.\"\n\nMrs. Van Geffen and Mrs. Lehmann, attracted to the Mary Garden project by the spunk of Mrs. Sears, are not so ephemeral as they fill garbage bags with weeds and unload flats of marigolds, known in the garden as Mary's Gold. They are the strong backs here. But there is God in their gardening. And they believe God is in this garden.\n\n\"We have our own little ecosystem going here,\" says Mrs. Van Geffen, who has her own garden a short walk from St. Mary's. \"The walls, the sun, the Holy Spirit. Everything grows here, even the weeds.\"\n\n\"We all have places we have to be,\" says Mrs. Lehmann. She often brings her energetic kids with her as she works, and finds the garden calms 9-year-old Lindsay and 7-year-old Jamie as surely as a lullaby might.\n\n\"But you just have to have this mental image of how it will feel here. Then you just get yourself here, and God takes over.\"\n\nReprinted with permission of The Baltimore Sun, article by Susan Reimer, photographs by Amy Davis.\n\nTop\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE GARDEN PLANTING\n\nThe Mary Garden in the court of St. Mary's Parish, Annapolis adjacent to historic Carroll House was initially laid out through the expertise of horticulturalist Tony Dove, who at that time was Curator of the London Tower Public Gardens in Edgewater, Maryland. It was dedicated in a special blessing ceremony on the Vigil of the Assumption, 1988, in honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary and her Divine Son, and as a tribute to the deep faith in Mary of John Carroll, first Bishop of the United States, and to his constant recourse to Mary for the protection and blessing of his undertakings for the development of the early United States Church.\n\nThe Garden was planted, and incorporated into Parish life, with the blessing of the pastor, through the initiative of parishioners who wished to share more fully with others the spiritual riches, devotion and prayerful work of their home Mary Gardens. The Garden is maintained by volunteer members of the parish Mary Garden Guild.\n\nA special section of the Garden, in the boxwood circle, is developed and maintained by pupils of the parish school.\n\nThe pink Vermont granite focal statue of Mary and the boy Jesus, \"Mary of Nazareth\" - especially designed for the Garden by renowned sculptor, Leo Irrera, in residence at the Pius VI Religious Art Center in Washington, D.C. and designer and coordinator of the Navy Memorial in D.C. - was installed in 1991, with dedication blessing on the feast of the Birth of Mary.\n\nThe Flowers of Our Lady in the Mary Garden include many flowers uniquely native to the Americas which were adopted and named as symbols of their faith by early Christian explorers, missionaries, converts and settlers. Notable among these are three which have become known and cultivated throughout the world: the Marigold (recalling the European Marigold), Passion Flower and Fuchsia (Our Lady's Eardrops).\n\nOther widely cultivated American plants commonly known by religious names locally or regionally - as recorded, like those of Europe, by botanists, folklorist and lexicographers - include the Poinsettia (\"Christmas Flower\"), Zinnea (\"Little Mary\"), Blue Morning Glory (\"Our Lady's Mantle\"), Ageratum ( \"St. John's Flower\"), Celosia (\"Jesus Plant\"), Cosmos (\"St. Michael\"), Caladium ( \"Heart of Jesus\"), Calceolaria (\"Our Lady's Slipper\"), Gloxinia (\"Canterbury Bells\"), Tiger Flower (\"Christ's Knee\"), Dahlia (\"Church Flower\"), Sunflower (\"Marigold of Peru\") and Yucca (\"Tower of Ivory\").\n\nAlso included among the Flowers of Our Lady are some of the numerous centuries-old flower symbols of articles in the Nazareth household such as Mary's needlework, lace, pincushion, mirror, brushes, comb, duster, drying plant, ladle, candle, knives and forks, etc. Symbols of Mary's features such as her eyes, hair, hand, fingers; of her garments such as her mantle, smock, veil, shawl, slippers; and of her food such as bread, cheeses, flavoring.\n\nReflection on these symbols brings visitors to the Garden to meditation on the daily life of the Holy Family in Nazareth, as Mary and Joseph nurtured the boy Jesus in his growth \"in age, wisdom and grace before God and man\".\n\nThe flower symbols of Mary's spiritual life and mysteries include: the white \"Madonna Lily\" of her immaculate purity, \"Mary's Rose\" of spiritual love, the pansy of \"Our Lady's Delight\" in the Trinity, first revealed to Mary, the \"Lily-of-the-Valley\" of her humility, the violet of \"Our Lady's Modesty\", \"Mary's Tulip\" of spiritual openness, the strawberry - \"Fruitful Virgin\" - of her virginal motherhood (in flower and fruit at the same time), \"Our Lady's Bedstraw\" of the manger, \"Christmas Rose\", \"Star of Bethlehem\", several \"Mary's Milkdrops\" plants, and the \"Mother Love\" Impatiens, named from its constancy of bloom.\n\nAlso, \"Lent Lily\", \"Penitent's Rose\", \"Passion Flower\", \"Crown of Thorns\", \"Christ's Back\", \"Christ's Knee\", \"Christ's Blood Drops\", \"Tree of the Cross\", the tiny pendant flowers of numerous \"Our Lady's Tears\" plants for Mary's weeping at the foot of the Cross, \"Mary's Sword of sorrow.\"\n\nAnd, \"Pentecost Rose\" of the descending flames of the Holy Spirit, white \"Assumption Lily\", \"Mary's Gold\" of her heavenly glory and the glory of her appearances on earth, \"Mary's Crown\", \"Christ's Eye\", \"Sweet Mary\" of her heavenly sweetness, the wild orchid of \"Mary's Hand of Pity\", \"Mary's Balm\" and other fragrant healing herbs of her spiritual comfort, \"Our Lady's Keys\" of her mediational access to the storehouses of heavenly grace, \"Ladder to Heaven\", \"Heavenly Way\", and so many others.\n\nSince many graces and spiritual illuminations have been received through the years as hearts have been raised to prayer while beholding the symbolical Flowers of Our Lady, and since Mary is immediately present by her action as Mediatrix of All Grace, wherever grace is distributed, the gift of a sense of her presence has been experienced by many in garden and countryside. As a consequence many flowers resembling the human form have come to be named as symbols of Mary's presence: \"Mary\", \"The Virgin\", \"Mary's Face\", \"Our Lady by-the-Gate\", \"Our Lady in the Corn\", \"Our Lady of the Meadow\", \"Our Lady of the Lake\", \"Beautiful Lady\"; along with indirect symbols of her presence such as the leaves of \"Our Lady's Thumb\" (prints), \"Our Lady's Bite\" (marks), etc.\n\nThose Flowers of Our Lady planted in the Garden are listed in the Visitor's Guide, revised from time to time as the planting is enhanced, and available in the pole-mounted \"wayside\" wooden shelter at the Garden and in the church pamphlet rack.\n\nLiturgically blest through a ritual of the Roman Rite, the Mary Garden focal statue, Mary of Nazareth, and its surrounding Flowers of Our Lady are holy objects which are vehicles, especially to those so disposed, of blessings from the merits of Christ and the Church, opening minds and elevating thoughts in religious reflection.\n\nJohn S. Stokes Jr.\n\nCopyright, Mary's Gardens 1992\n\nTop\n\nPLANT LIST AND PLANTING PLAN\n\nFull text pdf\n\nTop\n\nDEDICATION AND BLESSING\n\nParish Dedication and Blessing, September 8, 1991 - Background\n\nThe Annapolis Mary Garden, developed from an original plan by renowned horticulturalist Tony Dove, then Curator of the London Tower Public Gardens in Edgewater, Maryland, was originally dedicated and blest on the Vigil of the Assumption, 1988.\n\nToday's dedication of the newly installed focal Garden sculpture of Mary of Nazareth - a major work especially designed for this garden by renowned sculptor, Leo Irrera, in residence at the Pius VI Religious Art Center in Washington, D.C. - is a fulfillment of the hopes and prayers of the parishioners who have founded the Mary Garden, and brings it to a national and international stature.\n\nBringing the visitor to reflection on Mary and Jesus, as they were in the Nazareth countryside, the statue quickens hearts and minds to meditation on the rich symbolism of the Flowers of Our Lady in the beds around it - as we pray in the words of the Blessing of Images from the Roman Rite:\n\n\"Almighty and eternal God . . . as often as we look on this image with our bodily eyes, so often do we consider the actions of your saints with our mind's eye, and ponder their sanctity for our imitation. Be so good, we beg of you, to bless and sanctify this statue . . . that whoever in the presence of this image humbly pays devout reverence and honor to your only-begotten Son and his Blessed Mother, may through their merits and intercession win grace in this life, and everlasting glory in the world to come. . . .\"\n\nToday, the Feast of Mary's Birth, is the traditional day also for the Roman Rite Blessing of Seeds, Flowers and Crops for the coming year. Through it we renew the blessing of the entire Garden as a holy place:\n\n\"Almighty, everlasting God, sower and nourisher of the heavenly Word, you till the ground of our hearts with spiritual tools. Hear our prayers, please, and pour your blessings upon the fields that have been sown . . .\"\n\nThrough these blessings of the Church we are assisted in re-entering the piety of the medieval Christians, for whom all areas of life were transformed for the sanctification of souls and the building of God's Kingdom.\n\nWith the installation of Mary of Nazareth, the Mary Garden and the work of its tending have been especially dedicated to peace in the Holy Land, in our own country and throughout the entire world.\n\nThe turning of our thoughts to Nazareth reminds us that rural Nazareth, in which Mary and Jesus lived as the New Eve and the New Adam, became in effect the New Garden of Eden, according to the lines from the liturgy for today's feast of the Nativity of Mary:\n\n\"When the most holy Virgin was born,\n\nthe whole world was made radiant.\"\n\nIt is this illuminative view of nature which is the basis for the transforming symbolism of the Flowers of Our Lady of the Mary Garden.\n\nTop\n\nSt. Mary's Parish Annapolis, Maryland\n\nVISITORS' GUIDE\n\nThe religious names of the symbolical Flowers of Our Lady in St. Mary's Parish Mary Garden are displayed, together with their more familiar common names, on hand-crafted wooden markers at each flower group.\n\nThis guide provides a full list of these names, together with the scientific botanical name for each species, and a numerical key indicating the location for each in the accompanying plan of the Garden.\n\nThe numbers have been assigned in the general sequence in which you come upon the groups as you enter the Garden, from the parking lot, by the southeast corner of St. Mary's Church, and proceed through it in clockwise manner, returning to the point where you entered.\n\nMost of the flowers indicated on the plan are biennial or perennial flowers of limited bloom duration - some spring, some summer and some fall. For Garden color through the year, selected annual flowers, as indicated, have been planted throughout the garden, as well as at the locations indicated by marker and by plan identifying number.\n\nAs you walk through the Garden, identifying the flowers and plants by their names, view the symbolical form and color of each imaginatively as it might have been seen by the faithful of the medieval countrysides: as a distillation of the quality of a mystery, virtue, event or article of reverence.\n\nThen, take the list with you and in moments of recollection let your imagination range over all the flowers in it, rejoicing and giving thanks for their contribution to the the richness of the popular religious traditions supporting our faith.\n\nAnd, in your daily life, as you encounter flowers - in field and roadside, gardens, window boxes, bouquets, florist's shops and shopping malls:\n\n\"Look on the flower, think of Mary\"\n\nPlanting Plan\n\nPlant List\n\nSome Reflections\n\nMary's Rose. In beholding the red color of this flower, we recall that Mary is the beautiful Mystical Rose in God's garden of souls, whom he created and blessed to be the Mother of his Divine Son, Savior of the world. We pray to Mary that our souls, too, may bud forth as the rose, praising God in love.\n\nOur Lady's Pincushion. As we look at the flower pins in their foliage cushions, we think of Our Lady's wonder and joy as she sewed garments for the Divine Redeemer she was to bear. Like Mary, we offer all our work and thoughts to God.\n\nOur Lady's Mantle. We raise our thoughts from the blue of Our Lady's Mantle to the spiritual mantle with which Mary, Mother of the all-powerful God, and our Heavenly Mother also, mercifully protects all who turn to her for her perpetual help. We beseech her protection from all dangers.\n\nOur Lady's Delight. Like Mary, we take delight in flowers as God's riches and artistry, showing forth the beauty of heaven on earth. We take heart that with Our Lady's merciful intercession and mediation we will see God's beauty face to face in heaven.\n\nPhoto: Vincenzina Krymow\n\nCopyright, Mary's Gardens 1992\n\nTop\n\nGARDEN TOUR\n\nMary Garden, Annapolis, Maryland\n\nDedicated on Mary's birthday, September 8, 1988, the Mary Garden in Annapolis, Maryland, is located behind St. Mary's Church, in the quadrangle formed by the church, the rectory and the historic John Carroll House. St. Mary's Church, on narrow Duke of Gloucester Street in the heart of old Annapolis, stands on the site of the first private Catholic chapel in Maryland, built in 1822 by Charles Carroll.\n\nA Visit to the garden\n\nRed brick steps and a brick walk lead to the Mary Garden from the parking lot in the rear of the church. The walk, along the left side of the garden, leads to the Mary of Nazareth statue at the end of the garden.\n\nThe very old crepe myrtle tree, hundred year old boxwood circle and the surrounding red brick walls of the church, rectory and Carroll House all help to give this garden the appearance of being much older than it is. In front of the boxwood circle a wooden information box tells us of the plants growing here and their Mary names.\n\nTo the right, bright yellow Stella Dpro day lilies remind us of St Joseph's faithfulness; behind them we see the Lord's Candle (yucca). Continuing to the right clusters of weeping lantana flowers call to mind the Sorrowful Face of Mary.\n\nNext we see St. Joseph's staff (hollyhock), and more day lilies. Later in the season the Virgin¹s flowers (zinnias) and Mary's Flower (shasta daisies) will bloom and Mary's Shawl (Russian sage) will blanket the area. We feel Mary's presence as we enjoy her flowers.\n\nOn our immediate left as we enter we see the Rosary, where a variety of rose bushes (Her Flower) have been planted. The Hail Mary's of salvia echo our own. Climbing roses adorn an arbor in the middle of this space and manger bed straw (creeping thyme ) forms a border. We remember that roses, as well as lilies, grew in Mary's time and that roses have long been associated with Mary.\n\nA walk leading to the church building separates the Rosary from the herb garden, which ends at another walkway, this one to the chapel where there is perpetual adoration. An angel watches over the Herb of Grace (rue) and other herbs, planted in a geometric design. We associate rue with regret, sorrow and pain and think of Mary's heartache and her anguish. Here we see manger bedstraw, Our Lady's Pincushion (sweet scabious), Our Lord's Back (yarrow) and stroke Our Lady's Fingers (lamb's ears).\n\nBeyond the path to the chapel, in an area called Mary's Garden, we sing Our Lady's Praises with the petunias as we contemplate Mary's apple tree (Lady Apple), the Gentle Virgin (pink geranium ) and Virgin's Bower (pink clematis). A recently installed marble fresco of two angels guarding the Eucharist looks down from the low brick wall to the left.\n\nTo the right tulips proclaim Mary's Prayers and pansies tell us of Our Lady's Delight. Here the Blue Lenten Flower (squill), Lenten Rose (helleborus) and a dogwood tree (The Cross) remind us of Mary's sorrow at the end of Jesus' life on earth. Along the edge we find the Crown of Thorns of barberry.\n\nThe garden opens up now into a wide grassy path leading to the statue of Mary and Jesus. In a large area on the left a very old crepe myrtle tree (Her Virginity) presides over Madonna lilies and Our Lady's Rose (peony). The Ave Maria sings out from beautiful hydrangea, some of it in a large pot. Lady fern, myrtle ground cover and Bishop's Weed ground cover (aegopodium) are luxurious here.\n\nIn this area, along a wrought iron railing, we see Where God Has Walked (ground ivy) and remember the Holy Family's Flight into Egypt (lavender). We can reflect on Joseph, the faithful companion, with the day lilies and Maiden Grass (Japanese plume grass) and enjoy Our Lady's Frills (primrose).\n\nLooking to the right we might meditate on Mary's Faith (veronica), the Trinity (Japanese iris) or Mary at the Cross (Cross wort, loosestrife). Phlox reminds us of Our Lady's Wedding, and we see the Virgin's glove (foxglove), Our Lady's Frills and Maiden Hair (sedum).\n\nFurther to the right, in the center of the garden, is a circle of 100-year-old Candlemas greens (boxwood). Inside the circle school children plant their own garden each spring, each child naming her plant for her mother.\n\nStraight ahead now is the four foot Mary of Nazareth statue, sculpted from polished Vermont granite. Mary stands with one arm around Jesus, who looks up at her. Her expression is one of love and concern and she holds his hand protectively.\n\nThree heart-shaped basins at the base of the statue form a circulating pool. We see Mary's Eyes (forget-me-not) in front of the statue and know that she loves us as she loved Jesus.\n\nTwo crepe myrtle trees (Her Virginity) and Mary's Berry tree (hawthorn) shade this area. The hawthorn tree was a gift of the parish kindergarten class of 1988. To the right of the statue Our Lady's Tears (lily of the valley) and Mary's Sword of Sorrow (iris) remind us of the sadness in Mary's life, while the Assumption Lily (hosta) and Heavenly Bamboo (nandina) tell us that Mary is in heaven. Seeing Our Lady's Roses (peonies) we share her joy.\n\nOn the rectory wall behind the fountain is a bronze plaque with names of those who contributed significantly to the garden. Nan Sears points out that her parents, who loved flowers and Mary, are listed first, while she and her husband are listed last. Among the names are those of Mary Garden advocates John Stokes, Bonnie Robertson and Edward McTeaghe, the latter two remembered with a gift from Stokes.\n\nMoving to the right and along the right side of the garden, back towards the beginning, we find the Tree of the Cross ( yew), Silver Archangel (lamium) and Mary¹s Star (daffodils). Now we come to the shade garden, a large area that brings us back to the front of the garden. Here we see Where God Has Walked (ivy) under a linden tree. We find also Lady of the Snows (viburnum), Mary's Star and St. Joseph's Plant (azalea).\n\nSt. Justin the Martyr, who was beheaded sometime between 308-314 AD, is buried at the end of the garden. It is said that one of the Redemptorist fathers dug him up and brought him here in 1873 to save his remains from sacrilege or destruction. The bones were found in a church safe in 1987 and buried in the garden after the Vatican said \"hey had enough saints and his bones could stay here\".\n\nIt should be noted that in this Mary Garden, not all of the plants are named after Mary but all have religious symbolism. A few of the plants were given Mary names by the garden's creators, consistent with the medieval practice of naming flowers.\n\nDevelopment of the garden\n\nA garden club lecturer from Virginia first told Nan Sears about Mary Gardens in 1945. Having grown up with a family who loved the woods and the wilds, Nan often thought of Mary when she was outdoors. \"I feel she is there, a part of everything beautiful in the outdoors\", she said. She decided she wanted a Mary Garden as a tribute to her to and to be closer to her.\n\nShe immediately established a Mary Garden at home and always had one, wherever she lived, often improvising to create a shrine for Mary. One year she chiseled a hollow in the middle of a large lava rock left over from a garden show and pressed a plastic profile of the Madonna cradling the Infant Jesus into the recess. An annual 'soft paint' job disguised the plastic.\n\nThe rock was snuggled in Lady Fern and canopied with an overhang of Mary's Heart (bleeding heart). Our Lady's Delight (pansies) and Our Lady's Earrings (impatiens) were nestled in front of the rock, interspersed with the light blue of Mary's Wedding Dress (phlox). Nan carried the tiny grotto with her when she moved and it is now the focal point of the Mary Garden in her front yard in Annapolis.\n\nIt was not until she moved to Annapolis and became a member of St. Mary's Church that she found a pastor interested in a Mary Garden. In 1987 she received permission from Father John Murray, pastor of St. Mary's Church, to turn \"a patch of weeds and gum wrappers behind the church\" into a tribute to Mary. \"Just don't ask me for any money\", the pastor told her.\n\nShe knew Tony Dove, curator of the gardens at London Town Public House in nearby Edgewater, from her volunteer work there. With his help and that of another volunteer, Laura Van Geffen, she designed and laid out the garden. Dove, his wife and several of her brothers donated and brought in tons of dirt for the garden.\n\nNan looked for a sculptor and found him at the Paul VI Religious Art Center in Washington, D.C. A statue of Mary and Jesus was commissioned and she and Laura set out to raise $35,000 to pay for the garden. The need was announced from the pulpit and as the masses ended, eager young children with wreaths of flowers on their heads stood at the entrances with baskets in hand. Generous friends and parishioners gave money to pay for plants and the statue. Benches were donated as memorials and many of the permanent planting were given \"in memory of ----.\"\n\nLeo Irrera's design for \"Mary of Nazareth\", showing Jesus when he was about nine or ten years of age, was sculpted from pink Vermont granite.\n\nOn September 8, 1988, the feast day of Mary's birth, Father Murray dedicated the garden. The statue was installed and blessed on Mary's birthday in 1991.\n\nIn 1994 the area inside the boxwood circle became a children's garden, designed and planted by fourth-graders. Children had been slipping into the boxwood circle and making it their own secret garden, so with the help of Kayla Lehmann, another Mary Garden volunteer, they made their own garden. A bird bath is in the center of the circle and a weeping angel (in sorrow over aborted babies) looks on. Child size benches encourage children to linger. The purpose of this garden is to encourage children to learn about Mary and honor her in their own way.\n\nVolunteers from the parish tend the Mary Garden, which keeps changing as they replace those planting that are not too successful, like the Stella Oro day lilies which replaced liriope. Nan Sears says she made up some of the Mary names, and figured it was OK since the medieval people had done the same thing.\n\nPrivate Mary Gardens\n\nNan Sears' Mary garden is in the front yard of her house. The lava rock which shelters Mary (a friend paints the plastic image for her every year), came from a garden show in Washington D.C. and is now in its third home - she moved it twice in Washington.\n\nAnn Duffy, another Mary Garden volunteer, has her personal Mary Garden behind her house. It is a small area with blue flowers - a sea of blue, she said. Lady's Tears (blue spiderwort) surround the statue and Our Lady's Mantle (blue morning glories) envelopes the pole holding the image of Mary. The Hail Mary of vibrant blue salvia and the lavender of Flight Into Egypt are also there, with Virgin Pink (pinks) and Our Lady's Fingers (lamb's ears) for contrast. Ann painted the face of Mary on wood, copying it from a holy card, and it is sheltered in an altar-like wooden box.\n\nPhotos and text by Vincenzina Krymow .

(She used to spend long hours sitting in the garden, reading, to explain its meaning to visitors.) This list is included with the enclosed article reprint, \"Paradise of Our Lady\".\n\nEdward McTague proposed the name \"Mary's Gardens\" for our work in 1951, after we noted that some medieval drawings of the Virgin and Child in enclosed gardens we so named; but we thought of a garden of Flowers of Our Lady as a \"Mary Garden\". We soon found that many persons referred to the Mary Garden as \"Mary's Garden\", in the sense that they sensed her presence there.\n\nReturning to your Caroll House Mary Garden - we hope that after having established it so devotedly and prudently, you are also giving some thought to its continity - which one would hope would be until the end of the world and time.\n\nSt. Louis de Montfort has discerned how true devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary is interior and tender, and that the outer forms and customs of devotion to Mary are properly expressions of this (otherwise becoming \"critical\", \"scrupulous\", \"interested\", \"inconstant\", \"hypocritical\" etc).. This has certainly proven to be true for the Mary Garden: that to continue through the years, every planted Mary Garden must have its continued sustenance in the interior Mary Garden of the heart.\n\nOur chosen means of first presenting the Mary Garden idea in 1951, inspired by Mrs. Lillie's Woods Hole Mary Garden, and with her blessing, was the 10- variety \"Our Lady's Garden\" mail-order seed kit, with introductory leaflet, and prayer card.\n\nThe leaflet, composed by Edward A. G. McTague, (of which I will send you a copy) began with words something like:\n\n\"Our Lady's Garden is first of all the package you receive of the postman.\n\n\"May it first bloom within your heart, and then, in due season, may its seeds bear flower and fruit in your gardens . . .\"\n\nLike faith in God, and in the Church, devotion to Mary is a gift. But these are gifts God wants to and does give to all who seek goodness, truth and beauty. \"Seek and you shall find\".\n\nThere are ever those who, seeking natural goodness and truth, learn of God through his loving acts of providence and grace; realize that a loving God would not leave us in religious uncertainty, and has therefore given us the Church - imperfect as it must be in worldly circumstances - as authoritative source of truth and moral law and as channel of grace; and will not leave us in doubt as to how to proceed with the work of building His Kingdom, but has given us Mary, implicitly in our simple faith in her, as ever-present mediatrix of the gratuitous discerning and prompting actual graces needed for our elections and actions.\n\nIt seems to me that the combined existence of those who already love Mary interiorly, and those who implicitly seek and will find God, Church and Mary, should enable us to perpetuate communities of persons with interior, tender Mary -Gardens of the Heart, to sustain our planted community Mary Gardens through the decades and centuries.\n\nAs Father Galvin mentions in his 1946 article, \"Lillie Tower\", Mrs. Lillie hoped that the right person would turn up to continue her work; but she also prudently established a trust fund to provide for garden care and replacement plants through the years (and for maintenance of the adjacent Angelus Tower given by her). After Mrs. Lillie became ill in the late 1930's or early 1940's (?), the garden, with the funds provided, was maintained by persons loyal to her, but with the ravages of several hurricanes and the absence for a time of a sustaining Garden of the Heart, the Garden planting was reduced to that of a conventional, yet attractive, summer garden of the area.\n\nThen, in 1981-1982, Jane McLaughlin, in doing research as parish historian for a History of St. Joseph's Church for the 1982 centennial year, uncovered historic documents about the founding of the Garden, and out of the love of the Garden in her heart undertook to restore it - according to the original planting plant developed by Mrs. Lillie with the help of landscape architect, Dorthea K. Harrison, over a five year period from 1933-1937. As the centennial year, 1982, was the golden jubilee of Mrs. Lillie's original founding of the Garden, herself, in 1932, the Garden Jubilee was celebrated along with the Church Centenial.\n\nIt would seem, then, from the experience at St. Joseph's, that care should be taken to sustain a public or institutional Mary Garden both by seeking successive generations of committed Mary-Gardeners, and by establishing some sort of fund, trust or endowment to provide for the cost of maintenance and replacement, and also of keeping constanyly available a supply of phamphlet and article-reprint give-aways - at the garden, if possible, and in the church phamphlet and library.\n\nI will supplement the few reprints enclosed with this letter, and hope you will be able to keep them together in a binder of some sort. You have our permission to make quantities of photo-copies of any of these reprints.\n\nAlso some regular parish liturgical events in the Garden each year - such as on the feasts of the Visitation, Assumption, Queenship and Rosary - with blessings, processions, floral crownings, or any other activities found appropriate - both enrich parish life and sustain interest in and appreciatoion of the Garden.\n\nYour mention of the duck nesting in a tree of your Mary Garden brings much joy, and is characteristic of the little providential surprises experienced in many Mary Gardens.\n\nIn my second residence Mary Garden a mother rabbit made her nest and gave birth to two babies under the thyme (sent me by Bonnie Roberson) in the center bed, nestled against the side of the focal statue pedestal.\n\n(I am reminded that Bonnie Roberson and I passed through your area when she visited me and picked up her exhibit plants nurtured for in Philadelphia and we drove down to Washington to set up her exhibit Mary Garden, on invitation, for the 1962 annual meeting of the Herb Society of America. I recall it was in mid-May, when the Solomon Seals (Our Lady's Lockets, Belfry, etc.) which she had not seen before were in bloom.)\n\nI also enclose a reprint of a 1955 article, \"In Mary's Garden\", describing the joys of parent and child working together in the Mary Garden, and illustrated by a photo of an actual nest some birds wove around the little figurine in a focal wayside shrine. At the time I sort of took these wonders in stride, with all the wonders of the Mary Garden, but looking back some 35 years later I am awed.\n\nOne of the special recurring joys to me of the Flowers of Our Lady through the years has been the unending first hand experience and intuitive recognition of the symbolical forms of new or old plants. My first experience of this was at the Garden of Our Lady in 1949 or 1950, as set forth in my enclosed article, \"Cape Cod Shrine Mary Garden\" (1955), but perhaps my most vivid memory is of first seeing in bloom \"Our Ladys's Pincushion\" (Armeria) and \"Our Lady's Tears\" (Tradescantia) at a local Philadelphia roadside nursery where Ed McTague and I were picking up perennial plants for our own first Mary Gardens, in May of 1951.\n\nI recall that when we mentioned to the aged life-time nurseryman- horticulturalist the Tradescantia symbolism, he said, \"Yes, she's crying all day.\"\n\nAnd each year there are new discoveries - sometimes as I go through old books of flower paintings, where I first see a plant from a different angle, which reveals a previously elusive symbolism. A recent instance is that of \"Our Lady's Crown\" (Centauria cyanis), which only when it (the wild, single-flowered variety) is seen from the side reveals the crown-like ring of tiny flowerets around the edge of the flowering head.\n\nHave there been any articles about your Mary Garden?\n\nOne aid in engendering new Mary-Gardeners is to have a library and file of books and articles relative to the Flowers of Our Lady and Mary Gardens, and to this end, I offer to provide additional reprints, rererences, etc.. We have provided extensive materials for the Woods Hole parish and historical society archives, including copies of pertinent correspondence, etc..\n\nAlso, don't forget to photograph the Mary Garden at various stages of development and bloom, and also activities and events in the Garden. Do you have any photos - preferably slides, but also prints - you could send me for our archives?\n\nWhen the statue has been installed, and good photos of the garden taken at the best periods of bloom, etc., I would like to consider the possibility of writing an illustrated article about you and the garden, as I did with Bonnie Roberson and Bro. Seán. In this connection, is there a definitive biography of Bishop Carroll, and are there archives of his papers which might contain Marian references?\n\nFinally, I would be interested in how you learned of the Flowers of Our Lady and Mary Gardens. Did you read an article? Did you write to us? (If so, we would have your letter(s) in our fairly complete files and archives, although it would require some digging to find them.)\n\nI can't tell you what a joy your letter and its news have been, especially in this holy season. I have been able to give little formal input to the work of Mary's Gardens during the past year, and its's wonderful to know that the work and movement go on. Jane McLaughlin is \"on location\" with the Woods Hole Garden, and Brother Sean is in regular contact with Knock (his superiors having assigned him to be principal of at a nearby school, in Ballinrobe).\n\nThis year Brother Seán has assisted in the design and planting of another national Irish Mary Garden on the grounds of Ballintubber Abbey, which dates from the 13th century. He writes, \"A garden in the shape of a map of Ireland is one of the attractive features and wild plants from most of nthe 32 counties - all associated with Our Lady - are in it.\"\n\nI have tried to remain what Ed McTague described as a \"pure source\" for Mary Garden information and historical perspective - following up with persons Jane and Bother Seán refer to me or bring to my attention. A marvellous Parish Mary Garden was recently planted in Australia, for the Marian Year, inspired by the Garden at Knock and Brother Seán's booklet.\n\nI look forward to being of any assistance to you I can, and to keeping in touch.\n\nSincerely.\n\nJohn Stokes\n\nBack\n\nBoston, MA\n\nApril 24, 1990\n\nDear Nan,\n\nOn the 20th I sent you a number of additional article reprints and instructional materials hastily assembled from a temporary file in Boston (our permanant files are in Woods Hole).\n\nI did not have time to cross out the various former addresses and \"ads\" included with these, so please disregard them - and opaque them out before making any photo copies for distribution to parishioners, visitors, correspondents, etc..\n\nOur initial approach to reach as many people as possible with the Mary Garden idea was to distribute the appeal-to-the-heart \"Our Lady's Garden\" seed kits, leaflets and prayer cards through the placement of little 1\" ads in national Catholic publications; and then, as articles were published, to include ads, and literature and starting materials lists on reprints which we sent out in reponse to inquiries. After four or five years we stopped advertising in the media and after fifteen discontinued all sales of of statuary etc.. The ads were of course paid for by contributions, but they were worth it because they brought in all sorts of wonderful people to us (such as Daniel J. Foley, former Editor of HORTICULTURE). Also, the act of placing the ads was an act and a commitment which were something for writers to write about - bringing us more inquiries. One article in the 1952 Catholic Digest, printed in 7(?) languages, brought us two thousand inquiries on a world-wide basis, including one, for example, from a Bishop in the Philippines who set up a 1954 Marian Year Mary Garden planting competition in some 30 schools in his diocese, for which he awarded a Bishop's Trophy. Also a Jesuit astronomer from a Manilla observatory, etc..\n\nEd McTague and I had a number of volunteers from our parishes to help us with all the work - for which we, of course, took primary resonsibility. Then, in 1965, when Ed McTague was ill, and I took on other obligations, such as accepting an offer to head up a Philadelphia area ecumenical organization ( \"Wellsprings\") being set up in the era of the Second Vatican Council, Bonnie Roberson, of Hagerman, Idaho, offered to assume primary responsibility for answering our correspondence, assisting others start Mary Gardens etc. - so we changed our address to Hagerman. Ed McTague died in 1972; Brother Seán joined us in 1973; I rejoined Bonnie actively in 1980; Jane McLaughlin began assisting people who inquired through Woods Hole in 1982, as well as writing chapers on the Woods Hole Garden of Our Lady in two beautiful books; and Bonnie died in 1983 (after seeing her dreams come true with the Woods Hole centennial/jubilee in 1982 and the founding of the Knock Mary Garden in 1983).\n\nThis is just to give you a little background and perspective, since you have made such a beautiful commitment to this work. Please feel free to put your own Mary Garden address on any literature copies you make or any original literature. Or you can use the Woods Hole address on the reprints if you don't want to use your own: Mary's Gardens, St. Joseph's Church, Box 3, Woods Hole, MA 02543.\n\n\"Mary's Gardens\" was registered to \"do business\" under the Pennsylvania fictitious names act in 1951, but has been an informal association of those accepting its historical self-definition and purposes and, and willing to make a commitment to continue its work, until it, hopefully, becomes an established part of world Catholic culture. It has no books of accounts, etc., and any gifts where tax-deductability is desired are given to churches or shrines which may have Mary Gardens.\n\nI hope you will be of any direct assistance you can in helping others start Mary Gardens who my be inspired by the Bishop Carroll Mary Garden; but if this is asking too much, please refer any inquirers to Woods Hole, where they will be referred to Jane McLaughlin or myself.\n\nFor my own part, I hope to publish one or more books one day, God willing, and also a CD-ROM. I have the materials, and my wife and I have the desktop publishing proficiency, so its a matter of finding and making the necessary time, under God's providence. In any case we have the articles and other printed materials to perpetuate the work; and now Knock and Carroll House, as well as Woods Hole, to give focus to the grass-roots movement - the scope of which we have no way of accessing. We cast out the seed, and have no way of knowing what kind of ground it falls upon - until we receive wonderful letters such as from Bonnie Roberson, Brother Seán and, now, you.\n\nWith renewed expressions of joy over your Mary-Garden love and initiative, and with all best wishes for the spiritual fruition of your work and Garden, I remain,\n\nSincerely,\n\nP.S. I found my copy of \"MARY, U.S.A.\" with all its rich references to Bishop Carroll's recourse to Mary for the success of his undertakings. J.\n\nBoston, MA\n\nApril 24 1990\n\nDear Nan,\n\nIf the Irrera sculpture has not yet been named, may I suggest \"Our Lady of Nazareth\"?\n\nIn the Garden this figure will bring to mind the flowers encountered or used by Mary and Jesus in Nazareth in the course of their daily lives - as they found them growing in wayside and countryside, or perhaps cultivated them around their dwelling or garden plot.\n\nThere are a number of flowers which bear names suggesting such a direct, rather than symbolic, relationship with Mary: Mary's Flower, Mary's Bouquet, Mary-Loves, Our Lady' Duster, Our Lady's Little Vine, Our Lady's Sprig, Mary's Nosegay, Virgin's Bower, Our Lady's Flavoring, Mary's Mint, Our Lady's Garleek, Our Lady's Pear, Mary's Sage, Our Lady's Duster, Our Lady's Tuft, Mary's Flower of God, Our Lady's Delight, Our Lady's Posies, Mary's Drying Plant, etc.\n\nReflection on the direct relationship of Our Lady with specific flowers and herbs, as suggested by these names, leads us to a consideration of her relationship with flowers as such, in terms of the overall sweep of sacred history.\n\nIn this we appreciate the special sacramentality flowers and all nature must have had for Mary in quickening her praise and worship of God, and as channelsand instruments for her fullness of grace.\n\nLiving prior to the establishment of the Eucharist and the other sacraments of the Church to establish special channels of grace for a redeemed yet sinful world, Mary, through her Immaculate Conception and freedom from sin, when she beheld the purity and beauty of flowers, lived, as it were in Eden, as the New Eve for whom flowers and all nature were utterly transparent revelations of God's glory and perfect instruments of his grace, for his praise and magnification and for her spiritual growth in this - as set forth in scripture:\n\n\"The heavens declare the glory of God,\n\nand the firmament proclaims his handiwork.\n\nDay pours out the word by day,\n\nand night to night imparts knowledge;\n\nNot a word nor a discourse\n\nwhose voice is not heard;\n\nThrough all the earth their voice resounds\n\nand to the ends of the world, their message.\"\n\n(Ps. 19: 1-5)\n\n\"Send forth flowers as the Lily,\n\nand yield a fragrance,\n\nAnd bring forth leaves in grace,\n\nand praise with canticles,\n\nAnd bless the Lord in his works.\"\n\n( )\n\n\"I am a flower of the field,\n\na lily of the valley.\n\n\"As a lily among thorns,\n\nso is my beloved among women.\"\n\n(Cant. 2: 1,2)\n\n\"Like a cedar on Lebanon\n\nI am raised aloft...\n\nLike cinnamon, or fragrant balm or precious myrrh,\n\nI give forth perfume...\n\nI bud forth delights like the vine,\n\nmy blossoms become fruit fair and rich.\n\nCome to me, all you that yearn for me,\n\nand be filled with my fruits.\"\n\n(Sirach 24: 14-18)\n\nWe can envisage that Mary was infused with grace as she meditated on scripture and performed acts of love, duty and worship, and also as she beheld nature and especially the beauty and purity of flowers, in the light pf scripture - so that flowers can be regarded as integral to Mary's filling with grace to fullness, and are therefore of special association with her for this reason.\n\nThe application to Mary by the Church Fathers and early liturgists of flower titles and imagery from the Old Testament were not just poetic refinements, but an intuitive perception of her spiritual formation, as \"Flower of flowers\" and \"Mystical Rose\", through these flower passages from scripture, and directly from nature as illuminated by them.\n\nIf the Canticle of Canticles could be of such profound inspiration for St. Bernard's \"Sermons\" and St. John of the Cross's \"Spiritual Canticle\", how much more profoundly must they have served for the spiritual formation of Immaculate Mary!\n\nOr, considered theologically, from the prologue to the John Gospel: since all things were made through the Divine Word, and the Word was then made flesh in Jesus, there are consequently inherent correspondences between all the excellences of Christ and all the goodness, beauty and truth of Creation.\n\nFor every goodness of nature there is a corresponding human virtue of Christ, and for every virtue of Christ there is a corresponding goodness of nature - which is, after all, the basis of religious figures, parables and symbolism, and of poetic imagery, finding human and divine values in nature.\n\nThus, just as Mary was immaculately conceived, and preserved from sin, through graces of Christ's redemption preceding and anticipating his sacrificial death on the Cross, so, too, by this immaculateness and its graces Mary was enabled to assimilate, in anticipation, from the goodness of nature, in the light of revealed scripture, the corresponding virtues of the Word made flesh - both as a sharing from God, and as the means whereby she might maternally nurture them in Jesus for his growth \"in wisdom and grace\".\n\nThis gives still another meaning for the \"Mary Garden\", or \"Mary's Garden\" - as reminder of how Mary herself saw nature and flowers as instruments of God's praise and channels of his grace; and of how she opened her heart and soul to grace by opening them to nature and flowers.\n\nReflection on \"The Flowers of Our Lady\" in Nazareth assists us in attuning ourselves likewise to the Divine praise and grace through flowers, in imitation of Mary - with the added consideration that Mary, now elevated as Mediatrix of all Grace, is for us herself the distributive channel for the grace of blest flowers.\n\nIn this we are also assisted by the example of the \"flower saints\" - ultimately imitative of Mary - SS. Joseph, Francis, Patrick, Fiacre, Bernard, Frances de Sales, John of the Cross, Louis de Montfort, Theresa, etc. - as invoked in the \"Mary Garden Prayer\".\n\nFlowers - after Jesus' redemptive life, death, resurrection and ascension; followed by the re-creating Pentacostal descent of the Holy Spirit - became transparent also, in the popular religious traditions of the medieval countrysides, of the light, grace, truth and power of our Redemption, as evidenced by the many-faceted array of the symbolic Flowers of Our Lady, mirroring her life and mysteries - as universally celebrated in the mysteries of the Rosary.\n\nWhile flowers, in their tranparency are first of all symbolic of the human virtues and graces of Jesus, the God-Man, it would appear that in popular usage they became especially associated with Mary out of an appreciation that in her God fulfilled his desire to share, as well as to show forth, humanly, his goodness - including his redemptive goodness.\n\nThe divine attributes pre-eminently shown forth in the light, graces and glories of the human nature of the God-man, Jesus, were also shared and shown forth - through her immaculate fullness of grace, and her fiat - by his mother, Mary, \"our tainted nature's solitary boast\". And as God created human persons \"male and female\", the divine attributes, both male and female, were given their full human showing forth in Jesus and Mary considered together, so to speak.\n\nIt is indeed Mary's participation in and sharing, as human person, of the attributes of the divine/human person, Jesus, which most fully culminated God's desire to share as well as show forth his goodness. Thus, Mary is the hope of our own sharing also in the divine goodness - as witnessed by the lives of the saints - and it is this which is contained in the mysteries of the Rosary and of the Flowers of Our Lady.\n\nEven more sublimely, God shared his virtues and graces with Mary not only in general, but also so she could be, in particular, the fit nurturing as well as biological mother of his Divine Son - thus also sharing, as Mother of God, in \"his/her\" divine procreativity.\n\nA Mary Garden of Flowers of Our Lady thus proclaims the wonder of God's infused human sharing of his attributes. (I used to ponder, for example, the origin of the name \"Virgin Flower\", for periwinkle, which was probably more immediately from its use in paintings of Our Lady surrounded by the flower symbols of her attributes, or perhaps because it was one of the early-blooming blue flowers. I have now come to regard the permeation of its petals with the color blue as symbolic of Mary's infused fullness of grace.)\n\nThese profound truths will be beautifully presented by your sculpture of the boy Jesus and Mary in the setting of the Flowers of Our Lady - which, as I have mentioned, prompts (at least for me) a view of the Flowers of Our Lady which is specifically relational as well as attributive. A most inspired selection of a sculptural subject for your Garden!\n\nI thank you ever more for your gift of the sculpture model casting, which has prompted the above spontaneous thoughts - pulling together a number of insights previously incomplete (serving also as \"inspirational research\" for a hoped for article about your sculpture and garden, in due time).\n\nAs I expressed the hope previously, we are now in a position to make a further contribution towards the garden sculpture, which is to be in memorium of Edward A. G. McTague and Bonnie Roberson (U.S. Mary Garden pioneers) - per the enclosed checks. No need to make specific mention of these memorial contributions as from us - just the simple listing of our own previous joint personal gift, as you indicated.\n\nAlso enclosed is a printout of a grey scale computer scan of a little 3 x 3 polaroid snapshot taken of the model casting, which was made to \"take the statue with us\" in our travels. Mindful of copyright considerations and also your coming formal unveiling, we are keeping the model and any photos confidential for our private priveleged use and edification until the final figure is made public.\n\nWith prayers to St. Rose of Lima, \"to whom the boy, Jesus, and his Mother were present in the garden\", for the magnificent fruition of your Mary Garden, I remain, as ever,\n\nSincerely,\n\nBoston, MA\n\nApril 24 1990\n\nAssumption\n\nDear Nan,\n\nIn several days I will be catching up with my Boston mail, and I hope to find among it communications from you and Brother Seán. This routing of communications has its delays, but it's better than trying to receive mail during our travels.\n\nI sent you a Fedex letter containing two further contribution checks on Aug 7, which they inform me was received for you on Aug 9 by W. Gibson. (I hope this means you have been able to get in some vacationing.)\n\nI would like to share with you some further thoughts which have been flowing from the stimulation of the sculpture model.\n\nChesterton wrote that for him becoming a Catholic was like sitting down to breakfast every morning with Shakespeare. Ed, Bonnie and I found it to be the same with our Mary's Gardens work. No matter how much we ranged over things, each day always brought some new insight, information or contact.\n\nFrom the beginning, I always sought an understanding as to why the recorded Christian symbolism of flowers, of popular religious tradition, was predominantly referred to Mary, rather than to Jesus, who, as divine/human person, as the Divine Word Incarnate, must most perfectly have embodied the diversity of divine goodness shown forth all the things of nature, created through the same Divine Word.\n\nAbout the best explanation of this I had found previously was the Nicolas passage from \"La Vierge Marie...\" quoted (in translation) in my \"Jubilee 2\" article (QUEEN, Jul-Aug '82, p. 37), of which I sent you a copy, which gave as the \"justification\" of this that Mary,\n\n\"(Mary) as the image most closely conformed to her divine Son (was), through the grace of this correspondence, a moral type surpassing all creatures . . . (giving) her also a symbolical claim to nature which justifies and consecrates all the figures which the Church has applied to her . . .\"\n\nIt was only while writing you on August 7th that it became clear to me that all Mary's perfections - equivalent through her immaculate purity, fullness of grace and overshadowing by the Holy Spirit to those of divine/human Jesus - received special popular veneration and celebration for them because they testified to the utter fulfillment of the Creator's desire to share his goodness directly with us, as finite human creatures, as well as to show it forth to us in the Divine Word Incarnate.\n\nAll the virtues and excellences which were Christ's by divine nature were Mary's through her fullness of infused divine light, grace, word and power - from her immaculate purity, humility, openness, responsiveness and preservation and from her utter correspondence to divine overshadowing, providence and governance.\n\no O o\n\nThen, with respect to Mary's personal perception of and spiritual enrichment through flowers, I appreciated from the start the application to her by the Church Fathers and early liturgists of the Old Testament flower, garden and nature figures - particularly from the Sapiential Books. But I never actually stood there with her, so to speak, in Nazareth, as she beheld flowers in the light of the Scriptures. The Irerra sculpure prompted me to do this.\n\nIn his Spiritual Exercises, St. Ignatius of Loyola repeatedly summons us to actually visualize imaginatively events, situations and circumstances from Scripture, as a means of opening ourselves to the impact of their full significance and meaning. Thus, if we imaginatively place ourselves with Mary, and reflect on this, we may see things missed in the scholarly analysis of texts. The Irerra sculpure does this in a special way for nature and flowers - because, as I wrote, it directs our attention not so much to the Virgin and Child, Madonna Enthroned, Our Lady of Grace, etc. (all equally fruitful to meditation, each in its own way) but to Mary and the Child Jesus present in the Nazareth outdoors.\n\nWhat is important here - deriving also from the correspondences, through the creating and incarnate Divine Word - between human nature and all of Creation, is our ability, especially in the light of Scripture, to be quickened and illuminated and formed in our interior subtle spiritial growth of heart, mind and soul by the experience (or imagining) of facets of the goodness, truth and beauty of nature which correspond to them.\n\nPlacing ourselves, thus, in our imagination, with Mary before the flowers of Nazareth we can, from our own experience, envisage that, starting with the words of Scripture, she had an illuminative experience of the blooming of the rose to the sun as the opening of her soul to the warmth of God's love; or of a glance into the interior of the white lily, from petals to apex, as the drawing of the soul from earth to heaven by the divine light, etc..\n\nIn this connetion, in writing my August 7th letter I had immediately at hand the \"Send forth flowers as the lily . . .\" passage only as it appeared in the (pre-Vatican II) Breviary for the Feast of the Rosary (Douay translation). I have now had a chance to look it up in the New American Bible, where Ecclesiasticus becomes Sirach, and verse numbers are changed etc.:\n\n\"Open up your petals,\n\nlike roses planted near running waters,\n\nSend up the sweet odor of incense,\n\nbreak forth in blossoms like the lily.\n\nSend up the sweet odor of your hymn of praise;\n\nbless the LORD for all he has done!\n\nSirach 39:13-14\n\nFor us, as for Mary, such a turning to nature and flowers for supports for spiritual growth in knowledge, love, experience and service of God arises from our soul yearning, implanted in our nature and enhanced by grace, which prompts us - in the confidence of \"seek and you shall find\" - to ponder the forms of nature for such support.\n\nAnd for us, our accompanying yearning to know Mary better, that we may love her more (and if we are consecrated to her, to serve her better moves us to seek nature forms and symbols and illuminative insights through which we may contemplate and enter ever more fully into her life, mysteries, virtues, prerogatives and glories.\n\no O o\n\nAt this point, I think it well to note that whatever facet of the Flowers of Our Lady we may be examining, as here, it is always well to keep in mind that the profundity of the Flowers of Our Lady is that they may be lovingly seen by those interiorly devoted to Our Lady according to various mode of viewing things: symbolically, horticulturally, esthetically, dcoratively, ornamentally, meditatively, illuminatively, sacramentally, etc. - all of which are part of the whole, to be equally valued, and to be kept in mind in introducing new persons to the Mary Garden, so that they may embrace it according to their own inclination and perception. \"There is something for everybody\".\n\nAll flow from an interior devotion to Our Lady, which is \"the better part\", \"the one thing necessary\" to Mary Gardening, and to all expressions and practices of Marian devotion, ad of Christian devotion generally.\n\nIn this I am reminded of an ecumenical conference I attended back in the 60's on \"Public and Private Prayer\" - in which one of the principal participants was Father Damasus Winzen, O.S.B., Prior of Mt. Savior Monastery in Elmira, N.Y., from whom I learned a lot. While many endeavored to diminish the importance of private prayer on the grounds that it was subjective and lacked the test of the centuries, etc., Fr. Damasus and others pointed out that that private, \"non-liturgical\", devotion, prayer and meditation were indispensible supports for the vitality of public prayers and liturgy. One only has to recall the widepread use of the Imitation, Books of Hours, and other devotional treatises in the medieval period; and it is this sort of \"private\" spiritual vitilization that can come and is coming today from the Mary Garden.\n\nInterestingly, a number of the famous Books of Hours contain title pages for each of the Hours composed of a miniature painting of a scene illustrating it, paintings of symbolical flowers illuminating it, and the first lines of the associated spriptural passage. And today it is widely feasible horticulturally, as it was not then, to grow Mary Gardens of these symbolical flowers.\n\no O o\n\nI would also like to share with you some further thoughts, prompted while pondering the loving glance between the boy Jesus and his Mother, as depicted in the sculpture.\n\nSt. Augustine observed how inadequate was the attempt to find an illuminative correspondence to the Trinity in nature. Today, however, we have the supplementary correspondences from natural science, which, in its processes, as Nicolas points out:\n\n\"profoundly reflects Jesus Christ and his mysteries. Indeed it soars even higher than nature, pushes farther ahead in its secrets, and arrives, as though by the formulas of a transcendental and divine alphabet, at marvellous illuminations which associate it with the visions of angels, and anticipate some of the answers that are reserved for us by eternity.\"\n\nSuch a scientific process is that of the laser, as I discovered one day, some years ago, while visiting the Boston Museum of Science. While I was attending a demonstration of a workbench 6 ft. laser device, cut away so you could see the interior, it was explained by a staff lecturer how the light originating from a source within the laser was increasingly intensified as it was reflected back and forth between two mirrors at either end, until it burst forth as an intense laser beam through an aperture in one of the mirrors.\n\nI saw this as an illumiantive representation of how the love of the Father for the Son was mirrored back and forth between them in the fiery furnace of love of the Trinity, until it burst forth in the third Person of the Holy Spirit of Divine love.\n\nThis intensification and outpouring of love is mirrored in the loving glance between any two persons, and particularly that between the boy Jesus and his Mother - a \"laser\" generating grace which pours forth through the \"aperture\" of Mary, Mediatrix to the whole world, as I proposed in my letter to you immediately upon receiving the sculpture.\n\no O o\n\nI hope you are well, Nan, and that you are having a good summer. I am of course interested in the progress of the full scale sculpture, which I am sure you are monitering and expediting closely. I am reminded of the late '50's when we \"went into production\" with castings of the Seat of Wisdom and St. Joseph, Garden Workman sculptures we commissioned from Ade Bethune. So many details - and disappointments as well as joys. I assume you will develop some sort of descriptive leaflet, for visitors, featuring the statue itself.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBoston, MA\n\nApril 24 1990\n\nMichaelmas\n\nDear Nan,\n\nI have been delayed in catching up with my mail, in which I will hope to he ar from you. However, these are the last few days of a period of six months or so in which I have been able to make time for the kind of recollection I like to put into my Mary's Gardens communications - so I want to get in one additional letter \"under the wire\" at this time.\n\nWell, I did have my hoped for journey through the magnificence of the fall colors. As with so many things in Mary's Gardens, it came unexpectedly. During a one-day business trip to north-central Ohio in mid September I drove through miles of some of the most magnificent goldenrod I have ever seen - both the density of bloom for each plant, and for the density of plants in the various roadside and field colonies. And this general background of goldenrod was interspersed with clumps of wild sunflower, white aster, late Queen Anne's Lace, chicory - and bog iris spears, in the moist roadside ditches. (Too early for purple asters.) The marvellous thing is that this is what you would see at this season just about anywhere in the temperate zone (I've had a similar experience in England and France in September), and it makes one feel immediately spiritually at home in a completely new countrysude, through the familiar beloved plants and their symbolism.\n\nFrom the air it looked like a giant patchwork quilt with numerous golden squares and \"threads\" - the whole earth transfigured - reminiscent of the fields of red loostrife, Lythrum, \"Gods's Blood\" (or \"s'Blood\", per Shakespeare's epithet) you see from the air in August as you approach the Boston airport (and a magnificent planting I always look for from the highway as I drive past a field seve ral miles east of Morristown, New Jersey, near the old power lines).\n\n(Goldenrod is also illustrative of the need to double-check things in our research. I first jumped to the conclusion that the specific name of the European goldenrod, S. virgaurea, was latin for Virgin's Gold, only to find in checking that the latin, \"virg\", referred to something like branch (or \"rod\"), so that this was actually the latin for \"goldenrod\". The first actual Marian name I found for it was \"Mary's Plant\", and I forget at the moment if there were others. I have noticed that goldenrod first blooms in eastern Masachusetts, appropriately, close to August 1st, the Feast of the Transfiguration. When I first saw Solidago virgaurea close up in Kew Gardens, I noted that the flower heads were less dense than those with which I was familiar in the U.S., and that the tiny blooms seemed larger than those in the eastern U.S. - widely hybridized and generally considered to be derived predominantly from Solidago canadensis.)\n\nPart of our Ohio business involved a visit to a large rural property, where I found the same plants on location - from which I could feel the same pious and spiritually quickening uplift close-up, for my work and fellowship.\n\nI of course had very much in the back of my mind what I have been writing to you in my last several letters of my current insights on sacramental piety, so I was consciously alert to and self-examining regarding the uplift I was experiencing through this goldenrod environment.\n\n(In my recent letters, Nan, I have largely moved on from my earlier historical review of Mary's Gardens background and idea for you to current, \"real time\" , sharing of my ever-continuing ruminations on the various aspects of this work - so that much of what I am writing now is more tentative and developmental, as compared to my earlier letters, but equally integral to seeking a fuller understanding and sustaining the vitality of what we are dealing with. This is, after all a living tradition, which we are extending and hopefully enriching.)\n\nWhen Ed McTague and I first started this work in 1950-1951, the question of our ecclesiastical relations of course came up. At the outset we couldn't exactly go to the Philadelphia Chancery Office and request, \"Can we have your approval for this work?\" Even the author of a book has to write and submit the book before it can be reviewed for an Imprimateur. And at that time the idea was very nebulous and emerging, so we couldn't even fully define or describe it. So we decided to get underway and then deal with the matter of approval when we had something to show. And sure enough, when we ran our first local ad, we had a phone call from a priest on behalf of the Chancery Office, but now we had our seed kit and leaflet as something concrete to present.\n\nEd's visit from the Chancery office representative (Mary's Gardens was conducted for the first several years, from Ed's home, before he became ill and we moved things to my home) was most instructive to us. We were advised that since we were proposing to restore an established, documented popular religious cultural tradition, and weren't advocating anything essentially innovative, there was nothing \"objectionable\" to what we were doing; but on the other hand as the restoration and extension of this tradition were largely cultural it wasn't something requiring formal approval. However, we could have the assurance of official \"tolerance\" (or was it \"toleration\"?) as he put it, and could feel free to go ahead. We were counseled, however, to beware of any pious fraud (which never has been much of a problem, since most of the research has been secular, rather than religious - from the findings of botanists, folklorists and lexicographers).\n\nEd was able to tell him that the Woods Hole Garden of Our Lady had been blessed by the Bishop of Fall River, and that - as we learned, at the time of our joint visit, from Mrs. Frances Goffin, who lived in the house diagonally across the street - he used to visit with Mrs. Lillie, sitting and talking with her in the Garden (as later Bishop Trinan of Boise visited Bonnie in her Mary Garden - of which I have an audio tape she made with him).\n\n(I mention this because someone may ask you about the matter of approval.)\n\nThen, came our first general response from lay people. Happily there was much immediate pious acceptance from the heart, but we had one rather vehement response from a parish acquaintance, along the lines of: \"I don't need this! I have the Mass and Sacraments, and Devotions and Rosary, so why this? Don't bother me with it!\"\n\nThis was very instructive, because it did raise the question very directly, \"Why Mary's Gardens?\"\n\nContained in this question are the same fundamentals I have been dealing with currently, viz., the relationship between the Sacraments and Sacramentals, as well as what I wrote earlier regarding the Montfortian distinction between formal Marian devotional practices, and interior devotion with its unending outpouring of new exterior expressions.\n\nThe view which has been emerging for me with some clarity is one that I don 't recall reading anywhere (although 40 years is a long time and covers a lot of reading which I may have forgotten), so it must for the moment remain speculative and tentative.\n\nIt is that the sacramental blessing of everyday objects, articles, tools, vehicles, buildings, workplaces, etc. is not primarily for our sanctification - which comes from Mass, Sacraments, Liturgy, etc. - but as a support for our actual work of building of God's Kingdom: especially in the sense pointed out by Teilhard de Chardin that whatever we build on earth for the Peaceable Kingdom is also at the same time built (in some modality) for all eternity in the Heavenly City - which will ultimately descend at the end of time, when all is to be transformed through it and the Heavenly Paradise into a New Heaven and New Earth.\n\nTherefore, for those who are concerned primarily with Salvation and the Church, the Flowers of Our Lady and Mary Gardens, can indeed be subjectively somewhat superfluous - because they already have the Sacraments, etc.. And this is why the Church (per the Catholic Encyclopedia articles which I excerpted for you) is very specific in pointing out that the predominent view among theologians is that the sacmenentals are not to be looked to for sanctifying grace (although it also states there is a minority theological view to the contrary). They are not \"needed\" for this.\n\nOne important example of an improper use of religious symbols and sacramentals in this respect is that of the symbols of religious architecture and cathedral-building - which, in Freemasonry, were adopted as the basis for a secular rel igion with various symbols and rites of initiation, etc. originally taken from, but used and developed apart from, the Church and Sacraments, and drawing on many earlier traditions, such as from Egypt, etc..\n\nOn the other hand, the various medieval craft guilds made abundant use of symbolism from their crafts - which was used in its proper relationship of being nourished from and leading back to the Church and Sacraments.\n\nThe proper view of the sacramentals, I propose, is that in addition to our primary source of grace and sanctification in the Sacraments and Liturgy, we also need objective means of assistance - the sacramentals - for our work of religious transformation and building in the secular world for \"Thy Kingdom Come\".\n\nIn this respect, the Catholic Encyclopedia article on \"Blessings\" differentiates between: 1) those blessings which transform artifacts or natural objects into \"religious objects\", which are to be reserved as such, apart from other objects - viz., crucifixes, rosary beads, scapulars, medals, images, roses for the sick, flowers for crowning Mary's statues, Assumption bundles, etc., and 2) those artifacts and natural objects which are ordered to religious ends, but continue in their natural functioning, without special reservation, like leaven in dough - viz., food, tools, instruments, vehicles, household articles, seeds, plants, etc..\n\nThe former are generally valued, as reserved religious objects, for protection from evil spirits and for the enhancement of prayers for physical and spiritual healing; and the latter for the enhancement of the spiritual intentions and objectives of their ongoing prayerful use.\n\nWhile I can't know exactly which blessings the roadside goldenrod may have received (other than my limited personal blessing with the Sign of the Cross, which I give to all flowers I behold, as to my meals, etc.) - such as inclusion in various blessings given from time to time to the world, country, state, county, countryside, etc. - I nevertheless experienced a pervasive spiritual uplift of sacramental piety as I beheld it, in awe.\n\nDid Jane happen to show you the historic landmark in Falmouth of the birthplace of Catherine Lee Bates, author of the words of \"America The Beautiful\". The line, \"America, America, God shed his grace on Thee\", has always been very moving to me, and I envisage the grace prayed for as blanketing the coutryside, as well as people and cities - through Mary's universal mediation.)\n\nOn this occasion the goldenrod colonies, and therefore the sense of sacramental piety, extended into the grounds of our very property visited, as I mentioned, so that I was continuously quickened to the source and ultimate purpose of life; to the building of the earthly Peaceable Kingdom; and to the religious and moral considerations applicable to the work and relationships at hand.\n\nOn the other hand, when plants are cultivated and blest for their specific religious symbolisms - as with Mary Garden Flowers of Our Lady - the sacramental piety pervades each particular symbolism: moving us to imitation of Mary's purity of intention in her work at Nazareth; to praise of her excellences; and to recourse to her perogatives of intercession and mediation, etc. - as when we pray the succesive mysteries of the Rosary on blest Rosary beads.\n\nThen, we flew and drove to our Ohio chemical purification plant (painted our standard white and blue, for purity, (as selected by others than myself, and thus providential, for me) - beautifully landscaped with flower beds of summer annuals, and newly planted chrysanthemums - within the setting of the wild goldenrod, white asters and blue chicory at the borders of the property - all serving to further extend the sense of sacramental piety from the drive.\n\nI tell you about all this, Nan, as some examples of how the Flowers of Our Lady and Mary Gardens can contribute to our life \"in the world\" - augmenting what I have written about their contribution to domestic life, as in \"In Mary's Garden\", \"A Garden Full of Aves\" and \"Our Lady's Solar Greenhouse\". And from this sacramentalizing perspective, we follow closely and pray continuously for the course of events in the Persian Gulf, South Africa, the U.S. economy, etc., etc..\n\nRecourse to sacramentally blest flowers and other objects engenders love, and gives an added confidence that prayers quickened through them are presented in the context of the efficacy of the prayer of the entire Church.\n\nAnother, more recent \"event\".\n\nOne of the delicacies I look for each fall is the occasional second blooming of a few of the spring perennials, including such favorite Mary Garden flowers as \"Virgin Flower\" (periwinkle) and \"Our Lady's Modesty\" (violet) - typically hidden down beneath the foliage. (Our Lady is \"really modest\".)\n\nThe other day a striking single large \"Virgin Pink\" (clove pink or garden pink, Dianthus plumarius) bloom stood out in the sun, against the dark background of foliage shadow, as I walked past the lovely little \"cottage\" garden atthe entrance to St. Mark's Episcopal Church in downtown Philadelphia.\n\nFirst, I better understood why these flowers are also, in the research, called \"Mary's Lights\". But I was especially struck by the outlining of the tooth- like edges of the flower petals - from which \"pinking\" and \"pinking shears\" are named, or maybe vice versa. (The Oxford English Dictionary: \"Pink. 1512 . . . scalloping of garments . . . ; 1573 . . . Dianthus...plumarius . . .\")\n\nIn Holland (I believe), and maybe elsewhere, Pentacost is known as \"Pinkster\", as it is known as \"Whit Sunday\" in England, etc., so that the name, \"Virgin Pink\" also corresponds to the bloom of this flower in late May (as distinct from the early and mid-May blooming flowers) around Pentacost tide, as well as to it s pink color. Further, the pointed, \"pinked\", edges of the flowers are striking symbolic reminders of the pointed tongues of flame of the pentacostally descend ing Holy Spirit on Mary and the Apostles in the Upper Room.\n\nOne of the most multiply overlapping Marion flower symbols I have encountered.\n\nAs I touched upon at the outset of this letter, Nan, I am happy that I have been able to write to you extensively during this recent period. A major project is now coming up which may refocus my rumination and waking-sleeping flow of thought in other directions for the next six months or more. I consider it a providential privilege to have been able to share with you the fruits of my Mary' s Gardens experience liberally at this time - just as previous opportunities hav e come up in the last ten years to correspond at length with Jane at the time of the Garden of Our Lady Jubilee, with Bonnie in connection with Our Lady's Solar Greenhouse, and with Brother Sean about Knock.\n\nI extend my prayerful best wishes to you and your committee in carrying for ward your work, and of course will look forward to your letters and will keep in close touch.\n\nIn conclusion, I must say that the casting of the Our Lady of Nazareth mode l is a great inspiration and very dynamic for me spiritually. Thanks again so very much. I envisage it in the Mary Garden with a clump of Impatiens - known in Germany as \"Mother Love\", the constancy of which is seen to be symbolized by the constancy of bloom of this much loved and used plant through the months. The statue and the plants enhance each other, and just with the statue in mind, each clump that I see in city tubs and window boxes becomes much more meaningful for me and quickening of sacramental piety.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBack\n\nBoston, MA\n\nMay 31, 1990\n\nVisitation\n\nDear Nan,\n\n(After reading your letter of April 30th, I feel I have known you for ever. One of the beauties of the \"Communion of Saints\". How I look forward to the fullness of all eternity! - the first step towards which is our work of building God's Kingdom on earth here and now)\n\nDue to travels, your letter of May 1st just caught up with me on May 22nd. Also a letter from Brother Seán MacNamara, from Ireland. And, just in case I hadn't noticed that the 22nd was indeed another special Mary's Gardens day, I was favored with one of those special caresses of providential love - like the snow in May on the day of St. Therese's vows. (The last such event was when a florist shop, \"Thoughts in Bloom\", opened nearby our Philadelphia studio. Or maybe it was when I noticed that the top of the new \"Liberty Place\" skyscraper now rising above central Philadelphia has a huge \"M\" pattern its peak, outlined by strip-lighting at night. Fitting that the watching over the City of Brotherly Love (I'm sure etymologists can come up with a more gender-free translation for \"Philadelphia\" today) by the Mother of us All is so strikingly symbolized, by an artifact of the Holy Spitit. In Boston the renowned glass Hancock Tower has been my \"Ladder to Heaven\", and now we have a more specifically Marian one in Philadelphia - I attach a photocopy of this tower from a watercolor painting by a local street artist).\n\nAnyway, as I entered the taxie to the airport I noticed that the driver had laid 6 or 8 pink carnations in front of him on the ledge above the dashboard. Mary Mediatrix present with her flowers even in a taxie! When I remarked about them - \"You must love flowers!\" - the driver told me he had grown up across the street from an arboretum so that each morning when he looked out the window he saw a sea of flowers. I made bold to ask him, \"Are you a Catholic?\" \"Yes.\" \"Here's a reprint of an article (\"AVE\") about the Flowers of Our Lady and Mary Gardens I'd like you and your family to have.\" He then mentioned to me that he normally \"held back\" on showing his love for flowers because it wasn't considered \"manly\". I commented that in the Latin countries men were culturally freer to love flowers. He then remarked that with the humid Boston weather of the last days, the flowers had been lying there without wilting for four days - almost miraculously. Everyone else had been complaining about the weather.\n\nI was delighted to hear that you learned of the Flowers of Our Lady and Mary Gardens from Nanette Strayer - after she had given a JL lecture on herbs. If I'm not mistaken, Nannette was or was then in the process of becaming a correspondent and good friend of Bonnie Roberson (who started Mary-Gardening in 1957) through the Herb Society of America.\n\nI mentioned in my previous correspondence that at the time we started Mary's Gardens, in 1951, our very first little \"ad\" - in the garden section of the now defunct New York Herald Tribune - was read by Daniel J. Foley, a Catholic and Editor of Horticulture, then the official magazine of the Massachusetts Horticultural Society, who wrote to us, and later met with me for a day at the Garden of Our Lady in Woods Hole. His office, in Horticultural Hall, Boston, was close by that of Mrs. Foster (Margaretta?) Stearns, also a Catholic, Editor of The Herbaraist, annual publication of the Herb Society of America. She, too, wrote to us and, indeed, sent us some lovely Medici Press Holy Cards of \"Our Lady's Pincushion\", \"Our Lady's Thimble\", \"Our Lady's Eardrops\", \"Our Lady's Slipper\" and \"Mary's Rose\" she had found in England.\n\nThe outcome of this was that a photograph of \"An Illuminated Mary Garden\" was published in the December, 1952, Horticulture, and an article, \"Mary Gardens\", by Dan was published in The Herbarist, for 1953. And in the December, 1953 issue of Horticulture, Dan published, \"Flowers of the Madonna\", the first of two articles in on the Flowers of Our Lady written at his request by Harold N. Moldenke, co-author with his wife, of the book, Plants of the Bible, which had just been published.\n\n(Dan also wrote several articles for the Boston (Catholic) Pilot in May of 1956, and spoke on Mary Gardens at an annual meeting of the Catholic Art Association in (I believe) Latrobe, PA.)).\n\nI should also mention that we were given invaluable horticultural advice at the beginning of our work by Jane (professionally, Martha) Garra, a professional horticulturalist of Philadelphia, and also a HSA member.\n\nThus, Ed McTague and I, who had no horticultural credentials, and in fact practically no gardening experience at all, were providentially blessed with needed \"legitimacy\", especially for skeptical religious authorities, through Herb Society of America members, as well as, and more importantly, a marvellous dissemination of the Mary Garden idea and movement.\n\nOther milestones along this path were Bonnie Roberson's invitation focal Mary Garden Exhibit at the 1962 annual meeting of the HSA in Washington I mentioned, in which I and Ginney Thomas, a Philadelphia HSA member (with a large sunporch with which to \"force\" Bonnie's plants) assisted her; and then the 50th anniversary issue of The Herbarist in 1983 which included the article, \"Mary Gardens - The Herbs and Flowers of the Virgin Mary\", of which you mentioned you have a copy. In all this the HSA Catholics were ever alert to present the material in such a way as to not offend non-Catholics: for example the 1983 article was actually composed by the then Editor of The Herbarist, Sandy Gilmore (?), from excerpts of previous articles Bonnie and I had written, and then submitted by her to us for our final smoothing and approval. In her professional concern, she requested much primary documentation, and I remember she went to a local library in Lansing to actually see firsthand a photo of a medieval woodcut with the title \"Mary Garden\" Bonnie referred her to.\n\nFortunately, Ed McTague was very conscious of this sort of thing from the beginning - we had a Jewish typographer and a Protestant printer - and went to great lengths to document everything so we could not be accused of \"pious fraud\" (which I recall the Jesuit missionaries were accused of when they first brought back sketches of the Passion Flower which they found in the New World - until they actually some specimens of the flower itself back to Europe).\n\nA couple of other HSA links come to mind as I write. You will note that in \"Mary Gardens - The Herbs and Flowers of the Virgin Mary\" a paragraph (originating with Sandy' editing) mentions that the founding of the Woods Hole Garden of Our Lady and of the Herb Society of America both took place in 1932. (By further coincidence, I found, from another article in the same anniversary issue, that the son of one of the HSA founders, Mrs. Lawrence Brown, had been a classmate of mine at prep school in Boston.)\n\nIn 1946 I was present at the annual meeting of the HSA Philadelphia chapter (hosted by my then"
