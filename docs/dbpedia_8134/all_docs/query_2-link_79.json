        "text": "Abigail Ogilvy Gallery and Boston Sculptors Gallery are pleased to invite you to a roundtable conversation with Donna Dodson and Alison Croney Moses, moderated by Beth McLaughlin, Artistic Director and Chief Curator at the Fuller Craft Museum (Brockton, MA) on the occasion of Dodson's and Moses' current solo shows. These two prominent women share the craft of woodcarving and the language of creating three dimensional forms by hand. Each artist also draws from a lineage and community of makers and brings their unique vision to the medium. Known for her cutting-edge curation and contemporary craft collection development, Beth McLaughlin will explore the intersections and connections in the art and lives of these well-established Boston woodworkers in this roundtable conversation.\n\nJoin us for a conversation between makers, teachers, historians, and community leaders exploring pivotal schools and other sites that have shaped craft—understood expansively—in the United States over the last century. Where is craft taught? In what ways does place matter to craft learning? And how do we access these places—or are there barriers in the way?\n\nThis is the second of three conversations related to “Craft Schools,” a multiyear project encompassing public programs with artists across the US, artwork acquisitions to enhance MFA Boston’s contemporary craft collection, and, ultimately, a publication framing modern-day craft as inclusive and alive—inside and outside the walls of museums.\n\nNamita Gupta Wiggers, craft historian and curator\n\nJenny Williams, teacher, weaver, and Nez Perce tribal member\n\nAlison Croney Moses, artist and associate director of the Eliot School of Fine and Applied Arts\n\nAaron Beale, director of Berea College Student Craft\n\nModerated by Michelle Millar Fisher, Ronald C. and Anita L. Wornick Curator of Contemporary Decorative Arts\n\nGet Tickets Here\n\nOne of the most fundamental forms in craft, the vessel has long been an essential tool for use as well as for understanding the universe and the afterlife. From bowls and spoons to crucibles and boats, vessels have facilitated human survival, industry, and legend. The vessel’s role of containment also positions it as a metaphysical device that carries the soul, or as a metaphor for understanding autonomy, power, and agency over one’s body.\n\nConnecting to the Center for Art in Wood’s origins as an advocate for woodturning in art, this exhibition examines the vessel as a source of inspiration for artists working in wood. How have they been informed not only by the material and the pleasing roundness of the turned form, but also questions of offering and ownership, or concealment and emptiness? For millennia, the idea of the vessel has been used to explain the secrets of the universe. This exhibition, which includes works from the Center’s permanent collection as well as on loan, demonstrates the breadth of reflection, empowerment, subversion, and spiritual awareness inspired by the act of containment and the vessel form.\n\nWith works by: Humaira Abid, Michael Bauermeister, Vivian Chiu, Kyle Cottier, Alison Croney Moses, Frank E. Cummings III, Aaron Haba, Michelle Holzapfel, Dierra Jones, Maria van Kesteren, Markuu Kosonen, Jack Larimore, Sylvie Rosenthal, David Sengel, and Lynne Yamaguchi\n\nThe exhibition program is generously supported by the Cambium Circle Members of the Center for Art in Wood, the Bresler Foundation, Pennsylvania Council on the Arts, Philadelphia Cultural Fund, and Windgate Foundation. In-kind support was provided by Boomerang, Inc. and Sunlite Corporation.\n\nMamas! It's time to ROLL BOUNCE at Chez Vous!\n\nBoston area Black mamas are invited to Chez Vous for a skate party. Leave the kids at home and join us for an afternoon of music and fun. Space is limited so please register. Limited funds are available to support with childcare.\n\nRentals are included. Concessions are available for purchase.\n\nCome to learn, practice, or show off your skills with other mamas.\n\nAs indi­vid­u­als, we are each a product of the people with whom we’ve engaged with through­out our lives.\n\nWho have we worked with, been taught by or taught, been inspired by or inspired and how have these expe­ri­ences and influ­ences in our lives helped to shape who we are today?\n\nThrough the power of story­telling and reflec­tion, we will hear from three indi­vid­ual makers as they share reflec­tions and/​or thoughts on how these past expe­ri­ences have helped shape their outlook, their prac­tice, and the field.\n\nModer­a­tor, Amy Umbel, maker and co-host of ​‘Cut the Craft’ podcast, will take our three makers on a journey to artic­u­late these impactful experiences."
