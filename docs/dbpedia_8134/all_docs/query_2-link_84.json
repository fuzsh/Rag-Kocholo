        "text": "When God called Moses by name out of the burning bush, Moses answered “Here I am!” But when God told Moses He was sending him to Pharaoh, Moses said, “Who am I?” I love the honesty of Moses. Because you and I can relate to it, right? We have each had a “Who am I” moment when confronted with something we believe God is calling us to do. I ask that question of myself often, and am comforted by the fact the Paul, the mighty apostle, asked the same thing. He said, “But thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumphal procession, and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of Him everywhere.” We are sent to spread the fragrance of the knowledge of God. Then Paul asks, “Who is sufficient for these things?” What’s the answer? Christ is! It is Jesus who leads us in triumphal procession as His sent ones. Yet we often say like Moses, “Who I am?”\n\nThe good news is that Moses was asking GOD that question. Listen, dear reader. If you have a “Who am I” moment, have it with God. He will answer and has answered that question clearly in His word. I believe what we see in Moses’ story is true for every believer. We are called first to faith (salvation) and second to service. We work out our salvation with fear and trembling because as Paul said, “It is God who works in you, both to will and to work for His good pleasure.”\n\nIt is God who works in you, not you who work for God. Notice that God didn’t say in response to Moses’ concern, “Oh no, no, you can do this, Moses. You were born a Hebrew and you clearly love your people. And you were raised in Pharaoh’s house and have clearly learned how to be a prince of Egypt and speak truth to power. You are the perfect man for this. Not feeling it? Here, Moses, read this book I found at the bookstore on how to imagine yourself into a way of feeling powerful. ‘Cause it is in you, man!”\n\nNo. God said, essentially, “You are dead right, Moses. You cannot do this. And good news, you’re not doing this. I am.” God said, “I will be with you.” You are being sent but I am going with you. And it is I who work in you both to will and to do. We can start every day that way because God does not change, so we say with confidence, “God is with me.” The call of service to God is always accompanied by the promise of God’s presence. One of my favorites is where God said to Isaiah (and you and me), “Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.”\n\n“Moses,” God said, “I will be with you.” And then he gave Moses a sign! “When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain.” Think about that one. Moses may have thought, “Hey, wait a minute. Whoa. God, are you saying I will know I can do this when all the people of Israel are here, free, serving you on this mountain?” “Right.” “But, but, that’s not a sign is it? I mean, that’s a sign I won’t see until…” Shhh, yes, Moses. What I am telling you to do is to believe My word. To trust. Me.\n\nMoses was still not convinced so he said, “What if they ask me the name of the God who sent me, what do I say?” Moses went from “Whom am I?” to “Who are you?” He was still trying to deal with his own fears of inadequacy instead of trusting in God’s all powerful sufficiency.\n\nNow, not to be too hard on Moses, we all struggle with the same questions at times. But here’s the positive side of what Moses was doing. In his trembling before God, he was working out his salvation, not working it in or working for it, but working it out. He was wanting to know the God of the universe. Who are you, God? It is the most important question we can possibly ask. And God delights in answering that question. Our God has made Himself known to us.\n\nWho are you? God. My King and my Lord. Who am I? I am yours.\n\nWhen at the age of 40 Moses went out to see his people, who were slaves, he witnessed an Egyptian beating a Hebrew. Moses took matters into his own hands, killing the slave master and burying him in the sand. Almost as though he had decided right then to deliver his people from bondage, one at a time. But that was not God’s will at the time, and not God’s way at all.\n\nOne of the keys to growing up is learning from our mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes, each one of us, and with regularity. But do we learn from them? Not just that we did something wrong. More importantly, are we willing to recognize what we did wrong and then change accordingly? Otherwise we are like people Paul wrote about who were burdened with sins and led astray by various passions, but were always learning and never able to arrive at a knowledge of the truth. Moses had to flee Egypt and the Pharaoh because he committed murder, a crime of passion fueled by his anger and his overblown reaction to injustice. Will he learn from that? Will he change? God gives him an opportunity almost as soon as he arrives in Midian and rests near a well.\n\nWhile Moses sat there, seven daughters of the priest of Midian came to water their father’s flock, but shepherds also showed up and started to run the women off. Apparently, this was a daily occurrence, but Moses was there this time. We have seen this movie before, haven’t we, where Moses sees oppression taking place and he takes out the oppressor? But this day was different. He stood up when he saw the aggression and took care of the shepherds himself. We don’t know how many men there were, but it didn’t matter. Moses’ skill and training was more than a match for them. How do we know that Moses learned from the last time he responded to oppression? He didn’t kill the shepherds! The story of rescue was told to their father, Reuel, when the seven daughters got home and he asked how they could possibly have gotten the flocks watered so quickly. An Egyptian protected us, ran off the bad guys and then watered out flocks!\n\nThey were as amazed that Moses watered their flocks as they were that he protected them from the shepherds. This just was not done. For a man to serve a woman in those times and in such a way, drawing water for her flocks, was unheard of. This is Moses pointing us to a greater prophet, the greatest of all. Jesus taught his disciples, and you and me, that we are not supposed to be like the Gentiles who lord it over the people, “But whoever would be great among you must be your servant, and whoever would be first among you must be slave of all.” Then while the disciples were scratching their heads over that one, Jesus added, “For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.” Like Jesus, when confronted with evil, Moses stood, saved, and served.\n\nWhen Reuel heard this from his daughters, he rebuffed them for leaving their rescuer in the wilderness. So they found Moses and fetched him to the house. He stayed for a meal. Then he stayed for a good night’s sleep. Then he stayed for a wife, as Reuel gave him his daughter, Zipporah, to marry. She then gave Moses a son. And Moses, the prince of Egypt and one-day deliverer of God’s people became a shepherd for 40 years. Perfect training for what lay ahead.\n\nWhat can we learn from this event in Moses’ life? God’s plan and timetable are perfect, but they often do not match ours. We want it now. We want it easy and convenient. We want it our way. But God patiently prepared this man as he cared for sheep and learned how to live in the wilderness and learned how to protect his flock and learned how to lead stubborn sheep even when they didn’t want to follow. Hmmm. Sounds like God was preparing Moses for what would happen in the last 40 years of his life.\n\nHey, young people, don’t be in a hurry to figure out your whole life. But do not delay in preparing your heart to follow God. Commit to doing hard things. Commit to reading the Bible and listening to God’s voice as he speaks through his word. Commit to serving others. Hey, older people, the same is true for us! It is never time to sit back and say, “My work here is done.” Or to believe that God cannot use you and your time, talents, and gifts in his service.\n\nThe Pharaoh issued a hit on every Hebrew baby boy. If anyone in Egypt found one, they were to throw him in the Nile. Serve him up to the crocodiles. Genocide was on Pharaoh’s mind, and Amram and Jochebed were living in the kill zone. One cry and one vigilant neighbor who heard and investigated would result in the death of their baby, Moses. Here is where we see the first act of a mother’s faith. “She hid him for three months.” That’s 90 days and over 2,000 hours, every one of which could have been Moses’ last. Why did she risk it?\n\nBecause this was her son, flesh of her flesh. But she also knew because this was a critical time for Moses to be nursed by his mother, to bond with her, to be held and comforted by her, not to mention all of the physical and cognitive development that would take place in those first few months. This boy was being raised by faith and make no mistake: all godly parents raise their children by faith. We may not be living under the edict of a tyrant, but we are about the business of raising godly children in an ungodly world. We can only do that by faith and by the grace of God. But no matter what, we must do that. Each child and each day is precious.\n\nThe writer of Hebrews wrote, “By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw that the child was beautiful, and they were not afraid of the king’s edict.” Stephen mentioned the same thing in his sermon before he was stoned to death, that Moses “was brought up for three months in his father’s house.” This mom and dad cherished every moment with their son, not knowing how long they would have him. The same is true for us, Mom and Dad.\n\nThe next act of faith was also born out of tremendous pressure: Jochebed knew that she could not hide Moses forever. So she prepared a basket for him, an ark, made of bulrushes, and covered it with pitch. The word in Hebrew for this little boat is used only one other place, in the book of Genesis when God told Noah to make an ark…and cover it with pitch. The readers of Exodus in the wilderness and later generations would certainly recognize the symbolism. God saved his people through an ark in Noah’s day. God delivered his people by sparing the deliverer in an ark many years later. The Bible says that Moses’ mother “put the child in (the basket)…among the reeds by the river bank.” Philip Ryken said she must have put her heart in there as well. She “placed” the basket in the water. The word means, “gently placed.” With a mother’s love and courage born of faith in a loving God, Jochebed gently turned her child over to God. Hannah did the same with Samuel but she was just giving him over to Eli the priest. Jochebed was turning her son over to the elements, but she knew, by faith, that she was placing Moses in the arms of God.\n\nYou know the rest of the story. God did protect Moses. He used five women in the birth narrative to make sure the deliverer of His people would be able to grow up and do just that. We owe so much to Shiphrah, Puah, Jochebed, Miriam, and even the unnamed daughter of the Pharaoh. She raised Moses in the seat of power, where he was “trained for Pharaoh’s overthrow right under Pharaoh’s nose!” (James Hoffmeier)\n\nGod is good, and our children are precious.\n\nThe new Pharaoh did not know Joseph, except perhaps by reputation. What he did know was the people of Israel living in Egypt were growing and were strong. The ruler of the most powerful nation on earth said of the Hebrews, they are “too many and too mighty for us.” He was afraid of these people he did not know, who came from a different land, and his fear of them rising up against him led him to take drastic and wicked actions. His first act was to command the Israelites be made slaves. Their freedom to live in a foreign land disappeared over night, as taskmasters were appointed to rule over them with whips. God told Abraham this would happen, many years before: “Know for certain that your offspring will be sojourners in a land that is not theirs, and will be servants there, and they will be afflicted for 400 years.”\n\nBut the more the Hebrews were oppressed, the more they multiplied. These were God’s people, devoted to him and free in him, even while enslaved. Their suffering did nothing but cause them to lean more into God by faith as they “groaned because of their slavery and cried out for help.” The same holds true today and always has: the greatest growth of Christianity happens in times and places where it costs something to follow God and trust Jesus. “The blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church.”\n\nWhat happened in Egypt? When the oppression of slavery didn’t work, the king took steps to eliminate a race of people by destroying the male seed. He commanded the midwives, Shiphrah and Puah, to put to death every Hebrew baby boy as soon as he was born.\n\nThe Pharaoh’s new edict threatened to eliminate the birth of the one who would lead God’s people out of bondage. But Shiphrah and Puah stood in the gap, as their reverence for God and life led them to refuse to do what the Pharaoh had commanded. Included in the number saved was Moses, the deliverer of Israel.\n\nThese women are clearly heroes of the faith in the Bible, the first two “pro-life heroines” in history. Shiphrah means “beautiful one” and Puah means “splendid one,” and they were true to their names. These two effectively said to Pharaoh, long before Peter and John said to the rulers and elders in Jerusalem, “We must obey God rather than man.”\n\nDo you see the contrast between Pharaoh and these two women? Fear of man can cause us to do unspeakable things, as the Egyptian ruler did. But a love and reverence for God leads us on the path of righteousness, no matter the cost, as these two godly women illustrate for us. They must have understood the consequences of disobeying the Pharaoh. But the Bible and the history of Christianity are filled with examples of people who were willing to offer themselves as living sacrifices for the sake of obedience to the call of faith in Jesus.\n\nFinally, the irony cannot be missed. The Pharaoh was worried about boys becoming men, but his plan was blown up by two women.\n\nYou know the old joke, “How do you eat an elephant?” One bite at a time. How do you eat the book of Exodus, 40 chapters, nearly 26,000 words, packed full of amazing stories of the redemption of God’s people? One bite at a time. I hope to spend most of the next two years walking through this book with the family of believers at Antioch. Why would we do that? Because we meet God in Exodus, as the hero of the story, just as he was in Genesis. God makes himself know to Moses and to the children of Israel, and to us, in this book. The Bible itself is the story of creation, the fall, redemption, and restoration. Exodus is the greatest story of redemption in the Old Testament. The book was first called “Names” in Hebrew because of the first few words, “These are the names.” But when the translation into Greek happened in the third century B.C., the Septuagint, it was renamed “Exodus,” which means “departure.” The first time that word occurs in the Greek is chapter 19: “On the third moon after the people of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt…”\n\nThis book is not about a people in Egypt, not primarily. No, they went out. This book is about the departure of God’s people by God’s mighty hand out of Egypt. It is not about residence; it is about exodus. And it is about God’s intervention in the affairs of men. In honor of our nation’s history and our celebration of Independence Day last week, I offer this story, which many of you know, about God’s intervention in our nation’s history before our nation ever came to be.\n\nIn 1755, during the French and Indian War, 23-year-old Colonel George Washington was one of 1,400 British troops under the command of General Braddock marching to capture Fort Duquesne, near Pittsburgh, when they were attacked by a French and Indian force. During the battle, “Braddock was killed and every officer on horseback was shot, except Washington.” The young colonel later wrote to his brother, “But by the All-Powerful Dispensations of Providence, I have been protected beyond all human probability or expectation; for I had four bullets through my coat, and two horses shot under me, yet escaped unhurt, although death was leveling my companions on every side of me.” A Native American who fought in the battle later stated, “Washington was never born to be killed by a bullet! I had seventeen fair fires at him with my rifle and could not bring him to the ground.”\n\nSounds like a miracle to me. But it pales in comparison to what we read in Exodus.\n\n“The exodus,” Philip Ryken wrote, “was the great miracle of the Old Covenant.” There is only one greater act of redemption in the whole Bible, the greatest of all time, and that was the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ.\n\nPsalm 66 invites us to study Exodus: “Come and see what God has done: he is awesome in his deeds toward the children of man. He turned the sea into dry land…Bless our God, O peoples; let the sound of his praise be heard…” The exodus shaped the whole Bible, and there are over 120 references to it in the Old Testament alone. Psalm 77 tells us who God is:\n\n“Your way, O God, is holy. What god is great like our God? You are the God who works wonders;\n\nyou have made known your might among the peoples. You with your arm redeemed your people,\n\nthe children of Jacob and Joseph. Selah When the waters saw you, O God, when the waters saw you, they were afraid; indeed, the deep trembled…Your way was through the sea, your path through the great waters; yet your footprints were unseen. You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.”\n\nI am looking forward to every bite of this wonderful testimony of God’s providence and love.\n\nA man named Steve Huffman wrote a column in our local paper several years ago about some great and not-so-great moments in the history of American fatherhood. Here’s a sampling from his timeline:\n\n1861- Abraham Lincoln becomes president and the following year, his son, Willie, 11, dies. Thereafter, Lincoln takes great comfort in the company of his 8-year-old son, Tad, even after the boy drives a pair of goats through the White House.\n\n1901- Teddy Roosevelt, father of 6, is sworn in as president. Of his outspoken daughter, Alice, he says, “I can do one of two things. I can be President of the United States, or I can control Alice. I cannot possibly do both.”\n\n1950 – Harry Truman stands up for his daughter, Margaret, a concert singer, after she is hit with a scathing review in The Washington Post. “I have never met you,” Truman writes the reviewer, “but if I do, you’ll need a new nose…”\n\n1974 – Harry Chapin releases “Cat’s in the Cradle,” a song about a dad who doesn’t spend enough time with his son who in turn grows up and doesn’t spend enough time with his dad. Across the country, men of all ages experience the ultimate guilt trip.\n\nI love those stories, and I know it is tough being a good father. A Father’s Day card says, “Dad, everything I ever learned I learned from you, except one thing. The family car really will do 110.”\n\nFatherhood doesn’t look any easier when you look at the examples of fathers in the Scriptures.\n\nJacob played favorites and ended up causing a family war, where11 of the brothers sold their brother Joseph into slavery. Jephthah made a foolish vow to God, promising that the first thing to come out of his doors when he arrived home from war he would sacrifice as a burnt offering…his only child, a daughter.\n\nDavid, the man after God’s own heart, provoked his son Absalom to wrath, because David refused to see him or speak to him for 2 years. It ended in civil war and the death of Absalom. And one of the saddest moments for fatherhood was when Eli, a high priest and a judge of Israel, was judged by God and the nation of Israel was also judged, losing the ark of the covenant to the Philistines. Why were he and Israel judged? God said to Eli, through young Samuel, “And I declare to him that I am about to punish his house forever, for the iniquity that he knew, because his sons were blaspheming God, and he did not restrain them.”\n\nFatherhood is not for wimps. And I know sometimes we fathers feel like we are being beat up on from all sides. We know men and fathers are reviled in the media. Sometimes men even feel like they’re not safe at church. One little boy said to the preacher, “Boy that was a good sermon. My dad slumped way down today!”\n\nThe Bible has much to say about being a father and one of the best places to start is Deuteronomy 6. There, God tells fathers what is most important, and how to live that out before our children: “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might.”\n\nThere is one God in three persons and he alone is God. We stand on that creed and proclaim it, no matter the cost. Martin Luther, on trial for his faith said, Here I stand, I can do no other. Joshua said, Choose this day whom you will serve… Peter, on trial for his faith, said, We must obey God rather than men… Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego, on trial for their lives, said, Our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king. But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up.\n\nAntioch hosted some people from Voice of the Martyrs years ago, and one of them told the story and showed the picture of a 10 year old boy, living in Sudan, who was captured by militant Muslims, forced to build a fire, and then was ordered to pray to Allah or be thrown into the fire. “It is impossible,” he replied. “I am a Christian and belong to Jesus.” So they threw him into the fire. He was badly burned but survived.\n\nWe in America sometimes run from the least amount of pushback from scoffers, not to mention violent persecution. God asked Jeremiah this question: If you have raced with men on foot, and they have wearied you, then how will you compete with horses?”\n\nLet’s stand, fathers, and love God with all that we have. Our children need that kind of father.\n\nLast week I wrote about 5 roadblocks to grace, according to Jerry Bridges in his book, Transforming Grace. Here is one more of the 10 he wrote about. You don’t understand grace if you…\n\nThink you can do something to make God love you more or love you less. We have all heard it: there’s nothing you can do to make God love you any more than he does. There’s nothing you can do to make God love you any less than he does. We hear it. But we don’t believe it. So we keep trying harder to get it all right and to be perfect. But that’s looking in the wrong place. Arthur Pink wrote years ago, “The great mistake made by most of the Lord’s people is in hoping to discover in themselves that which is to be found in Christ alone.” Sam Storm wrote, “Grace ceases to be grace if God is compelled to bestow it in the presence of human merit…Grace ceases to be grace if God is compelled to withdraw it in the presence of human demerit…(Grace) is treating a person…solely according to the infinite goodness and sovereign purpose of God.” As the hymn writer said, “Nothing in my hand I bring, simply to Thy cross I cling.”\n\nThat’s what was happening in Jesus’ story of the prodigal son. Philip Yancey wrote a modern version in his book, What’s So Amazing About Grace, that starts like this: A young girl grows up on a cherry orchard just above Traverse City, Michigan. Her parents, a bit old-fashioned, tend to overreact to her nose ring, the music she listens to, and the length of her skirts. They ground her a few times, and she seethes inside. “I hate you,” she screams at her father when he knocks on the door of her room after an argument, and that night she acts on a plan she has mentally rehearsed scores of times. She runs away. She ends up in Detroit, on the street, on drugs and selling herself to support her habit. Months go by and she sees her picture on a flier one day with “Have you seen this child?” written under it. That scares her but she laughs it off because she doesn’t look anything like that picture, and she is certainly not a child any more. Her life takes a turn when she gets sick, a cough that won’t go away and her skin starts to yellow. She is all alone and afraid and suddenly all she can think of is home in Traverse City.\n\nThe girl makes three phone calls home and each goes to voicemail. On the third call, she leaves a message: Dad, Mom, it’s me. I was wondering about maybe coming home. I’m catching a bus up your way, and it’ll get there about midnight tomorrow. If you’re not there, well, I guess I’ll just stay on the bus until it hits Canada.” On the seven hour bus ride she practices what she will say, telling her dad that she’s sorry and it was all her fault, not his…her throat tightens; she hasn’t apologized to anyone in years. The bus arrives in Traverse City and the driver says, “Fifteen minutes, folks, then the bus will pull out.” She straightens her skirt, runs a brush through her hair, looks at her nicotine stained fingers and wonders if they will say something about them, and then she shuffles into the terminal…\n\nThere, in the concrete-walls-and-plastic-chairs bus terminal in Traverse City, Michigan, stands a group of forty brothers and sisters and great-aunts and uncles and cousins and even her grandmother. And taped across the entire wall of the terminal is a banner that reads, “Welcome Home!” Out of the crowd of cheers and well-wishers walks her Dad. She stares out through the tears quivering in her eyes like hot mercury and begins the memorized speech, “Dad, I’m sorry. I know….” He interrupts her. “Shhh, honey. We’ve got no time for that. No time for apologies. You’ll be late for the party. A banquet’s waiting for you at home.”\n\nOne day several years ago, as I was driving down the road and thinking about the grace of God while talking through some verses in Titus and watching for deer, I was suddenly filled with an almost overwhelming sense of God’s presence with me and his assurance to me that I am his. And that he loves me. And likes me. And that he is pleased with me, that by his grace I am what I am.\n\nHe thinks the very same thing about you, each of you who have been welcomed home from the far country into an eternal relationship with Christ.\n\nIn his book, Transforming Grace, Jerry Bridges says there are some telltale signs that show we don’t really understand grace. Here are the first five roadblocks in Bridges’ book to walking in the power of God’s grace as a believer. He says you don’t understand God’s grace when you…\n\nLive with a vague sense of his disapproval. That means you live with a performance-based acceptance mindset. Instead, with the understanding that God is for you, you can live with acceptance-based performance. You do what pleases the Lord because you love him and you know he accepts and loves you perfectly. Tim Keller wrote in his book, Forgive, “We are so united in Christ in the Father’s eyes that when he sees us, he sees Jesus. Christians are so one with Christ that we are as forgiven as if we had already died for our sins, as if we had already been raised. We are so one with Christ that when the Father sees us, he treats us as if we deserve all the glory and honor that Jesus deserves. Over 160 times in the New Testament, Paul speaks of being ‘in Christ’ or ‘in him.’ He calls himself a ‘man in Christ’ in 2 Corinthians 12. It utterly dominated Paul’s self-understanding and it must dominate ours.”\n\nNext, you don’t understand God’s grace when you…\n\nHesitate to bring your needs to him when you’ve just failed him. The Bible says in Isaiah says that God has cast all our sins behind his back. So all of our failures, past, present and future, are out of sight, covered by God’s grace. Why would we wait to come to God when we fail again? Do we want our children to ever be afraid to come to us? Of course not. How much more our heavenly Father welcomes us with open arms. Next, you don’t understand God’s grace when you…\n\nThink that grace is something that makes up the difference between the best you can do and what you think God expects from you. That would be like two of us trying to jump across the Grand Canyon, which averages nine miles apart. I might jump 15 feet after a full sprint. You come along and blow me away with a 30-foot jump. We both end up in the bottom of the canyon. God is not a taskmaster, but a loving father. Next, you don’t understand God’s grace when you…\n\nFeel you deserve an answer to prayer because of your hard work and sacrifice. That reminds me of the Pharisee who prayed thus with himself: “I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I get.” He went down to his house unjustified, not like the tax collector who threw himself on God’s grace and said, “God, be merciful to me, a sinner!” To the degree that we or our children trust in our own self-righteousness, putting any confidence in our own good works or achievements, to that same degree we are not living by the grace of God. Next, you don’t understand God’s grace when you…\n\nAssume that forgiveness no longer applies to you now that you’ve sinned so many times you’ve used up all your credit. The Bible says, “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” God is not a Coke machine who one day runs out of product. He’s not a bank that runs out of money. Paul said, “where sin increased, grace abounded all the more.”\n\nIf God’s grace is the Pacific Ocean, too much of our life is spent happily paddling around in a plastic kiddie pool. What we know of God’s grace is so limited, and always will be. I think that’s part of what eternity is for. Exploring the depths of God’s grace. Exploring the depths of God!\n\nWhy wait? We can start now swimming in the ocean of God’s grace.\n\nPeter says, “take care that you are not carried away with the error of lawless people and lose your own stability.” Peter may have been thinking about the time he was deceived and deceiving others about the Gentiles. He was carried away into sinful thinking and behavior until Paul confronted him.\n\nNever happens to any of us, right?\n\nYes. It does. How do we know we have been carried away with the error, the lies, of the lawless? We lose our stability. We are blown about by every wind of doctrine that comes whistling down through the corridors of culture. We begin to say things like, “It really doesn’t matter which God you believe in, as long as you are sincere.” Or, “Isn’t church an institution that has outlived its usefulness? I don’t really need the church, right? I can just follow Jesus on my own.” Or, “I believe in science; it is really the only thing in the world that is reliable.” Or, “Because of all the suffering in the world, God is either not all loving or he is not all powerful, and therefore I cannot trust him.” These questions are not new; they have all been around for a long time, and each are errors of lawless people that Peter warns us about. By the way, a great resource that does an excellent job with some of these questions and others I didn’t mention is Rebecca McLaughlin’s book, Confronting Christianity: 12 Hard Questions for the World’s Largest Religion. We worked through the teen version a few years ago in a morning class here at Antioch: Ten Questions Every Teen Should Ask (and Answer) About Christianity.\n\nPeter says to the stable Christian, take care that you do not lose your stability! And I would say to parents that it is especially important that you are settled in what you believe because you have children watching you every day, and their stability will at least be influenced by yours. It’s like that warning we always hear on the airplane: “In case there is a loss in cabin pressure, yellow oxygen masks will deploy from the ceiling compartment located above you.” And they always say that if you are traveling with children, “please secure your own mask before assisting others around you.” Secure your own faith so that you can assist those around you. If you get carried away with the error of people who have rejected the truth of God’s Word, you also put your children and others who watch your faith at risk.\n\nHarrison Butker is a kicker for the Kansas City Chiefs who has helped them win three Super Bowls. Some of you have heard about the firestorm surrounding his commencement address he gave last week at Benedictine College. The remark that caused the longest applause at the commencement and the greatest protest in the nation afterward were these, directed to the female graduates: “Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world…I’m beyond blessed with the many talents God has given me, but it cannot be overstated that all of my success is made possible because a girl I met in band class back in middle school would convert to the faith, become my wife, and embrace one of the most important titles of all: homemaker.”\n\nCancel culture was firing on all cylinders as people around the country called for this man to be fired for saying these things. Here’s the question we have to answer. Does the Bible elevate or denigrate the office of homemaker? Elevate! That certainly does not mean a woman cannot have a career outside the home. But it also does not mean she has to in order to find meaningful purpose in her life. Being a homemaker is not just a career, it is a calling.\n\nPeter would say to all who want to cave to the lies of the culture, “take care that you are not carried away with the error of lawless people.”\n\nA rather pompous church leader was trying to impress upon a class of boys the importance of living the Christian life. “Why do people call me a Christian?” the man asked. After a moment’s pause, one youngster said, “Maybe it’s because they don’t know you?”\n\nWell, Peter certainly knew Paul, and he was anything but pompous. And at the end of his second letter, Peter refers to him as “our beloved brother Paul.” Peter knew, as any believer of that day did, that before Paul was saved, he was a Jewish terrorist named Saul who tracked down and imprisoned followers of Christ. The men who stoned Stephen to death laid their garments beside this young man Saul, as he watched the execution of the first martyr and then became an executioner himself. In those days he would have been, “our horrifying terrorist Saul.” But wonder of wonders, Jesus apprehended him on the road to Damascus, just as he does every person who comes to faith. Saul wasn’t looking for Jesus; Jesus came looking for him. He was gloriously saved and then he became “our beloved brother Paul.” Right? Not exactly, not according to the Scriptures.\n\nAfter Paul was saved, he was living and growing as a believer with the community of disciples in Damascus. He finally left there and the Bible says, “And when he had come to Jerusalem, he attempted to join the disciples. And they were all afraid of him, for they did not believe that he was a disciple.” At that point, it sounds like he was “our scary brother Paul.” We understand why they would be afraid, right? But I think the larger point here is that we all have stories and some are scarier than others. We all came from lives wrecked by sin, even if our sin did not express itself in dramatic ways as it did with Saul and many others. Never underplay the miracle of your salvation, and that God brought you from a mighty long way as the old Gospel song said. We were all “dead in our trespasses and sins, following the course of this world…but God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved.” And here’s something we learn from Peter’s words about Paul: we are called to be both the speakers and the hearers of truth.\n\nPaul clearly and boldly spoke the truth to Peter one day, and Peter humbly heard it from him.\n\nI love the story in Galatians 2 because it tells me so much about these two pillars of the faith. Peter was not a perfect Christian. He had fallen into self-deception and was even being used by the enemy to turn other men of faith, at least Barnabas for one, away from the truth of the Gospel. It was a public sin that was misleading the church and so Paul confronted Peter publicly, “before them all.” We know that Peter repented; if he hadn’t his two letters would not have been written. We also know that Peter received this instruction from a man younger in the faith, a man who had not walked with Jesus for 3 years, and a man who had a horrific past. But Peter listened and turned from his sin.\n\nThe church and the witness of the Gospel could have been badly damaged in those days if Paul had not had the spiritual courage to confront Peter, the powerful preacher and apostle. And the church would have been badly damaged if Peter had not repented when confronted with the truth about his hypocrisy.\n\nBeloved, the church universal will prevail and Jesus will return to gather all of his sheep and shepherds. But local churches are diminished or destroyed when leaders turn away from the Scriptures and will not listen to those who come to them with pleas and prayers and biblical truth."
