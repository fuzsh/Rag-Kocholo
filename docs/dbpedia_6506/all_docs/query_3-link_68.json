        "text": "A typical sugar cane has nearly 11% sugar, 30% bagasse and balance water. A conventional sugar mill crushes sugar cane and produces sugar and sells molasses and surplus bagasse and therefore unable to withstand market fluctuations in sugar price. The Integrated cane Processing Project (ICPP) concept, envisages simultaneous generation of electricity and ethanol either from molasses or directly from cane juice. It is also possible to recover and use water from sugar cane. Thus the ICPP would have adequate flexibility to tune up production according to market dynamics Moreover, it is possible to get more revenue by selling more surplus power beyond the crushing season which is the period of peak demand of the Grid."
