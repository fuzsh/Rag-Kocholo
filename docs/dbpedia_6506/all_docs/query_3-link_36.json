        "text": "I really wonder how the recruitment of drivers is done in the F1 drivers academy and also other series (not talking about F1 academy series), because some are recruited with less results than others on the market and with very ordinary profiles which in the end do not even bring benefits including marketing to the teams or in another way. It's like nobody is scouting properly talents but just doing it between friends behind closed doors. Unfortunately this is still done to the detriment of diversity (taking women does not solve the problem of excluding 70% of the world population Africa/Asia, it's just an easy and cover up solution to keep excluding people). I hope that in future F1 and FIA will change this #F1 #diversity #driveracademy #gamechanger\n\nIt was a hot topic through both pre-season tests in 2022, but what is porpoising in F1? And what effect does it have on both car and driver? In a bid to decrease the dirty air in the wake of an F1 car, The FIA has thrown open the use of the underbody of the car to generate downforce. An F1 car needs downforce to stay firmly on the track and not take off like an aeroplane. #WhatIsPorpoisingInF1\n\nUnderstanding the \"why\" ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘‡ It's not about who's right/wrong. It's about preparing in a way that sets you up for success and allows you to enjoy the process along the way. #W1N #NBA #ballislife #ChefCurry #warmup #basketballtraining\n\nThe prevalence of multi-year contracts among F1 drivers is explained in this issue of the Business of Motorsport. You will also hear why Rwanda thinks they deserve F1, the likelihood of the World Rally Championship returning to America and how IMSA is moving beyond convergence. All this and much more. #businessofsport #motorsportlaw https://lnkd.in/eRKW3JF6\n\nThe prevalence of multi-year contracts among F1 drivers is explained in this issue of the Business of Motorsport.
