        "text": "Manufacturer Of Sugar, Power & Distillery Products\n\nSugar is produced by the evaporation of the juice that is extracted from the crushed cane. This is widely used as a sweetener in food and beverages. Interestingly, in a country like India, sugar is also emerging as an index of upward mobility. For instance, as income rise in rural India , consumers migrate from the consumption of alternative sweeteners, towards sugar. The principal portion of sugar sold within India is loose and packaged.\n\nAn Integrated Cane Processing Plant\n\nThe Integrated cane Processing Plant (ICPP) concept, envisages simultaneous generation of electricity and ethanol either from molasses or directly from cane juice. It is also possible to recover and use water from sugar cane. Thus the ICPP would have adequate flexibility to tune up production according to market dynamics.\n\nCARBON CREDITS\n\nClean Development Mechanism :\n\nPower plant and the Distillery plant situated at Gangakhed is under the validation process for the registration under Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).\n\nCDM benefits\n\nProjects that reduce GHG (Green House Gases) can claim for benefits under UN legislation \"Kyoto Protocol\". For a project to qualify for CDM (Clean development mechanism) benefits it must generate renewable energy and the electricity supplied must displace the existing grid based power.\n\nThe benefits endowed are the reduction in carbon emission resulting into quantum of electricity supplied to the grid. Since, G7Sugar Limited. produces biomass based co-gen power, it is a clean technology plant and is eligible to earn carbon credits After the validation, the Company is projected to earn additional revenue year on year."
