        "text": "Amrita was the first recipient of the Punjab Rattan Award conferred upon her by Punjab Chief Minister Capt. Amarinder Singh.\n\nShe was also the first female recipient of the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1956 for Sunehadey (poetic diminutive of the Punjabi word (Sunehe), Amrita Pritam received the Bhartiya Jnanpith Award, India's highest literary award, in 1982 for Kagaj te Canvas (Paper and Canvas).\n\nFor her eminent work, she had received the Padma Shri (1969) and Padma Vibhushan, India's second-highest civilian award, and Sahitya Akademi Fellowship, India's highest literary award, also in 2004.\n\nShe had also received D.Litt. honorary degrees, from many Universities like Delhi University (1973), Jabalpur University (1973), and Vishwa Bharati (1987).\n\nShe also received the international Vaptsarov Award from the Republic of Bulgaria (1979) and Degree of Officer dens, Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (Officier) by the French Government (1987). She was nominated as a member of Rajya Sabha 1986–92.\n\nDuring the end of her life, she was been awarded by Pakistan's Punjabi Academy, to which she had remarked, Bade dino baad mere Maike ko meri Yaad aayi.(My motherland has remembered me after a long time); and also Punjabi poets of Pakistan, sent her a chaddar, from the tombs of Waris Shah, and fellow Sufi mystic poets Bulle Shah and Sultan Bahu.\n\nCelebrated poet and novelist Amrita Pritam is one of the most recognized Punjabi authors of the 20th century. Although she has more than 100 books to her credit, she is best known for her novel Pinjar. Amrita Pritam wrote in Punjabi and Hindi, but her works have been translated into many languages, including Danish, Japanese, French and Mandarin.\n\nThis interview was conducted in Hindi and Urdu by my grandmother’s sister, Mukti Verma, who is 85 years old today. Her writer husband and she were friends with Amrita Pritam and growing up, I often heard the names of Amrita and Imroz at their home in Delhi.\n\nLet's take some inspiration from Amrita Pritam's Life Incidents :\n\nShe said \"The most important thing in life is happiness. But then so much of what we go through in life depends upon our ruling planets. You know our elders chanted on a 108-bead string. If you consider the real reason they did this, you will realize it is the chanting of 12 zodiac signs and 9 planets i.e. 12x9 = 108. These 108 planets travel throughout the universe and influence our lives.\"\n\nAn Incident of Amrita's life that would make you cry:\n\nAmrita Pritam crying with tears said, \"When, I was very young and was crying near my mother’s bed as she was on her last breath. One of my friends came by and bid me thus—Amrita, wake up. Don’t cry. God always listens to children. Go! Pray to God for your mother’s life.\" I got up and started praying fervently for my mother’s life, but maybe her time was up and she passed away. My prayer was not accepted by the almighty. This incident left a lasting impression on my mind. After that, when anyone asked me if there was a God, I would answer—“No, if God were there, wouldn’t he have listened to a child’s implorations?\"\n\nShe added saying, \"I consider astrology to be a complete science. These planets, constellations, hold a special place in our lives. The more immersed you are in the understanding of this science, the more accurate your calculations will be. So much of what we go through is written in the stars.\"\n\n\"I do not decry the importance of science. I do believe that scientific discoveries have done many wonderful things for us"
