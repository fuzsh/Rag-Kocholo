        "text": "Sahitya Akademi was established on 12 March 1954 with prime objective of promoting literary work in Indian Languages. On the 7 January 1956 Akademi was registered under society registration act 1860. In all 22 Indian languages included to Eight schedule of Indian constitution, Akademi is awarding annual Sahitya Akademi Award for outstanding literary work in each language since 1955.\n\nSince the 2009 Sahitya Akademi Award in each language include a cash reward of Rs. One Lakh and Citation [Plaque designed by famous film maker Satyajit Ray]. Sahitya Akademi also awards Fellowship considered as top most literary recognition in country.\n\nBhasha Sanman Puraskar\n\nTranslation Award (Click Here for complete list of Sindhi Translation Award Winners)\n\nYuva Puraskar\n\nBal Sahitya Award\n\nare also awarded by Akademi annually.\n\nAfter the partition, in multilingual country India, this was a long struggle to get recognition for Sindhi language as here Sindhis were fighting for resettlement of life and that too in isolated and dispersed population. Thanks to efforts taken by Sindhi Sahitya Mandal one of the pioneer literary body of Sindhis in India, Sindhi language was taken in consideration as the recognized language for the program on All India Radio & Sindhi literature for the Sahitya Academy Award highest literary award of the country in the year 1957. This might be noted that Sindhi language was included to eight schedules of Indian constitution on 10 April 1967 as the fifteenth language.\n\nTirth Basant was the first to receive this award only in 1959 for the biography of Bhagat Kanwarram another significant thing about this award is that between 1960 – 1963 and in the years 1965, 1967, 1975, 1977 and 1992 no one was honoured with this prestigious award. This might be a unique thing for Sindhi language that three sindhi couples’ husband & wife both are felicitated with country’s highest literary award – Sahitya Akademi Award. Moti Prakash (1988) & Kala Prakash (1994) were the first, followed by Harish Vaswani (1987) & Indira Vaswani (2012) and Krishna Rahi (1971) & Maya Rahi (2015) are the most recent on list.\n\n2021 New Addition\n\nWe are including cover page photo of books written by individual on the concerned Biography page. If you have book of any of these literary personality and photo of that book is not displayed on Biography page do whatsaap (+917588661857) cover page photo to us.\n\nSindhiyat Suhini Rahe\n\nS.P. Sir (Manghirmalani) Kolhapur"
