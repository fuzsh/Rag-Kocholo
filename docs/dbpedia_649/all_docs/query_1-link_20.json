        "text": "Premchand (1880-1936) is remembered as one of the greatest writers of fiction in Hindi and Urdu. The established literary merit of his work is complemented by his historical importance as the fountainhead of modern Hindi fiction. Premchand was also of political and cultural significance as a writer on social oppression, religious change and the various Indian struggles against colonial rule. This biography, originally published in Hindi in 1962, has been widely acknowledged as the definitive life of Premchand. It is also a sourcebook for anyone who wishes to understand the origins and milieu of Hindi and Urdu writing in the 20th century. The Hindi edition of this biography won the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1963."
