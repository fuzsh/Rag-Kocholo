        "text": "Aamir Khan was born on March 14, 1965 in Mumbai. He is one of the most successful Indian Bollywood actors who is also known as \"Mr. Perfectionist of Bollywood\". With his recent successes in both the Indian and Chinese film markets, he has shouldered his way into becoming one of the world's biggest superstars. Undergoing rapid transformations in his body structure to better embody the variegated characters in his energetic films, Aamir has garnered praise from all parts of the globe. His most visible transformations can be seen in such movies as Lagaan (2001), Fanaa (2006), Taare Zameen Par (2007), Ghajini (2008), 3 idiots (2009), Talaash (2012), Dhoom 3 (2013), PK (2014), Dangal (2016) and Secret Superstar (2017). His recent successes with movies like Dangal, PK , Talaash and TV serial Satyamev Jayate have attracted attention from more serious moviegoing crowds. However, he is perhaps better known for his fabulous comedic roles, as exemplified by his iconic performances in cult comedies such as Andaz Apna Apna, Passion, and Dil Chahta Hai, to name a few. Aamir is also no slouch at TV commercial work.\n\n2001's Lagaan released in China nationwide, beginning what would be a series of Aamir Khan films that would firmly plant Indian filmmaking into the minds of Chinese audiences. 3 Idiots became a cult hit in China farther along in the 2000's, followed by Like Stars on Earth and Ghajini, both of which went on to gain huge followings. Aamir Khan's streak of Chinese box office hits continued into and throughout the 2010's with the rapid-fire release of Dhoom 3 (2013), PK (2014), Dangal (2016) and Secret Superstar (2017).\n\nAamir was first introduced as a child artist in the 1970's hit Yaadon Ki Baaraat (1973) - he was the youngest child in the trio.\n\nHis performance in Earth (1998) as the Ice-Candy man has received rave reviews from Indian and international critics. Using classic \"method acting\" and an adopted technique inspired by his seniors Sanjeev Kumar, Rajesh Khanna, Dev Anand and Shammi Kapoor, Aamir acts in all genres of Indian films - comedy, action, drama and romance. He is regarded as a complete Indian actor of the post 1990 generation of actors for his diverse choice of roles and films. In 2007 he turned director with the film Taare Zameen Par: Ein Stern auf Erden (2007), which not only brought him immense critical acclaim but was also a huge box office success. Many of his films are considered as cult classics like Lagaan - Es war einmal in Indien (2001), Dil Chahta Hai (2001), Rang De Basanti - Die Farbe Safran (2006), Der Sieg deines Lebens (1992) and Andaz Apna Apna (1994). He divorced his first wife Reena Dutta on December 09, 2001 and married Kiran Rao in December 28, 2005 and divorced her on July 03, 2021.\n\nIn 2008 his first all out commercial action film Ghajini (2008) went on to become the highest grossing film of its time in Indian Cinema and 4th highest inflation adjusted, grossing a total of Rs.226 on the worldwide box office and the first film to cross 100 crores on the domestic Indian box office, making a total of Rs.115 crores. This record didn't last long, though, since his next release 3 Idiots (2009) went on to shatter not only the highest grosser record but many more. It not only made the highest opening first day, first weekend and first week records but subsequently continued to shatter many records on the following weekends and weeks, making many circuits on the way. It made a total of Rs.202 crores domestically and Rs.400 crores on the worldwide box office, becoming the highest overseas grosser to date, a staggering feat given that no other film had even come close to making Rs.100 crores on the domestic box office until then, except for his own Ghajini (2008) the previous year.\n\nAamir is said to be the actor who first started the trend of actors working in one film at a time, when the others worked in four or five at the same time. He is also known to shun popular film trade magazine awards like Filmfare, Star Screen, etc. as he doesn't have trust in their credibility and transparency. Recently he was awarded the third highest civilian honor Padama Bhushan by the government of India.\n\nAamir's expansive range of characterizations remains unparalleled amongst his contemporaries. Because of this diversity and his formidable ability to portray different characters believably on screen, he is today regarded not only as one of the biggest stars in Bollywood but also as one of the finest actors in all of Indian Cinema.\n\nAsrani was born in a middle class Sindhi family. His father migrated to Jaipur after the Partition of India and opened a shop selling carpets. He has four sisters and three brothers: two elder and one younger. Asrani was highly uninterested in business and very weak in mathematics. He completed his matriculation from St. Xaviers School and did his graduation from Rajasthan College, Jaipur. He simultaneously worked as a voice artist on All India Radio, Jaipur, to pay for his education. His ultimate aim was to become an actor.\n\nHe began to learn acting from Sahitya Kalbhai Thakkar from 1960 to 1962. In 1962, he traveled to Bombay and began to seek opportunities to act. In 1963, Hrishikesh Mukherjee advised him to learn acting professionally. In 1964 Asrani joined the Film Institute in Poona (now Film and Television Institute of India, Pune) and finished his course in 1966. He impressed many others and made his acting break in 1967 with a Gujrati movie opposite budding actress Waheeda (not Waheeda Rahman, the Hindi actress). He acted in four other movies, mainly as actor or supporting actor in Gujrati from 1967 to 1969. His debut film in Hindi was Hare Kaanch Ki Chudiyaan where he appeared as Biswajeet's friend. He acted in Khoon Pasina, marking a serious role other than comedy. It was from 1971 that he started getting more offers as the main comedian in films or as the close friend of the lead actor. He did 96 movies from 1972-79.Directors like Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Atma Ram, Gulzar repeatedly cast him in the period 1971-1974 and his work got noticed through these films as they were hits. These roles he did from 1971-1974 set the tone for a number of supporting and comic roles in his career and in 70's his demand was at its peak as he appeared in 101 films from 1970-1979 and had effective roles in them.He was hugely talked about in the 1970s and is one of Rajesh Khanna's close friends.He worked with Rajesh Khanna in 25 films which includes 21 hit films.\n\nIn the 1980s, he acted in over 107 films. Unlike his roles in 1970-84 which were pivotal to the plot, most of his roles from 1985-1993 were very minor mainly because the concept of a comedian was getting phased out and heroes preferred to do their own comedy and action films were ruling the roost in the period 1985-1994. Simultaneously he kept working in Gujrathi films in 70's, 80's as lead hero and achieved success as the lead protagonist in Amdavad No Rikshawalo, Saat Qaidi, Sansar Chakra, Pankhi No Malo, Jugal Jodi, Maa Baap, Chel Chabilo Gujarati. From 90's he played as comedian or supporting actor in Gujrathi films like Mota Ghar Ni Vahu, Piyu Gayo Pardesh, Baap Dhamal Dikhra. During this period in 1982, he set up a small Gujrati production company with fellow artistes Dinesh Hingoo, Harish Patel and Salim Parvez (son of famous supporting actor Yunus Parvez). The company dissolved in 1996 with a large profit. Asrani also invested mainly in cloth and acted as investor for other actors, until 1991 when he lost a lot of money. From 1988 to 1993, he was a director for the Film Institute in Pune. In 90's he did only 73 Hindi movies due to lack of good scope for him to perform. Muqabla (1993) saw him in a serious role after long time. D.Rama Naidu gave him a pivotal role to Asrani in Taqdeerwala in 1995 and once again comedy movies were being made from thereon . Asrani started getting good roles in films directed by David Dhawan and Priyadarshan from 1993 till 2012. The 2000s saw Asrani in a number of blockbuster films like Hera Pheri, Chup Chup Ke, Hulchul and Deewane Huye Pagal. He appeared in a serious role in Kyun Ki. He was an integral part of comedies by Sajid Nadiadwala, Priyadarshan after 2000. His screen space in films of Rohit Shetty and others has got reduced gradually after 2009,Worked in a Bagheli film for the first time by playing the role of a Ticket Conductor (TC) in superstar Avinash Tiwari's film 'Kunwarapur' (2024).\n\nAnupam Kher is a renowned Indian actor who has worked extensively in the Indian film industry, as well as in international films and television shows.
