A prolific writer, Rai made his literary debut with novel Beej in 1952, (1952), and went on to write an acclaimed biography of his father, Premchand, Kalam ka Sipahi (1970), which later won him the Sahitya Akademi award for 1971.\n\nCareer\n\nHe also co-edited Chitthi Patri (1962), a two-volume book on the letters of Premchand along with his biographer, Madan Gopal. In 1982, he donated a collection of his father\"s 236 letters to the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library (NMML) at Teen Murti House, Delhi. His A House Divided is an influential account of how the shared Hindi/Hindavī (हिन्दवी, ہندوی) linguistic tradition became differentiated into Modern Standard Hindi and Urdu.\n\nRai died in Allahabad, in September 1996 at the age of 75, after suffering a paralytic stroke in March 1996."
