        "text": "Starting in 1954, every year, Sahitya Akademi Award prizes are conferred to the writer for their most exceptional books. The books are of literary merit and released in any of the 24 major Indian languages. As per the Government of India Resolution, the main purpose of the award is to appreciate the literature and to recognise the novel trends in the field of Indian literature. The award consists of a cash prize and a plaque. Since the initiation of the award, the cash prize has been ₹ 5,000 till the year 1982. The cash prize has been increased to ₹ 10,000 from 1983. It has been 25,000 ₹ from 1988, ₹ 40,000 from 2001, ₹ 50,000 from 2003, and currently it is ₹ 1,00,000 from the year 2009.\n\nOutline about Sahitya Akademi\n\nSahitya Akademi Awards is the second-highest honour in the field of literature in India. The Sahitya Academy plaque was designed by Satyajit Ray. He was an Indian filmmaker. Before this plaque, the plaque was composed of marble. The Government of India Resolution always ensured that the literary standards had to be set high for the development of the country in the literature field. Given the outline of Sahitya Akademi, the Sahitya Akademi Library is one of the best and most important multilingual libraries in India. The estimated collection of books in this library is around 2,00,000. The books are available here in 24 languages in all the fields. There is a separate collection of books by Rabindranath Tagore, Mahatma Gandhi, and Sri Aurobindo. It has a large collection of books based on philosophy, art, culture, religion, fiction, conspiracies and beyond. Although the Sahitya Akademi was set up by the Government of India Resolution, it is functioning as an autonomous institute.\n\nLiterary honours in Sahitya Akademi\n\nThe Sahitya Akademi Fellowships, Bhasha Samman, Sahitya Akademi Prize for Translation, Yuva Puraskar, Bal Sahitya Puraskar, Golden Jubilee Awards, Premchand Fellowship, and Ananda Coomaraswamy Fellowships are the literary honours in Sahitya Akademi. The Bhasha Samman Award is conferred to the authors for their immense contribution to the Indian languages, which are not part of the 24 recognised ones. The Sahitya Akademi Prize for Translation is given to them for their exceptional translation works. A ₹50,000 cash prize is also awarded along with the plaque. The Yuva Puraskar is given to young writers for their extraordinary work. It is given to the deserving authors under the age of 35 years to encourage and appreciate them. The award consists of a copper plaque and a ₹50,000 cash prize. The Golden Jubilee Awards are awarded for outstanding work of translating poetry from Indian languages. Premchand Fellowship was initiated in 2005 and is conferred to individuals having eminent skills in the field of culture.\n\nIt should be noted that this fellowship is for SAARC countries. Ananda Coomaraswamy Fellowships was initiated in the year 1996. It is conferred to the scholars from countries of Asia to spend 3 to 12 months period in India to accomplish a project related to literature.\n\nConclusion\n\nSahitya Akademi confers 24 awards every year for the prominent work in literature in the recognised languages. It gives an equal number of awards to literary translations. The translations are from one recognised Indian language to another recognised Indian language. The Akademi has also established its centres for Translation in Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Delhi, and Kolkata. Many more crucial and interesting projects in the field of literature are on their way."
