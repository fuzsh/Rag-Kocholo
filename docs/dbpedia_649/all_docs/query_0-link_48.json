We aimed to examine the effect of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and anti-inflammatory diet in inducing remission followed by long-term maintenance with anti-inflammatory diet in patients with mild-moderate UC.\n\nDesign This open-labelled randomized controlled trial (RCT), randomized patients with mild-moderate (simple clinical colitis activity index [SCCAI] 3 – 9) endoscopically active UC (ulcerative colitis endoscopic index of severity [UCEIS] >1) on stable baseline medications in 1:1 ratio to FMT and anti-inflammatory diet (FMT-AID) vs. optimized standard medical therapy (SMT). FMT-AID arm received 7 weekly colonoscopic infusions of freshly-prepared FMT from multiple rural donors (week 0–6) with anti-inflammatory diet. Baseline medications were optimized in SMT arm. Clinical responders (decline in SCCAI >3) at 8 weeks in both arms were followed till 48 weeks on baseline medications (with anti-inflammatory diet in FMT-AID arm). Primary outcome measures were clinical response and deep remission (clinical-SCCAI <2 and endoscopic-UCEIS <1) at 8 weeks, and deep remission and steroid free clinical remission at 48 weeks.\n\nResults Of 113 patients screened, 73 were randomized, and 66 were included in (35-FMT-AID; 31-SMT) modified intention-to-treat analysis (age-35.7+11.1 years; males-60.1%; disease duration-48 [IQR:24–84] months; pancolitis-34.8%; SCCAI-6 [IQR:5–7]; UCEIS-4 [IQR:3–5]) (Fig. 1). Baseline characteristics were comparable. FMT-AID was superior to SMT in inducing clinical response (23/35 [65.7%] vs. 11/31 [35.5%], p=0.01, OR-3.5 [95% CI:1.3–9.6]), remission (21/35 [60%] vs. 10/31[32.3%], p=0.02, OR-3.2 [95% CI:1.1 – 8.7]), and deep remission (12/33 [36.4%] vs. 2/23 [8.7%], p=0.03, OR-6.0 [95% CI:1.2 – 30.2]) at 8 weeks. Anti-inflammatory diet was superior to SMT in maintaining deep remission till 48 weeks (6/24 [25%] vs. 0/27, p=0.007) (Figs. 2 and 3).\n\nConclusion Multi-donor FMT with anti-inflammatory diet effectively induced deep remission in mild-moderate UC which was sustained with anti-inflammatory diet over one year.\n\nKeywords Diet, Fecal microbiota transplantation, Standard medical therapy, Ulcerative colitis\n\n002\n\nGut microbial dysbiosis, gut barrier integrity, and severity of chronic pancreatitis: exploring a mechanistic link using an experimental model\n\nAmbika Prasanna , Aparna Jakkampudi, Priyanka Sarkar, Ranjit Tokala, Subhaleena Sarkar, Sreelatha Chintaluri, Nageshwar Reddy, Rupjyoti Talukdar\n\nCorrespondence – Rupjyoti Talukdar - rup_talukdar@yahoo.com\n\nDepartment of Medical Gastroenterology; Welcome DBT Indian Alliance Labs., Asian Institute of Gastroenterology, 6-3-661, Somajiguda, Hyderabad 500 082, India\n\nPancreatic diseases such as pancreatitis, contribute to marked morbidity and mortality. Recent studies have suggested a link between gut microbial dysbiosis and chronic pancreatitis (CP), but the potential roles of the microflora and the immune system that play a crucial role in maintaining the homeostasis have not been fully elucidated in CP in a mechanistic manner. In this study, we report the changes that occur in the gut microbiome along with the other metabolic factors in the L-Arginine model of CP in a time dependent progressive manner. Along with that, we also evaluated the role of high fat diet in CP disease progression and the gut microbial alterations associated in aggravating the disease.\n\nOne of the key findings of this study was the early development of the fibrogenesis (p=< 0.01) in the CPHFD group caused due to diet modulation that continued to remain same until severe CP developed. These findings showed significant correlation of fibrosis score (% area) with relative abundances of few bacterial species including Prevotella copri.\n\nKeywords Chronic pancreatitis, Gut barrier, Gut microbial dysbiosis\n\n003\n\nPrevalence of celiac disease in patients with liver diseases: A systematic review and meta-analyses\n\nShakira Yoosuf 1 , Prashant Singh 2 , Ashank Khaitan 1 , Tor Strand 3 , Vineet Ahuja 1 , Govind K Makharia 1\n\nCorrespondence – Shakira Yousuf - shakira891@gmail.com\n\n1Department of Gastroenterology and Human Nutrition, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Sri Aurobindo Marg, Ansari Nagar, Ansari Nagar East, New Delhi 110 029, India, 2University of Michigan, USA, and 3Innlandet Hospital Trust\n\nIntroduction A subset of patients with celiac disease (CeD) have liver involvement in the form of hypertransaminsemia, liver cirrhosis and autoimmune hepatitis. We conducted a systematic review with meta-analyses to determine pooled prevalence of CeD in patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis, all-cause cirrhosis, cryptogenic hypertransaminsemia, and all-cause hypertransaminsemia.\n\nMethods We searched PubMed and EMBASE up to January 2022. Cross-sectional, case-control and prospective cohort studies performing serological tests and/or intestinal biopsy for CeD on patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis, all-cause cirrhosis, cryptogenic hypertransaminsemia and all-cause hypertransaminsemia were included, to calculate pooled estimates of seroprevalence and prevalence of biopsy-confirmed CeD in these four groups.\n\nResults Of 6871 articles screened, 20 articles were included finally in three meta-analyses for cryptogenic cirrhosis, all-cause cirrhosis and cryptogenic hypertransaminsemia. For the all-cause hypertransaminsemia group, a qualitative review of four studies was done instead of a meta-analysis, due to significant differences in studies. The pooled seroprevalence and prevalence (95% CI) of biopsy confirmed CeD in cryptogenic cirrhosis were 15.3% (4.9-29.5%) and 4.6% (2.2-7.5%), respectively. Pooled seroprevalence and prevalence of biopsy confirmed CeD in all-cause cirrhosis were 14.2% (3.9-28.8%) and 0.8% (0-3.4%), respectively. Pooled seroprevalence and prevalence of biopsy-confirmed CeD in cryptogenic hypertransaminsemia were 7.7% (4.7-11.4%) and 5.7% (3.2-8.8%), respectively.\n\nConclusion Nearly one in 20 patients each with cryptogenic cirrhosis and cryptogenic hypertransaminsemia have CeD, hence they should both be considered high-risk groups for CeD. While prevalence of CeD in all-cause cirrhosis is similar to that in general population, it may be worth screening them for CeD as liver pathology has potential for reversal in them.\n\nKeywords Celiac disease, Liver\n\n004\n\nLong-term safety and efficacy of azathioprine in the management of inflammatory bowel disease: A real-world experience\n\nRohan Yewale, Balakrishnan S Ramakrishna, Babu Vinish D, Kayalvizhi Jayaraman\n\nCorrespondence – Rohan Yewale - rohan2690@gmail.com\n\nInstitute of Gastroenterology, Hepatobiliary Sciences and Transplantation, SRM Institute for Medical Science, Vadapalani, Chennai 600 026, India\n\nBackground Azathioprine (AZA) is used to maintain remission in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Both patients and caregivers harbor apprehensions regarding long-term efficacy and safety of AZA in IBD. We analyzed AZA use and outcomes in a mixed cohort of IBD patients followed up over a long period of time.\n\nMethods Long-term compliance, tolerance, clinical-outcome at last follow-up, type, and duration to onset of adverse-events, and subsequent amendment to treatment, with regard to AZA, were analyzed retrospectively in a cohort of 472 patients with IBD under treatment at a single center in south India between 2013-2022.\n\nResults 320/472 patients (207 Crohn’s disease [CD], 113 ulcerative colitis [UC]) received AZA with a median follow-up of 41 months (IQR 15.5-77.5). Total duration of AZA exposure was 1,359 patient-years with median duration of AZA usage of 33 months (IQR 11.75-60). 26.9% received AZA for >5 years. Mean initiation and maximum doses of AZA were 0.97 mg/kg/day and 1.72 mg/kg/day, respectively. 20.6% experienced side-effects, myelotoxicity (7.2%) and gastro-intestinal intolerance (5.6%) being most common. 6 patients developed malignancy. 39.4% of side-effects were dose-dependent and abated after dose modification or temporary withdrawal of AZA. 38.1% had clinical relapses while on AZA, requiring pulse corticosteroids. 72.7% attained durable clinical-remission (11.8% on AZA monotherapy, 53.1% on combination therapy with 5-ASA and 7.7% on combination therapy with biologics). 6.9% continued to have active disease and 20.4% had >1 relapse after commencement of AZA.\n\nConclusion AZA is safe, effective, and well tolerated in long-term management of patients with IBD.\n\nKeywords Azathioprine, Inflammatory bowel disease, Long-term efficacy\n\n005\n\nTransfusion related lung complications are uncommon in non-ventilated liver disease patients undergoing low-volume plasma exchange\n\nVijay Alexander , Jess Rasalam, Snehil Kumar, Vinoi David, Dolly Daniel, Sukesh Chandran, Kandasamy Subramani, Binila Chacko, Ebor Jacob, Lalji Patel, Santhosh Varughese, Vadivukkarasi Jayalakshmi, Kunwar Ashish, Uday Zachariah, Ashish Goel, Chundamannil Eapen\n\nCorrespondence – Chundamannil Eapen - eapen@cmcvellore.ac.in\n\nDepartment of Hepatology, Christian Medical College, Ida Scudder Road, Vellore 632 004, India\n\nBackground Plasma exchange (PLEX) is increasingly used to treat liver disease. We aimed to study transfusion related lung complications - transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI) and transfusion related circulatory overload (TACO), in patients undergoing low volume PLEX (PLEX-LV) to treat liver disease.\n\nMethods Prospectively accrued data of patients in our department who underwent PLEX-LV (50% of estimated plasma volume exchanged per PLEX session) for liver disease from 2016-2022 was retrospectively analyzed. Patients on ventilatory or oxygen support prior to PLEX were excluded. Incidence and cause of breathlessness during transfusion and within 6 hours of cessation of last transfusion of blood products used for PLEX were analyzed.\n\nResults Fifty-six (baseline ventilatory or oxygenation support required: 51, corona virus disease–19 [COVID-19] infection: 5) of 298 liver disease patients who underwent PLEX-LV during the study period were excluded. Two hundred and forty-two study patients (158 males; age: 38, 3 – 72 years; median, range, acute-on-chronic liver failure: 117, acute liver failure: 74) received 5197 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) during 779 PLEX-LV sessions.\n\nThree patients (1.2%, TACO: 2, pulmonary hemorrhage: 1), developed breathlessness within 6 hours of completion of any PLEX session. No patient had TRALI. Incidence of TACO was 0.3% (2/779) of PLEX-LV sessions and 0.04% (2/5197) of FFP units transfused during PLEX. All 3 patients died despite maximal supportive care.\n\nConclusion We found transfusion related lung complications to be uncommon in non-ventilated liver disease patients (most had liver failure) undergoing PLEX-LV. Careful attention to cumulative fluid balance may help reduce incidence of TACO further.\n\nKeywords Plasma exchange, TACO, TRALI\n\n006\n\nUpdated trends of inflammatory bowel disease from the global burden of disease study\n\nArshdeep Singh 1 , Khichdee Dharni 2 , Sonika Sharma 2 , Vandana Midha 1 , Ramit Mahajan 1 , Parambir S Dulai 3 , Ajit Sood 1\n\nCorrespondence – Ajit Sood - ajitsood10@gmail.com\n\n1Department of Gastroenterology, Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, Civil Lines, Tagore Nagar, Ludhiana 141 001, India, 2Punjab Agricultural University, Ferozepur Road, Ludhiana 141 027, India, and 3Feinberg School of Medicine, North-western University Chicago, IL, United States\n\nBackground The global burden of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been reported to be increasing. Methodologies and datasets are routinely updated, allowing for more accurate estimates. We report a comprehensive analysis of the disease burden and trends at the global and regional levels from 1990 to 2019, based on data from the updated Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019.\n\nMethods Incidence, prevalence, deaths, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were estimated from the GBD-2019 database. The three decadal trends of the disease measures were also calculated.\n\nResults In 2019, there were 4.9 million (4.3-5.5) cases of IBD globally. The age-standardized prevalence and incidence rates (per 100,000 population) decreased from 73.23 (63.8-83.6) and 6.1 (5.3-6.9) in 1990 to 59.2 (52.7-66.4) and 4.9 (4.4-5.6) in 2019, respectively. The highest age-standardized prevalence and incidence rates (per 100,000 population) were recorded in North America, while Oceania recorded the lowest rates (209.5 [195.4-224.4] and 24.5 [22.6-26.7], and 3.87 [3.1-4.7] and 0.5 [0.5-0.7], respectively). High sociodemographic index (SDI) locations had the highest age-standardized prevalence rate, though the rates declined in 2019 compared to 1990. Over the three decades, the age-standardized prevalence and incidence rates increased in the middle, low middle, and low SDI quintiles. The age-standardized rates for deaths, DALYs, YLDs, and YLLs decreased globally, from 1990 to 2019.\n\nConclusion This updated estimate from the GBD demonstrates an increasing disease burden of IBD in the middle and low SDI locations, while stabilization in the high SDI locations. Continuous monitoring and adjusting estimates may allow for region-specific policies, to address the challenges in tackling IBD.\n\nKeywords Incidence, Inflammatory bowel disease, Prevalence\n\nYoung Investigator Award Session\n\n007\n\nThe myth of hepatotropism of hepatitis B virus; Placenta a new home for the virus\n\nAshish Kumar Vyas\n\nCorrespondence – Ashish Kumar Vyas - a88_ashish@yahoo.co.in\n\nDepartment of Microbiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, AIIMS Campus Road, Saket Nagar, Habib Ganj, Bhopal 462 026, India\n\nBackground The transplacental routes of vertical transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) has been known for over a decade. Here we present evidence that suggests HBV can replicate in the placenta.\n\nMethods Forty-one HBsAg-positive pregnant women and 10 controls were enrolled in the study after obtaining informed consent. HBV positives were further divided into the high viral load (HVL) Group and low viral load (LVL) group according to Indian National Association for Study of the Liver (INASL) guidelines 2018. The presence of the HBV DNA in the placenta and expression of NTCP in the placenta was analyzed by qPCR/RT-qPCR and/or immunohistochemistry (IHC). The presence of HBeAg and HBcAg in the placenta was assessed by IHC.\n\nResults NTCP expression was significantly upregulated in trophoblasts of HVL compared to control and LVL groups. Immunostaining of NTCP, HBeAg, and HBcAg on trophoblasts along with the presence of HBV DNA indicated, that these cells are not only susceptible to HBV infection but may also support viral replication. This is further supported by the finding that trophoblasts of the several HBeAg seronegative samples harbored the HBeAg.\n\nConclusions The presence of the HBV receptor, NTCP in the placenta along with the presence of viral DNA, HBeAg in the placenta of patients without circulating HBeAg suggests that placenta act as a replication host.\n\nKeywords Hepatitis B virus, Vertical transmission, Placenta, Sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide\n\n008\n\nA double blind randomized controlled trial on role of nutritional therapy to prevent recurrence of hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhosis\n\nBarjesh Chander Sharma, Hardik Ahuja, Sanjeev Sachdeva, Bhawna Mahajan, Ashok Sharma, Sushma Bara, Siddharth Srivastava, Ajay Kumar, Ashok Dalal, Ujjwal Sonika\n\nCorrespondence – Hardik Ahuja - drhardikahuja@gmail.com\n\nDepartment of Gastroenterology, Govind Ballabh Pant Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, 1, J L N Marg, New Delhi 110 002, India\n\nBackground Overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) has high cumulative risk of recurrence and is associated with poor survival. The role of nutrition therapy is well documented in cirrhosis but its efficacy in preventing the recurrence of OHE has not been studied.\n\nMethods In this double blind randomized controlled trial (RCT), we randomly assigned 150 cirrhotics with history of OHE in the recent past to receive nutrition therapy (Group I) or no nutrition therapy (Group II) and followed up for 6 months. The primary efficacy end point was the time to first breakthrough episode of HE. The key secondary end points were the time to first hospitalization involving HE, improvement in health-related quality of life, anthropometry parameters, changes in serum cytokines (IL-1,6,10, TNF), endotoxin, myostatin, correlation of baseline arterial ammonia levels, psychometric tests score, critical flicker frequency, child’s score, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score with recurrence of OHE.\n\nResults There was significant reduction in the occurrence of breakthrough episode of HE in group I (10 vs. 36, hazard ratio [HR] 0.20 [95%] confidence interval [CI], 0.10 to 0.40; p<0.001), HE related hospitalization (8 vs. 24, HR 0.27 [95%] confidence interval [CI], 0.12 to 0.61; p<0.001), recurrence of HE (15 vs. 53, p<0.001) and mortality (0 vs. 5, p=0.04). Significant improvements in all parameters were seen at the end of 6 months. There was less incidence of MHE, ascites, gastrointestinal bleed and jaundice in Group I.\n\nConclusions Treatment with nutrition therapy prevented recurrence of OHE, decreased hospitalization and mortality as compared to no nutrition therapy.\n\nCTRI number: CTRI/2020/08/026993\n\nKeywords Ammonia, Health related quality of life, Minimal hepatic encephalopathy, Sarcopenia\n\n009\n\nCrosstalk between the host Gut mycobiome (fungome) and bacteriome with their glycemic status in chronic pancreatitis patients\n\nSreelekha Chintaluri , Priyanka Sarkar, Subhaleena Sarkar, Misbah Unnisa, Ambika Prasanna, Aparna Jakkampudi, Nageshwar Reddy, V V Ravikanth, Rupjyoti Talukdar\n\nCorrespondence – Rupjyoti Talukdar - rup_talukdar@yahoo.com\n\nDepartment of Medical Gastroenterology; Welcome DBT Indian Alliance Labs., Asian Institute of Gastroenterology, 6-3-661, Somajiguda, Hyderabad 500 082, India\n\nChronic pancreatitis is irreversible fibrotic pancreatic disease.

The present study evaluated clinical, biochemical, and molecular markers of PNR and SLR in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD).\n\nMethods This retrospective study included patients with IBD treated with anti-TNF-α agents from January 2005-October 2020. Data concerning clinical and biochemical predictors was retrieved from a prospectively maintained database. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for expression of oncostatin M (OSM), oncostatin M receptor (OSM-R) and Interleukin-7R (IL-7 R) receptor were done on pre-anti-TNF-α initiation mucosal biopsies obtained from IBD biorepository.\n\nResults One hundred-eighty-six patients (CD-118, UC-68) received anti-TNF-α therapy (mean age and median disease duration at anti-TNF-α initiation-34.1±13.7 years and 60 [IQR:28-100.5]) months. Primary non-response was seen in 17% and 26.5% and SLR in 47% and 28% of patients with CD and UC respectively. In CD, low albumin (HR [CI]: 0.07 [0.02-0.20], p<0.001), po stoperative recurrence (HR [CI]: 5.24 [1.9-14.5], p=0.001) and high IL-7R expression (HR [CI]:1.5 [1.04-2.15], p<0.027); and low albumin (HR [CI]: 0.09 [0.03-0.28], p<0.001) predicted PNR on univariate and multivariate analysis respectively. Low albumin (HR [CI]: 0.306 [0.15-0.62], p=0.001) also predicted SLR on multivariate analysis. In UC, low albumin (HR [CI]: 0.07 [0.03-0.20], p<0.001), high CRP (HR [CI]: 1.18 [1.07-1.29], p<0.001) and high OSM (HR [CI]: 1.44 [1.02-2.08], p value<0.04) and OSM-R (HR [95%CI]: 1.33 [0.97-1.81], p=0.07) stromal expression; and low albumin (HR [CI]: 0.108 [0.03-0.39], p=0.001) predicted PNR on univariate and multivariate analysis respectively.\n\nConclusion Low serum albumin prior to anti-TNF-α therapy initiation significantly predicted PNR in UC patients and PNR as well as SLR response in CD patients. Mucosal markers of PNR were high stromal OSM and OSM -R in UC and high IL7R in CD patients.\n\nKeywords Inflammatory bowel disease, Non-response, Tumor necrosis factor alpha\n\n011\n\nPatients with non-celiac gluten sensitivity exhibit site-specific gut microbial differences than those with irritable bowel syndrome\n\nKunal Dixit 1 , Anam Ahmed2, Dhiraj Dhotre3, Alka Singh2, Wajiha Mehtab4, Ashish Chauhan2, Vineet Ahuja2, Yogesh Shouche3, Govind K Makharia2\n\nCorrespondence – Govind K Makharia - govindmakharia@gmail.com\n\n1Symbiosis School of Biological Sciences, Sus-Pashan Road, Lavale, Pune 412 115, India, 2Department of Gastroenterology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Sri Aurobindo Marg, Ansari Nagar, Ansari Nagar East, New Delhi 110 029, India, 3National Centre for Cell Science, NCCS Complex, University of Pune Campus, Pune University Road, Ganeshkhind, Pune 411 007, India, and 4Department of Home Sciences, University of Delhi, South Moti Bagh, New Delhi 110 021, India\n\nObjective There is an overlap between symptoms of non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We explored the small intestinal, large intestinal and whole gut microbiota in them to understand if any difference exits in them and we further assess effect of gluten-free diet (GFD) on microbiota in NCGS.\n\nMethods Four hundred and ninety-two patients with IBS (based on Rome IV criteria) were screened for anti-gliadin Ab and diagnosis of NCGS in AGA positive individuals was made on the basis of Salerno criteria. Stool and mucosa-associated (small intestinal and colonic) microbiota was assessed in 130 patients with IBS (AGA negative) 14 patients with NCGS both at the baseline and 6 weeks after GFD to observe the effect of intervention on site specific microbiota profile. Microbiota was analyzed using 16S RNA gene amplicon profiling followed by downstream analysis by DADA2 pipeline and R statistics.\n\nResults NCGS patients exhibited differences in gut microbiota associated with small intestinal as compared to IBS.

Moreover, there was reduction in abundances of potential gluten-degrading genera and higher ratio of Prevotella to Burkholderia in duodenal mucosa, which can act as a biomarker for NCGS. There was an increase in bacterial networking and decrease in interindividual variability in the whole gut and site specific (small intestine) microbiota, respectively after GFD.\n\nConclusion Significant difference exits in small intestinal microbiota of NCGS patients. Six weeks GFD not only alleviates symptoms but also restores microbial diversity considerably.\n\nKeywords 16S rRNA sequencing, Gluten-free diet, Human microbiome, Mucosa-associated, Small intestine\n\n012\n\nSystematic estimation of prevalence of microsatellite instability and Lynch syndrome amongst colorectal cancer patients in India\n\nHarsh Sheth 1 , Abhinav Jain2,3, Chandini Patel1, Prachi Soni1, Mithun Shah3, Pankaj Shah3, Suresh Advani4, Liyana Thomas4, Vipul Yagnik5, Avinash Tank6, Chirag Shah7, Bhavesh Thakkar8, Darshan Bhansali8, Manish Gandhi8, Tarang Patel8, Natu Patel8, Ashok Patel8, Ruchir Patel2, Ravindra Gaadhe9, Chintan Shah10, Michael Jackson11, Mauro Santibanezkoref11, John Burn11, Jeynathy Eswaran11, Frenny Sheth1, Jayesh Sheth1, Sunil Trivedi1\n\nCorrespondence – Harsh Sheth - harsh.sheth@frige.co.in\n\n1Department of Advanced Genomic Technologies, FRIGE Institute of Human Genetics, FRIGE House, Jodhpur Village Road, Satellite, Ahmedabad 380 015, India, 2Gastro1 Hospital, Center Point, Near Vandematram Cross Road, Gota, Ahmedabad 382 470, India, 3Zydus Cancer Hospital, Zydus Hospital Road, Thaltej, Ahmedabad 380 054, India,4Sushrut Hospital, 365, Sant Vershaw Kakkaya Marg, Swastik Park, Chembur, Mumbai 400 071, India, 5Nishtha Surgical Hospital and Research Centre, 4th Line, Kilachand Shopping Centre, Station Road, Patan 384 265, India, 6Dwarika Clinic, 301 Shilp Arcade, Jodhpur Cross Road, Satellite, Ahmedabad 380 015, India, 7Mission Gastro Hospital, 6th Floor Golden Icon, Above Hundai Showroom Besides Qaraar Banquets, Ahmedabad 380 015, India, 8CIMS Hospital, Off.

A systematic genetic testing approach in accordance with the UK’s National Institute of Health and Care Excellence was utilized. Briefly, DNA from tumor biopsies were tested for MSI status followed BRAF V600E testing in samples which showed MSI-high result. Germline testing for the mismatch repair (MMR) genes was carried in patients who had MSI-high and BRAF V600E negative tumors.\n\nResults Mean age at cancer diagnosis across the cohort was 52.1 years with male to female ratio of 2:1 and 55% of the patients had tumors in the descending colon or rectum. MSI-high status was observed in 79 patients (40.7%) and, it was inversely associated with age (OR=0.95, 95% CI=0.92-0.97, p=<0.001) and cancers in distal colon and rectum (OR=0.49, 95% CI=0.24-1.00, p=0.05 for distal colon; OR=0.11, 95% CI=0.03-0.39, p=0.001 for rectum). Of these, 76 patients had BRAF V600E negative mutation status (96%). Of these patients, 48 were diagnosed with Lynch syndrome (63%; MLH1=38, MSH2=4, MSH6=4, PMS2=1, EPCAM=1). The variants c.154del and c.306G>T in the MLH1 gene were most commonly observed across Lynch syndrome patients in our cohort.\n\nConclusions This is the first systematic evaluation of the molecular epidemiology of CRC in India. We observe a high proportion of patients with young onset CRC coupled with high prevalence of MSI-high status and Lynch syndrome. The study results provide a unique opportunity to explore development of novel Lynch syndrome detection and cancer prevention pathway in Indian healthcare settings.\n\nKeywords Colorectal cancer, India, Lynch syndrome, Microsatellite instability, Prevalence\n\nPresidential Posters\n\n013\n\nLong-term gastrointestinal sequelae following Corona virus disease-19: A prospective follow-up cohort study\n\nRithvik Golla, Sudheer Kumar Vuyyuru, Bhaskar Kante, Peeyush Kumar, David Thomas Mathew, Saurabh Kedia, Govind K Makharia, Vineet Ahuja\n\nCorrespondence – Vineet Ahuja - vineet.aiims@gmail.com\n\nDepartment of Gastroenterology and Human Nutrition, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Sri Aurobindo Marg, Ansari Nagar, Ansari Nagar East, New Delhi 110 029, India\n\nBackground and Aims Corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19) is associated with long-term gastrointestinal sequalae; however prospective longitudinal data is sparse. We prospectively studied the frequency, spectrum, and risk factors of post infection functional gastrointestinal disorders/disorders of gut-brain interaction (PI-FGID/DGBI) following COVID-19.\n\nMethods Out of 416 cases with COVID-19, finally 320 cases with 320 healthy spouses/family controls (Group-A) and 280 healthy covid serology negative controls (Group B) were prospectively followed up at 1,3 and 6 months using validated Rome IV criteria to evaluate the frequency of PI-FGID/DGBI.\n\nResults Of 320 cases that had follow-up, at 1 month, 36 (10.9%) developed FGID symptoms. At 3 months, 27 (8.4%) and at 6 months, 21 (6.4%) persisted to have symptoms. At 3 months, 8 (2.5%) had irritable bowel syndrome, 7 (2.2%) had functional diarrhea, 6 (1.9%) had functional dyspepsia, 3 (0.9%) had functional constipation, 2 (0.6%) had FD-IBS overlap, and 1 (0.3%) had functional abdominal bloating/distension. Among the symptomatic at 3 months, 8 (29.6%) were positive for isolated carbohydrate malabsorption, 1 (3.7%) was positive for post infection malabsorption syndrome (PI-MAS) and 1 (3.7%) was positive for intestinal methanogen overgrowth (IMO). None of the healthy controls developed FGID until 6 months of follow-up (p<0.01). The predictive factors at 3 and 6 months were severity of infection (p<0.01) and presence of GI symptoms at time of infection (p<0.01).\n\nConclusion COVID-19 led to significantly higher number of new onset PI-FGID/DGBI as compared to healthy controls at 3 and 6 months of follow-up.

At 18 months patients underwent biochemical, hormonal assay, and semen analysis. Those patients with persistence of hypogonadism (n=17) and 10 healthy controls were analyzed for reactive oxygen species (ROS)- malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase, catalase, endotoxin.\n\nResults Mean age- 27.4 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 19-40 years). Fifteen patients were child A and 2 were Child B at 18 months. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism was seen in 12 and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism in 5. Sperm count was normal in 9 while 2 had severe oligospermia. Levels of reactive oxygen species were elevated in all patients with BCS however levels were significantly elevated (p=<0.05) for endotoxin (1.4 + 0.42 vs. 0.6 + 0.2), Catalase (1226.85 + 401.4 vs. 242.46 + 206.9). Superoxide dismutase levels were significantly depleted in patients with BCS as compared to healthy controls (3409.4 + 1376 vs. 4907 + 1605, p=0.0013). Although MDA is elevated in patients with BCS (541.16+ 150 vs. 489.17+ 100.26), levels did not reach significance.\n\nConclusion Hypogonadism can persist in male patients with BCS despite appropriate therapy and after a long follow-up period (18 months). There is definite evidence suggesting role of reactive oxygen species in the persistence of hypogonadism in these patients.\n\nKeywords Budd-Chiari syndrome, Hypogonadism, Oxidative stress\n\n015\n\nMucosal impedance spectroscopy: For objective real time assessment of mucosal health\n\nPriyanka Arora 1 , Jaspreet Singh 2 , Anuraag Jena 1 , Surinder Kumar 1 , Viren Sardana 3 , Siddhartha Sarkar 3 , Lileshwar Kaman 4 , Arunanshu Behera 4 , Divya Dahiya 4 , Ritambhara Nada 5 , Cherring Tandup 4 , H S Jatana 2 , Usha Dutta 1\n\nCorrespondence – Usha Dutta - ushadutta@gmail.com\n\nDepartments of 1Gastroenterology, 4Surgery, and 5Histopathology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Sector 12, Chandigarh 160 012, India, 2Semi Conductor Laboratory, Mohali, India, and 3Central Scientific Instrument Organization, Sector 30-C, Sector 30, Chandigarh 160 030, India\n\nAim To develop, design and validate a low-cost mucosal impedance (MI) device and determine its role in differentiating diseased mucosa from normal mucosa.\n\nMethods Biocompatible catheter was designed and developed after multiple iterations. It was validated with commercially available catheter and histopathological analysis in blinded manner. Patients undergoing resection of gastrointestinal tract were recruited after informed consent and resected specimens were analyzed ex vivo for MI, within 10 minutes of resection. Average of three MI readings of diseased segment and adjacent normal segment (whenever available) were analyzed. MI values of diseased and normal mucosa was compared by Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon sign ranked test was used for analysis of paired mucosal samples. A p value of <0.05 was considered to be significant.\n\nResults In-house catheter was validated with another commercially available impedance measuring device. It was found to show a high degree of positive correlation (rho=0.616; p<0.001). All diseased vs. normal of 232 patients (mean age 46±15 years [180 inflammatory pathology, 52 malignant pathology]) who were undergoing abdominal surgery were enrolled. Median impedance value of diseased segments was significantly lower than adjacent normal segments of gut in 130 paired samples studied (1832 [727] ohm vs. 2604 [1295] ohm; p<0.001). MI value of segments of gut containing malignant tissue (n=50) and inflammed tissue (n=80) was significantly lower than the MI value of adjacent normal segments of gastrointestinal tract (1880 [977] ohm vs. 2583 [1431] ohm; p<0.001) and (1787 [557] ohm vs. 2515 [1244] ohm; p<0.001) respectively. Median reduction in visually diseased segment was by 712 (661) ohm and percentage reduction was by 24% from adjacent normal segment.

In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) it is affected by many factors and can be present in patients even when in clinical remission. It has been implicated in various disease complications, affecting its prognosis.\n\nAims To study prevalence of sarcopenia in patients with IBD and factors associated with it.\n\nMethods Consecutive consenting patients with IBD between June 2021 and June 2022 were enrolled. Associated diseases that could contribute to sarcopenia were excluded. Anthropometric measurements, body mass index (BMI), and mid-arm muscle circumference were recorded. Muscle strength was measured by hand-grip strength (hand-held dynamometer), physical performance by gait speed (4-meters walk test) and muscle mass by measuring skeletal muscle index with single L3-level CT scan. As per European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People, 2018 definition, probable sarcopenia had low muscle strength), sarcopenia (low muscle strength and low muscle mass), and severe sarcopenia (low muscle strength, low muscle mass, and low physical performance). Factors associated with sarcopenia were studied.\n\nResults Of 117 patients (65 men; mean age 42.4 years [standard deviation 15.3]; 73 UC, 42 CD, 2 IBD-U), 40 (34.2%) patients had probable sarcopenia, 47 (40.2%) sarcopenia (29 UC, 18 CD) including 10 with severe sarcopenia. Ten (21.3%) patients with sarcopenia were in remission. On univariate analysis BMI, disease activity, hemoglobin, and biologic use showed significant association with sarcopenia; only BMI was significant on multivariate analysis.\n\nConclusion Sarcopenia was detected in 40% of patients with IBD; one-fifth of them were in clinical remission. Low BMI significantly correlated with occurrence of sarcopenia.\n\nKeywords IBD, Malnutrition, Sarcopenia\n\n017\n\nEarly (within two weeks) versus late percutaneous catheter drainage in patients with acute necrotizing pancreatitis\n\nPankaj Gupta, Harsimran Shah, Shameema Farook, Chaitanya Bendale, Anupam Singh, Jimil Shah, Jayanta Samanta, Harshal Mandavdhare, Vishal Sharma, Saroj Sinha, Usha Dutta, Manavjit Sandhu\n\nCorrespondence - Pankaj Gupta - pankajgupta959@gmail.com\n\nDepartment of Radiodiagnosis, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Sector 12, Chandigarh 160 012, India\n\nIntroduction Early drainage has been advocated in the management of the symptomatic pancreatic collection. However, there is a paucity of data on the safety and efficacy of early drainage. To compare the results of early (≤2 weeks) vs. late (>2 weeks) percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD) in patients with acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP).\n\nMethods This retrospective study comprised consecutive patients with ANP who underwent PCD in the first two weeks of illness. Matched controls that underwent PCD between the 3rd and 4th week of disease formed the comparison group. The technical success rate, clinical success rate, complications, and clinical outcomes were compared between the two groups.\n\nResults Seventy-four patients (median age, 37.1±12.7 years) comprised the study group (I). An equal number of patients with comparable baseline characteristics comprised the control group (II). The mean pain to PCD interval was 10.1±2.9 days in group I vs. 21.6±4.5 days in group II. The procedures were technically successful in all patients in both groups. The clinical success rate was 79.7% in group I vs. 93.2% in group II (p=0.069). There were 23 catheter-related complications (15 minor and 8 major). The incidence of complications was significantly higher in group I (n=17, 22.9%) than in group II (n=6, 8.1%) (p=0.013). Of the clinical outcomes, the need for surgery was significantly higher in group I than in group II (13 patients vs. five patients, p=0.031). All other clinical outcomes were comparable between the two groups.\n\nConclusion Early PCD within the first two weeks of illness is feasible, effective, and has an acceptable complication rate.\n\nKeywords Acute necrotizing, Catheters, Drainage, Pancreatitis,\n\n018\n\nStool multiplex molecular polymerase chain reaction assay in comparison to conventional stool tests in detecting gastrointestinal infections as cause of flares of inflammatory bowel disease\n\nManek Kutar , Devendra Desai, Philip Abraham, Tarun Gupta, Pavan Dhoble\n\nCorrespondence – Manek Kutar- mkutar07@gmail.com\n\nDepartment of Gastroenterology, P. D. Hinduja Hospital and Medical Research Center, Veer Savarkar Marg, Mahim, Mumbai 400 016, India\n\nIntroduction Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by intermittent and unpredictable flares. Other than natural history, flares can be caused by superadded gastrointestinal (GI) tract infections. Diagnosis of infection is conventionally made by microscopy and stool culture specimens. These are limited by lengthy turnaround time, low sensitivity, inability to detect agents other than bacteria and effect of pre-test antibiotic usage. Stool multiplex molecular polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (BioFire® FilmArray® GI Panel) allows simultaneous detection of nucleic acids from 23 bacteria, viruses and parasites.\n\nAims\n\n1. To compare infectious organisms detected by Biofire® FilmArray® test and conventional stool test (microscopy and culture) in IBD flare patients.\n\n2. Determine impact of detection of infective agents in the management of flares, as measured by use of anti-infective agents\n\nMethods Single center, prospective, cohort study. Inclusion criteria: Consenting patients above 18 years with IBD flare. Exclusion criteria: Colorectal cancer, toxic megacolon, intestinal perforation, previous IBD surgery. Sample size: 58.\n\nResults The following tables show organisms detected and change in management\n\nStool Biofire® showed better organism detection rate and more frequent need for change in management as compared to conventional tests. Comparative cost of conventional stool test cost was Indian rupee (₹) 4300 and that of stool Biofire® ₹ 12,000.\n\nConclusion Stool Biofire®, as compared to conventional stool tests, detected significantly more infective organism in IBD flare and resulted in 4-fold more change in management of the flare.\n\nKeywords Biofire, Flare, IBD\n\n019\n\n2D-Shear wave elastography: A novel non-invasive marker for differentiation between benign and malignant focal lesions of liver\n\nAditya Verma, Bony George, Srijaya S\n\nCorrespondence – Aditya Verma - Adi_cooldude08@yahoo.com\n\nDepartment of Medical Gastroenterology, Government Medical College, Ulloor-Akkulam Road, Chalakkuzhi, Thiruvananthapuram 695 011, India\n\nBackground Detection and characterization of focal liver lesions (FLLs) poses a frequent challenge in clinical practice. 2D-shear wave elastography (2D-SWE) is a recent technique which uses acoustic radiation force to induce mechanical vibrations and assess tissue elasticity.\n\nAims To study the elasticity characteristics of focal liver lesions by 2D shear wave elastography and to determine whether it can be used to differentiate benign from malignant lesions.\n\nMethods All patients with FLL underwent 2D-SWE and elasticity quantification. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings were used as the reference method for the diagnosis of FLLs.\n\nResults Two hundred and sixteen patients with FLL were evaluated by the 2D-SWE. 130 patients had malignant FLLs of which 90 had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 20 had intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC) and 20 had metastatic lesions. Of the 86 benign FLL, there were 36 hemangiomas, 12 FNH, 24 simple cysts, 4 complex cysts, and 10 abscesses. Mean liver stiffness of various lesions by 2D-SWE was 65.7 (IHCC), 60.5 (HCC), 45.4 (metastases), 7.6 (hemangioma), 16.9 (FNH), 9.14 (abscess), 8.62 (simple cyst) and 2.95 (complex cyst). ROC analysis revealed that a SWE cut off of 40 kPa could distinguish between benign and malignant lesions with sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 80%. (AUROC of 0.871). The lesion to background liver parenchyma stiffness ratio in cirrhotic patients was 4.81 for IHCC, 3.16 for metastasis and 1.93 For HCC. Therefore in cirrhotic patients, a lesion to liver stiffness ratio < 2 along with SWE of lesion more than 40 kpa favors HCC. However, in non-cirrhotic livers, there was no statistically significant difference between stiffness ratio of various malignant focal lesions.\n\nConclusion 2D-SWE could be used as a novel, non-invasive adjunct for the differentiation of benign and malignant focal lesions of liver.\n\nKeywords 2-D shear wave elastography, Focal lesion liver, Hepatocellular carcinoma\n\n020\n\nModel for end stage liver disease - Sarcopenia score for prediction of mortality in liver cirrhosis\n\nHitesh Ramesh, Deepak Suvarna\n\nCorrespondence – Deepak Suvarna - drdeepaksuvarna@gmail.com\n\nDepartment of Medical Gastroenterology, J S S Hospital, Mahatma Gandhi Road, Fort Mohalla, Mysuru 570 004, India\n\nIntroduction One of the major limitations of model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score is its failure to assess nutritional status of patients, thereby underestimating disease severity. So patients with low MELD score, but with sarcopenia may be under prioritized. Our objective was to evaluate if inclusion of sarcopenia within MELD score could improve prediction of mortality in patients with liver cirrhosis.\n\nMethods We evaluated 65 patients with liver cirrhosis for sarcopenia. Sarcopenia evaluation was done bedside using SARC-F questionnaire, Chair rise test and measuring hand grip strength using electronic hand dynamometer. Sarcopenia was defined using previously published hand grip strength cut offs (Asian working group for sarcopenia). Patients with sarcopenia were given additional 10 points to MELD score. Patients with and without sarcopenia were followed up for a period of 6 months.\n\nResults Twenty-nine patients (44.6%) with liver cirrhosis had sarcopenia. Mean hand grip dynamometer strength (kg) was 20.214.57 kg and 31.34 7.93 kg in patients with and without sarcopenia respectively (p-< 0.001). Sarcopenic patients had a higher frequency of ascites (p = 0.618), hepatic encephalopathy (p = 0.53), variceal bleeding (p = 0.47) and SBP (p = 0.43) in comparison to non-sarcopenic patients during 6 months of follow-up. But p value was not statistically significant. The mean MELD Score was 20.62±6.13 and 19.67±6.75 among patients with and without sarcopenia respectively. Mean MELD-Sarcopenia score was 30.61± 6.28 among sarcopenic patients.\n\nConclusions Sarcopenia was detected in significant patients with cirrhosis of liver. Incidence of liver cirrhosis related complications and mortality was higher among patients with sarcopenia compared to non-sarcopenic patients. Sarcopenia was independently associated with increased risk of mortality. however, modification of MELD score to include sarcopenia (MELD-Sarcopenia score) was not associated with improvement in prediction of mortality at 6 months.\n\nKeywords MELD score, Sarcopenia\n\n021\n\nEvolution of Rosemont`s “indeterminate for chronic pancreatitis” as diagnosed on endoscopic ultrasound in patients presenting with recurrent acute pancreatitis with one year follow-up\n\nArun Vaidya, Kshaunish Das, Partha Patra\n\nCorrespondence – Arun Vaidya - arunvaidya212@gmail.com\n\nDepartment of Gastroenterology, Seth Sukhlal Karnani Memorial Hospital, and Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education and Research, SSKM Hospital Road, Bhowanipore, Kolkata 700 020, India\n\nBackground and Aim Some patients presenting with recurrent acute pancreatitis (RAP), when undergo endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), are classified as indeterminate for chronic pancreatitis (CP) according to Rosemont criteria. Our aim was to study the clinical and radiological outcome of such patients over a period of one year.\n\nMethods We conducted prospective observational cohort study and included Rosemont “Indeterminate” for CP patients above 12 years of age. All the patients were closely followed up at 3 monthly intervals in pancreatic clinic and subjected to ultrasound abdomen and blood sugar profile 6 monthly. EUS was done after 12 months of baseline EUS. Fecal elastase was performed after 1 year of enrolment.\n\nResults Total 21 RAP patients after excluding chronic pancreatitis on CT abdomen and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) undergone EUS. Fourteen were found to be Indeterminate for CP and included in study. Males were 93%. Median age was 26 years. Median duration between first attack of acute pancreatitis (AP) and EUS was 34 months with median of 4 attacks of AP prior to EUS. Most common etiology of RAP was idiopathic followed by ethanol and hypertriglyceridemia. History of smoking present in 36% patients. On 1 year follow-up, 35.7% remained pain free and 28.6% had AP attack. Endocrine and exocrine insufficiency was seen in 1 and 2 patients respectively. Gallstones and sludge were detected in 3 patients on follow-up ultrasound abdomen. Follow-up EUS done in 8 patients revealed Rosemont ‘normal’ in 1, ‘Indeterminate’ in 2, suggestive of CP in 3 and consistent with CP in 2 patients.\n\nConclusions EUS has high diagnostic yield. Indeterminate for CP is common in younger adults with idiopathic being most common etiology.

Cholangioscopy guided laser lithotripsy have been reported to be safe and effective for difficult bile duct stones. Cystic duct stones (CDS) pose special challenge for endoscopic treatment because of tortuous nature of the cystic duct, so traditionally it is managed with surgery. We aimed to see efficacy and safety of cholangioscopy guided laser lithotripsy for cystic duct stones.\n\nMethods All consecutive patients who underwent laser lithotripsy for cystic duct stones from July 2018 till February 2022 were recruited after obtaining institutional board review approval. Details regarding previous Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and cholecystectomy were maintained prospectively. ERCP was performed in all patients and digital single-operator cholangioscopy (DSOC) with laser lithotripsy (Holmium) was performed. Primary endpoint was complete cystic duct clearance determined by cholangioscopy.\n\nResults Total 167 patients underwent laser lithotripsy for various indication during the study period. Out of 167 patients, 30 patients (median age 45.5 [range 26-73] years, male-20) underwent laser lithotripsy for CDS. Out of 30 patients, 21 patients had retained impacted CDS after cholecystectomy. Median size of CDS was 15 mm (range 11-20mm). Mechanical lithotripsy had failed in 12 patients. DSOC guided laser lithotripsy was utilised in all patients with technical success of 93.3%. CDS clearance was achieved in 29 (96.6%) patients. In one patient procedure was aborted because of respiratory distress. Post ERCP CBD stenting was done in all patients which were removed subsequently (at median 4 weeks). Median duration of procedure was 65 (40-90) minutes. There were few adverse events (mid abdominal pain-5, post-ERCP pancreatitis-2, and death-1). The median follow-up duration was 6 (range 3-43) months.\n\nConclusions DSOC guided laser lithotripsy is safe and effective for cystic duct stones. It is minimally invasive and can be considered for the management of retained impacted CDS after cholecystectomy.\n\nKeywords Cholangiography, Gallstone, Laproscopic, Lithotripsy, Mirizzi syndrome\n\n023\n\nSoCr score – A novel predictor to assess steroid response in acute severe ulcerative colitis\n\nAntony George, Jijo Varghese, Krishnadas Devadas\n\nCorrespondence – Antony George - anthony00590@gmail.com\n\nDepartment of Medical Gastroenterology, Government Medical College, Ulloor - Akkulam Road, Chalakkuzhi, Thiruvananthapuram 695 011, India\n\nIntroduction Acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) is a dreaded complication of ulcerative colitis (UC), with high mortality. 15% to 57% of patients fail to respond to systemic corticosteroids, the cornerstone of ASUC management, and might require colectomy or rescue medical therapies like infliximab or cyclosporine. The available predictive models of steroid response are based on western population studies, some utilizing expensive tests like fecal calprotectin. Our study aims to develop a simple predictor model for steroid response in ASUC.\n\nMethodology A prospective observational study was conducted over 7 years (2015-2022). ASUC was defined based on Truelove and Witts criteria. Various clinical and laboratory parameters were assessed on the day of admission.\n\nResults Eighty-seven patients were taken up for the study. Sixteen patients failed to respond to steroids. Among the variables analyzed, albumin, CRP, sodium, and hemoglobin were significant in predicting response to steroids. On regression analysis, CRP and sodium were independent predictors of response to steroids. The coefficient of beta was multiplied by steroid and CRP and the total score was obtained. This was called the SoCr (sodium+CRP) score = (sodium*0.4 – CRP*0.28) score. AUROC of the score was plotted. The score had an AUROC of 0.937. A score of >42 has a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 83% in predicting response to steroids. The score was validated in a validation cohort of 31 patients. A score of >42 had a sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 88% in the validation cohort. All patients without pancolitis and those with a precipitating factor for colitis exacerbation responded to steroids.\n\nConclusion SoCr score is a simple prognostic score that can predict response to steroids in ASUC. The absence of pancolitis and lack of a precipitating factor for colitis exacerbation are strong predictors of response to steroids.\n\nKeywords Acute severe ulcerative colitis, Predictors, Score, Steroid response\n\n024\n\nAdvantages of routine milking of common bile duct during combined laparoscopic cholecystectomy and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography\n\nVinay V , Sridhar C G\n\nCorrespondence – Vinay V - vinay.hvr4@gmail.com\n\nDepartment of Medical Gastroenterology, GEM Hospital, Pankaj Mill Road, Ramanathapuram, Coimbatore 641 045, India\n\nBackground Approximately fifteen percent of patients with gallbladder stones also have common bile duct (CBD) stones [1]. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is combined routinely with laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) for concomitant CBD stone and other post-cholecystectomy complications such as bile leak and inadvertent injury. We aimed this study to evaluate the role of CBD milking to prevent complications and to increase rate of biliary cannulation in ERCPs Post-LC.\n\nMethods This study included all cases undergoing combined LC with ERCP as one-step procedure at GEM Hospital, Coimbatore in the period from January 2021 to September 2021. All the complications with percentage of biliary cannulation were noted meticulously to compare with the conventional method of not milking CBD. Patients undergoing LC or ERCP as two-step procedure were excluded.\n\nResults Out of total 68 cases, failed biliary cannulation was recorded in 8 patients in non-milking cases but only 1 in milking of CBD was performed intra-operatively. CBD cannulation time was longer in non-milking group as compared to milking group. Total operative time of 106.5 minutes was less than conventional 122.8 minutes but not statistically significant. Complications like inadvertent PD cannulation in 11 cases (26%) compared to milking group about one case (3%), retained calculi were noted in 6 cases in non-milking group (13.19%) as compared to 3 cases post-milking (4%). Postoperative pancreatitis were observed in 5 cases (11.9%) of non-milking group but in only one case after milking of CBD (3.82%). Average length of Hospital stay was longer in non-milking group.\n\nConclusions Milking of CBD although difficult in some cases of LC has definite benefit in biliary cannulation during ERCP with reduced operative time and complication rates probably due to effects on sphincter of Oddi but follow-up is required to make it standardised technique in conventional one-step combined LC with ERCP.\n\nKeywords ERCP, Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, Milking of common bile duct\n\n025\n\nExclusive enteral nutrition mediates gut microbial alterations which correlate with augmented corticosteroid response in patients with acute severe colitis\n\nAditya Bajaj , Manasvini Markandey, Pabitra Sahu, Sudheer Vuyyuru, Bhaskar Kante, Peeyush Kumar, Namrata Singh, Arti Gupta, Mukesh Singh, Mahak Verma, Govind K Makharia, Saurabh Kedia, Vineet Ahuja\n\nCorrespondence – Vineet Ahuja - vineet.aiims@gmail.com\n\nDepartment of Gastroenterology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Sri Aurobindo Marg, Ansari Nagar, Ansari Nagar East, New Delhi 110 029, India\n\nIntroduction Supplementation with exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) in addition to standard corticosteroid therapy (SCT) has been proven to augment the steroid response rate in patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC). EEN is known to alter the gut microbial composition. The present study identifies the changes in gut microbiota driven by EEN in patients with ASUC receiving standard steroid therapy and explores the correlation of the EEN-associated bacteria with changes in clinical parameters over the course of therapy.\n\nMethods Stool samples were collected from 50 patients with ASUC who received either SCT (n=24) or SCT supplemented with EEN (n=20) for a period of 7 days, at baseline (Day 0) and post-therapy (Day 7). Microbiome characterization was carried out using 16S rRNA gene sequencing followed by data processing using QIIME2 and R packages for analysis of diversity and differentially abundant taxa.\n\nResults Seven-day EEN supplementation of SCT in patients with ASUC resulted in enhanced Methylobacterium, Sphingomonas, Limosilactobacillus, Megamonas, Thermus, Viellonella, with a reduction in Ruminococcus gnavus, Gemmiger, Pseudomonas, and Enterococcus. The EEN-mediated enhancement in specific taxa correlated positively with patients’ serum albumin levels and negatively with fecal calprotectin levels. The microbiome abundance dataset and clinical parameters (FCP, CRP, serum albumin levels, and clinical response to EEN) correlated significantly, as analyzed by coinertia analysis. Gut microbial composition of patients who responded to the EEN-augmented SCT showed an enhanced abundance of Coprococcus, Megamonas, Oribacterium, Sediminibacterium, Acidibacter, and Thermus, and reduction in Sutterella, R. gnavus, Collinsella, Dorea, and Morganella, when compared to EEN non-responders. Baseline gut microbiome signature in patients with ASUC predicts a potential response to both the SCT and EEN-supplemented SCT in patients with ASUC.\n\nConclusion Augmentation of clinical response by EEN-conjugated corticosteroid therapy is accompanied by gut microbial changes in patients with ASUC.\n\nKeywords Acute severe ulcerative colitis, Exclusive enteral nutrition, Gut microbiota\n\n026\n\nMolecular subtyping of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor and its correlation with clinicopathological outcome: A single institute retrospective study\n\nSaikat Mitra 1 , Aravind Sekar1, Divya Khosla2, Vikas Gupta3, Kim Vaiphei1\n\nCorrespondence - Saikat Mitra - saikatmitra123@gmail.com\n\nDepartments of 1Histopathology, 2Radiotherapy, and 3Surgical Gastroenterology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh 160 012, India\n\nIntroduction Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) account for ~3% to 4% of all pancreatic tumors worldwide. The WHO grading and TNM staging in PanNET do not accurately predict the clinical behavior and prognosis. We used immunohistochemistry based molecular subtyping of PanNETs and studied the relation of the mutations with clinicopathological outcome.\n\nMethods In this single institute retrospective study, cases of PanNETs were selected. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for ATRX, DAXX, Menin, ARX and PDX-1 markers were done on formaline-fixed tissue. FITC-labelled telomere-specific fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) was performed to assess altered telomere lengthening (ALT). The tumors were subtyped based on mutation status and the subtypes were correlated with clinical, pathological features and follow-up.\n\nResults A total of 78 cases including 75 PanNET (45 grade 1, 20 grade 2 and 10 grade 3) and 3 pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma were identified. ATRX and DAXX mutations were identified in 20.9% and 29.9% of PanNET cases respectively. ATRX mutation was significantly associated with nodal metastasis (p=0.007), higher TNM stage (p=0.004), higher WHO grade (p=0.014), lymphovascular invasion (p<0.001), recurrence (p=0.025). DAXX mutation was significantly associated with a larger tumor size (p=0.007), higher TNM stage (p=0.011), higher WHO grade (p=0.002), lymphovascular invasion (p=0.001), perineural invasion (p=0.046). Altogether, 26 cases (38.8%) showed either ATRX/DAXX mutation (AD mutant subtype) and showed significantly higher tumor size (p=0.035), nodal metastasis (p= 0.001), higher WHO grade (p= 0.001), lymphovascular invasion (p=0.001) perineural invasion (p=0.048) and recurrence (p=0.001). Univariate survival analysis revealed significantly lower overall follow-up in ATRX mutant (p<0.001), DAXX mutant (p=0.007) and AD mutant (p=0.011) subtypes. ALT positivity correlated with higher TNM stage, lymphovascular invasion and AD mutation. Multivariate cox-regression analysis showed ATRX mutation as independent predictor of poorer overall survival (HR=10.1, CI=1.3-76.7, p=0.025).\n\nConclusion ATRX/DAXX mutant PanNETs have aggressive clinical, histological behavior and are predictors of poor outcome.\n\nKeywords Altered telomere lengthening, ATRX, DAXX, Neuroendocrine tumor, Pancreas\n\n027\n\nAlgorithmic approach to differentiate between non-specific and specific etiologies of chronic terminal Ileitis\n\nKaran Sachdeva, Samagra Agarwal, Peeyush Kumar, David Mathew, Sudheer K.

We aimed to improve our previously suggested algorithm to distinguish patients who would merit specific treatment from those who do not.\n\nMethods Patients (n=153) with isolated TI involvement (ulcers or nodularity) following-up at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) (2007-2022) were retrospectively reviewed. A specific (ITB/CD) diagnosis was made based on standardized criteria and other relevant data was collected. The cohort was utilized for validation of previously suggested algorithm while multivariate analysis with bootstrap validation was used to develop a revised algorithm.\n\nResults We included 153 patients (mean age 36.9 years, 70% males, median duration of symptoms 1.5 years) with isolated terminal ileal involvement of whom 109 (71.2%) received a specific diagnosis (69 CD, 40 ITB). Multivariate regression and validation statistics suggested that based on a combination of clinical (blood in stools, weight loss, hemoglobin), radiological (necrotic lymph nodes, long segment ileal involvement) and colonoscopic findings (presence or absence of deep ulcers), an optimism corrected c-statistic of 0.975 and 0.958 could be reached with and without histopathological findings respectively. Based on these, a revised algorithm was developed which showed a sensitivity of 99.08% (95% CI:94.99-99.98) and a specificity of 75.0% (95% CI:59.66-86.81). The positive predictive value (PPV) was 90.76% (95% CI:85.47-94.25) and negative predictive value (NPV) was 97.06% (95% CI:82.32–99.57) with an overall accuracy of 92.16% (95% CI:86.70-95.88). This was a more sensitive and specific than the previous algorithm (accuracy 83.6%, sensitivity 95.4%, and specificity 54.4%).\n\nConclusion We suggested a revised algorithm to stratify patients of terminal ileitis into those who have a specific etiology and those who need only symptomatic treatment. Our algorithm has the potential to avoid missed diagnosis as well as unnecessary side effects of treatment.\n\nKeywords Algorithm, Crohn’s disease, Terminal Ileitis\n\n028\n\nSignificance of fibroblast growth factor receptor heterozygous genotype in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with and without type II diabetes mellitus: A pilot study from Assam\n\nSnigdha Jyoti Das , Purabi Bose, Sangit Dutta * , Natasha Kashyap, Aditi Kalita, Sujoy Bose **\n\nCorrespondence - Purabi Bose - pdbose@cottonuniversity.ac.in\n\nDepartment of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Cotton University Panbazar, Guwahati 781 001, India, *Department of Medicine, Gauhati Medical College Hospital, Guwahati 781 032, India, and **Department of Biotechnology, Gauhati University, Guwahati 781 014, India\n\nIntroduction Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in lean patients is suggestive of phenotypic and apparently pathophysiologically distinct; with unsatisfactory documentation of its underlying mechanism(s) at molecular level. Type-II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is also linked with NAFLD, and therefore a common immunological link may be present. In the present study, we intended in defining the possible role of the polymorphism of the FGFR4 receptor gene and the differential expression of its ligand, FGF19, to bring some insight towards the pathophysiology of NAFLD via molecular genetic analysis in lean patients without or with T2DM.\n\nMethods Blood samples were obtained from clinically diagnosed lean patients having NAFLD (=50), NAFLD with T2DM (=50) and healthy volunteers (=50) with informed consent. Analysis of gene expression at mRNA level and gene polymorphism was done by Real-time-polymerase chain reaction (Real-time-PCR) and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) respectively.\n\nResults The genotype analysis of FGFR4 gene showed higher prevalence of heterozygous genotype in patients with NAFLD compared to NAFLD with T2DM (OR=2.667) while it showed significantly lower prevalence of heterozygous genotype in controls compared to the case cohorts. The gene expression of FGF19 at mRNA level exhibited an up-regulation in both the cases in comparison to controls. Upon association with increased liver function tests (LFT) profile markers, although statistically non-significant, expression level of FGF19 was found to be negatively correlated with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels and positively correlated with ALP and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels.\n\nConclusion The data suggests the association of FGFR4 heterozygous genotype with the development of NAFLD and NAFLD with T2DM. However, the upregulation of FGF19 mRNA expression in disease cohorts compared to controls was not found to be statistically significant suggesting the fact that the FGFR4 heterozygous genotype may have some role to play in the pathogenesis of either NAFLD or NAFLD with T2DM rather than its ligand FGF19.\n\nKeywords Fibroblast growth factor (FGF19), Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR4), Messenger\n\n029\n\nPlastic stents versus NAGI bi-flanged metal stent for endoscopic ultrasound guided drainage of walled-off necrosis - A randomized controlled study\n\nKrithi Krishna Koduri , Nitin Jagtap, Sandeep Lakhtakia, Jahangeer Basha, Zaheer Nabi, Mohan Ramchandani, Rakesh Kalapala, Rajesh Gupta, Sana Fathimamemon, D N Reddy\n\nCorrespondence – Krithi Krishna Koduri - drkrithivk@gmail.com\n\nDepartment of Gastroenterology, Asian Institute of Gastroenterology, 6-3-661, Somajiguda, Hyderabad 500 082, India\n\nIntroduction Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided drainage with either plastic stents or metal stents is the mainstay of walled off necrosis (WON) management. A systematic review of retrospective studies showed similar treatment success for WON by plastic or metal stents. This single center randomized controlled study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of dedicated NAGI bi-flanged metal stent (BFMS) and plastic stents for WON drainage.\n\nMethods Patients with symptomatic WON amenable for EUS-guided drainage were randomized to either BFMS or plastic stents. Patients having altered anatomy, WON not accessible for endoscopic drainage, previous percutaneous drainage were excluded. Primary outcome was comparison of re-intervention free clinical success at 4 weeks, defined as symptom resolution and significant reduction in WON size. Secondary outcomes were treatment success, number of re-interventions, hospital stay and long-term outcomes.\n\nResults A total of 92 patients were randomized either to BFMS (n = 46; mean age 34.9 (12.4) years) or plastic stents (n = 46; mean age 36.8 (11.1) years). There was no significant difference in terms of debris and maximum size of WON in both groups (p > 0.05). Re-intervention free clinical success at one month was observed in 31 (67.4%) in BFMS arm and 20 (43.5%) in plastic stent arm by ITT analysis (p 0.035) and 68.1% vs. 44.2% by PP analysis (p 0.0382). However, overall clinical success was equal in both groups. There was significantly lower number of re-interventions including necrosectomy sessions and hospital stay required in BFMS group. There was no difference in procedure-related adverse events or mortality. Also, there was no significant difference in clinical success, recurrence, DPDS, chronic pancreatitis and new-onset DM up to 6-month follow-up.\n\nConclusions The bi-flanged metal stent provides higher re-intervention free clinical success at 4 weeks with lower hospital stay without increased risk of adverse events compared to plastic stents for EUS-guided drainage of WON.\n\nKeywords Bi-flanged metal stent, Endoscopic ultrasound, RCT, Walled off necrosis\n\n030\n\nFatty liver and metabolic syndrome in patients with celiac disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis\n\nNishant Aggarwal 1 , Ashish Agarwal2, Hasan Alarouri3, Vignesh Dwarkanathan4, Sana Dang5, Vineet Ahuja6, Govind K Makharia6\n\nCorrespondence – Govind K Makharia - govindmakharia@gmail.com\n\n1Department of Internal Medicine, William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, Michigan, USA, 2Department of Gastroenterology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Marudhar Industrial Area, 2nd Phase, M.I.A. 1st Phase, Basni, Basni, Jodhpur 342 005, India, 3Jordan University of Science and Technology Faculty of Medicine, Ar-Ramtha, Jordan, 4Department of Community Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Sri Aurobindo Marg, Ansari Nagar, Ansari Nagar East, New Delhi 110 029, India, 5Department of Medicine, Vardhaman Mahavir Medical College and Safdarjung Hospital, NH 48, Near AIIMS Hospital, Ansari Nagar West, New Delhi 110 029, India, and 6Department of Gastroenterology and Human Nutrition, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Sri Aurobindo Marg, Ansari Nagar, Ansari Nagar East, New Delhi 110 029, India\n\nObjective Studies have suggested a high prevalence of fatty liver and metabolic syndrome in patients with celiac disease (CeD). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the prevalence of fatty liver and metabolic syndrome in treatment-naïve patients with CeD and in patients on gluten-free diet (GFD).\n\nMethods The PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library databases were searched for original studies. We included full-text articles published in the English language after 1990 that used well-defined criteria for CeD, fatty liver and metabolic syndrome. Of 185 studies identified, seven were included for the analysis. Random effects model was used to calculate pooled prevalence.\n\nResults The pooled prevalence of fatty liver in treatment-naïve patients with CeD was 15.3% (0.153 [95% CI 0.056-0.285], n=867). After initiation of GFD, the prevalence increased to 29.1% (0.291 [95% CI 0.172-0.427], n=869). The pooled prevalence of metabolic syndrome in treatment-naïve patients with CeD was 4.3% (0.043 [95% CI 0.024-0.067], n=1239), which increased to 24.2% (0.242 [95% CI 0.195-0.293], n=1239) after initiation of GFD (Figs. 1 and 2). We did not observe any significant publication bias.\n\nConclusions The present review has suggested a high prevalence of fatty liver and metabolic syndrome in patients with CeD which increases further with the initiation of GFD. Patients with CeD should thus be regularly screened and monitored for the development of fatty liver and metabolic syndrome. They should be counselled appropriately regarding their diet and inclusion of regular physical activity in their lifestyle.\n\nKeywords Celiac, Fatty liver, Metabolic syndrome, Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, Obesity\n\n031\n\nFDG PET CT findings in microscopic colitis and its correlation with the disease activity\n\nAntriksh Kumar 1 , Rakesh Kochhar 1 , Kaushal Kishore Pasad 1 , Anish Bhattacharya 2 , Rajendra Kumar 2 , Shreya Shruti3, Jayanta Samanta1, Saroj Kant Sinha1\n\nCorrespondence – Saroj Kant Sinha - sarojksinha@hotmail.com\n\nDepartments of 1Gastroenterology, and 2Nuclear Medicine, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Sector 12, Chandigarh 160 012, India, and 3Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, Chandigarh 160 030, India\n\nBackground and Aim PET-CT has been used earlier to localize the diseased segments in patients with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. There is paucity of data on its utility for the diagnosis and evaluation of disease activity in microscopic colitis (MC).\n\nMethods Patients presenting with watery diarrhea were prospectively evaluated from July 2018 to December 2019 for the etiology using various tests including sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy and colonic biopsy. Those suffering from MC underwent 18-FDG-PET-CT and assessment of disease activity using microscopic colitis activity index (MCDAI). A regional 18F-FDG-PET-CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed, and the images were evaluated in blinded manner. Liver FDG uptake was taken as background and any uptake in large above the background liver activity was taken as abnormal. The maximum SUV (standardized uptake values) was measured in each colonic segment.\n\nResults Fifty-three patients with chronic watery diarrhea were evaluated, of which 29 patients were found to have MC (23 LC, 2 CC and 4 mixed). Diffuse FDG uptake pattern in colon was noted in 20 (69%) patients, focal colonic uptake was present in 8 (27.6%) patients. Even in the colonic segments, diffuse FDG uptake pattern was seen predominantly. The number of patients showing such an uptake pattern were 16 (55.2%) in ascending colon, 11 (37.9%) in cecum and 8 (29.6%) in descending colon. Only four patients mounted some PET enhancement in the small intestine.\n\nReceiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were formulated to find maximal cut-off values of MCDAI and uptake patterns of PET scan. A significant SUVmax of diffuse uptake pattern in the descending colon had a significant correlation with MCDAI (Correlation Coefficient=0.786, p= 0.021).\n\nConclusion Most patients with MC show diffuse pattern of uptake in colon. Moreover, FDG-PET-CT may be useful in assessing the the disease activity of MC.\n\nKeywords CT scan, FDG PET, Microscopic colitis, PET\n\n032\n\nNo biopsy approach is applicable for diagnosis of celiac disease in adults\n\nAditya Pachisia , Nishakar Thakur, Shubham Mehta, Alka Singh, Shubham Prasad, Ankit Agarwal, Ashish Chauhan, Sachin Rajput, Rohan Malik, Prasenjit Das, Vineet Ahuja, Govind K Makharia\n\nCorrespondence – Aditya Pachisia - adityapachisia.jul20@aiims.edu\n\nDepartment of Gastroenterology and Human Nutrition Unit, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Sri Aurobindo Marg, Ansari Nagar, Ansari Nagar East, New Delhi 110 029, India\n\nIntroduction While European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) 2020 advocates non-biopsy pathway for the diagnosis of celiac disease (CeD) in children if IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (anti-tTG ab) titre is ≥10 folds upper limit of normal (ULN) and have a positive IgA anti-endomysial antibody (EMA), data on anti tTG Ab titre based diagnosis of CeD in adults is emerging. We planned to validate if anti-tTG Ab titre >10 folds predicts villous abnormalities of modified Marsh grade ≥2 in Asian patients with CeD.\n\nMethods Relevant data of 937 adults with CeD was extracted from two databases including All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Celiac Clinic and the Indian National Biorepository. The diagnosis of CeD in them were made on basis of standard criteria including a positive anti-tTG Ab and presence of villous abnormalities of modified Marsh grade 2 or more.\n\nResults Only 45.3% of 937 patients had anti tTG Ab titer of ≥10 folds. However, the positive predictive value (PPV) and specificity of anti tTG Ab titre ≥10 folds for predicting modified Marsh grade ≥2 was 99.8% and 98%, respectively. Further at anti tTG Ab titre ≥ 11folds, both the specificity and PPV were 100% for prediction of villous abnormalities of modified Marsh grade ≥2.06).\n\nConclusions Approximately only half of adult patients with CeD have anti-tTG Ab titre ≥ 10 folds hence qualifying for the non-biopsy pathway for the diagnosis. The specificity and predictive value of anti-tTG Ab ≥ 10 folds for diagnosing CeD are high even in adult patients\n\nKeywords Anti tTG Ab, Celiac disease, Fold rise, Modified marsh score\n\n033\n\nThe predictors of non-tumoral portal vein thrombosis among patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis using acoustic parameters of liver and spleen\n\nShivabrata Dhal Mohapatra, Aditya Verma, Srijaya S\n\nCorrespondence – Aditya Verma - Adi_cooldude08@yahoo.com\n\nDepartment of Medical Gastroenterology, Government Medical College, Ulloor - Akkulam Road, Chalakkuzhi, Thiruvananthapuram 695 011, India\n\nBackground and Aims Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) that occurs due to poor portal flow, complex thrombophilic disorders and factors leading to endothelial dysfunction, is an increasingly recognized complication in patients with cirrhosis. We tried to assess the acoustic parameters and stiffness of liver and spleen as risk factors associated with non-malignant PVT in decompensated chronic liver disease patients (DCLD).\n\nMethods We prospectively enrolled 502 patients with DCLD (CHILD B/C). All patients underwent detailed clinical evaluation, baseline investigation and ultrasonography. PVT was confirmed by contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) abdomen in patients with ultrasonogram (USG) evidence of PVT or alteration in portal flow dynamics. Acoustic parameters of liver and spleen were assessed by 2D Shear wave elastography (Supersonic Aixplorer). ROC was plotted to derive the best cut-off of parameters for development of PVT.\n\nResults Thirty-nine patients were excluded. Of the 463 patients included, 51 had PVT (11%). It was observed that non-malignant PVT group patients had smaller liver size (11.8±1.8 vs. 12.4±1.5, p=0.032), higher spleen size (14.9±2.3 vs. 13.5±2.2, p<0.01), higher portal vein diameter (PVD, 14.4±3.2 vs. 12.2±1.7, p<0.01), lower portal vein velocity (PVV, 11.5±3.6 vs. 16.7±3.6, p<0.01), higher liver stiffness (61.3±21.7 vs. 55.2±17.1, p=0.02), higher splenic stiffness (50.3±15.1 vs. 36.7±7.5, p<0.01) as compared to non-PVT group. On plotting ROC; PVV <12.5 cm/sec (AUROC 0.86, sensitivity 74%, specificity 88%, NPV 95.9%), PVD >13.7 cm (AUROC 0.75), liver stiffness >66.5 kPa (AUROC 0.72), liver size <11.95 cm (AUROC 0.63) were significantly associated with development of non-malignant PVT (p<0.01). On multiple logistic analysis PVD >13.75 cm (B=1.21, OR:95%CI 3.36]1.05-10.7], p=0.04), PVV <12.5 cm/sec (B= -1.06, OR:95% CI 0.35 [0.13-0.09], p=0.03) were significant risk factors for PVT development in DCLD.\n\nConclusion The association of higher liver stiffness and smaller liver size as markers of extent of cirrhosis, higher splenic size and stiffness as a reflection of severity of portal hypertension, dilated PV and low PVV indicating sluggish portal flow that trigger thrombosis in the splenoportal axis, were significantly associated with non-malignant PVT in DCLD.\n\nKeywords 2D shear wave elastography, Decompensated cirrhosis, Non-malignant PVT-Portal vein thrombosis\n\n034\n\nLeft ventricular diastolic dysfunction: A surrogate predictor of survival in patients with decompensated cirrhosis\n\nRushil Solanki, Srijaya Sreesh, Krishnadas Devadas, Antony George, Vijay Narayanan, Shivabrata Dhal Mohapatra\n\nCorrespondence - Rushil Solanki - rushilsolanki808@gmail.com\n\nDepartment of Medical Gastroenterology, Government Medical College, Ulloor-Akkulam Road, Near SAT Hospital Medical College Junction, Chalakkuzhi, Thiruvananthapuram 695 011, India\n\nBackground and Aims Left Ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) is a primal manifestation of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy. Few studies have addressed its relationship with mortality outcomes. We evaluated the impact of LVDD along with other parameters on the short-term survival of patients with decompensated cirrhosis.\n\nMethod One hundred and ninety-two patients with decompensated cirrhosis underwent investigations including 2D echocardiography with tissue Doppler imaging. The diagnosis of LVDD was based on the American Society of Echocardiography guidelines and the patients were followed up for 6 months.\n\nResults 42.2% (n=81) had grade 1 LVDD and 30.7% (59) had grade 2 LVDD at enrollment. 69.2% (128) were alive at 6 months. Among the non-survivors, 5.9% had no LVDD, 23.4% had grade-1 and 62.1% had grade-2 LVDD (p=<0.001). Median survival of LVDD grades 0, 1, and 2 was 177±3, 163±3, and 122±3 days respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed poor survival in patients with LVDD (p<0.001), E/e' ≥10 (p=0.029) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure PCWP ≥15 mmHg (p=0.003). The Cox regression model showed a hazard ratio of 10.3 for grade-2 LVDD, and 5.7 for any LVDD compared to 1.07 for model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score as an independent predictor of mortality. MELD score cut-off for predicting mortality was 17 (84% sensitivity:62% specificity). Mortality in patients with MELD >17 was 52.9% with LVDD vs. 9.5% without LVDD (p<0.001), and MELD ≤17 was 16.7% with LVDD vs. 3.4% without LVDD (p=0.08). In multivariate analysis, the MELD score and LVDD were independent predictors of survival. Among echocardiography parameters, patients with a ratio of early filling velocity to early diastolic mitral annular velocity (E/e') ≥10 and PCWP ≥15 mmHg were significantly associated with the severity and mortality of the patients.\n\nConclusion The presence and severity of LVDD are better predictors of poor transplant-free survival than MELD in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.

The present study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of urine neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL) in predicting type of AKI among patients of DC having AKI.\n\nMethods Consecutive DC patients with AKI stage 1B or above (International Club of Ascites [ICA] 2015 criteria) seen between March 2020 to February 2021 were evaluated. AKI was typed as acute tubular necrosis (ATN-AKI), Pre-Renal (PRA-AKI) and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS-AKI). The urine NGAL levels were measured at diagnosis of AKI (Day 0) and 48hrs (Day 3) after volume expansion. The AKI type was determined by two study investigators independently using clinical data blinded to urine NGAL levels. The patients were followed up till death or 28 days.\n\nResults Overall 388 DC patients were screened, 86 patients (PRA-AKI n=47, 55%; HRS-AKI n=25, 29%; ATN-AKI n=14, 16%) with mean age 48.73±12.53 years, 74 (86%) males were included. The area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of urine NGAL for differentiating ATN-AKI and non-ATN AKI at day 0 was 0.97 (95% CI 0.95-1.0) and on day 3 was 0.97 (0.94-1.0). The optimal urine NGAL cut-off level on day 0 was 214.98 ug/g creatinine and on day 3 was 200.09 ug/g creatinine for predicting ATN-AKI. The overall mortality was 45.34% and urine NGAL levels were higher in patients who died as compared to those who survived.\n\nConclusion Urine NGAL has an excellent diagnostic accuracy in predicting ATN-AKI in DC patients. High urine NGAL levels are associated with increased risk of death.\n\nKeywords Acute kidney injury (AKI), Decompensated cirrhosis, Urine neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin\n\nEsophagus\n\n036\n\nProton pump inhibitor therapy in patients with erosive esophagitis- A real world scenario\n\nMayank Jain\n\nCorrespondence – Mayank Jain - mayank4670@rediffmail.com\n\nDepartment of Gastroenterology, Arihant Hospital and Research Centre, 297 Indrapuri, Near Bhanwarkuan, Indore 452 001, India\n\nPatients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are managed with lifestyle changes, dietary interventions, and proton pump inhibitors (PPI).\n\nAim To determine patterns of PPI use in patients with documented erosive esophagitis (EE).\n\nMethods This prospective study recruited all patients with symptoms of GERD (heartburn and /or regurgitation with or without chest pain) and documented significant reflux esophagitis (Los Angeles grading LA-B or beyond on endoscopy). Lifestyle, dietary changes were initiated and all patients were prescribed twice daily PPI for 8 weeks. PPI was tapered as the requirement beyond 8 weeks. Follow-up was done at weeks 8, 12 and 24. The outcomes analyzed included number of patients where complete PPI withdrawal was possible at week 24 and determinants of continued PPI use at 24 weeks of therapy. Statistical analysis- Chi-square test, Mann–Whitney U-test, sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio. P<0.05 was considered as statistically significant.\n\nResults The study cohort included 53 patients- 42 with reflux esophagitis LA-B and 11 with reflux esophagitis LA-C (median age 46 years [22-77 years]; 28 [52.3%] males). There was significant difference in consumption pattern of PPI between week 12 and 24 (p 0.008). At week 12, 15.1% were off PPI and 67% required intermittent dosing. At week 24, 45.3% of cases were off PPI therapy and 43.4% required intermittent dosing. Only 11.3% patients continued drug use at once-a-day dosing. Lower BMI (p 0.01) and age (p 0.01) were linked with complete PPI withdrawal at week 24.\n\nConclusion The present study highlights that PPI withdrawal is possible in 15.1% and 45.3% cases with EE after week 12 and week 24 of therapy respectively. Lower body mass index (BMI) and age are likely to be associated with PPI withdrawal at week 24.\n\nKeywords Drugs, Esophagitis, Esophagus, Reflux, Response\n\n037\n\nAn unusual case of dysphagia in a young male\n\nSumaswi Angadi, Suprabhat Giri, Sagar Gangadhar, Saidulu Chevigoni, Lohith Kumar V, Abhishek Kamuni, Sukanya Bhrugumalla\n\nCorrespondence - Sumaswi Angadi - sumaswia@gmail.com\n\nDepartment of Medical Gastroenterology, Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Speciality Block-4th Floor, Punjagutta, Hyderabad 500 082, India\n\nIntroduction Dysphagia in young individuals is commonly attributed to esophageal web, strictures, motility disorders, eosinophilic esophagitis or rarely malignancy. Extra esophageal compression as a cause of dysphagia is rarely encountered. An accurate diagnosis is essential to provide appropriate therapy.\n\nCase Report A 39-year-old male, non-smoker, non-alcoholic, a farmer by occupation presented with intermittent fever, shortness of breath associated with cough for 1 year, hoarseness of voice, and dysphagia for 6 months. Dysphagia was progressive for solid food. Systemic examination was unremarkable except for patchy crepitations in the right chest. Cross-sectional imaging revealed a 5.9 × 10.3 × 10.8 cm heterogeneously enhancing mass lesion in the posterior mediastinum. The lesion was seen encasing the left and right main bronchi, left main pulmonary artery, and closely abutting descending thoracic aorta with pericardial involvement. A probable diagnosis of malignancy or tuberculosis was made based on clinical features including hoarseness of voice and imaging findings. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a smooth extrinsic impression in the mid-esophagus with a fistulous opening covered with necrotic debris on the opposite wall and left vocal cord palsy. Barium swallow examination confirmed a linear fistulous tract in the mid esophagus with long segment luminal narrowing. Subsequently, endoscopic ultrasound with tissue acquisition was performed. Histopathology revealed granulomatous inflammation with septate filamentous hyphal structures. Further, the patient underwent a bronchoscopy and an Aspergillus galactomannan test performed on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was suggestive of invasive aspergillosis (0.7 ng/mL). The patient was started on intravenous voriconazole and discharged on oral formulation. Over 6 weeks, the patient reported a significant reduction in upper respiratory complaints and dysphagia.\n\nConclusion Extra esophageal compression is a rare cause of dysphagia. Cross-sectional imaging and endoscopic ultrasonography play an important role in its diagnosis. Invasive aspergillosis in immunocompetent individuals is rare. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate therapy is lifesaving.\n\nKeywords Dysphagia, Endoscopic ultrasound, Invasive Aspergillosis, Mediastinal granuloma\n\n038\n\nClinical, epidemiological, endoscopic profile and outcome of corrosive injuries of gastrointestinal tract\n\nChappidi Deepak, Sandeep Nijhawan\n\nCorrespondence – Sandeep Nijhawan - sandeepnijhawan16@gmail.com\n\nDepartment of Gastroenterology, Sawai Man Singh Medical College, New SMS Campus Road, Gangawal Park, Adarsh Nagar, Jaipur 302 004, India\n\nIntroduction Corrosive ingestion is one of the important causes of esophageal stricture and gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) in India. This study aims to explore the clinical, epidemiological, and endoscopic profile and outcomes of patients of corrosive ingestion.\n\nMethods This prospective observational study was done on patients presenting with history of corrosive ingestion to SMS Hospital, Jaipur, Rajasthan. Detailed history was recorded, and patients were analyzed on the basis of age, sex, mode of ingestion, intention of consumption, nature of corrosive and clinical symptoms. Endoscopy was done within 24 to 48 hours of admission. Patients were serially followed up and subjected to repeat endoscopy after 6 weeks.\n\nResults Total of 60 patients were enrolled from December 2020 to November 2021. Incidence of corrosive ingestion was higher in males than females (67% vs. 33%). The most common intention of corrosive ingestion was suicidal found in n=42 (70%). Acid ingestion (75%) was more common than alkali ingestion (25%). Chest pain and dysphagia were the most common symptoms at presentation. On endoscopy, 15 (25%) had grade 0, 5 (8%) had grade 1, 25 (41%) had grade 2 and 15 (25%) had grade 3 degree of corrosive injuries. All patients with grade 0, 1, and 2a injury recovered without sequelae. Esophageal strictures were seen in 12 (26%) patients in acid ingestion and 6 (40%) patients in alkali ingestion. GOO developed in 10 (22%) patients of acid ingestion and 6 (13%) patients of alkali ingestion. Both complications were seen in 3 (6%) patients with acid ingestion.\n\nConclusions Corrosive injury of the upper gastrointestinal tract is a common problem with variable complications. Acid injury is more common. Initial endoscopic grading of injury correlates with outcome. Esophageal complications were common in both acid and alkali ingestion. GOO was more common in acid ingestion.\n\nKeywords Corrosive, Gastric outlet obstruction, Stricture\n\n039\n\nExperience on the diagnostic outcome of high-resolution esophageal manometry from a single-center, tertiary level hospital\n\nChittuluri Jagadeesh, Chezhian A\n\nCorrespondence - Chittuluri Jagadeesh - doctorjd18@gmail.com\n\nDepartment of Medical Gastroenterology, Madras Medical College, Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, Poonamallee High Road, 3, Grand Southern Trunk Road, Near Chennai Central, Park Town, Chennai 600 003, India\n\nSignificance High-resolution esophageal manometry (HREM) has been the method of choice for the evaluation of esophageal motility disorders. There is no local data regarding the use and diagnostic outcome of HREM in the investigation of the patients referred for evaluation of esophageal motility.\n\nMethodology Study Design: Retrospective, cross-sectional. Study Population: Patients referred for evaluation of esophageal motility. Intervention: HREM\n\nResults In this study, total of 103 patients were evaluated using HREM. Majority of the patients included were females, 62 (60.195) and the mean age was 45.71 years. Most of the patients were referred for HREM because of persistent reflux symptoms despite proton pump inhibitor (PPI), 61 (59.22%), followed by dysphagia, 36 (34.95%). For the entire population, the most common HREM finding was abnormal, 66 (64.08%). Majority of patients referred for HREM because of gastroesophageal reflux related disease revealed normal results, 36 (53.73%), on the other hand majority of patients referred for HREM because of dysphagia revealed abnormal results, 35 (97.22%). Overall, an abnormal motility occurred in 66 patients (64.08%). The most common motility abnormality was weak peristaltic disorders in 33 (50.00%) followed by esophagogastric junction (EGJ) disorder in 40 (45.45%). The most common motility disorders based on symptom category were as follows: Dysphagia, Achalasia Type I in 17 out of 35 patients (48.57%); gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), ineffective peristalsis in 22 out of 31 patients (70.97%).\n\nConclusion This study confirms the overall high prevalence of weak peristaltic disorders and underscores the need to further study the pathophysiology and management of this ubiquitous disorder. The finding of achalasia in 83.33% of our patients with dysphagia is consistent with recent reports regarding the rising incidence of this disorder and underscores the need of prompt motility testing in this population.\n\nKeywords High resolution manometry\n\n040\n\nTwenty-four-hour pH-metry alone is inferior to additional impedance monitoring in the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease, particularly in presence of low gastric acid secretion\n\nUday C Ghoshal, Sugata Narayan Biswas, Anshuman Elhence, Bushra Fatima, Anand Prakash Agrahari, Asha Misra\n\nCorrespondence - Uday C Ghoshal - udayghoshal@gmail.com\n\nDepartment of Gastroenterology, Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Raibareli Road, Lucknow 226 014. India\n\nBackground Current gold standard for the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is 24-h pH-metry though it fails to detect non-acidic reflux. The sensitivity of 24-h pH-metry alone (both catheter-based and BRAVO capsule) is questionable, especially, if gastric acid secretion is low due to reduced parietal cell mass, Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric atrophy and antisecretory therapy. Accordingly, we analyzed the diagnostic ability of 24-h pH-metry as compared to impedance monitoring in relation to gastric acid levels without antisecretory therapy.\n\nMethods A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of 150 patients with suspected gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) undergoing 24-h pH impedance study was done.\n\nResults Among 150 patients with symptoms suggestive of GERD, 106 (70.6%) had confirmed GERD diagnosed either by 24-h pH-metry alone (10 [9.4%]), impedance monitoring alone (49 [46.2%]) or both (47 [44.3%]). Reflux of gastric contents was detected by 24-h pH-metry and 24-h impedance monitoring in 57/106 (53.7%) and 96/106 (90.5%) of patients, respectively (p<.00001). Patients with GERD diagnosed by 24-h impedance monitoring had a higher mean gastric pH (2.9 [median 1.3, IQR 5.3]) than those diagnosed by 24-h pH-metry (2.1 [median 1.4, IQR 2.6]) or both (1.6 [median 1.2, IQR 2.1]) (p=0.001).\n\nConclusion 24-h impedance monitoring detects GERD more often than 24-h pH-metry. Patients with higher mean gastric pH leading to non-acidic reflux were more often diagnosed by 24-h impedance monitoring than 24-h pH metry. Thus, 24-h pH-metry alone is inferior to additional impedance monitoring in the diagnosis of GERD, particularly in presence of low gastric acid secretion.\n\nKeywords Gastroesophageal reflux disease, 24-h pH-metry, 24-h impedance monitoring\n\n041\n\nA case report of contained upper cervical esophageal perforation masquerading as retropharyngeal abscess\n\nDinesh Kumar Dugganapalli, Umadevi Malladi, B Ramesh Kumar, Sahithya L\n\nCorrespondence – Dinesh Kumar Dugganapalli - dugganapalli@gmail.com\n\nDepartment of Medical Gastroenterology, Osmania Medical College, 5-1-876, Turrebaz Khan Road, Troop Bazaar, Koti, Hyderabad 500 095, India\n\nPerforation of the cervical esophagus is an infrequent but severe condition. Most patients are in their sixties, and esophageal perforation is slightly more common in males. The diagnosis and management of cervical esophageal perforation remains a challenging clinical problem. Several factors, including the difficulty of accessing the esophagus, the lack of a strong serosal layer, the unusual blood supply of the organ and the proximity of vital structures, all contribute to this condition’s high morbidity and to a mortality rate of at least 20%.
