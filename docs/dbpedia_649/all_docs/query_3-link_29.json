In addition to these main categories, there are also special awards for outstanding contributions to Indian literature.\n\nOver the years, many notable writers have won the Sahitya Akademi Award, including Jnanprakash Narayan Apte, Mulk Raj Anand, Raja Rao, Vijay Krishna Gowda, Uday Prakash, Amrita Pritam, Khushwant Singh, Mahasweta Devi, Shivani Chhatwal, and Imran Khan.\n\nEligibility criteria for nominees\n\nThe Sahitya Akademi Awards are given annually by the Indian government to writers in various languages of India. (Prose)\n\nThe eligibility criteria for nominees vary depending on the language category. In general, authors who have published at least one book in that particular language are eligible for consideration. Additionally, self-published books and those published by small presses may also be considered if they meet certain quality standards set by the awards committee. Writers from all over India are invited to nominate themselves or others for these prestigious awards.\n\nNomination process and timeline\n\nThe nomination process for Sahitya Akademi Awards is conducted by various literary organizations across India. (Organizations like Indian Literary Organization, Indian English Language Writers Association, etc.) These organizations nominate books in different categories such as fiction, non-fiction, poetry, drama, and children’s literature. Once nominated, the books are sent to the Sahitya Akademi headquarters in New Delhi where they are screened by a panel of judges.\n\nThe selection process involves several rounds of scrutiny, including preliminary reading, shortlisting, and final selection. The judges take into account factors such as literary merit, originality, language use, and relevance to contemporary society. The winners are announced every year on the 14th of November, which is celebrated as National Book Day in India.\n\nCategories awarded (e.g. literature, poetry, drama)\n\nThe Sahitya Akademi Awards are given in several categories for outstanding works of literature, poetry and drama. These include:\n\n– Literature: This category includes awards for novels, short stories, and other forms of prose fiction.\n\n– Poetry: This category includes awards for collections of poems as well as individual poems.\n\n– Drama: This category includes awards for plays and dramatic performances.\n\nThe Sahitya Akademi Awards were first presented in 1954 and have been held annually since then. They are one of India’s most prestigious literary awards and are administered by the Sahitya Akademi, an organization established by the Indian government to promote Indian literature both within and outside India.\n\nWinners and their works\n\nSure, here is the content for the Winners and Their Works section of your Sahitya Akademi Award article:\n\nThe winners of the Sahitya Akademi Awards are chosen by a panel of judges appointed by the Sahitya Akademi.

They also encourage writers to produce quality work that reflects the diverse culture and heritage of India.\n\nWinning a Sahitya Akademi Award is considered a great honor not just for the author but also for the language they write in. It brings recognition to the language and encourages more people to learn and appreciate it. Additionally, the awards have helped promote Indian literature globally and have contributed to its growing reputation.\n\nJury members and selection process\n\nThe Sahitya Akademi Awards are given annually by the Indian National Academy of Letters to writers in various languages spoken in India.\n\nThe jury members for each language category consist of eminent writers, scholars, and critics from that particular language. They evaluate the books submitted for consideration based on their literary merit, originality, and contribution to the language.\n\nThe selection process involves several rounds of evaluation by different juries at different levels. Firstly, the books are evaluated by regional-level juries who shortlist the best works published during the previous year. Then, these selected books are sent to the national-level jury which selects the final winners. In some cases, there may be additional sub-juries or committees involved in the selection process depending on the number of nominees and the complexity of the award categories.\n\nRecipients of special recognition awards\n\nThe Sahitya Akademi Awards are given by the Indian government to recognize excellence in literature. (Prose)\n\nThe recipients of special recognition awards include writers who have made significant contributions to Indian literature but may not have won the main award due to various reasons such as being too young or having insufficient publications. Some notable recipients of this award include Shrilal Shukla, Ashok Vajpeyi, and Amrita Pritam.\n\nThe Sahitya Akademi Awards are presented annually by the Indian government to writers in various languages of India.\n\nThe awards were first presented in 1954 and have been awarded every year since then. The awards ceremony is usually held in New Delhi, the capital city of India, in February or March.\n\nSome important dates and events associated with the awards ceremony include:\n\n– Nominations for the awards are accepted from various sources throughout the year.\n\n– A selection committee comprising eminent writers and scholars selects the winners from the nominated works.\n\n– The list of awardees is announced in December before the awards ceremony.\n\n– The awards ceremony itself takes place during a special function organized by the Sahitya Akademi, which is attended by prominent personalities from the world of literature and arts.\n\n– The awardees receive cash prizes and certificates of recognition.\n\nControversies surrounding the awards (if any)"
