        "text": "This chapter introduces the edited book 'Language and Social Cohesion in the Developing World'. The chapter discusses how the concept of social cohesion has been understood by scholars and practitioners and how the authors of the chapters in this book conceptualise it. It shows that the chapters fall into four strands and then it concludes by identifying eleven lessons which can be drawn from the collection.\n\nOne of the most important challenges facing multilingual education is the need to move beyond language communities. We discuss this issue in detail with reference to Singapore, giving specific attention to the case of the Indian community, where tensions between Tamil (the officially recognized mother tongue) and various non-Tamil Indian languages (NTILs) are traceable to the ideological influence of the notion of a language community. Without underestimating the significant difficulties that Singapore faces if it were to indeed try to move beyond language communities, we nevertheless make the point that such an attempt is necessary if multilingual education is to responsibly prepare students for negotiating the increasingly complex language-culture-identity nexus in a rapidly globalizing world. In the conclusion to our paper, we suggest possible ways in which this can be done. While the notion of a language community is often contrasted with that of a speech community, we observe that moving away from language communities towards speech communities does not sufficiently address the complex sociolinguistic realities that students have to grapple with. Instead, we offer a pedagogical alternative based on the notion of language as a semiotic resource. Jain, R. and Wee, L. (2015) Chapter 5 Multilingual education in Singapore: Beyond language communities? Pp 67-85 in Yiakoumetti, A. (Ed.) Multilingualism and Language in Education: Sociolinguistic and Pedagogical Perspectives from Commonwealth Countries. Cambridge University Press\n\nSri Lanka is a conflict-ridden postcolonial nation-state that was ravaged by a civil war. Largely excluded from mainstream representations of the ethnic conflict, Muslims constitute the country’s second largest minority group. In contrast to Sinhalas and Tamils, they define their ethnic identities on the basis of religion rather than language. In this article, I draw on research at a multilingual government school to explore how Muslim teachers and students made sense of Tamil- and English-medium education in relation to ethnic, religious, and class differences. I investigate how Tamil-medium Muslim teachers responded to critiques of their speech by asserting that their heterogeneous linguistic practices were inextricably connected to their distinct ethno-religious identities. Muslim students’ lack of fit with the ethnolinguistic affiliations presupposed by the school enabled them to embrace English-medium education. However, the English bilingual program complicated Muslims’ narratives of identity by underscoring the relevance of English to class dispositions. I argue that English impacts the fraught relations of Tamil and Sinhala to ethnopolitical identities and mediates everyday social relations.\n\nThis paper discusses issues in endangerment and postvernacularity in the context of Asia, a region with complex dynamics in multilingual ecologies that also includes the presence – dominance – of English, a language that entered the ecologies through colonisation. I use as illustration two minority communities with endangered vernaculars – the Malays of Sri Lanka, brought from various parts of the Malay archipelago by the Dutch and British colonial powers, and their vernacular Sri Lanka Malay, traditionally known as java, a mixed language of trilingual base (Malay, Sinhala, Tamil); and the Peranakans, descendants of southern Chinese merchants who settled in Malaya and intermarried with local women, and their vernacular Baba Malay, a restructured variety of Malay with southern Sinitic influences, usually referred to as patois. I query if linguistic and cultural loss is inevitable, or if such situations of shift – to a language of wider communication or an emergent variety – are in fact instances of empowerment and evolution in response to change, where a repositioning of the periphery in the new global economy brings greater accessibility to and participation in the Centre, and better adaptation for surviving and thriving."
