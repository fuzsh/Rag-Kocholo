The organization recognizes and honours exceptional writers through the Sahitya Akademi Awards for their outstanding contributions to literature. Since its inception, the Sahitya Akademi has dedicated itself to promoting and preserving the richness of Indian literature. The award promotes literary culture and encourages the writers of the country. These awards motivate the writers to work in their languages and preferred genres. Also, after producing good work, the writers are awarded a cash prize to motivate them to continue their work.\n\nAdditionally, the amazing part about these awards is that they recognize not only popular languages but also lesser-spoken dialects.. The Sahitya Akademi Awards helps the writers to come on one platform and interact with one another, building a sense of respect for each other. With the help of this platform, different writers talk and exchange ideas on writing and different topics. This, in turn, helps enhance national unity. So, it won’t be wrong to say that the Sahitya Awards are helpful in several ways. First, they recogniZe the literary talents of the country.

The Indian government also ensured that the literary work of all languages gets recognition so that no one feels discriminated against. The Akademi gives 24 awards to 24 different languages to date. This is done every year to promote reading habits.\n\nHistory\n\nSahitya Akademi has its roots tracing back to the British era in India. In 1944, the US government accepted the proposal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal. It aimed to set up a National Cultural Trust to promote regional cultural activities. This society was designed to consist of three Academies. The Academy of Letters was also a part of those three Academies.\n\nEven after Independence, the consensus among the government was regarding establishing three Academies. One for letters, another for visual arts, and a third society for dance, drama, and music. Discussions followed on setting up these cultural societies. The government was doubtful about their autonomy and structure. However, after some discussion, the Government of India established the National Academy of Letters in 1954. This was later known as Sahitya Akademi.\n\nFurthermore, the government decided it might be its duty to establish these societies, but once established, they can function as autonomous bodies.\n\nHeadquarters\n\nThe Sahitya Akademi headquarters are in New Delhi, at Ravindra Bhawan, 35 Ferozeshah Road.
