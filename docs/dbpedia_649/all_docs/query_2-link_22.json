        "text": "This discussion paper attempts at making a re-appraisal of some of the works on linguistic identity politics around Hindi-Urdu-Hindustani, in twentieth century India. It calls into question certain assumptions about Urdu. It argues that Urdu, contrary to common perceptions, was shedding its Persianization and its literature was drawing upon local imageries. Urdu’s anti-colonial and anti-separatist articulations have been highlighted. It underlines that marginalization of Urdu in late-colonial and post-colonial India was more because of majoritarian discriminations. Gandhiji’s project of ‘Hindustani’ and the inclusive nationalism of the Congress, threw inadequate weight behind the project. They were rather inclined more towards Hindi, and some important leaders of the Congress, more particularly in UP, were not only pro-Hindi but also anti-Urdu. The exclusion of the Hindustani from the broadcast plan of the All India Radio, by 1944-45, and the ill-fated Hindustani Prachar Sabha (1942) testify the majoritarian assertion of Hindi against Urdu. It further argues that Urdu was wrongly vilified to have played role in dividing India; this perception held in popular as well as academic domain, had its bearings upon the fate of Urdu in sovereign India."
