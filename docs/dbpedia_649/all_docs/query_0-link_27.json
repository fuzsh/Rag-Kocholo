        "text": "Amrita Pritam contributed immensely to Punjabi literature and left an permanent mark on Indian literature as a whole. With her unique style and powerful storytelling, she captured the hearts of readers, addressing profound themes like love, loss, and identity. She was considered the first prominent woman Punjabi poet, novelist, and essayist.\n\nAmrita Pritam, born on August 31, 1919, in Gujranwala, British India (now in Pakistan), was a highly acclaimed Indian writer, poet, and essayist. She was born into a Sikh family and grew up in a progressive environment that nurtured her intellectual curiosity and love for literature. Her early life was steeped in the cultural richness of Punjab, which played a pivotal role in shaping her artistic sensibilities. Growing up in a household that cherished education and literature, Amrita’s love for poetry and writing blossomed at a young age. Her father, a scholar and poet, encouraged her pursuits, nurturing her talent as a budding wordsmith.\n\nAmrita Pritam’s early life experiences, including witnessing the turbulent times of the Partition of India in 1947, deeply influenced her writing. The partition left an permanent mark on her, and it became a recurring theme in her works. She eloquently captured the pain, loss, and human suffering that accompanied this tragic event, giving voice to the emotions of countless individuals affected by the partition.\n\nFrom a young age, Amrita Pritam displayed exceptional talent in writing, and she began publishing her poems and stories in literary magazines. Her remarkable abilities soon gained recognition, and she emerged as one of the most prominent literary figures in India. Her literary journey began with her first collection of poems, “Amrit Lehran” (The Immortal Wave), published in 1936 when she was just 16 years old. Her words resonated with readers, and her innate ability to articulate complex emotions garnered praise from literary circles. As she continued to pen verses, her reputation as a poet of immense promise spread far and wide.\n\nHer poignant poem, “Ajj Aakhaan Waris Shah Nu” (Today I Invoke Waris Shah), became an anthem of pain and sorrow, a tribute to the victims of partition. Through her words, she immortalized the human cost of political conflicts.\n\nThe poetess is in a state of extreme sadness. She implores Waris Shah, her muse, to see what is happening in her beloved birthplace. Corpses are lying in the fields. Everything she sees has turned into red. The land of Heer–Ranjha is playing holi with human blood. The partition of India is the root cause of all those evils. Humanity is at stake. The message of love and purity of compassion is lost from Punjab. The poetess hopes that the people of Punjab will listen to her lamentation and stop this nonsensical bloodshed.\n\nAmrita Pritam’s poetic expressions of love challenged societal norms and transcended boundaries. Her most celebrated work, “Pinjar” (The Skeleton), explored the complexities of love amidst the backdrop of partition. The novel depicted the story of Puro, a woman abducted during the turmoil of partition, and her subsequent journey of self-discovery and resilience.\n\nThroughout her career, Amrita Pritam authored an extensive body of work in both poetry and prose. She fearlessly explored various themes such as love, longing, identity, and the human condition. Her writings resonated with readers from all walks of life, and she became known for her ability to evoke deep emotions through her words.\n\nAmrita Pritam’s contributions extended beyond her literary achievements. She was actively involved in social and political movements, advocating for women’s rights, gender equality, and social justice. Her strong feminist voice challenged traditional norms and inspired generations of women to assert their independence and voice their opinions.\n\nAmrita Pritam, a name that resonates with literary brilliance and social impact, stands as an icon in the realm of Indian literature. Her journey as a writer and poet embodies the spirit of fearlessness and the pursuit of individuality. Through her evocative prose and poetic verses, Amrita Pritam explored profound human emotions, challenged societal norms, and advocated for gender equality, leaving an mark on the world of literature and beyond.\n\nAmrita Pritam’s impact on Punjabi literature and Indian literature as a whole cannot be overstated. Her works continue to be celebrated for their profound insights, lyrical beauty, and enduring relevance. Even after her passing in 2005, her legacy lives on, inspiring aspiring writers and captivating readers with the timeless power of her words.\n\nAmrita Pritam was a woman who lived by her own rules. Her work is drenched in her longing for love and soaked in the pain of loss that marked her journey throughout life. She was a writer, a mystic, a poet, a rebel and a human being par excellence. She could be a synonym for ‘Freedom’\n\nShe says she was very unaware when she was engaged in the age of 16, this is how women’s lives have always been. You build their lives around men, for men. She explicitly talks against the institution of matrimony.\n\nWe can see that in a few lines from her poem ‘The Breadwinner’\n\n‘My breadwinner\n\nI have eaten your salt\n\nAnd I must obey the salt\n\nAs my father will.’\n\nShe later says-\n\n‘My breadwinner\n\nI am a doll of flesh\n\nFor you to play with’\n\n[In the lines from this poem, we see how she’s asserting the fact that women have to obey their patriarchal guardians as they are their breadwinners. The lack of economic independence paralyses women of owning their agencies, she later says how women fail to have ownership of their bodies too. It is the men who have perpetual entitlement to their bodies, as she says – I am a doll of flesh for you to play with.]\n\nEarly Life and Education:\n\nFamily background and upbringing:\n\nAmrita Pritam hailed from a Sikh family with roots in Punjab. Her father, Kartar Singh Hitkari, was a poet and a scholar of the Braj Bhasha language and the editor of a literary journal, while her mother, Raj Bibi, who was a school teacher, deeply spiritual. Growing up in a household that valued literature and artistic expression, Amrita Pritam was exposed to a vibrant cultural milieu from an early age. Having lost her mother at the age of nine, Amrita was brought up by her father, a fakir by nature but who remained a householder for her sake. An independent minded Amrita rejected God when he refused to answer her prayers on her mother’s death and became an atheist. After her mother’s death, she moved to Lahore where she was raised by her father.\n\nShe was growing into a willful woman who refused to accept differential treatment of lower castes in her home.\n\nEarly exposure to literature and storytelling:\n\nAmrita Pritam’s love for literature was kindled by the stories she heard from her grandmother and other family members. She was captivated by the rich oral traditions of Punjab and the folktales that spoke of love, bravery, and the human experience. These early storytelling experiences instilled in her a deep appreciation for narratives and laid the foundation for her own storytelling abilities.\n\nEducational background and schooling:\n\nAmrita Pritam attended the Sacred Heart Convent School in Gujranwala, where she received a formal education. Her schooling exposed her to various subjects, but it was literature and languages that truly captivated her. She developed a profound love for Punjabi, Hindi, and Urdu literature, exploring the works of renowned poets and authors.\n\nLiterary mentors and influences:\n\nDuring her early years, Amrita Pritam found inspiration in the works of prominent Punjabi and Urdu poets such as Shiv Kumar Batalvi, Sahir Ludhianvi, and Faiz Ahmed Faiz. Their poetry touched her soul and shaped her own writing style. She drew from their literary techniques and themes, infusing her work with passion, introspection, and social consciousness. She writes on issues such as matrimony, economic slavery, extra-marital affairs, annihilation of oneself and women provoked anguish among people. Her writings were read as blasphemous and without the filters that a woman must use while expressing.\n\nPersonal Life and Struggles:\n\nAmrita Pritam was first married to Pritam Singh to young age of 16, a hosiery merchant in Lahore, she felt suffocated in a marriage and marriage was troubled, so she left her husband in 1960. They have got two children, Navraj Kwatra and Kandla. Amrita Pritam couldn’t stay in the marriage after she found out that her husband was having an extramarital affair. And chose not to be an obstacle. She was not blaming her husband to be disdainful, rather she liberated him. And that act of liberating someone else automatically liberated her too. Amrita had begun to write poetry by this time, and had fallen in love with another upcoming poet, Sahir.\n\nA dreamer who listened to her own drummer, she chose to accept the partnership of renowned artist and writer Imroz for 41 long years, without marriage. He’s known as Inderjeet Imroz, and he’s ten years younger than Amrita. When she’d broken up with Sahir Ludhianvi, he was still holding her through the saddest days of loneliness. Imroz had become her man Friday, so much so that Imroz would drive her to and from Parliament when Amrita was appointed to the Rajya Sabha. He was her lover, companion, adviser, errand boy and man about the house all rolled into one. One could write volumes about Imroz and Amrita, but it suffices to say that such lovers are beyond the physical. Imroz loved her deeply, and that was the fulfilment of a dream for Amrita. And it was love without borders and no conditions at all. Amrita’s love of Sahir was well known to Imroz, but he did not resent it. Actually, they’ve become friends, and Imroz’s designed the cover of Sahir’s book Aao koyee khwab bunne (Let us weave a dream). He’d known how much she loved Sahir, but he’d also known how much he loved Amrita himself. He didn’t care about anything else in life except being with her because of his love for Amrita. She wrote book about Imroz and herself.\n\n“In the Times of Love and Longing” is a book by Amrita Pritam and Imroz. It is a collection of love letters between the two, providing an interesting insight into the personalities of two highly creative minds. The reader gets intimate glimpses of the extraordinary relationship between the renowned author and poet and her artist companion. The handwritten letter delivered by the government postal service was the only recourse available to Amrita and Imroz while they charted their careers in different cities, Amrita in Delhi and Imroz in Mumbai. And they discussed each day’s happening with each other, even if it took days for the other to receive the letter.\n\nThese letters offer a peek into these creative minds, they are also a record of social history of those times, a far cry from modern quick service times.\n\nAmrita Pritam’s life was full of struggle. One million people, Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims died from communal violence that followed the partition of India in 1947, and left Amrita Pritam a Punjabi refugee at age 28 when she left Lahore and moved to New Delhi. She moved from Lahore to New Delhi as a Punjabi refugee, and has been trying to rebuild her life.\n\nAmrita Pritam had remained strong through all these difficulties and continued to write.

Pritam has written about events that touched her and shaped her personality. In the year 1976 this book was published as “Rasidi Ticket” in Punjabi language. In 1977 it was translated in Hindi and English\n\nThe title of the book, “Rasidi Ticket,” was inspired by a joke made by Khushwant Singh, who once told Amrita Pritam that the story of her life was so inconsequential and tiny that it could be written at the back of a revenue stamp. Keeping this joke in mind, Amrita Pritam penned her autobiography and entitled it Rasidi Ticket or The Revenue Stamp.\n\nIn her autobiographies, which were written years after her wedding, Amrita confessed that she did not have a healthy relationship with her husband and that her marriage was an unhappy experience. In 1944, she met Sahir Ludhianvi, a fellow poet, who would later turn into a prominent film lyricist. The story of this love is depicted in her autobiography, “Rasidi Ticket” (Revenue Stamp). She finally left her husband Pritam Singh in 1960, when her fascination for Sahir reached its peak. However, Amrita Pritam always knew that it was almost impossible for her to have an effective relationship with Sahir Ludhianvi, when another woman, singer Sudha Malhotra came into Sahir’s life.\n\nAmrita Pritam later found solace in the companionship of Indrajeet Imroz, a prominent artist and writer. Although the couple never formally married, they spent more than forty years of their life together. Their love life together is almost the subject of undying with a book titled ‘Amrita Imroz: A Love Story’.\n\nA woman has to suffer a lot and they are the one who are forced to follow the unnecessary rules made by the society because they are too scared to fight. But Amrita Pritam had that courage and that is the reason why she was able to fight not only for herself but also for others. Amrita Pritam never lied to herself and this is also evident in her autobiography. When she was asked about her life, she replied in this manner: Don’t ask me what I gained in life or what I lost.
