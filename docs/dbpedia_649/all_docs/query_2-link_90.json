It was Rs 5,000 in 1955.\n\nNew Delhi: On the occasion of National Hindi Day or Hindi Diwas, it is inevitable to recall prominent authors or poets in Hindi literature. From Makhanlal Chaturvedi to Daya Prakash Sinha, and from Mahadevi Verma to Mridula Garg, the best way to do that is to trace the basics, the Sahitya Akademi Award. The award started in 1955 and has been given ever since. India is a country with hundreds of languages. The constitution of India, in its eighth schedule, recognises 22 Indian languages. Hindi is one of the recognised languages. The Sahitya Akademi is given in 24 languages, the languages in the constitution and English and Rajasthani.\n\nAbout Sahitya Akademi\n\nThe Sahitya Akademi was inaugurated by the Government of India on March 12, 1954. To set high literary standards in the country, the Akademi was set forth by the Government of India Resolution. The objective of the organisation is to actively develop Indian letters, coordinate literary activities, and nurture and foster all the Indian languages.\n\nEventually, it is being done to promote the cultural unity of the country. Even though it is set up by the government, the Akademi is an autonomous organisation and was registered as a society on January 7, 1956, under the Societies Registration Act, 1860. Since its inception, the award recognises the most outstanding books of literary merit.\n\nPrize: The amount of the award has been updated to Rs 1,00,000 in 2009. It was Rs 5,000 in 1955.\n\nLanguages: It is awarded in Assamese, Bengali, Bodo, Dogri, English, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Kashmiri, Konkani, Maithili, Malayalam, Manipuri, Marathi, Nepali, Odia, Punjabi, Rajasthani, Sanskrit, Santhali, Sindhi, Tamil, Telugu and Urdu.\n\nInitiated in 1954, the first Akademi award in Hindi literature was given in 1955. He was Makhanlal Chaturvedi who won the award for his poetry ‘Him-Taringini’.\n\nMakhanlal Chaturvedi: Makhanlal Chaturvedi was a writer, poet, essayist, playwright, and journalist. He was born on April 4, 1889, in Babai, Madhya Pradesh and contributed significantly to the Chhayawad era of Hindi literature. The prolific write was awarded the Padma Bhushan award in 1963.\n\nDaya Prakash Sinha: He recently won the Sahitya Akademi award in Hindi for the year 2021 for his play ‘Samrat Ashok’. The list consists of names such as Rahul Sankrityayan, Ramdhari Singh ‘Dinkar’, Harivansh Rai Bachchan, and other notable people.\n\nHere’s a list of all the winners of the Sahitya Akademi award for their work in the Hindi language."
