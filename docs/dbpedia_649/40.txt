The Sahitya Akademi is an independent organization established by the Government of India in 1954. The organization recognizes and honours exceptional writers through the Sahitya Akademi Awards for their outstanding contributions to literature. Since its inception, the Sahitya Akademi has dedicated itself to promoting and preserving the richness of Indian literature. The award promotes literary culture and encourages the writers of the country. These awards motivate the writers to work in their languages and preferred genres.

All About Sahitya Akademi Award

The government of India officially introduced Sahitya Akademi on 12 March 1954. The purpose behind the setup of this institution was simple. It aimed to recognise and award notable literary works. The government believed that doing so could be quite helpful in promoting literary activities in the country. The Indian government also ensured that the literary work of all languages gets recognition so that no one feels discriminated against. The Akademi gives 24 awards to 24 different languages to date. This is done every year to promote reading habits.

History

Sahitya Akademi has its roots tracing back to the British era in India. In 1944, the US government accepted the proposal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal. It aimed to set up a National Cultural Trust to promote regional cultural activities. This society was designed to consist of three Academies. The Academy of Letters was also a part of those three Academies.

Even after Independence, the consensus among the government was regarding establishing three Academies. One for letters, another for visual arts, and a third society for dance, drama, and music. Discussions followed on setting up these cultural societies. The government was doubtful about their autonomy and structure. However, after some discussion, the Government of India established the National Academy of Letters in 1954. This was later known as Sahitya Akademi.

Furthermore, the government decided it might be its duty to establish these societies, but once established, they can function as autonomous bodies.
