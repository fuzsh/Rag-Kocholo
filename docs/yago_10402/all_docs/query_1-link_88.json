        "text": "“Altiplano”\n\nDirectors: Peter Brosens, Jessica Woodworth\n\nProducer: Bo Films\n\nStars: Jasmine Tabatabai, Olivier Gourmet, Magaly Solier\n\nThe scoop: Following first-film kudos at Venice in 2006 with spiritual drama “Khadak,” Brosens and Woodworth head for the Andes for this tale of sacrifice and redemption, centered on a femme war photographer. Ambitious location work promises strong atmosphere. Project formerly known as “Fragments of Grace.”\n\nSales: None\n\n“Rapt”\n\nDirector: Lucas Belvaux\n\nProducers: Entre Chien et Loup, Agat Film\n\nStars: Yvan Attal, Anne Consigny\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe scoop: The 1970s kidnapping of a Belgian aristo and businessman reveals a dissolute lifestyle, making freedom feel worse than captivity. Actor-director Belvaux cements a reputation for issues-based thrillers after the success of Cannes-competing “La Raison du plus faible” in 2006.\n\nSales: Films Distribution\n\n“Mister Nobody”\n\nDirector: Jaco Van Dormael\n\nProducer: Philippe Godeau (Somebody Prods. )\n\nStars: Jared Leto, Sarah Polley, Diane Kruger\n\nThe scoop: Long-awaited return of “Toto the Hero” director Van Dormael with tale of lost love across alternate realities. Hotly tipped for Cannes, this English-language production has a budget big enough to indulge helmer’s taste for magic realism. Extensively presold, but not yet Stateside.\n\nSales: Wild Bunch\n\n“Quartier Lointain”\n\nDirector: Sam Garbarski (above)\n\nProducer: Entre Chien et Loup\n\nStars: Leo Legrand, Jonathan Zaccai, Alexandra Maria Lara\n\nThe scoop: A 50-year-old man is transported back into the body of his adolescent self, perhaps allowing him to solve the mystery of his father’s disappearance. After the English-language sex dramedy “Irina Palm,” helmer Garbarski brings Jiro Taniguchi’s manga comic to 1960s France. Air (“The Virgin Suicides”) provides the soundtrack."
