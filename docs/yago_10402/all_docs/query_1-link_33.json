        "text": "Born in France but of Spanish ancestry, Eric Caravaca is a dramatic actor who has also directed. After graduating from the French National Academy of Dramatic Arts (CNSAD) in Paris, he went to New York and studied at the Actors' Studio. He returned to France and won praise for his work in Beckett's \"Waiting for Godot,\" then made his feature debut in Diane Bertrand's \"Un samedi sur la terre\" in 1996. His starring role in the 1999 drama \"C'est quoi la vie?\" earned him a Most Promising Actor CÃ©sar and in 2001 he was nominated in the best actor category for his role as a wounded World War I soldier in \"The Officer's Ward.\" He turned in another strong performance in the highly praised drama \"Son frÃ¨re,\" and in 2005 he tried his hand at directing with \"The Passenger,\" a film he co-wrote and starred in. He also had a starring role in the 2006 thriller \"La raison du plus faible\" and shared the screen with legendary French actor Michel Piccoli in \"Restless.\""
