The film focuses on a journalist charged with defamation and a mysterious, antisocial, rebel hacker chic investigating the obscure past of a rich industrialist family.\n\nGaspar Noë describes his Palme d'Or nominated latest film Enter the Void as a \"psychedelic melodrama\". Inspired by the Tibetan Book of the Dead, this avant-garde film about the drug-fuelled journeys of two siblings going to and fro between reality and hallucinations cannot in any way be explained with \"contemporary cinematic terminology\". Director Gaspar Noë will be in Istanbul to meet his audience before the screening.\n\nOne of the most talked about productions at 2009 Toronto Film Festival, Deliver Us From Evil is another provocative midnight film.

Yorgos Lanthimos' film revolving around a family living in absolute disconnection from society does resemble Haneke and Lars von Trier in its harshness, coldness and distance.\n\nPraised with Best Director Award at Venice Film Festival and the UNICEF award, in Women Without Men four women reflect upon life in Iran during re-accession of the Shah top the throne in 1953. Toronto Film Festival hailed Iranian female director Shirin Neshat's debut film for its political-poetic temperament.\n\nKids' Menu\n\nSponsored by JOJO, Kids' Menu has been a part of the festival programme for four years running and become a favourite amongst families as well as children.

With primitive examples appearing in the 1930's, Estonia's animated filming initiatives peaked in the 1950's parallel to the establishment of puppet film studios. Today the country deserves a respectable name in the animated film arena thanks to a number of original productions.\n\nFilm enthusiasts will have the chance of seeing 4 short films by artist Priit Pärn, one of the most acclaimed representatives of Estonian animated cinema since the 1970's. A passionate illustrator and animator Pärn frequently resorts to black humour and surrealism in his expression. As a guest of the Festival Priit Pärn will be in Istanbul to give a master class on cinema. The second part of the programme is a pick'n mix of Estonian animation cinema with six of the most striking productions from the past five years. This section is also dubbed as ISTLLbul* - Tallinn in Istanbul (pronounced istallinnbul).\n\nHOMAGE TO GREAT MASTERS:\n\nPOET, CHRONICLER AND INSURGENT: THE SAVING GRACE OF ELIA SULEIMAN\n\nCompared with Jacques Tati and Buster Keaton for his \"thorny\" sense of humour, Palestinian director Elia Suleiman is one of the masters appearing in this year's Istanbul Film Festival. Festival goers will get the opportunity to watch the entire filmography of the director/actor, including Cannes Film Festival Palm d'Or contestant \"The Time That Remains\". Suleiman questions being a Palestinian in his trademark poetic style. After long years of what he terms \"voluntary exile\" in New York and Paris, Elia Suleiman will be in Istanbul as the Festival's guest of honour and give a master class.\n\nJOSEPH LOSEY: CLASS AND POWER\n\nAnother master featured at Istanbul Film Festival's Homage to Masters is Bertolt Brecht's disciple and comrade, Harold Pinter's friend and colleague, the acclaimed director of violent love stories drenched in emotional instability, sexual dilemmas and exclusion, the great Joseph Losey. Although seen as one of the scapegoats during McCarthy's commie-hunt, Losey is still considered as one the \"great directors\" of post-World War II European cinema. Curated by Fatih Özgüven, film enthusiasts will see seven Losey films from his unique cinematic career spanning 4 decades.\n\nIN MEMORY OF...\n\nThe Festival dedicates this year's commemoration to French director Eric Rohmer and Turkish directors Zeki Ökten, Halit Refiğ and Ahmet Uluçay who we lost in 2009.\n\nBesides Zeki Ökten's Pehlivan (Wrestler), Halit Refiğ's Gurbet Kuşları (Birds of Foreign Land), Eric Rohmer's Ma nuit chez Maud (My Night with Maud) film lovers will also get the chance of once more seeing the late Ahmet Uluçay's Karpuz Kabuğundan Gemiler Yapmak / Boats Out of Watermelon Rinds.\n\nMEETING ON THE BRIDGE\n\nAttracting ever more attention by film industry professionals the fourth \"Meeting on the Bridge\" seminar series will be held in scope of the International Istanbul Film Festival between April 12-16.\n\nMeanwhile, the third Feature Film Project Development Workshop, open to Turkish feature film projects, offers potential filmmakers the chance of face-to-face meetings with representatives from Arte, Eurimages, Fortissimo Films, Binger Lab and other international organisations about financial planning and project presentations to a professional audience.
