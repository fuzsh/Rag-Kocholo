        "text": "Or a social drama, or social crime movie, but one thing sure, it is definitely a social feature, some kind of Ken Loach oriented film. A story about unemployement, despair, precariousness, an accurate analysis of the social collapse of ordinary people, workers in gigantic factory who dream of a better life. Dialogues are sharp, powerful, chiseled as diamonds and contributes to make this topic even more convincing. It also may be painful to watch for people whose financial, social condition is close to the characters in the film. Lucas Belvaux the director, plays in this film, but as I have already said, Lucas Belvaux in not convincing in his roles when he speaks. He is not convincing at all. He has a presence as an actor, yes, he is a very efficient, convincing director, speaking of daring, interesting schemes, topics, I never miss any of his movies; but when he speaks, sorry, I have seen amateur actors playing better than him. This is not a caper, heist film, it is not question here og hoodlums, but poor blue collars dudes trying to make it in their gloomy, hopeless life.\n\n0 out of 0 found this helpful.
