        "text": "COLOGNE, Germany – Franchophrenia, a film co-directed by James Franco and Ian Olds using footage from Franco’s stint on TV soap General Hospital, will have its world premiere at this year’s Rotterdam International Film Festival (Jan. 25-Feb. 5).\n\nThe feature, alternatively titled Don’t Kill Me, I Know Where the Baby Is, is described as a “humorous psycho-thriller.” Franco and Olds made it by writing a new script for existing footage shot by Franco on General Hospital, where the Oscar-nominated actor has a recurring role as an avant-guarde artist called Franco. Franchophrenia will screen in Rotterdam’s main Spectrum Section.\n\nOther Spectrum highlights include Aki Kaurismaki‘s Oscar hopeful Le Havre, Andrea Arnold‘s Wuttering Heights reboot and the award-winning Swedish drama Play from director Ruben Ostlund. 16 Spectrum films will be world premieres, among them Pat Holden‘s Yorkshire drama When the Lights Go Out, Argentine feature Cornelia at Her Mirror by Daniel Rosenfeld and Le reste du monde from French helmer Damien Odoul which stars Marie-Eve Nadeau, Mathieu Amalric and Emmanuelle Beart.\n\nThe full 2012 Spectrum lineup:\n\nOpening Film: 38 Witnesses Dir Lucas Belvaux\n\nClosing Film: The Hunter Dir. Daniel Nettheim"
