With Catherine Jacob as the blonde-bobbed leader who never met an angry crowd she couldn’t make angrier.\n\nFRANCE / BELGIUM • 2017 • 117 MINS. • IN FRENCH WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES\n\nDISTRIB FILMS\n\nReviews\n\n“Berthier is played by the always avuncular André Dussollier, so the revelation that he is the local contact for the dark forces behind the charismatic politician Agnes Dorgelle carries some of the shock we felt when Henry Fonda killed the kid in ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST (1968). (It) may be a good rather than great film, but it is brave, committed and, in its choice of tone, extremely timely. For once, ‘good’ is what we need.”\n\n– Nick Roddick, Sight & Sound\n\n“The drama is well-paced, and all of the actors are wonderful. Mr. Dussollier, a regular presence in the late works of Alain Resnais, is resourceful in communicating Berthier’s disturbing dual nature, and Ms. Dequenne remains appealing even when her character is making the most grievously ill-advised choices. THIS IS OUR LAND is scariest and most effective in its illumination of the appeal of today’s particular brand of French nationalism. [Catherine] Jacob’s work as Agnes galvanizes.”\n\n– Glenn Kenny, The New York Times\n\n“A slow-motion horror movie. A gutsy, discomforting movie about going along to get along, and just how dangerous that impulse can ultimately be. Quite bracing to experience the French equivalent of a two-time Obama voter who flipped to Trump.”\n\n– Mike D’Angelo, The AV Club\n\n“A thinly veiled assault on France’s far-right National Front. Candidates and volunteers are briefed on how to subtly play upon the prejudices and fears of potential supporters. These sequences carry a plausible tang of authenticity, while the gradual process by which the ‘apolitical’ Pauline.. is drawn into the (the party’s) web also feels convincingly organic.”\n\n– Neil Young, The Hollywood Reporter"
