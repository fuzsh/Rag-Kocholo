        "text": "Political dramas past and present look set to be centre-screen at this year's Cannes film festival, which opens on May 17. The shortlist for European cinema's highest accolade, the Palme d'Or, includes Ken Loach's The Wind That Shakes the Barley, an exploration of the Irish struggle for independence, Nanni Moretti's satire about the soon-to-be-former Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, and Sofia Coppola's Marie-Antoinette, an adaptation of Antonia Fraser's biography of the French Revolution's most famous victim.\n\nAlso in competition for European cinema's most prestigious award are Pedro Almodóvar's Volver and US director Richard Linklater's adaptation of Fast Food Nation, Eric Schlosser's pop-sociology study of the all-American diet.\n\nKen Loach, who has won various awards at Cannes including a lifetime achievement award in 2004, has had seven previous films nominated for the Palme d'Or, all without crowning success. Filmed in Cork and Kerry, and starring Breakfast on Pluto's Cillian Murphy alongside Liam Cunningham, The Wind That Shakes tells the story of two brothers who fought together during the Irish war of independence before finding themselves on opposing sides during the eventual civil war.\n\nThe Wind That Shakes is not the only British nomination: the shortlist also features the Red Road, a darkly emotional tale of psychological obsession directed by Andrea Arnold who won an Oscar in 2003 for her short Wasp. Red Road is Arnold's first full-length feature.\n\nThe head of the UK Film Council's New Cinema Fund, which provided backing for both Loach and Arnold, saw the shortlist as a confirmation of the health of the British film industry.\n\n\"It is fantastic that the Cannes selection committee has selected both Loach's and Arnold's films for competition not only for the films and film-makers themselves but because it also confirms that British film talent continues to produce films which excite the most prestigious film festival in the world,\" Paul Trijbits, head of the fund, said.\n\nIn contrast to last year's lineup, only a handful of this year's 19 nominations come from directors who have previously won the award. The biggest guns for the award are likely to be shortlist regular Pedro Almodóvar and Italian director Nanni Moretti, who won the prize for 2001's unsentimental study of grief and the limits of psychoanalysis, The Son's Room. His high-pitched satire of Berlusconi, The Caiman, opened some two weeks before the hard fought recent Italian elections.\n\nThe festival is courting further controversy in its widely-reported decision to open with Ron Howard's adaptation of The Da Vinci Code, which will screen out of competition.\n\nThe 59th Cannes film festival will open on May 17, with the awards announced at the close on May 28.\n\nFilms in competition:\n\nFlandres (Bruno Dumont)\n\nSelon Charlie (Nicole Garcia)\n\nQuand J'etais Chanteur (When I was a Singer) (Xavier Giannoli)\n\nVolver (Pedro Almodóvar)\n\nRed Road (Andrea Arnold)\n\nLa Raison du Plus Faible (The Weakest is Always Right) (Lucas Belvaux)\n\nIndegènes (Days Of Glory) (Rachid Bouchareb)\n\nIklimer (Les Climates) (Nuri Bilge Ceylan)\n\nMarie-Antoinette (Sofia Coppola)\n\nJuventude Em Marcha (Pedro Costa)\n\nPan's Labyrinth (Guillermo del Toro)\n\nBabel (Alejandro González Iñárritu)\n\nLights in the Dusk (Aki Kaurismaki)\n\nSouthland Tales (Richard Kelly)\n\nFast Food Nation (Richard Linklater)\n\nThe Wind that Shakes the Barley (Ken Loach)\n\nSummer Palace (Ye Lou)\n\nThe Caiman (Nanni Moretti)\n\nL'Amico di Famiglia (Friend Of the Family) (Paolo Sorrentino)\n\nOpening film:\n\nThe Da Vinci Code (Ron Howard)\n\nClosing film:\n\nTransylvania (Tony Gatlif)\n\nOfficial selection - out of competition special screenings:\n\nUnited 93 (Paul Greengrass)\n\nX-Men 3: The Last Stand (Brett Ratner)\n\nOver The Hedge (Tim Johnson, Karey Kirkpatrick)"
