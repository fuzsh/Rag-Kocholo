        "text": "I don't usually post non-cinema related stuff here, cause I don't know how to write about anything else, but this blogathon honors a documentary from Toronto 2005, Berlin 2006 and Sundance 2006 : Leonard Cohen: I'm Your Man (2005/Lian Lunson/USA) I haven't seen the film unfortunately (not distributed in France yet). Although I can't miss the opportunity to show my admiration for my most favorite songwriter with a quick post.\n\nLeonard Cohen is the anti-hero, a romantic loser who can't afford love. He remembers affairs in hotels around the world. He collides supreme poetic moments and crude erotism in a novelist way. Solitude, existential struggle, self-pity modesty, political cynicism, resistance of ideas and revolution. He's a modernist akin to Antonioni, Bergman or Cassavetes. I like the melancholy of his stories, its indirect angles, his mundane poetry, his careful and useless details that make all the difference in memories.\n\nNot to mention the beauty of his chords.\n\nI'm Your Man is my dearest song for it will always remind me of my girlfriend.\n\nFew favorites among many : So Long Marianne; Hey, That's No Way To Say Goodbye; Suzanne; Who By Fire?; Sisters of Mercy; Chelsea Hotel #2; The Partisan...\n\nAnd of course :\n\nFamous Blue Rain Coat\n\nComposed and written by Leonard Cohen, 1971\n\nIt's four in the morning, the end of December\n\nI'm writing you now just to see if you're better\n\nNew York is cold, but I like where I'm living\n\nThere's music on Clinton Street all through the evening.\n\nI hear that you're building your little house deep in the desert\n\nYou're living for nothing now, I hope you're keeping some kind of record.\n\nYes, and Jane came by with a lock of your hair\n\nShe said that you gave it to her\n\nThat night that you planned to go clear\n\nDid you ever go clear?\n\nAh, the last time we saw you you looked so much older\n\nYour famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder\n\nYou'd been to the station to meet every train\n\nAnd you came home without Lili Marlene\n\nAnd you treated my woman to a flake of your life\n\nAnd when she came back she was nobody's wife.\n\nWell I see you there with the rose in your teeth\n\nOne more thin gypsy thief\n\nWell I see Jane's awake\n\n--She sends her regards.\n\nAnd what can I tell you my brother, my killer\n\nWhat can I possibly say?\n\nI guess that I miss you, I guess I forgive you\n\nI'm glad you stood in my way.\n\nIf you ever come by here, for Jane or for me\n\nYour enemy is sleeping, and his woman is free.\n\nYes, and thanks, for the trouble you took from her eyes\n\nI thought it was there for good so I never tried.\n\nAnd Jane came by with a lock of your hair\n\nShe said that you gave it to her\n\nThat night that you planned to go clear\n\nSincerely, L. Cohen\n\nIt's like a great film. It's not a song, it's a letter. It's not a letter, it's a written monologue. It could be the synopsis of a Cassavetes film : New York, a love triangle, brotherly friendship, love/hate antagonism, miscommunication. A woman encompassed in a firstname. A suggested past between the characters, symbolized by objects (raincoat, lock of hair, rose), establishing a powerful melodrama without the need to elaborate any further, everything is there.\n\nI'd like to mention Jeff Buckley's interpretation of Hallelujah, because he plays it even better than its author and transcends it. Simply magnificent!\n\nCheck out also other participants of this Blog-a-thon :"
