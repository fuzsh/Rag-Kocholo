        "text": "Know your Alejandro González Iñárritu from your Nuri Bilge Ceylan? Me neither. But that should not stop you having a punt on the most baffling lucky dip of all: the Cannes film festival. For years only those on air-kissing terms with the jury have dared place any kind of bets on which film would collect the Palme d'Or. But thanks to online betting, punters are beginning to dabble.\n\nOn bodog.com, a Costa Rican-based betting site, there is a wide-open field among the 19 competition films, which include offerings from high-profile names such as Sofia Coppola and Richard Linklater. Unsurprisingly, the big names currently hold the shortest odds. Coppola's adaptation of Antonia Fraser's biography of Marie-Antoinette is favourite at 11/2, followed by Pedro Almodóvar's latest film, Volver, starring Penélope Cruz, at 6/1. After building a formidable reputation with Amores Perros and 21 Grams, Iñárritu is third favourite with Babel at 7/1.\n\nIf you boast significant knowledge of Belgian cinema, you might want to back one of the rank outsiders, La Raison du Plus Faible, directed by Lucas Belvaux, at 20/1. In English, that's The Weakest Is Always Right. Could be an omen.\n\nIt could boil down to the geopolitics of the jury: this year, the nine includes two Brits, Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Roth, with Samuel L Jackson completing a hefty Anglo-American voting bloc. So could Ken Loach - who has never won a Palme d'Or - finally scoop the big one for The Wind That Shakes the Barley, a tale of two brothers who fought in the Irish war of independence? Rupert Adams of William Hill offers a cautionary advice. You can't rely on British judges backing British films, he suggests, because of the \"guilt\" factor.\n\nWilliam Hill took £100,000 on the Oscars but won't offer a market of odds on Cannes. \"If any bookie does, they're mad,\" says Adams. \"So many insiders are in the know.\" But if you don't try to bet 10 grand, William Hill will consider giving you odds.\n\nOr you could go to Betfair, offering a Cannes market on the Palme for the first time this year. \"We certainly expect some interest,\" says Jack Houghton of Betfair. \"Year-on-year since 2003 we've had an annual growth in film award betting of over 120% per year. This is driven by a new breed of punter - particularly women - who aren't interested in traditional sports betting, but feel they have an 'edge' with this kind of thing.\"\n\nOne cautionary tale: at the Oscars, more than 7,000 gamblers tried their luck on Betfair's 24 markets. The big money went on Brokeback Mountain, but the big prize went to Crash."
