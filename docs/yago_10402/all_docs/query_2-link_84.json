        "text": "A deeply French setup (philosopher professor who doesn't even OWN a television meets-cute with a rural hairdresser obsessed with celeb news) gives way to a less and less comical and more and more ruminative consideration of the pros and cons of \"opposites attract.\" I haven't seen Belvaux's thrillers, but this moves with the same kind of practiced control you get in something like McTiernan's Thomas Crown Affair, albeit with far less showiness. But the sense of knowing exactly when to pivot keeps this from slipping into the usual clichéd melodrama, and instead of a Big Misunderstanding the ruptures in the couple's bliss come from their mutual sense of latent embarrassment at being so different from the other. Both leads are stellar, playing up their characters' clashing personalities that slowly drive them apart while also finding the common emotional ground that made their pairing possible in the first place.\n\n69/100\n\n[originally written as part of my first report from TIFF '14 for The Dissolve; I'd just trashed Men, Women & Children in the previous paragraph.]\n\nOn the surface, Lucas Belvaux’s Not My Type (pompous alternate title: Men & Women) appears equally unpersuasive, with a high-concept premise that could easily serve as the basis for a truly dire rom-com. He’s a philosophy professor who quotes Kant in casual conversation and doesn’t even own a TV set! She’s a hairdresser who’s obsessed with Jennifer Aniston’s love life and spends her weekends performing at karaoke bars! How will this relationship ever work?!? Rather than mine such a goofy scenario for comedy, however, Belvaux (Rapt) takes it seriously, allowing both lovers to emerge as complex…\n\nEu amo esses filmes que estudam um relacionamento entre pessoas de mundos diferentes e concretizam o tom trágico muito mais pelo que não vemos do que pelo que vemos. A ausência de interesse do Clément na Jennifer para alem do sexo, a ausência de cenas dele conversando ou interagindo com o Dylan, as muitas perguntas sobre ela que ele não faz…\n\nÉ o manual do babaca da cidade grande que se acha muito acima dos \"roceiros\". O cara que só quer falar com quem \"está abaixo\" se for uma relação de consumo (Clément não fala suas visões para Jennifer ou para os colegas, mas escreve livro sobre elas). O ápice disso é a cena de sexo, em que a câmera se fecha nos rostos buscando alguma intimidade, mas a cadência da montagem (todos os planos ali têm a mesma duração) tá sempre revelando que no lugar da intimidade há apenas incomunicabilidade.\n\nBelatedly noting that I wrote on this film in Cinema Scope 86, as part of an article titled: \"Not My Type: Stanley Cavell and the Invention of Genre.\" The piece, which draws from Pursuits of Happiness and Contesting Tears, is print only, but feel free to reach out if you're interested and have no access."
