CRML issued 8.4 million shares to Rimbal Pty Ltd to secure the equity interest, bringing the company's shareholding in the Tanbreez project to 42%. This means the mining development company has completed stage one of its longer-term plan to secure a 92.5% controlling interest in Tanbreez, with European Lithium to retain its 7.5% ownership in the project. CEO and chair Tony Sage said: “The successful completion of Stage 1 reflects another pivotal milestone in our strategic acquisition of Tanbreez.\" More at #Proactive #ProactiveInvestors #ASX #EUR #REE #RareEarths #Mining #CriticalMinerals http://ow.ly/5klo105BVpK\n\nA small exploratory program of aircore drilling by Carnavale Resources Ltd (ASX:CAV) has provided encouraging signs for #gold mineralisation at Ghan Dam Prospect in the southwestern area of the Ora Banda South Project northwest of Kalgoorlie in WA. There were 14 aircore holes completed at Ghan Dam for 800 metres in the program, which was targeting strike extensions to previous anomalies outlined in previous aircore drilling in the regolith. All holes reached the target depth and were completed in fresh rock with anomalous gold and pathfinder results mainly received from the top of fresh rock interface.

Earlier this month the company announced the completion of a positive feasibility study (FS) for the project in a region renowned for its large-tonnage mineral deposits. The feasibility study indicates strong economic prospects for the project, focusing on a concentrate-only model, which promises a long-life production profile with first quartile operating costs. The Jaguar Project is a key asset for Centaurus, supporting the company's goal to develop a diversified #CriticalMinerals business in Brazil with strong environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials.

The company has started geological mapping and sampling with an experienced field team that possesses extensive geophysical data sets. L1M is confident in the lithium potential of these projects, having identified multiple pegmatites and regional trends within the Salinas Formation, which contains several lithium resources. Early-stage exploration will help identify drill targets and enhance the company's knowledge of the region. Biggs highlighted the positive outcomes of an initial site visit in June, noting the identification of pegmatites and areas of interest.

The results indicate significant #gold and #copper mineralisation, with one hole intersecting 6 metres at 0.80 g/t gold and 0.15% copper from 12 metres. The findings suggest potential for a Boda-style porphyry system at Lady Ilse, nearly doubling the near-surface gold and copper anomaly to more than 1,200 metres in length, with the trend open to the north. The technical team is modelling the new data to develop a follow-up program and evaluate further drill sites. The aircore program, completed with 64 holes totalling 598 metres, was conducted to test basement geochemistry through shallow cover.

Notices were also sent to Discord, Snap Inc., Skype, and WhatsApp under the Online Safety Act, requiring all recipients to explain how they are tackling child abuse material, live-streamed abuse, online grooming, sexual extortion and where applicable the production of 'synthetic' or deepfaked child abuse material created using generative #AI. Tech companies will be required to report twice a year for the next two years, with the eSafety Commission publishing summaries of the findings.

The retained licence contains the project camp and infrastructure, which will be used in minor environmental remediation of work areas including feasibility study test ponds, trenches and site access tracks. This divestment will free up RWD’s attention, capital and energy to focus on commercialising its ESG-friendly potash processing technology (PPT) and advancing the Carnarvon Project as a very low-cost sulphate of potash (SOP) asset.
