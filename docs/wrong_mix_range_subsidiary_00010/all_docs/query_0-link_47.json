        "text": "Summary :\n\nATTORNEY FEE PETITION; DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS\n\nIn Evans v. Miami Valley Hospital , ARB Nos. 08-039, 08-043, ALJ No. 2006-AIR-22 (ARB Aug. 31, 2009), the ARB summarized the documentation requirements for petition for attorney's fees and costs in an AIR21 case:\n\nA successful AIR 21 complainant is entitled to receive all costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, reasonably incurred in bringing the complaint. A prevailing party is entitled to reimbursement for attorney's fees and legal expenses and costs, including expert witness fees.\n\nThe ARB has endorsed the lodestar method to calculate attorney's fees. This requires multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended in bringing the litigation by a reasonable hourly rate. As the Supreme Court explained in Hensley v. Eckerhart , unreasonably expended hours include those that are (1) excessive in relationship to the task performed, (2) redundant or duplicative because multiple attorneys performed the same task, or (3) unnecessary or inappropriate because the task is not properly billed to clients.\n\nAn attorney seeking a fee award must submit evidence documenting the hours worked and the rates claimed, as well as records identifying the date, time, and duration necessary to accomplish each specific activity and all claimed costs. The burden of proof is also on the attorney to demonstrate the reasonableness of his hourly fee by producing evidence that the requested rate is in line with fees prevailing in the community for similar services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skill, experience, and reputation. If the documentation of hours is inadequate, the award may be reduced accordingly. Further, hours that are not properly billed to a client are also not properly billed to an adversary.\n\nUSDOL/OALJ Reporter at 2-4 (footnotes omitted).\n\nATTORNEY FEE PETITION; ALJ'S DISCRETION IN SETTING HOURLY RATES\n\nIn Evans v. Miami Valley Hospital , ARB Nos. 08-039, 08-043, ALJ No. 2006-AIR-22 (ARB Aug. 31, 2009), the ARB found that the ALJ acted within his discretion in awarding an hourly rate to the Complainant's attorney at the higher end of the spectrum suggested by an expert for one of the Respondents. Although the Respondents objected to the setting of the rates at the high end of the spectrum, the ARB noted that the ALJ had thoroughly discussed the hourly rates of the two principal attorneys and their associates, and the arguments of the Respondents; that he relied on the affidavits of two other attorneys who practiced in the relevant legal community; that the Respondent had suggested no alternative rates; that the aforementioned expert of the Respondent had provided evidentiary support for the hourly rates the ALJ set; and that the ALJ actually presided at the hearing and had the opportunity to evaluate the ability and expertise of the attorneys.\n\nATTORNEY FEE PETITION; RATE FOR ATTORNEY WHO HAD GRADUATED BUT HAD NOT YET BEEN LICENSED\n\nIn Evans v. Miami Valley Hospital , ARB Nos. 08-039, 08-043, ALJ No. 2006-AIR-22 (ARB Aug. 31, 2009), a Respondent argued for a reduction in the fee rate assigned to an attorney who had graduated, but who was not yet licensed. The Respondent argued that the rate should be the local rate for law school clerks. The ARB, however, found that the evidence supported the ALJ's findings with regard to local prevailing rates and his selection of an hourly rate was within his discretion.\n\nATTORNEY FEE PETITION; BLOCK BILLING AND TIME-AND-TASK ENTRIES; SUFFICIENT DETAIL\n\nIn Evans v. Miami Valley Hospital , ARB Nos. 08-039, 08-043, ALJ No. 2006-AIR-22 (ARB Aug. 31, 2009), the ARB faulted the ALJ for not elaborating sufficiently on why he found the Complainants' attorneys' time-and-task entries to be sufficiently detailed and to represent time reasonably expended in furtherance of Complainant's case. Specifically, the ARB found that the ALJ's decision was deficient because he failed to make specific findings of fact regarding the reasonableness of the block-billed, time-and-task entries for services. The ARB therefore examined the records itself. In regard to block billing and charges for conferencing, the ARB wrote:\n\nBlock billing is a time-keeping method by which a lawyer enters \"the total daily time spent working on a case, rather than itemizing the time expended on specific tasks.\" Such billing can make it difficult to determine the reasonableness of the hours expended, but the use of block billing does not justify an across-the-board reduction or rejection of all hours. Rather, a fixed reduction can be appropriate if a significant number of entries lack adequate detail or are not properly billable to clients.\n\nWhile block billing does not necessarily deprive a court of a basis upon which to determine the reasonableness of the hours an attorney expended on specific tasks, such bundled or batch billing does impede a court's ability to discern the time spent on tasks that are properly billable and discount the time spent on those that are vaguely described, duplicative, or not compensable at all. For example, entries that describe the service rendered as \"office conference\" may involve duplication of attorney work or training time and, without justifying detail, are not normally billable to private clients. Also, an unusually large amount of time billed as telephone conferences or internal meetings is not recoverable. In Welch , the Sixth Circuit affirmed the district court's reduction of 5.75 hours spent in intra-office conferences as unnecessary given counsel's experience and the petition's lack of justification for such conferences.\n\nFinally, while the mere fact of attorneys conferring with each other does not necessarily constitute duplication of services, the number of hours requested may be reduced when two or more attorneys work on a case because their involvement necessarily tends to generate a certain amount of overlap. For example, a local rule for the Maryland district court provides that only one lawyer is to be compensated for intra-office conferences except those that are reasonably necessary for proper management of the litigation. Thus, a party may only recover time that a single, participating attorney spent at intra-office conferences, client and third-party meetings, and in hearings.\n\n* * *\n\n[A]s we have said, the attorney seeking fees bears the burden of proof to show that the claimed hours of compensation are adequately demonstrated and reasonably expended. Where the billing descriptions do not provide sufficient documentation to determine the reasonableness of the hours claimed, a reviewing body need not engage in an item-by-item reduction of the hours, but may instead reduce the lodestar fee by a set percentage. ...\n\nUSDOL/OALJ Reporter at 8-10 (footnotes omitted). In the instant case, the ARB found that most time entries were, in context, sufficiently specific, but found enough lack of detail or apparent duplication between the two attorneys, to merit an across-the-board reduction of five percent for one of the attorneys, and fifteen percent for the other.\n\nATTORNEY FEE PETITION; EVIDENTIARY HEARING ON USUAL HOURLY RATE IS NOT MANDATED BECAUSE DOL USES LODESTAR METHOD\n\nIn Evans v. Miami Valley Hospital , ARB Nos. 08-039, 08-043, ALJ No. 2006-AIR-22 (ARB Aug. 31, 2009), the Respondents argued that the ALJ erred when he denied their requests for an evidentiary hearing to determine the customary billing rates of the Complainant's attorneys, arguing that a hearing is mandated when the facts regarding a fee petition and an hourly rate are disputed. The ARB rejected this argument, writing: \"While an attorney's usual hourly rate can constitute evidence of the prevailing market rate, we have held that the prevailing market rate, as established by the attorney seeking a fee, is the key factor in determining a reasonable billing rate under the lodestar method, not the attorney's usual hourly rate or his fee arrangement with other clients.\" USDOL/OALJ Reporter at 15 (footnotes omitted).\n\nSummary :\n\nCOVERED EMPLOYER; NON-PUBLICLY TRADED SUBSIDIARY, LIABILITY BASED ON AGENCY RELATIONSHIP IN REGARD TO FIRING OF COMPLAINANT\n\nIn Klopfenstein v. PPC Flow Technologies Holdings, Inc. , ARB Nos. 07-021, 07-022, ALJ No. 2004-SOX-11 (ARB Aug. 31, 2009), the ARB affirmed the ALJ's holding that the non-publicly traded subsidiary of a publicly traded parent company had acted as the parent's agent for the purpose of discharging the Complainant, and therefore was properly named as a Respondent in the Complainant's SOX complaint. The Complainant was vice president of a division of a subsidiary of the aforementioned subsidiary. A revenue recognition policy, on which basis the Complainant was discharged, was a policy of the parent company; an employee in the parent's finance department had learned of the violation; the official who fired the Complainant was both president of the subsidiary and executive vice president of the parent; that official conferred with other senior managers from both the subsidiary and the parent following an investigation of and report on the violation of the policy. However, the vice president of finance for the subsidiary at which the Complainant was employed was not an agent and was not proper Respondent under SOX. He had investigated the issue and prepared a report, but was not a decision maker in the termination of the Complainant's employment.\n\nCONTRIBUTING CAUSE NOT SHOWN\n\nIn Klopfenstein v. PPC Flow Technologies Holdings, Inc. , ARB Nos. 07-021, 07-022, ALJ No. 2004-SOX-11 (ARB Aug. 31, 2009), the ARB affirmed the ALJ's holding that the Complainant failed to prove that his complaints about an overstatement of revenue were a contributing factor in the decision to discharge the Complainant. The evidentiary value of the temporal proximity of the alleged protected activity (neither the ALJ or the ARB reached the issue of whether the Complainant had actually engaged in protected activity under SOX) was defeated in part by the intervening event that the Complainant had been found to have violated a company policy on revenue recognition. Although other employees were not disciplined over the revenue recognition issue, the ALJ had accepted the testimony of officials making a distinction between the Complainant - who had directed and fostered an atmosphere that allowed a violation of the policy - and others who did not understand the implications of the actions (which involved shipping items off premises so that revenue would be recognized before title and risk of loss had passed to the customer). The ALJ relied on testimony of the Complainant's subordinates that he directed them to move inventory and post close-outs to find that the Complainant had not established pretext. The ARB found no evidence to support the Complainant's contention that the Respondent had provided shifting explanations for the discharge.\n\nSummary :\n\nDEFAULT JUDGMENT BASED ON FAILURE TO FILE TIMELY PRE-HEARING STATEMENT\n\nIn Sisfontes v. International Business Software Solutions, Inc. , ARB Nos. 07-107, 07-114, ALJ No. 2007-LCA-14 (ARB Aug. 31, 2009), the ARB found that the ALJ did not abuse his discretion in finding that the Respondents had not shown good cause for the late filing of a pre-hearing statement.\n\nINA \"WHISTLEBLOWER\" PROVISION DOES NOT EMPOWER ADMINISTRATOR TO IMMUNIZE A COMPLAINANT FROM A LAWSUIT BY THE RESPONDENTS\n\nIn Sisfontes v. International Business Software Solutions, Inc. , ARB Nos. 07-107, 07-114, ALJ No. 2007-LCA-14 (ARB Aug. 31, 2009), the ALJ entered a default judgment against the Respondents, and ordered them to pay the Complainant back wages and reimbursement for the filing fees associated with processing the LCA. On appeal the Complainant argued that the ALJ should have granted him immunity grounded in whistleblower protection under the Immigration and Nationality Act and a state employee protection law because the default decision left open the possibility that the Respondents would sue him for disclosing information about illegal activity and for cooperating with the Wage and Hour investigator. The ARB rejected this argument because (1) it had no jurisdiction in regard to the state law, (2) the Wage and Hour Administrator had not made a finding on an INA whistleblower claim, (3) the Complainant did not ask for imposition of civil money penalties or reinstatement under the INA, and (4) the clause of the INA whistleblower law giving the Administrator discretion to impose \"such other administrative remedies as the Administrator determines to be appropriate\" does not permit the Administrator to order immunity from a lawsuit. Thus, the ALJ did not err in limiting remedies to back pay and a refund of the filing fee."
