        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThanks for choosing Beeline!\n\nBeeline Loans, Inc. (âweâ or âusâ) is committed to protecting and respecting your personal information and privacy when you're visiting our website, portal or any other tools found on our site or mobile applications. We want our services to be safe and enjoyable environments for you.\n\nWe want to transparently explain how and why we gather, store, share and use your personal information and outline the controls and choices you have around when and how you choose to share this information.\n\nThis Privacy and Security Notice (the âPrivacy Policyâ) relates to our use of any personal information you give us through our website, portal or any other tools found on our site or mobile applications. To make sure you enjoy our full range of services, we need to collect information about you.\n\nWe want you to feel comfortable and confident when using our website. Here's how we do that:\n\nWe provide you notice of our website information practices.\n\nWe tell you how and why we use web technologies.\n\nWe outline how the personally identifiable information that you give us may be used.\n\nWe give you the ability to update or correct your personally identifiable information.\n\nWe outline the ways we protect your information.\n\nWe'll also offer you ways to contact us about our information practices and other aspects of privacy.\n\nWe're ridiculously committed to safeguarding your personal information. So, whenever you provide such information, we'll only ever use it in line with the laws concerning the protection of personal information (these laws are referred to collectively in this Privacy Policy as the \"data protection laws\"). We've worked hard on this Privacy Policy to make sure it's clear, transparent and at the leading-edge of privacy guidelines in our industry.\n\nYOUR SECURITY AND PRIVACY\n\nBy using our website, you are consenting to the use of information and agreeing to these guidelines and the other Beeline policies described on our website.\n\nBecause we're in the business of finance, our websites aren't for anyone under 18. So, we don't knowingly attempt to solicit or receive any information from children.\n\nWe don't make our advertising decisions based on political affiliations or in support of, or against, any political or religious group. We firmly believe in the right of free speech, however, we also believe we have an obligation to ensure our advertising does not appear in content that is detrimental to our brand values. We won't advertise within programs that consistently exploit excessive or gratuitous violence or sexuality, which demean or denigrate any religion, race, sex or which are otherwise lacking in good taste.\n\nShould our advertising appear within programming content that violates these guidelines we'll review the content in question and make decisions about the appropriateness of that program for future consideration.\n\nWE PROVIDE YOU NOTICE OF OUR WEBSITE INFORMATION PRACTICES.\n\nTo maximize the value of our services, we may request information from you when you visit our website. We won't share your personal information with outside companies for their promotional use, however we do use third party services who may access your information for the purpose of processing your application or loan (think an appraiser, or title company).\n\nWhen you apply for a home loan, credit reporting agencies may share your information with other companies. As a result, you may get unwanted calls about finance products. To stop these calls and emails, call (888) 567-8688 or visitÂ www.optoutprescreen.com.\n\nHere's a description of the information we collect and how it's used/disclosed:\n\nTools, applications and registration: We provide a number of ways for you to explore your options for mortgages and loans, so you can determine which options may be the most desirable for you. You can engage a number of tools, planners, calculators and other interactive advisors, without providing us your identity.\n\nWe may also supply the information you provide, on a strictly confidential basis, to service providers, such as title companies, appraisers, credit reporting services, etc. who assist us in qualifying, processing, closing and servicing your loan.\n\nCredit report: By submitting a loan application or a request to be pre-qualified by us, you authorize us to share your credit report with our affiliates.\n\nElectronic communication: We provide you the opportunity to subscribe to email communications. You can unsubscribe by following the instructions provided in each communication.\n\nMandatory and optional information: We identify what information is required to fulfill your request. If you choose not to provide us with this information, we will not be able to provide you the service you are requesting. As part of your use of our website, we may collect information that may include your name, address, social security number, the location and value of the property related to the requested loan products or services, financial information about your assets and income, financial accounts, insurance and other information. As part of this process, you consent to Beeline obtaining a credit report and for us to use this information as described in this policy. Within Beeline's online application and process, you may consent to one or more of the following - a soft credit inquiry and/or hard credit inquiry. A hard credit inquiry is required by Beeline for the extension of any credit to you. We will also collect information about your activity on the Beeline website and use that information as described in this policy.\n\nWithin the Beeline family: Within the Beeline family, which includes, but is not limited to, our title company affiliates, we may exchange customer information to fulfill your request(s) or to provide you with information about other products or services, if you have chosen to receive such communications.\n\nService providers: We employ or use service providers such as title companies, appraisers, consultants, and temporary workers, third party software developers, etc. to complete a business process or provide a service on our behalf. For example, we may use service providers to enhance our website technology, deliver products, or to send emails. When we employ service providers, we may need to share your personally identifiable information. Service providers are strictly prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for purposes other than to act on our behalf. Realtors are not considered our service providers. If you have a realtor, we will update them with certain milestones of your transaction, but we will not share your sensitive information with them without your consent. If you do not have a realtor, we may ask you if you want us to refer someone to you. Unless you have given us permission to do so, your information will not be given to any realtor with whom you do not have an existing relationship.\n\nData providers: We use a number of third party data providers. These providers allow us to provide you with a better experience by bypassing the old-fashioned document gathering - and they are listed here: Amazon Web Services, Beeline Title Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries, Black Knight Data Analytics, LLC, ComplianceEase/SitusAMC, Docutech, Equifax/TWN, Estated, First American, FNMA, Freddie Mac, Google, LenderPrice, LexisNexis, Lodestar, MERSCORP Holdings, Inc., Mortgage Electronic Registration System, Inc., Ncontracts/QuestSoft, Nimble Title Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries, LLC, Plaid, Inc., Qualia, Relcu, ServiceLink, Stellar Innovative Solutions Corp., ValueLink, Unum ID Inc.

In the event you are directed to or use a third party company's website, these third party websites have their own privacy policies, including cookies, and we urge you to review them.

You will have the opportunity to opt out of further secondary use of your information following any change of control.\n\nChanges to our privacy policy: If we plan to make significant changes to any of our privacy policies or practices with respect to how we use personally identifiable information, we'll post those changes to the Beeline website. Your continued use of the website, portal or mobile application after the updates are posted represents your consent to the terms of the new Privacy Policy. In countries outside of the United States, we will also take other steps as required by law, such as obtaining your consent or providing you with the opportunity to delete your personal information.\n\nLegal disclosures: In some cases we may disclose certain information to comply with a legal process such as a court order, subpoena, search warrant, or law enforcement request.\n\nHosting: Our website, portal and mobile applications are hosted by a third party service provider on servers located in the United States. If you are in a non-US jurisdiction, you may be sending your personal information to the United States, which may or may not have laws that provide an equivalent level of data protection to the laws of your home country.\n\nWE TELL YOU HOW AND WHY WE USE WEB TECHNOLOGIES.\n\nHere is how and why we use some common web technologies to help manage our websites:\n\nCookies: A \"cookie\" is a small piece of information that our website may provide to your browser while you are at our sites. We may use web-based tools, like cookies to see which areas of our site users prefer (e.g., based on the number of visits to those areas) which will help us better market to individual consumers. This is done through a tracking utility that allows us to reconstruct activity from a session or by a user, for troubleshooting and issue resolution purposes. Beeline may also employ service providers to help us collect and understand our website usage data. These service providers may also use cookies.We do not process information through cookies to identify a particular individual. Cookies are stored on your device and you have full access and control over their use. You may deactivate or restrict the transmission of cookies by changing the settings of your web browser. Cookies that are already stored may be deleted at any time. If you visit our website with cookies deactivated, you may not be able to use all the functions of our site fully. When periodic surveys are presented to website visitors, cookies are used to prevent issuing multiple invitations to the same individual.\n\nIf you are a registered member on the Beeline website, you will receive a cookie when you log in. This cookie is maintained by your browser and contains your identifier. This cookie is also used to authenticate your identity and provide you with access to areas of our website that are limited to registered members, such as those that allow you to view and manage your personal profile.\n\nAdditionally, Beeline service providers that serve ads on affiliate and/or advertiser websites may assign different cookies and small graphical images called single-pixel GIFs or web beacons, to your browser to track the effectiveness of our advertising on other websites and your involvement with Beeline. We may also employ service providers who may assign cookies or web beacons to your browser to assist us in collecting website usage data such as your IP address, session ID, URL and demographic information such as your zip code. The collection of data may include personally identifiable information. We do not track URLs that you type into your browser, nor do we track you across the internet once you leave our site.\n\nYour web browser may be set to accept cookies automatically, but can be changed to decline them. If you wish to remove cookies provided by Beeline, please check your browser's settings and its Help section for instructions for removing cookies from your browser. If you decline to accept cookies, then you may be required to re-register each time you download or request materials from the website.\n\nWe may use internal or third party advertising companies to collect non-personally identifiable information for online behavioral advertising to provide targeted display advertisements, through participating publishers and advertisers, that are likely to be of greater interest to you. Such information may include non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) through the use of cookies and other technology.\n\nWebsite usage data: Our website tracks usage data, including, for example, your IP address, your browser type and version, which pages you view, which page, if any, linked you to our site, and which link, if any, you follow off of our site. We use this data in the aggregate and on an individual level to better understand website activity to improve our site offerings, to reconstruct activity from a session or by a user, for troubleshooting and issue resolution purposes. We may also use this data to provide you a more personalized website experience, assistance with technical support questions, to send you special offers, product and service updates, or other promotional materials that are relevant and tailored to your interests. If you do not want to receive these offers or promotions, simply indicate your contact preferences during the registration process, within any future communications to us or by sending an email toÂ [email protected].

Your activity on third party websites is governed by the security and privacy policies of each third party website. Users of third party websites often share information with the general public, user community, and/or the third party vendors operating these websites, which may use this information in a variety of ways. Consequently, you should review the privacy policies of the third party website before using it and ensure that you understand how this information may be used. You may be able to adjust privacy settings on your accounts on any third party website or application to match your preferences. The information posted on or directed at us through social media is generally available to the public. To protect your privacy, do not include information you want to keep private or any other sensitive personal information in your social media activity, comments or responses. This information may be archived independently on, and retention of such information is governed by the third party website. Additionally, we may use third party marketing platforms and other data analytics tools to analyze your preferences and certain transaction details. In order to maximize these capabilities, we may store some data about you on those platforms.\n\nUSE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nWe give you the opportunity to control the use of your personal information for purposes outside of completing and servicing your loan. For example, occasionally, we may use your contact information to send you promotional communications about Beeline products, including those of our affiliates.

We train our employees in security procedures and we conduct audits to verify compliance with these procedures.\n\nAdditionally, we use industry-recognized security safeguards to protect your information from loss, misuse or unauthorization alteration. We use SSL transaction protocol for all email communication as well as strong encryption products, and use AWS hosting services.\n\nWAYS TO CONTACT US ABOUT SECURITY AND PRIVACY."
