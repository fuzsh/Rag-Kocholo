        "text": "American passenger transport aircraft of the World War II era\n\nModel 18 Lodestar\n\nC-56 / C-57 / C-60 / R5O Lockheed Lodestar flying skydivers at Goderich, 1977 Role Passenger transport\n\nType of aircraft\n\nNational origin United States Manufacturer Lockheed First flight September 21, 1939 Introduction March 30, 1940 Primary user United States Army Air Corps Number built 625 Developed from Lockheed Model 14 Super Electra Variants Lockheed Ventura\n\nThe Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar is a passenger transport aircraft of the World War II era, developed as part of the Model 10 Electra family; developed from the Lockheed Model 14 Super Electra.\n\nSales of the 10–14 passenger Lockheed Model 14 Super Electra, which first flew in 1937, had proved disappointing, despite the aircraft's excellent performance, as it was more expensive to operate than the larger Douglas DC-3, already in widespread use. In order to improve the type's economics, Lockheed decided to stretch the aircraft's fuselage by 5 feet 6 inches (1.68 m), allowing an extra two rows of seats to be fitted.\n\nThe prototype for the revised airliner, designated Model 18 by Lockheed, was converted from the fourth Model 14, one of a batch which had been returned to the manufacturer by Northwest Airlines after a series of crashes. The modified aircraft first flew in this form on September 21, 1939, another two prototypes being converted from Model 14s, with the first newly built Model 18 flying on February 2, 1940.\n\nA total of 625 Lodestars of all variants were built.\n\nThe Lodestar received its Type certificate on March 30, 1940, allowing it to enter service with the first customer, Mid-Continent Airlines that month. As hoped, the extra seats greatly improved the Model 18's economics, reducing its seat-mile costs to a similar level to that of the DC-3, while retaining superior performance. Despite this, sales to US domestic customers were relatively slow as most US airlines were already committed to the DC-3, with only 31 Lodestars going to US airlines. Overseas sales were a little better, with the biggest airline customers being South African Airways (21), New Zealand National Airways Corporation (13), Trans-Canada Air Lines (12) and BOAC (9); another 29 were bought by the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army Air Force. Various Pratt & Whitney and Wright Cyclone powerplants were installed.\n\nWhen the United States started to build up its military air strength in 1940–41, many American-operated Lodestars were impressed as the C-56. This was followed by the construction of many new-build Lodestars which were flown by the U.S. Army Air Forces as the C-60 and by the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps as the R5O. Lend-lease aircraft were used by the RNZAF as transports.\n\nOne was purchased in 1942 to serve as Brazilian President Getúlio Vargas' personal aircraft. This aircraft was specially designed for that purpose and had 11 seats.\n\nAfter the war many Lodestars were overhauled and returned to civilian service, mostly as executive transports such as Dallas Aero Service's DAS Dalaero conversion, Bill Lear's Learstar (produced by PacAero), and Howard Aero's Howard 250.[7][8] A few of the latter were converted to tricycle landing gear.\n\nWhile the surviving New Zealand NZNAC aircraft were sold back overseas in 1951/52, six more were later imported and converted for aerial topdressing.\n\nA single Lodestar served with the Israeli Air Force during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.\n\nA number of skydiving operations in the United States used Lodestars during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n18-07\n\nPowered by two 875 hp Pratt & Whitney Hornet S1E2-G engines; 25 built plus two prototypes.\n\n18-08\n\nPowered by two 1,200 hp Pratt & Whitney Twin Wasp S1C3-G engines; 33 built.\n\n18-10\n\nPowered by two 1,200 hp Pratt & Whitney Twin Wasp S1C3-G engines; 39 built.\n\n18-14\n\nPowered by two 1,200 hp Pratt & Whitney Twin Wasp S4C4-G engines; four built.\n\n18-40\n\nPowered by two 1,200 hp Wright Cyclone G-1820-G104A engines; 26 built.\n\n18-50\n\nPowered by two 1,200hp Wright Cyclone G-1820-G202A engines; 13 built.\n\n18-56\n\nPowered by two 1,200hp Wright Cyclone GR-1820-G205A, R-1820-40 or R-1820-87 engines.[12]\n\nC-56\n\nPowered by 1,200 hp Wright 1820-89 engines, one Model 18-50 for evaluation.[13]\n\nC-56A\n\nOne impressed Model 18-07 with two Pratt & Whitney R-1690-54 engines.[13]\n\nC-56B\n\nThirteen impressed Model 18-40s with two Wright 1820-97 engines.[13]\n\nC-56C\n\nTwelve impressed Model 18-07.[13]\n\nC-56D\n\nSeven impressed Model 18-08.[13]\n\nC-56E\n\nTwo Model 18-40s impressed in 1943.[13]\n\nC-57\n\nAs Model 18-14 powered by two 1,200 hp Pratt & Whitney R-1830-53 engines.[13]\n\nC-57A\n\nAllocated for impressed aircraft, not used.[13]\n\nC-57B\n\nBased on Model 18-08 fitted for trooping; seven aircraft built.[13]\n\nC-57C\n\nRepowered C-60A with Pratt & Whitney R-1830-51 engines; three aircraft converted.[13]\n\nC-57D\n\nRepowered C-57C with Pratt & Whitney R-1830-92 engines; one aircraft converted.[13]\n\nC-59\n\nBased on Model 18-07 powered by Pratt & Whitney R-1690-25 Hornet engines; 10 aircraft built, transferred to Royal Air Force as Lodestar IA.\n\nC-60\n\nModel 18-56 powered by Wright R-1820-87 engines; 36 aircraft built, some transferred to RAF as Lodestar II.\n\nC-60A\n\nAs the C-60 but fitted out as a paratroop transport powered by Pratt & Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp engines; 325 aircraft built.[13]\n\nXC-60B\n\nOne C-60A fitted with experimental de-icing equipment.[13]\n\nC-60C\n\nProposed 21-seat troop transport aircraft, never built.\n\nC-66\n\nPowered by Wright R-1820-87 engines; one aircraft built, 11-passenger interior for transfer to the Brazilian Air Force.[13]\n\nC-104\n\nOriginal designation for C-60C\n\nXR5O-1\n\nOne Model 18-07 acquired for evaluation powered by 1,200 hp (895 kW) Wright R-1820-40 engines.[13]\n\nR5O-1\n\nStaff transport powered by 1,200 hp (895 kW) Wright R-1820-97 engines; three aircraft built, two for the USN and one for the United States Coast Guard.\n\nR5O-2\n\nNavy version of the C-59 powered by 850 hp (634 kW) Pratt & Whitney R-1690-25 engines; one aircraft built.\n\nR5O-3\n\nPowered by 1,200 hp (895 kW) Pratt & Whitney R-1830-34A engines.

At least 12 crew members and passengers died in the crash.[27] A cause of the accident was not determined. Among those killed were Air Vice-Marshal Wilfred Ashton McClaughry, CB, DSO, MC, DFC and Lady Rosalinde Tedder née MacLardy, wife of Marshal of the Royal Air Force Arthur William Tedder, 1st Baron Tedder, GCB.[27]\n\nIn 1949, a Lockheed Lodestar in airline service in Australia crashed immediately after takeoff. All 21 occupants died in the crash or the ensuing conflagration. The cause of the accident was determined to be that the center of gravity was behind the rear limit. It is also likely the elevator trim tab was set for landing rather than takeoff.[28]\n\nOn December 20, 1956, Alden G. Roach, president of the Consolidated Western Steel and the Columbia-Geneva-Steel Divisions of U.S. Steel, pilot and co-pilot crash near Tyrone, Pennsylvania, Model 18-56, N 1245V, U.S. Steel owned company plane. Causes unknown.[29]\n\nOn March 22, 1958, Mike Todd's private plane Lucky Liz, named after his wife Elizabeth Taylor, crashed near Grants, New Mexico. The plane, a twin-engine Lockheed Lodestar, suffered engine failure while being flown overloaded, in icing conditions at too-high an altitude for the loading. The plane went out of control and crashed, killing all four on board.[citation needed]\n\nOn September 4, 1962, a Lockheed 18-56-24 Lodestar operated by the Ashland Oil and Refining Company crashed near Lake Milton, Ohio. The flight was in-route to Ashland Regional Airport (KDWU) from Buffalo Airport, NY. Eleven passengers and two crew-members were killed. Investigation determined the crash a result of a malfunction of the electric elevator trim tab, which caused the loss of the plane's right wing during flight.[30]\n\nOn August 21, 1983, a Lockheed L-18 LEARStar operated by Landry Aviation, Inc. crashed near Silvana, Washington. The flight was a planned parachute drop carrying two pilots and 22 parachutists. Nine parachutists and two crew-members were killed while 13 were able to parachute to safety after the pilots lost control and entered a vertical descent from 12,500 feet. Investigation determined the crash a result of a failure of the operator and pilot-in-command to assure proper load distribution during the parachute drop.[31]\n\nFAB 2006 – C-60A on static display at the Museu Aeroespacial in Rio de Janeiro.[32][33]\n\nc/n 18-2064 – L18-08 under restoration by students at the Aerospace Centre of the University of the Fraser Valley for static display at the Canadian Museum of Flight.
