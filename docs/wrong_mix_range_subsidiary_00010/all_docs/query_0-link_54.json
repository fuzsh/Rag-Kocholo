        "text": "Last updated 26 February 2023\n\nUS FIRE BOMBER OPERATORS : Part 1: A\n\nA historical survey of US heavy air tanker companies to the year 2000, compiled by Geoff Goodall\n\nAero Union Corp Lockheed Neptune N716AU tanker #16 makes a retardant drop on a wildfire in the Angeles National Forest\n\nnear Wrightwood California in September 2002. Photo by Leo Jarzomb, staff photographer San Gabriel Valley News Group\n\nThis series attempts to list all US fire bomber/air tanker operators and their aircraft fleets. Information on some operators has been minimal, especially the smaller outfits based on partnerships between pilots or family-run operations. I have added to the bare listings from conversations with career tanker men in US, also air crew deployed to Australia for our summer bushfire seasons.\n\nCommercial aerial fire bombing began during the 1950s. By the 1990s the US Forest Service, primary contractor for the US air tanker fleet, began implementing a series of policy changes which resulted in many older piston-engined aircraft types being excluded from USFS air tanker contracts, with priority given to turbines (P-3s and C-130As). Long established operators lost their annual summer USFS contracts and were forced to shut down.\n\nThe 1990s also brought the lomg-running investigation into the USFS Air Tanker Scandal in which USAF surplus C-130As issued to civilian tanker operators under a USFS scheme to modernise the fleet were instead used for military support logistics contracts in Saudi Arabia during the Gulf Wars. Media investigation revealed that C-130As delivered to tanker companies specifically to be modified as fire bombers had in fact being on-sold or used for other purposes. The scandal dragged on for a decade, resulting in a USFS officer and tanker identity being convicted of fraud and jailed. The investigation also took a disapproving look at the established practice of trading retired fire bombers to the USAF and US Navy museums in exchange for retired military aircraft, which provided newer aircraft to be tanked or for commercial resale.\n\nEnd of an era\n\nFox Field air tanker attack base at Lancaster California during the 2003 summer, the final season of the glory days of mixed aircraft fleets.\n\nPhoto taken from the USFS tanker base tower by Dave Kelly Jnr.\n\nDuring 2002 two tragic structural failure accidents during retardant drops resulted in C-130As and PB4Y Privateers being grounded, which spelt the end for Hawkins & Powers Aviation of Wyoming after 45 years in the tanker business. Mandatory inspections then found structural cracks in the mainplanes of tanker Neptunes which were also grounded until an FAA-approved repair plan was completed. These events accelerated growing antipathy on ecology grounds within some sections of the USFS heirachy against oil-dripping piston-engined tankers. Now \"public safety\" could be quoted as the reason for dropping contracts to long-established operators, sometimes with no consultation. The FAA joined in with increased \"old airplane\" surveillance requirements. Established tanker companies with high operational standards which enjoyed the full confidence of the USFS at operational levels suffered cancellation of annual contracts worth up to $5M. USFS saw \"clean\" and modern jet airliner tankers as the answer, but the finance required for that step resulted in only a handul of corporate-financed operators surviving.\n\nVeteran tanker pilot Larry Kraus wrote in 2022:\n\n\"The 2003 season was the Last Hurrah because for reasons that were claimed to be for “public safety” all of the Federal Tanker Contracts were cancelled in June of the following year. This was a few days before I was to report for duty at Moses Lake with Douglas DC-7 Tanker 62. Overnight, we tanker pilots went from being considered more or less heroes to reckless maniacs as far as the official press releases went because we had a “Can Do Attitude”, which apparently made us unsafe. The aircraft couldn’t be used as tankers unless the operators could provide a manufacturer’s airframe life limit. The only one that initially qualified was the P-3, although the paperwork was really for a P-3C rather than the P-3A. The rest of us were out of luck\n\nI’d better not say any more. That was 18 years ago but the wounds are still fresh.\"\n\nThe face and feel of the original US air tanker industry had changed forever. For this reason I have made the year 2000 the cut-off for fire bomber operators included in this historical listing. I want to record the remarkable variety of fire bombing outfits, their people and their aircraft before they are forgotten.\n\nI have included agricultural spraying operators which used heavy aircraft. Some of these may have been used for fire bombing, possibly for Bureau of Land Management, State agencies, or contracts with commercial timber businesses. These are marked *\n\nI hope these listings generate additional or correcting information and more pictures.

Photo by Barney Deatrick\n\nAero Enterprises Inc, Troutdale Oregon, later Fresno California\n\nEstablished at Troutdale OR in 1946 by Robert M. Sturges trading as Columbia Airmotive Inc\n\nDuring WWII Bob Sturges had been a Boeing technical rep in Britain on B-17s and after the war set up Columbia Airmotive as an aircraft and parts dealership. He acquired the majority of Boeing's B-17 spare parts after the B-17 production lines were closed at the end of the war, making Columbia Airmotive the main source of B-17 support for civil and military customers.\n\nIn 1954 Sturges purchased the B-17 parts inventory of Kindred Aviation, Burbank CA which had broken up the final twenty B-17s of the vast numbers of war surplus aircraft at Kingman AZ.\n\nBob Sturges was a businessman and aviation entrepreneur, later being elected mayor of Troutdale. Sturges was among the first to design liquid tanks for larger aircraft initally for agricultural spraying but with the potential to drop retardant on fires.\n\nColumbia Airmotive continues to this day as a Sturges family business at Troutdale Airport, specialising in antique aircraft parts.\n\nDuring the 1950s Sturges formed two tanker businesses at Troutdale: Aero Flight Inc and Aero Enterprises Inc.\n\nAmong his many surplus military aircraft purchases, Sturges had acquired a derelict B-17F instructional airframe at Clarkston WA. He made it airworthy during 1953 and ferried it to Troutdale in February 1954 as N1340N. It was stored until converted to tanker #A34 at Klamath Falls OR in 7.61. Ownership transferred to Aero Enterprises Inc, Fresno in July 1964.\n\nAero Enterprises Inc moved base from Oregon to Fresno CA in 1964 when the company was taken over by Willis \"King\"Baker, an established tanker operator with bases at Willows CA and Fresno. King Baker had earlier been with CISCO Aircraft, Lancaster CA.\n\nThe purchase of the Northrop Reporter N9768Z from Mexico was a bold move by Baker to introduce a larger tanker, with a 1600 US gallon tank installed under its belly.\n\nAero Enterprises Inc at Fresno purchased North American T-28A Trojan N499KB circa 1967, using King Baker's initials. Sold by 1970.\n\nThe Fresno-based operation also used the name Farmers Aero Ag, Fresno CA.\n\nCeased operations in 1968 after selling both B-17s and leasing the Northrop Reporter to other Californian tanker operators\n\nAero Enterprises Inc/ Columbia Airmotive Inc, Troutdale OR:\n\nAero Enterprises Inc/ King Baker Inc, Fresno CA & Willows CA:\n\nB-17F N1340N at Long Beach CA in 1964 as tanker E34 and \"Aero Enterprises\" visible behind the engines.\n\nPhoto by Eddie Coates\n\nN1340N in a later paint scheme with Aero Enterprises.

Sturges, later elected mayor of Troutdale, Oregon and proprietor of Columbia Airmotive Inc at Troutdale Airport. See preceding listing for Aero Enterprises Inc.\n\nLiquid tanks were designed for various ex miltary aircraft, initially for agricultural spraying work, but Sturges was among the very early fire bombing experimentation. Robert's son Ray Sturges was also involved with Aero Flight.\n\nAero Flight's Chief Engineer E.H. Fletcher maintained the A-24 sprayers and A-26 tankers\n\nAero Flight Inc operated Douglas Dauntless N9142H and N4488N for many years on a mosquito spraying contract for the City of Portland.\n\nThrough his business Columbia Airmotive, Bob Sturges acquired a variety of aircraft. Some of the more interesting:\n\n- B-25K Mitchell N7674 purchased 1.69, flown in camouflage \"Dirty Gertie from Bizerti\", sold 6.78\n\n- B-17G 44-83842 USAAF registered NL1212N to Columbia Airmotive in 1947.

Photo by Ron Olsen\n\nAero Flite Inc, Cody, Wyoming, later Kingman Arizona\n\nFounded in 1963 as a fire bombing business by brothers John W. and J. Ray Eglin , at Cody WY where they operated Elgin Flying Service which was a Cessna dealership. Ray Elgin was Aero Flite President and both brothers flew the tankers.\n\nTurbo B-17 N1340N: The Elgin brothers were determined to improve B-17 performance by re-engining at least two B-17s with four RR Dart turboprop power plants from retired Viscount airliners. Aero Fite Inc planned to market the re-engining STC to other B-17 operators and made a signicant financial investment in the redesign and engineering modifications necessary. Aero Ventures Inc, an experienced tanker maintenance company at Twin Falls Idaho was tasked to carry out the work. At the end of the 1969 fire season, the first aircraft N1340N was delivered to Twin Falls. Two ex United Airlines Viscount 745Ds were acquired, N7451 ferried to Twin Falls and N7452 to Cody where it was stored pending the planned conversion of a second B-17.\n\nN1340N made its first flight as a Turbo B-17 at Twin Falls on 5.5.70 flown by Ray Elgin. The four RR Dart 510 installation weighed 3,000 lbs less than the Wright Cyclones and gave 30% increased power. After test flying, the FAA approved its commercial use as a tanker with a 400 gallons increase in retardant payload up to 2400 gallons. The increased engine power allowed return flights to base after retardant drops to be flown with the two inboard Darts shut down and props feathered, as a fuel saving measure. The Elgin brothers were enthusiastic about the Turbo B-17, but tragedy struck. On 18.8.70 the Dart B-17 crashed during a fire bombing mission near Dubois, Wyoming. Ray Eglin and copilot John Bastian were killed when the left wing struck trees during the pull up after a retardant drop. The investigation established the Density Altitude at the drop as 13,000 feet, air temperature 90F with strong up and down wind draughts.\n\nThe FAA Supplemental Type Certificate for the Turbo B-17 was never completed and no others were converted. The Cody Viscount was sold to dealer Westairnair, Albuquerque NM and the stripped Twin Falls Viscount was still there in 1973.\n\nAfter the Turbo B-17 accident, John Elgin took over as company President.\n\nOther aircraft registered to Aero Flite Inc at Cody include: Cessna 188 N9891V, Aeronca 7AC N1281E and single-engined Cessnas.\n\nBy the late 1970s operations had moved from Cody to Kingman, Arizona\n\nIn 1986 the company was taken over by Matt J. Ziomeck and operations boosted with additional fire tanker C-54s. John Elgin remained in management and as a tanker captain. Fire tanker operations included Alaska.\n\nFBO operation Kingman Aero Services was an associated business.\n\nAfter 2000 Aero Flite Inc refinanced and became a significant tanker operator in the new corporate environment, using Canadair CL-215s, turboprop CL-415s and a fleet of BAe146/RJ-85 jet tankers in association with Canadian operator Conair.\n\nThe corporate name morphed into \"Aero-Flite Inc\" but the logo is \"Aeroflite Aerial Firefighting\".\n\nCorporate office moved from Kingman to Spokane Washington effective 21 Novemner 2014.\n\nAero-Flite's remarkable \"Turbo B-17\" N1340N #A34 after being re-engined with four RR Dart turboprops.\n\nPhoto by Milo Peltzer\n\nThe sadly short-lived Turbo 17 N1340N at then home base Cody Wyoming\n\nA fine study of C-54 N96358 tanker #160 at Aero Flite's new base Kingman AZ in November 1995.\n\nPhoto by Gordon Reid\n\nAero Insect Control Inc, Cape May County Airport, Rio Grande, New Jersey\n\nPest control spraying with Boeing Stearmans by 1951.

Gilbertson and James E. Anderson.\n\nGilbertson also operated the freight and charter airline Pacific Alaska Airlines, Fairbanks using DC-3s and DC-6s\n\nDC-6B N77DG was the first DC-6 type to be certified as a fire bomber. The conversion commenced at Tucson in early 1971, ferried to Long Beach CA in May 1971 for modifications by Aircraft Associates. Then ferried to Greybull WY with belly openings covered over, for Hawkins & Powers Aviation to install their design retardant tank doors. It began its first USFS contract in 1972 summer based at Chico CA.\n\n- Five DC-3s and nine additional DC-6/C-118s of Pacific Alaska Airlines were registered to Aero Retardant Inc for varying periods.\n\nAlthough some Pacific Alaska DC-6s had cabin tanks installed to carry fuel and oil to remote Alaskan localities, only the three listed below are believed to have been operated as fire tankers by Aero Retardant Inc.\n\n- Also listed are two DC-6As leased by Pacific Alaska Airlines to Conair Ltd, Abbotsford BC for the 1976 budworm infestation forest spraying season in Quebec. They had liquid chemical tanks in the cabin and wing spraybars.\n\n- Lockheed L18 Lodestar N8008 was purchased 17.1.68 by D.G.Gilbertson & J.E.Anderson dba Aero Retardant Inc, Fairbanks AK. Ownership changed 15.7.69 to D.G.Gilbertson dba Aircraft Marketing Inc.

An associated business to Richardson Airway, Yakima WA which was formed in 1950 by Ralph Ray Richardson, a wartime USAAF pilot, as an ag spraying operation. In 1951 Ralph Richardson formed Richardson Aviation as a FBO and flight school. He had modified his black T-6 Texan to carry 3 passengers.\n\nRichardson Airway had Boeing Stearman biplanes, then purchased Navy disposals Grumman TBMs which were converted to heavy sprayers which operated in USA and Canada. Some flew to Greece to spray olive tree plantations. Ralph Richardson flew agricultural work until aged 70.\n\nto Two TB-25N Mitchells were purchased from USAF disposals and fitted with 1,000 gallon liquid tanks for fire bombing. The first completed was N9866C in May 1959 and operated for the 1959 fire season by Richardson's Airway. The company's entry into fire bombing seems to have ended in 1960 when both B-25 tankers were sold.\n\nRalph R. Richardson with his wife Jinny and child with one of the B-25s\n\nUndated picture of Ralph Richardson with his Grumman TBM N7032C - but which one?\n\nAero Union Corp, Chico, California\n\nThe largest US fire bomber operator, Aero Union was a leader in introducing new aircraft types and improved retardant tank and delivery system designs. The company also bid for US Forest Service contracts for support work such as transporting fire fighters and equipment.\n\nFounded in 1959 by Richard E. Foy and Dale P. Newton under the original name Western Air Industries, Anderson California.\n\nTheir first season used a B-25 tanker based at nearby Redding Airport CA. In 1961 the name was changed to Aero Union Corporation and the first two B-17 Fortress tankers were purchased.\n\nDuring 1962 Aero Union moved its base to Chico Municipal Airport where it built up a major maintenance and engineering facility in the former air force hangars. Dale Newton was President, Dick Foy was Vice President and during the 1970-80s another experienced tanker man Roy D Reagan held a management position. Dick Foy left AU in 1989 to continue as Captain and Operations Manager of AU's Mini Guppy N422AU when it was sold to Jack Erickson as a freighter.\n\nAU made a bold move in the late 1960s with the bulk purchase of ten Fairchild C-119C Flying Boxcars from USAF disposals at Davis Monthan AFB AZ to be its next generation heavy tankers. Included in the deal was a large stock of engines and spare parts stored in a hangar at Coolidge AZ. Five C-119Cs were ferried to Chico to be modified to tankers and five left in storage at Tucson to be stripped for parts as required. In 1974, with Douglas C-54s becoming available from military disposals, AU sold its C-119C tankers to Hemet Valley Flying Service, the sale including all spares inventory which included the five spare aircraft in Tucson.\n\nAU retired its Grumman Avengers and Guardians at the end of the 1973 season when USFS dropped contracts for single-engined aircraft due to high accident rates. The introduction of Douglas C-54s and DC-6s as fire bombers allowed AU to find freight work outside the summer fire season. They were used for general cargo work as well as contracts to support fire operations. Aero Union's engineering experience on large prop transports resulted in AU-designed tanks being fitted to other operator's aircraft: during 1971-72 AU installed tanks in three Hawkins & Powers Aviation C-119Gs at Chico and in 1974 tanked two C-119Cs for Hemet Valley Flying Service. AU also carried out civil conversions and modifications at Chico on a variety of heavy aircraft. A number of additional C-54s were acquired either to be stripped for parts or resale.\n\nDuring the year 2000 AU collaborated with Canadian companies Conair and Kelowna Flightcraft to develop the Convair 580 tanker. AU was contracted by Conair to adapt the AU constant-flow retardanrt delivery system for the CV580 and complete the design and certification for the type. The AU constant flow belly tank is a 1,750 Imperial Gallon capacity single non-compartmentalised reservoir, operated by a digital controller in the cockpit. Aeron Union carried out the work on a contract basis, but did not operate CV580s themselves\n\nAero Union Corp unexpectedly ceased operations in May 2011. The year began with an operational fleet of eight P-3 Orion Aerostars, but an FAA audit determined that AU was not in compliance with a mandatory structural fatigue inspection program. USFS cancelled Aero Union's current $30M contract for 6 P-3 tankers. Desperate negotiations to keep the P-3s in service failed and Aero Union filed for bankrupcy and over 200 employees lost their jobs.\n\nThe company had recently been taken over by new management following lengthy legal disputes and Federal court actions over ownership of ex-military P-3s and C-130s acquired under a USFS aircraft exchange scheme. This involved other tanker companies and became known as the USFS Air Tanker Scandal, resulting in Roy D. Reagan and a senior USFS official being jailed. The Government, through USFS, resumed ownership of a number of involved P-3s and C-130s from tanker companies, including Aero Union.\n\nBetween 1979-1982 AU acquired nine former US Navy Douglas C-117D transports from military surplus sales at Davis Monthan AFB Arizona. This was reported to have been an exchange program with the USAF Museum in return for retired AU aircraft which were restored for static display in original military markings and delivered to USAF base museums around the country. Most C-117Ds were ferried to Chico for civil conversion and resale as freighters, although the last three were left in storage in civil contractor's yards at Davis Monthan, stripped of engines and parts. The civilianised C-117Ds may have been used by AU on USFS support work prior to their resale.\n\nC-117Ds: N1037A, N5597T, N5597V, N5598B, N5584N, Bu17160, Bu17287. Also civil Super DC-3S N567M.\n\nThe freight business was expanded to handle outsize cargo with the purchase of an ATL-98 Carvair and Aero Spacelines Mini Guppy:\n\n- Air Traders ATL-98 Carvair N55243 (c/n 17 ex Sfair F-BVEF) purchased 26.11.79, ferried from France to Chico.

Canadair CL-215s were initially considered but at second-hand prices of around $4M each, retired Canadian water bombing Catalinas were a much more economical proposition. They were equipped to scoop up to 1400 gallons of water during low pick-up runs across lakes. The partners went to Parry Sound, Ontario to inspect two retired Avalon Aviation Catalina tankers being offered for sale. C-FGLX, a Canadian built OA-10A Catalina equivalent to PBY-5A) with 1,000 gallon water tank had recently completed an annual inspection and was fitted with low time engines with new propellers. It was purchased and ferried to Carson City NV for US certification by Dennis Buehn's American Warbirds, being registered N322FA on 7 June 1996. It went into action as tanker #115 in July 1996 based at Orange County and using the numerous lakes and reservoirs across Southern California.\n\nN322FA was lost on 1 August 1997 when John Wells was making his third water scooping run on the surface of San Vincente Reservoir. A nosewheel door had become unlocked, causing an implosion which split open the hull. The Catalina sank and Wells and his copilot were injured.\n\nBeing high fire season, it was quickly replaced by a PBY-6A tanker C-FPIU from the same source at Parry Sound, Ontario. It became N324FA and entered AFA service with the same tanker number #115, painted in the same bright red scheme with the slogan California Water Bomber.\n\nAfter working through the following summer, AFA received insufficient contractual hours from California Department of Forestry to continue. The PBY-6A was sold on the warbird market.\n\nNote: A 1989 USFS list of allocated tanker numbers shows #116 allocated to a presumably unrelated operator named Airborne Fire Attack for a Grumman HU-16T Turbine Albatross. It remained as a reservation only.\n\nThe only contender was HU-16E N70263 (c/n G-309) which was being rebuilt in 1995-1996 at Mesa AZ by Marsh Aviation with Garrett turbines as as a turboprop water bomber for an undisclosed buyer.

Two 275 gallon tanks in tandem each with 9”x 20” bomb doors were installed, to carry a mixture of water and Sodium Calcite-borate, a maximum payload of 5500 lbs. Cables to the cockpit allowed the release of one or both tanks. Flight testing showed the Ford could lay a swath of retardant in a 70ft x 700ft area. In 1957, Higby made 74 drops on severe fires in the Payette and Boise National Forests in a Ford and is credited with bringing one of the fires under ciontrol.\n\nThe company had a second Ford N9612 which was also modified for fire bombing by 1957 with three 100 gallon tanks. It was flown by William Hadden on fires in Montana and Idaho. It was sold to Johnson Flying Service at Missoula MT who did trial water drops on 8 August 1957 before USFS dispatched it to eight fires that month.\n\nAircraft Service Co was still in business at Bradley Field, Boise by 1954.\n\nFord 4-AT-E\n\nN8407\n\n697.55-5.58\n\npurchased 1.7.55 ex David Callender, Eagle ID as crop sprayer, converted to fire bomber 55\n\nsold 22.5.58 to Johnson Flying Service MT\n\nFord 4-AT-E\n\nN9612\n\n55\n\n1956-1957\n\nreportedly conv. to fire bomber\n\nsold .57 to Johnson Flying Service MT which used it as a fire bomber 8.57\n\nFord Tri-Motor N9612 dropping retandant circa 1957 Photo: USFS\n\nAircraft Specialties Inc, Mesa Arizona\n\nAircraft Specialties Inc, 4600 East McKillops Road, Mesa AZ, later 2410 Airline Way, Falcon Field, Mesa, Phoenix AZ\n\nFounded c1960 by Richard E.

Spraying and firebombing operations continued\n\nunder the name Aircraft Specialties.\n\nDuring 1976 Aircraft Specialities reported that spraying fleet was deployed that year on large-scale contracts for budworm forest spraying in Maine and Georgia.\n\nBy 1977 some sections of the business, including B-17 fire bombers, was conducted under the name of associated company Globe Air Inc. Effective April 1981 a business reorganisation resulted in all operations transferred to Globe Air Inc. Abe Sellards and Gene Packard continued to manage the operation until 1985 when the decision was taken to close down. An auction sale of aircraft and assets valued at over $4M commenced on 24 October 1985 at Mesa-Falcon Field.\n\nSikorsky S-55 Whirlwinds:\n\nDuring the 1960s large stocks of military disposals Sikorsky S-55 helicopters were acquired and rebuilt at Mesa as civil conversions.

Further development led to electric activation systems controlled from a cockpit console. ARDCO carried out the conversion for other C-54 tanker operators, including Aero Flite's N96358.\n\n- In a tragic accident on 2 December 1980, Clyde Alford and his copilot were killed when WAIG C-54 N96449 #118 collided mid-air with WAIG C-54 N406WA #119 near Palm Springs CA. Kenny White and Gary Garrett in the damaged #119 were able to make an emergency landing at Palm Springs CA. Their C-54 was repaired and returned to WAIG service.\n\nWAIG Aircraft Inc was reformed during 1981 as ARDO Inc with initial principle officers Ken White and Gary Garrett, both Captains on C-54 tankers.\n\nKenny White retired in 1991, and in 1996 Gary Garrett and his wife Meegan (a C-54 copilot) bought out Roger Iverson's share in the company.\n\nGary and Meegan operated the business until C-54s were no longer contracted by the USFS.\n\nARDCO's base at Tucson-Ryan Field was badly damaged by a storm on 23 July 1998 when the WWII vintage wooden hangar was destroyed. The company had three new buildings erected as office, workshop and parts store.\n\nIn August 1999 at the closing-down auction of Catalina tanker operator SLAFCO in Washington, ARDCO successfully bid for a stock of Wright R-2600 Twin Cyclone power plants. N406WA had been re-engined with R-2600s back in 1977 when tanked by WAIG Inc, but no other ARDCO C-54s were fitted with these more powerful engines.\n\nFor the 2001 fire season:\n\nBases: Redding CA and Lancaster-Fox Field CA\n\nDirector of Maintenance: Pete Taylor\n\nCaptains include: Gary Garett, Gary Towle, Steve Howland,\n\nCopilots incude: Meegan Garrett, Pierre Delvoix, Todd Tomkins,\n\nFlight engineers include: Terry Wood, Dave Lahn, Barry Sandberg\n\nARDCO appears to have ceased flying by 2005.

By 1949 Avery was working for Lynch Flying Services at nearby Billings, Montana flying their Cessna T-50 Bobcats on pest spraying and grass hopper baiting.\n\nDuring 1949 Morris Avery and Mel Christler decided to become partners in their own chemical application business and formed a new company Christler and Avery Aviation Co, Greybull WY (details under Christler Flying Service in part 2 of this series).\n\nThe two partners built up the operation to gain extensive freight and support work for the US Forest Service, purchasing heavy aircraft such as Douglas B-18s, US Coast Guard surplus Consolidated PB4Y-2 Privateers and USAF surplus North American B-25 Mitchells for spraying and fire bombing. Christler and Avery Aviation Co introduced the first helicopters for commercial work in the region, their first being a Bell 47 delivered to Greybull by Morris Avery, the beginning of a substantial rotary wing division.\n\nIn 1961 Mel Christler left Greybull to take up a corporate pilot position. Morris Avery purchased his share in the business and the company was reformed in August 1961 under the name Avery Aviation Inc, Greybull WY.\n\nAvery Aviation continued the same operations of fire bombing, pest spraying and fire-ant baiting contracts, but increased the helicopter fleet for spraying and general charter. Heavy-lift helicopter work including forest logging was undertaken with three military surplus Kaman H-43 Huskies. When Morris Avery was suffering health problems, Privateer tanker pilot Gene Powers recruited experienced helicopter instructor Dan Hawkins from Texas to join the company to look after the rotary wing division.\n\nDuring 1961 Avery Aviation branched into a short-lived passenger airline with Beech 18 N9306Z operating as Sage Airlines. Services were flown between Greybull and other northern Wyoming towns to Casper WY but patronage was disappointing and services ceased. N9306Z was converted with a chemical tank in the cabin and wing spraybars to join two other Beech 18s on pest spraying contracts.\n\nMorris Avery died in 1965 following complications after leg surgery. His widow Reba managed the company with the help of pilots Dan Hawkins and Gene Powers. In 1969 she sold the company to them and it was renamed Hawkins & Powers Aviation Inc.\n\nAvery Aviation Inc helicopters: most registered in the aerial agriculural and fire fighting categories:\n\nBell 47 N73211, N73217\n\nHiller UH-12 N9748C, N9727C, N9754C, N5369V, N5389V, N9733C, N5343V\n\nFairchild Hiller FH1100 N435FH\n\nKaman HH-43A Husky N2843J (ex 58-1823) purchased 20.2.68 ex Rosenbalm, sprayer.
