Investigating the possibility of a relationship between minimalist and maximalist packaging designs and its influence on consumer perceptions within the personal care and prepackaged food industries could provide beneficial research to companies about how to effectively design their products’ packaging.\n\nThesis Summary\n\nThis thesis encompasses the impact of product design on consumer perceptions of the brand and products. Specifically, the influence of minimalist and maximalist design on consumer's perceptions of the naturalness of a product, the quality of a product, and the playfulness of a brand. This thesis helps businesses accurately market their products and brands to reflect their core values and efficiently send the desired message to the consumer. While many studies have been done to distinguish the influence of minimalism and maximalism on consumer perceptions, this study aims to differentiate those influences across product categories. Therefore, this study involves fabricated personal care and packaged food products that were utilized as stimuli. The findings supported previous understandings of the influence of minimalist and maximalist designs but also supported the hypothesis that product category matters and perceptions of a product and brand based on design differentiate across product categories."
