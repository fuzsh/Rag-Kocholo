        "text": "In recent years, minimalist interior design has seen renewed popularity, especially as people strive to lead more simplistic lives free of clutter. If you’re interested in getting into interior design as a career, then there’s a good chance you’ll have your fair share of clients looking for minimalism and simplicity in design.\n\nWith a deeper understanding of minimalist interior design and what it entails, plus how this style incorporates elements of sustainable living, you can be prepared to meet your clients’ demands as an up-and-coming interior design professional.\n\nUnderstanding Minimalist Interior Design\n\nSo, what exactly is minimalist interior design and why has it suddenly become so popular? In many ways, minimalism in interior design is closely connected to the concept of a minimalist lifestyle that aims to avoid excess and clutter in all areas of life.\n\nDefinition and Principles of Minimalist Interior Design\n\nIn interior design specifically, minimalism refers to design choices that prioritize simplicity and functionality over everything else. In a minimalist space, you’ll typically observe such characteristics as:\n\nNeutral or earthy color schemes\n\nVery little accessories, trinkets and overall clutter\n\nSleek furnishings with clean lines\n\nPerhaps one of the easiest ways of thinking about minimalist interior design is to remember that less is actually more.\n\nBenefits of Minimalist Interior Design\n\nThere are numerous potential advantages of minimalism in interior design, whether it’s a minimalist bedroom design or even a minimalist wardrobe. First and foremost, these kinds of designs focus on doing more with less, which ultimately means less clutter and improved functionality of a space.\n\nMinimalist designs also tend to come with less cleaning and maintenance because there’s less furniture to dust/polish and fewer items to organize. Some might even argue that a more simplistic and decluttered space can be better for focus and productivity.\n\nIn many ways, minimalist designs also tend to be more sustainable and thus, better for the environment. By making more conscious and intentional furniture and design choices, it is possible to embrace eco-conscious living without sacrificing a beautiful home.\n\nMinimalist Home Decor Trends\n\nWhile minimalism itself is hardly a new concept, it has gained significant popularity in recent years. Interior designers are tasked with staying on top of the latest trends as they relate to minimalist home accessories, minimalist home organization and minimalist furniture ideas.\n\nMinimalist Decor Ideas for Different Rooms\n\nSo, what might a minimalist design look like in different rooms of the home? The living room is a common starting point for people striving for a minimalist design. Here, you would want to focus on embracing natural light while investing in quality furniture items, such as tables and sofas, that will last for years to come. Living rooms are also great spaces to celebrate focal points, such as fireplaces.\n\nWhat about a minimalist bedroom design? Professional designers might focus on sticking with a neutral color scheme and perhaps adding visual interest with a subtle accent wall. Likewise, opting for simplistic furniture, like bed frames, nightstands and dressers, with clean lines and minimizing clutter on surfaces can go a long way.\n\nMinimalist Color Schemes\n\nColor is another important consideration in minimalist interior design. Typically, minimalist designs are more neutral colors and colors found in nature. This can include whites, off-whites, browns, tans and greys. However, this isn’t to say that a minimalist home design can never incorporate bold colors. Instead, bold colors should be embraced in moderation, often used as accents where suitable.\n\nWhen adding pops of color to an otherwise minimalist palette, saturated hues tend to complement lighter colors well. Consider shades of navy, green and even black to make a statement while keeping lines clean and sophisticated.\n\nExploring Minimalist Architecture\n\nOf course, minimalism isn’t just for interior design. It can also be found in other realms, including architecture. Even if you don’t have plans to get into architecture as part of your own career path, interior designers can benefit from applying their knowledge of minimalist architecture to their own interior work.\n\nKey Features of Minimalist Architecture\n\nLike minimalist interior design, minimalist architecture embraces the idea of less being more with lots of clean lines and simple shapes. In fact, it is not uncommon to find simple shapes and angles in repetition as part of a minimalist building design.\n\nFrom a color perspective, minimalist architecture also focuses on neutral color schemes to promote a sense of calm and even sophistication. Whites, off-whites, grays and lighter shades of brown are commonly seen in this style of building, though bolder accent colors may also be incorporated.\n\nFinally, minimalist architecture focuses on using simple yet durable materials that will stand up to the test of time. Common materials used in minimalist architecture may include:\n\nConcrete\n\nGlass\n\nWood\n\nStone\n\nExamples of Iconic Minimalist Structures\n\nAround the globe, there are plenty of examples of minimalist architecture to admire. You can read more about some of the most beautiful minimalist buildings around the world here, but some top picks include:\n\nThe Barcelona Pavilion (Spain)\n\nChichu Art Museum (Japan)\n\nMuseum of Islamic Art (Qatar)\n\nSt. Mortiz Church (Switzerland)\n\nScandinavian Minimalism and Its Global Influence\n\nClosely related to the concept of minimalist interior design is the idea of Scandinavian minimalism, which continues to influence the modern minimalist homes of today.\n\nOverview of Scandinavian Minimalism\n\nSpecifically, Scandinavian minimalism refers to a concept followed by many Nordic countries focused on living simply and functionally while staying as connected to nature as possible. Following these key concepts, Scandinavian-inspired spaces don’t contain any items that don’t serve a meaningful purpose. This means that you won’t even find basic home decor if it doesn’t offer a practical function.\n\nIncorporating Scandinavian Minimalism Into Home Decor\n\nWhile Scandinavian minimalism isn’t too far removed from minimalist interior design as we know it today, it is crucial to understand that the former is more focused on a connection to nature. With this in mind, there are some basic best practices that interior designers should keep in mind when incorporating Scandinavian minimalism into their own work.\n\nThe focus should be on making sure that every item in the home serves a purpose or fulfills a need. If not, then it has no place in the design. From there, focus on nature-inspired color schemes and inviting plenty of natural light into the space itself.\n\nMaterial choices matter deeply in Scandinavian design, too. Ideally, materials should be reflective of nature, with popular options including stone, wood and wool. It is also common for these spaces to incorporate plenty of greenery as a means of bridging interior spaces with the great outdoors.\n\nMinimalist Living Tips and Functional Minimalism\n\nWhile many interior design clients have a desire to embrace minimalism in their lives, the reality is that this can be easier said than done. This is especially true for those living in western cultures, where there is often a lot of focus on consumption and collecting the next big thing.\n\nStill, there are some practical tips that everybody looking to live more simplistically can follow to embrace the minimalist lifestyle for good.\n\nPractical Tips for Embracing Minimalist Living\n\nOne of the first steps that you should take if you want to embrace a minimalist lifestyle is to declutter your life. This can be a time-consuming process, but it involves going through every space in your home and getting rid of things that no longer serve a functional purpose or bring you happiness.\n\nFor some, this may also mean adopting a minimalist wardrobe where you stick to just a few key pieces that you can mix and match to achieve different outfits. From there, embracing minimalist living also means investing in quality furniture pieces that will hold up your needs not just now, but years down the road.\n\nFunctional Minimalism in Everyday Life\n\nOne of the most critical things to keep in mind when it comes to incorporating functional minimalism into your everyday life is to think before you bring anything new into your home. Specifically, you’ll want to take some time to really consider what benefits the item will bring to the space and whether it is actually worth making the purchase. By focusing more on adding only things that serve function and value, you can keep your space free of clutter and renew your focus on the things that matter most.\n\nMinimalism and Sustainability\n\nIn addition to creating more simplistic living spaces easier to maintain, minimalism also goes together with sustainability and eco-friendly living.\n\nEnvironmental Benefits of Minimalism\n\nThere are many ways in which minimalism can help the environment, starting with the fact that minimalism means buying and consuming less. This translates to less waste that ends up in landfills. Meanwhile, because minimalism focuses on purchasing items, such as furniture, that will last for a long time, this also cuts down on waste that can harm the environment.\n\nSustainable Minimalist Brands and Products\n\nFortunately, there are several brands these days that focus on sustainability and minimalism in their products. You can explore some of the top sustainable furniture companies here, with notable mentions including:\n\nMaiden Home\n\nKaiyo\n\nInside Weather\n\nWest Elm\n\nMinimalist Aesthetics in Global Fashion Trends\n\nIn addition to interior design, it’s also common to find minimalist influences in today’s global fashion trends.\n\nMinimalist Fashion Design\n\nMinimalist fashion design refers to styles that emphasize simplicity and function above all else. These pieces typically incorporate neutral colors, as well as clean lines and minimal accents or embellishments. Minimalist fashion design also means cultivating wardrobes that have fewer pieces, with each piece serving multiple functions and having the ability to be paired with any number of other options.\n\nAdvantages of Minimalist Fashion\n\nMany people are turning to minimalist fashion and even creating minimalist wardrobe, and for good reason. With more minimalist fashion choices comes a greater sense of sustainability because the pieces that you do choose will last for years to come. Meanwhile, minimalist wardrobes don’t really go out of style because of their simplicity, so they can save money on having to buy new clothes to keep up with the latest trends each year.\n\nFinally, a minimalist wardrobe can save time and space. With fewer options to choose from and greater versatility, picking an outfit and getting dressed for any occasion is easier and quicker than ever.\n\nExplore Interior Design Degree Programs\n\nThere’s a lot to love about minimalist and sustainable interior design, and it’s unlikely that this trend is going anywhere anytime soon. As an aspiring interior designer, knowing how to incorporate elements of minimalist design into your clients’ properties can help you propel your career forward while staying on-trend.\n\nReady to pursue a formal education in interior design?
