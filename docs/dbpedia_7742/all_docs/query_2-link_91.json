        "text": "The term “abstract expressionism” was first used in 1919 by the German magazine Der Sturm to label the (mainly ) German artistic response to WWI. In the United States it was Alfred Barr who first used the term in a 1929 essay on Wassily Kandinsky. But in 1946 the American art critic Robert Coates (1897-1973) was the first to apply the term to an art movement developed in New York City in the 1940s in response to WWII. It is now applied exclusively to the first specifically American art movement to achieve international influence and which replaced Paris with New York as the centre of Modern Art.\n\nThis came about partly because European artists, writers, poets, collectors and dealers fled the Nazis during the 1930s, seeking safe haven in the United States. Many were Jewish or proponents of what Hitler called ‘degenerate’ art (Nazi art was mainly a kitch imitation of classical Greek and Roman art). Artists coming to America included Max Ernst, Peggy Guggenheim, Marcel Duchamp, André Masson, André Breton, Marc Chagall, Fernand Léger, and Piet Mondrian. A few artists, notably Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, and Pierre Bonnard remained in France and survived.\n\nTroubled by the dark side of humanity revealed by war, young artists in America too were anxious about man’s irrationality and vulnerability. They wanted to express their concerns in a new art of meaning and substance. Whereas traditional art depicts recognizable images, abstract art broke away from representation and – through exploring relationships of form and colour – sought to open new territory. Expressionism, it will be recalled, seeks to articulate the inner feelings of the artist rather than the object of the art. Surrealism had tried to tap the unconscious and break free of the conscious mind through, for example, psychic automatism that gave free rein to automatic gesture and improvisation (i.e. Left: André Masson. Automatic Drawing, 1924).\n\nEarly Abstract Expressionism turned to myth and primitive forms for inspiration. Influenced by Jungian psychology, early works by Mark Rothko, Jackson Pollock, Robert Motherwell, Adolph Gottlieb and Barnett Newman (Right: Onement 1, 1948) sought to transform archaic motifs, seeming to create personal codes out of a collective unconscious without interference from conscious premeditation. “To us,” wrote Gottlieb and Rothko in an open letter to the New York Times in June 1943, “art is an adventure into an unknown world of the imagination which is fancy-free and violently opposed to common sense. There is no such thing as a good painting about nothing. We assert that the subject is critical.”\n\nBy 1947, Jackson Pollock had devised his radical new technique of dripping paint onto raw canvas laid on the ground (actually this had its roots in the work of André Masson and Max Ernst) and Willem de Kooning was working on his own gestural style by alternating abstraction with iconic figurative images (Leftt: de Kooning, Woman I, 1950-52). Meanwhile Lee Krasner and Franz Kline, were engaged in creating an art in which every inch of the canvas was fully charged to communicate a direct immediacy of the artist’s identity. Physical evidence of the artist’s dynamic process of creation in the painting gave rise to critic Harold Rosenberg in 1952 coining the term “action painting”: “At a certain moment the canvas began to appear to one American painter after another as an arena in which to act—rather than as a space in which to reproduce, re-design, analyze, or ‘express’ an object, actual or imagined. What was to go on the canvas was not a picture but an event.”\n\nThe central impulse of Abstract Expressionism was reflective and cerebral and the chief works simplified with a view to creating an elemental impact. The aims of Rothko and Newman, for example, were to achieve something “sublime” rather than “beautiful.” The works of Rothko in particular, with their glowing, soft-edged blocks of colour, sought to create a quasi-religious experience and were meant to be seen in relatively closed environments even while themselves being large. “I paint big,” said Rothko, “to be intimate.” The scale of an Abstract Expressionist paintings is part of its meaning. Rothko’s Untitled (No. 11), below, measures 79 inches by 69 inches.\n\nAs the 2013 Christies catalogue put it, there is a “unique combination of serenity and a ferocious, almost volcanically violent energy trapped and vibrating in the confined space of the work’s surface that is conveyed by a work such as Untitled, (No 11). Like the mesmerizing image of a sunset (or perhaps the more-publicized series of man-made nuclear explosions that peppered the torturous political and psychological landscape of the 1950s), Untitled (No. 11) appears to hover between sublime beauty and a hitherto unknown and immeasurable violence.”\n\nHowever, there is a sinister background to Abstract Expressionism that throws doubt on the authenticity of the movement – even if the artists themselves were sincere. Most Americans hated Modern Art in the 1950s, so it is ironic that the Central Intelligence Agency at the time were promoting Abstract Expressionism as a truly American aesthetic and deploying works by artists such as Jackson Pollock, Robert Motherwell, Willem de Kooning and Mark Rothko as weapons in the Cold War.\n\nIn the propaganda war with the Soviet Union, this new artistic movement could be held up as proof of the creativity, the intellectual freedom, and the cultural power of the US. To globalize this new, American art, the CIA dumped millions of dollars into fake foundations to sponsored international exhibitions. Former CIA operative Tom Braden: “We would go to somebody in New York who was a well-known rich person and we would say, ‘We want to set up a foundation.’ We would tell him what we were trying to do and pledge him to secrecy, and he would say, ‘Of course I’ll do it,’ and then you would publish a letterhead and his name would be on it and there would be a foundation. It was really a pretty simple device.”\n\nAbstract Expressionism held sway through the 1940s and 1950s but in 1959 a series of black striped paintings by Frank Stella turned the gestural brushwork and intense passion of Abstract Expressionism on its head (Right: Black II, 1959). By neglecting emotional content and focusing instead on the basic elements of line, plane, volume, color, shape, and composition Stella spearheaded a new movement. Minimalism sought to distance itself from the Abstract Expressionists by removing suggestions of biography from their art or, indeed, metaphors of any kind. Denying expression, the minimalist project avoided fine art references by creating sleek, geometric works that challenged conventional appeal.\n\nThe wave of new artists were influenced by styles that were being rediscovered, which led them to question boundaries between media and blur distinctions between painting and sculpture, for example. They avoided overt symbolism and emphasised the often pre-fabricated, industrial materials in their works. By the end of the 1970s, Minimalism in America and Europe had gained the approval of museums, art dealers and a range of private and government-led institutions.\n\nMinimalist music features repetition and iteration such as those in works by Terry Riley, Steve Reich, Philip Glass, and John Adams. Minimalist has also been used to describe the plays and novels of Samuel Beckett, the films of Robert Bresson, the stories of Raymond Carver. Minimalist painters include Kenneth Noland, Al Held, Ellsworth Kelly, Robert Ryman ; sculptors including David Smith, Anthony Caro, Tony Smith, Sol LeWitt, Carl Andre, Dan Flavin, Donald Judd. It European roots clearly draw on the Bauhaus, works of Kazimir Malevich, Piet Mondrian, artists associated with the De Stijl movement, the paintings of Barnett Newman (left: The Voice of Fire, 1967) Ad Reinhardt, Josef Albers, and even artists as diverse as Pablo Picasso, Marcel Duchamp, Giorgio Morandi.\n\nFor some, minimalism sought to de-mystify art and was welcome. Others objected to the Minimalist work on the basis of its “theatricality”; Michael Fried, felt that minimalist sculpture in particular was all about spectacle rather than contemplation and that a displacement of the viewer’s experience from an engagement within, to an event outside the artwork was a failure. But Ad Reinhardt, a veteran of Abstract Expressionism whose all black paintings (above) had anticipated minimalism, disagreed: “The more stuff in it, the busier the work of art, the worse it is. More is less. Less is more. The eye is a menace to clear sight. The laying bare of oneself is obscene. Art begins with the getting rid of nature.” (Art as Art: The Selected Writings of Ad Reinhardt. Ed. Rose, Barbara. New York: Viking Press, 1975).\n\nIn the fields of both painting (Frank Stella, Kenneth Noland, Al Held, Ellsworth Kelly, Robert Ryman) and sculpture (i.e. David Smith,Anthony Caro, Tony Smith, Sol LeWitt, Carl Andre, Dan Flavin, Donald Judd) minimalism was being explored. Flavin’s first fluorescent light works were showcased at the Manhattan’s Green Gallery in 1964, while other leading Manhattan galleries also began to show artists focusing on geometric abstraction. More seminal museum exhibitions followed showcasing Geometric abstraction that was beginning to be called minimal art emerged.\n\nDonald Judd (1928 – 1994) turned away from painting in the early 1960s to focus on sculpture and the problem of unifying elements of a work. In its repetition of serial forms and spaces, the vertical stack of Untitled (left, 1969) literally incorporates space as one of its materials, along with highly polished copper, creating a play between positive and negative that coheres into a totality.\n\nMinimal Art is thus related to a number of other movements such as Conceptual Art in the way the finished work exists merely to convey a theory; Pop Art’s fascination with the impersonal, or Land Art in the construction of simple shapes. Minimal Art proved highly successful and was influential in the 20th century."
