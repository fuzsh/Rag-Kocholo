        "text": "HISTORICAL BACKGROUND:\n\nTHE INCLUSION OF PEOPLE OF COLOR IN AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGY\n\nThe establishment and building of an academic discipline is a complicated, painstaking process that involves vision and immense labor by generations of the discipline's leaders. As noted in numerous documented histories of psychology, it also involves onerous institution-building that takes the form of developing departments or academic centers for teaching, research, and scholarship in the discipline; establishing scholarly and professional journals and societies; developing numerous standards of professional conduct in such areas as scholarship, research, teaching, ethics; and numerous other efforts.\n\nOnce firmly established, disciplines do evolve in response to various changes in social-historical, political-economic, and academic contexts. When such contextual changes are dramatic or buttressed by major economic incentives, the associated changes within a discipline can occur relatively quickly. Within psychology in the United States, such dramatic change occurred in response to the establishment of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in 1949, a mission-oriented research agency with an applied research emphasis. Consistent with this emphasis, applications for NIMH research and demonstration project funding are encouraged on specific targeted topics whose identification is guided by both scientific interests and compelling national interests (National Academy of Science, 1964; York, 1978). As a result of NIMH funding, major research programs and institutes were established within departments of psychology, the financial underpinning of psychology departments was transformed, and clinical psychology ascended as a specialty area within psychology.\n\nMore recently, a similar type of relatively dramatic and rapid change occurred in response to the nation's changing and increasingly diverse workforce and occupational structures. During the past 25 years-as women increased their rate of participation in postsecondary education and men increasingly opted for new occupational roles in expanding professional and technical disciplines (e. g., computer science, business, and law)-psychology became \"feminized\" in its gender composition. In 1971, women constituted 25% of doctoral recipients in psychology; in 1991, they comprised 61% of such recipients (APA Task Force, 1995).\n\nBut more often than not, academic disciplines are conservative entities-rooted in tradition, and tending to welcome change only as a slow, incremental, consensual process. This certainly has been the case for change related to the need for psychology to more aggressively address the needs of communities of color-including dramatically increasing its knowledge and efforts related to the recruitment, retention and graduation, and education and training of people of color in psychology.\n\nSelected key events during the past 75 years related to ethnic minority recruitment, retention, and training in psychology are noted on the following Timeline of Challenge and Progress: The Inclusion of People of Color in Psychology in the United States. This timeline reveals many historical continuities. For example:\n\nPsychologists of color, with a few recent exceptions, were not at the table when various critical structures and procedures of their discipline were conceived and developed in the United States. Consequently, psychologists of color, again and again, have initiated \"corrective action\" strategies for including their perspectives and interests and those of communities of color through revision and reform of extant structures and procedures of psychology in the United States.\n\nEven in the face of the minimalist action inherent in incremental change, psychologists of color have been remarkably consistent over time in their statements of needed strategies for increasing ethnic minority participation in psychology and for ensuring that psychology effectively addresses the behavioral, mental health, and empowerment needs of communities of color.\n\nPsychologists of color have assumed primary responsibility for constructing structures (organizations, journals, etc.) for ensuring their professional survival and development as psychologists of color.\n\nThe American Psychological Association-especially its Board of Directors and its Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues (Division 9)-while often the target of criticism, nevertheless has served as an enabler and supporter of efforts related to greater racial/ethnic inclusion in psychology.\n\nFederal mental health agencies-especially the National Institute of Mental Health and more recently the Center for Mental Health Services-have provided financial support for some of the most critical initiatives related to increased racial/ethnic inclusion in psychology.\n\nBut the Timeline also reflects one major shift in the efforts related to the inclusion of people of color in psychology. Those efforts, over time, have become diversified. While efforts in the 1960s focused almost exclusively on African Americans, during the 1970s other racial/ethnic groups found their critical mass-and their voice-within psychology.\n\nAs people of color gained their voices within psychology, the various ethnic minority groups continuously demonstrated a most profound understanding of the principles of and interactions among systems intervention, organizational and institutional change, and multicultural dynamics: Psychologists of color exhibited a rock solid commitment to intergroup alliance and cooperation. The 1970s to the present have been marked by an often explicit commitment among psychologists of color to resist attempts to formulate ethnic minority inclusion issues in terms that promote competition for resources among the various ethnic minority groups. Instead, psychologists of color consistently have articulated strategies that are inclusive and pluralistic (both philosophically and politically)-and punctuated with racial/ethnic- and cultural-specificity.\n\nSymbolically, such commitment is most prominently represented by the 1992 establishment of the Council of National Psychological Associations for the Advancement of Ethnic Minority Interests (CNPAAEMI, 1992). This council consists of the presidents of the four national ethnic minority psychological associations as well as the president of APA and the president of the Society for the Psychological Study of Ethnic Minority Issues (Division 45 of the APA). The council seeks to address public policy issues of importance to psychologists of color and the communities they serve.\n\nThe diversification of efforts related to the inclusion of people of color in psychology is directly related to the nation's changing demographics. Currently, African Americans are the nation's largest ethnic minority group. But as a result of birth rates and immigration, the growth rates of American Indians, Asian Americans, and Hispanics/Latino(a)s are increasing much faster than those of African Americans and non-Hispanic Whites. Indeed between 1980 and 1992, the nation's White population (not of Hispanic origin) increased 5.5% (from 180. 9 million to 190. 8 million), while the African American population increased 16.0% (from 26. 1 million to 30. 3 million). In contrast, during that same time period, the American Indian/Alaska Native population increased 39.5% (from 1. 3 million to 1. 85 million); Hispanics/Latino(a)s increased 65.9% (from 14. 6 million to 24. 2 million); and Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders increased 121.0% (from 3. 6 million to 7. 9 million)\n\n(U. S. Bureau of the Census, 1994, Table No. 18). Indeed, it is estimated that by the year 2055, the United States will be a truly pluralistic nation, with no single racial/ethnic group constituting a majority.\n\nIt is the relative swiftness of this contextual demographic change that in the near future-ready or not-will require psychology to undergo radical and rapid change in the direction of dramatically increasing its representation of people of color, and its focus on issues of special import to communities of color. The APA Commission on Ethnic Minority Recruitment, Retention, and Training in Psychology believes that psychology has sufficient resources and resourcefulness to ensure that this change will not be chaotic, disorientating, and threatening, but instead will occur in a planned thoughtful manner that will serve to strengthen and enrich psychology in the 21st Century. To this end, the Commission presents its Final Report.\n\nCEMRRAT was established to address issues related to the recruitment and retention and graduation of ethnic minority students and faculty, as well as issues related to curriculum and education and training. Not only are these areas of concern interdependent, but demographic data confirm dramatic underrepresentation in each area.\n\nThe psychology pipeline. Compared to their representation in the U. S. population, ethnic minorities are substantially underrepresented at all levels of the educational pipeline that lead to the doctoral degree in psychology. Figure 2 illustrates the increasing narrowing of this pipeline as the numbers of ethnic minorities become less and less, until the numbers are a bare trickle. Here are the dramatic figures that document this serious state of affairs.\n\nEthnic minority students continue to graduate from high school at a lower rate than White students. Also, despite an initial trend for ethnic minorities to show increasing numbers who graduate, decreases have occurred in recent years. Thus, even at the start of the educational pipeline, a major constriction is occurring.\n\nAccording to U. S. Census 1996 Current Population Survey data as reported by the American Council on Education (1995, Table 1), high school completion rates among 18- to 24-year old youth during the 20-year period of 1973 to 1993 demonstrated the patterns depicted in Figure 3. 6\n\nAmong Whites, rates remained stable during the 20-year period at approximately 83%.\n\nAmong African Americans, rates showed a moderate increase from 66.8% in 1973 to a high of 77.0% in 1990 and then declined to 74.8% by 1993.\n\nAmong Hispanics/Latino(a)s, rates fluctuated greatly, ranging from 55.2% in 1973, reaching a peak of 62.9% in 1985, declining to a low of 52.0% in 1991, and increasing again to 60.7% in 1993.\n\nRegardless of race/ethnicity, women exhibit higher rates of high school completion than men. In 1993, this gender gap was 5 percentage points for Hispanics, 3.9 percentage points for African Americans and 3.2 percentage points for Whites.\n\nCollege enrollment. Ethnic minority student representation among persons enrolled in college is almost the same as their representation in the general population. Indeed, during the period of 1982 to 1993, ethnic minority student college enrollment increased by nearly 58% (American Council on Education [ACE], 1995, p. 13). This increase is due mainly to the enrollment of women and older students. Figure 4 (on page 24) illustrates the changes in college enrollments across time.\n\nThe following racial/ethnic college enrollment trends existed during the period 1976 to 1993 (ACE, 1995, Table 5; National Center for Education Statistics [NCES], 1995, Table 201).\n\nThe proportional representation of Non-Hispanic Whites in the nation's colleges steadily declined from 82.2% in 1976 to 73.9% in 1993, despite a 17.6% increase in their numbers on college campuses.\n\nAfrican Americans's proportional representation increased minimally from 10.0% in 1976 to 10.5% in 1993, despite a 36.6% increase in their numbers in college.\n\nHispanics/Latino(a)s increased their proportional representation at colleges from 3.8% in 1976 to 7.4% in 1993, while increasing their numbers 160.1%.\n\nAsian Americans increased their proportional representation from 1.8% in 1976 to 5.1% in 1993, while increasing their numbers by 274.4%.\n\nAmerican Indians increased their proportional representation from 0.7% in 1976 to 0.9% in 1993, while increasing their numbers by 61.7%.\n\nSuch trends are continuing. In 1993, students of color comprised 23.9% of the nation's undergraduate enrollment; non-Hispanic Whites comprised 73.9%, and nonresident aliens comprised the remaining 2.2%. The number of students enrolled in undergraduate studies continues to increase for each of the four major ethnic minority groups. But in 1992, for the first time in recent history, the number of non-Hispanic White college students decreased. The enrollment of these students declined from 9.5 million in 1991 to 9.1 million in 1993-that is, a 4.2% decline during a 2-year period.\n\nCompleting the bachelor's degree. The pool of baccalaureate degree graduates is the primary supplier of graduate students for psychology. But it is at this level of the pipeline that one begins to see significant underrepresentation of people of color. During the period of 1976 to 1993, the following racial/ethnic trends depicted in Figure 5 existed for completion of the bachelor's degree in psychology (Commission of Professionals in Science and Technology [CPST], 1994, Table 2-31; Kohout & Pion, 1990, Table 6; NCES, 1995, Table 257).\n\nIn 1975/76, ethnic minority recipients of the bachelor's degree in psychology numbered 5,691 and comprised 11.5% of all such recipients (N = 49,486). In 1992/93, ethnic minority recipients of such degrees numbered 10,842 and comprised 16.2% of all such recipients (N = 66,728).\n\nAfrican Americans' proportional representation varied during the 1976-1993 period-increasing from 6.5% of the bachelor's degrees awarded in psychology in 1976 to 8.1% in 1981, thereafter declining to 5.8% in 1989 and then increasing to 7.1% in 1993.\n\nHispanics/Latino(a)s' proportionate representation among persons granted the bachelor's degree in psychology has slightly increased from 3.4% in 1976 to 4.8% in 1993.\n\nAsian Americans' representation, although small, has more than tripled-increasing from 1.2% in 1976 to 3.9% in 1993.\n\nNative Americans' representation remained for all practical purposes unchanged during the 1976-1993 period at approximately 0.5%, while their numbers nearly doubled from 192 in 1976 to 344 in 1993.\n\nEnrolling in graduate or professional school in psychology. The next constriction in the pipeline involves enrollment in graduate or professional studies in psychology. Related full-time graduate enrollment trends during the period 1981 to 1992 follow (CPST, 1994, Tables 1-36, 1-37, 1-40; National Science Foundation [NSF], 1994, Appendix Tables 6-14 through 6-18). Also, see Figure 6 on page 25.\n\nThe proportional representation of African American full-time graduate students in psychology increased from 3.8% in 1981 to 5.3% in 1992, while their numbers increased from 983 to 1,681. In 1991, approximately 23% (or 333) of these students were enrolled at Historically Black Colleges and Universities.\n\nHispanic\\Latina(o) representation increased from 3.7% in 1981 to 5.2% in 1992, and their numbers increased from 955 to 1,642.\n\nAsian American representation increased from 1.3% in 1981 to 3.0% in 1992, that is from 328 to 952.\n\nAmerican Indian representation increased from 0.2% in 1981 to 0.7% in 1992, while their numbers increased from 49 to 208.\n\nIn 1992, 13.6% of all (full-time and part-time) graduate students in psychology were persons of color as were 14.2% of all full-time graduate students in psychology.\n\nCompleting the master's degree. After their enrollment in graduate school, a smaller number of students of color complete the master's degree in psychology. Hence, there is one more constriction in the pipeline. Related trends for the period 1975/76 to 1992/93 are noted in Figures 7 and 8 below (CPST, 1994, Table 2-30; Kohout & Pion, 1990, Table 6; NCES, 1995, Tables 244 & 260).\n\nIn 1975/76, ethnic minority recipients of the master's degree in psychology numbered 727 and comprised 9.5% of all recipients of such degrees (N = 7,613). In 1992/93, ethnic minority recipients of the master's degree in psychology numbered 1,267 and comprised 11.6% of all recipients of such degrees (N = 10,957).\n\nFrom 1976 to 1993, the proportional representation of African Americans completing this degree remained relatively constant, varying from 5.5% in 1976 to 4.8% in 1989, and then increasing to 5.3% in 1993.\n\nHispanic/Latina(o) representation increased from 2.7% in 1976 to 3.9% in 1993.\n\nAsian American representation increased from 1.2% in 1976 to 1.9% in 1993.\n\nAmerican Indian representation increased from 0.2% in 1976 to 0.6% in 1993.\n\nCompleting the doctoral degree. At this end of the educational pipeline, the picture is that of very small numbers of persons of color. This small number of ethnic minority doctoral graduates from U. S. institutions foretells a severe limitation on the racial/cultural diversity of the pool of academicians, service providers, and scientists in psychology. The related racial/ethnic trends during the period of 1975 to 1992/93 are noted below and in Figures 9 and 10 on pages 26 and 27(CPST, 1994, Tables 2-4, 2-5, 2-9, 2-10, 2-11, 9-1; NCES, 1995, Tables 263 and 245).\n\nBetween 1976 and 1993, a total of 3,833 ethnic minorities were awarded a doctorate in psychology, representing 7.6% of all such doctorates awarded (N = 50,763) during that period.\n\nIn 1976, ethnic minority recipients of doctorates in psychology numbered 134 and comprised 4.2% of all recipients (N = 3,157) of such degrees. That same year, 430 non-U. S. citizens received doctorates in psychology from U. S. institutions and comprised 13.6% of all such recipients. In 1993, ethnic minority recipients of doctorates in psychology numbered 344 and comprised 9.4% of all recipients of such degrees (N = 3,651). That same year, 182 nonresident aliens received doctorates in psychology and comprised 5.0% of all such recipients. See Figure 10 on page 27.\n\nBetween 1976 and 1993, the proportional representation of African American recipients of doctorates in psychology varied minimally. In 1976, 86 African Americans received a doctorate in psychology. In that year, these persons represented 2.7% of all recipients of doctorates in psychology and 7.9% of all African American 1976 recipients of a doctorate degree in any field. In 1993, 134 African Americans received a doctorate in psychology, representing 3.7% of all such recipients and 9.9% of all African American 1993 recipients of doctorates in any field. (In comparison, non-Hispanic White 1993 psychology doctorate recipients comprised 11.7% of all same race 1993 recipients of a doctorate in any field.)\n\nHispanic/Latino(a) doctorate recipients steadily increased their number and proportional representation. In 1976, 27 Hispanics/Latino(a)s were awarded a doctorate in psychology (representing 0.9% of such recipients and 7.9% of all Hispanic/Latina(o) 1976 recipients of a doctorate in any field). In 1993, 125 Hispanic/Latino(a)s received a doctorate in psychology (representing 3.4% of all such recipients and 15.1% of all Hispanic/Latino(a) 1993 recipients of a doctorate in any field).\n\nAsian American doctorate recipients also increased their numbers and proportional representation. In 1976, 17 Asian Americans received a doctorate in psychology (representing 0.5% of all such recipients and 5.1% of all Asian American 1976 recipients of a doctorate in any field). In 1993, 63 Asian Americans received a doctorate in psychology (representing 1.7% of all such recipients and 4.0% of all Asian American 1993 recipients of a doctorate in any field).\n\nIn 1976, 4 American Indians received a doctorate in psychology (representing 0.01% of all such recipients and 10.0% of all American Indian 1976 recipients of a doctorate in any field). In 1993, 22 American Indians received a doctorate in psychology (representing 0.6% of all such recipients and 20.8% of all American Indian 1993 recipients of a doctorate in any field).\n\nEntering the faculty workforce. When all psychologists in the workforce are examined, it becomes clear that ethnic minorities comprise an extremely small percent. And when those who are identified as \"academicians\" are counted, the number becomes even smaller. Approximately 5,000 of the nation's doctoral psychologists are persons of color. Persons of color constitute 5.1% (N = 3,763) of APA's membership (APA Research Office, 1994b). Among APA's members of color, 16.8% identify their primary role as \"academician\" (APA Ethnicity, Race, and Cultural Affairs Portfolio, 1994), and only about 10% of new ethnic minority doctorates are likely to become faculty (Russo, Olmedo, Stapp, and Fulcher, 1981).\n\nThe following were other trends in the representation of ethnic minorities on psychology faculties during the period 1984 to 1993 (APA Research Office, 1994(a), 1995; NCES, 1995, Table 222).\n\nThe proportional representation of ethnic minorities in full-time faculty positions in U.S. graduate departments of psychology barely increased from 6.6% in 1984 to 8.0% in 1993. In that same year, 9.0% of full-time faculty in U.S. undergraduate departments of psychology were ethnic minorities. Among such institutions, 2-year colleges demonstrated the highest ethnic minority full-time psychology faculty representation with 13%.\n\nAmong graduate psychology faculty in health service provider subfields, 10.3% of faculty are ethnic minorities; but in non-health service provider subfields (i. e., scientific areas of psychology), only 6.8% of faculty are ethnic minorities.\n\nThe representation of full-time African American faculty in graduate psychology departments remained virtually unchanged at 3% during the 1984-1993 period. Among full-time undergraduate psychology faculty, African American representation was 4% in 1993.\n\nRepresentation of Hispanics/Latino(a)s as full-time graduate faculty increased from 1% in 1984 to 2% in 1993. Also in that year, Hispanics/Latino(a)s comprised 2% of full-time undergraduate psychology faculty.\n\nAsian Americans' full-time graduate faculty representation increased from 1% in 1984 to 2% in 1993. In that year, Asian Americans also comprised 2% of full-time undergraduate faculty in psychology.\n\nThroughout the 1984-1993 period, in both graduate and undergraduate faculties of psychology, American Indian representation was less than 1%.\n\nOther pipeline characteristics. Not only is the representation of ethnic minority students increasingly reduced at each level of the psychology educational pipeline, but their educational choice patterns do not follow traditional directions.\n\nStudents of color are more likely than others to attend community colleges. In 1991, 46.8% of all students of color engaged in postsecondary education were enrolled in community colleges (compared to 38.2% of White students). At community colleges, ethnic minorities comprised 24.4% of enrollments in 1991 (CPST, 1994, Table 1-28).\n\nStudents of color are more likely than others to attend minority colleges (i.e., Historically or Predominantly Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-Serving Institutions, and Tribal Colleges). In 1991, minority institutions awarded nearly 29% of all baccalaureate degrees granted to African Americans, and 19% of all baccalaureates awarded to Hispanic/Latino(a)s (American Council of Education, 1993).\n\nProducing the multicultural curriculum. Ethnic minority curriculum content attracts students interested in diversity and helps all students attain some minimal level of multicultural competence. Faculty interested in diversity are needed to formulate ethnic minority curricula. With the constricted pipeline of students and faculty, it is not surprising to discover that ethnic minority curricula development and research efforts also have been limited. Although some studies do offer some insights with one replication offering some trend information, the relative paucity of information on ethnic minority curricula makes a study of related trends difficult. Moreover, the multicultural curriculum research that has been reported has focused almost exclusively on health provider programs (i.e., clinical, counseling, and school psychology), with almost no existing research on multicultural curricular and pedagogical issues in scientific psychology programs. Some of the major existing findings related to multicultural curricula in clinical, counseling, and school psychology are noted below and in Figure 11 on page 27.\n\nIn 1982, the report of an APA survey indicated that only 4.3% of U.S. departments of psychology (17 of 398 responding departments) required a course or practicum training on psychological assessment of ethnic minorities, and 9.5% had an elective multicultural assessment course or practicum (APA, 1982).\n\nBernal and Padilla (1982) conducted a survey in 1980 of multicultural training in APA accredited doctoral clinical psychology programs. And approximately 10 years later in 1990, a followup of this survey was conducted (Bernal and Castro, 1994). Some of the changes suggested by comparing findings of the two surveys are as follow.\n\n1) The percentage of programs offering minority content courses increased from 41% (or 31) to 62% (or 64) of the responding programs.\n\n2) The number of minority content courses offered by the 76 programs surveyed in 1980 and the 104 programs surveyed in 1990 increased from 57 to 138.\n\n3) The percentage of programs requiring any minority-focused course increased from 9% (or 7) to 26% (or 24) of the responding programs. Thus the 1990 survey suggests that 74% of programs do not require even one minority course for the doctoral degree.\n\n4) The 1990 survey findings suggest that off-campus clinical settings serving ethnic minority populations were not fully utilized by the programs as practicum sites; 40% of programs still do not use such settings.\n\n5) Faculty mentors on multicultural issues are few: According to the 1990 survey, 47% of programs have no clinical faculty conducting ethnic minority mental health research; 54% have no faculty coordinating ethnic minority student training.\n\n6) According to the 1990 survey, minority-focused courses are still minimally available: 39% (n = 41) of the surveyed programs had no minority course in the program or department; 35% (n = 36) had one course; 14% (n = 15) had two courses; 6% (n = 6) had 3 or 4 courses; 3% (n = 3) had 5 or 6 courses; 3% (n = 3) had 9 or 10 courses.\n\nIn 1990/91, Quintana and Bernal (1995) surveyed all accredited training programs in counseling psychology and compared their findings to those on clinical psychology programs as reported by Bernal and Castro (1994). This comparison suggests that the 41 (out of 61) counseling programs who completed the survey had made more progress in diversifying their curriculum than had clinical programs. Nevertheless, as the study's following major findings suggest, the majority of accredited counseling programs do not require a single course related to ethnic minority issues:\n\n1) 87.8% (n = 36) of the accredited counseling psychology programs offered minority-focused content courses.\n\n2) 41.5% (n = 17) of programs required a course focused on ethnic minority issues, leaving 58.5% of programs that did not have such a requirement.\n\n3) Community settings serving ethnic minority populations were used as practicum sites by 65.8% of programs (n = 27).\n\n4) Ethnic minority faculty were few: 41.5% of programs had no ethnic minority faculty; 48% had no faculty conducting research on ethnic minority issues.\n\nPonterotto (1996) surveyed both accredited and nonaccredited programs in counseling psychology. Compared to accredited counseling programs, this group of accredited and nonaccredited programs were more likely to require a minority-focused course and less likely to use practicum sites serving ethnic minority populations.\n\n1) 89% of the programs (n = 59) required a minority-focused course.\n\n2) Off-campus settings serving ethnic minority populations were used as practicum sites by 35% of the programs (N = 23).\n\nRogers, Ponterotto, Conoley, and Wiese (1992) surveyed multicultural training in 121 school psychology programs offering doctoral, master's, and specialist degrees. Their major findings included the following:\n\n1) One or more minority-focused courses was offered by 60% (N = 72) of surveyed programs, with 40% (N = 48) of the programs offering no courses.\n\n2) At least one course focused on ethnic minority issues was required by 45% of the programs (N = 55).\n\n3) Student exposure to ethnic minority clients was reported by 69% of the programs (N = 83); however, in nearly one-third of these programs, students spent only 0% to 5% of their time with ethnic minority clients.\n\nSummary and conclusions. Demographic data suggest a dramatic change in the racial and ethnic composition of our nation's population. From being \"minorities,\" persons of color will rapidly become the majority population. A number of reasons exist for seeking improvements of ethnic minority representation in psychology's educational pipeline, in the profession of psychology, and in the psychology curriculum. Expanding the educational pipeline would guarantee that a major segment of our youth would receive the training all students deserve to receive. Increasing the numbers of students of color in graduate programs in psychology would increase the availability of the numbers of faculty, research scholars, and service providers needed to close the \"underrepresented\" and \"underserved\" gap between the current limited psychological personnel of color and the needs of rapidly growing ethnic minority populations. Increasing the coverage of ethnic minority topics in the curriculum would strengthen psychology's stature in the 21st Century by promoting its investigation and acquisition of substantive knowledge about the behavior of diverse populations and by supporting that kind of training necessary for ensuring all future psychologists are culturally competent as scientists, educators, administrators, and practitioners.\n\nThe current status of ethnic minorities in psychology is grim. Despite increases in some areas, the total profile is that of a pipeline that has major constrictions at every level. Already, the numbers of qualified psychological scientists and professionals have failed to keep pace with what would be expected from the increased growth of the nation's ethnic minority populations. Without commitments to innovative actions, the current crises will become an irreversible catastrophe.\n\n____________________\n\n6 Comparable data are not available for American Indians and Asian Americans.\n\nThe APA Commission on Ethnic Minority Recruitment, Retention, and Training in Psychology (CEMRRAT), a 15-member advisory and governance group, was established by the APA Board of Directors in 1994. The Commission was charged to explore and develop mechanisms that will significantly improve the recruitment, retention and graduation, and education and training of ethnic minorities in psychology.\n\nNominations for membership on the Commission were widely and nationally solicited. The Commission members and its chair (Richard M. Suinn, PhD, of Colorado State University) were appointed by APA President Ronald Fox, PhD, after nominations were screened by the APA Central Office Work Group (COWG) on Ethnic Minority Recruitment and Retention. COWG is composed of staff representatives of all the APA directorates as well as APA's Research Office, Minority Fellowship Program, Public Communications Office, and Public Policy Office. This group, which meets 2 to 4 times per year, seeks to ensure that ethnic minority recruitment and retention efforts are coordinated and integrated throughout APA.\n\nIn 1994, CEMRRAT was awarded $8,000 from the APA Board of Directors Contingency Fund. In 1995, CEMRRAT received $27,400 from the APA Council of Representatives Contingency Fund. Later that year, the APA Board of Directors extended CEMRRAT's tenure to December 1996 and awarded CEMRRAT an additional $4,700 from the Board's 1995 Contingency Fund to support initial product development efforts. The board also authorized the addition of $18,700 to the OEMA 1996 budget for costs associated with convening one meeting of the full Commission and one meeting of CEMRRAT's Executive Board in 1996. In addition, CEMRRAT also received contract funds (#92-MF-01645701D) in the amount of $6,800 from the Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Agency (SAMHSA) that were used to help fund CEMRRAT's 1994 and 1995 meetings.\n\nAt its first meeting, the Commission reviewed existing data and reports on ethnic minority recruitment, retention and graduation, and education and training in psychology. Based on this review, the Commission defined its focus and the framework of the methodology and approach to its work. The review effort indicated a need for CEMRRAT to take actions that would have some immediate impact. Prior efforts to facilitate the progress of ethnic minorities in psychology illustrate the history of extremely slow changes that have been effected to date. As an initial commitment, therefore, the members of the Commission agreed to focus on the short-term goal of developing products that could have some immediate impact on the pipeline and curriculum and to engage in long-term strategic planning needed for continued activities required to monitor, maintain, and press forward changes in systemic problems of ethnic minority recruitment, retention, and training.\n\nTo achieve its goals, Commission members and liaisons (i.e., designated representatives of interested groups and agencies who attended CEMRRAT's meetings) were divided into three work groups: Education and Training, Faculty Recruitment and Retention, and Student Recruitment and Retention, chaired respectively by Drs. Ena Vazquez-Nuttall, Martha Bernal, and Hector Myers.\n\nThe Commission's methodology and approach to its goals were guided by formal statements and covenants developed by the Commission related to: (a) The CEMRRAT Charge, (b) Definitions of Subject Areas, (c) Goals and Objectives, and (d) Operating Principles. (A copy of each of these is provided in this report's Appendix A.) Major tenets of CEMRRAT's Operating Principles included:\n\nSummarize existing knowledge that pertains to ethnic minority recruitment, retention, and training and make it available to the general public.\n\nInvolve many specialists with diverse expertise.\n\nKeep the APA membership informed about the Commission's activities and progress.\n\nWork with other organizations.\n\nDisseminate information and products developed by the Commission.\n\nInfluence legislation and pubic policy related to ethnic minority recruitment, retention, and training issues.\n\nClarify implications for research and program evaluation.\n\nThe following is a summary of the Commission's activities and accomplishments.\n\n1. Established in October 1994 for an 18-month term (i.e., through May 1996) by the APA Board of Directors with members appointed by APA President Ronald A. Fox, PhD. CEMRRAT's tenure was later extended through December 1996 by the APA Board of Directors.\n\n2. Conducted four full Commission meetings (December 9-11, 1994; May 12-14, 1995; October 27-29, 1995; June 28-30, 1996) and one Executive Meeting (February 16-18, 1996) in Washington, DC. Copies of the agenda books for the meetings were widely disseminated, as were the minutes of the meetings.\n\n3. Organized itself into three working groups: (a) Education and Training, chaired by Ena Vazquez-Nuttall, EdD; (b) Faculty Recruitment and Retention, chaired by Martha Bernal, PhD; (c) Student Recruitment and Retention, chaired by Hector Myers, PhD.\n\n4. Developed formal statements of its goals and work plans , with short-term and long-term objectives, that served to guide the efforts and progress assessments of each working group.\n\n5. Established mechanisms for ensuring broad-based participation, comment, and support , including a primary network of 18 liaisons, 8 monitors, 39-member panel of experts, and a 14-member Central Office work group.\n\n6. Developed a corporate grantsmanship strategy and submitted pre-proposal letters to over 25 private and corporate foundations.\n\n7. Established a grants subcommittee to develop a federal funding strategy. Under the leadership of the Science Directorate, initiated coordinated efforts with other behavioral and social sciences professional associations and societies for developing a multidisciplinary federal grant proposal on ethnic minority recruitment and retention.\n\n8. Requested 1996 funding from the Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) to help defray some of CEMRRAT's 1996 printing and dissemination costs.\n\n9. Secured a $60,000 HBCU grant award to APA's Ethnicity, Race, and Cultural Affairs Portfolio (OEMA) from CMHS \"to strengthen the institutional capacities of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to recruit, retain and graduate, and train students of color for careers in psychology.\" Other grant applications to expand this initiative have been submitted and await a funding decision. In June 1996, a first cohort of small grants totaling approximately $43,000 was awarded to:\n\nMorehouse College in Atlanta, GA, for implementing activities that will strengthen psychology research training opportunities for high school and undergraduate students (Principal Investigator: Jann Adams, PhD).\n\nJohnson C. Smith University in Charlotte, NC, for implementing activities that will strengthen the department's capacity to mentor students for research and professional development-beginning with their freshman year (Principal Investigators: Ruth Greene, PhD, and Michael Kidda, PhD).\n\nFisk University in Nashville, TN for implementing a psychology honors program (Principal Investigator: Donna J. Rawls, PhD).\n\n10. Assisted OEMA to successfully secure a 3-year grant (9/96-9/99) for $750,000 in direct costs from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) on \"Developing Ethnic Minority Talent in Psychology.\" Funds will be used to create five Regional Centers of Excellence in the Recruitment, Retention, and Training of Ethnic Minority Students. Each center will be composed of a major research institution and two predominantly minority institutions. Grants to the participating institutions will total over $500,000. It is anticipated the products derived from project efforts will be of national significance and appropriate for use by other biomedical disciplines.\n\n11. Encouraged the APA Public Communications Office to develop a comprehensive three-phase Media Plan for the Commission , resulting to date in the publication of nearly two dozen articles on CEMRRAT in newspapers and newsletters across the nation and broad dissemination of information in psychology news and media outlets.\n\n12. Established a collaborative relationship with APA's Committee on Accreditation (CoA) that involved CEMRRAT in conjunction with APA's Division 45 (Society for the Psychological Study of Ethnic Minority Issues) in designing a module on \"ethnic diversity\" for APA accreditation site visitor training. More recently, CoA has agreed to include in its Site Visitor Workbook the statement, \"Suggested questions and factors site visitors should consider when assessing degree of compliance with Domain D: Cultural and individual differences and diversity,\" which was developed by CEMRRAT's Education and Training Work Group.\n\n13. Reviewed accreditation standards and recommended to CoA ways for ensuring compliance with standards affecting multicultural practice including: expanding the pool of site visitors of color, requiring that one member of each accreditation team be knowledgeable in multicultural issues; and encouraging programs and intern sites to ensure that students obtain field work experience with multicultural clients and take at least one course in multicultural issues.\n\n14. Conducted a mail survey of all APA accredited programs and internship sites (with the assistance of APA's Research Office) for the purpose of identifying those APA members with expertise in multicultural issues and interest in serving as an accreditation site visitor or program consultant on multicultural issues. Approximately 400 completed surveys were returned. Data from these surveys will be statistically analyzed.\n\n15. Conducted a survey of programs to identify multicultural resource materials used in core graduate psychology courses.\n\n16. Established collaborative relationships with the Council of Graduate Departments of Psychology (COGDOP) and the National Council of Schools and Programs of Professional Psychology (NCSPP) , both of which sent liaisons to CEMRRAT's meetings. In 1995, CEMRRAT provided an invited presentation at COGDOP's annual meeting. In 1996, CEMRRAT provided invited presentations at the annual meetings of both COGDOP and NCSPP.\n\n17. Participated in the 1995 annual meetings of those State Psychological Associations with the largest numbers of members and populations of color (i. e., CA, FL, TX) in order to describe CEMRRAT's goals and objectives and solicit state association involvement.\n\n18. Participated in the 1995 Division Leadership Conference.\n\n19. Provided articles on CEMRRAT's activities to all APA directorate newsletters.\n\n20. Presented information on CEMRRAT at the American Council on Education's \"Fifth Annual Educating One-Third of a Nation Conference\" in 1995.\n\n21. Developed or participated in six events at the 1995 APA Convention:\n\nOpen Forum I: CEMRRAT Update\n\nOpen Forum II: Ethnic Minority Faculty Recruitment\n\nSymposium: Multicultural Curriculum Development\n\nConversation Hour: Links and Shoulders (with Division 45; about mentoring)\n\nParticipated in the CEMA Breakfast for Presidents of State Associations and Chairpersons of State and Division Committees on Ethnic Minority Affairs at which CEMRRAT members were invited speakers on the topic of \"How state associations and divisions can support ethnic minority recruitment, retention, and training efforts\".\n\nParticipated as mentors/speakers in the Psi Beta Diversity Project 2000 Summer Institute Project-a mentoring project for students of color in community colleges interested in pursuing careers in psychology.\n\n22. Developed two events for the 1996 APA Convention:\n\nSymposium: Model Multicultural Training Programs in Psychology\n\nSymposium: Implementing Multicultural Issues: The Role of Accreditation and Licensing Boards\n\n23. Provided diversity consultation/technical assistance to the University of Rhode Island.\n\n24. Urged that APA's $1 million/year public education campaign include messages targeted to communities of color.\n\n25. Reviewed and commented on the initial draft of the APA publication Careers in Psychology.\n\n26. Developed a listing of postdoctoral opportunities for persons of color , which was forwarded to APA's Education Directorate.\n\n27. Supported efforts by the APA Membership Services Office and Membership Committee to develop targeted strategies for recruiting and retaining members of color in APA.\n\n28. Developed initial or final drafts of the following publications: 7\n\nCommissioners' professional biographies . This 150+ page book was prepared by the Ethnicity, Race, and Cultural Affairs Portfolio (ERCA) and issued in November 1994.\n\nResource book on ethnic minority recruitment, retention, and training in psychology .

Publication is expected to occur in 1997, with expected dissemination to psychology programs, CoA, textbook publishers, and others.\n\n____________________\n\n7 The commission on Ethnic Minority Recruitment, Retention, and Training in Psychology is committed to developing products that will be actively used by psychologists involved in teaching, research, and practice and by others throughout the nation's academic communities. Consequently, the Commission sought rigorous and broad comment on, and engaged in repeated revision of its draft products. This included conducting symposia of the annual meeting of the American Psychological Association, where Commission members described the rationale for various products and handed out hundreds of draft copies of products with comment sheets. Based on these comments, draft products were revised and placed on the meeting agendas of all APA governance boards and committees with a request for comment. At APA's semiannual consolidated governance meetings, conference committees were conducted at which representatives for interested governance groups provided comment from their various groups. Comments also were solicited conference committees were conducted at which representatives from interested governance groups provided comment from their various groups. Comments also were solicited from the Commission's monitors and panels of experts. Soliciting and receiving thoughtful comment is a cumbersome and time consuming process. The commission wishes to acknowledge the critical role that APA's staff liaisons to the various governance groups played in ensuring that this process proceeded in an efficient and timely manner.\n\nAmerican Council on Education.

Review and synthesize existing data regarding ethnic minority recruitment, retention and graduation, and education and training in psychology.\n\n2. Describe the components that impact successful ethnic minority recruitment, 1 retention, and training for psychology.\n\n3. Explore the nature of barriers and obstacles that prohibit significant ethnic minority recruitment, retention, and training in psychology.\n\n4. Recommend the development and implementation of innovative ethnic minority recruitment, retention, and education and training models.\n\n5. Define the role(s) of organized psychology in influencing ethnic minority recruitment and retention and encouraging multicultural education and training.\n\n6. Develop a five-year plan of action for APA addressing ethnic minority recruitment, retention, and training.\n\nThis charge was approved by the CEMRRAT on October 27, 1995.\n\nAPA Commission on Ethnic Minority Recruitment, Retention,\n\nand Training in Psychology\n\nDEFINITIONS OF SUBJECT AREAS\n\nThe APA Commission on Ethnic Minority Recruitment, Retention, and Training in Psychology (CEMRRAT) on December 9, 1994, revised and approved the following definitions of subject areas:\n\nRecruitment : Involves information/strategies focusing on improving the representation of ethnic minorities (students, faculty, etc.) in psychology.\n\nRetention and Graduation : Involves information/strategies focusing on retaining and graduating ethnic minority students at all levels of the education pipeline, keeping ethnic minorities (be they student, faculty, or professional) in the discipline (includes, but not limited to mentoring; professional, emotional, and financial support; acknowledgement of contributions; and solicited meaningful participation).\n\nEducation and Training : Involves strategies/curriculum focused on improving cultural and ethnic diversity in course content and practicum experiences, and expanding the theoretical, methodological and knowledge base of the science of psychology by modeling and otherwise encouraging the formulation and investigation of research questions on ethnic minority issues; also, involves information/strategies to educate and train psychologists to work with and on behalf of culturally and ethnically diverse populations, whether in an educational, research, or practice framework.\n\nAPA Commission on Ethnic Minority Recruitment, Retention,\n\nand Training in Psychology\n\nGOALS AND OBJECTIVES\n\nPrepared by Richard M. Suinn, PhD, Chairperson, CEMRRAT, and approved by CEMRRAT on May 12, 1995.\n\nThree events led to the appointment of the APA Commission on Ethnic Minority Recruitment, Retention, and Training in Psychology (CEMRRAT):\n\nApproval by the APA Council of Representatives of the Board of Educational Affairs (BEA) Resolution stating that:\n\nAPA places a high priority on issues related to the education of ethnic minorities (including) planning appropriately diverse curricula, promoting psychology as a course of study and career option as well as recruitment, retention, advising, and mentoring of minority students at all levels of education.\n\nAllocation of funds by the APA Board of Directors from its contingency fund to support the Commission.\n\nAssignment of funds from the Center for Mental Health Services' (CMHS) Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to APA's Ethnicity, Race, and Cultural Affairs Portfolio (ERCA) for a major initiative appropriate to the Commission.\n\nFrom the initial charge to the Commission, and directly relevant to the Council of Representatives and BEA Resolution, the following are goals of the Commission:\n\nDevelop activities, plans, responsibilities, and target dates for achieving measurable progress and improvement of education and training of ethnic minorities. This includes consideration of the diversity within ethnic minority groups such as gender, sexual orientation, disability, and persons of mixed ethnicity/race.\n\nDevelop activities, plans, responsibilities, and timelines for achieving measurable progress on activities and products related to the recruitment, retention, and the advancement of ethnic minority faculty members.\n\nFocus energies on three primary topics: (a) recruitment, retention, and graduation of minority students, (b) recruitment and retention of ethnic of minority faculty, and (c) the broader arena of the education and training of ethnic minorities and others in psychology. Subgoals include:\n\nIncrease the numbers of ethnic minority students recruited into the academic pipeline who are retained, and who graduate. Steps might include: reaching out to raise the size of the pool of potential psychology majors; (a) making psychology a more salient career; (b) enabling students to achieve academic success and career preparation once in psychology; (c) enabling departments to be successful as joint participants in recruitment, retention and graduation, and curriculum development.\n\nIncrease the numbers of ethnic minority faculty who are recruited into and advance in academic positions. Steps might include: (a) enabling faculty candidates and departments to be successful joint collaborators in recruitment and advancement of ethnic minority members; (b) documenting the \"value-added\" of increased diversity in departments; (c) organizing career consultation and career development opportunities.\n\nStimulate the development of ethnic diversity knowledge and competencies through curricula and other published materials. Steps might include: (a) making information available on existing diversity publications such as through evaluative reviews; (b) increasing the availability of useful curriculum methods and resources; (c) organizing human resources in collaborative settings for mutual sharing and instruction.\n\nIt is the vision of the Commission members to be truly a unique body, thoroughly committed to taking ethnic minority goals \"to the next level\" by building on prior foundations, while reaching for new heights. Each member personally dedicated himself/herself to \"getting things done\" rather than again stating what we already know, of aiming at concrete planning rather than generic envisioning, and adopting action-oriented steps with a view toward products rather than further debated and empty discourse. The very term \"Commission\" has challenged us; we shall now see if we are able to meet our own high standards for ourselves.\n\nAPA Commission on Ethnic Minority Recruitment, Retention,\n\nand Training in Psychology\n\nOPERATING PRINCIPLES\n\nThe APA Commission on Ethnic Minority Recruitment, Retention, and Training in Psychology (CEMRRAT), on October 27, 1995, reviewed and approved its operating principles to read as follows.\n\nSummarize existing knowledge that pertains to ethnic minority recruitment, retention and graduation, and education and training and make it available to the general public. CEMRRAT will utilize as its operating definition of ethnic minorities: African American/Black, Asian American/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Hispanic/Latino(a). This definition involves consideration and sensitivity to the diversity within ethnic minority groups to include but not limit to gender, sexual orientation, disability, and those of mixed ethnicity/race.\n\nInvolve many specialists with diverse expertise in the Commission's work.\n\nKeep the APA membership informed about the Commission's activities and progress; systematically use APA organizational media to communicate with members.\n\nWork with other organizations. Particular attention should be given to APA affiliated and non-APA affiliated academic and professional organizations such as: State and Regional Psychological Associations, APA Divisions and Governance Groups, the American Psychological Association of Graduate Students, Teachers of Psychology in Secondary Schools, Council of Graduate Departments of Psychology, National Education Association, National Council of Schools and Programs of Professional Psychology, Association of Postdoctoral and Internship Centers, the national ethnic minority psychological associations (AAPA, ABPsi, NHPA, SIP), etc. Develop collaborative and cooperating relationships with these and other organizations whose work is germane to ethnic minority recruitment, retention and graduation, and education and training.\n\nDisseminate information and products developed by the Commission. Make systematic use of professional and public print and electronic media, organizational linkages, and public education strategies.\n\nInfluence legislation and public policy related to ethnic minority recruitment, retention, and training issues. Work with public officials and with grassroots networks.\n\nClarify implications for research and program evaluation. Involve appropriate expertise so that findings are interpreted appropriately for use by psychological educators, researchers, and service providers. Encourage evaluation of initiatives; ensure that all summary and review findings include implications for both action and research.\n\n____________________\n\n1 CEMRRAT will utilize as its operating definition of ethnic minorities: African American/Black, Asian America/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Hispanic/Latino(a).
