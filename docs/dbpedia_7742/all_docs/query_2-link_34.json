        "text": "Each and every work of art has its own essence, its own perspective and an individual concept.\n\nMoreover, it is an artist’s form of expression that they use to portray their views to their audience.\n\nBut what if I tell you that a form of art that rejects the concept of expressionism and solely gives viewers the freedom to let the art sink-in as they want?\n\nI am talking about the art of minimalism, or, as it is known in modern society, “minimalist art’.\n\nNow you may wonder What is it that makes minimalist art different from other genres of art?\n\nWell, there are a lot of aspects to it that we will unfold in this blog one after another, but first, let me tell you where this all began.\n\nThe concept of minimalism hails from the 1960s in New York, when a movement of art started uprooting, which later gained massive popularity.\n\nWith time, it came to the realization that it was a post-World War II movement that emerged in response to the subjective nature of Abstract Expressionism.\n\nThis was a brief overview of how the movement of minimalism and minimalist art came into light, so let us dive deeper and explore more of it.\n\nWhat is Minimalist Art?\n\nWould you be surprised if I told you that minimalist art is a subgenre of abstraction art but simultaneously an extreme depiction of the same concept?\n\nWell, yes, this is what minimalist art is about!\n\nAs discussed above, minimalist art hails back from the 1960s, when the United States experienced the development of a newer genre of art.\n\nThe art genre was none other than minimalism.\n\nThe component that made this art genre different was that the art enabled artists to depict complexity through simplistic shapes and hard edges.\n\nSurprisingly, it also exposed all the forms and materials used in the creation.\n\nMinimalist art challenged and changed the critics’ perception of what art is and what art can be!\n\nAlso, minimalist art brought a revolution to the art world by changing the myth that art is a luxury and can only be enjoyed by the elite class.\n\nNot only that, it was closely connected to the hearts of artists, motivated them to produce art referring to itself, and fed the viewer’s imagination.\n\nMinimalism definitely brought a challenging wave of expression to the art world and was enjoyed by every class of art lovers.\n\nWhat is Minimalist Painting?\n\nNow that we have understood the concept of minimalist art and the minimalism art movement in general, it is now time to discuss its sub-genre.\n\nYes, I am talking about minimalist paintings.\n\nAs per the literal definition:\n\n“Minimalist painting is a sub-genre in contemporary painting marked by pure abstraction and a radical simplicity, which originated in the 1950s- influenced by Abstract Expressionism, Minimal and Conceptual Art- and continues up to this day.”\n\nPaintings of minimalism have a really wide range of patterns and monochromatic patterns.\n\nIn the case of minimalism paintings, you can’t really observe any concept of expression or any specific delivery of the subject.\n\nAs minimalism says, the artists have rejected the concepts of abstract expressionism.\n\nSo some of the famous Minimalist painters, are: Frank Stella, Ellsworth Kelly, Agnes Martin, etc., have created phenomenal artworks.\n\nIn their artworks, they have depicted a series of canvases with hard-edges and transitions between colors and monochromatic effects.\n\nMany of the paintings sport repetitive patterns and geometric shapes.\n\nThe transitions and patterns made their paintings look like two-dimensional spaces that directly connected with the viewers.\n\nIt also affected the art of being visible in strips, and it helped in breaking down the thought process of traditional art.\n\nOne of the best and most renowned examples of minimalist paintings are: The Marriage of Reason and Squalor II (1959) and Title Not Known (1967), both by Frank Stella.\n\nBoth paintings have one thing in common, which is the patterns of vertical and horizontal monochromatic strips that equally distribute the canvas.\n\nAlso Read: Paintings by Kandinsky\n\nCharacteristics Of Minimalist Art\n\nThe concepts of art are very simple but what makes it complex is the perception of the artist and the viewer.\n\nHereby, I will briefly share with you some of the basic characteristics of minimalist art that will help you understand the concept of minimalism in a better way.\n\nMinimalist art reduces the visual vocabulary of the viewers, that means it gives them the freedom to take in the art as the way they want to.\n\nAbsence of expressions and imitation of art themes deals in comprehensive explanation of subjects.\n\nArtworks that fall under the spectrum of minimalism has helped the art critics to plan the motives and strategies that are recurring in this art genre.\n\nFamous Minimalist Artworks and Artists\n\nThere are a lot of different artists that have worked their way into minimalist art, but not many are known.\n\nIt also traces its way back to history, when the minimalism art movement began in America.\n\nThe minimalist art movement in America was heavily influenced by earlier European movements.\n\nDuring that time, New York was hosting exhibitions featuring the works of German Bauhaus artists, Russian Constructivists, and Dutch De Stijl artists.\n\nRobert Morris, Dan Flavin, Donald Judd, and other artists were encouraged to explore new artistic horizons by these groups, who had all pioneered radical abstraction.\n\nWith this being said, here are some of the renowned artists of minimalism who set the benchmark in this genre of art with their creations.\n\n1. Yayoi Kusama\n\nOne of the renowned Japanese female artists who was famously known as the queen of polka dots.\n\nShe was famous during the era of minimalism and curated a lot of artwork that included sculptures, paintings and installations.\n\nEvery artwork that was created by her had one thing in common that was polka dots.\n\nShe was later known as the Pumpkin Lady as well.\n\nLiving her life in a mental-care facility center, she was known to reject expressionism and abstract art and was more interested in pop art.\n\nYayoi was battling with anxiety, depression and many other mental illnesses.\n\nShe was born in 1929 and is now 94 years old.\n\nSome of her famously known artworks are: Pumpkin, Dots Obsession, and No. F, Flowers, etc.\n\n2. Donald Judd\n\nAn advocate for art and artistic expression, Donald Judd was an American artist who was a renowned minimalist artist.\n\nTill early 1960s, before the idea of minimalism went mainstream, Judd worked as a but later adapted the idea of working with three-dimensional objects.\n\nJudd was widely inspired by Yayoi in-terms of his installations and also worked on the concept of balancing the artwork without proportions.\n\nNot only this, he has also extensively researched and written on some crucial topics like land preservation and engaged citizenship.\n\nUnfortunately, when the artist turned 65 years old, he died due to lymphoma.\n\nSome of his famous artworks include: Untitled (Stack), Untitled (Progression), etc.\n\n3. Frank Stella\n\nA man who was known to believe in non-representational art philosophy turned out to be one of the most famous minimalist artists of all time.\n\nFrank Stella was born in 1936 in Maschusetts and was a leading figure in the establishment of minimalist art.\n\nStarting as a contemporary artist, Stella was among the first group of artists who started rejecting the abstraction and form of expression in art.\n\nNot only in minimalism, Stella also prominently worked in modern art and color-field art styles.\n\nHis minimalist art, along with some other artworks, are now at display in some of the most prestigious museums like MoMa, Museum Folkwang, etc.\n\nSome of his renowned works are: Harran II, The Marriage of a Reason and Squalar II, Michapol I, etc.\n\n4. Ellsworth Kelly\n\nAn artist who lived a long life and was awarded one of the most prestigious awards, i.e., National Medal of Arts, was none other than Ellsworth Kelly.\n\nBorn in 1923 in New York, Kelly was a renowned minimalist artist who emphasized the concepts of line, color and form.\n\nHe was crowned one of the most important and influential postwar artists in America.\n\nHe left his art school degree in between to serve in the military, and over time, while completing his service, he became fascinated by Romanesque architecture.\n\nUnfortunately, he died in 2015, but his teachings and impact in the world of minimalist art and art in general remain influential.\n\nSome of his famous works include: Colors for a large wall, Green curve, Red Blue Green, etc.\n\n5. Agnes Martin\n\nAgnes Martin was an abstract artist and a minimalist artist who worked in the art world by taking several breaks.\n\nShe was famously known as painter of grids, as most of her artworks and paintings had one thing in common and those were lines and colors.\n\nMartin’s paintings were known to evoke the emotional states of the viewer’s mind.\n\nIn 1967, Martin gave up painting completely and moved out of New York. Soon after, she settled in Cuba and started her painting journey in 1972.\n\nShe died in 2004, when she turned 92.\n\nSome of her famous paintings include: On a clear day, Happy Holiday, etc.\n\n6. Sol LeWitt\n\nRegarded as the founder of minimal and conceptual art, Sol LeWitt was an American minimalist artist who was involved in various art movements.\n\nA visual artist who was versatile in terms of his art, whether it be wall paintings or wall installations, was praised by the art critics.\n\nHis creativity went beyond just drawings on paper to include towers, pyramids, geometric shapes, and progressions.\n\nMore than 1,000 wall paintings were curated by LeWitt.\n\nConceptually, his art was visually appealing for the viewers, and the knack for bright colors he used denoted his vibrant color palette.\n\nUnfortunately, in 2007 we lost a brilliant minimalist artist.\n\nSome of his famous artworks include: Wall Drawing #1136, Serial Project #1 ABCD, etc.\n\nAlso Read: Famous Abstract Painters\n\nEnd of Minimalist Art and Minimalism?\n\nEvery good thing comes to an end, and unfortunately this art movement that really brought a storm of change in the art world unfortunately came to a halt.\n\nDuring the late 1960s the minimalist art slowly started to fade away and also it started to evolve as the modern world started to adapt to contemporary art.\n\nIt has also helped and pushed a lot of artists to evolve and to learn to see art from a brand new perspective.\n\nEvery artist that was influenced by this art movement grew stronger with time and also embarked their journey through the end of the movement.\n\nEven though minimalist art ended in the later stages of the 1960s but it also helped to create strong foundations for art and artists that stepped in the 21st century.\n\nMinimalist art has inspired a many forms of art such as music, literature, films and many other forms of art in the 21st century.\n\nSo, here is everything about the minimalist art and its impact on the 21st century and modern world of art.\n\nSuggested Read: Contemporary Black Artists\n\nWrapping Up\n\nIt is not hard to seek inspiration as an artist; even a flying bird, still water and an absolute blank room can act as inspiration for them.\n\nAnd as it is said that art has no limits, and the perspectives remain changing as per the viewers.\n\nHenceforth, it is a fact that it all depends on the artist, the viewers and the subject of the painting.\n\nAnd this all drives its way to the concept of minimalism and how it has affected the art world in a way that it re-defined the concept of abstraction.\n\nAbstract art and minimalist art have always made the critics turn their heads and explore more of it.\n\nSo, if you want to explore the depths of such artworks then you can get your hands on them as well.\n\nYou just need to visit our page of replicas and you can order a customized handmade portrait and even the replicas of some of the renowned artworks by famous artists.\n\nAuthor’s Epilogue\n\nHey lovely readers,\n\nIf you have made your way here, then thank you so much for staying till the end!\n\nI really appreciate your curiosity to learn more about minimalist art and the effect of minimalism on art.\n\nWe try our best to provide you with the most refined and researched information.\n\nSo, if you find this blog helpful, then do leave your valuable feedback in the comments.\n\nAlso, we are active on all the leading social media platforms, so come say hi to us right there.\n\nWe also post fun content on YouTube, so don’t forget to subscribe to that as well.\n\nSee you soon, dear readers!\n\nStay hydrated and stay safe.\n\nBye Bye!\n\nFAQs"
