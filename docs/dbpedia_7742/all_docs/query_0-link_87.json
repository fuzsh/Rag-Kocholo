        "text": "Check this story: The team leader or CEO of the company has more and more tasks, pieces of information in different places, works over hours to put everything together and comes to the conclusion that they need a tool, which will help them to organize projects and teams' work more efficiently. The leader heard that Asana might help them, so s/he makes the decision that from today they will use Asana and announce it to the team. S/he figures out by themselves how to use Asana, starts to assign tasks and deadlines. The platform starts to send loads of notifications to employees' emails, who feel overwhelmed, lost and frustrated. Some people try to learn by themselves the new tool, some of the team members just avoid it at all costs. They feel that they have more work because of it not less. And why change the way they work if it worked somehow previously. Asana was supposed to help them, but it makes people more and more against it. Sounds familiar? Is it Asana's fault that it didn't work for this team? No. The process of implementation was wrong: 1. Team members didn't know WHY they should use it, WHY they need it, HOW it will help them, so they didn't have motivation to learn the tool. Because of that they perceived Asana as unnecessary additional work not a support for them. 2. The team didn't have training on how to use the tool, so they could create a similar way of collaboration in Asana. Additionally Asana has a lot of functionalities, so they felt overwhelmed with a tool, because they didn't know which of them are crucial for their work. 3. They didn't know how they could create a working environment adjusted to their needs and habits they already gave, so they didn't feel motivated to use it. Often organizations focus only on second part and organize a training for team(s) and it's an important step, however it should be the only one. When I support companies with implementation of the Asana platform, training is only one of the steps. For me the most important step is interviews with team representatives, where we discuss how they work, what projects they realize, what habits connected with time management they already have and what challenges in planning and collaboration they already have. With this information I support teams in creating efficient Asana workspace in collaboration with team members. Based on that I show the team how Asana can minimize their pains, save lots of time and help them work more efficient. Implementing Asana or other tools is like implementing a change. Because it is a process, it takes time, but it's an investment which, if implemented correctly, can save you much more time than the one you invested. Need support with Asana implementation? Contact me. Let's discuss how I can support you and your team adjust Asana to your needs. #asana #productivity #effectiveness #timemanagement #teammanagement\n\nHappy Friday-Funday, everyone!

Let me tell you, it's a drag because you're never productive. You end up just winging it, which destroys your confidence and leads to mistakes and bad decisions. I found a way out, and you can too, especially when it comes to work. The magic word that changed everything for me was organization. Think about the last time you spent hours searching for a single document. Frustrating, right? My dad once told me, \"When everything has a place, finding what you need is easy.\" I remembered this advice and started color-coding my files: red for urgent, blue for completed, and green for ongoing. Suddenly, my home workspace wasn't a mess anymore, and I could find things quickly. For work projects, I started using Trello to keep track of everything. Trust me, knowing exactly where to look saves a ton of time. Ever sit down at a messy desk and feel instantly overwhelmed? I used to, until I made a rule: if I start a work task, I finish it right away. Now, my workspace is clean, and my mind is clear. Fewer distractions mean I'm way more productive. It's doable! Just take 10 minutes at the end of each day to tidy up. We've all had those embarrassing moments. Like sending an email to the wrong person. For me, it was forgetting to follow up on an important task. To avoid these mishaps, I started using a simple to-do list app. It reminds me of deadlines, and I can check things off as I go. For complex situations with multiple projects, I use Asana. It helps keep everything organized so nothing slips through the cracks. Clear organization leads to clear communication. I started using labeled folders for each client in Google Workspace. When I need to update a project or task, all their information is right there. No more digging through documents or endless email threads! It makes my life easier and keeps everyone else happy too. For a tech savvy person, Asana and Slack have been lifesavers for me. Channels keep conversations organized, and integrations with tools like Google Drive mean I always have the documents I need at my fingertips. Being organized doesn't just make you efficient; it reduces stress and anxiety. When you know where everything is and have a clear plan for your day, you feel more in control and less overwhelmed. It's like a weight lifted off your shoulders.
