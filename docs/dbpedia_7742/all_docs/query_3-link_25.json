        "text": "Minimalism: An Art Movement\n\nThe first, wide-spread use of the word ‘minimalism’ dates back to 1960s New York. A new, boundary-pushing art movement had caught the world’s attention.\n\nThe minimalist movement was characterised by simplicity. Paintings and sculptures featured clean lines, geometric shapes, and mostly neutral colour palettes.\n\nIt was art reduced to its simplest, purest form. Nowadays, this doesn’t sound too radical. But in the 1960s, the movement marked a serious break from tradition. But, what exactly did it mean?\n\nBy cutting away unnecessary details such as subject matter, the minimalists believed that only truth was left. If this sounds a bit conceptual, it’s because it is.\n\nSo, let’s ask ourselves some basic questions to make things clearer. Can you see the beauty in simplicity? Do you believe things come into focus when they’re stripped back? For minimalists, the answer was yes! And they created art which proved it.\n\nWhere did minimalism come from?\n\nLet’s start by setting the scene.\n\nIn the 1960s, New York was ahive of artistic activity. Abstract expressionism had taken the world by storm a decade earlier. From New York, artists such as Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock were creating new forms of art.\n\nInstead of painting from life, they used intense blocks of colour or splashes of household paint to convey deep emotion. Art no longer needed to be literal or even represent something solid. It was simply a form of expression.\n\nPop Art was the next major movement to come out of New York City. Andy Warhol took everyday objects and turned them into silkscreen prints.\n\nA profound subject matter wasn’t necessary. In fact, great works of art could look like atin of soup or thepublicity photo of a recently deceased celebrity. Warhol’s work focused on mass-produced, identical-looking objects. Could they actually mean something to us?\n\nAround the same time at the start of the 60s, other artists were emerging. They’d taken note of abstract expressionism, but wanted to take it one step further. According to these artists, art didn’t even need a subject matter. In fact, true art didn’t represent anything at all.\n\nMinimalism was born.\n\nQualities of Minimalist Art\n\nMinimalism is defined by its use of simple forms. Paintings lay flat on their canvases. Solid rectangles and squares formed sculptures. Each piece was clean. The art object was reduced to its simplest form.\n\nUnlike Abstract Expressionism, minimalist pieces didn’t try to replicate anything, object or emotion. Instead, they were objects in their own right.Frank Stella, one of the early minimalists, summed up the movement in one (fittingly simple) sentence;\n\n‘What you see is what you see.’\n\nAnd, that’s it! A plain, white canvas was not an abstract depiction of a snow blizzard. It was simply a plain, white canvas. A blue sculpture wasn’t blue to make the viewer feel a certain way. It was simply coloured blue. Pieces didn’t express anything but themselves.\n\nWhat’s the point of minimalism?\n\nSo, if their pieces didn’t express anything, then what was the point?\n\nFor minimalists, getting rid of expression meant that art was reduced to its truest form. Artists were removed from the pieces they created. Emotional contexts weren’t visible. Viewers could only respond to what was there in front of them. Therefore, with everything else taken away, the art object was truly itself.\n\nFor a movement based on simplicity, it certainly feels complicated to get your head around.\n\nBut in reality, minimalists were just in search of the truth. To them, canvases and sculptures which didn’t pretend to be anything else were as truthful as art could get.\n\nMinimalist ideas rooted in art history\n\nAlthough the movement got its name in New York, the ideas behind minimalism have been around for centuries.\n\nIslamic geometric patterns\n\nTo avoid figurative paintings becoming objects of worship, geometric forms are widely used in Islamic art.\n\nFrom as far back as the ninth century, artists experimented with interlacing lines and stars.\n\nThe patterns were more than just decoration. They were believed to be a bridge into a spiritual realm. As the patterns could carry on forever, geometric forms linked to the concept of infinity and the afterlife.\n\nJapan’s Zen philosophy\n\nZen is one of the many sects of Buddhism, though its ideas have been adopted into everyday culture in Japan. In general, Zen encourages the acceptance of simplicity as a means of fulfilment.\n\nFor hundreds of years, Japanese art has embraced the use of negative space or ‘ma’. Ma is where certain areas of a canvas are left blank.\n\nHowever, these spaces are not considered to be empty. Instead, they help viewers better understand the piece as a whole. Simplicity supports understanding.\n\nWabi-sabi is another element of Japanese belief that permeated into art. For example, a simple bowl cracked and put back together references wabi-sabi ideology. It reflects the truth of life – that it is imperfect and impermanent.\n\nMinimalism: A design Movement\n\nThe art movement may have come about in the sixties, but minimalist design principals were already popular in Europe.\n\nIn the mid twentieth century, modernisation was in full force. Life had changed dramatically after the world wars. Class barriers were dissolving, and mass-production was at an all-time high.\n\nFinally, it was possible to create simple but functional objects that everyone could afford. As a result, design changed too. The minimalist aesthetic was born.\n\nMinimalist design principles are still hugely popular today. But, where did it all start?\n\nMinimalist design influences\n\nIn the twentieth century, artists, designers, and architects were coming up with new approaches to their work.\n\nHeavy decoration was going out of fashion. They favoured simpler designs so that compositions were easier to understand. The subject of their pieces was what was important.\n\nHere's a run-down of some of those movements.\n\nSwiss Design\n\nSwiss Design, or the International Typographic Style, was another mid twentieth century movement.\n\nAccording to this style, design should be as invisible as possible. What on earth could that mean?\n\nWell, the ‘content’ of work was the focus, not the designer. Like Bauhaus, it was all about conveying a message, rather than just looking nice.\n\nAs a result, the movement produced many of the readable typefaces we use today such as Helvetica. They often used white space to help the eye focus too.\n\nSwiss Design even developed graphic design grid systems. Instead of a designer organising content, a mathematical framework could. Using grids meant that information would be easier to understand for the viewer.\n\nOrder and cleanliness were key! It was all about the subject matter. Content, the true purpose of a work, was allowed to shine through.\n\nMinimalism in Scandinavian Interior Design\n\nMinimalist ideas are also key to Scandinavian design principles.\n\nScandinavian design flourished in the 1950s, much like other minimalist movements. As modernisation took place and technologies advanced, there was a growing pull towards the outdoors. Scandinavian design brought nature inside! Just think about it – all those hardwood floors, naturally-lit rooms, and floral motifs. The style we know and love today takes inspiration from the natural world.\n\nScandinavian design has a natural approach to interiors in general. How exactly? According to Scandinavian principals, any element of design which doesn't look 'natural' should be removed. Within interiors, this means creating calm, functional spaces, rather than overly-decorated ones.\n\nFunctionality is also important in Scandinavian interiors. Practical elements of a room aren’t hidden away. They’re made into design features. Clothes are displayed on simple rails and coffee tables double-up as storage. The use and aesthetic of a room are joined together.\n\nOnce more, design is reduced to its simplest form. And doesn't it look beautiful! We have a dedicated article to minimalist interiors. Take a look here!\n\nMinimalism: A lifestyle\n\nNow onto the final form of minimalism – the lifestyle!\n\nI’m sure you’re aware of minimalist stereotypes. Lifestyle gurus who throw away their belongings and live in bare, white-walled homes? This might be true of some minimalists, but certainly not all of them.\n\nMost people think that minimalism focuses on possessions, or on getting rid of them. In reality, it’s about much more than that. Adopting a minimalist lifestyle means questioning what’s really necessary to be happy.\n\nOf course, sorting through material objects is part of the process. But, our immaterial baggage is just as important to consider.\n\nSo many of us carry excess stresses, pressures, and expectations. Sometimes, we just need to let go. Minimalism helps us get back to ourselves and lead a more fulfilled life.\n\nHaving fewer belongings means we feel less overwhelmed\n\nWith so many useless belongings, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. The things we really need are harder to find and cluttered spaces are difficult to relax in.\n\nTry clearing through your belongings and see what effect it has on your wellbeing. By prioritising objects which add value to our lives, we create spaces which are calmer and more functional. If you’d like some help, take a look at our Ultimate Decluttering Guide! It contains all the tips you need for the ultimate clear out.\n\nMinimised damage to the environment\n\nIt’s important to consider the value of an object before buying it. Mostly, that gives us time to realise we don’t really need it.\n\nBy slowing down our consumption, we’re reducing our impact on the environment. It’s estimated that 50% of all pollution results from industrial and manufacturing activities. So, if we reduce the demand for new products, the environment gets a well-needed rest. We have loads of articles on sustainable living, such as our 6 Things You Can Do Today to Be More Sustainable article.\n\nMore time to do the things we love\n\nRemember, minimalism is a lifestyle, not just a decluttering method. Sorting through your life also means sorting through the things you spend your time doing.\n\nGet rid of unhealthy habits like being glued to your phone. Does spending that extra hour at the office each day make you happy, or just stressed-out? Your time is valuable! So you should spend it doing the things you love.\n\nHow to become a minimalist\n\nSo, have you decided it’s for you? Follow these simple steps to begin your journey towards a more minimalist life.\n\nBuy higher quality items\n\nLook out for high-quality options when you go shopping. That beautiful pair of trousers made from hard-wearing fabric? That solid wood shelf which would work perfectly in your study? Invest in things that will last longer and make you feel happier in the long run.\n\nGet handy\n\nA key element of minimalism is valuing the things you have. Sometimes, that means extending the life of objects you already own. If your shirt loses a button, sew another one on. Try repairing a radio before you throw it away. Not only will this save you from buying new things, it will give you a sense of fulfilment when you get the job done yourself!\n\nReview your diary\n\nIf you always have a busy schedule, then this one’s for you. So many of us spend our time doing things we don’t care about. And, time is the most valuable resource on the planet! Take a look at your diary and make sure you dedicate time each week to doing things that make you happy."
