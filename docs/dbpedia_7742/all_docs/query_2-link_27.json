        "text": "Frank Stella\n\nWhen Frank Stella exhibited his Black Paintings (1958-1960) at the MoMA in 1959, it was obvious that a new generation of art had begun. His works were simplistic, made up of black brushstrokes in uniform lines. But, what lead Stella to create his artworks?\n\nStella graduated from university in 1957 and quickly moved to New York to be closer to the art he admired. He toured New York’s galleries and saw the likes of Jackson Pollock and Franz Kline out on display. There they were - the greats of Abstract Expressionism for him to enjoy.\n\nWhilst he revelled in New York’s art scene, Stella still had to pay his rent. So, he painted houses in the local area to make ends meet. Can you see where we’re going with this? Stella took that same black enamel paint and commercial paint brush from his day-to-day job, and put them to canvas. And, that’s how his Black Paintings came to be!\n\nIf you take a closer look at his Black Paintings, you see that the black bands are made up of long, consistent brushstrokes. The slices of white in-between are simply raw canvas. It’s clear how his pieces were made. Their process is obvious. His paintings do not try to be anything but Black Paintings.\n\nStella saw his work as that of a factory worker, rather than esteemed artist. And, you can see why! This was the perfect beginning to an art movement which anonymised the artist. Frank Stella let his works speak for themselves.\n\nCarl Andre\n\nCarl Andre is the next of the minimalists on our list. He shared an apartment with Stella from 1958 to 1960, and was encouraged to work by his flatmate.\n\n‘One day Frank Stella just said to me, “Look, if you paint another painting I’m going to cut off your hands […] you are a good sculptor now.”’\n\nSo, he took to sculpture! Andre’s works are also made from everyday materials. Let’s take Last Ladder (1959) as an example.\n\nThis piece was made from a single piece of timber found on a New York building site by Frank Stella and avant-garde filmmaker Hollis Frampton. Once the timber was back at Stella’s studio, Andre chiseled 5 hollows into the wood. Apart from this adjustment, the piece was left as it was. It no longer serves as the ladder it had been before. So, what had it become?\n\nAndre continued to create works out of everyday objects. Equivalent VIII (1966) consists of firebricks arranged in a uniform rectangle. Instead of placing the piece on plinths, it sits on the floor. They become part of the room they are displayed in rather than being a focal point. Once more, the art, and the artist, is allowed to blend into the everyday.\n\nDan Flavin\n\nAround the same time, New York native Dan Flavin experimented with another everyday material - lights.\n\nHe started by combining monochromatic canvases with fluorescent light strips. Flavin called these ‘icons’. They were styled in the same way as religious icon paintings in red, yellow, and black, and replicated shimmery gold-leaf with glowing lights. Instead of celebrating ‘the blessed saviour’, Flavin said his works were ‘constructed concentrations celebrating barren rooms.’ In true minimalist style, he didn’t seek to represent anything else. He only made the viewer away of the very ordinary room they were stood in.\n\nBy 1963, he abandoned the canvas to work exclusively with fluorescent tube lights. “monument” 1 for V. Tatlin (1964) was the first of his thirty-nine “monuments” dedicated to the Russian artist Vladimir Tatlin. Made of fluorescent light strips, the sculpture replicates the shape of Tatlin’s Tower. Though the structure was never built, it certainly had its effect on Flavin. For him, the structure represented a utopia which was never realised; one where art could be united with technology. In the process, Flavin got close to representing this partnership!\n\nDonald Judd\n\nAlthough he didn’t accept the label himself, art history recognises Donald Judd as another key part of the minimalist art movement. In fact, in true minimalist style, Judd did not believe that his works should be collected under a ‘movement’ at all.\n\n\"The new three dimensional work doesn't constitute a movement, school, or style. The common aspects are too general and too little common to define a movement. The differences are greater than the similarities\"\n\nDespite what he said, his work did share some of the characteristics as other works of this time. His piece ‘Untitled’ (1972) is a floor-based work, reminiscent of Andre’s brick compositions.\n\nIt looks like an open box, its base made out of red-enamelled aluminium. The copper walls to the box come to around waist-height. When the viewer looks inside, the red colour is reflected on the box’s internal walls, making it appear much brighter. Untitled is beautiful because of the materials it is made out of. Like the other minimalist works, the piece resists being read. It is simply a thoughtfully-made art object.\n\nSol LeWitt\n\nAnd before we go, we have to mention Sol LeWitt! Sol, as everyone refers to him as, started working right at the end of the minimalist movement. Its influence can be seen in his work.\n\nHis piece, A Wall Divided Vertically into Fifteen Equal Parts, Each with a Different Line Direction and Colour, and All Combinations (1970) takes the question of authorship to the next level. Instead of creating an art piece himself, Sol wrote out a list of instructions that someone could draw from. His work was so minimalist, that it didn’t even initially exist and could be created by anyone.\n\nAnd, if you haven’t already seen his letter of encouragement to Eva Hesse, you should check it out now! Although it's not a part of his body of work, it is the call to action all creatives need to read! Stick it on your wall or on the mirror you brush your teeth in front of in the morning. It’s funny that this letter has become one of the things Sol is remembered for. In terms of minimalism, it makes perfect sense! A letter to his friend, something of use, with advice in it, has become a piece of art."
