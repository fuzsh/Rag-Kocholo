        "text": "After the Nazis gained ascendancy in the Dessau elections, the Bauhaus was forced to close and following the occupation of Paris, architects like Mies van der Rohe (1886-1969), Walter Gropius (1883-1969), and Le Corbusier were forced to flee Europe for America. The emerging architect Phillip Johnson (1906-2005) (then director of New York’s Museum of Modern Art), a renowned propagandist for a particular vision of architectural modernism, introduced American’s to their pared back aesthetic, which he branded the International Style. Johnson’s own Glass House, built in 1947-1949 in New Canaan, Connecticut, was a gathering place for artists, architects, and cultural figures. Contrary to the luxurious lifestyle played out within, Johnson’s house was a simple, minimalist glass box inspired by van der Rohe's earlier 1945 sketches for the as yet unbuilt Farnsworth House.\n\nA showcase of the International Style, the Glass House is externally symmetrical, effectively a single room, organized around an interior brick cylinder, which stands in contrast to the incorporeality of its transparent skin (which Johnson once characterised as “very expensive wallpaper”). The only scant furniture is by van der Rohe, along with a freestanding kitchen island and wardrobe unit shielding a sleeping area. “Comfort is not one of my interests,” Johnson said. “You can feel comfortable in any environment that's beautiful.” The same thought process was presumably employed by Vervoordt in his designs for the Kardashian-West mansion, whose otherworldly aesthetic seems an unlikely backdrop to a family with four young children. When Forbes reporter Zack O’Malley Greenburg visited Kim and Kanye’s home in 2019, he was asked by a handler to cover his shoes with “little cloth booties,” so as to avoid damaging the Belgian plaster floors that, if scuffed, could only be repaired by a crew flown in from Europe.\n\nWhilst the term “minimalist” is often used to describe such spartan, sterile interiors, its origins are altogether different. Minimalism emerged in Manhattan in the early 1960s among a group of young artists who were self-consciously renouncing recent art they thought had become stale and academic. Their sculptures were frequently fabricated from industrial materials — for e.g. Donald Judd’s (19280-1994) aluminium boxes and Dan Flavin’s (1933-1996) fluorescent light fixtures — and emphasized anonymity over the expressive excess of Abstract Expressionism. The term was first used by art theorist Richard Wollheim in a 1965 essay on Judd, Flavin and other artists whose work ostensibly had “minimal art content”. As Wollheim saw it, minimalism wasn’t a question of there being nothing to look at. Instead, it was about creating a complex encounter with a single object, often an everyday thing, such as a brick or fluorescent lighting tube, that otherwise could easily be overlooked. Looking back through the canon of modernist design, and applying this principle to interiors, the Wittgenstein house (1928), designed by the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein for his sister, Margaret, might be considered an early example of minimalism. Wittgenstein spent a year designing each of the radiators which, unusually, fold around corners, so as to preserve the symmetry of the rooms, and in the absence of any decoration, details like door-handles (simple bent brass tubes, with no covers or faceplates, fitted directly into the doors) become a guiding element of the overall interior aesthetic.\n\nOf course, when Wollheim coined the term, he could hardly have anticipated that it would persist up to the present as an important topic in art theory. Although it was initially conceptualised as defining the criteria that a work must fulfil so to qualify as “art” in an institutional sense, it soon became synonymous with a group of artists (Judd, Robert Morris (1931-2018), Flavin, Carl Andre (b. 1935), Robert Smithson (1938-1973) and Sol Le Witt (1928-2007)) whose work focused on positioning primary geometric objects around a gallery space. “The white wall’s apparent neutrality is an illusion,” the artist and critic Brian O’Doherty wrote in his seminal 1976 essay, also in Artforum, “Inside the White Cube”. It subsumes “commerce and esthetics, artist and audience, ethics and expediency. It is in the image of the society that supports it, so it is a perfect surface off which to bounce our paranoias.” In other words, whilst the minimalist architectural devices used by such galleries might present the illusion of artistic and intellectual integrity, they are in fact complicit in the problems of capitalism. (In the nineteen-nineties even Donald Trump, the high priest of gaudy gilt excess, with no obvious affinity for minimalism, asked Philip Johnson to redesign the entrance to his Casino in Atlantic city.) Discussing the physically empty, but conceptually overloaded conditions for exhibiting contemporary art, he adds, “The wall’s content becomes richer and richer (maybe a collector should buy an ‘empty’ gallery space).” (Perversely, Vito Acconci’s Seedbed (1972) was essentially just that, other than a ramp under which out of sight, Acconci, allegedly, masturbated, basing his fantasies on the movements of the visitors above him.)\n\nSubsequently, minimalism found its way into the context of various art disciplines, including theatre, music, literature and film. It was first used in the context of architecture and interiors from the late 1970s, almost unnoticed, to describe those works of an extremely reductive — minimal — appearance. Only from the mid-1980s do we see the widespread adoption of “minimalism” and “minimal architecture” to describe a new design movement characterized by a combination of basic essentials, context and place, emptiness, infinite space, limited colours, simplicity, and the use of concrete, glass, and natural materials and light. The white cube continues to inform the twenty-first century design aesthetic, and presumably, played a role, whether conscious or unconscious, in the vaulted interiors of the Kardashian-West residence, which, when taken to such an extreme, speak as much of wealth and aspiration as the pedimented stone edifices of the eighteenth century country house. This radically reductive approach to design is deliberately intended to evoke a gallery space, where each object is highlighted for its rarity and intellectual value. Such interiors are intended to project an image of cultural superiority, of artistic understanding and appreciation. The grotesque magnification of personal wealth has bred rampant consumerism and a rapacious greed for manufactured Pop culture. Since the 2008 financial crisis, we’ve seen a mad amplification of the luxury market. Collecting has always been an exclusive occupation, and in doing so “collectors” are able to set themselves apart from crowd. Perhaps, having conquered the world of reality television, Kim now has set her sights set on becoming this generations answer to Marie-Laure de Noailles.\n\nBen Weaver"
