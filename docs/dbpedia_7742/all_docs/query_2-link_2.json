        "text": "Table of contents\n\nThe ongoing tendency toward abstraction in the 20th century culminated in new heights after the Second World War in the United States of America. New types of works—a movement in post-war art—were described as ABC-art, Cool Art, Rejective Art, or Primary Structures. Today we know these works as Minimal Art, courtesy of art philosopher Richard Wollheim’s eponymous essay from 1965.[1]\n\nBut what is Minimal Art, and how can one define this groundbreaking art movement? What are the main characteristics? What is the difference between Minimal Art and Minimalism? And who are the most important minimal artists throughout art history? Let’s discuss these frequently asked questions one by one in this complete overview article on Minimal Art, presenting the world’s 25 most important conceptual artists.\n\nWhat is Minimal Art? — Definition, Characteristics & History\n\nMinimal Art is a historical art movement that originated in the 1950s and 1960s in the United States of America, marked by extreme abstraction, geometric shapes, and radical simplicity, pioneered by artists such as Carl Andre, Dan Flavin, Donald Judd, Sol LeWitt, and Robert Morris.\n\nMinimal Art is bound by corresponding formal aspects of various artists. As a result, the main characteristics of Minimal Art include a reduced vocabulary of shapes, the use of seriality, non-relational composition techniques, and the use of new industrial materials and industrial processes.\n\nWhen it comes to Minimalism and Minimal Art, the key difference between both consists of Minimal Art being exclusively bound to visual art. In contrast, Minimalism is associated with specific dance, music, or literature tendencies.[2]\n\nThe medium of painting was a crucial element in the evolution of Minimal Art. Abstract paintings became objects, and so did abstraction moving from painting to sculpture to installation. As a result, many painters associated with Minimal Art are also linked with Abstract Expressionism, Post-Painterly Abstraction, or Hard Edge painting. As soon as we entered the realms of Minimal Art, the tendency had become an art movement on its own.[3]\n\nTop 25 Most Important Minimal Artists\n\nFor this article, we have shortlisted the twenty-five most important Minimal artists. Our first five artists – Carl Andre, Dan Flavin, Donald Judd, Sol LeWitt, and Robert Morris – are arguably the most important Minimal artists, followed by twenty fellow Minimal artists in alphabetical order.\n\n1. Carl Andre\n\nCarl Andre, born in 1935 in Quincy, Massachusetts, the United States of America, is one of the most important Minimal artists living and working in New York City. He pioneered sculpture in Minimal Art with his characteristic copper tiles, bricks, or stones lying on the gallery floors. Geometric shapes and industrial materials are critical characteristics of Andre’s Minimal oeuvre. He installs his sculptures or installations in situ, with the wear on top of the materials functioning as an esthetic but natural patina.\n\nHe describes his works as atheïst due to the absence of spiritual or intellectual qualities. He describes his works as materialist, as they only exist off their own matter and do not take on being something else than their matter. Finally, he describes his works as communist, as they are accessible to everybody. However, this accessibility was not straightforward, as it took several years for public opinion to get used to this radical art form. John Weber, former director of Dwan Gallery, describes how people did not dare to enter the gallery when Carl Andre’s works were on display, as they could only enter the gallery by walking on top of them.\n\n“Art is the exclusion of the unnecessary” – Carl Andre\n\nFor further reading on Carl Andre, we highly recommend the monographic publication Carl Andre: Sculpture 1959-1977. Carl Andre also deserved a spot in our article list of The Ultimate Top 100 Modern and Contemporary Artists.\n\n2. Dan Flavin\n\nDan Flavin was born in 1933 in New York City and passed away in 1996 in Riverhead, New York, the United States of America. Flavin is best known for working with fluorescent light beams and pioneering Minimal Art with his radical and innovative sculptures.\n\nFlavin started as a painter in the late 1950s with abstract paintings. With the turn of the new decade, he started experimenting with fluorescent light, resulting in his breakthrough in 1963, putting a single fluorescent light diagonally on his studio wall. These industrial readymades became the only material or medium for his internationally lauded artistic oeuvre.\n\n“Realizing this, I knew that the actual space of a room could be broken down and played with by planting illusions of real light (an electric light) at crucial junctures in the room’s composition.” – Dan Flavin.\n\nFor further reading on Dan Flavin, we highly recommend Dan Flavin: A Retrospective published in 2004.\n\n3. Donald Judd\n\nDonald Judd was born in 1928 in Excelsior Springs and passed away in New York City, the United States of America, in 1994. For many, Donald Judd is the ultimate Minimal artist. A statement that is very difficult to argue.\n\nLike Dan Flavin, Donald Judd started as a painter in the 1940s, painting traditionally before experimenting radically with various reliefs, combing painting with sculpture. In 1963, Judd stopped painting, worked with and in spaces, and started exhibiting in the New York art scene, baffling art critics and enthusiasts by the dozen with the renowned simplicity and strictness of his objects.\n\n“It isn’t necessary for a work to have a lot of things to look at, to compare, to analyze one by one, to contemplate. The thing as a whole, its quality whole, is what is interesting. The main things are alone and are more intense, clear, and powerful.” – Donald Judd.\n\nFor further reading on Donald Judd, we highly recommend the retrospective publication JUDD, published by the Museum of Modern Art in New York on the occasion of his first retrospective in 30 years in 2020. Donald Judd features in our article list The Ultimate Top 100 Modern and Contemporary Artists.\n\n4. Sol LeWitt\n\nSol LeWitt was born in 1928 in Connecticut, the United States of America, and passed away at age 78 in New York City. LeWitt was one of the leading figures of Minimal Art and is best known for his wall drawings or geometric sculptures, which he referred to as structures.\n\nLeWitt creates multiple permutations of his structures, exploring a geometrical and mathematical system with industrial materials such as aluminum, metal, or concrete. Being a key figure in the evolution of Conceptual Art, LeWitt insisted on the idea, scheme, and planning of these structures as the artwork itself. In doing so, the actual execution of the sculptures – the objects themselves – is inferior in relation to the concept of the structure.\n\n“A blind man can make art if what is in his mind can be passed to another mind in some tangible form.” — Sol LeWitt.\n\nFor further reading on Sol LeWitt, we highly recommend Sol LeWitt: A life of Ideas. As Donald Judd, Sol LeWitt features in our article The Ultimate Top 100 Most Important Modern and Contemporary Artists.\n\n5. Robert Morris\n\nRobert Morris was born in Kansas City in 1931 and passed away in 2018 in Kingston, New York, the United States of America. Morris is best known for pioneering Minimal Art, Process Art, and also Land Art and is also associated with Fluxus and Performance Art.\n\nContrary to his Minimal colleagues, Morris does not confine his work to one specific direction of thinking. In doing so, the pioneer took on multiple questions establishing multiple theories for art movements.\n\n“Simplicity of shape does not necessarily equate with simplicity of experience.” – Robert Morris.\n\nFor further reading, we highly recommend Robert Morris: Object Sculpture, 1960-1965.\n\n6. Stephan Antonakos\n\nStephan Antonakos, born in 1926 in Agios Nikolaos, Greece, passed away in 2013, is a renowned Minimal artist best known for his bright and colored light installations.\n\nAntonakos started his artistic career as a self-taught artist in the 40s. After experimenting with collage and sculpture, Antonakos was struck by fluorescent lights, which would soon be his primary medium resulting in breakthrough exhibitions in the New York art scene in the 1960s.\n\nFor further reading on Stephan Antonakos, we highly recommend Stephen Antonakos: neons and works on paper.\n\n7. Jo Baer\n\nJo Baer, born in 1929 in Seattle, Washington, the United States of America, is an internationally lauded Minimal artist living and working in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.\n\nLike many artists from her generation, Jo Baer had a solid academic background as a painter and a Biologist with a very strong knowledge of perceptual physiology, which is a crucial element in her work. As a result, a recurring motive in Baer’s oeuvre – especially in the 1960s – consists of a dark painted frame with a blanc or white interior.\n\n“A painting is an object which has an emphatic frontal surface. On such a surface, I paint a black band which does not recede, a color band which does not obtrude, a white square or rectangle which does not move back or forth, or up or down; there is also a painted white exterior frame band which is edged round the edge to the black. Every part is painted and contiguous to its neighbor; no part is above or below any other part. There is no hierarchy. There is no ambiguity. There is no illusion. There is no space or interval (time).” – Jo Baer\n\n8. Larry Bell\n\nBorn in 1939 in Chicago, the United States of America, Larry Bell is a Minimal artist best known for his works, according to the artist, “about nothing”. They simply illustrate a void or a lack of subject matter in a very literal way.\n\nIn 1962, Bell developed a technique to create a thin layer on the glass to create a transparent and subtle color on glass surfaces. As a result, he made a series of works based upon the cubic form combing Op Art and Minimal Art, resulting in several breakthrough shows in New York.\n\n9. Ronald Bladen\n\nRonald Bladen was born in 1918 in Vancouver, Canada, and passed away in New York City in 1988. Bladen is best known for his Minimal sculptures, often monumental in size.\n\nBladen is occupied with the spacial context and how a sculpture can interfere in this context. In doing so, Bladen interacts with the viewer as it is often necessary to walk around the sculpture multiple times to understand the expressive nature of the object.\n\nFor further reading on Ronald Bladen, we highly recommend Ronald Bladen: Sculpture published in 2019.\n\n10. Mary Corse\n\nMary Corse, born in 1945 in Berkeley, the United States of America, is a Minimal artist from a different generation than our previously discussed artists. Corse is best known for her very controlled formal approach using geometrical shapes in the tradition of Minimalism.\n\nShe is lauded for her ongoing exploration of the surface and painting. In doing so, she aims to create a dynamic according to the surroundings of the painting and the spatial awareness of the viewer.\n\nFor further reading on Mary Corse, we highly recommend Mary Corse published by Inventory Press.\n\n12. Robert Grosvenor\n\nRobert Grosvenor was born in 1937 in New York City, the United States of America. Grosvenor’s early work from the 60s consisted of large triplex shapes mounted on the ceiling or the wall at a certain height. In doing so, Grosvenor shows his interest and ongoing examination of gravity, dynamics, and the spatial dialogue between the artwork, the space, and the viewer.\n\nLater on, his work would often consist of monumental installations or sculptures which the audience must navigate. He insists his works need to be approached as ideas that take place, or operate, between the floor and the ceiling of the space.\n\nFor further reading on Robert Grosvenor, we highly recommend Robert Grosvenor published in 2020.\n\n13. Carmen Herrera\n\nCarmen Herrera was born in 1915 in Havana, Cuba, and still, up to today, lives and works at a 100+ age between Paris, France, and New York City, the United States of America. (Edit: Carmen Herrera passed away on February 12, 2022, in New York City)\n\nHerrera is best known for her wall objects hovering between sculpture and painting. These objects are called ‘structures’ or rather ‘Estructuras’. She is associated with Minimal Art and Op Art or Hard Edge painting. She takes on color and minimal shapes and brings them together in serene wall objects. Only in the first decade of the 21st century, Herrera received international recognition resulting in exhibitions at major institutions, including a retrospective at the Whitney Museum of Modern Art in 2016.\n\nFor further reading on Carmen Herrera, we highly recommend Carmen Herrera: Estructuras.\n\n14. Eva Hesse\n\nEva Hesse was born in 1936 in Hamburg, Germany, and passed away in 1970 in New York City, the United States of America. Hesse emigrated from Germany in 1939 to New York due to the upcoming Second World War. In New York, she started painting in 1954 at the Cooper Union School of Art, resulting in Abstract Expressionist paintings throughout the 1950s.\n\nBetween 1965 and her sadly early death in 1970, Hesse produced an oeuvre of 70 artworks reinterpreting Pop-Art and Minimal Art. She often created serial artworks, grid motives, and cubes and frequently used industrial materials and processes.\n\nFor further reading on Eva Hesse, we highly recommend the complete catalog raisonné Eva Hesse: Catalogue Raisoné (2 parts).\n\n15. Gary Kuehn\n\nGary Kuehn, born in 1939 in Plainfield, the United States of America, is a contemporary artist living and working in New York City. During the 1960s, Kuehn studied together with Roy Lichtenstein and George Sagal.\n\nHis works result from his psychology, desires, and personal experiences. The artworks disrupt the power of the pure form, resulting in often surrealistic or expressionistic shapes. In doing so, he constructs simple geometrical shapes before breaking or disjointing them.\n\nFor further reading on Gary Kuehn, we highly recommend the monographic publication Gary Kuehn: Five Decades published in 2013.\n\n16. Robert Mangold\n\nRobert Mangold, born in 1937 in New York, the United States of America, is a Minimal artist primarily occupied with painting. Mangold finished his studies at the art academy of Yale University in 1963.\n\nIn an era in which painting was proclaimed dead, Mangold remained very passionate about painting and saw new possibilities within the medium. He approaches a painting as a combination of surface and form instead of a pure object. Doing so, he continued to work on a flat surface. For Mangold, this two-dimensionality was not a flaw but the absolute strength of painting.\n\nFor further on Robert Mangold, we highly recommend Mangold published by Phaidon in 2004.\n\n19. Charlotte Posenenske\n\nCharlotte Posenenske – born in 1930 in Wiesbaden, Germany, passed away in 1985 in Frankfurt am Main, Germany – is a key figure when it comes to Conceptual Art and Minimal Art. Her oeuvre spans a short era of time from 1959 until 1968, leaving a mark on contemporary art history in just a decade.\n\nPosenenske’s work can be reproduced as many times as possible according to an industrial process. The primary model, the idea or concept, is the artwork itself which can be reproduced infinitely. In doing so, Charlotte Posenenske rejects the commercial nature of the art market, selling her works at prices of merely material costs.\n\nFor further reading on Charlotte Posenenske, we highly recommend the monographic publication Charlotte Posenske: 1930–1985.\n\n21. Fred Sandback\n\nFred Sandback – born in 1943 in Bronxville, New York, passed away in 2003 in New York City, the United States of America – is best known for his installations or sculptures using colored thread or wire to create geometrical figures in space.\n\nSpaces could be demarcated flat on the floor or from the floor to the ceiling, creating three-dimensional shapes such as triangles or squares. In doing so, Sandback illustrates how small interventions can be of significant influence. Most of his artworks were necessarily built in situ due to the varying dimensions of the space, resulting in unique works for every site.\n\nFor further reading on Fred Sandback, we highly recommend Fred Sandback: Decades.\n\n22. Richard Serra\n\nBorn in 1938 in San Francisco, the United States of America, and passed away in 2024 in New York, Richard Serra is one of the most iconic Minimal artists known for his monumental sculptures. As a true Minimal artist, Serra uses industrial materials such as steel to create monumental surfaces, often bending or curving in space. Serra invites the viewer to enter the sculpture and to become aware of how the sculpture influences our awareness of space and scale.\n\nFor further reading on Richard Serra, we highly recommend Richard Serra: Forged Steel. Furthermore, Serra is part of our article list of The Ultimate Top 100 Modern and Contemporary Artists.\n\n23. Tony Smith\n\nTony Smith, born in 1912 in South Orange, New Jersey, the United States of America, passed away in New York City in 1980. Smith insists art is not the product of conscious decisions but rather a result of subconscious flashes of ideas. These images or ideas hide in his dreams, and it is the task of the artist to identify and capture them, followed by producing them as an object in reality.\n\nFor further reading on Tony Smith, we highly recommend Tony Smith: Architect, Painter Sculptor.\n\n24. Robert Smithson\n\nRobert Smithson – born in 1938 in Passaic, New Jersey, and passed away in 1973 in Amarillo, Texas, the United States of America – is arguably one of the most productive artists of his generation. By doing so, Smithson is also known as a significant author writing thousands of pages on his contemporaries.\n\nSmithson is strongly associated with Land Art due to his iconic artwork Spiral Jetty. However, he is also an essential figure in Conceptual Art and Minimal Art due to his oeuvre of installations and sculptures.\n\nFor further reading on Robert Smithson, we highly recommend Robert Smithson: Sculpture.\n\nThe Best Books on Minimal Art\n\nFor further reading on Minimal Art, we highly recommend the following publications:\n\nFrances Colpitt, Minimal Art: The Critical Perspective.
