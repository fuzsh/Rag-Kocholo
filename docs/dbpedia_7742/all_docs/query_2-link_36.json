        "text": "Description\n\nA school of abstract painting and sculpture that emphasizes extreme simplification of form, as by the use of basic shapes and monochromatic palettes of primary colors, objectivity, and anonymity of style. Also called ABC art, minimal art or reductivism. “In my experience they are never flashy, always well presented, and have a reserved style that turns everyone around them into jabbering idiots. They have a slightly cold, unknowable quality.” “Page 334, What are you looking at By Will Gompertz). (Minimalism)\n\nArt that is intended to convey an idea or concept to the perceiver and need not involve the creation or appreciation of a traditional art object such as a painting or sculpture. As the American artist Sol Lewitt pointed out in an article for the magazine Artforum in 1967, “Conceptual art is good only when the idea is good.” (Page 313, What are you looking at By Will Gompertz) (Conceptualism)\n\nIntroduction\n\nMinimalism and the conceptual art movement of the 1960s and 1970s completely transformed our understanding of space and materials. Based primarily in New York, the artists involved started creating objects out of raw materials that consisted of basic geometric forms. The goal was to eliminate any kind of reference to the outside world in order to create works that referred only to themselves. For the conceptual artists, this meant that the idea itself could be the work of art. It is easy to imagine how radical these new pared-back artworks would have been against the background of abstract expressionism – the dominant art movement of the 1940s and 1950s – which prized self-expression and European traditions.\n\nAlthough Donald Judd, Carl Andre, Frank Stella and Sol LeWitt fiercely denied labels such as ‘minimalist art’, they are all considered major figures within this movement. Judd’s Untitled 1975 and Andre’s Steel-copper plain 1969 – both on display in the new contemporary galleries – demonstrate the minimalists’ focus on raw materials and uniform geometric shapes, or ‘primary structures’, while the goal to eliminate external references can be seen in Stella’s Untitled 1965, which uses the canvas’s own stretcher bar as the scale for the repeating squares.\n\nFrank Stella’s works were most likely spots on numbers of patterns in color. Both artworks focused on shapes and shades as Stella said about seeing things in one capture. Lewitt’s art pieces used to change color and adapt visual effects to impress the audience with their meanings behind it. Like Stella, Lewitt expressed by the meanings of the color (grey-scales represent random feelings while rainbow colors represent emotions), but the answer is still minimalism because the quote “less is more” means colors may also do the same if Sol Lewitt may prove it minimal to his artwork, his keeps playing with it to show more discoveries like space (the most secret element to all arts). Most of all, Stella’s work complains about the mixture between light and darkness to explain his ideas of portraying the impact of patterns\n\nBut Sol Lewitt commented he took his art to a higher level, independently making physical expressions to the audience. He wrote, “In Conceptual art, the concept or idea is the most important aspect of the work…”, this means his works were part of introducing a new wave of Post-Minimalism (since its short lifecycle) and the still ongoing Conceptual Art, but at a more leader-like level.\n\nSome of Lewitt’s and Stella’s artworks may have similarities in terms of colors used but their styles looked different since they used different techniques. Because Stella’s works looked like the form of straight shapes color by color (with the middle ring being the darkest color, while the center and the edges were like both the lightest or the other way round), acting like lighting in a tunnel. On the other hand, Lewitt’s works were slightly 3-D (in sculptures). He had in general more colors used in his works than Stella, because Lewitt used them for giving out an impression to the audience.\n\nMinimalism\n\n“The adjective “minimalist” generally signifies any form simplified or pared-down (just no more than multiple shapes). It is also a reference to American artists from the mid-1960s, these movements presented serial structures made of industrial materials. Despite its short lifecycle, these works were effective without references to other themes/forms.” (Page 96, …isms: Understanding Modern Art by Sam Phillips)\n\nLists of minimalist artists below…\n\nMarcel Duchamp (Dadaist) (Jul 28, 1887 – Oct 2, 1968)\n\nCarl Andre (born Sep 16, 1935)\n\nDonald Judd (Jun 3, 1928 – Feb 12, 1994)\n\nFrank Stella (born May 12, 1936)\n\nMark Rothko (Sep 25, 1903 – Feb 25, 1970)\n\nAs the name of the technique implies, minimalist artworks are made into their minimal and simple forms (no more than multiples of colors) without modifications. It is very conceptual, the form of which could be into space, condition, light and detail of the material. It also dialogued most of the environment including revealing simple spaces to any minimal effort to make it as simple as possible. Donald Judd’s Untitled gave various examples of space with different materials used for the boxes.\n\nMinimalism came from John Graham who created his first minimalist artwork in 1929, although it was not until the 60s that this was recognized). David Burlyuk first used the term, since his words appealed to future minimalist artists such as Judd who wrote his principal form about Minimalism. His article began by announcing the birth of a new type of three-dimensional work that could not be classified in terms of either painting or sculpture and, in effect, superseded both traditions. Judd’s concept became retrospectively identified with his own boxes and stark geometric reliefs of the period.\n\nThe reason these artworks are minimal is because I mentioned above its about space (the main characteristics) but on the other hand, its main focus is about geometric shapes, color and patterns (like the BMW Art Car). This is another major part of the story.\n\nHow these are conceptual/minimalist?\n\nHow can conceptual art existed in both art movements, with the lack of emotion on one hand plus also artists being very serious on the other? There are in fact a few differences…\n\nRepresentational Art is about the real world, landscape, a person, a reflection on emotion/feeling and a tin can of soup! However, Minimalism did not have interest on acting like the latter (not representing outer reality), only respond to what you see, material and form of reality from the work. This means one of Stella’s quotes is like reflecting on what somebody sees instead of expressing out.\n\n“What you see is what you see” by Frank Stella\n\nBut if conceptual art could be minimalist, some artworks like Judd’s Untitled and Carl Andre’s Steel Copper-plain demonstrated some future artist to focus on raw materials and geometric shapes so they could still displayed as art pieces but in a minimal way. One minimal artist, Ad Reinhardt (an architect and abstract painter) defined his style with his quotes “Less is more”. This is used to display some terms in architecture as part of minimalism. Minimalists who made paintings (such as Frank Stella) only have few colors for creating objects without references.\n\nHowever minimalism is like just simply with ABC and more, fond to the public than keeping it personal to the artists themselves, plus it lacked emotion (because it focuses on pure visual response to the viewers). So making it simple is still complex if made in own forms. It has the shortest lifespan of any art movement, but it continued its influence with paintings and other movements, which leads to post minimalism.\n\n“A shape, a volume, a color, a surface is something itself. It shouldn’t be concealed as part of a fairly different whole.” – Donald Judd\n\nMostly, artworks are minimal is because I mentioned above its about space (the main characteristics) but on the other hand, its main focus is about geometric shapes, color and patterns (like the BMW Art Car). This is another major part of the story.after the 70s, the movement still inspires artists for making various different things with simplicity (like architecture, land art and other developments) in favor for importance. This is because Donald Judd’s quotes revealed it “starts with a shape, volume, a color and something itself” meaning it starts with a simple form then you modify it to be a bit complicated in the end. It is still important to all art if connected with conceptualism.\n\nConceptualism\n\n“Conceptual means all planning and decisions are made beforehand and the execution is a perfunctory affair. The idea became a machine that makes the art…it is involved with all types of mental process and its purposeless. It is usually free from the dependence on the skill of the artist as a craftsman.” (Page 427, Art the Twentieth Century by Flaminio Gualdoni)\n\nList of conceptualist artists below…\n\nMarcel Duchamp (Dadaist)\n\nSol LeWitt (Sep 9, 1928 – April 8, 2007)\n\nVanessa Beecroft (born Apr 25, 1969)\n\nChristopher Williams (born 1956)\n\nAs the name of conceptualism implies, the invention of “The Fountain” by Duchamp paved the way to the introduction of conceptual art. It was based on the notion for an essence of an art idea, or a concept that may exist in a direct form as representation. It has also been called Idea art, Post-Object art, and dematerialized art because it often assumes the form of a proposition (i.e., a document of the artist’s thinking) or a photographic document of an event.\n\nConceptualism however takes the audience to feel something related to both viewers and the artist (like some cartoon arts may give a message). This means they give more relations to a message than any other artwork found. This is because the artists like to give something that others could not do as much when it comes to the art piece (like inside the shell of a camera lens or one nude woman among dozens of women in black bikinis or lingerie). These could be not scary thanks to the artists attempting to share their messages with viewers of their work.\n\nWhat makes these works conceptual is since the success of the Fountain, these art movements were talking about mental forms like ideas and its still intuitive with every type of material and processes. This required the skill of the artist as a difficult move like building your own without referencing it. Craftsmanship is not too important just simply put or make up.\n\nWhat makes it conceptual?\n\nAccording to some artists, the movement in their artworks was like with the idea (like making an architectural building), which was rumored or in case some minimalism.\n\nWhat they were talking about is like they were formulated into numbers of ideas that they want to make by will. This makes it “conceptive” rather than illustrative so I thought it would be purely engaging to the work rather than “to say”. When compared with minimalism, conceptual art refers to the sensuality of ideas rather than making it emotively.\n\nWhat concept art portray is like they looked in depth more for ideas than expressions, I doubt they could be more sematic than illustrative (it has to reveal something between the ideas), the picture on the right hand side shows the inside structure of the camera lens filled with lots of structures for functioning it…\n\n“In order to gain some insight into the forces that elevate certain products to the level of ‘works of art’ it is helpful – among other investigations – to look into the economic and political underpinnings of the institutions, individuals and groups who share in the control of power.” by Hans Hacke\n\nThe reason about why it has to be conceptual is because the movement (with the focus on mind rather than senses) is about imagining things whether you want to. However, it’s not much perceivable as some other art methods. As shown in galleries/museums, sometimes they were rejected for not being “traditional” but it did give a lot of complicated questions. We noticed now conceptual art still spans from 60 years till today (its an ongoing movement), with a lot of answers not buying much but the true meaning to it was like the shape of power. But sometimes, painting and text were part of it so the movement is still likely about ideas and imagination rather than emotion and sense, thus the movement is still processing today\n\nMaking connections\n\nIn minimalism, they should use simplification to learn more about what they see in points of life, when express with “Doing more with less”. Conceptual art however, put a lot of ideas to express opinion (plus being an idea maker rather than an object maker) but it is a little difficult to observe.\n\nSimilarities Differences\n\nImpactful (both can be stunning towards the viewers)\n\nContemporary (they were classified as their own art form, not following any other movements)\n\nMore related to daily life\n\nUse of expressionism\n\nLack of emotion\n\nThe use of basic idea or concept of the work before actual creation\n\nIdealistic (Conceptual Art)\n\nSimple (Minimalism)\n\nSophisticated (Conceptual Art)\n\nUse of more photos as an art form (Conceptual Art)\n\nLack of expressive content (Minimalism)\n\nMuch more clean (Minimalism)\n\nMore complicated (Conceptualism)\n\nMore difficult to identify as an art form (Conceptualism)\n\nMore interactive experience (Conceptual Art)\n\nThe use of patterns (Minimalism)\n\nMore sculptures (Minimalism)\n\nA urinal changed the course of art. The father of conceptual art is Marcel Duchamp, whose urinal off 1917 caused the decisive rupture from tradition and forced a re-evaluation of what could and should be considered art. Duchamp’s contention was that artists should not be limited to such a rigid range of media through which to express their ideas and emotions. (Page 314, What are you looking at? by Will Gompertz) Duchamp deliberately chose a readymade object manufactured by mass production, at a time when mass production was in its full swing.\n\nMinimalism was a reaction against Abstract Expressionism. Minimalists aimed to replace the emotional subjectivity with reason and impartiality. In place of splatterings of paint, they worked with cool, mathematical accuracy. Minimalism extended the idea that art should not be an imitation of anything, but should have its own identity. (Page 176, 50 art ideas you really need to know by Susie Hodge)\n\nThe reason why these movements are different is because of their relation to both daily life and expressions, they somehow looked either complicated or simple to make it not only freely but to give some more special feelings when the movement was simple (Minimalism) or ideal (Conceptual Art). But for the artists, they thought and acted differently depending on when they were born. But conceptual art began first then minimalism came later, so things may have started from Duchamp’s art piece I mentioned earlier. Some of them were living in a society of hippies and civil rights, while others were living in a society where both discos and improving economies were the norm. When they made these artworks, most were pop-culture based reflecting something modern to them at that time\n\nArt Now\n\nThe influences of the two movements had come a long way and they still continued to inspire. Since their introduction, they have never stopped influencing the art world.\n\nImpact of Minimalism\n\nAs minimalism became successful, a lot of people planned to make some more minimalism but only a few were credited as a minimalist artist in history, many of them set up their portfolio and became less well-known than major artists. Minimalism however, is still seen through the world, even on your clothes that comes with not many details. Because the movement uses a few colors to let us use the senses but some meanings about expressions depending on the work they made.\n\nHowever, it also influenced uni-qlo clothing, Giordano and architecture. One prime example in the left is an architect named Yasuhiro Yamashita, who made a minimalist building with a minimalist style, simple geometric shapes and forms. The other example is Uni-qlo, a Japanese casual wear design manufacturer, which manufactured minimalistic casual clothes for all genders. They know how to express with color on different objects.\n\nImpact of Conceptual Art\n\n“I wasn’t really that interested in objects. I was interested in ideas.” – Lewitt\n\nWhen some parts of minimalism evolved into conceptualism, various people who saw things tried to make some more conceptualism, making the genre itself being placed in different types of art (one could be found in cartoons as conceptual cartoons).\n\nBut still, most of conceptual art maybe found in other types of art but they were listed in other categories (because only a few works were made to fit the genre), so most other artworks made by art students or other artists have not placed their artworks in the conceptual category yet until they learned what their artwork looked like to fit into that genre.\n\nArt Now\n\nBoth art genres may happen at the same point, because it was from that particular milestone that various art students have been influenced. But most of all, the two movements are included in the university curriculum since the impact had made them so special that they want to make their personal drawings familiar. Another thing one should think of is how it can be further improved after all theories are learned.\n\nLinks\n\nIt would be tricky to estimate since when they existed, but sometimes when conceptual art and minimalism were formed during Dadaist movements, the names appeared after WWII. For Minimalism, it was created after the artwork Fountain came into existence. However, it was not until nearly 50 years later that both the art movement and the artist were referred to minimalistic. The technique was not yet named until some paintings by Mark Rothko made a link to that.\n\nFor Conceptual art, Duchamp still didn’t name the movement conceptualistic yet until 1953 when an artist called Robert Rauschenburg named the movement truly conceptual, 7 years before Minimalism was named. But still the Minimalism movement came before Conceptualism.\n\nIt is worth noting that there are a few well-known artists in history who were both Minimalistic and Conceptualistic. One of the most well-known artists for both movements was Sol LeWitt. The reason is because of his rainbow color paintings, his significance between both movements was important. However, he is not the only one to have it even his inspirations still carried on to the present day."
