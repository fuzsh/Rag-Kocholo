        "text": "Anthony has been making waves in the music industry for over 25 years, with his rich, soulful voice and powerful lyrics that capture the human experience. But as we dig deeper into the life of this Grammy-winning artist, we find that his passion for music is only one part of his story. From his family life to his foray into the world of food, Anthony is a multi-faceted man who is unapologetically himself in everything he does. His signature hat collection is expansive, and each hat expresses his unique style every time he’s seen.\n\nAnthony's Musical Career\n\nBorn in Charlotte in 1971, Anthony grew up listening to a diverse range of music, from gospel to soul to country. He began singing in church as a child, and by the time he was in his early twenties, he was performing in nightclubs and other venues in the Charlotte area. Anthony soon moved to New York to follow his dream of making it big in the music industry. In 1993, he signed his first record deal with Uptown Records. A versatile artist, Anthony would soon establish himself as an accomplished singer, songwriter and record producer. His talents as a songwriter earned recognition in 1999 when “U Know What’s Up,” a song Anthony co-wrote, became a hit for singer Donell Jones. Just three years later, Anthony received his first Grammy nomination for Nappy Roots’ 2002 single, “Po Folks.”\n\nA year later, Anthony released his second studio album Comin’ from Where I’m From. The album, which went Platinum, showcases Anthony’s unique blend of soul, R&B and gospel and was a critical and commercial success thanks in part to its title track and the hit single “Charlene.” In 2008, Anthony won the Grammy for Best Traditional R&B Performance for his duet with legendary Soul singer Al Green on the single, \"You've Got the Love I Need.\"\n\nAnthony has released several more albums, including Ain’t Nobody Worryin’ (2005), The Point of It All (2008), Back to Love (2011) and What I'm Feelin’ (2016). In 2022, Anthony was awarded the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Male Artist for his stellar performance on his most current album, Love is the New Black (2021). But beyond his critical and commercial success, it’s Anthony's authenticity and honesty that has endeared him to fans around the world. He writes and sings about the struggles and joys of everyday life, from love and heartbreak to family and spirituality. His music is deeply personal and relatable, and his live performances are known for their soulful energy and raw emotion.\n\nAnthony's Family\n\nDespite his numerous career successes, Anthony finds his ultimate joy and fulfillment in his role as father to his six sons Anthony Jr., Romeiro, Tristen, Nolan, Aaron and Princeton. Though he has been open about the challenges of balancing career and family life, he has always made it clear that his family comes first. Anthony's family is an integral part of his music career. His children have appeared in several of his music videos, and his son, Romeiro, is also a talented musician who has performed with his father on stage. Anthony often shares photos and videos of his family on social media, and he has said that they are his biggest inspiration and motivation.\n\nHis Love for Food\n\nIt was only natural that Anthony would venture into the world of food. Reverence for lovingly preparing Lowcountry foods is a tradition that was handed down to him by the women and men in his family. In recent years, he has turned this passion into a business. Anthony launched his own line of signature hot sauces, called Hamilton's Hot Sauce, in 2016. The line includes four different flavors, each named after one of Anthony's hit songs: Cornbread, Mac & Cheese, Southern Charm, and Ain't No Shame. Hamilton’s hot sauces have been well-received by fans and food critics alike, winning awards at hot sauce festivals around the country.\n\nIn 2019, Anthony released a cookbook, “Cornbread Fish’n Collard Greens” featuring his personal favorite southern dishes. Anthony has also opened Hamilton Cornerstore\n\nwhere along with kindred spirit Chef April Robinson, Anthony offers southern staples\n\nmade with the finest ingredients and cookware needed to create sumptuous down-home meals at home. He prides himself on his grits, cornbread, cake mixes, sauces and seasonings."
