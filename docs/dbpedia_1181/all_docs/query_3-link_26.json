        "text": "As I kid, I always wondered what I’d do if I got invited to a royal ball. I blame it on all the Disney movies I watched, all the historical fiction I read, and perhaps even my grandmother (“what if you eat with the Queen,” she’d say if she caught me slurping spaghetti, “and she could see the way you chew”)? But eventually, those fantasizes subsided. Pragmatism took over. Unless I, like Mia Thermopolis, was secretly royal myself, the odds of getting invited to such an event seemed impossible.\n\nBut after one decade and a couple years of dedicated royal and society coverage, I found an invitation to Monaco’s Gala de la Croix Rouge in my inbox.\n\nSeven decades ago, Prince Rainier of Monaco started the Gala de la Croix Rouge to raise money for the Red Cross in Monaco. In 1958, Princess Grace got involved, and the event turned into the pinnacle of the Monaguese summer social calendar. This year’s gala, hosted by His Serene Highness Prince Albert and Her Serene Highness Princess Charlene, would be the event’s 70th anniversary. I thought back to my seven year-old self, then I RSVP’d yes.\n\nSo on July 27, I put on a gown, and went to Monaco’s Salle des Etoiles for a royal night out. Maseratis and Bentleys whizzed past as I made my way to the entrance hall. Tuxedo-clad men accompanied women dripping in fine jewels, and the supply of champagne appeared endless. One mysterious couple was trailed by a videographer as they sashayed down the hall. I heard people conversing in yes, French, but also Russian, Arabic, Mandarin, Italian, and English.\n\nEventually, it was time to take our seats in the venue. The minutes ticked by, and the liquor continued to pour, but the event itself hadn’t started. What, or who, we were waiting for?\n\nThat would be Prince Albert and Princess Charlene who, per royal protocol, are always the last to arrive to an event. At just before 9:15 in the evening, musical fanfare indicated their presence. They walked onto the stage, Charlene’s silver Versace gown shimmering under the spotlight. The entire crowd rose. When they took their seats, we did too.\n\nWhile guests dined on toothfish ceviche with caviar, Prince Albert made a speech, alternating between English and French, detailing the work of Monaco’s Red Cross, especially the creation of a first aid training center in Burkina Faso. “I am extremely proud of all the actions, in Monaco and abroad, that have been undertaken, proud of the involvement of our volunteers and permanent workers,” he said.\n\nThe night drew on, and the courses kept coming, each fancier than the next—red mullet with Provence artichokes and argan oil, veal fillet mignon with a thin tian tart. When it was time for the final course, it turns out dessert wasn’t the only treat—a fireworks show erupted over the bay.\n\nIt was a signal that the real party was about to start. To this American’s surprise, a country band took the stage, playing classics like “Wagon Wheel,” and “Take Me Home, Country Roads.” The Prince and Princess delighted everyone by taking a spin on the dance floor.\n\nAt midnight, the lights dimmed, and the crowd sat hushed. The main attraction was here: Seal.\n\nThe crowd was electrified by his crooning. He belted out his classics–”Kiss From a Rose,” “Fly Like an Eagle,”—as well as some songs by other artists, like David Bowie‘s “Rebel Rebel.” He hopped off the stage and started parading around the crowd. At one point, he started dancing on tables."
