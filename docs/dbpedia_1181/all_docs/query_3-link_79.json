        "text": "It's been a few weeks since Princess Charlene of Monaco made a major public appearance, but the Monegasque royal was back in glitzy fashion over the weekend, as she attended the Bal de la Rose charity ball in Monaco. The evening marked Charlene's first appearance at the event in nearly ten years, according to the Monaco Tribune.\n\nFor this year's disco-themed event, Charlene leaned into '70s era glamour with a striped, sequined jumpsuit by Elie Saab. She paired the glittering style with a clutch purse, a pair of dangling drop earrings, and, perhaps most shockingly, a change to her signature blonde pixie. While the princess has been sporting closely cropped locks for a while now, usually with demure, side-swept bangs, at the Bal de la Rose she debuted a new, slightly longer bixie (AKA a bob-pixie hybrid) with eyebrow skimming fringe. Could this be the first indications that she plans to grow her hair out?\n\nWhile Charlene's tresses have been a staple of her style, the switch up isn't entirely without precedentâ€”last May she made another dramatic change, swapping out her platinum shade for a chestnut brown hue. The look wasn't long-lived, but it did make an impression. Only time will tell if this latest style shows more staying power for the ever-experimental royal.\n\nCharlene attend the ball alongside her husband, Prince Albert, and Albert's sister Princess Caroline, who serves as president of the event. It comes in the wake of a busy end of 2023 for the royal couple, who made a flurry of appearances together toward the end of the year following a swirl of rumors they had separated.\n\nYou Might Also Like"
