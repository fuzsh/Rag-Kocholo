        "text": "★ “Ray Bradbury-esque….An intersectionally diverse cast of authentically flawed characters complement Thomas’s fiendishly clever premise and swiftly paced, slyly crafted plot.”—Publishers Weekly, starred review “An emotional genre bender with a startlingly eerie setting, sparkling prose, and a wholly original concept. Charlene Thomas is an author to watch.” —Jessica Goodman, New York Times bestselling author of The Legacies and The Counselors “Gorgeously written, atmospheric, and deeply intelligent, Streelight People is part mystery, part sci-fi, and wholly original. Thomas tackles heavy topics like fate, identity, and class with grace. Her characters will stay with you long after their final page. You do not want to miss this book.”—Liz Lawson, New York Times bestselling author of The Agathas and The Night in Question “Disorienting and delightful in equal measure, Streetlight People is a gorgeously told Lynchian tale of a claustrophobic small town full of insidious secrets. A gripping story about the measure of power and who gets to use it.”—Joelle Wellington, author of Their Vicious Games “Just when you think you’ve got it all figured out, Charlene Thomas throws a curve ball into the space-time continuum in this gorgeously evocative book that will keep you guessing until the very end about the Have-Lots and the Have-Nots who inhabit the magical city of Streetlight.”—Susan Azim Boyer, author of Jasmine Zumideh Needs a Win and The Search For Us “A dreamy story of class division and belonging, so sensory you can almost taste it. Charlene Thomas steers us through the dizzying lattice of the butterfly effect with a deft and attentive hand.”—Isa Arsén, author of Shoot the Moon “Streetlight People is a layered, slow-developing photograph of a novel, with the subtle tension of a shadow moving closer in the corner of your eye. With atmospheric prose and a setting so vivid I felt like I could find it on a map, Thomas expertly pulls you through Streetlight People, toward a satisfying twist that made me want to start over from page one. An entrancing read. —Jill Tew, author of The Dividing Sky “An utterly unique and twisty spin on time travel that will have you wanting to take one of Kady’s candies so you can go back and do it all over again. The last fifty pages will have your jaw on the floor.”—Stacy Stokes, author of Remember Me Gone and The Darkness Rises “Thomas’s fiery entrance into the speculative genre will have readers clawing to uncover countless truths. A story worth reading time and time again, Streetlight People challenges every facet of reality, questions who you can trust, and focuses on the morality of what’s done behind the doors that are meant to keep you out.” —Brianna Peppins, author of the Briarcliff Prep series “There are secrets abound, and more than meets the eye, in Charlene Thomas’s Streetlight People, an alluring story of intrigue set in a small town of the Have-Nots and Have-Lots, a generations-old not so secret society, powerful families, and an ending that will leave you breathless. I absolutely love Kady’s bravery and tenacity and her determination to uncover the truth no matter what the cost, even if the truth ends up revealing something ugly about herself, and I love Charlene’s way of storytelling even more.”—Yasmin Angoe, Anthony-nominated author of Her Name Is Knight"
