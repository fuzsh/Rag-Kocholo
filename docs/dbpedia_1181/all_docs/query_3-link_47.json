        "text": "Prince Albert and Princess Charlene of Monaco invited cameras into the Prince's Palace of Monaco to capture a rare glimpse of life as a royal. The behind-the-scenes footage shows the couple showering their twins with love and affection, while chatting about parenthood and the joy it has brought them both. It was a busy December for Albert and Charlene, who, in addition to marking Christmas festivities, celebrated Prince Jacques and Princess Gabriella's first birthday on Dec. 10.\n\nSCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO\n\nWhile the setting was the palace's grand Salon du Glace, the atmosphere was in many other ways that of an ordinary family with framed photos and blue and pink-themed mementoes for each child in the background. Next to the prince in one corner was also a big stuffed polar bear.\n\nPrincess Charlene lavishes attention on her baby boy.\n\nThe video included never-before-seen footage of the twins' joyous christening and their presentation on Monaco's National Day in the arms of their mother and father.\n\nIn the interview, filmed in English and French, the babies played at their parents' feet amid a selection of their favourite toys as Charlene, 37, and Albert, 57, talked about the children's different personalities and their hopes and dreams for them. At one point, the devoted mother was seen picking up her boisterous boy to hold him high in the air.\n\nPrincess Gabriella was heard babbling away in the interview.\n\nCharlene started by describing her children as \"very active, very playful, absolutely adorable, lots of fun\" adding with a laugh, \"and a lot of work.\"\n\nSpeaking in French, Albert said that the twins are contented and rarely cry. \"I have never really heard them complain. Yes, when they are hungry (they do) but they've never been noisy (except when) they are being joyful.\"\n\nThe couple went on to say how sociable their son and daughter are â€“ although Charlene pointed out that it takes a while for them to warm to strangers.\n\nThe mother of two distracts Jacques with a toy.\n\nDuring the chat the Monegasque leader was keen to praise his wife for looking after the toddlers \"marvellously.\" The sovereign has previously mentioned that the mother of two is up herself with them at 6 a.m. every morning, which is, he said, why they are so happy and smiley.\n\nJacques is the most active as could be seen during the interview, with the little prince pulling himself up and covering a lot of ground, while his sister seemed very vocal.\n\nPrince Jacques will one day inherit his father's throne.\n\nGiven her background as a former Olympic swimmer, who competed for her country South Africa, Charlene is keen that both of them be water babies. She revealed that she has already begun teaching them to swim using the \"drown proof\" method, a technique that allows children to be competent in the water from an early age.\n\nAnd who do the babies look like? \"Several people have said that Gabriella looks more like me than Jacques....\" replies the prince. \"I definitely think there is a bit of Charlene in both of them. But it's too early to say for sure.\"\n\nThe interview then turned to their royal heritage, with Albert saying he hopes to introduce them \"in the gentlest way possible\" to the responsibilities that come with their position as his own father did.\n\nCharlene added while she's aware of the duties awaiting them, what is most important to her as a mother is their \"health and well-being, that they know they are loved and cared for.\""
