        "text": "Much metta & gratitude to all the students who allow me to share my passion for yoga, pilates and meditation with them.\n\nNamaste\n\n(The light in me honors the light in you.)\n\n*****\n\n\" Following a life changing car accident in 2015, I began paying attention to the limits of stress and neglect on myself. My normal physical routine of swimming and exercise classes were no longer effective in helping me regain strength and mobility. At a friend’s insistence, I looked into Pilates instruction with a heavy dose of skepticism. Then I met Charlene Lowe who completely changed my thinking about the importance of Pilates, mental health, physical health and wellness. Beginning a year ago my twice weekly sessions with Charlene helped me increase my physical ability, improve my mobility and reverse my conviction that I no longer had the ability to use stairs. She encouraged me to increase my water intake, explaining how water could help in the damaged areas of my right leg, the “healing” leg as Charlene would describe. Recently her focus has been on helping me condition my body for knee replacement surgery, with a focus on increasing core strength and lower body range of motion. I see the results each time I leave her studio, and appreciate her carefully thought out exercise plan designed with my needs as the central focus. Charlene integrates her knowledge in a thoughtful manner, listening first, then making specific suggestions based on my needs. Her interaction with me is always positive, encouraging, thoughtful and helpful. \" - M.P.\n\n*****\n\n\"I have been involved with Pilates Reformer, Pilates Mat and Yoga for many years and have worked with many instructors along the way. Charlene has a very special gift as she intuitively senses what adjustments are needed and how to communicate her \"vision\" for the specific student with a minimalist suggestion. She always makes me feel like she is attending to me, even though the class may be large. I have really learned to stretch myself in so many ways under her guidance. I have moved my body in so many different ways, directions and tempos in her classes, than I ever had before and I thought I had done it all. Every class is uniquely different and I am never bored. Have I mentioned her terrific sense of humor? OMG, she makes me laugh dozens of times each hour. I walk out of her class and I am energized and happy to be alive! Thank you Charlene!\" - E.C.\n\n*****\n\n\"I would like to say that Charlene is an incredible pilates teacher. I have practiced Pilates for over ten years and she is by far one of the best teachers I have ever had. The energy she puts into each class is truly incredible, no two classes are ever the same. Charlene constantly keeps me and my body challenged and engaged. My only issue is I never want her classes to end. She truly cares about her students and is very creative with modifications for all our aches and pains.\" - D.M.\n\n*****\n\n\"I have attended Charlene Lowe’s Pilates reformer classes for several months. Charlene’s style is very engaging and hands on to ensure body placement and movements are correct. At the beginning of class, she always asks how I am feeling and if any body parts need special attention. She is very attentive to individual needs/abilities and offers a range of choices to modify, if needed. Her routines are challenging and varied…always something new. She helps me outsmart my body parts into doing things in a different way and with fun.\" - S.S.\n\n*****\n\n\"Charlene makes pilates classes challenging and interesting and does a great job making sure everyone is on form.\" -R.B.\n\n*****\n\n\"I have been taking Pilates reformer classes with Charlene for some time now. Her instruction is excellent, varied and well thought out. I have hip issues and without making a big deal of it she frequently checks in during our workouts to make sure everything is ok. I find her classes sometimes a pain in the ass and always a joy.\" - S.W.\n\n*****\n\n\"I had dabbled with yoga off and on over the years until I started practicing with Charlene. I appreciated her consistent understandable approach to each class, sprinkled with humor and underpinned by her sensitivity and awareness of each student’s individual needs. Through her classes, I progressed my strength and flexibility. Several years ago, I was diagnosed with osteoporosis and improving bone health through yoga became a significant focus for me because of the known benefits it can have. Through several private sessions, Charlene worked with me to create a daily practice that incorporated 12 poses known to improve bone health. Her knowledge of anatomy and her approach to safe modifications as needed has been a tremendous help. I continue with that practice today as well as participate in her classes both in person and virtually. Thank you, Charlene, for your passion and dedication to your students.\" - K.K.\n\n*****\n\n\"I have followed Charlene for several years in her yoga and meditation teaching. My practice, as a result, has become much stronger and much more focused. Now I am proud to follow her with the Pilates reformer/tower classes! Charlene's extensive knowledge of anatomy is so valuable to me after having been a workout trainer! She is able to identify and correct potential issues with each of her students in a fun and caring way. The classes are subtle and very effective in strength, stamina and freedom of injury.\" - J.B.\n\n*****\n\n\"After many years of weight lifting, cycling and working as a firefighter I find that pilates helps me address my muscle imbalance. Pilates has greatly increased my flexibility and range of motion while lengthening and strengthening my muscles. For me this equates to an easier time completely in day to day activities - all this in a supportive and nonjudgmental environment. Charlene has a great sense of humor, is selfless and makes everyone in the class feel successful!\" - J.W.\n\n*****\n\n\"Four highlights of my week are taking Charlene’s mat pilates class along with her tower, jump board and reformer classes. Thanks to Charlene’s classes I have been able to continue to workout while rehabbing a torn meniscus in my knee. I have gained strength and flexibility that I notice has impacted my daily activities in a very positive way by making daily movements effortless. Pilates has become an activity I am able to share with my husband which makes it an added bonus - all levels, all flexibilities (or lack there of) can benefit!\" - M.E.W.\n\n*****\n\n\"I have been so blessed in my yoga practice and now with my Pilates practice to have Charlene as a teacher. My experience is that nothing works as fast as Pilates to build strength and tone your muscles. I look forward to many more classes. Forever grateful.\" - N.R.\n\n*****\n\n\"Monday, Wednesday, and Friday are my favorite days of the week since I can practice Yoga with Charlene. Always sincere, always on time, always kind and patient she makes our hour together something I value. And it is not only me who looks forward to seeing Charlene but my two Poodle girls Lola and Luna who are as excited as I am when she arrives, jumping and running around the room until we begin, then relaxing in their favorite doggie yoga positions for the next hour. Life cannot be better than this.\" - J.E-H.\n\n*****\n\n\"Dear Charlene, You and your class have been a very good addition to my life during a period when I've had a hard time finding the energy & enthusiasm for new endeavors. The combination of your skillful teaching, your hilarity because you are funny, which I so appreciate, and the sacred space you create where we can all ground in our bodies & breathe...I feel excited about coming to class, and I always feel happy to have been to class. I have never had a class that I've been as regular at so thank you for offering a class so good it keeps me coming back on the regular. You're just that good!\" - R.\n\n*****\n\n\"I am a 17-year-old athlete and before I worked with Charlene I had back and neck pain all of the time. Charlene met with me privately for an assessment. She asked me questions about my activities, what was bothering me and what I was currently doing to help myself. After the assessment, she gave me ideas on how to change the position of how I study, sit, walk and sleep. I was taught how to use some props and how to realign my computer when working on it. A few days after we met she sent me a 20-minute workout/yoga routine she taped for me Zoom style. This helped me stretch and strengthen where I needed it. I could just turn on my computer and do my Charlene tape when I had the time. This changed my life! I am now virtually pain-free.\n\nThank you, Charlene! \" - G.S.\n\n*****\n\n\"Charlene has been one of my brightest and warmest candles during the dark days of our pandemic. Her vinyasa classes “jumpstart” my days in such an invigorating and empowering way. Not only because of her well-orchestrated vinyasa sequences but also from the additional gifts Charlene brings to her classes such as the beautiful poems or readings shared during Savasana and her heart-stirring, guided meditations. Charlene has even shared warm-up exercises for rotator cuff issues from time to time that have been so beneficial for shoulder opening poses.\n\nFrankly, I have not known a yoga teacher in my twelve years of yoga practice who gives as much to her students as Charlene. But what stands out most for me when I speak of her to friends or other yogis is Charlene’s warmth and caring approach to all her students. She immediately puts her students at ease with humor and loving acceptance of our human struggles. I know I am in the company of a very skilled and talented yoga and meditation teacher, but I also feel I’m in the company of a dear, fun-loving friend who is sharing her love for yoga and meditation on and off the mat.\" - V.B.\n\n*****\n\n\"When I say that yoga is “life-changing” with Charlene, I mean it. After 3 back surgeries and chronic pain for years, I can say that I am relatively pain free. And, it’s all because of the slow, strength/core building that I am learning. The breathing exercises don’t hurt either! Charlene is patient, kind, and makes every class fun. I never thought I could be a yoga addict. But, here I am!\" - C.D.\n\n*****\n\n\"I have had the privilege of practicing yoga, with numerous practitioners, all across this country for 20 plus years. It wasn't until I began to practice with Charlene, that I knew that I had found that special someone - my yoga teacher. Charlene brings to the mat her passion for the practice and a sincere desire to inspire people. In all of my time doing yoga, I have NEVER known a teacher that could intuitively scan the room and design the perfect practice for the class, while making you feel it was all done just for YOU!!!\n\nThank you my friend for your gifts to humanity. I am truly a better person for knowing you.\" - M.G.\n\n*****\n\n\"Charlene is AH-MAY-ZING!! I started practicing with Charlene 3 1/2 years ago when I began my yoga practice. She gave me a solid foundation in her beginner classes and slowly increased my strength and stamina through her Hatha and Vinyasa classes. She also introduced me to chanting and meditation, which are still part of my daily practice.\n\nCharlene's classes are both fun and challenging. Charlene offers variations of each posture to offer success to all of her students. Her classes are my go to especially to switch up my vinyasa routine, to learn new and challenging asanas, and to learn proper alignment. I highly recommend Charlene's classes!! Her kindness, philosophy, dedication and humor always shine through while practicing with Charlene! See you on the mat!\" - M.S.\n\n*****\n\n\"Charlene’s sense of humor has always been one of the things that I love about her. Her meditation classes are easy for anyone to understand and find value in wherever you are on your path. Along with humor, her honesty (no BS approach) knowledge, passion for wellness/spirituality and kindness are so inspiring. She always makes me feel heard, seen and valued.\" - S.G.\n\n*****\n\n\"Charlene offers deep and rigorous instruction but keeps it fun and approachable. She engaged me enough to learn that I had chronic low back pain that flared when I moved through certain asanas. She kept an eye on me over a couple of sessions and ultimately identified a correction to my form that has really relieved both issues! Personable, insightful, confident, knowledgeable, fun and committed to her students... Thank you Charlene! 5 star recommendation! I look forward to more.\" - E.H.\n\n*****\n\n\"Charlene Lowe, has a unique ability to deconstruct a yoga pose in a manner useful to all levels of yoga students. I can take her beginner class followed by the most challenging Vinyasa class. Same teacher, same description, same effort. She can focus on the essence of a pose by elements of breath, balance, posture and focus employing humor and encouragement. Most importantly, she is not tied to conventional yoga language…while still being an incredible spiritual teacher. Charlene Lowe makes yoga fun, useful and safe.\" - S.A.\n\n*****\n\n\"My first Yoga class was with Charlene and I still enjoy her and her instruction. I learn something new in each of her classes. She is supportive, funny, innovative, and instructive. No class is ever the same. Her knowledge of anatomy and years of experience allow her to seamlessly offer students modifications. She never, ever makes you feel anything but glad you showed up. I leave Charlene's classes feeling calmer and more centered, knowing that my day will be better because I started it with her.\" - T.S.\n\n*****\n\n\"I’ve been taking classes with Charlene at Sukha Yoga for almost 5 years. I was new to yoga but had danced in my youth, so I appreciate Charlene’s emphasis on correct alignment and her small adjustment suggestions for each pose. Each class I may learn (or hear differently) a note for a pose that helps me strengthen my practice. I also enjoy Charlene’s calm and soothing voice; when she leads us through breathing exercises, her voice is like chanting. And on the flip side, Charlene’s occasional irreverence and cheekiness keeps the class light and fun. I tell my friends I’m addicted to yoga and much of my addiction is credited to Charlene’s safe and fun teaching.\" - K.V.\n\n*****\n\n\"I have been practicing yoga with Charlene for a few years. I enjoy her teaching style as she is very knowledgeable, understanding, funny and warm. I always feel fantastic after taking one of her classes. Recently I took a meditation workshop with Charlene and came away with some great tools to use to help calm the mind.\" - M.S.\n\n*****\n\n\"It was just about 9 years ago that I started yoga because I had just had a stroke. I knew nothing of yoga except I thought it would get me moving and it did for almost 9 years! It’s only that we are moving out of Marin that I am leaving Charlene and Sukha Yoga. When I started the classes we’re small but everybody accepted it and it grew….especially Charlene’s beginner class which ran for several years. It was for all levels and people did what they could do. Every class I got a workout and that’s just what I wanted. It's going to be hard to find another “Charlene “ but I won’t give up till I do or someone who will motivate me to show up on the floor! Thank you Charlene and Sukha Yoga!\" - S.G."
