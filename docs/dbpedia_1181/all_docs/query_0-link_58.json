        "meta_description": "[4.1] Anthony Hamilton has this thing where he starts albums so strong, then it kinda dwindles away lol. First half of this album is almost flawless and has some of the best songwriting. Second half is full of highlights, but don't quite match up to the first 6 tracks. Overall though, definitely one of my favorite neo-soul projects.",
