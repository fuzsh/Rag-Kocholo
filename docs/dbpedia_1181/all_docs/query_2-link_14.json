        "meta_description": "Good Day by Charlene, released 04 November 2013\n\n1. Good Day\n2. Second Nature\n3. Intoxicated\n4. It Is The Way\n5. Thank You\n6. Second Guessing\n7. Lost\n8. My Yesterday\n9. Break-ups\n10. Back To Me\n11. The Central Line\n12. First Date\n\nIf the purpose of music is to make you feel something, then Good Day does that and then some. It’s an honest album with conversational lyrics; each song tells a story. The range of songs allows you to tap into your emotions through the instrumentation and lyrical content. The songs capture the expressed sentiments with rare ease. Everyone has their “go-to” song or their theme tune for when they feel a certain way and Good Day is full of songs that serve that very purpose. Good Day doesn’t fit neatly into a genre; it has hints of neo soul, r’n’b, funk and bossa nova. For that reason, it’s an album that you’ll want to listen to over and over and over again.",

I'm a good girl I'll rock your world Just call and I'll be there My all with you I will share I'll tear down the walls I'll bare my soul I'll tell all If you'll do the same Do you know what we'd gain? I'll be your best friend there for it all Until the end CHORUS BRIDGE Don't know if you've got a woman There's no need to be shy Coz I'm a single girl Not seeing other guys You really caught my eye\n\n3.\n\nIntoxicated 03:27\n\nVERSE 1 Just one look from you Elevates me to a new high Just one touch from you And I'm high as a kite You are my love drug And boy I'm stuck on you The sweet scent of your skin I breathe and breathe you in CHORUS Intoxicated I feel wavey When you're near I lose control But best believe I want you near VERSE 2 You consume my thoughts The first and last thing on my mind I see only you To all else I am blind I'm under your spell Hypnotised by you if this were to come to an end Don't know what I would do CHORUS BRIDGE Boy I'm so addicted to your love To your touch, to your hugs Boy I'm so addicted To your smile Your style You drive me wild\n\n4.\n\nIt Is The Way 04:50\n\nVERSE 1 It is the way that you run your fingers up and down my spine It is the way that you kiss and touch me all through the night It is the way that you pay attention to the smallest things It is the way that oo oo oo you do everything It is the way that when you're with me you take your time It is the way that you travel baby my oh my It is the way you work the top, the bottom, front, the back and sides It is the way that you make me feel deep inside And who, who knew That you could do and work those moves CHORUS I wana be, be, be With you in ecstacy-cy-cy Lying here with you, you you Is what I wana do, do, do VERSE 2 It is the way that I buckle when I'm held in your embrace It is the way that you when and where to hit that hidden place It is the way you make my body tremble wrinkle up my face It is the way you pay attention to me like I'm a special case It is the way you act on every thought before I speak a word It is the way you know my being like I'm a well-known verse It is the way that you fit my body just like a glove It is the way that when I'm with you I'm filled with love And who, who knew That you could do and work those moves CHORUS BRIDGE It is the way baby That you make me feel baby Coz when I'm with you I feel brand new (brand new) It is the way baby (It is the way baby) that you make me feel baby oo oo oo Coz when I'm with you (Oh you) You make my body scream Aaaaaah\n\n5.\n\nThank You 03:46\n\nVERSE 1 Where do I even begin To express the depth of my feeling i don't know if I can put it into words So I've set my thoughts to this verse I hope I do justice to you Express my gratitude No love till I knew you And for that... CHORUS I want to say thank you For loving me the way you do I know that it can't be easy Yet you're still so good to me VERSE 2 You are my resting place With you I feel safe Yet I respond to your smiles with my frowns Your ups with my downs Yet you're still around You make me a better me You love unconditionally Without you don't know where I'd be And for that... CHORUS BRIDGE Tell me what did I do to deserve you I am the luckiest girl in the world I am so glad that you chose me Deemed me worthy of your love\n\n6.\n\nSecond Guessing 04:53\n\nVERSE 1 When we started out you would call me two or three times a day Things have changed you don’t call or text all your tone says is your engaged When we first started out you couldn’t get enough of me Now I’m on last on the list of people that you want to see Baby you got me CHORUS Second guessing All I do is sit and question Tell me baby what has happened To our love VERSE 2 When I try and lay it on you, you say you’re not in the mood Before I’d be fighting you off and gearing up for round 2 You got me analysing every little thing you do I can’t be this way any longer Sit, think, and obsess over you Baby you got me CHORUS BRIDGE See what you need to do is say Coz I can’t go on living this way You gotta say what you want You need to speak your mind I don’t care if you’re scared Baby now’s the time VERSE 3 The things you say to me no longer match the things you do There’s a distance between us not just physical emotional too Don’t know if we can go back to the way that we once were My mind is riddled with confusion do you want me or her Why don’t you just talk to me? CHORUS\n\n7.\n\nLost 04:57\n\nVERSE 1 She don't know where she's going She don't what she's wanting Looking back in time For something she can't find She continues on Wondering where time's gone Looking deep inside The contours of her mind Troubled thoughts pervade Her endless waiting days Never satisfied Looks for her next high When she hits the sky Meets that recurring lie Lost in false ecstasy For a time she is free CHORUS What goes up it must come down She falls and crashes to the ground Her world is spinning round and round Now she's lost but will she ever be found VERSE 2 Sky high or way down There's no middle ground Feels herself slipping away Doe she care enough to stay? Wonders aimlessly Still hasn't found what she seeks What she seeks she don't know Feels more and more alone She tries to plug that hole But there's a darkness to her soul Loses a piece everyday Now it's dark when she's awake No ear to hear her cries No hand to dry her eyes So she does what she knows best Rides each wave to its crest CHORUS CHORUS (Portuguese) Tudo o que sobe Tem que cair Nesse chao de terra (Vo)ce vai sair Seu mundo, ta perdido no tempo Nesse alento seu coracao foi com o vento\n\n8.\n\nMy Yesterday 04:38\n\nVERSE 1 Do you remember how good we used to be Those were the exact words that you said to me I think that we must have very different memories Coz the way that I remember leaves no room for happy You must be out your mind Are you stupid, dumb or blind To think that I would take you back one more time Let me tell you what I know You need to go I can't hear your lame excuses anymore no CHORUS You had a chance but you didn't take it We had our time but we didn't make it What's left to say Let's go our separate ways You're not my tomorrow But you are my yesterday VERSE 2 You want to come back after all this time But I have moved on I've got someone else in my life Did you expect me to put my life on hold for you You thought about yourself and I'm goona do the same too You want to meet up do the thngs that couples do You better listen close coz I've got news for you The time for that has passed Not your girl and that's a fact You want one more chance but I can't do that, no CHORUS BRIDGE I don't know how you expect me To forget all the pain and misery Start afresh like it never happened Are you crazy? Are you crazy? There's no longer and you and me In fact it's an impossibility Baby you must dreaming, You must dreaming yeah, yeah You packed your bags and chose to leave Now you realise the grass green CHORUS\n\n9.\n\nBreak-ups 03:21\n\nVERSE 1 Everything has a season Ours has ended for good reason And although I'm glad we're through I still love you And although I'm g;ad we're through I still love you VERSE 2 Deep down I know We've reached the end of our road I'm so happy to have known you You have touched me in ways that I couldn't be And in ways I never dreamed of You've helped shape me into who I am VERSE 3 I'm leaving you to start something new and It just has to be this way I'm so confused and Don't know what to do But I know I can't do this thing with you Got to start afresh and Got to start anew but I know, I know, I know, I know (I know I've got to leave) Whatever I have to do I know I have to leave you (I know I've got to leave) Whatever I have to do I know I have to leave you (I know I've got to leave) Whatever I have to do I've got to leave (I know I've got to leave) Whatever I have to do I know I have to leave you\n\n10.\n\nBack To Me 04:36\n\nVERSE 1 You came along at just the right time Before you I was numb And passion was just a vestigial limb You made me feel again Baby I'd been sleeping But you shook me awake Like I hadn't been eating But you filled up my plate Like a glass of water You quenched my thirst Like the man you are, my needs came first The drought is over Here comes the rain CHORUS Coz I'm getting back to me I'm getting back to me Said I'm getting back to me I'm getting me Coz I'm getting back to me I'm getting back to me Coz I'm getting back to I'm getting back to me VERSE 2 Baby you said all the right things You made me value me You made me feel so sexy My confidence reached its peak Baby I've been living And it's all coz of you In fact I've been feasting My appetite's been renewed No longer asleep I'm back on my feet Watch out, watch out there's a new girl in town Like a super, super duper man You came and rescued me CHORUS BRIDGE You reopened my eyes And made me realise No man can put asunder My happiness and and wonder Coz I'm getting back to me It is happening finally Don't you try and break my stride I will put you to the side CHORUS Coz I'm getting back to me It is happening finally Don't you try and break my stride I will put you to the side Coz I'm getting back to me It is happening finally Don't you try and break my stride I will put you to the side CHORUS\n\n11.\n\nThe Central Line 04:29\n\nVERSE 1 Sitting on the tube Looking everywhere but you I wanna catch your eye But I'm much, much too shy So I'm hoping you will notice me (I'm hoping that you'll notice me) Just look up and smile put me me out my misery ( Just look up and smile put me me out my misery) So I'm three stops in My journey's soon to end You've gotten up to go (Why are you leaving) Again I've missed boat Another day has gone it's the same (Another day has gone it's the same) Maybe tomorrow you'll ask me my name (Maybe tomorrow. My name) CHORUS I wonder if you even see me I see you I wonder if you wana meet you I do you It's like maybe you do maybe you don't Maybe you will maybe you won't I'm gona give you my number it's on you VERSE 2 Here we are again Both on the 8am You've got your pinstripe on Listening to your songs I wonder what it is you do (I wonder what it is you do) I just wana get to know you (I just want to get to know you) Today is gona be the day That I brush my fears away (That I brush my fears away) I just gotta talk to you And let you know what I would do Baby you need get to know (Baby you need get to know, know, know. Know, know, know.) Stop your reading take out your headphones (Stop your reading) CHORUS BRIDGE When I see you I get tongue-tied If I could say what is on my mind I would say Let's go out, let's dance, have a drink, maybe a little a romance Let's go out, let's dance, have a drink, maybe a little a romance Let's go out, let's dance, have a drink, maybe a little a romance Let's go out, have a drink, let's dance, maybe a little a romance\n\n12.\n\nFirst Date 03:30"
