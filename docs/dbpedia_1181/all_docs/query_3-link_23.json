        "text": "“To be with you here today to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Princess Grace Foundation U.S.A. is one of those times that I wish my mother could be with us,” Prince Albert II said at a luncheon hosted by Dom Perignon on Monday. “The fact that you’re all here to continue her legacy, to continue supporting the performing arts in this country, would give her tremendous joy,” he told the crowd at Restaurant Daniel.\n\nAfter presenting an award to honoree Lynn Wyatt, Prince Albert decided it was time to toast the supporters at the intimate luncheon—and looked around at the tables nearest to the dais for a glass. “It would make more sense for me to have Champagne,” he said, setting off a scramble for a fresh glass at the closest table. Someone handed him a glass, he made his toast, and then, to the person who’d supplied the tipple, he asked, “Is this your glass? Can I have a sip out of this, please?” before handing it back.\n\nPrince Albert told VF Daily that while he normally waits until evening to have Champagne, he didn’t mind Dom Perignon passing the bubbly at noon. “I don’t have any problems with that,” he quipped. “It’s a wonderful product, and I did, actually, a marketing-and-P.R. training program with Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton many, many years ago.” It was in the mid-1980s, after he’d finished college, and done a stint in the French navy. “So I’ve been to see the vineyards there where Dom Perignon comes from,” he said, laughing. “I don’t only like Champagne; I like other wines, too.”\n\nPrincess Charlene, in a red Akris dress, told us that she has been inspired by her husband’s involvement in the Princess Grace Foundation. “There was a legacy that was left behind. She had a passion, and that passion was the arts and culture,” Charlene said. “I’ve started my own foundation, drawing inspiration from this foundation,” she added.\n\n“Because I’m very passionate about swimming, and teaching children to swim, I’ve drawn the inspiration from this to put back into a sport that I love very much,” Princess Charlene continued. The former Olympic athlete noted the importance of water safety for children. “The awareness of the need to learn to swim, which is very important. I’m not saying I want kids to go to the Olympic Games, but to maybe give an opportunity to those that are not able to get to facilities.”\n\nAnd she clearly is passionate about the subject. “You know, I can teach an 18-month-old toddler to swim,” Charlene said. These days, she swims four times per week, in the sea. And she laughed when we asked if her husband’s swimming has improved since they met. “He needs his backstroke!” Princess Charlene said.\n\nThe menu, a starter of crab salad with celery-apple roll and a main course of chicken breast with caramelized cipollini onion and gnocchi, was not hard to dream up, chef Daniel Boulud said. “I know the chef of the Palais in Monaco very well, so I communicate with him, and ask him what they like,” he told us. “Then I make sure the dishes I do are in sync with their liking,” he added with a Gallic shrug."
