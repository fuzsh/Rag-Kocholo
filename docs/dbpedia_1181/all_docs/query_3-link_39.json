Donna had some health scares in between but came out on top. She seems to be enjoying life away from the limelight these days. Donna has penned her autobiography and occasionally writes poetry.\n\nCrystal Gayle\n\nInspired by her sister Loretta Lynn’s success, Crystal Gayle decided that a music career was her calling, too. She was born Brenda Gail Web but changed her name to Crystal when she was 16. The young singer’s first single “I Cried the Blue Right Out of My Eyes\" (1970), reached No. 23 on the country charts.\n\nIn 1977, her single “Don’t It Make My Brown Eyes Blue” shot her to fame. It was her first No. 1 song. Since then, Crystal has won a Grammy, two CMA awards, and American Music awards. In 2017, she became a member of the prestigious Grand Ole Opry.\n\nAnne Murray\n\nAnne Murray’s songs have appealed to music lovers over her 40-year career. Her first hit was “Snowbird” in 1970, which reached No. 1 on the U.S. charts. She became the first Canadian artist to achieve the feat. Anne became a superstar in 1978 with her single “You Needed Me.”\n\nThe song’s release marked the beginning of a successful run. She released several hit singles in 1979, including \"I’ll Just Fall in Love Again\" and \"Shadows in the Moonlight.” She retired in 2018. Overall, the songstress racked up four Grammys, 24 Junos (a record), three AMAs, three CMAs, and three Canadian Country Music Association Awards.\n\nSammi Smith\n\nSammi Smith was one of the few artists who took country music outside the hallowed halls of Nashville. Sammi signed with Columbia Records in 1967, where she first met a janitor named Kris Kristofferson.\n\nHer initial days at Columbia saw moderate success. In the ‘70s, she released a single called “Help Me Make It Through the Night,” written by her friend, Kris. The song shot to the top of the country charts, eventually earning the singer a Grammy in 1972. Sammi recorded seven more albums and at least 16 songs that stayed on the charts. Sadly, Sammi died at her Oklahoma home in 2005.\n\nTanya Tucker\n\nTanya Tucker is the veritable bad girl in country music. “Bad” might be relative, though. But back then, country fans weren’t accustomed to seeing their artists so sexy and free. Tanya was only 13 when her song “Delta Dawn” (1972) reached No. 6 on the country charts.\n\nShe continued creating hits that evoked mixed feelings. Fans loved the songs, but the themes seemed too “adult” for someone her age. She paid no mind to haters. To date, Tanya’s had top-10 and top-40 hits and won a Grammy as well as several CMA nominations. She has also launched her own tequila brand, Cosa Salvaje.\n\nDottie West\n\nDottie West’s music career kicked off in the ‘60s with her Grammy-award winning single, “Here Comes My Baby Back Again.” Dottie later paired up with Kenny Rogers, and together, they sang duets that became country classics.\n\nBut it was only in the ‘70s that Dottie came into her own as a solo artist. She began adding more pop elements into her songwriting, and everyone got on board with a new Dottie. In 1980, “Lesson in Leavin’” reached No. 1 on the charts – her first as a solo artist. Sadly, Dottie passed away in a car accident in 1991.\n\nTammy Wynette\n\nFans knew Tammy as the “First Lady of Country Music” – but the singer struggled in the early days. She faced a string of rejections from almost every record label. Tammy almost gave up on the dream until meeting producer, Billy Sherril who helped kickstart her career.\n\nHer first Number One was “I Don’t Wanna Play House” in 1967, followed by five successive chart toppers. Her most popular track was “Stand by Your Man.” Tammy ruled the country music charts in the ‘70s. The country music icon died in 1998 due to cardiac arrhythmia.\n\nEmmy Lou Harris\n\nEmmy Lou Harris is known for effortlessly blending country, pop, rock, and folk into her music. She makes popular music seem old-timey and country music sound contemporary, even sophisticated. Harris’s talents first came under the spotlight when she sang soprano for Gram Parson’s solo albums (1973-74).\n\nThe musician released dozens of successful albums and singles produced by her husband, Brian Ahern. So far, she’s won 14 Grammys and is a member of the Country Music Hall Of Fame and The Grand Ole Opry.\n\nJune Carter Cash\n\nJune Carter Cash may be Jonny Cash’s second wife, but there's so much to her. Before her famous marriage, she was June Carter of the popular Carter Family Trio until the group disbanded. June saw some success as a solo artist in the ‘60s. But her most notable performances were with Johnny Cash, whom she eventually married.\n\nJune released her first solo album, “Appalachian Pride” in 1975. Fun Fact: “Ring of Fire” was originally a June Carter single, the same one that brought her husband incredible success years later. June passed away in 2003 following heart surgery complications.\n\nStella Parton\n\nStella Parton got into the music business just like her big sister Dolly. The spotlight tends to shine away from Stella, even when people should know better. In 1975, Stella’s song, “I Want to Hold You in My Dreams Tonight,” was a Top 10 country hit.\n\nThe singer has released several albums since then – each one featuring top 20 and top 40 singles. Stella’s also written cookbooks and appeared in shows like “BBC Celebrity Master Chef.”\n\nBillie Jo Spears\n\nBillie Jo Spears's music career began in 1964 when she secured a recording contract with United Artists Records. She later moved to Capitol Records, with whom she saw her first hit, “Mr. Walker It’s All Over” in 1969. The song reached No. 4 on the country music charts.\n\nHer signature song, “Blanket on the Ground” (1975) was her first No. 1. Billie had a huge fan following in the UK. She continued to tour the country for at least 30 years – long after her career in the US had slowed down. Billie died in 2011 after battling cancer.\n\nJeannie C. Riley\n\nJeannie C. Riley is best known for her crossover hit “Harper Valley PTA” (1968), which topped the country and pop charts, almost simultaneously! It marked the start of her meteoric rise in the music industry.

In the mid-70s, Jeannie became a born-again Christian and began recording gospel music. She lives in Franklin, Tennessee, with her second husband, Billy Starnes.\n\nRita Coolidge\n\nRita Coolidge’s music was everywhere during the 1970s and 80s.

Some of her most successful recordings include \"(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher\" (1977), \"I’d Rather Leave While I'm in Love\" (1979), and \"We're All Alone\" (1977).\n\nCinephiles will also remember her voice in the 1983 James Bond film \"Octopussy,\" where she sang the theme song, \"All Time High.\" Rita published a memoir in 2015 and released an album “Safe in the Arms of Time” in 2018.\n\nChelsea Brown\n\nThere was nothing Chelsea Brown couldn’t do. The star was a staple on NBC’s popular sketch comedy show “Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In.” Along with Diahann Carroll, Chelsea was one of the first black women with a recurring TV role in the ‘70s.\n\nChelsea appeared in numerous shows after the series, including “Police Story,” (1973) and “Ironside” (1971). She married Vic Rooney and moved to Australia, where she continued working in tv, films, and theater. Chelsea returned to the US in 2002 after her Vic passed away. She died from pneumonia on March 28, 2017.\n\nCharo\n\nCharo was a household name in the ‘70s. You could not miss her fabulous hair and her talents as a singer, actor, and comedian. First discovered by Xavier Cugat (who she later married), Charo began appearing regularly in shows around Las Vegas and New York.\n\nHer appearances on “The Ed Sullivan Show” introduced her to a different audience, and soon, she was headlining numerous shows in Las Vegas. When she wasn’t singing, Charo appeared in beloved ‘70s shows like “The Love Boat” (1976). She lives with her second husband, Kjell Rasten, in California. She also popped up on “RuPaul’s Drag Race” in March 2020.\n\nGretchen Corbett\n\nGretchen Corbett got her start in television on an obscure series called “NYPD” in 1968. The show was canned soon after, but the ’70s would mark the beginning of her long career. She appeared in an obscure comedy film called “Out of It” and later in “Let’s Scare Jessica to Death” (1971), in which she played a mute girl known simply as The Girl.\n\nGretchen is best known for her portrayal of Beth Davenport in “The Rockford Files” (1974). She left the show after four years and continued acting in numerous series. Some of her recent projects include “Portlandia,” which ran from 2011 to 2018.\n\nCathy Lee Crosby\n\nCathy Lee’s first screen appearance was on an episode of “It Takes a Thief” in 1968. By the time the ‘70s rolled around, she was a frequent guest on popular TV shows such as “Barnaby Jones”(1973) and “Cannon” (1971). She was also cast as Wonder Woman in a 1974 pilot TV movie of the same name.\n\nThe movie performed well ratings-wise but failed to take off. Cathy is best known as the co-host of “That’s Incredible,” an ABC show that aired between 1980 and 1984. Cathy is still active both in front and behind the camera.\n\nAngie Dickinson\n\nAngie Dickinson is best known for playing Sergeant Suzanne “Pepper” in “Police Woman” (1974), a show that definitively flipped the script on character portrayal in films. The show not only had a woman playing a cop, but she was also the lead character! Angie played a pivotal role in ushering in a new era where movies had fierce female leads.\n\nThink “Charlie’s Angels” (1976) and “The Bionic Woman” (1976). She’s acted in numerous shows over the years and made a cameo in “Ocean’s 11” (2001). Lest we forget, Cathy was part of the original “Ocean's 11” in 1960.\n\nLynda Day George\n\nLynda Day George began making TV appearances and modeling at age 12.

Lynda stopped working after her husband died suddenly from a heart attack in 1983. She has worked only occasionally since then.\n\nErin Gray\n\nThe world first noticed Erin Gray after she began appearing in numerous commercials, from Breck Shampoo to RC Cola – Erin soon became one of the most recognizable faces on TV. She later made guest appearances on “Police Story” (1973) and “Gibbsville” (1976). In 1978, Erin transformed film tropes with her powerful portrayal of Colonel Wilma Deering in “Buck Rogers in the 25th Century.”\n\nA strong woman lead was an alien concept back then. Fans will remember her as Commodore Gray in “Star Trek Continues” (2013). Erin currently runs her agency “Heroes for Hire,” which specializes in booking engagements for sci-fi and fantasy stars.\n\nShelley Hack\n\nShelley Hack began her showbiz career as the face of Revlon and the company’s signature perfume then, Charlie. But Shelley’s rise to stardom began in 1976 when she appeared in season 4 of “Charlie’s Angels” to replace Kate Jackson. Shelley played the beautiful and sophisticated Tiffany Welles. Fans of the original Angels felt she didn’t fit.\n\nShelley left the show, but not before criticism for its failing ratings. The blame wasn’t hers entirely since the show continued performing poorly. She’s still active in the industry through her production company, Smash Media.\n\nMariette Hartley\n\nMariette Hartley began her foray into stage and film in the ‘60s – but her career took off when she starred in a series of commercials with James Garner throughout the ‘70s.

Jayne made guest appearances in cult shows of the ‘70s such as “Starsky and Hutch” (1975), “Kojak” (1973), “Shaft” (1971), and “The Six Million Dollar Man” (1973).\n\nJayne made history again in 1978 when she became NFL Today’s first female sportscaster – a space that was and continues to be notoriously male-dominated. Since then, she’s won an Emmy and anchored more shows.\n\nAudrey Landers\n\nAudrey Landers's first TV appearance was in “The Merv Griffin Show” (1962). She studied music at Juilliard and majored in psychology at Columbia University. In her heyday, Audrey made numerous TV appearances, including roles in “Emergency!” (1972), “Police Woman” (1974), and “Happy Days” (1974).\n\nAudrey also guest-starred in shows such as “Fantasy Island” (1978), “Battlestar Galactica” (1978), and “Love Boat” (1976). She’s probably best known today for her role in “Dallas” (2012), where she played Afton Cooper. She continues making music and performs in concerts the world over.\n\nJudy Landers\n\nJudy Landers might be best known for playing the role of ditzy blondes, but the actor is far from it in real life. Judy and her sister, Audrey, created an award-winning kids’ show called the “Huggabug Club” in 1996 and “The Treehouse Club” in 1997. Together, they wrote almost 150 songs for the show.\n\nIt was a far cry from some of Judy’s first TV appearances, such as Boom Boom on “Happy Days” (1977). You might know her as Stacks in “BJ and the Bear (1979). She’s appeared in “The Love Boat” (1977), two episodes of “Charlie’s Angels” (1978), and “The Jeffersons” (1979), among others.\n\nCarol Lynley\n\nCarol Lynley began her career as a child model before pursuing acting at age 15.

Carol sadly died of a heart attack at her home in California in 2019.\n\nLee Meriwether\n\nLee is an actor, former model, and a Miss America pageant winner (1955). You might remember her best as Betty Jones on “Barnaby Jones,” which ran from 1973 to 1980.

She also joined “Mission Impossible” in 1969 when she replaced Barbara Bain. The star continues acting on TV, in films, and on stage.\n\nSuzanne Pleshette\n\nSuzanne Pleshette began her theater career in 1957.

Pleshette underwent major surgery in 2006 as part of her ongoing lung cancer treatment. The actor sadly passed away due to respiratory failure on January 19, 2008.\n\nStefanie Powers\n\nStefanie Powers, at age 15, was widely considered one of the brightest up-and-coming stars of the time. She signed with Columbia Pictures, but her movie career was short-lived. Stefanie traded acting in films for the small screen instead.\n\nShe is probably best known for her memorable portrayal of Jennifer Hart on the television series \"Hart to Hart\" (1979–1984). Powers also made several appearances in “The Rookies” (1972), “The Mod Squad” (1968), and “Banacek” (1972).\n\nCatherine Schell\n\nAmerican and UK audiences know her best as Catherine Schell, but she was born Katherina Freiin Schell von Bauschlott. The star graced television screens in the ’70s as Maya on the sci-fi series “Space 1999” (1975-1977). You remember Maya. The character could shape-shift into any life form and remain that way for under an hour.\n\nOnce the series ended, Catherine also became a Bond girl in the 1969 film “On Her Majesty's Secret Service.” She has since starred in musicals, reality shows, and numerous feature films.\n\nCarol Wayne\n\nCarol Wayne's movie career in the ’60s. She appeared in popular shows like “I Dream of Jeannie” (1965), “The Man From U.N.C.L.E.” (1964), and “I Spy” (1965). Carol’s career skyrocketed in the ‘70s when she appeared in “Mannix” (1967-75) “Emergency!” (1972), and “Love American Style\" (1969-74).\n\nMost of us remember her for playing the Matinee Lady with Johnny Carson on “The Tonight Show” (1962-92).

There were no signs of foul play.\n\nNatalie Cole\n\nNatalie Cole, daughter of jazz legend Nat King Cole, was a teen when her father tragically died. Despite that, Natalie found her voice as an R&B artist. The singer rose to prominence during the ‘70s with her gold-certified debut album “Inseparable” (1975), which gave us songs like \"Inseparable\" and \"This Will Be\".\n\nIn 1991, she returned with \"Unforgettable… With Love\", her best-selling album to date. The album included a 1951 recording of Nat King Cole, remixed so Natalie could sing a duet. The album won her a Grammy for Album of the Year, and the duet took home three Grammy Awards.\n\nGwen Dickey\n\nBritish singer Gwen Dickey is best known as the lead singer of the group Rose Royce (formerly known as Magic Wand). In 1976, Rose Royce released “Car Wash,” which sold over a million copies in the US and reached No. 1 on the Billboard Charts.\n\nThe group followed it up with other hits like “I Wanna Get Next to You” (1977) and “Wishing on a Star” (1978). Their second album Rose Royce II: In Full Bloom (1977), went platinum and topped the R&B charts. In 2010, Gwen suffered a spinal cord injury. She may be in a wheelchair today but still performs at concerts.\n\nRoberta Flack\n\nBefore making it big, Roberta Flack was a teacher who sang and played the piano in clubs at night. Roberta was the first artist to win a Grammy for Record of the Year two years in a row for “The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face” (1973) and “Killing Me Softly With His Song” (1974).\n\nRoberta's album, “Killing Me Softly With His Song” earned her a double platinum certification. Over the years, critics derided her music for being middle-of-the-road and lacking finesse. Regardless, her influence in the industry is undeniable. Roberta suffered a stroke in 2018 and has since kept a relatively low profile.\n\nChaka Khan\n\nChaka Khan always had music in her. She grew up in a bohemian family, where three of the five siblings were musically inclined. From 1973 to 1978, Chaka was the frontwoman of the funk band, Rufus. They gave us smash hits like “Tell Me Something Good” (1974) written by Stevie Wonder and “You Got the Love” (1974).\n\nChaka later embarked on a solo career. She released her solo debut album in 1978. It included the hit single “I’m Every Woman” that Whitney Houston would record and re-release in the ‘90s. Chaka continues to perform on stage and has appeared in numerous TV shows.\n\nGloria Gaynor\n\nThe disco era is (in)famous for several things. But if you had to choose something to love, Gloria Gaynor’s music would be it. Her mega-hit “I Will Survive” (1978) was and still is the pick-me-up anthem everyone needs. It’s crazy to think the song was buried on the B-side of another track and almost never saw the light of day.\n\n“Love Tracks” (1978) was her best-selling album overall. The disco resurgence of the mid-90s brought her music to the fore once again. Gloria won her second Grammy in 2020 and continues to perform on stage."
