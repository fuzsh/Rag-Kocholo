        "meta_description": "Find Me Out by Spanking Charlene, released 14 February 2020\n\n1. Find Me Out\n2. I Don&#39;t Wanna Go There\n3. Sugar Love\n4. Burn It Down\n5. Circles\n6. Can&#39;t Let You Go\n7. Too Broke To Go Out\n8. Got Me A Runner\n9. Whiplash\n10. Liar Liar\n\n&quot;Fronted by prowling city-street shout of Charlene McPherson, Find Me Out shares love stories as it pounds out its position in “I Don’t Want to Go There” and slashes up an R&amp;B rhythm with guitar chords for “I Got Me a Runner” while Spanking Charlene hammer out a bar band anthem with “Too Broke to Go Out”.&quot; - The Alternate Root\r\n\r\n&quot;The band is at its best with amps turned up on the more raucous garage rock songs, laced with addictive singalong choruses, like the self-explanatory “Too Broke to Go Out” and “Whiplash,” a timeless song that could have just as likely come out by The Sonics in the ‘60s or an ‘80s era Joan Jett.&quot; - Americana Highways\r\n\r\n\r\n&quot;... seems to retrace the swagger of young Joan Jett, from the punk days of Blondie and CBGB&#39;s, albeit with a hint of bluesy feeling. ..&quot; - Roots Highway\r\n\r\n&quot;This is a convincing mix of rock’n’roll with an occasionally bluesy feel. The overall atmosphere conjures up images of smoky bar rooms (are they allowed anymore?) while the quieter moments have a darker, countrified approach. The female vocals are infused with soul and passion.&quot; - Fear And Loathing\r\n\r\n&quot;When it comes to singers McPherson is a phenomenal one: an outraged, wounded wail like hers only comes around every few years.&quot; - New York Music Daily\r\n\r\nA LITTLE BIT OLDER, A LITTLE BIT WISER, and still not taking your shit.\r\n\r\nWelcome to “Find Me Out” the new record by New York City’s Spanking Charlene. “Find Me Out” continues and refines Spanking Charlene’s catchy songs about life and love in New York City. Whether they are singing about the many faces we all hide behind in “Find Me Out”, the shock of infidelity in “Liar Liar”, the romantic obsession of &quot;Can&#39;t Let You Go&quot; scenes from the summer streets of NYC &quot;Whiplash&quot; or outright anger on &quot;Burn It Down&quot; Spanking Charlene combines hard driving guitar grooves with the soaring vocals of Charlene McPherson.\r\n\r\n“Find Me Out” is also the first Spanking Charlene record to feature their producer/Joan Jett and Steve Earle sideman Eric “Roscoe” Ambel as their 2nd guitarist. Ambel also plays keyboards on the bluesy ballad “Can’t Let You Go” and sings harmony on the Ramonesy “Too Broke To Go Out”.\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of much of the great rock and roll of the last century, the songs were recorded live (easy to do with a singer like Charlene McPherson nailing it on first or second take along with 2 electric guitars, bass and drums) with a few overdubs. Special guests include Nate Schweber lending his Stonesy Let it Bleed-esque harp and Matt Polashek with his sleazy Funhouse era Stooges sax.",
