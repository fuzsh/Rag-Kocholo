        "text": "“I returned to a space in time, before I was nicknamed Tweet, for my new album Charlene. I went back to the basics. I channeled the inspiration I had when I first fell in love with music,” shares Charlene Keys about her eponymous album.\n\nKeys burst onto the scene in the early ’90s as part of Devante Swing’s Swing Mob collective, in the group Sugah, as the beloved songstress dubbed Tweet. The sweet-voiced, R&B-soul artist writes on every song on the 15-track album and teamed up with producers she’s worked with in the past, including Charlie Bereal, Craig Brockman, John “Jubu” Smith, and Nisan Stewart, as well as Missy Elliott and Timbaland on “Somebody Else Will,” in bringing out her signature style and voice that have made her an unforgettable favorite among R&B lovers everywhere. “We make magic every time,” she points out.\n\nFans will love the singles on Tweet’s third studio album and have a special connection to “Won’t Hurt Me” and “Neva Shouda Left Ya,” the sweet love song “Magic,” the confessional “I Was Created for This,” and the upbeat empowerment jam “Somebody Else Will” (feat. Missy Elliott).\n\n“Charlene is 15 tracks of soul music. I feel like in this day and time, the soul of music is missing. I wanted to play a role in bringing that back to the forefront,” Tweet adds.\n\nRead what else she has to say.\n\nWhy were you off the touring circuit?\n\nI had to decide if this was really what I wanted to do. In 2005, when my second album, It’s Me Again, didn’t do so well, I decided to take a step back and get my life back together spiritually and allow God to show me if this is what I was created to do.\n\nWhat have you been working on behind the music scene?\n\nBesides the album, I’ve been working on me. I am comfortable being the woman that I am, the artist that I am and just happy in life. I look forward to other endeavors — whether it’s acting, fashion or however God leads me.\n\nWhen I say these three words, tell me what each means to you:\n\nEat: Rarely. I have a very limited diet.\n\nPray: Every day. That’s communication between you and God.\n\nLove: Love is awesome! It’s new for me. I am expecting it to be awesome. I know I messed up a lot of times in that category. This time I am clear-minded. I am ready to take it on.\n\nYou talk about your connection with God. Who in the ministry has been there for you along the way?\n\nBishop Thomas W. Weeks III played a pivotal role in me getting my life right with Christ. He was my pastor for six or seven years.\n\nHow do you keep a balance with your faith and being in this industry?\n\nIt’s my relationship with God. When I first decided to change my life, I was hard core church. I wouldn’t listen to certain music. God never said we couldn’t do certain things. God is love. You never know how God is going to use you. You never know what place He will put you in. You shouldn’t place limits on yourself. I ask God first, “Is this what you want me to do?” I let Him lead me, guide me and keep me balanced.\n\nWho has been your mentor on this journey?\n\nGod has really led me. I’ve had friends Q and my background singers, my musicians and producers are family. We watch each other’s back. And, my family.\n\nSince you’ve been on your personal journey, out of the public’s eye, there has been a social media revolution, specifically this application called Twitter was introduced. People who are actively engaging on this platform do so in the form of a “tweet.” How has that affected your brand? How do you distinguish yourself?\n\nIt’s hard. When I first saw it and heard something about tweet, I am thinking, “Where am I going to be?” I thought they were talking about me. It’s hard to even find me on Twitter, because they can’t simply search, “Tweet.” I am working my way through it."
