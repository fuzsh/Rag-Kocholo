        "text": "Charlene And The Bluegrass Charlatans – She Don’t Never Fret\n\nGreat songs are great songs, regardless of genre or label. It’s why I find the new album from Charlene & The Bluegrass Charlatans, She Don’t Never Fret, so appealing. Jamie Hoover (Spongetones), John Tatum (Southport Johnny & The Bizzness) and the rest of the “Charlatans” deliver on several levels; the songs are undeniably catchy, the musicianship extraordinary and the choice of covers diverse and interesting.\n\n“Fret” draws from traditional and contemporary sources, making it both fresh and at the same time familiar. That being the case, I’m not sure bluegrass is a sufficient genre label. If I had to assign one, it might be Grassicana. This relatively new term was coined by radio programmers to describe “…music that lies between the progressive sounds of bluegrass and the vast genre of Americana”. Then again, it’s all pop to me – just add banjo and stir.\n\nFor those with only a passing knowledge of bluegrass and Americana, collections like this are a real goldmine. For example, “Live And Die” is my introduction to The Avett Brothers. It’s a first rate pop song hiding behind a bluegrass façade. And It’s irresistible, dammit.\n\n“If You Can’t Be Good Be Gone” showcases John’s voice – which happens to be ideal for this song – and Ken Tatum’s masterful work on banjo. Jamie Hoover takes over lead vocals on “Drinkin’ Dark Whiskey”, an expressive and lyrically timeless song made even better by Spence Hayden’s particularly pleasing piano parts. And those are just a few of thirteen tracks, every one a keeper.\n\nThe Charlatans are: Spence Hayden (keyboards, vocals), Jamie Hoover (doghouse bass and vocals), John Tatum (guitar and vocals) and Ken Tatum (banjo and vocals). By now you’re wondering who Charlene is. Arguably the star of the show, Charlene is the name given to Hoover’s upright bass."
