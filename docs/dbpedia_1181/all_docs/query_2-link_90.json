        "text": "Melbourne dolewave stalwarts Scott & Charlene’s Wedding have announced the release of a new live album, recorded at their last pre-pandemic show at The Tote in January.\n\nThe gig saw the band celebrate ten years since the release of their first album, ‘Para Vista Social Club’, and reunite with ex-guitarist Gill Tucker. UV Race frontman Marcus Reichsteiner joined them on stage for the final song, ‘Live It Up’.\n\nThe setlist was drawn predominantly from their 2019 mini-album ‘When In Rome, Carpe Diem’ and 2016’s ‘Mid Thirties Single Scene’, with favourites ‘Footscray Station’ and ‘Two Weeks’ also featured.\n\n‘Live At The Tote’ will be released digitally, and as a limited edition cassette run of just 150 tapes, on October 2 via Bedroom Suck. It features cover artwork painted by frontman Craig Dermody.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAhead of the release, Scott & Charlene’s Wedding have released the live version of ‘Two Weeks’, the forthcoming record’s opening track. Listen to it below.\n\nLive at The Tote by Scott & Charlene’s Wedding\n\nAfter the Tote show in January, Scott & Charlene’s Wedding said they were not taking live bookings for the immediate future. On the live record, Dermody said he would “cherish this run of Scott & Charlene’s Wedding shows forever. It has been an honour”.\n\nRecommended\n\nIn August however, Dermody held a lowkey livestream performance playing Scott & Charlene songs to farewell a house in North Fitzroy he had lived in for most of the band’s existence. Per an event bio, Dermody played some new material.\n\nScott & Charlene’s Wedding released the mini-album ‘When In Rome, Carpe Diem’ in November last year."
