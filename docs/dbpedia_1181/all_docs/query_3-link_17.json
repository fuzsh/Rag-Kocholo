        "text": "Post by tamed09 on\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=Rd-Ymlhhc7k\n\nSigned to a major label and produced by Missy and Timbaland\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nLooooooong overdue. One of my favorite R&B voices of the past 15 years. It's heavenly.\n\nHer second album wasn't as good as her debut, but I still enjoyed a lot of songs on it.\n\nI could see her having a mini-comeback like Keke Wyatt with the right material.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nExciting. I didn't really like her second album, but I loved her first.\n\nI've been listening to Proceed regularly since she leaked that.\n\nPost by Linnethia Monique on\n\nHopefully this actually materializes. I give her 2nd album a pass because I love Turn Da Lights Off and it brought me one of my favorite Tweet jams, Cab Ride.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nMy favorites on It's Me Again were \"Small Change\" and \"I'm Done\".\n\nPost by tamed09 on\n\nShook Up ft Free should have made the album...I loved thats song\n\nPost by Active Aggressive on\n\nThe only thing I remember from her sophomore album were Turn Da Lights Off (a song that my MOM told me about, LOL. I had completely forgotten about Tweet after her debut), Cab Ride (that sample...), and the ultimate jam Sports, Sex, and Food. That New Orleans flavor...\n\nEither way, I am excited for her comeback because I really enjoy her voice and style.\n\nPost by wavey.✨️ on\n\n\"Call Me\" & \"Turn Da Lights Off\" are my favorite tracks from her.\n\nPost by Heart Shaped Box on\n\n\"You\" is my jam. I stan for this girl so hard. She is deserving of more fame.\n\nPost by SHOOTER on\n\nHer first album is a classic but the second album was a solid B effort. Iceberg, You, Cab Ride, Small Change, Steer and I'm Done are still in regular rotation with me.\n\nPost by Active Aggressive on\n\n\"Call Me\" & \"Turn Da Lights Off\" are my favorite tracks from her.\n\nC-c-c-c-c-CALL ME at the break of dawn. I'll be sure to meet you with no pannies on. My mom loved that one too. Shake it shake it shake it BOUNCE. I was a sucker for those Middle Eastern-sounding beats.\n\nPost by SHOOTER on\n\nShe still resents Call Me but it will forever be one of the best booty call jams of the '00s!\n\nOn another note, somebody needs to unearth the Smoking Cigarettes video and upload it to YT.\n\nPost by Caviar on\n\n\"I'm Done\" is like one of her best songs ever because the lyrics are so real. It's weird because it feels so out of place on It's Me Again when it should have been on \"Southern Hummingbird\". It's so good she left DuBose Music Group and I'm curious who she went with.\n\nHere's a few of my other fav Tweet songs:\n\n\"Oops\"\n\n\"C 4Eva\" - Maxwell raved about it that summer.\n\n\"Always Will\"\n\n\"Beautiful\"\n\n\"Cab Ride\"\n\n\"Love Again\"\n\nPost by Ling-Ling on\n\nWHAT!!!!! This is so exciting. Her voice is just... butter. One of my favorite recent R&B voices.\n\nHer first album had so many killer tracks. But her second album... so bad. Although \"Turn Da Lights Off\" will forever be a jam.\n\nDefinitely looking forward to this, although I'm slightly skeptical about Tim & Missy.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nI know Timbaland's sound isn't everyone's cup of tea these days but has Missy ever gone wrong writing for an R&B singer that can really SANG? Besides I Deserve It that is.\n\nPost by Ling-Ling on\n\nMissy has a good record with female singers, I will admit. Hell, I even like \"I Deserve It,\" haha. She just hasn't produced a lot of work lately, so I'm wondering what she's going to bring. I mean she can barely even get her own music career together.\n\nPost by bat1990 on\n\nI'll believe it when I see it...I've been let down too many times in the past 10 years since It's Me Again.\n\nPost by SHOOTER on\n\nI'll believe it when I see it...I've been let down too many times in the past 10 years since It's Me Again.\n\nI've got confirmation her deal is signed. She left DuBose specifically because they couldn't pull it together to properly release her music (despite DuBose starting the music division of his company specifically for her).\n\nPost by Ginger Spice on\n\nExciting! I enjoy both of her albums. \"Smoking Cigarettes\" is my all-time favorite song by her.\n\nI like \"Turn Da Lights Off\", but I would like it a lot more if Missy didn't take up half of the track with her ad-libs. I had a similar problem with a lot of Missy's productions for Monica.\n\nPost by SHOOTER on\n\nWhy does she resent \"call me\"?\n\nShe more so resents the fact that Elektra pushed it as the second single over Smoking Cigarettes because she felt it pigeonholed her and her sound and the general public never moved beyond that perception of her.\n\nPost by bat1990 on\n\nExciting! I enjoy both of her albums. \"Smoking Cigarettes\" is my all-time favorite song by her.\n\nI like \"Turn Da Lights Off\", but I would like it a lot more if Missy didn't take up half of the track with her ad-libs. I had a similar problem with a lot of Missy's productions for Monica.\n\nIf Aaliyah were still alive, she probably would've said \"Missy! Stop grunting all over these tracks! That's not going on my album\"\n\nPost by Queen of Insomnia. on\n\nMy favorites get signed by major labels in 2010s. First Tamia, now Tweet. YAY. I didn't see that coming. I just wanna celebrate.\n\nPost by Active Aggressive on\n\nabout Aaliyah. Yeah, I have never been a fan of Missy's mannish, guttural grunts on these otherwise great R&B songs either. I actually went back and listened to all of Tweet's second album and in parts it's even stronger than her debut. Can't wait!\n\nPost by Heart Shaped Box on\n\nMissy does suffer from Jermaine Dupri syndrome, but, she's never done any harm to Tweet's music. Their chemistry is on point. Let me also throw my love for Thugman in this mix. That song is a jam and a half, and Missy even delivers a solid cameo.\n\nPost by steevy on\n\n2016?\n\njanuary 2016?\n\nwhy so far away?"
