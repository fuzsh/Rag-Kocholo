        "text": "The Theatre of the Living Arts on South Street in Philadelphia was filled to capacity on a Tuesday night earlier this month — and then some — with very enthusiastic fans who were there to see the group Team Starkid on their Apocalyptour.\n\nDespite the crowdedness of the venue, opening-artist Charlene Kaye asked the audience to crouch down and then jump up as high as they could during her final song, “Animal Love I.” As the entire crowd jumped, they let out a shout of joy and sang along loudly for the rest of the song.\n\n“It’s like the apex of energy of our set, and I like that people are sort of letting go of everything and just having a great time,” Kaye said before the show about the jump. “I like to think that is the moment that everyone who comes to the concert can share together.”\n\nA wonderfully gifted musician, singer and songwriter, Kaye played a fun and high-energy set with songs from her latest album, “Animal Love,” a collection of synth-inspired pop tunes to which one cannot help but dance.\n\nAbout the album, Kaye said she was less methodical with the songs than she was with her previous album and EP.\n\n“With these songs, I wanted to make something that was a bit more instinctual and a bit more immediate,” she said. “I wanted to have it be more about the raw sentiment and the emotions I was feeling at the time.”\n\nThe large crowd at the TLA showed its love for Kaye and her band, the Brilliant Eyes, by cheering enthusiastically and even listening to her perform the beautiful “A Million Years” in silence upon her request.\n\nIt might seem surprising to some that the opening performer would receive just as much adoration as the headlining act. But this is nothing new for Kaye, considering she played an equally incredible set and was very well received by fans when she opened for Starkid during their SPACE Tour last November.\n\nAlong with her music, Kaye, with the help of her sister Liann, has created many music videos, including one for “Animal Love I” that was shot in entirely one take (and definitely worth watching on YouTube). Because of its dreamlike and otherworldly feel, Kaye said she has heard it been described as “Tim Burton, in the nightclub, in space.”\n\nBesides performing, Kaye said exploring cities is her favorite part of touring.\n\n“I love seeing what little we can of the city,” she said. “We don’t always get to see that much, but I’ve always enjoyed finding out a different coffee shop every morning and hopefully trying to see something cool about the city.”\n\nNow that the Apocalyptour is over, Kaye plans to work on a collaboration with her drummer, Dave Scalia, and will be performing Aug. 6 at the North Star Bar in Philadelphia.\n\nFor more information,\n\nvisit www.charlenekaye.com."
