        "text": "Hawaii: Part II is the first album by ミラクルミュージカル, a side project by Joe Hawley, Ross Federman, Bora Karaca, and Cluesnjune. The album was released independently on 12/12/12 at 12:12:12 a.m. Every other Tally Hall member, except for Andrew, would appear on this album: Rob would be the main vocalist on \"Time Machine\", Zubin would be the main vocalist on \"White Ball\", Joe would appear on almost every song and would be a writer and producer, Ross would be a writer and producer, and Bora would be the main vocalist on \"宇宙ステーションのレベル7\" and would also be a writer and producer. The album is categorized under \"Worldwide\" music on Apple Music. (Worldwide music is a Western musical category that encompasses various styles of music from various parts of the world.) The whole album shifts between genres, including pop, rap, and ballads.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe album began to come together immediately following the beginning of Tally Hall's hiatus in fall 2011. Joe worked closely with his co-producers, Ross Federman and Bora Karaca, and recruited additional contributors from across the country to collaborate on the project.\n\nSome of the songs were derived from demos Joe had accumulated as early as 2005, but others were written specifically for the project.\n\nThe project is described as \"the genre of infinity, which is expressed through holograms[1] and features themes of outer space, ancient mysticism, tropical paradise, parallel universes, love, death, and magic.\n\nVocalists and contributors to the album include Rob Cantor, Zubin Sedghi, Madi Diaz, Stephanie Koenig, Cyndi Lynott, Ashley Renee, Charlene Kaye, Shane Maux, Alison Hanna, Andrew Laurich, and Ryan Brady.\n\nTrack Listing[]\n\n# Title Writers Lead Singers Duration 1. \"Introduction to the Snow\" Joe Hawley Joe Hawley 1:41 2. \"Isle Unto Thyself\" Joe Hawley Joe Hawley 3:47 3. \"Black Rainbows\" Ross Federman, Joe Hawley Madi Diaz, Joe Hawley 2:30 4. \"White Ball\" Joe Hawley, Bora Karaca, Zubin Sedghi Zubin Sedghi, Stephanie Koenig 3:35 5. \"Murders\" Joe Hawley Joe Hawley 3:43 6. \"宇宙ステーションのレベル7\" Joe Hawley, Bora Karaca Bora Karaca 3:23 7. \"The Mind Electric\" Joe Hawley Joe Hawley 6:13 8. \"Labyrinth\" Joe Hawley, Shane Maux, Charlene Kaye Shane Maux, Charlene Kaye 2:33 9. \"Time Machine\" Rob Cantor, Joe Hawley Rob Cantor, Joe Hawley 4:12 10. \"Stranded Lullaby\" Joe Hawley, Allison Hanna Joe Hawley 3:43 11. \"Dream Sweet In Sea Major\" Joe Hawley, Bora Karaca, Allison Hanna Joe Hawley 7:00\n\nPre-Order Vinyl[]\n\n# Title Writers Lead Singers Duration 12. Variations on a Cloud Joe Hawley Joe Hawley, Rob Cantor 3:10\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe album's cover art may have been inspired by Silvery Moon, a 1933 animated short film.\n\n\"The Mind Electric\" was originally known as \"Inside the Mind of Simon\" and was recorded as a demo under that title with slightly different lyrics.\n\nThis album was released exactly on December 12th, 2012 (12/12/12) at 12:12 AM, the same day the world was \"supposed to end\" (not to be confused with December 21st, 2012, \"the day the world was supposed to end\").\n\n\"Variations on a Cloud\" features samples and similar melodies from \"Murders,\" \"Isle Unto Thyself,\" \"Dream Sweet in Sea Major,\" and \"Ruler of Everything\".\n\nGallery[]"
