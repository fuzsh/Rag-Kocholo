        "text": "Princess Charlene Wilson/Deárbol is another sea-cret Semi-mer/Half-mer-Chipette, (Semi-mer-Darkette, Semi-mer/Half-mer-Darkette), chipette that appears on The Chipmunks Go Hollywood Album, Rockin' Through the Decades, and Alvin and the Chipmunks 4: Road Chip. In the cartoon, she only had a small speaking part, but in the movie she is voiced by Paris Whitney Hilton.\n\nAlbum and Cartoon:[]\n\nCharlene was actually the start of The Chipettes in 1982, on the Alvin and the Chipmunks' album \"The Chipmunks Go Hollywood\". In this album, Alvin sings a duet with a female character billed as Charlene the Chipette. Charlene is featured on the song You're the One That I Want from the soundtrack of the motion picture Grease. Charlene was depicted on the album cover as having a long, blonde ponytail, and seems to have been the basis for the later character of Brittany. She later made a visual appearance in 1981 before the album in A Chipmunk Christmas as a cameo and in 1990, in\n\nRockin' with the Chipmunks, where she danced and lip-synced in the music video for Crocodile Rock by Elton John.\n\nThe Chipmunk Multi-Verse:[]\n\nCharlene is a part of the Darkettes, and has been trying to get revenge on Brittany and the Chipettes for deserting her when they were young.\n\nEarly Life:[]\n\nCharlene was the first-oldest of the Chipettes, and when their mother was killed by Poachers, she tried to help them escape, but got seperated from them, (during which the Chipettes meet Olivia and was living in the Ophanage), Charlene later found out that they had been \"adopted\" by Olivia and went to try to help them, but Brittany didn't like Charlene, because she was older than Brittany meaning she was in charge, (since Jeanette is too shy for that job), after a fight with Brittany, Charlene left very hurt. and then Whitney met up with her and 'raised' her to be a Darkette. Charlene attempted to capture the Chipmunks, before the Chipettes came on the scene, but failed.\n\nCharlene and the Darkettes:[]\n\nLater in the Darkmunk Universe Charlene and Jeanette Miller, (after they used the Darkcontroller on her), captured many of the Chipmunks and Chipettes, but after James Seville distroyed the Darkcontroller, Charlene escaped along with the rest of the Darkmunks and Darkettes, and promised she will get revenge on the Chipettes.\n\nMovie[]\n\nCharlene hasn't made any appearance in the CGI films.\n\nEarly life[]\n\nIt is seen in a flashback that around the same time The Chipettes we're born in her Aunt Salice's litter she was born to her mother\n\nEliza Deárbol after her 8-year old twin sisters Hazel, (that looks like Jeanette/Cheecka with red hair), and Macemedia, (that looks like Eleanor/Amora with brown hair), who she lives with today after their parents mysetioursly disappeared her aunt also died when she along with her uncle and her cosuins we're captured by poachers leaving The Chipettes as orphans and they also suffred from anmesia.She and 2 of her cosuins were voiced by Nika Futterman as newborns and with a cameo by Kaitlyn Maher as a 5-year old\n\nFilmography[]\n\nRocking Through The Deceades[]\n\nShe sang Crocdile Rock with Jagger\n\nAlvin and the Chipmunks Meet the Darkettes[]\n\nPortrayed by:[]\n\nJanice Karman?, (1981-present)\n\nParis Whitney Hilton, (2013)\n\nNika Futterman, (infant)\n\nTaylor Swift, (young)\n\nSee also[]\n\nw:c:Alvin:Charlene\n\nTrivia[]"
