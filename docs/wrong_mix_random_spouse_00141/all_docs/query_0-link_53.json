        "text": "Ebb and Flow:\n\nthe advances and retreats in the battle\n\nto make children’s books more inclusive and diverse\n\nIBBY Belonging Conference 2014\n\nI was very happy to be introduced at the IBBY conference by Ann Lazim of CLPE and IBBY as a writer, publisher and campaigner – since entering children’s publishing in 1991 I’ve worked hard to make children’s books more inclusive. In fact, very recently I was called a ‘diversity superhero’ by Letterbox Library… (I googled 'female superhero' and I was a bit shocked at what I found, frankly - but that’s a rant for another day*).\n\n...which is not to say I didn't play with them in Photoshop...\n\nI never envisaged that I would grow up to be described as a diversity superhero – I was born and grew up in a small town of about two thousand people on the west coast of Ireland – about as far from multi-cultural, diverse London where I now work as you can get!\n\nI went to a tiny school with only 29 pupils – this is the entire school plus some concerned parents:\n\nI was a reader from very young – I devoured books (and anything else within reach that I could read including the back of the Corn Flakes packet at breakfast …).\n\nMost of the books we had were imported from England, so my reading was peopled with girls called Hilary, Gwendolin, Pamela and Penelope (I’d never heard this name spoken aloud and in my head she was always Pee-ne-pole!).\n\nMy love of reading led me to read for a BA in University College Cork, then a post-graduate qualification in Education, then an MA (a feminist reading of the Gothic novel, The Mysteries of Udolpho).\n\nThis was the late 1980s, years before Ireland’s Celtic Tiger and so, like a quarter of a million other young people leaving the country every year I became an economic migrant, leaving for England in 1988.\n\nI had decided that I wanted to work in publishing. My teaching qualifications were not recognized in the UK and in any case I’d become interested in publishing, and in particular in feminist publishing while studying for the MA.\n\nThe first thing I joined was Woman in Publishing – in those days, we couldn’t search the internet, and WiP had an extremely useful directory, ran courses and other events to help women in publishing to network and progress. I also bought Rolling their Own and In other Words.\n\nWhat amazes me now, looking at these, is the amount of feminist publishers and magazines and pamphleteers there were (including the wonderful Older Feminists’ Newsletter and the Older Lesbians’ Newsletter – there’s one for all the 20 somethings who think they invented feminism!!) I know some have been replaced with blogs and other internet forums, but sadly, many have gone…\n\nYou can see from my little annotations how many I applied to and, while I didn’t get called for any interviews, I was heartened to be invited in for advice and a chat more than once.\n\nIn fact, it was my teaching qualifications and experience that got me my first job – as an editor with NFER-Nelson (where I worked for two years and edited the UK’s first SATs). I felt that if I got some solid editorial experience, I could then do another round of applications…\n\n1990\n\nLetterbox Library Conference –\n\nEquality and Diversity in Children's Books\n\nThen came my Damascus moment. I don’t quite know how I came to hear about it, but I went to a Letterbox conference.\n\nHearing all the passionate speakers I realized that while it might be exciting and invigorating to work in feminist or academic publishing, it would be publishing, so to speak, for the converted. But, if I were to move into children’s publishing, I would have a chance to influence young minds and perhaps to help create the feminist readers of the future!\n\nAnd so began a course of reading which brought together my two passions: child development and politics.\n\nI love that she names the ‘stereotypes of physically perfect, white, middle-class children who live with mum and dad’ as a ‘patriarchal notion of what is normal’ (as opposed to the apolitical justifications which are routinely trotted out nowadays – we were confident about our political language in 1986!). Halliday also said she wanted ‘men to write and present alternative images of themselves and boys’ lives, to the macho, role-playing stereotypes of Tarzan, or, daddy out washing the car.’\n\nShe went on to say, ‘Feminist children’s books must show the multiracial society in this country, in which children and woman live in different classes and are affected by race and class divisions. The books must explain how people live in different ways here and all over the world…’\n\nThis challenged my thinking. I regarded myself as someone whose feminist politics fed a desire for equality across class and race, but I had not given as much thought to the effect of stereotypical images on the development of young Black children as I had, for example, thought about their impact on young girls.\n\nShe talks at length about two librarians (p20) who began to respond to the mismatch between ethnic minority readers and the books that were available in Britain in the 1970s. Janet Hill and Judith Elkin provided bibliographic information on children’s books that took account of racial and cultural diversity to enable teachers, librarians and others working with children to find these books.\n\nBut they also highlighted the dearth of material available and, with others, set about improving the supply and creating demand. Klien notes that Judith Elkin ‘had far more to choose from in her 1983 series of six articles for the journal Books for Keeps: ‘Multicultural books for children’.\n\nThis groundswell of research, consciousness raising and demand for better material was garnering a positive response. Publishers like Frances Lincoln, A&C Black, Gollancz, Magi, Soma, Tamarind and Child’s Play published strongly diverse lists and even mainstream publishers like Penguin and Puffin made a real effort, as described in Books for Keeps. In September 1988, their News section celebrated Puffin’s ‘three new booklists’: Equality Street (multi-cultural listings); Ms Muffet Fights Back (non-sexist listings) both compiled by Susan Adler, an Equal Opportunities Librarian, and Special Needs (compiled by Beverley Mathias, Director of the National Library for the Handicapped Child). These were listings (under the three headings) of books published or about to be published by Puffin.\n\nI was lucky to be part of this wonderful momentum as I got my first job in children’s publishing in Child’s Play at the end of 1991.\n\n1991\n\nIn 1991, also following that life-changing Letterbox conference, I joined The Working Group Against Racism in Children’s Resources. Sitting alongside Verna Wilkins, Nandini Mane, Abiola Ogunsola, Steph Smith, Eileen Brown, Asha Kathoria, Rita Mitchell, Lorna Stoddart, Robert Roach and Felicity Weitzel (among so many others who gave of their time) I learned so much.\n\n1993\n\nGuidelines and Selected Titles 100 Picture Books\n\nchosen by the Working Group Against Racism in Children's Resources\n\nIn 1992, we came to the conclusion that, in addition to campaigning against racism (Little Black Sambo was still widely distributed at the time), the time had come to celebrate publishers who were producing books we would be happy to promote to schools and libraries. We set about producing Guidelines and Selected Titles and were thrilled to hit a magic 100 books we were happy to stand by.\n\nThe Working Group was invited by publishers, editors, teachers and many others to give workshops based on the selection, and on the criteria, and the book collection itself was available for use at conferences, courses etc. In fact, it was so successful that we followed it with a second, up-dated publication in 1996 with an introduction by James Berry.\n\nBetween 1991 and 2002 my own working life had also been moving forward. I had freelanced for Verna Wilkins at Tamarind, worked at Victoria House Publishing in Bath, at Readers Digest and at Frances Lincoln. In 1995 I was asked to start a new list for DeAgostini Editions and it was wonderful to be able to start a fresh list that I hoped could be inclusive from the beginning.\n\nThe list was successful, but the Italian owners decided to shut it down after only two years.\n\nThe Sales Director and I did a management buy-out in 1997 (a learning experience in itself) and started Zero to Ten publishing, which in turn was bought by Evans Brothers.\n\nIn 2002 I was made redundant and in 2004 started my own small imprint Alanna Books.\n\n2004\n\nCultural Diversity & Publishing is in the news\n\nHe went on to say that ‘the book industry is much engaged at present with the project of “expanding the market” and that publishing would have to adapt (by becoming more diverse) in order to reach changing audiences.\n\nThis message, that publishing needed to get more diverse not just because it was the right thing to do, but because it would lead to commercial success, was, I thought, a great step forwards.\n\nIt seemed that we’d won the moral arguments and now the commercial ones too - it kicked into touch any counter arguments that diversity was a ‘nice to have’ luxury.\n\nA less rosy picture was painted by Are you simpatico? by Benedicte Page. In it, Andrea Levy argued that despite successes of Zadie Smith’s White Teeth and Monica Ali’s Brick Lane, ‘Black writers need to be better than their white counterparts to be accepted for publication.” The article also bemoaned the fact that publishers are happier with novels that deal with issues of race, effectively ghettoizing writers.\n\nThe Bookseller report was followed swiftly by the launch of the Diversity in Publishing Network (DipNet) to tackle the issues raised by the report.\n\n2006\n\nDespite the rather odd cover (Wake up to a new Britain – like these children had just appeared out of nowhere!) it full of interesting articles.\n\nIn Challenge of the culture club Verna Wilkins of Tamarind said the difficulty was not in teaching Black and other minority ethnic children to read, but in getting them to continue to read when ‘they cannot identify with the material they are presented with, or because the book’s context and curriculum exclude them’. While this was not news to those of us actively campaigning in the area, it was progress to see it in a mainstream trade journal.\n\nVerna Wilkins also spoke about the dozens of manuscripts submitted to her publishing company by parents telling her that ‘they haven’t found suitable books, so they have attempted to write some themselves.’ This issue of demand outstripping supply was also raised in Young and Demanding.\n\nIn fact Jenny Morris owner of the Lion and the Unicorn bookshop said ‘the interest in publishing that kind of book for the general consumer market has almost disappeared’ naming ‘a few brave publishers such as Frances Lincoln’ as continuing to publish culturally diverse books.\n\nI remember reading this in disbelief – 25 years on from the librarians Janet Hill and Judith Elkin first raised the issue of demand outstripping supply and a) we’re still here and b) it seems we’d already peaked and I’d missed it!\n\nWhat was positive was development and growing maturity of that demand. It seemed to me that not only was demand outstripping supply, but that young readers were looking for a more complex, nuanced, mature and sophisticated read than what was on offer.\n\nYoung teenagers (themselves growing up in diverse classrooms) who were interviewed by the report bemoaned the mono-ethnic approach of books that focused on one race or culture. As one teen eloquently put it, ‘we’re not integrated enough in books – publishers aren’t letting us mix in.’\n\nLiterary agent, Jennifer Luithlen, spoke highly of Bali Rai’s work as appealing not just to Asian children but to all British teenagers. Another teen in The culturally diverse young article added, ‘the reason why people don’t want to read ethnic writers is because they think they’re going to drone on about racism’ echoing the comments in the previous report by Benedicte Page about publishers expectations that BME writers should only write about BME issues.\n\nThe Bookseller report was followed swiftly by plans for a Books for All initiative to run the following year. Booksellers agreed to devote store space for BME writing during May and June 2007.\n\nSo, while I was disappointed at the need to restate some, by now, very old arguments, I was VERY excited that the book industry seemed to be accepting the commercial as well as the moral arguments for inclusion and taking positive, practical actions. It seemed to me that the Books for All campaign was limited in its one-month duration, but it was hoped that this would be a pilot for future initiatives.\n\nI was also excited that the demand of readers was growing and maturing – it seemed to me that important as consciousness-raising was, there was a growing appetite for books which were what I would call naturally diverse and inclusive; which were not about race or focused on minority issues but rather had regular stories which just happened to feature a BME character or family. For me, it had always been important that BME children (and girls and LGBT characters and those with disabilities) had a right to be in any story (and to be the hero).\n\nThen in June 2006 the Arts Council organized the Diversity Matters conference.\n\n2006 - Diversity Matters Conference"
