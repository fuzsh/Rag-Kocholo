        "text": "Examples of citing someone who is not the author of the source are:\n\nA person the author has interviewed and/or quoted\n\nA source of information that includes part of a written speech or statement\n\nA person speaking in a video, film, broadcast or audio recording\n\n(This should not be confused with citing a source that an author has cited in their work. This is known as secondary referencing. Please see the section on 'Secondary sources' for instruction on how to cite secondary references.)\n\nWhen citing someone who is not the author of the source, you should introduce the person in your writing as their name is not included in the bracketed citation.\n\nSummary/paraphrase\n\nBelow is an example of a summary of a quote by Angela Rayner which appeared in the following Guardian online news article written by Coughlan in 2017.\n\nCoughlan, S. (2017) 'Budget: Heads say extra maths cash is 'drop in ocean'.' The Guardian. [Online] 22nd November. [Accessed on 24th November 2017] http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42081388\n\nThe bracketed citation for the article would be formatted as (Coughlan, 2017) and the summary could be presented as follows:\n\nIn relation to the Chancellor’s 2017 Autumn budget announcement regarding extra funding for schools, Labour’s shadow education secretary Angela Rayner stated in a recent news article, that this by no means addresses the significant cuts in school funding over the last two years (Coughlan, 2017).\n\nDirect quote\n\nWhen citing a direct quote by someone who is not the author of the source, you should introduce the person in your writing, use double quotation marks for the quote, rather than the usual single quotation marks for direct quotes by the author of the source, and add the page number within the bracketed citation, or, for sources without a page number (ie online sources) use the word online in place of the page number, as shown in the example below.\n\nIn relation to the Chancellor’s 2017 Autumn budget announcement regarding extra funding for schools, Labour’s shadow education secretary Angela Rayner stated in a recent news article, that \"the schemes announced today are a tiny fraction of the money he has cut from school budgets since 2015 and despite his spin, schools will be worse off by 2020\" (Coughlan, 2017:online).\n\nDirect quote from a video/film/broadcast\n\nWhen citing a person speaking in a video, film, broadcast or audio recording and they are not the author of the source, you should introduce the person in your writing, use double quotation marks for the quote and also include the start time at which the words were spoken (in minutes and/or seconds) within the bracketed citation.\n\nThe example direct quote below is taken from a YouTube video of a recording of a presentation:\n\nIn an NSCA conference presentation, Ian Jeffreys stated that \"speed and agility will play a major role in the vast majority of team and court sports\" (National Strength and Conditioning Association, 2016:1 min 4).\n\nThe reference for which would be as follows:"
