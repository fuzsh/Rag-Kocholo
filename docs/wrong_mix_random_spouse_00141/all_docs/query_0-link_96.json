        "text": "Dowse will leave his post - which he started on January 1 2020 - in March 2022.\n\nPrior to joining the USTA, he was Wilson Sporting Goods Co. President for six years.\n\nDuring his tenure, the USTA hosted COVID-19-impacted US Opens in 2020 and 2021.\n\nIn 2020, games were played without spectators, before fans were welcomed back this year, although those attending had to prove they had at least one dose of the coronavirus vaccine.\n\n\"The USTA is now in a strong position for the future,\" he said in a statement announcing his departure.\n\n\"I am confident I will be leaving it in good hands and well-positioned for success.\n\n\"I want to thank our Board, the USTA staff, our many volunteers, and the wide community of people who love and play tennis, for making possible the success we have had.\n\n\"Working together, we demonstrated that tennis is the model sport, not only for safe and fun recreation during a pandemic, but also for a lifetime.\"\n\nUSTA chairman of the Board and President Michael J McNulty said: \"We want to thank Mike for his deep commitment to tennis and the steady hand he showed at a time of extraordinary challenge and uncertainty.\n\n\"He helped navigate the USTA through two years of pandemic, staged two US Opens at a time when many thought it would be impossible, and helped refocus the USTA on its mission of growing the sport at the local level.\"\n\nDowse will assist with the transition until his departure on March 1 2022, during which the USTA Board will conduct its search for a new chief executive, the USTA claimed."
