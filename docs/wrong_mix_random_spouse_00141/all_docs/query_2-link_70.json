They showed up in their own work, usually a brief moment but a fun Easter Egg for people in the know.\n\nBut recently, some mystery writers are taking that self-insertion to a new level: the author is a protagonist (or a major character) in their own work. That means that the narrator shares the name of a character in the work.\n\nSometimes these works are called author surrogates or even author avatars. Whatever you call them, they do make the reader wonder if the story is true or not. Interestingly, several books make their avatar into someone untrustworthy, which is fascinating!\n\nHere are seven works in which the author is a character in their own work."
