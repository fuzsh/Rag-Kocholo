        "text": "FLUSHING MEADOWS — When videos of press conferences are posted online, they rarely feature everyone in the room. The camera tends to stay fixed on the player, answer questions from discorporated voices off-screen. It’s not unreasonable. Our faces are not the important ones.\n\nBut what it also does is create a sense that every press conference is like a White House press briefing, with reporters almost literally climbing over each other to ask questions. The reality is that most press conferences are fairly empty. Were the camera turned around, it would mostly show empty seats, with eight or nine journalists all sitting in the corner nearest the door because that is where they happened to come in.\n\nThere are a few exceptions to this rule at this US Open: Serena Williams press conferences have been ticketed events and Rafael Nadal is usually standing room only, so bright is their star.\n\nIn tennis, we are in a torch-passing phase. Williams says she has retired; Roger Federer barely plays; each year gets tougher and tougher for the beaten-up body of Rafael Nadal, and at some point Novak Djokovic will start to age. And when these names stop appearing on the draw sheet of grand slams, who then will pack the house at press conferences, and more importantly, in stadiums?\n\nFortunately, the 2022 US Open has shown us who the new superstars of modern tennis are, and the fight for seats to watch either Nick Kyrgios or Coco Gauff talk, let alone play, has become an intense one.\n\nTwo more different characters you probably could not find, albeit what they have in common is their trajectory. Both burst onto the scene as teenagers with signature wins over establish stars at Wimbledon (15-year-old Gauff beat Venus Williams, Kyrgios at 19 beat Nadal), both had a reversion towards the mean while they rounded out their game, and both are now having career-best years at the slams.\n\nBut that is where the similarities end. They are eminently watchable, but for completely different reasons. Watching Kyrgios is an unscripted melodrama filled with jeopardy. When, fans ask themselves, is he going to blow up? Will, they whisper concernedly, he tank a whole set or a match? Could we see the greatest performance of his career?\n\nThat jeopardy creates intrigue – this could be a waste of time or the match of the year. Some of that jeopardy has faded, because this is a more focused Kyrgios than we have ever seen, but nevertheless his quarter-final clash with Karen Khachanov comes with the same caveats as most Kyrgios matches: he’ll win, if he keeps it together, and the feeling is that he just might.\n\n“I just feel like I’m playing for a lot more than myself,” Kyrgios said after downing world No 1 Daniil Medvedev.\n\n“I’ve just got a lot of people, a lot of support, and on the flip side I got a lot of people doubting me and trying to bring me down all the time as well.\n\n“I’ve said it before, I was in this press conference room a while back and I lost in the third round, it was the worst feeling because I’ve just got so much expectation.\n\n“I’m finally able to show it now.”\n\nGauff meanwhile is a phenomenon. She is less a player, more a movement, Generation Z’s social conscience come to life. A TikTok addict with speed around the court, tenacity, a vicious backhand and a willingness to whip up the crowd with a confidence that borders on arrogance, but which then fades away when she steps back over the white line, and is instead replaced by a startling assuredness on almost any topic.\n\nIs she ready to dominate the game though? To be “the new Serena”? To own the sport.\n\nActually, she might not want to.\n\n“I think the thing that makes the WTA Tour special is that when you have somebody like No 1 in the world playing somebody ranked No 100 in the world, people are watching and thinking the No 1 player is going to automatically win,” Gauff said.\n\n“It’s more like, ‘She has a shot, she has a chance’. I think that’s what makes tennis fun because you never know what’s going to happen.\n\n“I think that’s what makes it enjoyable for me. Every day you come up and are ready for the challenge no matter what the ranking is, what the situation is. I think that’s what makes tennis enjoyable for everybody.”\n\nCertainly, not many would have picked her quarter-final opponent Caroline Garcia to be the form player in the world come the final slam of the year, but here we are. The French player has won 12 matches in a row and won two titles on two different surfaces between Wimbledon and the US Open, most recently knocking out three top-10 players en route to the title as a qualifier in Cincinnati.\n\nYou would rarely bet against Gauff though. This young star is ready to add super to her moniker.\n\nOne to watch\n\nArguably there is not a bad match on the schedule on Tuesday, the first day on which all the singles action shifts to Arthur Ashe. Ons Jabeur up against Ajla Tomljanovic though might go under the radar given the star quality involved in the other three matches – but it shouldn’t.\n\nExpected on court around 8pm BST, it will be a clash of styles that should in theory create a fascinating match, as Jabeur’s mix of spins and variety of attack goes up against Tomljanovic’s ball-striking and resilience.\n\nThey have played once before – Jabeur triumphed on the clay of Rome in straight sets – but earlier this year, but arguably both are better players today even since then.\n\nTuesday’s order of play\n\n(All times BST)\n\nArthur Ashe Stadium (from 5pm)\n\nMatteo Berrettini (13) vs Casper Ruud (5)\n\n(Followed by) Ons Jabeur (5) vs Ajla Tomljanovic\n\nArthur Ashe Stadium (from midnight BST)"
