        "text": "Many modern works of Arthurian fiction with an historical (i.e. 'dark-age') setting follow the medieval traditions (of myth, folklore, chronicle, and romance) by sending Arthur and his warriors beyond the shores of Britain. Here I consider a corpus of 29 works, from 1898 to 2008, that meet my strict criteria for 'Arthurian historical fiction'. Two clear trends emerge regarding transmarine Arthurian military activity: its prominence of has greatly increased over time; and The Discovery of King Arthur by Geoffrey Ashe (1985) has been quite influential. I speculate on the socio-historical and other factors that affected authors' decisions to include, or not, a transmarine campaign. I also identify, and illustrate by examples, the five motivations imputed to Arthur for embarking on such adventures. One of these five, loyalty to Rome, has become common since it first appeared in 1983, largely due to Ashe's book. Finally, I discuss how my own published historical research shaped Arthur's Gallic campaign in my own recently published work of historical fiction."
