        "text": "Disney World? Not for Dirk Nowitzki, the NBA Finals MVP and national hero who slayed LeBron James and the Heat’s hated Dream Team.\n\nAccording to a source, the USTA extended an invitation to Nowitzki yesterday to hit at the U.S. Open’s Arthur Ashe Stadium court, as he may be in New York for promotional appearances after reaching the heights of the sporting world with Sunday night’s NBA championship.\n\nThe 6-foot-11 German was a top-notch junior tennis champion before turning fully to basketball during a period his country was desperate to produce the next Boris Becker/Steffi Graf.\n\nNowitzki’s idol growing up in the ’80s wasn’t Magic Johnson but John McEnroe, and he met him for the first time at the Garden in February when the Mavericks toasted the Knicks, 113-97. Nowitzki met McEnroe during pregame warmups and talked of being motivated to produce that evening, scoring 29 points and 11 boards.\n\n“I was like a little kid,” Nowitzki said after the game.\n\nYesterday, McEnroe remembered the meeting and was pulling for Nowitzki — along with much of the free world.\n\n“It was awesome to meet him,” McEnroe said yesterday on a conference call to promote his July 15 World Team Tennis match vs. Jimmy Connors on Randalls Island. “You know I’m a lifelong Knicks fan and I heard afterward he said I had inspired him that night and he burned the Knicks. I guess that was the definition of mixed emotions, watching him dismantle the Knicks while saying good things about me. Certainly I was pulling for him, and to see him win was spectacular.”\n\nNowitzki came to the USTA Pro Circuit men’s event in Dallas in March to watch his German countryman and friend, Rainer Schuettler, play and hit on the courts afterward.\n\nNowitzki is the second European to win the NBA Finals MVP Trophy with Frenchmen Tony Parker beating out James in 2007."
