Description

Get to know three-time Grand Slam singles winner Arthur Ashe in this middle grade nonfiction biography of his early years!

As a kid, Arthur Ashe was so small his father said he wasn’t allowed to play football, so he played tennis instead. He went on to become a professional tennis player—the only black man to win the singles title at Wimbledon, the US Open, and the Australian Open. After contracting HIV from a blood transfusion, Arthur fought to educate people about HIV and AIDS and to fund treatment for the disease until his death in 1993.

This book is laced with numerous illustrations, and the back of the book includes a timeline, questions, activities, and a glossary, making it the perfect addition to a classroom or home school setting. Perfect for emerging readers, the Childhood of Famous Americans series illustrates the incredible true stories of great Americans.
