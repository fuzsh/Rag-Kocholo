        "text": "Steven William Elzemeyer, proud father, devoted son, loyal friend and loving husband died peacefully in his home on Friday, January 23rd with family and friends at his bedside.\n\nSteve was born in St. Louis, Missouri on October 28th, 1955 to Susan Metcalfe and the late Howard W. Elzemeyer. At the age eleven, Steve and his family moved to Richmond, Indiana where Steve spent wonderful years growing up on the family farm. After high school a love of the mountains drew him West of Colorado where he graduated with a degree in Business from the University of Denver in 1978.\n\nThe lure of fresh powder and crisp mountain air brought Steve further west to Jackson Hole in 1979. Steve quickly found work as a bookkeeper for old Jackson businesses like Ski and Sports, Cold Storage, the Bunnery and Sweetwater Deli. After doing a bit of everything for Sweetwater Deli, including shoveling snow from it's roof and washing dishes, Steve was asked to manage the restaurant. Within a short time Steve bought into the business and for over 25 years Steve's warm smile and winning personality was the first thing that greeted every patron of the renamed \"Sweetwater Restaurant\". Along the way, Steve helped make the \"little cabin on the corner\" a local's favorite and a place where visitors loved to dine.\n\nSteve also immersed himself skiing to telemark skiing to sailing and of course to his passion, cycling. It was this huge love of cycling that led Steve to further contrbute to the character of Jackson with his long service as a board member to Friends of the Pathways, a project close to his heart.\n\nSteve will always be loved and remembered as a hero by his wife, Mary Carter Elzemeyer, sons William (12) and Erich (10) and his myriad of friends for his generosity, huge heart, gentle ways and immense bravery. Steve struggled valiantly for over 6 years with a battle against Multiple Myeloma cancer. His family is sure that Steve is now enjoying the best bike ride he could ever have.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations may be made to either Friends of the Pathways or the Oncology Department at St. John's Hospital.\n\nFuneral services will be held on Tuesday, January 27, 2009 at 4:00 P.M. at the Our Lady of the Mountains Catholic Church in Jackson."
