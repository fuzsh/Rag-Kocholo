        "text": "Take me back to October 28, 1955\n\nLet's go back to the fifties.\n\nIt is Friday, October 28, 1955. Babies who are born today will have the star sign Scorpio. People have \"that Friday feeling\" and are excited for the weekend.\n\nThe summer is long gone. Temperatures have become much cooler, and the evenings are beginning to get darker. There is a fresh, earthy scent in the air, and fallen leaves have carpeted driveways, lawns, pathways, and sidewalks. Halloween 1955 is just days away. People are watching horror movies and thinking about which costume they are going to wear. Others are organizing parties.\n\nIn music, the song \"Love Is a Many Splendored Thing\" by The Four Aces is the best-selling record at the moment. Dwight David Eisenhower is the President of the United States, and Sir Anthony Eden is the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. It's 1955, so radio stations and jukeboxes are playing songs from artists such as Perez Prado, Bill Haley & His Comets, Mitch Miller, Roger Williams, Les Baxter, Bill Hayes, The Four Aces, The McGuire Sisters and Pat Boone.\n\nIn fashion, women are sporting chemise dresses, sheaths, sack dresses and straight-cut suits. Short boxy jackets and shift dresses are also beginning to become popular. Meanwhile, a lot of men are sporting a \"Teddy Boy\" style that involves leather jackets, greased-back hair, extremely narrow trousers and velvet-collared jackets. Men are also wearing formal suits as daywear. Tailfins on cars are extremely popular at the moment. The design looks futuristic, almost like a rocket or the twin rudders on the back of an airplane. On TV, people are watching popular shows such as \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", \"The Lone Ranger\", \"I Love Lucy\", and \"Our Miss Brooks\".\n\nChildren and teenagers are watching television shows such as \"Tom and Jerry\", \"Lassie\", \"Adventures of Pow Wow\", and \"Captain Kangaroo\". Popular toys at the moment include Dimestore soldiers, Colorforms, Pitchin' Pal, and Roy Rogers Plastic Figures."
