        "text": "Robert \"Bobby\" William Randall Jr., 68, of Centralia passed away Sunday, December 31, 2023, peacefully in his sleep. He was born on October 28, 1955, the son of Robert Sr. and Wilma (Heytz) Randall in Modesto, California. He married his best friend, co-driver, and love of his life, Gayle Anne Loyd, on her 50th birthday, January 7, 2007, by Reverend Alan Nollman at Grace Church in Centralia.\n\nAlong with his beloved wife, Robert was preceded in death by his parents; a brother, Paul Randall; a niece, Nikkie Howard; his father-in-law, Thomas Barney Loyd; mothers-in-law, Betty (Turner) Loyd, and Evelyn Loyd; brothers-in-law, Tom Loyd, Ron Loyd, Randy Loyd and wife Bonnie McClelland; sisters-in-law, Myra Jean Isom, Shirley Hollingshead, Myrtle Loyd, and Carol Sue Loyd.\n\nSurvivors include his brothers, David and wife Camille Randall of Terre Haute, Indiana, Richard and wife Pat Randall of Hulbert, Oklahoma, James and wife Donna Randall of Richmond, Texas, and Michael and wife Susan Randall of Independence, Kansas; his little sister, Sissy Divinia Howard of Fort Smith, Arkansas; brother-in-law, Marty Loyd and wife Nikki (Porter) of Odin, Illinois; sisters-in-law, JoAnne (Loyd) Daily of DeKalb, Illinois Billie June (Loyd) Hadley of Kileen, Texas, and Alma Strade of Centralia, Illinois; and several nieces and nephews. He loved spending time with them all playing games, building Lincoln Log Forts on the floor, being a kid with them, sharing time, love, and knowledge with them all.\n\nRobert was the oldest of 7 in his family. He looked forward to talking to his brothers and sister on the phone. Robert enjoyed listening to classic rock music. He especially liked Neil Young, and Black Oak Arkansas Band-Harmonica Songs. Robert could play harmonica like no other. He enjoyed playing along with his wife and brother-in-law, Marty during family gatherings. Robert was a retired semi-driver, and instructor, which he loved and through this met the love of his life, Gayle. They teamed up and drove all over the country together. Robert was much like the Travelin' Ramblin' Man in his early years. He finally settled down when he found home in Illinois. He loved his family and his cat, Cali. Robert enjoyed giving the spam, scam callers a run for their money. He would entertain them like a secretary excited to answer the phone all day. He would challenge the scammers so they would hang up on him instead. Robert had a sense of humor that was one of a kind. He will be truly missed.\n\nA graveside service will be held at 2:00 p.m. Wednesday, January 3, 2023, at Hillcrest Memorial Park in Centralia with Dave Albers officiating. Family and friends are invited to gather at the graveside at 1:45 p.m. for a final viewing and visitation time. Memorials may be made in Robert's honor to Grace Church and will be accepted for the family at the Irvin Macz Funeral Home in Centralia. Online condolences and memories of Robert may be shared with the family by visiting and/or on the funeral home's Facebook page."
