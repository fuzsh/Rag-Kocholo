Pete and Clyde waited everyday by the door for him to come home from work.\n\nThomas loved his job. He worked for Schneider Plumbing for 32 loyal years. He took pride in all of his work he did. People trusted Thomas to get the job done right, and he always did. He made many close friends over the years with the company.\n\nOne of Thomas's favorite places to go was to New Waverly. He enjoyed spending time with his brother George and with his Uncle Jake when he was still here with us. He loved being in the country. He loved dancing and listening to country music. He loved God and Jesus. He was a faithful trusting man. When you needed him, he always was there. He loved to have a good time and to laugh with his family. Thomas Pasket was an outstanding man. He had a heart of gold & the soul of a cowboy. He will be dearly missed.\n\nThomas is survived by his wife, Cindy; children Mickie Ferguson and husband Brien, Amanda Alexander and husband Jeff, Patricia Ferguson and husband Bobby, and Thomas Pasket Jr; grandchildren, Madison, Sierra, Brien, Brandon, Cullen, Julie, Jason, Jacob, Daniel, Cindy, David and Thomas Pasket III; and brother George Pasket.\n\nVisitation with the family is scheduled for Wednesday, May 6 from 6-8 PM at Sam Houston Memorial Funeral Home in Willis, with Rosary beginning at 7 PM.
