Walker Jr., pleaded guilty to giving U.S. Navy secrets to the Soviet Union. Walker died in a federal prison in August 2014.\n\nIn 1989, the Oakland A's wrapped up an earthquake-delayed sweep of the World Series over the San Francisco Giants.\n\nIn 2007, Cristina Fernandez became the first woman to be elected president of Argentina.\n\nIn 2010, China announced it had built what experts said was the world's fastest supercomputer, capable of a sustained performance 40% greater than the previous record holder built in Oak Ridge, Tenn.\n\nIn 2022, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul Pelosi, was assaulted after an assailant broke into their San Francisco home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA thought for the day: \"Tomorrow is the first blank page of a 365 page book. Write a good one.\" -- American country singer Brad Paisley"
