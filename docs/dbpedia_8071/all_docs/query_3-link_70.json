        "text": "William Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is an American businessman and philanthropist who is the co-founder of Microsoft and longtime acquaintance of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.\n\nEducation[]\n\nGates scored 1590 out of 1600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SAT) and enrolled at Harvard College in the autumn of 1973.[1] He chose a pre-law major but took mathematics and graduate level computer science courses.[2] While at Harvard, he met fellow student Steve Ballmer. Gates left Harvard after less than two years while Ballmer stayed and graduated magna cum laude. Ballmer would later succeed Gates as Microsoft's CEO in 2000.[3][4]\n\nCareer[]\n\nIn 1972, Gates and classmate Paul Allen formed a venture called Traf-O-Data to make traffic counters based on the Intel 8008 processor.[5]\n\nMicrosoft[]\n\nGates left Harvard to co-found Microsoft on April 4, 1975 with Paul Allen to pursue an opportunity to develop a BASIC interpreter for the Altair 8800.[5]\n\nIn 1983, Apple Computer co-founder Steve Jobs invited Gates to preview the pre-release development of the Macintosh. After Jobs was forced out and Microsoft had released Windows 2.0 with a GUI that was similar to the Mac, Apple Computer, under CEO John Sculley, filed a federal lawsuit in 1988 against Microsoft.[6][7]\n\nAfter Jobs returned to a financially troubled Apple Computer, he negotiated an end to the lawsuits with Microsoft and agreed to cross-license technology between the two companies in exchange for Microsoft's commitment to continue developing software such as Microsoft Office for the Mac and an investment of $150 million in Apple non-voting stock. Apple also agreed to include the Microsoft Internet Explorer web browser by default with future Mac OS releases for the next 5 years. Though the joint announcement by Jobs and Gates was met with shock at Macworld Expo Boston in 1997, the investment from Microsoft helped save Apple from bankruptcy.[6]\n\nIn 2019, the Microsoft board of directors hired an outside law firm to investigate allegations that Bill Gates had been carrying on an affair with a Microsoft employee. He resigned from the board in March 2020 before the investigation had been completed.[8] Current Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella responded by stating that the \"Microsoft of 2021 is very different from the Microsoft of 2000\".[9]\n\nAfter Microsoft[]\n\nIn 2000, Gates and his wife Melinda had combined three family foundations and donated stock valued at US$5 billion to create the charitable Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. It was identified as the world's wealthiest charitable foundation in 2013, with assets reportedly valued at more than $34.6 billion at the time.[10][11] As of November 2019, foundation indirectly owned $1.8 billion worth of Apple stock through its investment in Berkshire Hathaway.[12] On May 3, 2021, Gates announced that he and Melinda were divorcing,[13] leaving the future of their foundation in question.[14] Melinda had reportedly hired divorce lawyers after discovering that Bill had been associating with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.[15]\n\nMedia portrayal[]\n\nGates was portrayed by Anthony Michael Hall in the television dramatization Pirates of Silicon Valley.[16]\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]"
