        "text": "Fingerprinting\n\nNature magazine published the first article to advocate the use of fingerprinting for criminal investigations.\n\nFingerprints were used in ancient history, with the Babylonian king Hammurabi (reigned 1792-1750 BCE) noting that law officials would take the fingerprints of people who had been arrested.\n\nThey were also used in ancient China to authenticate government documents.\n\nIn 1788, German anatomist Johann Christoph Andreas Mayer became the first European to recognize that fingerprints were unique to each individual.\n\nIn 1880, Henry Faulds, now known as the \"Father of Fingerprinting,\" was the first to suggest using fingerprints for criminal investigations.\n\nFingerprints are fairly unique to individuals and even identical twins who share DNA will have unique fingerprints.\n\nStatue of Liberty\n\nThe 151-foot-high gift from the French people is dedicated. The French donated the Statue of Liberty, but the U.S. was responsible for building its pedestal. In 1884, the governor of New York Grover Cleveland vetoed a bill to provide $50,000 for the project. An attempt the following year to have Congress provide the $100,000 necessary to complete the project also failed. The New York committee, with only $3,000 in the bank, was unable to build the pedestal. With the project in jeopardy, other American cities offered to pay the full cost of erecting the statue in return for relocating it to their city. However, publisher Joseph Pulitzer of the New York World, started a donation drive that drew more than 120,000 contributors, most of whom gave less than a dollar, raising $102,000. With those funds, construction of the pedestal began.\n\nIronically, Grover Cleveland, who vetoed funding for the pedestal while governor of New York, was now U.S. President and presided over the dedication, which included New York's first ticker-tape parade.\n\nIts famous poem, by Emma Lazarus, inscribed at the base contains the famous lines,\n\n\"Give me your tired, your poor,\n\nYour huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\"\n\nEmperor Constantine Converts to Christianity\n\nConstantine I wins the Battle of the Milvian Bridge and converts to Christianity. According to some accounts, he received instructions in a dream to paint the Christian monogram on his troops' shields, thus fighting the battle in the name of the Christian God. Other accounts say he saw a cross in the heaven bearing the expression \"In this sign conquer.\" The Arch of Constantine, celebrating this victory, attributes Constantine's success to divine intervention; however, it does not display any overtly Christian symbolism.\n\nThis was a turning point in Christianity, as Constantine would go on to legalize and support the Christian faith.\n\nJonas Edward Salk\n\nBorn October 28, 1914 d. 1995\n\nAmerican physician, scientist. He discovered a polio vaccine in 1953, saving thousands from the crippling disease. In 1952 alone, polio paralyzed 21,000 people and killed 3,100.\n\nSalk chose to not patent the vaccine in order to maximize its distribution. When asked who owned the patent, Salk replied, \"Well, the people I would say. There is no patent. Could you patent the sun?\" It is estimated the patent would have been worth billions had it been patented."
