        "text": "Click to add description. Lorem ipsum dolor sit ame Bill Gates was born on October 28, 1955 in Seattle, Washington, United States. When he was 14 years of age he started his first company and later dropped out of Harvard University to launch Microsoft Corporation which was to become the largest computer software company in the world. Gates entered Harvard University in 1973, but he left after a year and a half. Meanwhile his friend Allen had driven to Harvard to show Bill a 1975 issue of Popular Mechanics that focused on a cheap microcomputer. Gates and Allen wrote a basic interpreter for the computer and sold it to the manufacturer before the program was even finished. Luckily for Gates, the demonstration worked. Gates then dropped out of college and he and Allen formed Microsoft Corporation. Gates married Melinda French, a Microsoft manager, on New Year’s Day in 1994. People said that his work relaxed after his marriage to French and the birth of their children. Gates decided to do more for the world and created The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation with his wife. In December of 2005 the foundation announced that they would disburse $84.3 million in accord to Save the Children and the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health, for programs that fight infant mortality in developing countries. In that same month Gates, along with his wife Melinda and U2 singer Bono, were named Time’s Person’s of the year for their charitable work toward decreasing poverty and disease throughout the world. In 2007 Gates personal worth was estimated at more than $57 million dollars making him the richest man in the world for the 13th straight year, according to Forbes. That has made Gates and his wife one of the most prominent philanthropists in the world. In June of 2008, Gates stepped down as a full-time employee of Microsoft in order to give more time to managing the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. He stayed as Microsoft's non-executive chair, and he also worked part-time on big projects for the company. Meanwhile, the foundation continued to work in the areas of education and health. In 2009, Gates told Maria Bartiroma inBusiness Week, \"It's been great to get more time with the scientists, more time out in the field. These are intense, complex issues ...it's really drawn me in. And I find the same magic elements that made me love my work at Microsoft.\""
