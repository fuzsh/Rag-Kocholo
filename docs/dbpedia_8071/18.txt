Background

William Henry Gates III, most known as Bill Gates, was born on October 28, 1955. Gates was born and raised in Seattle, Washington, in a wealthy family. His father, William H. Gates Sr., was a successful lawyer. His mother, Mary Maxwell Gates, was an executive and businesswoman. Mary Gates served on the board of directors for multiple companies. Gates has two sisters, Libby and Kristianne. Growing up, Gates’ parents were strict and encouraged him to win at everything he tried; Gates was rewarded for winning and penalized for losing. Gates attended Lakeside Prep School. When he was 13 years old, he wrote his first programming code. The code was a tic-tac-toe game that the user could play against the computer. Gates fell in love with software programming and how perfectly a machine interpreted codes.

At 17, Gates founded his first I.T. company, “Traf-O-Data.” It was a partnership with Paul Allen. The company had only minor success, but what Gates and Allen learned from it was invaluable to create years later the company Microsoft, one of the biggest companies in the world. In 1973, Gates enrolled at Harvard College. He dropped out of Harvard two years later in 1975. This would be the same year Gates and Allen co-founded Microsoft in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Gates became the president and C.E.O. of Microsoft.

In 2014, Gates stepped out of his part-time job at Microsoft to dedicate his full time to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Gates was married to Melinda French from 1994 to 2021. The couple had three kids: Jennifer, Rory, and Phoebe.
