Crime was then, as it is now, a central problem for the inhabitants of Mexico’s capital. Understanding and preventing it was a key aspect of the interactions between the state and all social groups. Its causes and consequences aﬀected many parts of everyday life. A history of crime is, therefore, a history of the city and its inhabitants. Since the diﬃcult years that followed independence from Spain in 1821, violence and crime marked the nation’s growth. Insurgency and the royalist reaction devastated the economy of the country. There followed years of instability, military uprisings, civil wars (leading to the Reforma War, 1857– 1861), foreign invasions (most importantly by the United States, in 1847, and France, 1861–1867), and multiple constitutional experiments oscillating between liberal federalism and conservative centralism. Independence also brought forth uncontrollable banditry around highways and uncertainty regarding the survival of judicial institutions. Things clearly began to change with the 1867 restoration of the 1857 Constitution, the passing of civil and criminal codes in the early 1870s, and Porﬁrio Díaz’s ascension to the presidency in 1876. The Porﬁrian regime (1876–1911) managed to control banditry and political dissent, guarantee the interests of foreign investors, and enforce liberal legislation on property, with the resulting dispossession of large numbers of peasants and the accumulation of wealth by national elites. Both facts contributed to renewed population growth in the capital and rising crime rates (see appendix, table 1) despite the state’s activism vis-à-vis social reform through the strengthening of police, penalties, and prisons.1\n\n2\n\nCity of Suspects\n\nThe 1910 centennial celebration of independence, centered on Mexico City, seemed to demonstrate in the eyes of the world the civilization and stability achieved by the country. But the neat scheme of science and order set forth by the late Porﬁrian ruling group could not avoid a revolution. In that year, Francisco I. Madero issued a call to arms after Díaz persisted in imposing his own reelection. What began as a democratic rebellion triggered an uprising fueled by Madero’s vague promise of justice—interpreted both as the restitution of lands to communities and as a penal and judicial reform. Throughout the country, political conﬂict turned into social revolution had a high economic cost and meant the loss of nearly a million lives. Although the parties of the civil war did not give Mexico City great strategic signiﬁcance, beginning in 1913 its population nonetheless suﬀered the consequences of conﬂict. In February, President Madero was overthrown by a military coup and the following months were characterized by street battles, military occupation, heightened immigration, hunger, and lawlessness. Collective forms of violence and oﬀenses against property became, it seemed, more frequent than ever. After 1917, a new regime began to reconstitute the mechanisms of political control and rebuild the economy. Political stability, achieved in the 1930s, crystallized into a single-party political system with strong popular support based on corporative organizations and remarkable accomplishments in the spheres of education and public health—at least in comparison with the rest of Latin America—but less concerned about punishment. Despite the widespread violence of the revolutionary decade and continuing population growth, the frequency of crime in Mexico City decreased after 1916, establishing a trend that would last until the 1990s. The paradox posed by decreasing crime rates and declining state interest in penitentiary repression needs to be observed as a local, multilayered historical phenomenon. Thus the present study is about class and the negotiations and resistance that characterized the relations between social groups and between citizens and the state. Throughout the early decades of the twentieth century, the better-oﬀ considered criminality to be the social issue of greatest concern. They perceived crime to be more intense and dangerous after 1900 than in any previous era in the capital’s history, and thus a challenge to their project of social order and material progress—two ideals that deﬁned a modern nation. Criminologists, the police, and the judiciary set out to identify criminals and isolate them from decent citizens. In the\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nprocess, they made suspects of those who seemed to depart from ‘‘modern’’ customs. For the majority of the city’s inhabitants, in contrast, crime was an integral part of everyday life. It disrupted the trust and hierarchies that structured interactions in neighborhoods, at home, and at work. Yet victims, their relatives, and neighbors relied on the active participation of their communities to guarantee order rather than the judicial and penal institutions designed for that purpose. They knew that transgressions had their reasons—defense of honor motivated violence, economic need prompted theft—and that the criminal justice system catered mainly to the needs and fears of the upper classes, so they had to keep a mindful eye on everyone around. Thus, the proud capital became a city of suspects, where criminality was explained as a regrettable aspect of urban growth, and the urban poor bore the weight of punishment as well as victimization. A social construct, crime is a relational category, incarnated in the suspicion of the police, judges, and the law itself toward the urban poor, and the latter’s distrust toward state ideologies and practices with respect to crime. These actors deﬁned crime in divergent ways. What authorities saw as embezzlement, for example, workers might regard as a fair retribution. Likewise, retail practices that merchants and the law deemed legitimate triggered the indignation of consumers. But if considered as merely the product of contested social interactions, ‘‘crime’’ can turn into a vague, allencompassing category. The following pages stress the singularity of each case and the precise behavior that constituted an oﬀense in the eyes of the public. The analysis will focus on the most common types of predatory offenses, that is, battery and theft. In addition, violence against women, although less frequently reported, will prove to be central to understanding the gendered workings of violence and honor in general.2 The goal is not to narrate the famous cases that captured the imagination of the press, but to reconstruct the texture of crime as experienced in everyday life by those who formed the majority of oﬀenders and victims.3 Their view of transgression and punishment was imprinted by institutions and state action, but they also resisted and negotiated crime and punishment, shaping them into a complex reality. This study places those relations against the dynamic of historical change. Growing crime rates during the Porﬁriato resulted from the coincidence of a period of intense economic and social transformation and authoritarian\n\n4\n\nCity of Suspects\n\nmethods of punishment that stressed the isolation of oﬀenders from society and the centralization of punishment. After the Revolution, the meaning of crime and the identity of criminals became less of a biological problem and more of an issue of social justice and political legitimacy. Elite ideologies and state penal strategies frame this historical perspective. The question ‘‘Who is a criminal?’’ was at the heart of positivist criminology—the dominating outlook among academics interested in crime in the late nineteenth century. Internationally renowned authors, such as the Italian criminal anthropologist Cesare Lombroso, the French environmental criminologist Gabriel Tarde, and their Mexican counterparts, believed that physiognomic, psychological, and cultural traits distinguished criminals from the rest of the population. Drawing from this scientiﬁc credo, the police and the press treated criminals as a clearly identiﬁable social group. In doing so, criminology and penology uniﬁed ‘‘crime,’’ constructing it as an urban, modern phenomenon. In the past, banditry, drunkenness, and petty urban theft had been understood and dealt with as distinct phenomena. This idea of a ‘‘criminal class’’ lumped together in one scientiﬁc net diverse transgressions and suspects. ‘‘Crime’’ became identiﬁed with urban criminality, as Mexico City seemed the breeding ground of all modern social pathologies. This suspicion justiﬁed the professionalization of the police and judiciary, and the hegemony of penitentiary regulations over other strategies to deal with transgressions. Lawlessness itself conﬁrmed the diagnosis: districts characterized by marginality, squalor, and danger grew around the city’s central spaces while the frequency of crime increased during the ﬁrst decade of the twentieth century. Such evidence suggested a weakness in modernization. The colonial regime had combined with some degree of success crime prevention strategies based on traditional communal structures with an array of institutions and codes, most of them legislated from Spain, including the Real Audiencia del Crimen, the Acordada tribunal, and the Inquisition. To this confusing legacy, parts of which remained in eﬀect after Independence, national governments added the liberal tenets of the 1812 Cádiz Constitution and several constitutions after 1824. During most of the nineteenth century, crime was tackled by multiple agents: local authorities, city councils, the army, civic militias, the Tribunal de Vagos. Although some states attempted a codiﬁcation of penal laws as early as the 1830s (in Veracruz), Mexico City remained a haphazard combination of old policing methods at the local level\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nand unpredictable national politics that were often at odds with those of the city council. The arrangement persisted thanks largely to stagnated population growth in the capital and a decaying economy nationwide.4 In the wake of the triumph against imperialists in 1867, liberals enacted a penal code for the Federal District in 1871 and began to professionalize and unify the police in the capital. The late Porﬁriato was marked by the coincidence of growing urban disorder and a federal state strong enough to invoke scientiﬁc methods in its ﬁght against crime. This coincidence is best expressed by 1890s reforms to the 1871 Code, new penitentiary legislation, and, most visibly, the 1900 inauguration of the federal penitentiary in San Lázaro. Thus started the most aggressive era of authoritarian punishment in the country’s history. During the years of the Revolution, however, judicial and penal institutions lost the respect they used to inspire. Soldiers harassed policemen, prisoners escaped jail, and judges lost their jobs, leaving behind scores of cases without adjudication. Although some revolutionary factions voiced the need to reform the penal system, continuity along the former ideological and institutional lines began to be reestablished shortly after the end of the conﬂict. In 1915, revolutionary leader Venustiano Carranza took control of city government and vigorously applied Porﬁrian methods such as collective arrests of suspects and their transportation to penal colonies. But crime did not disappear. The widespread presence of guns, the threatening multiplication of automobiles, and the appearance of organized gangs of robbers made urban criminality more complex and diﬃcult to control. In the 1920s, under presidents Alvaro Obregón and Plutarco Elías Calles, new welfare policies increasingly took the place of overt repression, while theories about ‘‘readaptation’’ began to gain acceptance over positivist strategies of isolation. In the realm of penal legislation, this translated into an uneasy encounter of positivist criminology, classical penology (represented by the 1871 Penal Code and most of the legal profession), and radical views about the causes of social ills (espoused by many among the new political elite). Such a combination was ﬁrst reﬂected by a new penal code for the Federal District decreed in 1929, opposed by many because of its doctrinaire use of positivist criminology, and then by the 1931 Penal Code, which combined old and new penal ideas with the revolutionary impulse of social reform. The new legislation marks the end of the period discussed in this book, as it coincides\n\n6\n\nCity of Suspects\n\nwith the political consolidation of the postrevolutionary regime and a new institutional framework for police and penal institutions. Within a narrow periodization deﬁned by institutional change, this book sets crime against more stable everyday practices of the urban population. Facing rapid social change, urban communities (neighborhoods, tenements, extended families) set out to consolidate the social networks of reciprocity that made possible everyday survival.5 They dealt with crime by appealing to the oﬀenders’ sense of shame and by negotiating potentially violent conﬂicts. Crime for them was more than abstract ‘‘social pathologies.’’ As a result of the uniﬁed idea of crime forged by criminologists, many men and women had been punished out of suspicion rather than actual offenses. For the victims of actual crimes and their communities, however, criminals were simply those who committed crimes—whether they were forced to do so by circumstances or because of their shamelessness. They deserved to be punished, but their singularity could not be denied. Rather than a collective threat against society, criminals were people who looked much like their victims. In order to explore these neglected perspectives, this study deals with the practices and narratives constructed around speciﬁc oﬀenses.6\n\nA N OT E O N S O U RC E S\n\nCrime is also what documents preserve. The evasive nature of the brief and tense interactions that we lump together under the word ‘‘crime’’ becomes more puzzling when stored in judicial records. As in Akira Kurosawa’s ﬁlm Rashomon, each participant has a perspective, but the truth does not belong to anyone. Mexican suspects, victims, and witnesses knew that judges were sometimes unfair, and that guilt was often determined by prejudice, rather than by the impact of testimonies. This does not render judicial accounts useless but does turn them into composite statements about individual morality, social relationships, and the meaning of crime and justice. A critical view of penal institutions and their subjects requires a suitable reading of the documents they generated. The archive of the Federal District Higher Court (Tribunal Superior de Justicia del Distrito Federal) holds court records in individual case ﬁles organized by court and the accused’s name. Along with published reports on some jury trials, these ﬁles provide information about the workings of the judicial system and register the\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nnarratives produced by victims and the accused. In selecting the ﬁles to be used in this study (209 of them, out of uncatalogued, dusty, and unmarked bundles stored in the basement of the South Penitentiary court building in San Mateo Xalpa, Distrito Federal), I tried to obtain a sample resembling the information provided by statistics on the most frequent type of crimes and their changing frequency during the period. Thus, 95 cases correspond to the years 1900–1909, 67 to 1910–1920 and 47 to 1921–1930. Of these trials, 121 dealt with battery, homicide, and other oﬀenses against persons, 24 with sexual oﬀenses, 66 with crimes against property, and 12 with oﬀenses against the state (some trials dealt with more than one oﬀense). Records began with an aﬃdavit written at the police station, in which victim and accused described the events, and sometimes included a statement by the arresting oﬃcer and additional witnesses. The oﬃcer in charge at the station then sent the case to the public prosecution (Ministerio Público), the suspects to jail, and the wounded to the Juárez Hospital. In the hours or days after the arrest, participants were questioned again by a judge, who directed the investigation thereafter, usually summoning more witnesses. Trial ﬁles also contain records of the appointments of defense lawyers and the identity and antecedents of suspects (picture, anatomical description, and list of previous entrances in jail). After all evidence was entered, the prosecution and the defense wrote their conclusions, usually brief. Finally, the judge summarized the case, listed the applicable chapters of the penal code, determined guilt or innocence and, if necessary, the length of the sentence. In serious oﬀenses, such as homicide and rape, a jury decided guilt or innocence. The records also included notices about the accused’s appeal of the arrest or sentence or their request to post bond. Judicial documents hold contentious versions of events, but they also recover voices that are usually silent in historical accounts. These two functions conﬂict at times because the narratives presented by actors had precise intentions—to which factual truth was often subordinated. Suspects sought to elude responsibility or to place the blame on someone else. Victims wanted to provide a convincing account of the events, to secure punishment for their adversaries, and to avoid becoming suspects themselves. The scholar’s reading of these statements inadvertently forces regularities and rationality onto the remnants of exceptional and chaotic moments in the lives of actors. In using them I tried to remain aware of that and to be careful in building a connection between individual cases and social prac-\n\n8\n\nCity of Suspects\n\ntices. The problems faced by anthropologists (the false certainties of objectivism and the narrative biases of informants) provide a sobering point of reference for the cultural historian who uses judicial sources.7 Yet, I must confess my overarching trust in accused and victims’ statements. They can be believed because they wanted their statements to achieve an obvious goal (punishment, freedom). Their claims to truth may be suspect even today, but they referred to socialized norms about veracity and justiﬁcations of individual behavior. They addressed, perhaps in an indirect way but with no less soundness, the paradoxes of transgression and justice.\n\nA N OT E O N H I S TO R I O G R A P H Y\n\nIn a useful reversal of common sense, the historiography that this book engages has placed punishment before crime. The social history of modern Western societies of the last decades has indeed beneﬁted from new research on the role of institutions of punishment within the process of national states adapting themselves to the demands of industrial capitalism. Punishment, these studies maintain, became central pieces in the construction of productive working classes and a more penetrating state authority.8 Historical works on crime itself add important nuances, frequently overlooked, to the model of class and social control: crime follows its own rhythms, independent of punishment and generally within a multisecular decreasing trend in the modern era.9 Studies of social control in Latin America have made valuable contributions that complement studies on punishment. Recent works on Brazil, Argentina, Peru, and Mexico stress the speciﬁc historical circumstances in which the ruling groups imported European and North American strategies of control during the late nineteenth century. The regional elite’s discourse of progress and economic expansion revolved around the racial and cultural ‘‘regeneration’’ of the population and the topdown creation of new citizens through immigration and miscegenation, and included ﬁghting backwardness and lack of discipline with hygiene, criminology, and penology. Criminality became a favorite theme of social reform because the scientiﬁc discipline built around it provided plausible explanations of popular vices, and penitentiary institutions gave authorities a suitable instrument to regenerate the people. The distinction between criminal and citizen became, according to Robert Buﬃngton, ‘‘the fundamental dichotomy within modern Mexican society.’’ 10\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nIn a parallel path, other scholars have uncovered the contested nature of power and social control and brought attention to multiple actors who challenge the foundations of class, gender, and political rule behind capitalist modernization. As a result, it is no longer possible to assume social compliance to the technologies of power—even in the most industrialized countries—and the ‘‘overcalculated’’ Foucaldian view of punishment.11 In Latin America, the historiographical emphasis on popular agency emerged as a revision of elite-centered interpretations of the region’s history. Studies of peasant resistance to capitalism, for example, have demonstrated that the traditional narratives of national history fail to account for local politics and for the eﬀorts of people and communities to survive the onslaught of conquest and colonial acculturation.12 The accent on resistance has also increased historians’ interest in groups that appeared marginal in previous accounts. Bandits, slaves, the urban plebes, and women were proved to possess historical agency and now share the place of male salaried workers and politicians in historical accounts.13 The present volume visits the common ground of these two seemingly conﬂicting research agendas. Caution is required, however, to deal with the distortions from both sides. Resistance, ﬁrst, threatens to become the central theme in the historical experience of the lower classes, and hegemony, however vaguely deﬁned, the deﬁning trait of multifaceted class and political relationships. The result, according to William Taylor, is a dichotomy in which rulers and subjects are neatly divided. Popular resistance comes to the forefront, while state actions and institutions are moved ‘‘into the background.’’ As Gilbert Joseph notes for the study of banditry, the power/ rebellion dichotomy poses the danger of neglecting popular practices that were not expressed in clear political terms.14 To put it in the terms of the present study, criminals not only resisted domination when they broke the law, they also established speciﬁc relations with state oﬃcials and their own communities. An artiﬁcial division between the study of power and that of disorder is bound to yield partial results. Studies of social control in Latin America tend to analyze strategies and discourses as part of the region’s intellectual history, thus embracing (with retrospective reservations) the narrative of order and progress developed by positivist elites and the alleged impact of state-building policies on the life of the lower classes. According to this argument, for example, everything that happened to the penal system in\n\n10\n\nCity of Suspects\n\nMexico since 1900 was an advance toward modernization and the rationalization of punishment.15 Yet, even in those countries that received massive numbers of European immigrants, results did not satisfy the expectations of social engineers. Danger in the streets and low productivity at work were common images in contemporary accounts of social change in Latin American cities at the turn of the century. Recent studies of the national and regional impact of social policies suggest instead that social engineering should be judged in the context of the negotiation between the interests of reformers and those of the ‘‘reformed’’ population—in other words, as a political process rather than pure exercise of power.16 The case of Mexico City shows the limits of a narrow focus on the institutional side of punishment and deviance. In his chapter of México, su evolución social, the great synthesis of Porﬁrian achievements published in 1900, Miguel Macedo spelled out the importance of punishment: ‘‘The punitive function of the state . . . is certainly one of the basic elements of social order.’’ 17 Following this lead, historians have construed crime control as a chapter of the successful Porﬁrian drive to attract foreign investors. The Mexico City penitentiary, therefore, expressed the entrance of modern technologies of power into Mexico.18 But crime resulted from a more complex and historically stable set of causes and conditions. Colonial domination in a multiethnic society had already established the contradictions between penal institutions and community reactions to crime. Industrialization and newly emerged class divides had deep eﬀects, beyond the reach of the institutional looking glass, on a city with an already long tradition of artisanal work, commerce, and unemployment.19 What questions are to be asked in a more comprehensive attempt? The sociology of crime, concerned with explanation and policy making, oﬀers useful reference points for a historical approach. The notion that deviance means the transgression of universal values or an imbalance of the social body is challenged by empirical research. ‘‘Criminals,’’ sociologists argue, undertake a consistent pattern of law-breaking behavior because they are immersed in a social environment that privileges and legitimizes that behavior. Ample evidence is cited to the eﬀect that people associated with criminals are more likely to break the law, and that criminals are often associated with certain cultural traits—such as tattoos, slang, and drinking. Culture, however, poses dangerous temptations. The observations cited above become less useful when reiﬁed into the rigid yet popular category of ‘‘subcul-\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nture’’—an isolated and stable set of values that ascribes deviance to an identiﬁable group.20 Explaining crime thus becomes an ethnographic exercise. As an alternative, interpretations that focus on the labeling of certain groups as criminal explain the emergence and continuity of deviant behaviors as the product of the decision by society, or rather by its ruling groups, to deﬁne petty oﬀenders as criminals and thus pressure them into repeated law breaking. The social practices that stigmatize oﬀenders have the eﬀect of breaking all other connections with the community and perpetuating deviance as a social role. The question, therefore, is no longer ‘‘Who is a criminal?’’ but ‘‘Who deﬁnes him or her?’’ 21 An exclusive stress on labeling, however, might return us to the starting point: since crime is ‘‘produced’’ by the state, all that there is left to study is the penal institutions, while actual criminal practices can be neglected as anecdotal. This book addresses these questions but weaves them in a wider historical frame. It moves beyond the history of punishment into the cultural history of a city and its inhabitants. In doing so, its ambition is to tie together historiographical strands that have studied elite social engineering and popular resistance as parallel, isolated phenomena. By looking at both crime and punishment as cultural products, this book seeks to restore the political meaning of everyday social interactions and conﬂicts with the state. The stress on the local level of justice and the individuality of victims and oﬀenders runs counter to the grand generalizations about crime and punishment, yet reveals the centrality of both aspects of Mexico City life. Crossing the revolutionary divide, the study hopes to challenge the fundamental chronological and conceptual axes (ancien regime/revolution, elite/popular) of Mexican political historiography. The result describes a city marked by suspicion: criminology and repressive state strategies created suspects out of the urban poor; these in turn resisted and negotiated their status vis-à-vis their communities and authorities, whom they also mistrusted. However tense and complex, these relations deﬁned crime in their place and time.\n\nI THE CONTEXT\n\nTurn-of-the-century Mexico City contained all the symbols of nationalism and many remarkable examples of colonial architecture. By the end of the ﬁrst century of national life, it was the locus of progress and the capital of Porﬁrio Díaz’s long-lasting regime. Railroads, tramways, paved and illuminated streets, broad avenues, parks, new residential areas, and high buildings appeared as distinctive signs of material progress. Improvements in the design and use of urban space were based on the understanding that the rich and poor were not to mingle: a rational division between the safe and beautiful areas of the modern city and the dangerous and unhealthy marginal zones. Urban design also meant social reform: the state and the wealthy classes wanted to translate the city’s physical evolution into a new culture among its inhabitants. The elites’ idea of renewal faced the challenge of a growing and untamed population. The urban lower classes, so distant from the aspirations of wealth and comfort associated with progress, used the city in their own way, defying the class-structured organization of the capital. As tensions arose around the use of the streets and other public areas, the government relied on the police and penal institutions to instill a sense of appropriate conduct in the people. Criminal behavior (whether a genuine transgression of social norms, or simply a violation of the many laws and regulations gener-\n\n14\n\nCity of Suspects\n\nated during the period) acquired a diﬀerent meaning in the context of the dispute over the use of the city. Crime, however, was not the only way in which people deﬁed the Utopia of Porﬁrian rulers. A host of practices in the streets (vending, begging, drinking, or merely walking) also subverted the ideal social map. The next pages will weave a counterpoint between the elite model of the city and its deﬁance by the urban poor. Chapters 1 and 2 will describe how the ideal city hoped and failed to impose its strict divisions of urban space, as the connection between the appropriation of urban space and the criminalization of lower-class uses remained a long-lasting feature of the capital. The projects and policies aimed at building a modern capital for the beneﬁt of a minority of its inhabitants will be contrasted with the consequences of late-nineteenth-century growth on the city’s physical infrastructure and, more importantly, on the everyday life of the lower class. After an outline of the ideal city designed by Porﬁrian rulers, chapter 1 will describe the demographic and technological changes that caused the model to fail and the city to expand at an unprecedented rate. This will be followed by a probe into everyday practices and living conditions in the marginal city—the city that grew around and across the Porﬁrian ideal city. Authorities’ attempt to reform behaviors deemed to be a threat to progress, the urban policies that sought to preserve the social geography of the city and the collective reactions to those policies will be the theme of chapter 2. Urban communities, in their various and often coterminous forms, appear in these chapters as central actors in this story of conﬂict about the rules and spaces of city life. Criminology was the new science called to account for the negative sides of modernization, but also to provide recipes to improve society. Chapter 3 will examine the scientiﬁc discourse that was inspired by and tried to tame urban growth. Mexican criminology directed the fascination of educated males toward the marginal spaces of the ideal city: peripheral neighborhoods, crowded homes, nightly disorder. Explaining crime was one way to dispel that fascination—but one with signiﬁcant implications for the design of state policies. In sum, the following section looks at the cultural articulation of demographic and spatial growth under an authoritarian regime. This description of a disputed city questions the Porﬁrians’ contention that their projects of urban renewal went unchallenged and ultimately succeeded. While the urban poor used the city in ways that contradicted those projects, elite per-\n\nThe Context\n\n15\n\nceptions of ‘‘dangerous’’ areas identiﬁed poverty with criminality. As a result, oﬃcials increasingly relied on punishment to impose their social ideas, while the urban poor identiﬁed the police and judicial system with the interests of the wealthy. Crime itself was produced at this juncture of fear and neglect.\n\n1 The Modern City Our views of Porﬁrian Mexico City are heavily inﬂuenced by the grandeur of the buildings and avenues and the elegance of colonias built during that period. It is easy to share the nostalgia for los tiempos de don Porfirio, an era when Mexican society seemed as peaceful and well organized as the walkways under the shady trees of the Paseo de la Reforma. The following pages, however, contend that such images of civilization were only the precarious result of a negotiation between the regime’s projects of urban modernization and the everyday practices of the majority of the urban population.\n\nTHE IDEAL CITY\n\nThe changes that swept early-twentieth-century Mexico City began nearly forty years earlier, during Emperor Maximilian’s attempt to turn Mexico into a modern European nation, and accelerated in the late Porﬁriato. The ideal city of the 1910 centennial celebration of independence epitomized the unifying myths of progress and nationhood. The colonial center of the city, the Zócalo or Plaza Mayor, extended its stately architecture westward along Avenida Juárez to the Alameda park and then southwest along the elegant Paseo de la Reforma to its terminus at Chapultepec Castle, the presidential residence (see ﬁg. 1). The Alameda was part of the colonial design of the city\n\n18\n\nCity of Suspects\n\n1. Mexico City: Colonias, Barrios, Police Districts. Sites Mentioned: 1. Zócalo; 2. National Palace; 3.

The Paseo de la Reforma’s wide design and execution followed the aesthetic and urbanistic ideas that had transformed Paris and other European capitals since the 1850s. This was the axis of a less visible modiﬁcation of urban territory that resulted in the displacement of indigenous communities from valuable lands. Of all the cycles of change that Mexico City had experienced after the sixteenth century, the one that peaked during the late Porﬁriato was perhaps the most disruptive because it combined population growth, land dispossession, and heightened cultural conﬂict.1 Porﬁrian urban design corresponded with a drive to reorganize society within the city. Around the Paseo de la Reforma, private companies were\n\nThe Modern City\n\n19\n\nlicensed by city authorities to develop upper- and middle-class residential areas or colonias, such as Juárez, Cuauhtémoc, Roma, and Condesa. Oﬃcials protected the development of these colonias, and often ordered the elimination of undeserving or ill-looking buildings. Designers and builders had a clear idea of the social meaning of modernization: the poor had to be displaced from the elegant quarters, while city services were to be concentrated only in the well-kept districts. This strategy meant a clear departure from the multiclass dwellings in the city center dating back to colonial times. Porﬁrian investors, often closely associated with city oﬃcials, bought and partitioned lands for the wealthiest classes in privileged areas, while reserving other zones for working-class homeowners, thus working together to preserve the spatial separation between classes. Separating customers according to their socioeconomic status would create a stronger real estate market.2 Hygiene and security, both symbolically achieved with the inauguration of great drainage works and the San Lázaro penitentiary in 1900, were requisites for the stability of the colonized city. In order to protect the integrity of new upper-class neighborhoods, municipal and health authorities planned the growth of industries and working-class neighborhoods away from upper-class suburbs. The Consejo Superior de Salubridad (Public Health Council) deﬁned in 1897 a ‘‘zone which has the goal of maintaining certain types of industries at a distance from the only avenue of the capital,’’ that is, the Paseo de la Reforma.3 The residential developments would expand from the axis Zócalo-Alameda-Reforma toward the west and southwest. The east was discarded because of its proximity to the Texcoco lake, its lower ground level, and unfavorable ecological conditions. The designers of the new penitentiary located it on the eastern San Lázaro plains, in order to send the prisoners’ ‘‘miasma’’ away from the center.4 On the margins of the central city, authorities and developers had to deal with the existence of popular residential areas: lower-class colonias and old barrios. Although barrios had always existed close to the center, their poverty had preserved what Andrés Lira calls a ‘‘social distance’’ from the modern city. For lower-class developments, urbanization did not mean access to drainage, electricity, and pavement as it did for more aﬄuent colonias and the protected environment of the central area.5 Life in the wealthiest colonias followed European bourgeois models of privacy and autonomy. City planners and developers shared the tacit prem-\n\n20\n\nCity of Suspects\n\nise that business, leisure, and work should be clearly separated, and that men and women had unmistakably diﬀerent roles in public and domestic environments. The new colonias organized the living accommodations of the upper classes in single-house lots equipped with all the amenities of modern life, including electricity, drainage, running water, and telephones. Thanks to these services, the inhabitants of the house did not have to rely on oldfashioned methods of satisfying their daily needs, such as manually bringing water to the household or dumping human waste in the street. The ideal of an autonomous residence drew well-to-do families away from downtown, which had become increasingly oriented toward commercial use. An enhanced, city-wide transportation system sought to facilitate the movement of people from the new residence areas to their workplaces.6 The separation of public and private spaces and activities was also the guiding principle for oﬃcial action regarding people’s demeanor. Private behavior in public spaces had always been a concern for authorities in Mexico City. Policía y buen gobierno deﬁned the authorities’ intervention since colonial times, encompassing not only police issues but also the upkeep of streets and the control of collective meetings. Like its counterparts in the seventeenth century and the Bourbon period, the Porﬁrian City Council ordered pulquerías (stores selling pulque, a fermented beverage made from the sap of the maguey) and cantinas to conceal customers from the eye of pedestrians, and withdrew permission from restaurants to place chairs and tables on the sidewalks. The state even regulated the clothes worn by pedestrians: Indians (deﬁned by their use of white trousers and shirts instead of dark suits) were required to wear dark trousers. Repeated publications of this prohibition, in the 1890s and then during Francisco I. Madero’s presidency, suggest the futility of the attempt and reveal municipal authorities’ belief that indigenous people were not culturally prepared to use the city.7 These attempts to divide the use of the city were far from perfect, and the reality of urban life never accommodated itself to the Porﬁrian ideal. Instead of working as autonomous, suburban households (as their architects conceived them), upper-class mansions reproduced the dynamics of the casco de hacienda, where servants and workers were an extension of the patriarchal family. Masters and domestic workers formed an intimate association that was not easily opened to public authority. Isidro Esqueda, for example, escaped a violent and, in his view, unjustiﬁed attempt at arrest by\n\nThe Modern City\n\n21\n\na drunken policeman by seeking refuge inside the home of his boss, Lic. José Raz Guzmán, who later detained the policeman himself.8 Lic. Raz Guzmán had good reasons to act: wealthy residences needed the mediation of servants and sellers to obtain access to many basic products and services. The functional divisions of urban space could not resist the erosion of everyday life precisely because the design of the upper-class, ‘‘civilized’’ city left outside, unplanned, the very factors of its survival. The elegant new colonias around the Paseo de la Reforma, as well as the older aristocratic homes downtown, needed labor and supplies, often from distant places. The Eighth District, for example, lacked a single produce market in 1904.9 Conversely, workers had to leave their homes to satisfy many needs of everyday life: to drink, eat, socialize, or simply earn a living through petty commerce in the streets. These needs and a distinctive conception of urban space impelled the urban poor to blur the artiﬁcial borders between a modern city, where public and private functions were clearly separated, and another city, where elite models of behavior seemed less important. A tension thus emerged between the hierarchical and rigid map of the capital imagined by the Porﬁrian elites and the ambiguous, often not articulated, horizontal view of those who spent most of their time on the streets. Before looking into that tension, however, we must ask what prevented Mexico City from becoming the model capital that its rulers imagined.\n\nP O P U LAT I O N , T R A N S P O RTAT I O N , A N D T H E FA I LU R E O F T H E M O D E L\n\nThe Porﬁrian regime failed to consolidate its ideal capital because the constant arrival of migrants and the development of new means of transportation, both expected to facilitate progress, instead weakened social divisions and undermined the authorities’ control over public spaces. Population growth posed an unexpected problem to planners and administrators even before it was clearly expressed by the census.10 Population counts reveal the unprecedented rate of this growth during the late Porﬁriato. Since 1895, date of the ﬁrst national census, the population of Mexico City had not only grown at a faster pace than the national total, but also faster than other cities in the country. While nineteenth-century estimates placed its population around 200,000, in 1895 Mexico City had 329,774 inhabitants, and by 1921 it had grown to 615,327 (see appendix, table 5). In-\n\n22\n\nCity of Suspects\n\nternal migration was the main cause of urban growth. In 1900, more than half of Mexico City’s inhabitants were born in other states. In 1910, more than a quarter of the total number of migrants in the entire country lived in the Federal District.11 Large numbers of migrants reached the capital and established themselves in diverse dwellings and occupations. Despite the rural origin of most migrants, Mexico City’s population was not what we can call a ‘‘traditional’’ society. Literacy ﬁgures, for example, show that the capital’s population was more educated than the national average at the end of the Porﬁriato, and continued to be so during the following decades.While in 1900 the nation’s literacy rate was 18 percent, in the Federal District it was 45 percent. In 1930 the percentages were 39 and 75, respectively.12 Although schooling was more accessible in the capital, many migrants came already educated. In 1895, the largest age group in Mexico City were those between 21 and 30 years old, accounting for 40 percent of the city’s total population. Meanwhile, the largest population group in the country as a whole comprised children aged 10 or less, representing 30 percent of the national population.13 People came to the capital searching for jobs, but they did not necessarily lack education, a degree of status, or familiarity with urban life. Migration to Mexico City also distinguished itself from that to other areas of the country in that the sex ratio favored women. In 1895, men were 50 percent of the national population, compared to 46 percent in Mexico City. The disparity grew until men represented less than 45 percent of the capital’s population in 1930.14 This contrasted with the rapidly developing northern regions of the country, where the tendency was the opposite. According to François-Xavier Guerra, the sex imbalance of certain regions during the Porﬁriato partly explains revolutionary mobilization: men outnumbered women by up to 10 percent in the mining areas of the north and in parts of the state of Morelos—both foci of the Revolution. Male predominance was a sign, in Guerra’s view, of modernization and social change, thus fueling political participation.15 This view coincides with contemporaneous revolutionary interpretations of Mexico City as a territory of conservatism, decadence, and lack of masculinity. In 1914, veteran opposition writer Heriberto Frías stated that the Porﬁrian dictatorship, sanctioned and supported by the rich, the military and the clergy, systematically tried to abolish the virility of the middle class,\n\nThe Modern City\n\n23\n\nparticularly in the Federal District, where employees and professionals formed a corrupted Court living in a state of serfdom caused by atavisms and the environment.16\n\nThis view of the capital as a ‘‘retrograde’’ and conservative city seems to be supported by the absence of a massive (and male) popular revolt. Recent scholarship, however, has argued that women’s participation in the Revolution was more important than traditionally acknowledged, and that Mexico City’s lower-class women in particular were visibly active in urban politics in 1915, when the civil war hit the capital in full force and scarcity and inﬂation triggered food riots.17 Mexico City oﬀered the conditions for women to explore work opportunities beyond their traditional gender roles. Census data for working women show a sharp contrast between national ﬁgures and those for Mexico City: while in 1900 women were only 17 percent of the national employed population, in Mexico City they were almost half. This did not mean, however, that women invaded customarily male areas of work. Certain jobs seemed to attract female labor more than others. According to the 1895 census, the trades favored by women were those of needlework (5,505 women and no men listed by the census), cigar making (1,709 women and no men), domestic work (25,129 women and 8,883 men), laundry (5,673 women and 112 men), and concierge work (1,431 women and 994 men). Taken together, these categories made up 50 percent of the employed female population.18 For many of these women, living in the capital meant not only leaving behind their hometowns but also a domestic environment. In sum, turn-of-the-century Mexico City was dominated by young newcomers, more educated than the norm and with a strong presence of women in certain areas of economic activity. By contrast with more developed metropoles, industrial jobs did not employ large numbers of people in Mexico City; only 1 percent of employed men in the city in 1895 worked in industry, while 11 percent were listed as comerciantes (employed in commerce) and 7 percent as domestic workers.19 Moving to the capital did not necessarily translate into better living conditions, although it opened the possibility of access to better-paying jobs. Along with demographic growth, modernization brought new means of transportation. It became easier for travelers to reach the capital and for its inhabitants to move within it. The development of railroads, cast in a coun-\n\n24\n\nCity of Suspects\n\ntrywide network whose lines converged in Mexico City, allowed artisans of modest income and poor migrants to make one-day trips from nearby towns. Compared to the traditional canoes and ox carts that in the 1880s still transported much of the foodstuﬀs needed in the capital, trains brought products from regions beyond the valley. Soon, railroads replaced canals and roads as the principal means of communication between the city and the surrounding towns. In response to the sudden ease of reaching the capital from the interior, crowds who did not behave or dress according to ‘‘civilized’’ foreign models poured onto the city streets. Railroad stations bustled with outsiders, particularly during national holidays or religious occasions, such as the December 12 celebration of the Virgin of Guadalupe, which brought many pilgrims of rural appearance. Regardless of origin, visitors crowded the streets, drinking and eating and creating a bonanza for merchants and a headache for the police.20 New means of transportation, particularly tramways, enhanced people’s mobility within the city. In addition to the private and rented coaches, which provided transportation for ‘‘people of medium and great wealth,’’ tranvías made commuting faster and aﬀordable, and brought the center of the city closer to the suburbs. In 1903, most tramways were pulled by mules, although there were electric units as well. By 1920, there were 345 kilometers of tramway lines with 370 passenger cars, all owned by the Compañía de Tranvías de México. Tramways were cheap enough to be used by workingclass people on a daily basis and occasionally by the poorest residents.21 They became an important element of the urban poor’s everyday life. For the characters in Angel de Campo’s novel La Rumba, the tramway was much more than the daily means of transportation. Remedios, a seamstress, commuted to work on the tramway and made it the setting for her romantic life. Horse-driven cabs continued to be a common sight at the turn of the century, as well as ox carts, mules, and hand-pulled carts. Starting in the 1910s, automobiles added to the intricacy of transportation, with greater speed and diﬀerent rules governing their movement.22 The impact of these new means of transportation on the popular perception of the capital was twofold. First, tramways, trains, and automobiles were commonly identiﬁed with the worst, more aggressive aspects of modernization. Walking in the middle of the street became a dangerous ‘‘rural’’ habit in this city. Accidents were common. Echoing public concern, the penny press called tramway drivers mataristas (from the verb matar—\n\nThe Modern City\n\n25\n\nto kill), instead of motoristas. The impunity of car and tramway drivers was a central consequence of urban progress from the point of view of lowerclass pedestrians: the street became a threatening environment, where the victims were poor and the guilty were protected by their companies and judicial corruption. Thus, drivers who ran over pedestrians were often surrounded by witnesses and spontaneously brought to the police.23 Modern transit created a world of movement that was both attractive and dangerous. Beggars wheedled in train stations, boys peddled on tramways, theft was common at both sites, and journalists even described a special kind of professional thief who targeted unaware passengers.24 Danger expressed the conﬂicts over the use of urban space. Traﬃc was one of the preferred contexts of the struggle between ‘‘traditional’’ and ‘‘modern’’ behaviors. The use of the street for fast transportation competed with its use as a place for commerce and sociability. The city council sought to teach coach drivers to keep to their right and pedestrians to move along, reminding them ‘‘that it is forbidden to stop on the street forming groups that obstruct the circulation of vehicles and animals.’’ The prohibition was, again, merely a description: vendors set up their booths in the middle of the streets, blocking traﬃc despite the inspectors’ threats; pedestrians stood in the middle of the sidewalks blocking circulation, particularly at corners and outside theaters, forming groups instead of lines.25 The second consequence of technological change was a transformed understanding of the city. Modern transportation widened the city. Tramway lines reached as far as San Angel and linked diﬀerent areas of the city with downtown destinations—the Zócalo and Avenida Plateros—but also with the gambling houses in Tacubaya and other ‘‘dangerous’’ quarters of the city. In 1882, poet Manuel Gutiérrez Nájera used the tramway as the vehicle of an imaginary exploration into passengers’ lives. He already saw a diﬀerent city than that of pre-tramway days: ‘‘The wagon takes me to unknown worlds and virgin regions. No, Mexico City does not start at the National Palace, nor does it end at Reforma Avenue. I give you my word that the city is much bigger. It is a great turtle that extends its dislocated legs toward the four cardinal points. Those legs are dirty and hairy. The City Council, with fatherly care, paints them with mud every month.’’ 26 As the city expanded, society became more complex and mobile, and the impression of an ordered, stable cosmopolitan city was broken down by the daily movement of its variegated population.\n\n26\n\nCity of Suspects\n\nThe last factor for the failure of the ideal city of the Porﬁriato was the Revolution. Beginning in 1913, the civil war took its toil on the population of the capital, not only in terms of casualties, but also through scarcity, lawlessness, and increased migration into the city. With the revolutionary armies arrived unruly characters like Manuel González, soldier of a general Gil, who was sent to the penitentiary in 1916 ‘‘for hunting doves with a bow and arrow’’ in the colonia Roma.27 No longer the picturesque innocents portrayed by nineteenth-century chroniclers, the multitude of dangerous extranjeros (foreigners) frightened neighbors of the colonia de la Bolsa and often left behind unidentiﬁed corpses.28 Threatened by the initial radicalism of revolutionary leaders, those who had beneﬁted from Porﬁrian modernization left the city and their luxurious homes for exile. After the civil war, however, the old and the new elite reconciled and continued urban development along the basic lines established during Díaz’s regime. After 1920, the capital slowly began to improve its image again. Elegant colonias near Chapultepec park, such as Polanco and Anzures, became the residence of choice for the new politicians and businessmen. Sanitation and expansion of new developments recovered their fast pace by the end of the decade based, as in prerevolutionary times, on the harmony of developers’ interests and urban policies. The area of the city tripled in ten years. Cars came to dominate traﬃc, and by 1928 animal-drawn vehicles were prohibited, as oﬃcials resumed their attack against the practices of the urban poor.29 Despite the political changes brought about by the Revolution, the majority of the urban population still distrusted authority and challenged the social divides of the city, and life in the streets continued to be a transaction between the old and the new.\n\nT H E I M PAC T O F M O D E R N I Z AT I O N O N E V E RY DAY L I F E\n\nWhat did the Porﬁrian redesign of the city mean for the urban poor? This question is at the center of any attempt to explain the relationship between modernization and crime. The urban poor lived in conditions that could not be reconciled with bourgeois models; they had to cope with overcrowding, displacement, and the authoritarian policies of the regime. They also had to meet with the disapproval of observers such as El Imparcial, which in 1902 declared that\n\nThe Modern City\n\n27\n\na sizable part of the population, precisely that which does not have the best personal hygiene, lives in the narrow rooms that the capital’s buildings oﬀer to the poorer classes. Those tenement houses . . . show the most surprising spectacle of human overcrowding one could imagine. Only medieval ‘‘Ghettos,’’ those typical neighborhoods in which the Jews were conﬁned, could resemble the narrowness, slovenliness and ﬁlth of these dwellings.30\n\nThe description implied that overcrowding and ﬁlth made necessary the lower classes’ geographical and even cultural isolation, as they challenged bourgeois notions of civility and undermined the class and gender divides intended to structure urban life. In the old barrios near the urban center and in many of the newly developed lower class colonias, people lived in vecindades—one- or two-story tenements that lacked the clear spatial autonomy of modern homes. Several families lived in single- or double-room apartments with a single door that opened into a narrow hallway. Tenants shared sanitary services and the use of the hallway for cleaning or cooking. There were no strong reasons for owners to improve these arrangements. In the colonia de la Bolsa, where most tenants could not provide a guarantor, rents were established on a short-term basis at relatively high rates. Landlords did not enter vecindades, much less maintain them, and carried out their deals with tenants on the street.31 According to Nueva Era, policemen did not dare enter either, because vecindades were not welcoming places: dogs were loose and aggressive, clothes hung in the middle of the hallway, and neighbors saw any government representative as an intruder. On the other hand vendedores ambulantes (peddlers) entered vecindades at will, contributing to frequent thefts in tenants’ apartments. The housing deﬁcit explained these problems. According to the 1902 El Imparcial report, nothing decent could be leased for less than ﬁfty pesos a month; houses renting for less than twenty pesos were ‘‘troglodyte dwellings.’’ 32 For lower-class households, vecindades were simply the only option. Public dormitories or inns, called mesones, oﬀered an alternative for individuals. They provided a roof for the night in exchange for a daily, low-cost ticket. This suited the economic conditions of those who lacked a stable income, such as ambulantes or beggars. Although ostensibly designed for travelers, mesones became the permanent address of many poor capitalinos who were ready to endure the crowding. Sleeping space on the ﬂoor\n\n28\n\nCity of Suspects\n\n(which men, women, and children shared) could become the object of bloody disputes. Felipe Toledo was arrested in 1907 because he stuck a pencil four centimeters into Amador Rodríguez’s chest. Rodríguez had stepped on Toledo while looking for an opening at a mesón in the Plaza de las Vizcaínas.33 Although required to provide showers, conditions were less than hygienic, especially as demand grew. In 1918, the Beneﬁcencia Pública dormitory received 54,750 people. On an average day in 1920, 91 men, 19 women, and 8 children used one public dormitory.34 Mesones and vecindades inspired Porﬁrian writers’ allegations of sexual promiscuity among the poor: immorality was the only possible consequence of what they saw and endured in those places.35 Such claims are diﬃcult to document, but one clear outcome of overcrowding and lack of housing was the urban poor’s need to carry out many of the activities associated with the private realm in public places. A widespread problem of popular dwellings, perhaps the main reason its occupants spent most of the day in the streets, was the absence of running water and sewers. Collective toilets in vecindades emptied into sewers or the street through open channels that ran down the middle of hallways.36 This stimulated the development of baños públicos (public baths), an important institution in the lives of the inhabitants of the city and one that further mixed intimate needs and social life. At these facilities, men and women could take a shower and do laundry for a small fee. In the 1880s, baños públicos were the largest constructions on the Paseo de la Reforma, near the Alameda. Swimming pools were also crowded on hot days, especially on Saint John the Baptist’s day. Attendance at these facilities was high: in 1914, during the month of April, 5,434 men and 5,267 women used the Baños de la Lagunilla, administered by the Beneﬁcencia Pública.37 Other, less pleasing practices prompted by the lack of hygienic facilities at lower-class dwellings further oﬀended the sensibility of upper-class observers. Urinating and defecating in the streets was a matter-of-fact practice for poor men, women, and children. This problem had concerned authorities since the Bourbon period. Although public urinals were available in several sites around the city, arrests were still common after the Revolution for ‘‘having bowel movements on the public road.’’ 38 Establishing public toilets was necessary, declared a physician in 1892, since the only available alternative were pulquerías, where ‘‘there is the custom of having barrels or buckets used to contain the urine of any individual who wants to use\n\nThe Modern City\n\n29\n\nthem.’’ 39 The problem became more evident in the recently paved streets near theaters and restaurants where, at night, people left ‘‘large pools of urine’’ and feces. The city council, however, found it diﬃcult to punish even its own employees: ‘‘What can the policemen do,’’ asked a report, ‘‘if they have to stay eight hours on their corner, or the coach drivers, who often spend the whole day in the street, or the street merchants or, in sum, anyone who walks the city and who is far from his home, when they face an urgent need [alguna necesidad]?’’ 40 For lower-class men and particularly for women, neither their dwellings nor public facilities oﬀered a ‘‘decent’’ solution to their daily bodily needs. Their only option was to ignore the dictates of urbanity, endure the shame, and risk punishment.41 Lastly, the scarcity of potable water in their homes drove people to the street in order to satiate their thirst. Men and women of all ages had to use public fountains, buy ﬂavored water (aguas frescas) at street booths, or patronize pulquerías. Many houses lacked wells or were distant from water pipes, although drinking water was less of a concern for the colonias west of the center, where springs from Chapultepec provided abundant and goodquality water. Thirst led people to the streets, where alcoholic beverages were at the center of social life. Migrants were lured by the anonymity of the city and came to enjoy the deregulated, secularized use of alcohol.42 Pulque consumption had a particularly slow rhythm, but other low-alcohol beverages like tepache (fermented pineapple juice) and infusiones (teas with alcohol) also allowed customers to spend hours in pulquerías, cantinas or cheap restaurants. Despite speciﬁc oﬃcial regulations, a profuse decoration made the stay in these establishments more comfortable. Clients spent time fraternizing, eating, or simply moving from one outlet to another, starting sometimes in the morning and continuing throughout the day. José Dolores Méndez, accused of raping María Guadalupe Rodríguez, described how he invited her to several cantinas, where they began drinking lemonade and concluded with twelve glasses of rompope (eggnog). They ended up in a hotel where, according to her accusation, he tried to force himself on her.43 Control of alcohol in public places became more diﬃcult as the number of outlets continued to grow throughout the period. Up to 1871, the sale of pulque was oﬃcially restricted to the Calle del Aguila, two blocks north of the Alameda, but by the end of the century pulquerías had surpassed any precedent in terms of quantity and extension. As the city expanded, new pulquerías emerged in the outskirts of the city, with new build-\n\n30\n\nCity of Suspects\n\nings and colorful mural paintings. According to oﬃcial records, in 1902 there were 2,423 alcohol outlets in the capital, including cantinas, pulquerías, and smaller establishments. The greatest concentration of these was in the blocks east of the Zócalo. Of a total of 924 pulquerías in the city, 170 existed inside an area around the center where they were formally prohibited.44 City authorities sought to prevent crime and disturbances associated with alcohol consumption by limiting the operating hours of cantinas and pulquerías, prohibiting gambling and music on their premises, and banning the sale of alcohol during festivities. Alcohol became the rationale for further oﬃcial control of people’s movements. Since pulque was subject to a tax when it entered the city, even pedestrians carrying as little as two liters were arrested by the police. Policemen dragged dozens of sleeping drunkards (borrachos tirados) from the streets to police stations. In most cases, they were summarily ﬁned and released the next morning.45 Finding a comprehensive solution to the problem of alcoholism proved diﬃcult, in part because of the strong economic interests connected to the pulque business in Mexico City. Growing demand and increasing state supervision led to quarrels between cantinas and pulquerías, which had to meet municipal licensing requirements, and the numerous informal outlets such as tendajones (small stores) and puestos (street booths), which sold alcohol without a license, especially at night when legal outlets were forced to close. Owners of small cantinas and pulquerías accused authorities of enforcing regulations in favor of the monopolistic Compañía Expendedora de Pulques and the proprietors of elegant outlets downtown. The Compañía, whose property included haciendas, railroads, and urban real estate, had powerful partners who were also senior public oﬃcials, such as Pablo Macedo—brother of jurist and criminologist Miguel, and highranking oﬃcial in the Díaz government and the city council. After Díaz’s demise, many of the small sellers’ grievances against the Compañía became public and the new governments were, at least rhetorically, more willing to act upon the fears of alcoholism as a social problem.46 Street commerce, another long-standing source of tension between authorities and city dwellers, reinforced the street life associated with alcohol. Since most of the city’s inhabitants spent their days and nights outside, a great variety of exchanges occurred in all areas of the city. Many enterprising citizens saw street commerce as a ready, if risky, source of income, for which it was worth confronting the authorities’ penchant for control of the\n\nThe Modern City\n\n31\n\nstreets. A multitude of services were oﬀered: scribes (escribanos, also called evangelistas), barbers, dentists, phonograph operators, and musicians exercised their trades on the sidewalks, with or without oﬃcial authorization. Women cooked and sold food (chopping beef, making tortillas, ﬁxing tacos) in the middle of narrow streets, especially around markets like La Merced.47 What these trades lacked in stability they oﬀered in ﬂexibility and freedom of movement. Small vegetable or candy vendors would acquire their daily stock at La Merced market or the embarcaderos (docks where canoes brought in produce from the countryside across Lake Texcoco), walk the streets or take a place on a sidewalk, and work until the sun set or their merchandise was gone. Forty-ﬁve-year-old María Magdalena Gutiérrez walked every day from the Jamaica market to the Fourth District to peddle vegetables. She spoke Nahuatl and some Spanish, and used to live in Lerma, state of Mexico, where she made tortillas; but, she informed a social worker in 1931, ‘‘after she saw that the selling of vegetables could be more proﬁtable, she turned to that activity and moved to the capital,’’ where she was able to earn approximately one peso per day. She would wake up very early every day, buy the ‘‘lettuce, green peas, artichokes, etc.,’’ sell them in the street, and return home by foot. She was arrested on the suspicion of being a beggar while more than two kilometers away from home.48 Peddlers like María Magdalena fought a constant battle against authorities to occupy those areas of the city where customers and money were accessible. Indian sellers coming to the capital to sell their own produce were common since colonial times. In the perception of early-twentiethcentury authorities, however, she represented a serious source of disorder, no longer a ‘‘natural’’ element of the city’s landscape but an agent of social conﬂict, struggling for space against established merchants and respectable neighbors. The 1900 census classiﬁed only 334 persons as street peddlers, but many testimonies strongly suggest much larger numbers. In 1894, merchants of the Calle del Empedradillo, near the cathedral, complained about the ‘‘plague’’ of ambulantes in that street and the reluctance of the police to take strong measures against them. As the city council conceded, municipal regulations could not be easily enforced due to the negligence of the police, who refused to take strong measures against ambulantes.49 Disputes between established merchants and ambulantes over access to customers were rife. Many sellers stationed themselves outside the markets, oﬀering the same products available inside, which they had acquired\n\n32\n\nCity of Suspects\n\nearly in the morning at lower prices. The key to success was ﬁnding the right spot. Food vendors outside La Merced market complained to the city council that if they were displaced to a diﬀerent zone with less circulation of customers—as city authorities intended—their livelihood would be destroyed.50 Police agents and inspectors made peddlers’ lives harder by demanding either the oﬃcial permit (which most of them lacked and could cost thirteen cents a day for a square meter of a downtown sidewalk) or a bribe.51 Ambulantes were particularly troublesome for the group of aﬄuent merchants and urban reformers who sought to establish control over downtown streets and turn them into a modern business district. They pressured for more stringent enforcement in the streets near the center but were less concerned about populous spots, such as the Plaza de Santo Domingo.52 After all, the Zócalo was one of the showpieces of the ideal city, while Santo Domingo, only three blocks to the north, already belonged to the margins. Other types of exchanges challenged the social divisions of urban geography. The immediate need for cash drove people downtown to pawn their possessions. The city council had to authorize pawn shops in other areas of the city in order to prevent the long lines and agglomerations formed around the Monte de Piedad building, but it did not allow private entrepreneurs to oﬀer lower rates than the Monte de Piedad.53 Theft was another reason for some people to enter the wealthy areas of the capital. Reports of pick-pockets in such places as the cathedral inﬂamed concerns about crime in general and supported the demands for harsh treatment of petty thieves. It was common practice for some thieves to enter a store, grab a piece of ﬁne silk from the counter and try to outrun clerks and policemen.54 Even though thieves were fewer than ambulantes, they also participated in the disruption of the social geography of the capital. Certainly more visible than thieves, beggars became the focus of upperclass struggles to ‘‘recover’’ public spaces. In 1897, inﬂuential hygienist Dr. Eduardo Liceaga proposed that beggars be sent to jail instead of to the overcrowded asylum. El Imparcial supported the idea, since it would prevent ‘‘those immoral scenes that contradict our culture.’’ 55 In 1916, El Universal complained that beggars were aggressive, showing ‘‘sickening sores, with reprehensible impudence’’ and threatening to infect pedestrians. Their places should not be the streets, but ‘‘the farthest corner of hospitals.’’ 56 In 1917, Julio Anaya was arrested near La Merced and sent to the penitentiary because he was begging ‘‘and to that end [according to the police] he pierced\n\nThe Modern City\n\n33\n\nthe skin of his neck with a needle.’’ 57 But it was the location of beggars rather than their begging style that dictated oﬃcial intervention. Like vendors and thieves, beggars gravitated toward the central, more crowded areas of the capital. Police inspectors reported to the city council in 1895 that beggars came from surrounding neighborhoods or villages, particularly during religious celebrations. Their presence was rare in suburban districts, like the Seventh and Eighth.58 In 1930, El Universal published a map of the zone of ‘‘greatest concentration of beggars.’’ The area stretched from Las Cruces to Guerrero Streets, and from Arcos de Belem Avenue to República de Panamá Street. This overlapped with the central downtown streets, the cosmopolitan zone around the Alameda and Zócalo.59 Peddling, stealing, begging, and drinking were certainly not the only reasons for the urban poor to appropriate the spaces of the wealthy city, but they were the most visible. Laboring at workshops, upper-class houses, government oﬃces, or stores, inhabitants of the marginal city moved daily into the central city, ﬁlling the streets with their presence. The city could not work without this movement across social boundaries. Yet, city authorities sought to control and channel the dynamics of urban life. They tried to teach the urban lower classes how to use their own city. This dominating pretense, rather than material improvements, characterized the Porﬁrian version of the modern capital.\n\n2 The Policed City As early twentieth-century urban authorities, merchants, and developers tried to organize the city according to their interests, they turned to the police to punish the public behaviors that did not conform to those goals. The urban poor, on the other hand, developed a skeptical view of order. They used the city in diﬀerent ways, walking across the social boundaries, challenging the authority of the police, and even subverting the oﬃcial dictates about street nomenclature. Conﬂict was the distinctive feature of the late Porﬁrian city. Thieves, drunkards, and beggars became the target of several oﬃcial campaigns to ‘‘clean up’’ the city. Perhaps the harshest campaigns took place in 1908–10 under Porﬁrio Díaz’s iron hand, and subsequently in 1917–19 when Venustiano Carranza sought to consolidate revolutionary legitimacy using ancien régime methods.1 These policies were the most aggressive example of oﬃcial attitudes toward the urban lower classes. They emerged in the context of the dispute between diﬀerent notions about the use and structure of the city. But it was not a one-sided ﬁght: city inhabitants challenged authorities’ skewed distribution of resources, which favored upper-class colonias and the center over the rest of the city. Issues of health, policing, and street nomenclature reveal contesting perceptions of urban space and illus-\n\nThe Policed City\n\n35\n\ntrate how the unintended consequences of modernization subverted the Porﬁrian model of a cosmopolitan capital.\n\nB O U N DA R I E S\n\nThe internal and external boundaries of Mexico City became particularly unstable during the Porﬁriato. Since the early colonial period, ethnic stratiﬁcation had deﬁned an area of Spanish population around the political and religious center of the Plaza Mayor. The traza or outline of the central city displaced the indigenous inhabitants of Tlatelolco and Tenochtitlan to the edges of the lake that surrounded the city. According to Andrés Lira, from those early moments on, the areas of Spanish and indigenous occupancy moved and overlapped constantly. The tension these movements imposed on the ‘‘social distance’’ reached its peak in the second half of the nineteenth century.2 Areas of lower-class housing, characterized by overcrowded tenements near the downtown and squatters’ shacks in the outskirts of the city, surrounded the center in a crescent moon whose curve embraced the Zócalo and Alameda, closer east of the National Palace and farther away at its extremes. The moon’s farthest points were the colonia Guerrero in the northwest and the Belem jail in the southwest. Its territory included the colonias Morelos and la Bolsa, located north and northeast of the old barrio Tepito, and the colonia Obrera. The barrios of older, lower-class housing near the center presented obvious problems. Many of them had been established in pre-Hispanic times, some still preserving indigenous habits and language, but others were the result of the recent increases in population density. According to El Imparcial, real estate speculation, the centralization of services and commerce, and the price of tramway fares forced ‘‘our poor classes to cram like canned sardines into the small rooms available.’’ 3 Many run-down vecindades, pulquerías, and dangerous streets were located just behind the National Palace. American visitor Eaton Smith noted that, as a consequence, the Zócalo ‘‘is rather the lounging-place for the lower classes, as the Alameda is for the upper.’’ 4 After the Revolution, lower-class neighborhoods close to downtown remained a world of poverty and disease. In the early 1920s, sanitary authorities considered the area north of the Plaza de la Constitución as an\n\n36\n\nCity of Suspects\n\n‘‘endemic’’ zone of typhus, whose inhabitants had to be ‘‘desinsectizados’’ to prevent new outbreaks of the disease.5 The contrast was also stark in the poorer suburbs, where traditional rural ways coexisted with the newest aspects of modernization. In the Seventh and Eighth districts, unkempt open spaces prompted the city council to order the fencing of empty lots near ‘‘inhabited zones.’’ 6 Still open to the surrounding countryside, these areas showed the unﬁnished transition to urban life. Dogs, horses, donkeys, pigs, cattle, and chicken were everywhere and created sanitation problems: in December 1900, the bodies of seven hundred animals were picked up and incinerated.7 In Mixcoac, south of Chapultepec, well-to-do neighbors complained about a forty-three-room tenement house and the corresponding animals, which they considered a focus of disease and crime and an insult to nearby residences. To the east, farther away from the ideal city, Smith explored barrios San Lázaro, Santa Anita, La Soledad, and La Palma, a ‘‘rather slummy part of the town,’’ in the southeastern limit of the Second District. Situated next to Lake Texcoco, the area suﬀered the worst eﬀects of dusty winds and ﬂooding.8 The external limits of the capital lost their ordering function during the Porﬁriato, as the capital expanded its area almost ﬁvefold and railroads reached the heart of the capital.9 Several gates ( garitas) had been placed at the outskirts of the city to control the traﬃc of merchandise brought in by carts. By the turn of the twentieth century, however, the gates were rapidly becoming obsolete: oﬃcials still collected fees on pulque and other products but their ﬁscal importance had been reduced by increasing railroad traﬃc, and they no longer marked the city’s outer limits. City authorities during the Porﬁriato could not monitor the inﬂux of travelers entering through the garitas or checking into mesones, as had been the practice since the colonial period.10 The Revolution exhibited the loss of control over the external boundaries of the city. Zapatista insurgents from Morelos acquired weapons, money, and information in the capital, and carried them through the southern hills of the valley with relative ease, although on a small scale. The entrance of Zapata’s army in November 1914 was the symbolic culmination of this silent invasion.11 In the 1880s, the separation between recently arrived ‘‘outsiders’’ ( fuereños) and city dwellers seemed clear to everyone because both groups had distinctive clothes and manners. As the city grew and trains brought anonymous multitudes, fuereños became harder to discern.12 For many\n\nThe Policed City\n\n37\n\n2. Panoramic view of barrio Tepito and its church, ca. 1930.

The crescent moon, therefore, posed a threat to the security of the modern city. Certain barrios and lower-class colonias were identiﬁed by gente decente as places of criminality and vice. To the north in the Third District, barrio Tepito and colonia de la Bolsa, known for their role in the traﬃc of stolen goods, were also territories of crime (see ﬁg. 2.). An El Imparcial reporter depicted colonia de la Bolsa as ‘‘the cradle of crime.’’ He described his excursion to the colonia as though it were a journey into the unknown: ‘‘As an explorer seeking the source of rivers by sailing against the stream, I followed the complex network of small streets that are the bridges sending evil from la Bolsa to invade the city.’’ Once there ‘‘a crowd of horrible and strange ﬁgures . . . emerged before my terriﬁed eyes, beholding that dark world where people seem to come from generations of criminals.’’ 13 The barrio of Tepito was also feared as a thieves’ lair. Eaton Smith was told that the ‘‘Thieves Market’’ was the place where stolen merchandise could be sold three months after the theft, without fear of prosecution. The visitor\n\n38\n\nCity of Suspects\n\nthought this an exaggeration, ‘‘at least nowadays under the strong hand of Díaz.’’ 14 To the southeast and south of the center, mainly within the Second and Fourth Districts, La Merced market and Cuauhtemotzín Street (an area of prostitution) were seen as foci of danger. An 1895 guide for visitors, suggestively entitled México y sus alrededores. Guía para los viajeros escrita por un Mexicano. Cuidado con los rateros [Mexico and its Surroundings: A Guide for Travelers written by a Mexican: Beware of the Thieves], warned that La Merced is ‘‘famous because of the quantity of thieves who are there.’’ 15 Around Belem Jail, in the Sixth District, a motley world of prisoners’ relatives, witnesses and victims attending court, policemen, jury trial audiences, vendors, and scribes reminded observers of the large population involved in the business of crime and punishment. Alcohol consumption deﬁned these areas. In a survey ordered by the city council in 1902, the Second District had the greatest number of alcohol outlets (534 of a total of 2,423 in the whole city). Together with the First District and the Third District, they encompassed more than half of the pulquerías (484 of a total of 924) in all eight districts.16 A closer look at information in the judicial database about criminals’ addresses and the locations of crimes seems to reinforce this perception. The data, based on a sample and not normalized to population ﬁgures, show certain areas as having a greater frequency of crimes: colonias Doctores, Guerrero, and Morelos and the barrios east of the Zócalo make up 60 percent of the cases in the database. The addresses of suspects suggestively correspond to the bad image of certain colonias: 99 suspects of the 248 for whom information is available lived in San Lázaro, Merced, Esperanza, Tepito, and, again, Doctores and Morelos. The image proves less convincing when population data (available for police districts but not colonias) is used to normalize crime data. Rates per 100,000 inhabitants from judicial sources, presented in the form of indices in table 6 in the appendix, are not conclusive about the endemic character of crime in certain areas. Only the Fourth District had a consistently higher index of committals and suspects’ addresses than did the city as a whole— but only in the rates based on a direct compilation from judicial and administrative sources, in the second, third, and fourth columns. Few suspects lived in the Eighth District, containing the elegant Condesa and Roma colonias, although arrests were more common there—suggesting greater police concern about security in those areas. The feared Second and Third Dis-\n\nThe Policed City\n\n39\n\ntricts, however, are not clearly prominent except in the rates obtained from the 1917–18 campaign against rateros. The results from this campaign, discussed in chapter 7, present an image more like the perceptions described in the previous paragraphs: more of the suspected rateros lived in the Second, Third, and Fourth Districts, while the Seventh and Eighth Districts had low indices. This, I argue, was the product of police notions about the proﬁle of criminals rather than the committal of speciﬁc crimes. The lack of police in these poor areas furthered the elite sense of ‘‘dangerous’’ territories within the city. Despite the even distribution of crime relative to population throughout the city, authorities’ deployment of urban services, including policing, favored the more aﬄuent neighborhoods. These administrative decisions provoked reactions from the inhabitants of lower-class neighborhoods and often grew into political disputes over the uses of the urban space and the right to security. The city council was in charge of making urban expansion oﬃcial. It had to ‘‘receive’’ a colonia before granting it the beneﬁts of infrastructure. The city council approved the transfer of property in Colonias Roma, Condesa, Juárez, San Rafael, Santa María, and Guerrero, in lands that had formerly belonged to haciendas, and ensured that their developers provided all the services oﬀered to proprietors. Other areas seemed to be ignored. In 1903, for example, neighbors of colonia de la Bolsa asked for pavement and street lighting, but the city council denied their request on the grounds that the partitioning (or fraccionamiento) of the lands had not been oﬃcially approved. After a political struggle with the governor of the Federal District, the city council ﬁnally accepted the neighbors’ petition, although pavement was to take time, and security remained a problem. The inhabitants of colonia Obrera were involved in a similar dispute.17 Business needs weighed heavily on these decisions because the city council was usually elected from a group of inﬂuential citizens who had economic interests at stake. The results were pragmatic policies that concentrated limited resources on the embellishment of the modern city, rather than on the expansion of all services.18 Street cleaning and hygiene were targeted only insofar as visible results could be achieved without great expense—particularly in downtown and upper-class areas ‘‘frequented by foreigners.’’ Cleanliness, in this perspective, meant prohibiting paintings on the façades of buildings ‘‘that obviously defy good taste and are painted against the rules of art’’—a clear reference to pulquerías’ tradition of covering their\n\n40\n\nCity of Suspects\n\nexteriors with colorful murals. The police were in charge of enforcing the ﬁnes established for noncompliance.19 Social conﬂict over the uses and hierarchies of urban space also developed with regard to public health. In 1901, the Public Health Council indicated that a typhus epidemic had originated in the lower-class suburbs. According to the council, these zones could not be sanitized unless enough police were available to compel their inhabitants to clean up garbage and feces. Resources, concluded the council, were insuﬃcient to attend to both the city’s suburbs and center.20 In the same year, neighbors of the First and Second Districts challenged the council to do something about the ﬁlthy Plazuela of Mixcalco: With all respect, we the subscribers inform you that we are suﬀering typhus, pneumonia, and many other diseases whose exact name we do not know because we are ignorant of the science of medicine . . . because of the harmful hygiene produced by the public dumpsite that is the plaza known as Mixcalco, located in front of our homes; we are invaded by a serious catastrophe of illnesses that are killing us with the electric violence of lightning.21\n\nAlthough the subscribers were asking for street cleaning, the city government saw the problem as one of morals. Authorities focused their reform attempts on changing the habits of the lower classes—a cheaper strategy than sanitation. Doctors denounced and prohibited practices such as spitting that they considered unhealthy and that were associated with pulque consumption and blamed for the spread of tuberculosis. The disease was responsible for the death of 2,013 people in 1901. Inhabitants of tenement houses were advised to defecate in ‘‘portable buckets,’’ which would be provided and collected every night by authorities. However, in 1907 the service was still not reliable in areas such as Tacubaya. The lack of piped drainage, running water, and garbage collection had caused typhus among the approximately one hundred inhabitants of a tenement house in the Second District, but several visits by inspectors between 1902 and 1906 only served to document worsening conditions.Vecindades, however, could not be closed outright, nor remodeled with public money, and landlords were rarely mentioned as responsible for these situations. The dissipation, untidiness, and alcoholism of the Mexican urban poor were easier to blame.22\n\nThe Policed City\n\n41\n\nT H E P O L I C E A S A N I N S T RU M E N T OF SOCIAL REFORM\n\nIt is in the context of this fragmented urban space, made both of disdain and discord, that the Mexico City police need to be comprehended. Policemen were often caught in the contradiction of serving a project of modernization and responding to the demands of the urban population from which they came. For the governor and the city council, the police were the best weapon of social reform. From their perspective, penal sanctions and police pressure were the means to instill good behavior in the inhabitants of the city. A handwritten note, casually attached to papers concerning traﬃc regulations discussed at the city council in 1904, portrays this faith in the beneﬁcial eﬀects of policing. The author of the note, probably a council member, divided pedestrians between ‘‘cultivated persons’’ and ‘‘idem illiterate.’’ The ﬁrst group was to be taught about traﬃc rules through newspaper advertisements and signs; the second, by ‘‘insistent warnings, reprimands, constant admonishment by the police and penal sanction.’’ 23 Rather than a plan, this was a factual statement whose ramiﬁcations were indicated by La Voz de México: ‘‘the police are strongly hated among the lower classes.’’ 24 The police department had been reorganized in 1879 in order to professionalize the service and centralize control of agents. The police force that preceded the 1879 Gendarmería Municipal was based on the participation of the neighbors of the thirty-two cuarteles menores in which the city was divided. Inspectors and assistants were also residents; they walked around their neighborhood and helped in crime prevention while performing other duties, such as collecting taxes and ﬁghting ﬁres—corresponding with the comprehensive notion of policía y buen gobierno and the structure of colonial alcaldes de barrio, both inherited from colonial times.25 The Porﬁrian reorganization, building on some of the reforms established by liberal governments and by the French intervention and Second Empire (1861–67), divided the city into eight demarcaciones or police districts and established a structure in which the inspector general of the police responded to the governor of the Federal District, himself appointed by the president of the Republic. The police force was to be composed of full-time members, clearly distinguished from the civilian population by their uniforms and account-\n\n42\n\nCity of Suspects\n\nable to their superiors rather than to their neighbors—whose relations with the force were to be kept within strict limits. The police, authorities hoped, were to become an instrument of the state, rather than an extension of barrio life. The apparent rationality of the model and the large percentage of the city’s budget devoted to policing contributed to an image of order and increasing safety during the Porﬁrian period.26 As experienced in everyday life, however, the institution of policing did not radiate order and civility. The comisarías (police stations), since their establishment in the 1879 reform, were crowded, disorganized, unhealthy, and often dangerous.27 Although the reforms mandated that each comisaría was to be staﬀed by a doctor and an intern and that gendarmes were instructed to take anyone wounded in the streets to the comisaría for emergency care, medical service at stations was so deﬁcient that people avoided the police if they were in need of medical care.28 Some victims and suspects were sent to public hospitals, further confusing emergency care and judicial functions. Emeterio Ortiz, suspected of battery, was transported to the White Cross hospital, where ‘‘someone told him that he could leave and come back tomorrow for treatment.’’ 29 Emeterio was lucky, as he was declared fugitive but only suﬀered eight days of jail after he was reapprehended. Others, such as Jesús Torres, did not fare so well. Torres would spend a year, against his will, at the Juárez Hospital—more time than his attacker had been in prison.30 But the clearest conﬂict between modernization and everyday policing centered on the role of the police agent within urban communities. Gendarmes (as policemen were called since the reforms) were the most visible representatives of authority in city life. The force numbered around 3,000 men by the end of the Porﬁriato. Their presence was obvious day and night at intersections, where their lanterns, placed on the corners, formed a long string of lights and marked the areas under vigilance. The breadth of policemen’s duties suggests that they were expected indeed to be the keystone of order. Unlike their predecessors, gendarmes had to be literate and respond to a vertical structure of command. They saw that pulquerías closed on time and that neighbors cleaned their streets. They were also in charge of keeping private practices out of public spaces: among their duties was to prevent people from washing ‘‘clothes, dishes, buckets and other things at pipes and ditches, streets and public fountains,’’ and to make sure that artisans did not perform their trade on the streets.31 The police also had to arrest couples\n\nThe Policed City\n\n43\n\n‘‘having intercourse on the streets’’ and sleeping drunkards. These ‘‘civilizing’’ duties and the protection of the propertied were the priority in the use of police manpower. The greatest number of gendarmes was concentrated in the wealthy areas downtown, while barrios and colonias of the periphery were lightly staﬀed, if at all.32 Gendarmes’ working conditions impeded these goals. Complete professionalization was still a distant goal by the end of the Porﬁriato, as salaries were low and turnover rates high. Gendarmes themselves were subject to exacting disciplinary practices. Fines to maintain punctuality were often deducted from wages; a security deposit had to be paid for the gun and uniform; money was extorted by high-ranking oﬃcers. Yet, further attempts to improve discipline only prompted insubordination. In 1904, a leaﬂet incited gendarmes to call a strike in response to superiors’ abuses. Their most common reaction, however, was desertion. Gendarmes moved in and out of the institution with ease, guided by the job market rather than any sense of professionalism. When providing their personal information in aﬃdavits, they usually gave a trade other than ‘‘gendarme’’ or ‘‘employee.’’ Some tersely stated that their occupation was ‘‘merchant currently gendarme.’’ 33 Police duty was not a source of pride. Policemen often lacked the training and demea"
