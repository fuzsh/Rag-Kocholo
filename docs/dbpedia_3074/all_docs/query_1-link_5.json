Properly keeping pace with the industry's own expansion, the new volume presents many important new features. An enlarged televi- sion section points up the growing inter-rela- tion of motion pictures and video. Of special interest, too, is the equipment section, fully revised and its service aspect emphasized. And back once more, after exhaustive research, is the full list of U. S. theaters, with special list- ings of drive-in and Negro theaters comple- menting. The industry's position overseas is author- itatively presented, and in this connection, there is acknowledgment due to Nathan D. Golden of the U. S. Department of Commerce for special assistance. To STAFF MEMBERS and to all other contribu- tors a sincere Thank You for a job well done.

Film relations between the United States and Great Britain instead of improving during 1948 deteriorated further, and at the year end industry realists saw little hope for a change for the better in early 1949. In March, Eric A. Johnston, MPAA-MPEA president, and James A. Mulvey, representing the SIMPP, reached an agreement in London with Harold Wilson, president of the Board of Trade, ending the confiscatory 75% ad valorem tax and providing for the resumption of American film shipments. The agreement's highlights: Provision for remittances by U. S. companies of $17,000,000 annually plus the equivalent of the earnings of British films in the U. S. for a two-year period, together with joint control of the spending of blocked American money in Empire lands. Effective date for the duty's end was May 3. Then, on June 9, J. Arthur Rank called for the adoption of a 50% quota for British exhibitors, and announced he would play 60% to 65% British films on his Odeon and Gaumont British circuits. In late June, Parliament finalized a high 45% quota. The American counter to this deadly thrust came in late August. Johnston, having been armed with broad powers by the MPAA member companies, flew to London and there disclosed that the dualling of American with British pictures on U.K. screens would be banned after Oct. 1 except in the instance of Universal, whose commitments to Rank were recognized, and of United Artists which left action up to its individual producers. Several of the latter elected to steer their own course. Despite the fact that several thou- sand British theaters were unable to fulfill their quota obligations and the serious economic impact on independent British exhibition, the British Government clung tenaciously to its policy. From sources close to Rank came indirect over- tures for a rapprochment late in the year, with the price of peace now more than ever before seemingly a sizeable slice of American playing time for British pic- tures. The American view: Dim. Meanwhile, it was announced by Johnston that at long last the Joint Industry Advisory Council (of six) would be convened in New York in December. Later came a deferment to March 23-25. In mid- December, the Board of Trade confirmed to The Film Daily that Wilson would visit the U. S. in January for high echelon trade talks, would meet with Johnston, others. Then on Dec. 21, the BOT announced the Wilson mission was off, thai it was unlikely he would be visiting the U. S. at some future date. II 5 U. S. VS PARAMOUNT, ET AT. New and most important chapters in the lengthy legal serial, the so-called New York equity suit, were written in 1948, but not finis. In February, the Government's No. 1 industry anti-trust action was before the U. S. Supreme Court on appeal by both D of J and the defendants. On May 3 came the high court's decision. The court upheld the bulk of the trade practices section of the decree issued 17 months earlier by the statutory court in New York, but ruled that the question of monopoly had not been fully studied and thus reopened the divestiture issue. Followed months of out-of-court jockeying, with the Government in October submitting its proposed order to the trial court. It asked: A divorcement plan in a year, the \"Big Five\" to dispose at 47 GARY COOPER 48 once of interests in about 1,000 theaters; full divorcement in five years, restrictions on cross licensing. Reports of conset decrees moves echoed, re-echoed. As October faded, the Government announced tentative approval of an RKO consent decree proposal calling for theater divorcement and establishment of separate theater and production-distribution companies, with Hughes bound to drop either one in a year's time. Other provisions: New RKO circuit to comprise 109 houses, with additions permitted if competition not throttled; production-distribution company not barred from cross-licensing. On Nov.9, the statutory trial court, to which Judge Alfred C. Coxe had been named to succeed Judge John Bright, deceased, gave its blessing to the consent decree as trial phase of the equity suit resumed. A hint of the shape of things to come came from Senior Judge Augustus N. Hand: \"Partial divorcement.\" After three days, the trial was adjourned, resuming on Dec. 20 for two days when adjournment was taken to March 30. But before adjournment, both sides had completed presentation of testimony and complete settlement of the complicated joint theater ownership issue had been reached. On March 30, the court will hear oral arguments following sub- mission of briefs and proposed findings by the defendants by Jan. 31, with the Government responding by March 1. Expected in January is the plan by the defendants, possibly excluding Columbia, for an industry arbitration system. Only the future can tell whether, with the Government doggedly pressing for total divorcement and divestiture, further consent decrees will take shape before March 30; they are, however, not ruled out. Sidelight: On Dec. 28, the House Small Business Committee released its report on monopoly of industry in which attention was given to films, with Chairman Walter Ploeser asserting that divorce- ment appeared the only effective remedy to ills in the motion picture field. Ill 5 GOVERNMENT VS INDUSTRY. At the same time that it ruled in the so-called New York equity suit, the U. S. Supreme Court handed down pregnant decisions in two other an ti- trust actions— Griffith and Schine— regarded as com- plementing the litigation launched against the majors. Both were victories for the Government. In the Griffith case, the majors' victory in the trial court was upset, and a new trial directed. As it opened on November's last day, the Govern- ment demanded the breaking up of the Griffith circuit. On Dec. 12, the trial was recessed until Jan. 24. In the Schine suit, the high court held the Sherman act had been violated, returned the case to the trial court in Buffalo with instructions to find a more adequate divestiture decree. The case was still in the trial court at the year end. A reminder that the Government exercises \"policing\" powers in anti-trust matters after decrees are entered came in October when the Crescent Amusement Co. of Nashville, Tenn., was granted court permission to construct six new theaters. Crescent was the third independent circuit made a court target by the Government when it launched its all-out anti-monopoly drive. In late November, Federal Judge William Mathes in Los Angeles approved a consent decree which eliminated Eastman Kodak as an anti-trust defendant; Technicolor continued a defendant in the action. Still on the docket at the year's end was the Government's anti-trust action against Scophony, despite talk of settlement via consent decree. IV 5 TRADE LITIGATION. Outstanding among new trade litigation instituted in 1948 was the anti-trust action filed in Detroit on Aug. 24 by the SIMPP against two Detroit theater circuits; trebled damages sought: $8,750,000. Outstanding among decisions handed down during the year in actions brought in the trade by the trade were those in two suits involving ASCAP. On July 20, in New York. Federal Judge Vincent Leibell found for the exhibitor plaintiffs in the so-called ITOA action, granting injunctive relief against the system of licensing: in late 49 November, the Circuit Court of Appeals granted the Society a stay pending appeal. Doomed by the Leibell decision was the new rate schedule announced in February by the Society. On Sept. 12, in Minneapolis, Federal Judge Gunnar H. Nordbye ruled for the exhibitor defendants in infringement suits brought by ASCAP member companies. Early in 1948, the Circuit Court of Appeals in Phila- delphia upheld the $375,000 verdict in the first William Goldman anti-trust suit against the majors in behalf of his Erlanger Theater, Philadelphia. At the same time on May 6 that the U. S. Supreme Court ruled on appeals in the New York equity suit and the Griffith and Schine cases, it handed down an important de- cision in the same Goldman suit. The Circuit Court of Appeals had rejected the defendants' petition for a bill of review, and the high court held with the circuit court. In early November, Federal District Court, Philadelphia, turned down Goldman's plea for divorcement in a cross-licensing ban. Special interest attached to the anti-trust action for $300,000,000 damages filed in New York in late November by Keller-Dorian Colorfilm Corp. against Eastman Kodak and Technicolor because of its resemblance as regards allegations to the Government's earlier Eastman-Technicolor anti-trust suit. In the wake of the Supreme Court's November, 1947, decision in the celebrated Jackson Park (Chicago) anti-trust action— a victory for the theater— came sundry moves during the year, including contempt proceedings. Legal action of a different nature was filed by Paramount against the Brandt theater interests, $563,365 being sought for alleged fraud damages; the suit, charged Harrv Brandt, was aimed at his ruin. In Dallas, Federal Judge William H. Atwell dismissed a $1,200,000 anti-trust action brought by B. R. McLendon against the majors, Interstate, Robb & Rowley. In Buffalo, a Federal Court jury returned a no cause verdict in the $3,000,000 anti-trust suit of the Rivoli Operating Co., against the majors. In June, the U. S. Supreme Court refused to review in the Tivoli Amusement Co. anti-trust case originating in Dallas. In late June, a jury returned a verdict for the majors in the Fifth & Walnut Corp. $2,100,000 anti-trust suit originating in Louisville. In early July, the U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals sustained the AAA's validity, confirming the dismissal of the St. Louis Amusement Co. anti-trust action. Later in July, the Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia reversed the trial court's decision in the Penn Theater (Ambridge, Pa.1) anti-trust suit and ordered the lower court to return a verdict in the plaintiff's favor and set damages. Federal Judge Samuel Kaufman dismissed the SWG anti-trust suit against the MPAA and member companies. New anti-trust actions against film distributors and competing exhibitor interests were filed bv theater operators in Chicago. Baltimore, Cape Girardeau, Mo., Houston, Louisville. Hammond, Ind.: Alma, Ga.: Indianapolis; Greenville, Miss.; Mt. Vernon. O.: Temple, Tex.; Cadiz. O.; New Canaan, Conn.; Savannah, Ga.; Athol. Mass.; Palmer. Mass.; Brandon, Vt.; Salt Lake City; New York; Galesburg, 111.; St. Louis; Lexington, Kv.: Los Angeles; Mesa, Ariz.; New Britain, Conn.; Bridgeport, Conn.; Charlotte, N. C: Syracuse; Grand Rapids; Pittsburgh. Tn Buffalo, a Federal trial jury returned a $38,500 verdict against Paramount, RKO and Warners in the Bordonaro Bros.. Inc. (of Olean) anti-trust suit. In Buffalo, too, Dipson Theaters of Batavia asked an increase to $5,125,000 in damages sought in its suit filed against the majors and the Shea interests. In New York Citv, Cinema Circuit asked $1,200,000 balm in its suit against Century Circuit, Rugoff & Becker and RKO. Especially newsworthy because of the competitive bidding issue raised was the suit of H. B. Meisel Theaters, Inc., of Charlotte, N. C, against the majors, H. F. Kincey, Charlotte Amusement Co. and Strand Amusement Co. The largest sum demanded in exhibitor anti-trust actions during 1948 was $6,000,000, sought by five Salt Lake City exhibitors from Paramount, Warners, 20th-Fox, Columbia, Universal and Leonard H. Goldenson, Paramount theater vice-president. Damages in the aggregate sought were in excess of $25,000,000. 51 V 5 INTERNATIONAL. While important overseas developments during 1948 were numerous indeed, the successful negotiation of a new French film agreement, replacing the expired pact embodied in the Byrnes-Blum accord, unquestionably takes precedence. Principal provisions: Permission for annual withdrawal of $3,635,000 in film earnings for a four-year period dating from July 1; permission for the import of 121 American features annually, with 110 allocated to MPAA member companies, leaving 11 for U. S. independents. On the MPEA distribution front, the year's outstanding achievement was super-salesman Eric A. Johnston's personally negotiated agreements providing for the release of MPEA product in Soviet Russia, Jugoslavia and Czechoslovakia. In August, the MPEA voted to continue Netherland operations. Republic joined the export association, becom- ing its 10th member company. Frederick W. Du Vail succeeded George Borthwick as MPEA treasurer. Other 1948 international developments of special import: American films re-entered Norway, Sweden and Denmark under one-ye"
