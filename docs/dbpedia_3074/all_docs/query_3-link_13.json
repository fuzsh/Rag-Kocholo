        "text": "By Movieguide® Contributor\n\nThe Bible says in 1 Peter 5:10, “And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will himself restore you and make you strong, firm and steadfast.” This encouraging word from the Lord teaches that while believers may face suffering, God is there to restore our faith when we feel weak. This curated list of films features characters who overcome trials with hope and trust in Christ. For those who may be facing a difficult time, take heart knowing that He gives us strength to win the battle."
