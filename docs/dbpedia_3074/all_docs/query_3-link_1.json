        "text": "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God is a brilliant modern western. Many twists and turns coats its narrative to produce a film that is both fun to watch but also engages its viewers. It invites the viewer into its world of cruelty, murder, and broken promises to show the banality of humanity, but it also offers glimpses of humanity at its best. Given a horrible situation, we can survive, and those of us, if we choose to, can rise above the petty conflicts and live a life of peace. Sam Jacobson in his first turn as a feature director delights the viewer with a visual celebration of the western genre. Many shots in the film are inspired, subtly telegraphing where the story is going, while also holding its cards close to its chest. The editing is masterfully done. The story is genius, is as to be expected of a writer of this caliber. The casts, as a whole, is wonderful. Each one fills their character with carefully crafted emotional energy that charges the already brilliant script with an energy that is very difficult to describe. Is it absolutely perfect? No, some dialogue scenes do need to be trimmed down, especially near the beginning, but that's the only major flaw I could see. The film is a beautiful example of what happens when people of passion unite to create something beyond belief. It is a testament to the idea that you don't need millions of dollars to create a connection to an audience. All you need is passion, all you need is drive, all you need is dedication, all you need is a belief that what you are making will be brilliant, will be beautiful, and will be impactful to the people that see it. This film's cast and crew have that passion, and are destined to achieve great things. A brilliant piece of filmmaking that is sorely needed in the time of overblown production and lazy story telling. It reminds us what films used to be, and what they still can be. Brilliant explorations into the human condition. In one word, the film is simply: brilliant."
