Jonathan Edwards' sermon, which serves as the focal point of the essay, is rich in historical and theological significance. The difficulty arises from the need to delve deep into the text, understanding the intricate language and interpreting the underlying messages. Edwards employs vivid imagery and impassioned rhetoric, making it essential for the writer to analyze and articulate these elements effectively. To construct a compelling essay, one must not only grasp the religious context but also explore the cultural and societal aspects that influenced Edwards' sermon. This requires extensive research to provide a comprehensive understanding of the time period and the mindset of both the preacher and his audience. Furthermore, the essay should not merely summarize the content but should engage in a critical analysis, evaluating the impact of Edwards' persuasive techniques and the enduring relevance of his message. Balancing the historical context with contemporary relevance poses an additional challenge. A successful essay should bridge the gap between the 18th-century sermon and the modern reader, highlighting the enduring themes that resonate across time. This demands a nuanced approach, blending literary analysis with historical insight and philosophical reflection. In conclusion, writing an essay on \"Sinners In The Hands Of An Angry God\" necessitates a thorough understanding of historical and religious contexts, coupled with the ability to analyze complex language and rhetoric. However, the endeavor offers a unique opportunity to explore the intersection of literature, history, and theology, resulting in a gratifying intellectual journey.

Review Of Dracula By Bram Stoker Blood Lust The amount of crazed vampire stories within this world continuously grows despite the amount of creativity that can go into the description, and characterization of said vampires being quite limited. There would only be so many possibilities for scenes, situations, and character designs if authors went by nothing more than the characteristics of the vampires in Bram Stokers Dracula. Because of this, authors continue to create more and more ridiculous scenarios as well as more and more advanced vampires. The comparison of the way vampires look, respond to environmental stimuli, and act in social situations in books like Dracula or The Chronicles of Vladimir Tod, as well as book series such as Blood Lad and Twilight, is quite drastic. Every vampirein movies or novels essentially has the same cold body functions of the dead pale, chilled flesh, lack of a heartbeat. Dracula had these characteristics, along with being clad in black... who is clean shaven aside from a long, white moustache. Dracula lived in a Gothic era where he wore a double breasted vest, white shirt, black slacks, fancy shoes, a pocket watch, and a fake smile on his face. These kind looks, as well as his charisma, made people trust him more. In the novel, it is written that ...The count s greeting is so warm that the Englishman s fears vanish. Modern vampires, unlike Dracula, tend to typically look and act more like teenagers. They are clothed in hooded sweaters, t shirts, and jeans.\n\n3.

Sacrifice In The Kite Runner Sacrifice (and issues related to it) have been an inherent part of literature from the beginning. The intense connection between destruction and creation raises questions about the human capability for violence and love in equal measure and seemingly violates the natural human instinct for survival.

Sacrificeis not simply a matter of giving up one s life or something equal to it for someone else; oftentimes, psychological motivations behind sacrifice are very complex.

He often takes advantage of Hassan s love for him and uses it to pressure him into committing acts such as firing walnuts with his slingshot at the neighbor s one eyed German shepherd (4). In one instance, he goes so far as to tease Hassan into admitting that he would eat dirt if he told him to, and to confess that he finds teasing him to be something fascinating albeit in a sick way (54), though he knows it to be cruel. His occasional antagonism towards Hassan stems in part from his jealousy and his own feelings of inadequacy in regards to the love of his father. Hassan possesses an innate courage and sense of justice and natural athletic abilities, all traits that Amir lacks and that Baba admires. The fact that Amir does not stack up to Hassan in the eyes of their father becomes clear during a conversation that he overhears between Baba and Rahim Khan. Not only does his father not understand his inclination to spend his days reading and writing, he also looks down upon Amir s inability to stand up both for his own self and for others and tendency to let Hassan fight his battles for him. He states unequivocally that A boy who won t stand up for himself becomes a man who can t stand up to anything (22).

Energy Drinks And The European Market Essay Energy drinks were very popular in Asia long before they overtook the American and European market. In 1982, Dietrich Mateschitz tried his first tonic drink in Hong Kong and came up with the idea to introduce these drinks to Europe. In 1984, he established the Red Bull company and started selling Red Bull Energy Drink on the Austrian market in 1987. These days, Red Bullis sold in 164 countries. Since 1987, around 30 billion cans of Red Bull have been consumed, more than 4.6 billion in 2011 (RedBull). After Red Bull became very popular, other brands of energy drinks filled up the shelves of stores. These include Monster, Rockstar, Full Throttle, Amp, Sobe Adrenaline Rush, Rip it, BooKoo, Von Dutch, and No fear. Energy drink companies target mostly young consumers, and in order to gain a success, they make attractive packaging and slogans. For example, Red Bull gives you Wings, (Red Bull), Unleash the Beast (Monster,) Go Full Throttle or Go Home (Full Throttle,) Party Like a Rockstar (Rockstar,) and More Power to You (Amp.) Motivation of using energy drinks Few studies have been done regarding the energy drink consumption patterns among college students.

The watchers in this scenario are everyone. The system put into place by tradition remained the same for so long that the societal norm became something akin to law, and breaking the law resulted in terrible consequences. The society of the 1920s became a Panopticon, a society where the power to discipline does not require an actual observer (Petrovic 152). No one has to actually enforce the gender standards as the government enforced the issue of Prohibition. People existed to keep their own checks and balances, and the patriarchy existed almost like an imaginary deity. That is not to say that sexism did not exist; it did, and it still does, but the patriarchy that people feared was one that they instilled on themselves. Jimmy performs for the world around him based on a set of criteria that America has been too lazy to revise.

Essay about Individuality and Socialization We as a human race have become a byproduct of our society. Through media, technology, and social pressure, humans no longer run society, but it seems like we are run by society. The quote from sociologist Peter Berger states Not only do people live in society but society lives in them This statement is referring to a form of social control were groups and the people in those groups conform to society partially knowingly and partially as a reflection based on dominant social expectations.

Though identity suggests to an aspect of individuality it is really a result of socialization. Identity is how we see ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... While all people conform to society to some degree we all develop aspects of individuality from our different experiences. Individuality is what makes the human race as successful as it is. It adds creativity and change in an otherwise idle society. Without it there would be no change. While all these characteristics of individuality are true there are pressures from society that still eliminate total individuality. Ones individuality is based on pressures of society. A woman will develop individual traits characteristic of a women, such as physical beauty and motherhood. A man will develop certain traits characteristic of a man, such as sports or risky behavior. An individual s races or religions can also have an influence on what a person s individual traits will be. While most humans have a certain amount of individuality, Berger s statement still applies, society lives in us all and there is little an individual can do to manipulate it. Freedom has a large range of meaning. The encyclopedia Britannica defines freedom as the quality or state of being free, and the absence of necessity, coercion, or constraint in choice or action (Britannica). In the American society there is a lot of emphasis on freedom, and the right to be free, but one must question to what extent we are truly free .\n\n12. The Cold War Had A Significant Impact On American Foreign The Cold War had a significant impact on American foreign policy, changing it substantially in both attitudes to social and economic factors. The heavy influence of a difference in political standing between the Soviet Union and the United States, in conjunction with the high tensions that followed in the post war period, set the foundations for American foreign policy to adapt and change to better suit the developing political agender of the time.

In conjunction to this, the fact that Woodrow had declined the US invitation to join the League of Nations after World War 14, further influenced and developed a new American foreign policy during the Cold War. This was a result of a lack of proper dedication of direct support from the US in foreign affairs and therefore in order to seek out foreign aid against the threat of communism and the Soviet Union, they had to adapt their foreign policy to offer a great deal of benefits in order to gain support. The failure of the League of Nations in 19465 aided the US heavily in terms of this regard however, as it allowed them an easier platform to offer isolated foreign powers diplomatic support and form a new allegiance against the larger threat of the Soviet Union. In conclusion there were other factors long before the Cold War began to set the foundations for how American foreign policy was conducted after 1945. However, 1946 was almost certainly an initial turning point in which foreign policy had to be adapted due to the rising tensions of foreign powers and the isolation some countries shared after the League of Nations disbanded. Social factors of the Cold War played a large role both in how the United Stateshad to adapt their foreign policy, as well as how it benefited them in some regards. The US\n\n13. The Ethical Decision Making Models Ethical Decision Making Models Decision making in the field of psychology refers to a cognitive process that results in a selection among multiple possible solutions in a situation (Colman, 2008). Decision making is based on available information from the environment as well as intrinsic information and existing schemas (Rogerson, Gottlieb, Handelsman, Knapp Younggren, 2011). These internal schemas, along with knowledge and personal preferences, influence the decision making process. Ethical decision making differs from normal decision making in that ethical standards influence the decision maker s choice (Rogerson et al., 2011).

In level 3, the counselor makes decisions that society and laws would approve of (societal). Level 4 (individual) refers to the counselors decisions that are based on the needs of the client while at the same time adhering to laws and right and others. Level 5 refers to the counselor s ability to make decisions based on self chosen principles of conscience and internal ethical schemas (principles). Levels 1 and 2 are considered to be low while levels 4 and 5 are considered to have high levels of moral developments. Models of moral development have been integrated into the first models of ethical decision making (Cottone Claus, 2000). There are several ethical decision making models including Kritchner s model, social constructivism, and organizational based models that take into consideration organizational factors and moral intensity. One of the first models for ethical decision making was developed in 1984 by Kritchener according to Cottone and Claus (2000). Kitchener argued that in an absence of ethical standards an individual uses personal value judgment which lead to subpar decisions. Kitchener based her model from previous model of moral development and recommended that counselors should strive to develop a deeper understanding of the implications of behaving ethically. Most decision making models are linear and are based on rational thought (Cottone Claus,\n\n14.

As she is deteriorating from a disease which is unknown to the reader, we see her teeth as the only part of her to remain intact. Egaeus, in a fit of unconsciousness, pulls her teeth from her mouth and finds them in a box next to him when he comes to reality again. Although there is no time shown where he committed the horrendous act, the narrator awakes from his haze by the sounds of a woman s shriek. The teeth were hers, and the narrator was petrified by his actions he had no memory of doing. Poe uses the narrators gaps in memory to emphasize the lack of control he has, and in doing so, proves further that he is an unreliable narrator. Teeth has the symbolic meaning of health and beauty; the narrator saw the love of his life slowly begin to die and decided to keep what he most admired as a symbol of his love, something that would never die.

The Hindus and Muslims do not share any common opinions in which they realized a separation between these two religious nations must occur. Jinnah now finally realized that the Muslim s, as a separate community, had no political prospects in India. They had no chance of sharing political power with the Hindus; they must either surrender their individuality or cut themselves adrift front the Hindus.

On the side of capitalism, the overall aspect and function that centers around this economic system is freedom. Socialismrests upon the idea of governmental control over the majority of a country s resource supply, as well as the public control over means of production and land. In my opinion, I believe the United States will continue to ride on a mainly capitalistic track.

Additionally, the system of free enterprise gives producers the ability to set their own prices of goods, as well setting levels of production.

Unlike capitalism, socialism is a set of ideals that fight for the working class, while handing over a large chunk of economic control to the government itself.

The Origins of Tobacco Tobacco The Spanish and Portuguese word tobacco comes from Tiano, the Awakan language of the Caribbean. The N.Tabacum plant is no longer grown in the wild because it has been so long cultivated. Tobacco originated in Virginia but is now mainly grown in Russia, India and Turkey. The usage of Tobacco is actively practised by approximately 1.1 billion people and up to one third of the adult population. Statistics of smoking show that the use of tobacco has either levelled off or declined in developed countries but still continues to increase in developing countries. After the mid twentieth century tobacco became condemned as a health hazard and was eventually named as a primary cause for cancer as well as other circulation and repertory diseases. In July 2013 the W.H.O (world health organisation) estimated that tobacco caused approximately 5 million deaths per year through direct use and a further 600 000 from non smokers being exposed to second hand smoke (shs).

Revisionist historian Herbert Aptheker has done an admirable job of refuting the claim of many early white historians that slave rebellions were rare in the colonies, and that the black slaves were docile, disinterested, or indifferent to freedom. Neither slave songs nor folklore indicate that blacks either liked or were indifferent to slavery. Black ancestors took advantage of every opportunity to make it clear that they were not created for enslavement.

Negro frustration, Myrdal contended, was subliminated into emotionalism, and Negro hopes were fixed on the afterworld. When Young considered black religious leaders like David Walker, Nat Turner, Henry Highland Garnet, Henry McNeal Turning, and others, he concluded that Myrdal was wrong. This is not to say that every black religious gathering during the days of slavery or since was a seedbed of revolution, nor that every black preacher was a Nat Turner. Yet there is considerable evidence that, historically, black religion was more involved in sociopolitical campaigns for black liberation than previously thought. Historically, black religion has been concerned with freedom, liberation, humanization, and the eradication of social evils in this world. Therefore, as opposed to being fixated exclusively with spirituality and heaven, the black church has been the vanguard of social, economic, and political activism within the black community. In fact, some scholars have gone as far as to identify the black church with the black community, and to suggest that neither can be identified apart from the other. The black church was born in protest against racism in the white church. The type of Christianity that Frederick Douglass characterized as slave holding religion, was a religion of the white status quo. It sought to justify the enslavement of blacks, rather than resist it and work towards its elimination. Reflecting on the period of American\n\n30.

For example, angels are captured flying in the distance watching the people care for the deceased Jesus Christ. They grieve in unison with the crowd down below. Bondonne successfully creates a feeling of three dimensions by including a cluster of people on the far left tucked away in the corner.

Moreover, with the difficulties of finding, processing by hand, and then moving the wood out of the forest, Guajilote was further restricted in the quantity of wood it could handle Capital: Guajilote doesn t invest enough in capital expenditures. A very small percentage of the funds are held back for capital improvement purchases due to the operation s simple material needs.

Additionally, the movement of tectonics is monitored, and the movement can be predicted to some degree. Even though we are able to predict some movement, the timing or an earthquake s force is unable to be predicted at this time. Earthquakes occur when tectonic plates move and grind against each other, thus releasing a massive amount of energy through seismic activity. When this happens, those seismic waves hit the Earth s surface causing the ground to shake in a violent manner. When the waves actually hit the earth, devices called seismometers, which are strategically placed across the world, detect the magnitude of the earthquakes force. All of these elements play an important role in our current understanding of earthquakes. Earthquake Forces When the tectonic plates slip and the energy is released at the earth s surface, endless effects occur as a result. While this is taking place, two types of waves associated with this action result: body waves and surface waves. Both of these categories are divided into sub categories, but they essentially serve the same purpose. Body waves are the first set of waves to hit the earth s surface, and they resemble water waves by the way they move. They slowly move the material, horizontally displacing the soil. Surface waves may move the material horizontally, but they also have the potential to move the ground vertically. Both of these effects present an opportunity for disaster to\n\n38.

By acquiring DreamWorks the main advantage that the company will be able to derive is the fact that this will help the company in consolidating the market position of the company. Another important factor that will probably be a guiding light for the acquisition is the fact that recently the company has not fared well in the box office. This will result in the fact that Pixar will have to pay lesser price while trying to acquire the company. However the company has traditionally challenged Disney at the box office by offering the films that tell stories with a bit more subversion and humor as compared to Disney. The company DreamWorks has also acquired a loyal following in the countries like Russia, Korea, China and Brazil unlike any other studios (Shaw, 2013). Thus if Pixar is able to successfully acquire Dream works then it will able to command a significant portion of the foreign market.

It really showed me the trials and tribulations that a black man went through during times of slavery. In his early years, Douglas lived on a farm where he watched many slaves receive harsh beatings and whippings.

The typical overseer would have beat a slave the second he stepped out of line. For example, Mr. Gore, who took Mr. Hopkins place was very cruel and would not take any sort of talking back. He would not communicate with any of the slaves except for giving orders and beating them. He was, in a word, a man of the most inflexible firmness and stone like coolness (p. 13). There were also those white people who encouraged black people to escape, and them catch them to receive rewards. Slaves could not catch any breaks. On the other hand, there were some good whites. Douglas wanted to learn how to read, so he made friends with some little white boys on the street. Douglas spoke of running errands, and stopping in with the white children to learn to read in his spare time. As a symbol of his gratitude, Douglas would give the children bread to eat. They, in fact, had a discussion about slavery at one point. He told the children, You ll be free as soon as you re twenty one, but I m a slave for life!

The contamination of water derives from environmental challenges as well as human carelessness. The recent event in Flint, Michigan highlighted the availability of clean drinking waterand what it entails if it is not provided to its citizens. There are several federal agencies established to address the issue of pollution, especially clean drinkable water. This should be a concern of most importance as American citizens cannot function or survive without the intake of clean and safe drinking water. Of all the environmental issues faced daily by Americans, none is more critical than contaminated drinking water. The Manufacturing Chemists Association (MCA) is the oldest chemical trade organization. It represents 90% of the production capacity of basic industrial chemicals in the U.S.. MCA cites many people define a water pollutant as anything put into water which was not there in its natural state (Lantz para 1). Although it might not seem contaminated even natural spring water is impure. Cancer,... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... These critics argue that the pollutant levels are not sufficient to cause harm. However; it all depends on the level of contamination. Conversely, the presence or addition of some chemical substances in the right amount may be beneficial or, at least not harmful to particular water uses (Lantz para 7). It is estimated that 95% of the population in high income countries gain access to clean drinking water (Blanchfield para 4). Many argue that federal funding can be better spent addressing other pollutants. Both of these arguments fail to address that clean water must be sustained for the future in order for American to live\n\n46. The Classic Inferno By Dante Alighieri The classic Inferno by Dante Alighieri is beautifully woven to reflect the realities or unrealities of the time. The various circles of hell are used by the writer to tell the tale in a free flowing manner (Havely, 98). Interesting, however, is the manner in which he describes the characters such that they are seen to be facing tragedies in their life in hell. The writer categorizes the different types of sins that people can commit and subjects the characters to various punishments, each of which is in a separate circle in hell. Lawall opines that the writer uses a style that makes the reader envision themselves in the poem (Lawall, 17). In so doing, the writer subjects the characters to relatively tragic states even though they... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... The story narrates that Francesca and Paolo are both punished in hell for their adultery and thus the subjection to the circle of lust (Alighieri, 1012). She expounds that she had been married to Paolo s brother Gianciotto. Francesca discloses that she was not shy of expressing her feelings towards Paolo, who she loved even though she was married to his brother. One day, she reveals, her husband caught them together inside her bedroom and was sure that they were lovers. Francesca opened the door and pretended that all was well before her husband. Unknown to Francesca, Paolo had got stuck in a ladder as he attempted to run away. Gianciotto then killed the two of them, although he had not intended to kill his wife. The circumstance that led to her death is an emphasis of the beauty of love. When Gianciotto jumped to slay Paolo with his sword, Francesca rushed in between and faced the death first. The husband was too disappointed and ended up killing Paolo as well. The portrayal of the two characters as lovebirds and the lack of love between Francesca and her husband show the reality that was then (Alighieri, 1013). The writer further says, through Francesca, that Gianciotto was thrown into the circle of Caina for killing his family members. This assertion, in character is a balanced move to portray both parties (Francesca and Gianciotto) as losers in the fight. However, the fact that\n\n47.

Although, at the time, my most important decision was what Disney princess movie I would watch that day. I aspired to be a strong, capable warrior like Mulan and to make a difference with kindness and compassion like Belle. When you are a kid, the world is at your feet.

We as humans are irrelevant specks in the vast universe that go about our repetitive lives for no apparent reason. At the end of the day, it makes no difference how much good or bad we do in the world. This is the ignorant view of the world that fails to see the perfect harmony in which we all live our lives. The redundant cycles that we try so hard to get away from are part of our overarching connectedness as humans. As parts of a whole, all of us have a role to play in making our lives better for ourselves and others. Our role is the very meaning of life, and we should embrace it wholeheartedly. The novel Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse stresses this cyclical unification through various circular constructions throughout Siddhartha s life. Siddhartha had to deal with many individual stages of his life that seemed pointless. These cycles almost drove him to the point of suicide, but he was saved by the river which acted as a symbol for his entire life, as a united whole. This was the gateway to his attainment of enlightenment, allowing him to feel closer to everyone around him. Siddhartha began as an affluent Brahmin s son, coveted by all close to him. His family and friends greatly admired the level of intuition and intellect that Siddhartha had possessed. Govinda, his best friend, constantly adored him and followed in his footsteps. In this life, Siddhartha began the\n\n49.

Piaget s Four Stages Of Cognitive Analysis Cognitive development involves changes in cognitive process and abilities. Piaget had four stages of cognitive development, which ranges from birth to adulthood. Piaget believes children want to make sense of their experience and understand the world. The age ranges can vary because some kids develop faster than others. Each stage is marked by how kids understand the world. The first stage is sensorimotor thinking, age range infancy (0 to 2 years). In this stage infants acquire knowledge through manipulating objects and sensory experiences. Adapting to and exploring the environment is learned through basic actions. Sucking his or her thumb is an example. Understanding objects, infants understand that objects could be summarized as out of sight, out of mind. Things still exist, even though they can t be seen. Overall, their actions is what cause things to happen in the world. The second stage is preoperational thinking (2 to 7 years).

On the third day Bartlebystunned his boss by preferring not to comply with his boss s request. Bartleby s refusal to comply was at first directed at anything outside of his copyistresponsibilities, but gradually shifted toward refusing to do anything including his responsibilities as a copyist.

Analysis Of The Poem The Daughter Of The Dancers The Virtue Of Innocence Innocence is a glorified trait in nearly any culture around the world. Many strive to keep the innocence they are born with, and plenty others spend a lifetime attempting to regain the innocence they have lost with age. In the following photos, innocence is a common theme, which each photographer approaches in a unique way. There is a dull and unsettling truth behind the innocent demonstration of young ladies acting much more mature than their age. Manuel Alvarez Bravo is one of the premier figures of modern photography and the main photographer among the immense Mexican artists of the twentieth century. In The Daughter of the Dancers, Bravo illustrates the idea of youthfulness on the verge of loosing its innocence. Sally Mann, a photographer from the 1980s 90s, caught a reflection of grown up moves inside the innocence and youth of adolescents in Candy Cigarette through her utilization of organization, field point, and technique. In 1985 National Geographic photographer Steve McCurry went through Afghan towns concentrating on the evacuees and recording their hardships.
