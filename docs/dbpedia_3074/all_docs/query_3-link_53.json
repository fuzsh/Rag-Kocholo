        "text": "Legendary Pictures founder Thomas Tull tells the Hamilton College alumni bulletin (which is apparently now breaking showbiz news) that if a Superman sequel does get made, the Man of Steel will be more of an “angry god.”\n\n*\n\nDirector Steven Soderbergh will screen his new, two-part Che Guevara (inset) biopics at next month’s Cannes Film Festival. Both films will star Benicio del Toro as the revolutionary, but the first, called “The Argentine,” will be set in the 1950s, while the second, “Guerrilla,” picks up with Guevara’s 1964 visit to the UN.\n\n*\n\nNick Stoller, director of “Forgetting Sarah Marshall,” is staying in business with Judd Apatow. Smart man. Variety reports that Stoller will write and direct an Apatow-produced comedy called “Get Him to the Greek.” It stars Jonah Hill as an insurance adjuster hired to make sure an out-of-control rock star makes it to a show at LA’s Greek Theater.\n\n*\n\nDespite promises from Disney that the studio would film all seven of C.S. Lewis’ “Narnia” books, producer Mark Johnson told an audience at last week’s Comic Con that the third movie, “The Voyage of the Dawn Treader,” will be the last.\n\n*\n\nVirginia Madsen has joined the Amelia Earhart biopic, reports ign.com. Hilary Swank will play the famed aviatrix, and Richard Gere will play her husband. It begins shooting in summer."
