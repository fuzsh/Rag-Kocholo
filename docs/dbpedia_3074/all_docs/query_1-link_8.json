Preceded by a historiographical discussion, the book’s main subjects are the origins of the labour movement, the ‘Pueblos Unidos’ rebellion in Querétaro and Guanajuato at the beginning of the Porﬁriato, the attacks on Spanish-owned shops in Mexico City in the critical year of 1915, the cycles of social violence in the far south of the country in the twentieth century, current urban neo-anarchism, public protest during the democratic transition and the social mobilization stemming from the forced disappearance of 43 students from the Ayotzinapa teacher training college. Conﬂict, domination and violence are not only the heuristic guide to the eight chapters, but are also a recording of the usual pulse of a diverse, unfair, unequal and class-conscious society. They also provide a compendium of a history of organization, resistance and collective action aimed at reversing this condition, to reduce its negative consequences or to wreak revenge on the propertied classes. Artisans, rural communities, revolutionary armies, university students or marginalized youngsters, as well as ordinary people, are the star players in this social fabric that they share with caciques, employers, government ofﬁcials, businessmen, police, hitmen and soldiers. The props for popular mobilization were the sociable interactions, both traditional and modern, interacting with liberal, socialist and anarchist ideologies. The Sierra Gorda uprising sought support in the towns to end the dispossession of their lands, making use of the revolutionary ideology of 1848 to bring order to their demands and map out the social democratic republic, while the working classes developed mutualism (founded on liberal principles), and subsequently trade unionism, to provide them with support in case of need and collective bargaining with employers on working conditions and wages; under the inﬂuence of anarchism, they established the Casa del Obrero in\n\nxx\n\nPreface\n\n1912. Associationism was clearly instrumental for the formation of a democratic civil society prior to the Mexican Revolution, even though certain elite groups that seethed with class prejudice regarded the ‘dangerous classes’ with suspicion and the crowd with dread. With the Revolution, society became an arena of conﬂict where land disputes, democratic expectations, old resentments and new problems ﬂourished. One example of this was the confrontation between the popular armies and foreign minorities. Violence against Spanish residents was driven largely by the fact that these immigrants worked in economic niches (groceries, farms, cantinas and textile factories) where they came into frequent conﬂict with the low-income population, in addition to their having links with the Porﬁrio Diaz regime. This conﬂict is moreover an element in the construction of national identity which is afﬁrmed in opposition to the ‘historic enemies’ of Mexican identity, the Spanish colony and the United States. While in many ways the country was modernized in the twentieth century, the legitimacy of the regime was based on its revolutionary origin and the welfare state ‘a la Mexicana’, whose foundations were laid during the presidency of Lázaro Cardenas, rather than on a democratic mandate. The caciques in rural areas and the ‘charro’ leaders within the workers’ movement were the intermediaries between the popular classes and the executive (at the local, state and federal levels ), to which the other branches of government obsequiously subordinated themselves. When those intermediaries were overwhelmed by subordinates, co-optation and force were used over and over again. Guerrero, the most violent state according to recent ofﬁcial statistics, is today the victim of organized crime and the secular victim of social and political violence. As such, Guerrero is the radical synthesis (rather than the exception) of economic backwardness, social inequality and cacique domination, a fact that is sadly illustrated by the forced disappearance of 43 students from the Ayotzinapa teacher training college in Iguala. Popular mobilization has also been constant, as has state repression, resulting in the formation of guerrilla and community autodefensa groups, the latter being the rearguard of a rural society that is confronting violence fostered by organized crime and by the state, the initiator of this unwinnable internal war. To date in the twenty-ﬁrst century, public protest has been recurrent and widespread, not so much because public freedoms have increased since the democratic transition (i.e. the PRI’s loss of the presidency), but because of the dysfunctional relationship between the governed and the governors. From the 2001 N eo-Zapatista Tour, demanding a\n\nPreface\n\nxxi\n\nlaw recognizing the rights of indigenous peoples, to the demonstrations demanding the presentation alive of the 43 Ayotzinapa students (from 2014 to date), state responses have been pitiful or nonexistent, which has bred democratic disenchantment, coupled with war, insecurity, the poverty of half of the population and social inequality that is growing rather than diminishing. After the disappointing Partido Acción Nacional (PAN – National Action Party) administrations, the second of which caused violence in Mexico to increase to levels not seen since the Revolution, the return of the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI – Institutional Revolutionary Party) to the presidency triggered violent demonstrations by neo-anarchists who for years had carried out small acts of sabotage against the symbols of capitalist power (mainly transnational companies and bank branches), occasionally sending explosive devices to government ofﬁcials, religious leaders, executives of large consortia and scientists involved in biotechnology. The return to power of the PRI, the party that had dominated the country for 70 years, and the government of Mexico City being in the hands of the PRD (Party of the Democratic Revolution) a ‘social democratic’ left-wing party fuelled the conviction in these neo-anarchist groups that change would be impossible so long as these parties were the only political options available. The sources used in this study are varied, including documents from court and diplomatic records, Mexican and foreign newspapers, declassiﬁed Department of State reports, webpages of various entities, in addition to pamphlets, press releases and manifestos of radical organizations. The ﬁrst results of these searches led to communications in Mexico, Spain, the United States, Brazil, France and Finland, which have been reworked for this edition. To José Rosales Suasti, I am grateful for the generous supporting documentation that supports Chapter 3, while Professor Marcelo Badaró, of the Universidad Federal Fluminense in Rio de Janeiro, and my assistant Guillén Torres, provided me with several of the sources used in Chapter 7. I am indebted to my longstanding friend Vicent Sanz, who encouraged me to publish the English edition of this volume in the series he co-edits with Professor Scott Eastman. I want to thank Chris Chappell, Senior Editor at Berghahn Books, for making it possible in such a pleasant way. I should also like to thank Philip Daniels for his conscientious translation of the manuscript. Matias Gonzalez Field prepared the index.

Chapultepec, November 2016\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe Historiography of Social Movements\n\nå Halfway through the twentieth century, Fernand Braudel raised a call for establishing a productive dialogue between history and the social sciences whereby history might freely employ indispensable concepts that it was incapable of developing by itself, and the social sciences might acquire the temporal depth they lacked. He went on to state that there would be no social science ‘other than by the reconciliation in a simultaneous practice of our different crafts’. The convergence of history with the social sciences was baptized ‘social history’ and later, in the United States, as ‘historical sociology’ to underline sociologists’ shift towards historiography.1 At the ﬁrst international congress of historical sciences held after the Second World War in Paris, 1950, Eric Hobsbawm was involved in the section on social history, ‘probably the ﬁrst in any historical congress’, as he recalls in his autobiography.2 It gained momentum in 1952 with the creation of the British journal Past and Present, which brought together a group of Marxist historians (Hobsbawm himself, Christopher Hill, Rodney Hilton, George Rudé, and E.P. Thompson), joined by such prominent scholars as Lawrence Stone, John Elliot and Moses Finley. Meanwhile, in the United States, historical sociology took its ﬁrst steps forward with Barrington Moore, the Harvard teacher of Charles Tilly. It would be very hard to ﬁnd a sociologist who has taken better advantage of history than Tilly. With the exception of his ﬁrst book, on the counter-revolution in the Vendée (published in 1964), long duration, which Braudel conceptualized as the history of structures, is the timeframe for Tilly’s analysis, whether it be of social struggles in France, state systems, European revolutions, democracy or social movements worldwide. By 1970, George Rudé had already drawn attention to Tilly’s articles ‘on the concerns of manual and “pre-industrial” labour in nineteenth-century France’. Five years later, the historians from the\n\n2\n\nConflict, Domination and Violence\n\nGerman Democratic Republic who developed the concept of ‘protoindustrialization’ to explain the transition from feudalism to capitalism recognized the debt this concept owed to the pioneering work carried out by ‘American historians Franklin F. Mendels and Charles and Richard Tilly’ in the 1960s.3 With their 250-year history, social movements have been common ground for historians and sociologists for half a century. They are the subject of the last book Charles Tilly published during his lifetime. Tilly was assisted by Lesley J. Wood, whom he asked to work on the book ‘perhaps knowing that he wouldn’t be able to ﬁnish it before his death’.4 The exposition made here seeks to locate it within the problematic ﬁeld where both disciplines came together, to present the previous developments of social history – particularly the work of Hobsbawm, Rudé and Thompson – and thus to place Tilly’s studies in perspective in order to weigh his historiographical contribution and to comment on certain texts on social movements drawn from historical sociology, which, like those of Sidney Tarrow, have interacted with his work.\n\nSocial History on Stage In 1959, two books were published that would bring their authors prominence as notable exponents of social history, at that time identiﬁed with the movement known as ‘history from below’. I refer here to Hobsbawm’s Primitive Rebels and Rudé’s The French Revolution. One is concerned with elucidating the ‘archaic forms of social movements in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries’ (banditry, millenarianism, etc.) and the other with discovering the motivations and the social composition of the revolutionary people.5 More than anyone else, Rudé strove to reveal the internal logic of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century popular protest in response to what the common people considered grievances, injustices or unilateral breaking of the covenant between social groups, or between them and the state. Taking a stand against the widely shared perception, originating in the nineteenth century and theorized by Gustave Le Bon’s social psychology, to the effect that the crowd is irrational and guided by purely emotional impulses, and moreover questioning the supposition of methodological individualism according to which rational choice is an exclusively individual attribute, Rudé found patterns of behaviour that could explain collective action and the repertoire available for achieving collective goals. He dedicated his best-remembered book to the study of ‘what sociologists have termed the “aggres-\n\nThe Historiography of Social Movements\n\n3\n\nsive mob” or the “hostile outburst” – to such activities as strikes, riots, rebellions, insurrections, and revolutions’.6 The French rural revolts in the eighteenth century, motivated by what Ernest Labrousse characterized as a subsistence crisis, were in no sense intended to overthrow the government or to bring down the established order; they simply sought to avoid hunger. In addition to this pressing need, in English cities the crowd protested against the employment of Irish labour, for the freedom of dissidents or for the repeal of certain laws that they considered unjust. The French Revolution triggered the mobilization of artisans who demanded better wages, (but ended up losing the right to freedom of association under the 1791 Le Chapelier Law), the mobilization of the popular classes who sought to stop the prices of basic foodstuffs rising and to practise direct democracy, and the reactionary revolts ‘by the Church and king’ (the Vendée) which were quelled by the government of the National Convention. In Britain, the nineteenth century saw the effectiveness of direct action, with the calculated reinforcement of threatening letters directed to owners and authorities through Luddism, Captain Swing and Rebecca’s Daughters, the latter being unwilling to pay taxes they saw as unfair: Rebecca (as her historian reminds us) was strictly Sabbatarian: she never worked on Sundays and even studiously avoided late night sessions on Saturdays and Monday early mornings. She was remarkably discriminating: only toll gates considered to be ‘unjust’ were dealt with, particularly those studding the side roads, which, through their proliferation, placed a heavy extra cost on the carting of lime.7\n\nIn addition to the immediate motivations of social actors (hunger, work disputes, rights trampled on, etc.) and the organizations that arose (compagnonnages, cells, etc.), it was the forms under which they rationalized their social condition that was fundamental for Rudé. In order to do this, he turned to the concept of ideology, which he considered comprises two overlapping levels: on the one hand, ‘inherent’ ideas arising from everyday experience (a basic notion of rights, of justice or of what is proper); and, on the other hand, ‘derived’ ideas that come from structured political speeches (liberal, conservative or socialist). Synthesis of these was the role of intellectuals, in the Gramscian sense of the term.8 In 1969, Hobsbawm and Rudé published the classic text on the great revolt of English labourers confronting rural mechanization. After analysing the structure of the rising of 1830, its central episodes and following step by step the fate of the insurrectionists deported to Australia, they found that, in spite of the violence, ‘the attacks were\n\n4\n\nConflict, Domination and Violence\n\ndirected against property, not people’s lives’. Based on ‘the silent consensus of the poor’, the dogged struggle of Captain Swing represented the last resistance of the ‘traditional society against its destroyers’. By 1870, modern trade unionism would take charge of the demands of farm workers. Thus, the spontaneous and horizontal protest of subordinates, who were apolitical and often anonymous, and who ﬁnally resorted to direct action in order to put pressure on the ruling classes, were clearing the ground for the workers’ movement: organized, with visible leaderships and a structured ideology; disciplined, having explicit political demands; and using strikes as a bargaining tool.9 Outside the English-speaking world, the French historian Georges Lefebvre in The Great Fear of 1789 (1932) studied peasants’ expectations, attitudes and behaviour towards the Revolution. Albert Soboul, his most eminent disciple, says that Lefebvre changed the standpoint from which the phenomenon of revolution had been studied precisely by looking at it ‘from below’. And, as far as he was concerned, he shifted the interest in rural areas to the city and made a complex characterization of the popular movement of Year II, that of the sans-culottes, which brought together artisans, the unemployed, small business owners and the little people who stood for the control of prices and practised direct democracy in 1793.10 We cannot end this brief review of the studies of preindustrial crowds without mentioning The World Turned Upside Down (1972), a formidable book by Christopher Hill on the egalitarian and radical sects (the Diggers, the Ranters and the Levellers, among others) who made the British monarchy tremble during the English Revolution. This popular alternative to the dominant aristocratic culture, which was preceded by the Gunpowder Plot (1605) perpetrated by Guy Fawkes, whose iconic mask hides the faces of postmodernist rebels and that anticipated the nineteenth-century Luddite movement, would undoubtedly have stood the world on its head: There was, however, another revolution which never happened, though from time to time it threatened. This might have established communal property, a far wider democracy in political and legal institutions, might have disestablished the state church and rejected the protestant ethic.11\n\nAn exploration of some of these historical ‘dead ends’ was the area of study of the twentieth century’s most important social historian: E.P. Thompson. Thompson’s inﬂuential book on the formation of the English working class,12 as well as his later studies on the crowd, took aim, among\n\nThe Historiography of Social Movements\n\n5\n\nother things, at the criteria historians used for classiﬁcation – their distinctions between archaic and modern, preindustrial and industrial, pre-political and political social movements – because he believed that the working class originates from this crowd, as he held that workingclass forms of consciousness were one of the substrates upon which the workers’ traditions were founded. In the 1960s, Thompson and Perry Anderson debated the contemporary crisis in English society and its underlying historical causes, leading them to inquire why there had been no revolution in England like the French Revolution and the consequences this had had for the later development of conservative political culture in the country. Broadly speaking, Anderson argued that the landed aristocracy gradually became an agrarian bourgeoisie (the source of the conservative gene that it never lost), while Thompson argued that the development of the gentry was relatively independent and contradictory, and that it was moreover erroneous to assume that there was an ideal type of bourgeois revolution (the French Revolution), in contrast with an accumulation of imperfect or degraded historical experiences. Where Anderson saw a submissive working class, Thompson highlighted the complexity of its culture and potential for conﬂict, as shown by Luddism.13 In the 1970s, in an effort to understand this, Thompson focused on the conﬂict between the upper and lower classes in the eighteenth century from which modern social classes emerged. The landed aristocracy, triumphant in the Revolution of 1688, consolidated its political and cultural supremacy over society as a whole, a supremacy that was intermittently challenged by subordinate groups. This confrontation went from disputes accompanying a rise in the cost of food, opposing the people’s ‘moral economy’ with the economy of the free market, to the poaching that deﬁed rural landowners’ property rights. The repertoire of actions available to the subordinated population was limited to mocking the gentry, replicating rituals the gentry considered scandalous, or at least in poor taste, and small daily acts of rebellion. The eighteenth-century mob was rebellious and irreverent, ‘but rebellious in defence of custom’.14 The polarization of these two social blocks occurred in parallel with the Industrial Revolution, which, with the ‘accompanying demographic revolution were the backgrounds to the greatest transformation in history, in revolutionising “needs” and in destroying the authority of customary expectations’.15 In this way, the experiences of mechanization, labour discipline and wage labour came together in this process of pre-existing cultural conﬂict at the heart of paternalistic society. In addition, the picture of the emergence of the working class is completed\n\n6\n\nConflict, Domination and Violence\n\nby both the organization that both brought Methodism to its congregation and the dissemination of Thomas Paine’s ideas to craftsmen and small landowners, reinforcing the belief that the Englishman is ‘born free’ (merging spontaneous ideas with elaborate ideologies, as we saw in Rudé). Thus, ‘From 1830 onwards a more clearly deﬁned class consciousness, in the customary Marxist sense, was maturing’,16 allowing the working population to constitute itself as an autonomous subject and claim its political rights in the Chartist movement. Thompson thought of class as a historical formation and not a mere agent in the economic and social structure, as was considered to be the case by certain contemporary sociologists ‘obsessively concerned with methodology’. Thompson brought three interrelated categories into play: class, experience and awareness. Class involves common interests formed through everyday experience. These interests do not arise arbitrarily, since they are linked to the productive relationships in which individuals are joined together, that is, they have a basis in social materiality and are objectiﬁed through experience, which transforms individual human groups into social classes. From this perspective, class exists through its own experience. For this reason, Anthony Giddens recognized that Thompson, author of The Making of the English Working Class, placed strong emphasis ‘upon the capability of the human agents to shape actively and to reshape the conditions of their existence’, and Tarrow noted his suggestion ‘to substitute for the materialist version of Marxism a focus on class self-creation’.17 From the linguistic side of things, the American William H. Sewell Jr. studied the corporate speech of French craftsmen and the emergence of associative speech during the July Revolution, through which working-class consciousness was made explicit (in approximately the same period studied by Thompson for the English case).18 Meanwhile, the British historian Gareth Stedman Jones demonstrated the difﬁculty of considering language as a mere vector of consciousness and not as an epistemological problem in itself, as well as the failure of Marxist political theory, despite the recovery of Gramscian categories by Hobsbawm, Rudé and Thompson. While in Outcast London (1971) Stedman Jones addressed social conﬂict in the Victorian era, in Languages of Class (1983) he revised his theses, especially after reconsidering Chartism, and refuted essentialist conceptions of social classes (Rudé, Hobsbawm and Thompson) in which the ‘social being’ is both its constituent element and the substance of its objective materiality, shifting the analysis towards political languages (as the Cambridge School also did in intellectual history) through which the social being is identiﬁed as such. To that extent, it is\n\nThe Historiography of Social Movements\n\n7\n\nnot possible to ‘decode political language to reach a primal and material expression of interest since it is the discursive structure of political language which conceives and deﬁnes interest in the ﬁrst place’.19\n\nThe Contribution of Historical Sociology The work of Braudel, Hobsbawm, Rudé and Thompson provided signiﬁcant reference points for Tilly, who did not hesitate to admit his intellectual debt to them, even though, at the same time, he distanced himself from the progressive vision of social movements (the step from lower to higher forms of struggle), ascribing to Hobsbawm and Rudé the methodological error of confusing the forms of collective action with the occasions when they occur. Even with the passage of time, Tilly saw no value in making a distinction between archaic and modern movements, nor would he share the implicit assumption that the advance of ‘revolutionary consciousness and organization would eventually sweep away spontaneous and useless protest’.20 Tilly, in fact, shifts his analysis away from the strong concepts of Marxism (economic structure, ideology, consciousness) and the constitution of social subjects (classes) to the basic components of every concerted collective action, the way in which these combine, the mobilization of resources, the structure of political opportunities and external constraints – that is, everything that shapes contentious politics. Tilly and Wood dated the origin of the social movement to the second half of the eighteenth century, with the synthesis of three preexisting elements, which thereafter combined in various ways, giving rise to a wide range of movements. These elements were collective claims on the authorities that were related to a programme, an identity or a position (a campaign); the use of various forms of political action (social movement repertoire), incorporating not only what people do but also what they are capable of doing; concerted public representations of worthiness, unity, numbers, and commitment by participants and their constituencies (abbreviated as WUNC displays).21 Building on Rudé, Tilly and Wood stressed that the London demonstrations that swept John Wilkes into Parliament in 1768 – the repercussions reaching as far as South Carolina, citizenship being the privilege of a very narrow segment of the population at the time – presented a considerable novelty because an election campaign became ‘an occasion for display of popular solidarity and determination’. Even so, it was not until after the Napoleonic Wars that British politics institutionalized social movements. Tilly and Wood recorded the changes\n\n8\n\nConflict, Domination and Violence\n\nthat the turn of the nineteenth century brought for social movements: the repertoire ‘separated increasingly from older forms of signalling support or opposition such as forced illuminations, Rough Music, serenades, and the sacking of houses’ and consequently there was a spread of ‘public meetings, petition drives, public declarations, demonstrations, and shared symbols of membership’.22 Freedom of association, the right that had been hard-won by the working class after bloody battles, was an essential factor for uniting social movements, strengthening their identity elements, creating coalitions and networks (even international ones – for example, the International Workers’ Association) as well as channelling collective demands to the public powers in an organized and effective way to achieve a certain degree of dialogue. Tilly and Wood did not overlook the emergence of the labour movement, and their chapter on the nineteenth century begins with the silk weavers (canuts) of Lyons who, on 25 February 1848, singing the ‘Marseillaise’, left the Croix-Rousse quarter where they had their workshops and marched to the town hall. It was a well-organized campaign reinforced by a varied repertoire with convincing demonstrations of worthiness, unity, numbers and commitment that strengthened the demand to declare the Republic.23 The Chartists would try to do the same thing in England to obtain universal male suffrage, reducing or annulling the census requirements that favoured the propertied classes exclusively. These examples lead us to the theme of popular politics – a trait of modern social movements according to Hobsbawm and Rudé – and to the link between social mobilization and the process of democratization that greatly interested Tilly and Wood. Tilly and Wood’s conclusion, after analysing much of the available empirical evidence, was that, on the one hand, there is no necessary connection between social movements and democracy, and, on the other, the evidence suggests that social movements usually arrive after democratization. When this does not occur, as in authoritarian regimes, they weaken.24 The journey through the twentieth century skips the revolutions that Tilly wrote about shortly after the collapse of the Soviet Union,25 stopping at the youth movements of the 1960s. These ‘new social movements’ started out as a questioning of post-industrial society and a world ruled by adults26 – or, if we think of Mexico, of authoritarianism – incorporating claims as diverse as those of feminism, gay rights, environmental protection, the rights of indigenous peoples and the decriminalization of drugs. Meanwhile, in Eastern Europe, people were exhorted to exercise popular sovereignty. N ever before had social movements spread over so much of the world and never, without\n\nThe Historiography of Social Movements\n\n9\n\ndownplaying local diversity, had they been so homogeneous, happily combining uniqueness with general patterns, which brings us back to the fundamental question Wood poses in the preface to the second edition of Tilly’s book: ‘Why do social movements look so similar around the world, and how and why have such movements become a major form of political action globally?’27 This question also brings us into the twenty-ﬁrst century and the process of the internationalization of social movements. In the nineteenth century, migration ﬂows had driven this tendency, both in the labour movement and other social movements (anarchism in South America and white supremacism in the United States being two prominent cases), but clearly it was a century later when the labour movement became more important, supported by the mass consumption of new technologies that ‘tied social movement participants more ﬁrmly to other users of the same technologies as they separated participants from nonusers of those technologies’. However, despite appearances, the availability of state-of-the-art communication technology increased the divides between different corners of the globe instead of reducing them. The distance between the First World and the Third World is even greater nowadays, and ‘most of the world’s people still [lack] access to social movements as a way to voice popular claims’.28 Tilly and Wood consider the hypothesis that in the future, social movements will disappear or change into radically different political forms, though this would merely be a different way of expressing the same social demands. And this is precisely the thesis of Alain Touraine, who thinks that we are not only entering a post-social era, but that the nature of demands is also changing because ‘the current crisis witnesses the disappearance of the actors of the industrial society’. The crisis in the global economy not only threw millions into precarious circumstances, unemployment and poverty, but also destroyed the capitalist society that we had previously known, since the social actors were virtually wiped out when the cleavage between them and the system was ﬁnalized, and subordinates are now no longer able to form a uniﬁed force capable of resisting unregulated capitalism. The economy became autonomous to the extent that there is no socially controlled power that governs it; thus, henceforth, the conﬂicts (and a possible reconﬁguration of community life) will be between the ﬁnancial economy, which gobbled up the actual economy, and moral subjects, sovereign individuals and holders of universal rights, united by ties of solidarity based ‘on the recognition of the other, since we all have the same fundamental rights’. For Touraine, the disappearance of the social ‘leaves the logic of calculation face to face with the logic of conscience’.29\n\n10\n\nConflict, Domination and Violence\n\nWhile Touraine considers that in the ‘post-social situation’ the class struggle is no longer the main source of conﬂict and proponent of collective demands, Tarrow’s viewpoint is that this never was the case, because he ﬁnds in the states and in capitalism ‘the two major sources and targets of contentious politics’. This is seen in social responses against tax burdens, struggles for the extension of suffrage to subordinates and the creation of a professional police force to contain popular unrest, as occurred in England after the Peterloo Massacre in Manchester in 1819 or in the United States to guarantee the functioning of the free market, according to David Montgomery’s pioneering studies.30 For Tarrow, social movements arise at the same time as the modern state and are sequences of political action based on compact, internal social networks, accompanied by ‘collective action frames’ that have the ability to challenge powerful opponents, whether they be other political coalitions, classes or the state itself. And this collective action becomes contentious when employed by groups that do not have regular access to institutions, being an expression of the popular politics that, Tarrow says, always overlaps with the formal politics practised by the elites. Once states were consolidated, certain forms of popular protest became institutionalized, forcing governments to accept certain ‘forms of collective action whose legitimacy they had earlier resisted, while suppressing others’.31 Tarrow uses the concept of ‘cycles of collective action’ when these extend to society as a whole and can spread through different though often contiguous geographical areas. The ﬁrst of the modern era corresponds to the revolutions of 1848, whose repercussions spread as far as Latin America by encouraging the development of the ﬁrst socialism32 – and the most recent to the Arab Spring. In the twentieth century, the 1968 student movements or the Velvet Revolutions of 1989–91 stand out. The temptation to use the singular and consider them as fragments of a single process oversimpliﬁes their diversity and confuses their underlying causes. Tarrow therefore cautions that they ‘must be disaggregated into innovations they produce, campaigns and coalitions, and mechanisms of mobilization and demobilization’.33 ‘Anti-systemic movements’ is the concept used by Giovanni Arrighi, Terence K. Hopkins and Immanuel Wallerstein to analyse cycles of collective action. Like Tarrow, they recognize the centrality of the state by stating that ‘the actual structures of classes and ethnic groups have been dependent on the creation of the modern states’.34 As theorists of the ‘capitalist world-economy’, they consider that anti-systemic movements began with the romantic revolutions of 1848, with ramiﬁcations that have continued up to the present day:\n\nThe Historiography of Social Movements\n\n11\n\nThe social movements of the late nineteenth century were rooted in the intensiﬁcation of the processes of capitalist centralization, and rationalization of economic activities. A large variety of social groups (servants and peasants, craftsmen and low-status professionals, small traders and shopkeepers), which had up to then coped more or less with the spread of market competition, suddenly found their established patterns of life and work threatened by widening and deepening proletarianization, and reacted to the threat through a wide variety of struggles.35\n\nTaking the only global revolutions that have occurred to date as a framework, those of 1848 and 1968 (whose extensions were the Velvet and other Revolutions of 1989), systemic movements developed in three directions: ﬁrstly, as the vindication of rights, social improvements and political participation within the state (social democracy in the West); secondly, as the seizure of political power on the periphery (communism in the East and in Asia); and thirdly, as wars of national liberation in backward countries (anti-imperialism in the Third World). However, postwar capitalism transformed the structure of the workforce by developing segments of salaried professionals, employees in the service sector (with a large female contingent) and the semiskilled or unskilled workforce (into which migrant workers were incorporated). This would be the basis of the new social movements of the 1960s: the paciﬁstic/environmental/alternative movements, feminist movements and those of the ethnic minorities. Noteworthy consequences of 1968 were ‘the changes in power relations between statusgroups such as age-groups, genders, and “ethnicities”’, which proved ‘to be far more lasting than the movements which brought them to world attention’.36\n\nConclusion While, around the middle of the nineteenth century, the author of History of the French Social Movements from 1789 to the Present (1850), the German Lorenz von Stein, thematized social movements and the French writer Jules Michelet did the same in his The People (1846), it was not until a hundred years later that these were incorporated into the agenda of professional historiography stimulated by the ﬂourishing of British social history and French historiography. The former proposed to explain the emergence and development of the modern labour movement, while the latter dealt with the popular side of the French Revolution.\n\n12\n\nConflict, Domination and Violence\n\nThe articulation between the economy and society was one of the key problems addressed by social historians, given that developments in economic history suggested a quite optimistic vision of the Industrial Revolution by emphasizing the material progress it brought and obliterating the social damage it produced. Friedrich A. Hayek, for example, tried to extinguish ‘the legend that the situation of the working classes worsened as a result of the implementation of “capitalism”’.37 And he would ﬁnd the answer in Hobsbawm’s early studies of workers in Thompson’s classic on the same subject, where Thompson detected that: ‘In some of the lost causes of the people of the Industrial Revolution we may discover insights into social evils which we have yet to cure.’38 Although in Hobsbawm, one has already seen a shift in the labour movement towards the history of the working class, that is, the passage from ‘old’ to ‘new’ social history, it would be Thompson who would make this statement. With it, the working class ceases to be a linear result of the economic process (the Industrial Revolution), acquiring a central role in the process of its formation that, moreover, is inextricably linked to the consciousness of itself, so that the class exists when it identiﬁes itself and acts as such. It should be noted that the link between class consciousness and social mobilization interested Rudé greatly and was the subject of one of his books, in which he dealt with the articulation between the spontaneous ideas of social actors and the ideologies developed by intellectuals. But, like Hobsbawm and Thompson, social class continues to be Rudé’s subject. Touraine reintroduced the factor of consciousness, though dissociated from social class; in other words, conceived in moral terms and at the same time as universality (it should be recalled that for Marx, the working class was the universal class that would unify all the oppressed behind it). While old social history focuses on structural (mainly economic and technological) elements that make social movements possible, as well as the formation of classes, we observe in Thompson the recovery of culture in the anthropological sense as a dimension of social analysis and, in Montgomery, but also especially in Stedman Jones, a rethinking of politics, in addition to an interest in the languages of class that the latter shares with Sewell Jr. In spite of the points of conﬂuence with social history, the approach of historical sociology is different. Tilly and Tarrow, who opted for broad temporal perspectives, in the same way as Braudel in his time proposed for historical discipline, taking into consideration social classes and their motivations, but what mainly attracts his attention\n\nThe Historiography of Social Movements\n\n13\n\nare the mechanisms that trigger collective action and make a particular thing happen at a particular time in a particular place. In this way, the structural analysis that makes explicit the conditions of possibility for events to happen – as Arrighi, Hopkins and Wallerstein suggest – revolves around the speciﬁc factors that activate what Tilly called ‘contentious politics’, highlighting how indispensable elements combine to create a particular social mobilization, particular available resources, the particular structure of political opportunities and external constraints (often those of the state). Social movements, Tilly and Wood conclude, contribute to democracy when they help ‘to expand the circle of participants in public politics’, equalize them ‘in terms of importance’, prevent ‘categorical inequalities’ from being translated into public policy and integrate into this ‘previously segmented trust networks’.39\n\nNotes 1.

The guilds had guaranteed a monopoly over work, the market and craft knowledge; the brotherhoods, linked to the Catholic Church, provided basic safety nets to provide aid to artisans facing hard times. In the early years of independence, both groups declined, in such a way that associationism expanded in the second half of the nineteenth century in response to this decline, the economic setbacks of the early decades of independence, forced recruitment into the army and the liberal order, which nonetheless contributed to the formation of civil society. While they enjoyed a freedom that corporations did not have, mutual societies were not powerful structures that could participate forcefully in labour disputes. However, despite lacking any roots in the production process, they did make a decisive contribution to the socialization of free artisans, workers in the service trades and a segment of industrial workers. They were organizations that were primarily concerned with relief for workers in the event of illness or death. They recognized the equality of their members, were obedient to democratic principles and were careful to avoid internal conﬂict, for which reason they expressly forbade any political or religious discussion. When they managed to amalgamate and gain greater strength, being used for political purposes brought about their downfall. This failure was the common fate of workers’ congresses in the 1870s and, later, of the Casa del Obrero Mundial. Except for minor local government positions, the representatives of the working classes did not attain elected ofﬁce during the nineteenth century. Inasmuch as they were collective actors, workers were relegated from the world of institutional politics, and the leadership groups\n\n16\n\nConflict, Domination and Violence\n\nprovided the link between the two spheres. Their role, in the absence of deﬁned rules, was by and large discretionary, and the weakness of the link was always evident. Given this limitation in terms of their origins, workers’ political action moved into the symbolic ﬁeld, with civic festivities providing the opportunity for collective representation.\n\nMutual Societies In Mexico’s most important cities, there were a large number of artisans who were qualiﬁed in traditional trades,1 though ﬁnding work was difﬁcult because of very low rates of job growth in the period of stagnation after independence, unfavourable competition from imported textiles, economic instability caused by wars and internal conﬂict, inertial population growth, inelasticity of demand and the low status of their trades.2 The Sociedad Mexicana Protectora de Artes y Oficios (Mexican Society for the Protection of Arts and Trades), founded in 1843 in Mexico City, and the Compañía de Artesanos de Guadalajara (Company of Artisans of Guadalajara), founded in 1850, were among the ﬁrst artisan organizations in the country. The former, which still retained such guild remnants as guaranteeing the performance of work to customers or providing basic education to artisans, also had provisions for assistance in the case of a worker’s illness or death, as well as in various other cases. Over time, labour associations became more mutualistic and, by the 1870s, some had evolved towards cooperativism.3 After the Revolution, the state would take charge of social security, fostering the protection of workers through workers’ insurance, implemented during the Alvaro Obregon presidency (1921) and, later on, via the enactment of the Federal Labour Law (1931). In Mexico City, the ﬁrst to organize themselves were hatters and tailors, who, along with shoemakers and carpenters, were among the most important trades in the nineteenth century in terms of size. In 1854, they described the purpose of their association to the Ministry for Development thus: Gathered together, and having authority’s leave, we propose to form a company to which all individuals in the trade will have the right to belong, should they so desire. We have no other purpose than to help one another in those of life’s circumstances when an unlucky craftsman, overwhelmed by the burden of a horrible disease, ﬁnds himself without resources, perhaps lacking the wherewithal to provide for\n\nThe Organization and Collective Action of Craftsmen\n\n17\n\nhis own health or the nourishment of his family, for it should not be concealed from your excellency that upon this class falls misery and need.4\n\nIn spite of the difﬁculties, some trades did acquire a tradition of organization; there are even assemblies on record that formed in the second half of the nineteenth century and survived into the twentieth century (Table 2.1). Such was the case of the Mutual Society of the Trade of Tailors, the Great Family of Artisans, the Fraternal Society of the Trade of Seamstresses, the ‘Union and Concord’ Company of Waiters, the ‘Xicoténcatl’ Society of Foundrymen and Patternmakers, and the Bakers’ ‘Union and Friendship’ Society. Others became unions during the revolutionary period, resulting in, for example, the Restaurant Employees’ Union or the Graphic Arts Union.5 Membership in mutual societies was voluntary, which, in combination with the non-existent support within the productive structure, economic insecurity and the instability inherent in craftsmen’s jobs, accentuated the weaknesses of the societies, leaving them at the mercy of certain leadership groups whose members, though democratically voted into ofﬁce, changed little, as they had greater economic power, perhaps via owning workshops or through having links with the local government.6 Practising a trade, working in an industry, having a profession or a ‘means of making an honest living’, in addition to displaying good behaviour and high moral standards, were the basic requirements for belonging to a mutual society. Formally, decisions were based on the members’ secret vote and, as noted above, religious or political issues were avoided in meetings. To assist members or their families, these associations included savings funds ﬁnanced by contributions from each member. These were sporadically used to make loans to members, support striking workers, establish cooperative workshops and provide education. The number of afﬁliated workers could be important, but economic insecurity and voluntary afﬁliation made it impossible to consolidate a stable base of unionized workers.7 On 26 November 1871, the printers Juan de Mata Rivera and Francisco de Paula Gonzalez, with another ten artisans, founded the Society of Workers of the North Pole, which admitted workers of all classes. From this emerged the Gran Círculo de Obreros de México (Great Circle of Workers of Mexico), which sought to improve the economic and moral situation of working-class members, train them and broaden their civic knowledge, defend them from the excesses of both capitalists and master craftsmen, bring workers together nationally, and pro-\n\n18\n\nConflict, Domination and Violence\n\nTable 2.1 Craftsmen’s Organizations Guilds 1788\n\nMutual Societies 1853–76\n\nMasons\n\nStonecutters and Masons\n\nThe art of reading\n\nSocialist Society of Mexican Typographers Mexican Typography Printers Regenerator of the Most Noble Art of Gutenberg Fraternal Society of Bookbinders\n\nAssociation of Graphic Arts and Adjuncts of the Federal District Union of Graphic Arts Typesetters ‘Diaz de Leon’ Typographical Society Union of Bookbinders, Scribers and Similar Lino-typographical Union Union of Typographical Press Operators\n\nApothecaries\n\nPharmaceutical Fraternal Society\n\n‘Practical Pharmacy’ Society\n\nGreat Family of Artisans\n\nGreat Family of Artisans\n\nStonecutters\n\nStonecutters Mutual Society\n\nUnion of Mexican Stonecutters\n\nCarpenters\n\nProgressive Society of the Union of Carpenters, Trade of Carpenters Woodcarvers and Similar Fraternal Society of Carpenters\n\nCoach Builders\n\nWorkers of the Future of the Trade of Coach Builders Fraternal Society of the Trade of Seamstresses\n\nTanners\n\nMusicians\n\nAssociations 1918\n\nFraternal Society of Seamstresses\n\nFraternal Society of the Trade of Tanners ‘Xicoténcatl’ Society of Foundrymen and Patternmakers\n\n‘Xicoténcatl’ Society of Foundrymen and Patternmakers\n\nPhilharmonic of Mutual Aid\n\nPhilharmonic Union Philharmonic Co-fraternity\n\n‘Union and Concord’ of the Trade of Waiters\n\n‘Union and Concord’ of the Trade of Waiters Union of Restaurant Workers Union of Restaurant Employees Cosmopolitan Centre of Waiters Mutual Society of Restaurant Waiters\n\n‘Union and Friendship’ Society of the Trade of Bakers\n\n‘Union and Friendship’ Society of the Trade of Bakers\n\nThe Organization and Collective Action of Craftsmen\n\nHairdressers\n\nHairdressers and Phlebotomists\n\nSilversmiths\n\nSilversmiths and Sheet-Beaters\n\nTailors\n\nTrade of Tailoring for Mutual Aid\n\nHatters\n\nPrivate Society of Mutual Aid Hatters’ Fraternal society Union of Hatters Hatters’ Mutual Society\n\nReformer of the Trade of Hatters\n\nUnion of Rope-Makers and Hatters\n\nSilk Weavers\n\nFraternal Union of Weavers\n\nGuild of Cotton Thread and Cloth Workers\n\nShoemakers\n\nHope of Shoemakers\n\nUnion of Shoemakers ‘Santa Cruz’ Guild of Shoemakers\n\n19\n\nFraternal Society of Hairdressers\n\nMutual Society of the Trade of Tailors\n\nSources: ‘Relación de los gremios, artes y oﬁcios que hay en la nobilísima Ciudad de México (1788)’ [Report of the Guilds, Arts and Trades Existing in the Most Noble City of México (1788)], Biblioteca Nacional, ms. 1388 (451), in Kicza, Colonial Entrepreneurs, 1983; Illades, Hacia la república del trabajo [Towards a Republic of Work], pp. 109–10; ‘Asociaciones registradas en el Departamento de Trabajo hasta mayo del año de 1913’ [Associations Registered with the Department of Work up to May 1913]; ‘Directorio de asociaciones en la República’ [Directory of Associations in the Republic], pp. 52–55.\n\ntect industry and development of trades. The Gran Círculo established branches in factories bordering the capital, in others around the country and at mutual societies in Mexico City, for example, the branch established at the Águila factory in Contreras in 1872. Membership increased rapidly. By 1873, there were four branches; two years later, there were twenty-eight; and by 1878, the total came to thirty-four. It also had about forty mutual societies in Mexico City itself. The Gran Círculo shared a newspaper with a number of Mexico City mutual associations. This was El Socialista, founded by Juan de Mata Rivera in July 1871, with a weekly column describing its activities and helping to coordinate its membership. The organization’s original rules are unknown. At the outset, the Gran Círculo was probably a kind of mutual society, accepting individual and collective membership. Statutory reform on 25 May 1874 concentrated power in the leadership, subordinating members and branches to the central board’s decisions. It proposed the formation of a general savings fund, distinguished the central circle (consisting of members living in Mexico City and branch members from outside the capital who, if they were unable to attend,\n\n20\n\nConflict, Domination and Violence\n\nwere represented by Mexico City residents) from the branches scattered around the country, each of which was to have a minimum of twenty members, established that the board of directors would be formed by the executive (president, vice president, accountant, archivist, four secretaries and two pro-secretaries as alternates, plus a ﬁnance committee and one representative for every twenty members) and empowered the branches to appoint deputies to the centre circle, including the option of ceding the seat to members who lived in the capital.8 Largely thanks to the work of the Gran Círculo, on 5 March 1876, the Constituent Workers’ Congress was inaugurated in the presence of thirty-ﬁve deputies accredited by the various associations, which grew to 173 in June, when the Congress had its largest attendance. On 16 September, it promulgated the ‘Act of Constitution of the Great Confederation of Associations of Workers of the United Mexican States’, providing a six-month period for the drafting of its internal constitution, which would only deal with the more general aspects. Subsequent steps, aimed at reﬁning the regulatory text, would require the approval of the majority of organizations assembled at the Congress to acquire force of law, giving rise to the First Constitutional Assembly. Pending this, the Congress would continue in ofﬁce, though this did not actually happen as it was suspended several months later.9 The Second Workers’ Congress, attended by thirty-three representatives from twelve different associations, began work on 14 December 1879 in Mexico City. Its numbers gradually diminished until none but the representatives from the Gran Círculo remained. Nonetheless, the standing committee – whose members included Pedro Ordóñez and José María González y González, who had also participated in the 1876 Congress – remained in operation until 1894. After the schism that gave rise to the National Labour Congress, the Second Workers’ Congress was reorganized in January 1895 and continued for a further eight years.\n\nWorkers and the Public Sector It was at civic festivities that the public presence of organized workers was fully recognized. The civic ritual, with its republican character, was at once a sphere for representation and a source of legitimacy. At these celebrations, the authorities (once religious, now civil) assigned workers a place and gave them a public voice. Civic festivities helped to consolidate workers as collective subjects by providing a space for their companionship within the symbolic republican ﬁeld.\n\nThe Organization and Collective Action of Craftsmen\n\n21\n\nIn colonial times, artisans participated in religious festivals. Year after year, urban workers came together en masse at the Corpus Christi procession, which was the most popular in Mexico City. Workers marched, each ﬂourishing the banner of their respective brotherhoods. Each trade, convened as a guild, had its patron saint, who they celebrated on his or her saint’s day. After independence, without forsaking their participation in church celebrations, workers gravitated towards the civil arena. Mutual societies were jealous practitioners of funerary rites when one of their members died, and the Gran Círculo was invariably present at republican anniversaries: the tributes to Benito Juarez, the Grito de Dolores and the 5 May celebrations. They also commemorated heroes and great patriotic events by selecting a meaningful date for the inauguration of a workshop, starting a conference, opening a library, distributing diplomas or investing an executive board.10 In the restored republic, the anniversaries in which workers participated were secular. Emphasis was placed on the birth of the independent nation, the fate of the republic and the defence of sovereignty. Hidalgo, Juarez and Zaragoza were the most important ﬁgures in the workers’ pantheon, though Juarez was pre-eminent. By exalting these heroes, they not only made them their own, but also reminded the state of their own contribution to the makeup of the country. Public holidays thus gave status within the body politic to citizens of the republic of work.11 The relationship between mutual societies and President Juarez could not have been better. Several of their members enrolled on the republican side during the French intervention and, when the republic emerged victorious, mutual societies increased nationwide. Juarez himself supported these groups directly. Upon his death, workers were stricken with grief. The Gran Círculo attended Juarez’s funeral and the commemorations of the anniversary of his death. In 1872, they sent a large assembly to the San Fernando Cemetery, carrying the banner of ‘Peace and Progress, in mourning and veiled in black’; ‘All the arts and trades were represented there, as well as some societies’. Their banner was placed on one side of the platform ‘as a sign of distinction of the Gran Círculo de Obreros’; on the other side was ‘the ﬂag of the president’s honour guard’, as one newspaper reporter pointed out. The tailor Victoriano Mereles spoke on behalf of the organization, stressing the crucial importance of the Reform Laws for workers, because it was thanks to these that ‘the Mexican people pulled down the rampart raised by the clergy, destroying the progress of man who must undertake a historic mission on earth: the conquest of social rights’.12 On the following anniversary of Juarez’s death, the Gran Círculo invited all its members in the capital, ‘including any able to attend from\n\n22\n\nConflict, Domination and Violence\n\nnearby towns to take part in this popular demonstration’, whereby ‘on this day, the children of labour honour the memory of an illustrious man’. After meeting at the building of the Gran Círculo, the afﬁliated societies lined up their representatives, based on seniority. The commission of the Gran Círculo brought up the rear of the parade, which, accompanied by a military band, would march down the streets of Plateros, Profesa, San Francisco and Santa Isabel, then along the Avenida de los Hombres Ilustres to the San Fernando Cemetery. These parades always took place on Sunday, even if this was not the exact anniversary of Juarez’s death. Neighbours were also asked to decorate their homes. Finally, speakers would ascend an expressly constructed platform and recite poems that had been written specially for the event. And this would continue, year in, year out.13 Confronted by the suspicion that they harboured secret political ambitions regarding the presidential election of 1876, the organizers were forced to clarify that this was merely a ‘proper tribute to the man who had given Mexico its constitution and reform laws, and who had defended the country’s rights from the foreign enemy with a ﬁrm hand’. On this occasion, the parade was complemented by a literary evening presided over by the son of Juarez himself, Benito Juárez Maza, who was given ‘a special invitation from the board of the Gran Círculo’. Having committed themselves thus far, the leaders of the group took the opportunity to put him forward as a representative on the Workers’ Congress that was taking place at the time. The idea was ‘enthusiastically accepted’, though nothing came of it. Once the speeches and poems had come to an end, ‘the young Juarez thanked the Gran Círculo and the speakers for the demonstrations of sympathy directed to his father’. Later on, ‘he was accompanied to the street by many individuals who had taken part in the ceremony, all carrying lights in their hands as a sign of great affection’. The article closes by congratulating ‘the artisans of Mexico’ on the commemoration, as ‘honouring the memory of Juárez is honouring patriotism, it is strengthening democracy, strengthening law and order in our country’.14 Punishment and reward guided the state’s relationship with the Gran Círculo, while subordination governed the behaviour of its leaders. In the end, intervention in party politics led to the organization’s downfall. The ﬁrst important conﬂict occurred when a signiﬁcant contingent of representatives of the 1876 Workers’ Congress decided to endorse Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada as candidate for president against José María Iglesias and Porﬁrio Díaz. Subsequently, another campaign that contributed to the fragmentation of the Gran Círculo was when Trinidad García de la Cadena’s political aspirations found sup-\n\nThe Organization and Collective Action of Craftsmen\n\n23\n\nport among the membership, whereas General Porﬁrio Diaz supported Manuel Gonzalez.15 The price was paid in 1882: the Gran Círculo lost its government subsidies as well as custody of the St Peter and St Paul building in central Mexico City. If the labour movement that emerged during the restored republic was weak, the Porﬁrio Diaz regime managed to render it ineffective until just before major strikes broke out in 1906. A symptom of this change in the labour movement was the Convención Radical, an association founded in May 1886 by Colonel Enrique A. Knight, who also published a newspaper of the same name. Later that year, its founders were displaced by the group headed by Pedro Ordóñez, who emphasized its mutualist policy and marginalized Knight’s civic project, which aimed to instruct the working classes in republican values and practices. The conﬂict came to an end when the Colonel’s group was expelled on charges of attempting to put an unmistakably political stamp on the organization. Political participation would be guaranteed as the right of the individual, but in no case should the society ‘as a corporation’ be involved. The plan of action drafted in 1888 broke with this apolitical direction, summoning the working classes to participate in public affairs, form an alliance with the government, forgo strikes and promote industrial development policies. From this moment until around 1903, the Convención Radical was associated with the Second Workers’ Congress, maintaining its commitment to the Constitution of 1857.16\n\nCollective Action The freedom that the Constitution of Cádiz gave workers to exercise their trades was not accompanied by the protection that had characterized production under guilds. The power of craft guilds in New Spain was based on monopolies of work (including the process of trade apprenticeships), the market and corporate representation within the state, and so the opening up of the market undermined the guild’s privileged position. The ﬁrst major response was the Parian riot in November 1828, when a crowd of about ﬁve thousand people ransacked and destroyed several luxury shops in the Parian building located in the heart of Mexico City. The problem persisted throughout the century and, in November 1861, a group of about two thousand craftsmen and some women, led by the tailor Juan Cano, comptroller of the Gran Familia de Artesanos, marched through the Alameda demanding protection for domestic industry and jobs. They managed to get the Chamber of Deputies to listen to them, but not to deal with their demands. The\n\n24\n\nConflict, Domination and Violence\n\nliberal press turned against them, arguing both that they had no right to break into the Congress and that the leaders had manipulated the workers because free trade made goods cheaper, which increased their purchasing power. In the event, it was a Catholic newspaper that supported the protectionist petition.17 In any event, the affected artisans’ interest in their own sector did become a matter of public debate and highlighted the obstacles to a possible alliance between workers and the Liberal government, for while it was true that the Liberal government was sympathetic to associationism, it was also deﬁned by its doctrinal postulates that ascribed the status of natural law to its economic dogmas. After the French intervention, Juárez offered ‘protection’ to mutual societies. In the 1870s, the tailors, hatters and typographers of several Mexico City establishments went on strike. The waistcoat makers of Casa Cousin stopped work in August 1872 because the owner lowered the price of ﬁnished garments by two reales. And in May 1875, the milliners in the centre of the capital stopped work because their daily wages had been reduced. After three months and following ofﬁcial arbitration, workers grouped together in the Sociedad Reformadora del Ramo de Sombrerería – Branch 24 of the Gran Círculo – managed to renegotiate their work rates. The typographers of the Imprenta del Supremo Gobierno unsuccessfully attempted the same thing in August 1878.18 Although worker protest died down during the Porﬁriato, it revived towards the end of the dictatorship, with strikes at Cananea and Rio Blanco, and increased again during the Revolution, when it became easier for workers to associate and the armed struggle undermined the working classes’ standard of living. The Madero administration set up the Labour Department to regulate the labour sector and arbitrate between the factors of production. One of the ﬁrst conﬂicts it dealt with was the textile workers’ strike in Mexico City, Puebla, Veracruz and Tlaxcala, in which those striking demanded increased wages and a tenhour working day. In January 1912, Madero received a commission of the strikers and listened to their requests. Before the end of the month, industrialists and workers agreed to shorter working hours and a wage increase of 10 per cent, which ended the strike, but did not settle the dispute, as employers found ways to swindle workers out of the promised wage increase.19 The Casa del Obrero, founded in September 1912 and renamed the following year as the Casa del Obrero Mundial (COM), brought together a small number of Mexico City mutual societies, comprising stonemasons, textile workers, tailors and coachmen. Having been silenced under the Huerta dictatorship, the COM entered a pact with Constitutional-\n\nThe Organization and Collective Action of Craftsmen\n\n25\n\nist forces in 1915 to restrain the Convencionista armies of Villa and Zapata, but also tried to seize the opportunity to expand its presence in the country. This ended the relationship with the Constitutionalists, leading to the dissolution of the ‘Red Battalions’ within six months.20 While this happened, the capital city suffered shortages and galloping inﬂation, the COM supporting both strikes and worker unionization. In November 1915 alone, the following workers’ groups were formed or reorganized: cigarette and cigar makers, carpenters and carvers, tailor operators, tailors’ cutters, Foundrymen and Patternmakers, hatters, shoemakers, drivers of carriages for hire, seamstresses, hairdressers, dyers, Federation of Workers and Employees of the Tramways Company of Mexico, Federation of Workers in Yarn, Fabric and Similar, Federation of National Artillery Repair Workers.21\n\nVarious productive divisions suspended activities in 1915, notably masons, restaurant workers, drivers of carriages for hire, tailors, electricians and streetcar workers. In November, bakery and graphic arts workers went on strike. The bakery workers, said to number over three thousand, demanded ‘a slight increase in their wages, an increase which is the more justiﬁed when the high cost of necessities and the exaggerated proﬁts obtained by the owners of bakeries are taken into account’. Meanwhile, the Graphic Arts Union was demanding ‘increased wages, recognition of its character as a union, abolition of ﬁnes and everything that workers should require who wish to emancipate themselves’, the objective being accomplished by a strike lasting little over a week. Moreover, the spinning and weaving workers of San Antonio Abad ‘who recently went on strike to require of their employers, among other things, increased wages, division of capital at some factories and recognition of their union, have just obtained an important part of their negotiations’.22 Other guilds resorted to negotiations to improve workers’ wages. This was the case of carpenters, who presented a memorandum of demands to owners, among which a wage increase of 150 per cent stands out: To this end, a meeting was called between the industry’s owners and workers, so that both parties could explain their reasons in defence of their interests. After a session that lasted several hours, the owners agreed fully to the rates that would determine wages from that date. In addition, they have achieved recognition of their union, an 8-hour working day and certain other beneﬁts.23\n\n26\n\nConflict, Domination and Violence\n\nFemale workers also became unionized and were extremely combative in their protests. Accordingly, in November 1915, ‘some 300 comrades assembled, including cigarette makers, seamstresses and corset-makers’ at the COM ‘to exchange ideas and ﬁnd out how they could unionize’. In addition, cork-makers and bonnet-makers created a union, while afﬁliation to the Seamstresses’ Union climbed to over 300.24 At the ‘El Salvador’ and ‘La Perfeccionada’ factories, bonnet-makers went on strike on numerous occasions because administrators refused to increase their wages, and as these were extremely low, ‘they had declared a strike after exhausting all the means of persuasion they had at their disposal’. After several days on strike, workers at ‘El Salvador’ negotiated ‘a salary increase of 100%’, while at ‘La Perfeccionada’, in addition to the wage demand, they negotiated union recognition and the reinstatement of an unfairly dismissed worker.25 As far as the Constitutionalists were concerned, the strikes were not at all welcome, and far less so when they did not need the support of the unions and mutual associations in the clashes with the popular armies. Confrontation between the government and workers escalated with the general strike on 31 July 1916, sponsored by the Federación de Sindicatos Obreros del Distrito Federal (FSODF – Federation of Labour Unions of the Federal District), which since May had been demanding that workers be paid in gold, given the constant depreciation of paper currency, which reduced their meagre purchasing power yet further. The government’s attitude towards the strike was blunt: the COM was dissolved and orders were given for its leaders to be arrested, as well as instructions for strike breaking and the militarization of the railways. A telegram from Venustiano Carranza, the First Chief of the Constitutionalist Army, from Mexico City dated 11 August 1916, ratiﬁed the use of force: ‘strikers arrested in this capital are being tried under the Law of January 25, 1862 for the crime of rebellion and treason by ordering suspension of work at the Necaxa plant’. For its part, the COM argued that right and reason were on the side of the workers, and that therefore those directly responsible for the strike were the capitalists; thus, the only thing was to ‘avoid crimes such as those at Cananea and Rio Blanco’.26\n\nConclusion The Gran Círculo was active for barely eleven years. Even so, this was long enough to develop comradeship amongst workers and extend its inﬂuence nationwide. It was also a vehicle for the secularization of\n\nThe Organization and Collective Action of Craftsmen\n\n27\n\npublic space and the formation of civil society, although it never completely managed to shake off state patronage; indeed, it never even raised the matter but constantly sought to recover the protection it had lost. The consolidation of the organization was never achieved both because of the limitations implicit in voluntary afﬁliation as well as the type of groups that amalgamated, many of which had no roots in the production process, but merely represented the addition of free and independent wills, united to provide relief and mutual aid. Its legal regulations worked in the same way: by limiting these groups to the civil sphere, they reduced their strength on the political level, which was indispensable in terms of handling workers’ demands. Thus, they were trapped within the vagaries of daily politics, with the aggravating problem of acting in circumstances that were themselves full of conﬂict. At the turn of the twentieth century, after two decades of peace in industrial relations, industrial workers created the ﬁrst national unions, which put up stubborn resistance to foreign companies. And, during the armed struggle, associationism spread in the cities where the trades were reorganized, achieving successful wage negotiations, often with the mediation of the COM, which at ﬁrst had a good relationship with the revolutionary governments. However, when the Constitutionalists defeated the Division del Norte, they got rid of their worker allies and behaved ruthlessly towards the general strike when it was triggered by the electricians of Mexico City. Despite their apparent hostility towards organized labour, the northern warlords used various resources to procure its loyalty, ranging from violence to the vision for a new legal and institutional framework for the world of work to attention to the most sensitive demands of labour. Even Carranza increased wages prior to the conﬂict with members of the FSODF, and Obregon pursued a policy of rapprochement and co-optation of the leaders, which took shape as the corporate pact upon which the postrevolutionary state was based. The Confederación Regional Obrera Mexicana (CROM – Regional Confederation of Mexican Workers), founded in May 1918, soon became the ubiquitous trade union arm of the regime, while the labour movement renounced direct action as a method of struggle.27\n\nNotes 1.

Some of these were caused by the seizure of communal property, others by the expansion of the haciendas at the expense of the towns, by the threat to autonomy or by peasants’ lack of social mobility. The state did very little to remedy the situation, partly because its links with landowners were very solid, but also because institutional and economic weakness made even the contemplation of action impossible. Rebellions with socialist goals, such as that led by the young peasant Julio López, were nevertheless few in number. Tutored by Plotino Rhodakanaty, López took up arms against landowners in Chalco, State of Mexico, in 1868, proclaiming the ‘Manifesto to all the oppressed and poor in the Universe’. Opposing human exploitation, this rejected all forms of government, churches and priests, seeking peace and order, the free use of land and the creation of agricultural societies, and aimed at achieving the ‘Universal Republic of Harmony’ and socialism.1 In addition to the restitution of land to the people and endowments of workable land to the soldiers of the revolutionary army, the rebels of the ‘Pueblos Unidos’ of the Sierra Gorda outlined a form of federal government, structured from the bottom up, in which ofﬁcials were required to respond to the petitions at the base of the body politic. Like the 1868 Chalco Rebellion, the 1879 rebellion was related to the socialist nucleus Rhodakanaty had formed in Mexico City, but, unlike the former, occurred in a context where urban and rural workers were beginning to organize, so that it resonated considerably, so much that some liberal writers viliﬁed it. Prison and public execution were the reward of those directly participating in rebellion. Even so, by incorporating the redistribution of land within its ideology and demanding the implementation of ‘Agrarian Law’, the ﬁrst socialism would be injected into the Mexican Revolution of 1910, when this agrarian demand became very powerful.\n\nThe ‘Pueblos Unidos’ Rebellion\n\n31\n\nThe Mexican Socialist Confederation Plotino Constantino Rhodakanaty was a Greek homeopath who, in 1871, formed ‘La Social’, an association ‘for society’s poor and underprivileged classes’. Its members, according to the press, were ‘persons of both sexes, having the noble purpose of spreading teaching among themselves and disseminating it to the masses’, giving ‘great credit’ to its founder, ‘making him the centre of a multitude of citizens, who think of him as an apostle, who consult him as a guide and as a friend’.2 Its ‘inauguration and reinstallation’ in May 1876, included the issuance of a regulation which consisted of a declaration of principles and basic rules under which the organization would proceed. The ‘Central Organizing Committee’ was in charge of direction, including, among other duties, presiding over the ‘Great Assembly of Foreign Delegates or Representatives of the Towns’ to which they could give ‘discreet instructions’. Meanwhile, Rhodakanaty stressed the importance of agrarian law ‘that will be so favourable to indigenous people and rural families in Mexico’.3 One year later, Francisco Zalacosta, editor of La Internacional and the most active of Rhodakanaty’s disciples, travelled round the states of Mexico, Puebla, Tlaxcala and Hidalgo to bring communities closer to the organization, proclaim ‘agrarian law’ and organize, on 15 August 1877, an assembly of peasants in Mexico City to establish the Gran Comité Central Comunero, which also included the participation of Colonel Alberto Santa Fe, the Tetela political chief, appointed in 1872. Shortly before the end of the year, the Mayor of Texcatepec, Hidalgo, unleashed a campaign against the ‘communists’, in response to the federal mandate to ‘hang all the troublemakers’ and instructing the security forces to ‘shoot anyone I think is a communist’.4 Whether it was to deﬁne to or to bring them into disrepute, state governments and the press had dubbed several peasant rebellions ‘socialist’ in Ciudad del Maíz, in the Sierra Gorda – a complicated region bordering the states of Querétaro, Guanajuato, Hidalgo and San Luis Potosi – and other surrounding areas.5 Santa Fe, who would visit Victor Considérant in exile in Texas, published Ley del Pueblo in 1878, where he proposed abolishing haciendas and distributing rural property in small plots conceded to peasant families by the municipalities, which would be paid off over a period of ten years with an annual interest rate of 6 per cent, with inputs and draft animals provided. The expropriation ‘for public utility’ would be ﬁnanced by the Banco Agrícola e Industrial through the issue of unconvertible currency notes (billetes de curso forzoso) up to a maximum of\n\n32\n\nConflict, Domination and Violence\n\nﬁfty thousand pesos in value. The bank would also offer soft loans to societies of artisans to install factories and workshops. Under no circumstances would water or forests remain in private hands, the entire community participating in their enjoyment. He also fought for economic protectionism and industrial development policies that would encourage the creation of arts and trades workshops in the states. He considered the removal of sales taxes and other barriers to internal trade, in addition to direct taxes on capital to strengthen public ﬁnances. He demanded free, compulsory primary education for both sexes, and free education at the middle and higher levels. He spoke in favour of severely punishing crime and establishing a policy of crime prevention. The army would be reduced to a minimum of ﬁve thousand men, leaving defence of the nation in the hands of the citizens themselves.6 At that time, the socialist press reported occasions of landowners stealing the lands of the peoples of central Mexico and even, from the remote state of Coahuila, came the warning that given ‘the plight of the majority of the Mexican people … it appears that a deliberate effort is being made to thrust it towards socialism and the commune’.7 It was not long after this wake-up call when, at the ﬁrst meeting of the ‘representatives of the Liga de los Pueblos’ – we do not know if this was the ‘Gran Asamblea de Delegados Foráneos o Representantes de los Pueblos’ – a ﬁery orator expressed his sympathy for the Paris Commune8 and municipalism, further noting that: With good governance and good principles, being those proclaimed by socialism, its march forward bein"
