        "text": "One of Rachel Perkins’ most outstanding projects was the SBS documentary series First Australians (2008), which was created over the course of six years. The series “chronicles the birth of contemporary Australia as never told before, from the perspective of its first people,” with an emphasis on what happens “when the oldest living culture in the world is overrun by the world's greatest empire.” The project was a milestone in Perkins’ career because of the large scale of the production as well as the significance of the story being told. When asked about the series, Perkins said, “Hopefully it will spark national interest in the people on whose lands we have made our homes.\" She served as the director, writer and producer. Although her\n\nO Brother Where Art Thou? The movie is set in Mississippi in the late 1930's, with The Great Depression looming in the background. A condensed plot, are that the three main characters Ulysses McGill, Pete Hogwallop and Delmar O'Donnell are convicts that break away from a chain gang. They break away because they're on a quest to find the treasure that Everett hid. As the three men go along in their literal chains, they run into a ton of problems and interesting characters like The KKK, a campaigning governor, a robber, and a blind prophet. From the research I have done, the popular opinion is that this film is loosely based on the book, \"The Odyssey\". The overall tone and mood is somewhat goofy, but it has some heavy topics behind it like The\n\nFruitvale Station depicts the real-life case of Oscar Grant III, a young unarmed black man shot in the back by a white police officer on January 1, 2009 in Oakland. The movie begins with cell phone footage of Oscar Grant’s death recorded by bystanders. Grant’s life was tragically cut short due to a white man’s racism and stereotypical perception of a young black man. The BART police officer Johannes Mehserle abused his authority and shot Grant for no other reason but hatred and racism. At the time of the shooting, Grant was unarmed and pinned on the ground in handcuffs. The movie then walks you through the last twenty-four hours of Grant’s life. As you watch the movie and research the aftermath of Grant’s death you a forced to ask yourself a few questions; why does the media have the right to take away Oscar Grant’s humanity? Where do we draw the line between racism and holding others responsible and will the public’s perception of black men and women ever change? Lastly, we must focus on how this case and others impacts African American society and culture. We also must focus on the necessary changes African Americans must make in order to survive in a world that does not value black lives.\n\nWhen most people think about the power structure of a couple driving in the car they instantly think that the driver is the one with all the power. This of course makes logical sense, as the driver has control over the speed, destination and driving style of the couples transportation. Although this makes logical sense, there are a few exceptions to this train of thought, as when crime becomes a factor the power structure begins to shift toward the benefit of the passenger. Laderman mentions in his book Driving Visions that many road movies focus on a couple driving in a car, but this generally “furnishes narrative tension between the two people traveling together” (17) and this is incredibly true when the passenger is a criminal. We will be examining how crime\n\nFruitvale station, is a story about the real life Oscar Grant, a black man who was shot and killed by a Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer in Oakland. This film follows Grant and his last days before the shooting on New Year’s Day. Written and directed by Ryan Coogler, Fruitvale station was his first feature film. Coogler expressed that he was interested in making this film because he wanted people to get to know Grant, get attached, so that when a situation like this occurs again, people will care more about that human life (Wikipedia). In addition, the cast includes Michael B. Jordan (Grant), Octavia Spencer (Wanda Johnson), and Melonie Diaz (Sophina Mesa), amongst a few others. However, there is an underlying concept in this film. This film relates back to Double Consciousness and the internal conflict and struggles within African American men.\n\nThe Defiant Ones (1958) directed by Stanley Kramer showed the racial relations going on in the United States of America. The film features two men, one black and one white becoming friends, which was almost unheard of at the time. Although when this film came out segregation was illegal it still was not fully accepted as being the new norm. This film starts to try to shape America into accepting all races and stopping segregation, but also tries to mirror society when a third party is brought in and tries to come between the two men and their friendship. Kramer uses The Defiant Ones as a way to mirror the public of the times opinion and shape there new opinion of the changing world.\n\nThe characterization in One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest movie was and novel was the correlation of Ken Kesey describing one of the Protagonists Chief Bromden as being this huge Indian in the movie and novel. “If my being half-Indian had ever helped me in any way in this dirty life, it helped me being cagey, helped me all of these years.” In the novel in Cuckoo’s Nest, the black boys described Chief Bromden as being “big enough to eat apples off of my head, and making me like a baby.” (Kesey 1) However, the movie doesn’t have the particular version and statement that the book shows and talks about. This shows and supports that Chief Bromden is this huge Indian identified in the book and shown in the movie. To help the characters institution\n\nThe film The Pursuit of Happyness has a wide range of social problems that included and has an affect on society. The main character Chris a pharmaceutical representative who is having trouble selling his product. Without selling his product he is unable to support his family and is out of a job. After becoming homeless, he finds an internship that could possibly turn into a job. He eventually is hired by the firm and is able to support his son who kept him going because he had someone who believed and counted on him to do what he needed to get done.\n\nIf a book is retold in film format then it seems to follow logically that it now deviates from the original book, yet the same story is still being told and with To Kill a Mockingbird we see that through scene additions (or subtractions), details, and technique the film manages to preserve core points of the story for the audience. Translating the elements of the book that are solely for literature can prove tricky for screenwriters and though some manage to pull it off artistic liberty is a danger to still be wary of. At times it is used too freely and the story turns into another one entirely, but sometimes it isn’t used enough and no matter how close the movie follows the book it lacks the adaptation from book to screen that is interpretation. However there are those movies that make the cut in doing a fine job of retelling a story without altering what really matters and the film for To Kill a Mockingbird does just that. So while it may take some liberties in its efforts to set the mood within a time limit it does not stray from the greater themes and characters at hand that make the story what it is. With new elements to consider comes the manipulation of scenes, the smudging of details, and the play of technique that all work towards the film maker’s vision for presenting To Kill a Mockingbird’s innermost themes in a way the differences between the formats can work for and not against the story.\n\nThis was my second time watching The Breakfast Club and to be completely honest the first time I watched this movie I wasn't all that impressed. I was glad I got the chance to watch this movie again and this time with the prospective of psychology background. My favorite characters were the jock, Andrew Clark, and the basket case, Allison Reynolds. To me these two characters showed very different examples of adolescent struggles. This was a very interesting movie because it was a coming of age story for five different characters that took place all in one day."
