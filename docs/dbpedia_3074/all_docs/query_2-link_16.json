        "text": "Just to avoid confusion:\n\nThe NYU Orphan Film Symposiun is April 11-14, 2012.\n\nThe UCB Orphan Works Symposium is April 12-13.\n\nYes, there are two orphans symposia happening simultaneously. Let a hundred flowers bloom. \"Orphan Works & Mass Digitization: Obstacles and Opportunities\" is hosted by the University of California Berkeley School of Law and the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology.\n\nNYU's moving image copyright instructor, Rina Pantalony, recommends the white paper on orphan works published this week: David Robert Hansen, \"Orphan Works: Definitional Issues,\" (December 19, 2011). Berkeley Digital Library Copyright Project White Paper No. 1. Available at http://ssrn.com/abstract=1974614.\n\n\"Orphan Works & Mass Digitization\" features 6 sessions and a keynote by the recently appointed Register of Copyrights, Maria Pallante.\n\nSessions are built around these questions and their \"and why?\" follow-ups:\n\nWho wants to make use of orphan works?\n\nWho is concerned about broader access to orphans?\n\nWhat is the best approach to addressing the orphan works problem?\n\nWhat role should registries play in averting orphan work problems?\n\nWho wants to do mass digitization?\n\nShould data mining of in-copyright digital works be permissible?\n\nThe symposium's home page is www.law.berkeley.edu/orphanworks\n\nBelow is the event's precis, quoted in full.\n\nIn 2006, the US Copyright Office recommended legislation to allow unlicensed reuses of in-copyright works whose rights holders cannot be located through a reasonably diligent search to solve the \"orphan works\" problem. Contributing causes to this problem are a lessening of copyright formalities (such as notice of copyright claims on copies of works and voluntary registration of copyright claims) and several extensions of copyright terms. The European Commission has recently proposed a directive that would also open up greater access to orphan works in Europe.\n\nAlthough orphan works legislation made some headway in Congress in the late 2000s, its progress was stalled for several reasons, including Google's announcement in the fall of 2008 of a settlement of a copyright infringement lawsuit brought by the Authors Guild and five trade publishers over Google's scanning of in-copyright books from the collections of major research libraries for purposes of indexing their contents and serving snippets in response to user search queries.\n\nThe Google Book settlement proposed an innovative way to provide greater access to orphan books. Under the settlement, Google would have been entitled to commercialize all out of print books in the Google Book corpus, including orphans, as long as it provided 63 per cent of the revenues to a new collecting society whose job would be to track down rights holders so these rights holders could collect money for Google's uses of their books.\n\nIn March 2011, Judge Chin rejected the proposed settlement on the ground that it was inconsistent with copyright rules that require that rights holders give permission before commercial uses are made of their works. In Judge Chin's view, solving the orphan work problem should be done by Congress, not through a class action settlement.\n\nThe Register of Copyrights has written to key members of Congress to indicate that the Office would be willing to consider how to address the orphan works problem now that the Google settlement has been rejected.\n\nGiven the failure of the Google Book settlement and the newly proposed orphan works directive in the EU, the time is ripe for renewed consideration about how best to solve the orphan works problem. Among the kinds of questions that may be addressed in the symposium are: Is legislation necessary to achieve a solution to the orphan works problem, or can fair use achieve some of the goal? Should orphan works legislation be aimed at creating an exception for reuses of orphan works, or should reusers of orphan works only be subject to more limited remedies if a rights holder later shows up? What other solutions should be considered? To what extent is ambiguity about who as between authors and publishers own ebook rights contributing to the orphan work problem? What factors should be considered in determining what constitutes \"a diligent search\"? Should every potential user of an orphan work have to do such a search, or can users rely on searches conducted by others?\n\nREGISTRATION is now open for both symposia.\n\nHowever, www.nyu.edu/orphanfilm/orphans8/attend.php is the place to begin your comparison shopping.\n\nAdd to the list of screenings and speakers at the 8th Orphan Film Symposium this: a newly preserved film shot by young Samuel Fuller during his service with the Big Red One. Thanks to Christa Fuller and the Academy Film Archive, Fuller scholar Marsha Orgeron will introduce the first screening of a silent amateur film the emergent auteur shot shortly after the end of WWII. Unlike the harrowing and powerful film Sam Fuller shot of the liberation of Falkenau concentration camp in April 1945 (screened at Orphans 2008), this one is playful and parodic, bearing the title How to Light a Cigar. A most apropos title for the famously cigar-chomping cineaste.\n\nCan't wait.\n\nHere's a followup to the posting of May 2008 about Experimental Study of Apparent Behavior: The Moving Film (1943), aka the Heider-Simmel film.\n\nAt the time, I was unable to find out much about psychologist Fritz Heider's student, co-investigator, co-author, and, presumably, co-filmmaker, Marianne L. Simmel. But her obituary reveals she would have been 20 years old when the film was made (about the same age as the experiment's movie-viewing subjects). Turns out she was still alive when I first wrote about the film, but only the appearance of her online obituary alerted me to the fact that she died in 2010.\n\n\"In Memoriam - Marianne Simmel,\" Cape Cod Modern House Trust blog, April 9, 2010, http://ccmht.blogspot.com/ 2010/04/in-memoriam-marianne- simmel.html.\n\nHere we read that Simmel \"survived the Holocaust in Europe, grew up on Manhattan's Lower East Side, went to Smith College, got a PhD at Harvard, and taught psychology for many years at Brandies University.\" Many readers will perhaps be amused to learn that, \"getting fed up with the academic life,\" she moved on to a successful career in textile design. Simmel \"produced a large body of designs, in some cases informed by her previous work in human perception and the brain.\"\n\nSimmel's later work as a designer indicates she was probably responsible for the animation produced for the Heider study of apparent behavior.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nBelow: Simmel design in her online obit.\n\nAbove: cel from the 1943 film. (From American Journal of Psychology)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nThe Simmel textile rediscovery rhymes well with the fact that it is animator Jodie Mack who has done, with her Dartmouth students, a 2011 color film remake of Experimental Study of Apparent Behavior. Here are some frames she scanned from the 16mm.\n\nProfessor Mack too is fond of textiles and geometric forms. Here's a sampler of frames from four Mack films.\n\nAnd if there were any doubt about Jodie Mack's fondness for geometry, here she is in costume.\n\nWhile the Orphan Film Project looks to the University of South Carolina's Moving Image Research Collections to preserve the Heider-Simmel film, it turns out that the Cape Cod Modern House Trust has the same interest in Marianne Simmel's orphaned art.\n\nThe blog post concludes:\n\nAfter searching unsuccessfully for an institution interested in preserving her work CCMHT has arranged to archive her art work and textile designs which will be stored at the Provincetown Art Association and Museum in its secure art storage facility. We hope to exhibit her work in the future and preserve if for scholars and admirers.\n\nLooking forward to seeing the Heider-Simmel film and its progeny, when admirers at the Orphan Film Symposium honor Fritz Heider's son Karl in April 2012.\n\nFrom: Columbia University Cultural Memory Colloquium <cumemory@gmail.com>\n\nDate: Tue, Sep 20, 2011 at 12:55 PM\n\nDear friends,\n\nJoin us in our continuing conversations about cultural and collective memory in our contemporary world. Our first event is to take place on Monday September 26th when we will welcome Professor Jenny Davidson from English and Comparative Literature who will be presenting on the work of filmmaker Helen Hill. Please find a further description below. We will meet at 6PM in 754 Schermerhorn Extension.\n\nHelen Hill, experimental animator and handmade film advocate, was shot and killed in her home in New Orleans in January 2007. Her last film, completed posthumously by her husband Paul Gailiunas, is 'The Florestine Collection.' One Mardi Gras Day in New Orleans some years earlier, Hill found more than a hundred handmade dresses in trash bags on the curb; she set out to restore them and recover the story of the woman who had made them, a recently deceased African-American seamstress named Florestine Kinchen. Both the dresses and the footage were seriously damaged by Katrina; the completed film includes Helen's original silhouette, cut-out, and puppet animation, as well as flood-damaged and restored home movies. Three of Hill's films will be screened - 'Madame Winger Makes a Film' (9:29), 'Mouseholes' (7:40) and 'The Florestine Collection' (31:00) - followed by a discussion by Professor Jenny Davidson that will touch on questions about memorialization and the materiality of film, the persistence and contingency of archives and the imperatives of preservation in the wake of catastrophe."
