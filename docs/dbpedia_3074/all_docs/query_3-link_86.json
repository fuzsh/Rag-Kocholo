        "text": "I was watching “Miss America’s Reality Check” on TLC the other night when it hit me, “I know Dana Daunis, Miss Connecticut 2007.” Then I chuckled to myself and thought, “I know the last five Miss Connecticuts. As a matter of fact, two years ago I was there in Las Vegas at the Pageant rooting for Diana Baitinger, Miss Connecticut 2005. How lucky can a guy get?”\n\nMiss America was larger than life when I was growing up. I remember watching it on television with Bert Parks as the host. These were the most beautiful women in the world. They were like movie stars. They were glamorous, charming and talented. I remember wondering where these women came from. They certainly didn’t live in my neighborhood.\n\nMy involvement with the pageant contestants began in 2002 when I was drafted by Luis Pabon, the executive director of the Miss Connecticut Scholarship Program, to help with transportation. He needed a chauffeur to drive the contestants back and forth between the dorms at Connecticut College and the Garde Arts Theater. At first, I was flattered that he thought of me. Then I realized it was the church van he really wanted. It didn’t matter to me though because I was living a dream.\n\nI remember driving up to the dorm that first morning. I don’t know what I was expecting but it wasn’t what I found. As I got out of the van, I came face to face with 17 very excited young women. They reminded me of my own daughters. They came out in curlers and sweat pants carrying garment bags, and suitcases. These were real girls, not movie stars or beauty queens.\n\nAs the week wore on, I watched as they practiced their routines and group dance numbers. I saw tears and heard laughter. Friendships were being forged and confidence was building. For many of them, it was truly a week to remember. I was blessed to be along for the ride. I was just the driver, but the girls treated me as though I was someone special. What a role reversal that was.\n\nLife is filled with those moments where everything we believe is turned upside down. I was wrong about those women. I did know girls who could have been the next Miss America. I just didn’t recognize them. The same is true with God. Some people picture God as being Holy and unapproachable. He is depicted as an angry God who has a problem with sinners and makes it his goal to destroy them all. Those of us in the church haven’t helped. Sometimes we perpetuate that image and scare people away.\n\nGod’s sacrifice\n\nThe truth is that when we read the scriptures, we find a God who loved you and me so much that he willingly sacrificed his only begotten son for us. God didn’t see us as we are, He saw us for what we could become, much like the women in the pageant. We may look at ourselves as ordinary men and women, but God sees us as people of promise. He doesn’t see us with curlers in our hair or flab around our midsection. He doesn’t see us as a driver or a waitress. God sees us as a beautiful possibility. All God asks is that we embrace Him and strive to be our best and then go out and find ways to live and share His love.\n\nAt 8 tonight, the 2008 pageant will be aired on TLC (Channel 33 with Comcast in Norwich.) You will get to see who is crowned the next Miss America. If you think that is going to be good, then you will want to be in your church Sunday. Bert Parks won’t be there, but God will be there to anoint you with his spirit and send you out into the world as his beloved.\n\nGod bless. See you in Church. Cal.\n\nThe Rev.
