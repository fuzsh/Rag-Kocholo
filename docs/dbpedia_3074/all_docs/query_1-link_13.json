Koda- chrame, was filmed by H. Oesterle of New York City. The excellent opening titles however are not supported by the quality of picture they justify, the sub- ject matter being mostly static scenes of shrubs and trees in spring bloom, shots of birds and animals, and a miscellaney of park scenes which include shots of a sailor and his sweetheart making love on a park bench. While the photography of this picture is generally good in exposure, focus and camera angles, it lacks animation. The subjects pictured are better suited to still photography. Yet this filmer had the means to inject life and continuity into this short subject. Had he begun his picture with the scene of the sailor and his girl, a shot which in itself imme- diately suggests the spring \" in which a young man's fancy lightly turns to love,\" he could have established this as a premise for his picture. Then by using the sailor and the girl as the subjects, he could have pictured them roaming about the park, admiring the flowers, etc., thus justifying such scenes by film- ing them with interesting live action. Best feature of this picture is the titling, excellently composed, lettered and photographed which weighed heav- ily in the awarding to this picture a Home Movies' 2-Star Merit Leader. Reel beauties, 2 so feet i6mm. Kodachrome, was produced by Pvt. Eu- gene Fernette, U.S.A., stationed in Flor- ida. It is the third effort this filmer has submitted to the editors for review and shows definite improvement in all departments of picture making. This war-time continuity pictures a soldier loafing on the job, reading a copy of Esquire. The commanding offi- cer chances by, catches the boy loafing, and threatens to deny him a pass for that evening. Somewhat dejected, the soldier returns to his chores, but when the CO. is out of sight he throws down his broom and takes up reading Esquire again. Presently he falls asleep and dreams about the beautiful girls he has seen pictured in the magazine. Here skillful double and triple expo- sure photography enhances these se- quences. The transition from reality to dream is indicated by a slow moving mist which envelopes the opening scene, a trick accomplished, according to the filmer, by using a chunk of dry ice in a pail of water before the camera lens. The soldier later awakens from his dream, reflects a moment upon the pleasant experiences he had with beau- tiful girls in his dream, then returns to his sweeping, and just in time, too. For the CO. arrives on the scene a moment later to find him sweeping briskly. This scene touches the C.O.'s heart and he withdraws his denial of a pass, prom- ises to give the boy one later in the day. The boy smiles and replies: \"No, thanks, I've just seen my dream girls!\" The C. O. shakes his head wonder- ingly and walks away. Much credit is due the filmer's efforts in trick photography, the success of which offsets his errors in exposure in other sequences. Editing is good and the titles, while excellently composed and displaying fine art work, were photo- graphed not up close to fill the screen, but reposing on a bush or against a tree! As a wartime film displaying the efforts of a G.I. to keep up with his hobby, \"Reel Beauties\" easily rates the 3 -Star Merit Leader awarded it by the editors. Never a dull moment, 350 feet 8mm. black and white, was filmed by H. Sodergren, of Los Angeles. It is a photoplay concerning a man seeking rest in his own home only to be disturbed by countless interruptions. • Continued on Ptge )} PAGE 8 HOME MOVIES FOR JANUARY r THE his is the first and only projector of its kind ... an 8 mm projector that can use a 750-watt lamp ... a projector that shows large brilliant movies and real bright stills without danger of burning the film.

Why not get the kiddies together next Sunday for a photoplaylet with a plot — a pic- ture you can screen again and again with pride and pleasure? If it's a story you lack, perhaps you can gain an idea or adopt the whole story of one or more of the continuities that follow. They're relatively simple and easy to shoot, call for little acting ability on part of the players. It's your skill with the camera and the editing treatment given the shots later that will contribute most to the picture's success. The idea, of course, is to picture the youngsters in purposeful action, at play, or enacting the role of some famous character, etc. Boys like to play at cowboys and Indians and here's a con- tinuity outline for a picture on this subject: Cowboy and the Indian Scene i: Group of children on way home from school, swinging books, etc. Camera on sidewalk; children walking towards camera.

More recently, the impressions of dreams have been translated in visual terms by means of the camera lens. But it remtained for Walt Disney to interpret by the combined means of sound and animation, an equal impression of a musical score. Now, an amateur, with the simplest of equipment and a rudimentary knowledge of motion picture animation, has produced a noteworthy 16mm. sound film in which his impressions of a musical composition are delineated in abstract designs skilfully animated to emphasize each crescendo and diminuendo, every andante and allegro. \"Toccata and Fugue\" is the title of the 200-foot 16mm. black and white sound film produced by Glenn Grossman, of St. Louis, Missouri, now a corporal in the army. Actually, only the Tocatta of Bach's famed composition has been recorded and filmed by Grossman, the Fugue sequence having to wait until the war's end for completion. The picture is introduced on the screen with the main title in anima- tion— the letters appearing one by one to form the words. The musical score begins and abstract figures appear to interpret each movement. A heavy bass crescendo, for example, is symbolized by the rise of a majestic cliff in midst of a landscape. As the music swells, the rock is rent asunder and falls to earth in fragments as the music diminishes preparatory to entering a new phase, which in turn is similarly inter- preted on the screen. Such visual patterns animated in tempo with the music are a delight to the eye and give surprising emphasis to each movement of the score. The very novelty of it may at first obscure the artistry with which this unusual amateur motion picture was produced. But to those who understand the ramifications of animating motion pictures, \"Tocatta and Fugue\" is an outstanding cinematic accomplishment. On this same page begins Glenn Grossman's own story of how he made \"Tocatta and Fugue\" which Home Movies has honored as the Movie of the Month. —EDITOR • At right are frame en- largements illustrating two animated sequences of ab- stract pictures with which Glenn Grossman in- terpreted certain move- ments in Bach's famed mu- sical composition, \"To- catta and Fugue.\" • As the bass notes rise in volume, the cliff emerge: — • In another movement, the stacatto notes are in- terpreted by the tempo of animation in this abstract pattern; — M ADVENTURE IN How A Musical Composition Was Interpreted On The Screen With Animation And Sound... jOCCATA AND FUGUE\" was made at the University of Southern California in 1941 in the Cinematography Department. Through the cooperation of that department and the use of its equipment, this undertaking was made possible. But to start out with, I feel I must explain why the picture was made and for what purpose. It was mainly an experiment in the various techniques needed and applied to make an animated picture with sound. As to photography, I had done enough to make that one of my lesser worries, but as to the sound recording and animation, therein lay the challenge to my limited resources. In making a picture of this type I had chosen to record the sound first and then synchronize the drawings with the sound track. First of all the selection of the music to be recorded was simple enough. I chose Bach's \"Toccata and Fugue\" because we had that record already in the library. As it happened in the end, I only had a chance to finish on the film the \"Toccata\" entirely, although I had recorded the entire Bach work. The recording was made in the University's studio on a Berndt- Maurer variable-area film recorder. The record was placed on a recording turntable. The crystal type pick up was fed into a sep- arate amplifying channel and through a noise reduction circuit in the mixer panel. From this panel it fed into the main amplifier, then directly into the light valve of the recorder. The recording negative was 16mm. DuPont Sound Recording film, which was IIOME MOVIES FOR JANUARY PAGE 13 — the dots and dashes and the narrow lines move — as though in eruption from volcano cones— — and thus continue until mood of the Tocatta upward— changes. with which the sound track can be run at any rate of speed and marked at any point with a grease pencil. Going frame by frame and marking an appropriate chart, I finished marking the film itself and then checked back and found on exactly which frame the component parts of the music came. After numerous rechecks I I made up final animation sheets showing exactly on what frames the light or heavy chords, accents and beats, crescendos and trills, came. I am no artist. I can trace a drawing, color a picture, ink a straight line, but I am no artist. From that definite conclusion, I planned the animation to be strictly a thing of the abstract. De- signs moving, shapes changing, shadows deepening — this was the type of art work I had laid out for myself. The technique consisted of making the actual animation drawings on paper, using celluloids for foremats that were placed on top of the paper. Registration was in the form of a U-shaped guide placed on the bottom and two sides of the title drawing board. The size I selected for both avail- ability and dimensions was the standard typewriter size paper. Next came a rough idea draft of what was going to take place for representing the music on the screen. As it was to be abstract designs and forms, I included everything I could possibly think of because, as I said before, it was mainly an experiment. After I had agreed with myself as to the rough ideas for the animation, I made appropriate notes on the music chart in order to have a guide in animating the drawings. Next required was a little mechanical work of making two boards, one with a piece of glass in the middle for drawing, and another with a solid board for use in photographing the finished product. The drawing board was illuminated from beneath so that when animating, I could put one sheet on top of the other and observe the lines of the design on the sheet beneath. After all the associated equipment was gathered together such as pens, pencils, rulers, French curves, etc., I was ready to begin animation. The time, temper and physical and mental exhaustion that went with the ensuing couple of months work, goes better without • Continued on Page 30 1 6 it 11 urn mm By GLENN GROSSMAN used consistently by this department. The same laboratory did all the processing and for these two reasons no checks as to exposure results were necessary. In the actual recording with the fader knob at zero the film recorder and turntable were brought up to speed. Then the pick-up was placed on the record and after attaining speed the fader knob was brought up to the required and pre- determined point so as to eliminate any of the beginning record scratch. The modulation level was checked by both a galvanometer needle and a monitor speaker. At the end of the recording the light valve was faded out to give a complete drop to silence after the normal echo time of the last musical note. The recording done, the next step was processing the film to obtain the negative and a positive work print. All printing was done on 16mm. Eastman Positive (5301-46) which also did not necessitate additional checks. When the work print came back, I checked it for quality and found that I had been lucky in getting a fairly high grade recording. By using a sync machine (two sprockets on the same shaft parallel to each other), I matched up the positive to the negative and then stored the negative for the final printing. Now came the part that I found to be the most exacting of the whole venture. I was going to \"count\" the sound track frame by frame to find out just what frame a certain beat or chord of the music would come. This was done with a 16mm. Moviola, a device PAGE 14 HOME MOVIES FOR JANUARY • These three titles were made on loca- tion. Letters placed on glass were filmed against natural back- grounds containing action. B Y TITLES ON CUSS Titles And Live or Scenic Backgrounds Can Be Filmed Simultaneously With This Home-Made Cine Accessory .... D R RUSSELL T . C O N G D 0 N M m RVSCET TITLES with beautiful live, scenic backgrounds add much to outdoor movies. They are easily filmed by mounting the title letters on clear glass set into a frame before the camera. In this way, background and title are pho- tographed simultaneously. Double ex- posures and winding back of film are unnecessary. Reproduced above are the frame en- largements of a few of the titles made in this manner by the writer, using the titling frame pictured below. The frame was made from 7/%\" by zYz\" wood with inside dimensions of z^/z'tl ■^zYz\". The inside of the frame was rabbeted out to form a track to receive the glass panel 32\" wide and this track is further deepened by the addition of thin strips nailed all around on either side of the rabbeted trough. Sections cut from yardsticks can be used for the strips and are a convenient guide in arranging the lettering on the glass panel. The framed glass, bearing the title text, is suspended between two upright standards, as shown in lower photo, by means of two angle screws or hooks inserted at either side of glass frame. These hook into screw-eyes set into the standards, permitting the frame to swing free between them and allow- ing the title to be tilted, when neces- sary to shoot up or down for a required background. The supporting standard is con- structed of 7/%\" by 2\" strips of wood and is made so that it may easily be taken down or folded into a compact bundle for convenient transportation. The two uprights are held parallel and the proper distance apart by cross and diagonal braces below the level of the glass. Quarter-inch bolts with wing nuts hold the parts firmly in position. Two legs or props, one attached to each upright, hold the standard in a nearly upright position; it must be set up on a considerable slant, of course, to secure stability. The framed glass is held in the upright position by a hook and eye from bottom of frame to the adjacent cross piece on the standard. While the glass panel on which the title is lettered is easily removable from the frame, leaving it in the frame makes it easier to align and center the lines of lettering by virtue of the pieces of rule or yardsticks at the sides, already referred to. Using a large ruler as a straight edge, the block letters are arranged on the glass which is laid fiat on a table. After the letter arrange- ment is completed, then each letter is secured in place by application of a dab of rubber cement on its base which causes it to adhere to the glass. This cement dries quickly and the glass • Pictured at right is simple home-made easel and title frame that holds before camera the glass on which is lettered the title next.

The American Civilization class at the Menlo Junior College in Menlo Park, California, after studying the general problem of conservation in the United States, organized a trip to a local lumbering mill. The group felt such a visit should be very enlightening even though it was specifically related tc lumbering and forest conservation rather than to conservation in general. Arrangements for the all day trip were completed through a United States for- ester, wrTo had previously offered his services to the group. Prior to the class's departure from school, several purposes were set as guides for the trip. These objectives were later used as a basis for estimating the value of the project. The three purposes decided on were: 1. Learn how general logging and lumbering operations are carried on in this area; 2. Learn how logging practices in this area are related to the gen- eral problem of conservation of our forests; 3. Learn how lumbering in this area affects human resources and other related natural resources. With these objectives in mind each • Logging activities were followed by the camera from felling of trees to transport of logs and cutting at the mill. student selected a specific field for spe- cial study. The fields investigated were: lumbering methods, effect of lumbering methods on soil, effect of lumbering methods on wildlife, effect of lumbering methods on the people in this area, and history of lumbering in this area. The instructor and one interested stu- dent chose to make a photographic rec- ord of the class's findings. With one roll of 8mm. black and white panchromatic film ($2.25), an 8mm. Bell and Howell camera with an £3.5 lens, and an ex- posure meter this record was made. None of the shots was planned in advance. Our only guide in making the picture was the decision that the scenes should tell a story of lumbering in this area as the class found it. Sequence and individ- ual shots were taken at random as the inspection progressed. Attempts were made to include students in the action wherever possible. The instructor and student depended upon the final editing of the film to tell a complete story. At the class meeting following the trip, special reports were presented. Sev- eral days of discussion were devoted to individual findings in order to get a complete picture of the lumbering prob- lem for this section. At the conclusion of the reports the film arrived from the processing station and the group was ready to preview it intelligently. The film was shown and discussed. • Students studied mill operations before the scenes were shot to determine the most effec- tive camera angles. At the close of the class a committee of two was appointed to further review the film and to incorporate suggestions in the arrangement of the scenes in order to tell a story. The movie committee re- viewed the picture, listed all the scenes as they were recorded and from this list went to work editing the film. When the film was finally cut and spliced into its final form, it opened with finished lumber being piled on a truck, followed by various scenes of logging and milling operations, and closing with views of the ruined timber and timberland that remained \"and which left a real problem for future cit- izens to solve. The committee purposely ended the reel with the devastating scenes in order to present a problem rather than to suggest any possible so- lutions. To make the picture more realistic the speech department's recording ma- chine was used to make a recorded nar- rative that could be reproduced while the film is screened. A suitable musical background was used and a prepared script was read by a student. The script was read while the picture was shown in order to synchronize it as near as pos- sible with the picture. Synchronization was later controlled by regulating speed of the projector to that of the 33 1/3 R.P.M. recording. • Continued on Page }) School- made ^Documentary, EARL W. DIBLE HOME MOVIES FOR JANUARY • By following the author's formula, correct exposure for such scenes as this may be calcu- lated by multiplying light \"units\" by film speed, and dividing by distance of lamps from subject. termlning, £xpo£ure With out c4 M,eter 9 9 9 Here's A Dependable System For Calculating The Right F-Stop For General Indoor Scenes G E HERE is a very simple idea for de- termining the correct lens opening to use when filming movies indoors. No exposure meter is needed, and guess work plays a very minor part in the calculations. The process, briefly, is to multiply the index number of the light units by the Weston tungsten film speed rat- ing and divide the result by the dis- tance the lamps are located from the subject. The answer will be the stop opening to use for correct exposure. In order to determine exposures by this method, it is first necessary to understand the term: \"index number of light units\" referred to above. For the purpose of this system, one light \"unit\" consists of four No. i photo- floods in good reflectors or the equiva- lent. Two No. 2 photofloods in re- flectors or one No. 4 photoflood in re- flector, either of which are the equiv- alent of four No. 1 photofloods, also equal one unit. A unit can consist of photofloods of mixed sizes as, for instance, two No. W H M 1, one No. 2, and two No. 4 photo- floods which would make a total of three light units. In all cases, the photofloods must be in regular photo- lamp reflectors made for the purpose. Used otherwise, efficiency of the photo- flood lamps is decreased and cannot be estimated for the purpose of making unit calculations here. To arrive at the lens opening re- quired, the lamps are arranged about the set as desired and the distance measured between lamps and subject. If the lamps are not all the same dis- tance from subject, the average dis- tance should be used for calculations. Lamps used in back of the subjects for backlighting or highlighting are not to be counted either as light units or when the distances are measured. They are to be disregarded entirely when making the calculations as the exposure is determined solely upon the olume of light cast upon subject or set from the camera side. The following example will indicate simplicity of the system. In a given • A light \"unit,\" as used in author's system of exposure calculation, consists of four No. I photofloods or their equivalent mounted in regular reflectors like the one shown here. room there are four No. 2 photoflood lamps in good reflectors being used in front of the subject, and two No. i's used in back of subject for high- lighting. The four No. 2 lamps are each worth a half unit, or a total of two units in all. The highlight photo- floods are not considered. The film be- ing exposed in this example is Koda- chrome Type A which has a Weston rating of 12. By multiplying the total light units, 2, by the film speed, 12, the result obtained is 24. As the four No. 2 flood lights have been placed 6 feet from the subject, when 24 is di- vided by the light distance, 6, the result is the f. number, which, in this example, is f.4. Or, to take another example, sup- pose four No. 1 photofloods are be- ing used at ten feet from the subject, with Agfa Triple S Superpan in the camera, for which the Weston tung- sten rating is 64. The lamp unit is one, and when multiplied by the film speed, gives an answer of 64. This is divided by the lamp distance from subject, which is 10, and the • Continued on Page 3 1 16 HOME MOVIES FOR JANUARY • Action highlights from all the impor- tant world events of 1944 are compactly yet interestingly edited into the 1744 edi- tion of Castle Films' \"News Parade of The Year\" just released. Castle Records The Year Film Diary Of 1944's News Highlights Available For Home Projectors . . . I SO NUMEROUS and dynamic have been the events of 1944 that impor- tance of many have become ob- scured by those which quickly fol- lowed. However well the newsreels cov- ered these events, not everyone was for- tunate to see the pictures in theatres. Now, however, it is possible to review the year's historic highlights in one's home as they flash upon the parlor movie screen, for Castle Films has added an- other historic volume to its annual movie news digest in the \"News Parade of The Year for 1944\" prepared espe- cially for owners of 8mm. and 16mm. projectors. Prints of this film in both sizes and in a variety of editions are now available through Castle Films dealers. Rare action footage from all fight- ing fronts poured into the Castle edit- ing rooms during the past eleven months and the editors, whose job it was to select the highlights and compress them into one reel, really had a job on their hands. Readers will understand the gigantic task involved in selecting, cut- ting and assembling this material with- out going beyond the alloted length.

From the fighting in northern Italy and the Balkans to the crumbling Seigfried Line on German soil, the smashing onslaught is seen as Americans, British, Canadians, and fighting French purge conquered lands of the Nazis and liberate millions of people. The sweep of the victorious Russian armies into the crumbling Fortress Europe on the east is pictured in sensational photography. And historic films from the Pacific, in- cluding scenes depicting the latest tri- umphs of General McArthur and the great naval armadas on the ever-short- ening road to Tokyo, add to the story of American victories in this momen- tous year. Highlights of the reel include amaz- ing shots of Britain's battle against Hit- ler's last and most deadly weapon, the robot bomb. Sensational accuracy in big gun marksmanship explodes several fly- ing bombs in mid-air as the camera re- cords these hard-to-get shots filmed dangerously close to the explosions.

A Page of Title Cards that Offers Continuity Ideas [T MAY be putting the cart before the horse to take a title then build a story around the idea suggested by it; but many of Hollywood's best pictures begin with an idea for a box-office title! A catchy title phrase will send a producer scurrying to his typewriter — or secretary — to dash off a quick story outline that later becomes a feature. Similarly, the hundreds of main titles that have been printed in previous issues of HOME MOVIES each suggest a picture continuity. Now, to make these titles even more useful, HOME MOVIES offers a screen story idea for each one reproduced here — plus color for those who would photo- graph them in Kodachrome or Ansco-Color. The entire seven titles may also be reproduced satisfactorily with black and white emulsions. The suggested continuities are neces- sarily brief, but may be enlarged upon by the filmer to form a complete scene-by-scene shooting script. PEOPLE are actors, and all the world's a stage upon which they perform. Every town and city has its odd characters and pic- turesque inhabitants which offer interesting picture material especially for a movie documenting local life. Curbstone peddlers, pushcart merchants, the cop on the corner, town square gossipers, and soap-box orators — all of these are picturesque if not enter- taining actors of almost every city and hamlet. If you want to make an amusing film, scout the prospects of filming such people in your town, then secure permission — when you think such may be necessary — and film each one in their natural daily pursuits. OLBJBAYS TIMES have changed a lot in the past few years affecting the lives of everyone. Perhaps you have many scenes of your family and self made three or four years ago when vacations were a reg- ular yearly event and visits to mountains and seashore an almost weekly occurrence. Why not make a movie picturing the con- trasts in your life between yesterday and today? If then you drove your car to work daily, you probably ride street car or bus today. Yesterday you ordered the gas station attendant to \"fill 'er up!\" Today you nurse your A coupons with infinite care. You can take it from here to make an interesting filming idea, contrasting new scenes w ith old. A NOVEL idea for a birthday greeting to a brother filmer is to make a movie of friends or relatives greeting him personally from the screen. This surprise film can begin with the title shown here, then picturing each member of the family separately, showing them in closeup writing a personal greeting message to the party whose birthday is being celebrated. Then show what is written in an ultra-closeup filmed with the aid of a titler or supplementary lens. Close the picture with a group shot of all the greeters — the girls throwing kisses and the men clasping their hands overhead, ringside fashion. And if the man is in the service, he'll appreciate this birthday greeting all the more. HOME MOVIES FOR JANUARY EVER wake up with a start to discover you overslept, then rushed through dressing and breakfast in order to make the bus a la Dagwood Bumstead? Begin your film story exactly that way. Have the man rush to the bathroom only to find someone else there ahead of him; later, shaving in a hurry and getting cuts that require court plaster; eating breakfast in a hurry standing up; grabbing hat and coat and dashing out the front door, etc. He stumbles down the front steps, falls face down upon the morning paper laying on the front lawn. He looks at it startled; reads it again; and a closeup shows the dateline — SUN- DAY! Final scene shows him jumping up and down on his hat, then returning to bed with all clothes on. WINTER offers much in scenic beauty and action for the cine camera which is too often overlooked by the cameraist in favor of the warmth of indoors. But wherever snow flies, there's certain to be sledding, skating and skiing, the kind of action just made for movie cameras. Let us document winter with well photographed sequences of each of these sports, introduced per- haps with a theme sequence of snowscapes, icicles and frosted windows. Picture the whole pageant of winter showing skaters on the pond or lake — arriving; putting on skates; cutting fancy figures; etc. Picture the skiing, sledding and tobogganing sequences in an equally complete manner. Introduce each sequence with appropriate sub-titles. MAKINC Dad or big brother the goat is theme of this movie idea which pictures him trying to show up other members of family in outdoor sports only to suffer dire consequences. Brother asks dad to play football on the lawn with him. Of course dad wants to show off — gets hit with the ball, and limps into the house. Here he's challenged to a garne of badminton by sister, is badly beaten and suffers a turned ankle to boot! When he tries golf he's struck by a ball. Catching pitched baseballs is too much for his tender hands. And a game of croquet leaves him with a sprained back from which he seeks relief in an easy chair in the shade of a tree in the garden. Closing scene shows dad sipping a highball and a title states that \"a highball is the only ball that doesn't ball up dad!\" WHEN the man of the house seeks peace and quiet on his day off, anything can happen to annoy him — and usually does. If he tries to sleep during the day, the neighbor's kids are sure to roller skate in the driveway. If he seeks solitude in a hammock, there's always a chattering bird — or a gabby neighbor — to break the silence he seeks. And if he naps, a thoughtless neighbor invariably gets careless with the garden hose while sprinkling, dousing him and creating a furore. If you want to make a typical \"day in dad's life\" movie, weave these incidents into a continuity and star dad in the stellar role. A surprise twist is to close the picture with a title: \"But when we want to awaken him — \" followed by a shot of mother pounding on bedroom door, then a closeup of dad fast asleep and snoring — with gestures. PACE 20 HOME MOVIES FOR JANUARY home movies' experimenta Ideas for Cine gadgets, trkks a Extra Lens Holder My filming activities are mostly out of doors, on mountain hikes, etc. Mine is a single lens camera, although I carry wide angle and telephoto lenses plus an assortment of filters. I soon found it in- convenient to carry this extra equip- ment around in a separate carrying case. I therefore made the gadget pictured above which is patterned after the money belts so popular today and which holds my extra lens equipment more conveniently. The case is made of heavy cloth with a series of five pockets. A large flap folds down to cover the pockets and is secured by snaps. Loops sewed on at the back provide for wearing the gadget at my waist secured by my trouser's belt. With my extra lenses at waist height 2nd right in front of me, it is easy when I wish to change a lens to simply re- move the one on the camera and drop it in one of the pockets and replace it v.'ith another and shoot. It saves fumb- ling through trousers pockets or the an- noyance of carrying an extra equipment case. — Edmund C. Loury, Seattle, Wash. Film Viewer A simple film viewer may be con- structed as follows: cut a hole 2\" by 3\" in base of editing board so that path of film travel bisects the hole. Apply a panel of flashed opal glass or ground glass over the hole, securing it in place with tacks or gummed tape. Mount a small hand magnifying glass, obtainable at dime stores, above the glass — about two or three inches — in such a manner that film will pass between glass and magnifyer. Add a small 7-watt 1 10- volt lamp and socket beneath the glass panel to furnish illumination. This arrange- ment will permit inspection of film ade- quately magnified for ordinary editing purposes. — Raymond Dunn, Fresno, Calif. Editing Aid Ordinary spring clothespins, num- bered with india ink to correspond with scene numbers, and strung upon a wire cr cord over desk or worktable, provide an easy way to edit films. Each scene, as cut from the roll of newly processed film, is hung in order on the wire and identified by a numbered clothespin. Thus, the strips are readily identified and may be kept in splicing order, ready for editing. — Bill Jaymes, North Holly- wood, Calif Extended Reel Arms The photos below show how I ex- tended the reel arms of my 8mm. Filmo projector to accommodate 800-foot reels without permanently altering the pro- jector frame or mechanism. The auxil- iary arm is attached to the original reel arms by quick demountable clamps as shown at \"A.\" The arm is made of a length of Ys\" tubular steel, bent to shape as shown. The clamps \"A\" were welded in place on the arm and each consists of two metal bars fitted with two bolts and wing nuts. The reel spindles were made of 5/16\" CD. copper tubing sweated to headless bolts, and these provide for the insertion of spring reel retainers made of safety pins.' The pulleys \"B\" were turned on a lathe from a piece of maple hardwood. The lower one is a two-stage pulley providing faster rotation for the smaller hubs on standard 400 foot reels. Belt pulleys slip over the regular pro- jector spindles, offsetting the spring belts so that the sprockets and reels line up. In order to prevent the projector from toppling forward from the added weight of the larger reels, a counter- weight consisting of three pounds of lead poured into a chromium plated pipe is fastened with bolts to the rear of pro- jector as shown at \"C.\" A finishing touch is the coat of chrome paint ap- plied to the extension arm assembly. — Ralph O. Lund, Seattle, Wash. VREZl SNOP Reel Film Bands In order to keep my reels straight and not have to unwind film and examine the first frame of the title each time I start a show, I have made cardboard film bands for each reel. For a full 16mm. 400 ft. reel the cardboard should measure 9 16 inches by 23 inches. One inch from one end place a snap fastener, obtainable from dressmaking shops or ten cent stores, and tie to it a piece of ordinary string long enough to go around the reel.

Lamp Substitute I recently burned out the bulb in my P-8 Univex projector and later found that my dealer was unable to supply a new one. This bulb, as owners of this model projector know, is a small 8-volt high intensity lamp lighted by a step- down transformer located in base of projector. I discovered that a No. 83 Ford spot- light bulb or a G-E No. 1009 bulb, both of which have the locking ring attached, can be substituted with a simple alteration. With a hot soldering iron, the locking ring on base of bulb is loosened and may be moved straight R/NG-Sc COLLAR RELOCATED &■ SOLDERED ON ORIGINAL POSITION OF RING- up toward top of base and re-soldered in this position. This alteration permits filament of the bulb to set in the proper plane and focusing position behind the aperture when inserted into the lamp socket of the projector. This bulb draws a little more current than the original P-8 Univex projection lamp, consequently lowering the trans- former voltage to around 7 volts which gives a good bright light on the 6-8 volt bulb. — Hawthorn Sntton, Jackson, Mich. Projector Blimp Here is a plan for a portable projector booth or blimp that enables screening K^TABS FRONT VIEW 9 INSIDE VIEW OF FRONT TOP SLOTS ■ COLOR WHEEL movies with a more silent \"little theatre\" atmosphere. The annoying light that escapes from most projectors comes to good use in lighting the booth for the operator instead of distracting guests' attention from the screen. With the booth in use, projection image is unim- paired, noise is reduced considerably and the unit is easy to make and as- semble. Made from heavy cardboard or double faced corrugated packing board, it con- sists of three sides and a top, as shown in diagram. The rear is left open, al- though this, too, may be closed by addi- tion of another panel. Dimensions in above diagram are tentative. The whole unit may be de- signed to fit any make of 8mm. or 1 6mm. projector. The front and side panels are joined together with Kraft tape, allowing some slack for folding. The lens porthole can be cut to the size and height suitable for the projector. Those who like to project their black and white films in tints or color, can add a color wheel to the front panel, as shown. The wheel shown provides for four color wedges plus a blank opening for projection without color. Color is provided by cementing pieces of colored cellophane over holes in the color wheel. The wheel is attached to front panel by means of a. round-head brass paper clip. Top panel is attached and held in place by means of tabs cut in top edge of front and side panels, which are in- serted in corresponding slots made around edge of top panel, as shown in diagram.— Grayce A. Wulff, Cleveland, Ohio. Camera Handle A simple camera handle, that fits the tripod socket, and lends a firmer sup- port of camera when hand held, can easily be made from a J/4\" #20 machine bolt, and a piece of broom stick. The bolt, with head removed, is screwed se- curely into one end of the stick leaving about J/4\" protruding to fit into cam- era.

This \"Soundie,\" as well as others in the series is an ex- cellent surprise highlight to insert between features or longer films to bal- ance screen programs. Subjects are available for outright sale at S7.50 each. The Curse Of A Cigarette, 1 reel in cither 8mm. or 16mm., is a timely film subject tying-in with the current cig- arette shortage. It is a \"revival\" of an old-time silent melodrama and portrays the \"dreadful degrading influence of the cigarette\" as the straightlaced believed in at the turn of the century. Treated in a humorous manner, the story is equal to the best comedy films for hilarious entertainment. Running time is 1 2 minutes. Subject is available for out- right sale from the Fun Film Library, 545 Fifth Ave., New York City. Pictorial Films, Inc., announces a program of feature releases for 1945 consisting of 36 films among which are such outstanding titles as \"Harvest Melody,\" \"Minstrel Man,\" \"When The Lights Go On Again,\" and \"Jive Junc- tion.\" In addition to these, there are also in preparation, 16mm. prints of 8 action-westerns with Buster Crabbe and S musical-westerns featuring Jimmy Newell and Tex O'Brien. The release dates for each of these subjects will be announced periodically during forth- coming months. Chants Populaires is a delightful series of one-reel musical animated car- toons featuring French-Canadian folk songs. Vocalization in French is by the .Mouette Quartete and the melodies range from 16th century favorites to popular present-day folk songs.

In a Cartoon Studiois a Jungle Jinks cartoon released by Official Films, Inc., and available through dealers. This sub- ject is a laugh-provoking adventure of cats, dogs, elephants, tigers, etc., turned loose in a Hollywood animated cartoon studio. The film is instructive, too, in that it shows many of the operations connected with the making of animated cartoons. The animals produce their own cartoon — an old fashioned mello- drama — which is given a hilarious out- door premiere in Hollywood style. Available in both 8mm. and 16mm. and in a special 16mm. sound version. The Duke Of West Point 12 reels 1 6mm. sound, is an entertainment film starring Joan Fontaine supported by Louis Hayward, Richard Carlson, Tom Brown and Alan Curtis.

It's this pure silver — combined with certain other substances in one of the most delicate, most carefully controlled series of processes known to science— that gets your pictures on Verichrome and other Kodak Films. With the right treatment, nothing else responds to LIGHT as silver does. Silver is only the starting and finishing point. In its life cycle between silver ingot and de- veloped photographic negative, its nature is re- peatedly changed.

To bring this latent image to life, the silver must be freed from its chemical partners— must return to its original state— pure metallic silver. This is done by chemicals used in \"develop- ment.\" When you see the developed film— there's the negative of vour snapshot!

Certain unethical practices followed by questionable parties palming themselves off to unsuspecting producers as \"expert\" 1 6mm. cinematographers, forced a handful of conscientious cameramen back in 1939 to organize for the protection of both themselves and the producers. Today, every 16mm. cameraman with the right to affix the initials SSC after his name in credit titles, is a proven expert in his line. There are records to prove his qualifications and known films in circulation attesting to his ability. To qualify as a member of the Society of Sixteen-millimeter Cinematographers, the applicant must submit for review to the Society's governing board prints of at least two 16mm. pictures which he personally photographed and in which at least 50% of the scenes are interiors. The qualitv of his work, both outdoor and indoor, is analyzed and, if passable, the applicant's personal habits and integrity are then investigated and the completed record brought before the governing board for vote. Unques- tionably the tests are rigid, as they should be. Many cameramen, with long and varied photographic experience, often fall down on seemingly unimportant details which loom large in impor- tance according to professional standards.

At present wage scales for SSC men engaged on 1 6mm. productions budgeted at $5000.00 per reel or less is $30.00 per day; over $5000.00, the rate is $60.00 per day, the opinion being that responsibility is greater with higher budgeted productions. The organization goes on the premise that without a good cameraman, you can't get a good picture regardless of story quality and the investment given other phases of production. And they can point to the record that shows the number of sor- rowful producers who learned this fact the hard way.

So, Olsen will film the New England skiing and winter sports sequences for a film now in preparation for the New Haven and Hartford Railway just as soon as he winds up camerawork on Carl Dudley's production for Santa Fe. Olsen will be remembered for his sen- sational 1 6mm. color film chronicling a death-defying trip by rowboat through the rapids of the Colorado river, a film- ing exploit that was described in the March, 1943, issue of Home Movies. Olsen's rise in the professional ranks has been short of meteoric. Attracted by his Colorado rapids film and his skiing pic- tures, a Hollywood producer of short subjects made him his chief cameraman. Assignments took him through Mexico and Central America to film short subjects in 16mm. Kodachrome which are to be blown up and released in 35mm.

She stands with arms folded, watching retreating boys. A chuckle comes over her face as the scene ends in a fadeout. THE END The above continuity shows how to develop a story idea into a shooting script. By breaking the action down into scenes and sequences, it may be more readily visualized in terms of camera treatment. That's what trips up so many amateurs attempting a story film — the inability to visualize the story scene by scene. Once the idea is de- veloped into a story, then into a scene by scene shooting script, the rest be- comes easy. Here are a few story ideas for kiddie films that the reader can develop him- self: Is there a teen-age youth in the fam- ily? Here's a short continuity idea that will enable him to demonstrate he's a potential Van Johnson and you to prove you're as good a producer as Preston Sturges. Give it a title that appeals to you. The youth is seated in living room talking over the telephone. A title states: \"Sure, June, I'll pick you up in an hour!\" Boy hangs up phone and goes to bedroom, where he takes clothes HOLLYWOOD FILM ENTERPRISES, Inc. 6060 SUNSET BLVD. Los Angeles 28 California HOME MOVIES FOR JANUARY PAGE 29 out of closet and dresser and spreads them out on the bed. In the bathroom he looks critically at his face and feels it with an inquiring hand. His hand stops as it discovers one lone long hair — shown in closeup, of course. He goes tc door, looks out cautiously. Returns to bathroom and takes out his father's shaving equipment. He takes off his shirt, examines face again in the mirror, and applies lather. Next closeup shows him making final swipes with razor. He washes his face. Rubbing his hand over face again, he is astounded to dis- cover the same long whisker there. He snatches up safety razor, examines it closely. Removes handle and finds no blade in place. Pan slowly to youth's face revealing look of dismay and fade- out to end. Here is an idea for a homey type of movie especially adapted for children. It might be titled \"A Dollar Day Dream.\" Open picture with shot of mother picking up magazines and news- papers from davenport and living room floor, etc. In taking them out of the house, she cannot get out because of obstacles piled against screen door. She calls to son who is playing with neigh- bor children, offers him a dollar to clean up yard. Succeeding scenes show the boy busily engaged with his labors. After he has finished the job and claimed his re- ward, a closeup shows him wild-eyed with the anticipation of spending the dollar. A dissolve here (or a fadeout and fadein) introduces a sequence of shots showing what he might do with the money: He buys pop, candy, ice- cream, popcorn, more ice-cream, more candy, etc. — finally returning home with an ill expression on his countenance and his hands holding his aching tummy! Mother administers castor oil and puts him to bed. Here the scene slowly fades back to the original closeup. The boy starts to walk slowly down the street. Presently he sees a War Bond Poster on side of a store building. He stops to read it — gets a fresh idea. He walks more briskly down the street now, turns into the bank instead of the candy store. When he comes out he is holding a handful of war saving stamps and a stamp book. He sits on curb and proceeds to paste stamps in book and story ends in a fadeout. Be sure to insert ample titles, in ad- dition to the necessary main and end titles, to assist in explaining action of each story. Where possible, of course, let pantomime and animation of the play- ers tell as much of the story without titles as you can. Filming the children in short con- tinuities, such as these, will net films of far more lasting interest than reels of random shots filmed with no pur- pose other than to \"make movies.\" Ask Your Dealer to Show You the New Ifflfl (fU9.

After the animated drawings were completed, there still was left the painting-in of the outlines. Remember, all this was for the sound speed of 24 fr. per sec. which means anywhere from 18 to 24 drawings for one second of music. Finally all were completed and after a slight time lapse for bodily recuperation, the photography was the next task begun. All my previous shooting had been done with a model A-3 16mm. Keystone camera equipped with an f/1.5 lens and, except for some of the live action, the entire picture was photographed with the same camera. The camera was mounted vertically, with the lens point- ing down at the title board. By taking out the back pressure plate in my cam- era, there is enough room to insert a small flashlight bulb. This was placed directly behind the aperture and wired to batteries. In this way an image of the film gate aperture was projected on the ntle board and the camera centered ex- actly on the area. Placing the pressure plate back in the camera, I was then r eady to expose test strips. In this case, these were very necessary to check not only exposure and centering, but the animation itself. Not having the time to make my tests and wait for the laboratory to do the processing, I shot test strips about two feet in length, then developed them myself. After checking with the labo- ratory I found that by using accurate time and temperature development with D-72, I could get approximately the same exposure and gamma calculations that the laboratory would produce. Final tests were developed by tray in absolute darkness, as I was using Eastman Pan- chromatic Negative. After my checks had been made I was ready to begin my photography in real earnest. This I put off for a while until I had caught up on my sleep, at least enough to last me for a good long filming ses- sion. It required from six o'clock one night until noon the next day to com- plete filming of all the drawings. With animation sheets in order and the chart right next to the camera, I started click- ing the frame by frame photography of each animation drawing. On the Key- stone camera there is no single frame re- lease, so by setting the speed at 8 frames per second and giving the exposure but- ton a quick snap, I was able to success- fully expose only one frame at a time. Keeping tab of the number of frames exposed was a real headache and several times when I lost count, I would have to start all over again on that scene. The animation board or \"stage\" was illuminated by two No. 1 Photofloods set high enough to give even illumina- tion to the whole drawing. Two home- made reflectors were adjustable and proved efficient for certain lighting ef- fects throughout the filming period. The drawings were slipped into the U- shaped registrants from the top, the proper celluloid placed over them and the required number of frames exposed. The celluloid and drawings were re- moved and the next placed on the board and the operation repeated. As I mentioned earlier, the \"Toccata\" was the extent of the work done. The total number of frames exposed for the \"Toccata\" alone was approximately 5,500 with actual drawings numbering in the neighborhood of 2,000. Total footage, including the introductory live action, amounted to about 250 feet, al- though it was eventually cut down to 200 feet. The photographed negative was developed and a work print made. Then, in conjunction with the sound work print, the picture and sound were cut and matched up so as to be in syn- chronization. Meanwhile I had decided to introduce the picture with live action so this was shot and appropriate sound recorded and added to the beginning of the animation work. When the sound and picture work prints were synchronized, the negatives were matched to their corresponding print and then to each other. The two negatives were sent to the laboratory for a composite print, having both the pic- ture and sound on one film. After the extensive work put into this picture, you can appreciate the thrill I experienced in finally seeing the com- plete picture on the screen. Although a few errors in timing were evident, it did serve to show what could be done in the way of interpreting music visually by means of sound track and animation. Afterward, I was all set to begin work on the second part of \"Toccata and Fugue,\" but the Pearl Harbor incident stopped that. But when the war is ended I hope to be able to continue with this interesting experiment. MOVING?

Written mathematically, the method of calculation is expressed as follows: L x W = f. D Where L = Lamp index units W = Weston Tungsten film rat- ing D = Distance from photofloods to subject f. = f. number for setting lens. There are other uses for the system such as light limitations, depth of field requirements, etc. Let us suppose Ko- dachrome is again being used but this time with an f.^.j telephoto lens. What is the greatest possible distance lights can be set from the subject for proper exposure? The lights are two No. 4 and two No. 2 photofloods, forming a lamp unit of 3. To find the maximum distance lights can be placed from subject mul- tiply the lamp unit by the Weston tungsten film speed and divide by the f. number to be used. In this case the lamp unit, 3, multiplied by the film speed, 12, gives 36. Dividing 36 by f -4- 5 > the answer is 8, the distance in feet the lamps must be placed from the subject. The same system may be employed when a certain depth of field is nec- essary in photographing a set and the unknown factor to be determined is: how near must lights be set to obtain necessary lens opening to secure desired depth of focus? If, in the example above, the stop f/8 is required to obtain the necessary detail and depth of field, the figure 36 (lamp unit x film speed) would be divided by f/8, giv- ing an answer of 4^2 — the distance in feet the lamps must be placed from subject. Still another use for this system is No. 17 WITH SPOT LENS The front- removable attachment carries two lenses. This feature as well as the large condenser lens incorporated in the main body of the outfit, and the adjust- able diaphragm apertures make it pos- sible for the operator to show a spot of light as small as an inch in diameter or to give a light area up to ten or twelve feet.

Y. to determine how much light will be required to cover a given subject. Sup- pose our lens is f/2.5, the film type A Kodachrome, and the closest lights can be placed to the subject is 24 feet. The question is, how many lights will be needed? This may easily be determined by multiplying the f. number (2.5) by the distance from lights to subject (24) which gives an answer of 60, and dividing the film speed (12). The answer, 5, is the number of light units necessary for correct exposure. This would be 5 number 4, 10 number 2 or 20 number 1 photofloods, or any equi- valent of mixed lamps sufficient to make up five units. All examples are based on a camera shutter speed of 1/30 of a second. For cameras having faster or slower shut- ter speeds, compensation must be made accordingly. If the first filmed tests of this sys- tem are slightly under- or over-ex- posed, the difference may be due to inefficient reflectors, camera shutter speeds not exactly 1/30 of a second, camera running fast or slow, etc. How- ever, after the first tests, and tests are recommended, the degree of error should be determined and allowances made on all subsequent filming. If, for instance, the film is slightly over-exposed, one-half or perhaps one full stop less exposure should be given in the future. But once the amount of error, if any, is found, the correction allowance should be followed there- after. This system of exposure calculation applies to average scenes and set-ups, such as normal shots inside the average home. Where walls are very dark or very bright, the usual increase or decrease for such conditions should be made. The system is intended to give a basic lens stop from which minor changes can be made as required. This simple little formula is so quick and easy to use that every filmer should jot it down and carry it in his camera case, or commit it to memory. With exposure meters not now obtain- able, this system will be found a safe and reliable method for determining correct indoor exposure for either black and white or color films. Shooting T)itleA On Qla*£ . • Continued from Page 14 container made for the purpose from scrap packing material. On arrival at the location chosen for the back- ground, the supporting frame is first set up. Next, the camera is mounted before it on the tripod. The framed title is then set in place and the camera finally adjusted to focus upon the desired background and the title. This ii determined by viewing the title and background through the viewfinder, making necessary allowance for paral- lax, which is not so great at a distance of 5 !/2 feet — the distance for which my title frame was designed. This, as will be understood, enhances the possibility of obtaining sharp focus of both title and background when shoot- ing titles under normal light condi- tions at f/8 or f/11. Using the one-inch (25mm.) lens on my 1 6mm. Cine Kodak, I obtain a title area of approximately 2 5\"x32\" at a distance of five-and-one-half feet. This distance has been established as the very maximum in order not to bring the frame of the glass into field of view. Actually, because of the possibility of error in allowing for parallax, it is ad- visable to bring the camera somewhat closer and thus allow for more area be- tween actual title margins and the glass frame. For those readers who may wish to follow this plan in making similar titles, the following data on width of field for standard lenses — one-inch (25mm.) for 1 6mm. cameras or one-half inch (12mm.) for 8mm. cameras — will be of value: Camera To Width Of Subject Field 4 Feet 20 Inches 5 Feet 24 Inches 6 Feet 30 Inches Making titles by this method requires some knowledge of depth of field for the particular lens to be used. It is nec- essary to get the maximum depth of field in order that both the title letters, which are set up a distance of yJ4 feet from camera, and the background as seen through the glass, will be in sharp focus. This calls for good light and a small lens stop. I always aim for a stop cf f 8 or f 1 1. By setting my lens focus at 1 5 feet, I obtain a depth of field from 5 feet from camera to infinity. Thus, it would be possible to use as a back- ground, with equal success, a range of distant mountains, or a flowered shrub immediately behind the glass panel. It is not to be construed, from the description above, that the procedure in making these titles is limited to com- posing a title at home, then taking it to location for filming. On the contrary, the system is fully flexible, allowing for composing of titles on location as often as desired. Using block letters and rub- ber cement for adhesive, the letters may be quickly applied to the glass and HOME MOVIES FOR JANUARY PAGE 33 just as readily removed after the title is photographed. By employing lap-dissolve technique, the letters may be made to fade-in and out over the background. Using stop motion photography, the letters can be made to appear one by one, as in anima- tion, and disappear the same way. Such embellishments will enhance even more the very professional effect of the title wording appearing over live moving backgrounds. School-made documentary . . . • Continued from Page 1 5 With the editing completed and with a four minute aluminum recording pro- viding the musical score and narration, this classroom-produced documentary film was ready for a premier showing. Not only was the film a classroom success, but it has been used at a number of teacher institutes to show how a min- imum of planning and a minimum of expense can produce a very fine educa- tional experience through use of a home movie camera and projector. This pic- ture has been further used in other classes as motivation for studying local conservation problems. $eview& o cAmateur 3ilm£ . . • Continued from Page 6 The picture begins with the main title superimposed over an exterior view of the man's home. The words dissolve and we see people coming and going from the house. The camera trucks in, pro- ceeds through the door, and centers upon the living room. Here we are in- troduced to the man and his family. A group is making merry about the piano. The man retires to his bedroom. He gets into bed, but cannot sleep. We see him rolling and tossing, and a flashback to the parlor shows the rea- son. Here the merrymakers have raised their voices in song. The man pounds on the wall to no avail. Other interrup- tions and noise occur subsequently to give the man a bad night. And when he finally arises the next morning, he ap- pears wan and dejected . There comes a package to the door. Opening it, the man finds a reel of movie film. The phone rings, and while he's answering it a little girl comes into the room, sees the film and proceeds to unwind it. By the time the phone con- versation is finished and the man returns to the film, he finds the child hopelessly entangled in it. This is too much for the distraught man. He packs his bags and is about to drive away in his car to \"P vent U ally — maybe sooner than you think— you'll be able to enjoy the thrill of owning DeVRY 8mm. or 16mm. cameras and projectors. . . .
