        "text": "For sports team championship parades, see Victory parade.\n\nThe Sports Parade (a.k.a. “The Sport Parade”) was a short film series of Warner Bros. that was regularly shown before the main studio feature, along with another Warner-Vitaphone short, Joe McDoakes comedy and/or Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons. The average running time of each film was between nine and eleven minutes.\n\nVirtually all of these were filmed in Technicolor. (A few early ones used Cinecolor as it gradually replaced the Vitaphone Color Parade on Warner’s short subject program.) This gave them an advantage over rival series like Paramount Sportlights with Grantland Rice, Columbia World of Sports, RKO Pathé Sportscopes, Universal Variety Views, and MGM Pete Smith “Football Thrills”, which used color sparingly for special entries. Warner’s most prolific competitor in Technicolor live-action shorts, 20th Century-Fox, produced only 20 out of 100+ Movietone Sports Reviews from the late thirties through early fifties in color. In the era before television, it was considered more economical to shoot in black and white like the newsreels.\n\nAlthough Warner Bros. separated this series from its less sports-oriented series Technicolor Adventure (film series) during the later 1940s, many post-war Sports Parades resembled high quality color travelogues of the period, showcasing a variety of recreational pursuits in the Caribbean, South America, Europe, Egypt, India and Australia. André de la Varre supervised many of the best international productions, while Edwin E. Olsen and ski expert Dick Durrance were particularly skilled at using hand-held cameras for up-front action shots. Howard Hill specialized in archery and Van Campen Heilner handled many fishing and camping reels for both Warner and studio rival RKO. Despite lacking high profile sports news commentators, key radio veterans like Art Gilmore and Marvin Miller put a lot of energy and enthusiasm into their narration.\n\nThe series won three Academy Awards and was nominated three other times. Despite being phased out in 1956, they were successfully reissued throughout the sixties since many of the topics had a timeless appeal and were always popular at the box office.\n\nBelow is a listing of titles by year of release, listed by title / major credits / release date / notes of interest. Only a few have made DVD release.\n\nTitle Major credits Release date Notes Football Highlights (Football Thrills) De Leon Anthony; narrator: Wendell Niles August 31 (preview) Overview of newsreel clips includes scenes with Knute Rockne (some footage in black & white) Fly Fishing Dick Miller & Del Frazier; music: Rex Dunn; narrator: Wendell Niles September 21 Diary of a Racing Pigeon producer: Gordon Hollingshead; director: Del Frazier; music: Howard Jackson; narrator: Knox Manning November 30 birds showcased California Thoroughbreds director: Del Frazier; music: Howard Jackson; narrator: Wendell Niles December 22\n\nTitle Major credits Release date Notes Fight, Fish, Fight Bob Edge (director); music: Rex Dunn; narrator: Wendell Niles March 1 Hunting marlin in New Zealand Sky Sailing music: William Lava; narrator: Knox Manning April 19 Covers sport of gliding Big Bill Tilden producer: Gordon Hollingshead; director: Del Frazier; music: William Lava; narrator: John Deering May 24 Tennis reel with Bill Tilden Sail Ho co-produced by Cinesound Productions; director: Del Frazier; music: Rex Dunn; narrator: Knox Manning June 14 Following a sailor in Australia It Happens on Rollers director: Del Frazier; music: William Lava; narrator: Knox Manning July 12 Features Gloria Nordskog Lions for Sale producer: Gordon Hollingshead; director: Del Frazier; music: Rex Dunn; narrator: Knox Manning August 9 Sometimes billed as a “Color Parade”, filmed in a two-color process.
