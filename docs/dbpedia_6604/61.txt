Nightfall is fantasy based setting , through which there is a huge world ready to be perceived, subjective to our imagination. Currently there are around 70 quests, 13 races and 14 guilds. Nightfall was discovered in December 1990

and has been growing ever since. Some of the things you will be doing

in Nightfall include consulting your hitch-hikers guide to the galaxy,

exploring the Enterprise NC-1701 which is situated above Nightfall

City and even killing the mighty Balrog imprisoned in Caroba Zoo.

You can discover a whole new world with different realms ranging from

old traditional english mythology ranging from the Camelot of King

Arthur to the ancient colosseums of Rome. From the lofty chambers of

the dwarvish mountain halls down to the deepest bowels of Hell, and

over eleven other enticing kingdoms. Currently, there are

approximately 16 open domains and many projects in the making, all

with different themes and scenarios.

Ultimately, Nightfall offers much more diversity than any other MUD,

so why not check out

yourself.
