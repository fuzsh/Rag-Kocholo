        "text": "Games Industry Consultant Chaz Elliott has enjoyed a long and varied career in the wargames, RPG and hobby games industry. A graduate of the Lincoln College of Art and Design, he began his career as a Senior Graphic Designer at Games Workshop, where he worked from 1985 – 1987. Chaz then moved on to become a sculptor/ partner at Nenthorn Studios (whose prestigious clientele included Madame Tussauds, the Jorvik Viking Museum and Rock Circus). Roles in other companies followed, including Fantasy Forge Miniatures, Wizards of the West Coast, Score Entertainment, RC2 – South – Press Pass and Upper Deck Entertainment BV, in addition to a range of freelance positions. Further to this, Chaz, Tim Prow and Drew Williams launched Diehard Miniatures in 2014, a company whose aim is to “give you high quality sculpts for both sci-fi and fantasy ranges with more than a nod to the past.”\n\nThe Original Bad ‘Un! A Talk With Chaz Elliott… Part 2 (continuing from Part 1).\n\nChaz expanded on his experiences with D & D…\n\nChaz Elliott: D & D was the first game to bring me into minis, that and Valley of the Four Winds. Chainmail was an interesting way of restaging the Battle of the Five Armies from The Hobbit, which was a childhood dream. I think I’d also just been given the Tolkien Bestiary and was lost in John Blanche’s battle artwork. It was the opportunity to expand the singular play value of a character within a RPG to a general laying down of grander plans. A fundamental influence at that time was the Chronicles of Thomas Covenant by Stephen R Donaldson, some of the battle descriptions of Ur-viles’ masters spewing ichor at the head of a wedge against the Lore Lords produced visions of mass combat.\n\nThere was a point where D & D lost its attraction and miniatures and the world of miniatures overtook the majority of my interests. We’d moved again to Lincoln as my father took a post at the RAF Swinderby boot camp – and I lost my regular play group – and art college opened a whole new world of fun and entertainment – and just a short train ride away was the emerging Asgard office/ workshop in Notts.\n\nStephen R Donaldson is an American writer who specialises in science fiction and fantasy genres. He is noted for his ten-book high-fantasy epic series of The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant novels, his 1977 book Lord Foul’s Bane being the first in this wonderfully immersive collection.\n\nA man with many strings to his bow, Chaz is a highly skilled miniatures designer and sculptor, a graphic designer, and games market analyst and consultant. Originally produced by Fantasy Forge in the early- 1990’s, and now by Scotia Grendel, Kryomek is a science fiction 25mm scale wargame-come-skirmish, and is one of the many game systems Chaz has worked on.\n\nChaz Elliott: Kryomek was a huge amount of fun, the work unit was located in the guardhouse and storage room of an old abandoned brewery – I think we crammed 5 desks into the office affectionally known as the railway carriage, and we had a blast working on the world setting – but mostly I enjoyed laying the rulebook out, and sculpting the first few releases – including the Marines – and the Nasty Kryomek buggers – and drawing up the area effect templates. It was a blast working with the FF crew, and at that time the proto Nightfall Games. It was fun game, John Grant and John Robertson wrote the rules, I even made the first terrain board and demoed the game at shows, a long, long time ago…\n\nI was interested to know if Chaz still found time to play any games. In addition to a very busy life, Chaz explained that working in the games industry can lead to a jading of the fun one can take from what previously offered much enjoyment.\n\nChaz Elliott: I’ve played most every kind of game, and especially now in this board games revival, so I’m familiar with the majority of game mechanics, platforms, interfaces, etc. But when game analysis and playing becomes a job, then some of the glitter fades and it becomes more of a play through to gauge mechanics, or competitor innovation – less fun.\n\nThe only game I still play occasionally for fun is Go – Tony Ackland taught me how to play and we used to play in the Games Workshop Design Studio league with Mike Brunton, Graeme Davis and Paul Cockburn – kept on playing, learning and teaching – superb game.\n\nChaz’s career veered away from a direct association with miniature wargames to card games; Magic the Gathering, Buffy, Dragonball Z CCG, Yuyuhakhusho CCG and Portal 3 Kingdoms all being games Chaz has worked on.\n\nChaz Elliott: It’s different mechanics but the same principle, assisting the willing suspension of disbelief, allowing the players to escape into the respective worlds and forget reality for the briefest of moments. For me, it’s breathing life into the fictional worlds I escape into. I read vicariously as a child and even now, tend to have 6 or 7 books on the go at one time.\n\nHaving pushed putty for many different wargames and model companies, I wondered what type of creatures Chaz especially enjoys sculpting…\n\nChaz Elliott: I love Elves of all kinds, I did a few for Reaper and a few for Diehard, next though is Lizardmen – love them scaly buggers! I think I like to sculpt Lizardmen especially because of a fascination with reptilian textures – hard to achieve and I love a challenge, evil reptoids with the technical challenge thrown in. I really enjoyed the Thai versions I made for Reaper – it was great to work on decoration that was far more organic than in Western culture.\n\nChaz’s tip for sculpting Lizardmen scales…\n\nChaz Elliott: It’s like eating an elephant, one bit (scale) at a time. It’s hard and I still haven’t ever really gotten to a level that I’m content with.\n\n‘Oldhammer’ is a term commonly used to describe the ‘older’ period of fantasy and science fiction wargaming and miniatures, typically the late-1970’s and the decade of the 1980’s, and depending on your ‘purist’ values, into the 1990’s. Often attributed to Games Workshop’s Warhammer games and respective editions and model ranges, if a figure is lead/ metal based, comes from a hand-sculpted master model and is brimming with character, charm and often humour, then it is considered to be Oldhammer. With a never-ending enthusiasm for old school fantasy and science fiction miniatures, Chaz is Oldhammer through and through.\n\nChaz Elliott: Tim Prow (Diehard Miniatures) has done a great job – Oldhammer forever. There are a few other designers who have decided to extend those halcyon days too, they fill in the gaps and update the sculpting and production quality. Pure unadulterated nostalgia and its crew – I love Drew Williams’ latest Troll Wives and Brats. There’s that comedic aspect that I feel is lacking from GW content these days – takes itself very seriously – whereas we loved the old drunken giant rules!\n\nTo be continued… Part 3 HERE.\n\nFollow Chaz Elliott on Facebook HERE.\n\nOfficial Diehard Miniatures website HERE.\n\nOfficial Diehard Miniatures Facebook page HERE.\n\nElsewhere… Rock ‘N’ Roll Resurrection!!!
