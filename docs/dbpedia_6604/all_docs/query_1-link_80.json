        "text": "Monday, April 14, 1986\n\nZion - Fatal Accident\n\nZion National Park Superintendent Harold L. Grafe reports that an April 11 accident occurring in the park has resulted in the death of a 35 year old Colorado City, Arizona man.\n\nAccording to Grafe, J.F.C. sustained multiple injuries when the bicycle he was riding struck the south wall of the Zion-Mt. Carmel tunnel. J.F.C., H.B., H.B., and G.B., all of Colorado City, rode into the east tunnel entrance at approximately 3:15 Friday afternoon. A short distance inside the tunnel, J.F.C., who was riding in the back of the group, crossed the oncoming lane of traffic and collided with the concrete wall.\n\nAt the scene of the accident J.F.C. was attended to by a physician, a registered nurse and park ranger emergency medical technicians. J.F.C. was transported by ambulance to the Dixie Medical Center in St. George, and later airlifted to Valley Medical Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. At approximately 11:45 a.m. on Sunday, April 13, J.F.C. died, the result of injuries sustained in the accident.\n\nMay 18, 1987\n\n87-74 - Zion - Fatality: Fall\n\nLocation: Scouts Lookout, Angel's Landing\n\nT.M.M. lost her footing (there is speculation that she tripped on the long dress she was wearing) as she was hiking with her husband and 2 others. She fell 250 vertical feet. Park personnel responded to the report. They performed CPR for 1 1/2 hours. T.M.M. was pronounced dead of massive internal injuries. A. board of inquiry has been tentatively scheduled for Thursday, May 21 at park headquarters.\n\nJune 29, 1988\n\n88-109 - Zion - Suicide\n\nLocation: North of the Grotto Picnic Area\n\nTwo fishermen found the body of J.R., 51, of Las Vegas, NV, on the bank of the Virgin River with a gunshot wound in his chest. A hand gun at his side and other evidence collected by the county coroner indicate that J.R. died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\nThursday, June 29, 1989\n\n89-159 - Zion - Life Support Rendered to Employee by Visitor\n\nOn June 26th, seasonal fee collector K.S., 51, was working at the park's south entrance station when he suffered a heart attack. The male foreign visitor K.S. was dealing with at the time jumped through the entrance station window, cleared K.S.'s airway, and began mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. He was assisted in his efforts by another visitor, C.K.-M. of West Germany. Seasonal ranger John Ethridge soon arrived on scene and continued CPR. K.S. was taken to Dixie Medical Center Hospital in St. George, Utah, where he remains in intensive care. The name of the male visitor is still unknown, but it is thought that he was travelling with C.K.-M.. The park is attempting to find the two visitors in order to commend them. (Jim Richardson, park ranger, Zion, via CompuServe message from John Chapman, RAD/RMRO).\n\nTuesday, July 18, 1989\n\n89-187 - Zion - Armed Robbery\n\nOn the morning of the 17th at about 9:30 a.m., Dale Evans, the comptroller for the park concessioner, was leaving the lodge parking lot with the weekend's receipts (about $27,000) when a man approached his car, stated that he had a gun in his pocket, and demanded the money. Evans started his car, but the robber reached in and grabbed him in a headlock. As the car lurched backward into a parked car, the robber grabbed the money bag and fled on foot. Rangers were on scene within about seven minutes, and sheriff's deputies arrived shortly thereafter. Zion canyon was blocked off and all cars were checked and listed as they left. The FBI arrived on scene on the afternoon and reopened the canyon. The robber has not been found, but a description has been obtained from the comptroller, who is certain he knows the subject from somewhere. A crime lab from Salt Lake City is en route to the park. (CompuServe message from John Chapman, RCR, RAD/RMRO).\n\nFriday, October 6, 1989\n\n89-307 - Zion (Utah) - Felony Arrest of Concession Employee\n\nOn the night of October 2nd, V.B., 28, an employee at Zion Lodge, was arrested for speeding by park rangers. During a routine check of his driver's license and registration, the rangers learned that Brevard was wanted on a warrant for a $25,000 theft from a grocery store in Illinois. V.B. was arrested, and was arraigned on the 3rd. He is being held for at least 90 days in order to provide Illinois officials with sufficient time to file for extradition proceedings. (UPI news report).\n\nMonday, December 18, 1989\n\n89-361 - Zion (Utah) - Car Clouting Arrest\n\nOn November 20th, rangers arrested. L.P., 43, of Cedar City, Utah, on two counts of felony theft in the Kolob Canyon section of the park. The arrest marks the culmination of an investigation into several car clouts in that area over the past few years. Following the arrest, a search warrant was obtained for L.P.'s home, and two credit cards, a bank card and numerous wallets were found. It is possible that these may be traced to vehicle thefts which occurred up to 15 years ago. L.P.'s mode of operation was to stake out trailheads, then enter vehicles after he saw visitors leaving them for hikes. (Telefax report from Dave Buccello, Acting CR, Zion, via FAD/PMRO, 10:30 EST, 12/15).\n\nTuesday, April 3, 1990\n\n90-50 - Zion (Utah) - Injury to Park Ranger\n\nUPI reports this morning that Paul Kirkland, a ranger at Zion, was injured in a weekend explosion during a Boy Scout training session and that he is in serious but stable condition in the University of Utah Hospital's burn unit. Kirkland and other Utah Boy Scout leaders were attending a weekend workshop at Snow Canyon State Park near St. George. According to UPI, Kirkland had loaded a \"thundermug\" - a noise-making device filled with black powder - and was about to ignite it when the device exploded in his face. Larry Wiese, a park spokesman, reported that Kirkland has undergone two operations on burned areas on his arms and face, and that he apparently will require additional surgery. We will provide further information as soon as possible. (UPI story, 4/2/90).\n\nMonday, April 16, 1990\n\n90-50 - Zion (Utah) - Follow-up on Injury to Ranger\n\nRanger Paul Kirkland, who was injured in an explosion on April 1st, has lost his left eye, but doctors are very optimistic about the chances for his right eye to fully recover from the trauma incurred in the blast. Kirkland is also recovering from second degree burns on his arms and face. He will probably be hospitalized in .Salt Lake City for another week, then spend two more weeks there as an out patient. (Telephone report from Larry Van Slyke, CR, ZION, 2 p.m. EDT, 4/13/90).\n\nMonday, June 11, 1990\n\n90-127 - Zion (Utah) - Landslide\n\nOn June 6th, hikers informed park rangers that a large landslide had occurred in Kolob Creek, which flows into the popular park hiking route in Zion Narrows. The slide area is about a half mile upstream from the park boundary on private land. The debris from the slide has reportedly formed a 20-foot high dam in Kolob Creek, and water is backing up behind it. A helicopter overflight by rangers yielded little additional information due to the altitude the ship had to fly above the canyon, but it appeared that the pool was increasing in size. Rangers were to hike in from above the dam site on the 8th to try and gather definitive information about the impoundment, since any release will affect park lands. The state dam safety specialist in Salt Lake City has been advised and is awaiting information from the park. Due to the potential for dam failure, the Narrows have been closed to both upstream and downstream travel until further notice. (Telefaxed report from Larry Van Slyke, CR, ZION, 6/8).\n\nThursday, June 21, 1990\n\n90-144 - Zion (Utah) - Seasonal Park Ranger Killed\n\nAccording to a UPI story this morning, seasonal Park Ranger John Ethridge, 40, was killed yesterday when he lost his footing on a trail in Hidden Canyon and fell off a cliff. Ethridge finished leading a group on a nature hike at 10:30 a.m.; when he turned to address the group, a rock slipped from under his feet, causing him to fall 150' to 175' to his death. Park personnel reached the body about an hour later, and Ethridge was pronounced dead at that time. Ethridge had worked in all divisions of the park and had served as a law enforcement ranger, backcountry ranger, fire control officer and maintenance worker. He was working as an interpretive ranger at the time of his death. We will provide more details as soon as we learn them. (UPI story, 6/20).\n\nFriday, June 22, 1990\n\n90-144 - Zion (Utah) - Follow-up on Death of Seasonal Park Ranger\n\nThe park has provided some additional information on the death of seasonal park ranger/naturalist John Ethridge, 40, on the morning of the 20th. John was descending Hidden Canyon trail with some visitors who'd been on his nature hike when he lost his balance, apparently as a result of his foot sliding on sandstone rock. He then slid and bounced about 75 feet before dropping another 90 feet into a high-angle gully. A park medic was on scene in about an hour, but found no signs of life. John began his seasonal employment at Zion in May of 1978. He held numerous positions in the Division of Resource Management and Visitor Protection over the subsequent twelve years, and worked in fee collection, backcountry, fire and general resource management. This was his first assignment to the Division of Interpretation. John is survived by his mother and two brothers. We will try to provide you with information on the funeral later today or early Monday. (Telefax from Larry Van Slyke, CR, ZION, 6/21).\n\nWednesday, August 15, 1990\n\n90-255 - Zion (Utah) - Drug Arrests\n\nOn the morning of the 13th, rangers arrested two Boulder, Colorado, men for possession of controlled substances, including marijuana, cocaine, and what is suspected to be LSD and PCP. A quantity of mushrooms were also seized. Along with the drugs, many of which were individually packaged and marked for apparent sale, over $3,000 in cash was seized, a third of which was found hidden in a flashlight from which the batteries had been removed. The arrests came about as the result of an out-of-bounds camping violation. The two men were turned over to the Washington County Sheriff and have been charged with possession and intent to sell. One subject has been charged with a first-degree felony (he had a previous drug arrest) and is being held on $75,000 bail; the second has been charged with multiple second-degree felonies and is being held on $50,000 bail. Since both subjects have a history of failures to appear on previous enforcement actions, they must come up with the full amount to bail out. The FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office are also involved, since prosecution under Title 21 is being considered. (CompuServe message from Larry Van Slyke, CR, ZION, 8/14).\n\nTuesday, January 8, 1991\n\n91-3 - Zion (Utah) - MVA with Two Concession Employee Fatalities\n\nDuring the early morning hours of January 6th, M.W., 24, and N.H., 26, both employees of Zion Lodge, were killed when their pickup truck slammed head-on into a tree on the road directly in front of the lodge and burned. Accident scene investigators have calculated that the vehicle was travelling at over 80 mph when it hit the tree. Alcohol is thought to be a contributing factor. Both victims were residents of Utah. (Larry Van Slyke, CR, ZION, via telefax from J.T. Reynolds, RAD/RMRO, 1/7).\n\nFriday, January 25, 1991\n\n91-25 - Zion (Utah) - Poaching Conviction\n\nOn January 22nd, Robert Wright, a hunter from Hurricane, Utah, pled guilty in magistrate's court to charges of taking wildlife, using a weapon and travelling off established roads in the park during the black powder deer hunt last November. Magistrate Patrick Fenton sentenced Wright to six months in jail and $500 in fines for each of the three offenses, directed him to pay $500 in restitution charges for the animal taken, and ordered that his rifle be forfeited to the park. Fenton also barred Wright from hunting for the next 18 months and prohibited him from any national park until April 16th. Wright's jail time was stayed until that date, when Fenton will rule on how long Wright will be imprisoned. [Larry Van Slyke, CR, ZION, via telefax from Jim Reilly, RAD/RMRO, 1/23]\n\nTuesday, April 30, 1991\n\n91-138 - Zion (Utah) - Successful Rescue\n\nDuring the night of April 23rd, park medics Pat and Dave Buccello responded to a report of an unconscious 14-year-old female in the nearby community of Springdale. They were summoned by EMT's in the town's ambulance service who recognized the need for advanced life support for the victim. The Buccellos found the patient near death due to a suspected overdose of alcohol and/or drugs. They administered Narcan and IV fluids and kept the victim's airway open during initial care efforts and travel to the medical center 45 minutes away. The victim's blood alcohol level was .23 when she reached the hospital; no drugs were found in her system. According to the attending physician, the victim would not have survived more than another ten minutes if she had not received the ALS care provided by the Buccellos. [Telefax from Larry Van Slyke, CR, ZION, 4/26]\n\nMonday, June 3, 1991\n\n91-192 - Zion (Utah) - Drowning\n\nJust after 9:00 p.m. on May 30th, rangers were notified that T.W., an 18-month-old child from Las Vegas, was missing in Watchman campground and hadn't been seen for half an hour. A few minutes later, friends of the family spotted the boy in the water about 200 yards downstream from the point where he'd last been seen. He was pulled from the river, and a doctor who was in the campground immediately began CPR. Despite assistance from rangers and a responding ambulance crew and physician's assistant, efforts to resuscitate him proved fruitless. [Larry Van Slyke, CR, ZION, via telefax from J.T. Reynolds, RAD/RMRO, 5/30]\n\nTuesday, July 9, 1991\n\n91-267 - Zion (Utah) - Conviction of Ranger\n\nOn June 26th, P.K., a former permanent ranger and backcountry coordinator at Zion, pled guilty in U.S. District Court to one count of felony theft of government property. The guilty plea was part of a plea agreement in which two other felony counts were dismissed and came the day before Kirkland was to have appeared before a jury on a three-count felony indictment. The charges followed a month-long investigation which began in February and centered around the theft of monies from the park's campground receipts. P.K. must also make restitution for the monies stolen. P.K.'s criminal activities led to his termination from the Service on June 8th. Sentencing is scheduled for August 26th. [Larry Van Slyke, CR, ZION, via telefax from J.T. Reynolds, RAD/RMRO, 7/5]\n\nWednesday, July 24, 1991\n\n91-311 - Zion (Utah) - MVA with Fatality\n\nJ.G. of St. George, Utah, was driving eastbound on Smith Mesa Road on the evening of July 14th when he failed to negotiate a turn and went off the road. The car plunged and rolled down a 300foot slope. J.G was ejected and killed; a passenger who was wearing a seatbelt suffered injuries but survived the accident. [Dave Buccello, ZION, via telefax from Sheri Williams, RAD/RMRO, 7/19]\n\nTuesday, August 6, 1991\n\n91-367 - Zion (Utah) - ARPA Arrest for Theft of Park Artifacts\n\nSpecial agents and rangers from the NPS, BLM and OIG participated in a sting operation which resulted in the arrest on July 27th of G.W. of Cave Creek, Arizona, for ARPA trafficking. The arrest took place in Las Vegas. G.W. had been told on numerous occasions that the items he was attempting to buy came from Zion. G.W.'s 1986 Nissan Stanza and $6,000 in cash were seized. During booking, G.W. stated his occupation as a \"trader of Indian artifacts.\" He was arraigned on July 29th. Ranger Activities in SWRO has a fulltime special agent assigned to ARPA investigations. For further information, please contact either Jim Radney or Bill Tanner at FTS 4766371 or 505-988-6371. [Telefax from RAD/SWRO, 8/5]\n\nWednesday, August 7, 1991\n\n91-372 - Zion (Utah) - Counterfeit Currency\n\nFaye Windsor of the Zion Natural History Association was counting cash receipts from sales at the park's visitor center on August 6th when she came across a twenty dollar bill which didn't look right. Further investigation revealed that the currency was counterfeit. The Secret Service has been notified. [Larry Van Slyke, CR, ZION, via telefax from Brian Reilly, RAD/RMRO, 8/6]\n\nMonday, April 27, 1992\n\n92-143 - Zion (Utah) - ARPA Arrests\n\nOn April 19th, backcountry ranger Tom Gillette spotted four adults - A.S., E.R., R.M. and M.C. - collecting artifacts from the ground in the vicinity of Kolob Terrace. A mano and numerous projectile points and lithics were discovered in a search of the foursome. Rangers Greg Smith and Pat Buccello joined Gillette in a search of their vehicle and found numerous other artifacts which the suspects admitted having collected from surrounding public lands over the years. A.S. and E.R. have lengthy felony criminal histories, including heroin and marijuana trafficking; M.C. and R.M. have no criminal histories, but stated that they routinely collect artifacts on public lands in the Southwest. Citations were issued and an investigation is continuing in conjunction with BLM. Anyone with information on any of the four is asked to contact Pat Buccello. [CompuServe message from ZION, 4/24]\n\nTuesday, June 2, 1992\n\n92-235 - Zion (Utah) - Flash Flood\n\nAt about 4:30 p.m. on May 29th, a large localized storm cell moved over the North Fork drainage, producing intense hail, wind and rain. Numerous visitor vehicles were damaged, and up to 25 hikers were stranded in the Narrows of the Virgin River. Rangers successfully rescued two hikers, treated six hypothermia victims, and evacuated portions of two campgrounds. Hail was reported up to two feet deep in some locations. Subsequent rock and mud slides resulted in the temporary closure of Canyon Drive and closure of Gateway Trail for approximately one week. It's estimated that the Virgin River rose from seven to ten feet within 30 minutes. [Pat Buccello, Acting CR, via telefax from J.T. Reynolds, RAD/RMRO, 6/1]\n\nTuesday, August 18, 1992\n\n92-436 - Zion (Utah) - Rescue\n\nE.S., 28, of New Haven, Connecticut, fell approximately 25 vertical feet and suffered head, face and leg injuries while in Hidden Canyon on the morning of August 11th. A 20-person rescue team responded. Due to the narrowness of the canyon, two members of the party had to be utilized to relay radio messages. It took the remaining 18 rescuers almost eight hours to move the patient to the trailhead, arriving at that point a half hour after midnight. Maneuvers through high-angle boulder fields and a number of vertical litter lowerings were required during the descent through the canyon. After exiting the canyon, rescuers had to belay the litter for almost a half mile along the trail, which has vertical drops of 200 feet. Shu was taken to a local hospital, treated, and released. [Larry van Slyke, CR, ZION, 8/17]\n\nTuesday, August 18, 1992\n\n92-437 - Zion (Utah) - Rescue\n\nJust after 1:00 p.m. on August 11th, M.N. of El Toro, California, reported that his wife, 47, and his son and two daughters, all in their mid-20s, were in trouble in Zion Narrows and needed assistance. The family had planned a one-night campout in the Narrows over August 9th and 10th; they'd hiked about ten hours the first day, but had not quite reached the park boundary, which is about four miles from the trailhead. They had camped, then continued downstream on Monday, the 10th, but had covered less than four miles. During the hike, M.N. and his wife had become separated from the rest of the family because of flash floods. M.N.'s wife, who weighed 230 pounds and was taking medication for her heart, began having cardiac problems and injured her leg. M.N. hiked out through the rest of the Narrows on Tuesday without seeing his children, and reported the situation to rangers. While arrangements were being made to secure a helicopter, the son hiked out of the Narrows to report that his two sisters had returned to help their mother. In doing so, one of his sisters had fallen and apparently broken her tailbone, so was now unable to hike out on her own. FIREPRO personnel Eric Lutz and Koby Barnhurst were dispatched to the trailhead to hike downstream to the three women, and reached them despite considerable difficulty with flash floods. They spent the night with the M.N.s, providing food and water and assessing their medical situation. At the time of the report, plans were to get the party to the top of Narrows canyon so that they could be airlifted from the area if necessary. [Larry van Slyke, CR, ZION, 8/17]\n\nWednesday, August 19, 1992\n\n92-440 - Zion (Utah) - Rescue\n\nOn the afternoon of August 12th, four young Utah men attempted to descend into the canyon at Pine Creek Narrows utilizing a rope purchased from a hardware store. Because of the sheerness of the rock face and the numerous pour-offs, full-length climbing ropes, some climbing equipment and some expertise on their use are required for this descent. Despite their lack of all three, the group descended to the first pour-off, leaving a portion of their rope behind. At the second pour-off, three of the youths descended to the end of the now-shortened rope, then dropped into a plunge pool. The fourth member decided not to take the plunge and was therefore able to retreat and report that his companions were unable to get out of the pool. Four rangers and a local climber responded, rappelled to the trio, demonstrated ascending techniques, and belayed the youths out of the canyon - their first ascent, conducted on vertical rock and in the dark. The rescue operation was completed at 11:00 p.m. [Larry Van Slyke, CR, ZION, 8/17]\n\nWednesday, September 2, 1992\n\n92-468 - Zion (Arizona) - Arrest of Concession Employee\n\nOn August 31st, rangers arrested 26-year-old C.C. on a misdemeanor warrant out of Los Angeles at the Zion Lodge, where he was employed as a chef. A criminal history check on him resulted in a five-page listing, which included 31 dated entries over a 16-year period. Included in the offenses were arrests and/or convictions for rape (both genders); possession, manufacture and sale of dangerous weapons; assult with a deadly weapon; battery on a person; arson; obstructing and resisting an officer; violation of parole; and drug violations. He had served six years in the state correctional facility at Chino for rape by force and/or fear. He was incarcerated him in the county holding facility in St. George, but the state of California declined to extradite him on the warrant and he was released. Parks with concession operations should keep an eye out for him, as he also worked in Death Valley at one time in some capacity. [Larry Van Slyke, CR, ZION, 8/31]\n\nThursday, September 3, 1992\n\n92-470 - Zion (Utah) - Earthquake\n\nA magnitude 5.9 earthquake with an epicenter near Kolob caused a rock slide which closed Utah Highway 9, the south entrance to the park, early on the morning of Wednesday, September 2nd. The slide dumped several hundred cubic yards of material over a stretch of the highway about a quarter mile from the entrance, which handles two-thirds of Zion's visitors. Park employees got in by walking across the rock slide, then riding to work in park vehicles. Power is out in Zion Canyon, and only one telephone line is working. No structural damage has been found in the tunnel on the east entrance road, but damage of an unknown extent was inflicted on buildings in the vicinity of the Kolob visitor center. Efforts were being made yesterday to reopen the road and restore electricity. [Denny Davies, CI, ZION, 9/2]\n\nTuesday, September 8, 1992\n\n92-470 - Zion (Utah) - Follow-up on Earthquake\n\nFollowing the massive earthquake-caused earth slide which closed Utah Route 9, the south access road to the park, and severed commercial power to the area, the park superintendent closed the Zion Canyon portion of the park. Zion Lodge managers subsequently closed that facility because of the power outage. Campers were allowed to remain, but told that they could not reenter if they left. By nightfall, campgrounds were nearly empty. Power was restored at 2 a.m. on September 3rd, and the east entrance was reopened to traffic and visitors. Two lanes of Route 9 were reopened later that day, and all park facilities and services were accordingly restored to normal operations before the Labor Day weekend. Although damage was extensive in Springdale, just a mile south of park headquarters, Zion escaped major damage. On September 4th, several dozen park employees participated in a joint effort with Springdale residents to remove and safeguard the personal effects of the families whose homes were destroyed. Media attention was widespread for several days after the quake. [Denny Davies, ZION, 9/4]\n\nWednesday, September 30, 1992\n\n92-535 - Zion (Utah) - Skinhead Activity\n\nThe Sunday edition of the Salt Lake City Tribune contains an article on Skinheads who say that they plan to create a whites-only homeland in Zion National Park. The article was accompanied by a photo of eight adults and a child in front of the park's Great White Throne, a geological formation.\n\nThe group, which calls itself \"The Army of Israel\", recently moved from the Las Vegas area to the nearby community of Hurricane. According to Las Vegas police, the group is also known as the Christian Identity Skinheads, and is aligned with the Randy Weaver family/group near Naples, Idaho. Members of that group were involved in the recent shooting incident in which a U.S. marshall and Weaver's wife and son were killed. The news article also said that the skinheads consider white federal government agents to be \"race traitors\" and their enemies, and that they may attempt to hang a three-story-high swastika banner from the Great White Throne. Rangers are working with local law enforcement agencies and the FBI to monitor the group's activities. [Larry Van Slyke, CR, ZION, 9/28]\n\nThursday, October 1, 1992\n\n92-535 - Zion (Utah) - Update on Skinhead Activity\n\nOn the afternoon of Tuesday, September 29th, twelve individuals associated with Christian Identity Skinheads, a neo-Nazi group, gathered below the Great White Throne for an interview with a Salt Lake City television station. The group was watched by rangers during the entire hour and a half that they were in the park and left the area without further incident. The TV crew asked to interview the superintendent, but the superintendent declined to talk with them since the skinhead group seemed focused on gaining media coverage. The interview with the group did not appear on the Salt Lake channel that evening, possibly because the reporter was unable to get the park's viewpoint. The TV crew reported that the skinheads are planning on returning to Zion in a few weeks or months. At that time, the skinheads say that there will be 500 of them, that they will all be armed with guns, and that they plan on marching on the park. [Larry Van Slyke, CR, ZION, 9/30]\n\nTuesday, October 13, 1992\n\n92-555 - Zion (Utah) - SAR; Fatality\n\nAt 3:15 p.m. on October 10th, D.B., 32, of Salt Lake City, fell about 30 feet and suffered major injuries while attempting to rappel into the canyon of the left fork of North Creek near the park's western boundary. D.B. and two companions had tied their rope off on a small pinion pine near the canyon rim. His companions rappelled down safely; the 220-pound D.B. slipped when he attempted to descend, however, and the subsequent shock to the line pulled the tree out. D.B. fell backwards and landed on rock. Among the dozen or so other people at the location at that time was a doctor. He determined that D.B. had a pulse but that he was not breathing. Because D.B.'s airway was swollen, the doctor fashioned an airway out of the handle of a plastic milk jug, intubated him, and began ventilations. Meanwhile, a member of the party hiked out for help. Upon reaching the trailhead, he found a locked ranger vehicle. Since the ranger did not reappear (he was on foot patrol), the man broke the vehicle's window and used the park radio to call for help. The park received the call at 4:45 p.m. and immediately requested helicopters from Grand Canyon and Nellis AFB. The Nellis helicopter, which carried a paramedic, arrived at Hurricane at 6:30 p.m., and was on scene 15 minutes later. According to the park's chief ranger, the canyon posed one of the most difficult rescue problems he'd seen in 29 years - a slot canyon about 20 feet wide with 150-foot vertical walls. Nonetheless, the Air Force paramedic was successfully lowered to the scene, and he began working with the doctor to prepare D.B. for evacuation. At the same time, a team of two Grand Canyon and one Zion park medics began hiking in from the trailhead. By the time all was ready for the extrication at 7:50 p.m., night had fallen, and all subsequent operations were conducted by the helicopter crew while employing night vision goggles. D.B. was hoisted out and arrived at a hospital in St. George at 8:30 p.m. Although he still had a pulse at the time, doctors soon pronounced him dead.

G.R., who was under the influence of alcohol, was both disruptive and verbally abusive, and was arrested for disorderly conduct, interfering with an agency function, and being under the influence of alcohol. While being taken to jail, G.R. first inflicted two minor head wounds on himself by bashing his head against the plexiglass screen between the cruiser's front and back seats, then bit Wiger's right forearm. The bite penetrated Wiger's parka and long sleeve uniform shirt and drew blood. The rangers were only able to fully restrain G.R. after placing a blanket over his head. Wiger and G.R. were both treated for their wounds at the Cedar City Hospital. G.R. was then incarcerated. Charges for assaulting an officer are being sought against him.

A flashing light was spotted in the area about 500 feet from the canyon floor shortly thereafter and a hasty team was dispatched to establish voice contact. A two-man technical rescue team was helicoptered into the area and dropped off above the stranded party the next day. They located a fourth class route that brought them close to the party, then rappelled to their location. The climbers were slightly hypothermic, dehydrated and hungry (neither had eaten in three days), but otherwise in good condition. The rangers successfully belayed the pair to a landing zone. All parties were then flown off the mountain. [Dave Buccello, Acting CR, ZION, 11/3]\n\nThursday, March 18, 1993\n\n93-118 - Zion (Utah) - Dam Break\n\nA dam formed by a landslide on Taylor Creek in the Kolob section of the park broke at 9:30 pm last night, sending a ten-foot wall of water down the canyon and over Interstate 15. Because the highway is elevated, only two feet of water passed over the roadway. The force of the water was sufficient, however, to knock over a tractor trailer and several vehicles. Four injuries are known to have occurred. At the time of the report late last night, water was still flowing over the road but was subsiding. Water has also backed up on Ash Creek behind another naturally-formed dam, and it may fail in the near future. No park facilities are threatened and no evacuations are planned. County and FEMA authorities have been advised and are on alert. The park will make a damage assessment at 7 a.m. MST this morning. [Larry Weiss, Assistant Superintendent, ZION, 3/18]\n\nTuesday, March 23, 1993\n\n93-118 - Zion (Utah) - Follow-up on Dam Break\n\nInvestigators have determined that the earthen dam that failed on March 17th gave way at the base due to soil saturation. There was about one surface acre of water behind it, and water rose between eight and ten feet in the downstream channel after the breech. An eight-foot by thirty-foot culvert under Interstate 15 was not large enough to accommodate the wall of water which came down the channel; water therefore flowed over the road to a depth of about a foot and a half. The water covered about 100 yards of roadway and dissipated within about 20 minutes. It was the probable cause of four personal injury accidents involving two trailer trucks and two cars. Complete reports on the accidents are not yet available, but it appears that the water forced the vehicles off the roadway. One of the trucks turned over and remained under eight feet of water until it was removed by a wrecker on March 18th. It may have suffered significant damage. Injuries to passengers at this point are described as minor. A minor spill occurred when one of the truck's fuel tanks ruptured; a hazmat team was called in to handle it. The highway appears to have survived intact. [Jim Reilly, RAD/RMRO, 3/18]\n\nTuesday, May 4, 1993\n\n93-226 - Zion (Utah) - Evacuation\n\nAt 5:20 p.m. on April 30th, the Washington County sheriff's office notified the park that they'd received a report that water was flowing over the top of the 85-foot-high Kolob Reservoir dam. Water from the reservoir flows into the North Fork of the Virgin River, which runs through the park and the park's gateway communities of Springdale and Rockville. Both the park and sheriff's office began mobilizing personnel in event of a major flood. A model had been developed by Washington County which indicated that a catastrophic release of the reservoir would increase the river's flow to 75,000 to 80,000 cubic feet per second throughout all of Zion Canyon. A county helicopter which was dispatched to check the report arrived at the dam at 7:40 p.m. and reported that water was not flowing over the dam. By the time that report was received, all low-lying areas in the park had been secured and all park employees and visitors who might be affected had been notified and/or evacuated. Rangers then began the process of advising all those they'd contacted that the report had been false. Although the report was erroneous, it provided the opportunity for a very good and valuable exercise. [Larry Van Slyke, CR, ZION, 5/3]\n\nFriday, May 21, 1993\n\n93-274 - Zion (Utah) - Falling Fatality\n\nOn the evening of May 14th, two hikers advised the park that they had seen what they suspected were human remains in the rugged eastern end of the South Fork of Taylor Creek in the Kolob section of the park. A search party attempted to hike into the location that night, but the effort was suspended after midnight because of darkness and icy conditions. On May 15th, a Zion SAR team composed of climbing rangers and members of the local climbing community searched for and finally located the body after seven hours of travel over extremely hazardous terrain, including ice bridges, precipitous snow-covered cliffs, and unstable ground. The rugged, narrow canyon and high cliffs made helicopter evacuation impossible. The SAR team removed the body to a lower location, where they were assisted with hand-carry transport back to the trailhead by the Washington County sheriff's SAR team. A total of ten people from three agencies were involved. There was no identification on the victim and no climbing gear was present. It appears that the victim fell well over 1,000 feet. Because of the massive trauma sustained in the fall, immediate identification was impossible. The body was taken to the state medical examiner's office in Salt Lake City. Evidence taken from a lone car at the trailhead, together with dental records obtained from the family of the man to whom the car was registered, led the medical examiner to a positive identification of the victim as 21- year-old A.W.P. of Salt Lake City. The coroner ruled that A.W.P. had died within 36 hours of the discovery of his body. His auto was impounded by county officials. Suicide has not been ruled out.

D.M. was one of 51 people arrested that morning in a statewide sweep involving 275 officers. The arrests culminated a year-long undercover sting operation based in Holladay, Utah. Twenty-nine of those charged are gang members. Officers recovered $1 million in stolen property, including televisions, cellular phones, stereos, jewelry, 37 cars and two tractor-trailers loaded with interstate shipments. Homemade bombs, machine guns, and stolen military weapons were among the items exchanged at the Holladay gun shop which fronted the sting operation.

A search effort was begun the following morning. A body was soon spotted from the air at the base of a waterfall in that area, but it was uncertain whether the victim was a member of the group. No signs of other members of the group were found. The search was expanded later in the day to include ground teams, and a winch lowering system was brought in to lower a ranger to the body. At the time of the report late yesterday afternoon, the body had not yet been recovered and no trace had yet been found of group members. [Jim Reilly, RAD, RMRO, 7/19]\n\nFriday, July 23, 1993\n\n93-510 - Zion (Utah) - Two Drownings; Rescue\n\nOn July 14th, a group of five Explorer scouts and three leaders from the Mormon Church's Riviera Ward in Salt Lake City headed out from Lava Point for a four-day hike into the park through Zion Narrows. The group had hiked two miles into the Kolob Creek area, where heavy spring runoff had filled the creek to nearly double its normal level, when D.F., 24, got caught in a whirlpool. K.E., another of the group's leaders, pulled him out, but was in turn sucked into the pool. K.E.'s body was recovered by M.B., 35, the third leader, who tried but failed to resuscitate him. The hikers left K.E.'s body on the bank and hiked another 150 years, where D.F. was swept over a waterfall and sucked into another whirlpool. He did not resurface. M.B. decided that the group shouldn't risk further forays into the creek and should instead await rescue. Their wet suits, ropes and dehydrated food were lost in the creek, so the hikers huddled in an alcove and shared food from the one remaining backpack. The group was reported missing on Sunday, July 18th, and was spotted the following evening, largely because the party alerted searchers by lighting a fire with glue and burning plastic, thereby sending black smoke into the air. Rescuers flown in by helicopter rappelled down the canyon wall and used a hand winch to hoist the six survivors to a ledge. After spending the night there, they were flown out by helicopter. Surviving were M.B.; S.E., 14, the son of K.E.; C.S., 15; M.P., 17; J.N., 18; and R.L., 16. [Denver Post, 7/21]\n\nMonday, January 10, 1994\n\n93-510 - Zion (Utah) - Follow-up on Rescue\n\nOn July 15, 1993, D.F., 27, and K.E., 37, drowned in two separate incidents about an hour apart on private property in Kolob Creek adjacent to the park. The two victims, a surviving adult and five teen-age Explorer Scouts were on a four-day hike which was scheduled to conclude in the park on July 17th and had a permit for the last night of their trip through Zion Narrows. After they were reported overdue, an extensive helicopter search in very rugged terrain was initiated. The six survivors were located and rescued on July 19th through a cooperative effort by Washington County sheriff's officers and the park's SAR team. The body of K.E. was retrieved the same day; D.F.'s body was not located and retrieved until ten days later because of extremely high, cold water and steep narrow terrain. The latter recovery effort, directed by district ranger Dave Buccello, was one of the most technically demanding and hazardous retrievals undertaken by the combined county/park SAR team. The 12-day incident generated over 300 media inquiries, including live TV coverage from five stations in Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, and made the 1993 top ten story list for two of the three network affiliates in Salt Lake City. On January 3rd, the park received multiple tort claims for millions of dollars from attorneys representing families of both victims and survivors and passed them on to DOI's solicitor in Salt Lake City. The solicitor's office has up to six months to rule on the case. Attorneys for the families filed copies of the claims directly with the Utah media, which has generated many additional inquiries to the park. Media reports also indicate that the families are working with a movie studio on the development of a feature film.

Among the areas the couple hit were Yellowstone, Wind Cave, Bryce Canyon, Zion, Grand Teton and Grand Canyon. On August 25th, they were indicted in Salt Lake City on from 10 to 13 counts of five 18 USC violations, including conspiracy, theft and property damage. The E.s were arrested separately in Akron, Ohio, and Seneca, South Carolina, earlier this week. They both admitted guilt during subsequent interviews and revealed many more violations, including theft of firearms, stolen money, pawning of stolen items, and a previously unknown and similar crime spree in 1992 which added many more parks to the list of areas which they'd struck, including sites in Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, Texas, California, Oregon, Colorado, Nevada and Mexico. The investigation into their activities continues. Many NPS rangers contributed information leading to these arrests. M.D.E. is being held on without bond due to the risk of flight; J.A.S.-E. may be released on a $25,000 surety bond with house arrest and electronic monitoring. They will be brought to Salt Lake City and likely tried there.

Acting on a tip from Lew Hansen, a park maintenance employee, rangers Fred Hoeger, Shawn McNally, Beth Martin and Ed Dunlavey responded to the area and contacted M.H., P.M., F.L.P., and M.M. After multiple interviews, the four admitted to the jump and were cited under 36 CFR 2.17 (a)(3), air delivery by parachute. The jumpers subsequently led rangers to four separate locations where their equipment had been stashed. All equipment was seized pending court appearances, where forfeiture will be pursued.

Ranger Karen Frauson identified the driver as he entered the park, notified patrol, and requested the standard entrance fee. The driver refused to pay the fee, stating that he did not recognize federal authority, and drove on. Patrol ranger John Patmore stopped the vehicle a short time later. The driver, R.C.B. of Nevada, refused to identify himself, insisting that the federal government had no right to stop him and had no authority on Utah lands. R.C.B. drove off just as back-up ranger Ed Dunlavey arrived. The two patrol units began a pursuit of R.C.B., who now refused to stop. R.C.B. continued for a dozen miles to the park's east entrance, where road spikes were utilized in an attempt to stop him. R.C.B. was able to drive around the spikes, narrowly missing a Utah Highway Patrol officer in the process. He continued out of the park until stopped by sheriff's deputies at a roadblock about 21 miles from the point of the initial stop. R.C.B. was cited for numerous state and federal charges, including fleeing, interference with agency functions and failure to pay required fees. R.C.B. is a member of a local constitutionalist/\"wise use\" extremist group which has threatened land management rangers and policies in the past.

As two rangers from the park responded, the deputy reported speeds exceeding 100 mph, several attempts to ram his patrol vehicle, and shots being fired at him by an occupant of the vehicle. The driver of the fleeing vehicle lost control of the car three miles west of the park's entrance and went off the road; the male and female occupants fled on foot in opposite directions. Three other rangers responded and a search was begun. The woman was apprehended about an hour later by a county deputy. Around 3 p.m., park maintenance worker Paul Valencia, who was on-scene as an EMT for the Springdale/Rockville ambulance, noticed a bush shaking nearby and directed ranger Ed Dunlavey to the site, where the man was found shivering so hard from the cold that he was shaking the adjacent bush. He was arrested and transported to a local medical facility for treatment of a head wound which he'd received earlier that day. While trying to steal the new vehicle of a local resident in order to escape from the area, the vehicle's 70-year-old owner had clubbed him in the head with a two by four, effectively dissuading him from stealing the car. [Steve Holder, CR, ZION, 3/2]\n\nFriday, April 14, 1995\n\n95-152 - Zion (Utah) - Landslide; Partial Park Closure\n\nA 500 foot-long landslide occurred on the night of Wednesday, April 12th, causing the Virgin River to cut into and erode the road that connects the Zion Lodge with park headquarters and the main canyon. Rangers estimate that a 600-foot section of the road was destroyed by the cutting force of the river. The destruction of the road resulted in the isolation of the lodge from the rest of the park until emergency repairs were completed last night, thereby permitting about 300 guests and a number of employees to leave the lodge area, where they were confined for about 22 hours. No injuries or overdue persons have been reported. Although the seven-mile long inner canyon drive is temporarily closed, many trails are still accessible. The Kolob section of the park at Exit 40 on Interstate 15 was not affected by the slide.

Crews have placed riprap along the embankment of the temporary road to protect it from rising waters being fed by melting snows from the upper reaches of the Virgin River. Core samples have been taken of the underlying strata to determine if they are stable enough to support a permanent road; once these are analyzed, it will be possible to determine costs and timetables for completing the project.

They soon discovered that they were not prepared for existing water conditions, and that they could not extricate themselves from the canyon. They were trapped on a portion of the route near the popular Canyon Overlook trail, however, and a visitor heard and reported their calls for help. Responding rangers conducted a technical rescue and evacuated the trio. A thunderstorm struck the area as ranger Dave Buccello and the last of the three victims were being lifted from the narrow, slot canyon floor; while they were hanging on the rescue rope at the midpoint of the 150-foot canyon wall, a flash flood covered the canyon floor. It is certain that all three would have died if they hadn't been rescued. [Steve Holder, CR, ZION, 5/17]\n\nFriday, June 2, 1995\n\n95-247 - Zion (Utah) - Multiple Rescues\n\nOver the Memorial Day weekend, rangers were involved in three separate, complex technical rescues. On May 28th, a 20-year-old male fell 80 feet while scrambling on slick rock on the east side of the park and landed in a narrow crack system about 300 feet above the ground. A park medic rappelled to his location and provided advanced life support while the rescue team set up a technical haul system. Following a difficult, eight-hour extrication, the patient was flown to a local hospital, where he was diagnosed with over 50 fractures of his mandible, crushed temporal-mandibular joints, severe fractures of his right wrist and foot, and numerous other injuries. He will likely undergo at least five surgical procedures, and has been flown back to his home state of New Mexico. While rangers were clearing from this rescue, the park was notified of two injured juveniles in the remote Left Fork slot canyon on the park's west side. They were raised about 400 feet to the drainage rim the following morning, then helicoptered to an ambulance. Injuries were confined to a fractured fibula on one victim, and bilateral ankle sprains on the other. The two were part of a group of 21 who had ignored posted closures of this drainage due to high runoff from heavy snow melt and spring rains. On May 29th, four individuals were raised 100 feet out of the Pine Creek slot canyon after becoming stuck due to a lack of appropriate climbing gear and skills. This was the third technical rescue from Pine Creek in the last two months.

On the evening of June 2nd, medics responded to Springdale to assist local EMTs with an 88-year-old man experiencing chest pain. Shortly after their arrival, the man went into full arrest. Cardiac drugs, CPR and defibrillation were utilized to restore his pulse and breathing. During the lengthy transport to the hospital, the patient again went into full arrest and was again revived. He was treated at the hospital, and was to be released this week. On the following afternoon, medics and an off-duty park maintenance worker responded outside the park to assist EMTs with a 70-year-old resident who required resuscitation. Advanced airways, drugs and defibrillation were employed to revive him on scene. Emergency room doctors expressed their amazement at the medical crew's ability to resuscitate these particular patients while sustaining them during the almost hour-long transports.

Newspaper ads and radio announcements in southwestern Utah invited the public to participate in the march, which was set for 1 p.m. on New Year's Day. Media reports stated that planners hoped for several thousand participants. Because of First Amendment rights issues, the park coordinated planning with the Intermountain Field Area and WASO Ranger Activities management teams to assure a proper response in terms of the park's closure. About 80 southern Utah residents and out-of-town visitors showed up for the walk at the appointed hour. A local resident read a prepared statement which was critical of the way the budget impasse was handled. Her remarks, however, stressed that the NPS was not to blame and voiced strong support for the park's staff and the good relations between the town and the park. The event was covered by four Salt Lake City network stations and three area newspapers.

A third adult leader and the five Scouts survived the cold, fast moving water by moving onto a small ledge out of the water and waiting for rescue. After they were reported overdue, an extensive helicopter search in very rugged terrain was initiated. The six survivors were located and rescued on July 19th through a cooperative effort by Washington County sheriff's officers and the park's SAR team. The body of K.E. was retrieved the same day; D.F.'s body was not located and retrieved until ten days later because of extremely high, cold water and steep narrow terrain. The latter recovery effort was one of the most technically demanding and hazardous retrievals undertaken by the combined county/park SAR team. On January 3, 1994, the park received multiple tort claims for a total of about $24.5 million dollars from attorneys representing families of both victims and survivors. The plaintiffs alleged that there was a failure to warn them of how dangerous the route would be because of high water flow releases from a dam above the slot canyon route they attempted. The tort claim was subsequently denied. All but one of the survivors then joined in a civil suit against the park and the Washington County Water Conservancy District for unspecified damages. The case has generated substantial interest by the public, resulting in numerous newspaper and magazine articles. The media focus has centered around the issue of personal responsibility for safety versus the government role of attempting to judge personal skills and abilities of backcountry users. Media interest was raised recently when the government discovered the surviving adult scout leader was debriefed soon after their rescue by officials of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (many scouting groups are sponsored by LDS churches.) The debriefing was recorded and transcribed by church leaders. The plaintiffs argue that the documents are protected by clergy privilege and a judge is now reviewing the documents to make a final determination on whether or not any of the information will be released. On April 24th, government attorneys will argue for dismissal of this case based upon four issues:\n\no whether the park's decisions with respect to furnishing information to its visitors involve the permissible exercise of policy judgement and are protected by the discretionary function exception to the Federal Tort Claims Act;\n\no whether liability of the United States is also barred in this case by the misrepresentation exception to the Federal Tort Claims Act;\n\no whether, under Utah negligence law, the United States had an actionable duty of care toward the plaintiffs or their decedents upon which liability can be based; and\n\no whether the plaintiffs' claims against the United States are barred by the Utah Limitation of Landowner Liability Act.\n\nIf the case is not dismissed the trial will probably go forward in late June of 1996. [Denny Davies, PIO, ZION]\n\nFriday, June 21, 1996\n\n93-510 - Zion (Utah) - Follow-up on SAR-Related Court Case\n\nOn July 15, 1993, K.E., 37, and D.F., 28, leaders of a church- sponsored expedition from Salt Lake City, drowned in two separate incidents about an hour apart while attempting a hazardous route down Kolob Creek drainage on Zion's northern boundary. After receiving a report of the overdue party on July 18th (the last portion of the planned four-day trip was covered under a backcountry permit), the park initiated an air search for the party of eight and successfully completed a very hazardous rescue of the surviving adult leader and five teenage males, who had halted their expedition and were awaiting rescue. In January, 1994, attorneys for the families filed a $24.5 million tort claim with the Department of Interior solicitor in Salt Lake City. The claim was denied six months later. A civil case for wrongful death was subsequently filed in U. S. District Court in Salt Lake City against the United States and the Washington County Water Conservancy District, which directs releases from Kolob Reservoir into Kolob Creek. The jury trial was scheduled to begin on Wednesday, June 19th. On June 17th, however, the water conservancy district entered into an out-of- court settlement for an undisclosed sum. Based on a variety of factors, U.S. attorney S.M., Jr., decided to also seek an out-of-court settlement. The agreement reached on June 19th stipulated a cash settlement of $1.49 million for the 13 claimants. Superintendent Falvey and key staff who were briefed by S.M.'s staff prior to the announcement are convinced, in view of the findings, that the they negotiated a superior but difficult settlement. Because there was no trial or findings of contributory negligence, this case neither has, nor establishes, any legal precedent. As a result, the park's authority and mandate to manage backcountry operations remains intact. The federal attorneys provided several suggestions for operational improvements which will be implemented immediately. Specific targets are internal communication issues. This case and settlement continue to generate considerable public attention. Media reports reflect the fear that there would have been considerable pressure to curtail backcountry/ wilderness travel on public land if the United States had lost this case. In response, park staff has been stressing that this settlement is administrative only and does not establish case law. The media contacts have also allowed park staff to focus on the unique features of this case, which involved artificial releases of water into a backcountry slot canyon by another agency. Also stressed is that backcountry users bear the ultimate responsibility for their own well-being and that possession of a permit is no guarantee of safety. One newsman asked if we viewed this settlement as a victory. In our opinion, there are no winners in this case.

Several rocks up to two feet in diameter fell from an overhang and struck three visitors. Rangers Kassovic, Stubblefield, and Barnes responded with parkmedics Dave and Pat Buccello and treated a variety of injuries, ranging from a minor injury to a compound leg fracture with a transected Achilles tendon. The latter was suffered by a native of Switzerland who was taken to a hospital in St. George for surgery. The Weeping Rock trail was closed immediately and remained closed until the following morning so that an assessment could be made of additional hazards. [Steve Robinson, PIO, ZION]\n\nThursday, December 5, 1996\n\n96-677 - Zion NP (Utah) - Special Event\n\nSecretary Babbitt and the governor of Utah joined the park superintendent and water conservancy directors from Kane and Washington counties in the signing of a precedent-setting and historic water agreement on December 4th. The ceremony took place on the banks of the North Fork of the Virgin River at the Temple of Sinawava, seven miles upstream from park headquarters. This is the first such agreement in Utah; it forever protects the park from major reservoir developments upstream from Zion, while at the same time recognizing the need for future water development in the fast-growing southwestern corner of Utah. The federal government first filed for water rights in 1987, believing that the case would have to be adjudicated in state court. In 1991, however, through the efforts of the Service's water office in Fort Collins, the Department of Justice, and Utah water attorneys, the parties determined to pursue a negotiated settlement rather than a litigated process that would have been costly to all parties. That process came to fruition today with this signing ceremony. Secretary Babbitt and the state and county officials all congratulated those involved in this long process and commented that they hoped this event will set a new tone of collaborative effort for future state-federal agreements. A total of 80 people witnessed the signing in the outdoor event, which was covered by all three major network affiliates from Salt Lake City, several radio stations, the Associated Press, and local newspapers. There were no incidents during the hour-long ceremony. Assistant chief ranger Dave Buccello was IC; IMFA law enforcement specialist Brian Reiley and Park Police sergeant Norbert Bomjo coordinated security; IMFA public information office Karen Breslin assisted with media affairs. [Denny Davies, PIO, ZION]\n\nTuesday, January 7, 1997\n\n97-4 - Zion NP (Utah) - Climbing Fatality; Rescue\n\nOn January 2nd, J.C., 36, of Provo, Utah, apparently fell to his death while solo rock climbing on \"Prodigal Sun,\" a popular climbing route on Angel's Landing. Although there were no witnesses to the accident, it appears that one of his two ropes slipped through his rappel device, causing him to fall about 800 feet to his death. A search was initiated after the park was notified that J.C. was overdue. The park's search and rescue team discovered his body around 9 p.m. that day during one of the heaviest winter storms to strike the park in recent memory. Recovery efforts were hampered by severe flooding, which made it impossible for team members to ford the Virgin River. A high line system was established so that they could reach the body. It was removed by carrying it down a scree slope, placing it in an inflatable raft attached to the high line system, towing it across the river, then winching it from there to a parking lot. During this operation, rangers were also handling a second rescue in which four day-hikers were evacuated from the East Rim trail, where they'd been trapped by the rain/snow storm without equipment or food. After crossing the normally dry Echo Creek, which was three feet deep with flash flood water, rescuers were able to reach the hypothermic group and escort them to safety. [Dave Buccello, Acting CR, ZION]\n\nTuesday, March 18, 1997\n\n97-102 - Zion NP (Utah) - MVA with EMS Rescue\n\nOn the afternoon of March 16th, park dispatch received a report of a vehicle rollover about a mile outside the park's east entrance. Rangers responded with the park's structural fire engine, ambulance and rescue truck. The two occupants were both outside the vehicle and suffering from multiple injuries - C.B., 21, had shoulder, extremity and possible cervical injuries; K.S., 30, was trapped under the vehicle's right front tire. Rangers employed extrication tools to remove her. The women were taken by ambulance to separate local hospitals. K.S. was admitted to the hospital in St. George with multiple rib fractures and a pulmonary contusion. C.B. was lifeflighted from Kanab to Salt Lake city with neck pain, a concussion and a possible shoulder dislocation. Alcohol and/or drugs may have been a factor.

Bystanders attempted CPR and reported the fall to park rangers, who responded with advanced life support equipment. Due to the extent of T.E.' injuries, life-saving attempts were not successful and he was pronounced dead at the scene. According to eyewitnesses, T.E. had taken off his shoes and was wading in Heaps Creek when he apparently ventured too close to the edge of the middle pool, slipped, and fell about 100 feet to the base of the lower pool. A joint investigation by the park and county is underway.

Her husband was apparently hiking ahead of her and did not see her fall; there were no other witnesses. The accident is being jointly investigated by rangers and county deputies. The body was recovered by Zion's technical rescue team, which is comprised of employees and a cadre of four volunteers. This is the third accidental falling fatality in the park this year. None were reported in 1996.

The upper part of this canyon is difficult to reach and notorious for areas where falls are common. A total of 13 rescuers, including three visitors, were involved in the strenuous, seven-hour litter evacuation, which ended in darkness at 10 p.m. D.P. was admitted to a local hospital with a total of eight fractures, including a compression fracture of his lumbar spine, two pelvic fractures, and fractures to both ankles and his coccyx. The incident commander was assistant chief ranger Dave Buccello.

[Dispatch, ZION, 7/24]\n\nTuesday, August 19, 1997\n\n97-460 - Zion NP (UT) - Storm and Flash Flood Impacts\n\nEarly on the morning of August 10th, an unexpected thunderstorm dropped an inch and a quarter of rain on the park (as measured at headquarters) during a three-hour period - just under 10 percent of the park's average annual precipitation. The storm also produced very active lightning. Rainfall totals may have been higher along the Zion-Mount Carmel Road on the park's east side. The road soon became blocked by debris and washouts, and was closed by rangers. At the park's request, county deputies intercepted park- bound traffic 13 miles further east at Carmel Junction on U.S. 89 and advised them of road problems and delays; before they were able to get in position, however, over 100 vehicles had stacked up at the east entrance. A roads and trails crew headed by Jeff Ballard responded and found blockages in three different locations over a two-and-a-quarter mile stretch of road. The road was reopened in the afternoon after eroded portions were filled in with many truckloads of base material and debris was removed. Crews also dealt with minor washouts in the Watchman housing area. As a result of the heavy runoff, the flow of the Virgin River increased over a hundredfold, rising six feet and accelerating from 30 cubic feet per second (cfs) to over 3,000 cfs. Over 30 hikers had received overnight permits the previous day for the 16- mile-long Zion Narrows hike on the North Fork of the Virgin River, a hike which would have brought them out that day. Two hikers disregarded instructions to seek higher ground and to wait for waters to recede and instead decided to swim out of the canyon while the river was at severe flood stage. Both made it, but they lost most of their gear in the process. Others who stayed at their camps reported seeing the two pulled under several times as they swam past. The river receded by Monday, and the remaining groups of hikers made it out. By this time, park dispatch had received several reports of overdue parties. The hikers were interviewed as they exited the canyon; all reported that their designated campsites were above the flood line and that they were never in danger from rising water. [Denny Davies, CI/PIO, ZION, 8/12]\n\nWednesday, September 3, 1997\n\n97-524 - Zion NP (UT) - Rescue\n\nOn August 30th, D.G., 66, slipped and fell on the stream bottom while hiking the popular \"Subway\" route of the North Fork Creek. sustained a closed fracture of his lower right leg. The fracture was reduced and treated on scene by an orthopedic surgeon who happened upon shortly after the accident. Rangers responded to the scene and provided additional medical treatment. Due to impending darkness and the approximately three mile litter carry-out over rough terrain which would be required to reach the trailhead, was shorthauled from the scene by the Grand Canyon NP SAR helicopter team. [Dispatch, ZION, 9/2]\n\nThursday, September 18, 1997\n\n97-580 - Zion NP (UT) - Rescue\n\nD.B., 27, of Flagstaff, Arizona, was on a solo hike about two miles up the rain-swollen Virgin River narrows on the afternoon of September 14th when a rush of wind alerted him to an oncoming flash flood. D.B. turned around and raced 100 yards to a small side drainage, where he found refuge and avoided the brunt of the rushing water. Because of the fast-flowing water, D.B. was forced to spend the night at that location. He was lightly dressed, but warded off cool temperatures by building a small fire and doing exercises. Due to periodic flash floods and wildly fluctuating water flows, rescuers were unable to reach D.B. during the morning hours of the 15th. A helicopter was en route to his location that afternoon when the river flow subsided enough for D.B. to alternately swim and hike out. He was examined by a park medic and found to have suffered no injuries or ill effects from his experience. [Dispatch, ZION, 9/18]\n\nThursday, July 23, 1998\n\n98-415 - Zion NP (UT) - Severe Storm\n\nA severe weather cell accompanied by lightning, strong winds and heavy rain struck the park's headquarters area late on the afternoon of July 21st. The resulting damage temporarily closed the main park road, flooded parts of the Watchman campground, uprooted trees, and led to a four-hour power loss. Over an inch of rain and pea-size hail fell at park headquarters in less than an hour. Three loops of the campground were the most heavily impacted. Runoff from a nearby side canyon covered parts of campground loops A, B and C with six to ten inches of mud, gravel and debris. A few tents and personal belongings were damaged in the debris flow, but there were no reports of injured or missing visitors. After the storm passed, some campers voluntarily left the area, but most others moved to the many other parts of the campground that were unaffected by the runoff. At the time the storm hit, the campground was about half full. There was no flooding in the Virgin River and the storm impacts appeared to be confined to a small area around park headquarters. The storm also closed the Zion-Mount Carmel highway for about four hours. The road connects Zion Canyon with U.S. 89 on the park's east side. Debris swept across the road on the west side of Zion tunnel in four places. By 9 p.m., park crews and contract haulers had cleared the debris and reopened the road. The strong winds uprooted a large cottonwood tree in the employee housing area, but it caused no damage or injury. Lightning struck a power pole and caused a small fire, which was quickly contained by park crews. Power was soon restored. Damage assessments are currently underway. Crews are working to reopen loop C of the campground and continue the cleanup of mud and gravel on the Zion-Mount Carmel highway. No disruption of normal services or activities is expected. [Denny Davies, PIO, ZION, 7/22]\n\nThursday, July 30, 1998\n\n98-444 - Zion NP (UT) - Flash Flood with Two Fatalities\n\nHeavy rains caused flash flooding in the park on Monday, July 27th, that killed two hikers. The gauge on the Virgin River at park headquarters recorded an almost seven-fold increase in stream flow, which jumped from 108.5 cubic feet per second (cfs) to over 740 cfs. Because the National Weather Service had issued a flash flood warning, rangers warned visitors not to hike in Zion's slot canyons before the flood and throughout the day. As ranger Jon Anglin was checking the Narrows trail early on Tuesday morning, he was contacted by seven hikers who reported that they'd seen a body floating in the North Fork of the Virgin River the previous evening and had pulled it to shore. They were stranded by the high water, though, so were unable to hike out and report the incident until Tuesday morning. Rangers recovered the body at 10:45 a.m. They subsequently found an unlocked vehicle parked in Zion Canyon which had two wallets inside. A license in one of the wallets indicated that the victim was R.A., 27, of Long Beach, California; information in the other suggested that he was hiking with P.G., 31, of Paramont, California. Two other hikers confirmed that a man meeting P.G.'s description had been hiking with R.A. A search was immediately begun, which led to the recovery of P.G.'s body from debris in the North Fork on Wednesday. The two men had apparently been hiking in the Narrows when they were caught by the flood and swept away. The Narrows route is a rugged, 16-mile hike in a narrow canyon that is between 800 and 1,000 feet deep; about half the hike is through the river itself. All major trailheads in the park have signs warning people of the potential of flash floods. Park spokesman Denny Davies noted that the volume of water would have been almost impossible to withstand: \"At 150 cfs, it's impossible for even the strongest hiker to maintain his or her balance. At 740, you're lucky to survive.\" [Denny Davies, ZION, Michael Vigh, Salt Lake Tribune, 7/29]\n\nWednesday, August 5, 1998\n\n98-464 - Zion NP (UT) - Falling Fatality\n\nS.T., 27, of Palisade, Colorado, fell 30 feet and was seriously injured while scrambling in remote Hidden Canyon on the morning of August 1st. S.T. was hiking with his uncle, who witnessed the fall. It took him 90 minutes to walk out and report the accident to rangers, who hiked to the scene of the accident at the upper end of the canyon and found S.T. unconscious and suffering from major head injuries. A carry-out would have taken over four hours in the rugged, steep terrain, so a helicopter was summoned from the 66th Rescue Squadron at Nellis AFB in Las Vegas. They responded with an HH-60 helicopter with a long-line winch system which could drop a line into the narrow, 200-foot deep canyon. S.T. went into cardiac arrest five hours after the accident. CPR was conducted for an hour with no response before medical control authorized discontinuance. The helicopter was turned around and S.T.'s body was carried out. The carry-out entailed lowering the litter more than a dozen times over pour-offs and rough terrain. Twenty-five people were involved in the 12-hour operations, which lasted until midnight. Scott Brown was IC.

Hikers with W.H. moved him to an open area, then sent for help. Responding rangers stabilized W.H. and remained with him overnight. He was short-hauled out of the canyon by the Grand Canyon NP helicopter on the morning of the 23rd. [Scott Brown, IC, ZION, 8/24]\n\nMonday, September 14, 1998\n\n98-585 - Zion NP (UT) - Flooding\n\nHigh river flows in the North Fork of the Virgin River forced a temporary closure of the access to Zion Lodge on Saturday, September 11th. Over two inches of rain fell on the park during the 10th and 11th, causing the river flow to jump from 280 cubic feet per second (cfs) to 4,200 cfs over a four- hour period on Saturday. The river damaged a retaining wall along the scenic drive in the canyon, then undercut the road, creating a sink hole 30 feet long, 15 feet wide and 20 feet deep. The closure affects only the last six- and-a-half miles of the dead-end canyon drive. All other roads and services remain open. Federal Highway engineers arrived in the park over the weekend to begin assessing damages and developing repair plans with park staff. [Denny Davies, ZION, 9/11]\n\nTuesday, September 15, 1998\n\n98-585 - Zion NP (UT) - Follow-up: Flooding, Road Closure\n\nZion Lodge and Zion Scenic Canyon Drive were reopened yesterday morning following a closure mandated by collapse of a portion of the drive due to high river waters. Federal Highway engineers worked with park and contract crews to complete temporary emergency repairs over the weekend. Once they were completed and engineers determined that the road's integrity had not been compromised, the road was reopened, making it again possible to reach the lodge. An estimate of the cost of the emergency repairs is still being formulated.

Three local fire departments responded, but a large portion of the inside of the house had been consumed by the time they arrived. Although none of the family members was injured (the family dog also survived unscathed), virtually everything in the house was destroyed. The cause of the fire in the three-bedroom modular structure, located in Kolob Canyon, is still under investigation. The Hoegers do not have insurance to cover their personal losses. Michele's mother also died over the weekend, and the family has departed for a few days to attend the funeral. Zion NP, Cedar Breaks NM and Pipe Spring NM are gathering clothing and other needed items, and park management is exploring all options to get assistance for the family. The most urgent need at present, however, is obtaining sufficient funds to buy clothes and essentials. The Zion Natural History Association has established a donation account to facilitate this process. Checks should be made out to \"ZNHA- Hoeger Fire Fund\" and sent to Zion Natural History Association, Zion National Park, Springdale, UT 84767.

The woman missed several of the rock cairns marking the trail while returning from a day hike to Cable Mountain, so instead followed a drainage that she felt would lead her back to the trail. She climbed down several pourovers and swam several pools before becoming too cold and exhausted to continue. She spent the night soaking wet, standing on a rock surrounded by water. Her daughter, who was staying at a hotel in Springdale, reported her missing at 8 a.m. on Sunday morning. Ranger Jon Anglin was able to make voice contact with the missing woman by mid-morning. Anglin and rangers Scott Cooper, Tony Thaler, and Brent McGinn reached her after swimming through deep pools of 48-degree water that required the use of drysuits. When found, the woman's oral temperature was 92 degrees. She was dried, warmed, and outfitted with warm clothes and a drysuit. Her temperature began to rise before evacuation. Since a vertical evacuation was impossible, she was helped out on foot. The evacuation consisted of technical raisings at four locations, the highest of them 15 feet. Seventeen park employees from various divisions participated in the rescue. The overnight low was 40 degrees.

L.E. reported that V.G. went into an immediate seizure, then was unconscious for about 15 minutes while hanging in his climbing harness. L.E. rappelled off the wall, contacted another group of climbers, asked them to go for help, then climbed back to the accident scene and lowered V.G. to a ledge. A four-person technical SAR team led by assistant chief ranger Dave Buccello began a night technical rescue operation. They were supported by another dozen members of the park staff. V.G. was provided with advanced life support while being lowered over 600 feet from the ledge. The rescue operation was completed at 3 a.m. V.G. was taken by park ambulance to St. George, then flown to Las Vegas by air ambulance. He remains in critical condition and in a medically induced coma to help him recover from his brain injury. V.G. was not wearing a climbing helmet. In addition to the complicating factors of a technical rescue at night, rescuers had to deal with freezing temperatures, wind, rock fall hazards, and evacuation across numerous rivers.

S.S. was climbing with a group of friends and was near the end of the route. She was trying to release a jammed rope from their previous rappel when a rock dislodged, causing her to lose her balance and fall. The remaining members of the group did not have a rope long enough to complete the final rappel. At 6 p.m., an employee of Zion Lodge heard shouting from the cliffs above the lodge and contacted park dispatch. John Hannon, the first ranger to arrive on scene, found S.S.'s body. The others in the group tied ropes, a sling, belts and packs together and lowered them to rescuers, who attached a 300-foot rope which they pulled up to them. They then rappelled down. S.S.'s body was removed that evening. The five-hour operation was conducted in darkness by 15 park employees from all divisions and three climbers from the local community who train with park staff. Scott Brown was IC. [Tom Haraden, ACI, ZION, 1/23]\n\nMonday, May 17, 1999\n\n99-180 - Zion NP (UT) - Attempted Armed Robbery; Shots Fired\n\nRangers responded to a report of shots fired on the Zion Canyon scenic drive on the evening of Thursday, May 13th. Two women sitting in their vehicle at a pullout reported being approached by a man with a gun who demanded their money. After they told him that they had no money, the man reached for the vehicle keys, at which point the women drove off. Several shots were fired, striking the left front tire, left rear door, and rear window. A roadblock was established, but failed probably due to the length of time it took before a passerby reported the incident at the park lodge. A sheriff's department search dog and crime scene technician were called in and recovered a considerable amount of evidence; a composite sketch of the suspect is being prepared. Climbers on the adjacent cliff face have provided a vehicle description and a western states lookout has been distributed. [Brent McGinn, ZION, 5/14]\n\nWednesday, May 19, 1999\n\n99-180 - Zion NP (UT) - Follow-up: Attempted Armed Robbery\n\nOn the evening of Thursday, May 13th, an armed man shot at two women in their vehicle in Zion Canyon after a failed robbery attempt, striking the vehicle three times. Fifteen employees from all park divisions searched the roadway adjacent to the crime scene on Friday, looking for evidence that may have been discarded as the assailant fled. Over the weekend, park and concession employees were screened to rule out a possible suspect living in the park. A composite sketch was released to the public on Monday and was to appear in local newspapers yesterday. Physical evidence is being analyzed and individual rangers are being contacted about unusual or suspicious incidents around the time of the shooting. Follow-up interviews with the witnesses and victims were also conducted yesterday. There's no indication as to whether the assailant is a local resident or someone passing through the area, or why he picked the two young women, who were waiting for their boyfriends to finish climbing. He is thought to be an amateur, as he was shaking and very nervous during the attempt. [Brent McGinn, ZION, 5/18]\n\nMonday, September 20, 1999\n\n99-566 - Zion NP (UT) - Flooding\n\nThe park received two-and-a-half inches of rain on August 30th, causing a 30- fold increase in the flow of the Virgin River. Dozens of visitors were unaccounted for in the Narrows of the Virgin River for up to 36 hours. Debris and damage caused the park to close roads for an hour while crews cleared and checked them. No visitor or employee injuries were reported. [Aniceto Olais, CR, ZION, 9/7]\n\nFriday, October 1, 1999\n\n99-593 - Zion NP (UT) - Poaching Incidents\n\nOver a period of from two to three weeks, three local men made numerous trips up the Kolob Terrace Road, which passes through the park and private inholdings, and shot and killed at least 18 deer and one adult bull elk. The head and antlers were removed from the elk, but all the deer and elk were left to rot. A joint investigation was conducted by rangers John Bueg and Pat Zurcher and officers from the Utah Department of Wildlife Resources. Evidence located at several points made it possible for them to identify the suspects. A search warrant was secured for one of the suspect's garages; the elk antlers were found there and seized. All three men then made full confessions. Under Utah law, wanton destruction of wildlife is punishable as a third-degree felony if the aggregate value of the protected wildlife is more than $500. State law also makes it a third degree felony to take a bull elk with an antler size equal to or larger than the one the men had taken. The punishment is up to five years in prison, plus restitution of $8,000. The case is still under investigation. The state has taken the lead, as the poaching incidents were found to all be on private inholdings. [Aniceto Olais, CR, ZION, 9/29]\n\nTuesday, October 5, 1999\n\n99-599 - Zion NP (UT) - Rescue\n\nOn the evening of October 2nd, rangers received a report that a woman had fallen over 100 feet over a cliff near Potato Hollow on the West Rim. She was said to be conscious, but suffering from severe trauma to both lower legs. A helicopter being used for park fire operations shuttled the park's technical rescue team and equipment to the scene before dark. The victim - 22-year-old A.P. - had been exploring and scrambling down the head of Imlay Canyon. She was about 100 feet below the rim when she lost her footing and fell an additional 100 feet into the three-foot-wide slot. Team members reached and stabilized her, then raised her the 200 feet to the rim. A Flight for Life helicopter from Las Vegas landed at the helispot at 11 p.m. and flew her to a hospital in that city. A.P. suffered bilateral fractured ankles (one of them open) and contusions to her head. The rescue team hiked five miles to Lava Point and cleared from the operation at 4 a.m. [Scott Brown, IC, ZION, 10/4]\n\nTuesday, November 2, 1999\n\n99-637 - Zion NP (UT) - Rescues\n\nOn October 16th, park dispatch received reports of three backcountry incidents - all requiring SAR and EMS - within the space of 30 minutes. The first was a fractured ankle in Hidden Canyon, the second a fractured ankle at Upper Emerald Pool, and the third a minor injury requiring evacuation of a party of three from Pine Creek Canyon. A total of 18 park staff and SAR team volunteers participated in the rescues, which required levels of intervention ranging from a simple wheel-out to semi-technical evacuation to a technical rope-raising operation. The park's SAR team had just finished the last day of a week-long technical rescue seminar at the head of Pine Creek when the reports started coming in. This permitted a quick response to the Pine Creek incident and immediate mobilization of personnel to assist on the other two evacuations. All those needing medical attention were en route to the hospital within three hours of receipt of the first reports. [Aniceto Olais, CR, ZION, 10/22]\n\nFriday, November 19, 1999\n\n99-682 - Zion NP (UT) - Rescue\n\nOn the afternoon of November 13th, rangers received a report of a rappelling accident at the Great Arch. Responding rangers hiked to the scene and found a 17-year-old boy at the base of the cliff. He was conscious and breathing, but had suffered multiple fractures and contusions. Investigation revealed that the young man and his party had tied a 400-foot rope and a 200-foot rope together with an overhand bend in an attempt to reach the bottom. One member of the party successfully rappelled past the knot with a figure eight descending device. The second member was passing the knot when it came untied and he fell 20 to 30 feet to the ground. The park's technical rescue team lowered park medic Cindy Purcell 450 feet down to the victim. He was treated and raised to the rim, then transported by ambulance to a local hospital.
