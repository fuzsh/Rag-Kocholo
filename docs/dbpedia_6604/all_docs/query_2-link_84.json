        "text": "Last week, I wrote about how Guild Wars and Guild Wars 2 are in terms of representing women in their games, and the consensus I reached was – rather well done. Not 100% perfect, but well done. Better than most games around. This week I am going to talk about another area where GW has shown themselves to be more progressive than many other games – the presentation of race and ethnicity.\n\nPut short, this isn’t a white-washed series of games.\n\nStarting out in Prophecies, at least, the game seems to be a standard Western fantasy game – the setting, as well as the characters, all seem to be western European. And then the Searing happens, you leave Ascalon…and that is about the last time you see that from the games again. The next place you visit in the game, Kryta, is still clearly European…but the inhabitants of Kryta are darker-skinned, with a more Mediterranean look to them. This includes not only the standard NPCs that are all over the region, but also the White Mantle and Shining Blade members themselves.\n\nFactions and Nightfall are games based in regions with cultures that are not typical Western fantasy at all; Nightfall really shines at setting itself apart, but I’ll get back to that one. Factions is set in an East Asian setting. It’s mostly Japanese…which, okay, yeah. That’s a bit cliche. But considering the fact that anime had just become very popular in the US not long before Factions was released, isn’t too surprising. The campaign isn’t entirely based on just Japan, though; there are also Chinese influences there (the celebration of Canthan New Year, for example, which takes place real-time during the Lunar New Year, and the fact that Cantha uses the Chinese zodiac cycle). There are also two vassal nations that are ruled by Cantha – the Kurzicks, which are heavily Germanic (the names in particular) and use architecture reminiscent of Gothic architecture, as well as the Luxons, a nomadic people whose names tend to be based on Greek names.\n\nAnd then we have Nightfall. My favorite campaign for a number of reasons. Nightfall truly stands here, I think. The setting is one that is not at all commonly used in games; the Elonan nations are based on and influenced by a blend of Northern African cultures, as well as some Middle Eastern influences (especially in Vabbi). As a result, there are almost no typical white European characters in Nightfall – except for possibly your player character and a few henchmen (mostly the ones recruited to help from Tyria). The Zaishen are also there, but they are Canthan in origin. Elona as a whole is portrayed to having been in the best shape of the three continent seen in the games – Tyria had Ascalon battling the Charr for ages, the Cataclysm, and the rise of the White Mantle long before the game started. Cantha has been dealing with the war between the Kurzick and Luxons as long as the Empire had existed, as well as increasingly xenophobic tendencies.\n\nWhereas Elona has Istan, a nation that is a meritocracy as well as the home of the Sunspears, who protect the entire continent; Kourna, a more war-like and militarized nation; and Vabbi, a rich province led by a trio of merchant-princes. All three nations were able to co-exist with no problems until Varesh began poking into Abaddon and Kormir awakened the Apocrypha. They have a thriving economy, and while the three nations are separate from each other, they do, up until the game has started, work together quite well.\n\n“But, Verene,” you might be asking. “What’s the point of mentioning this? Why does it all matter?”\n\nWell, here’s the thing. A lot of video games in the west tend to feature solely white characters, and if they do feature anyone of other races, it’s done so in a way that panders to stereotypes. In other words, it tends to be not handled well and it’s not uncommon for it to be downright offensive.\n\nGuild Wars, though, blows this out of the water. There are other races and ethnicities than just “generic white person” shown, and they’re shown to be intelligent and competent, as opposed to simply falling back on offensive stereotypes in their portrayals. The argument can be made that Varesh Ossa, a black woman, is the most terrifyingly competent character in the entire series. This is so exceedingly rare in games as to likely be almost unique.\n\n(I intended to talk more about Kormir and Varesh in this post, but there’s so much about them that I could discuss I plan to save it for a future post.)\n\nI do hope that Guild Wars 2 continues in this trend. I hope that there are expansions where Cantha and Elona can be visited. I was very pleased to hear a few weeks ago that, while if you create a human you are playing a Krytan, you can choose to be ethnically Canthan or Elonan (pleased me as my human thief will be the descendant of my Dervish, so I needed the option to make a black character). I can’t wait to see the variety of characters we’ll see in-game, and I do hope that we do see a wide variety. Why take a step back from what your previous games established, after all?\n\nPosts still to come in this series include discussions on sexuality and religion and how they are handled in the Guild Wars universe."
