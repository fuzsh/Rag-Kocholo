        "text": "eGames, Inc. was founded as RomTech Inc. in Langhorne, Pennsylvania, in 1992. The company \"went public\" in the US stock exchange in 1995 after merging with Applied Optical Media.\n\nThe company acquired software publisher Virtual Reality Laboratories, Inc. of San Luis Obispo, California, in April 1996, and FileABC in September 1996.\n\nRomTech, Inc.'s most lucrative sales strategy came about with the branding of Galaxy Software as a publishing label and the Galaxy of Games compilations. Those titles were sold exclusively in US chain stores (Best Buy, Target, K-mart etc.) and exceeded all sales projections at the time.\n\nIn 1998, Joseph A. Falsetti was the company's Chief Executive Officer.\n\nOn 1 March 1999, RomTech changed its name to eGames, Inc. and announced that it would be concentrating all its efforts on PC games.\n\nOn 6 October 2005, eGames, Inc. acquired Cinemaware, Inc. and released the first titles under its new affiliated label, Cinemaware Marquee, in 2006."
