        "text": "The player takes on the role of a wagon leader guiding a group of settlers from Independence, Missouri, to Oregon's Willamette Valley on the Oregon Trail via a covered wagon in the year 1848.\n\nYou must use a horizontally-sliding paddle to bounce a ball against colorful bars at the top of the screen. Each segment of the bars touched by the ball disappears. The object is to keep the ball ricocheting between your paddle and the bars above until the bars are completely gone and you \"break out\". You get points for each bar segment you get rid of. If the ball drops below your paddle, you lose a life.\n\nCommonly considered as one of the most influential video games of all time, the goal is to defeat wave after wave of descending aliens with a horizontally moving laser cannon to earn as many points as possible.\n\nThe player controls a square avatar whose quest is to explore an open-ended environment to find a magical chalice and return it to the golden castle. Three dragons and an item-stealing bat roam the castle as well.\n\nEmbark on a quest for the amulet of Yendor in the Dungeons of Doom! Magical items help you, the hero, to overcome the increasingly powerful monsters. Find the amulet to break the spell to enable an ascend to freedom.\n\nYou control a yellow crab-shaped shooter that travels along the outside rim of a 3-dimensional tunnel, shooting enemies down the alleys of the tunnel while avoiding any coming down the alleys. The tunnel takes on many different forms, and the shooter has a special \"superzapper\" that enables it to kill all enemies present in the tunnel.\n\nA multi-user dungeon (MUD) is both a style of role-playing game and the name of one of the original text-based multiplayer online role-playing games of this genre. MUD was created by Roy Trubshaw and Richard Bartle in 1980. MUD was modeled after earlier text-based adventure games and became a popular game to play over Telenet, an early commercial Internet. Multi-user dungeons are sometimes referred to as multi-user dimensions or multi-user domains.\n\nTold in second person, you play an AFGNCAAP (an Ageless, Faceless, Gender-Neutral, Culturally-Ambiguous Adventure Person) who begins in a serene setting, a house nestled in a thick forest. But your adventure really begins when you discover that the house leads to an expansive dungeon of forgotten lore and you must recover it's treasures from a tricky thief.\n\nThe players use shields to defend their castle walls from the fireballs that ricochet around the playfield. Players can capture and catapult the fireballs at opposing castles. Fireballs destroy pieces of the castle walls they hit.\n\nThe player controls a gun that can only move in the bottom fifth of the screen. The object is to shoot a centipede that works its way down to the player area through a field of mushrooms. Other attacking enemies are fleas, spiders, and scorpions."
