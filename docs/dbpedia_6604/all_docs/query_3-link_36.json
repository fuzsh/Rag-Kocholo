        "text": "This thesis aims to show the impact of the e-Sports phenomenon in the Philippines starting from the years 2000-2015. The e-Sports phenomenon in the Philippines started in the 2000s, brought in by influx of Korean immigrants who had a thriving e-Sports culture of their own back home in Korea. This thesis is supported by the theory of cultural diffusion by way of relocation. The e-Sports phenomenon in the Philippines has brought about the creation of corporations like Mineski, The Net Com (TnC), etc.; created leagues such as the Mineski ProGaming League (MPGL), etc.; and has sent representative players to travel to countries like Germany, South Korea, Singapore, etc. Though it has been 15 years, the e-Sports scene in the Philippines is still largely underdeveloped and is still struggling for their big break into Philippine mainstream media. This thesis will employ the descriptive-analytic method in understanding the study. The significance of this paper is to raise awareness regarding the e-Sports phenomenon and its impact and relevance to contemporary Philippine culture, and also aims to show the contributions and achievements of the Philippine e-Sports industry.\n\nThis Field Trip brings together three scholars and two game designers working at the nexus of Asian American studies, Asian studies, and critical game studies. We discuss how digital games as an \"Asiatic\" medium function socially, culturally, politically, and economically and how games speak to Asian/American experiences through forms of play. The forum looks beyond representations of Asian Americans in games to ask how games themselves have become Asiatic products even when they contain no explicit racial representations, as they are manufactured and innovated in Asian contexts and are often concerned with, and played by, sizable Asian audiences. We also seek to push beyond critiques of games as frivolous cultural objects or as mindless militaristic purveyors of violence and rather ask how games and gaming cultures play with forms of race, gender, sexuality, and nation and offer alternative ways of thinking about \"difference\" more broadly. The following documents explore, from four different angles, how games have been framed as forms of \"Digital Asia,\" as products of Asia and transpacific empire, and how games have permitted forms of solidarity and resistance for Asian/American communities. We ask, How does play function within virtual spaces conceived of as Asian or Asian inflected? How are familiar Orientalist tropes reframed in the particular language of gaming? How have Asian/Americans been shaped within gaming and developer communities? This enterprise took the form of a roundtable carried out virtually across four simultaneous Google documents over a series of a few months.\n\nThe following abstract is aimed to put into question how both the Japanese and Western gaming industries have differentiated themselves so much today, offering game systems and narratives that vary widely from each other. In the history of the medium, this differentiation was initially established because some semiotic and mechanic elements were identified to identifiable Japanese or American market tastes. Most of the time, the reasons that have been made to explain this difference within the medium have relied on either essential cultural differences or market determinism based on historical preferences. However, this paper argues that these differences aren't just formed due to specific cultural images or economic reasons, but mainly because of the formation of an identity discourse on the industry that has ghettoized specific formulas of player engagement to some cultural regions or supposedly minority groups. In the case of Japanese video games, we argue that several design conventions on the part of Japanese game designers have led to a paradigm that is unique to their cultural context. This paradigm can be distinguished from the one prevalent in the West because it has usually favored games that rely more heavily on the use of what we call “explicit narratives” to contextualize their rules, which have been solidified into several known “game genres” like the JRPG (Japanese Role Playing Game), the “Visual Novel” and others. This paradigm was also highly influential in creating other genres that are ubiquitous in the medium today, specially during the era of the Japanese industrial dominance of the 80's and 90's. This model also encompass semiotic elements that are either textually related to other forms of Japanese media or have been used almost exclusively on Japanese video games. However, its presence has been reduced significantly today, to the point that it has become representative of games developed exclusively by the Japanese video game industry, even though it might be found outside that region. More so than that, it has been integrated within a bigger cultural discourse that identifies several forms of cultural artifacts as extensions of Japan into Western popular culture. Throughout this paper, we will explore the main elements that characterize this paradigm, including the concept of explicit narratives, and their manifestation on specific games. Finally, we will analyze its current influence on the development of the modern image of Japan, both in gamer consumer culture and the overall gaming industry today."
