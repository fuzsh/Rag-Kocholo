        "text": "Colorado’s Byers Peak, a stately mountain that sits northwest of the resort town of Winter Park, is named after William Newton Byers, who founded the Rocky Mountain News newspaper, which was published in Denver until 2009.\n\nFitting then that fellow hiker Scott and I were conceiving some bold headlines earlier this month while descending from the summit. We were discussing the state of college football and agreed the sport ought to be considered wholly apart from other collegiate sports. We thought it was best suited for a tier system like English soccer. Gather the top teams into a Premier League-type grouping at the top and arrange the other programs into leagues based on resources and geography, etc.\n\nThe meeting of our minds happened randomly. We picked the same sunny, cooler-than-normal July day to hike the same mountain. Conversely, the conversation was predictable, especially after we shared some of each other’s background and Scott learned I was a career sportswriter.\n\nI’ve been hiking in Colorado for decades and sports trails only the weather in terms of subject matter most likely to start and sustain a conversation. And the weather leads by virtue of pertaining to any day’s prevailing circumstances.\n\nTwo days earlier, while on a different hike, the conditions were iffy. The clouds seemingly couldn’t decide whether to lift and disperse or to hug the ridge line and drop a heavy wet load on us. The hikers I encountered were understandably wary and wanted to know what I thought, since I had been out there before them. Still, one hiker punctuated our metrological conference by nodding toward the Pittsburgh Penguins cap I was wearing and saying, “I like your hat.”\n\nUnfazed by the weather, Scott and I went all in on sports. We both were graduates of Big Eight Conference schools, back when there was such a thing. His Nebraska and my Missouri were big football rivals, who played their share of memorable games. The trail we were navigating became a memory lane of sorts.\n\nOur conversation made a good day even better. It got me to thinking about who and what might constitute a similar sort of sporting day in the high country:\n\n-It would be fun to visit with an athlete, any collegiate athlete, about NIL and how it’s changed their life. Has it impacted their perspective as well? There has to be so much more to this than a well-stocked dorm-room fridge.\n\n-Love to catch up with former Lady Vol basketball player Cierra Burdick, who just won an Olympic bronze medal in 3x3 basketball. She was always game for a good chat. She’s bound to have some great stories about Paris as well as her other basketball travels over the years.\n\n-If I encountered a UT fan, I would ask what were your three most memorable games and why. I’d expect to hear comparable amounts of ecstasy and anguish. I knew a fan, may his soul rest in peace, who was haunted by Tennessee’s 9-6 upset loss to Alabama in 1990.\n\nEither way, it would make for good conversation.\n\n* * *"
