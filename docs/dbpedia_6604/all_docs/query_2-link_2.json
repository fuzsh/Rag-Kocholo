        "text": "Template:Infobox Company Nightfall Games is a United Kingdom based role-playing game publishing company notable for publishing SLA Industries\n\nHistory[]\n\nNightfall Games was founded by Dave Allsop, Anne Boylan and Jared Earle in April 1993 in Glasgow, Scotland. In September 1993, Nightfall released their role-playing game SLA Industries and after releasing their first sourcebook Karma in 1994 Nightfall was purchased by Wizards of the Coast (WotC). Nightfall was started up again in 1998 by Allsop, Earle and Tim Dedopulos after regaining the rights to SLA Industries from WotC. In 1999 Nightfall partnered with Hogshead Publishing to continue publishing SLA Industries. In 2003, when Hogshead closed operations[1], Nightfall partnered with Cubicle 7 Entertainment. In 2004 Dave Allsop, the creator of SLA Industries, temporarily resigned from Nightfall.\n\n[]"
