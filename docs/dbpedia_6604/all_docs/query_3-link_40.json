        "meta_description": "Women in Tabletop\r\nGaming Month:&amp;nbsp;Lynne Hardy, assistant editor for Call of CthulhuSerious ones first:1. What is your\r\nbackground? I originally trained as a biomedical research scientist. My\r\nB.Sc was in Biochemistry, and I followed that up with a Ph.D in Human Molecular\r\nGenetics (both at Newcastle University). After a few years as a researcher,\r\nincluding a stint in Toronto, I became a college lecturer, as well as giving\r\ntalks on and teaching various embroidery techniques all over the Northeast of\r\nEngland. Finally, about six years ago now, I became a full-time freelance games\r\nwriter, designer, and editor (having done freelance work part-time since my\r\nPh.D days).2. How long have you\r\nbeen gaming? What attracted you to it in the first place, and how were you\r\nintroduced to it?I’d been aware of gaming’s existence since ET: The Extra-Terrestrial and the Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons cartoon, and the\r\nidea of collaborative story-telling intrigued me. But, I didn’t know of any\r\ngaming groups at my school. (It later turned out that the lads I’d done all my\r\nA-level subjects with had a group, but hadn’t asked me to join because they\r\ndidn’t know if it was my “thing” or not.) I actually began gaming thanks to\r\nwearing an American football shirt to the Fresher’s Party at my hall of\r\nresidence. Some members of the University team spotted it and we got talking;\r\nturned out, they were also gamers and they did invite me to join them. As all\r\nbar one of them was a GM—and they got me into that almost from the word “Go!”—I\r\ngot to play a huge variety of games, including RuneQuest, Call of Cthulhu,\r\nRolemaster, Spacemaster, Shadowrun, AD&amp;amp;D—even MERP, once!3. How did you get\r\ninto the gaming industry?I loved running Talislanta,\r\nand when Wizards of the Coast took it over, I sent them some sample scenarios.\r\nThey rang me, invited me to Euro Gen Con down at Camber Sands, and the rest, as\r\nthey say, is history! (Not that I ever had anything published by them directly,\r\nbut I did for Nightfall Games.) 4. What was the first\r\ngaming product you worked on, and in what capacity?If we’re not including the couple of Gloranthan freeform\r\nwrite-ups I did that ended up in various collections, then that would be the\r\nscenario ideas I contributed under my maiden name to Tales of Terror for The\r\nUnspeakable Oath.5. What was the last\r\ngaming product you worked on, and in what capacity?I’m working on multiple projects at the moment—some writing\r\n(including&amp;nbsp;Children of Fear for Call of Cthulhu), some editing (for\r\nChaosium and Green Ronin’s Blue Rose).\r\nThere are a couple of other projects that are complete but haven’t been\r\nannounced yet (or are teetering on the edge), so I’d best not say anything\r\nabout them! 6. What has been the\r\nmost challenging gaming product you’ve worked on, and why? (Alternatively, this\r\ncould be the gaming product you’ve learned the most from working on)That would have to be the Achtung! Cthulhu Kickstarter project for Modiphius. That was a lot\r\nof books to shepherd into the world for someone who, up until that point, had\r\nonly worked as a writer and done a few little bits of editing. (And who was,\r\noriginally, hired to be the researcher for someone else). My Dad also died suddenly\r\nand unexpectedly just as the files for the first two books came in for editing,\r\nso having to deal with sorting out his estate at the same time made it\r\nsomething of a fraught experience all round. Thankfully, I had my core team of\r\nMichal Cross, Dave Blewer, and Dim Martin there to support me so, in the end,\r\nit was a very rewarding project, but it wasn’t always easy at the time.7. What has been the\r\nmost enjoyable/rewarding gaming product you’ve worked on, and why?Gosh, there have been a few. As both a playtester and a\r\nwriter, I had immense fun working on Dying\r\nEarth (Pelgrane Press)—the setting a style of play just suited our group’s\r\nidiom down to the ground. Cogs, Cakes\r\n&amp;amp; Swordsticks, my steampunk pulp adventure game, has opened so many\r\ndoors for me professionally, as well as giving me the opportunity to introduce new\r\npeople to gaming who might not otherwise have got involved. And Scritch Scratch, Chaosium’s&amp;nbsp;Free RPG Day release this year, was also a pleasure to work on—I’ve had a huge amount of fun\r\ntesting it over the last couple of years at various conventions. It’s also a\r\ngreat honor to have your work chosen for something like that.And now for some more frivolous ones:8. Just how large is\r\nyour dice and/or stationary collection?Horrifically so. There are bags and boxes of dice all over\r\nthe house, in every size, shape, and color. And as for fountain pens and\r\nnotebooks…9. What is your\r\nfavourite gaming snack?We used to eat a lot of Marks and Spencer’s Percy Pigs when\r\ngaming, but they changed them and they’re not as nice now. So Haribo—preferably\r\nTangfastics—or Pringles (especially the nacho ones), depending on whether or not\r\nI’m in a sweet or salty mood.10. What’s the most\r\nunusual/exotic location you’ve gamed in? Or that one of your games has been\r\nplayed in?We did a live Vampire\r\ngame at Camber Sands many years ago between a children’s playground and the\r\nholiday camp’s laundrette—hardly exotic, but very atmospheric. (And cold, which\r\nis what you get for running a gaming convention on the southeast coast of\r\nEngland in November.) The most definitely exotic though has to be Cogs, Cakes &amp;amp; Swordsticks, which a\r\nlovely group informed me they’d played over the internet with their friend\r\nwhile he was backpacking in Kathmandu!Lynne Hardy is&amp;nbsp;assistant Call of Cthulhu line editor at Chaosium Inc.
