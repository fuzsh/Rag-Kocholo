        "text": "Fans of the Terminator franchise now have a new way to immerse themselves in the post-apocalyptic world of Skynet with the release of the Terminator RPG: T2 Judgment Day by Nightfall Games. The game is currently on Kickstarter, having raised £32,000 from a £10,000 goal with 20 days left to go.\n\nIn this role-playing game, players take on the role of Resistance fighters struggling against Terminators sent back in time to ensure the rise of the nuclear singularity. But in the world of Terminator 2, the lines between humanity and machines have become blurred. The Resistance has reprogrammed T-800s and is sending them back in time to guard key assets. However, Skynet is not going quietly into the night and has evolved its arsenal and strategies with new advances in polymimetic alloy.\n\nThe ‘Terminator 2, Judgment Day’ source book features 200 pages of all new content, including never-before-seen Terminator variants and hardware, playable Terminators reprogrammed to fight for the Human Resistance, and the Time Displacement Commandos (TDC), the Resistance’s elite troops sent back and forth in time to disrupt Skynet’s plans.\n\nPlayers can enter the 1990s, the critical seven years before the hammer falls on humanity, and play in any time zone, including the 1980s and the future war. They will face challenges of the future war, whether mechanical, animal, human, microbial, chemical, hybrid, or liquid metal. The game features all the main characters from the movie, such as Sarah Connor, John Connor, Miles Dyson, and the T-800 “Uncle Bob,” providing a wealth of new playable options and all new NPCs.\n\nThe rulebook also includes advanced hacking rules and a mission pack, enabling players to relive the ‘Terminator 2, Judgment Day’ movie and join the fight to bring down Skynet in a not-so-distant future war.\n\nPlayers can choose to play either pre-generated characters or create their own tailored to their preferences, weapon choices, and role within their team. If a character is killed, a new one can be brought in from the future, past, or present, even an alternate you from a divergent timeline.\n\nThe game features the Nightfall Games’ S5S system, a d10-based rules system tailored specifically to The Terminator setting. The system uses a pool of dice, one Success die, and five Skill dice per player. The more skilled your character is in the task being attempted, the more likely you are to succeed.\n\nThe Quickstart PDF offers a ‘rules lite’ look at the new system and provides seven pre-generated characters and an introductory scenario for up to five players. This game is not just a role-playing game; it’s a series of sourcebooks for the first two Terminator films and their expanded universe.\n\nThe Terminator RPG: T2 Judgment Day is an exciting and immersive way for fans of the franchise to experience the world of Skynet and the Resistance. With its extensive source book and customizable character options, players will have endless hours of gameplay ahead of them. The Kickstarter campaign still has 20 days to go, so fans should head over to the campaign page to get in on the action."
