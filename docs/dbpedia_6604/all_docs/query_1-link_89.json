        "text": "History of the Ideal Novelty and Toy Company\n\nMay 11, 2016 | by Becky Oeltjenbruns\n\nIt’s been a while since I’ve done a feature for the “toys and games” section. As I began my research, I wanted to find an iconic brand – something that we may not know much about – but one where we all would instantly recognize their work. I found the answer in the pages of my Antiques Roadshow 20th Century Collectibles book. (If you don’t have this in your reference library yet, I highly recommend it!) Without further ado, please join me on a quick tour of the history of the Ideal Novelty and Toy Company.\n\nFirst things first, let’s address that name. It couldn’t sound more generic, right? More un-assuming? Well, think again my vintage-loving friend! This company holds many first place distinctions from the teddy bear to the first plastic doll, from the invention of the sleepy eyes for dolls to that voice recording that said “mama.” When you think Ideal, think innovation. What I personally find so interesting is that this company was founded by a husband and wife duo: Morris and Rose Michtom. Morris immigrated from Russia to America in the late 1800s, where his day job was selling candy in a New York City neighborhood. By nightfall Morris and Rose, inspired by Teddy Roosevelt’s outdoor adventures, created the first teddy bear in their modest apartment. Morris sent the prototype to Roosevelt, got permission to use his name in 1902, and five years later the Ideal Novelty and Toy Company was born.\n\n“Everything in life I share, except of course my teddy bear!” – Unknown\n\nLet’s take a moment to let that sink in. Two people, who were at this point mere hobbyists, wrote to the President of the United States asking for licensing rights for an idea. When you think about that today it seems completely far-fetched. Surely in today’s busy world an aide would have sent along a pre-written response and filed the well-intentioned letter (and gift) away. But nope, Teddy himself gave the green light! Makes you have a new appreciation for teddy bears, dreams, and Shark Tank – doesn’t it?!\n\nWhat’s even more extraordinary is that this initial brush with success would not be their first. Morris and Rose understood marketing and branding in a time when that concept was just coming to fruition. They partnered with national companies, publications, and celebrities, offering innovative toys and dolls to an adoring public. The Shirley Temple and Judy Garland dolls were instant hits. But for the doll collecting enthusiast Betsy Wetsy, made in 1934, takes the prize. (And you guessed it, Betsy well – made wetsy – after water was poured in her mouth. But what you may not have known is that Miss Betsy was also one of the first mass-produced dolls with an African American counterpart).\n\nAs mentioned above, the distinctive quality of an Ideal doll wasn’t just that it was trending, but that it was coupled with the cutting edge of technology. Let’s not forget we’re in the early 1900s. Dolls of this era were breakable – fragile. But Rose and Morris invested in plastic and had the first “unbreakable” doll in the industry. Young girls could now play with all the vigor and enthusiasm they could muster. Dare we wager that this paved the way for some more fearless women? Maybe a stretch, yes, but the nature of play and our future selves is an interesting discussion.\n\n“Our whole life is solving puzzles.” – Erno Rubik"
