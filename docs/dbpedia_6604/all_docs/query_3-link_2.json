        "text": "Lots of little blurbs today\n\nFirst up, before I get to the normal stuff... IT'S MY BIRTHDAY WOOT!!!\n\nHad a small pool party this past weekend with family and best friend. Having lots of good food to celebrate and otherwise trying to relax a bit. Good times.\n\nNightfall\n\nIn case you've missed the announcements, the iOS Nightfall (2012) version has been on sale for 99Â¢ as the release of iOS Martial Law approaches.\n\nNightfall: Eternal Darkness (base game and Nightfall: Martial Law combined) is for sale. Cheapest I've seen it so far is on Boards & Bits for $32.49.\n\nPlaytesting for NF7 is coming along great. We've finished testing it against previous sets and are now starting to mix several sets at once to see how well things mix together. Feeling pretty happy with the overall balance.\n\nAlso completed some more work on my prototype for a card creator website. Looking quite good imo and will have it posted for all to tinker with in the near future.\n\nVideo Games\n\nGuild Wars 2 beta weekend event #3 was a blast. Ended up playing mostly Asura (though I did run through the Sylvari character creation and the first few levels). Had some epic encounters and nabbed a couple great screenshots:\n\nOverlooking Metrica Province\n\nFighting a huge overly powerful fire elemental\n\nMy Sylvari character that I plan to main\n\nWith my guild Bound by Nails [BbN] starting back up, I've been looking into more options for the members. My latest VOIP service of choice has been Mumble. I've been running the server software on my personal PC so far, but will want something more dedicated to the task whenever it is that I open up access to the entire guild. I asked around on Reddit about my options and got some great answers. Seems like if I want to manage things on my own that I'll need a VPS and just so happens that Amazon's free tier can handle the job for up to 100 users. In addition to a VOIP service I've also decided against setting up a guild forum and instead am opting for a subreddit aka /r/BoundbyNails. For something the size of a small-medium guild this should do basically all the same things while remaining free and can support quite a bit of various content.\n\nOne of the Guild Wars 2 focused shows that I watch is Tales of Tyria and in there latest episode Freelancer from Team Legacy went over one of his strategies for manipulating gaming markets to obtain a great deal of profit. For those interested, here's a spreadsheet of his market example and of course the actual video:\n\nAlso in the video gaming genre, I've been playing a bit of League of Legends lately (I'm S3rvant if you wanna group up). So far I've only gotten to level 7 playing coop vs AI and have been focusing on Ryze, but it's been great fun. Really wish I could find a good way to obtain riot points without needing to spend cash though... the gem market in Guild Wars 2 has me spoiled... So, back to Ryze: did some calculations based on how well he's boosted from mana and ability power and came up with the following item build order:\n\nName Cost\n\n---------------------------\n\nSapphire Crstyal $400\n\nMeki Pendant $390\n\nTear of the Goddess $205\n\nBoots of Speed $350\n\nSapphire Crstyal $400\n\nSorcerer's Shoes $750\n\nAmplifying Tome $435\n\nChain Vest $700\n\nGlacial Shroud $425\n\nBlasting Wand $860\n\nArchangel's Staff $1,000\n\nBlasting Wand $860\n\nNeedlessly Large Rod $1,600\n\nRabadon's Deathcap $1,140\n\nCloth Armor $300\n\nCloth Armor $300\n\nFrozen Heart $650\n\nBlasting Wand $860\n\nVoid Staff $1,000\n\nAmplifying Tome $435\n\nSapphire Crystal $400\n\nSheen $425\n\nBlasting Wand $860\n\nNull-Magic Mantle $400\n\nLich Bane $950\n\n---------------------------\n\nTotal $16,095\n\nWhile I know that in real matches you have to adjust your build strategy on the fly I still like to have a good plan going in and am frequently able to get down to Sheen, though I've yet to make it to Lich Bane. I can say that with this build Ryze has some tankiness about him late game and can burst down most enemy champions that he encounters (I went 13/6/6 in my last game). Tis much fun.\n\nJust in Time\n\nIdeas for this one are starting to float around in my head again. Might be time to gather up the gaming group and get back to work! Most of the tweaks I'm come up reduce fiddliness and a couple I think just make it work better overall. Here's the list:\n\n1. Instead of shifting the entire timeline backward at the end of each turn, just shift the players forward... no clue why I never thought of this before, it's so much easier to actually do.\n\n2. Instead of buildings starting off with expensive effects and needing to be upgraded to offer a discount on their effects, the buildings will start free and be damaged by new events, increasing the cost to use the ability. This solves two problems for me: removes fiddly gain of disc from upgrading as now it makes since to gain a reward when you fix damage and before having everything getting cheaper over the course of the game during the cities impending doom felt kinda immersion breaking, so having things getting more expensive feels a lot better. I'm also thinking that a fully damaged building can't be used at all, forcing you to either abandon using it or invest an action repairing it first, with smaller buildings being easier to reach this point. Damage repair will most likely be \"up to two per action point\".\n\n3. Once the last event has been placed in the timeline, the game moves to a sudden death state as time-space attempts to restore itself. Instead of only moving your own color-coded events down a slot in the timeline, now all events move down a slot, meaning the game will end in a furious rush to prevent a last minute defeat for the players. While I'll have to be careful with balancing the sudden death (don't want it to be too hard), I think it will do a great job of getting rid of the boring last few turns from before.\n\n4. I'm considering adding tiles that cause additional effects ala Castle Panic such as: draw more events, shift all of the current player's events down an additional slot, damage every building adjacent to the current player, etc. Might not need this with the reversal of building damage, but it's something that I plan to implement if needed to keep the pressure up during the mid-late game.\n\n5. I'm also thinking about swapping out all the chipboard bits for cards. Since the timeline will be stationary now, I don't need super sturdy event tiles while shifting things around and mini-cards such as those used in Ninjato may work out really well (and would give me more options for setting up the game such as having two stacks: one for locations and another for event type). I'm still debating what I want to do about the location tiles. I like having a modular board, but as-is you can have broken setups when all of the most powerful locations end up next to each other. I think I'm either going to have to move to a static board (which means better artwork for the board in the end) or semi-modular by having different backs on the location cards that match up with certain places around the board allowing me to force the powerful locations to be spread apart.\n\n[+] Dice rolls"
