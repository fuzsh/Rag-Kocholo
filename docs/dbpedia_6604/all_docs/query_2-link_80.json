        "text": "MetaZoo Games introduced its second Kickstarter campaign on January 31, 2022.\n\nInitially partnered with USPCC, but due to the inability to deliver what was necessary, and later finalized and printed by Faded Spade, the Kickstarter campaign was also partnered with World Poker Tour (WPT), and Chipco; who was responsible for producing the MetaZoo poker chips set.\n\nThe MetaZoo Kickstarter campaign was successfully funded and officially ended on February 25, 2022. It was backed by 5,336 people, with a total funding of $1,857,777.\n\nThe Playing Cards & Promo Cards\n\nThere was a playing card deck made for the Cryptid Nation, Nightfall, and Wilderness MetaZoo trading card game sets (seen above). Each playing card deck came with a ‘… Playing Poker’ promo card.\n\nEvery playing card deck comes with 1x full-holo variant at random. This full-holo card is not in addition to a full deck of cards; it is a part of it.\n\nExclusive Arch Caster & Headcaster Promos:\n\nThose who backed the Kickstarter at a high enough level; that being Arch Caster or Headcaster, received a corresponding ‘…Poker Night’ promo card.\n\nArch Caster Poker Night promos are serialized out of 1,000.\n\nHeadcaster Poker Night promos are serialized out of 250.\n\nPlaying Card Edge Gilding:\n\nFor a small amount more, backers could vouch for their playing cards to receive gilding, seen above on the edges of the cards.\n\nBackers who chose this option also had to wait several weeks more to receive their Kickstarter pledges. They look incredible. Non-gilded card edges are white.\n\nThe Playing Cards Uncut Sheets\n\nCryptid Nation:\n\nNightfall:\n\nWilderness:\n\nThere were a total of between 250-500 of each set (seen above) made available.\n\nSome were sent to backers at random for no added cost. The rest were made available for purchase by backers as an add-on for ~$50 each.\n\nRare Faded Spade Full-Holo Variants\n\nThere are a very limited number of full-holo variants (seen above) for each set. 50 for Cryptid Nation, 50 for Nightfall, and 50 for Wilderness. They were distributed out to buyers at random.\n\nThe holo seen above is an exact representation of the 1x Faded Spade full-holo that is included in every playing card pack at random.\n\nSuper Rare MetaZoo Full-Holo Playing Cards\n\nThese beauties (seen above) were only given out to those who were forced to wait several additional months for their WPT x Kickstarter product to arrive due to issues in the printing process.\n\nThese were printed by MetaZoo Games in-house instead. Only 1x full-holo card is included in each playing card deck. The rest of the cards in the deck are not full-holo as seen above.\n\nAll of the cards have exclusive rainbow gilded edges as seen above.\n\nTo our knowledge, there were no uncut sheets of these MetaZoo variant full-holo cards, unfortunately.\n\nThe WPT Trading Card Game Mini Set\n\nThere are a total of 12 different cards in the World Poker Tour x Kickstarter mini set. It features popular beasties from MetaZoo Games’ first 3 main sets; Cryptid Nation, Nightfall & Wilderness.\n\nEach box comes with 10x booster packs that contain 1x card per.\n\nThe WPT Trading Card Game Uncut Sheet\n\nThere were a total of 2,000 of these made available for purchase, at a price of $50 a piece.\n\nMetaZoo Games founder Mike Waddell signed 100 of them at random.\n\nThe Chipco Poker Chips Set\n\nThe poker chips set features an array of colors and beasties on $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $25, $50, $100 & $250 chips. There are a total of 100 chips in the box set.\n\nThe poker chips set was a $200 add-on.\n\nKickstarter-Backer Exclusive Poker Chips\n\nThese are the three chips that were given out to backers of the Kickstarter campaign. Depending on what level that was backed, backers would receive a corresponding chip free of charge.\n\nThose who backed the WPT x Faded Spade Kickstarter at any level received a Bounty poker chip. Those who backed at the Arch Caster level received a silver $500 chip (1,000 chips total). And those who were able to back at the highest level; Headcaster, received the gold $1,000 chip (200 chips total). These were also manufactured by Chipco.\n\nThe Artist Prints\n\nThere were artist prints (seen above) available for $50, where a portion of proceeds would go directly to the artists.\n\nThere were several hundred of these available for sale.\n\nExclusive 1-of-1 Artwork\n\nThere were also 1-of-1’s (seen above) that were sent directly to MetaZoo Games by the official MetaZoo Games artists to be used on these playing cards and other products in this Kickstarter. These are the originals, and were selling for $5,000 each.\n\nThere were a total of 25 original artworks available for purchase. They were all face cards (King, Queen, etc.). The remaining original artworks were given away for free to backers of the campaign; with 42 going to Headcasters, 42 to Arch Caster, and 42 to Master Caster backers.\n\nKickstarter-Exclusive Playmat\n\nThere were a total of 1,000 of these Kickstarter playmats available for sale, at a price of $25 each.\n\nMore MetaZoo Kickstarters to Come!"
