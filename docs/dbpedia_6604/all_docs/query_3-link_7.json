        "text": "In recent years there has been a clear evolutionary path being formed within game consoles and where they are headed in the future. This being the digital next generation of consoles, hosted by the PS5 and Xbox Series S but more so from Google Stadia. Are these consoles paving the way for the future? Well, this is what I am here to discuss.\n\nStadia is Google’s own gaming platform, released in November 2019, that allows you to play video games on devices that you already own by streaming them through the cloud.\n\nWith Stadia, a relief to many gaming fans is there is no need for downloads, which has always been the bane of existence for most gamers. As some game’s updates, never mind the game itself, can be a few GB big and depending on your connection speed can take a couple of hours to complete, just to play a game that you already own. Although, if connection speeds are something that limits you, Stadia is not necessarily going to be the best bet for a good gaming experience for you, which I talk about a bit further on.\n\nVarious players that have multiple consoles such as one Xbox and one Playstation have always found themselves tussling with which console to buy a game on or sometimes buying it on both. However, with Stadia, you only need to purchase games once as it is just one save file in the cloud. This saves you from having to worry about buying games more than once to play them on multiple machines and having to pay double the cost of the already high prices.\n\nThe cost-to-portability ratio is brilliant with Stadia, as you can take it wherever you want, plug in your controller, and get playing. You do not need to fork out the cost of a console for a few hundred pounds and pay a monthly subscription to get access to games or buy your own. However, there is a lack of AAA titles included within Stadia Pro, but some good games to pick up and play, nonetheless.\n\nWith each gamer having a preference as to how they play games it is a nice addition from the team at Google to allow you to be able to use other controllers or keyboard and mouse on PC to play the games. As small of a feature as this may seem, it means that they are hitting as much of a demographic as possible in terms of people that will want to play on Stadia.\n\nWith the introduction of 5G in some countries and the fact they have opened Stadia users up to use mobile data, connection speeds are not so much an issue as 5G average speeds are around 150Mbps-200Mbps. Having said that and how amazing the newest mobile data speeds are, you could easily be chewing through around 2.7GB of your data an hour, so if you are looking to play constantly on the move upgrading your data package may have to be a part of the investment. However, not all countries are fortunate enough to get these incredible speeds and may struggle to game on the move because of it.\n\nI have done some looking around to get an overall view of what people are saying about the gameplay quality of the Stadia to get a general opinion. There are varying reviews on the quality of gameplay with some reporting lagging and stuttering. However, this can be down to the network connection that you have and where you are as there are other players who have absolutely no complaints about the quality of the games which they are playing. It is evident that the experience you have from Stadia, all depends on the speeds you can achieve on your network. With poor speeds, you are more than likely going to have a poor experience. Whereas with a standalone console, how good your game looks and runs does not depend on the speed of your internet connection.\n\nHowever, don’t be fooled by the 4K 60fps quality as if you are wanting that, you are going to have to pay extra. This then brings me onto the pricing model, which is lacking in some ways. The fact you have to pay £8.99 a month just to be able to play in better quality is quite baffling to me. You do however get free games with Stadia Pro, but they are thin in numbers and arguably exciting games to be paying for when you compare it to the Xbox Game Pass. As well, the Xbox game pass currently allows streaming games on mobile devices, just not to PC or consoles yet. So, you can get a better range of games and portability on your phone for the price of the Xbox game pass. Sony, however, is yet to hit the ground running with their Playstation Now only eligible to stream to consoles, unless you use their Playstation remote, which from my own experience was full of lag and not the smoothest of experiences. If you are looking to play pretty much any AAA titles on the Stadia, you are looking at shelling out the full retail price for them still.\n\nIf you are a visual advocate, the visible quality is seemingly not up to scratch with a gaming PC or the two most recent generations of consoles. Which you can kind of expect as consoles are specifically designed for playing games at a high quality whereas your old Laptops were most likely not designed to serve that purpose. The newest consoles have the ability to run games now with ray tracing which is a feature that Stadia does not have and anyone who truly wants the best-looking experience may shy away from the thought of a Stadia for this reason.\n\nThere is, unfortunately, a lack of a community due to the fact nothing is really pushing people to buy it, at least it has not for me and many people I know. And a lack of community means that multiplayer games become harder to play and can see a rapid decrease in an overall player base as in games like Destiny, a lack of a fireteam to encounter the weekly Nightfall is going to make it incredibly tough to complete. Although, the idea of being able to have your Stadia, take it anywhere and plug it in and hop into an online game with your friends is something that a few years ago we would never have expected, especially with how portable the Stadia is.\n\nA portion of the overall downfall of Stadia comes from the marketing techniques used to sell it. As Stadia was advertised as ready to go and got everybody excited for the future but is in fact pretty much just beta technology. However, a massive disappointment to the gaming community is that Google has now shut down its in-house game development studios. For the future of cloud-based gaming and Stadia itself, it is sad to see them shut these studios down, and maybe they were not as serious as they once seemed with their intentions to grow in the gaming market.\n\nNow whilst it sounds like all I have to say is bad things about Stadia, if we are not critical of these new, exciting things how are other companies meant to progress from this point and fit the consumer's wants and needs? We do not want to sit back and just let something as compelling as playing games on any device to flatline when it has so much potential. I, for one, am a massive fan of the concept of Stadia and the path it has now opened with other company’s looking to bring competition to the table. With a big competition being seen in Amazon's own cloud-based gaming platform, Luna. If Amazon put in the investment to Luna and the games library aspect, it could be a real home run compared to the Stadia. This also relies on the hope of the technology itself being able to work smoothly. And we all know the competition is what pushes companies to do better and make their products more enjoyable for us, the players. Maybe, not too far into the future, we will see more companies reaching into this exact market.\n\nWe have already begun to see this shift in the idea of a console, with the very first digital generation of each of the Playstation and Xbox being released last year. At the moment, with how the world is in terms of technology, there is no way it would be feasible for Sony and Microsoft to take their consoles to digital-only as they would lose a massive portion of their consumers that cannot reek the benefits of a digital-only console. This is why having an option of both is great for them as there are positives to purchasing either the digital or non-digital version of the consoles.\n\nThe approach that Sony and Microsoft have taken with their digital consoles is not the same as how Stadia works, as these consoles still download the game to console as you were always able to do, whereas Stadia streams the games directly online. However, these consoles are cheaper for people to buy than the disc version of themselves, and in the case of the PS5, it has the same power behind it as the disc version too. Also, with such a large target market already, they will not want to sacrifice such a large risk of losing so many customers just to have a completely Stadia-like console on the market just yet. This being because they would simply, as a business, lose too much money if it did not go to plan.\n\nThis being said, as the technology around the world catches up and more countries are known to have internet connections capable of handling such a task, I believe that in due course we will see the release of streamed digital consoles from the Powerhouses in the console market. I am enraptured by the thought that in just a few years we could be taking our big bulky consoles down to portable machines that we can take almost anywhere with us and game on the go."
