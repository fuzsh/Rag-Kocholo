        "text": "About the Society\n\nWho we are\n\nThe Nightfall Society is a live action roleplay club based in Berkshire, running regular indoor events in Reading. Our events are based in White Wolf's World of Darkness game setting, a world in which a secret world underlying our own is the battleground and political arena of supernatural beings using it for their own aims.\n\nWhat is LARP/LRP?\n\nLive Action Roleplay (LARP), sometimes known as Live Roleplay (LRP), is an expanding hobby in which players take on character roles in a particular world setting, with a storyline and plot provided by the game's storytellers (STs).\n\nPlayers act out their characters as part of a group, creating a form of free-form improvisational theatre done for the enjoyment of the player group rather than an audience. They live out their character's life, pursuing their goals and dealing with threats both from other players and storyteller-run non-player characters (NPCs) as they engage with other players to interweave a larger story.\n\nClub Background\n\nThe group was founded by Scott Carmichael at the beginning of 2014, originally running as a vampire game with a small group of around ten players in Newbury. Over following years it expanded out to include further games across two physical sites, as well as online games on IRC and more recently Discord. Yearly elections are held for the Committee and Storyteller roles.\n\nThe society now has a membership of around 30 players and now runs one game day each month, consisting of separate afternoon and evening games. We run out of a private hire venue in Reading, which has its own private car park and is a 15-minute walk from Reading Station, as well as about 5-10 minutes walk from a wide selection of restaurants and take-aways for before and between games.\n\nMembership\n\nOur membership consists of a variety of ages, genders, and experience, and we are always happy to welcome new attendees, whether they are veteran roleplayers or attending their first ever game.\n\nThere are always a number of longer-term players and storytellers on hand to help new members learn how the games work, how to create a character and join in, and offer ongoing assistance and guidance at request. Many players are also happy to create background links with their own characters to help new players engage with the game on their arrival."
