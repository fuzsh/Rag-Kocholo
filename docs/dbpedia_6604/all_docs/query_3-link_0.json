        "text": "Besides possessing an incredibly cool name, Kiki Wolfkill is one of the most important women in games. Executive Producer at 343 Industries, she oversees the enduringly popular sci-fi shooter series Halo, and generates its expansion into other media.\n\nWolfkill speaks with WIRED.co.uk on getting more women working in the games field, the evolution of Halo as a franchise, and the launch of Nightfall, the latest live-action show that debuted this week as part of Halo: The Master Chief Collection.\n\n**WIRED.co.uk: As an executive producer on Halo, you're one of the most prominent women in the games industry today.\n\nWhat's your take on things like the Gamergate situation?**\n\nThat's been an interesting thing to watch develop. Rather than comment specifically on Gamergate I would say that we are all trying to work to make gaming more inclusive from a development perspective. We do a lot of work to get more women into game development, programming, science and technology. And we will continue to do that. The more women we have in games development, the more creative we are with making our games more approachable.\n\nIs Halo still defined by its macho identity, or has that changed over the years?\n\nSci-fi properties are actually fairly gender-balanced in terms of people who are interested in them. Halo has always had an audience that includes a lot of women. I think we've always tried with our storytelling in this universe that it be something all people can enjoy. Some people perceive the first-person shooter genre as macho, but Halo as a sci-fi universe has cross-gender draw.\n\nHalo 5's multiplayer beta is launching alongside the Master Chief Collection. How far along would you say you are with the core game?\n\nIt is early days. It is still a beta, but it's solid. The team have been working really hard coming out of Halo 4 so all the systems are there and they're really strong.\n\nYou came onto the Halo franchise when 343 Industries was set up. How have things changed since the franchise changed hands from Bungie?\n\nI think the IP has continued to evolve and we had such a nice opportunity when we were formed to really take our time to step back and think about where we wanted it to go. We had the breathing room to have a long-term plan around the storytelling in the game.\n\nIt was a luxury that really let us be certain about what we were going to do and not going to do.\n\nThe game will always the passion of the people behind it. One of the nice things about putting together a new studio is you get to have different people with different creative perspectives looking at the game. We've started doing a lot more storytelling outside of the games and connecting it with storytelling inside the game. I think that reflects a lot of personal pride we have in our work and how we feel about entertainment.\n\n**How deeply was Ridley Scott involved in the\n\nNightfall project?**\n\nWe had quite a few early meetings to see if the Halo universe was a place he wanted to play in. As executive producer he was involved in some high-level decisions from very early on in the production process, things like where we ended up shooting.\n\nObviously he had a lot of experience with that stuff and that was invaluable for us. He also helped up with production partners and who to work with -- he definitely weighed in on those decisions.\n\nWith the first episode out now, has the response been what you hoped?\n\nYeah! You know, we had a screening in London and one in Los Angeles and the response was great. It was kind of difficult to have just ninety minutes to lay out the groundwork of the characters, the setting, the context in the Halo universe and still tell a great action story. It was important to set context first so we could then let the story play itself out with this great sci-fi action story. But there was some foundation we needed to lay first. It builds up some momentum to get you into the story. I think it's a really intense action drama with some great character interaction, so on the whole I think it's very encouraging.\n\nHalo Nightfall is the only scripted show to make it out of Xbox Entertainment Studios before it closed. How has that affected future plans?\n\nObviously we were very sad to see them close. We still work with some of the people we worked with to finish up\n\nNightfall. We've always had plans around the TV series and expanding the universe lore -- 343 has always owned the entirety of the Halo business and we'll carry on with our plans.\n\nIs there potential for Nightfall to continue, or will the separate Halo TV series coming next year take its place?\n\nWe definitely established Nightfall as a standalone story. Part of that was establishing the characters, including Locke [who is playable in Halo 5]. There will always be things with characters that can live beyond the story. Nightfall was designed as an episodic thing. That said, it's very different from what we're planning on doing with the TV series. The digital approach really lets us play with the format, like the length of the episodes or interactivity with the channel. We can experiment with those things and craft storytelling around it. That gives us freedom to play and build on that in future.\n\n**The last live-action Halo series, Forward Unto Dawn, was delivered to viewers through the Halo Waypoint, and Nightfall is linked to the new\n\nHalo Channel. Have the shows helped evolve those platforms?**\n\nSo, the Halo Channel that we launched yesterday is available on Xbox One and Windows 8. We'll expand it onto Windows Phone in the future. [Compared to Waypoint] we really look at Halo Channel as a very entertainment-focussed thing, delivering content as well as being able to move in and out of game experiences. You'll also be able to see a variety of content like Twitch content and the games themselves, to create an environment that really feels interactive and lets you feel like all of these pieces of code have been brought together.\n\nThis article was originally published by WIRED UK"
