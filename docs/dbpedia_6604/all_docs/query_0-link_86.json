        "text": "This article covers logos that contain sexual activity, and strong language.\n\nThey are hidden behind spoilers.\n\nThis article is about the German warez group. For the Russian pirate video game publisher, see Paradox (Russia).\n\nBackground\n\nParadox is a warez group that performs software cracking on multiple video game consoles. The company was formed in 1989 by members of the groups Trilogy and M.A.D. Initially, the cracked Amiga software before shutting down in 1991 when the members joined Quartex. However, the group was revived in 1993 under Maximilien's leadership. There, they cracked Sega Genesis, SNES, and PC software. Over the next several years, they are known for cracking software hard to crack such as releasing an up-to-date crack of Monster Hunter World: Iceborne. They were also involved in several raids and arrests with some members getting arrested for financial security reasons.\n\n1st Logo (1988-June 22, 1990)\n\nVisuals: On a black background, \"PARADOX\" in a futuristic font fades in and turns from white to royal blue. Then, there is scrolling text underneath. Sometimes, the text stops to show certain text such as the game name. Simultaneously, white particles are seen bursting, spilling, and floating around in the background.\n\nVariants: Depending on the game, the scrolling text reads differently:\n\nDynasty Wars:\n\nHELLO EVERYONE!!!
