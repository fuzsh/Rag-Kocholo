        "text": "Terminator\n\nFrom Nightfall Studios, who brought the world of Terminator to roleplaying games in 2020, we have the newest expansion – Terminator 2: Judgement Day.\n\nIn the first installment of the RPG players battled T-800s as members of The Resistance, but now a new threat looms as Skynet unleashes the T-1000s, shapeshifting liquid metal constructs to find and eliminate Sarah Connor, her son John, and any hope for the future of mankind. This newest addition to The Terminator line of RPGs expands the threats players face as well as gives new options with playable T-800s.\n\nThis 200-page sourcebook offers new rules for hacking, leaping through time, and an opportunity through a mission pack to play through the events of the movie to the game table. Keeping a deep focus on the tone of the movies, the Nightfall Games team strives to immerse players into the action and terror of technology run rampant that the original James Cameron film introduced us all to in the 1990s. Kickstarter stretch goals offer opportunities to catch glimpses of other areas of the world and how they are dealing with the threat of Skynet.\n\nThe Terminator RPG is built using Nightfall Games S5S game system, introduced in the award-winning SLA Industries 2nd Edition. A d10-based rules system, built with cinematic emphasis, the S5S is modified for the setting, giving players an opportunity to explore the tension and dangers of contending with unstoppable killing machines with “unique skills and training.”\n\nThe Kickstarter is presently live with a variety of add-ons, including options for picking up the original The Terminator RPG, metal dice, and tin and travel dice tray. While we haven’t gotten a chance to do a full review of The Terminator RPG or Terminator 2: Judgement Day, Nightfall Games is known for quality action-packed products. At Aggrogamer we are looking forward to the success of The Terminator RPG’s newest expansion and the hopeful release of The StokerVerse RPG.\n\nIt should have ended with the destruction of the T-800. The future was saved, or was it? Did we just delay the inevitable? Did we fail? Perhaps there’s no fate but what we make.\n\nIn ‘The Terminator RPG’, you were The Resistance, fighters struggling against Terminators sent back in time to ensure the rise of the nuclear singularity. But it’s all different now. In the ‘Terminator 2’ movie, the resistance has grown bolder and the battle lines between humanity and the machines got blurred. Now the Resistance is reprogramming T-800s and sending them back to guard key assets. But Skynet is not prepared to go quietly into the night and with new advances in polymimetic alloy, is ever-evolving its arsenal and its strategies. Will humanity be able to stop its ascension or will it triumph in a Judgment Day more thoroughly than ever imagined.\n\nThe ‘Terminator 2: Judgement Day’ sourcebook features 200 pages of all new content including:\n\nT-1000s and an all-new, never seen before Terminator variant and hardware.\n\nPlayable Terminators reprogrammed to fight for the Human Resistance – just like in the T2 movie. Machine fighting machine.\n\nThe Time Displacement Commandos (TDC), the Resistance’s elite troops sent backward and forward in time to disrupt Skynet’s plans through time.\n\nEnter the 1990s, those critical 7 years before the hammer falls on humanity. The last chance to stop the development of Skynet.\n\nPlay in any time zone – including the 1980s and future war.\n\nFace the challenges of the Future War, whether they be mechanical, animal, human, microbial, chemical, hybrid, or liquid metal.\n\nFeaturing all the main characters from the movie, such as Sarah Connor, Kyle Reese, Miles Dyson, and the T-800 “Uncle Bob” – providing a wealth of new playable options and all new NPCs,\n\nAdvanced hacking rules\n\nThe rulebook includes the mission pack, enabling you to relive the ‘Terminator 2: Judgment Day’ movie and to join the fight to bring down Skynet in a not-so-distant future war."
