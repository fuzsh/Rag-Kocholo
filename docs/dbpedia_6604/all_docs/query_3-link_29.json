        "text": "Although the expression “halo effect” was coined long before video games or video game systems were invented, Microsoft is hoping for a Halo effect during this frenetic, competitive Christmas shopping season.\n\nMicrosoft will release on Tuesday a special compilation of its popular Halo video game franchise for the Xbox One video game system. The compilation, called Halo: The Master Chief Collection, offers versions of the four Halo video games remastered in high definition along with additional content that includes the Halo: Nightfall series of videos and access to a multiplayer beta version of Halo 5: Guardians, scheduled for release late next year.\n\nThe collection, which retailers like Best Buy and Toys “R” Us are selling this week for $59.99, is the subject of a marketing campaign that rivals the promotion of a major motion picture — not surprising because the sequels to the original Halo helped bring the movie blockbuster approach to the video game industry. There is even a phrase on the package that is evocative of Hollywood hoopla: “For the first time ever, the Master Chief’s entire saga on one console.” (The games are Halo: Combat Evolved, Halo 2: Anniversary, Halo 3 and Halo 4.)\n\nFive agencies are working on the elements of the campaign, which include commercials, print ads, online ads, a public relations effort, outdoor ads, events and content on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter.\n\nMicrosoft typically concentrates its ad spending for Xbox One and the other Xbox products in the fourth quarter, to stimulate holiday spending and keep up with rivals, most notably the PlayStation 4 video game system from Sony.\n\nFor instance, in the fourth quarter last year, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP, Xbox ad spending totaled $38 million, compared with $41.8 million for all of 2013. Similarly, Xbox ad spending in the fourth quarter of 2012 totaled $31.4 million, Kantar Media reported, compared with $34 million for all of 2012.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
