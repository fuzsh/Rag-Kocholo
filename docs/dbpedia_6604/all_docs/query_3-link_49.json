        "text": "Chella Ramanan, European Correspondent\n\nChella hails from the UK and joined Gameindustry.com around the year 2000. It was so many moons ago, she can't quite remember. Back then, the only women you saw in the games industry were in bikinis and vertiginous heels at trade shows - oh how times have changed, kind of. Chella started as a humble reviewer, but soon became our European Correspondent and keeps us on top of industry happenings across the Pond. She tends to like the weird Japanese games we've never heard of, so that's good for making us look all-encompassing and stuff. Chella does like games, so don't be fooled by the copious amount of columns devoted to bemoaning the lack of variety in the industry. When she's not surfing (the sea, not the internet) or camping up mountains, Chella likes a good action RPG (especially if it's sci-fi), anything with a good narrative and like we said, the weirder the better. She's also a regular in the GiN Lounge, but that's just because we like her accent.\n\nRecent Posts\n\nMost Anticipated Games of 2015\n\nThe year 2015 promises a bumper crop of next gen games from AAA studios and indie developers alike, offering something for everyone.

Despite some crashing lows, there were some high points to celebrate. Read on and I’ll give you a rip-roaring overview of the gaming year that was 2014. The Lows: Watch Dogs Watch Dogs had been on my most anticipated list for what seemed like years.

But before I could buy it, Monument Valley hit the headlines again, because it was bombarded with one-star reviews from gamers who took exception to paying for the expansion. I coughed up some cash and played Monument Valley over the weekend to see if it was worth it.
