        "text": "This weekend I went to an event at the Outpost in Sheffield. Handy, because its only a half hour drive. There were 12 players, about half locals, and we were doing premier format. I had been on holiday for the 2 weeks before the event so I hadn’t painted any new models so just decided […]\n\nSo we (fluff n crunch) were sent sent a review copy of Star Trek Adventures new 2e rulebook. So Why not get twice the content out of it I thought! I don’t do a lot of reviews on here, but probably should. Probably because they’re time consuming and not great content. It’s just my opinion. […]\n\nSo at the weekend I went to the Sheffield GT for Shatterpoint. I was pretty dubious about this event. Non-refundable tickets unless you paid more. Different ticket prices depending on when you bought them. no idea how many people were going. Advertised as 6 rounds for 32 players, except 32 players only needs 5 rounds […]\n\nOn our podcast we talk about system, setting and story. And often I look at system over story and Jeremy is the other way inclined. But there’s a particular instance where maybe we both struggle. Narrative games! Mostly we play more crunchy games. 2d20, Dnd, Year zero etc. We don’t tend to play things like […]\n\nSo I started work on my own system. I wrote out a bunch of characters from various IP I wanted to be able to make. Then I started coming up with core mechanic ideas. I had a long list (up to 7 at one point). All of the ideas revolved around dice pools of different […]\n\n(Disclaimer – I wrote this In Arpil but didn’t finish it, and posted it 2 months later) April 2024. Firstly – there’s been no painting. Just building! So I Had got into 40K lore at the start of 2024 which lead me into the AOS lore, reading some pdfs, reading White Dwarf and listening to […]\n\nI backed ISS Vanguard for a couple of reasons. It’s by the makers of Nemesis which is one of my favourite boardgames, and it kind of seemed like mass effect. When It turned up I took it out of the box, and then put it back in and left it. The box was massive and […]\n\nSo in this blog I came to the conclusion that I don’t have a clearly defined setting idea and might be better off with a generic system. So what kind of setting ideas was I toying with? So Basically low level supers. Characters can be highly skilled or enhanced or have low level magic. Sounds […]\n\nSo having said I wasn’t keen on Shatterpoint (this blog and this blog) I found some local players, played some games (bought some more models) and went to 5 events! So I’ve definitely gone from not liking it to liking it. But how have my games gone and do I need to change my approach? […]\n\nSo this weekend was my last of 3 events in 3 weekends, taking place at Board and Swords in Derby (event Link here). It’s a good location and easy to get to and has v friendly staff. There were 12 players (1 dropped so someone else stepped up to come and play on the day). […]\n\nSo In part 1 I looked at which primaries I wanted to play and narrowed down to 4. In part 2, I changed my mind, tried 4 different models and decided on Maul and Mandos. So Now in Part 3 I need to complete the roster. Starting Point = Maul + Mandos So Primary 1 […]\n\nSo in the last blog I was working on a Roster, and came up with 2 strike teams: Luke and Ahsoka or Cad and Ventress. But before I’d even got to try it I started looking at other models. Namely Mandos and Leia. Mando roster Right now (no Mando in UK), the Mandos want primaries […]\n\nI would often do these posts for MCP. It’s helpful to write-down the thought process that build’s a roster. How did I build my last rosters? So the UKGE roster was really about playing what was going to get me badges. I had 4 games with Vader1, Talzin and Maul and 2 games with hunter […]\n\nAnother weekend, another Shatterpoint event (and there’s another one next weekend as well). This one was at Element Games (stockport) and hosted by Ged. Of the 5 Shatterpoint events I’ve now been to, 3 have been at EG! Longshanks link here. So having Managed to get to my 5th game with Hunter, Maul, Talzin and […]\n\nSo for the first time in my 7 or so years of attending Games Expo I attended all 3 days. I started just doing Sundays with Mika and Anny. Then many years me and Anny have done 2 days and Mika has joined us Sunday, but I’ve never done all 3. But this year I […]\n\nSo as part of Games Expo (write-up here)this year I decided to go to an event on the Saturday and there was a Shatterpoint event running. Annoyingly it was 2 days. 3 games on Saturday and 1 on Sunday with 2 more games for the top 4. I thought I might just play 3 games […]\n\nRules are here, explanations here The main two things I want to go back to would be – did it do what I wanted on paper AND did it work as intended in play. Lets look back to an old article where I gave requirements for a LOL RPG to play, 7 months before I […]\n\nRules are here I thought it was a good idea to show the NPCs. First up some heroes: So Gwen has very good powers and is ok defensively but poor offensively outside of powers Vayne is a rare level 6 character. She’s very good in combat, especially against the right enemies Lucien was interesting because […]\n\nSo the rules for CARPG are here. They are very Vague. Having written them 2 years ago its hard to remember what they are doing! So they need some explanation but also an insight into where the rules come from. I’ve covered attempts at LOL RPGs before here and here and here and finally here! […]\n\n2 years ago I needed a system to run League of Legends and I wrote my own system. It was designed to be quick and player facing, so all rolls were made by the player. It was intended to run a League of Legends story, specifically ruination. And we were planning to play this in […]"
