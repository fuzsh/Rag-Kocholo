Gaska\n\nA multiple award-winning game-writer, author, designer, and graphic novelist with twenty years of industry experience, Gaska is the creative force behind BLAM! Ventures studio. He has worked as a freelance consultant for both 20th Century Studios and Rockstar Games. The lead writer of Free League Publishing’s ALIEN Role Playing Game and Nightfall Games’ The Terminator RPG line, he is also the creative director of the Planet of the Apes RPGs from Magnetic Press Play. Gaska has written two novels for Planet of the Apes and co-authored two Choose Your Own Adventure graphic novel adaptations.\n\nTHE CANON OF THE PLANET OF THE APES\n\nAN INFINITE HIGHWAY WITH INFINITE POSSIBILITIES\n\n“Time is like a freeway with an infinite number of lanes, all leading from the past into the future, however, not unto the same future. A driver in lane ‘A’ may crash while a driver in lane ‘B’ survives. It follows that a driver, by changing lanes can change his future…”\n\n—­­Dr. Otto Victor Hasslein, Escape from the Planet of the Apes\n\n“You remember the old motorways? l believe that time is like an endless motorway, with an infinite number of lanes all running from the past into the future. lt follows that a driver would try to change his lanes and change his future. lf you left this room right now, you might wind up shot. Dead. lf you left a minute later, you might survive. It’s a blind choice, but you can change lanes.”\n\n­­—Virgil, Battle for the Planet of the Apes\n\nSOURCES\n\nWith the pre-order now entering its final week on Kickstarter for The Role-Playing Game of the Planet of the Apes, I thought it a good time to post some of the sources I compiled as a freelance franchise consultant for an internal POTA bible at 20th Century Studios circa 2016. These sources and my previous Planet of the Apes novels were then used when setting up the RPG.\n\nCONSPIRACIES\n\nIn 2011 I wrote a now-out-of-print illustrated novel called Conspiracy of the Planet of the Apes. Crafted by my studio BLAM! Ventures and published by Archaia Entertainment, the story was set concurrent with the first film and followed the path of Landon—an astronaut in the movie who was captured at the same time as Charlton Heston’s character, Taylor. The novel revealed that while Cornelius, Zira, and Zaius were dealing with one talking human, characters such as Dr. Milo, General Ursus, and others were dealing with another.\n\nDEATHS\n\nWhile a series of books were planned, only the first one was released before the license ended. The second, Death of the Planet of the Apes, would ultimately be released by Titan Publishing as a 460-page paperback novel in 2018.\n\nCONSULTATIONS\n\nIn December of 2015, I received an unexpected call from the then-new franchise director at 20th Century Studios. He explained that they were compiling an internal POTA bible and were having difficulty figuring out the franchise’s convoluted timeline. He had read my novel, and thought I was knowledgeable enough to be brought in as a franchise consultant.\n\nEXPANSIONS\n\nThe work was freelance, but I was happy to once again officially contribute to a world turned upside down. The job led to me consulting not only on the Planet of the Apes but on Alien and Predator as well.\n\nI worked on various parts of the POTA bible from 2015-2018. When I came on, the decision was made by the department to find a way to make everything fit into a cohesive timeline. That meant an extended universe that included films, novels, comics, games, and more. How could I make that work? I had to take a long hard look at some beloved stories from the franchise and try to figure out how something contradictory could still fit into the canon. If I couldn’t, I was told to recommend it be tossed. I looked for a third option. The theories of Dr. Hasslein and Virgil—quoted at the top of this page—were key to making it work.\n\nINFINITIES\n\nThe chronology I crafted at the behest of 20th Century Studios in 2016 is divided into five key lanes of the highway that is time. These five lanes incorporate all major plot points from the Planet of the Apes movies, television series, animated series, comics, novels, and video games that have been released over the past five decades. Together, they would define the canon of the expanded Classic Planet of the Apes universe.\n\nCAMPFIRE CANON\n\nDone right, RPGs make excellent sourcebooks for an entire franchise. Collating data from several diverse sources into a living, breathing, universe creates a guide for more than not only a role-playing game. Like the old West End Games Star Wars RPG, the Alien RPG books I worked on have since been given to new licensors as a guide when crafting games, comics, and more. The key to making this work was to include as much of everything as possible in a logical way, and transform what didn’t work into rumors, myths, and legends.\n\nSimilar to what has become known as Barroom Canon in the Alien RPG, there is Campfire Canon for POTA. These are stories overheard fireside that may or may not have some truth to them. This allows canon to have some flex in regards to including stories that otherwise could no longer count in a franchise’s development.\n\nUsing this philosophy, some version of every POTA story you’ve ever read has happened in-universe. If it strays too much from established canon by contradicting in-filmed events instead of explaining them, then that version of the story was told over a campfire by a cousin of the ape who overheard two ape soldiers whispering while they rode their horses past his farm. In the end, they become myths, legends, and events that form other timelines.\n\nFUTURES\n\nNew stories told moving forward were to be included within the five lanes of this timeline whenever possible. Anything not incorporated within these lanes was to be considered apocryphal myth, legend, and folklore on the Planet of the Apes. That is, of course, only within these five lanes. As Dr. Hasslein and Virgil’s theories suggest, there are an infinite number of other lanes. The incalculable permutations of these other avenues of time are left to the imagination. This meant that anything could be deemed canon for any of the other infinite number of lanes that make up time—including your role-playing campaign!\n\nI will stress again that this list is a guideline based on my 2015-2018 franchise consultant work at 20th Century Studios. I do not decide canon. Instead, I curate lore for coherency and continuity. Paul Dehn—the man responsible for the scripts and lore of the second through fifth films, said in 1972 that he intended the series as a closed loop. Unfortunately, the numerous contradictions made within the series as well as in subsequent offerings created beyond his involvement make that difficult to reconcile when crafting a viable expanded universe. Thus, when creating the backstory/lore/history of the Role-Playing Game of the Planet of the Apes, I drew upon Dehn’s in-film dialogue for Virgil and Hasslein about time having infinite possibilities (see the quotes at the top of this page).\n\nSeveral fans have asked for the list of what went into the game. It’s okay if my list doesn’t fit your personal headcanon, I am in no way suggesting it should. The game lore is designed to reject what you don’t like and use what you do.\n\nThe notes below about the rebooted film series are guidelines I was given when I was brought on board as a consultant. Remember that canon in any franchise is always fluid—no RPG or novel will stop headlining producers and directors from taking a series in any direction they want to try. In the case of classic POTA, the original film and TV series are long since retired, so it is not likely that will happen. Never say never, however. This list stands only until it doesn’t.\n\nA NOTE ABOUT THE REBOOT SERIES\n\nDespite some fan theories to the contrary, the reboot series is not designed as a prequel to the original films. The earlier films of the new series simply contradict the final three films of the original saga. They may cover similar territory and offer many easter eggs, but they are telling their own story that will lead to their own climax. The separation of franchises was handed to me as a perimeter to follow when I first worked on the POTA Bible for them.\n\nTHE TRUTH ABOUT EASTER EGGS\n\nAs I originally mentioned on my Alien Canon page, Easter Eggs are never an indicator of canon, they are surprise homages and nothing more.\n\nYOUR UNIVERSE\n\nAll that being said, the POTA RPG is a guide to YOUR POTA universe, official or not. Make your game universe your own. What you want in your campaign is absolutely what should be in there, no matter what. As for what I used, this is the list I stick to. It is based on my discussions and work with the Studio as a franchise consultant, and I’ve laid out the setting and whatnot accordingly.\n\nTHE TIERS\n\nAs the creative director, lead writer, and canon consultant on the POTA RPG by Magnetic Press Play, I developed the following Canon Tier guidelines for working out the POTA universe.\n\nTIER I CANON\n\nDefinitive and authorized canon to the first two lanes of the Planet of the Apes timeline:\n\nFilm Series (1968-1973)\n\nPlanet of the Apes\n\nBeneath the Planet of the Apes\n\nEscape from the Planet of the Apes\n\nConquest of the Planet of the Apes Theatrical and/or Director’s Cut\n\nBattle for the Planet of the Apes Theatrical and/or Extended Cut\n\nTIER II CANON\n\nThese sources are absolutely canon for those first two lanes of the Infinite Highway until a producer throws a curveball—unlikely since the classic saga came to a close some five decades ago:\n\nTV Series (Set in the year 3085, some 900 years before Taylor and Landon crash in the first film)\n\nPlanet of the Apes (1974)\n\nEscape from Tomorrow\n\nThe Gladiator\n\nThe Trap\n\nThe Good Seeds\n\nThe Legacy\n\nTomorrow’s Tide\n\nThe Surgeon\n\nThe Deception\n\nThe Horse Race\n\nThe Interrogation\n\nThe Tyrant\n\nThe Cure\n\nThe Liberator\n\nUp Above the World So High\n\nAnimated Series (The future of the timeline started in the third film, Escape.

I’m the creative director of this new game by Magnetic Press Play. Carbon Grey utilizes the time honored D6 System in a licensing partnership with West End Games.\n\nWe are on day 23, and were funded within the first 24 hours. Lots of cool stuff here, and lots of epic stretch goals to announce as we progress.\n\nPlease check it out here! CARBON GREY KICKSTARTER PAGE\n\nYou can also download the FREE Quickstart for the game here: Carbon Grey Quickstart\n\nThe RPG team is headed up by ENnie and UKGE award-winner and creative director Andrew E Gaska (Alien RPG, Terminator RPG) (that’s me) and game designer Eric Thomas (Rolled and Told, Choose your Own Adventure).ENnie award-winner and editor Mike Olson (Fate Core RPG, Atomic Robo RPG), wrangles writers Kim Perrone (Based on a Dream), Jay Africa (Geek and Sundry), Emmett Furey (New Adventures of Peter and Wendy), and Jameson McDaniel (Quest of Yore).\n\nOn the visual side, the original Carbon Grey art and design is supplemented by the work of artists Chandra Free (God Machine) and Miguel Angel Abad (Iron Sky) plus graphic designer Jared Earle (SLA Industries) and digital sculptors David Arberas Recondo (Zombicide 2nd Edition), Keiran Russell (Ninja Dice), and the team at Draco Studios (Dragonbond, Eldrich Century).Magnetic Press Play is run by Mike Kennedy (Star Wars, Superman).\n\nCarbon Grey was created by Hoang Nguyen, Paul Gardner, Khari Evans, and Kinsun Loh for their creator-owned comic series of the same name originally published by Image Comics.\n\nTHE D6 SYSTEM: RETRO RPG ROOTS\n\nThe D6 System is a tabletop role-playing game system created by West End Games (WEG). Best known as the basis for movie-based tabletop games such as the original Star Wars and Ghostbusters RPGs, the D6 System has provided the tabletop foundation for many popular role-playing games since. Widely beloved for its ease of play, the D6 System is the perfect ruleset for introducing new players to tabletop gaming. The system is named after the many 6-sided dice rolls used to determine success and failure in the game.\n\nI’ve always loved the West End Games D6 System–their Star Wars and Ghostbusters games were a big part of my high school years. I was happy to secure a licensing partnership between Magnetic Press and West End Games to utilize this epic ruleset.\n\nThe game uses the new Magnetic Variant of the classic West End Games D6 System–the system we all know and love from the 1980s Ghostbusters and Star Wars RPGs. The Magnetic Variant rewinds the D6 system back to its classic roots and streamlines it for a forward-thinking modern audience.\n\n…and here’s a look at one of the period specific pre-generated character sheets!\n\nPODCASTS:\n\nThe Dark Orb\n\nVCG Chaotic Good Cast Episode 116\n\nNEWS:\n\nGeek Native Free to Download: Carbon Grey RPG and D6MV quickstart\n\nCarbon Grey Quickstart\n\nCarbon Grey RPG Kickstarter LIVE right now!\n\nSettings Primer on DriveThruRPG\n\nI’ll gather any news items and related info and add them here as the campaign progresses, so stay tuned–and please pledge!\n\n—Andrew E.C.

With this role in mind, I set out to do for The Terminator the same I have done on the ALIEN Role Playing Game—take a publisher’s epic game and make sure it serves as a fandom friendly universe sourcebook as much as an amazing RPG. Normally that would include pouring over every minute source and grabbing any and all elements I can use from throughout the expanded materials. For the Terminator, things quickly proved to be a little different.\n\nDue to the curious licensing nature of The Terminator franchise, I had to consider the overall working canon of the Terminator universe while focusing only on the parts that related specifically to the 1984 film, “The Terminator” and its ancillary materials in Nightfall Games’ first T-RPG offering.\n\nAN OLD HAT’s HAT TRICK\n\nI am no stranger to licensing and expanded universe franchises—I have previously worked as a franchise consultant on such canon projects for 20th Century studios, compiling their entire in-house Predator Bible for them as well as significantly contributing to their Alien and Planet of the Apes timelines.\n\nWhile working on these other licenses, I had encountered scenarios where specific materials were off limits—for example, AVP may have both Aliens and Predators in it, but it is a different universe and franchise to both Alien and Predator. Anytime a Predator appears in an Alien comic, its considered AVP, and not Alien or Predator—despite what it may say on the cover—and is therefore off limits to those individual series’ Bibles.\n\nWhat makes it challenging on Terminator is that I may not mention a particular bit of canon in this core book, I also won’t contradict it—so further releases in the Terminator series will dovetail nicely into and compliment each other. So you may see a nugget of something that might allude to something you know could possibly be there, but it isn’t, for now. It will be, you just have to wait for it. Possibly. 😉\n\nYOUR POST APOCALYPTIC WORLD\n\nAt the end of the day, the Terminator RPG is a guide to YOUR Terminator universe, official or not. Make your game universe your own. What you want in your campaign is absolutely what should be in there, no matter what. As for what I am using, this is the baseline list I stick to. It draws upon my experience as a franchise consultant, and I’ve laid out The Terminator corebook setting and whatnot accordingly.\n\nFilm and Novelizations\n\nThe Terminator (1984)\n\nDark Horse Comics\n\nThe Terminator: Tempest\n\nThe Terminator: One Shot\n\nThe Terminator: Secondary Objectives\n\nThe Terminator: The Enemy Within\n\nThe Terminator: Hunters and Killers\n\nThe Terminator: Endgame\n\nThe Terminator: Suicide Run\n\nThe Terminator: Death Valley\n\nThe Terminator: The Dark Years\n\nThe Terminator: Sector War\n\nThe Terminator: 2029 to 1984\n\nThe Terminator: Enemy of My Enemy\n\nThe Terminator: Burning Earth (originally published by NOW, but reprinted under Dark Horse).\n\nRight now, you can back The Terminator RPG on Kickstarter–-you’ve got less than half a day to get in on backer exclusives, so jump to it by clicking here.\n\nThat’s that for now—but I also recommend bookmarking this page. As my sources expand and evolve, I will update this list here.\n\n—Andrew E.C.

I was working in video games as a visual consultant (not a writer) at the time, which made use of my Adobe skills, and I was doing well. But it was writing that I had wanted to do since college, and really what I had been on a course for my entire life.\n\nWhile I had several false starts, it was in 2010 that I had my first success. From that point on, I had one book or book with me in it out per year. Still, it was a side thing.\n\nIn 2017, I left my video game job of seventeen years and devoted myself completely to writing—and it shows in the number of projects I’ve been involved in over the past few years. Starting in 2019, I’ve written at least two published books per year. The lesson here is you have to follow dreams in order for them to come true. While it’s smart to have a job you can rely on as security, don’t let that security keep you back from what you really want.\n\nWell, enough preaching (for now). As the year nears its end, I thought I’d take a moment to reflect on a decade of my work in covers. This post will be updated as new projects are released.\n\n—Andrew E.C.

All rights reserved.\n\nDEFINING CANON IN AN ALIEN WORLD\n\nAs a franchise consultant to 20th Century Fox on ALIEN, Predator, and Planet of the Apes, I often had to take a long hard look at a number of long-beloved franchise stories and try to figure out how exactly they could still fit into canon. If I couldn’t, I had to recommend they be tossed. I proposed a third option–what I’ve come to call barroom canon. These are stories overheard in a bar (or read in a comic, or played in a video game, or even posted on Facebook) that may or may not have some truth to them. This allows canon to have some flex in regards to including stories that otherwise could no longer count in a franchise’s development.\n\nAs the lead writer and canon consultant on the ALIEN RPG by Free League Publishing, I developed the following Canon Tier guidelines for working out the ALIEN universe.\n\nA NOTE ABOUT PREDATORS\n\nThe first thing to understand about ALIEN, Predator, and AVP is that they are three franchise universes.\n\nAVP is officially a separate franchise and therefore a separate canon from Alien/Prometheus. Predator is also separate from AVP and Alien/Prometheus. If a Predator shows up in an alien project, that project is in the AVP universe and not Alien.\n\nTHE TRUTH ABOUT EASTER EGGS\n\nEaster Eggs are never an indicator of canon, they are surprise homages and nothing more. The separation of franchises is per Fox themselves and was handed to me as perimeters to follow when I first worked on the Predator Bible for them. Lots of people get frustrated by the AVP statements above. They want Predator in their Alien. Personally, I think both franchises are better on their own, so I’m happy about AVP being a third franchise.\n\nYOUR UNIVERSE\n\nAll that being said, the Alien RPG is a guide to YOUR alien universe, official or not. Make your game universe your own. What you want in your campaign is absolutely what should be in there, no matter what. As for what I used, this is the list I stick to. It is based on my discussions and work with FOX as a franchise consultant, and I’ve laid out the setting and whatnot accordingly.\n\nA NOTE FROM MU/TH/UR: As new inspirations or products appear, they will be added to these lists. LATEST UPDATES:\n\n01.16.21. Comics section miniseries titled added. The 2007 film “Sunshine “was added to the Non-Canon Inspiration list.\n\n02.03.2021. The comics section was clarified. The 1965 film “Planet of the Vampires” was added to the Non-Canon Inspiration list.\n\n04.03.22. “Fireteam Elite,” “Heart of Darkness”, “Colony War with RPG Bonus Fallout”, “Inferno’s Fall with RPG Bonus EVAC”, and “Alien Harvest” were added to TIER 2 (Harvest was originally omitted accidentally and the others are new entries).\n\n07.06.24. “Building Better Worlds”, “Enemy of My Enemy with RPG Bonus Trojan Horse”, “Aliens: Dark Descent” and “Alien: Descent” were added to TIER 2. Additionally, tabletop and Video Games were updated under MYTHS AND LEGENDS, and the NON-CANON section has a few new interesting films, including Galaxy of Terror (Somehow I had never seen it before, and I have to say it was pretty neat for a low-budget flick).\n\nTIER I CANON\n\nDefinitive and authorized canon to the Alien/Prometheus universe:\n\nFilm Series1\n\nPrometheus\n\nAlien: Covenant\n\nAlien\n\nAliens\n\nAlien 3\n\nAlien Resurrection\n\nAlien Isolation video game\n\nMike Tanaka Alien Isolation Twitter account\n\nCovenant Short Films:\n\nThe Crossing\n\nThe Last Supper\n\nMeet Walter\n\nFive Crew Messages\n\nPhobos\n\nAdvent\n\nDavid’s Lab: Last Signs of Life\n\nPrometheus Short Films:\n\nTED Conference, 2023\n\nHappy Birthday, David\n\nQuiet Eye: Elizabeth Shaw\n\nProject Prometheus: Mission\n\nWeyland Industries Testimonial\n\nPrometheus Transmission\n\nTIER II CANON\n\nThese sources are absolutely canon until Ridley Scott or another producer throws a curveball:\n\nAlien: The Weyland-Yutani Report\n\nAlien: The Blueprints\n\nAlien: David’s Drawings\n\nAlien Role Playing Game by Free League Publishing\n\nAlien RPG: Starter Set\n\nAlien RPG: Core rulebook\n\nAlien: Chariot of the Gods\n\nAlien: Destroyer of Worlds\n\nAlien: Heart of Darkness\n\nAlien: Map of the Middle Heavens\n\nAlien: Colonial Marines Operations Manual\n\nAlien: Building Better Worlds Colonist Campaign Book\n\nAll upcoming Alien: RPG products\n\nThe following Dark Horse comic series:\n\nAliens: Dead Orbit\n\nAliens: Dust to Dust\n\nAliens: Defiance\n\nAliens: Resistance\n\nAliens: Rescue\n\nTitan and Imprint Novel Series\n\nAlien: Covenant – Origins\n\nAlien: The Cold Forge\n\nAlien: Into Charybdis\n\nAlien: Infiltrator\n\nAliens: Phalanx\n\nAlien: Prototype\n\nAlien: Isolation novelization\n\nAlien: Echo\n\nAlien: Colony War with RPG Bonus Fallout\n\nAlien: Inferno’s Fall with RPG Bonus EVAC\n\nAlien: Enemy of My Enemy with RPG Bonus Trojan Horse\n\nThe 40th Anniversary Short Films\n\nAlien: Harvest\n\nAlien: Containment\n\nAlien: Specimen\n\nAlien: Night Shift\n\nAlien: Ore\n\nAlien: Alone\n\nVideo Games:\n\nAliens: Fireteam Elite Video Game\n\nAlien: Blackout Mobile Video Game\n\nAliens: Dark Descent Video Game\n\nAlien: Descent VR Experience\n\nAliens: Colonial Marines Technical Manual\n\nTIER III CANON\n\nThe majority of the content is canon with some minor problems that can be explained away as myth or hearsay.\n\nWeyland Industries Viral Website (some distances are exaggerated)\n\nAliens: Colonial Marines Video Game (Creatures and Technology are canon, but the story is not)\n\nMovie novelizations (accurate except when contradicted by screen evidence)\n\nAlien\n\nAliens\n\nAlien 3\n\nAlien: Resurrection\n\nPrometheus (Japanese language only)\n\nAlien: Covenant\n\nAlien Novels:\n\nAlien: Out of the Shadows\n\nAlien: Sea of Sorrows\n\nAlien: River of Pain\n\nMYTHS AND LEGENDS\n\nThis stuff should be thought of as tall tales told in bars.

These will NEVER BE OFFICIAL. They are absolutely not part of the Alien Universe but can be massaged into it if you squint hard enough.\n\nBlade Runner\n\nBlade Runner 2049\n\nOutland\n\nSoldier\n\nNON-CANON:\n\nAbsolutely not connected in any way to Alien—save for possible similar themes and/or easter eggs. While not canon, these properties make for great inspiration for the universe.6\n\nPredator, its sequels, comics, novels, and games 3\n\nAVP, its sequels, comics, novels, and games 4\n\nAvatar (2009)\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water (2022)\n\nFirefly (2002)\n\nAlien vs. any and everything 5\n\nAlien 2: On Earth (1980)\n\nJohn Carpenter’s The Thing (1981)\n\nThe Thing (2011)\n\nRaised by Wolves (2020)\n\nLIFE (2017)\n\nSunshine (2007)\n\nPitch Black (2000)\n\nRiddick (2013)\n\nVirus (1999)\n\nUnderwater (2020)\n\nHarbinger Down (2015)\n\nProspect (2018)\n\nSaturn 3 (1980)\n\nGalaxy of Terror (1981)\n\nForbidden World (1982)\n\nCreature (1985)\n\nPandorum (2009)\n\nSupernova (2000)\n\nThe Rig (2010)\n\nLeviathan (1998)\n\nDeep Star Six (1989)\n\nEvent Horizon (1997)\n\nPlanet of the Vampires (1965)\n\nEx Machina (2014)\n\nAnnihilation (2018)\n\nSpecies, its sequels, comics, and novels\n\nTerminator, its sequels, series, comics, novels, and games\n\nScreamers (1995)\n\nWhatever\n\nFootnotes\n\nIn the case of the films, you can count the special editions OR the feature versions as canon. I have used the special editions when writing the RPG but made nods towards the feature versions)\n\nOnly the Aliens issues of “Fire and Stone” and “Life and Death” are part of the Alien Universe. The Predator and AVP portions are not.\n\nAnything with Predator in it is part of the separate Predator universe instead, or…\n\nIf an Alien and a Predator appear, that means it’s part of the separate AVP Universe. Even if it says it’s an ALIEN-labeled product and not an AVP one—if a Predator shows up it’s AVP).\n\nAs a rule of thumb, inter-company crossovers mostly do not count towards canon in any franchise. In regards to other companies who DO count the situations that occur during crossovers, those events are never directly referred to again. For example: you will never have Judge Dredd say, “Remember that time I punched Batman?” and show a recap panel of Batman’s face being smashed after the license has expired. What they did instead was say, “Remember when I punched that masked vigilante?” and did not show it again. You can’t use someone else’s characters past the limited time of the license. So while the event could define changes in the world, the details will forever be vague. If one of the companies involved pushed mentioning these things too far, the other could be like, um… excuse me…\n\nUpdated thanks to some suggestions by FB user and gamer Pete DeRosa.\n\nI think that’s everything. I’ll add to the list if I remember anything else.\n\n—Andrew E.C.
