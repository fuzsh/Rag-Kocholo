        "text": "My best guess is that it's mostly so-bad-it's-good. There's a ton of atrociously written backstory that all seems to add up to something but never does, all the names for things are pretentious and seem to have nothing to do with what they're describing, bizarre things are constantly happening that never get explained, and all of it is relentlessly, soul-destroyingly bleak. It's awful... but it's awful in a way you can tell someone put their heart and soul into. It makes you want to try it just to see if it's really as bad as it seems. And then you want to try it again, just to see if it was really as bad as it seemed the first time.\n\nI have never played it, mind you. This is just my way of describing why I can't help but find it fascinating just from what I've read of it.\n\nI love SLA and I think that describes it pretty well, it's so dumb that it's cool. There is an explanation for all of the horrible things that are going on - in our reality, Mister Slayer was a voice in a kid's head as part of an experiment in universe creation, and now Mister Slayer and the other people involved in the program are in a race against time to make the SLA universe \"real\" before the kid whose head he was in tears it all down from the inside - but honestly it doesn't help anything make sense, it was never officially released, and the background has changed now anyway.\n\nOther things that are cool about the setting...\n\n* You are explicitly playing The Man's agents. Operatives have a lot of power in the setting to boss people around or get things done, even as a rookie, and it's such a refreshing change from the usual zero-to-hero model. Of course, if you try and push it too far, you find out that you're still a small fish in a very, very big pond.\n\n* The game usually encourages being cool and over-the-top; you're constantly on camera, and the general populace of Mort City is thoroughly pacified by their TV screens; shooting stuff is easy but gets expensive fast, so the thing to do is get into melee. Fights are brutal.\n\n* The tech is retro and cool now, because it's all late 80's stuff.\n\n* Without delving too deeply into politics, the book is very, very angry. It was wrote by angry punk teenagers and there's an... authenticity... to it that can't easily be replicated. I'm actually not looking forward to the second edition (If it ever happens...) for just this reason, because I don't think the original creators are still at points in their lives where they can pull this off and I'm worried the book will just seem weird and angry for the sake of it.\n\nIt came out in the same wave of the early 1990s 'dark' roleplaying fad, and had a particular appeal to UK players, which had largely been abandoned by Games Workshop at the time - this was one of the few UK RPGs of the time. In the 1990s, if you wanted to make a successful RPG, the most popular games were things like Vampire and Cyberpunk - with an aggressive street attitude, and this is what SLA Industres had a lot of.\n\nIt was a Scottish RPG, made in the light of a lot of political resentment towards the UK government of the day, and had a general level of cynicism about commercialisation and media spin.\n\nAberdeen's gaming culture is weird and we have a few big SLA fans around, who run it quite regularly - I know many people who have probably played more SLA sessions than D&D ones - so the game never really went away here. I've got one friend who is prepping to run a campaign for some of the more experienced players next year (We've warned her that she doesn't understand what she's signed up to do...), and she wasn't even born when the game came out."
