Based in Derbyshire, UK and born from the ashes of the short-lived ‘Half Wing Games’, Hansor Publishing has released a number of physical and digital products since it was founded and continues to work on future releases, starting with The Gaia Complex in 2021,\n\nAs of 2023, Hansor Publishing is also a studio for hire, utilising Shep’s wealth of project/line management experience to help other publishers bring RPGs to life without needing to have any of their own in-house resources for RPG production."
