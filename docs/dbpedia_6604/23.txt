Italian group, founded on the Amiga in the late 1980s and branching out to SNES and Gameboy in the 1990s.

An advert in Eurochart 9 (march 1991) explained how, "WARFALCONS ITALY ARE NOT DEAD!!!! NOW WE ARE 'THE NIGHTFALL' FRIENDSHIP WITH RESOLUTION 101". In effect, this meant 9009 Xad, Fox, Leo Sxd, MRC and TST left the group for Nightfall. It further mentioned THR, BRT, Thor and Didi as new members.

They were in cooperation with Eurasia (under the monicker EUR^NFL) at least in april and may of 1999.
