Croatian Radio Television's mission is to serve the Croatian audience with high-quality programs that inform, educate, and entertain. It aims to become a fully integrated multimedia organization that delivers dynamic content across all platforms. This requires producing more content with fewer resources, adopting new technologies, and ensuring staff have multimedia skills. The organization must transition from an outdated model to a modern, functional structure with new training programs to develop skills for the digital age such as writing, photography, and social media.
