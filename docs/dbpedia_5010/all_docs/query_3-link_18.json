        "text": "ZAGREB, April 3, 2018 – The management of Croatian Radio and Television (HRT) on Tuesday confirmed that the drama series The Paper (originally: Novine), produced by the Drugi Plan production company, has been sold to the American global provider of streaming films and television series Netflix, which will make it available to a market of almost half a billion viewers in close to 190 countries.\n\nHRT aired the first season of “Novine” in 2016, and currently the second season is being shot.\n\nThe arrival of the series on the demanding US and global markets is a major step forward for HRT, the Drugi Plan production company as well as the entire Croatian audiovisual industry, HRT director Kazimir Bačić said, noting that this would be first Croatian-language series on Netflix.\n\n“Novine” was produced by Nebojša Taraba and Miodrag Sila of Drugi Plan and was directed by Dalibor Matanić, with Ivica Đikić as the scriptwriter.\n\nMost basically, the series is about human relations in the editorial board office of a Croatian daily that changes its owner, but in fact it deals with broader social problems such as crime, betrayal, loss of human integrity under the pressure of vanity, adaptation and existential fears.\n\nThe plot unfolds in an atmosphere of anxiety, interests of the intelligence underworld, big money and high politics where tycoons and politicians stop at nothing to get hold of power.\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\nthe fields marked with * are required"
