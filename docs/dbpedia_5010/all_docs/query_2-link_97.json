Anyone else seen the new adult covers - they look absolutely fantastic, and way better than the old ones. I'm tempted to buy a set, or even just CoS which is really beautiful.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nPrefect Marcus - Jul 10, 2004 9:19 am (#602 of 2955)\n\nDenise,\n\nI've heard a bath in tomatoe juice will help remove the stench from the dogs.\n\nHopefully things will air out soon.\n\nMarcus\n\n_____________________________________\n\nLeviosa - Jul 10, 2004 11:17 am (#603 of 2955)\n\nI just wanted to say that I'm back from Budapest now. I'm sorry but I haven't read all your posts yet because I'm drop dead tired. I have to catch up sleep for a whole week. So I'm off to bed now.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nseptentrion - Jul 10, 2004 11:23 am (#604 of 2955)\n\nI can imagine how it is Denise. It wasn't a skulk but a dead rat which was found in some wall of the place where my husband works, but it was found because of the odor. Beurk !\n\nThanks Dumbledore for the History lesson ! My question was in fact : is the french 14th of July called Bastille Day in America ? Because here we just say \"the 14th of july\", and yes it's like 4th of july in America. BTW bienvenue en France ! Today the weather was rainy and sunny, not too cold.\n\nThanks Tomoé for the link. Maybe I haven't seen it because I use the text version.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nPinky - Jul 10, 2004 12:49 pm (#605 of 2955)\n\nWelcome back, Leviosa! I didn't get a chance to add my well-wishes before you left, but I hope you had a great time. I visited Budapest for a couple days 6 years ago and loved it.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nanbigin - Jul 10, 2004 1:22 pm (#606 of 2955)\n\nDead skunk in the middle of the road\n\nstinkin' up the highway!\n\nThat is the song my family always sings whenever we smell that horrid skunk odor wafting around while we are driving on some road. It is horendous, although, it could, also, sometimes be compared to the smell of a \"bad river\" day - when it smells really sulfourous like something crawled into the seaweed and died which is probably what has happened.\n\nBut any ways, I've always heard the 14th called Bastille day here - at least that's what my French teacher called it in High School. However, I can see how most French people would call it the 14th of July. It's like the American holiday where it's officially called Independence Day but everyone just calls it the 4th of July. So I guess it's just another one of those cultural difference thingies:)\n\nOh and congrats to all those moving, traveling, and those having other special events happening in their lives:) I wish someone would come and visit me here in Greece it's kind of getting monotonous - but at least its gorgeous:) Peace - Kat\n\n_____________________________________\n\nDenise P. - Jul 10, 2004 1:57 pm (#607 of 2955)\n\nThe smell has somewhat toned down. The dogs got a power soak in a mix of baking soda, perioxide and Dawn dishwashing soap (tomato juice just make them smell like a skunky tomato) followed by a rinse of liquid fabric softner. This will be repeated tomorrow. The concrete and side of the house were sprayed down with liquid fabric softner. The living room smells very strongly of cinnamon at the moment since I baked cinnamon in the over AND have liquid potpourri going.\n\nIt would be best to open the windows to let a cross draft in but it is over 90 out with incredibly high humidity so it is not an option right now but this evening, I will try to get them open.\n\nSince it appears that the skunk came under our fence, by the house, I am thinking it was looking for water. The dogs water dish is right there and it could have smelled the water and not realized the dogs were there since they would have been in the back part of the yard using the bathroom.\n\nI had the skunk hauled off with the trash, now I wish I had kept it to be sure it was not rabid. I don't believe either of my dogs was bit since they are currently blowing coat and are like wooly mammoths shedding and I also only saw blood where the skunk was laying. They are vaccinated but you can never be too sure.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nCatherine - Jul 10, 2004 2:12 pm (#608 of 2955)\n\nThat's an interesting dilemma, Denise. Maybe a call to the vet, just to be sure? I don't know the protocol for rabies. I know for tetanus that you can require a booster shot once you have a bad cut/puncture to keep the immunity high, but I don't know about rabies. It's just that skunks are in the high-risk category of spreading the disease, at least they are where I live.\n\nGood luck to you. We'll all try to be extra good and quiet on the Forum so that you can take care of things :-) Right, everyone?\n\n_____________________________________\n\nDJ Evans - Jul 10, 2004 2:32 pm (#609 of 2955)\n\nOh Denise, so sorry to hear of your \"skunk\" problem!!! My sister had the same thing happen to her about 4 years ago. We had to take the skunk in to the Health Department for it to be tested for rabies--her dog had a scratch that couldn't be explained away. So to be on the safe side, they told her it would be best to get the skunk tested. Luckily, all test were clear. As far as the smell? Lord, it seemed like it was weeks before it went away!!! Seriously, it wasn't that long, just days really--but it seemed like it took forever to go away. And I have heard that skunks are attracted to wet/damp areas--so the dogs water bowl could very well have been what it was after. Also, I've read that if you have an open area under your porches--to be sure and close the area off underneath, they love to bed down in such places!!!\n\nSo glad to see you back Leviosa!!!! Can't wait to read all about your trip!!\n\nEverybody have a GREAT weekend!!!\n\nLater, Deb\n\n_____________________________________\n\nCatherine - Jul 10, 2004 3:14 pm (#610 of 2955)\n\nHi, Denise and everyone else,\n\nIt's me, the dog-lover. I thought about emailing this to Denise, but I thought this was worthy of being made public! Just so people know!\n\nAnyway, the AMVA says on its website that if bitten, \"Dogs, cats and ferrets that are currently vaccinated should be revaccinated immediately, kept under the owner's control, and observed for a period as specified by state law or local ordinance (normally 45 days or more). Animals with expired vaccinations will need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\"\n\nWe've had several local people, mostly those who live in rural areas and have limited financial resources, who failed to vaccinate their pets in the first place have to \"put down\" their dogs who were bitten by rabid skunks, raccoons, and foxes. In many cases, these pets were quite beloved by the family and it was so very sad. Many cities, including ours, have low-cost vaccines available, so it's worth inquiring about.\n\nSorry if I have been tiresome, but I thought it needed to be said (not to Denise, of course, who did the right thing in the first place! :-) )\n\n_____________________________________\n\nMadam Poppy - Jul 10, 2004 3:32 pm (#611 of 2955)\n\nEdited by Jul 10, 2004 3:32 pm\n\n...\"and not realized the dogs were there since they would have been in the back part of the yard using the bathroom.\" Gee Denise, I'm impressed, your dogs have their own bathroom? (Sorry, I couldn't resist.)\n\nPoppy\n\n_____________________________________\n\nTicker - Jul 10, 2004 3:33 pm (#612 of 2955)\n\nEwwwwwww, so sorry Denise. We have skunks in our neighborhood too. I try not to let my dog out when I smell one stolling by, but I know it's not a fool-proof plan. Hope your pets return to huggable again.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nDJ Evans - Jul 10, 2004 4:09 pm (#613 of 2955)\n\nOh and Denise, I forgot to warn you (& others) if it was a baby/young skunk, most likely it's family is close by as well!! So be on the look out for any other places they could get in your fenced yard. Hope that helps some from any other future happenings.\n\nLater, Deb\n\n_____________________________________\n\nFlame Alligator - Jul 10, 2004 5:43 pm (#614 of 2955)\n\nHey everyone, I'm back. Only gone a few days and I have so much to catch up on. It's a good thing my highschool taught speed reading. My computer is CLEAN!! But my scroll wheel is weird and I my computer guy is spyware crazy. Uh! That means I have to drop a bunch of fire walls to download anything. But hopefully things will go smoothly until I get a new computer.\n\nWell, I am off to catch up.\n\nDoei (bye)\n\n_____________________________________\n\nSherbie Lemon - Jul 11, 2004 8:07 am (#615 of 2955)\n\nUnfortunately, we have skunks here as well, though my dog has thankfully never been sprayed. The smell is truly rancid, I hope you're able to rid the stench from your house and dogs soon, Denise.\n\nThanks, Sue! We move next weekend; I can hardly wait! By the way, did you get my email?\n\nIt seems that young Dumbledore is not intending to replace some things in our house, rather he seems set on repairing them. This will not fly, so I suppose I will have to have a talk with him tomorrow. Yet I do feel bad about arguing with him, as he does look so much like a young Dumbledore.\n\nI'm glad your computer is functioning again, Flame!\n\nWelcome back, Susi! I hope you had a wonderful trip.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nVeronikaG - Jul 11, 2004 8:08 am (#616 of 2955)\n\nI'm glad we don't have any smelly things like skunks in our back yard. It's bad enough with those mushrooms that pop up over the summer and stink like rotten meat.\n\nGood to see your computer is clean, Flame!\n\n_____________________________________\n\nLeviosa - Jul 11, 2004 11:31 am (#617 of 2955)\n\nThanks for the warm welcome everyone! I was so tired yesterday that I slept for about 15 hours but that still wasn't enough to catch up all sleep. Now you probably can imagine how tired I was yesterday.\n\nI liked Budapest and had a wonderful time there, even though there were sometimes big and small problems.\n\nThe city itself is very big and impressing, especially for me living in a 130 000 habitants city. Everything is much bigger and also more hectic.\n\nWe visited a lot of great builings like the Parliament, the Fishers' Bastion (sp?), the Matthew Church and the Castle. We've also been to the \"Sissi\"-castle Gödöllö and made a boat trip to watch some knight games (which was the thing I and most of my class mates liked least).\n\nThe most dangerous thing probably was visiting a cave system because the \"visiting\" turned out to be dangerous climbing through and over big rocks and small holes, so that one teacher just wanted to come back to daylight again. But most of the others, including me had incredibly much fun.\n\nAnother quite dangerous thing was crossing the street because the Hungarians don't care much for traffic rules and zebra crossings are only for decoration.\n\nThere are so many other things to tell but I'm better not boring you more with my stories.\n\nHave a nice day!\n\n_____________________________________\n\nseptentrion - Jul 11, 2004 12:14 pm (#618 of 2955)\n\nHi Susi, you don't bore us with Budapest and Hungary ! tell us more !\n\n_____________________________________\n\nTomoé - Jul 11, 2004 12:42 pm (#619 of 2955)\n\ndraco all the way, I still remember you as well. ^_^ Your schedule seems to sucks though, but don't kill yourself in frustration you will miss us.\n\nPetunia is so cute Denise! but for the skunk, all I can say is \"Eurgh!\"\n\nSue, I don't know for the US, but in the East of Canada skunks are quite common. As snow melt away, laods of them get smashed to death along the road, that just smell like spring. ^_^ Catherine, I second your description and your sympathies for Denise. I also second what Denise said, the smell is really strong, stronger than a smashed bottle of fragrance.\n\nVeronika, I had a dsl connection with the Canadian state phone corporation and my modem kept overheating, though I didn't wait two months to get it.\n\nThat was pretty good azi! Je voudrais un pain au chocolat s'il-vous-plaît?\n\nAnd welcome Angel!\n\nEdit : yep, tell us more Susi!\n\n_____________________________________\n\nwormsé - Jul 11, 2004 2:25 pm (#620 of 2955)\n\nWelcome back, Susi! I'm glad you had a good time. I had a dream about you this morning... you came back to my house after your trip, rather than your own... It was quite odd. I'll tell you the details later, whenever I see you online. Hehe!\n\n_____________________________________\n\ntimrew - Jul 11, 2004 2:47 pm (#621 of 2955)\n\nI won't be here for a few days, you guys. My Dad died today. He would have been 84 in two weeks.\n\nHe was born in Hamburg, Germany.\n\nHe left school and walked down to Hamburg Harbour when he was 14 (in 1934), and signed on as a cabin boy on a trawler. He needed to contribute to the income of his mother and father who were poor and had 8 children.\n\nWhen WW2 came, he was conscripted into the Merchant Marine and spent a few years ferrying supplies to the Channel Islands. His ship pulled into Dieppe, France, and Dad was sent for supplies. Then D-Day happened. Dad's ship set sail without him, and he was captured by the Americans. He was shipped over to the USA (in luxury) aboard the Queen Mary, and then spent the rest of the war picking cotton in Mississippi. In London, a few years ago, he met the singer, Jimmy Ruffin, who was born in Mississippi - they became firm friends.\n\nAfter the war, he was shipped back to England, where he met my Mum, who he dated and married. By this time he was 24 years old. He never went back to Germany, except on holidays to see his Mum, sisters and brothers.\n\nHe fathered me, my brother Paul, and 19 years later (the old devil!), my sister, Christel.

I truly do understand; I lost my mother six years ago. Losing a parent is very hard. There's nothing I can say that will make you feel better, so I'm not going to try.\n\nBut if I may offer a piece of advice-when a little time has passed, and you feel comfortable doing it, you should write about your dad-facts about his life, your feelings about him, memories you have of him, things you learned from him. This will help the grieving process, and give you (and your family, if you chose to share) a wonderful way to remember him. His life will be preserved for posterity.\n\nNow go do what you need to do, with the knowledge that you have many, many people who care about you and are here to support you in any way we can.\n\nTake care~shepherdess\n\n_____________________________________\n\nDenise P. - Jul 11, 2004 4:35 pm (#625 of 2955)\n\nTim, please accept my sympathy on the loss of your beloved parent.

Warm thoughts to you and your entire family. {{{Tim}}}\n\n_____________________________________\n\nboop - Jul 11, 2004 4:55 pm (#626 of 2955)\n\nTim, I am so sorry for your loss. I have not lost a parent, but I can't even think what you must be going through right now. I will keep you and your family in my prayers. Just know we are all here for you Tim. Here is a great big hug to you.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nChemyst - Jul 11, 2004 6:28 pm (#627 of 2955)\n\nThanks, Timrew, for sharing such a poignant story of your Dad's life. It's as if we got to know him a little, even though we never met him. For you to write so fondly of him, he surely must have been proud of you as well.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nKip Carter - Jul 11, 2004 6:44 pm (#628 of 2955)\n\nTim, you have been a friend on this Forum for a long time and a true supporter of good cheer here. I can see a lot of your father in you and I know that he is looking down on you with pride and pleasure knowing that his son is a true man and a gentleman. He raised you extremely well. I know that you are extremely proud to say he is your father. He is now remembered by many on the Harry Potter Lexicon Forum. A toast to your father and the family he created!\n\n_____________________________________\n\nDJ Evans - Jul 11, 2004 6:59 pm (#629 of 2955)\n\nTim\n\nA death, any death, is life changing for all of us--more so when it is a parent. We somehow expect them to be around forever, then one day they aren't. It reaches and touches us in the very depth of our souls the loss we feel when they are gone. Yet, that special place they hold in our hearts will never be filled by any other--that is their place till we finally pass. And that special place that they hold? It will bring you comfort in the days to come, it will bring you the warmth and fond memories that you have of your Dad. I know, I lost my Dad 7 years ago this coming January and I'm still in touch with those warm and fond memories of him. I draw on them quite a bit at times.\n\nSo Tim, please take comfort in knowing that you and your family are in all of our hearts and prayers at this time. I wish I could have met your Dad, as he sounded like a very special person. You did him proud in your eulogy of your Dad.\n\nLater, Deb\n\n_____________________________________\n\nHem Hem - Jul 11, 2004 8:14 pm (#630 of 2955)\n\nCondolences to you, Tim.

With my stepfather it was watching silly television shows, with my mother it was food, my father was looking at family pictures. With every person passing you need to find what's comforting for celebrating that individuals life.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nJulia. - Jul 11, 2004 10:27 pm (#637 of 2955)\n\nTim, my deepest condolences to you and your family.

Your father seems to have lived a full and wonderful life. The most strange and wonderful thing happens after the passing of a loved one... all of the good memories come to the fore of your mind and you get to re-live them again.

Holy cow! I hope you've been packing! And I hope we get a little break in the heat levels around here. I think OK is usually as hot or hotter than it is here in KC - and this would be no fun to move during (114 degree heat index)!\n\nSafe travels to all who are vacationing!

I edited out a small part of your post. Perhaps the translation from French to English just didn't work quite right for the particular sentiments you were trying to express. If you have any questions, feel free to e-mail me at pinkylexiconfan@yahoo.com. I'm very glad you are a part of our Forum. You'll find we have several other French members as well. Have fun exploring the Forum! ~Pinky\n\nTim , I'm so sorry about your dad but I won't tell you \" It will be OK, everybody dies one day, he's got a great life and now he has deserved a time of rest \" because all these sentences are cliché. I'm sure you would prefer him to be alive and live his life again with you. Nevertheless , do never forget that cliché that says \" your dad is still living in your heart \" because that is tru ; your dad is still living through you, even though it's painful at the moment, it will be a support all of your life. So , leave your life as best as you can and you will feel your dad proud inside of you. I hope you will understand what I mean and won't think i'm disrespectful to your feels and to your pain. I wish you good luck\n\n_____________________________________\n\nKerstin - Jul 12, 2004 11:47 am (#649 of 2955)\n\nTim, my deepest condolences to you.\n\nFrom what you wrote your dad had had an eventful life and he seems to leave a big hole in his family.

I take it your vacation was a good one? Thanks for the congrats; I couldn't be happier for me either!\n\nMollis, it is terribly hot here too. I don't know what the heat index is today, but it feels like a humid furnace outside. Luckily, most of our things are in a storage facility, so the move should be relatively smooth. However all of our bedroom stuff is here, but being a packing procrastinator, I haven't yet begun to assemble boxes.\n\nMy discussion with Dumbledore went well. Our sod is being laid today and our garage door opener should be in tomorrow. Almost everything else we asked for is being done with the exception of our tile being extended out, though they are giving us several rows worth so that we may do it ourselves later if we wish. We bought a refrigerator yesterday, it's not the stainless steel that I wanted (too expensive) but it's nice all the same.\n\nHave a great day, all!\n\n_____________________________________\n\nPadfoot - Jul 12, 2004 1:36 pm (#652 of 2955)\n\nYes my vacation was very nice and relaxing by the lake. I wish I was there now as it is 93 degrees and rising here. It's going to be hard to get back into the swing of things at work. So that's why I am here at the forum.\n\nI forgot to mention to Marcus that I like his picture. You do look a lot like Alan Alda (I remember you mentioning that once somewhere).\n\n_____________________________________\n\nDetail Seeker - Jul 12, 2004 1:38 pm (#653 of 2955)\n\nTim, as everything, I could give you along, have been said already, I just can tell you, that my thoughts are with you now.

You don't know what they mean to me right now. I was so moved that I sat my mother down in front of the computer and showed them to her also. She wants me to print them off and display them at Dad's funeral service on Friday.\n\nShe has also asked me to thank you all. She thinks that it's wonderful that people from all over the world now know about her husband, Hans. Thanks once again, you guys.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nAnna Osipova - Jul 12, 2004 3:37 pm (#656 of 2955)\n\nTim, I'm very sorry for your loss. There isn't much I can say that hasn't been said already, so I'll just leave it at that.\n\nSherbie Lemon, I hope the move goes smooth. I hope you set up your computer fast, too. Personally, I love moving. You get to redecorate the entire house :~D.\n\nPadfoot, I went to the lake yesterday (my brother's friend has a boat) and I got burned so badly. I was also dead tired and I'm so sore! Still had a blast though, and I'm sure you did too.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nD.W. - Jul 12, 2004 3:48 pm (#657 of 2955)\n\nTim,\n\nI just wanted to add my deepest symphathies to those of the other forum members on the loss of your father.

Embrace each other through this tough time.\n\nSherbie, good luck to you. I fear moving and try to avoid it at all cost, convincing myself that I don't need more space despite overflowing closets. I've also been dreading turning 40, but alas, it is the big 4-0 today. Not too bad so far. Last night my hubbie took me and a bunch of family and friends to dinner and then an outdoor concert with Shawn Colvin and The Cowboy Junkies. It was great.

We've moved 6 times in 5 years now, so the excitement of moving has lost its thrill a bit. But this time it will be into our own house, which is quite an amazing feeling. I can't wait to arrange things, yet I'm dreading the actual move.\n\nI'm glad you had a good time, Padfoot. Mom and I are going to Abbey Road on the River (again!), which takes place in Cleveland. Last night we checked the weather channel's site and it said on there that the highs are around 80 during the day, and the lows around 60 at night! Woo hoo! Here it is 98 with an unholy heat index. I can't wait to have a breeze that doesn't feel like someone is blowing a hairdryer in my face.\n\nBoiling Hot\n\nThe people on here are amazing, aren't they, Tim? I found that out during my house crisis. Even though I think we all wish we could do more for you than expressing our condolences, I'm so happy to hear that it helped you to know how much you, and through you, your father, means to this forum family. We'll be here whenever you need us.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nLadybug220 - Jul 12, 2004 7:09 pm (#662 of 2955)\n\nTim - my deepest sympathies.

And over 500 messages on the Chat thread, sorry I won't be able to read them all. I had a wonderful vacation with my family. We are actually all still speaking to each other!! We just got back last night. I hardly saw my children today as they were going up and down the neighborhood playing with all their friends for as long as they could.\n\nI'm sorry I didn't get to stop and see you, Marie. Hubby's brother and wife took us up into the mountains for a couple of days. We were so far in, that we didn't go back to I-25, then to further inhibit any travels that direction, our youngest got sick that day. I was really bummed. I hope all has gone well with your move.\n\nI did get to have lunch with Ticker in Rapid City. Aria is so adorable. It was great to meet you and your husband, Ticker.\n\nTim, I'm very sorry to hear about your father.

What a wonderful community you all have established here. I feel honored to be a part of it.\n\nSherbie Lemon, congratulations on the new house!

Good luck!\n\nAnd finally, happy birthday Accio Sirius! *breaks out the HP party hats*\n\nEDIT: I missed Padfoot's post about Marcus's new avatar.

Happy belated birthday.. hope it was a good one.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nOzymandias - Jul 13, 2004 2:20 am (#676 of 2955)\n\nI'm sorry to burden and/or annoy all of you with this post, but as you'll see I don't really know who else to say it to. This is going to sound incredibly whiny but I need to get it off my chest.\n\nI am a loner, an outcast, a recluse and a socially stunted human being. I find this very depressing.\n\nI'm 19 years old, and I don't think I have a single real friend. I have kept in touch with perhaps a dozen people from high school, and I would only call two of them real friends. One of them has changed so much since I knew her that we have a hard time relating to each other any more. She was my best friend in high school. The other would be a great friend, and he is, but we're still recovering from an awkward time when he wanted to take it farther than friendship and I didn't, so I don't feel as comfortable around him as I once did.\n\nI have never once been on a date. I have never kissed someone who is not a member of my family. I have never been asked on a date.\n\nI feel like, outside of my immediate family, I'm not at all close to anyone. I don't mean to downplay my family. I have a wonderful relationship with my parents and my brother, but they all have their own social circles and I don't. I've got lots of acquaintances, but I don't even feel comfortable asking them to go to a movie or something. I'm completely paranoid that nobody I know likes or even tolerates me.\n\nI'm feeling like this is abnormal for someone my age. Or for anybody. I have this horrible vision of myself in 50 years, living in a shack somewhere talking to the furniture. I imagine myself dying and nobody cares. Or even notices.\n\nI don't know what to do about it. At least part of my isolation is self-imposed. I'm not a very social person; going out and interacting with more than about two people is hard work for me. It stresses me out and wears me down. I know it's ridiculous to expect to form relationships without spending time with people, but surely there must be some sort of middle ground. If so, I haven't found it. And it's doubly hard because I differ so much from the majority of my peer group. Going to parties, bars or nightclubs is pretty much the social scene, and I despise all three. Surely there are people who share my feelings, but how to find them without going door-to-door?\n\nWhat do I do? Is this normal? Is it healthy? Am I destined to be alone?\n\nI'm sorry to place this rant on all of you. I assure you that I'm not fishing for sympathy, at least not consciously. It's helped just to get these feelings out. If you've actually gone and read this whole thing, thank you. Any advice you have would help a lot, especially if anyone has found themselves in a similar situation.\n\n*sigh*\n\n_____________________________________\n\nseptentrion - Jul 13, 2004 3:12 am (#677 of 2955)\n\nOzymandias, having relationships with others is taking a risk, whoever you have a relationship with. What you need is taking some risks by asking some of the people you know and who seems the more likely to understand you to do things with you (having a drink, going to the cinema...). Maybe it'll be a wonderful time, maybe it'll be dreadful but if you don't want to be totally alone, you have to do it. I'm sure there are more people than you'd believe to who don't like to spend all their time with people, going to bars or clubs...but of course those kind of people aren't as much visible as the others. You're not meant to be alone, don't expect too much from yourself, and don't think it's so difficult to meet people who share interests with you.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nMarè - Jul 13, 2004 4:23 am (#678 of 2955)\n\nFirst of all, Tim, what can I add that hasn't been said allready? Take care, of yourself and your family. Best wishes to all.\n\nAnd Ozymandias, I don't know what you are doing right now, but starting a new chapter in life and moving out of your old neighbourhood and start living on your own might change your circle of friends. A new job, a new education, a new city might do worlds of goods.\n\nAlso think about joining a sportclub, a painting course or anything where you meet new people, whom share at least one interest with you (or they wouldn't be there..)\n\nTake a look here: http://www.witchinghour.org/getinvolved/preevents.html.\n\nThese people seem to have Harry Potter parties all around the world. So you can meet HPfreaks in real life.\n\nAnd further I can only back up Septentrion, the first times you go and hang in clubs might not be the most fun because you might feel a bit uncomfortable. But it gets better!\n\n_____________________________________\n\nmike miller - Jul 13, 2004 5:55 am (#679 of 2955)\n\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY ACCIO SIRIUS!!!\n\nOzy - You're normal! As humans, we are all very good at putting up barriers around us to protect us from pain. As Septentrion said, it means taking a risk. I echo the advice of Mare', find something you would like to do anyway (painting, yoga, archery, collecting), anything that interests you. Having common interests drastically reduces the stress and the risk of meeting new people.\n\nI went through a similar trial in my teens. I was so self-conscious about wearing braces and the general awkwardness of being a teen that I was tongue-tied around girls. It wasn't until I went away to college did I start to get over it. It seemed easier to open up with people who had not known me during my self imposed exile. This too will pass, give it time, take a chance and find something you have passion for. You will find others that share your passion.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nhaymoni - Jul 13, 2004 6:03 am (#680 of 2955)\n\nOzy - I didn't really talk with anyone from high school after high school ended. We all went our separate ways and, quite frankly, most of them were idiots.\n\nAs for dating, I think I could use a Time Turner and say \"no, thanks!\" to just about all of the jerks that I went out with before age 19.\n\nI can tell from your posts that you are intelligent and thoughtful - people will learn this about you, but you have to give them a chance. Take a class - any kind of class. Volunteer - pick something you could really feel passionate about. I'd avoid the bars - try a health club - you don't have to pick a really expensive one - see if your city, town, university has a community recreation center. Go to a children's hospital and read Harry Potter out loud to the kids with all the expression and accents you can muster!\n\nI would also discuss your situation with your physician. I am no doctor and I don't even play one on TV, but sometimes we need a little help when it comes to getting over our fears. You may be surprised at what your doctor is able to do for you.\n\nYou'll find a kindred spirit and I'll bet they will show up when you least expect it!\n\n_____________________________________\n\nFlame Alligator - Jul 13, 2004 6:21 am (#681 of 2955)\n\nTim, You and your family have my deepest sympathy.

Might I suggest you do a few things...\n\n1. Join some clubs at your school. You'll find like-minded people and make friends;\n\n2. See if your school has free mental health counseling, so you have a chance to explore your feelings and relationships in a healthy supportive place;\n\n3. Take advantage of SF. There are loads of people, places and things in SF to get involved with. I met some people from the SF costumers guild when I was there recently and they were great fun and welcomed new people gladly. A little odd, as costumers are...but hey I was wearing a Slytherin costume at the time so who am I to talk?\n\n4. If you see someone you find attractive, ask him/her out! The worst they can do is say no...\n\nOh, I nearly forgot...Marcus! Y'know, I did start to create a mental image of you as the big hairy-chested cartoon. Heh, heh. Nice to see your real face. Does this mean you won't be residing in your cartoon castle anymore?\n\n_____________________________________\n\nAccio Sirius - Jul 13, 2004 7:07 am (#683 of 2955)\n\nThanks for the birthday wishes! It was a good one. I'll admit I was hoping Mike would share some PoA booty... ; ).\n\nOzzy, Your post was very touching. I think you might be surprised at how many people feel the way that you do. And there is no set timeline in life to learn new things or have new experiences, so don't feel bad if you haven't met some imaginary deadline. There's a good chance that most people lie about things that they've done or--especially when it comes to relationships--regret that they've done things too early. Maybe it's the recently 40 year old in me talking, but with age comes knowledge and with it a certain contentment. So you in waiting, contemplating and seriously evaluating all relationships, will bring a much deeper bond when you do form them. And that's exactly what people are always searching for no matter what age. I wish you luck.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nFawkes Forever - Jul 13, 2004 7:24 am (#684 of 2955)\n\nOzy.... first of all take a great big hug.... *HUG*\n\nAs already said by some of our more eloquent members of the forum... you are normal. We all go through phases like this... it is normal. Like Haymoni, I haven't kept in contact much with those I went to high school with. Indeed the first year after high school (which I think is were you are at now) was kind of tough. Going off to college, having to make new friends & taking on new challenges. The main thing was I had to take a chance when meeting new people.... I joined a few clubs & the like just to get out there to meet new people.... Also you're not going to click with everyone you meet, but there will be some people out there that you will mesh with quite well. Anyways, all we need are a few good friends... more so than a load of well... okish (if thats a word ) friends.\n\nAs for dating... now I don't in any way claim to be an expert... LOL far from it methinks.... but it's the same as making new friends, sometimes you have to take a chance... sometimes it pays off... sometimes it doesn't (usually the latter in my case ) However I try not to let that put me off....\n\nWe all put up barriers to stop ourselves from getting hurt, thats human nature. About six years ago I lost my closest childhood friend in a very tragic accident & I closed myself off to many people. Unfortunately I lost a lot of friends in the process, as I wouldn't share my feelings, let them get close & I cut them off, all through what I thought was self preservation. However I realised I couldn't spend my life shut away. If my friends death taught me anything it was that life is too darn short, & to use a cliche... life is for living.\n\nIt was difficult & I must admit that even now it still can be.... somedays I find myself putting the barriers back up to prevent people from getting close & I need to remind myself that its ok to let people in.....\n\nMaking a few changes is all it takes.... I moved to a new city to start a new job, & it was the best thing I did. I'm not suggesting that you upsticks & move.... but start with something small ... like join a book club, or a sports club. From your posts you seem like a warm caring intelligent person, just try not to be afraid... take a chance on people .... they might surprise you. If you do feel like you need some extra help... then perhaps going to your doctor for a quick chat might help... Good luck... I wish you all the best!\n\nSorry for rattling on so much folks..... if you've made it this far take 10 points for your house\n\nHi Flame *waves madly*\n\n_____________________________________\n\nPadfoot - Jul 13, 2004 8:49 am (#685 of 2955)\n\nHappy Birthday Accio Sirius! Make A Wish\n\nOzzy, I would like to send you hugs too. I can get easily depressed (runs in the family) too and have thought many of those same thoughts over the years. Everyone has given you some great advice that you should try. I have only one friend that I went to high school that I still keep in contact with and she lives across the country. The friends I've made since high school are much more important in my life than those silly girls I knew way back when. Getting involved in any activity/club is worth it. You might need to try a few out before finding something you really enjoy doing, but try something. It's hard at first, but it does get easier the more you are in social situations. I am shy too, so I know how you feel. And once you start opening up to people, you find that you are \"normal\". I have noticed that the older I get, the more self confidence I have. So hang in there and go find some fun activity where you can meet new people.\n\nI have found that having a pet in my life has helped me immensely (the best decision I ever made). If you have the option of getting one, I would recommend it. That unconditional love just can't be beat!\n\n_____________________________________\n\nJulia. - Jul 13, 2004 9:15 am (#686 of 2955)\n\n*Hugs Ozy* Don't worry Ozy, as everyone else said, what you're going through is very normal. I'm almost your age, and have simillar experiences (except that I'm still very close with my high school friends). I'm not a very social person. I spend the vast majority of my time sitting infront of a computer or doing school work. The number of true friends I have (not counting Forumers and family) is less than ten, and at least three are teachers from high school.\n\nBeing that I am so close with my friends from high school, things were very difficult for me when I went off to college last year. I was so used to having everyone around and then suddenly they weren't. I pretty much locked myslef in my dorm and got very caught up in being anti-social and sorry for myself.\n\nI joined one group on campus...Hillel. I met some very cool people there, all of whom were Jewish and most of whom are into simillar things as I. It was hard at first, because I really only saw them two days a week, but after a while of feeling each other out, we saw each other all the time, and became friends. No one expects you to become a social butterfly over night, but honestly, eating dinner alone every night isn't fun. My suggestion is that you find something you're into anyway, see if there's a club for it on campus, and join up. As previously noted by everyone else, you're likely to meet great people who are just as wonderful as you are.\n\nAs for dating, don't worry about that. You're talking to someone who wasn't properly kissed, or had a proper date until 18. My parents didn't meet each other until they were 25. Love will happen for you, you just have to be patient. Also, don't waste any opportunities. If you see someone who you think you might be interested in, as 'em to dinner (OK, the dining hall isn't exactly the most romantic place, but I'm sure it'll work, just offer to swipe her (er, for non college folk to swipe for someone means to take a meal of your card so that someone else can eat)).\n\nHope this helps Ozy, and as always, you know you're free to unload your troubles on us any time.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nicthestrals - Jul 13, 2004 9:26 am (#687 of 2955)\n\nOzy, my heart goes out to you. I have to second what everyone has suggested to you. I did not have friends in school or my first go round at college. I never had a date before the age of 20. I was never asked and the one time I asked, I was turned down.\n\nGetting out around people in an environment you feel comfortable in will help. I worked with horses for years and met some very interesting people. Somehow being around animals helped me relate to other human beings.\n\nMy isolation was also self-imposed through depression and not trusting people because I had been emotionally hurt by them. Once I got to know people, I found that they weren't all that bad.\n\nI didn't talk much to others, but now I'll strike up a conversation with people while waiting in a line. Having a sense of humor helps, too. I'm now 36 and am still not comfortable around large groups of people, but I understand that that is just me.\n\nBe patient with yourself and don't give up. You have much to offer!\n\n_____________________________________\n\nCelestina W. - Jul 13, 2004 9:54 am (#688 of 2955)\n\nOzy, I know how you feel. I'm 17, have never been on a date, and have very few close friends. I know what it's like to be isolated because few of my peers are interested in the same things I am. All I can really tell you is to give it time and trust that things will get better. Try to find some activity where you can go out and meet people -- volunteer work might be good. I really hope our messages will help you some. Here's another hug from me. *HUG*\n\nPadfoot, I'm curious, what part of Minnesota did you visit on your vacation? I'm guessing it wasn't my area, since you mentioned a lake and we don't have too many of them in the southeastern corner of the state. But anyway, I'm glad you enjoyed you trip.\n\nShepherdess, on the Tell about Yourself thread you said that you remember me, which is really cool since I didn't think anyone would. So I just had to say thanks!\n\n_____________________________________\n\nicthestrals - Jul 13, 2004 9:57 am (#689 of 2955)\n\nCelestina W, I remember you, too.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nPadfoot - Jul 13, 2004 10:00 am (#690 of 2955)\n\nCelestina W, I was much further North than you are. I was in a town called Gull Lake. Curiously enough it was next to Gull Lake! It's near Brainerd. My mom's aunt has a cabin up there. It was very pretty to watch the fireworks go off over the lake.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nCourtney22 - Jul 13, 2004 11:19 am (#691 of 2955)\n\nOzy,\n\nThough I have not personally gone through what you are right now I still feel I can relate. My brother is much the same way you are. He's not into Bars or drinking or the many of social things that a lot of people do. He has always been very shy and he used to get panic attacks, especially before going to school. He started taking anxiety medicine and the improvement has been vast. He still hasn't got a ton of friends or a girlfriend but he is becoming more comfortable with himself and that is the most important first step.\n\nThe important thing is to hang in there! Taking classes of any kind is a good idea in my opinion. I have met so many interesting and diverse people in college. You don't have to go to school to get some kind of degree you can do independent studies just for fun and if you take classes you are interested in you are bound to run into people with similar interests. Plus in a classroom setting its not as awkward to start up conversations, you always have the class to talk about.\n\nMy heart goes out to you and I hope everyone's advice will help you in some way if its only to let you know that you have friends here!\n\nXOXO Courtney\n\n_____________________________________\n\nLadybug220 - Jul 13, 2004 12:23 pm (#692 of 2955)\n\nOzy, I completely understand. I had my first date at 17 but didn't have another one until I was 23 (got my first kiss after that too). There are some great suggestions from others out there as to what you can do but also know that you are not the only one out there. Relationships in all forms take risks (I think Tomoe was the one that said that) and some are worth the risk of getting to know someone. Start slowly and keep working at it. Feel free to email me at anytime (check my profile for my email address).\n\n_____________________________________\n\nVeronikaG - Jul 13, 2004 12:57 pm (#693 of 2955)\n\nAs usual, I have been off a few days, and I have a lot to say now.\n\nFirst of all, Tim, My deepest sympathies. Your Dad sounded like a great man. Take care.\n\nOzy, I think I know how you feel. I was about your age before I started going to parties where there was drinking. Fortunately, most of my closest friends were a few years younger than me, so I had a couple of extra years before I needed to go to them. I still only go to parties with people I know and like. Going out on bars was scary for me at first as well, as I'm blessed with being surrounded by nervous people who always talked about how dangerous going out was. I was afraid the first times I went out, tried to go away from all the strangers. But after having been out a couple of times I felt more comfortable, and joined in dancing (which I'm as bad at as anybody) and talking to my friends' friends.\n\nAs friends go, I have no contact with most of my childhood friends. (But I have told on the forum earlier what they were like...) The last five years I have changed social circles twice, due to starting college, quitting and starting again. My friends from high school didn't go to college, so most of them are now settled with jobs, boy friends, children and houses. This makes me seem like the younger of the old gang now, as I have neither of those things. So don't really share any interests any more. But I have promised myself that I will keep in touch with the friends I have made during this second time around in college.\n\nAnd to cheer you up a little further, at 24 I still have yet to have a lasting, successful relationship with a man. And I don't do dates. I'm not a bit romantic, so even if it is intended to be a date it ends up as just a day out. And besides, the older and more mature you are when you start a relationship, the greater the chance it lasts.\n\nI hope my hopeless advices make you feel a little better.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nTomoé - Jul 13, 2004 1:03 pm (#694 of 2955)\n\nI wasn't me, it was Septentrion (what a relief, I'm not the only one who mess people ^_~)\n\nOnly one of my secondary school friends is still close to me, there's another one that I see from time to time, but I'm really no good for keeping in touch. I didn't had much friend back then as I could had made competition to Eloise Midgeon. I had a really low self esteem back then and couldn't even see myself as date-able. I still never had a proper boyfriend or even properly kiss, but it's for lack of trying. I was victim of a car accident in December 2001, and I become tired very easily when I do intellectual stuff like talking with people, so I give up on boyfriends until my brain get better.\n\nI second what everyone said about clubs and stuff, I have a good bunch a good friend and good time in my medieval re-enactment group, and have a lot of good moments with people on this forum. ^_^\n\nEdit : by the way, I'm 25.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nLadybug220 - Jul 13, 2004 1:25 pm (#695 of 2955)\n\nOh well, too late for me to edit.

You are funny, charming, and obviously intelligent. I am sure that given time, and a little risk taking on your part, you will find that people that you meet will respond to you similarly. When I was 17 I felt like you, then I got a pet and then pregnant. Oops. Although having a child is tough, and I wouldn't recommend it at your age, taking care of one makes you feel loved and allow you to meet new people. I say volunteer reading to children, or something similar. You can meet people and feel good about yourself while you get to know others. Listen to everyone's posts, they come from love and experience. :BIG HUG: P.S. kitties are always helpful when your lonely.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nLeprechaun Jack - Jul 13, 2004 2:25 pm (#697 of 2955)\n\nOzy,\n\nI had very similar feelings to what you described when I was your age... but I went in a different direction. I became very loud and out of control to make up for my feelings of loneliness and isolation. I needed to have everyone think I was too good for them and everyone was beneath me. Of cause that worked out real well (NOT). As some time passed I found out that who I am is more important that how I'm perceived. That kinda' took a load off me and little by little I was able to remove the wall I had built around myself and start to make some friendships. I know it sounds very cliché but you need to be a friend... to have a friend.\n\nI don't know if anyone else has mentioned this but why not look for a Harry Potter group for grown-ups. We have one in NY I've only had the chance to go once, but it was very easy to talk to everyone as we had a common interest. As a matter of fact I met our own \"Gina R Snape\" at that meeting.\n\nBe ready for some bumps and bruises on the road. Never treat someone in a way you wouldn't want to be treated, and always try to be the one to extend the hand of friendship, it may be slapped away once in a while. But the new friends you make will be worth it, and who knows one of those new friends might lead to something more (and if it doesn't happen that’s Ok too). All things happen in their own time.\n\nJack\n\n_____________________________________\n\nCatherine - Jul 13, 2004 2:38 pm (#698 of 2955)\n\nThis may sound a little touchy-feely, but I am so proud of the Lexicon Forum right now!\n\nI've seen so many people offer such good advice from several different viewpoints to Ozymandias, and I will just ditto their posts.\n\nI also was touched when I read the responses to Tim's post that his father died.\n\nYou all are an amazing group!\n\n_____________________________________\n\nOzymandias - Jul 13, 2004 3:16 pm (#699 of 2955)\n\nI'd like to thank you all for your kindness and support.

I just wanted to let you know that you are not alone. I am going through something a lot like that at the moment (and have been for some time). I come from a family that has moved around alot (foreign service) and am terrible at adapting to new environments. As a result I am incredibly close to my family but have a great difficulty making friends. I have very few really close friends and always feel out of place at parties. I am also almost 18 years old, about to go to college and have never been kissed.\n\nHowever my situation has been improving over the last two years and I owe most of that to my involvement in after school theater. It not only allowed me to meet some wonderful people but being able to contribute to something as fun and exciting as theater (something I have really grown to love) made me feel appreciated and boosted my self confidence.\n\nBefore I became involved in theater I had a lot of free time on my hands and I spent it feeling sorry for myself, I felt like I was useless. I really can not stress how important I believe it is to go out and do something. Having something to do and feeling like my efforts were really appreciated has made a huge difference.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nhaymoni - Jul 13, 2004 6:22 pm (#704 of 2955)\n\nI really wish that I had gotten involved in theater. I worked after school, so I couldn't really stay for practice or anything. In college I was busy taking my business courses. Looking back, though, I think I would have enjoyed it.\n\nThat would be a way to meet some really creative people that have lots of different kinds of talents - acting, directing, costuming, set-building, etc.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nViola Intonada - Jul 13, 2004 7:24 pm (#705 of 2955)\n\nOzi, I know how you feel.

I am, however, excited that I, Robot the movie comes out this week. I am a big science fiction fan and Isaac Asimov's short stories of I, Robot is one of my favorite books.

First, you have a desire to develop friendships; that is healthy even if it's not comfortable. Secondly, you don't have all the baggage of a horrible dating history where one repeats the same mistakes over and over. People who start dating too young often build bad habits and develop the undesirable skill of breaking up when real life happens. Thirdly, you say you despise nightclubs and bars- that can be a good thing too since they tend to be populated with a 'misery loves company' crowd. Fourthly, you have a wonderful relationship with your parents and your brother, which means you have and respect a good foundation for building personal relationships. And even the fact that you have so many misgivings about relationships at 19 indicates you are normal. That is a lot of positive stuff for such a depressed post!\n\nI know you said, \"interacting with more than about two people is hard work for me,\" but that is a positive thing too. Right now you are down because you know you have to go out and find other people, but bit of hard work can be good for you. Take the other forum members' advice and find a group to be involved with. Once you have learned to be happy with yourself in a group, you will find that your happiness attracts others. Once your happiness starts attracting others to you, you don't have to go out and find people anymore. It's a paradox.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nCatherine - Jul 14, 2004 5:37 am (#716 of 2955)\n\nHi everyone!\n\nI'm going to answer Tornedo's question \"Any way, Catherine-- say Happy Birthday to Daisy. Just one question: Isn't Daisy 4 years old? So, how come she turns one on July 14? \" here instead of in the Luna thread. Thanks for asking, Tornedo!\n\nDaisy is the dog in the picture, and she has \"officially\" left puppyhood behind her as of today, although probably only technically. Tornedo, you are right that I have a four year old, but she's my human, fur-free child! I also have another little girl who will be nine very soon, which makes me feel very old. My other furry child, Phoebe, will be turning 11 in a few weeks.\n\nSo I think Daisy and I will head out to Petsmart later today and buy her a small birthday treat.\n\nHave a good day, everybody.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nTicker - Jul 14, 2004 5:46 am (#717 of 2955)\n\nEdited by Jul 14, 2004 5:47 am\n\nI agree with Pinky, Julia!

There has been a ton of great advise here & clearly you are not wierd. (Unless most of us are too, which, though probable, it is not because we share a similar life experience.) You have shown yourself to be a very thoughtful & well-spoken person. This experience may seem eternal, but you will grow from it. Hang in there. All I want to add is that romantic relationships can be highly over-rated. Hold out for a person you know in your deepest being that you can spend your life with.\n\nCelestina - I get to be #5.

I'm coming a little late to your post, but there was great advice all the way around. I am a little *cough* older than you (I only say that because even now I kind of hate advice that begins \"In my day...\"), but much of what you said reminds me of age 19 for me. Let me just tell you that it wasn't until that time that I made any real friends. These days, not only am I still in touch with my college friends, we now live around one another and see each other on a regular basis. I know it does little good to say \"things will get better,\" but they will.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nPadfoot - Jul 14, 2004 8:41 am (#720 of 2955)\n\nPadfoot and Celestina, is that Brainerd as in the movie Fargo?\n\nYes, as Mike has said, it is the same Brainerd don't cha know. Actually I heard no one talking like that while there. Of course I was surrounded by family that was from the South most of the time.\n\nHappy Birthday to Daisy! Give her a hug from us Catherine.\n\nI want to get on the bandwagon and thank the hosts and moderators too. I realized last night I have only been on this forum for about 4 months and yet I feel very comfortable with this family atmosphere. This is such a wonderful place, with supportive and caring people.

Even though I had very good friends then (and most of them still are!), I always feared every minute I wasn't with my friends because I was afraid someone would make fun of me (this happened a lot in the early years). I was also afraid of speaking up in class and things like that. I feared talking to people besides my friends because I thought they would not want my companionship. At one point (maybe 4 or 5 years ago) people stopped making fun of me but it took me years to become more self-confident but I have greatly improved this year and now I don't care that much what other people are thinking of me. I also have not so much trouble anymore speaking with people I don't or only hardly know. But I have to stress that I have always had good friends and I still have. I don't know why exactly I have become more self-confident but I know that the forum here has been helping me a lot, too. About a year ago, I was embarrassed to say that I read and like HP. About half a year ago I was embarrassed to say that I'm reading on this forum. Now I'm showing everyone my HP socks and tell them more about HP than they ever wanted to know *evil grin*.\n\nAs for boys, that's a complete different chapter. I've never had a date, a boyfriend or a real kiss or anything like that. To top that I have a best friend who is the most beautiful girl in my class and has more admirers than she likes who do almost everything for her (including falling on their knees in the middle of the school(one guy), admiring her for two years and losing at least 20kg of weight in a few weeks (another guy)). And another guy told me quite some time how sweet she is. Sometimes it's really hard not becoming jealous but she the best friend in the world (Budapest) and she hasn't asked for all that admiration and is very uncomftable with it (Budapest!!!). As for me not having a boyfriend, I just tell myself that one day I'll have one, seeing as most people around me have one, too. And I also try not to think about it too much, it's less depressing then.\n\nI hope I haven't bored you too much (here's my inferiority-complex again) and I hope sharing my thoughts could help anyone a bit. One thing was that I always tried to be friendly to everyone so that people were thinking good of me. I can't add more than everyone else said. And I think it's good, Ozy, that you shared your feelings with all of us. This shows that you aren't that isolated you think you are, even though this is only on the internet.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nmischa fan - Jul 14, 2004 12:54 pm (#723 of 2955)\n\nJulia: I'm a Yankee fan from Connecticut\n\nJulia, does that make you a Connecticut Yankee?\n\n_____________________________________\n\nSherbie Lemon - Jul 14, 2004 3:25 pm (#724 of 2955)\n\nEdited by S.E. Jones Sep 8, 2004 8:15 pm\n\nOzy, hang in there. I promise it gets better. Often you're better off without a boyfriend than with one, as they can be the cause of many headaches. Sometimes you find that if you've had too many, or have too many guy friends, you feel as though you are being used, or that the inner you is not valued or appreciated. In many cases, girls who have a lot of admirers or who have had a lot of boyfriends feel as badly (sometimes worse) about themselves as those who are single.\n\nWhen I reached my sophmore year of high school, all my friends graduated. I was left with my best friend and my boyfriend. It was pretty lonely, especially as I was in honors courses and my companions were not. We even had different lunch hours so we never ate together. Like you, I was always more comfortable in smaller groups. That changed however, when I withdrew from high school to do correspondence classes and broke-up with my lousy boyfriend. I met a girl at work who had gone to a rival school, and she introduced me to her large group of friends. I connected with them at once, in fact, my future husband was one of the members of my new circle of friends!\n\nI've told you all this to say that sometimes forcing yourself to be around a group that you are unfamiliar with can pay off immeasurably. The first time I was invited out with Kelli and her friends, I almost declined, but eventually decided that I had nothing to lose and went. I had the time of my life that night and am still in touch with that group today. As Septentrion said, life is full of risks. Many of them pay off beyond your wildest dreams, many end in heartache. But you'll never know how a risk will end until you take it. And the pay offs far outweigh the heartaches.\n\nGina, thanks for the Snape drink and the congrats! Our housewarming party will be in August; hope you and Severus (and everyone else on the forum) can apparate down for the occasion! Originally we hadn't planned on having one, as we've amassed more stuff over our years living together than we need. However everyone keeps asking when it will be, so we decided we'd have one, but request that no one bring anything...except beer of course.\n\nWelcome back, Viola Intonada!

Thanks, everybody!\n\nJust for the record, most people in Minnesota don't actually talk with the Minnesotan accent you might hear in movies or on TV. The example I'm thinking of here is the movie Drop Dead Gorgeous, which is set in MN; I watched it once and spent the whole movie thinking \"We do NOT talk like that\". We do refer to drinks such as Pepsi or Mt. Dew as \"pop\", not \"soda\", but that's not just us, it's a Midwestern thing.\n\nOzy, you made that (the phoenix)?

When you're done, they varnish it, bake it and you can go home with your masterpiece. ^_^\n\nMay you give me more hint of what's your family like to do while in vacation?\n\nThat's all for tonight, I'll be back tomorrow with a more ready-to-work brain. ^_^\n\n_____________________________________\n\nThe giant squid - Jul 14, 2004 9:51 pm (#731 of 2955)\n\nFlame Alligator: Be warned--on the promo material for I, Robot it says, \"Suggested by the book by Isaac Asimov.\" (italics mine) The story has been heavily Hollywood-ized. Not that we have any experience with that sort of thing...\n\nMike, are you sure you don't talk like that, because when I moved to SD no one here thought they had an accent either?\n\nNo, Ticker, I actually don't. Even when I lived there I managed to refrain from the \"ya know\"s and \"you betcha\"s. Top that with three years living in Georgia, another three in southern California and closing in on three here in Nevada, and I'd say my accent is sufficiently neutral--or at least so thoroughly muddled as to be undefineable.\n\nMy sisters, on the other hand... :pcpb:\n\n--Mike\n\n_____________________________________\n\nMrs. Sirius - Jul 14, 2004 10:37 pm (#732 of 2955)\n\nTomoe, it's hard to say what my family likes to do on vacation as this is the first time since my son was born that we have partaken in that sort of activity together. Sunshine Don't be afraid we are only but so rowdy.\n\nMy husband doesn't change much however, he likes to read, read and read. So I know we will be looking for book stores. We do like to sample the everyday sort of things, rather than the extravaganzas. So we'll walk around town a lot I'm sure. There are 2 activities just heard about, a Merengue festival and a dragon boat race, we'll probably go to those events.\n\nWe are a bit bohemian so walking around Greenwich Village in New York, hanging out at the park was about our speed. I guess visiting parks where people just hang out and street fairs, (food fairs are the best) are the things we would like to see like Interesting libraries, the underground walk ways. Basic everyday life kinds of things, and of course at least one nice restaurant that is family friendly.\n\nThanks for the tip on the clay house my kids do love that so we'll certainly put that on our itinerary.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nAkaisha - Jul 14, 2004 11:31 pm (#733 of 2955)\n\nEdited by Denise P.

Anyway, I watched Clemens on Leno the other night, and he was saying that everyone in NY was cool with him going to wherever he went (Houston?) and I was sitting there thinking 'hmmm, that doesn't seem right'...so twas lovely to read a real live Yankee fan's reaction to his performance in the All Star game, hehe.\n\nAkaisha, do make sure you check out the long and winding journey that is the Snape thread...packed full of Severusy goodness, it is.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nseptentrion - Jul 15, 2004 12:37 am (#735 of 2955)\n\nthanks for the Bastille day congrats.

This wouldn't be so bad, if the streets of my city weren't all torn up. The city is replacing all the large pipes for the main water line and gas lines. Uh! This means when I walk to work I have a maze to go through and it changes every few days. Plus, there is a preponderance of dust and dirt in the air. I take my frustrations out on the Pilates students, lunch time housewives. I work them EXTRA hard. Hey, I have to amuse myself somehow.

The tannic acid in the tea helps if you can do this in the first few hours. Then you need to follow up with the aloe vera gel.\n\nFlame, we've been having summer thunderstorms here too. I've shut down the computer and pulled the modem several times because of all the lightning.

I don't want to start any guy-bashing here - but really - what's the deal with the mid-life crisis?\n\nAnyway, I'm not looking for well-wishes or sympathy, I just wanted to agree with what people have said previously. This is a wonderfully supportive family. Just being able to type this is making me feel better. You all are great!\n\nOzy- Hang in there. You've been given some great advice. If you follow even some of it and keep your same positive attitude - you'll do great!\n\nAnna- As a self-proclaimed sunburn expert (blonde hair, blue eyed kid who loved playing outdoors - need I say more?). I recommend liberal amounts of lotion. Any kind you can get your hands on, although aloe or Vitamin E enriched is best. Apply as many time a day as you can - at least 2 or 3. And don't stop when the burn goes away. Do it for a couple of weeks. That's the best way to prevent a peel. For the pain - an aloe gel works great. And for the future - use sunblock!\n\nFlame - Sorry to hear about all the rain and construction. Here's a rainbow for you: Maybe things will calm down over the weekend. Sounds like its about your turn to have someone teach your classes for a week!\n\nThe weather here has finally cooled down a bit. At least the heat index was below 100 yesterday. I am hoping for a cool weekend so that I can get some flowers planted.\n\nEveryone have a great day!\n\n_____________________________________\n\nFlame Alligator - Jul 15, 2004 6:59 am (#746 of 2955)\n\nAnna, Might I add that if you happen to know someone with an aloe plant, all the better. The fresh gel from the plant tongues works even faster. Once cut, just wrap in foil and keep it in the refrigerator between applications.\n\nHey Mollis.\n\nAkaisha, Where does that name come from? Is it by chance from Anne Rice's character in Queen of the Damned? I love Akasha from the movie of the same name. When she is angry, she sets people a flame. I love that!\n\n_____________________________________\n\nAccio Sirius - Jul 15, 2004 7:02 am (#747 of 2955)\n\nCelestina, I'm originally from Pittsburgh and they say \"pop\" too for sodas and cokes. They also say \"yins\" which is some strange contraction of you ins or yous "
