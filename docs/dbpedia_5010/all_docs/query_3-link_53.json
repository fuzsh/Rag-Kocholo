        "text": "Abstract\n\nAmerican broadcasting, unique among media industries, relied on sponsors and their ad agencies for program content from the 1920s through the 1950s. Some sponsors broadcast educational or culturally uplifting programs to burnish their corporate images. By the mid-1960s, however, commercial broadcasting had transformed, and advertisers could only buy interstitial minutes for interrupting commercials, during which they wooed cynical consumers with entertaining soft-sell appeals. The midcentury shifts in institutional power in US broadcasting among corporate sponsors, advertising agencies, and radio/television networks reflected a fundamental shift in beliefs about how to use broadcasting as an advertising medium.\n\nType\n\nResearch Article\n\nCopyright\n\nCopyright © The President and Fellows of Harvard College 2021\n\nAccess options\n\nGet access to the full version of this content by using one of the access options below.

This commission was putatively charged to the media outlet. For example, if the newspaper charged $100 for ad space to an advertiser, the agency “billed” the advertiser $100 but only forwarded $85 to the publisher. Agency sizes were measured by the amount of annual “billings” to media outlets. On radio, agencies not only earned a commission on airtime but also usually charged a percentage of talent and production costs as well.\n\n25\n\n25 Fox, Mirror Makers, 158.\n\n26\n\n26 Meyers, Word from Our Sponsor, 167.\n\n27\n\n27 Meyers, Word from Our Sponsor, 208–24.\n\n28\n\n28 Advertising Agency Executive, “When Will Radio Quit Selling Its ‘Editorial Pages’?” Advertising & Selling, 22 July 1931, 17–18.
