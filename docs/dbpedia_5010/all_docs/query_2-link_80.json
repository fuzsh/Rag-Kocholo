        "text": "Not to be confused with the real RTVM, which is a state-owned Philippine TV channel and abbreviated as Radio Television Malacañang￼￼￼￼\n\nRadio Television Malichka (RTVM) (Slovene: Radiotelevizija Malička) (Chinese: 馬麗基亞廣播電視有限公司) is the public media service in Malichka. Founded 1945 as Radio Malička, it's the oldest broadcaster in Malichka. As a government department under the Ministry of Broadcasting and Culture and Parliament, RTVM's educational, entertainment, and public affairs programmes are broadcast on its ten radio channels and fourteen television channels. Unlike other public broadcasters like the BBC and NHK, which are primarily funded by licence fees, RTVM is directly supported by annual government funding. The network has its own film production division, founded in 1985.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe Malichkan Government launched its first radio broadcasting station, known as \"RK\" (Radio Kralj), on 1st June 1945, with a starting staff of only six people. Several name changes occurred over the next few years, and it eventually became known as \"Radio Malichka\" (RM) (馬麗基亞廣播電台) in 1948.\n\nIn 1946, broadcasting operations were taken over by the Parliament Information Services (PIS), but by 1948, Radio Malichka had managed to establish itself as an independent department. Up until 1955, the radio station was only on-air for three periods during the day; at morning, lunchtime, and evening. This was partly due to many of the presenters being part-time freelancers who had to fit their radio appearances in with their normal daily working schedule.\n\nIn 1959, the station's medium wave AM transmitting station was moved from a waterfront site in Hirbismrekovi to the summit of Golden Hill in Triborove state. Although the new transmitters were much more powerful, the mountain-top site proved unsuitable for medium wave transmissions and reception in some areas has remained problematic ever since. At the same time, RTVM introduced its trademark symbol - the \"telesova/radiosova\", a stylized bluebird with big eyes and a small beak, which was later reused by Finnish television channel MTV 16 years later. In March 1962, RM moved its headquarters to new purpose-built studios located at Broadcasting House in Dvoreki, Smrekavoda. The facility was later reused by Smrekavoda Broadcasting Corporation after they moved in 1986.\n\nA Television Production Unit was established in 1961 to produce TV programmes for required broadcast by independent channels. At that time, RM did not have its own television broadcast transmitters. Four years later in 1965, RTVM launched its three television channels: 1 (Slovene-language programming), 2 (Cantonese-language programming), 3 (English-language programming) and 4 (programming in Nordic languages)\n\nIn 1973, RTVM set up its own radio newsroom. Prior to this, all news had been prepared by the Parliament Information Services staff. Until 1969, headlines were sent to the studios every half-hour by teleprinter from the PIS headquarters in Central District, while the three daily full bulletins were hand-delivered by a messenger. This arrangement became impractical following the move to the new studios in 1962, so initially a PIS newsroom was set up in Broadcasting House. This arrangement also proved unsatisfactory and RTVM's own journalists, who until then had been confined to producing magazine programmes, took over the entire news operation.\n\nIn 1981, the station's name was changed to \"Radio Television Malichka\" (RTVM) after the merger of Radio Malichka and TV Malichka. In 1986, RTVM headquarters moved across the road to the former Post Office Building, which was renamed Television Palace. The station's first News and Financial News channel, RM8, was established in 1989.\n\nIn 1990 RTVM trialed an HDTV channel after 15 years of research and internal experimentation. The project, titled \"HDTV-MH\", was tested in all nine states of Malichka. The test was successful and Malichka was credited with having the oldest working system of high-definition television. RTVM also set up a satellite service the same year, which was called \"EntertainmentStation\". The service was first tested in Smrekavoda state. It provided three channels - ES Kids, ES News and ES Main.\n\nIn July 1997, RTVM launched its website and made its television productions, as well as content from its seven radio channels, available online. The website provided live broadcasts as well as a twelve-month archive (with the exception of MHCEE and MHALE broadcasts in TVM 2 due to copyright issues with the Malichkan Examinations and Assessment Authority). The website, presented in English, Slovene, Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese, initially offered free news via email three times per day, as well as online content.\n\nIn 1998, EntertainmentStation went bankrupt and had its assets liquidated into RTVM Satellite Networks. It formed a joint venture with Malichka Telecom, the country's incumbent telco, which was renamed EntertainmenTown. It provided three channels: Prime, Live, Cine and Extra.\n\nIn 2008, a rival channel, Channel M, by Malichka Press, was founded. In 2012, after filing for bankruptcy, Malichka Press Television agreed to merge with RTVM. Malichka Press Television later merged all of its operations into RTVM in 2013, while Channel M closed down in accordance with the merger. The resulting company from the merger was called RTVM Media Holding.\n\nAt the same time, RTVM trialed and launched nine digital-only television channels. To support this new television operation, the government administration increased the station's funding by between MH$300 million and MH$400 million a year. In April 2014, RTVM 1 took over the analogue channel frequency of Channel M after the latter's free television license expired.\n\nIn March 2017, as the Malichkan government decided to terminate DAB services in the country, RTVM said that it would integrate the existing DAB programmes into existing AM and FM radio channels. As the government claimed that RTVM should stop DAB service within six months, that means DAB service will be terminated no later than 30 September 2017.\n\nWith the termination of DAB+ in Malichka, RTVM has announced in August 2017 that the broadcaster's relay of China National Radio on RM7 would reduce to 8 hours a day and move to an overnight slot on Radio 4; Radio 7 would instead relay Radio Malichka, owned by RTV Slovenia.\n\nThey supported the King of Malichka during the 2018 civil conflict. Like in the 1990-91 conflict they provided full coverage of the conflict until its end. The channel was shut down for 6 months in 2017 by then-Prime Minister Marko Dugandžić in order to free up space for setting up Bjergsen propaganda. The channel, Bjergsen Television, never generated any revenue, and had to shut down after filing for bankruptcy.\n\nNames in the Malichkan languages[]\n\nSlovene: Radiotelevizija Malička\n\nEnglish: Radio Television Malichka\n\nChinese: 馬麗基亞廣播電視有限公司\n\nBosnian: Radio Televizija Malihča\n\nCroatian: Radiotelevizija Maličija\n\nSerbian: Радио Телевизија Mалички/Radio Televizija Malički\n\nMontenegrin: Radiotelevizija Maličije\n\nCzech: Rozhlatelevíze Maliskia\n\nSlovak: Rozhlatelevizia Malisko\n\nItalian: Radiotelevisione Madenia\n\nAlbanian: Radio Televizioni Maliçarrë\n\nHungarian: Maliszági rádió és televízió\n\nRomanian: Radioteleviziunea Malishki\n\nNorwegian: Rikskringkasting Malieken\n\nSwedish: Radiotelevision Mälieken\n\nDanish: Radio Television Malikin\n\nFinnish: Radiotelevisio Mälidia\n\nIcelandic: Ríkisútvarpið Maliðlánd\n\nRadio channels[]\n\nRadio 1 (99.3 FM/1029 AM in Smrekavoda and Devetzmajev, 98.5 in other states): General programming, news and current affairs (Slovene)\n\nRadio 2 (99.3 FM/1028 AM in Smrekavoda and Devetzmajev, 98.5 in other states): General programming, news and current affairs (Cantonese)\n\nRadio 3 (99.3 FM in Smrekavoda and Devetzmajev, 98.8 in Svetijurij, 97.9 in Zahodni Otoki, 96.8 in other states): News, popular music, talk radio, educational programming (English, additional programs in Scots and Welsh)\n\nRadio 4 (99.3 FM in Smrekavoda): Classical and folk music, fine arts programming, simulcast of China National Radio (Primarily Slovene, secondary programs in Mandarin)\n\nRadio 5 (100.6 FM in Smrekavoda, 99.2 in Devetzmajev, 97.9 in Zahodni Otoki, and 97.6 in Triborove): Children's programmes, live Chinese opera streaming, radio drama, educational programming (Cantonese and other Chinese languages)\n\nRadio 6 (100.9 FM nationwide): Programming targeted at children and elderly, radio drama, educational programming, cultural programming (Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Finnish)\n\nRadio 7 (101.2 FM nationwide): 24-hour relay of Radio Malichka (owned by RTV Slovenia) (Slovene)\n\nRadio 8 (98.3 FM nationwide): News, current affairs, talk and finance (Slovene)\n\nRadio 9 (99.7 FM nationwide): Multicultural programming (Croatian, Bosnian, Serbian, Hungarian, Italian, Albanian, Montenegrin, Romanian, Czech, Slovak)\n\nRadio X (99.6 FM nationwide): Contemporary hits, gaming commentary, gaming podcasts (Primarily English, secondary programs in Slovene)\n\nTelevision channels[]\n\nOver-the-air[]\n\nRTVM 1/Spinel: A general family entertainment and information channel.
