        "text": "Theatre in Croatia refers to the history of the performing arts in Croatia, or theatrical performances written, acted and produced by Croatians. Croatian theatre generally falls into the Western theatre tradition, with influences especially from Italy, Germany, Austria and other European nations.\n\nCroatian theatre dates back at least as far as the Middle Ages, with a combination of religious liturgical dramas, and secular performances of travelling entertainers. During the Renaissance, there was a flowering of dramatic writing and performances in Dalmatia, especially in Dubrovnik and on the island of Hvar. Notable playwrights of the time were Marin Držić and Hanibal Lucić.\n\nIn other parts of Croatia, theatres started to appear in the late 18th, early 19th century in cities such as Split, Dubrovnik, Šibenik, Zadar, Osijek, Varaždin, Pula, Rijeka, and Zagreb. The development of a Croatian National Theatre evolved from Zagreb's first city theatre on St Mark's Square. Beginning in the 1860s, performances were increasingly written and given in Croatian.\n\nToday, Croatia boasts a strong tradition of theatres and theatrical companies all round the country. Performances range from dramas and musicals for adults or children, youth theatre and puppet theatre. Croatia is also home to the world's oldest Theatre of the Blind. Festivals are held in several locations in the summer.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nClassical\n\n[edit]\n\nThe very first theatre venues in today's Croatia were built during the Roman period. The remains of a Classical theatre can be seen in ancient Salona near Split, and in Pula there are remains of a smaller Roman theatre, both dating from the 1st century.[1]\n\nMedieval plays\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first evidence of theatrical performances in Croatia refers to liturgical scenes that formed part of the mass celebration in medieval churches. Mostly anonymous and initially only Latin texts, they presented dialogues between biblical or saintly characters. At first these were sung or chanted by priests, but later by lay people at the altar or in parts of the church that served as a stage.[2] In the oldest ritual of the Zagreb Cathedral from the 11th century, two Latin liturgical dramas have been preserved, the Easter Visitatio sepulchri and the Epiphany Tractus stellae, and in the Vrbnica Missal from 1462 there is a fragment written in Glagolitic in the Old Church Slavonic Croatian edition.[3] From these liturgical scenes, other secular religious dramas developed: miracles (legends of the saints), passion (sufferings of Jesus and the saints), and morality (Christian teaching).[3][4]\n\nAlong with the liturgical dramas, there were secular performances, associated with travelling musicians and entertainers who would perform at public events such as weddings, church holidays, or carnival processions.[2]\n\nRenaissance theatre\n\n[edit]\n\nThe renaissance saw the first organized theatrical events given by named authors, mostly in the literary centres of Dubrovnik and Hvar, but also to some extent in Korčula and in public performances in Zagreb (in Latin). The Renaissance theatre brought a flourishing of dramatic literature.\n\nBorn in Dubrovnik, then known as the Republic of Ragusa, Marin Držić is considered to be one of the finest renaissance authors in Croatian literature[5] His work covers many fields: lyric poetry, pastorals, political letters and pamphlets, and comedies. While his pastorals (Tirena, Venera i Adon and Plakir) are still highly regarded as masterful examples of the genre, his comedies are among the best in European Renaissance literature.[6] Držić's comedies are full of exuberant life and vitality, celebrating love, liberty and sincerity and mocking avarice, egoism and petty tyrants — both in the family and in the state.[7] His best-known comedies include: Pomet (1548 or 1553), Novela od Stanca (1550), Dundo Maroje (1551 or 1556) – his best-known play which was also performed abroad, and Skup (1554)\n\nMeanwhile, in Hvar, another important author of the Croatian renaissance was Hanibal Lucić who, as well as poetry, also wrote Robinja (The Slave Girl being the first secular play in Croatian literature). Also writing drama around this time were authors such as Mavro Vetranović, Nikola Nalješković, Martin Benetović, Dinko Zlatarić. The influence of Italian theatre was strong, which can be seen in the themes of the plays and the theatrical terminology. New, specially built indoor stages gave the actors more space to move around, and scenic backdrops introduced, suitable for tragic, comic or pastoral dramas. Some amateur theatre companies were founded.[2]\n\nIn 1610, the oldest public theatre in Europe was opened in Hvar. Earlier Italian theatres such as the Teatro Olimpico in Vicenza (1584) were privately built, while the Hvar theatre, added as part of the reconstruction works to the Arsenal building, was financed by the commune for the people of Hvar.[4] Modified over the years, it is still in existence serving the same purpose today.\n\nBaroque theatre\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the 17th century, theatrical performances were taking place throughout most of Croatia, but the main creative centre was still Dubrovnik. In addition to the old theatrical forms, new ones began to appear: melodrama and musical pastorals (Ivan Gundulić, Junije Palmotić) and te trionfe i anonimne komedije with influences of commedia dell'arte.\n\nMusic now took an increasing role, and some performances could almost be called operas. New stage design allowed for improved decor, costumes, and lighting, and even an increased number of performers. The equipment became more complex, and fantastic new stage effects designed for specific performances: mountains and seas which could be dismantled, angels or monsters would appear and disappear, gods come down from heaven. More demanding performances called for printed manuals (translated from the original Italian) to deal with the dynamic equipment and lighting fixtures.[2]\n\nOne of the leading figures of the Dubrovnik literary scene was Ivan Gundulić, whose most famous play is Dubravka, a pastoral written in 1628, where he rhapsodises on the former glory of Dubrovnik and it contains some of the most famous verses in Croatian literature:\n\nAge of Enlightenment\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the 18th and early 19th centuries, performances took place in various venues and there was an increasingly professional approach to theatre. The lavishness of the Baroque performances continued with elaborate costumes and inventive stage solutions. The first theatrical programs were printed, and more cities were involved in theatrical life (Split, Trogir, Šibenik, Zadar, Senj, Rijeka, and Karlovac). Dubrovnik was still the core of dramatic creativity, but there was less original dramatic writing. In the northern part of Croatia, most of the theatrical productions were connected with the schools of certain priestly orders, for example the Jesuits in Zagreb, Varaždin, Požega, Osijek, and Rijeka, the Franciscans in Osijek, Slavonski Brod, and Vukovar, and the Paulines in Senj.\n\nOne of the first performances that was explicitly performed in Croatian was \"Cyrus in solium vocatur\" (Cirus Called to the Throne) in 1766.[2]\n\nZagreb's first public theatre hall was part of the Kulmer-Pejačević palace, which is now the Croatian Natural History Museum at Demetrova 1. It had many of the characteristics of a public theatre, including tickets and publicity leaflets. Operating from 1797 to 1834, it was known as Amadeo's theatre after Count Antal Amade de Várkony county prefect of Zagreb. The theatre was rented exclusively to German companies, but in 1832 and 1833 German actors also performed several plays in Kajkavian.[8]\n\nNationalism and city theatres\n\n[edit]\n\nAt the turn of the 19th century, dramatic performances in the Kajkavian dialect flourished, with the most important author being Tituš Brezovački, who wrote («Matijaš grabancijaš dijak», «Diogeneš»).[2] In Dubrovnik, 23 plays by Molière were translated and performed, still unusual at the time. The best drama written in Croatian during the 18th century was \"Kate Kapuralica\" by Vlaha Stulli.\n\nThe beginning of the nineteenth century is also marked by the strong influence of German theatre, which can be seen in the theatrical terminology of the time, but also in the increasingly professional work habits and organization. Many Croatian actors and theatre workers gained their experience by watching guest performances by German theatre companies or they would travel to Germany and Austria to learn at first hand.\n\nIn 1834, the first real theatre space was opened on St. Mark's Square in Zagreb.[9] The golden age of construction of theatre halls in Croatia came between 1859 and 1895, when large theatres were built in Split, Dubrovnik, Šibenik, Zadar, Osijek, Varaždin, Pula, Rijeka and Zagreb.[1] Following that, theatrical life in Croatia gradually became more professionalized and despite a number of political and material difficulties, a single national theatre was formed, primarily due to the efforts of Dimitrije Demeter, August Šenoa and Stjepan Miletić.[10]\n\nZagreb's first purpose-built city theatre was Stanković's Theatre (also known as the Old Theatre or the Theatre on St. Mark's Square). It was built by the merchant Kristofor Stanković, who had won 30,000 ducats in the Vienna lottery in 1833.[9] He intended to rent the building to foreign companies, and it also contained a ballroom, which hosted a number of important sessions of the Parliament of Croatia.[11]\n\nThe builders were father and son, Christofor and Anton Cragnolini. The theatre was designed with three rows of boxes surrounding the auditorium, and could accommodate more than 750 patrons. The stage covered approximately 200 m2, and at the same time served as a storage for the scenery backdrops. The orchestra was placed on a level with the audience. Lighting was originally candles, then from 1864 by gaslight, and after 1894 by electricity.[9]\n\nThe first play, Körner's play Niklas Graf von Zriny, was performed by a German troupe on October 4, 1834.[9] German and Italian theatrical troupes performed, but beginning in 1860, only Croatian plays were performed. Croatian was first heard in the theatre during an intermezzo of a German production, when Ljudevit Gaj's reveille \"Još Hrvatska ni propala\" was performed, and the first play in Croatian, the Juran and Sofia or The Turks under Sisak: Heroic Play in Three Acts (Juran i Sofia ili Turci kod Siska: junačka igra u trih činih) by Ivan Kukuljević Sakcinski, was performed there on 10 June 1840. The first Croatian opera, Love and Malice (Ljubav i zloba) by Vatroslav Lisinski, was also performed there on 28 March 1846.\n\nDimitrije Demeter, author of the patriotic epic \"Grobničko polje\" (Grobnik Plain) in 1842, laid the foundation for a new Croatian theatre, as manager and writer. His most important dramatic work \"Teuta\" (1844) draws on Illyrian history. Other writers of the time are Antun Nemčić, author of a drama called \"Kvas bez kruha\" (Yeast without bread). Ivan Kukuljević Sakcinski was a politician, scientist, historian, and the first writer of plays based on more recent Croatian literature: \"Juran i Sofija\" (1839).\n\nThe old theatre building was badly damaged in the great earthquake of 1880, and in 1881 the Croatian Parliament voted to construct a new theatre.[12] The last performance was held in the old theatre on June 16, 1895.[9] After the interior was renovated in 1895, the building was given a new administrative purpose as the City Hall, while the theatre moved to the new Fellner-Helmer building in the lower town that we know today as the Croatian National Theatre.[9]\n\nIn the late 19th century, Ivo Vojnović captivated the public with plays such as \"Ekvinocij\" (Equinox, 1895). Although his early works dealt with cosmopolitan themes, Dubrovnik remained his major inspiration especially in \"Dubrovačka trilogija\" (Dubrovnik Trilogy, 1903). In that work, the subject relates to realism, although the technique and inspiration is entirely modernist.\n\nTwo other very successful playwrights of the time were Milan Ogrizović and Josip Kosor. Ogrizović used themes from folk songs in works such as (\"Hasanaginica\"), and he also wrote passionate dramas (\"Vučina\", 1921), while Kosor is best known for his dramatic \"Požar strasti\" (Fire of Passion, 1912).\n\nModern times\n\n[edit]\n\nThe growth of theatrical art in Croatia entailed the opening of new theatre venues throughout the 20th century, many of them within the adapted buildings of former cinemas and cultural centres. This trend continued to the end of the 20th and beginning of the 21st century, when several new theatre venues were opened in Zagreb (Small Stage Theatre, EXIT Theatre, Histrion House), and a number of existing venues have been reconstructed and adapted.[1]\n\nTheatres and theatrical companies\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Croatian National Theatre and other theatres around Croatia.\n\nCroatian National Theatre\n\n[edit]\n\nCroatian National Theatre (Croatian: Hrvatsko narodno kazalište) is the official name of all the state-funded theatre houses in Croatia. Each one is commonly referred to by the Croatian-language initials HNK. The Croatian National Theatre was established in 1860, and in 1861 it gained government support putting it on par with many other European national theatres. As part of that, new theatres were built in Zadar (1865), Dubrovnik (1865), Osijek (1866), Šibenik (1870), Varaždin (1873), Rijeka (1885) and Split (1893). The theatre buildings in the biggest cities (Zagreb, Split, Rijeka, Osijek and Varaždin) are considered the premier theatre and opera houses in the country.\n\nCroatian National Theatre in Zagreb\n\n[edit]\n\nWith the increasing demands on Zagreb's old theatre in St Mark's Square, it was decided to build a larger theatre to accommodate the new artistic and technical requirements. So in 1895 the Croatian National Theatre moved to a new purpose-built building on Republic of Croatia Square in Zagreb's Lower Town, where it is based today. The Austro-Hungarian emperor Franz Joseph I was at the unveiling of this new building during his visit to the city in 1895.[13] The new building was the project of famed Viennese architects Ferdinand Fellner and Herman Helmer, whose firm had built several theatres in Vienna. Celebrations marking the 100th anniversary of the building were held on October 14, 1995.\n\nThe auditorium has seating for 809 patrons, including the parterre, two tiers of boxes and a balcony. The Croatian National Theatre has three ensembles: a drama company founded in 1860, opera established in 1870, and ballet first formed in 1894. In principle, the drama and opera repertoires are focused on classical pieces and well-known pieces by contemporary authors. The ballet ensemble also leans towards a more classical repertoire, but also sometimes includes contemporary dance.[1]\n\nCroatian National Theatre in Split\n\n[edit]\n\nOriginally opened in 1893, the Croatian National Theatre in Split is owned and operated by the City of Split and is one of the oldest surviving theatres in Dalmatia. When first opened, the auditorium that could accommodate 1,000 with three tiers of boxes, a gallery and parterre circle. The building was designed by Emilio Veccietti and Ante Bezić, whose approach was that of historical eclecticism. Following a fire in 1970, major renovations were need to reconstruct parts of the original building (the front façade, the atrium, and the foyer) while a new west wing was added. The main theatre now has seating for 660, and there is an additional chamber stage, called Stage 55 (Scena 55).[1]\n\nAfter an initial attempt to establish a theatrical company in 1898, it was not until 1920 that Split's first professional ensemble was founded. Although it only ran for 8 years, the drama and opera ensembles resumed again in 1945, and in 1952 they were joined by a ballet ensemble. Today all three produce rich and diverse repertoires, both classical and contemporary. The drama and the opera ensembles are particularly dedicated to working with authors from the Mediterranean cultural scene.[1]\n\nSince 1954, the Croatian National Theatre has been organizing the Split Summer Festival, with productions by all three ensembles contributing to the festival's program. Also, since 1992, the Croatian National Theatre in Split has been organizing Marulić Days – Festival of Croatian Drama.\n\nCroatian National Theatre in Rijeka\n\n[edit]\n\nThe building of the Croatian National Theatre in Rijeka was designed by renowned Viennese architects Ferdinand Fellner and Hermann Helmer, and opened in 1885. The exterior of this luxurious theatre building featured a renaissance style façade with six columns and gable roof, while the interior was designed in a late-baroque style. The main theatre contains a parterre, three tiers of boxes and a balcony, providing seating for 600. The building was completely renovated in the 1970s.[1]\n\nFor the first 60 years, the venue mainly hosted visiting theatrical troupes, primarily for opera performances. Then in 1946, the building gained its own resident Croatian and Italian drama, opera and ballet ensembles. All provide an extensive and diverse repertoire, including domestic and international classics from literature and music, contemporary pieces right up to a lighter entertainment productions. In 2004 the theatre became a co-organizer of the Rijeka Summer Festival.\n\nCroatian National Theatre in Osijek\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Croatian National Theatre in Osijek was designed by Karl Krausner and built in 1866 in a in historic style with elements of Moorish architecture. The building originally also housed a casino and ballroom on the first floor. With the establishment of a professional theatrical ensemble in 1907, there were plans for a new building to accommodate their needs. This never happened, and despite several attempts at reconstruction, it was only in 1945 when the casino and a wing of the neighbouring hotel became available that the existing venue was able to support their needs.[1] Following severe damage in the homeland war of 1992–1994, the building was again completely reconstructed. Today, the horse-shoe shaped auditorium contains a parterre and three tiers of boxes and provides seating for 420 patrons.\n\nSince its founding in 1907, the theatrical company has maintained diverse drama and music repertoires, which they often take on tour. They are the second largest national theatre ensemble, and as of 2005, the theatre also houses a permanent dance group.\n\nCroatian National Theatre in Varaždin\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Croatian National Theatre in Varaždin was built in 1873 by Zagreb-based builder Janko Jambrišak according to the awarded design by Viennese architect, Hermann Helmer, who also personally supervised the construction. This was his first theatre project, and together with Ferdinand Fellner, he would go on to build fifty theatres across Europe between 1873 and 1916. With its harmonious neo-renaissance façade, the building was designed to serve as both a theatre and concert hall. The central theatre hall has a 370-seat auditorium with a parterre, two tiers of boxes and a balcony. The building also houses a separate concert hall and a small chamber hall in the basement, which was added in 1956. The Varaždin theatre housed its first theatre company in 1915–1923, and the Croatian National Theatre was established in 1945. The theatre maintains a diverse repertoire with a special focus on premieres of new pieces written by Croatian playwrights, as well as pieces written by authors from Central Europe. A specialty of the theatre is its adaptations of classical pieces in the local dialect and at times experimental theatre. On top of maintaining a standard repertoire, the Croatian National Theatre also permanently produces puppet and children's theatre pieces[1][14]\n\nCroatian National Theatre in Šibenik\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Croatian National Theatre in Šibenik was opened in 1870, financed and built by local citizens through the Šibenik Theatre Society, which was set up for the purpose in 1864.[15] The auditorium follows the plan of the Teatro Fenice in Venice, while the architectural style is an eclectic mix of renaissance, romanic and gothic features as designed by Josip Slade from Trogir. Decorative elements in the main hall include allegoric scenes and figures of prominent citizens of Šibenik at the time. In the mid-20th century a long stone balcony was added to the eastern facade. Following severe damage in the homeland war in 1991, the theatre had to undergo a major reconstruction. The theatre hall presently has a parterre and three tiers of boxes with a 310-seat capacity. From 1945 to 1964, the Šibenik Theatre was home to an ensemble of the National Theatre Company which produced both drama and operetta repertoire. The venue has now a semi-professional ensemble, and serves as host for visiting performances.[1]\n\nCroatian National Theatre in Zadar\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Croatian National Theatre in Zadar was initially built in 1783 as the Teatro Nobile (Nobleman's Theatre). It was outfitted finely with an orchestra pit, parterre and four tiers of boxes. However, it was closed down in 1882, as it did not have an adequate fire system. The run-down building was later purchased by entrepreneur Aldo Meštović, who opened up a 1000-seat movie and variety theatre in 1924. Damaged by an air-strikes during the second world war, it underwent a major re-construction with a completely new theatre space, with its first professional drama ensemble. After further renovations over the years, the large hall now seats 650 patrons. The theatre has served mainly as a host venue for visiting drama and opera groups, but is gradually once again building up its own professional drama company.[1][16]\n\nCity and regional theatres\n\n[edit]\n\nGavella Drama Theatre in Zagreb was established in 1953 under the name Zagreb Drama Theatre. Comprising a set of young actors and directors under Branko Gavella, it was intended to be a second city theatre, creating a counter-point to the mainstream Croatian National Theatre.[17] The venue was originally built in 1916 as the Helios Cinema, then operated for a number of years as the Small Theatre, a second stage for the Croatian National Theatre. Following the most recent renovation in 1995, the theatre has a total of 389 seats on the floor and balcony. The company and the theatre are now known as the Gavella Drama Theatre. The theatre's repertoire is based on reinterpretations of classical drama pieces and contemporary pieces by both domestic and foreign authors. The theatre also hosts the Gavella Nights Festival, featuring a selection of the season's best productions from other Croatian theatres.[1]\n\nThe Kerempuh Satirical Theatre in Zagreb was originally founded in 1964, merging with the Varijete stage in 1971, thus gaining its own venue and ensemble. Their repertoire focuses mainly on classical and contemporary pieces that have a satirical content.[1] In 1994 the theatre was named for Petrica Kerempuh, the traditional folk jester/wise character from Croatian popular literature. The Kerempuh building dates from 1912, and was originally a cinema (Apollo, and later Croatia), converted to a theatre venue.
