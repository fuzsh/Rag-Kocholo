        "text": "What’s next starts with you\n\nAt Nielsen, we measure what content people watch and listen to. We have done this for more than 50 years. Most of our knowledge and data comes directly from people like you. We rely on real people to understand how audiences watch TV, stream and listen to music and podcasts.\n\nTo measure all of this, we ask people to be part of our panels. A panel is a small group that has the same traits (like race, gender, etc.) as a larger group of people. Some of our panels are made up of Nielsen Families, also known as Nielsen Homes or Nielsen Households. Nielsen Families are people who allow us to measure what they watch on TV and listen to on the radio. We take what we learn from them and produce the ratings.\n\nHow it works\n\nOur Nielsen representatives will give you everything you need to participate and help you get started. By viewing TV and streaming as you normally do—whether it’s a little or a lot—you’re letting us know what you like to watch. Your viewing information is carefully collected and sent to Nielsen, where it is combined with other participating households in your area and analyzed to get the Nielsen ratings. We share this information with the TV industry and media companies so they can program shows that people like you want to watch. And you’re even given thank-you gifts for participating.\n\nPrivacy principles\n\nYour contribution is important to us, and we protect your privacy. Nielsen will never use your personally identifiable information (such as your name, address, or email address) to advertise, promote or market third-party goods or services directly to you, and we use various methods to make sure that an individual cannot be identified in the reports that we create for our clients.
