        "text": "JAPAN - CROATIA,\n\nJEWELS\n\nDarko Zubrinic, Zagreb, 2005\n\nIf we measure the quality (and popularity) of haiku poetry by a number of international prizes, then Croatia can be ranked very high: immediately after Japan and the USA (1993, 1995). This is due to continuous efforts and enthusiasm of Vladimir Devidé (1925-2010), a well known Croatian mathematician and japanologist. He obtained a prestigeous Japanese \"Order of Sacred Treasure'' - Konsanto Zuihosho.\n\nOrder of the Sacred Treasure - Konsantõ Zuihôshõ, which Vladimir Devidé received from the Japanese Government in 1983\n\nJapanese Princess Michiko, wife of Crown Prince Akihito (in 1989 they became Empress and Emperor of Japan), receiving a gift from professor Vladimir Devidé in Cavtat near Dubrovnik, June 12th, 1976. The gift was his book Japanska haiku poezija i njen kulturno-povijesni okvir (Japanese Haiku Poetry and its Cultural and Historical Framework), issued in Zagreb in 1976, published in Croatian.\n\nHere is his haiku related to the aggression on Croatia written in 1991:\n\nA small pool of blood -\n\nChilled in air raid:\n\nlittle girl and her huge doll\n\nIn the burned-out village\n\na wounded stray dog\n\nsniffing charred bones\n\nThe first competition in Croatia in haiku poetry among primary school children was organized in 1986, on the occasion of the grand exhibition Kyoto - svijet kulture (Kyoto - World of Culture) in Zagreb. About 500 children throughout Croatia participated. Kyoto and Zagreb are sister cities since 1972.\n\nAcademician Vladimir Devide discussing and reading haiku with childrenin Croatia\n\nHaiku in Croatia\n\n2nd Vladimir Devidé Haiku Award - Open Haiku Competition - deadline March 1, 2012\n\nNikola Tesla (1856-1943) defended his patents in 24 countries. One of his patents were defended in Japan in 1912.\n\nIt seems that a well known tune \"U boj, u boj\" from the opera Nikola Subic Zrinski by Ivan Zajc is taught in Japanese schools. Information by Mr. Nenad Bach, New York. Professor Vladimir Devidé, japanologist from Zagreb, considers this very probable: he remembered a very young boy walking on a Tokyo street Komaba, wearing a huge rucksack filled with books, and whistling the familiar melody - \"U boj, u boj\"! (personal information, 2004).\n\nDecember 8, 2007, Tokyo, OAZO, Waseda University Glee Club singing U BOJ, U BOJ at the charity concert for refugee children.

I had opportunity to listen them on two records issued in Japan, when I visited Mr. Mario Kinel in his appartment in Zagreb (Mr. Kinel was a well known pop-music composer and translator; he even translated Vu plavem trnaci into Italian and German). Of course, out of Japanese verses I understood only - Marijana.\n\nO Marijana (see bottom on the right), issued in Japan in 1976, sung by Seiji Tanaka, Japanese pop singer born in 1947.\n\nMarijana is also very popular in Czechia. It was included in both Croatian original and Czech translation into the book \"Svetove Evergreeny\" (World's Evergreens), published in Prague in 2000 (Petr Jansky - MUSIC CHEB).\n\nWe invite you to listen to Vlaho Paljetak's tune O, MARIJANA, sung by Seiji Tanaka in Japanese and Croatian, recorded in 1976:\n\nO MARIJANA [mp3] 3.6 MB\n\nBy the courtesy of Dr. Drago Stambuk, Croatian ambassador in Tokyo.\n\nVlaho Paljetak (1893-1944), born in Dubrovnik, on the photo and on the stamp.

This is a video from a Croatian TV SHOW.\n\nLovro von Matacic, one of the greatest conductors of the 20th century (1899-1985), started his career in 1919 as conductor of orchestras in Osijek, Novi Sad, Ljubljana, Belgrade, Riga, and in Zagreb in 1932. From 1942-1945 he was conductor of the Vienna Opera.\n\nAfter 1945 he was imprisoned by the Yugoslav communist regime, and together with Croatian poet Tin Ujevic and painter Kristian Krekovic sentenced to confiscation of all movable and immovable property.\n\nIn 1950's he became organizer of Festivals in Dubrovnik and Split. In 1956 Matacic moved to Germany to conduct East Berlin Opera and the famous Dresden Staatskapelle, then conducted at Bayreuth in 1959, and from 1961 to 1966 was Gereralmuikdirektor in Frakfurt. He was also guest conductor in Vienna Opera, Milan Scala, in Chicago, Naples, Palermo, Rome, London, Cleveland, Tokyo, Prague, etc., and was elected the honorary director of the Japanese Orchestra in Tokyo.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1980 he was conductor and artistic director of the Zagreb Philharmonic Orchestra, and almost simultanesously from 1973 to 1979 had the same role in the Monte Carlo Orchestra.\n\nMiroslav Miletic, viola player, founded the Pro Arte string quartet in Zagreb, which in 1970's was among 10 best string quartets in the world. Among his numerous students was Hiroshi Hirano, violist from Japan (Tokyo). As a composer he promoted Croatian folklore and church music (in particular from the island of Hvar). He considers the Croatian folklore music the most beautiful and the richest in the world. In 1975, accompanied by the Leningrad philharmony, he played his Viola concert. Maestro Miletic collaborated also with K. Stockhausen on electronic music. He has his works published at Schott, Berben, Meckverlag, Pizzicatto etc, and an LP issued in the USA.\n\nDistinguished Japanese conductor Kazushi Ono was the Chief Conductor of the Zagreb Philharmonic Orchestra during six years, from 1990 to 1996. This was one of the most difficult periods of Croatia's past. When he arrived to Zagreb in 1990, he was at the age of 30.\n\nCroatian violoncellist Monika Leskovar (1981) is winner of the prestigeous Tchaikovsky competition in Japan for 1995 (a student of maestro Valter Despalj), the third prize at the 1997 Rostropovic competition in Paris, the second prize at the 1998 Eurovision contest for young instrumentalists, winner of the 1999 Roberto Caruana competition in Milano, Italy, the second prize at the famous ARD competition in 2001.\n\nNenad Bach's work and his life story have been featured on all the major US TV networks (CBS, ABC, NBC), on CNN, on Sky Channel, and on TV channels in Russia, France, Germany, Italy, Great Britain, Spain, Japan, and many other countries.\n\nDragutin ©urbek is a famous Croatian ping-pong player, who had many encounters with Japanese table tenis players, among them with the legendary I. Ogimura. One of those who knew him in person was another legendary Croatian ping-pong player (and the university professor of biochemistry), dr. ®arko Dolinar. See the photos below from the invitation of dr. on the occasion of his 80th birthday, dedicated to the memory of I. Ogimura.\n\nIn memoriam I. Ogimura. Photo by the courtesy of Mr. Dragutin ©urbek.\n\nAmong Croatian Latinists and writers in Croatian a central place is occupied by Marko Marulic, who is the \"father of Croatian literature\" (born in Split, 1450-1524). He was the most famous spiritual writer of his time in Europe, and also the first who defined and used the notion of `psychology', which is today in current use.\n\nHis book De institutione bene vivendi (six volumes, 64 chapters), published in Venice in 1506, had fifteen editions until 1686 and was translated from Latin into\n\nItalian,\n\nGerman (five editions between 1583 and 1614, all in Köln, in parts already in 1568),\n\nFrench (7 editions, the first in 1585),\n\nJapanese (in Nagasaki, in parts, 1585) ,\n\nPortuguese and Czech,\n\naltogether 40 editions.\n\nIt is well known that St. Francis Xaver had taken only two books on his long pilgrimage to the East (India, Japan and China): the Bible and De institutione. Furthermore, in his testament St. Francis Xaver asked that Marulic's book be burried with him. Therefore we may conclude that Marulic was a spiritual father of St. Francis Xaver.\n\nSt. Francis Xaver's personal sample of Marulic's book was kept in Madrid in a collection of valuables until 1937, when it had dissapeared. St. Ignazio Loyola included De Insitutione into the list of basic references for the formation of Jesuits.\n\nMarulic left us many beautiful verses and the epic poem Judita written in the Croatian language, for which he sais expressly to be written in the Croatian verses (versi harvatski). Some of his original verses are held in Glasgow (GB). His Judith was translated into English, Hungarian, French, Italian, and some parts into Spanish. Marulic translated from Latin into Croatian the famous \"De imitatione Christi\" by Thoma de Kempis.\n\nThe original Marulic's manuscript of \"De institutione bene vivendi\" has been stolen from the Croatian National Library in Zagreb around 1980. Any information about this would be appreciated.\n\nAccording to investigations of a French specialist Charles Béné, Marulic's texts have been used extensively by Thomas More and Henry VIII. It is known that Marulic's \"Evangelistarium\" that was read by Henry VIII bears many comments by the King. It is considered that two of the king's three literary works were written under the influence of Marko Marulic. Marulic's poem \"Carmen de Doctrina Domini Nostri Jesu Christi pendentis in cruce\" was translated into English as \"A Dialogue betwext a Christian and Christ hanging on the Crosse\" by Philip Howard, Earl of Arundel (1557-1595).\n\nAccording to C. Verdiani, Marulic is also the author of the Florence Codex, which contains a biography of St Jerome written in the Croatian language. There he wrote St Jerome is our Dalmatian, a glory, honour and fame, and brilliant crown of the Croatian language. In Croatian: Jerolim je nass Dalmatin, on je dika, posstenje i slava i svitla kruna hrvatskoga jezika. It is worth mentioning that preserved manuscripts of Marko Marulic show that he also used the cursive glagolitic script. Marko Marulic sent a dramatic letter to the Pope Hadrian VI, describing an extremely tragic position of the Croats threatened by the onslaughts of the Ottoman Empire and asking for help. His books were known not only in the whole of Europe, but also in Japan (in the 16th century) and South America. For example, parts of De institutione bene vivendi were translated into Japanese already in 1585, published in parts in Nagasaki under the title Sanctos no gosayuno, see Franolic (he mentions 1595 instead of 1585).\n\nWhen St. Francis Xaver arrived to Kogoshima in Japan in 1549, he also brought Marulic's \"De insitutione bene vivendi\". According to bishop Hamao from Yokohama, president of Japanese Bishop's Conference and of Asian Caritas, the formation of earliest Japanese Christians had been very probably based on the spirituality of Marulic. See here (in Croatian).\n\nIt is interesting that in Berlin a monument of Marko Marulic was set up in 2000. In the Library of Congress, Washington, a symposium was held devoted to his work.\n\nIT WOULD BE OF GREAT INTEREST TO HAVE A PHOTO OF THE FRONT PAGE OF MARULIC'S BOOK PUBLISHED IN JAPAN IN 1585.\n\nAnthony Maglica, holder of hundreds of patents and trademarks, founded Mag Instrument, Inc, in Los Angeles in 1955, and designed Mag-Lite flashlight, which is now an American product icon, among 100 top products that \"America makes best\". The Maglite products have been honoured by the Japan Institute of Design and the Museum for Applied Art in Germany. Mag Instrument donated thousands of flashlights to aid in the rescue efforts at the World Trade Center and Pentagon in 2001.

The name of SUVAG is coined from Systeme Universel Verbotonal d'Audition Guberina.\n\nHis books were translated into many languages, including Arabic and Japanese. In France, he was awarded the Legion of Honour: Knighthood in 1968, the Officer's Cross in 1989, which he was awarded in main quadrangle of the Sorbonne in Paris.\n\n崔, 春福, 吉田, 光演\n\nCUI Chun-Fu, YOSHIDA Mitsunobu\n\nTeaching of Japanese Compound Word Accent for Chinese Native Speakers : Effects of the Verbotonal Method with Reference to Japanese Learning\n\nAccent errors of Chinese speakers learning Japanese are caused by various factors: negative interference of L1, transfer in language training, overgeneralization, etc. Among others, different functions of tonal accents between Chinese and Japanese are a major source of the errors. Chinese four tonal accents, which are constant at the phrasal level, have the distinctive functions of identifying the meaning of words with the same phonemic representation. On the other hand, Japanese accents have not only this distinctive function but also the syntactic one: Japanese accents delimit the boundary of a syntactic phrase or a compound word so that they vary from context to context (only one low-high pitch in a compound). Due to this difference, Chinese learners tend to pronounce each minimal word with separate accent patterns. Even advanced learners sometimes produce wrong accent patterns since they are not explicitly taught compound word accent rules. Therefore, a more effective instruction for the prosody in Japanese should be developed. In this paper, we investigate a teaching method of Japanese compound accents in terms of the Verbotonal method (VT) advocated by Petar Guberina. The VT method uses the body movement in language learning focusing on the global sound-meaning structure and the context in which phonetic, rhythmic and intonational outputs are evaluated. Based on previous studies of the VT method in Japanese teaching, we designed an experiment to evaluate effects of an explicit instruction of Japanese compound accents.\n\nSource Hiroshima University\n\nぺ タール・グベリナ (著), クロード・ロベルジュ (編集)\n\nPetar Guberina (author), Claude Roberge (editor)\n\nこ とばと人間 ― 聴覚リハビリと外国語教育のための言語理論\n\nSpeech and Human Being - Linguistic theory and foreign language education for hearing rehabilitation\n\nPetar Gubrina: Speech and Human Being\n\n小 川裕花 (監修), 西田俊明 (監修), 原田早苗 (監修), 北代美和子 (翻訳), 佐野彩 (翻訳), 佐野純三 (翻訳), 寺尾いづみ (翻訳), 常盤僚子 (翻訳), 西沼行博 (翻訳), 福山孝子 (翻訳), 南舘英孝 (翻訳)\n\nHiroshi Ogawa flower (edited) (edited by) T.

He discovered a mistake in relations for absolute heat Q and temperature T in relativistic phenomenological thermodynamics, published by Max Planck in Annalen der Physik in 1908. This result that he published in Glasnik mat.-fiz i astr., 2/1947 in his article \"Sur les paradoxes de la notion d'énergie\", was rediscovered 13 years later by Heinrich Ott, and published in \"Zeitschrift für Physik\" in 1963. It is already time to correct wrong attribution of this discovery to Heinrich Ott in the scientific literature, since Blanusa's priority is indisputable.\n\nBlanusa's most important work is related to isometric immersions of two-dimensional Lobacevski plane into six-dimensional Euclidean space and generalizations. This result is included in authoritative Japanese mathematical encyclopedia Sugaku jiten published by Iwanami shoten, Tokyo, 1962, p. 612. His work about imbeddings of hyperbolic spaces into Euclidean spaces has been cited in 1956 by John Nash (well known mathematician, Nobel prize for economy; Blanusa is cited in his paper \"The imbedding problem for Riemannian manifolds\", Annals of Mathematics, Vol 63, No. 1, 1956, pp. 20-63).\n\nThe Baroque art in the Croatian north is described by a famous Japanese photographer Keiichi Tahara:\n\nQuand un ami française m'a conseillé d'aller voir les églises baroques en Croatie...je n'ai pratiquement rien trouvé sur ce sujet. Cela m'a paru étrange, et j'ai cédé a la tentation...\n\nKeiichi Tahara: Les Anges de Croatie, éd.

When a Japanese delegation visited Zagreb during the International Folklore Festival in the 1970s, then the organizers prepared a big surprise for them: Mrs. Shimooka ©tigliæ, dressed in her solemn kimono, was among Croatian hosts at the Zagreb airport, when the Japanese delegation arrived. In Zagreb, she is teaching ikebana and traditional Japanese cooking.\n\nIvan Rabuzin (1921-2008) designed a curtain decorating the stage of one of the best Kyoto theaters (Japan), as well as the Takarazuka Theatre in Tokyo (10.5 x 24 m, 1980), and several other museums in Japan: Sategaya Art Museum in Tokyo, Saitama Museum of Modern Art in Urawa, Isetan.

Twenty four weavers were working for three months to make it. Among other materials, 30 kg of gold thread was used. Moritani Shiro produced a film about Rabuzin's ceremonial drop curtain. This information is from Croatia, homeland of Marco Polo, Croatian national tourist board, 2008.\n\nSince 1976 his designs are used by \"Rosenthal\", renowned producer of procelain ware. He is also a member of the Croatian Parliament (Sabor). It is interesting that Rabuzin's father was a miner, while his mother was blind. His art was exhibited throughout the world: Zagreb, Paris, Antibes, Zurich, Milano, USA (Louisiana, Smithsonian Institution, Carnegie Insitute Museum of Art, Scottsdale Center for the Arts, Milwaukee Museum Art Center, Chicago Public Library, C.W. Post Art Galery/Long Island University, Pittsburgh), Oslo, Munich, Dusseldorf, Amsterdam, Verona, Brescia, Florence, Tokyo, Osaka, Geneva, Cologne, London, etc.\n\nAs many as 10 films have been made about Rabuzin's work, including one in Japan (Moritani Shiro, Kyoto).

It is the base of all lives on the Earth. In the just one drop of water, all the wisdoms of nature are represented.\n\nSince Croatia is a country accepting many stimuli from two large areas - the European Continent and the Mediterranean Sea, it is said the country represents the combination of water molecules.\n\nOn the first floor of the pavilion, a tour image of breaking through the sea surface from under the sea to an upper part is presented, making us remember the potentiality of the sea through ancient salt-making techniques.\n\nSalt, a spice and natural preservative, represents wisdom and symbolizes moderation and purity. Today, everybody regards salt as a natural and ordinary thing, but historically, wars were repeated over saltpans, and the routes to transport salt were kept secret.\n\nWork to separate salt from seawater and work to refine seawater into purified drinking water are both closely connected to the history of the people regarding the sea as important.\n\nOn the second floor, the whole picture of Croatia is introduced. Visitors feel as if they are flying over Croatia with bird's-eye video images taken from a plane of its scenery, the sea, cities, and the people and cultures.\n\nSource\n\n©egrt Hlapiæ (Apprentice Hlapiæ) by Ivana Brliæ-Ma¾uraniæ, Croatian fairy tale in Japanese.

Tada smo vozili praznom cestom brzinom od oko 50 km/sat. S ruba ceste iznenada se zaèula pucnjava. Vjetrobransko staklo na¹eg kamiona rasprsnulo se i nismo vi¹e mogli vidjeti ispred sebe. Ante (vozaè) nagazio je koènicu da zaustavi kamion. Opet se zaèula pucnjava, a vozaè je povikao “no, no”. Nekoliko je metaka uletjelo, a komadiæi stakla i ostalog raspr¹ili su se. Ante se prevalio prema meni i jeèao slabim glasom koji se postupno gubio. Pogledao sam vrata s lijeve strane i u visini grudi ugledao dvije velike rupe. I ja sam osjetio bol u lijevoj ruci, ali iako je na ko¾noj jakni bila rupa, èinilo mi se da krv ne teèe. Malo poslije pokraj nas je pro¹lo oklopljeno vozilo UN-a, a za njim i drugi kamioni i oklopna vozila. Desnom rukom razbio sam naprslo prednje staklo i provukao se, pa zvao oklopno vozilo UN-a. Kako neko vrijeme nisam mogao privuæi pozornost, ostavio sam Antu i potrèao prema vozilu UN-a. Èinilo mi se da jo¹ ima blizu skrivenih muslimanskih vojnika te sam oko 100 metara pretrèao u jednom dahu.\n\nIz kamiona koji je bio vozio ba¹ ispred nas vodili su dva ranjenika, jedan je bio ozbiljno ranjen u ruku i grudi te je istjecalo mnogo krvi. Drugome je krv tekla iz glave, ali èinilo se da nije ni¹ta ozbiljno. Molio sam vojnika UN-a da im da injekciju morfija, a zatim i da je u mom kamionu ranjen vozaè, ali mi je odgovorio da ima pune ruke posla. Do¹lo je jo¹ nekoliko oklopnjaka i ja sam se obratio jednom od njih. Ne¹to poslije vojnik mi je rekao: “On je umro”. Suze su mi navrle na oèi. Nekoliko desetaka minuta zadr¾ali smo se na tom mjestu dok su donijeli Antino tijelo. Antino tijelo prevezeno je oklopnjakom, i ja sam se ukrcao na to vozilo. Preko njegova lica bila je prebaèena jakna. Dogodilo se to gotovo u trenu, ali jo¹ mi se vraæa kao ru¾an san. Srce me boli kada pomislim na njegovu obitelj, a da njega nije bilo s moje lijeve strane, sada bih sigurno bio mrtav.\n\nOvo nije samo jedan dogaðaj iz rata, moænim oru¾jem ubijen je bespomoæan, nebranjen èovjek. To je ubojstvo, to je zloèin.

The dance shows a parent shishi forcing his cub to undergo harsh training in order to grow up strong.
