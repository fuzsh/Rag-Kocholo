Can we just.\n\nthe year before the twins and nicky signed at psu, two of wymackâs foxes, ian and kirk, died in a car crash.\n\nthe next year, kevin day broke his hand and went to wymack, the only person he thought would keep him safe.\n\nthe year after that, seth gordon, the only surving member of wymackâs original lineup, overdosed after he was so nearly clean, and it almost destroyed allison.\n\nmonths later, andrew was attacked in columbia and committed to easthaven. aaron killed someone. andrew was gone and the others came back shattered.\n\nthen neil claims to go home for the holidays, they donât hear from him all of christmas break, and on new years, neil calls him and asks wymack to pick him up from the airport. heâs there instantly and god, he looks half-dead. neil sees the 4 tattoo and tries to cut it off his face. all he can say is that he didnât sign to the ravens.\n\nthen thereâs the blood in the locker room. wymack canât push away the feeling that somethingâs getting closer, something is coming to hurt his foxes and thereâs nothing he can do to stop it.\n\nthen. the game at binghamton. neil looks on edge but wymack doesnât ask whatâs wrong. neil and andrew are above his paygrade. then the riot. he canât see any of his kids in the crush. he finally pulls them all out, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eightâ\n\nneilâs gone. neilâs gone and they canât find him. andrew canât find him. neil got taken by someone. what was that like for david wymack? did it feel too familiar? did he look at his kids and think not again, i didnât lose another one again. does it ever scare him. does it terrify him. when aaron came back from the police station in columbia, twenty four hours in holding and he couldnât look wymack in the eye, did he think what if i canât save these kids? when andrew was lying in a hospital bed, too drugged to react, did he think what if i canât give them their second chance? when neil grabbed that knife, when he fell to pieces on wymackâs kitchen floor, when he came back to them in baltimore, bloody and broken, did wymack think why am i always too late?\n\nUrgent ðï¸ call: ð¨ð Please help..ð¥ºðð\n\nMy name is Falastin, and I am a mother of three small children, ages 5 years, 2 years, and 3 months. I am not very good with social media, but I am writing to seek your help to give my family in Gaza the chance to live their lives again.\n\nDue to the ongoing genocide we in Gaza are experiencing, my family need your help to survive, leave Gaza, and find safety.\n\nIn november 2023 last year, i lost three of my cousins from my motherâs family with their wifes and childrenâs, some of them still under the rubble untill now.\n\nIn mars 2024 this year i lost another 2 cousins in Alshifa hostpital, this shock after three months of the first lose was a big slap into our face, it was a harsh reminder that death didnât stop, and that none of us is an exception in this genocide, not a woman nor a child, everyone of us is a target to the death machines above our heads.\n\nMy family has lost everything. Some of them have tragically passed away, and those who remain are without shelter, moving from one temporary place to another in a desperate attempt to stay alive. Currently âAfter more than 20 times of being displaced and having to leave our house escaping from rockets and death â they have fled south and are living in a makeshift tent made from plastic bags and torn clothes.\n\nEach day is a battle for survival. Each day, my family wakes up not knowing if they will have food to eat, clean water to drink, or a safe place to rest. Their homes have been wiped, and their children sit sleepless waiting their death. In Gaza, there is no where to seek shelter, no bunkers, nowhere to hide. Gaza is no more than 40 kilometers long and 10 kilometers wide with a population of just over two million. Gazaâs border is completely surrounded by fences and barbed wire. The only way out of Gaza is to Egypt.\n\nI used to introduce myself as the youngest in the family but in this GENOCIDE Iâm a big sister who see her siblingsâ future getting lost in front of her eyes, as i see my brothers kids who are still young and supposed to be in school, my mom who is 73 years old unable to find her medicine, as I see them, I made it a mission to myself to save my family or whoâs left alive from it, to save their future from all of this and to escape Gaza.\n\nDespite everything, I still have hope to save those who remain of my family. But I need all the help I can get from every person on earth. This challenge is not easy for me, especially since I am not good with social media and i dont have so many follower to reach and ask them for help. However, I am trying, and maybe with your support, the impossible can become possible.\n\nAsking for your help is the only way I have to save my familyâs life and future. Your help can be our hope when hope seems far away. Because of that, I appeal to your generosity and compassion, asking for help so that we can gather the necessary funds to help my family.\n\nPhotos of âLina,â who was born at the start of the war, and she is now 9 months old. Your donation could give her the chance to survive, leave Gaza, and find safety with her family.\n\nI would like to thank everyone who has donated, shared and supported my campaign so far. Your generosity has given us hope in the darkest of times, and I am deeply grateful.\n\nSo far, we have raised 3,950 SEK of our 2,000,000 SEK goal - August 15th. While this is a small step, it is a crucial one, and it shows that together, we can make a difference. We still have a long way to go, and I urge you to continue sharing our story and contributing if you can.\n\nEvery donation, no matter the size, brings us closer to saving my family and giving them a chance at life. Please read and act as if it were your family, your mother, your siblings in these conditions. ððððððð\n\nImportant note: Donation value:\n\n** 1$ = 10.5 Swedish kr\n\n** 10$ = 105 Swedish kr\n\n** 100$ = 1050 Swedish kr\n\n** 1000$ = 10500 Swedish kr\n\nVETTED and shared by 90-ghost, also as no. 282 in The Vetted Gaza Evacuation Fundraiser Spreadsheet compiled by el-shab-hussein and nabulsi and shared in the masterpost.\n\nWe have also been verified by Al Jazeera News.
