        "text": "Event Planning as it relates to Coronavirus (COVID-19)\n\nAs an organization whose mission is to bring people together to experience meaningful moments, we remain committed to ensuring the health and safety of Events.com employees, event organizers and attendees during this difficult time. Thank you for entrusting us with your events. We take this responsibility very seriously.\n\nWe understand the concern and uncertainty you are likely experiencing surrounding the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. We are closely monitoring information from government agencies, medical professionals, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to keep a pulse on the evolving situation.\n\nHealth & Safety\n\nIf you haven’t done so yet, let your event goers know you care about their health and well-being as soon as possible. Find out what the CDC is recommending for coronavirus (COVID-19) in your area. Check with provincial, federal, state and local authorities for any current or potential event restrictions. This may help inform the best decision for your community. As an industry, it is our responsibility to maximize the safety of our partners and participants and we want to support your focus on health and safety as you make decisions about your events.\n\nEmergency Plan Options\n\nThere are some tactics you might consider for your event that can help you navigate through the challenges and may help participants contain the spread of the disease, while reducing your risk of chargebacks and refund requests.\n\nHere are some immediate action steps and things you can do (some using Events.com technology and features) to help you through this. Click each link below for further instructions.\n\nChange your event from live to virtual.\n\nPostpone or reschedule your event to a later date.\n\nOffer a deferment option to attend next year’s event. This option can be offered to sponsors, participants as well as vendors.\n\nTurn on ticket protection with Fanshield if you haven’t already.\n\nImportant note: We are in the process of automatically turning on Ticket Protection for all draft or live events selling tickets or registrations in our system. You may still turn off this feature in your settings, but we recommend that you keep it turned on.\n\nIf your event is not permitted to occur on your event day or you cancel your event, it is a good idea to familiarize yourself in advance with your refund policy and plans, along with your insurance policies. We recommend you contact your insurance broker and/or advisor to review your policies. You may also want to review and enhance your legal waiver and associated text to ensure your protection as an organizer. If you do not currently have a legal waiver and refund policy, we suggest you implement one and add it immediately. We also recommend that you be very proactive with a communication plan with your attendees – reach out early.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nMany regions have restricted events of certain sizes to stop community spread of the virus. We expect to see more regions limit event activity in the coming weeks. When your event does occur, even after the restrictions are removed and we’ve all overcome the current challenges, consider measures you can take in the future to help prevent the spread of this and any other illness. Some examples include:\n\nMake it a no-handshaking event or create your own on-brand non-touch greeting\n\nProvide ample soap and handwashing stations\n\nAdd medical staff on-site with no-touch thermometers\n\nProvide check-in staff with protective gear\n\nProvide refunds or deferrals to elderly or health-challenged participants\n\nAllow areas for people to spread out and enjoy the event rather than in close proximity\n\nHire a professional cleaning crew to clean surfaces\n\nEvent organizers tend to be MVPs in the lives around them, and many people rely on them for direction and so much more. Enable your team in the event that you are temporarily unavailable and establish a chain of command.\n\nReview the guidance the CDC has issued for mass gatherings and large community events. It contains a number of helpful guidelines on the basis of what to do before, during and after a COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nTake a look at the recommendations from the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention in these articles: Event Organizers and Staff – Flu Prevention at Mass Gatherings and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n\nU.S. Government Loan Program\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. government announced a fund to be run through the Small Business Association (SBA) to support small businesses impacted by the coronavirus. They are still working out the details and we don’t yet know how this will play out, but it may be worth applying as quickly as possible.\n\nTerms of the Loan:\n\nMust be a small business with less than 500 employees\n\nLoan amounts are up to $2M\n\nInterest not to exceed 4%\n\nYou can also call the SBA directly at 1-800-659-2955. Monitor national, state, and local SBA sites for more information.\n\nIn Closing\n\nWe will be sending out more emails covering additional topics as we all navigate through this period.\n\nWe are in this together as we stand with you and the entire events community. Perhaps the most important thing to remember is that this is a temporary situation, it is not going to be forever, though it may feel like that now for some.\n\nThe event industry has led economic recovery in several cycles and has saved entire industries when they went through disruptions, such as music and even parts of the media industry. Our long term view of the event economy is still very positive, and we are quite hopeful for a fast recovery.\n\nYour Events.com customer success manager is available to assist you during these challenging times. Feel free to reach out directly to your customer success manager or send us an email at hello@events.com.\n\nOur hearts go out to everyone who has been impacted, and as always, thank you for being a part of the Events.com community.\n\nYour Events.com Team\n\nAttendee Protection offers attendees’ protection for some of the common personal reasons out of an individual’s control, that people have for cancelling their event attendance. If an attendee makes a successful claim, FanShield will issue a refund for the amount protected. We know that this can be helpful for an organizer, as you aren’t always able to offer refunds. If this is the case, Attendee Protection can be a solution for your attendees.\n\nYou can find the full terms and conditions of FanShield’s Standard Attendee Coverage Policy here.\n\nThe registration report contains who has accepted and declined Attendee Protection if you’re interested in reviewing your whole event. For help running a report, please visit our article – How do I view reports?\n\nIf you need to review an individual’s protection, there is information available in their registration/ ticket.\n\n1. Open People and click Attendees.\n\n2. Search for the individual and click their card to open their registration/ ticket.\n\n3. In the left corner, Attendee Protection will be listed with the summary of the order. A status message will indicate the Protection status.\n\nThe example status is Active! which indicates that the Attendee successfully purchased Protection and could initiate a claim if applicable.\n\nOther possible statuses are:\n\nInactive! – This can indicate there is a new policy associated with another ticket/registration.\n\nChanged or cancelled! – This could indicate that a claim is in progress, or a change was made with their registration/ ticket.\n\nSomething went wrong with processing! – This usually indicates that the attendee’s payment was not success and the attendee should look for a FanShield email or email them directly.\n\n4. Clicking View Details will open a pop up containing the Attendee’s Protection Policy ID (this is needed to submit a claim) and a quick reference to FanShield’s support. The article referenced is this article. If you have additional questions for how you can best support your attendee, please contact our support at help@events.com\n\nIf at any time, there are additional questions about Attendee Protection, have the attendee contact FanShield at help@fanshield.insure\n\nUnfortunately right now there are many things for an event organizer to consider. Depending on your community it might be beneficial to consider allowing people to choose between attending this year or deferring their registration to the following year in 2021.\n\nCreating a deferral for your event can be as easy as adding an additional registration/ticket type! New sign ups can select it as their ticket of choice, and through our post registration tools, existing attendees can change their ticket to the future year in just a few easy clicks.\n\nPlease visit this helpful article if you need the steps for creating a new registration – How do I create tickets or registrations?\n\nIf you’d prefer to add it as an updated question (to record yes or no from everyone), the best option is to set it up as a purchase (with or without a cost). Please refer to this article for a walk through on setting up purchases – How do I set up purchases to upsell my event goers?\n\nWe also recommend emailing your attendees, as well as updating your website and social media. We suggest using an emailer like MailChimp (they offer a free account based on contacts and contacts can be synced with Events.com). Here are our helpful articles to guide you through getting started with MailChimp:\n\nHow do I contact my attendees? (Guide to syncing through Events.com)\n\nHow do I send an email in MailChimp?\n\nSomething else to keep in mind, when someone makes a change (either a new registration or new purchase answer), they will receive a new confirmation email. You can put a custom message onto your new deferral registration, or add a message into the existing confirmation email for when someone selects an answer to the new purchase question. Please check out this article for a guide on custom confirmations – How do I customize my confirmation emails?\n\nIf you’d like to discuss your deferral strategy or have any questions about getting it set up, contact your dedicated Customer Success Manager, or email us at help@events.com. We’ll be happy to help you put everyone’s mind at ease today!\n\nIf you’ve made the decision to move your event date, you should communicate with your event goers as soon as possible. We suggest you do this by updating your Events.com registration page, activating the Postpone Feature, emailing your attendees, updating your website, social media, and by resending everyone’s confirmation emails.\n\nUpdating your Event Registration Page\n\nTo change your date and description on your Events.com page, start by clicking the Edit tab to access these fields (or scroll down if you’ve just completed the step above). Here’s our help article for reference – How do I customize my event page? (Step 3)\n\nWe’ve created a few images you can easily add to your event page. Here are some placement ideas that would help direct attendees to your updated description and let them know your event is postponed.\n\nIf you’re using the Branded template, add an image to your logo section\n\nWe’ve provided 2 images for your banner. One is an image you can place on top of your banner image and the other is a full banner image you can replace your current one with.\n\nAdd an alert image to your description to draw attention to your updated content.\n\nImage Files for Download\n\nDesign Files for Download\n\nPostponement Feature\n\nThere is a new section for postponed events. This will ensure that your attendees don’t miss that there is updated information on your event page. Click the Edit tab to access your event page details.\n\nHere you can turn the toggle to YES in order to activate messaging to your attendees. The preview button will show you where your attendee will see the following alerts.\n\nThese alerts will show up on their My Events page and within their Order View. These alerts make the attendee aware the the event has been postponed and link to the event page where they can see your updated description.\n\nCommunicating with your Event Goers\n\nWe recommend using an emailer like MailChimp (they offer a free account based on contacts and contacts can be synced with Events.com). Here are our helpful articles to guide you through getting started with MailChimp (you need to have a MailChimp account set up first):\n\nHow do I contact my attendees? (Guide to syncing through Events.com)\n\nHow do I send an email in MailChimp?\n\nResending Confirmation Emails\n\nWe also recommend updating your confirmation email with a new custom message and resending confirmations to all of your participants. If you’d like a refresher on adding a custom message please check out this article – How do I customize my confirmation emails?\n\nAfter you’ve saved your new message, you can scroll down and click – RESEND CONFIRMATION EMAIL. This is a one time click so make sure you’ve finalized your new message. The subject line is: Just a reminder. This is why we suggest that you communicate with your attendees before sending it out. It’s also good to make sure you’re contacting them in different ways so everyone receives the new date quickly. Here is our article on these steps – How can I resend confirmation emails to all attendees?\n\nIf you’d like to discuss your postponement strategy or have any questions on our suggestions, contact your dedicated Customer Success Manager, or email us at help@events.com. We’ll be happy to help you put everyone’s mind at ease today!\n\nCreating a virtual event on Events.com is very similar to creating an in person event. Please follow along to get set up right away!\n\n1. While on Events.com click Create Your Event.\n\n2. In the Basic section, select a category that best represents the type of event you’re hosting.\n\n3. In the Details section, you can consider including “Virtual” or “Webinar” in your Event Name to be consistent with your branding.\n\nFor Location Type, you can choose between Venue (indicating a physical location), Virtual or Both. Due to new Marketplace Facilitator regulations, the address needs to be collected for tax purposes even in the case of Virtual but it does not have to be shown on your event page.\n\nWhen you select Virtual as your location type. This will display a Virtual tag to your event page.\n\nIf you have a virtual and physical event taking place you can select Both. This gives you have the option to show your address or keep it hidden. You have the option to add a virtual tag directly onto the registration/ticket as discussed in step 5.\n\nYou can also select Advanced Settings on the date and time to hide specific dates and times for your event if you need.\n\nUse the Event Description to be very clear what your attendees can expect and include as many details as possible:\n\nAre you mailing them a race kit?\n\nWill you be providing them with a link for webinar access?\n\nWhat does the kit contain?\n\nWhen will it be shipped out?\n\nHow long will it take to receive?\n\nWho is speaking in the webinar?\n\nWhat topics will be covered?\n\nWhat are the live start and end times? (This may be important to mention the time zone if you expect international attendees)\n\nYou can add hyperlinks, images and format your text. Get creative with important information by changing the color of your text, or size of your headlines.\n\nIf you have a welcome video this is the perfect place to add it, along with your website. It’s important to have your brand consistent and available throughout.\n\nIf this is your first event on Events.com, or if you’re branding your virtual events under a different organization name, here is where you can add your Organization Name. This can’t be easily updated, so choose wisely! Click CONTINUE when finished.\n\n4. Enter in your social media. This is a great reference point to gain followers or encourage social participation. Plan to share important hashtags and campaigns with your attendees. Clicking GET STARTED! creates the framework of your event.\n\n5. Creating Registrations/Tickets. Set up a registration/ ticket type best suited for your attendees.\n\nIf you selected Both as the Location Type, you will have a setting within your Registrations/Tickets to add a Virtual tag to your specific Virtual registration/ ticket.\n\nYou can still offer Teams, or Corporate Buying if they fit your audience. Here are some great articles for additional reference:\n\nHow do I set up registrations/tickets for my event?\n\nCan I support teams or groups in my event?\n\nWhat are corporate groups, and how can I use them?\n\nUse Form Questions to collect any necessary info from your participants such as shipping address, or what industry they work in, why are they interested in your webinar – How do I add form questions? You may want to add a waiver for Rules & Policies having each person agree to the terms of your Virtual event (or acknowledge that it is a virtual event).\n\nConsider what you’re including in your registration/ ticket price. If you are offering a race kit, will the shipping be included? International shipping? If you’d prefer to add an international shipping premium as an add on, the best option is to set it up as a purchase. Please refer to this article for a walk through on setting up purchases – How do I set up purchases to upsell my event goers?\n\n6. You’ve covered all the info needed for your purchase form, now you should consider your post communication. One way is through your confirmation page message and confirmation email. Do you have links that you want your attendees to monitor (ie for access to your webinar)? Do you have a video community link to share? Do you want to give them the schedule so they know what to expect? Do you have any social groups for them to join? Or social media hashtags you want them to use?\n\nHow do I customize my confirmation emails?\n\nThe other way, and this can be done at any time, is to send them an invitation. This gives another opportunity to send a branded message to your attendees and send them any additional content to enhance their experience.\n\nHow do I use invitations?\n\n7. Last but not least, ensure that you’ve connected your payment info. You’ll want to make sure that these details are in place for you to get paid! After you’ve finished here, you can Go Live!

You’ll want to consider the reason you’re cancelling and whether or not you’re offering an alternative, or a refund. And don’t forget about updating all of your social media!\n\nTo update your page, you’ll want to start by closing sales. Go to Event Details – Registrations/Tickets and click the Settings (gear icon) for each of your registrations/tickets. The second calendar is the close date. You’ll want to set it for a past date and time to have it closed immediately. Click SAVE.\n\nNext you’ll want to update your description to communicate the cancellation to anyone that will land on the page. You can update your description by going to Edit and scrolling to the Description box.\n\nFor communicating with your attendees, we recommend using an emailer like MailChimp (they offer a free account based on contacts and contacts can be synced with Events.com). Here are our helpful articles to guide you through getting started with MailChimp (you need to have a MailChimp account set up first):\n\nHow do I contact my attendees? (Guide to syncing through Events.com)\n\nHow do I send an email in MailChimp?\n\nAs a final outreach we also recommend updating your confirmation email with a new custom message and resending confirmations to all of your participants. If you’d like a refresher on adding a custom message please check out this article –How do I customize my confirmation emails?\n\nAfter you’ve saved your new message, you can scroll down and click –RESEND CONFIRMATION EMAIL. This is a one time click so make sure you’ve finalized your new message. Here is our article on these steps – How can I resend confirmation emails to all attendees?\n\nIf you plan on cancelling all of the tickets, an email is sent at that time. We suggest emailing them the announcement first so it’s not a surprise when they receive the cancellation email.\n\nIf you’d like to discuss your cancellation strategy or have any questions on our suggestions, contact your dedicated Customer Success Manager, or email us at help@events.com.\n\nRight now, it’s an unknown time for the event industry. Event Organizers are facing many tough decisions. More and more event organizers are considering rescheduling their events. From the moment you realize there may be a reason that your event can’t go on, we recommend making a decision as soon as possible.\n\nThis is the time that you should talk to your team, your vendors, your sponsors and anyone else involved in your event. Review any policies or insurance associated with your event to see if there are guidelines you need to consider. Ask important questions: Can the venue accommodate the new date? Can your entertainment and staff? Put as much information together as you can to decide if you’ll be postponing or rescheduling if you’ve chosen a new date.\n\nAfter you’ve made a decision, make the announcement to your partners to ensure that everyone can participate in the new date. Otherwise, you’ll need to be prepared to put more work into re-finalizing your checklist.\n\nWhen you’ve got all of this in the works, communicate with your attendees. We suggest doing this through email, your social media accounts, and tools in the Events.com platform. This helpful article walks you through these options with more details: How do I communicate rescheduling or postponing my event?\n\nAfter opening communication, the next challenge that an organizer faces from rescheduling is keeping their attendees engaged. Think of some fun activities for your attendees, encourage them to share their training photos, maybe create some new limited swag, or run a contest.\n\nRescheduling your event has not only lengthened your event lead time but created some opportunity to attract some new attendees. We encourage you to pick back up your efforts of spreading the word and to focus on being louder than ever. When the world is ready to go back to (its new) normal, event goers will be more enthusiastic than ever to participate in events and connect with others.\n\nAn attendee needs a refund for an item they ordered?

With our Copy Event feature, you will be able to easily copy the format and set up from a LIVE or recently completed event.\n\nWhen should I use this feature?\n\nThis function is especially beneficial for organizations offering the same event in multiple locations. For example, an event series or an event that happens annually. Once you create the original event and are happy with its performance, you can copy that as many times as you’d like without having to recreate the entire event.\n\n1.

This is a popular tactic to drive sales and generate significant online revenue.\n\nAffiliate marketing on Events.com is the process by which a promoter earns a fee for the resulting sales from marketing an event organizer’s registrations/tickets. The event organizer can add as many promoters as they want. The promoter, earns a fee from every sale they make (set by you). The sales are tracked via affiliate links from one website to another.\n\nTo get started, click Affiliate Program in your organization menu.\n\nWithin the Affiliate Program, you can Add Promoters (people that will be selling on your behalf). Add PROMOTER NAME, EMAIL, their unique CODE (added to their custom URL), REFERRAL FEE (what they’ll earn from each sale) and select which events this information APPLIES TO.

After they sign up, they are able to access the page within their Events.com accounts from their order. When you’re ready, you can start customizing your Digital Event Page with these steps:\n\n1. Log In to your Events.com account and navigate to your event.\n\n2. In your event, click EVENT DETAILS and then Digital Event Page.\n\n3. Click CREATE PAGE to get started! The toggle to Make Digital Event page visible to Attendees is defaulted to YES. If you’re not ready to share the page, you’ll want to toggle to NO.\n\nThere are three page elements available to help you build your digital event page. Text for adding text or images, with or without hyperlinks in the Text Editor. You can add Video for an optional title and video link (to be embedded for viewing) or Live Stream for an optional title and streaming link. Click Add page element to get started. You can also add a Background Image. If your event page has a banner, you’ll have the option to USE BANNER IMAGE. If you didn’t have one, or would like to use something else, you’ll have the option to SELECT IMAGE. Click Preview Page to see how your page will appear to your attendees. Use the arrows on the left to move your page elements around, or the trash cans on the right to remove an element completely. You can add as many of each page element as you’d like for your Digital Event Page.\n\n4. When finished, click SAVE. This page will now appear within your attendees’ Events.com accounts! (If your toggle was set to NO, your progress will be saved for later)\n\nAttendees can access the Digital Event Page from within their Events.com accounts.\n\nOr by clicking the link within their confirmation emails (attendees will need to Sign Up if they haven’t already created an account).\n\nPro Tip: If you have added another language to your event, you will also be able to offer your Digital Event Page in that language as well.\n\nYes you can! Waivers are a great way to provide a set of guidelines or rules that need to be followed at your event. The form recognizes the Buyer as being the primary person, if they also sign up, they can sign their waiver right then. If they sign someone else up, the other person will receive directions in their confirmation email on how to sign their waiver (a youth registration will allow the signature of a parent/guardian after entering in their date of birth). To add a waiver with a required electronic signature to your registration form follow these simple steps below!\n\n1. Log In to your Events.com account.\n\n2. Click on the EVENT DETAILS icon on the left side navigation and select Form Questions.\n\n3. Scroll to the bottom of your entry form and click ADD QUESTION.\n\n4. Select Waiver, under Other Questions.\n\n5. You have the choice of an Electronic Signature or a Check Box for the agreement type. To require an Electronic Signature, ensure you have that option selected. Then you can give your waiver a different name which will appear to your attendees. Write, or copy and paste your waiver into the waiver body.\n\n6. When you’ve finished adding your waiver, click SAVE at the top or bottom of the page before navigating to a new page. Your attendees will now have a text field for their electronic signature in the registration form.\n\nWhen people start registering, you can keep an eye on your attendees to see who has and has not signed and even send reminders with these easy steps:\n\n1. Within your event, click DATA from the tools on the left.\n\n2. The Overview summary dashboard will appear by default (read about building your Overview Summary here). In the blue navigation tool bar, click Event Summary.\n\n3. Scroll down to the Waiver Signatures section. This is where you can see a pie chart of how many people have Signed and Not Signed. You can download a spreadsheet for individual review and preview the reminder email. You are able to send the reminder email 3 times to communicate with your attendees.\n\nThis is what your attendees will receive:\n\nNote: You can add as many waivers as necessary. To do this, simply repeat the steps above for each one. Waivers will always appear at the bottom of your form.\n\nIf your event offers a complimentary t-shirt with registration, you will need to make sure you know each registrant’s size when placing orders. You’ll want to set this under the Purchases tool. All items will require a selection for each registrant to successfully process the order.\n\n1. Log In to your Events.com account.\n\n2. To add an item, click on EVENT DETAILS on the left side of the screen, and select Purchases.\n\n3. Then, click on ADD ATTENDEE ITEM under Attendee Items.\n\n4. Give your t-shirt a NAME (e.g. “T-Shirt Size”).\n\n5. Then you’ll want to add each size that you offer as an OPTION NAME. If you have limited inventory for each size, be sure to add that limit under INVENTORY to ensure you can’t sell more product than you have. Since this is a complimentary item, leave the price at $0.\n\n6. To add another size, click on the plus symbol. You can add as many sizes as you want, with their own inventory limits and pricing. If needed, you can use the arrows to adjust the position of the Option Names (This is the order how they will appear in the registration form). Get ready to click the gear symbol for the finishing touches.\n\n7. The Advanced Settings tab allows you to toggle Required to YES or NO, add Product Description, add a Product Image, the option to Hide Pricing, customize the Availability and add any Restrictions.\n\n8. Click SAVE to save your changes.\n\nPro Tip: It is a good idea to add an image for any item that you offer or sell to get people excited about wearing your awesome brand. See How do I add an Image to Additional Purchases? for instructions.\n\nIf your event or brand sells merchandise, such as a hat or water bottle, you may want to allow people to purchase merchandise in addition to their registration/tickets. We call these items Other Stuff because they are not associated to a specific attendee and can be purchased by the buyer of the order. Attendees and Buyers can come back to Events.com to purchase other stuff at any time after the initial purchase. Events.com offers a clean design to allow you to add an online shopping experience to your order form. You can add images, manage inventory and build your brand loyalty all in one place.\n\n1. Log In to your Events.com account.\n\n2. Click on the EVENT DETAILS on the left side of the screen, and select Purchases.\n\n3. Then, click on ADD OTHER STUFF under Other Stuff to get started.\n\n4. Give your item a name (e.g. T-Shirt) and an option name (e.g. Small).\n\n5. Set the price for the option, or leave it blank if it is free.\n\n6. Set the inventory limits for each option so that you do not oversell your available inventory.\n\n7. If there’s more than one option (e.g. Small, Medium, Large), you can add these by clicking on the plus icon. Each option can have a different name, inventory limit, and price.\n\n8. In the Advanced Settings for each purchase, you can add a product description or image. Adding an image may help motivate people to buy the item.\n\n9. Click SAVE to save your changes.\n\nYou may have additional items for your event that each event goer must select to complete a purchase, such as a t-shirt size or parking pass. If so, you’ll want to set this up under the Purchases tool. All items added to this portion of the registration flow will be listed for each registrant, and may or may not have a price associated to them. It is important to note that each registrant may only select each item once. For example, if you list a free t-shirt with the registration, each registrant may only select one size.\n\nFollow these steps to add a purchase to one or more registrations in your order form:\n\n1. Log In to your Events.com account.\n\n2. Click on EVENT DETAILS on the left side of the screen, and select Purchases. Then, click on ADD ANOTHER ATTENDEE ITEM to get started.\n\n3. Give your purchase and option names (e.g. Purchase: Hat and Options: Black, Gray, Blue). Set the inventory limits for each option, so that you do not oversell your available inventory. Set the price for the option if it is not free.\n\n4. Add more purchase options by clicking on the “plus” + icon. You can set a different name, price and inventory limit for each purchase option by repeating steps 2 through 4.\n\n5. The Advanced Settings (gear icon) allows you to toggle Required to YES or NO (Whether an attendee will be stopped to answer the question), add Product Description, Product Image, the option to Hide Pricing and to customize the Availability.\n\n6. Click SAVE to save your work.\n\nPro Tips: It is a good idea to add an image for any item that you offer or sell to get people excited about wearing your awesome brand. See How do I add an Image to Additional Purchases? for instructions on adding images for additional purchases.
