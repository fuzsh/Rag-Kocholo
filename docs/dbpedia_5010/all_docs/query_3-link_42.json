        "text": "Budgeting is the process of different departments coming together to estimate revenue and set expense limits for a period of time. The goal is to establish and unify commonly understood targets. The budgeting process involves evaluating resources, prioritizing objectives and analyzing the difference between objectives and outcomes.\n\nThe purpose of budgeting is:\n\nTo plan: The operational budget begins with establishing and combining the objectives and identifying resources in order to create a plan for subsequent activities.\n\nTo communicate: The budget should be communicated throughout an organization and be reflective the objectives of each department.\n\nTo control spending: Budgeting determines the allowable spending limits for departments, projects, CAPEX, and OPEX.\n\nTo coordinate: Budgeting coordinates and unifies all departments and business units to higher level goals.\n\nThe master budget is composed of three distinct components:\n\nOperational budgets: These define the positive and negative components of income and the related financial implications that result in the development of action plans.\n\nBudget of investments: The budget of investments allows budgeters to quantify the effort needed to adapt an item to company structure. It also defines the need of financial resources that contribute to the final structure of the state assets quote.\n\nSummary reports: These include the cash budget, cash flow forecast, forecast and loss account balance sheet forecast. In addition, they require budgeters to combine the estimated revenue and cost, entry and exit, a verification summary of the resulting income, financial, and capital action plans.\n\nAn operational plan breaks down how divisions, departments, or cost centers intend to achieve the strategic plan. The operational plan is much more tangible, granular, and action-oriented than the strategic plan. It sets out the goals on a lower level and then lays out the blueprint for achieving those goals. Then it defines how activities and resources — human, physical, and financial — will support the broader strategic objectives. Some examples of operational plans could include sales planning, capacity planning, and inventory planning.\n\nOperational planning best practices: Like strategic planning, there's no single way to create an operational plan. Generally speaking, operational plans contain specific strategies, objectives, activities, timelines, and metrics.\n\nAt its most basic, financial planning and analysis is the process of creating a company’s long term financial strategy based on its strategic goals and through an analysis of assets, liabilities, expenses, and income. Often, it involves forecasting financial realities and analyzing long term objectives from a financial point of view specifically to ensure that those are objectives are viable and within the scope of the financial reality.\n\nFor enterprises, planning, budgeting, and forecasting software brings all data relevant to planning into one software system. The manually generated spreadsheets that traditionally support planning are not sophisticated enough to support the large-scale data needs of enterprises. Software is the only way that complex, often global, companies, can determine departmental budgets, allocate costs, and create plans that work towards strategic goals. Planning, budgeting, and forecasting software integrates data sources from multiple departments and makes it available for planners. This way, departments can see how plans or outcomes from one department impact the plans and outcomes in another. For example, how the quarterly sales forecast will impact finance’s revenue forecast.\n\nModernized approaches to planning, budgeting, and forecasting software, like integrated business planning (IBP) and eXtended planning and analysis (xP&A) take traditional enterprise planning methods to the next level. In essence, they give planners from all domains, such as workforce, sales, supply chain, and marketing departments, access to traditional financial planning and analysis tools — like scenario planning, simulations, cost allocation, modelling, rolling forecasts, and predictive analytics."
