        "text": "When British skaters Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean won the Olympic gold medal in ice dance at Sarajevo 1984 with 12 perfect 6.0s from every judge, for their interpretation of Maurice Ravel's Boléro, an important member of their team was singer-actor Michael Crawford. Crawford, who had played Frank Spencer in British sitcom Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em and the title role in the musical The Phantom of the Opera, had become a mentor to the pair in 1981 and went on to help them create their Olympic routine. Crawford said he “taught them how to act\". He was present with their trainer Betty Callaway at the ringside at Sarajevo as they created one of the most iconic moments in Olympic history.\n\nSenior FP&A Analyst - Europe & Middle East\n\nThe NBA’s international offices work to carry out the league’s strategy of growing the game of basketball globally by hosting NBA events around the world, creating sponsorship opportunities.

The role will deliver financial forecasting, analysis, business partnering, and performance management and provide ad-hoc support to strategic planning and key initiatives for the NBA’s operations in Europe and the Middle East.\n\nMore jobs\n\nPierre de Coubertin once said cricket has \"practically no appeal for those who are not British\".
