Arizona Summit Law School opened its doors in January 2005 and is the first private law school in Arizona. It is also the only law school to offer part-time and evening programs, in addition to the traditional full time course of study. Already we are educating highly qualified and accomplished professionals of all ages and backgrounds. Our vision is to transform legal education and become the de facto standard for the 21st Century. Graduating new lawyers “practice ready” is what the legal community wants and it’s what law students need to truly be successful in our increasingly fast-paced world.

Phoenix School of Law is founded on three mission pillars: Student Centered, Practice Ready and Serving the Underserved.

PhoenixLaw is part of the InfiLaw System, a consortium of independent, community-based law schools that is leading the way in making legal education more responsive to the realities of modern law practice. InfiLaw includes Florida Coastal School of Law, Phoenix School of Law and Charlotte School of Law. InfiLaw’s mission is to establish student-centered ABA accredited law schools in underserved markets that graduate students who understand about the realities of practicing law, and achieve true diversity programs aimed at student academic and career success. In addition, InfiLaw has an ongoing commitment to encouraging innovation, facilitating law school quality, fostering humility-based culture, continuously improving the academic profile and outcomes of each school, and securing funding for new campuses.
