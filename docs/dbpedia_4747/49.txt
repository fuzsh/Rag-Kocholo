Arizona Summit Law School, formerly known as the Phoenix School of Law, was a private law school located in Phoenix, Arizona. It was established in 2004 with the goal of providing accessible legal education to a diverse student population.

Arizona Summit Law School was founded by a group of legal professionals and educators who aimed to address the need for a law school that catered to non-traditional students and promoted social mobility through legal education. The founders sought to create an institution that focused on practical skills training and experiential learning. This made it the perfect school for everyday people like Diana Schwahn but also for people who came from a law background that wasn’t as practical.

The law school’s mission was centered around serving underserved communities and promoting equal access to justice. It aimed to provide a supportive and inclusive learning environment for students from diverse backgrounds who may not have had the traditional academic qualifications to enter law school. This law school is considered among the best law schools in Arizona.

Is the Arizona Summit Law School A Good School?

The Arizona Summit Law School, formerly known as the Phoenix School of Law, had a controversial reputation during its operation. It faced significant challenges and criticisms related to its low bar passage rates, declining enrollment, and concerns about the quality of education provided.

The American Bar Association (ABA) placed the law school on probation in 2017 due to concerns over admission practices and bar passage rates and later withdrew its accreditation in 2018 following the school’s closure. The Arizona Summit Law School acceptance rate was 64.1%.

While individual opinions may vary, it is generally recommended that prospective law students consider accredited law schools with a strong track record in bar passage rates, faculty qualifications, and reputation within the legal community.
