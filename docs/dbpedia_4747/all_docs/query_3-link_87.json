        "text": "1. Lorona's refusal to file an inaccurate tax form1\n\nIn 2012 the Law School's Director of Finance, Judy Smith, ordered Lorona to upload a tax form to the Arizona Department of Revenue's website. (Id. at ¶¶ 29-30.) Lorona explained that the form contained inaccurate information and refused to file it, even after Smith made revisions. (Id. at ¶¶ 33-40.) Smith continued to pressure Lorona to file the form. (Id. at ¶¶ 41-42.)\n\nConcerned, Lorona sought advice from the Law School's General Counsel, who told her not to file the form. (Id. at ¶¶ 43-45.) Lorona also met with the Law School's Human Resources Manager, Stephanie Lee, who advised Lorona to speak with the Law School's President, Scott Thompson, or to contact Infilaw's whistleblower hotline. (Id. at ¶¶ 5-6, 46-49.) Lee and Thompson declined Lorona's requests for follow-up meetings. (Id. at ¶¶ 50-52.) Lorona then contacted Infilaw's whistleblower hotline. (Id. at ¶¶ 53-55.) Days later, Smith was fired. (Id. at ¶ 56.)\n\n2. Employment difficulties\n\nSubsequently, Lorona was charged “paid time off” hours while working remotely and caring for her children, who had severe asthma. (Id. at ¶¶ 67-70, 177, 204-07, 209.) At times she was denied the opportunity to work remotely at all. (Id. at ¶ 183.) Lorona discussed her concerns regarding “paid time off” hours with Lee. (Id. at ¶¶ 251-54.) Lorona was not advised of her rights under the Family and Medical Leave Act (“FMLA”). (Id. at ¶¶ 181, 184, 208.) At Lorona's request, Lee gave Lorona the paperwork necessary to seek FMLA leave, but her doctor misplaced the paperwork. (Id. at ¶¶ 210-14.) Other employees—males without disabilities or caregiving responsibilities—received FMLA leave without requesting it or submitting paperwork. (Id. at ¶¶ 215-19.)\n\nIn addition, Lorona was denied an interview for a promotion for which she was qualified. (Id. at ¶¶ 58-61, 185-87.) The position was given to a male without disabilities or caregiving responsibilities, who was less qualified than Lorona. (Id. at ¶¶ 62, 193.) Thompson and Lee excluded Lorona from department meetings and took away her corporate credit card. (Id. at ¶ 63.) Lorona complained to her superiors that she was being unfairly treated and discriminated against due to her need to care for her disabled children. (Id. at ¶¶ 270-72.)\n\nOn one occasion, Lee commented in a meeting that Lorona (who was absent) had a “great butt.” (Id. at ¶¶ 231-32.) Lee later told Lorona she should be flattered, not embarrassed. (Id. at ¶¶ 235-38.) On a separate occasion, Lorona's supervisor compared Lorona to a Barbie doll. (Id. at ¶¶ 239-40.) Lorona complained to her superiors that she was being discriminated against because she is a woman. (Id. at ¶ 270.)\n\nOn April 13, 2013, Lorona was fired. (Id. at ¶¶ 90-93.) Lee had previously assured Lorona there were no concerns about her performance. (Id. at ¶¶ 242-44.) When Lorona was fired, Lee confirmed she was not being fired for cause. (Id. at ¶¶ 94-95.) Lorona was replaced by a male who did not follow standard hiring procedures, is less qualified than Lorona, and regularly leaves work earlier than Lorona was allowed to leave. (Id. at ¶¶ 256-58, 264-65.)\n\n1. Representations by the Law School\n\nArizona Summit Law School made representations, to Lorona and others, about its students. In 2009, bar exam pass rates among the Law School's graduates were reportedly over 80%. (Id. at ¶ 26.) But Law School emails from 2012 to 2014 disclosed plummeting pass rates, as low as 50%. (Id. at ¶¶ 79-84.) During that period the Law School continued to boast an “Ultimate” bar pass rate of over 80%, via brochures and email. (Id. at ¶¶ 85-86.) The “Ultimate” pass rate refers to the percentage of all graduates who have passed the bar exam “on the first or subsequent attempts,” not the percentage of test-taking graduates who passed the exam on a particular date. (Id. at ¶ 85.) In addition, the Law School reported to third parties statistical data about its students, such as undergraduate GPAs, LSAT scores, and bar pass rates. (Id. at ¶¶ 128, 130-31.) But these data did not take into account students admitted via “alternative” enrollment, even though such students comprise up to 80% of the student population. (Id. at ¶¶ 128, 130-31, 133.) In a staff meeting in 2011, the dean of the Law School stated that “alternative” enrollees were just as successful in the classroom as traditional enrollees. (Id. at ¶¶ 72-74.) In May 2014, the Law School began paying students it deemed likely to fail the bar exam not to take the exam, in order to inflate bar pass rates. (Id. at ¶¶ 102-104, 106, 117-20.) Despite struggling bar pass rates, the Law School projected confidence: “We believe by graduation, lawyers should enter the workforce professionally prepared to practice law.... Summit Law... creat[es] well-rounded lawyers who add immediate value to their firms and employers.” (Id. at ¶ 138.)\n\nThe Law School also made representations about its affordability. Its website stated that tuition, fees, and supplies for its three-year program beginning in 2010 would total approximately $103,000 and that median student loan debt for recent graduates was approximately $98,000. (Id. at ¶ 142.) Further, the Law School enrolled students ineligible for federal financial aid and gave them “time to fix their credit to receive loans,” despite knowing the Department of Education does not lend to students with certain credit deficiencies. (Id. at ¶ 140.)\n\nIn addition, the Law School made representations about its bar exam preparation program, myBAR. A 2013 Law School email advised students to sign up for myBAR instead of a competitor's bar review course, citing higher bar pass rates with myBAR. (Id. at..."
