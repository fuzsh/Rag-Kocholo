The American Bar Association has found the private school’s finances are not sufficient to meet its standards.\n\nThese findings come on the heels of the school’s being on probation for low passage rates on the State Bar exam. The ABA is asking the law school to submit a report by Feb. 1.\n\nJoining us now is Anne Ryman, who covers higher education for The Arizona Republic and azcentral. She’s been reporting on the school’s problems."
