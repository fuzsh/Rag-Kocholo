        "text": "* Robert Bowers, the suspect in the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting that left 11 dead and six wounded, has been charged with 29 federal criminal counts including hate crimes and using a firearm to commit murder and 36 state criminal counts including homicide and ethnic intimidation. Our thoughts are with the family and friends of those who lost their lives this weekend. [New York Times]\n\n* According to the criminal complaint filed against Cesar Sayoc, the pipe bomb he allegedly tried to mail to former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder was addressed to his office at a “certain law firm” — a certain law firm that’s better known as Covington & Burling. Good thing the package never made it there. [National Law Journal]\n\n* When asked to reflect on the misconduct allegations against Yale Law School Professor Jed Rubenfeld, alumni from the school are not the least bit shocked. “It was not a surprise to basically any woman in my class that this investigation is going on,” said one 2015 graduate. Will the school take appropriate action? [Yale Daily News]\n\n* Partners from Allen & Overy and O’Melveny & Myers are cozying up to each other as merger talks between the two firms continue, but there may be trouble in paradise. “There is some opposition in London,” said a former A&O partner, “but it’s fairly disorganised—there’s a lot of moaning but nobody leading a charge.” [International]\n\n* In case you missed it, after the involuntary revocation of its accreditation, Arizona Summit Law School will eventually close its doors. But first, the school must finalize a teach-out plan for its remaining students, and when it’s all over, “that would be the life of the school.” What a sad little life. Farewell to AZ Summit Law. [Arizona Republic]\n\n* You might not have known it, but the Michigan State University College of Law has been operating as a private school for all these years. Soon, the school will be fully integrated into the university, and you know what that means: in-state tuition costs will be coming to the MSU Law. Congratulations! [Lansing State Journal]\n\n* RBG is my Patronus, and a course on Harry Potter and the Law is coming to a law school near you — if you live in India, that is. The National University of Juridical Sciences will be teaching the class, and muggles students are “expected [to] have already read all the books at least twice, if not more.” [The Guardian]\n\n* Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings will continue today, and we imagine that when his rulings are discussed, he’ll be pummeled on own “frozen trucker” case — but his involves a killer whale. [National Law Journal]\n\n* Special counsel Robert Mueller says he’ll accept written answers from President Donald Trump on questions related to whether his campaign conspired with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election. As for the obstruction question, it seems like Mueller still wants an interview. [New York Times]\n\n* The Securities and Exchange Commission has reached settlements totaling about $216,815 with the former leaders of failed firm Dewey & LeBoeuf. Of course, that’s nowhere near multimillion-dollar fraud that’s been alleged, but at this point, Dewey even care anymore? [American Lawyer]\n\n* According to the American Bar Association, Florida Coastal Law, the last InfiLaw school left standing, is still out of compliance with accreditation standards. Coastal is already suing the ABA, so this latest decision is sure to inspire some additional filings from the school. [ABA Journal]\n\n* North Dakota Law has welcomed more than two dozen students who fled from beleaguered Arizona Summit Law with open arms. Why have so many Summit students flocked to Roughrider Country? All of their credits will be accepted there, which is a pretty good reason. [Bismarck Tribune]\n\n* Paul Manafort’s attorneys rested their case without calling a single witness or putting their client on the stand. Why’s that? “[H]e and his legal team believe that the government has not met its burden of proof.” Best of luck with that. [ABC News]\n\n* White House staffers are reportedly “[t]errified, [a]bsolutely terrified” about what might be revealed in the conversations Omarosa Manigault Newman secretly taped. Hmm, what could they possibly be so scared about? [Politico]\n\n* You may be wondering how Michael Cohen, Donald Trump’s former personal attorney, is funding his legal defense. Apparently he could use some more cash, because he just put his new apartment up for rent for $25K a month. [Real Deal]\n\n* Guess which law school has abandoned its students while it appeals the ABA’s decision to pull its accreditation? That would be Arizona Summit, which recently sprang the news on its remaining students that no fall classes will be held. [Law.com]\n\n* Kei Komuro, who is engaged to Princess Mako of Japan, started at Fordham Law School this week, where he was greeted by journalists and papparazi as he attempted to go to the first day of orientation. Welcome to America! [Japan Times]\n\n* “We never once saw him take a shortcut, treat a case as unimportant, or search for an easy answer.” According to 34 of Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s former clerks, the man is apparently not just a judge, but also a saint, and they wanted the Senate Judiciary Committee to know all of the details. [National Law Journal]\n\n* Nice guys get confirmed fast? More on Judge Kavanaugh’s sainthood. The man coaches not one, but two girls’ basketball teams, he’s a superb “carpool dad,” and he takes a family friend’s daughter whose father died to the school’s annual father-daughter dance each and every year. He’s just so nice! [Washington Post]\n\n* Damn, it’s not just Arizona Summit’s graduates who can’t practice law in Arizona. Three lawyers from Kirkland & Ellis — including Paul Clement, Viet Dinh, and Christopher Bartolomucci — were booted from the school’s case against the ABA for failing to comply with out-of-state attorney admission procedures. [Law360]\n\n* Acording to the Boston Larger Law Firm Managing Partner Group, “much work needs to be done” when it comes to attorneys who have experienced inappropriate sexual behavior at work. Per a recent study, 60 percent of respondents had either received messages of a personal or sexual nature, been touched inappropriately, or witnessed a coworker being touched inappropriately. [Boston Business Journal]\n\n* Lawyerly Lairs: Convicted Murderer Edition. The 80-acre ranch of Claud “Tex” McIver, the former Fisher Phillips partner who shot his wife in the back, is now on the auction block, and there’s a dispute over who will receive the proceeds. [Daily Report]\n\n* Bernie Madoff’s investment strategy may yield a billion dollar return… for the trustee. [American Lawyer]\n\n* Lanny Davis is now representing Michael Cohen, which certainly doesn’t bode well for Trump. [Bloomberg]\n\n* The fiance of Princess Mako of Japan is going to Fordham next year. [Japan Times]\n\n* Federal judge rules that sanctuary city policies aren’t obstacles to immigration policy because standing aside is not the same as standing in the way. [NY Times]\n\n* A disturbing look at the border crisis through the eyes of an immigration lawyer. [Mother Jones]\n\n* Job opportunity: the Senate is looking for special counsel to grease the wheels on the effort to roll back decades of jurisprudence. [National Law Journal]\n\n* Akin Gump is representing a woman separated from her children by the Trump administration. The representation comes as part of a public-private venture backed by the state of New York. The story is the latest testament to Governor Andrew Cuomo’s deeply held moral conviction that people shouldn’t vote for Cynthia Nixon. [Journal News]\n\n* The head of Arizona Summit Law School thinks the school’s been treated unfairly. The nerve of these people. [KJZZ]\n\n* Guess which law school is on the verge of losing its accreditation? We’ll have more on this unsurprising news later today. [Arizona Republic]\n\n* When it comes to Milbank’s new $190K salary scale for associates, some general counsel and in-house leaders don’t seem to really care, and others are none too thrilled about it, but absolutely NONE of them want to pay for it. [Corporate Counsel]\n\n* How much does President Donald Trump detest AG Jeff Sessions? This much! The president says he’ll probably support legislation protecting marijuana activities in states where the drug has been legalized. [NBC News]\n\n* Pointing out numerous dueling injunctions in a Friday night filing, the Trump administration’s Justice Department is paving the way for a SCOTUS showdown over DACA — possibly as soon as sometime this summer. [BuzzFeed]\n\n* If you’re planning to someday become a Supreme Court clerk, you better make sure that your law school is following the new law clerk hiring plan. Justice Sonia Sotomayor is now the fourth justice to offer her support, following in the footsteps of Justices Kagan, Ginsburg, and Breyer. [National Law Journal]"
