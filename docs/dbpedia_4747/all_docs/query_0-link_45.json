        "text": "Established more than 30 years ago, the Indian Legal Program (ILP) at the Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law at Arizona State University has grown to become one of the most respected Indian law programs in the nation. Situated in the heart of the Southwest, with connections to Arizona’s 22 tribes and tribes nationally, the ILP is in the perfect location for students looking to study the developing field of Indian law. Our nationally recognized faculty members are leading scholars in their fields, producing research and publications, as well as providing outreach and public service.\n\nHome to one of the highest concentrations of Native American students and Indian law students in the nation, ASU Law has an active Native American Law Students Association that hosts events, participates in pro bono activities, and mentors incoming students. Students have an instant network to support them academically, professionally and socially. Working for tribes, in public service, private practice and nonprofit organizations, Indian Legal Program alumni are making a difference in Indian Country. The program's positive reputation is in large part due to the success and support of its graduates.\n\nASU Law’s Indian Legal Program offers an Indian Law JD certificate program (discussed below), and its Indian Gaming and Tribal Self-Governance Programs offer MLS and LLM emphasis areas in the following: Indian Gaming (MLS and LLM), Tribal Self-Governance (MLS and LLM), Federal Indian Law (MLS) and Tribal Policy, Law and Government (LLM).\n\nIndigenous Land Acknowledgement\n\nStudent opportunities\n\nThe Indian Legal Program provides students the opportunity to see the law in action with two traveling classes. Students have the opportunity to leave Arizona and learn from experts in the field. In Federal Advocacy for the Tribal Client, students attend class during fall break at the ASU Washington Center in DC with former Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs Carl Artman and visiting lecturers from the DC area providing instruction.\n\nThis class introduces students to the practical application of the relationship between tribes and the federal government, including the development of federal Indian policy. While in DC, students visit different offices and network with professionals working in the field. In Contemporary Issues in Tribal Economic Development, students attend class in Winnebago, Nebraska, during spring break at the corporate headquarters of Ho- Chunk Inc. with Lance Morgan, CEO of Ho-Chunk Inc., instructing the class. Ho-Chunk Inc. is an award-winning economic development corporation owned by the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska. Established in 1994 with one employee, Ho-Chunk Inc. has grown to over 1,000 employees with operations in 10 states and four foreign countries. Topics covered include tobacco and gas operations and tax compacts, tribal corporate structures, government contracting, a new tribal farming initiative, as well as numerous other subjects.\n\nNative American Law Students Association at ASU Law is a large and active group of Native and non-Native law students. It is committed to promoting the understanding of Native American cultures and legal issues affecting indigenous people. It organizes community service activities, social activities, and mentorships. The student mentorships provide incoming students with academic support, advice, and friendship. The ASU Chapter is an active member of the National Native American Law Students Association organization, competes in the annual national moot court competition, and co-sponsors the Indian Legal Program /Native American Law Students Association graduation celebration.\n\nSample coursework\n\nCultural Resources\n\nIndian Gaming\n\nTribal Law and Government\n\nEconomic Development in Indian Country\n\nContemporary Issues in Tribal Economic Development\n\nIndian Law and Taxation\n\nFederal Advocacy for the Tribal Client\n\nInternational Indigenous Rights\n\nCritical Race Theory\n\nCivil Rights Legislation\n\nEnvironmental Law\n\nNatural Resources Law\n\nWater Law\n\nTribal Energy"
