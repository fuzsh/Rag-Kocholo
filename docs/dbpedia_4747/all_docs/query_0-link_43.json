        "text": "Law students borrow from the U.S. Department of Education Direct Loan Program for school. These loans are income-generating assets for the government. The government is investing in not only law students, who will repay loans (in theory) with interest, but also law schools.\n\nSome (or many) law schools would close without federal investment because schools depend on tuition revenue to stay open and students depend on federal student loans to pay tuition and cover living expenses. Federal student loan policy dictates that the government will lend the full cost of attendance to anyone who attends an ABA-approved law school. If the government changes this lending policy, for example by limiting or eliminating Graduate Plus loans, private lenders may fill some of the lending market, though presumably not all of it.\n\nThe size of the federal investment has declined substantially in recent yearsâ€”by more than $1.1 billion between 2013 and 2016 and an additional $350 million in 2017 alone. This was a function of falling demand for law school, rather than a change in federal student loan policy. The amount in nominal dollars has leveled out since then, but has declined in real dollars\n\nTotal Federal Investment for 2022 Graduates\n\nView all schools\n\nExcluded schools (included in adjusted figures): Appalachian School of Law (Private, 40 grads), Barry University (Private, 175 grads), Cleveland-Marshall College of Law (Public, 132 grads), Inter American University (Private, 189 grads), John Marshall Law School - Atlanta (For-Profit, 56 grads), North Carolina Central University (Public, 130 grads), Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico (Private, 103 grads), Southern Illinois University (Public, 78 grads), Southern University Law Center (Public, 199 grads), Texas Southern University (Public, 164 grads), Touro College (Private, 158 grads), University of Puerto Rico (Public, 148 grads)\n\nTotal Federal Investment for 2021 Graduates\n\nView all schools\n\nExcluded schools (included in adjusted figures): Albany Law School (Private, 164 grads), Appalachian School of Law (Private, 55 grads), Ave Maria School of Law (Private, 68 grads), Barry University (Private, 183 grads), Cleveland-Marshall College of Law (Public, 128 grads), Inter American University (Private, 172 grads), John Marshall Law School - Atlanta (For-Profit, 78 grads), North Carolina Central University (Public, 88 grads), Oklahoma City University (Private, 130 grads), Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico (Private, 84 grads), Quinnipiac University (Private, 101 grads), Seattle University (Private, 198 grads), Southern Illinois University (Public, 63 grads), Southern University Law Center (Public, 193 grads), Stetson University (Private, 262 grads), Texas Southern University (Public, 171 grads), Touro College (Private, 133 grads), University of North Texas Dallas College of Law (Public, 109 grads), University of Oregon (Public, 128 grads), University of Puerto Rico (Public, 146 grads), University of St. Thomas - Minneapolis (Private, 142 grads), Western State College of Law at Westcliff University (For-Profit, 85 grads)\n\nTotal Federal Investment for 2020 Graduates\n\nView all schools\n\nExcluded schools (included in adjusted figures): Appalachian School of Law (Private, 52 grads), Barry University (Private, 183 grads), Inter American University (Private, 183 grads), John Marshall Law School - Atlanta (For-Profit, 119 grads), New England School of Law (Private, 153 grads), North Carolina Central University (Public, 118 grads), Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico (Private, 134 grads), Southern University Law Center (Public, 150 grads), Texas Southern University (Public, 209 grads), Thomas M.
