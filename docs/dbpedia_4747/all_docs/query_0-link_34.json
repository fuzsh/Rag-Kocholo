        "text": "Arizona Summit Locked Out of Its Building\n\nArizona Summit Law School has been locked out of its downtown Phoenix offices following its failure to make an August rent payment.\n\nazcentral reports that school officials decided not to pay August rent after opting to not offer classes this fall. In turn, the landlord of its downtown Phoenix offices decided to lock the school out of its rented space, located at One North Central, near Central Avenue and Washington Street.\n\nArizona Summit Interim President Peter Goplerud tells azcentral that the school’s administrative offices have moved to another location across the street.\n\nClosure Of Fall Classes\n\nAs we recently reported, Arizona Summit, which has experienced financial struggles in recent years, decided to not offer fall courses this year.\n\nSchool official advised students to apply as “visitors” to Arizona State University’s Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law despite having “no guarantee” that students will be accepted.\n\n“Arizona Summit has announced to its students that there will not be classes this fall, and that Summit is negotiating with another law school for a teach out,” the statement reads. “As [Arizona Summit] will not be offering classes in the fall, [Arizona Summit] will not offer any scholarships going forward to any [Arizona Summit] students.”\n\nDespite the lockout, Goplerud assures that it won’t affect students.\n\n“The closure of the old building by the landlord is not interfering in any way with our ability to assist the students who have transferred,” he told the Arizona State Board for Private Postsecondary Education, the agency that licenses for-profit schools.\n\nSources: azcentral, Tipping The Scales, Arizona State Board for Private Postsecondary Education"
