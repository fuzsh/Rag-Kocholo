        "text": "\"I applied to Arizona Law because I was impressed with its reputation for helping graduates find jobs that actually require a JD, and because it has a fantastic student-to-professor ratio.\n\nBut with such an important decision at stake, I wasn’t completely convinced until I visited the campus. Arizona Law is a famously collegial law school, but you don’t fully appreciate what that means until you experience it firsthand. It’s a different atmosphere than I expected to find at a top-tier law school.\n\nThat first impression has held true throughout my time here. For instance, when I missed class because my son was sick, I had class notes waiting in my inbox from three different classmates before I even had a chance to ask! I am grateful every day that I chose to come here. Frankly, I couldn't imagine going anywhere else!”\n\n— Kate Hollist, Class of 2016\n\nUniversity of Arizona Law provides an outstanding legal education at a cost lower than private law schools and many public university law schools, particularly those of comparable quality.\n\nOur robust scholarship program reduces the cost of law school even further, and you will be automatically considered for scholarships when you apply.\n\nOur competitive TechLaw Fellowship for STEM students and professionals offers full-tuition scholarships plus an additional stipend and unique academic and career opportunities that cannot be matched by any law school in the country."
