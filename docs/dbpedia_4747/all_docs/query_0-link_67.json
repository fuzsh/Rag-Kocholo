Although you may be awarded financial aid up to the cost of attendance, you may choose to borrow less. Please note, this is a one-month budget. Each student's Cost of Attendance will be reviewed and increased, if warranted, to reflect the number of months a student is enrolled.\n\nAll Law Programs Excluding MLS and MPS\n\nBooks/Supplies/Course Materials: $525\n\nRoom/Board: $1,600\n\nMiscellaneous: $250\n\nTransportation: $550\n\nTuition/Fees (1 unit): $625\n\nTotal: $3,550\n\nMLS and MPS\n\nBooks/Supplies/Course Materials: $525\n\nRoom/Board: $1,600\n\nMiscellaneous: $250\n\nTransportation: $550\n\nTuition/Fees (1 unit): $950\n\nTotal: $3,875"
