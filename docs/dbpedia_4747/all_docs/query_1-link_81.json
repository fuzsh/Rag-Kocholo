        "text": "Valparaiso University Law School.\n\nAfter 139 years in operation, Valparaiso University School of Law is calling it quits.\n\nOfficials announced Tuesday that the Indiana law school will close once its remaining 100 second- and third-year students graduate. The move was not unexpected, as the campus struggled with accreditation problems and dwindling enrollment in recent years. Administrators said they saw no way forward once state regulators in Tennessee nixed a planned relocation of the law school to a public university there.\n\n“This has been an extremely difficult decision and is the result of several years of careful discernment,” said Frederick Kraegel, chairman of the board of directors of Valparaiso University, in an announcement of the closure plan. “We have explored a number of strategic alternatives. Despite these efforts, we have not been able to achieve a more positive outcome.”\n\nIt marks the second time in as many weeks that an American Bar Association-accredited law school has said it will shut down. Last week, Arizona Summit Law School president Peter Goplerud told the Arizona State Board for Private Postsecondary Education that the Phoenix school is ending its fight to hang on to its ABA accreditation and will officially close once its remaining students complete their law degrees at other schools. (The ABA revoked Arizona Summit’s accreditation in June and the school canceled all classes this semester.)\n\n➤➤ Stay on top of developments and trends in legal education with Ahead of the Curve by Karen Sloan, a new weekly briefing from Law.com.
