        "text": "Arizona Summit Law School, formerly known as Phoenix School of Law, was a private law school located in Phoenix, Arizona. The institution played a significant role in legal education in the state, providing aspiring lawyers with the opportunity to pursue their dreams. However, it faced a series of challenges that ultimately led to its closure in 2018.\n\nArizona Summit Law School, Arizona’s first private law school, aimed to offer a practical and accessible legal education. It provided an innovative curriculum that emphasized experiential learning, preparing students for the demands of the legal profession. Arizona Summit Law School offered Juris Doctor (J.D.) programs and various concentrations, allowing students to specialize in areas such as intellectual property, criminal law, or immigration law.\n\nDespite its initial promise, Arizona Summit Law School encountered difficulties that impacted its reputation and viability. The school faced scrutiny regarding its low bar passage rates and employment outcomes. Critics argued that these issues raised concerns about the quality of education provided by the institution."
