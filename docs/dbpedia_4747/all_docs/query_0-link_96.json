        "text": "Over $9.5 Million in Scholarships for Students Accepted to Law Schools\n\nThe recently concluded 2013-2014 law school application season was especially productive for John Jay students, with 41 individuals affiliated with the Pre Law Institute (PLI) securing acceptances to 65 different law schools, as well as receiving over $9.5 million in scholarship awards.\n\n“These students were admitted to many well-regarded law schools, including several selective institutions within New York City, such as the New York University, Fordham, Cardozo Law School and Brooklyn Law School,” said Vielka Holness, the PLI Director and head of the Office of Fellowship and Scholarship Opportunities. “Many other top-ranked law schools across the country are included with not just offers of admission but also large scholarships.”\n\nHolness credited the increase in law school admissions to students’ involvement in PLI programs such as the Pre Law Boot Camps, the LSAT Prep Program and Scholarship, and the more than 40 other opportunities offered by PLI each year.\n\nThe newest PLI initiative — the Paula Howell Anderson PLI Scholars Program — will help each of four John Jay pre-law students to prepare for law school applications. The program is funded by alumna Paula Howell Anderson, who went on to Harvard Law School and is now a partner at the law firm of Shearman & Sterling LLP, as well as a Trustee of the John Jay College Foundation.\n\nThe Anderson PLI Scholars will be chosen on the basis of their academic achievements and dedication to the pursuit of law school. The scholarship will cover costs related to registering for the LSAT, the Credential Assembly Service and the Law School Reports as well as law school application fees and participation in Pre Law Boot Camps, LSAT preparation and other PLI programs, in addition to advisement and mentoring.\n\nThe Pre Law Boot Camps are held during seasonal breaks in the academic year, giving students an intensive, week-long opportunity to polish their writing, critical thinking, argumentation and logical reasoning skills. Holness also pointed out that the PLI works to increase student success by providing increased access to individual and group advisement sessions, identifying private sponsorships, increasing the number of schools and students participating in the Graduate and Professional School Fair in conjunction with the Center for Career and Professional Development, and increasing the number of internships for pre-law students.\n\nIn addition to Anderson, the PLI enjoys the support of John Jay College Foundation trustees Anne Beane Rudman, LaBrenda Garrett-Nelson and Richard Koehler.\n\nFor more information on the PLI, including the Paula Howell Anderson PLI Scholars Program, visit www.jjay.cuny.edu/pli.\n\nList of law schools to which John Jay pre-law students were accepted.\n\nAlbany Law School\n\nAmerican University Washington College of Law\n\nAppalachian School of Law\n\nArizona Summit Law School\n\nAve Maria School of Law\n\nBarry University School of Law\n\nBaylor Law School\n\nBenjamin N.
