        "text": "A better partner\n\nWhile returning home this week, I grabbed a newspaper at an airport kiosk, attracted by a headline that a for-profit school that had partnered with Bethune-Cookman University had lost its accreditation with the American Bar Association. Arizona Summit Law School had an agreement with B-CU to lure Daytona Beach graduates out west to the Phoenix-based school, where just part-time, non-resident tuition this past year was in excess of $36,000.\n\nAccording to Friday’s edition of The Arizona Republic, the ABA’s decision means the law school can no longer accept new students, and the school must create a plan to ensure current students can complete their law degrees and take the bar exam.\n\n(READ: B-CU partners with troubled law school)\n\nWhile the failure of the school is suggestive of many problems, Arizona Summit’s failure creates a unique opportunity for B-CU to explore furthering a vastly more practical, economical and logical relationship. And it’s been staring them in the face from Day One: A partnership with Florida A&M University College of Law, located in Orlando.\n\nThe law school is considerably more affordable, with full-time, resident tuition at $14,131. Without question, FAMU and B-CU share at least one common thread: to create a path and vision for advance education for those who have been traditionally deprived of such opportunity.\n\nMaybe Summit’s failure has opened some eyes.\n\nGrady C. Irvin Jr., Plant City\n\nIrvin is a native of Daytona Beach and an attorney in the Tampa Bay area.\n\nDig deeper on deal\n\nLast week the American Bar Association dropped the hammer on the Arizona Summit Law School and stripped it of its accreditation, the first time that the ABA has revoked accreditation from a fully accredited law school. Over a year ago, the ABA stepped in and placed the school on probation for being woefully out of compliance with accreditation standards. In addition, less than 25 percent of graduates passed the bar. These facts are well-known and through a modicum of due diligence will easily surface.\n\nSo pray tell me: Why would a reasonable and fair-minded individual in a position of trust recommend attending Summit? This is the question that I and many other Bethune-Cookman University alumni and supporters raised when B-CU formed an affiliation agreement with Summit. Interim B-CU President Hubert Grimes, a retired judge, served as general counsel for B-CU and was instrumental in reaching the agreement. Grimes endorsed and strongly encouraged B-CU students to attend this dreadful law school. His predecessor, Edison Jackson, also supported this bad deal.\n\nCurrently and during the last several years the judgment of B-CU’s leadership has bordered recklessness, as evidenced by the fiscal mismanagement and several pending lawsuits. Did Grimes, an integral part of former Jackson’s leadership team, do his homework prior to endorsing this dismal agreement? I pray none of our students were impacted by any such agreement.\n\nEngaging in due diligence seems a foreign concept to the B-CU leadership. Perhaps they do not care about the continued existence of B-CU.\n\nI reiterate the position I have made known: B-CU deserves strong, competent, and untainted leadership. Grimes does not pass the test.\n\nJohnny L. McCray Jr., Pompano Beach\n\n— McCray served as a nine-year member of the Bethune-Cookman Board of Trustees. He is a practicing attorney in South Florida, and a 1978 graduate of B-CU."
