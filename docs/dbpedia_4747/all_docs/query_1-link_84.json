        "text": "During the 2024 application cycle, 1,605 people applied and 471 were offered admission.\n\nUniversity of Arizona has a 1L class size of 119, and yield of 25.05%. 118 out of 471 applicants who were offered admission accepted, meaning that 25.05% of the people who were offered admission ended up attending the school.\n\nThe 1L class at University of Arizona has a median LSAT of 163. The 25th percentile LSAT is 159 and the 75th percentile LSAT is 164.\n\nThe median GPA is 3.79. The 25th percentile GPA is 3.58 and the 75th percentile GPA is 3.88.\n\nThe University of Arizona James E. Rogers College of Law has a long-standing national reputation for educational excellence and rigor. We value diversity of thought, background, experience, and culture in every dimension of the law school experience.\n\nIn the words of our students, University of Arizona Law “defies all stereotypes” when it comes to the experience you might expect at a top-tier law school. We pride ourselves on our famously collegial community, direct access to renowned faculty, a career development office with one of the best track records in the country, and a forward-thinking mindset that continuously seeks out new opportunities for our students.\n\nBut we’re more than just a law school.\n\nArizona Law is part of the University of Arizona, one of the country’s top research institutions, where you’ll find people celebrating the successful launch of a UA-led NASA mission right alongside another win from the championship basketball team. UA’s programs in environmental science, astronomy, optics, and geology are among the world’s best. The Eller College of Management—next door to the law school—delivers top-ranked programs available to law students seeking careers in law and business. Arizona Law faculty and students also work with many other highly regarded programs across campus, depending on their career and research interests.\n\nThe University of Arizona and Arizona Law have a strong history of serving military veterans, providing “one-stop” assistance and additional support. International students will find a welcoming community and well-developed services such as the Center for English as a Second Language.\n\nBeyond UA’s borders lies the metropolitan Tucson area of about one million people. We enjoy some 350 days each year of sunny weather, perfect for exploring outdoor activities and Tucson’s spectacular landscape. Here you will never run out of delicious food—Tucson was recently named a United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World City of Gastronomy, the first city in the United States to receive the designation. And while Tucson is culturally rich, it remains the most affordable big city in the United States, so you can afford to enjoy all the city offers."
