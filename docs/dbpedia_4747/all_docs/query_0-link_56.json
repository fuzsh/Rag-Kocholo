        "text": "School-specific borrowing data come from U.S. News & World Report, which relies on data reported to U.S. News by law schools. In some cases, law schools do not report the percentage borrowing properly. When that occurs, the previous year's rate is used unless a school reports the correct rate to LST or a better estimate can be generated. Graduate data come from the American Bar Association.\n\nTo calculate the amount cumulatively borrowed by law school graduates from a law school, LST took the number of graduates and multiplied it times the percentage of those graduates borrowing loans processed by the school. LST rounded that number to the nearest whole graduate and multiplied it times the average amount borrowed for that school. The known federal government investment figures do not include students who never graduated and those enrolled in non-J.D. programs.\n\nNote: The \"amount borrowed\" does not include interest that accumulates during law school, thus is different than the \"amount owed\" or \"debt.\""
