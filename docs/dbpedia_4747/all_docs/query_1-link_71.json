        "text": "Arizona Law accepts the LSAT, GRE or JD-Next, as long as the score was earned within five years of the expected date of entry into law school.\n\nIf you have already taken the LSAT, your LSAT score will be used in making your admissions decision. You may apply before you take the LSAT or GRE or receive your score, but your application will not be complete until we have received your official score report for either test or the JD-Next exam.\n\nLSAT Applicants\n\nApplicants who take the LSAT must only submit an application to the University of Arizona James E. Rogers College of Law via the Law School Admissions Council (LSAC) and participate in the Credential Assembly Service provided by LSAC. LSAC will then forward your LSAT results for the prior five years to us as part of their comprehensive application services.\n\nThe last LSAT administration we are able to consider is the June 2025 test.\n\nGRE Applicants\n\nApplicants who elect to take the GRE (instead of the LSAT) must instruct the Educational Testing Service (ETS) to send the University of Arizona James E. Rogers College of Law all GRE test scores from the prior five-year period.\n\nApplicants who have taken the GRE can log in to their ETS account and select the University of Arizona as a recipient of GRE results using the ETS UA code: 2670.\n\nApplicants electing to take the GRE must also participate in the LSAC Credential Assembly Service.\n\nThe last date an applicant can sit for the GRE is June 2024.\n\nNew Admissions Pathway: JD-Next\n\nFounded at University of Arizona Law in 2019, JD-Next is a fully online, non-credit course that exposes students to the fundamental reading and analysis skills they will further develop in law school. The course culminates in an exam, shown to be a valid and reliable predictor of success, without the substantial racial disparities that infect other admissions exams. The ABA has officially granted a request to allow schools to admit students using scores from the JD-Next exam which means you can apply to law school without taking the LSAT or the GRE.\n\nFuture course and exam dates can be found on the Aspen Publishing website here.\n\nJD-Next scores from the May administration will not be available in time to apply for fall 2024."
