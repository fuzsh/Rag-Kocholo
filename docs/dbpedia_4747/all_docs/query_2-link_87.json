        "text": "Studying for an LLM (Master of Laws) Program in Arizona\n\nIn terms of its population Arizona is one of the fastest growing states in the USA, and it has plenty of natural beauty to boast about, too, including 3,900 mountain peaks to explore. It’s the home of the Grand Canyon and Monument Valley, two of America's most iconic places, plus it was also where the Apache roamed in frontier days. This state still has the largest percentage of Native American tribal land of any other state in America. There are also plenty of tales of gunfighters, cowboys, miners and lawmen in the frontier history of Arizona, with the historical mining town of Tombstone located here – Tombstone is where the Earp brothers faced the Clantons in the famous Gunfight at the OK Corral! Thankfully, things are a little more peaceful these days, and Tombstone is major tourist attraction, located in Cochise County.\n\nThe state capital of Phoenix is now the sixth most populous state in the USA, and there is a strong Hispanic presence in the food and culture of the state. A diverse, fascinating and stimulating place to study, Arizona can offer a great mix for students, whatever their hobbies or social interests. The sunshine is also plentiful here, and it can get very hot indeed during summer, so a liking for warm weather is important if you are planning on moving here for your studies as temperatures regularly hit 100 degrees during the summer months!\n\nArizona is located in the southwestern quadrant of the United States and is bordered by California, Nevada, Utah and New Mexico.\n\nSearch our database of LLM programs in the USA\n\nLaw schools based in Arizona\n\nArizona is home to three of the country's top law schools. For students wanting to study and live in the capital of Phoenix, the Arizona Summit Law School is the place. Then there is also the Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law which is part of Arizona State University, and is located in the town of Tempe. The third option is the James E Rogers College of Law at the University of Arizona, which is based in Tucson.\n\nWhat to study in Arizona\n\nThe James E Rogers School of Law offers three LLM programs, these are in International Trade & Business Law, Indigenous Peoples Law and Policy, and a Doctorate of Juridical Science (SJD). The large number of Native Americans in the state means that this is one of the best places to study law relating to Indigenous Peoples in the country. These are all full-time courses.\n\nThe Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law offers a larger range of programs, providing students with the chance to study for LLMs in Biotechnology and Genomics; Tribal Policy, Law, and Government; Global Legal Studies; and Public Health Law and Policy. Students can also customize their LLM to suit them personally. The opportunity also exists to study for a Master of Legal Studies (MLS) qualification here.\n\nNotable Arizona alumni\n\nRuth McGregor, former Arizona Supreme Court Chief Justice, studied at the Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law. Diane Humetewa, first female Native American US Attorney, and former US Attorney for the District of Arizona, also attended this college. Many US federal judges attended James E Rogers School of Law, including Mary Anne Richey and John Roll.\n\nTuition fees & living costs in Arizona\n\nIn general terms, studying for an LLM in Arizona can be comparatively cheap, certainly when compared with other parts of the United States. Tuition fees range from around $27,000 for a US resident to just over $40,000 for a non-resident. The total costs, including books, accommodation, loan fees and travel should come to around $48,000 in total for a resident, and up to $65,000 for a non-resident.\n\nCase study\n\nBrian Musa from Kenya is studying an LLM program at the Sandra Day O’Connor School of Law:\n\n\"I'm doing my Masters of Law at Sandra Day O'Connor School of Law. My interest is in intellectual property, especially high-technology licensing, and Sandra Day O'Connor proved to be the best choice for this. I'd say I've enjoyed my experience, starting from the day I came in. The faculty assisted me in settling down, and along the way I made friends. The faculty also assisted me in finding a job. I was impressed by the standard of education you get from here. It's beyond what I expected. There is a lot of support for international students.\"\n\nApplications & admissions in Arizona\n\nApplications for any law school are very competitive, as well as excellent academic results, fitness for the program can also be demonstrated by means of extra-curricular activities, hobbies and interests, voluntary work and any other achievements which might be relevant. You must also be able to sell yourself well at interview.\n\nStudents from overseas must hold a first-class degree in law in their own country. They must also be able to demonstrate proficiency in the English language, preferably via means of TOEFL scores.\n\nIf you are from overseas you will have to meet certain visa requirements before you can start studying your LLM program to a law school in Arizona. Your chosen university should be able to help you with this.\n\nWhat to do in Arizona when you aren’t studying\n\nThere is a great range of leisure activities to pursue in Arizona, especially if you enjoy the great outdoors. The desert and mountains make for a wonderful wilderness of lovers of hiking, biking and other outdoor activities. The world's largest ponderosa pine forest can be found near Flagstaff, while sports fans can find a huge number of professional and college teams to back, including NBA outfit the Phoenix Suns, the Arizona Cardinals of the NFL, and Arizona Diamondbacks Major League Baseball team. Some baseball teams also use the state for Spring Training.\n\nIf you’re after culture then the Phoenix Art Museum has a huge range of art works on display from across the world, while the Heard Museum, also in Phoenix, houses a great collection of Native American art and cultural artefacts.\n\nWhat other US states can you study in?\n\nThere are plenty of LLM opportunities for those interested in the living and studying in the United States and we have essential LLM study guides to over 20 US states, including:\n\nLLM in Georgia\n\nLLM in Hawaii\n\nLLM in Illinois\n\nLLM in Indiana\n\nLLM in Louisiana\n\nFind your PERFECT LLM PROGRAM\n\nRelated articles\n\nHow Do You Choose The Best US State For Your LLM Studies?\n\nStudying An LLM In Other Parts Of The USA\n\nOther Worldwide Destinations\n\nLLM Funding"
