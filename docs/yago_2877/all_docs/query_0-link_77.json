He once said, his mother called him a “marked” baby because of his early obsession with railroads, a theme that would resonate throughout his life.\n\nEarly Life/Family\n\nEducation/Training\n\nSanta Barbara School of Art\n\nCareer Outline\n\nHe joined The Walt Disney Studios, in 1934, and contributed to most all of its beloved animated features up until his retirement in 1972.\n\nComments On Style\n\nFellow Disney Legend Eric Larson once wrote of Ward’s animation style: “A powerful caricaturist of mood and action, Ward often used the same approach in his scene planning and cutting, as was shown in the first meeting of Donald Duck, Jose Carioca [the parrot] and Panchito [the rooster] in “The Three Caballeros.” The action and cutting [developed by Ward] was wild, woolly and humorous.”??Although Kimball was known as one of the Nine Old Men (nine master Disney animators that were known as the “Supreme Court of Animation”), his style of drawing was completely opposite to the way the other eight men viewed animation. The eight were proponents and masters of what was known as “The Illusion of Life” (as Disney animation has been called), which called for animating a character from within based on personality. Kimball would instead draw his characters based on a satirical point of view and the exaggeration of human characteristics.\n\nInfluences\n\nPersonality\n\nAnecdotes\n\nAnecdotes??(About his youth and working for Walt Disney) “We thought we were always going to be 21 years old. We thought we would always be putting goldfish in the bottled drinking water, balancing cups of water on the light fixtures, changing the labels on cans of sauerkraut juice. We were 21 years old, Walt was 30, leading the pack. Working there was more fun than any job I could ever imagine.”\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nWard also directed two Academy Award®-winning short subjects including, “Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom,” which was the first CinemaScope cartoon, and “It’s Tough to Be a Bird,” which featured both live-action and animation combined.\n\nWhile at Disney, Ward, a trombone-player, also led several fellow Disney employees in the internationally-known Dixieland jazz band “Firehouse Five Plus Two.” He also restored and operated a full-size locomotive on his two-acre orange grove and was instrumental in sparking Walt Disney’s own interest in backyard railroads.\n\nFilmography\n\nMiscellaneous Crew – filmography\n\nThe Tortoise and the Hare (1934) (animator)\n\nThe Wise Little Hen (1934) (inbetween artist)\n\nOrphan’s Benefit (1934) (inbetween artist)\n\nThe Goddess of Spring (1934) (inbetween artist)\n\nElmer Elephant (1936) (animator)\n\nToby Tortoise Returns (1936) (animator)\n\nWoodland Café (1937) (animator)\n\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) (animator)\n\nFerdinand the Bull (1938) (animator)?Mother Goose Goes Hollywood (1938) (animator)\n\nPinocchio (1940) (animation director)\n\nFantasia (1940) (animation supervisor) (segment “The Pastoral Symphony”)?The Little Whirlwind (1941) (animator)\n\nThe Nifty Nineties (1941) (animator)\n\nDumbo (1941) (animator director)\n\nThe Spirit of ’43 (1943) (animator)\n\nEducation for Death (1943) (animator) ?… aka The Story of One of Hitlers Children as Adapted from: Education for Death – The Making of the Nazi (USA: complete title)\n\nVictory Through Air Power (1943) (animator)\n\nReason and Emotion (1943) (animator)\n\nThe Three Caballeros (1944) (animator)?Make Mine Music (1946) (animator)\n\nWillie the Operatic Whale (1946) (animator) ?… aka Opera Pathetique (USA: new title) ?… aka The Whale Who Wanted to Sing at the Met (USA: new title)\n\nPeter and the Wolf (1946) (animator)\n\nFun and Fancy Free (1947) (directing animator)\n\nPecos Bill (1948) (animator)\n\nMelody Time (1948) (directing animator)\n\nThe Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad (1949) (directing animator) ?… aka Ichabod and Mr. Toad (USA: promotional title) ?… aka The Legend of Sleepy Hollow (USA: TV title) ?… aka The Madcap Adventures of Mr. Toad\n\nCinderella (1950) (animator)\n\nAlice in Wonderland (1951) (directing animator)\n\nPeter Pan (1953) (directing animator)\n\nMelody (1953) (animator) ?… aka Adventures in Music: Melody (USA: complete title)\n\nToot Whistle Plunk and Boom (1953) (animator) ?… aka Adventures in Music: Toot Whistle Plunk and Boom (USA: complete title)\n\n“Disneyland” (1954) TV Series (animator) ?… aka Disney’s Wonderful World (USA: new title) ?… aka The Disney Sunday Movie (USA: new title) ?… aka The Magical World of Disney (USA: new title) ?… aka The Wonderful World of Disney (USA: new title) ?… aka Walt Disney (USA: new title) ?… aka Walt Disney Presents (USA: new title) ?… aka Walt Disney’s Wonderful World of Color (USA: new title)\n\nThe Legend of Sleepy Hollow (1958) (animator)\n\nMary Poppins (1964) (animator)\n\nThe Adventures of Bullwhip Griffin (1967) (title designer)\n\nThe Million Dollar Duck (1971) (title designer)\n\nBedknobs and Broomsticks (1971) (animation director) ?… aka Bedknobs and Broomsticks: 25th Anniversary Special Edition (USA: longer version)\n\nMickey Mouse Disco (1979) (animator)\n\nThe Story Behind Walt Disney’s ‘Fun and Fancy Free’ (1997) (V) (special thanks: for sharing their memories)\n\nWalt: The Man Behind the Myth (2001) (TV) (footage courtesy of)\n\nPollyanna: Making of a Masterpiece (2002) (V) (special thanks)?\n\n?Director – filmography\n\nMelody (1953) ?… aka Adventures in Music: Melody (USA: complete title)\n\nToot Whistle Plunk and Boom (1953) ?… aka Adventures in Music: Toot Whistle Plunk and Boom (USA: complete title)?Man in Space (1955) (TV)\n\nMan and the Moon (1955) (TV) ?… aka Tomorrow the Moon (USA: reissue title)\n\nCosmic Capers (1957)\n\nMars and Beyond (1957) (TV)\n\nThe Mickey Mouse Anniversary Show (1968)\n\nIt’s Tough to Be a Bird (1969)\n\nDad, Can I Borrow the Car?
