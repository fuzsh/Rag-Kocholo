Two other episodes followed soon after all of which were intended to promote subliminally Tomorrowland to the American Public before Disneyland was to open its doors on July 17, 1955!\n\nIntroduced by Walt Disney as one of his “Tomorrowland” programs, “Man in Space” mixes education and entertainment in a strangely effective mix. Renowned animator Ward Kimball directs and narrates this presentation, which received an Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary Short. We look back to Jules Verne's stories and Georges Méliès’ early short A Trip to the Moon. Kimball moves quickly and gives an informative overview using animation and video clips. The journey then leads to increasingly powerful rockets, which were still progressing in the 1950s.\n\nIt has been said that Disney needed quite a bit of cash to promote those episodes and Disneyland's marketing and promotions budget was way over not to mention that folks were drawn to Tomorrowland over the other realms at Disneyland. Almost 72% of the ticket holders would visit Tomorrowland first before heading to the other realms.\n\nIt is also known throughout the ranks at Disney Studios, that Walt was told to promote his Tomorrowland so that Americans would buy into the Space Race via a positive Public Relations Campaign.\n\nT. Keith Glennan went by the name Keith was appointed the first administrator of the US Space Program in 1957 by President Eisenhower. Mr. Keith Glennan was a Paramount executive who knew how to get worldwide publicity and excite the press in his favor and did a great job raising money for the space program from the Republicans and Democrats alike. At the time, it was someone in the Hollywood elite that convinced President Eisenhower to take on Glennan.\n\nMany folks in those circles at that time hinted it was Mr. Disney who made that phone call to Eisenhower. Interestingly enough, Disney could have made a call to Colonel John Powers to make that phone call on his behalf. But Disney had bigger plans at the time and those plans included an amusement park called Disneyland. So as fate has it, Mr. Disney Dreamed and Did It!\n\nIt is amazing how it could have been the other way around. What if that certain person did not make that phone call to Eisenhower and what happened if the money raised to finish Disneyland from ABC never came? I wonder who would have been the King of the Space Program or the King of Hollywood and amusement Parks.\n\nI believe if it was not for Walt Disney and the “Man in Space” Disneyland TV series, we may have lost the Space Race. Ironically, it is said that not only did Vice President Nixon and his family, get their day at Disneyland on opening day but a young President named Jack and his family did as well."
