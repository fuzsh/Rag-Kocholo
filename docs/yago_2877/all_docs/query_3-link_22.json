        "text": "Ward Kimball, a Disney animator who created Jiminy Cricket, updated Mickey Mouse and brought the crows to life in a famous scene in ''Dumbo,'' died on Monday in Arcadia, Calif. He was 88 and lived in San Gabriel, Calif.\n\nMr. Kimball was hired by Walt Disney in 1934 and became part of his inner circle of animators, known jokingly as the ''nine old men.'' He worked as the animator or directing animator on such Disney classics as ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,'' ''Pinocchio,'' ''Fantasia,'' ''The Three Caballeros,'' ''Cinderella,'' ''Mary Poppins'' and ''Peter Pan.'' In 1938, he was part of the team that redesigned Mickey Mouse, giving him more expressive eyes and puffier, friendlier cheeks.\n\nMr. Kimball also headed the group that produced two Oscar-winning shorts, ''Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom'' (1953) and ''It's Tough to Be a Bird'' (1969).\n\nJohn Canemaker, the author of ''Disney's Nine Old Men and the Art of Animation'' (Disney Editions, 2001), said yesterday that Jiminy Cricket, Pinocchio's effervescent conscience, was a lot like his creator. ''Ward was a feisty, plucky short guy with a big personality who wasn't shoved around by any man or cricket,'' Mr. Canemaker said.\n\n''There was something of the old song-and-dance vaudevillian in both of them.''\n\nWard Kimball was born on March 4, 1914, in Minneapolis and attended the Santa Barbara School of the Arts with the intent of becoming a painter and illustrator. In March 1934, an instructor there urged him to submit a portfolio to the Walt Disney Studio in Los Angeles. Mr. Kimball started a month later and remained with Disney until he retired in 1973.\n\nAmong his favorite work was the animation of the crows who laugh, sing and strut while giving Dumbo an important lesson in self-confidence. He also took pride in the madcap finale of ''The Three Caballeros'' where Donald Duck, Jose Carioca and Panchito zip madly about the screen performing the title number as props appear and disappear. Mr. Canemaker, the author, said that the scene was MTV before anyone knew what MTV was.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
