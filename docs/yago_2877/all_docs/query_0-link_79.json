        "text": "Ward Kimball, Academy Award(R)-Winning Disney Animator/Director Who Brought\n\nLife to Mickey Mouse, Jiminy Cricket, The Cheshire Cat, The Mad Hatter And\n\nThe Three Caballeros,' Dies at Age 88\n\nBURBANK, Calif., July 8 /PRNewswire/ -- Ward Kimball, a pioneering giant of\n\nanimation who became one of Walt Disney's trusted \"Nine Old Men\" and was\n\nclosely associated with such memorable characters as Mickey Mouse, Jiminy\n\nCricket and the Mad Hatter, passed away today (7/8) from natural causes at\n\nArcadia Methodist Hospital in Arcadia, California. He was 88 years old. The\n\niconoclastic artist joined the Disney Studios in 1934 and worked there until\n\nhis retirement in 1973. He animated or served as directing animator on such\n\nclassic films as \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,\" \"Pinocchio,\" \"Fantasia,\"\n\n\"The Reluctant Dragon,\" \"The Three Caballeros,\" \"Melody Time,\" \"Cinderella,\"\n\n\"Alice in Wonderland,\" \"Peter Pan,\" \"Mary Poppins,\" and \"Bedknobs and\n\nBroomsticks.\" Two of the animated shorts which Kimball created for Disney --\n\n\"Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom\" (1953) and \"It's Tough to be a Bird\" (1969)\n\n-- won Academy Awards(R). Among his other career highlights, he wrote the\n\nstories for and directed a landmark trio of television shows for the\n\n\"Disneyland\" show -- \"Man in Space,\" \"Man and the Moon,\" and \"Mars and\n\nBeyond\" -- which helped to spark interest in space travel....\n\nHey, DMC!\n\nJust a few weeks ago, I bought the \"Firehouse Five Plus Two Crashes A Party\" CD at the Border's on Michigan Ave. You can preview all the CDs there and a friend asked me to play a little for him. After a few seconds, he pulled off the earphones and scoffed, \"Sounds like something your mother would listen to.\"\n\nLast week, I played the CD for my mom and asked her whether she knew who it was. She said, \"Sure. I used to have that record.\" She didn't even know it was Ward Kimball, Frank Thomas, et al. She just liked the music. I'll be listening to it tonight on the way home from work.\n\nRegards,\n\nJon"
