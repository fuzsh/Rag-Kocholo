        "text": "Description\n\n(Walt Disney Studios, circa 1956) Original production cels featuring Ward Kimball (as a caveman) and a purple-clad cavewoman from a Disneyland TV show of the 1950s, probably the episode 'The History of Fire' circa 1956. The cels are placed on a Disney lithograph background. Kimball's image measures 2.75 x 5.75 and the cavewoman measures 2.5 x 6.5, with overall dimensions of 12 x 10. Originally sold at Disneyland's Art Corner and reverse bears a gold label stating that it is an original hand-painted celluloid actually used in a Walt Disney production. In fine condition. Remembered as one of Disney's 'Nine Old Men,' animator Ward Kimball directed many of the Disneyland TV show's 'History' episodes during the 1950s, often inserting himself as a character."
