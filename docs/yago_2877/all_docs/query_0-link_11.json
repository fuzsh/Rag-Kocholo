        "text": "It was the early seventies at the Walt Disney studios in Burbank, California. A group of aspiring artists eager to begin their careers were gathered together for their orientation into Disney’s Animation Department. As the young artists talked amongst themselves, they were caught off guard when Ward Kimball poked his head in the door’s entrance and shouted to the fledgling animators, “Walt’s dead and you missed it!”\n\nI was in awe of Ward Kimball long before coming to the Disney studio. I was a fan who loved his drawings, animation, and the music of the Firehouse Five plus Two. I was familiar with Ward as an artist and musician because I grew up in Santa Barbara where the old timers were continually telling me stories about the kid who led the band at the Saturday afternoon matinees. By the time I was hoping for a career in animation, Ward Kimball had already become somewhat of a legend at the Disney studio.\n\nDuring those wonderful fifties days, being an animator at the Walt Disney studio was fun. Ward Kimball certainly added to the wild and crazy pranks often played at the studio. Who can forget Ward coming to work in a gorilla suit, or the afternoon Kimball played music so loud it rattled the windows. Stuff like that would get us fired today. However, Walt Disney took it in stride. This was the cartoon business after all, and cartoonists were supposed to be “crazy.”\n\nKimball’s office was in D-Wing, on the first floor of the Animation Building. If you were not sure how to find the office of the famous animator, you need only listen for the music. I think Kimball was the only artist at Disney where a piano was considered a necessary piece of equipment. As you can imagine, The Firehouse Five plus Two rehearsed at lunchtime, and if you didn’t care for Dixieland jazz, you had best eat your lunch outside. In time, Kimball moved upstairs to direct two wonderful cartoon shorts. The series was called “Adventures in Music,” and the first film, “Melody,” was a humorous depiction of a man’s life, from birth to death. The film was a departure from the Disney “house style,” utilizing bold graphic design and stylized animation. The second film, “Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom” won Walt Disney an Academy Award for best animated short of 1955.\n\nNow it was 1958, and Kimball was producing and directing those wonderful science factual programs for the Disneyland television show. I remember a dubbing session where the film was “wrapped,” and Ward leapt from his chair and danced a jig on the floor of the recording studio. Such was the man’s enthusiasm for his work. Kimball’s unit had already produced, “Man in Space,” Man and the Moon,” and “Man and Mars,” Yet, Walt Disney was not always pleased with the work Kimball’s unit was producing. I remember the aftermath of a late afternoon screening back in the fifties. Walt and Ward were in the lobby as we filed out of the theater. The Old Maestro was reading Ward the riot act because of the film he had just seen. As usual, Ward stood his ground. He even refused to use Donald Duck in a show even though Walt had requested it. Taking a dig at the boss, Ward even included the famous duck quacking through a scene in one of his space films. Some at the studio saw this irreverent behavior as a sign that Kimball was getting “too big for his breeches.” The unit was gearing up to produce another film based on NASA’s Vanguard rocket. This was the United States’ hope to catch up with the Soviets who had already launched “Sputnik” into space. Our hopes were dashed when Vanguard blew up on the launch pad. When I arrived at Kimball’s office that morning I noticed Ward had hung a huge black wreath on the “Vanguard” storyboards.\n\nUndaunted, Ward went on to produce and direct another show entitled, “Magic Highway,” but Ward’s unit was beginning to fragment. One of his best artists, John Brandt died of heart problems, and conceptualist, Con Pederson left to work in London with Stanley Kubrick on his new film, “2001.” In spite of these changes, the unit began gearing up for a major new project. Ward was going to produce and direct a live-action musical feature entitled, “Babes in Toyland.” It was exciting to watch sets being designed, and Ward was shooting tests with the actors out on stage two. However, there was a misunderstanding with Walt, and suddenly, things turned for the worse. Ward Kimball was removed from “Babes in Toyland’ and replaced by a new director, Jack Donahue.\n\nKimball’s fall from grace came as a shock to all of us. Many thought that Ward had finally gone too far, and this was Walt’s way of asserting that he, not Kimball was still the boss. The talented producer, writer, director was sent back to the drawing board as an animator. Who could have imagined that being sent to animate was a demotion, but in Ward’s case I guess it was. For the younger animators like myself having Ward animating again was an opportunity because we could learn from him. I was lucky enough to work on some of Kimball’s scenes, and I was amazed at how fast he worked. Even though Ward probably hated animating Ludwig Von Drake, he produced his animation with professional ease, knocking out prodigious amounts of footage. With Kimball, animating appeared to be a breeze. I think that’s why he stopped animating. It was no longer a challenge for him. He wanted to move on to other things.\n\nThe sixties brought a new Kimball to the Disney studio. John Kimball and I met and became the best of friends. John, like his famous dad was an artist and musician as well. Because John and I both shared a love of animation, we decided to make our own cartoons. We invested in camera equipment, and began building our own animation stands. In a generous gesture that would be unheard of today, Disney’s machine shop offered their assistance. John and I began having screenings of cartoons on Saturday nights at his sister, Kelly’s home in Highland Park. On occasion, Ward and Betty Kimball would join us for the movie. The movie was only the “pre show” as far as I was concern. After the film, Kimball would regale us with tales of the early Disney studio and other affairs of the day. Why he voted for Upton Sinclair in the thirties Governor’s race, and the reasons he crossed the picket lines in the famous Disney strike. Ward spent a fair amount of time with the boss, and he told us what it was like working for Walt Disney. Finally, my favorite story of all was the “wild weekend party” after the completion of “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.” For all the kids today who think their parents and grandparents were sexually repressed, think again. Then there were the social occasions that included playing in Ward’s Dixieland band. On one particular session I was playing pretty bad because the keys on my saxophone began to stick. Ward began shouting at me, “Play whole notes! Play whole notes!”\n\nWalt Disney’s passing in 1966 was a major setback, and it took some time for the studio to recover. Yet, after a time, Ward Kimball established another unit, this time in 2-A wing on the second floor of the Animation Building. Once again, Ward Kimball was back in fine form producing clever, entertaining films for both theatrical release and television. His “Tough to be a Bird” even garnered Ward an Academy Award for best-animated short, and he picked up the statuette himself at the award ceremony. In the seventies, Kimball launched an odd half hour television show called, “The Mouse Factory.” The quirky show was a mix of vintage Disney cartoons along with appearances by guest stars such as Phyllis Diller, Joanne Worley, and even Mouseketeer Annette Funicello. Some Disney old timers continued to criticize Ward for his irreverence. Kimball, as always had a way of “breaking the rules,” whatever those rules happen to be. I think secretly they resented Kimball’s boundless creativity, and decided to reign in the master animator. Kimball was having none of this, and instead of bending to the new “rule makers,” he decided to call it quits. Ward Kimball leaving Disney? We could hardly believe the news that came from the second floor of the Animation Building that Thursday afternoon. Yet, Kimball confirmed the rumor to be true. He had decided to leave Disney because in his own words, “the job simply wasn’t fun anymore.”\n\nYet, lucky for all of us, Kimball didn’t go far. Soon, he began work for Disney Imagineering bringing his own special blend of humor and imagination to a number of attractions for Walt Disney World. It was now the eighties, and Disney was under new management. Occasionally Ward would come to the Disney commissary for lunch. Of course, we had to get the scoop from Ward. What project would he tackle next, or was he looking to finally retire. As always, Ward said he would take on any job as long as it was fun. Kimball kept his word, and continued with the company until Imagineering, like so much of the Disney Company in recent times, simply wasn’t fun anymore.\n\nIn the new decade, Ward Kimball seemed to settle back and accept his title of “Disney Legend.” He made appearances at art shows, and lectured to a new generation of Disney animators. At one such affair, I spoke with Ward about the small aircraft that found itself in trouble over the San Gabriel Valley. Almost in cartoon fashion, the aircraft came crashing to earth in of all places, Ward Kimball’s front yard. This was a bizarre accident to be sure, yet somehow, typical of a normal day in Kimball’s life. In one of his last public appearances, Ward joined Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston onstage at Walt Disney’s 100th Birthday party. Host, Leonard Maltin spoke of the wonderful, wild, wacky sequence that Kimball animated in, “The Three Caballeros.” Ward jumped to his feet and shouted, “I broke all the rules! I broke all the rules!” That pretty much sums up the life and career of Kimball.\n\nWard Kimball was a guy who represented the best of Disney in its Golden Age. He was always curious, clever and unpredictable. If you were lucky enough to be called to Kimball’s unit back in the sixties, jealous colleagues often grumbled, “Oh, you’re going to go work for the genius.” We ignored their sarcasm because like it or not, that’s exactly what Ward Kimball was.\n\nFloyd Norman\n\nDisneyland in Anaheim, California, holds a special place in the hearts of Disney fans worldwide, I mean heck, it’s where the magic began after all. Over the years it’s become a place that people visit in search of memorable experiences. One fan favorite area of the park is Mickey’s Toontown, a unique land that lets guests step right into the colorful, “Toony” world of Disney animation. With the recent reimagining of the land and the introduction of Micky and Minnies Runaway Railway, have you ever wondered how this land came to be?\n\nThere is a fascinating backstory of how Mickey’s Toontown came into existence. It’s a tale of strategic vision, the influence of Disney executives, and a commitment to meeting the needs of Disney’s valued guests.\n\nThe Beginning: Mickey’s Birthdayland\n\nThe story of Mickey’s Toontown starts with Mickey’s Birthdayland at Walt Disney World’s Magic Kingdom. Opened in 1988 to celebrate Mickey Mouse’s 60th birthday, this temporary attraction was met with such overwhelming popularity that it inspired Disney executives to think bigger. The idea was to create a permanent, immersive land where guests could step into the animated world of Mickey Mouse and his friends.\n\nIn the early ’90s, Disneyland was in need of a refresh. Michael Eisner, the visionary leader of The Walt Disney Company at the time, had an audacious idea: create a brand-new land in Disneyland that would celebrate Disney characters in a whole new way. This was the birth of Mickey’s Toontown.\n\nInitially, Disney’s creative minds toyed with various concepts, including the idea of crafting a 100-Acre Woods or a land inspired by the Muppets. However, the turning point came when they considered the success of “Who Framed Roger Rabbit.” This film’s popularity and the desire to capitalize on contemporary trends set the stage for Toontown’s creation.\n\nFrom Concept to Reality: The Birth of Toontown\n\nIn 1993, Mickey’s Toontown opened its gates at Disneyland, marking the first time in Disney Park history where guests could experience a fully realized, three-dimensional world of animation. This new land was not just a collection of attractions but a living, breathing community where Disney characters “lived,” worked, and played.\n\nBuilding Challenges: Innovative Solutions\n\nThe design of Mickey’s Toontown broke new ground in theme park aesthetics. Imagineers were tasked with bringing the two-dimensional world of cartoons into a three-dimensional space. This led to the creation of over 2000 custom-built props and structures that embodied the ‘squash and stretch’ principle of animation, giving Toontown its distinctiveness.\n\nAnd then there was also the challenge of hiding the Team Disney Anaheim building, which bore a striking resemblance to a giant hotdog. The Imagineers had to think creatively, using balloon tests and imaginative landscaping to seamlessly integrate Toontown into the larger park.\n\nKey Attractions: Bringing Animation to Life\n\nMickey’s Toontown featured several groundbreaking attractions. “Roger Rabbit’s Car Toon Spin,” inspired by the movie “Who Framed Roger Rabbit,” became a staple of Toontown, offering an innovative ride experience. Gadget’s Go-Coaster, though initially conceived as a Rescue Rangers-themed ride, became a hit with younger visitors, proving that innovative design could create memorable experiences for all ages.\n\nAnother crown jewel of Toontown is Mickey’s House, a walkthrough attraction that allowed guests to explore the home of Mickey Mouse himself. This attraction was more than just a house; it was a carefully crafted piece of Disney lore. The house was designed in the American Craftsman style, reflecting the era when Mickey would have theoretically purchased his first home in Hollywood. The attention to detail was meticulous, with over 2000 hand-crafted, custom-built props, ensuring that every corner of the house was brimming with character and charm. Interestingly, the design of Mickey’s House was inspired by a real home in Wichita Falls, making it a unique blend of real-world inspiration and Disney magic.\n\nMickey’s House also showcased Disney’s commitment to creating interactive and engaging experiences. Guests could make themselves at home, sitting in Mickey’s chair, listening to the radio, and exploring the many mementos and references to Mickey’s animated adventures throughout the years. This approach to attraction design – where storytelling and interactivity merged seamlessly – was a defining characteristic of ToonTown’s success.\n\nExecutive Decisions: Shaping ToonTown’s Unique Attractions\n\nThe development of Mickey’s Toontown wasn’t just about creative imagination; it was significantly influenced by strategic decisions from Disney executives. One notable input came from Jeffrey Katzenberg, who suggested incorporating a Rescue Rangers-themed ride. This idea was a reflection of the broader Disney strategy to integrate popular contemporary characters and themes into the park, ensuring that the attractions remained relevant and engaging for visitors.\n\nIn addition to Katzenberg’s influence, Frank Wells, the then-President of The Walt Disney Company, played a key role in the strategic launch of Toontown’s attractions. His decision to delay the opening of “Roger Rabbit’s Car Toon Spin” until a year after Toontown’s debut was a calculated move. It was designed to maintain public interest in the park by offering new experiences over time, thereby giving guests more reasons to return to Disneyland.\n\nThese executive decisions highlight the careful planning and foresight that went into making Toontown a dynamic and continuously appealing part of Disneyland. By integrating current trends and strategically planning the rollout of attractions, Disney executives ensured that Toontown would not only capture the hearts of visitors upon its opening but would continue to draw them back for new experiences in the years to follow.\n\nGlobal Influence: Toontown’s Worldwide Appeal\n\nThe concept of Mickey’s Toontown resonated so strongly that it was replicated at Tokyo Disneyland and influenced elements in Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland. Each park’s version of Toontown maintained the core essence of the original while adapting to its cultural and logistical environment.\n\nEvolution and Reimagining: Toontown Today\n\nAs we approach the present day, Mickey’s Toontown has recently undergone a significant reimagining to welcome “Mickey & Minnie’s Runaway Railway” in 2023. This refurbishment aimed to enhance the land’s interactivity and appeal to a new generation of Disney fans, all while retaining the charm that has made ToonTown a beloved destination for nearly three decades.\n\nDive Deeper into ToonTown’s Story\n\nWant to know more about Mickey’s Toontown and hear some fascinating behind-the-scenes stories, then check out the latest episode of Disney Unpacked on Patreon @JimHillMedia.

With its unique Pixar-themed design, it promises to be a favorite among visitors.\n\nHowever, before we delve into this exciting addition to the Disneyland Resort, let’s take a look at the fascinating history of this remarkable hotel.\n\nThe Emergence of the Disneyland Hotel\n\nTo truly appreciate the story of the Pixar Place Hotel, we must turn back the clock to the early days of Disneyland. While Walt Disney had the visionary ideas and funding to create the iconic theme park, he faced a challenge when it came to providing accommodations for the park’s visitors. This is where his friend Jack Wrather enters the picture.\n\nJack Wrather, a fellow pioneer in the television industry, stepped in to assist Walt Disney in realizing his dream. Thanks to the success of the “Lassie” TV show produced by Wrather’s company, he had the financial means to build a hotel right across from Disneyland.\n\nThe result was the Disneyland Hotel, which opened its doors in October 1955. Interestingly, the early incarnation of this hotel had more of a motel feel than a hotel, with two-story buildings reminiscent of the roadside motels popular during the 1950s. The initial Disneyland Hotel consisted of modest structures that catered to visitors looking for affordable lodging close to the park. While the rooms were basic, it marked the beginning of something extraordinary.\n\nThe Evolution: From Emerald of Anaheim to Paradise Pier\n\nAs Disneyland’s popularity continued to soar, so did the demand for expansion and improved accommodations. In 1962, the addition of an 11-story tower transformed the Disneyland Hotel, marking a significant transition from a motel to a full-fledged hotel.\n\nThe addition of the 11-story tower elevated the Disneyland Hotel into a more prominent presence on the Anaheim skyline. At the time, it was the tallest structure in all of Orange County. The hotel’s prime location across from Disneyland made it an ideal choice for visitors. With the introduction of the monorail linking the park and the hotel, accessibility became even more convenient. Unique features like the Japanese-themed reflecting pools added to the hotel’s charm, reflecting a cultural influence that extended beyond Disney’s borders.\n\nJapanese Tourism and Its Impact\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, Disneyland was attracting visitors from all corners of the world, including Japan. A significant number of Japanese tourists flocked to Anaheim to experience Walt Disney’s creation. To cater to this growing market, it wasn’t just the Disneyland Hotel that aimed to capture the attention of Japanese tourists. The Japanese Village in Buena Park, inspired by a similar attraction in Nara, Japan, was another significant spot.\n\nThese attractions sought to provide a taste of Japanese culture and hospitality, showcasing elements like tea ceremonies and beautiful ponds with rare carp and black swans. However, the Japanese Village closed its doors in 1975, likely due to the highly competitive nature of the Southern California tourist market.\n\nThe Emergence of the Emerald of Anaheim\n\nWith the surge in Japanese tourism, an opportunity arose—the construction of the Emerald of Anaheim, later known as the Disneyland Pacific Hotel. In May 1984, this 15-story hotel opened its doors.\n\nWhat made the Emerald unique was its ownership. It was built not by The Walt Disney Company or the Oriental Land Company (which operated Tokyo Disneyland) but by the Tokyu Group. This group of Japanese businessmen already had a pair of hotels in Hawaii and saw potential in Anaheim’s proximity to Disneyland. Thus, they decided to embark on this new venture, specifically designed to cater to Japanese tourists looking to experience Southern California.\n\nFinancial Challenges and a Changing Landscape\n\nThe late 1980s brought about two significant financial crises in Japan—the crash of the NIKKEI stock market and the collapse of the Japanese real estate market. These crises had far-reaching effects, causing Japanese tourists to postpone or cancel their trips to the United States. As a result, reservations at the Emerald of Anaheim dwindled.\n\nTo adapt to these challenging times, the Tokyu Group merged the Emerald brand with its Pacific hotel chain, attempting to weather the storm. However, the financial turmoil took its toll on the Emerald, and changes were imminent.\n\nThe Transition to the Disneyland Pacific Hotel\n\nIn 1995, The Walt Disney Company took a significant step by purchasing the hotel formerly known as the Emerald of Anaheim for $35 million. This acquisition marked a change in the hotel’s fortunes. With Disney now in control, the hotel underwent a name change, becoming the Disneyland Pacific Hotel.\n\nTransformation to Paradise Pier\n\nThe next phase of transformation occurred when Disney decided to rebrand the hotel as Paradise Pier Hotel. This decision aligned with Disney’s broader vision for the Disneyland Resort.\n\nWhile the structural changes were limited, the hotel underwent a significant cosmetic makeover. Its exterior was painted to complement the color scheme of Paradise Pier, and wave-shaped crenellations adorned the rooftop, creating an illusion of seaside charm. This transformation was Disney’s attempt to seamlessly integrate the hotel into the Paradise Pier theme of Disney’s California Adventure Park.\n\nLooking Beyond Paradise Pier: The Shift to Pixar Place\n\nIn 2018, Disneyland Resort rebranded Paradise Pier as Pixar Pier, a thematic area dedicated to celebrating the beloved characters and stories from Pixar Animation Studios. As a part of this transition, it became evident that the hotel formally known as the Disneyland Pacific Hotel could no longer maintain its Paradise Pier theme.\n\nWith Pixar Pier in full swing and two successful Pixar-themed hotels (Toy Story Hotels in Shanghai Disneyland and Tokyo Disneyland), Disney decided to embark on a new venture—a hotel that would celebrate the vast world of Pixar. The result is Pixar Place Hotel, a 15-story tower that embraces the characters and stories from multiple Pixar movies and shorts. This fully Pixar-themed hotel is a first of its kind in the United States.\n\nThe Future of Pixar Place and Disneyland Resort\n\nAs we look ahead to the future, the Disneyland Resort continues to evolve. The recent news of a proposed $1.9 billion expansion as part of the Disneyland Forward project indicates that the area surrounding Pixar Place is expected to see further changes. Disneyland’s rich history and innovative spirit continue to shape its destiny.\n\nIn conclusion, the history of the Pixar Place Hotel is a testament to the ever-changing landscape of Disneyland Resort. From its humble beginnings as the Disneyland Hotel to its transformation into the fully Pixar-themed Pixar Place Hotel, this establishment has undergone several iterations. As Disneyland Resort continues to grow and adapt, we can only imagine what exciting developments lie ahead for this iconic destination.\n\nIf you want to hear more stories about the History of the Pixar Place hotel, check our special edition of Disney Unpacked over on YouTube.\n\nStay tuned for more updates and developments as we continue to explore the fascinating world of Disney, one story at a time.\n\nJim Hill\n\nJim Hill is an entertainment writer who has specialized in covering The Walt Disney Company for nearly 40 years now.

This two-part episode covers all things Mickey’s Birthday Land and how it ultimately led to the inspiration behind Disneyland’s fan-favorite land, “Toontown”. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves here. It all starts in the early days at Disneyland.\n\nEarly Challenges in Meeting Mickey\n\nPicture this: it’s the late 1970s and early 1980s, and you’re at Disneyland. You want to meet the one and only Mickey Mouse, but there’s no clear way to make it happen. You rely on Character Guides, those daily printed sheets that point you in Mickey’s general direction. But let’s be honest, it was like finding a needle in a haystack. Sometimes, you got lucky; other times, not so much.\n\nMickey’s Birthdayland: A Birthday Wish that Came True\n\nFast forward to the late 1980s. Disney World faced a big challenge. The Disney-MGM Studios Theme Park was under construction, with the company’s marketing machine in full swing, hyping up the opening of Walt Disney World’s third theme park, MGM Studios, in the Spring of 1989. This extensive marketing meant that many people were opting to postpone their family’s next trip to Walt Disney World until the following year. Walt Disney World needed something compelling to motivate guests to visit Florida in 1988, the year before Disney MGM Studios opened.\n\nEnter stage left, Mickey’s Birthdayland. For the first time ever, an entire land was dedicated to a single character – and not just any character, but the mouse who started it all. Meeting Mickey was no longer a game of chance; it was practically guaranteed.\n\nThe Birth of Birthdayland: Creative Brilliance Meets Practicality\n\nIn this episode, we dissect the birth of Mickey’s Birthdayland, an initiative that went beyond celebrating a birthday. It was a calculated move, driven by guest feedback and a need to address issues dating back to 1971. Imagineers faced the monumental task of designing an experience that honored Mickey while efficiently managing the crowds. This required the perfect blend of creative flair and logistical prowess – a hallmark of Disney’s approach to theme park design.\n\nEvolution: From Birthdayland to Toontown\n\nThe success of Mickey’s Birthdayland was a real game-changer, setting the stage for the birth of Toontown – an entire land that elevated character-centric areas to monumental new heights. Toontown wasn’t merely a spot to meet characters; it was an immersive experience that brought Disney animation to life. In the episode, we explore its innovative designs, playful architecture, and how every nook and cranny tells a story.\n\nImpact on Disney Parks and Guests\n\nMickey’s Birthdayland and Toontown didn’t just reshape the physical landscape of Disney parks; they transformed the very essence of the guest experience. These lands introduced groundbreaking ways for visitors to connect with their beloved characters, making their Disney vacations even more unforgettable.\n\nBeyond Attractions: A Cultural Influence\n\nBut the influence of these lands goes beyond mere attractions. Our episode delves into how Mickey’s Birthdayland and Toontown left an indelible mark on Disney’s culture, reflecting the company’s relentless dedication to innovation and guest satisfaction. It’s a journey into how a single idea can grow into a cherished cornerstone of the Disney Park experience.\n\nUnwrapping the Full Story of Mickey’s Birthdayland\n\nOur two-part episode of Disney Unpacked is available for your viewing pleasure on our Patreon page.
