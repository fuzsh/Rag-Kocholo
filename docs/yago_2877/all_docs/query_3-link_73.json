        "text": "Travelers using the Perris Multimodal Transit Center, dedicated\n\nin January 2010, will notice Disney cartoon characters in the\n\nmurals decorating the combination bus-train and park-and-ride\n\nstation, which will serve as a Metrolink station in the future.\n\nDisney art might be expected in, say, Anaheim, but the\n\nconnection between Perris and Disney is less obvious. It’s due to\n\nWard Kimball, a longtime Disney animator, and his love of\n\ntrains.\n\nKimball worked on “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,” “Fantasia,”\n\n“Dumbo” and other films and created the Jiminy Cricket character\n\nfor “Pinocchio.” He worked for Walt Disney Studios for some 40\n\nyears, starting in 1934, and won an Academy Award in 1969 for “It’s\n\nTough to Be a Bird.”\n\nKimball, born in 1914, “was nuts about trains,” said Joe Vargo,\n\npublic information officer for the city of Perris.\n\nIn the 1930s and ’40s, Kimball built a narrow-gauge model\n\nrailroad – full-size, to ride it on a 500-foot track – on his\n\nfamily’s homestead in San Gabriel.\n\nHe called it the Grizzly Flats Railroad. Much of the rolling\n\nstock came from railroads dismantling cars and equipment; Kimball\n\nrestored them. Grizzly Flats began with Coach 5, an 1881 car built\n\nfor the Carson & Colorado Railroad. Kimball bought it in 1938\n\nfor $50; it was the Southern Pacific Railroad’s last remaining\n\npassenger car, according to the Orange Empire Railway Museum, in\n\nPerris.\n\nGrizzly Flats grew to include, among other things, an 1881\n\nlocomotive called “Emma Nevada,” from the Nevada Central Railway;\n\nand Chloe, a 1917 sugar plantation locomotive the Kimballs named\n\nfor their daughter.\n\nBeing a train buff, Kimball liked to visit OERM – so much so\n\nthat in 1990, the Kimballs donated much of the Grizzly Flats\n\nRailroad to the museum, plus money to install a four-track engine\n\nhouse to display it. Kimball died in 2002. His widow, Betty, passed\n\naway last year, said John Smatlak, OERM’s vice president of\n\ncollections. But today visitors to OERM can still see Kimball’s\n\nbeloved collection in a big red barn at OERM.\n\nWhen the city of Perris was planning the transit center, civic\n\nleaders, knowing of Kimball’s generosity to the railroad museum,\n\nwanted to honor him by incorporating some of his drawings into the\n\nstation’s décor.\n\nFormer City Councilman John Motte, the Riverside Transit Agency\n\nand Kimball’s son, John, asked Disney officials for permission, and\n\ngot it. That’s quite an accomplishment, because “the Walt Disney\n\nCo. is extremely protective of its brand and legacy, and often\n\ndenies use of its images on schools, walls and other public\n\nvenues,” the city’s website explains. The transit center was also\n\ndedicated to Kimball.\n\nSo Jiminy Crickett, the Mad Hatter and Tweedledum and Tweedledee\n\ngrace the bus shelters in Perris’ transit hub. Motte says on the\n\ncity’s website that he hopes someday people can board a train in\n\nPerris and ride to Disneyland.\n\nOERM is at 2201 South A Street in Perris. For more information,\n\ncall 951-943-3020 or see www.oerm.org. The Perris multimodal\n\nstation is on South C Street between West Fourth and West San\n\nJacinto Avenue."
