        "text": "By Scott Ross\n\nBabes in Toyland (1961) Walt Disney’s first live-action musical is a candy-coated bomb containing some pleasant old Victor Herbert tunes kitted out with new Mel Leven lyrics to replace some of the more dated, fustian originals by Glen MacDonald (the best of them is the comic tango “Castle in Spain,” an amusing turn for Ray Bolger, camping it up as the mustache-twirling villain), a few nice visual touches, Henry Calvin and Gene Sheldon performing homages to Laurel and Hardy, Annette Funicello as Mary Contrary, Tommy Sands doing a drag bit as a gypsy fortune-teller, Tommy Kirk as a hapless inventor and Ed Wynn as a surprisingly cranky and hypocritical Toymaker. The rest of it is over-fed, cloying operetta-fantasy that must have seemed, even in the year of my birth, at least 50 years out of date; I can’t imagine what today’s children would make of it. The best items are the funny little animated curlicues devised by Ward Kimball, who was also responsible for the marching wooden soldiers. (Co-author with Joe Rinaldi and Lowell S. Hawley of the screenplay, Kimball was the original producer until he ruffled Walt’s feathers and was replaced.) Jack Donohue directed, with numbing literal-mindedness. The wrong-headedness of the thing is exemplified by George Bruns and Jud Conlon speeding up the haunting ballad “Toyland” and turning it into a march.\n\nThe Celluloid Closet (1995) The partly-successful documentary based on Vito Russo’s groundbreaking book has much to recommend it but is missing its author’s essential voice, and his anger.\n\nThe Devil’s Brother, aka Fra Diavolo (1933) Whenever Laurel and Hardy are on the screen, this adaptation by Jeanie Macpherson of the 1830 Daniel Auber/Eugène Scribe opéra-comique is wonderful. Unfortunately there’s a plot, and songs, that have nothing to do with them. But coming as it did before strict enforcement of the Production Code began, The Devil’s Brother is sexually frank in a way movies ceased to be after January 1935: It’s perfectly obvious that the rich women who are his unwitting victims are having it off with Dennis King’s murderous jewel thief Fra Diavolo, or (as with Thelma Todd) are about to. The direction by Hal Roach and Charles Rogers is pleasant, as is the cinematography by Hap Depew and Art Lloyd, and the sequence in which Stan is supposed to be filling tankards with wine but gets nearly as much down his own throat as he does the vessels Ollie hands him, growing more and more inebriated, is a classic of its kind, as is his enactment of the game “Kneesey-Earsie-Nosey.” Todd is both luscious and amusing, and L & H’s perennial foil, James Finlayson, appears to good (if too brief) effect as her jealous husband. If you care about such things, Roach directed the musical sequences and Rogers the “book” scenes.\n\nCapricorn One (1977) When I was 16, this crowd-pleasing paranoia thriller written and directed by Peter Hyams about a faked NASA Mars landing satisfied my post-Watergate cynicism about my government and my concomitant delight in seeing dogged investigative reporters (remember them?) portrayed on the screen. Hyams, a sort of poor-man’s Alan J. Pakula, keeps his story moving fast as three astronauts (James Brolin, Sam Waterston and O. J. Simpson back when he was remembered more for his prowess on the football field than for If I Did It) are blackmailed into participating in a massive hoax, escape and are pursued across the desert by a pair of creepily anonymous high-tech black helicopters. Meanwhile, a wobbly reporter (Elliott Gould), tipped off by a NASA employee (Robert Walden) who then mysteriously disappears, latches onto the story and begins piecing it together.\n\nWatching Capricorn One for the first time since it was released I was as pleasantly surprised by how much of it still works as I was annoyed by the things in it, such as Telly Savalas’ profane crop-duster, that seem a sop to then-fashionable audience expectations of low-comedy relief, and the Waterston character’s irritating joke-monologue as he climbs a mesa (why?) What’s most enjoyable about it are Jerry Goldsmith’s superb action score with its propulsive earworm of a main theme; Gould’s performance as the reporter; David Doyle as his cheerfully nasty editor; Hal Holbrook as the duplicitous NASA official heading the operation; and the rich supporting performances of Brenda Vaccaro, Karen Black, David Huddleston, Barbara Bosson and James Karen. Bill Butler provided the occasionally rapturous cinematography and James Mitchell the effective editing. The action set-pieces are generally well-directed by Hyams and there is a moment during the obligatory Hey-wait-my-brakes-are-gone! sequence with Gould where his car sails off a bascule bridge that is, if you have a phobia about these things, absolutely terrifying.\n\nI am, of course, being slightly facetious when I imply there are no more serious investigative journalists in America. There are plenty. But none of them — not one — works for the corporate press (newspaper or magazine) nor for any of the broadcast radio, television or cable networks, staffed as they are almost exclusively by CIA assets or former security-state officials and employees. The names Lee Fang, Aaron Maté, Max Blumenthal, Whitney Webb, Glenn Greenwald, Matt Taibbi, Anya Parampil, Michael Tracey, Johnny Vedmore, Emma-Jo Morris, Michael Shellenberger and Kit Klarenberg are likely unknown to you, unless you make an effort to seek out their reporting or happen to catch a Congressional hearing in which they are as likely as not to be insulted, demeaned, slandered and even threatened by censorship-loving Democrats like that corrupt carpetbagger Stacey Plaskett or her colleague, the equally sleazy and anti-democratic Debbie Wasserman Schultz. But with our permanent government writing the stories it feeds to its lackeys in the corporate media and dictating to social websites what speech it will permit Americans to utter and which beliefs we are now allowed to hold, a free press, essential to a free people, is largely dead in the Land of the Free.\n\nThe Jerk (1979) I wish Steve Martin’s screen debut had been a better, funnier, movie. Taking off from Martin’s old “I was born a poor black child” stand-up routine the screenplay by him, Carl Gottlieb and Michael Elias posits his character as less a jerk than a congenital idiot, but I suppose The Moron wouldn’t have played as well on theater marquees. The picture, directed by the redoubtable Carl Reiner, is almost militantly unfunny; the laughs are so intermittent they could scarcely pad out a 30-minute television episode let alone a full-length movie. When something in the picture is amusing, it tends to elicit a smile rather than an actual laugh, as when Martin sings a dopey song in the bathtub or when he leaves Bernadette Peters near the end, a sequence largely ad-libbed by him. The only genuinely hilarious bits in The Jerk are M. Emmet Walsh’s turn as an incompetent sniper and the verbal payoff to Martin kicking Gottlieb in the testicles. (The screenwriter says even he didn’t know about the punch-line until he saw the rough-cut.) But it’s a measure of the movie’s failure that Bill Macy, Dick O’Neill, Maurice Evans, Jackie Mason and Reiner himself don’t have a funny line or bit between them.\n\nPeters is charming as Martin’s love interest but it’s hard to believe her as a woman nearly as stupid as he is. The nicest scene in the picture, when they sing “You Belong to Me” together on the beach as he strums a ukulele, is undercut when, at its climax, she’s made to produce and play a trumpet in imitation of a Louis Armstrong riff. That should give you an idea of how incompetent and annoying The Jerk really is: Its makers couldn’t even trust a moment as sweet as that impromptu duet without trying to wring a dumb joke out of it.\n\nThe Taking of Pelham 1-2-3 (1974) One of the most entertaining thrillers of its era; like Rio Bravo, it’s a movie I have over the decades seen repeatedly, and with undiminished pleasure. The picture follows the narrative of John Godey’s 1973 bestseller but Peter Stone’s sharp, often funny screenplay changes and improves on it. It’s also one of the best-cast movies of the 1970s, from Walter Matthau’s Transit Authority lieutenant faced with a highjacked subway train held for ransom and Robert Shaw as the chillingly methodical leader of the group of crooks to Doris Roberts as the Mayor’s deadpan wife and Tom Pedi as the hot-headed Transit manager Caz Dolowicz, a name that lives on in glory among us Pelham aficionados. It’s a quintessential New-York-in-the-’70s movie, and nearly everybody in it is pissed off at the world; the bad humor of its many characters adds to the picture’s flavor, and its wit. Its director, Joseph Sargent, handles the pace, the suspense and the look of the movie admirably, the editing by Gerald B. Greenberg and Robert Q. Lovett couldn’t be more apt, and Owen Roizman’s rich cinematography looks especially good in the recent 4K UHD transfer. David Shire’s brief, 12-tone-inspired score is terse and infectious — it’s one of the things about the picture you remember most, along with Matthau’s hangdog look and Martin Balsam’s head-cold.\n\nAmong the terrific actors in the supporting cast are Earl Hindman as a relatively mild-mannered highjacker; Héctor Elizondo as his polar opposite, a frighteningly mercurial, psychopathic killer; James Broderick as the train motorman; Dick O’Neill as a sour, belligerent Transit Authority controller; Lee Wallace, everyone favorite Ed Koch stand-in, as the Mayor (although Wallace’s presence predates Koch’s in Gracie Mansion by four years); Tony Roberts as the disgusted deputy mayor; Jerry Stiller as Matthau’s coeval; Kenneth McMillan as a Borough commander; and Julius Harris as the Deputy chief inspector, recipient of a priceless greeting by Matthau. The train’s passengers are well-delineated and believable except for Anna Berger as the mother of two obnoxious boys; she so overdoes every emotion you begin to long for the gunmen to summarily dispose of her. Berger is one of the very few aspects of the picture that let it down.\n\nPlanet of the Apes (1968) There are some fantasy notions so good they seem blazingly original and at the same time so creatively logical you almost can’t believe no one thought of them before their authors set them down. Pierre Boulle’s Monkey Planet was one of them, a tongue-in-cheek science-fiction novel that turned on the ultimate cosmic joke: A sphere in which apes evolved from human beings, who are in turn ruled by their evolutionary superiors. (The book is more satirical than the eventual movie: Its narrative is in the form of a missive left in space, an interstellar message-in-a-bottle picked up by a skeptical married couple who, at the end, are revealed as chimpanzees.) The movie, imaginatively directed by Franklin J. Schaffner from an intelligent screenplay credited to Michael Wilson and Rod Serling, was an enormous success for its producer Arthur P. Jacobs in 1968, eventually siring four sequels of varying quality, and several remakes in the modern era. All that from a little French speculative novel published 60 years ago.\n\nCharlton Heston has one of his best roles as the cynical American astronaut Taylor, delighted to be leaving Earth and his fellow humans, whom he despises. The bitter joke at the core of the movie is that he more than gets his wish. He’s well-matched by his co-stars, especially Kim Hunter as the curious, compassionate scientist Zira, Roddy McDowall as her cautious fiancé Cornelius and James Whitmore as the President of the Assembly who makes Taylor defend himself in a rather too pointed spoof of the Scopes trial. (That “See-No-Evil, Hear-No-Evil, Speak-No-Evil” imagery should have been reconsidered by everyone concerned because it makes the movie momentarily something it otherwise never is: Silly.) Leon Shamroy’s fine-grained images are splendid, and the simian prosthetics created by John Chambers are still remarkable 55 years on. Jerry Goldsmith’s score is one of his most original and inventive, particularly in the big action set-pieces, such as Taylor’s capture and his later (momentary) escape.\n\nSide-note: I can no longer contemplate Maurice Evans’s orangutan authoritarian Dr. Zaius without also thinking of the chorus in the hilarious Andrew Lloyd Webber parody Planet of the Apes musical featured in an early episode of “The Simpsons.” Even his name seems funny to me now.\n\nBeneath the Planet of the Apes (1970) Arthur P. Jacobs’ first sequel to Planet of the Apes suffers from a sense of being rushed — not in its production but in the more perfunctory aspects of its story: The astronaut played by James Franciscus barely meets Cornelius and Zira before they give each other a few scraps of exposition and abruptly part. The chimpanzees are hardly in the movie; neither, at his own request, is Charlton Heston, although Maurice Evans returns as Dr. Zaius, as do Kim Hunter as Zira and Linda Harrison as Nova, her role even more thankless than in the original. Due to the poet-screenwriter Paul Dehn’s particularly weird sense of drama, Franciscus and Heston are confronted with intelligent human mutants who communicate, threaten and destroy telepathically, worship an unexploded cobalt bomb and wear humanoid masks over their ruined faces. (Dehn wrote the story with Mort Abrahams.) If the picture has any distinction, it’s in this aspect, and the art direction (by William Creber and Jack Martin Smith) and set decoration (by Walter M. Scott and Sven Wickman) of the underground remnants of New York. Ted Post’s direction is functional, but the visual effects are almost stunningly bad. The mutants are a clutch of splendid character actors including Victor Buono, Jeff Corey, Thomas Gomez, Don Pedro Colley, Natalie Trundy and Gregory Sierra, and James Gregory memorably portrays a militant gorilla general. The best thing about Leonard Rosenman’s futuristic score is the witty inversion he composed for the mutant bomb-worshippers of “All Things Bright and Beautiful.”\n\nText copyright 2023 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nRecently, watching the luscious Blu-ray edition of the 1950 Walt Disney Cinderella, it struck me that it might be time to re-view the two best live-action versions I know of this ancient tale whose roots stretch back at least to the earliest Christian era and which has informed so much popular culture throughout the world, particularly in the west. While the 1950 Walt Disney animated version still seems to me the finest of all (the phrase “fairest of them all” belongs to another fairy tale given memorable4 life by Disney) there is so much to cherish in the other two they can hardly be considered also-rans.\n\nFirst, the 1957 Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II live television production starring the newly-minted Broadway star Julie Andrews, then firmly ensconced as Eliza Dolittle in the defining work of the era’s other preeminent team — at least until the advent, with Fiorello!, of Bock and Harnick — Lerner and Loewe’s My Fair Lady. “Cinderella” is very much a Broadway production, peopled by New York actors, designers and musical personnel, with some of the performers, in order to participate, taking time off the hit shows in which they were starred, Andrews from Fair Lady and the Fairy Godmother, Edie Adams, from Li’l Abner. Although it was broadcast in color, as with so many live television shows for which a kinescope survives, the video we are left with is in black-and-white. (It’s actually not the live broadcast but a kinescope of the dress rehearsal.) Still, while it would be lovely to see those sets and costumes in color, the show (or rather, the score) is the thing here, and it’s a charmer. Hammerstein gave it one funny number, the “Stepsisters’ Lament” performed with comic brio by the dour Alice Ghostly (as the sister hilariously named “Joy”) and a comedically braying Kaye Ballard, and in the somewhat repetitious “Impossible”/”It’s Possible,” Adams gets one of those sunny little releases that were almost a trademark of Hammerstein’s and which like the lyrics in “Getting to Know You” by the weird alchemy of his craft almost seem to have been a part of the popular language forever:\n\nBut the world is full of zanies and fools\n\nWho don’t believe in sensible rules\n\nAnd won’t believe what sensible people say,\n\nAnd because these daft and dewy-eyed dopes\n\nKeep building up impossible hopes,\n\nImpossible things are happ’ning every day!\n\nCopyright © 2013, 1957 by Oscar Hammerstein II\n\nCopyright Renewed, Williamson Music Company (ASCAP), c/o Concord Music Publishing\n\nSimilarly, the love-duet for Cinderella and the Prince, “Do I Love You Because You’re Beautiful?” is among those achingly perfect songs with which the R&H catalogue brims and which came with such astonishing regularity throughout their work, both together and apart. (Hammerstein’s dialogue for the pair is also remarkably intelligent.) My only complaint about the score is that there is among these lovely numbers a slight lack of variety, so that as one charm-song follows another you may long for something satirical like “How Can Love Survive?” or “No Way to Stop it,” the two best songs in the original The Sound of Music, neither of which made it to the movie. (The former is heard at the Von Trapp party, but as an instrumental.) But then, Rodgers’ music, for all its variety of styles, is seldom raucous or messily alive the way other composers’ routinely are. There’s something a little staid about his scores with Hammerstein, and even the greatest of them, like Carousel and The King and I, can feel a bit constricted musically. Only South Pacific is contemporary and feels like it.\n\nThe show is beautifully cast, with Andrews a practical and sweet-natured Cinderella, Howard Lindsay an amusing old fusspot of a king and the adorable Dorothy Stickney an enchanting queen, giving those who never saw them in it an idea of what they might have been like in Life with Father. Ilka Chase makes a flinty but not especially cruel Stepmother and Jon Cypher, remembered by viewers of my generation as the Chief of Police on “Hill Street Blues” with whom Daniel J. Travanti’s Frank Furillo so often sparred, almost makes the Prince less thankless a role than usual and is in splendid voice throughout. (He also has the show’s only noticeable flub when in the reprise of “Do I Love You Because You’re Beautiful?” he steps on Stickney’s lyric, about which he was miserable and she entirely unruffled.)\n\nI was not surprised to hear one of the cast members on the Shout! DVD (I think it was Andrews, although it might have been Ballard) say that the set was cramped, and you can see that it must have been, made up as it is of so many smaller playing areas, but the designs by Jean Eckart and William Eckart are beautiful, as are her costumes. Ralph Nelson directed the show with unhurried efficiency given the monumental task and Rodgers’ music was orchestrated by Robert Russell Bennett with his usual subtle brilliance. Bennett, who often composed more than was suspected of the scores he arranged for Rodgers, Cole Porter and others, was one of the six or seven finest orchestrators in Broadway history — Jonathan Tunick to Rodgers’ Stephen Sondheim. Half the reason a Rodgers waltz or ballad sounds like one is due to him.\n\nOf historical note: Presumably on the strength of the names Rodgers and Hammerstein, the “Cinderella” broadcast had the highest rating of any television program up to that time; Jon Cypher said that after the broadcast the New York streets were weirdly deserted, and it’s been estimated that of 167 million Americans in 1957, over 107 million tuned in. Not even the “M*A*S*H” finale, the reigning champion in the series episode field, drew that large a viewership. Let’s see Lin-Manuel Miranda top that.\n\nMusic is also the great strength, and weakness, of Richard B. Sherman and Robert M. Sherman’s The Slipper and the Rose: The Story of Cinderella (1976). Strength because the score is one of the Shermans’ finest for movies, on a par with the work they did on Mary Poppins and Bedknobs and Broomsticks. The only problem with the songs, which are on the whole either beautiful, delightful or both, is that as production numbers they tend to go on far too long. The picture, which weighs in at a hefty 143 minutes, could stand to lose a few, and the dances are what should have gone. Not all the dancing, of course, but the extraneous ensemble dancing, which seldom has anything to do with the scene or the song and at their nadir (in the otherwise apt “Position and Positioning”) resemble that terrible “Consider Yourself” number of Onna White’s in the movie of Oliver!, with the performers dancing their little hearts out for absolutely no reason. In their duet “What a Comforting Thing to Know,” the Prince (Richard Chamberlain) and his bodyguard (Christopher Gable) do acrobatics in a crypt, where metal pipes have been fitted above the sepulchres, apparently solely for them to swing on. The only extended dance that has a purpose, and some wit, is when the King (Michael Hordern) and his cabinet of pompous old ministers perform the typically Shermanian “Protocoligorically Correct” and launch into a funny kick-line atop the long table. What surprises me about the superfluous dances is that they were the work of Marc Breaux, who with his wife Dee Dee Wood created the often inspired and in any case always appropriate choreography in Poppins, The Sound of Music and Bedknobs — their extended Portobello Road number, stupidly cut from the release in 1973 and restored to home video, is the sort of ensemble work movie musicals often aspire to but seldom achieve and even in lesser pictures like The Happiest Millionaire and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang the Breaux-Wood dances spring wholly from the content of the song. Here the numbers seem to exist because The Slipper and the Rose is a musical and in musicals you dance… right?\n\nI was predisposed to enjoy The Slipper and the Rose because both its score and its original screenplay were written by the Sherman brothers, but on seeing it for the first time a decade ago I was entirely un-prepared, in spite of my cavils about the dances, for how utterly charming it is. (It even ends with old-fashioned curtain calls for the cast.) The movie’s origins are made a bit muddy by the director and co-scenarist Bryan Forbes’ commentary on the Blu-ray in which he implies he wrote the first screenplay and the interview with Richard and Robert Sherman in which they talk about it being their idea, and their original script, long before Forbes was involved. I suspect the Sherman brothers wrote it and that Forbes then revised it, making it more “English” in outlook and dialogue. It was certainly the Shermans who decided to refract the familiar story largely through the Prince’s perspective, and it was a perfect stroke. In nearly every other version of Cinderella, the Prince is — and this is not a pun on the last name of Julie Andrews’ consort from 1957 — a cipher, barely defined, who literally waltzes in at the ball, is left holding a glass slipper afterward, and re-emerges only at the end, having married his instant dream-girl.\n\nOne of the things the Shermans seldom get credit for — and there is much they get no credit for — is their sureness of touch. They were always conscious of content, form and style; the essentials. They understood time, place, who was singing, what they were trying to say, and why. They understood as well the means by which a song became necessary. Finally, they understood, and were masters at, musicality. (I assume, despite the team’s billing, that it was Richard, the trained musician, who did most of the composing, but since their credit was always as co-composers as well as co-lyricists, I will leave it at that.) In Mary Poppins, for example, they caught, as did Lerner and Loewe before them in the Convent Garden and Alfred Doolittle numbers in My Fair Lady, the exact, quintessential English music hall/busker style, for Bert and for the “Jolly Holiday” sequence. That facility for effective pastiche, one which sets them apart as musical dramatists, in this picture is perhaps the most fully realized of all their work for movies. Much of the score is operetta-style filtered through a modern idiom, with rich, fulsome parodies of the Graustarkian tropes and nods to Gilbert and Sullivan. It’s simultaneously thoroughly European, utterly British, and distinctly Sherman.\n\nOf the three musicals considered in this essay, The Slipper and the Rose is in its score the most accomplished and sophisticated. (Even the Disney Cinderella, whose brief song score feels more varied than the Rodgers and Hammerstein, isn’t as fully realized as this.) Interestingly and in keeping with the Shermans’ means of telling the story, it is the Prince, not Cinderella, who gets the traditional musical theatre “want song” at the beginning, and the fantasy he imagines in it (“Why Can’t I Be Two People?”) is of course mirrored perfectly when Cinderella arrives at the ball disguised as a titled lady. Her establishing song, “Once I Was Loved,” on the other hand, sung after the death of her father, while melancholy is both resigned and gently defiant. The King’s stylish gavotte, “Protocoligorically Correct,” is hinged on the Shermans’ requisite coinage of a whimsical portmanteau neologism. The love song at the ball, “Secret Kingdom,” is one of the most memorable of all Sherman ballads, with a deceptively simple melody that can stick in your mind indefinitely, and in the most pleasing manner. This is followed by a splendid double soliloquy (“He Danced with Me/She Danced with Me”) that is both lilting and exhilarating. (At the Command Performance the Queen Mother told the songwriters she’d never heard a more beautiful waltz. But then, the Windsors are scarcely noted for their musical perspicacity. Maybe it was the movie’s evocation of royal prerogative that got to her.)\n\nThe masterpiece of this score occurs in its most dramatic moment when to save the crown embarrassment the Lord High Chamberlain urges Cinderella into exile and she, out of love, accepts. “Tell Him Anything” expresses her determination that her prince should, to save him from pining after her, believe anything negative about her except the truth: That she is true to him. The dark, swirling musical accompaniment and the deeply intelligent lyrics with their adroit inner rhymes combine to make a number that is moving and plangent without resort to bathos or emotionalism, and when Cinderella sings, “Tell him anything/But not that I love him” the music’s roiling, agitated state slowly resolves, sadly yet somehow rhapsodically. This is the furthest thing from the sort of cookie-cutter writing original movie musicals so often make do with, in which commonplace emotions are met with generic composition and lyric-writing and which we grudgingly accept because the performers are charming, or the dance they’re doing has some originality or wit. Whenever I hear “Tell Him Anything” I think of Sondheim because it sounds like the sort of thing he might have come up with but which almost none of the people who habitually dismiss them ever expect of the Shermans.\n\nRichard Chamberlain is both in gorgeous fettle and beautiful voice as the Prince, the wonderful Michael Hordern does one of his comic specialties as the dithering king (“Kings never cheat! They adapt to circumstances. But they never cheat!”), Lally Bowers makes a charmingly ditzy queen, Annette Crosbie is captivatingly loopy as the fairy godmother, Kenneth Moore is both pompous and unexpectedly moving as the lord chamberlain, Edith Evans very amusing as the dowager queen (making me wonder what she would have been like in A Little Night Music, had Sondheim and Hal Prince gotten her as they’d wanted), Margaret Lockwood a remorselessly wicked stepmother and Gemma Craven an adorable and vocally glorious Cinderella. Forbes directed in his usual uninspired and realistic fashion, which in a curious way grounds the magical components; there are no big effects, just lovely images with a slight aspect of magic. Each time some supernatural element is released it’s either done in an almost prosaic manner, making the magical quotidian (and vice-versa) or with subtle cuts that work their own legerdemain, as when Cinderella rushes from the palace, gradually losing her finery and returning to her normal state of dress.\n\nTony Imi’s sumptuous color cinematography is an asset, as are Angela Morley’s musical arrangements and, operating on a minimal budget, the production design of Raymond Simm, the art direction by Bert Davey and, especially, Julie Harris’ lush costumes, which reach their apogee in the ball sequence, designed and executed in subtle, mouth-watering pastels. One might cavil that in the sequence late in the picture where Cinderella sings the rueful “I Can’t Forget the Melody,” the imagery is a nearly exact duplicate of Jean-Honoré Fragonard’s “L’Escarpolette” and thus more than a bit studied, but what bothers me most about it is that the sumptuous costuming and decor seem entirely out of character for Cinderella, even if the royals are footing her bills. This is the price one pays when a director becomes determined to create a visual effect for its own sake (and for his own obsessive reasons) regardless of whether it makes any sense for the movie he’s making.\n\nIn spite of that notable lapse on Forbes’ part, however, I was flabbergasted to read in his Movies on TV this comment by Steven M. Scheuer: “An air of desperation hangs over everything.” What movie did he see? The thing is so sure-footed, so beautiful, so entrancing, and so casually magical that “desperation” is the last word I can imagine using to describe it.\n\nAs Crosbie’s Fairy Godmother assures Cinderella before her appearance at the ball: “No one will recognize you for what you are. People seldom do.”\n\nThe original Disney Cinderella was, I think, the first movie my sister and I were taken to a theater to see, on its 1965 reissue. I certainly remember seeing it, and being given the Gold Key comic book reprint that summer as part of my reading material (or perusing, at any rate; I was only 4-and-a-half) during the family’s annual auto trip to Florida to visit our maternal grandparents. My sibling received the “Magic Mirror” Disneyland LP for her birthday that year, but I suspect I listened to it more often than she did; I loved the sped-up voices of the mice singing the “Work Song” and their own version of “A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes,” as well as “So This is Love,” the brief, curiously and effectively low-key (and minor-keyed) duet for the Prince and Cinderella at the ball… although what I chiefly remembered from the movie itself were the King and the Grand Duke bouncing into the air on the monarch’s absurdly enormous mattress. What child of four couldn’t envy their being able to bounce on that bed, fly practically to the castle ceiling, and float safely back down? Never mind that the King is doing his best to decapitate the Duke; it was the bouncing that mattered.*\n\nCinderella was Disney’s savior in 1950, when after years of dismal featurettes and make-work government contracts the studio was facing a financial reckoning, and the possible dissolution of its animation unit, the bedrock on which Walt had built the company. Perhaps to keep the costs down, the picture isn’t as visually impressive as some of its predecessors (and successors) and the song score is one of the studio’s briefest. Although Disney’s animated features are not, strictly speaking, full musicals on the same scale as their Broadway and East End counterparts — until Babes in Toyland and Mary Poppins Disney pictures were more full-length stories with a few songs — they’re still musicals. Cinderella‘s song-stack is roughly on a par with that in Snow White or Pinocchio, or the similarly minimalist Dumbo. There are only four major melodies (“So This is Love,” “Sing, Sweet Nightingale,” “Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo” and “A Dream…”) plus a fractional fifth (the “Work Song”) which segues into the murine edition of “A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes,” a number I can never contemplate without remembering the “Fresh Air” Classical music critic Lloyd Schwartz relating that a friend of his had once called it the most frightening title he’d ever heard.† Its lyrical relation to “When You Wish Upon a Star” doesn’t bear too close a comparison either, although I do like the couplet “Have faith in your dreams and someday/Your rainbow will come smiling through,” which whatever you think of its oversold optimism is a nice piece of minor poetry. I’m not sure, speaking of this score, what astonishes me most: That all of its songs were by the same three-man team (Mack David, Jerry Livingston, and Al Hoffman), that the only other number they ever placed for a Disney picture was “The Un-Birthday Song” in Alice in Wonderland, or that Hoffman and Livingston also wrote “Mairzy Doats.”\n\nIn adapting Charles Perrault’s version of the Giambattista Basile story, it was a smart idea of the Disney writers (who included Bill Peet, Ted Sears, Ken Anderson, Winston Hibler and Joe Rinaldi) to focus much of the humor, and the suspense, of the picture on Cinderella’s mice. In classical versions of the story it’s birds who come to the slave-girl’s aid but small birds don’t have the capacity for stealth that mice do, or a place inside a mansion’s walls, and pitting the mice against the Stepmother’s evil, pampered cat (not incidentally named Lucifer) is an inspired stroke. Of the three versions of Cinderella written about here, only the Disney edition has a firm and elaborate visual grasp on fantasy, and the means (animation) by which to best express it. Additionally, and unlike almost all recent Mouse House product, schizophrenically made with one eye on each new heroine’s spunky feminist/”Woke” bona fides and the other on crafting an ageless new “Princess” to add to the marketing lineage, there was no art-by-committee finagling in 1949; generations of girls and boys loved this Cinderella for her natural ebullience, her love of animals, and her complete lack of self-pity. (Would they have loved her quite so much if she’d also been carrying banners?) It’s that last item that makes the treatment of her before the ball by her step-family so horrific, and her reaction to it so harrowing: Having her dress, lovingly augmented by her mice and bird friends, torn to ribbons also shreds her ability to believe; when she runs out to the garden weeping, her faith in dreams shattered, she thinks, beyond repair, it’s heart-rending. Yet the slow gathering around her of the mice, the bloodhound Bruno and the draft-horse Major, drawn by her uncharacteristic outpouring of pain and need, suggest the deep love she conveys to them, and that they feel for her, and it is this as much as the unexpected appearance of Cinderella’s kindly Fairy Godmother that makes it such a heartfelt and memorable sequence. Here too the music does wonders to convey the dramatic intensity of the scene, the chorus singing back her own words (“Have faith in your dreams, and someday…”) which Cinderella now fights against, thinking herself a fool for that belief.\n\nCinderella’s despair represents the moment when even she, for all her sunniness and optimism, reaches the end of her ability to take the abuse her stepsisters dole out to her. Yet as vicious as the girls are (and as physically repulsive — their animator, Ollie Johnson, really lays on their ugliness) they take their cues from the truly horrid Lady Tremaine, the Frank Thomas-animated stepmother both modeled on the physiognomy of the actress Eleanor Audley and memorably voiced by her. Audley later inspired the design of, and provided the voice for, Maleficent in the 1959 Sleeping Beauty, but even that evil fairy and erstwhile fire-breathing dragon is not as nasty, or as frightening to a child, as Lady Tremaine, and Thomas’ rendering of her is a tour de force of symbolized character animation, as when she is shown obliquely through the shadows of her huge canopy bed, giving increasingly onerous cleaning instructions to her stepdaughter with a brutality that is almost shocking in its undisguised psychosis. She’s like a large animal of prey, revealing her teeth in a hideous smile. Although Margaret Lockwood in The Slipper and the Rose is also vicious, of all the Wicked Stepmothers in this survey Lady Tremaine is the one who seems most likely to one day draw real blood. If she hasn’t already.\n\nCinderella, as was often the case with Disney’s feature animation, benefited from live-action reference — which is not the same thing as rotoscoping — and Helene Stanley was the perfect model for the girl, graceful without becoming a caricature of grace, while Ilene Woods’ unemphatic vocal performance, which includes both her speaking and her singing, makes her among the most winning of all Disney heroines. Thanks to the then-new technique of over-dubbing pioneered by Les Paul, Disney was able to produce the gorgeous sequence in which a growing series of bubble reflections of Cinderella replicate her vocalizations as she rescues the voice-and-flute exercise “Sing, Sweet Nightingale” from the clutches of her tone-deaf stepsisters while scrubbing the Tremaine mansion’s vast hall floor. The sound of her voice going from solo to duet to trio to quartet is not merely a clever touch, or a pleasing musical number but a perfect representation of character. Faced with pointless labor imposed on her by a practiced sadist, the girl’s outlook somehow remains cheerful. Neither is she a happy idiot grinning at adversity; her character — gentle, optimistic, dreamy yet not insipid — is as fixed in Cinderella as Lady Tremaine’s genteel savagery is in her.\n\nAll of Disney’s “Nine Old Men” (Johnston, Thomas, Marc Davis, Eric Larson, Les Clark, Milt Kahl, Ward Kimball, John Lounsbery and Wolfgang Reitherman) worked on the picture, which I feel certain, accounted at least in part for its specialness. Davis’ design of Cinderella, and his work animating her, informs our impressions; his brief sequence of transformation, in which her rags become a resplendent ball gown, is among the most magical such moments in American animation. Fortunately, the people of 1950, both those who worked on this movie and the audience for it, didn’t demand that a fairy tale character, whose fullest flowering was in Europe, earn her studio ESG points or a high social-credit score. They understood implicitly that the leading character in a story derived from a French fable would be Caucasian, and that her being white was not a deliberate snub to any other group. (Christ, but I get tired of this game, and of wondering whether new readers of these pages do or do not automatically presume I’m some sort of bigot for my enjoyment of yet another old movie with no inherent prejudices except that of trying to entertain the largest possible audience of its time. Why do I get the feeling that merely liking these versions of Cinderella automatically puts me — if you’ll forgive the pun — beyond the pale?)\n\nKahl was responsible for the direction of the childishly mercurial King, his milquetoast Grand Duke and, most memorably, for the design and animation of the soft, kind, lovely old Fairy Godmother, modeled on Mary Alice O’Connor and beautifully voiced by Verna Felton, while Kimball, Reitherman and Lounsbery supervised the animation of the mouse heroes Jaq and Gus. Reitherman, whose special forte was action, animated the almost excruciatingly tense sequence of Jaq and Gus retrieving the key to Cinderella’s room and dragging it up the attic stairs. (The special-effects man Jimmy MacDonald, Walt’s replacement as the voice of Mickey Mouse, had his recordings sped up for both Jaq and Gus.) Larson and Clark are credited as the pictures’ supervising animators and the overall directors were Wilfred Jackson, Hamilton Luske and Clyde Geronimi. Kimball also worked on Lucifer and provided the great moment when, realizing he’s trapped Gus under a teacup, the cat sticks out his tongue and waves his paws around in a crazy parody of feline ecstasy.\n\nSpeaking of Lucifer: There’s a disturbing moment near then end when, chased to the upper window outside Cinderella’s tower bedroom by Bruno, he falls, presumably to his death. I wonder why I didn’t remember that from childhood? Perhaps I blocked it.\n\nAs always with Disney, it’s the small things that resonate with you, and which add to your pleasure. When, after her midnight escape from the ball Cinderella explains to her animal friends how it felt to dance with the Prince, Gus leans in against Jaq in second-hand romantic bliss and Jaq, without thinking, places his arm around the rotund mouse and holds him close before coming to his senses and glaring at his friend in annoyance. Naturally, literalists now see in this charming, harmless moment of amusement a declaration of sexuality; according to the understandably pseudonymous “A.X.S,” writing speciously in The Economist, these characters are “not so much gay as queer,” while The Disney Company itself in its needless live-action 2015 “remake” of Cinderella, turned Jaq into “Jacqueline” because God forbid female fantasy mice behave in a traditional manner in a goddamned fairy tale. The sex-change (if you’ll pardon the expression) also got around that pesky little homoerotic joke of 1950, thus perfectly illustrating how Disney, currently embroiled in a pointless controversy with the governor of Florida over, among other things, an educational bill deliberately misinterpreted and cynically mis-named by the reactive “Woke,” likes to play things both ways.\n\nText copyright 2023 by Scott Ross\n\n*Most Disney Princes are colorless, but the one in Cinderella is barely even there. If it wasn’t for “So This is Love” (in which his singing was provided by Mike Douglas) he’d have no dimensions at all.\n\n†A sixth number, “Cinderella,” is heard beneath the main titles, but apart from its being sung by Marni Nixon (as herself for once) it’s a bore.\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nThe Disney Pinocchio (1940) — which to my astonishment I just realized will be 80 years old this year — is my favorite, not merely of the Disney features but of all animated movies. It is the fulfillment of Snow White‘s promise, but without Fantasia‘s pretension or Bambi‘s anthropomorphic cutseying-up of what is, basically, the grim realism of its source. (Felix Salten’s novel is red in tooth and claw, not to mention hoof.)* Pinocchio‘s contours, its scope, its design and effects, were and are what they were intended to be, an overwhelming visual and emotional experience. Its darknesss, which some see as cold, appeals to me, and seems entirely appropriate: The corrupt world is arrayed against Pinocchio, and his journey is proving his mettle in the face of temptation, and even death. He stands up to the obstacles and comes out the other side, fulfilling the basic requirements of a fairy tale. Pinocchio is a work of high art, both entrancing and profoundly disturbing. Dumbo, by contrast, is a cartoon, caricatured and brightly colored, like a child’s dream of the circus before he attends one and his illusions are forever shattered by the seedy underbelly of sawdust reality.\n\nDumbo does not aspire to the messy, unpredictable mantle of great art and, perhaps as a result, achieves instead a kind of minor-scale perfection. This absolute charmer about the elephant child whose freakishly large ears prove an irresistible asset was made largely (and tellingly) while Uncle Walt was off Good-Neighboring in South America; consequently it’s tighter (it runs only slightly over an hour) and less kitsch-prone and bathetic than some of the Disney features that would follow, yet it is arguably the most emotionally-charged of any Disney release. Its directness and simplicity are a tonic, its humor is gentle, and its impulse to the deliberately artistic limited to an ingratiating Surrealist dream sequence in which vaguely threatening pink elephants mix and mutate in an increasing frenzy until they explode, resolving gracefully into the beautiful, benign little pink clouds of a Florida morning.\n\nThe story began with a little-seen book for children called Dumbo, the Flying Elephant by Helen Aberson and Harold Pearl, published by Roll-a-book Publishers, Inc. whose black-and-white drawings obviously served as models for the Disney animators. (See Michael Barrier’s informative essay The Mysterious Dumbo Roll-a-Book.) Wisely, and cleverly, the story men (who included Disney veterans Bill Peet and Joe Rinaldi) replaced the robin who inspires Dumbo with the circus-savvy Timothy Mouse, voiced with urban bravado by Edward Brophy, although most of the incidents of the original remained. Dumbo‘s is a streamlined story, uncluttered and sincere, and is helped enormously by the fact that its protagonist, essentially an infant, is mute. The picture is not, but its first quarter is chary of dialogue, apart from the smiling officiousness of a talkative stork (voiced by the lanky Sterling Holloway and drawn by Art Babbitt to resemble him) and the insensitive remarks of a harem of alternately pompous and gossiping elephant cows led by Verna Felton’s Matriarch. Before Dumbo’s arrival, and very often thereafter, the picture is primarily visual — and musical, what with its affecting underscore by Oliver Wallace and atmospheric songs by him, Frank Churchill and the lyricist Ned Washington.\n\nDumbo’s mother, Mrs. Jumbo, has exactly one line in the movie, and even more than the elephants, the blustery German Ringmaster (Herman Bing) and the now infamous crows of the final quarter, the most voluble character is Timothy, the elephant child’s adviser and protector. Like Jiminy Cricket in Pinocchio, Timothy is the movie’s conscience, and a typical sort of Hollywood character of the time: The street-wise, somewhat blustery, wisecracking, slang-spouting urbanite. One of the busiest character actors of the 1930s and ’40s, Edward Brophy was usually either a cop of a gangster, and (as with Cliff “Ukulele Ike” Edwards, who gave vocal life to Jiminy) a contemporary audience would have instantly recognized the sound of his voice. It’s almost impossible not to love Timothy, because for all his toughness, he alone stands up for little Dumbo after Mrs. Jumbo, enraged by the cruelty of some vicious human brats, is penned up as “mad.” More, he makes smoothing the way for Dumbo his entire focus; he’s the loyal big brother we who got picked on as children wished we’d had, and the unspoken irony, almost a subtle joke, is that the relative sizes of protector and protected are reversed.\n\nDumbo‘s look is unique in the Disney canon, especially of those features following Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. It lacks that shaded, deep, expensive appearance that was the hallmark of Disney feature animation, and it’s far more stylized than its predecessors: Many of the figures in the crowd scenes are literally faceless, an effect that is especially notable in the sequence near the beginning where the Roustabouts and their elephant helpers raise the Big Top. Most of the characters are more overtly “cartoony” than those in the features that preceded it; the circus animals don’t look like real tigers, kangaroos, gorillas, hyenas or hippos (although the elephants are rather accurate) and the people are caricatures. Their designs are simpler than in Snow White, Fantasia or Pinocchio yet we don’t feel in any way cheated, especially with Dumbo and his mother. Affectionate love between parent and child has seldom been as exquisitely represented as it is with these two; there’s a brief sequence in which Dumbo engages in hide-and-seek with Mrs. Jumbo, running between her huge legs and smiling ecstatically, his little trunk raised and his eyes closed in sheer pleasure when she tags him, that is not only the last word in charm but perfectly encapsulates the way parents (especially mothers) and small children (including baby animals) play together. Along with the great animator Vladimir “Bill” Tytla’s beautiful realization of little Dumbo and Wallace’s charming, oboe-based theme for him, this sweet, unselfconscious play cements the emotional bond between Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo.\n\nThat connection is so naturally strong that, when she is chained up in her cell, Dumbo’s mother sways back and forth in numb, hopeless despair we see her son, in the elephant tent, moving back and forth almost identically. This may be a bit studied, but the ultimate proof of the filmmakers’ mastery over the problem of imbuing drawings with life and giving them power over the viewer’s senses is the astonishingly fulsome emotional response evoked by Dumbo’s late-night visit to Mrs. Jumbo. You may not, as I do when I see this sequence, shed tears like a child, but I think you’d have to be made of something close to stone not to at least be moved by it. Its direct appeal to the emotions, and its simplicity of action, and of feeling, skirts bathos and becomes something approaching the profound, and which would have been spoiled by dialogue, or uncontrolled keening. Disney isn’t often accused of restraint, but the subtlety of this scene, which every adult who saw it as a child can instantly recall, speaks to his, and his staff’s, seemingly innate understanding of psychology.\n\nAlthough the sequence is accompanied by a song (“Baby Mine,” with music by Churchill) there is no sense that Mrs. Jumbo is singing it; it’s a reflection of her inner being, and Washington’s lyrics are comprised of words and phrases with which any loving mother — or child — can identify. For a movie as music-heavy as Dumbo, few of its many songs are sung by a character in it. Only the “Song of the Roustabouts” and “When I See an Elephant Fly” (and a brief number by the circus clowns as they go off to ask the Ringmaster for a raise) can be considered musical numbers in the traditional sense. Everything else, from “Look Out for Mr. Stork” and “Casey, Jr.” in the opening minutes to the comically nightmarish “Pink Elephants on Parade” is performed off-screen by The Sportsman Quartet, the singer Betty Noyes (she performed “Baby Mine” here and, later, dubbed Debbie Reynolds dubbing Jean Hagen in Singin’ in the Rain) or, in the case of the Roustabouts’ song, the King’s Men. The only song sung by the characters on screen is, not coincidentally, the best number in what I consider one of the finest song scores ever written for any movie, of any kind.\n\nThis brings us nicely to Dumbo’s great controversy. It can, I suppose, be argued that the quintet of black crows who show up in the movie’s “third act” is a racist daydream, but it should be remembered that, aside from the lead bird, who was voiced by Cliff Edwards, the voices of the others in the quintet were members of the Hall Johnson Choir, including the actors James Baskett (later Uncle Remus in Song of the South, for which he was given a special Academy Award™) and Nick Stewart (later the voice of Bre’r Rabbit) and Johnson himself, who voices the Deacon; that their joshing jive-talk was taken directly from the “backchat” on records by Cab Calloway and Louis Armstrong (and, one assumes, the voluble Fats Waller; one of the crows is called “Fats”); and that the live models for their steps, animated with marvelously loose-limbed joi de vivre by Ward Kimball, were the black dance duo the Jackson Brothers. I realize I am courting opprobrium by saying so but it should also be remembered that then, as now, sensitivity to slang and idiom are a preoccupation of middle-class black intellectuals who apparently have never talked with a person who didn’t go to college, or listened to a jazz or rap recording. I am the furthest thing from a disbeliever in the necessity of intellectual uplift, but an overarching belief in the importance of education and pretending that many (perhaps most?) people in America, black or otherwise, speak or write grammatically, are necessarily mutually exclusive. While I understand that representations of black reality are matters usually best left to black creators, if we accept that a cracker can only be written by a white writer, a Jew by a Jewish writer, a gay man by a gay writer, a woman by a woman — if we buy into the sort of literary and popular segregation that is unhealthy both for art and for the culture at large — we not only junk almost everything that’s come before, but place unreasonable and, I think, frankly racialist as well as reactionary restrictions on the creative impulse.†\n\nWhile some black critics, writers and cultural commentators of the time were offended by the birds, and while the Disney artists might have been more sensitive to the prevailing popular culture stereotypes of the previous eras, particularly in movies, the crows in Dumbo are not only the liveliest characters in the picture, they’re among the most appealing supporting characters the studio ever created. They bring an exuberance, and a relaxed, happy infusion of jive, into the picture, and they got a great song — the best in the score — in “When I See an Elephant Fly.” The punning word-play of Washington’s charming lyrics, coupled with the swing of Wallace’s infectious melody, lift the sequence into the realm of the sublime. Some have called the crows bullies, but surely this is an over-simplification. They’re not picking on Dumbo, although Timothy understandably thinks they are. They’ve just seen an elephant in a tree; it seems to me that to react with humor is the sanest thing they could do under the circumstance. Moreover, it is their smart psychological move in providing the “Magic Feather” that gives Dumbo the confidence he needs to do deliberately what in his champagne-stupor he did without thinking.\n\nThe supervising director on Dumbo was Ben Sharpsteen, who with Hamilton Luske also supervised Pinocchio, and the sequence directors were figures such as Norman Ferguson, Wilfred Jackson, and Jack Kinney. I don’t know with certainty what Kinney contributed, but he became the director of the great Goofy shorts when the analytic Babbitt, who created and developed the character, was fired during the Disney animator’s strike that began just after Dumbo was completed, so we can assume he worked on some of the more overtly comic moments. Many of Disney’s veterans were busy with Bambi during the production of Dumbo, giving some younger, less seasoned artists the chance to show what they could do. Among the animators who worked on it, aside from Kimball, were fellow future “Nine Old Men” Les Clark, John Lounsbery, Wolfgang (“Woolie”) Reitherman, Eric Larson and (although uncredited) Frank Thomas, and the junior animators included Walt Kelly (also a casualty of the strike), “Mickey” master Fred Moore, Preston Blair, Basil Davidovich, Michael Lah, the future Peanuts guru Bill Melendez, Paul Murry (later, with Floyd Gottfredson, one of two great Mickey Mouse and Goofy comic book artists) and (also uncredited) John Sibley and Irv Spector. Maurice Noble, Chuck Jones’ brilliant designer and sometimes co-director, worked on character design and Al Dempster on the backgrounds. That’s pretty much an all-star aggregation; Marc Davis, Ollie Johnson and Milt Kahl are just about the only Disney masters who didn’t put in time on Dumbo.\n\nWhile the entire picture is wonderfully designed and animated, I think we may assume the infusion of young talent into it is likely responsible for its most unusual elements. There are marvelous little curlicues that pop up throughout Dumbo, comic and atmospheric touches which, despite the simpler designs, make an impact. During the circus parade, for example, the “ferocious” tigers (who are almost certainly the work of Jack Kinney) lie in a sleepy pile and a gorilla who, after howling in savage fury and shaking the bars of his caravan car realizes he’s pulled out one of them and quickly slips it back in place; he’s a performer, and he’s sheepishly embarrassed by having gone over the top. The circus locomotive, Casey Jones, Jr., is anthropomorphized, with a human face and a sentient whistle; when the car behind the engine bangs into it, the whistle hoots as if Casey has just been goosed. When the Ringmaster strips for bed he’s seen through the film of his tent, in silhouette, a gag which is repeated to even better comic effect later, when we see the clowns disrobing, their performance shapes at variance with their actual bodies. The animators also enjoy a touch of the macabre; when Timothy sneaks into the Ringmaster’s tent to plant an idea in his mind favorable to Dumbo, his shadow is seen on the tent wall, grotesquely enlarged and looking like that of Max Schreck in Nosferatu. When he takes on the persona of the Ringmaster’s Subconscious, he wraps himself in the bed-sheet like a spectre, even though he can’t be seen by the man into whose ear he’s dropping suggestions. (Timothy is a bit of a Method actor.)\n\nMusic Men: Frank Churchill (top left); Ned Washington (right); Walt Disney with Oliver Wallace (bottom).\n\nI don’t think Oliver Wallace’s music can be over-praised. His theme for Dumbo is both softly plaintive and expressively playful, and I suspect it was that, and his music for the songs “Pink Elephants on Parade” and “When I See an Elephant Fly” that won him and Frank Churchill the 1942 Scoring Oscar™.‡ Churchill’s songs with the lyricist Larry Morey for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs were a large part of that movie’s appeal (he also composed “Who’s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?”) but his work in Dumbo is a bit conventional compared to Wallace’s. Yet while almost any music could have played under Dumbo’s visit to his mother and the scene would still have packed an emotional wallop, “Baby Mine” is a nearly perfect lullaby, so I don’t mean to pillory him. Washington, who later became a fixture in the production of “movie theme songs” following the phenomenal success of High Noon in 1952, had a remarkable range as a lyricist, not merely from film to film or score to score but song to song. “Pink Elephants on Parade” is almost Gilbertian in its fantastic rhyme-schemes, and “When I See an Elephant Fly” contains a set of lyrics so drunk on word-play I don’t imagine Yip Harburg would have been ashamed to have written it.\n\nThe Pink Elephants sequence illustrates better than anything else in the picture the merging of great songwriting, imaginative design and brilliant realization. And it’s beautifully situated in the narrative. I wonder if children of today, raised less on the cartoon tropes of the 1930s and ’40s (and even the ’20s) than we of the late baby-boom television generation, quite understand the concept of seeing hallucinatory pink elephants after a drunken tear (they’re actually an indicator of delirium tremens.) That’s the context here: Dumbo and Timothy, having drunk deeply from champagne-polluted water, enter a kind of inebriated fugue state wherein their shared vision is completely subsumed by fuchsia pachyderms. Beyond the wild squash-and-stretch permutations the animators achieve, the sequence is funny as an idea: A drunken elephant calf hallucinating the human conception of pink elephants. It’s also a strangely beautiful sequence, particularly toward the end when the images are rendered as pink and blue pastel outlines on a black velvet background, and the whole thing is a staggeringly successful exercise in Surrealism. (It was so good the Disney animators unfortunately imitated it 27 years later, to diminished effect, in the derivative “Heffalumps and Woozels” sequence for the 1968 featurette Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day. Even the gifted Sherman Brothers couldn’t work up much of a song for that one.)\n\nI called Dumbo a tonic earlier, and it had a positive effect on its makers as well as its audience. Stretched increasingly thin financially due to Walt’s many money-losing war contracts and reeling from the financial failures of both Fantasia and Pinocchio, the Disney studio desperately needed a hit. Aside from Bambi (which also lost money) Dumbo would be the last bright animated light at Disney in many a long year, until another unpretentious feature called Cinderella returned the company to artistic and fiscal solvency. Naturally, the current Disney “creative” team, which has never had an original idea in its collective life, authorized a live-action, plot-heavy, Tim Burton-directed “remake” in 2019, which ran nearly an hour longer than the original, was focused (sacrilege!) on human beings, cut the songs(!) and which, alas (but also predictably) made, proportionally, a lot more money than Dumbo did in 1941.\n\nBut I don’t have to believe any of that if I don’t want to.\n\n*The movie admittedly does soften the Collodi novel, and Pinocchio’s character, not least in the cricket the book’s wooden boy smashes against a wall when he chides him mutating into Pinocchio’s Official Conscience, Jiminy Cricket.\n\n†This sort of reflexive sniping not only stifles good work, it obliterates it: It’s what ultimately has kept Disney’s 1946 Song of the South out of circulation, not only in theatres but on home video, largely I think due to a lack of understanding that the picture’s setting is post-war, not antebellum. Floyd Norman, the Disney studio’s first black animator, has little patience with the Dumbo controversy; see his blog essay “Black Crows and Other Nonsense.”\n\n‡It would have been nice had one of those two songs also won, as “When You Wish Upon a Star” did the year before — “Baby Mine” was nominated — but with Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II’s wistful “The Last Time I Saw Paris” copping the award, I doubt there were many grumbles about the eventual winner… except, interestingly, by Kern himself; he was upset that he won for something not written for a movie, and petitioned to change the rules concerning nomination.\n\nText copyright 2020 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nThe first time I saw David Hand’s Snow White…\n\n(Wait a minute! What? Exactly. The above is a deliberate representation of the lunatic extremes to which the perpetual abuse of the auteur theory in America is so often, and so hilariously, misapplied. I would be willing to bet that, in the pages of the whatever publication Andrew Sarris was writing for, Walt Disney’s early masterpiece, whose every frame and incident bears the mark of his overseeing hand, would have been listed, absolutely without irony and because he was credited as the picture’s Supervising Director, as “David Hand’s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”)\n\nAs I was saying… The first time I saw Snow White, on its 1967 reissue, I was six years old and it was 30. (It’s over 80 now, and I am far from six.) It’s one of those events for which I recall, not just the movie, or even the live-action featurette, The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle, that accompanied it, but the circumstances: My mother took me to a matinee screening, uncharacteristically without my sister (she may have been at summer camp) and, being a cartoon-mad child and this my second animated features (Cinderella was the first), it was a red-letter day for me. I see from my research that my long-held memory of the date has played me false: I was convinced that it was a school-day, and a cold one, suggesting winter, and 1965, before I entered kindergarten. But it seems the movie was re-released in June, making me wonder if my additional memory — of my having to take a hot bath before we left, and of Mom’s taking me to a drug store lunch counter for a hot cocoa with whipped cream (another first) afterward and buying me a tiny soft rubber “Admiral Pelican” toy — are images from another occasion, although I’m still convinced I got the pelican that day.* Well, memory as we all know is far from entirely reliable, but whatever the circumstances surrounding my seeing Snow White, the vividness of my first exposure to that movie has never faded.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the images that hit hardest, and have stuck longest, were the more horrific ones: Of Snow White’s race through the forest, and how, in her panicked, fevered imagination the trees reach out for her and logs turn into crocodiles; of the wicked Queen’s terrifying transformation into the poison apple-bearing hag; of her dispatching of Snow White, the heroine’s arm falling into the frame, a bitten apple rolling away from her open hand; and of the Queen’s subsequent, poetically justified, demise, the vultures circling down into the mist to feast on her freshly dead flesh. Those are nightmare sequences, of which Disney was a true master: They’re in all his studio’s genuinely great animated features (aside perhaps from Cinderella, although the stepsisters’ tearing the heroine’s gown to shreds and the cat Lucifer’s falling from the high window at the climax may qualify) and they remain fixed in the memories of millions — perhaps billions — of former children.\n\nI can also recall, as I imagine was and is true of others, my delight in the wonderfully delineated Dwarfs (particularly Dopey, Sneezy, Grumpy and Doc; I had never heard Spoonerisms before, and Doc became my favorite because of his), their comic actions, and the infectious joy with which they sing and dance their “Silly Song” with Snow White. These too are areas in which Walt would prove masterly, although I take issue with the people on the Disney Blu-ray documentary who claim Oklahoma! as the “first fully integrated musical,” and that Disney beat it by eight years. Not only was the 1927 Show Boat the real precursor of all of this, but Walt seems not to have known that Sigmund Romberg’s day had passed: The first 25 minutes or so of Snow White, until the Dwarfs reach home and discover something amiss at their cottage, is virtually a turn-of-the-century operetta, employing almost no dialogue — except the Queen’s — and arriving complete with twittering coloratura and sexless tenor, in love from the moment they see each other; they’d doubtless have been considered real humdingers at the Hippodrome in 1907. (Until she meets the Dwarfs, all of Snow White’s dialogue rhymes as well, something almost no one, including Walt Disney, could ever carry off.)† Snow White herself, as voiced by Adriana Caselotti, dates the movie more than anything else in it; she obviously fit Walt’s conception of the fairy tale adolescent heroine, and while small children may not mind her, and may even find her comforting, she has a way of making adults’ back teeth ache. Which is a shame, because your grown-up irritation can cause you to miss all sorts of wonders, such as how remarkably done Snow White’s reflection in her wishing-well is in the opening sequence, an effect people now take for granted but which in 1937 was revelatory, the product of the new Multiplane camera without which much of the visual impact of Snow White on its contemporary audience would have been infinitely less.\n\nAs a child of the ’60s, and while I instinctively gravitated to “funny animal” comic books (mostly Gold Key reprints) I had until that afternoon very little exposure to full animation. Where would I have seen it? By the time I was cognizant of such things, roughly the age of 4 or 5, most animation on television, unless it was comprised of old theatrical shorts, had succumbed to the cost-saving, and art-shaving, Hanna-Barbera “limited animation” model which ultimately poisoned the animation well for decades. The only exceptions, at least in the Canton, Ohio area where I was born, were the old Terrytoons and Paramount (alas, not Fleischer) Popeye shorts on local morning and afternoon kiddie-shows, “Bugs Bunny” on Saturday mornings and the all-too occasional vintage short on “Walt Disney’s Wonderful World of Color” Sunday night showcase. Not even the Peanuts specials, charming though they were, exhibited much in the way of visual artistry, and although my parents had a Zenith television/radio/turntable console, they elected for the black-and-white model, presumably at the time the less expensive choice; as a result, I never saw color television on a regular basis until I moved away from home at 19. (I still remember the wonder with which, at age 7, I first beheld a color television broadcast, on the set of an elderly family friend. It was a Kukla, Fran and Ollie special, Burr Tillstrom’s 1968 television adaptation of The Reluctant Dragon, and I can still picture in my mind the sight of Ollie’s glittering, bejeweled chest: sparkling imitation gems on a field of deep, vivid blue.) So an item like Snow White, especially projected on a big movie theater screen — something I also hadn’t experienced often — was utterly entrancing. And I was exactly the right age for the picture: Young enough to enjoy it on a purely childish level yet old enough not to be traumatized by its darker sequences. (You want emotional trauma? Try Bambi. Thank God I was in my 20s before I saw that one.)\n\nAnd what an aggregation of animators worked on the thing! Along with such relative veterans of the Disney studio as Hand, Art Babbitt, Shamus Culhane, Grim Natwick (who, while at Fleischer, had worked on a jazzy, satirical Snow White short for the character he created, Betty Boop), Fred Moore, Dick Lundy, Wilfred Jackson, Ben Sharpsteen, Norm Ferguson, Hamilton Luske and Vladmir “Bill” Tytla, every single member of the group that would come to be called “Walt’s Nine Old Men” (Les Clark, Milt Kahl, Ward Kimball, Eric Larsen, Woolie Reitherman, Frank Thomas, Marc Davis, Ollie Johnston and John Lounsberry) was involved, along with Larry Morey (who also wrote the song lyrics), Pete Alvardo, Michael Lah (who, after Tex Avery left MGM, later directed Droopy shorts there) and David Swift, who would, like Frank Tashlin, later become a live-action director. Not to mention (why do we say that, and then mention?) Ferdinand Hovarth and Gustaf Tenggren — who, like Hovarth helped design the Dwarfs, provided magnificent conceptual art of the backgrounds and buildings, and painted the gorgeous original release poster seen above — and Albert Hurter, whose splendid character designs were also integral to the visual luster of the movie. A stable of creative artists like that is impossible to imagine today, and they, as much as Walt himself, turned what in Hollywood was snickered at as a disaster-in-the-making into a work of genuine popular art, an international financial juggernaut that, more than any other project in the studio’s history, made possible everything that flowed from it. Walt liked to say that his fortune was built on a mouse but if Mickey was the foundation his studio really stood on the shoulders of a beribboned teenager in a peasant blouse.\n\nMy previous observations about the songs in Snow White are not meant as a criticism of the numbers themselves, merely the structure built to house them. While not as rich, or as intriguingly dark, as their counterparts in the later, and more ambitious, Pinocchio (1940) the musical numbers here perform their duties efficiently, and with a great deal of charm. Moreover, whatever my complaints about the dated operetta style, each number flows into the next, and there is a particularly nice juxtaposition of “Whistle While You Work” and the Dwarfs’ “Heigh-Ho” (just as Disney achieves real suspense with his cutting between Snow White being menaced by the Witch and the little men and forest animals racing to save her.) Larry Morey’s lyrics are seldom of a kind that would have lost Cole Porter any sleep, but they weren’t intended to be clever or sophisticated. They were expected to convey generalized emotions, and they do. The music by Frank Churchill, however, is exceptional, and not only did nearly all his and Morey’s songs (“Heigh-Ho”, “Whistle While You Work,” “With a Smile and a Song”) enter the American Popular Songbook, some of them, like “Some Day My Prince Will Come,” became jazz standards as well. Carl Stalling, an old Kansas City hand, worked at Disney on the early Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphonys, and after he decamped in 1930 the Disney shorts were accompanied by instantly forgettable music. These continued to be uninspired musically, but after Snow White, the features at least had superb scores: Paul Smith also worked on it and while when I see the movie I can’t really distinguish his compositions I can immediately determine which cues were composed by Leigh Harline; his quirky little motif for Dopey, for example, is instantly recognizable as Harline’s, a brief precursor to his theme for Jiminy Cricket in Pinocchio three years later.\n\nMusic was, of course, integral to Disney’s success; he saw the potential of sound immediately, developed Steamboat Willie (1928) to exploit it, and continued to experiment with it throughout the 1930s. The Three Little Pigs (1933) in particular depends on music, and song, and the Depression-era public embraced Churchill’s “Who’s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?” as a Depression anthem. Walt’s embrace of a bigger sound for his Silly Symphony shorts — the name, if not the concept, was immediately imitated by Leon Schlesinger; Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies could not have existed without Disney’s model — must have thoroughly confused the money-men at other studios. Symphonic accompaniment for cartoons? What next? An animated feature? (Yes.) Whatever criticisms may be lobbed at Disney himself, or at the ravening corporation he spawned, his (and its) musical instincts have been more than effectual. Snow White set the prototype.\n\nIf Caselotti is a sticky embodiment of virtue, the redoubtable stage actress Lucille La Verne is a marvelously fulsome personification of vice. Her Wicked Queen is silkily vicious, a walking, preening avatar of vanity (the Queen’s throne is in the form of a peacock) who seems to live only to be desirable. And La Verne’s Witch is thrillingly loathsome, the sort of figure to send delicious chills up a child’s spine. She’s not merely a perfect disguise; she is the Queen’s very essence: her soul, given external form. If her movements, like those of the Queen, are a series of melodramatic, silent-movie posturings, she is no less effective for them. The Disney artists were not yet ready for subtlety in characterizing evil; it would take years of experiment, and a much richer vocal artist (Eleanor Audley) to arrive at the more shaded, and more correspondingly frightening, Stepmother for Cinderella and wicked fairy Maleficent in Sleeping Beauty.\n\nDisney’s distillation of the Dwarfs’ personalities is even more successful, their endearing idiosyncrasies suggested by their names and brought to fruition by the way they are animated as much as by the men who gave them voice. Disney, no less than his rivals at the Schlesinger or Fleischer studios, was, as so many were at the time, tuned in to vaudeville and radio (if perhaps less directly imitative) and most of the Dwarfs reflect that interest: Roy Atwell’s trademark stammering and malapropisms informed Doc’s pomposity, while Billy Gilbert, a master of explosive sternutation, was a natural for Sneezy and Otis Harlin (Happy) had a voice that radiated joviality. Eddie Collins, the model for Dopey (and purveyor of his occasional hiccups and excited twitterings) was studied for his distinctive movement while Scotty Mattraw, known for his bucolic characters, was a natural for Bashful. Pinto Colvig was likely a no-brainer as well for Grumpy and Sleepy; a Disney gag writer and sound effects man, Colvig was also for many years the great voice of Goofy, my favorite of Disney’s characters.\n\nUp to this point in animation history, the standard practice for dealing with a collection of like figures in cartoons, at Disney and elsewhere, was to make them more or less interchangeable: They look indistinguishable and move together uniformly (The Skeleton Dance, 1929) or in identical patterns (the imps and flowers in The Goddess of Spring, 1934). With The Three Little Pigs Walt grasped the power, and the appeal, of character delineation. For his first feature, his Dwarfs couldn’t just be a mass, a septet of identical-looking (and acting) stick figures. They had to have individual personalities, and inter-familial conflicts. We sense within minutes that Doc is the most self-important of the seven and believes himself their natural leader while Grumpy is his polar opposite, adversarial in every situation, the voice of the pessimist where Doc radiates optimism, and that Dopey is the Dwarfs’ communal backwards child, petted and tolerated as much because of his eagerness to oblige despite obvious mental limitations as for his essential sweetness of personality. This sort of thing, de rigueur now in animation, had its basis in the Three Pigs but had never before been seen on the scale of Snow White. The Dwarfs’ personae are easily graspable by the children in the audience for their eponymous characteristics yet beloved of adults for their humor and their recognizability. And when, at the climax, they were seen weeping at Snow white’s coffin, members of the audience joined them, moved as much, I suspect, by Disney’s sheer audacity in depicting such a thing as by the Dwarfs’ collective sorrow. Hey! These little guys are real! (Frank Thomas animated this emotionally plangent sequence.)\n\nAs an adolescent, Disney had seen the 1916 Snow White starring Marguerite Clark at a special showing for newsboys, which made a marked impression on him, so it is perhaps unsurprising that he would choose it as the subject of his first feature. Development had begun as early as 1934 — Walt’s memorable first story conference, in which, characteristically, he acted out his ideas for the staff, including the youngest dwarf using a single feather for a pillow, later a charming moment for Dopey in the completed picture, occurred that autumn. As he demanded sequences be redone, and scrapped two in the pencil-test stage, before they could be completed and painted, the budget kept climbing (it eventually reached a then-unheard-of $1.49 million) but the proof was in the pudding. The movie grossed $3.5 million in North America, $6.5 million by 1939 and by the end of its original release run earned a whopping $7.85 million internationally. Including its various re-issues over the decades (every seven years from 1937, grabbing roughly a new generation of impressionable young viewers each time, your humble scribe very much included) its box-office reached $418 million, with Mickey only knows how much money generated in the sales of related books, records and toys and, later, various home-videos of the picture itself — that crucial process of accretion cited by Walt and, later, as “synergy,” so beloved of his successor, Michael Eisner. So much for what those in the know had once smugly called “Disney’s Folly.”\n\nThe movie holds up, in a way few 80-year-old pictures do. It helps, of course, that it’s set in an indeterminate period, and kingdom, and with no anachronisms and none of the cringe-inducing democratizing (really, Americanization) Disney later went in for, the nadir of which is probably Bing Crosby referring to Ichabod Crane in The Legend of Sleepy Hollow (1949) as “Ol’ Icky.” Given a pleasing restoration on its 50th anniversary in 1987, Snow White looks spectacular on Blu-ray, its palette a beautifully balanced mixture of muted tones for its natural and architectural backgrounds and bold Technicolor splashes for the characters’ costumes and such important elements as that terrifyingly enticing, bright red apple. The Prince is almost entirely characterlessness — all he does is sing a little, and deliver that revivifying kiss at the end, and next to the vividly-defined Dwarfs he barely exists — but the design and execution of the normal-sized human characters is such a vast improvement on figures like the hilariously stilted Persephone of The Goddess of Spring‡ (when she “dances” she looks like Clarabell Cow imitating Isadora Duncan) as to constitute a quantum leap in animation possibility, and there are almost no missteps in the picture. Pretty much the only error I picked up on as I watched it again the other night was one of continuity: A quick depiction of Dopey’s drumming hands emerging from his distinctive yellow sweater during the “Silly Song” at the same time he and Sneezy are dancing with Snow White. I’m surprised Walt didn’t have that re-painted, but, as with the Prince shimmying slightly at the climax it may have been too late, and too expensive, to fix.\n\nI’ll end on the return to a personal note: After seeing the movie with me our mother bought us the Snow White “Magic Mirror” LP, which I played and re-played obsessively, and a reprint of the comic book (re-purposed from the original 1937-1938 newspaper strip adaptation drawn by Hank Porter and Bob Grant) accompanied me on our car-trip to the 1967 Expo in Montreal that summer. I re-read that one until it was pretty much in tatters. (I also had the coloring book, which puzzled me because it depicted the cut sequence of the Dwarfs making a bed for Snow White, and a little plush doll of Doc I now wish I’d held onto.)\n\nAs I was already hooked on cartoons, and on Disney, before seeing Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, it can’t be said that Walt claimed another child-victim with his studio’s 1967 reissue. Yet I won’t deny that seeing it deepened the addiction as I also realize there’s something insidious about Disney’s hand-rubbing calculation; he liked to crow about the figures showing that nearly every American had seen a Disney movie, read a Disney comic, played a Disney record or owned a Disney game or toy. It’s worse, of course, now his company has become a corporate octopus, busily grabbing up any-and-everything that might attract a child’s attention, from Muppets to Marvel to Star Wars. (And let’s not forget the company’s current, gorge-rising, emphasis on enticing vulnerable little girls with its “Disney Princesses,” from Snow to, one presumes, Leia.) But when a movie is a genuine astonishment, as Snow White was and continues to be eight decades after its original release, even a Grumpy might be forced to admit there are worse things out there vying for a child’s attention than this bright, tuneful, funny and ultimately cathartic fantasy.\n\n*Admiral Pelican, discovered on eBay a few years back. My original was orange, but you can’t have everything.\n\n†The Dwarfs rhyme with her as well, before she sings “Someday My Prince Will Come,” and all the Magic Mirror’s dialogue is in verse. (“Over the seven jeweled hills / Beyond the seventh wall / In the cottage of the Seven Dwarfs / Dwells Snow White, fairest one of all.”)\n\n‡ Is it just me, or does the Devil look in this short very like a thinly-disguised caricature of Disney?\n\nText copyright 2020 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nThe 2001 restoration of Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971) raises some interesting, and unsettling, questions, about the process.\n\nEven when exceptional care and devotion are lavished on a movie, as with David Lean’s 1989 “director’s cut” of Lawrence of Arabia, some of the results may be less than felicitous. Lean had second thoughts, for some inscrutable reason, about a single line in the Michael Wilson-Robert Bolt screenplay spoken by Peter O’Toole, and his revision completely reversed its meaning.\n\nGeneral Allenby: You’re the most extraordinary man I’ve ever met!\n\nLawrence: Leave me alone! […]\n\nAllenby: Well, that’s a feeble thing to say.\n\nLawrence: I know I’m not ordinary.\n\nAllenby: That’s not what I’m saying…\n\nLawrence: All right! I’m extra ordinary! What of it?\n\nIn 1989, Lean re-jiggered that loaded adjective to a mere “extraordinary.” The difference? Only the world.\n\nLike Bedknobs and Broomsticks, Lawrence was eviscerated, both at the time of its release and for later reissue. By linking the two I am certainly not suggesting that one is any way the equal of the other. Bedknobs is a pleasant, if somewhat derivative, fantasy musical with engaging performers and a charming Sherman Brothers score, while Lawrence is one of the supreme glories of the English-speaking cinema. Where the two intersect is in their shared histories of imbecilic, ruinous wholesale cuts for no reason other than commerce. Where their revivals differ is in the quality of the restoration process itself.\n\nWhen Lean required lines to be dubbed onto found footage with no soundtrack, he not only called upon as many of his original cast as were still alive and able; he also recorded the lines with an ear to matching the original on-set recording as much as he did to replicating the actual timbres of the much younger actors on-screen. Lean seems, puzzlingly, virtually alone in this. In nearly every other large-scale restoration of its kind — Spartacus comes to mind, with its visually and aurally flawed restoration of the infamous “snails and oysters” sequence — the ambient sound of the newly dubbed lines in no way matches what was originally recorded. How was Lean able to do that which no one else either cares to, knows how to, or is, seemingly, capable? How did Columbia Pictures in 1989 re-create the sound quality of 1962?\n\nI don’t know the name of, and have never been able to track down, the specific sound recording system Walt Disney and his company employed from the 1950s to the ’70s, any more than I can identify the superb system employed by Warner Bros. from the 1940s on to, at least, the late 1960s. (Warners originally used Vitaphone for their talkies, but that recording system had long since passed by the time of The Maltese Falcon.) But one has only to listen with half an ear to the soundtrack of any film from either studio from those years to appreciate the crystal clarity of the reproduction.* Were these sound designs deemed antiquated at some point, perhaps with the creation of newer microphones and tape systems, the original equipment junked? Or is there some other, even more technically complicated reason for the discrepancy? Why, so often, in movies and on CD, does the much-vaunted digital process pale next to the allegedly “inferior” sound recording of analog? Why is Mono sometimes fuller, sharper and clearer than Stereo? (Really, I’m asking. If you know, please enlighten me.)\n\nWhatever the reason, in the case of Bedknobs and Broomsticks, all the re-dubbed scenes are reproduced, not with the striking crispness of the original but with the infinitely more casual, and muffled, make-do of our current era. Of course I know that sound recorded on a studio set with its unique, ambient quality, can seldom be replicated in a studio; it’s why, whatever the time period, you can nearly always tell which lines have been over-dubbed later — although, in his Hollywood pictures anyway, Orson Welles was especially good at matching. Indeed, in the case of musicals, pre-recorded vocals seldom replicate live sound. But the absolutely dead sound the 2001 Disney engineers retro-fitted onto this movie is matched in apathy only by the appalling voice work provided by the actors attempting to double for David Tomlinson and Tessie O’Shea, the latter of whose accent now fluctuates wildly over the British Isles, like some berserk vocalic Norman chasing after an elusive, mute Saxon zombie.‡\n\nAny number of additional ironies attached themselves to this one: The original cut of the movie ran about 2 hours and 20 minutes and was intended as one of the last of the big “road-show” spectacles of the era. Unbelievably, Walt Disney Productions planned its premier at Radio City Music Hall in, it seems, complete ignorance of that tatty but venerable establishment’s inviolable rule that pictures which accompany its live stage shows be of no more than two hours in length. Disney exceeded that demand, and duly sheared 30 minutes, not merely for Radio City but the movie’s general release as well, losing several musical numbers and so much dialogue that what was left was difficult to follow — surely a disastrous outcome for a fantasy aimed as much at children as their parents. The studio further compounded this minor obscenity by utterly eviscerating what remained for a late-’70s reissue: 139 minutes in 1971 became first 117 and, finally, a paltry 99 in 1979. Many of the dialogue sequences restored had lost their soundtrack, hence the (again, execrable) re-dubbing. In a final (and, it seems, irreversible) irony, the very impetus for the restoration, bringing Angela Lansbury’s “A Step in the Right Direction” number, cut in 1971 but extant on the original soundtrack album, back to the movie, was thwarted; it has disappeared and was, presumably, destroyed(!)†\n\nI was young enough in 1971 (10, if you’re morbidly interested) to love even the truncated original, although I loved it a little less a few months later, on reading Mary Norton’s The Magic Bed-Knob and Bonfires and Broomsticks, which don’t bear much resemblance to the movie on which they were, exceedingly loosely, based. Best to think of the movie, as with the more vaunted (and popular) Mary Poppins, as a variation on a theme.\n\nMy invoking Poppins is not coincidental. Not only was the same creative team responsible for Bedknobs, from the screenwriters Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi and the director Robert Stevenson to the song-writing Shermans, but both narratives involved magical (and musical, if somewhat starchy) spinsters looking after small children, contain animated/live action sequences, and feature Tomlinson, here promoted from secondary lead to co-star. (It’s tantalizing, if fruitless, to imagine the movie with Lansbury squired by Ron Moody, who had to bow out due to a scheduling conflict.) But where Poppins is light on its feet, emotionally plangent and possessed of a seemingly effortless charm, Bedknobs is, despite its magical elements, more earth-bound, less felicitous, and in general has less sentimental resonance than an average re-run of “Lassie.” (If that’s still around.)\n\nAnd yet… the restored Bedknobs and Broomsticks has much to recommend it, enough to overcome even the dreadfulness of the new dubbing. First, the presence of Angela Lansbury. This almost criminally under-utilized performer was given her finest and most taxing roles not in film (her acid-etched portrait of mother-love gone mad in The Manchurian Candidate excepted), in which she began, or on television, where she reigned for some time in the 1980s, but on Broadway. Bedknobs represents her only real, extensive opportunity to shine on the big screen, not merely as the star, but as a musical star, and is, perforce, eminently treasurable.\n\nRoy Snart, Ian Weighill and Cindy O’Callaghan, the Cockney children Lansbury’s apprentice-witch is saddled with, are exceptionally well-cast, believable both as siblings and as War orphans, and never, as Disney tots alas tend, cloying. Tomlinson clearly had a high old time of it playing a rogue who would have given his own Mr. Banks in Mary Poppins the jim-jams, and Sam Jaffe makes a small repast of his appearance as the slightly sinister Bookman. Roddy McDowall, in his relatively brief but cunningly executed role as a nakedly avaricious country vicar, is especially welcome; the restoration gives him greater prominence, which is useful, as the truncated version left one scratching one’s head, wondering why he was there at all. If only the great Welsh music-hall performer Tessie O’Shea, seen solely in dialogue sequences as a firm but kindly postmistress, had been given a dance or two!\n\nThe true movie aficionado will also spot, in tiny roles — some indeed mere glimpses — beloved character actors such as the inimitably high-voiced Arthur Malet (Mr. Dawes, Jr. of Poppins), Reginald Owen (Admiral Boom of same), Cyril Delevanti (the beautiful old poet Nono of Night of the Iguana), and, somewhat shockingly, old John Ford hand Hank Worden, barely noticeable, singing as part of the seaside town’s Old Home Guard. The twinned live action/animation sequences, directed by the often-brilliant Disney veteran Ward Kimball, are variable. The first, in which Lansbury et al. find themselves in an island lagoon, is charm itself. Crashing an underwater tea-dance, Lansbury and Tomlinson perform a delightfully — there’s no other word for it — fluid duet, in a Sherman Brothers number that is quite obviously the precursor and onlie begettor of The Little Mermaid’s “Under the Sea,” cleverly orchestrated by Irwin Kostel in patented 1940s ballroom fashion.\n\nThe second is more problematic. The Shermans expected the follow-up sequence on the Island of Naboombu, wherein Tomlinson attempts to make off with the animated lion king’s enchanted medallion, to be musical, and penned a sleight-of-hand routine for the versatile actor. What the filmmakers presented them instead was a non-musical, mildly diverting, football game. (Helpfully if inappropriately translated for American audiences as “soccer.”) If you stop to analyze the set-up, you’re lost: Why would these animals, whether immortal or merely the descendants of the enchanted originals, and who explicitly bar humans from their refuge, even know what football is, let alone be mad for it? Why, indeed, are they dressed contemporaneously? Logic takes as much of an un-jolly holiday here as music.\n\nFar better, and nearly worth the entire restoration, is the preceding, and greatly extended, “Portobello Road” dance sequence, which Pauline Kael, while deploring the cuts, enthused over. Here, the faded work-prints were beautifully enhanced, especially in the delightful Jamaican section. Now at last that Kostel-arranged Overture makes sense, as we finally understand why the master orchestrator spiced it throughout with brief, ethnically derived riffs and quotations. It is as if MGM, to squeeze in an extra screening or two, had cut the “Broadway Melody” ballet from the release print of Singin’ in the Rain.\n\nWatching the extended edition of the movie, you understand just how badly the Shermans were represented by the 1971 truncation. Doubly sad, as it was in a sense the brothers’ last hurrah for Disney, and that the movie, even at just under 2 hours, was a financial disappointment: $17 million domestic rentals on a $20 million budget. Fortunately, and somewhat balancing the ultimate loss of “A Step in the Right Direction,” the restoration reinstates the wistful Lansbury ballad “Nobody’s Problems,” an all-too-brief reprise of a longer, and un-filmed, number for the children.\n\nIt’s far too easy for cultural critics, especially today, to cynically dismiss the Shermans, but this snobbery does not admit of their innate and almost profligate musicality, their respect for narrative and characterization, and their sophisticated rhyming which is, somehow, both comprehensible to children and satisfying to adults simultaneously.\n\nYou try that trick.\n\nI’ll time you.\n\n*Listen to any Looney Tunes or Merry Melodies short from the ’40s and ’50s for a prime exemplar.\n\n†Amazingly, Disney made this “mistake” with the Music Hall three years earlier, on another Sherman Bros. musical, when it cut 46 minutes from The One and Only Genuine Original Family Band for its 1967 Radio City run, over the objections of Richard and Robert Sherman and that of the picture’s producer Bill Anderson. So Roy O. Disney, who ran the studio after Walt’s death, could hardly have pretended he didn’t know about the two-hour Musical Hall time limit. Did he just arrogantly believe Radio City would relax its long-standing rules to get a Disney attraction?\n\n‡I wonder if the people involved in this miserable venture were aware that nearly the entire dialogue soundtrack of the 1960 Swiss Family Robinson was re-dubbed after principal photography, due to terrible aural conditions on Tobago during the filming — and you’d never guess unless you knew. Even granted all the actors in that one were still very much alive, if it could be done so well then, why is it so damn difficult now?\n\nText copyright 2014 by Scott Ross"
