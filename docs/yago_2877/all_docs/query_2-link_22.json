        "text": "April 11, 2024\n\nâ€” If you are even a casual space history enthusiast, watching the new trailer for the upcoming movie \"Fly Me to the Moon\" might leave you thinking that it is an entire work of fiction.\n\nAnd for the most part, you would be correct.\n\nAs the trailer reveals and Columbia Pictures and Apple Original Films' synopsis reads, \"Fly Me to the Moon\" is a \"comedy-drama set against the high-stakes backdrop of NASA's historic Apollo 11 moon landing.\" Scarlett Johansson plays the fictional Kelly Jones, a marketing maven who is brought in to fix NASA's public image, and in the process, \"wreaks havoc\" on the task set forth for launch director Cole Davis (Channing Tatum).\n\n\"I work here now, to sell the moon,\" says Jones (Johansson), explaining why she is at NASA to Davis (Tatum) in the trailer.\n\nIn the two minute and 30 second video, Jones is shown organizing commercial product placements for the Apollo astronauts to endorse and, when she cannot get NASA's team of engineers to do interviews, replaces them with actors. All of which leads to the film's crux, \"Project Artemis\" (not to be confused with NASA's Artemis program, which seeks to return astronauts to the moon today, 50 years after the Apollo program ended).\n\n\"The whole world will be watching, we can't afford to lose to the Russians. We need to shoot a backup version,\" says Woody Harrelson, as a yet to be identified NASA official.\n\nIn other words, they need to fake the moon landing.\n\n'Fly Me to the Moon' trailer.
