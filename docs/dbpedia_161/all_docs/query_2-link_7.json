Radhika Pandit has done a neat job. V Harikrishna walks away with honours for his excellent numbers. Krishna’s cinematography is pleasing to the eye\".[20] Srikanth Srinivasa from Rediff.com wrote \"Krishna's camera work is good while Harikrishna's music is a winner. The title song, Bombe aadisuvanu and Tundu Haikala Sawasa are already popular. Drama could have been a little more dramatic but is worth a watch for all the entertainment the young team gives us\".[21] Shruti I. L. from DNA wrote \"Krishna’s cinematography also does justice to the script. This is one drama you would want to be a part of... but just make sure you don’t bunk your classes to do so as the film comes precisely with one such message\".[22] A critic from News18 India wrote \"'Drama' is a film that genuine Kannada film audience can not miss. It may have its pitfalls, yet it bears the stamp of Yogaraj Bhat's talents. Watch it!\".[23] A critic from The Hindu wrote \"Bhat has tried his best to please both the classes and masses with homilies, stereotypes, emotions, suspense and scenic locales. A bit more effort on his part and he would come up with a satisfying thriller. Though the first half meanders, the narration picks up in the second half enough to be compelling. Drama unfolds within\".[24]\n\nBox office\n\n[edit]\n\nDrama got a good opening upon release. The film went on to become one of the highest grossers of 2012 by completing 100 days of run[25] and grossing ₹20 Crore against its ₹4 Crore budget and was declared as a Blockbuster.[26]\n\nAccolades\n\n[edit]\n\nCeremony Category Nominee Result 2nd South Indian International Movie Awards Best Director Yogaraj Bhat Nominated Best Actor in a Supporting Role Ambareesh Nominated Best Actress in a Supporting Role Sindhu Lokanath Nominated Best Comedian Sathish Ninasam Nominated Best Lyricist Yogaraj Bhat for \"Bombe Aadsonu\" Nominated Best Male Playback Singer Vijay Prakash for \"Thund Haikla Sahavasa\" Nominated\n\nOverseas release\n\n[edit]\n\nDrama was premiered in USA.[27][28][29][30] Drama was also premiered in UAE.[31] Drama was also screened in Germany.
