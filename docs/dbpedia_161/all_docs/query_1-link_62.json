        "text": "Choreographer-turned-director A Harsha and Yash had announced long back that they will be working together for a film titled Raana. However, there have been no updates about it. Sources in the know say that after the grand success of KGF Chapter 1, Yash is looking for an even bigger hit and so is keen on releasing its sequel. Therefore, he has decided not to work on Harsha’s film, the sources say. Another set of rumours doing the rounds is that Yash had wanted Harsha to make some changes to the script, but the latter did not agree. Whatever the reason, it is now almost certain that Yash will not be working with Harsha on Raana.\n\nMeanwhile, we hear that Kannada superstar Shiva Rajkumar may be hopping onboard Raana. Sources in the know say that the director will be making some changes to the script to ensure that the characterisation suits the star. Incidentally, Shiva Rajkumar and Harsha share a good rapport after having worked together earlier in Bhajarangi and Vaayuputra.\n\nIt may be noted here that Shiva Rajkumar’s next film release will be Kavacha. A remake of the Malayalam blockbuster Oppam, the star will appear as a blind man in this movie. Kruthika Jayakumar plays the lead opposite him. The film is in the post production stage and the release date is expected to be announced officially soon. Directed by GVR Vasu, Kavacha is bankrolled by MVV Sathyanarayanan under the banner Hayagriva Movie Adishtana. The star cast also includes Isha Koppikar, Baby Meenakshi and Vasishta N Simha in pivotal roles. Rahul Shrivastav is cranking the camera for the film and the music is composed by Arjun Janya.\n\nRustum is another film that the star is working on right now. The film is produced by Jayanna and Bhogendra under the banner Jayanna Combines. Shraddha Srinath has been roped in to play the woman lead and Mayuri will be seen as Shiva Rajkumar’s sister. Touted to be a romantic action entertainer, Rustum will mark the directorial debut of ace stunt master Ravi Varma. Anoop Seelin is scoring the music for this movie and Mahendra Simha is wielding the camera."
