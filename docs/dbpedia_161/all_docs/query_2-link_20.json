I feel blessed that Shivanna agreed to work with me. This is the first time I will be working with my cousin,” he says.\n\nThe character was not written with Shivarajkumar in mind. However, when the makers were looking for an actor for the role, they thought Shivanna will fit the bill, says Sriimurali. ’"
