        "text": "After nearly 15 (collective) years at Fortune, I am stepping away from my full-time role. I’ll still be very much involved with the Most Powerful Women Summit, which is near and dear to my heart, and contribute to Fortune’s features and the Leadership Next podcast. But I’ll also be pursuing other projects outside of Fortune, including a new podcast and writing that I hope will stretch me in new directions. I first joined Fortune as a tech reporter in 2007, at the age of 27 (I was subsequently laid off, and then rejoined a couple of years later—which goes to show you that there is a future after a layoff!). I’ve grown up at Fortune, literally and figuratively, and it’s hard to describe the many ways my identity is wrapped up with the publication that has been home for most of my adult life. This place, and the people, have shaped who I am today. Indeed, there are so many lessons and incredible memories from my years at Fortune, but what sticks out the most are the editors and managers I’ve worked for—the talented, compassionate advocates I was so lucky to have on my side. Over the years, they helped me become a better writer, pushed me to take on new challenges like live events and podcasts and management, and supported me on a path that not just encompassed my career but my life and its many unexpected twists and turns. I am forever indebted to Fortune and to the people, both past and present, who have made it so much more than a job for me, and I am thrilled to still play a role in this storied brand’s future. I’m also excited to dive into some new projects, and to see where this next phase of my career takes me. Like many people I know, I was changed by October 7 and the subsequent war between Israel/Gaza. These tragic events have pushed me to want to write not just about tech but the intersection of tech + geopolitics, two topics that are more intertwined than ever before. What does that mean exactly, in terms of what I'll be doing? I’ll let you know soon as I find out. (The photo below is of me conducting my first on-stage interview at Fortune Brainstorm Tech ten years ago. Thank you to Adam Lashinsky and Stephanie Mehta for throwing me in the water, with none other than Hans Vestberg!)"
