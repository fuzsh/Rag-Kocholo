        "text": "After gaining a lot of popularity among Tamil audiences with 'Jailer', Shiva Rajkumar returns to Tamil cinema with Arun Matheswaran's 'Captain Miller'. The new film is set to arrive in theatres on January 12th, 2024, and the makers recently released a new poster which suggests that the veteran superstar has a prominent role in the offing.\n\nTo make things better for fans, 'Captain Miller' is set to release in not only Tamil but also Kannada and Hindi, with KRG Studios distributing the film all across Karnataka. The same distribution and production house has previously distributed films like 'Chithha', 'Jigarthanda Double X' and '12th Fail'.\n\nWith the Kannada version of 'Jailer' (distributed by Jayanna Combines) yielding great results, 'Captain Miller's dubbed release is expected to fare as well. 'Jailer' (Kannada), thanks to Shivanna's dashing cameo, went on to become the highest-grossing Kannada dubbed film in Karnataka (Rs. 5.71 crores) until Prashanth Neel's 'Salaar: Part 1 - Ceasefire' got past those numbers.\n\nAlso Read: 10 South films to look forward to in 2024 - Captain Miller, Thalapathy 68, Indian 2, Pushpa 2 on the list\n\nSo, it seems like the stage is well set for the Kannada version of 'Captain Miller' to put on a good show at the box office. The fact that Shiva Rajkumar plays an enterprising role (of Dhanush's on-screen older brother) should also help the cause - already, audiences in Karnataka have begun urging distributors to allot maximum screens to 'Captain Miller' (Kannada) so that they could do their bit of helping the film succeed.\n\nSet in pre-independent India, Dhanush stars in the action-drama which (reportedly) follows his titular character and his \"unconventional\" gang of outlaws who pull off daring heists and loots. As a wanted rebel, Miller must decide whether he wants to continue evading authorities or face them head-on. Here's the teaser of the film:"
