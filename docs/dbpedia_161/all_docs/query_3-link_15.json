She is a first-generation Chinese-American student from Los Angeles, California. Her parents are both immigrants from Taishan, China with only a middle school education. Surrounded by many cousins, aunts, and uncles speaking different dialects, Cindy grew up understanding Taishanese, Cantonese, and Mandarin.\n\nAs a result of her family not speaking English or understanding the American education system, Cindy was left to find support elsewhere and navigate it on her own. She filled out the forms to attend a magnet middle school and high school herself and continued to self-advocate at every\n\nturn in high school.

I am Chinese American and the first in my family to attend college. Next fall I will be attending UC Berkeley as an intended public health major. However, I plan to double major in business or data science and minor in a language or education.\n\nSome of my hobbies include going backpacking, cooking, and working with children. Backpacking is one of my favorite ways of disconnecting from a busy city like San Francisco. In the mornings, seeing the fog in the mountains while the steam of my hot coffee touches my nose is like nature’s version of an outdoor facial. I see cooking as a way to express my creativity rather than a chore. My favorite dishes to make are those that you can put your own spin into like tacos, spring rolls, and soups. I also enjoy working as a teacher’s assistant and am currently an intern for my school district working at a local after school program. I have also worked as a Nutrition Outreach Worker promoting healthy eating to my peers and promoting the use of the three bin system.\n\nAt school, I am part of a unique pathway at my school called Green Academy which is a curriculum that specializes in green technology and engineering while also providing opportunities to save and learn about our environment. Through Green Academy I am able to do my part in advocating for climate change action and speaking out against fast fashion. Clothing pollution is a huge matter on my radar, especially on how poorly they treat their garment workers in unthinkable working conditions. I hope to connect with more people in college who have the proper resources and work directly with organizations to create change. I consider myself a social butterfly and I can’t wait to see where that takes me!\n\nI was born in 2002, in a refugee camp located at the borders of Thailand and Myanmar. My family came to the US as refugees in 2008. Growing up, as a first generation immigrant I aided my parents with government papers and listened obediently to my parents. I got good grades and helped around my community in any way I could. When I turned 16, I got my first job in order to help my low income family and save for college. Because of the hours I worked, I did not get involved in school much. I’ve been working part-time and going to school full time ever since, while maintaining a 3.9 GPA at Logan High School. I took several college classes, not only to gain college credit but to explore what I was already interested in. I gained an interest in mental health and becoming a psychologist in middle school. I saw friends who struggled with mental illnesses but could not get help because they did not feel welcomed and could not afford it. This led to my desire to be a psychologist, and focus especially on mental health in low income and immigrant families. Coming from that community, my goal is to bring more attention to the lack of mental health awareness and resources into it.\n\nSandtelle Nguyen\n\nSandtelle is an incoming freshman at California State University, Fullerton majoring in Business Administration with an emphasis on Marketing and Information Systems.

At school, I am a proud member of the International Baccalaureate program and the vice president of the Literature Appreciation Society.\n\nAt university, I will be studying Linguistics and Computer Science. These two fields have always played a big role my entire life. Since I am the only one in my family with a formal education, I have the great responsibility of acting as a translator and a personal IT assistant! Coming from a low-income background, I understand the difficulties many first and second-generation low-income immigrants face when it comes to successfully navigating life in a city that doesn't speak their language. Through college and beyond, I hope to work towards a change and help close this language gap between all peoples.\n\nOutside of school, I love to work with my community, may it be volunteering for the City of Henderson or tutoring local high school students in math.

College courses had opened her eyes to the extensive information she could obtain from attending higher education. She plans to attend Sacramento State majoring in either health science or architecture.\n\nIn high school, Choua rediscovered her culture through taking part in school cultural clubs and classes, performing Hmong dances, and making an effort to relearn her language. In the process, she discovered her talent and love for art, trying many different mediums from clay to oil paint. While art and Hmong culture remain a big part of Choua, her education continues to empower her by providing her the resources to develop her knowledge of the two. When she is not preoccupied with school, Choua enjoys looking after her 3 younger brothers, and many nieces and nephews. She hopes to be a future role model for them.\n\nAs Choua Thao continues to grow, one thing she keeps in mind is the importance of her name. While Choua Thao may be a common Hmong name, when she writes it down on her work, whether it be school or art pieces, she carries the responsibility and holds into account the effort she put in.\n\nDiamond Thlang\n\nThe son of two Khmer refugees, Diamond Thlang has grown up in the Saint Paul-Minneapolis Metropolitan area in Minnesota.

After she quit gymnastics due to injury and started coaching, she really missed being in the clinic and decided that was what she wanted to do because she loved helping people. Throughout high school she took many sports medicine and science related classes and was intrigued with kinesiology. At first, she was very hesitant on pursuing her dream because of how rigorous and competitive the field is, but thanks to her loving teachers she grew the confidence to work hard to do so.\n\nDonna Fernandez\n\nDonna Fernandez is an incoming freshman at the University of California, Davis majoring in Environmental Science & Management as a first-generation Filipino-American student from Oakland, California.

King is a freshman at Anderson University majoring in Art Education. She was born in Atlanta, spent most of her childhood in Seattle, WA then migrated to Greenville, SC where she completed her junior high and high school years. Although Imani is considered of mixed race, it is the richness of her Filipino heritage that she identifies with the most and it was within this loving Filipino home that shaped her into who she is today. She enjoyed many forms of art and culture during her childhood including dancing 13 years of classical ballet, playing the violin, drawing, and painting. It was the latter hobbies that stuck with Imani the most and became her life’s passion.\n\nImani can vividly recall those precious homeschool days, where she did more than just learn the curriculum. Her mother encouraged her to be creative and explore hidden gems in each lesson. She used many tools to drive various points home but one that stood out the most was art. Within the most unexpected subjects such as language, science, history, and math, she would conclude her lesson then challenge Imani to explain what she learned via illustration. Already having a natural love for art, this method her mother used to stimulate Imani’s intellect inspired her to one day do the same.\n\nAs a future art educator, Imani strives to nurture, guide, stimulate, and grow the dreams of art students just like herself. With one stroke of a brush, one curve in pottery, one splash of watercolor, or a single acrylic masterpiece, she believes she too can make a difference.\n\nAyame Lewis\n\nAyame Lewis is a new freshman attending Pomona College in Claremont, CA majoring in Biology and Chemistry.\n\nHer mother came from Hiroshima, Japan.
