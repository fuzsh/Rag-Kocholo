        "text": "The latest buzz in Gandhinagar is that director A Harsha and producers Jayanna and Bogendra will be associating together for Kapi Cheste, after Jai Maruthi 800. Though nothing officially has been confirmed now, but our sources say that producer Jayanna has liked the script and Harsha’s working style and would want Kapi Cheste to be made under his banner Jayanna Combines. The director is getting ready with Jai Maruthi 800, which is now in post production stage. Knowing that Harsha would like to talk about one project at a time, anything about Kapi Cheste will be officially told after the release of his present project. While Harsha’s Jai Maruthi 800 hasSharan, Shruti Hariharan and Shubha Poonja in the star cast, the director is introducing Mohan Kumar, his long- time friend and assistting Harsha in the dance department.\n\nThe announcement of Kapi Cheste was made during the launch of Jai Maruthi 800 and in the presence of Shivarajkumar, who apparently expressed his desire to make a cameo appearance. How Harsha will rope in Shivarajkumar is something interesting to know about for which we need to wait till Harsha divulges a few details. As told by the director,"
