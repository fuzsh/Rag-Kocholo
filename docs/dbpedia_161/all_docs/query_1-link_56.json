        "text": "Wholesome blockbuster entertainer. A movie that paved the way for yash for the ultimate star Power. The chemistry between yash and kriti is beautiful. Neat screenplay, awesome songs, good humor, great characters and a perfect Rom-com that has aged pretty well. Plot might get bit over the top as it touches the end but the overall narration and charisma of the lead pair is enough for a fun ride. Loved it back then, still love it even to this day.\n\nWatching it after 9 and a half years. This has aged well. Yash before KGF was such a vibe. Music also too good and ofcourse the performances of the leads are so entertaining. Those expression changes and voice modulations too..\n\nLooks so eye pleasing to see Yash in Heart warming role ( After all KGF storm he has given to us in past few weeks ) . along with Kirthi . Film had its moments and cute mixups here and there . But felt slightly could've concentrated more on conflict BW lovers and better character sketch for Krithi .\n\n(3.25/5)"
