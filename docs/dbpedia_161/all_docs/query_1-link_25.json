        "text": "Darshan questioned why people expect only certain celebrities to talk about the Cauvery issue when distributors are making money by running Tamil films in Karnataka are spared.\n\nBengaluru: Kannada actor Darshan Thoogudeepa spoke about the ongoing Cauvery issue between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu and questioned people why they expect only certain celebrities to talk about the Cauvery issue when many were making profits by running Tamil movies in the state. He spoke at a farmers’ event in T Narasipur in Mysuru and said a distributor from Sandalwood made over Rs 30 crore profit by distributing a Tamil film in the state.\n\n“For the past few days there have been claims that celebrities are not supporting the Cauvery issue. Recently a Tamil movie was released. A distributor bought film rights for Rs 6 crore and earned Rs 37 crore. Did Tamil people watch it? That was earned in Karnataka. Why don’t people question him about why he is not talking about the issue? Only Darshan, Sudeep, Shivaraj Kumar, Yash, Abhi, and others are visible to people. Why can’t people who made profits from Karnataka speak about the issue?” Darshan said at the event.\n\nDarshan did not mention the film’s name or the distributor, but it was clear that he was talking about the recent Tamil hit Jailer in which superstar Rajinikanth played a lead role. Jayanna Combines distributed Jailer’s Kannada dubbed version in Karnataka. The film earned over Rs 52 crore from both Tamil and Kannada versions in just 9 days after its release, according to a film trade analysis report.\n\nAlso read: Cauvery water row: Karnataka bandh likely on September 29, strike in Bengaluru on Tuesday\n\nCauvery issue intensified in the state because of water shortage. Pro-Kannada and Karnataka outfits have called for Bengaluru bandh on Tuesday. Transport, hotel, and other services are likely to be affected on Tuesday because of the bandh. Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA) recently ordered the state to release 5,000 cusecs water to Tamil Nadu. Protests erupted in the state after the Supreme Court refused to interfere with the CWMA’s order."
