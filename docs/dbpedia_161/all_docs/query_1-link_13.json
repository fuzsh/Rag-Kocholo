        "text": "The title of a film starring Dr Rajkumar’s grandson, Dheeran Ramkumar, has been changed following appeal from fans of the thespian. The film, directed by Anil Kumar for Jayanna Combines, was called Daari Tappida Maga . However, the makers changed it to Shiva-143 keeping in mind the sentiments of die-hard fans of the matinee idol.\n\nDaari Tappida Maga was a blockbuster released in 1975. The film had Rajkumar in a double role — as an absent-minded professor and a thief. The film also starred Kalpana, Manjula, Arathi, Jayamala, MV Rajamma, KS Ashwath, Vajramuni and Toogudeepa Srinivas in pivotal roles.\n\nThe music for the film was composed by GK Venkatesh and the film ran for over 25 weeks across Karnataka.\n\nThe film was re-released in 2018 at a single screen on Kempegowda Road and Rajkumar fans thronged to the theatre to experience one of his best performances.\n\nThe makers of Dheeran’s film felt it would be apt to use his grandfather’s film’s title for his debut. It was not meant to be. Now, the film titled Shiva 143, with Dheeran and Manvita in the lead roles is in the post-production stage.\n\nAbout the change in the film’s title, director Anil Kumar says, “We did not want to disappoint Dr Raj fans.” And Dheeran feels, “The new title is also apt as the protagonist’s name is Shiva.”\n\nMaking use of titles of popular films of yesteryears is not new in the Kannada film industry. But, representatives of Mutturaj Fans Association met Raghavendra Rajkumar, son of Rajkumar and appealed against the use of titles of the late actor’s films. Raghavendra assured them he would consider the appeal and also that he would appeal to the Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce (KFCC) against registering titles of his father’s films.\n\nDie-hard fans of Rajkumar recently also took to social media to protest against the “misusing” of the titles of his films. “Google and you can see for yourself how many new films are using his film titles,” says Param Gubbi, a Rajkumar fan. “Most of his films upheld family values, besides highlighting importance of land, language and culture. The new films with the same titles don’t eschew the same and are in a way an insult to Rajkumar films,” he adds.\n\n“My father always considered his fans as his gods and often referred to them as abhimani devarugalu . So, it is our responsibility to honour their sentiments too. I agree with their arguments and opinion,” says Raghavendra.\n\nHowever, according to a filmmaker, who does not wants to be named, “KFCC norms will not come in the way of reusing the titles of old films.”"
