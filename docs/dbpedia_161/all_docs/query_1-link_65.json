        "text": "Over the years, director Duniya Suri has managed to extract great performances from actors and in turn, help them in finding their exact mojo. If Duniya saw actors Vijay and Yogesh deliver superb performances and become popular overnight, a film like Tagaru granted Dhananjaya and Vasishta N. Simha their much-deserved fame. Soon after, Dhananjaya would go on to become a successful leading man in his own right and a film that enunciated this Duniya Suri's own directorial, Popcorn Monkey Tiger.\n\nSimilarly, one expects the upcoming Bad Manners to turn things around for Abishek Ambareesh and give him the launchpad that he truly requires. And it looks like Suri is continuing the trend of banking on up-and-rising stars and turning them into credible actors.\n\nAccording to the latest updates, Suri is all set to collaborate with Kiss actor Viraat for his next. The collaboration also includes reputed producers Jayanna and Bhogendra who will be working with the maverick director for the very first time in their long career, although Suri shares (in the same report) that his association with the producer-duo goes back a long time.\n\nViraat is currently working Jayanna Combines on Dinakar Thoogudeepa's Royal, which is reportedly in the last leg of its shoot.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nSanjana Anand bags Dinakar Thoogudeepa’s film opposite Viraat\n\nSpeaking about Viraat, Suri added that he liked the ‘fire’ that the young actor carries and that their collaboration will be a pucca mass entertainer. The Kiss actor, too, is super kicked about the prospects considering that he has idolized the filmmaker for a long time. The untitled collaboration is set to take off post the release of Bad Manners.\n\nTeam Bad Manners released the first single on March 22 (Ugadi) and attracted a positive response from fans. The retro-themed song composed by Charan Raj features the iconic Usha Uthup’s voice and a funk, groovy vibe that the fans have come to love."
