Los Angeles Film School\n\nA top-ranking school for film studies. Although the school offers only associate and bachelor degrees in Film, Animation one would recommend the following courses which would broaden the vision: Entertainment Business, Audio Production, Music Production in addition to the programs offered in their Hollywood campus, the school offers online programs in, Entertainment Business, and Music Production, besides other standard courses like graphic design animation etc\n\n4. Vancouver Film School\n\nLocated in Vancouver, Canada, Vancouver Film School or VFS is a leading school for entertainment arts.

Tuition fee can range from 2000 to 6000 Euro per semester for Masters studies. The school also offers various part-time programs and Ph.D. studies in film, television and theatre specializations. As a foreign student without Polish language knowledge, you have to join a Polish language class since the language of instruction is entirely Polish.\n\nFor those students wanting to enhance their skills in India ONLY the following are the reputable Film Varsities in India.\n\nThere are many more film schools than those listed below, but they are not recommended at present. However education is a dynamic field and many institutions can come up with time\n\n1. Film and Television Institute of India (FTII), Pune.\n\nSince I have taught here, I also know first hand that the quality of learning is experentially the best. National Film Archives is just next door and they have some kind of collaboration with FTII. Students have access to India’s largest video archives here. Established in 1960 by the Government of India, the institution has its campus on the erstwhile premises of the Prabhat Film Company in Pune. The FTII offers 11 post graduate diploma programmes across a number of specializations in both film and television. One would recommend Screen Writing for Film TV & Web Series, which is probably the best in India. Also Cinematography would give access to students professional equipment\n\n2. Satyajit Ray Films and Television Institute, Kolkata\n\nSRFTI is a Sister Institution of FTII. In fact FTII faculty keep visiting that institution as Visiting or Guest Faculty. So their Film Making Courses are identical and are recommended as highly as FTII. However EDM is one area where they have adopted Leading Edge Technology. Films, in 2016 faced a decline in its two main market segments – domestic theatricals and cable & satellite rights. However, digital ‘versioning’ has emerged as a new vertical. Home video saw a decline too. With the above scenario in mind, it is a boon to get trained in Electronic and Digital Media at SRFTI, where hands-on training using state of the art equipment will strengthen the creative process of potential content creators of the future. They have many courses where our Design Graduates will be able to get industry connect if the do PG there\n\nI would recommend Electronic & Digital Media Management course there because not many institutions are offering courses in this.\n\n3. L V Prasad Film and TV Academy, Chennai\n\nThis was a great Institution in the yester years, but after its very famous lab closed and with the departure of Hariharan Krishna the energy of the institution has ebbed a little.\n\n4. National Institute of Design, Ahemdabad.\n\n5. AJK, Mass Communication Research Centre, New Delhi\n\nHere too I have taught. It was a very good institution for Documentary films, but now it has got into a phase of uncertainity\n\n6. Whistling Woods International, Mumbai.\n\nVery Expensive. However, advantage of doing PGD here is that it is in Mumbai and has a direct connect with Film Industry.\n\n7. Department of Media Studies, Christ University\n\n8. Symbiosis Institute of Media and Communication.\n\nIt’s more of a communication institution useful if a student wants to join a Media House"
