        "text": "With a well established name as distributor of over 125 films Jayanna of 'Jayanna Combines' with Bogendra is very confident of his 5th film production 'Drama' success. This time he is not selling the film to other colleagues. He is distributing the expensive film of his career on own.\n\n'Drama' is a big venture in the form of locations, shifting of it is very great task, the expenditure per day, the Okkuta members expenses, technical expenses, artists and raw stock make it a big one for 'Drama' says Jayanna happily.\n\nJayanna normally not available for the media to speak was addressing the a group of media persons at Sun Castle resort that is placed opposite to Kinara beach of Koteshwara near Kundapura taluk of Dakshin Kannada.\n\nAccording to Jayanna the prominent actors of Kannada cinema should join together to explain the significance of the films they do and keep good rapport with the audience. That would help the producers and marketing of films in the presence of major languages would be easy. The people friendly would help get the audience to the theatres he emphasizes. The recent verdict via CCI, KFCC not caring on the release of other languages is a big worry for Kannada film collections. Out of 30 districts in Karnataka 12 districts do not take up Kannada films when non Kannada films appear.\n\nMy previous production 'Jaanu' is very good in all respects. I got the highest profits from it. I got Rs.1.80 crore from TV rights for 'Drama' already. Udaya TV had already given me advance.\n\nAccording to Jayanna the low budget, medium and high budget films should release according to his strength in number of theatres."
