The research investigates the efficacy of these techniques in improving speech quality and intelligibility under various noisy conditions, such as babble, drilling, horn, train, and traffic noises, across different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels. Additionally, the study evaluates the performance of recurrent neural network (RNN) algorithms alongside traditional SE approaches. The study highlights the advantages of employing DCT in the modulation domain over the traditional discrete Fourier transform (DFT) in SE applications. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in objective quality metrics, including Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ), composite measures, and short-time objective intelligibility (STOI), when implementing SE algorithms using discrete cosine transform in modulation domain. The proposed hybrid speech enhancement techniques, leveraging minimum mean square error and Kalman filter in combination with discrete cosine transform in modulation domain, outperform individual speech enhancement algorithms, showcasing superior noise reduction capabilities. This paper contributes to the advancement of speech enhancement methodologies, particularly in real-world noisy environments, and underscores the effectiveness of discrete cosine transform-based approaches in enhancing speech quality and intelligibility.\n\nAdvancements in Handwriting Recognition: Deep Learning Techniques Applied to Kannada Language\n\nMay 2024\n\n·\n\n6 Reads\n\nH.

Firstly, we introduce a time delay neural network (TDNN) based modeling technique. Secondly, to properly train the models, we increase the size of the database by collecting the Kannada speech data from an additional 500 farmers under real-time conditions. The proposed combined enhancement technique effectively removes background noise and improves speech quality. When evaluated on the updated degraded speech corpus, our proposed automatic speech recognition (ASR) system achieves better performance compared to previous framework. Moreover, experimental results demonstrate an improvement of 1.32% and 1.48% in terms of speech recognition accuracy for noisy and enhanced speech data respectively, compared to our earlier work.\n\nEnhancements in encoded noisy speech data by background noise reduction\n\nSeptember 2023\n\n·\n\n11 Reads\n\n·\n\n2 Citations\n\nIntelligent Systems with Applications\n\nThimmaraja Yadava\n\n·\n\nNagaraja B G\n\n·\n\nH.S.

S. Jayanna\n\nThe enhancements made to an earlier continuous Kannada automatic speech recognition (ASR) spoken query system (SQS) under real-time environment are demonstrated in this work. The earlier SQS was corrupted by various types of degradation, leading to significantly less accurate speech recognition. In the advanced SQS, the proposed background noise suppression block is introduced before the speech feature extraction part. The experimental results show that the proposed noise reduction algorithm has given better performance in terms of audibility and intelligibility of speech sound compared to conventional spectral subtraction and magnitude squared spectrum estimators. Therefore, the proposed noise elimination algorithm is applied to the corrupted continuous Kannada speech data for its background noise removal. Using a combination of noise reduction and time delay neural network (TDNN) acoustic modeling techniques, there is a 1.87% improvement in terms of word error rate (WER) compared to the earlier SQS. The online testing statistics of the newly developed continuous Kannada ASR system by 500 speakers under real-time conditions are also demonstrated in this work. The algorithms source code and ASR models are made publicly available at https://sites.google.com/view/thimmarajayadavag/downloads.\n\n+1\n\nAn end-to-end continuous Kannada ASR system under uncontrolled environment\n\nJune 2023\n\n·\n\n64 Reads\n\n·\n\n4 Citations\n\nMultimedia Tools and Applications\n\nThimmaraja Yadava\n\n·\n\nNagaraja B G\n\n·\n\nH. S. Jayanna\n\nAchieving better speech recognition accuracy under real-time conditions is still a challenging task, and many researchers are striving to improve accuracy. In this paper, we developed a system for recognizing continuous Kannada speech sentences under real-time conditions. To develop the automatic speech recognition (ASR) models, we used task-specific continuous Kannada speech data gathered from speakers/farmers in real-time conditions. We designed an interactive voice response system (IVRS) and collected 40 continuous Kannada speech sentences. We transcribed, validated, and extracted speech features using the Mel frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) technique. We used 90% and 10% of validated continuous Kannada speech data for Kaldi system training and decoding, respectively, at different phoneme levels. The experimental results revealed that the time delay neural networks (TDNN) based ASR models outperformed ASR models of other acoustic modelling techniques and the earlier developed deep neural networks (DNN)-hidden Markov model (HMM) based continuous Kannada ASR (CKASR) system. The least word error rate (WER) ASR models are used in developing the real-time end-to-end (E2E) CKASR system. We verified the developed E2ECKASR system by testing it with 550 speakers/farmers under real-time conditions.\n\nImprovements in ASR system to access the real-time agricultural commodity prices and weather information in Kannada language/dialects\n\nMay 2023\n\n·\n\n125 Reads\n\nMultimedia Tools and Applications\n\nThimmaraja Yadava G\n\n·\n\nNagaraja B G\n\n·\n\nJayanna H S\n\nThis research work showcases advancements in an isolated Kannada automatic speech recognition (ASR) system designed for accessing agricultural commodity prices and weather information in uncontrolled environments. The system includes an interactive voice response system (IVRS), models of ASR, and databases of weather and agricultural commodity prices information. However, the previous system suffered from reduced accuracy due to the presence of various background noises during offline and online speech recognition. To address this issue, the proposed system includes a background noise reduction module that is introduced before the part of speech feature extraction. The investigation results indicate that the proposed noise reduction algorithm outperforms traditional signal processing algorithms, resulting in no audibility of musical and other background noises in the enhanced NOIZEUS speech corpora and isolated Kannada speech data. The use of this noise suppression algorithm and time delay neural network (TDNN) ASR modeling technique in the system results in a 1.1% improvement in speech recognition accuracy compared to the previous deep neural network - hidden Markov model (DNN-HMM) based system. The enhanced isolated Kannada system was tested online by 500 speakers/users for accessing real-time agricultural commodity prices and weather information in Kannada language/dialects under corrupted environments. The algorithms source code and ASR models are made publicly available."
