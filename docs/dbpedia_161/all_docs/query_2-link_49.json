Lyca Productions\n\nEstablishment of Lyca Productions\n\nLyca Productions is an Indian entertainment company, which was established by Subaskaran Allirajah in 2014. A subgroup of Lycamobile, the production studio has been involved in the production and distribution of Tamil films made in India.\n\nSuccess of Lyca Productions\n\nFrom Kaththi (2014) to producing 2.0 (2018), Lyca productions became a path breaking production house in South India, also in the Country. Meanwhile, 2.0, in Tamil became the biggest budget film of Indian Cinema.\n\nFailure of Lyca Productions\n\nYaman, Diya, Darbar and Vada Chennai are some of the films which could have done well, though these are not really failures. Their first film, Kaththi, had met with massive protests during release, otherwise it could have fared even better.\n\nFuture of Lyca Productions\n\nThey have a huge Tamil-Hindi filmography for 2021-22. The upcoming films are Panni Kutty, Raangi, Don, Good Luck Jerry, Ponniyin Selvan and Ram Setu. Looking at the slate, we can say that Lyca has a really long way to go and produce many such massive projects.\n\n2. Arka Media Works\n\nEstablishment of Arka Media Works\n\nArka Media Works is an Indian film production and trans-media company based out of Hyderabad, known for their works in Television and Telugu cinema. Founded in 2001 by Shobu Yarlagadda, and Prasad Devineni.\n\nSuccess of Arka Media Works\n\nArka Mediaworks has produced several successful television shows across languages and channels. They are involved in creating content in Kannada, Telugu, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi and Oriya. With production centres in Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Bhubaneshwar, they are among the largest television content producers in India.\n\nSince inception in 2001, they have prospered significantly by remaining fiercely loyal to their core objective – to constantly and consistently push the boundaries of commercial cinema.\n\nMeanwhile, they are also the proud producers of the country’s best cinematic brilliant epics Baahubali: The Beginning & Baahubali 2: The Conclusion.\n\nFailure of Arka Media Works\n\nFilms like Vedam, Panjaa, Maryada Ramanna etc were not box office duds. But these films could have done much better, if they had a better release timing.\n\nFuture of Arka Media Works\n\nWith online giants like Amazon Prime, Netflix etc they are interested to bankroll some web series which costs a huge sum. Not stopping there, Arka Media Works would like to bankroll international projects for the same online platforms in the upcoming months.\n\n3. Sun Pictures\n\nEstablishment of Sun Pictures\n\nSun Pictures is an Indian film distribution and production studio based in Chennai, India. It is a unit of Sun TV Network, a part of the Sun Group. Founded in 2000, it started producing the TV film Siragugal and later it started producing and distributing Tamil-language films.\n\nSuccess of Sun Pictures\n\nKadhalil Vizhunden, Dindigul Saarathy, Thenavattu, Outlander, Padikathavan, Thee, Ayan, Masilamani, Ninaithale Innikum, Kanden Kadhalai, Vettaikaran, Theeratha Vilayattu Pillai, Sura, Singam, Thillalangadi, Enthiran, Aadukalam, Mappillai, Engeyum Kaadhal, Mankatha and Vedi all of which are their success stories .\n\nFailure of Sun Pictures\n\nAfter Enthiran which was a bumper hit, Sarkar and Petta were not as big Hits. But they were very good films. All film studios in India have their share of hits and flops, even Sun pictures.\n\nFuture of Sun Pictures\n\nAnnaatthe, Suriya 40 and Thalapathy 65 are the upcoming films of Sun Pictures. Looks like they are all set to hugely entertain the South Indian audiences with their amazing stories.\n\n4. Aascar Films\n\nEstablishment of Aascar Films\n\nV. Ravichandran, is an Indian film producer and distributor in Chennai, India. He is the founder and owner of the production and distribution company, Aascar Films Pvt. Ltd.\n\nRavichandran started his venture in 1998 with the co-production of Kadhalukku Mariyadhai. He went on to produce many large-scale Tamil language films and distribute a number of English films across South India.\n\nSuccess of Aascar Films\n\nAascar Films is known for the variety it provides, from small budget movies to the big budget ones, such as “Dasavatharam”. The company believes in taking up challenging projects and has excelled at them, as it has at churning out big hits with popular film stars.\n\nIn 2012, Ravichandran and director Shankar began work on the romantic thriller film, I (2015), featuring Vikram in the lead role. En route to becoming one of the most expensive Tamil films of all time, I took three years to complete, with over ten thousand people involved in the making of the film. The team also subsequently held a grand audio launch event with Arnold Schwarzenegger being brought in as chief guest for the event, and I released shortly after, becoming a super profitable venture.\n\nFailure of Aascar Films\n\nVishwaroopam II and Bhooloham were declared as box office failures.\n\nActually these are not disasters but they failed to make as much money at the box office as they cost to produce and release.\n\nFuture of Aascar Films\n\nThey have not declared anything yet to be released but knowing their business minds and vision, they can easily come back with a bang with a few projects for digital and for release.\n\n5.

Danayya in 1993, who is a prolific Indian film producer working in Telugu cinema.\n\nSuccess of DVV Entertainments\n\nThe studio’s first project was the fantasy film Jamba Lakidi Pamba (1993).\n\nThe most successful films from the production house are Bharat Ane Nenu, Bruce Lee and Naayak. These films kinda redefined south indian cinema.\n\nMost of the studio’s films are also critically acclaimed, which signifies the fact that quality is something the studio has been consistently maintaining.\n\nFailure of DVV Entertainments\n\nVarudu, Julayi, Cameraman Ganga Tho Rambabu, Ninnu Kori and Vinaya Vidheya Rama were all good stories with big stars but somehow these could not be translated properly on screen leading to an average response at the boxoffice.\n\nFuture of DVV Entertainments\n\nThe future is already brighter than ever for the production house. Digital rights of their upcoming film RRR has been sold for a whopping Rs 325 crore.\n\nWith this exorbitant deal, RRR has now become the first movie to fetch such a huge amount of money ahead of its release.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nEven during the pandemic, when many businesses remained closed, the entertainment business continued to stay up and running. The major production houses of South India (the ones mentioned above ) took the opportunity to engage and entertain billions of Indians through runs and re-reruns of their content on television, Tells Hirav Shah.\n\nCinema, Movies & Magic have always been closely associated. If entertaining people during today’s trying times is not “magic”, then what is !!\n\nWho Is Hirav Shah\n\nHirav Shah is the man whose advice and consultation have shaken up the movie culture in year 2020-2021.\n\nHirav’s Astro-Strategy has shown to the world that light was indeed there, at the end of the tunnel.\n\nMeanwhile, Hirav has helped “turn around” the businesses of numerous film studios in India and abroad. And, that is the reason Hirav Shah has become film industry’s favourite Astro-Strategist.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhich is the biggest film industry in South India?\n\nBy 2021, Telugu cinema had emerged as the largest film industry in terms of box-office of South India.\n\nWhich is the biggest production house in Tamil Nadu?\n\nLyca Productions, Arka Media Works, and Sun Pictures are the biggest productions houses in Tamil Nadu.\n\nWho is the best film producer in south India?\n\nArka Media Works\n\nWho is the No 1 director in South India?\n\nS S Rajamouli\n\nWho is the best director in South India?\n\nS Shekhar and S S Rajamouli both are the best directors in South India"
