        "text": "Sriimurali is happy about the success of his latest released film Mufti, which is ruling the box office now, and he now has another reason to rejoice. The actor will be working with Jayanna Combines (producers Jayanna and Bogendra) again for his next project, work on which will start early 2018. He says, “With Mufti, we have become a hit combination. We hope the success of this movie spills over to the next.” The film had also featured Shivarajkumar in a pivotal role.\n\nSince Sriimurali’s work with new directors is seeing great returns, the industry watchers are curious if his next movie’s director too will be a debutant. The actor says, “Considering the way the audience have received Mufti, I am now careful about choosing my next script. I currently have two bound scripts in my hand and directors are also in place. I need another few days to make a decision.”\n\nMeanwhile, our source tells us that Sriim rali has already planned his films for 2018 and producers want to announce the pro ects on his birthday, which he celebrates on December 17"
