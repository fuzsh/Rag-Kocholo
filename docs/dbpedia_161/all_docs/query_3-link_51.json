The girls filled ten bags full of leaves, twigs, and other debris left in the retirees' yards. The couples they helped were very appreciative that they wouldn't have to go out in the cold and rake up their yards themselves. “I was shocked by how many retired people felt like they had to do all their yard work on their own, so helping them clean up their yards gave me a way to give back.” Sponsor: Delanet Staats, Teacher.\n\nTimJ., 5th year member\n\nProject: The Joy of Christmas - Tim and his National Honor Society peers collected more than 100 toys to benefit children in the Marine Toys for Tots program.

The children received all they wanted and more. “I learned that leadership requires selfless service. I also learned that leadership means working together for a single purpose including working through any challenge or disagreement.

In total, James collected 331 new toys to benefit hearing impaired children assisted by the Texas Hearing Institute. The students and faculty of the Texas Hearing Institute were overwhelmed with joy to receive so many toys that would benefit the children around the holiday season. “What I learned with this service project is that leadership consists of many things, for example, being able to successfully plan, implement, and execute the plan. However, it is equally important to have the ability to seek the help of others to achieve a common goal that will positively impact not only the community but others as well.” Sponsor: ChristinaCavaliere, Assistant Principal.\n\nLoganM., 2nd year member\n\nProject: Books From Kids For Kids - Logan enlisted the help of students and staff at three schools to gather 3,781 new and gently used books to donate to Books Between Kids, an organization that gives books to kids in the Houston area.

The holiday season can be very stressful for those struggling to meet their basic needs and the provision of personal care items may help those in need with improving their ability to be more self-sufficient while also improving their outlook on life during the holiday season and beyond. The success of the project over the holidays sparked a second hygiene drive in the Spring semester. “The overwhelming support of the Coronado High School Band and Key Club reminded me that possibilities are endless through acts of service and kindness as a leader and motivated me to continue to serve the community in a second hygiene drive in the Spring semester.” Sponsor: MaggieEnsley, Teacher/Coach.\n\nOliviaZ., 9th grader, Clements High School, 1st year member\n\nProject: Books4Good - Olivia and Lana organized and executed a book drive called Books4Good, and recruited a student from Dulles High School to help sort the donated books.

This project impacted students in the Fort Bend ISD community by raising the availability of books within Fort Bend ISD to enrich the minds of many more young readers. “I have learned that true growth and development come not only from our successes, but also from our failures.

Making donations to the homeless, survivors of domestic abuse, and refugees has taught the group that even the smallest act of kindness can make a significant impact on someone's life. “When I started my service project, it became clear to me that effective leadership involves more than just taking command and assigning tasks—it also involves listening to, appreciating, and encouraging people around you.
