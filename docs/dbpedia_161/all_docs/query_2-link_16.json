Remakes are desirable, given that the film is socially relevant and rejects toxic masculinity through the insightful, sensitive portrayal of its male leads. The Kannada remake, Monsoon Raaga, directed by S Ravindranath brings to life four tales of romance, amid evolving attitudes on relationships, gender and religion. Forty-nine-year-old Raju (Achyuth Kumar), a single man, cannot claim to be content with his marital status. Things seem to never work out for him and he often faces pressure from his peers to get married. He slowly, reluctantly falls in love with his 42-year-old work supervisor Haasini (Suhasini Maniratnam), who asks him to marry her. Schoolboy Sundara wears a pink shirt to school to impress his crush, Suchitra, but ends...\n\nSandalwoodWith the film industry getting back on its feet after the pandemic, here’s a tentative list of Sandalwood films release dates.

Shraddha Srinath was roped in to play the female lead in it and Mayuri is appearing as Shiva Rajkumar’s sister. A romantic action entertainer, Rustum has Anoop Seelin scoring the music and Mahendra Simha wielding the camera. Shiva Rajkumar plays a cop in this flick and he sports a new look in it.\n\nSandalwoodThe film reminds one of many other cop films but Shivanna fans are likely to be pleased by his \"mass\" role. Aravind ShwethaAfter a short sabbatical, superstar Dr Shivarajkumar is back in a \"mass\" role as a cop. The audience has always loved Shivanna more as an upright, merciless cop than a machete-wielding underworld don, especially after delivering hits like Killing Veerappan, Mufti and Tagaru. With Rustum, Shivanna has gone one step ahead to entertain the audience in multiple avatars. Always known for sporting clean-shaven looks, in Rustum, he gets a sharp moustache just like his father, the legendary thespian late Dr Rajkumar, and this reminds us a lot of the matinee idol in a few frames. There’s plenty of action, sentiment, a small layer of friendship, revenge and drama. Along the way, there’s plenty of machismo on display. The movie opens with the murder of an Ias officer.\n\nSandalwoodThe actor will be the first among Sandalwood stars to enter the digital media platform.Digital NativeKannada superstar Shiva Rajkumar will be the first among Sandalwood stars to enter the digital media platform.
