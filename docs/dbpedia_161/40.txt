Puneeth Rajkumar lashed out at distributor Prasad recently for his statement that Dr. Rajkumar's family production banners Poornima Enterprises and Varajeshwari Combines are not producing quality films and spoiling the Sandalwood industry. The actor said that the distributor doesn't have enough experience to talk about the production house. The star also said that Sandalwood people will know about what his family members have contributed to the Kannada film industry. The actor added that he is not interested to comment much on the distributor, who is new to the field. It may be recalled that Prasad, who was expected to acquire the distribution rights of Puneethâ€™s Anna Bond, cancelled his deal and alleged that the film had a poor storyline. Jayanna acquired the distribution rights later. Anna Bond, which was released on May 1, is still running successfully in all the theatres across Karnataka.
