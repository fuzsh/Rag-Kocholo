Director Dani Levy received the Ernst Lubitsch prize in February

A Jewish comedy that has performed well at the German box office is now tipped to receive the most nominations at the country's equivalent of the Oscars.

Alles auf Zucker! (Go For Zucker) has made 4.2m euros (Â£2.8m) at cinemas and is now short listed in 10 categories at this year's German Film Awards.

Final nominations will be announced on Monday ahead of the 8 July ceremony.

The comedy follows a hard-up Jew as he tries to convince his Orthodox brother that he is, in fact, kosher.

"I had my doubts about whether Germans would go to a Jewish comedy," director Dani Levy said.

"It's a major miracle that so many are seeing it.

"Germans have come up to me and said how relieved they felt to see a movie about Jews and be able to laugh."

Produced in just 23 days as a TV film, Alles auf Zucker! received a cinematic release in Germany following a positive response at test screenings.

The film - which won the Ernst Lubitsch award for best German comedy earlier this year - has also been sold in more than 10 other countries.

The Bundesfilmpreis, or Lola, is the main national film award in Germany.

Last year's event was dominated by Gegen die Wand (Head On), which won five awards including best film.
