        "text": "BERLIN, March 3 - It has been a while since Germans last laughed openly at a Jewish joke, especially one that pokes fun at Jews themselves. Sixty years after the Holocaust, most Germans still feel too guilty or insecure to address any Jewish matter in a lighthearted manner. But now a new movie is encouraging them to get rid of their postwar anxieties and join in for a good laugh.\n\nMixing slapstick humor and political incorrectness, \"Alles auf Zucker!,\" or \"Go for Zucker!,\" said to be the first German-Jewish comedy since World War II, has attracted huge audiences all over Germany. Its success suggests that humor could be an unconventional form of therapy for the strained relations between Jews and gentiles in Germany.\n\nThe movie, directed by Dani Levy, a German Jew who grew up in Switzerland, is a lively family comedy about a notorious East German gambler, who long ago distanced himself from his Jewish roots, and his Orthodox brother, who escaped to West Germany before the Berlin Wall was built.\n\nThe estranged brothers and their families meet for the first time in 40 years at their mother's funeral in Berlin. By the terms of her will they can inherit the family fortune only if they reconcile and mourn in the traditional Jewish way, by sitting shiva for seven days. The inevitable clash of secularism versus traditional religion paves the way for 90 minutes of quarrels, revealed family secrets and, eventually, a happy ending.\n\nSince its opening on Jan. 6, more than 570,000 people have seen \"Alles auf Zucker!,\" only the second ethnic film to become a box-office hit in Germany. The first, \"Head-On,\" Fatih Akin's love story about a Turkish immigrant couple, was seen by 750,000 Germans last year and won the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival in 2004. Only a few weeks after its release, \"Alles auf Zucker!\" was awarded the Ernst Lubitsch Prize for best German comedy by the Club of Berlin Film Journalists. \"Levy's wonderfully incorrect comedy, which has been cast perfectly, makes fun both of itself and of Jewish life today,\" the German newspaper Die Welt wrote. \"Mr. Levy portrays human neuroses and German-Jewish relations in a relaxed manner without being afraid to touch a taboo.\"\n\nThe weekly magazine Der Spiegel commented: \"The audience is not laughing at the Jews but together with them. This is definitely a step in the right direction.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
