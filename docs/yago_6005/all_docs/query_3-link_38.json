Sonya (b. 1970) received her MA in European Media Studies from the University of Portsmouth/UK. Her work focuses on children, war and trauma. After periods in Belgium and the US she is now based in Dresden/Germany and her native Finland. Sonya reported on major news events such as the aftermath of the war in Bosnia, the 2005 Kashmir earthquake, Hurricane Katrina and the resettlement of refugees and IDPs to villages across Afghanistan. Sonya is the author of several books on the situation of children in times of war. In the past she collaborated among others with Dutch photographer Claudia Heinermann.

Sonya’s books have been translated into Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Czech and Turkish. More recently Sonya has started to shift some of her work to documentary filmmaking.
