        "text": "Basel-born director Dani Levy says he is preparing for a \"tidal wave of criticism\" of his latest film, the first German comedy about Adolf Hitler.\n\nOnly a third of Germans think “Mein Führer: die wirklich wahrste Wahrheit über Adolf Hitler” (Mein Führer: The Truly Truest Truth about Adolf Hitler”) is a good idea, according to a recent survey.\n\nThe film, which treads ground that until recently would have been off-limits, features a demoralised, drug-addled, impotent and incontinent Hitler who plays with a toy battleship in the bath, dresses his dog in Nazi uniform and takes acting tips from a Jewish concentration camp inmate.\n\n“I’m aware we’re in a glasshouse that’s been built on a mass grave,” said 49-year-old Levy, who now lives in Berlin, where Mein Führer was filmed.\n\nUnfortunately, early reviews suggest that Levy, himself Jewish, was worried that too much laughter would shatter the glasshouse windows.\n\nMein Führer follows the Oscar-nominated Der Untergang (The Downfall), which in 2004 broke ground by portraying Hitler from a German perspective, with Swiss actor Bruno Ganz giving a controversially intimate and human portrait of Hitler’s final days.\n\nLevy mocked Der Untergang and other recent portrayals of the Nazi era, saying they aimed to put Hitler on a pedestal. Instead, he says his film is “something small, fast, cheeky and politically incorrect”.\n\n“I don’t want to give this cynical, psychological wreck of a person the honour of a realistic portrayal,” he said. “I had the feeling that I must do it with another genre, do it by being able to exaggerate through comedy.”\n\nFarce\n\nLevy’s film starts in December 1944, with Berlin in ruins and Hitler too depressed to deliver a much-awaited speech to rally his people. His propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels, finds a solution in Adolf Grünbaum, a fictional Jewish actor who coached Hitler at the beginning of his career and is now in a concentration camp.\n\nGrünbaum uses the mission to try to kill Hitler, but fails. So he puts him through humiliating exercises such as crawling around and barking like a dog.\n\nAll this would have been unthinkable a decade ago, said Paul Nolte, a professor of contemporary history at Berlin’s Free University.\n\nIn addition, the gradual dwindling of the Nazi-era generation – more than 80 per cent of Germans today were born after 1941 – has given the country a more detached view of its past.\n\nRewrite"
