        "text": "“It's Complicated: Britain, the EU, and their Relationship Status” with Professor Siegfried Weichlein\n\nMarch 9, 2016\n\nWhy is Brexit so popular with the British electorate lately? Why did Prime Minister David Cameron call for a referendum on the future of Britain in the EU? Who will probably win the referendum: proponents or opponents of Brexit? Can a Brexit be achieved at all, and is it a possible outcome given the millions of ties between Britain and the EU?\n\nSiegfried Weichlein, Professor of Contemporary European History at the University of Fribourg, Switzerland, presented us with an overarching context and history of the British political sphere, shedding light on the origins of the coming referendum. Ultimately, the UK is bound to the European continent by thousands of agreements which can't be renegotiated overnight, and would have to be abided by regardless of EU membership if the UK wants access to the European market. Professor Weichlein argued that leaving the EU would give the UK less influence over policy decisions made in Brussels, and would thereby do more harm than good for the British political position.\n\n“How Germany Fell Out of Love with Russia” with Dr. Joerg Forbrig\n\nJanuary 25, 2016\n\nIn the wake of the terror attacks in Paris, Germany, the United States and France are seeking ways to confront the expanding threat of ISIS. Dealing with the root causes of conflict in Syria is one of the key elements in finding a solution. This will involve discussions with Russia.\n\nWill Europe succeed in having a unified policy towards Russia? What role will Germany play in shaping this policy? What is the proper stance towards Russia in light of the situation in the Ukraine?\n\nMore than any other western country, Germany has spent the last quarter of a century working to build a special relationship with Russia. Fueled by a particular mix of historical legacies, people-to-people ties, economic interests and traditions of Ostpolitik, successive Berlin governments of all colors engaged with Moscow to build a partnership. Increasingly, however, German efforts grew disillusioned, and with the Russian aggression against Ukraine, they were finally frustrated. This spells the end of German-Russian particularity, and it may well pave the way for a more realistic, and perhaps truly European, policy towards a revisionist Russia.\n\nDr. Joerg Forbrig is a transatlantic fellow for Central and Eastern Europe, and director of the Fund for Belarus Democracy. Based in GMF’s office in Berlin, he leads the organization’s efforts to assist civil society in Belarus, while his analytical and policy work focuses on Europe’s East broadly, including the new member countries of the European Union, and the EU’s Eastern neighborhood. Prior to joining GMF in 2002, Forbrig worked as a Robert Bosch Foundation fellow at the Center for International Relations in Warsaw, Poland. He has been published widely on democracy, civil society, and Central and Eastern European affairs, including the books “Reclaiming Democracy” (2007), “Prospects for Democracy in Belarus” (2006), and “Revisiting Youth Political Participation” (2005). He is also a regular contributor to major international media.\n\nForbrig has studied political science, sociology and Eastern European affairs at universities in Germany, Poland and Hungary. He holds a doctorate in social and political sciences from the European University Institute in Florence and a master’s in political science from Central European University in Budapest.\n\n“Rio… Kyoto… Copenhagen… Paris: Will We Save The Planet?”\n\nOctober 26, 2015\n\nA discussion with Hermann Ott and Charles Chester about what we should and what we should not expect from the UN Climate Summit in Paris, November 29 to December 12, 2015.\n\n2015 is on track to be the hottest year on record “by a mile,” climate scientists say. It will mean that the three warmest years since record keeping began in 1880 — 2015, 2014 and 2010 — happened in the past five years, and nine of the ten warmest years have all occurred in the 21st century.\n\nGerman government investments have helped to dramatically reduce prices for solar and wind technology, making them widely available, spurring a global renewable energy revolution. Germany, a country with neither much sunshine nor much wind, is 50% renewably powered today.\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol is about to expire, and from November 29 to December 12, UN delegations will be meeting in Paris to reach a new global agreement. Countries have made pledges in advance of the summit. Will they be sufficient? Will an agreement, if indeed one is reached, have the ‘teeth’ to achieve what needs to be done to prevent catastrophic climate change?\n\n“Germany's Response to the Current European Migration Crisis” with Bruce Leimsidor\n\nSeptember 24, 2015\n\nJust a few years ago, Germany’s reputation as an open and tolerant society was seriously put into question by the publication of an overtly xenophobic tract by a leading German political figure, forcing Ms. Merkel's well publicized statement that the German model of a multicultural society had utterly failed. There followed reports of frequent right-wing demonstrations and even acts of violence against foreigners, which have increased during the present crisis. Nevertheless, official Germany’s response to the current massive wave of immigrants in Europe from Africa, the Middle East and South Asia has been generous and way out of proportion to her population relative to the rest of the EU. Even taking into consideration Germany’s prosperity, her practically unflinching acceptance of the lion’s share of the responsibility for this culturally difficult migration seems to contradict the issues she was having in this regard just prior to the current influx, and continues to have.\n\nHow did official Germany accomplish this turnaround? To what extent was it voluntary? And what are the prospects for Germany to maintain this leadership position?\n\nBruce Leimsidor spoke to attendees about asylum law, the German intake process for refugees and more. Professor Leimsidor also spoke about what has been touted as Germany's generosity in taking in so many displaced people. He believes that accepting these people is the only practical thing that Germany could currently do.\n\nBruce Leimsidor currently teaches European asylum law at Ca’ Foscari University, Venice. He has been concurrently counselor for asylum affairs in the Venice municipality’s program for asylum seekers. Prior to his positions in Venice, he was a senior resettlement expert at UNHCR’s central resource center in Nairobi, Kenya, covering east and central Africa. He has also served as director of the US State Department’s Overseas Processing Entity (OPE) in Vienna, Austria, the central office covering US refugee admissions through Central Europe, and was the director of the Central European office of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS). He has taught at the American University, Paris; Oberlin College; Occidental College; and Indiana University. He is a graduate of Swarthmore College and holds an advanced degree from Princeton University.\n\n“In The Shadow of the Holocaust: The Forgotten Survivors” with Peter Schrag\n\nAugust 31, 2015\n\nJournalist and scholar Peter Schrag is the co-author, with his father Otto Schrag (1902-1971) of “When Europe Was a Prison Camp: Father and Son Memoirs, 1940-1941,” Indiana University Press, August 2015, which describes Otto Schrag's internment and escape from a French camp in the early years of World War II, and Peter’s own escape with his mother from Nazi occupied Europe at roughly the same time.\n\nSchrag describes his work: “It was hardly an unusual story — it was the story of half a continent, people on roadsides trying to repair their broken-down cars; people sitting on their luggage in railway stations waiting for trains that no longer ran; families in hay wains pulled by oxen, on foot carrying infants, on bicycles, the old, like my grandmother, the sick, the lame; people living with the terrible uncertainty, sometimes for years, of not knowing where their loved ones were, who to trust, which road not to take. It was not until a few years ago that my family persuaded me to look at my father’s crumbling old manuscript and then to translate it and to return to my own story, partly for the sake of family history, but maybe more importantly, to add yet one more document to the history of those terrible years. It’s a history that must not be forgotten, even as so many of us have tried so long to forget it.”\n\nAbout the author:\n\nPeter Schrag, who served for 19 years as editorial page editor of the Sacramento Bee, is a lifelong journalist. From his retirement in 1996 until 2009 he also wrote a weekly column for the Bee. He continues to write occasional pieces for the Bee and other publications. A former executive editor of Saturday Review magazine, he is the author of articles and reviews in the Atlantic, Harper’s, the Nation, the New Republic, the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, the Washington Post, Playboy, the American Prospect and other publications. His book, “Paradise Lost: California’s Experience, America’s Future,” published by the New Press in April 1998, was chosen as a New York Times Notable Book and issued as a paperback by the University of California Press in 1999. Among his other recent books are “Final Test: The Battle for Adequacy in America’s Schools,” which was published by the New Press in October 2003 and “California: America’s High-Stakes Experiment, and Not Fit for our Society: Immigration and Nativism in America” both published by the University of California Press. Peter Schrag has taught at Amherst College where he also served as a college administrator, the University of Massachusetts, the Bread Loaf Writers Conference, and at the Graduate School of Journalism and the Graduate School of Public Policy at the University of California at Berkeley. He also served on the board of EdSource, a California school policy analysis organization, and on the advisory council of the Public Policy Institute of California. In 2012 he was a consultant to the Commission on Equity and Excellence of the U.S. Department of Education. From 1998 to 2013, he was also a visiting scholar at Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies."
