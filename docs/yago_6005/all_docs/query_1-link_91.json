        "text": "Today’s Doodle celebrates the 78th birthday of German actress Renate Krößner. She rose to international fame after her role as the titular character in Solo Sunny – a groundbreaking film from East Germany that resonated with people everywhere.\n\nKrößner was born on this day in Osterode, Germany in 1945. She grew up in Berlin and performed in school theater productions. After studying acting at the Staatliche Schauspielschule Berlin, Krößner worked in East Germany theaters. While she performed smaller roles in a few television programs, Krößner was on her way to becoming a star.\n\nIn 1980, she was cast as the lead actress in Solo Sunny, an East Germany film about a band’s singer who longs to be a solo artist. Krößner’s performance as the rebellious and angst-ridden Sonny received critical acclaim around the world. She earned the Berlin International Film Festival’s Silver Bear for Best Actress—the first for an East Germany production. Her character’s attitude and fashion sense also widely influenced German youth.\n\nAfter receiving permission to leave East Germany in 1985 she moved to West Berlin, Krößner became a mainstay on television shows like Stubbe - Von Fall zu Fall and Einmal Bulle. Her role as the love interest of a Franciscan monk in the show Bruder Esel earned her a Golden Lion award. She also starred in more films, including the thriller Unbesiegbar and the comedy Alles auf Zucker.\n\nIn 1991, Krößner was a jury member at the 41st Berlin International Film Festival. She later won a Deutscher Filmpreis Best Actress award for her work in Nordkurve. Krößner continued acting into the 2000s, later moving to Brandenburg, Germany.\n\nHappy Birthday Renate Krößner, your iconic performances are immortalised on the silver screen, and are just as captivating today."
