        "text": "11/07/2005\n\nFriday night, at the Lola awards ceremony (the German Oscars) which took place at the Berlin Philarmonic, Alles auf Zucker , by Dani Levy, won six prizes, including the Golden Lola for Best Film. The 55th German Film Awards turned into a landslide for this comedy about a modern Jewish family in Berlin: it was also distinguished for its script, costumes, music, direction, and earned Henry HŸbchen a Lola as Best Actor.\n\nThe Silver Lola went to two films, The Edukators by Hans Weingartner and Sophie Scholl – The Last Days , by Mark Rothemund which also won Julia Jentsch the Best Actress award. The best actors in supporting roles are Katja Riemann in Agns und seine BrŸder , by Oskar Roehler, and Burghart Klau§ner for The Edukators, while the Best Children's Film is Lauras Stern by Piet De Rycker and Thilo Rothkirch and the Best Documentary Rhythm is it! by Thomas Grube and Enrique Sanchez Lansch.\n\nThe director Reinhard Hauff, who headed the Berlin Film and TV Academy (DFFB) for a long-time until recently, was granted a prize honoris causa for his entire career.\n\nThe winners received a total of 2.9 million euros. This year, for the first time, the jury included nearly 650 members of the Filmakademie, an innovation much criticised by directors and producers who felt excluded from the procedure. This dispute points to an obvious conflict between the artistic and more commercial approaches.\n\n(Translated from French)"
