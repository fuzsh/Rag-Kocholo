She further stated that the album was more mature in terms of the lyrics and the themes dealt with, attributing this to the fact that the band members were getting older.[2]\n\n\"Perlentaucher\" and \"Fütter deine Angst\", two songs from Zucker, reached No. 40 and No. 52, respectively, in the German singles chart.[3][4] \"Fütter deine Angst\" was part of a double single with \"Ja, ich will\", and the latter together with \"Zucker III\" were included in a re-release of Zucker as bonus songs.[5] \"Ja, ich will\" was a collaboration with German comedian Hella von Sinnen, calling for the introduction of same-sex marriage.[6]\n\nConcert tour and live album\n\n[edit]\n\nSongs from Zucker were introduced in the Rosenstolz concert tour which took place in Germany and Switzerland during May and June 1999.[2] These songs included \"Zucker II\", \"Ein anderes Gefühl von Schmerz\", \"Fütter deine Angst\" and \"Schieß mich jetzt ab\".[7] During the tour, Rosenstolz's first live album was recorded.[8] Titled Zuckerschlampen:live, the album was released in September 1999 by Polydor Records and reached No. 5 in the German albums chart.[9]\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\nAll songs were written by Peter Plate, AnNa R. and Ulf Leo Sommer, except \"Heut' Nacht\" (Manfred Praeker) and \"Ja, ich will (Hochzeitssong)\" (Plate, AnNa R. and Hella von Sinnen).\n\n\"ZuckerRoterMond\" – 4:21\n\n\"Schieß mich jetzt ab\" – 3:36\n\n\"Fütter deine Angst\" – 4:00\n\n\"Perlentaucher\" – 4:35\n\n\"Nackt (Juli)\" – 4:40\n\n\"Schlange\" – 4:04\n\n\"Nirwana\" – 4:46\n\n\"Ein anderes Gefühl von Schmerz\" – 4:47\n\n\"Heut' Nacht\" – 4:13\n\n\"Das Ende meiner Karriere\" – 4:09\n\n\"Cleopatra\" – 3:26\n\n\"Vom Wesen der Liebe\" – 4:39\n\n\"Ich und mein Prinz\" – 3:42\n\n\"Mir muss es nicht gutgeh'n\" – 4.33\n\n\"Nackt (Reprise)\" – 1:29\n\n\"Zucker II\" – 4:51\n\nBonus songs\n\n\"Ja, ich will (Hochzeitssong)\" (with Hella von Sinnen) – 4:24\n\n\"Zucker III (Remix)\" – 3:35\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
