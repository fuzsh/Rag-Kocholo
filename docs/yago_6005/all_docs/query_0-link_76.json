        "text": "Go for Zucker! [Alles auf Zucker!] (Dani Levy, Germany). The premise for this film is actually very sad: in 1961, at age 14, Jaecki Zucker had been separated from the rest of his family when the Berlin Wall went up; Jaecki stayed in East Berlin, alone, and had no contact with his mother and brother in Frankfurt, even after Germany was reunified in 1990. The comic aspect of the story is this: the mother dies, and her will provides that she is to be buried in Berlin, and Jaecki and his estranged brother, Samuel, must sit shivah together and talk through their differences or else neither will receive any inheritance. It turns into a very funny movie. At first, much of the humour comes from Jaecki and his gentile wife attempting to immerse themselves in Jewish religious practises so as to impress Samuel and secure the inheritance. But the film itself stops short of showing disrespect to Judaism, and in the second half of the film, its comedy focuses on Jaecki’s own ‘reunification’ not only with his brother, but with Marlene (Jaecki’s wife) and Jana (Jaecki’s adult daughter). All in all, this is a funny and well-crafted comedy; Henry Hübchen gives a great performance as Jaecki. 9\n\nLinks:\n\nThe user comments at IMDb make interesting reading, especially the comments from Germans.\n\nOfficial Site (Germany)\n\nOfficial Site (U.S.)\n\nreview from Bankrupt Artist v.3 blog"
