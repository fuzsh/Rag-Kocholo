(1) Both pieces approach the \"Jewish Question\" from within the comedy genre, each responding in their way to the centuries-old stereotype of the deceitful, roguish Jew in their appeals for tolerance. Notions of assimilation, \"foreignness\" and the place of Jews within a perceived or actual German nation are central to both texts. Neither Lessing's nor Levy's hero appears Jewish, each appealing in his own way to norms of Germanness. Lessing's traveller is wealthy, well-mannered and honest to a fault; Levy's Jackie Zucker is an endearing rogue, a classic reunification loser. Despite their differences, the heroes of both pieces compel non-Jewish audiences to recognise them as exemplary Germans, not foreigners to be treated with suspicion and prejudice.\n\nWhat can a one-act stage comedy written by a Saxonian Protestant in the mid-eighteenth century, and a made-for-television comedy directed by a Swiss-born Jew in the twenty-first century, have in common? The two comedies are separated by two-and-a-half centuries of revolution and nationalist struggle, the nineteenth-century emancipation of German Jews, the ascent of some Jews to positions of influence and privilege, the twentieth-century upheaval of two world wars, the horrors of Nazism, and the unification, division and reunification of Germany. For all the historical space that separates these two comedies with their Jewish heroes, however, there are numerous striking parallels which invite us to consider the two texts together. The pieces were both surprise comedy hits of their day. The Jews, written by a 21-year-old Gotthold Ephraim Lessing in 1749, was frequently performed in the 1760s and 1770s, although there is a paucity of information on its critical reception, whilst Dani Levy's Go for Zucker!, enjoyed popular and critical acclaim in equal measure when it was released as a feature film in 2005. (2)\n\nBoth pieces approach what in Lessing's day was known as the \"Jewish Question\" within the comedy genre, yet both contain an earnest appeal for tolerance and better understanding of the situation of Jews in Germany. Both are thoroughly contemporary. Lessing's play alludes directly to events such as Frederick the Great's anti-Jewish legislation, and Levy's film takes place a decade and a half after German reunification as its hero still struggles to find his feet in post-GDR Berlin. Both pieces ignited a vigorous discussion of Jewish issues-for Lessing, the question of whether Jews could be contributors to an enlightened society; for Levy, whether it was now possible to enjoy Jewish comedy sixty years after the Holocaust. Both are defined by the questions of assimilation and \"passing,\" and draw comedic and dramatic power from pre-existing notions of the Jew as inherently foreign. Both also engage with the stereotype, reaching back beyond the eighteenth-century, of the Jewish rogue earning his keep by dubious means. Where Lessing was intent on subverting this cliche, Levy creates a lovable rogue who reappropriates this trope. This article will consider these and other themes common to the two comedies, showing just how pertinent the \"Jewish Question\" of pre-emancipation times remains to German culture in the twenty-first century.\n\nLessing's The Jews\n\nThe one-act play begins the morning after an attempted robbery and murder. An unnamed traveller and his unreliable servant, Christoph, have spent the night as guests of the Baron, whom the traveller has saved from a cowardly roadside attack. The thieves, whom the Baron has assumed were Jews, due both to his existing antisemitic attitudes and to the fact the robbers wore beards, are in reality two of the Baron's employees in disguise. The Baron and his young daughter are equally impressed by the traveller, who modestly fends off their praise. The traveller comes to suspect one of the Baron's employees, Martin Krumm, of being a thief. When he sees Krumm with two fake beards, he shares his concerns with the Baron. Krumm and his accomplice, Michel Stich, confess everything to the Baron, who sees himself as twice-saved by the traveller, whom he presumes to be of noble birth. The Baron thus offers the traveller his willing daughter's hand in marriage, forcing the traveller to reveal his Jewish identity to the shock and surprise of all. Because Prussian law forbids a union between a Christian and a Jew, the Baron offers his entire fortune to the traveller. The well-off traveller refuses this offer, asking the Baron instead merely to judge the Jewish people less harshly in future. The Baron declares himself ashamed of his behaviour.\n\nWritten in 1749, The Jews was not published until 1754, whereafter it enjoyed relative popularity, being performed in the order of seventy times in the 1760s and 1770s. (3) The play was first performed in Nuremberg in 1766, a city that specifically tolerated no Jewish citizens, having expelled the Jews at the end of the fifteenth century. Yet even before the play made it to the stage, it had already become the centre of a vigorous public debate. In a review of Lessing's Schriften in which the play first appeared, the Gottingen orientalist Johann David Michaelis lamented the implausibility of the piece, which he termed a morality play (Michealis 1969:49), so unlikely was it that a character as noble as Lessing's traveller could emerge from the Jewish people. In response, Lessing quoted anonymously a letter from the then little-known philosopher Moses Mendelssohn to his friend, the Jewish doctor Aaron Emmerich Gumperz. In the letter Mendelssohn refutes Michaelis's critique, and invokes his friend Gumperz as evidence of the existence of just such a noble Jew (Mendelssohn 1969:50-52).\n\nFor many years Lessing was regarded as a kind of literary ambassador for the Jews, thanks partly to The Jews, but above all to his later work Nathan the Wise (1779). Recent German Studies scholarship has begun to reassess Lessing's literary call for tolerance of the Jews, seeing it as a limited vision of individual emancipation (Sieg 2002), as subservient to his attack on Christianity (Robertson 1998), or as a message that failed to reach its contemporary audience (Och 1992). Still, the play has its scholarly supporters, who argue it is a powerful and rare eighteenth-century appeal for acceptance of the Jews (Goetschel 2003; Guthke 2005). Certainly, if we take seriously Lessing's own words on his intentions in writing the play, we must accept it was his earnest intention to persuade his audience of the need for Jewish emancipation: \"It was the result of a very serious consideration of the shameful oppression which a people must endure, that a Christian, in my view, cannot view without a kind of deference\" (Lessing 1972b:524-525).\n\nLessing conceived his traveller as a man of such upright moral stature that audiences should be brought, like the Baron, to question their prejudices. Lessing's humanist message is that a good man, whether Christian or Jew, is rare and to be treasured. This is the message that the Baron and the traveller are able to agree upon in the penultimate scene.\n\nBaron: Oh, how estimable would the Jews be, were they all like you!\n\nTraveller: And how amiable the Christians, if they all possessed your qualities! (Lessing 1888:217).\n\nIf the Baron wishes that more Jews were as virtuous as his new friend, the traveller wishes the same of the Christians. And Lessing himself concedes in response to Michaelis: \"even if my traveller were a Christian, his character would be very rare\" (Lessing 1972a:417). The question of character is equally central to Dani Levy's film, where it receives a rather different, twenty-first-century emphasis.\n\nDani Levy's Go for Zucker!\n\nGo for Zucker! also features a Jewish protagonist who attracts the sympathy and identification of the audience. We meet Jackie Zucker as he lies in a \"traumatic coma\" looking back on the events of the previous week. Before the fall of the wall Jackie was a famous East German TV sports reporter and committed communist. Fourteen years later he is a classic reunification loser, something he ironically acknowledges when he introduces himself in a voiceover as a \"born gambler, born winner.\" Quite unlike the virtuous traveller of The Jews, the hero of Levy's Jewish comedy is a rogue, a \"gambler\" down on his luck. The film takes us back to a week before the onset of Jackie's coma. The opening credits find him playing pool in a bar and losing convincingly. Apparently drunk and off his game, Jackie puts up his Mazda 420 coupe as collateral for yet another game, and his \"luck\" suddenly turns. He plays with brassy confidence and goes to leave the pub victoriously when his opponent discovers Jackie has been drinking apple juice, not hard liquor. He has been swindled. As Jackie is manhandled by his angry opponent, he declares ironically: \"See? I'm a born winner.\"\n\nThe film offers an insight into the \"wonderful life\" of its hero: \"I'm up to my neck in shit,\" he concedes, \"but the view from here is good. New game, new luck, that's my philosophy.\" Jackie's troubles relate to debts of 44,500[euro], for which he will serve a jail term if he cannot raise the money over the weekend. There are other issues: his wife's declaration that their marriage is over, his estrangement from his daughter and granddaughter, and the conspicuous material success of his son, who has embraced the capitalist lifestyle and works for the very bank to which Jackie owes so much money. Moreover, Jackie employs eight women at a seedy club he keeps secret from his wife; all stand to lose their jobs if Jackie cannot right his finances. The death of Jackie's mother is another blow, but also presents this player with a financial opportunity. Unfortunately, according to Rebekka Zuckerman's will, Jackie and his brother Samuel, whom he has not seen since Samuel and his mother left the GDR forty years previously, must observe the Shiva, the seven-day Jewish mourning period, and reconcile with each other in order to obtain their inheritance. The film documents the atheist Jackie's attempts to observe this Jewish ritual and bury his mother whilst simultaneously (and unbeknownst to the family) playing in a pool competition for the prize money that could solve all his problems. Jackie's deception is uncovered, both he and Samuel land in hospital with stress-related illnesses and the Shiva--and a genuine reconciliation--are completed there. The inheritance, as it turns out, is worthless, but Jackie is reborn as a family man and practicing Jew. With his new responsibilities, he tells us at the end of the film, he has little time left for chicanery.\n\nOriginally intended for television, Go for Zucker! was filmed over just twenty-three days with two cameras in 2004, and unexpectedly found its way into cinemas in January 2005. (4) Dani Levy, a Jew born in Basel in 1957, has lived in Berlin, his mother's home town, since 1980, and describes the film as a way of reaching out to her, for she has never spoken of her experiences of the Holocaust (Levy 2005b). Levy's mother fled Berlin in 1939, unlike Rebekka Zuckerman in the film, who is said to have hidden out in the Metropol theatre during the Holocaust, only to flee communist Berlin for the heart of West German commerce, Frankfurt. The first post-war Jewish comedy, the film cleverly deals with the Jewish question and the post-war division of Germany at the same time, enabling an identification with Jackie Zucker if not as a Jew, then as one of the many disaffected \"losers\" of German reunification. (5)\n\nThe sympathetic portrayal of such a quintessentially German hero-played by the much loved East-German actor Henry Hubchen--has been lauded as serving the \"normalisation\" of German-Jewish post-war relations. (6) Levy himself has described the film in terms of a wish to return German--Jewish relations in Germany to the reality which prevailed pre-war, when Jewish culture was an integral and important part of German cultural and intellectual life (Levy 2005b).\n\n\"Humour is probably the nicest and most legitimate means of survival.\" (7)\n\nBoth Lessing and Levy use the conventions of the comedy genre to humanise the Jews for the German audiences of their day. Vastly different as the contexts of the mid-eighteenth century and the beginning of the twenty-first century are, what has endured tenaciously is a German sense of the Jews as foreign (fremd), and it is humour that the two artists reach for to try to overcome this alienation between Jews and other Germans. However in attempting to break down the perception of Jews as foreigners in their different contexts, Lessing and Levy use the comedy genre in very different ways. An awareness of the different inflections of the \"foreignness\" of the Jews in each context will help us to understand their use of the comedy genre.\n\nIn 1909 the Zionist writer Max Nordau summarised the history of the Jews in Europe to that point in terms of their being regarded \"constantly and unchangingly as foreigners [Fremde] ... even if they settled in a land centuries ago, even if they had lived in the country for much longer than the people that called them foreigners\" (Nordau 1910:6). The eighteenth century and the Enlightenment, says Nordau, were the first moment in European history when the separation of the Jews from their host lands was challenged: \"New feelings occupied Jewish hearts. For the first time, Jews were permitted to believe that they weren't foreigners in the countries they lived in\" (Nordau 1910:15).\n\nIn Lessing's play we see the hope and optimism that accompanied this first opening up of German--Jewish dialogue, as well as its limitations. With its extraordinary hero, Lessing's play shows eighteenth-century audiences that, far from being inherently foreign, given similar opportunities, a Jew can become a model gentleman. Lessing brings his noble Jew to the stage at a time when audiences were more acquainted with the Jew as a figure of comedic derision. The traveller is the straight man, not the butt of antisemitic laughter, and Lessing does not recoil from representing the adverse situation of the Jews even within an otherwise amusing play. For example, a light-hearted ending is thwarted by the legal impossibility of an inter-racial marriage between the Baron's daughter and the handsome traveller.\n\nIn the controversy that surrounded the publication of the play, Lessing emphasised the barrier which a lack of acquaintance with Jews presented to overcoming prejudice. In order to believe in the possibility of civil improvement of the Jews, he wrote in response to Michaelis, one necessarily needed to know them better, and to this end he quoted Mendelssohn's letter to Gumperz. He also has his protagonist observe that antisemitic prejudice prevails in a context in which many Germans have no personal acquaintance with Jews. In response to the suggestion that Jewish thieves make the streets unsafe, the traveller observes pointedly: \"I don't understand how Jews should be able to make the roads unsafe, since so few of them are suffered to remain in this country\" (Lessing 1888:190).\n\nLevy, too, deals with the problem of the Jews as \"foreigners\" in Germany, and is aware that his German audience is unlikely to know any Jews personally. Centuries of emancipationist struggle were destroyed by the National Socialist regime, so that when Levy films his Jewish comedy, the theme of foreignness is as persistent as it was in Lessing's day, distinguished only by the presence of post-Holocaust guilt:\n\nThe main problem today in Germany is that most people, when they regard the topic of Judaism, don't have any personal experience to refer to. There are so few Jews in this country that I'd suggest that 80 to 90 per cent of Germans don't ever come into contact with them. So there emerges a strangeness that is saturated by a bad conscience in relation to German history. This nurtures irrational fears of contact and a timidity towards the \"foreigners\" (Levy 2005b).\n\nLevy and Lessing share a confidence that exposure to sympathetic Jewish characters in an entertaining format can break down the barriers that separate Germans and Jews. Both seek to overcome the perceived foreignness (Fremdheit) of the Jews in Germany, and both choose the comedy genre to frame their message. Regine Blass observes that the genre of the stage comedy draws much of its humour from harmless misunderstandings and mistakes (Blass 2003:63). This is true of both The Jews and Go for Zucker! (although the latter also draws on a film slapstick heritage). There is one major difference: while the travails of Levy's Jackie and the behaviour of other Jewish characters are the source of the film's humour, the only Jewish character in Lessing's play is not himself funny. This portrayal of the Jewish traveller as a \"straight\" character at a time when the comical Jew was a standard part of the comedic repertoire is noteworthy. (8) Lessing wrote in his introduction to the volume of comedies containing The Jews \"that everything that went through my mind turned into a comedy. It occurred to me soon enough to see what kind of effect it would have on the stage if one showed the people virtue where they least expected it\" (Lessing 1972b:525). It is clear from this that Lessing had other ideas than to present a comical Jewish character for the amusement of his audience. Rather, it seems that the reaction of \"the people\" to the surprising coincidence of Jewishness and virtue was expected to produce the comedic effect. Lessing invokes the demeaning characterisations of the dialect-speaking Jew, which were so familiar to audiences at the time, only insofar as they are ineptly performed by the Christian characters Krumm and Stich, whose farcical names (meaning, respectively \"bent,\" and \"sting\" or \"prick\") reveal them to be the object of the play's humour. When the Baron is easily fooled by their charade, Lessing shows that the ridiculous stereotype is predominant even among the higher classes. So while the title of the play--The Jews: A Comedy in One Act--seems to promise a comedy in which Jews will be the object of mirth, as Guthke argues, it is in fact the anti-Semitic prejudice of its Christian characters which is parodied (2005:101). This leads Guthke to wonder just how effective the play can be as a comedy when the prejudice it parodies is shared by the audience. Similarly, Och doubts whether \"The Jews really was performed because of its enlightened aspirations\" (1992:49).\n\nWhile Lessing circumvents the cliche of the comic stage Jew, Levy rehabilitates him, causing the German press to ask \"whether and how one may laugh at Jews in Germany\" (Rother 2005). While admirers of the film may argue that the audience laughs not at, but with, Jackie Zucker (Spiegel 2005), he is certainly a comic figure, in contrast to Lessing's traveller. For Levy, when German audiences laugh at Jackie's bad luck and botched trickery, they are accepting a Jewish character as human:\n\n[A]s with other minorities, it is always helpful if you make films about these people. Films that are heart-warming, with characters who aren't untouchable, ideal people somewhere over there on the horizon, but who are saturated by the daily chaos that accompanies all of us. When you have seen Go for Zucker!, you don't have the feeling that you have seen Jews, you have met people who move you and about whom and with whom you can laugh. And maybe you have the feeling that you have seen a Jew from a completely different perspective and you lose a little bit more of the fear of the foreign. (Levy 2005b)\n\nSo while Lessing saw it necessary to create just such an \"ideal\" person \"somewhere over there on the horizon,\" in order to appeal to the Enlightenment's aspirations of human virtue, Levy wants to help a twenty-first-century audience throw off historical baggage and be able to laugh at and with a Jewish comic figure. Where Lessing subverted the cliche of laughing at the Jews on stage by depicting the only Jewish character as beyond reproach, Levy returns to the comical figure of the Jew as someone the audience laughs at. By the twenty-first century, though, the comic Jew has become a lovable rogue, his trickery not evidence of the moral failings of all Jews, but an endearingly human foible.\n\n\"All of them, without exception, are cheats, thieves and robbers.\" (9)\n\nThe themes of honesty and deception are equally central to Lessing's play and Levy's film, and the approach to these themes is one of the more interesting contrasts between the works. Jackie's bad luck and his dishonest attempts to get ahead in the unforgiving post-unification climate are the dominant motifs in Levy's film, and drive its farcical comedy. In Lessing it is the dishonesty of the Christians posing as Jews that provides the laughs. While Lessing is at pains to depict--contrary to popular eighteenth-century opinion, encapsulated in his character Krumm's assertion, above--an upstanding and honest Jew, Levy seeks to humanise a Jewish character precisely by showing him as a dishonest, albeit endearing, rogue.\n\nThe notion of honesty has been identified as a leitmotiv of Lessing's play (Blass 2003:56). The play begins with a deception--the attempted robbery by Krumm and Stich posing as Jews--and is thereafter concerned with unveiling this deception and revealing an honest Jew among Christian liars. The play highlights, and then subverts, the notion that Jews are inherently and incorrigibly dishonest: \"As becomes clear on multiple occasions, the Christians regard themselves as morally above reproach, upstanding and righteous, whereas they consider their Jewish countrymen as untruthful, malicious, deceitful and thieving\" (Blass 2003:56). The first scene demonstrates the hypocrisy of this attitude; it introduces the Christian characters Krumm and Stich, discussing the failure of their attempted robbery with the lament: \"What infernal luck! Without luck one cannot even be a good pickpocket\" (Lessing 1888:187). This pair of inept rogues then brag that they have escaped the gallows yet again:\n\nStich: If all thieves were hung, the gallows would have to stand thicker. One hardly sees one in two miles, and where there is one, it stands unoccupied ... And what is the use of them, after all? None at all, except at most that, when one of us passes by, he shuts his eyes.\n\nKrumm: Oh, I don't even do that. My father and grandfather died on the gallows; can I ask a better fate? I am not ashamed of my parents.\n\nStich: But honest people will be ashamed of you. You have not done nearly enough yet for one to recognise their genuine offspring in you. (Lessing 1888:187-188)\n\nThis exchange in the first scene establishes the thoroughly ironic sense in which the term \"honest\" will be used throughout the play. For it is the deceitful, lying and thieving Christian characters, Stich, Krumm and the traveller's lazy servant Christoph, who protest their honesty with mundane regularity, particularly when they are about to be caught out in their deception. The traveller himself never once professes his honesty, as the lying Christian characters do. Krumm, the Baron's bailiff, is constantly described as an honest man, first of all by the traveller himself when they first meet:\n\nTraveller: You are an honest man.\n\nKrumm: That I am. And honesty is the best policy. (Lessing 1888:188)\n\nLater, in the scene in which Krumm inadvertently reveals himself as one of the thieves, he protests no less than three times that he is an honest man (Lessing 1888:208-210). While Lessing does not portray the Baron as similarly dishonest, he is implicated in the erroneous belief that Christians are honest and upstanding while Jews are deceptive. Asked what he thinks of his bailiff, the Baron answers: \"I consider him a thoroughly honest and upright man\" (Lessing 1888:211). And his accomplice Stich is \"the most honest man on [the] whole property\" (Lessing 1888:215). Yet the Baron all too willingly accepts these bumbling rogues as Jews when they attack him on the street wearing fake beards.\n\nThe question of the honesty of the Jew in the play was the heart of the controversy ignited by Michaelis' inflammatory review. In his letter to Gumperz, Mendelssohn laments Michaelis' inability to imagine the existence of even one honest Jew:\n\nReally! What a nerve must a person have, who still has any sense of honesty, to deny a whole people [Nation] the possibility of being able to produce a single honest man? ... only virtue, the only comfort of oppressed souls, the only refuge of the abandoned, should not be entirely denied us. However, this too is denied us ... (10)\n\nThe desperate tone of the letter shows just how radical Lessing's traveller is for the eighteenth-century stage, with its didactic intent. For if it can be shown both that Christians are capable of deception and thievery, and that a Jew-even one-is capable of virtue, then the program of Enlightenment can be mobilised to improve the latter's position. In his response to Michaelis, Lessing describes the conditions necessary for the emergence of such a noble Jew, namely wealth, worldly experience and education. Lessing points out that his traveller has the benefit of all these improving circumstances; he is wealthy, well-travelled and educated, he even travels with his books. To believe that such improvements could not produce Jewish gentlemen of virtue is pure prejudice, Lessing writes:\n\nIf one insists that wealth, experience and an enlightened understanding couldn't have any effect on a Jew, then I must say that this is the very prejudice that I have tried to weaken in my comedy; a prejudice that can only flow from pride or hatred, and that makes of the Jews not just uncultivated people, but which in reality places them far below humanity. (Lessing 1972a:417)\n\nIn his introduction to the volume of comedies, Lessing invokes the glorious history of the Jewish people as evidence of their potential greatness: \"In antiquity, I thought, so many heroes and prophets emerged [from among the Jews], and now one doubts whether an honest man can be found among them?\" (Lessing 1972b:525). The unassailable virtue of the traveller is intended to show that civil improvement-represented by the figure of the honest man-is possible for Jews if the necessary conditions prevail. Moreover, the comical Christian characters unwittingly parody the stereotypes of the Jews as thieves and liars when they so inexpertly seek to hide their misdeeds behind fake Jewish identities.\n\nThe Jewish protagonist in Go for Zucker!, in contrast to Lessing's traveller, is a comic rogue, a liar and a swindler. He has more in common in this respect with Krumm and Stich than he does with the idealised traveller. From the opening credits, when he deceives his opponent in a pool match, to the burial of his mother, when he fakes a heart attack and stumbles into her open grave for maximum effect, only to sneak away to his pool tournament, Jackie is untrustworthy and deceitful. His wife Marlene knows to suspect him, wondering: \"Jackie. You're not up to something?\" Jackie recruits others as a cast of liars. His daughter Jana drives him secretly to the pool tournament and makes excuses for him, while the manager of his secret sex club (a former secretary from Jackie's days as a sports journalist) stages an ambulance visit complete with stretcher, uniforms and paramedics. All the while Jackie pretends he cannot go to the synagogue because the doctor has advised bed rest. Then, as Jackie and Samuel sit in stony silence during their \"conciliatory talk\" and Jackie actually begins to suffer the early effects of a real heart attack, Marlene snaps and tells the visiting relatives:\n\nMy husband, Jakob Zuckerman, is lying to and deceiving all of us. The heart attacks, the ambulance: a con! The heart problems, the doctors: lies! All lies! He doesn't want to risk the inheritance, but still wants to do his secret deals. I'm sorry, but my husband is a hopeless, unscrupulous gambler!\n\nThe most honest character in Levy's film is Samuel's orthodox son, Joshua, who decries Jackie's deception as \"Jewish slapstick,\" which is of course precisely what it is, but the rest of the family, even Samuel, are prepared to make allowances for the hapless Jackie. Realizing that Jackie's intentions in relation to the Shiva were not honest, and that he has made the whole family accomplices, Joshua intends to tell the Rabbi that Rebekka Zuckerman's rules have been transgressed. Jackie's daughter Jana pursues him:\n\nJoshua, I'm so sorry about what has become of you. Yes, you're right, we are breaking the rules. You're right, my father is lying and deceiving. You are right, everyone's only thinking of the money. Because it's a lot of dough, isn't it? But what does your heart say? Can't it see that Jackie is in need?\n\nThe only virtuous character, in Lessingian terms, is here a hopelessly repressed outsider, someone to be pitied rather than admired. How far we are here from Lessing's time, when the Jewish rogue was a contemptible figure! And yet, perhaps Jackie has something in common with his Jewish ancestors of the eighteenth century, and even with Lessing's traveller. For the purported dishonesty of the Jews in the eighteenth century has a well-understood basis. The Baron identifies the reasons for ostensible Jewish cunning when he recounts an invented anecdote told to him by Stich in order to support his misapprehension that the would-be thieves were Jews. Stich has told him that he recently saw three Jews on the road:\n\nBaron: According to his description they must have looked more like rogues than honest people. And why should I doubt it? People so intent on gain care little whether they make money by fair means or foul-by cunning or force. They seem to be born for commerce, or, to speak more plainly, for cheating (Lessing 1888:196).\n\nThe mercantile qualities of the Jews and their perceived tendency to deception were closely related in the eighteenth century. (11) This link is also at the heart of Michaelis's disinclination to believe in the plausibility of an honest Jew, \"because almost the entire people must live off commerce, which provides more opportunity and temptation for deception than other occupations\" (Michaelis 1969:49). Lessing responds:\n\n[Michaelis] gives as the reason for the improbability of such a Jew ... the necessity in which the Jewish people find themselves, of surviving entirely on commerce. That may be, but does it not therefore follow, that the improbability ceases as soon as the circumstances cease to cause it? And when do they cease to do so? Without doubt at that point ... when a Jew ... is not forced to live a miserable life on the basis of petty and worthless commerce. (Lessing 1972a:416-417)\n\nSo Lessing raises his wealthy traveller above the demeaning realm of the marketplace, and sends him off on a journey with a servant and a personal library. Mid-century Lessing is, of course, a creature of the Ancien Regime, unable to imagine commerce as an acceptable occupation, let alone as an important means by which the Jews of Europe will in the nineteenth century find a respectable place in society. As Michael Meyer notes, in their commercial activities, many Jews found themselves in \"a currently abnormal occupational pattern that would ... become far more normal\" by the end of the nineteenth century (Meyer 2003:14). For Lessing, however, the mercantilism of the Jews is an unfortunate result of their oppression.\n\nIn one significant respect, however, the traveller is himself deceitful, if only by omission. Paradoxically, in order to show a prejudiced Baron (and the play's audience) that a Jew can be an honest man, he is required throughout the play to conceal his Jewishness, a didactic act of deception for which the Baron forgives him. Moreover, in a soliloquy in the third scene, the traveller reflects that it is the circumstances of the Jews' oppression which leads to whatever trickery they commit, while Christians themselves are guilty of dishonesty in dealing with Jews: \"If a Jew cheats, at least seven times out of nine he has been driven to it by a Christian. I doubt whether many Christians can boast of having dealt uprightly with a Jew\" (Lessing 1888:191).\n\nBy contrast, Levy's twenty-first-century context is one in which--the brief hiatus of the Cold War notwithstanding-mercantile capitalism reigns. Jackie's world is not divided, as is Lessing's, into liars and honest men, the enlightened and the prejudiced, but into the winners and losers of capitalism, those who thrive under it and those (like Jackie) who dwell in its seedy depths. On the side of the winners, Jackie can count his son, Tommy, who works for a bank, wears expensive suits, goes to the gym and drives a new Audi with his dog--named DAX after the German shares index--on the back seat. There is also his brother, who, having fled East Berlin with his mother, is a successful businessman who purchased the apartment building in which Jackie still lives (Samuel is as eager for the inheritance as Jackie, however, as he has been losing money of late). Jackie, in contrast, deems himself \"the typical reunification loser. Did everything wrong, lost everything. The only way I can still earn money is with billiards.\" Jackie is a capitalist bottom-feeder. In a context in which mercantilism has become acceptable, even virtuous, he subsists (though not at all successfully) by doing business in areas that have remained at the disreputable end of the commercial spectrum: confidence trickery, the sex industry and gambling. IN a way similar to Lessing's Stich and Krumm, Jackie invokes the notion of honesty ironically. Alluding to his shady commerce at the beginning of the film, he jokes: \"You know, it has nothing to do with luck. I earned all this honestly.\"\n\nBlass explores the nuances of the terms honest (ehrlich) and dishonest (unehrlich) as they are used in Lessing's play, noting that well into the eighteenth century the terms functioned above all as \"social criteria for the differentiation of classes and trades\" (Blass 2003:56). Interestingly, dishonest occupations included not just thievery, but also those excluded from the guilds, a distinction which one can see in operation in Jackie's world. He and his brother are both \"gamblers,\" his brother in the property market, Jackie in the pool halls of Berlin. Like the Jews of the eighteenth century, who were regarded as criminals due to the limited options afforded to them for earning a living, Jackie is forced to eke out an existence in this way in the harsh climate of post-GDR Berlin. As he explains tearfully to his wife: \"Marlene, do you think I would go through this charade if I didn't have to?\" Although Levy, unlike Lessing, has his protagonist dwell in economic misery, his plight humanises him for non-Jewish German audiences, who can empathise with his predicament as the typical post-unification loser. Just as the traveller's virtue made him indistinguishable from an honest Christian nobleman, Jackie's \"bad luck\" makes him not so much Jewish, as quintessentially German. Indeed, the film, not unlike the play, suggests that Jews are capable of being among the most patriotic of German citizens. As Jackie and Samuel are on their way back from the airport, the eavesdropping taxi driver is impressed by the story of their mother, who stayed in Germany even after the war: \"And after Hitler she stayed in her Germany? As a Jew? That's what I call patriotism.\" It is this acceptance of Jews within a notion of Germanness that is ultimately the most urgent concern of both pieces.\n\n\"There are Jews too, I suppose, who are no Jews.\" (12)\n\nSince the Enlightenment, the question of Jewish belonging within a German nation (or at least the idea of a German nation) has had as its corollary the issue of Jewish \"assimilation.\" Both of these texts feature Jewish protagonists who lack distinguishing Jewish appearances, for they exist in two different German contexts which require a denial of an outwardly apparent Jewish identity. Jackie's Jewish heritage is acknowledged at the outset, albeit in a dismissive aside. He rejects any association with the Jewish community and has even changed his Jewish-sounding surname to Zucker. He introduces himself at the start of the film as follows:\n\nBorn in 1947 as Jakob Zuckerman. If that sounds to you somehow Jewish then you're mistaken. I haven't had anything to do with that club. Until last week. In my life I'm called Jackie Zucker.\n\nBy contrast, Lessing's traveller remains nameless throughout the play, and his Jewish identity is only revealed at the end. Like Jackie, he attains acceptance in mainstream German society by appearing fully assimilated. As Goetschel points out, he even transgresses Prussian law by not wearing a beard that would identify him as Jewish. (13) His servant, Christoph, is as surprised as anyone that his employer is Jewish, commenting only after the fact that he had noticed the traveller avoided eating pork and that he performed other mysterious rituals--\"a hundred other follies\" (Lessing 1888:217). The concealed nature of the traveller's Jewish identity is invoked for comic effect when, in the final scene, the Baron's coquettish servant Lisette asks Christoph flirtatiously whether he might also be Jewish:\n\nLisette: And perhaps, if one only knew it, you are a Jew yourself, too, however you may disguise it? Christoph: You are too inquisitive for a young lady. (Lessing 1888:217)\n\nBy alluding to circumcision, the most private marker of male Jewish identity, Lisette reaffirms the play's Enlightenment message, that Jewish identity is of little consequence, and that in matters of character as well as appearance, a Jew can be all but indistinguishable from a Christian. Indeed the audience's confidence in an archetypal Jewish appearance is parodied in the play, for the only Jewish-looking characters are the Christian rogues Stich and Krumm in their inept disguises.\n\nThis assimilationist message has attracted much negative critique of Lessing's two plays with Jewish themes in the more recent scholarship. Such critiques in fact amount to a critique of the Enlightenment model of Jewish emancipation in Germany, based as it was on assimilationist principles which repeatedly failed to protect the Jews from surges in anti-Semitic sentiment during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Within such critiques, Lessing becomes associated with the regrettable failure of an Enlightenment project positing an all-too-narrow model of humanity. Representative of this recent Lessing critique is Ritchie Robertson, who argues that The Jews confirms anti-Semitic prejudice by suggesting that a good Jew is exceptional:\n\nThe play's philosemitism is limited by its presentation of the Jew as good because exceptional. The Baron's words--\"Oh, how estimable would the Jews be, were they all like you!\"--suggest that the Jew is an admirable Jew because he is untypical, both in his goodness, and in having no readily perceptible Jewish qualities (Robertson 1998:110).\n\nRobertson seems here to be attributing the Baron's prejudice to Lessing himself, whereas the play reveals the Baron's prejudice as folly, for it leads him to mistake his own employees for Jewish thieves. Moreover, Lessing has the traveller counter the Baron by pointing out the rarity of a good Christian: \"And how amiable the Christians, if they all possessed your qualities!\" (Lessing 1888:217). This snappy reply (which Robertson strangely ignores) to the Baron's two-edged compliment deflates it of its antisemitic power. If the Baron's compliment demeans the Jewish people by making the traveller an exception among Jews, the traveller's reply suggests that the Baron himself is a similar exception among a lamentable cast of Christian characters. We must recall Lessing's own awareness of the potential pitfalls of portraying an exceptional Jewish character: \"Even if my traveller were a Christian, his character would be very rare\" (Lessing 1972a:417).\n\nAs Goetschel points out, Lessing is aware of \"the philosemitic trap of simply converting a negative prejudice into a positive one,\" and thus he does not suggest that all Jews are as admirable as his traveller (Goetschel 2003:70). His reference, in his response to Michaelis, to the common Jews as \"immoral rabble that roam around at funfairs\" (Lessing 1972a:418), is taken by Robertson as evidence of Lessing's own latent antisemitism: \"The individual Jew is presented as good by contrast with an anonymous and faceless swarm of bad Jews\" (Robertson 1998:111). Yet for Lessing it is not the Jewishness of the mob which he finds uninspiring, rather, as I have argued above, it is their moral corruption by petty commerce. When we note that Lessing characterises the Christian mob in similarly negative terms (the play makes several references to the unthinking prejudice of the Christian masses), it becomes apparent that Lessing's model of toleration is indeed qualified, not by an unacknowledged antisemitism, but by the economic precondition of his model of civil improvement. In the mid-eighteenth century. The path to civil betterment can only be trodden by those gifted with independent wealth, and the education it affords. Cultural assimilation is but one aspect of the Enlightenment model of Jewish emancipation. Economic, class and gender issues are equally central to its limitations and failings. (14)\n\nThe GDR of which Levy's Jackie Zucker is a product expects a similar degree of assimilation from its Jewish citizens as Lessing's pre-emancipation Prussia. Consequently, there is nothing about Jackie's life before the arrival of his more religious brother that speaks of his Jewishness. When his non-Jewish wife, Marlene, takes it upon herself to create the appearance of \"a somewhat normal Jewish family,\" Jackie protests that he was never a member of Berlin's officially recognised Jewish community, and never will be. The situation which thwarted a happy ending to Lessing's play--the prohibition of intermarriage of Jews and Christians--is given an ironic twist in Levy's film, for it is Marlene who must try to assimilate to Jewish culture. When she buys Jewish accoutrements in a Jewish shop, including a book titled How Jews Live, the saleswoman assures her: \"It's never too late to become Jewish.\" Marlene's frantic attempts to become Jewish provide some humorous sequences in the film, such as when she reads the Torah upside down in the synagogue and has to be put right by Golda, or when Golda complains to Samuel: \"Your brother's family is as kosher as a pork chop. Marlene is a goy. The boy is gay. And the daughter? Where is the daughter?\" (15)\n\nFar from being the observant Jew Marlene holds him out to be, Jackie is a faithful former citizen of the GDR who, like his wife, mourns the passing of the communist state. Jackie's Ostalgie (his nostalgia for the GDR) may be the most Jewish thing about him, because in this he conforms to the typical profile of the highly acculturated GDR Jew. (16) The Jews who stayed in-or returned to--East Germany after the war were there by choice, wanting to help build an anti-fascist state. (17) As Angelika Timm notes, many of the prominent Jewish citizens of the GDR were not especially interested in their Jewish heritage, and identified first and foremost as communists. (18) The acceptance of Jews in the GDR was predicated on a similar assimilationist assumption to that which underlay Lessing's call for tolerance. (19)\n\nWhile Jews outside the GDR reevaluated the success of the assimilationist model of emancipation, within the GDR \"the process of assimilation that began in Europe after the French Revolution, halted only by the Holocaust, was expected to continue after the end of World War II\" (Timm 1997:39). Yet \"the assimilating German Jew was aiming at moving targets\" (Meyer 2003:18) throughout German history. A look at the historical trajectory separating Jackie from Lessing's traveller reveals drastic transformations in the dominant values to which German Jews sought to adapt from the Enlightenment onwards. As we have seen, the eighteenth century emphasised moral virtue and inherited wealth, as opposed to that obtained by commerce. In contrast, the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries bestowed respectability on the mercantile activities in which many Jews excelled, and witnessed the \"overassimilation\" of the Jews in terms of education and culture (Meyer 2003:25). The Nazis defined Jews in opposition to Germanness and sought a violent reversal to the progress of Jewish assimilation. The GDR required commitment to an anti-capitalist ideology and, after the fall of that state, there was a breathtakingly speedy reassertion of capitalist values throughout a united Germany. As Meyer notes: \"To the extent that it was the German nation as a whole to which one was assimilating, there was the problem that the concept of Germany did not hold still\" (Meyer 2003:17).\n\nJackie Zucker is the heir to this assimilatory trajectory and, like his non-Jewish former-GDR countrymen, finds himself struggling to adapt to the latest shift in national values. The enduring gulf between many former citizens of the GDR and those in the West is played out within Jackie's family, and the matter of Jewish assimilation is one of the East-West dichotomies which separate Jackie from his brother. Samuel is portrayed by Jackie as a religious fanatic, \"one of those guys who throw stones at cars on the Sabbath in Israel.\" Samuel's religious observance and his capitalist ideology are equally irritating to Jackie, the secular communist, and Jackie's irritation only intensifies when he finds that his brother purchased the apartment building in which Jackie lives shortly after the end of the GDR. A heated political discussion ensues about state versus private property ownership, a discussion which reflects post-unification debates in Germany about the GDR legacy. In this scene, Jackie and Samuel represent East and West German experiences of unification. (20) At the same time as portraying a recuperation of Jewish identity in Germany, Levy has used a Jew to embody the quintessential post-unification German experience.\n\nFurthermore, for all the irreverence with which Jackie regards his religion throughout the film, a postscript, which finds him playing pool in the same bar he started out in, points to a return to his Jewish roots via the rehabilitation of family relationships:\n\nI don't have much time to gamble any more. I am busy caring for my family. On Mondays it's Jana's turn, Tuesdays Thomas, Fridays Marlene and on Sundays I talk to my brother Samuel on the phone for two hours. On Wednesday and Thursday I go to the Synagogue and read the Bible--nonsense!--the Torah!\n\nJackie then sinks the last ball, defeating his opponent (director Dani Levy in a cameo performance), suggesting that he is more of a winner in his life than previously (the viewer knows that his financial woes have been resolved thanks to a post-tournament rematch with the Ukrainian billiard champion). So Jackie's success and happiness in post-reunification Germany is linked to a nascent de-assimilation and an embrace of his Jewish heritage and family. While appealing to disaffected former citizens of the GDR with an irrepressible unification loser as its hero, the film at the same time repudiates the assimilationist policies of the SED, allowing Jackie to heal the East-West divide within his family and recuperate his Jewish identity.\n\nConclusion\n\nLessing's Jewish traveller is made acceptable to eighteenth-century audiences by the day's markers of virtue--wealth and gentlemanly manners--and by eschewing an outwardly Jewish appearance. Lessing was not able to foresee the assimilation of the Jews in the nineteenth century in part due to the mercantile skills they acquired by necessity, but he did provide an insight into the cultural trade-offs the assimilated Jews of Germany would be required to make. Levy's Jackie is the result of these trade-offs, having renounced his Jewish heritage entirely in order to identify with the dominant values of the East German socialist state. After the fall of the GDR, though, Jackie finds himself living on the economic margins and deceiving, not because he wants to, but because he must in order to survive. In this he is not unlike the Jewish traders of Lessing's century. However, while Jackie does not lose his roguish tinge, he too is ultimately an idealised figure, reborn by the end of the film as a loving family man, finding his way back to his Jewish faith.\n\nLessing's gentleman traveller and Levy's good-hearted rogue both represent an appeal for the acceptance of Jews in their respective Germanies, Lessing for what they might contribute to an emerging Enlightened society, Levy for the contributions they have made and the deep connections they continue to have to post-Shoah Germany. While Levy's film gently critiques GDR-style assimilation as a failed strategy, his film suggests there is a way forward for Jews in Germany. In Go for Zucker!, Lessing's dream-the acceptance of Jews into the German body politic-has been accomplished. A cultural descendant of Lessing's Jewish traveller, Jackie is a quintessentially German hero who (ultimately) embraces his Jewish identity.\n\nBibliography\n\nBlass, Regine. 2003. \"Vorurteile als Kunstfehler des Verstehens.

In the absence of contemporary reviews this is merely speculation.\n\n(4) The film was produced by X-Filme Creative Pool (the company founded by Levy, and successful filmmakers Tom Tykwer, Bernd Eichinger and Wolfgang Becker) together with Westdeutscher Rundfunk, Bayerischer Rundfunkand Arte TV.\n\n(5) Levy uses a Jewish family to tell a story about the fractured German nation: \"I found it interesting that there was a family that was fractured in the same way as the whole nation\" (Dockhorn 2005:37).\n\n(6) See Kuhl (2005:64). The president of the German Jewish council (Zentralrat der deutschen Juden), Paul Spiegel, said in an interview with the Berliner Morgenpost \"I believe that [Go for Zucker! can help to bring Jews and non-Jews in Germany onto the path towards normality\" (Spiegel 2005).\n\n(7) Levy 2005b.\n\n(8) Och notes the prominence of comic Jews at the time: \"The stage figure of the Jew in the area of lower burlesque was understood as its own specialisation.

See also Guthke (2005) on actual Jewish thieves of the eighteenth century. Meyer notes that it was in the sphere of thievery that Jews and Christians first lived \"to a high degree, in a shared culture.\" They \"not only sometimes participated in combined gangs but also developed a common language\" (2003:17).\n\n(12) Christoph in Lessing (1888:217).\n\n(13) As Goetschel points out, the play was written a year after Frederick the Great promulgated a law requiring Jews to wear beards to make themselves identifiable (2003:64-65).\n\n(14) Neither Robertson nor the other critics who take Lessing to task for his limited notion of toleration bother to note, for example, that it included only the male half of the Jewish population. This unacknowledged caveat on the vision for Jewish emancipation seems to be accepted as part of the eighteenth-century Zeitgeist.\n\n(15) Although Marlene's attempts to create the impression of kosher living are farcical, they reflect a belated movement among Jews in the closing years of the GDR toward rediscovery of their Jewish heritage. In 1987 a new Jewish group was established by nonmembers of the Berlin Jewish community called \"wir fur uns.\" Comprising predominantly young GDR Jews who wanted to discover more about their Jewish heritage, the group had about 150 members (Timm 1997:34).\n\n(16) As Ostow writes: \"For many East German Jews, the collapse of the GDR and the German reunification were a tragedy, a fall from a state of grace to one of destruction and death\" (1993:68).\n\n(17) Jews as a group were recognised as victims of fascism in East Germany, and some Jews took a leading role in the early life of the GDR, such as Jackie's namesake, Leo Zuckermann, secretary to the first East German president Wilhelm Pieck (Timm 1997:30).\n\n(18) See Timm 1997:30-31. However, far from creating a paradise for Jews in the GDR, the SED purged the party of some of its most loyal Jewish members under the rubric of anti-Zionism. Hundreds (including Leo Zuckermann) fled the GDR in 1952-1953 in the wake of the purge.\n\n(19) As Timm observes, \"the SED regarded the 'Jewish question' as an economic and political problem unique to feudal and capitalist societies. Anti-Semitism was considered a weapon of the ruling class in the Middle Ages, and students were taught that anti-Semitism was also used by capitalists as a propaganda weapon in the twentieth century to distract the working masses from class struggle ... Therefore, the workers' parties fought anti-Semitism and showed solidarity with Jews facing discrimination; at the same time, the communists stressed that the workers' movement had nothing in common with capitalists of Jewish faith\" (Timm 1997:39).\n\n(20) It is indeed a veritable clash of East and West German cultures that ensues when Samuel--who has been dubbed \"Uncle Ayatollah\" by Jackie's daughter--arrives with his religiously observant family. Asked at the airport what his brother looks like, Jackie responds: \"Probably like Osama bin Laden.\" For their part, Samuel's family has their own cliched idea of Jackie the atheist communist, Samuel's wife Golda conceding she had expected Jackie to look like Stalin."
