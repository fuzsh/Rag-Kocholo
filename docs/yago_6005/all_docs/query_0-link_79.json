        "text": "BERLIN â€” It has been awhile since Germans last laughed openly at a Jewish joke, especially one that pokes fun at Jews themselves. Sixty years after the Holocaust, most Germans still feel too guilty or insecure to address any Jewish matter in a lighthearted manner. But a new movie is encouraging them to get rid of their postwar anxieties and join in for a good laugh.\n\nMixing slapstick and political incorrectness, \"Alles auf Zucker!\" (Go for Zucker!) is said to be the first German-Jewish comedy since World War II and has attracted huge audiences across the country. Its success suggests that humor could be an unconventional form of therapy for the strained relations between Jews and gentiles here.\n\nDirected by Dani Levy, a German Jew who grew up in Switzerland, the movie is a lively family comedy about a notorious East German gambler, who long ago distanced himself from his Jewish roots, and his Orthodox brother, who escaped to West Germany before the Berlin Wall was built.\n\nThe estranged brothers and their families meet for the first time in 40 years at their mother's funeral in Berlin. By the terms of her will, they can inherit the family fortune only if they reconcile and mourn in the traditional Jewish way, by sitting shiva for seven days."
