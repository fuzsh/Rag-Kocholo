        "text": "Name: Danni Levy\n\nAge: 31\n\nOccupation: Fitness Trainer / Journalist Ambitious, fun and with a figure to die for\n\nWhat do you do in Marbella?\n\nI’ve been here since September and have been doing fitness. I write a lot of blogs about fitness and I also train people. I do train celebrities but I’m not allowed to say who because a lot of them are my friends. But I also train special cases, for example, I’ve worked with a guy who if I didn’t help him get into shape then he was going to die. That’s what gives me more job satisfaction than someone else who just wants to lose weight to look good. To be able to turn someone’s life around where it can potentially save their life is a worthwhile thing to do and something that rights all my wrongs when I go out and have too many drinks!\n\nWhat’s an average day like for you?\n\nI’m working on my fitness website so I am doing a lot of filming for that. I combine the mental with the physical at the moment but I do normally finish the day with a glass of cava! It’s a lot harder not to drink and smoke here than it is in the UK. When you’re driving home in Britain the prospect of stopping off at the pub is not very appealing, it’s dark and grey, so you go home and watch the soaps. Here you just want to be outside in the sunshine. So most days do involve some sort of social situation.\n\nDo you like the fact people flash their cash in Marbella?\n\nNo, I can’t stand it. To me money is not that important. Obviously we would all like more so we can buy a Ferrari or a mansion but I have never been attracted to wealthy men because I tend to find them arrogant. But it makes the place nicer because let’s face it, if there wasn’t the money here to be spend then we wouldn’t be able to come and enjoy these nice places because we’d be in Southend-on-Sea. Their cash injection does enhance the area.\n\nHow will this show compare to TOWIE or Made In Chelsea?\n\nI think it’s going to be a mixture of the two because you have the Essex lot and then there are the people with money. So you get the best of both worlds, it’s very different.\n\nWhat shows have you been offered before?\n\nI’ve been offered a lot of different shows mainly involving my family. They are wealthy but I’m not. People automatically assume that I get money from my dad but I don’t. My dad Robin is a millionaire, he builds multi-million pound properties and also develops nightclubs and restaurants. I’ve been through some really tough times\n\nfinancially but I haven’t asked my dad for help because I want to do it on my own. I’ve never had a penny from them. I don’t want to be portrayed as the rich kid or the daddy’s girl. I have money phobia. I’ve got this huge thing going on about self-respect, I don’t want to take money from anyone, I want to do it myself. I don’t think my dad even wants to help me because he wants me to stand on my own two feet.\n\nWhat surgery have you had?\n\nThe only money I really spend is on boob jobs, I’ve had four. I had one while I was on the show and now I want a fifth. I’ve been told that I am heading for a ‘Katie Price’ and will end up with no boobs left.\n\nAre you looking for love?\n\nNo, I’ve got a boyfriend called Jake but he’s not in the show. I love him to bits.\n\nWhy should people watch the show?\n\nPeople should watch the show because they will get to see my arse and boobs loads! I don’t like wearing clothes - I’m always in a bikini! This is totally new, you’re not going to know what’s coming round the corner. Everyday there’s a new drama. You have to be really strong to survive here."
