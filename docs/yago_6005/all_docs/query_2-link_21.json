        "text": "Courtesy of the Toronto Jewish Film Festival\n\nTalk about baring all for your art. German-Jewish director Dani Levy does Woody Allen one better in “Life Is Too Long,” which made its North American premiere at the Toronto Jewish Film Festival in May. A dyspeptic “Stardust Memories,” “Life Is Too Long” both exposes Levy’s fragile psyche and skewers family and friends with gleeful abandon. But Levy goes even further, literally revealing himself in a dream-sequence pickle shot that raises the stakes for self-disclosure.\n\nWith the production of a new film as the story’s binding thread, Levy takes us through several breakdowns — his marriage, his nerves, his work — via alter ego Alfi Seliger, played by the director himself. A has-been director whose film “Your Blue Miracle” was the hit of 1995, Seliger’s now flogging a disastrous-sounding screenplay — inspired by the Danish cartoon controversy — called “Moha-ha-med.” Colleagues dismiss him, his kids ignore him, and his voiceover-artist wife’s cheating on him with her boss; even worse, his bank’s tanking and he may have a fatal illness. Major Existential Crisis ensues.\n\nLike “Stardust Memories,” “Life Is Too Long” eschews conventional narrative for a series of surreal set-pieces which may or may not be taking place in Seliger’s mind. As in his previous films, Levy displays a keen eye for farce; Seliger’s medical exam may be the funniest colonoscopy you’ll ever watch, and a suicide attempt becomes more embarrassing than tragic. In a Charlie Kaufman-esque flourish, Seliger also confronts Levy himself, raging against his creator and insisting to anyone who’ll listen that they’re all characters in a movie (“Jewish paranoia,” notes a doctor. “I’m familiar with it”)."
