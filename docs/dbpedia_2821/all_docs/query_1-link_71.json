        "text": "VIENNA — Actor, filmmaker, opera director — Maximilian Schell, the first German-speaking actor ever to receive an Academy Award, died overnight Friday in a hospital in Innsbruck, Austria, after “a sudden and severe illness,” his agent Patricia Baumbauer said Saturday. He was 83.\n\nPursuing many careers, the multitalented Austrian still felt throughout his life that he was undervalued. He was active until the end and had just finished work on a television production at the time of his death.\n\nBorn in Vienna on Dec. 8, 1930, and raised in Switzerland, the prolific actor and suave ladies’ man rose to fame playing alongside Hollywood greats.\n\nSchell starred with Marlon Brando in 1958’s “The Young Lions,” and played the defense attorney in the 1961 film “Judgment at Nuremberg,” a role for which he was awarded the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Oscar for Best Actor in 1962. Success with “Tokapi” (1964), “The Deadly Affair” (1967) and “Counterpoint” (1967) followed.\n\nIn 1976 and 1978 Schell received Academy Award nominations for his roles in “The Man in the Glass Booth” and “Julia” (1977), respectively. He also had a role in the sweeping Richard Attenborough-directed historical military drama “A Bridge Too Far” (1977), which featured American actors Ryan O’Neal, James Caan, Anthony Hopkins, Elliott Gould, Robert Redford and Gene Hackman, and Scotsman Sean Connery, along with English actors Laurence Olivier, Michael Caine, Denholm Elliott and Ben Cross, and Norwegian Liv Ullmann.\n\nDespite playing leading roles in a number of Nazi-era films, Schell resisted being typecast by portraying German characters.\n\nA heavy loss from which he never really recovered was the death in 2005 of his older sister, Maria, herself a renowned actress. For many years, Schell, who started out as a theater actor in Germany, suffered from living in the shadow of his successful sister.\n\nDespite his Hollywood success, superstardom was denied to Schell, much to his disappointment.\n\nThe charming bon vivant remained an outsider both in Hollywood as well as in Germany, where he starred in a number of TV movies starting in the early 1990s.\n\nSchell was married to 35-year-old opera singer Iva Mihanovic. He has a daughter, Anastasia, from a previous marriage to Russian actress Natalia Andreichenko."
