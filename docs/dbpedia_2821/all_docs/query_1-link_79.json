        "text": "This post is also available in: Italiano (Italian) Deutsch (German)\n\nMulti-talented actress, able to adapt perfectly to any role assigned to her, for many years a member of the Vienna Burgtheater, Adrienne Gessner was for more than forty years the wife of the famous writer and theatre director Ernst Lothar.\n\nAustria, France, USA and again Austria\n\nWhen we think of the Austrian actress Adrienne Gessner, it is impossible not to think also of the famous writer and theatre director, former director of the Theater in der Josefstadt in Vienna, Ernst Lothar (1890 – 1974), her husband and life partner for more than forty years, until his death in 1974. Lothar’s novel A Woman is Witness: A Paris Diary (1951) was clearly inspired by her, their love story and their vicissitudes following the advent of National Socialism. She was his faithful companion not only on a theatre stage, but also during their ‘exile’ first in France, then in the United States. But who, in fact, was our Adrienne Gessner?\n\nBorn on July 23, 1896 in Maria Schutz, Adrienne came from a family of artists: her father, Gustav Geiringer, was a composer and singing teacher, while her mother and sister, Christine and Margarete von Bukovics, were both actresses. Just like his maternal grandfather Karl and his aunt Camilla. No wonder, then, that the girl was always interested in the art world. And so she soon began to study acting at the Akademie für Musik und darstellende Kunst in Vienna, before making her theatre debut as early as 1916 at the Münchener Kammerspiele.\n\nAfter immediately proving her talent, Adrienne Gessner began to travel around Europe, acting in some of the most important theatres in Stuttgart, Salzburg and, of course, Vienna. Soon, the film world also began to take an interest in her and in 1931 she took part in her first film: The Great Love, the only feature film made in Austria by the great Otto Preminger. It was during these glorious years of her career, therefore, that she met Ernst Lothar, at the time (and until 1937) director, as already mentioned, of the Theater in der Josefstadt in Vienna, together with his colleague Max Reinhardt. The two married in 1933, but their initial happiness was soon interrupted when Austria was annexed to the Third Reich in 1938. Given Lothar’s Jewish origins, therefore, the two immediately had to leave their homeland.\n\nWe don’t know exactly whether the novel A Woman is Witness: A Paris Diary was really inspired by their story. Clearly things were different for Adrienne Gessner and Ernst Lothar than for Franzi and Pierre. Yet, in the description of their great love, we like to think that the writer was really inspired by his relationship with Gessner. After a short stay in Paris, however, the couple moved to the United States, where Adrienne was still able to continue acting, even performing on Broadway. The desire to return to Europe, however, was still very strong and, as soon as the war was over, the two were finally able to return to Vienna.\n\nOnce back home, Adrienne Gessner’s career became more prolific than ever, both in film and theatre, in Austria and abroad. Among the feature films in which she took part, for example, are The Angel with the Trumpet (directed by Karl Hartl in 1948 and based on the novel The Vienna Melody by Lothar), Ich hab’ mich so an Dich gewöhnt (Eduard von Borsody, 1952), A Breath of Scandal (Michael Curtiz, 1960, in which the actress also starred alongside Sophia Loren), Crown Prince Rudolph’s last Love (Rudolf Jugert, 1956), Das Riesenrad (Géza von Radványi, 1961) and Tales from the Vienna Woods, directed by Maximilian Schell in 1979, the last feature film in which the actress took part, before devoting the latter part of her career exclusively to theatre and minor television films.\n\nMulti-talented actress, able to adapt perfectly to any role assigned to her, for many years a member of the Vienna Burgtheater, Adrienne Gessner was awarded the prestigious Max-Reinhardt-Ring and the Medal of Honour of the Federal Capital Vienna, and it was to her first love, theatre, that she dedicated the last years of her life, until her death on June 23, 1987 in Vienna, at the age of ninety. Her grave of honour, together with that of her husband, is located at the Zentralfriedhof in Vienna. Her name made such an important contribution to the Austrian cultural scene of those years that she is still remembered by millions of viewers today."
