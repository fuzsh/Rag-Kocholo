He returned to Austria after the war and began a successful career in theatre and, later, cinema.\n\nThe actor made his Hollywood debut in 1958, beside Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift in The Young Lions.\n\nIn 1961, he won the Oscar for best actor for his role as the lawyer for a Nazi war criminal in Stanley Kramer's film Judgment at Nuremberg.\n\nHe was nominated for two more Oscars for his acting, in 1976 for best actor for The Man in the Glass Booth and in 1978 as best supporting actor for Julia."
