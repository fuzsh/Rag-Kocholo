        "text": "VIENNA — Austrian-born actor Maximilian Schell, a fugitive from Adolf Hitler who became a Hollywood favorite and won an Oscar for his role as a defense attorney in “Judgment at Nuremberg,” has died. He was 83.\n\nSchell’s agent, Patricia Baumbauer, said Saturday he died overnight at a hospital in the Austrian city of Innsbruck after a “sudden illness.”\n\nSchell earned wide international acclaim from only his second Hollywood role, as defense attorney Hans Rolfe in Stanley Kramer’s classic “Judgment at Nuremberg.”\n\nSchell’s impassioned but unsuccessful defense of four Nazi judges on trial for sentencing innocent victims to death won him the 1961 Academy Award for best actor. Schell first played the role of Rolfe in a 1959 episode of the TV program “Playhouse 90.”\n\nDespite being type-cast for Nazi-era films, Schell’s acting performances in the mid-1970s also won him popular acclaim, earning him a best actor Oscar nomination for “The Man in the Glass Booth” and a supporting actor nomination for his performance alongside Jane Fonda, Vanessa Redgrave and Jason Robards in “Julia.”\n\nAustrian Cabinet minister Josef Ostermayer described Schell as one of “the greatest actors in the German-speaking world,” the Austria Press Agency reported.\n\nThe son of Swiss playwright Hermann Ferdinand Schell and Austrian stage actress Noe von Nordberg, Schell was born in Vienna on Dec. 8, 1930, and raised in Switzerland after his family fled Germany’s annexation of his homeland.\n\nSchell, who followed in the footsteps of his older sister Maria and brother Carl, made his stage debut in 1952. He appeared in German films before relocating to Hollywood in 1958.\n\nHe made his Hollywood debut in Edward Dmytryk’s “The Young Lions,” a World War II drama starring Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift and Dean Martin.\n\nSchell later worked as a producer and a director.\n\nSchell was also a successful concert pianist and conductor, performing with such luminaries as Claudio Abbado and Leonard Bernstein, and with orchestras in Berlin and Vienna."
