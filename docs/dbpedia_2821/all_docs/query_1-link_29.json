        "text": "Who was Maximilian Schell? An all-rounder, a successful film actor, an admired theatre actor, who as a feature film director created much acclaimed films with FIRST LOVE (CH/BRD 1970) or DER FUSSGÄNGER (BRD/CH 1973). But it was only with MARLENE (BRD/FR/CS 1984) that he made a name for himself worldwide as a director. His portrait of Marlene Dietrich received an Oscar nomination as Best Documentary Film. The exhibition Maximilian Schell at the (10 December 2019 through 19 April 2020) presents Schell’s artistic legacy. After his death in 2014, his archives were donated to the DFF, which already preserves the estate of Schell’s sister Maria, who died in 2005. The exhibition presents Maximilian Schell as a universal artist who has proven himself in many fields of art, not only as a pianist, art collector, producer, painter and draughtsman, but also as an opera director and author.\n\nAs in Schell’s life, the central element of the Frankfurt exhibition is his mountain pasture in Preitenegg in Carinthia, Austria – a secret haven of the Schell family since the early 20th century. The pasture was his anchor, it was where the actor with a mansion in Beverly Hills spent several months each year to plan and promote his artistic projects in the old hunting lodge. His sister Maria lived in the neighbouring house until her death in 2005. He documented her progressing dementia in a sensitive and respectful way in the much acclaimed film MEINE SCHWESTER MARIA (“My Sister Maria”, 2002).\n\nSchell also withdrew to the alpine pasture to prepare his documentary MARLENE in 1983. A project that inspired and fascinated him, as can be heard in the sound of his voice in the first few of the many hours of tape recordings of the conversation that belong to the estate. But it was also a project that brought him close to despair, because Marlene Dietrich had no intention of cooperating. She neither gave him permission to film her nor her apartment in Paris, where he spent six days conversing with her. Eventually, he ended the recordings prematurely: “Marlene Dietrich, it turned out, not only didn’t want to be filmed, she also didn’t want to give any information about herself and her films. She refused completely, which she kind of admits to later: “I was almost a bitch,” Werner Sudendorf quotes the legendary actress in his article published in the exhibition catalogue. The fact that Schell and his team succeeded in making an outstanding documentary film from the poor sound material, which contains few substantial statements by Marlene Dietrich, is an achievement that is highlighted in the exhibition in a special MARLENE room. A spatial installation hints at the bizarre interview situation in the Paris apartment which found Schell and Marlene Dietrich sat in the living room, while Schell’s team was only allowed to linger within earshot, without eye contact and always under the close observation of Dietrich’s agent, Terry Miller. The MARLENE room focuses on an audio compilation of the conversation lasting several minutes, which was marked by Marlene’s brusque replies, which more often culminated in the devastating exclamation “Alles Quatsch!” (“Complete nonsense!”)"
