        "text": "The actor died on Friday night in a clinic at Innsbruck after a “sudden and serious illness”. He had been treated for pneumonia earlier in the week.\n\nBrother of actress Maria Schell, he was a Hollywood favourite who starred in films on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nHis 1961 role as lawyer Hans Rolfe, who defends four Nazi judges on trial for sentencing innocent victims to death, won him an Oscar for best actor.\n\nHe also won a Golden Globe and New York Film Critics Circle award for the film, in which he starred alongside Marlene Dietrich and Burt Lancaster. Over the next 30 years, Schell appeared in many major films, including the 1977 war epic A Bridge Too Far. He was nominated for two more ­Oscars, in 1976 for best actor in The Man In The Glass Booth and in 1978 as best supporting actor in Julia.\n\nThe son of Swiss playwright Hermann Ferdinand Schell and Austrian actress Noe von Nordberg, Schell was born in Vienna on December 8, 1930, and raised in Switzerland after his family fled Germany’s annexation of Austria in 1938.\n\nHe made his stage debut in 1952 and appeared in German films before moving to Hollywood in 1958.\n\nHe won acclaim as a ­director for Marlene, his 1984 documentary on Dietrich, which was nominated for a best documentary Oscar.\n\nSchell was also a successful concert pianist and ­appeared in films including Deep Impact, The Freshman and Telling Lies In America in the Nineties."
