        "text": "Maximilian Schell, the ruggedly handsome Austrian-born actor who won an Academy Award for his role in “Judgment at Nuremberg,” died early Saturday in Innsbruck, Austria. He was 83.\n\nPatricia Baumbauer, his agent, confirmed his death to The Associated Press. She said he was hospitalized for a “sudden illness” but gave no more details.\n\nStanley Kramer’s “Judgment at Nuremberg” (1961), a drama recounting the Nazi war-crime trials in Germany, had an all-star cast, including Spencer Tracy, Judy Garland and Montgomery Clift. But Mr. Schell’s performance as the eloquent and ultimately furious German defense lawyer was the only one honored by the Academy. The film had begun on TV on “Playhouse 90.”\n\nHe went on to earn two more Oscar nominations, for the title role in “The Man in the Glass Booth” (1975), a drama inspired by the trial in Israel of the Holocaust criminal Adolf Eichmann, and “Julia” (1977), based on a Lillian Hellman story about the underground in Nazi Germany.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Mr. Schell became a director. Two of his films — “The Pedestrian” (1973), about a German businessman’s wartime past, and “Marlene” (1984), a documentary about Marlene Dietrich — received Oscar nominations. He also went on to direct opera, including “Der Rosenkavalier” for the Los Angeles Opera in 2005.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
