        "text": "Post by Leo_The_Last on\n\ncherry68\n\nAre you Swiss? Where do you live?\n\nYes, I am, at the moment living in the Northeast, close to the border to Austria. Well, my father is from deep down of the french speaking part of the country, with some french roots (and a little bit of german from his mother's side), my mother is Austrian. So yeah, I am \"characteristically\" Swiss. 😂\n\nYou're Italian, right? Ticino? Well, then you could call me a bastardo europeo. 😉\n\njimmalone\n\nAlways wanted to see this. Maybe they'll show it on one of the german or swiss channels these days.\n\nThey don't seem to, sadly. They show what they're showing anyway a thousand times a year. Fine films, ok, but this would have been a chance to shed light on one of the great forgotten movies of the 80's, as pacinoyes has pointed out. It's a prime example of a certain period of Swiss filmmaking during which it was able to compete with the cream of the crop of European cinema, especially with works from directors based in the Romandy, like Michel Soutter or particularly Claude Goretta and Alain Tanner, who are still alive, both of them born in 1929. Movies like The Lacemaker, If the Sun Never Returns, The Invitation, The Death of Mario Ricci, La provinciale, Messidor, The Salamander, Light Years Away, Jonas qui aura 25 ans en l'an 2000...\n\nGanz' death is really a great loss to European culture in general. What may not be that well known in the US, he was considered to be one of the finest actors on german speaking stages of the last couple of decades, almost certainly the one with the highest esteem, having been the bearer of the Iffland-Ring since 1996 (Brandauer could be another candidate). While I never had the chance to see him live, most of it was before my time, he shined there too, working with great ones like Bondy, Zadek, Handke (in film), Peymann, and of course his legendary collaborations with Peter Stein, including their monumental staging of Goethe's Faust (Parts I and II, uncut!!!) in 2000. I remember, being a kid, an early teenager and there was this big poster of that particular production behind me in the classroom, with his name at the top of it. 'Bruno Ganz'!!! That's the first thing I remember about him.\n\nHe was also set to work on a new adaptation of Golem, the folklore figure out of jewish culture, with director Dominik Graf (who I think is one of the finest working directors in German film, basically unknown abroad). I hope for a substantial part in Radegund, but I doubt it, if he's not going to be cut out of it entirely, he's probably just delivering something \"poetic\" in voice-over narration, orating about the bees and the trees and the flowers while looking mournfully into the distance or something like that.\n\nWhat I loved about Ganz was that whatever part he played, there was always something of himself in it. I have never believed that whole \"disappearing into the character\"-bullshit. Not that he didn't fully inhabit his roles, he did, but like most great actors, you could always feel the guy behind the performance. It was there in Wings of Desire as the angel who longs to be human, that mischievous smile, the hesitation in the way he talked, in the way he moved, like he always knew a little bit more than the rest of us about the splendor and the abyss of human existence.\n\nSo long, Bruno! Arrivederci, un bon voyage und mach's guat!\n\nPost by Leo_The_Last on\n\ncherry68\n\nI never heard the term bastardo europeo\n\nWell, that's understandable given that I made it up, writing in a fake Italian tongue. 😄 But I guess you know what I meant to say. Ti saluto con affetto. (I hope at least that was correct 😉)\n\njimmalone\n\nYes, Voss was Ganz' candidate, they also were the same age. Rehberg would have been a good choice, but he died a few months ago. But as the bearer of the ring, Ganz was obliged to have some alternatives, with the names written down in a sealed envelope. Of course, he could also have changed his mind a couple of times in recent years, who knows, would have been his right to do. It's all not that important, it's basically an arbitrary decision made by one person. But it's still fun to speculate and it's a nice appreciation for every actor.\n\nIt's funny, this whole bearer of the ring thing sounds like something out of Game of Thrones, or.... The Lord of the Rings.\n\nIt would be nice to see someone who already has a certain body of work behind him, so I would go with Brandauer (who is probably also one of the last iconic german speaking actors around after the deaths of Schell, George and others, apart from Adorf or Mueller-Stahl).\n\nUlrich Matthes could be a fine choice. Burghart Klaußner, Peter Simonischek, Ulrich Tukur... We'll see."
