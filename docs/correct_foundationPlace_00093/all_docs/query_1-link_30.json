        "text": "Last week at SaaStr Europa Kyle Poyar from OpenView proposed a new set of SaaS metrics (June 7 in London). Metrics are at the heart of the SaaS business. They are how we measure and tune the performance of our business model. At Ibbaka, one of the first things we do is help companies identify the key metric they are planning to improve with better pricing. The most common candidates are\n\nRecurring Revenue (Monthly or Annual - MRR or ARR)\n\nAverage Contract Value (ACV)\n\nNet Revenue Retention (NRR or NDR for Net Dollar Retention)\n\nLifetime Value of a Customer (LTV)\n\nRetention or its inverse Churn\n\nCustomer Acquisition Costs (CAC)\n\nWe can also get involved in improving pipeline metrics.\n\nOpportunity generation\n\nConversion rates\n\nPipeline velocity\n\nWhere do these metrics come from?\n\nA lot of these metrics came from the telecommunications industry and were initially applied to mobile phone subscriptions. The canonical source in the SaaS business is SaaS Metrics 2.0 – A Guide to Measuring and Improving what Matters from David Skok. If you have not read or reread this recently you may want to pause and do so now.\n\nKyle has shared his ideas on the next generation of SaaS metrics in two posts.\n\nSaaS Metrics 2.0: The Case For Next Era Metrics Playbook on OpenView\n\nYour guide to SaaS Metrics 2.0 on his Growth Unhinged Substack\n\nLet’s look a little deeper into why we need to change our approach to SaaS metrics.\n\nWhat is motivating a new approach to SaaS metrics?\n\nThere are a number of limitations to the standard SaaS metrics. They are well suited to a sales led growth motion, with a single pricing metric, that is applied to a time-based subscription.\n\nThis is not the world most SaaS companies live in today.\n\nMost companies now combine two or more growth motions (and they do not always lead with sales led growth).\n\nHybrid pricing metrics have been shown to drive faster revenue growth and provide more resilience than single factor pricing.\n\nSaaS package design has matured as companies move towards more articulated designs such as Good Better Best (GBB), platform with extensions, or structured product menus.\n\nBusiness pressure is leading SaaS companies to exploit more and more revenue streams.\n\nWith these changes have come a greater focus on Customer Experience (CX) and User Experience (UX). CX and UX have a big impact on how products are distributed to market, how people have adopted them to make them part of their work, and how value and use lead to expanded revenues.\n\nGrowth motion\n\nSales led growth remains the most common approach, according to Ibbaka research it is the leading motion for about 70% of SaaS companies, but other motions are growing in importance.\n\nOf these, the one getting the most attention is product led growth or PLG and it is the emergence of PLG as a central growth motion (and investment hypotheses) that has led Kyle to propose a new set of metrics.\n\nMost SaaS companies combine two growth motions. The most common combinations are product led growth and sales led growth, product led growth and community led growth and sales led growth and partner led growth.\n\nA new generation of SaaS metrics and pricing designs will need to support combined growth motions.\n\nPricing metric\n\nThe conventional SaaS metrics work best with single factor pricing. We know from work by Zuora and others that this is not the revenue growth optimizing design. Many companies are moving to hybrid pricing models (this was one of Kyle and my predictions for 2023) as they provide better opportunities to align price to value, more flexibility in a turbulent environment and generally more robust growth.\n\nOffer architectures (SaaS Packaging Patterns)\n\nPart of SaaS maturation is the emergence of a common set of packaging patterns. The simple One Big Package pattern is being complemented with many other patterns that enable better value delivery and value capture. Tiered or GBB packaging (Good Better Best) is popular at the moment but there are many options. SaaS metrics are going to have to track all of these packaging patterns and help us understand which pattern works best in different circumstances.\n\nRevenue streams\n\nThe conventional SaaS metrics are focussed on the subscription revenue stream. Most SaaS companies have additional revenue streams that they are trying to leverage. The obsession with subscription revenues (and the tendency of VCs to value a company based on a multiple of its forward subscription revenues) was really a belief that these revenues are predictable and high margin. Any revenue stream with these two properties is attractive and relevant to valuation.\n\nSome of the revenue streams that SaaS metrics will need to measure (and help to predict) are …\n\nTransactions (as these become predictable)\n\nGeneration (as generative AI absorbs more and more business processes)\n\nData services (as they become key to AI)\n\nProfessional services (to the extent these are high margin and predictable)\n\nOutcomes (as AI leads us towards outcome-based pricing)\n\nOne of the key questions to ask will be around revenue expansion opportunities. Net Revenue Retention is driven by six factors and revenue models that address all six will often generate the highest NRR.\n\nPositive factors\n\nGrow in package\n\nUpsell\n\nCross sell\n\nNegative factors\n\nChurn\n\nShrinkage in package\n\nDownsell\n\nSee Prioritizing NDR growth choices for more detail.\n\nCX and UX\n\nIn the new approach to SaaS metrics, leaders will steer their companies (and investors will evaluate them) on metrics that cover each stage of the customer journey.\n\nDiscover\n\nNew website vistors\n\nCommunity members (added by Ibbaka)\n\nLead generation by source/channel\n\nStart\n\nConversion from unique website (and other channels) visitor to lead\n\nActivate\n\nNew activations of the software (including freemium and free trial)\n\nCost per activation (as a more accurate metric than Customer Acquisition Costs)\n\nConvert\n\nCohorted (segmented) free-to-paid conversions\n\nProduct-influenced revenue (key to service led growth motions)\n\nSticky users (second order activations, upsells, conversions from free to paid)\n\nScale\n\nNorthstar usage metric (the metric that most correlates with value delivered)\n\nCohorted (segmented) gross and net revenue retention\n\nProduct Qualified Accounts (more than just Product Qualified Leads as insights from the product drive business growth beyond just the sale)\n\nValue to Customer (V2C) is the Missing Metric\n\nThere is something missing in all this. These new metrics are meant to get us more focussed on the customer and the user and to track how user interactions drive revenue growth. But most of us do not use software in order to generate a lot of clicks or usage data. We use software because we get value and companies buy software because they get value. The foundational metric is value delivered to the customer.\n\nDelivering value to customer (V2C) is the foundation to growing a SaaS business. If you are not measuring this you will not be able to execute on a long term growth strategy.\n\nOne way to connect usage to value is to measure value path completion rather than raw usage. A value path is a series of actions a user takes that concludes with something of value. Tracking value path completion is the first step to connecting use to value.\n\nSaaS pricing is increasingly model driven. The foundational model is the value model, a system of equations that estimates the impact you have on your customer’s business. The pricing model, another system of equations, can be derived from the value model.\n\nThe future of SaaS metrics should include the value our users and buyers are getting from the software we provide them and the communities and data built around our solutions."
