        "text": "What is the FOSS License Exception?\n\nCorizon's Free and Open Source Software (\"FOSS\") License Exception allows developers of FOSS applications to include Corizon software (like AgroSense, Logisense etc) libraries in their FOSS applications. Corizon Libraries are typically licensed pursuant to version 3 of the General Public License (\"GPL\"), but this exception permits distribution of certain Libraries with a developerâs FOSS applications licensed under the terms of another FOSS license listed below, even though such other FOSS license may be incompatible with the GPL.\n\nThe following terms and conditions describe the circumstances under which Corizon's FOSS License Exception applies.\n\nCorizon's FOSS License Exception Terms and Conditions\n\n1. Definitions.\n\n\"Derivative Work\" means a derivative work, as defined under applicable copyright law, formed entirely from the Program and one or more FOSS Applications.\n\n\"FOSS Application\" means a free and open source software application distributed subject to a license listed in the section below titled \"FOSS License List.\"\n\n\"FOSS Notice\" means a notice placed by Corizon in a copy of the Libraries stating that such copy of the Libraries may be distributed under Corizon's or FOSS License Exception.\n\n\"Independent Work\" means portions of the Derivative Work that are not derived from the Program and can reasonably be considered independent and separate works.\n\n\"Program\" means a copy of Corizon's Libraries that contain a FOSS Notice.\n\n2. A FOSS application developer (\"you\" or \"your\") may distribute a Derivative Work provided that you and the Derivative Work meet all of the following conditions:\n\n1. You obey the GPL in all respects for the Program and all portions (including modifications) of the Program included in the Derivative Work (provided that this condition does not apply to Independent Works);\n\n2. The Derivative Work does not include any work licensed under the GPL other than the Program;\n\n3. You distribute Independent Works subject to a license listed in the section below titled \"FOSS License List\";\n\n4. You distribute Independent Works in object code or executable form with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code on the same medium and under the same FOSS license applying to the object code or executable forms;\n\n5. All works that are aggregated with the Program or the Derivative Work on a medium or volume of storage are not derivative works of the Program, Derivative Work or FOSS Application, and must reasonably be considered independent and separate works.\n\n3. Corizon reserves all rights not expressly granted in these terms and conditions. If all of the above conditions are not met, then this FOSS License Exception does not apply to you or your Derivative Work.\n\nFOSS License List\n\nLicense Name Version(s)/Copyright Date\n\nRelease Early Certified Software\n\nAcademic Free License 2.0\n\nApache Software License 1.0/1.1/2.0\n\nApple Public Source License 2.0\n\nArtistic license From Perl 5.8.0\n\nBSD license \"July 22 1999\"\n\nCommon Development and Distribution License (CDDL) 1.0\n\nCommon Public License 1.0\n\nEclipse Public License 1.0\n\nGNU Library or \"Lesser\" General Public License (LGPL) 2.0/2.1/3.0\n\nJabber Open Source License 1.0\n\nMIT License (As listed in file MIT-License.txt) -\n\nMozilla Public License (MPL) 1.0/1.1\n\nOpen Software License 2.0\n\nOpenSSL license (with original SSLeay license) \"2003\" (\"1998\")\n\nPHP License 3.0/3.01\n\nPython license (CNRI Python License) -\n\nPython Software Foundation License 2.1.1\n\nSleepycat License \"1999\"\n\nUniversity of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License -\n\nW3C License \"2001\"\n\nX11 License \"2001\"\n\nZlib/libpng License -\n\nZope Public License 2.0\n\nFAQ\n\nQ1: What are the benefits of the FOSS License Exception?\n\nA: The FOSS License Exception permits use of the GPL-licensed Libraries with software applications licensed under certain other FOSS licenses without causing the entire derivative work to be subject to the GPL.\n\nQ2: Does the FOSS License Exception apply to all Corizon software products?\n\nA: No. The FOSS License Exception only applies to software with the FOSS exception explicitly mentioned in it's license. Typically this is the case for all open source libraries published by Corizon\n\nQ3: Can an open source software project combine and distribute any of Corizon's GPL-licensed software with other open source software under the FOSS License Exception?\n\nA: Open source software projects and other developers are free to use and distribute GPL-licensed software with other open source software as long as they comply with the terms of the GPL. Open source software projects and other developers can also use and distribute open source applications with the GPL-licensed Client Libraries under the terms of the FOSS License Exception without causing the entire derivative work to be subject to the GPL.\n\nThe FOSS License Exception only applies to software licensed under the FOSS licenses listed in the section above titled âFOSS License Listâ, and only with respect to use and distribution of Corizon's Libraries.\n\nQ4: Can commercial OEMs, ISVs or VARs combine and distribute commercial products with Corizon's GPL-licensed Client Libraries under the FOSS License Exception?\n\nA: Distributors of commercial products that combine GPL-licensed Client Libraries with commercially licensed software (i.e., software not licensed under a FOSS license) must comply with the terms of the GPL. This includes use and distribution of the GPL-licensed Libraries. The FOSS License Exception does not apply with respect to products licensed under any license other than the FOSS licenses listed in the section above titled âFOSS License List.â\n\nQ5: What should a developer of a Derivative Work do if it wants to distribute the Derivative Work under the GPL?\n\nA: A developer may choose to distribute a copy of a Derivative Work exclusively under the terms of the GPL at any time by removing the FOSS License Exception notice from that copy of the Program and including appropriate GPL notices."
