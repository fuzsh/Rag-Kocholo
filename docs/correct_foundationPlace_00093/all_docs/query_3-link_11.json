It uses AI to provide legal, sales, procurement and other stakeholders with clear and actionable insight into the risks and opportunities in the documents they are being asked to review and sign—before it's too late to negotiate better terms.These issues were quantified in recent studies. In one*, almost half the companies surveyed faced significant risks as they couldn't easily detect problematic language in contracts. In another survey, a third of companies said contracts take an average of over 30 hours to negotiate. And 65% experienced delays in closing deals as a result of contract management challenges.Analyzer works by breaking down an incoming agreement into individual clauses, which it can recognize by type using a combination of AI technologies. It then conducts a detailed risk-assessment based on the organization's own legal and business standards, delivering the results in easy-to-understand scorecards available within Microsoft Word, Microsoft Outlook, and DocuSign's contract lifecycle management (CLM) solution. Analyzer also simplifies the editing process with single-click access to recommended replacement language from an intelligent library of pre-approved clauses.\n\n31.

Druva’s direct-to-cloud architecture, which eliminates redundant copies and infrastructure, allows organizations to protect, manage, and maximize the value of unstructured data with greater simplicity and lower costs. Unstructured data is a critical component to business operations, representing more than 80 percent of the total data stored in enterprise storage systems, but managing this rapidly growing data source through its life cycle has become increasingly complex and expensive. According to a recent IDC survey, 40 percent of businesses expect unstructured datasets to grow between 30-49 percent over the next two years, while more than one-third of participants indicated that this data is currently retained “forever”. Organizations routinely maintain multiple copies of a dataset, including versions for short-term recovery and off-site copies for resiliency, long-term retention, compliance and more, which increases the cost of storing and managing data. As CIOs increasingly focus on moving data and business services to the cloud to increase organizational agility and resilience, Druva now offers the industry’s only direct-to-cloud solution which can seamlessly backup and archive unstructured data without the need to configure, integrate and manage cloud storage tiers.\n\n32.

The Oracle Cloud Observability and Management Platform is available in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and is the industry’s most complete solution, consisting of a suite of services that provide a unified view across the entire software stack. It enables easy diagnostics of cloud-native and traditional technologies deployed in the cloud or on-premises.

The platform has adopted an open, standards-based approach that is vendor-agnostic, supporting ecosystem interoperability out-of-the-box with Slack, Grafana, Twilio, PagerDuty and others. Customers’ IT environments have evolved rapidly, but existing monitoring and management offerings have not kept up with the increasing complexity found with multicloud and on-premises IT environments. In fact, Gartner estimates that more than a third of organizations use 30 or more monitoring tools.[i] Organizations have experienced a rise in the complexity and cost of managing their existing infrastructure and a growing number of emerging technologies such as Kubernetes, containers, converged databases, and microservices. Instead of a collection of siloed and fragmented tools, the Oracle Cloud Observability and Management Platform provides customers with a comprehensive and connected solution comprised of related services.

Built on the industry’s leading Rave EDC (electronic data capture) platform already in use at more clinical research sites globally than any other system, myMedidata LIVE gives researchers and patients a way to engage in remote site visits within the platform of site and patient-facing technologies they are already using on the study. myMedidata is Medidata’s newly released patient portal solution that provides patients with virtual access to all of their study needs in a single web application. It is built using responsive design principles -- as well as input from Medidata’s Patient Insights team, a group of patients and patient advocates -- and made to be accessible from any device with an internet connection. Particularly relevant during the current COVID-19 pandemic when in-person visits might be restricted, myMedidata LIVE video visits between patients and sites can replace scheduled site-based appointments and allow the study team to complete its data entry in Rave while the patients remain engaged offsite through myMedidata.The latest version of myMedidata also includes two other important clinical tools, which have been redesigned for virtual use and can now be used through the web with a patient’s myMedidata account: myMedidata eConsent and myMedidata eCOA (clinical outcomes assessment). Both tools give sites the ability to maintain a consistent and traceable process, since they are directly integrated with Rave EDC, and use the same advanced, trusted technology previously accessed through the eConsent and eCOA apps. In addition, myMedidata eConsent now provides patients the opportunity to learn about and consent to clinical trials at home or at a remote location, and myMedidata eCOA easily and accurately captures patient outcomes.\n\n48.
