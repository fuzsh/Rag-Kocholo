About Squid, this FAQ, and other Squid information resources\n\n1.1 What is Squid?\n\nSquid is a high-performance proxy caching server for web clients, supporting FTP, gopher, and HTTP data objects. Unlike traditional caching software, Squid handles all requests in a single, non-blocking, I/O-driven process.\n\nSquid keeps meta data and especially hot objects cached in RAM, caches DNS lookups, supports non-blocking DNS lookups, and implements negative caching of failed requests.\n\nSquid supports SSL, extensive access controls, and full request logging. By using the lightweight Internet Cache Protocol, Squid caches can be arranged in a hierarchy or mesh for additional bandwidth savings.\n\nSquid consists of a main server program squid, a Domain Name System lookup program dnsserver, some optional programs for rewriting requests and performing authentication, and some management and client tools. When squid starts up, it spawns a configurable number of dnsserver processes, each of which can perform a single, blocking Domain Name System (DNS) lookup. This reduces the amount of time the cache waits for DNS lookups.\n\nSquid is derived from the ARPA-funded Harvest project.\n\n1.2 What is Internet object caching?\n\nInternet object caching is a way to store requested Internet objects (i.e., data available via the HTTP, FTP, and gopher protocols) on a system closer to the requesting site than to the source. Web browsers can then use the local Squid cache as a proxy HTTP server, reducing access time as well as bandwidth consumption.\n\n1.3 Why is it called Squid?\n\nHarris' Lament says, ``All the good ones are taken.\"\n\nWe needed to distinguish this new version from the Harvest cache software. Squid was the code name for initial development, and it stuck.\n\n1.4 What is the latest version of Squid?\n\nSquid is updated often; please see the Squid home page for the most recent versions.\n\n1.5 Who is responsible for Squid?\n\nSquid is the result of efforts by numerous individuals from the Internet community. Duane Wessels of the National Laboratory for Applied Network Research (funded by the National Science Foundation) leads code development. Please see the CONTRIBUTORS file for a list of our excellent contributors.\n\n1.6 Where can I get Squid?\n\nYou can download Squid via FTP from the primary FTP site or one of the many worldwide mirror sites.\n\nMany sushi bars also have Squid.\n\n1.7 What Operating Systems does Squid support?\n\nThe software is designed to operate on any modern Unix system, and is known to work on at least the following platforms:\n\nLinux\n\nFreeBSD\n\nNetBSD\n\nBSDI\n\nOSF and Digital Unix\n\nIRIX\n\nSunOS/Solaris\n\nNeXTStep\n\nSCO Unix\n\nAIX\n\nHP-UX\n\nOS/2\n\nFor more specific information, please see platforms.html. If you encounter any platform-specific problems, please let us know by sending email to squid-bugs.\n\n1.8 Does Squid run on Windows NT?\n\nRecent versions of Squid will compile and run on Windows/NT with the GNU-Win32 package.\n\nLogiSense has ported Squid to Windows NT and sells a supported version. You can also download the source from their FTP site. Thanks to LogiSense for making the code available as required by the GPL terms.\n\nRobert Collins is working on a Windows NT port as well. You can find more information from him at his page.\n\n1.9 What Squid mailing lists are available?\n\nsquid-users@ircache.net: general discussions about the Squid cache software. Subscribe via squid-users-request@ircache.net. Previous messages are available for browsing at the Squid Users Archive, and also at theaimsgroup.com.\n\nsquid-users-digest: digested (daily) version of above. Subscribe via squid-users-digest-request@ircache.net.\n\nsquid-announce@ircache.net: A receive-only list for announcements of new versions. Subscribe via squid-announce-request@ircache.net.\n\nsquid-bugs@ircache.net: A closed list for sending us bug reports. Bug reports received here are given priority over those mentioned on squid-users.\n\nsquid@ircache.net: A closed list for sending us feed-back and ideas.\n\nsquid-faq@ircache.net: A closed list for sending us feed-back, updates, and additions to the Squid FAQ.\n\nWe also have a few other mailing lists which are not strictly Squid-related.\n\ncache-snmp@ircache.net: A public list for discussion of Web Caching and SNMP issues and developments. Eventually we hope to put forth a standard Web Caching MIB.\n\nicp-wg@ircache.net: Mostly-idle mailing list for the nonexistent ICP Working Group within the IETF. It may be resurrected some day, you never know!\n\n1.10 I can't figure out how to unsubscribe from your mailing list.\n\nAll of our mailing lists have ``-request'' addresses that you must use for subscribe and unsubscribe requests. To unsubscribe from the squid-users list, you send a message to squid-users-request@ircache.net and in the subject and/or body of your message, you put the magic word ``unsubscribe.''\n\n1.11 What Squid web pages are available?\n\nSeveral Squid and Caching-related web pages are available:\n\nThe Squid home page for information on the Squid software\n\nThe IRCache Mesh gives information on our operational mesh of caches.\n\nThe Squid FAQ (uh, you're reading it).\n\nOskar's Squid Users Guide.\n\nThe Information Resource Caching FAQ\n\nSquid Programmers Guide. Yeah, its extremely incomplete. I assure you this is the most recent version.\n\nWeb Caching Reading list\n\nSquid-1.0 Release Notes\n\nSquid-1.1 Release Notes\n\nTutorial on Configuring Hierarchical Squid Caches\n\nRFC 2186 ICPv2 -- Protocol\n\nRFC 2187 ICPv2 -- Application\n\nRFC 1016\n\n1.12 Does Squid support SSL?\n\nSquid can proxy SSL requests. By default, Squid will forward all SSL requests directly to their origin servers. In firewall configurations, Squid will forward all SSL requests to one other proxy, defined with the ssl_proxy directive.\n\n1.13 What's the legal status of Squid?\n\nSquid is copyrighted by the University of California San Diego. Squid uses some code developed by others.\n\nSquid is Free Software.\n\nSquid is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License.\n\n1.14 Is Squid year-2000 compliant?\n\nWe think so. Squid uses the Unix time format for all internal time representations. Potential problem areas are in printing and parsing other time representations. We have made the following fixes in to address the year 2000:\n\ncache.log timestamps use 4-digit years instead of just 2 digits.\n\nparse_rfc1123() assumes years less than \"70\" are after 2000.\n\nparse_iso3307_time() checks all four year digits.\n\nYear-2000 fixes were applied to the following Squid versions:\n\nsquid-2.1: Year parsing bug fixed for dates in the \"Wed Jun 9 01:29:59 1993 GMT\" format (Richard Kettlewell).\n\nsquid-1.1.22: Fixed likely year-2000 bug in ftpget's timestamp parsing (Henrik Nordstrom).\n\nsquid-1.1.20: Misc fixes (Arjan de Vet).\n\nPatches:\n\nRichard's lib/rfc1123.c patch. If you are still running 1.1.X, then you should apply this patch to your source and recompile.\n\nHenrik's src/ftpget.c patch.\n\nArjan's lib/rfc1123.c patch.\n\nSquid-2.2 and earlier versions have a New Year bug. This is not strictly a Year-2000 bug; it would happen on the first day of any year.\n\n1.15 Can I pay someone for Squid support?\n\nYep. Please see the commercial support page.\n\n1.16 Squid FAQ contributors\n\nThe following people have made contributions to this document:\n\nJonathan Larmour\n\nCord Beermann\n\nTony Sterrett\n\nGerard Hynes\n\nKatayama, Takeo\n\nDuane Wessels\n\nK Claffy\n\nPaul Southworth\n\nOskar Pearson\n\nOng Beng Hui\n\nTorsten Sturm\n\nJames R Grinter\n\nRodney van den Oever\n\nKolics Bertold\n\nCarson Gaspar\n\nMichael O'Reilly\n\nHume Smith\n\nRichard Ayres\n\nJohn Saunders\n\nMiquel van Smoorenburg\n\nDavid J N Begley\n\nKevin Sartorelli\n\nAndreas Doering\n\nMark Visser\n\ntom minchin\n\nJens-S.

This document is available in HTML, compressed Postscript, and plain text.\n\nWant to contribute? Please write in SGML...\n\nIt is easier for us if you send us text which is close to \"correct\" SGML. The SQUID FAQ currently uses the LINUXDOC DTD. Its probably easiest to follow examples in the this file. Here are the basics:\n\nUse the <url> tag for links, instead of HTML <A HREF ...>\n\n<url url=\"http://www.squid-cache.org\" name=\"Squid Home Page\">\n\nUse <em> for emphasis, config options, and pathnames:\n\n<em>usr/local/squid/etc/squid.conf</em> <em/cache_peer/\n\nHere is how you do lists:\n\n<itemize> <item>foo <item>bar </itemize>\n\nUse <verb>, just like HTML's <PRE> to show unformatted text.\n\nNext Previous Contents"
