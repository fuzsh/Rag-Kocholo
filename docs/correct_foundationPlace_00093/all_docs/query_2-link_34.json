        "text": "Yesterday\n\nPast days\n\nSearch\n\nAbout the DB\n\nTuesday, June 21, 2005\n\nLooking back a quarter-century\n\nArrivals of 1980 -- and 1970\n\nHealth conference draws many from UW\n\nEditor:\n\nChris Redmond\n\ncredmond@uwaterloo.ca\n\nSummer solstice celebrations\n\nInterim dean of the faculty of environmental studies is Ellsworth LeDrew, who will serve in that role a little longer. Appointed last year, he was to end his term June 30, but the provost announced yesterday that LeDrew \"has agreed to extend his term\" to December 31 \"to allow the Nominating Committee for the Dean of Environmental Studies additional time to continue the search process\".\n\nLooking back a quarter-century\n\nThe year was 1980. \"It will be good to have some mud on campus again,\" said UW president Burt Matthews when he signed the construction contract for Environmental Studies II. It would be the university's first new building in a decade.\n\nThe year was 1980. Joe Clark gave way to Pierre Trudeau (again) as prime minister of Canada, Matthews was about to give way to Doug Wright as president of UW, and the university's total spending passed $100 million in a year for the first time. Students protested the annual increase in tuition fees, even as it was announced that Ontario had fallen to last place among Canada's ten provinces in its level of funding for universities.\n\nThe year was 1980, and Andrew Cooper was arriving at UW to teach political science, Sharon Adams to help run the department of English (she'd later move to planning and then psychology), Connie Hutcheson to assist UW's first director of fund-raising. Pam Waechter was new in the co-op and career services department in Needles Hall, Laurie Hoffman-Goetz was new in health studies, and Katrina Maugham (later Di Gravio) was new in the personnel (later human resources) department in Administrative Services (later Matthews Hall).\n\nAnd it all happened 25 years ago. Almost 70 staff and faculty members who were new at UW during 1980 are still here, and will be the guests of honour tonight as they mingle in the Physical Activities Complex with those who came in earlier years. It's the glittering annual reception for UW's 25-Year Club.\n\nSome notes on UW life in 1980, as recalled by Simon the Troll in his history of the university, Water Under the Bridge:\n\n\"Good times? Sure they were good times, in their way, especially when Burt Matthews, the president, announced that next year's budget cut would be smaller than this year's. . . . They were good times in Canada as a whole; inflation was high, but the recession of the early eighties hadn't hit yet, and unemployment was lower than it's been since. Ray Wieser, who was director of coordination (you'd say 'director of co-op' now), was embarrassed to have to announce that so many employers had shown up, he had 4,000 jobs he couldn't fill one term. Canada was on a roll, in spite of a few bad feelings over the boycott of the Moscow Olympics. Voters in Qu√©bec said no that summer to sovereignty-association. . . .\n\n\"Canada was, in fact, the toast of the world, and especially of the United States, for much of 1980, when it became known that this country's consul in Tehran, Ken Taylor, had helped a dozen American diplomats escape from Iran at the beginning of what came to be known as the \"hostage crisis\". Americans grasped any opportunity to say thank you to Canadians: some folks at the University of Kentucky phoned Ted Dixon of Waterloo's physics department, the only Canadian they knew, to express their gratitude, and a thank-you note arrived at the UW library from colleagues at Pennsylvania State. . . .\n\n\"It was the first year most people heard about 'sexual harassment' as a problem on campuses, and it was the year that 'programmable calculators' got to be common enough that the university senate discussed when and whether students should be allowed to bring them into exams. Technological progress never stops: the 13-year-old IBM 360/75 computer was unplugged that year.\"\n\nNew chair: Paul Parker will become chair of the department of geography on July 1, taking over from Phil Howarth. Parker is a specialist in economic development and in energy and environmental issues, and has been involved in establishing UW's Residential Energy Efficiency Project.\n\nArrivals of 1980 -- and 1970\n\nHere's a list of the people who will be joining the 25-Year Club today to mark 25 years of UW service:\n\nSharon Adams, psychology; Lorraine Albrecht, earth sciences; Mary Jane Bauer, planning; Maria Bayliss, registrar; Janet Bender, library; Bonnie Bender-Vargas, registrar; Colleen Bernard, engineering undergrad office; Michael Borkowski, IST; David Bowen, science technical services; Scott Calder, athletics; Janice Campbell, chemistry; David Canzi, IST; Elaine Carpenter, parking; Debbie Clermont, optometry; Nancy Coles, applied math; Thomas Connolly, plant operations; Patricia Cook, environmental studies; Andrew Cooper, political science; Mieke Delfgaauw-Kesik, environmental studies; Katrina Di Gravio, human resources;\n\nCarol Donaghey, graphics; John English, history; Timothy Farrell, IST; Donald Fraser, engineering undergraduate office; Maureen Fraser, English; Philip Frowd, plant operations; Lew Gilmore, chemistry; Ian Goulden, combinatorics and optimization; Karen Hammond, planning; Laurie Hanley, registrar; Lesley Hartley, fine arts; Erin Harvey, statistics and actuarial science; Richard Hecktus, chemical engineering; Laurie Hoffman-Goetz, health studies and gerontology; Sheila Hurley, safety;\n\nConnie Hutcheson, development and alumni affairs; Katherine Jackson, chemistry; Moiya Jalsevac, library; Anne Jenson, electrical and computer engineering; Laurie Jones, kinesiology; Yvonne Kingsbury, optometry; Derek Kirkland, IST; Wing-Ki Liu, physics; Jane McGeoch, environmental studies; Avril McVicar, distance and continuing education; Carol Ann Olheiser, co-op education and career services; Harry Panjer, statistics and actuarial science; Barbara Robbins, housing and residences; Kenneth Robertson, optometry; Hilda Rottine, plant operations; Caryl Russell, kinesiology; Frank Ruszer, co-operative education and career services; Frank Safayeni, management sciences; Judith Silvestri, co-operative education and career services; Ann Simpson, Student Life Centre;\n\nJohn Sitler, library; Betty Toews, financial services; Jim Tremain, biology; Peter Tytko, central stores; Elizabeth Vinnicombe, research office; Pamela Waechter, co-operative education and career services; Janet Waite, biology; Teresa Walker, human resources; Frederick Widall, IST; Rita Wiebe, math C-and-D; Lina Wong, library; Charles Woods, library; Jean Zadilsky, research office; Karen Zehr, graduate studies.\n\nAnd those who arrived in 1970, joined the club ten years ago, and will be honoured again tonight for 35 years of service:\n\nJames Brandon, physics; Steve Breen, IST; Trudi Bunting, geography; Scott Charles, audio-visual; James (Allan) Cheyne, psychology; Lynda Connolly, environment and resource studies; William Futher, IST; Betty Graf, library; Nancy Heimpel, library; Arthur Hills, computer science computing facility; Roy Hinsperger, plant operations; Roslyn Keller, library; Stanley Lipshitz, applied mathematics; June Lowe, engineering undergraduate office;\n\nRoger Lycke, IST; Colin Mayfield, biology; Frederick McCourt, chemistry; Judy McTaggart, library; Janet-Lynn Metz, co-operative education and career services; Bonita Neglia-Tschirhart, civil engineering; Carolyn Nelson, faculty of arts; James Parrott, library; Susan Phillips, geography; Carmen Roecker, registrar; Ingrid Schugardt, athletics and recreational services; Reinhold Schuster, civil engineering and architecture; Stanley Shantz, central stores; Jan Uhde, fine arts; Bruce Uttley, IST; Pam Van Allen, faculty of science; Ian Williams, kinesiology; Peter Woolstencroft, political science.\n\nCall for nominations\n\nNominations are requested from full-time staff of the University to fill one staff seat on the Board of Governors, term to April 30, 2008.

The annual meeting and conference of the Canadian Federation of Biological Societies will be held Tuesday to Friday at the University of Guelph. It is expected to draw almost 400 people from universities, research centres, government and industry.\n\nThe theme of the event is \"Lifestyle and Molecular Bases of Health and Disease: Cardiovascular Health, Diabetes, Exercise, Nutrition and Obesity\". \"This year's theme is very topical and the meeting will attract scientists and graduate students from across the life sciences,\" said Rhona Hanning, UW health studies and gerontology professor, who is a member of the conference's local organizing committee. Jay Thomson of the kinesiology department is also serving on that committee.\n\nThe four-day event will feature discussions led by experts in topics such as lifestyles and heart health, eating and exercise, nutrition and metabolism, obesity and type-2 diabetes, and nutrigenomics, or how diet affects gene expression.\n\nRichard Hughson and James Rush, both of the kinesiology department, will give presentations at separate symposiums on Wednesday. Hughson will discuss \"Theories and Findings of Metabolic Control at the Onset of Exercise,\" while Rush will talk about \"Endothelial Molecular and Functional Adaptations to Exercise.\"\n\nRetired professor Bruce Holub of Guelph will receive the Gordin Kaplan Award to recognize his efforts in educating the public about health aspects of dietary omega-3 and trans fatty acids. He will speak on \"Good Fats, Bad Fats and Heart Health\" at a public lecture, on Wednesday, at 6:30 p.m. in Rozanski Hall. For more than 10 years, Holub has been telling government and industry about the risks of trans fats. His warnings have helped result in the recent push to label trans fats in foods and the adoption by food companies of trans-free processing techniques.\n\nAt a session to be held on Wednesday, Mark Tremblay, scientific adviser with Statistics Canada, will discuss the Canadian Health Measures Survey, a large-scale project intended to assess the health of Canadians beginning this year. On Friday, another symposium will discuss changes to recommended daily allowances, or so-called \"dietary reference intakes,\" of nutrients in the diet.\n\nPoster sessions and exhibits will take place during the conference in Guelph's Peter Clark Hall. The conference is the premier annual event of the CFBS, which consists of 14 societies of biologists and life scientists in disciplines such as biophysics and biochemistry, cell biology, physiology, immunology, nutritional science, genetics, pharmacology, toxicology and zoology.\n\nCAR"
