        "text": "There were many questions from the community during the webinar, and we did not get to all of them, so here are the questions and our answers.\n\nCould these ranges could be slightly different by stage of the company? i.e. does early stage have a slightly lower or maybe slightly higher NRR?\n\nYes. There are some common patterns that we see.\n\nEarly on, NRR is often low, below 100%, as the company works on product market fit. As product market fit improves, and the company get better at selling to its ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) NRR will go up. Early-stage companies also tend to have simple package architectures that do not support upsell or a single pricing metric that does not allow for growth in package.\n\nAs companies mature and differentiate their product they generally address these shortcomings. NRR improves, generally going above 100%. For enterprise, best of class companies have NRR of more than 120%. This can be more difficult to achieve for companies selling to SMBs or individuals as the opportunities for in customer growth are more limited.\n\nBut eventually, the market becomes saturated. Companies have maximized their share of wallets, and new alternatives have begun to nibble at their market. At this point, NRR will trend down. It is still important to maintain NRR above 105%, preferably 110%.\n\nNot even Snowflake will have an NRR above 130% forever.\n\nAre you going to cover what comprises/drives NRR and to what degree?\n\nNRR is determined by the six factors, three positive, three negative described above. There are different patterns possible. For example, here are three companies, all with NRR of 106% and churn of 7%.\n\nSee Pricing and NRR: The Six Factors to Manage.\n\nExample one, high churn and high package growth, gets most of its lift from in-package growth of 15%. There are some companies, like Snowflake, that are able to exceed this for prolonged periods. Even with shrinkage at some customers, it has a net in package growth of 13%. Churn chews up 7% of this leaving NRR at 106%. This company may want to look at introducing a GBB architecture or finding opportunities for cross-sell.\n\nExample two is more of a mixed bag with in-package growth (+10% -2% for net +8%) and upsell (+3% -2% for net +1%) both contributing. Balance is good, but this company should pick either package growth, upsell, or cross-sell and concentrate on tweaking packaging and pricing to get an improvement.\n\nExample three is the inverse of example one. It has no growth in package (probably because it has no usage metric) and relies on upsell to drive NRR. In this case, the introduction of a usage metric could have a big impact on NRR performance.\n\nTo manage NRR you need to understand the underlying dynamics for your own company. Two companies with identical NRR may require very different strategies and tactics.\n\nDoes repricing (price increase) count as “growth?”\n\nAbsolutely yes. In a podcast with Mark Stiving, not yet released, he took me to task for not including price increase as a way to improve NRR.\n\nIn fact, price increases or decreases could increase NRR, depending on the market dynamics and the pricing design.\n\nIf revenue gained from a price increase will more than offset increased churn, decreased use, or down-sell, then that can be one way to increase NRR. If a price decrease leads to enough expansion in use, and you have a usage-based pricing metric, that could also lead to higher NRR.\n\nIt is always worth considering a price change and having a process in place to explore the impact of price changes. One should consider a price change at least every year, and in some markets as often as every quarter, or even every month.\n\nIn situations in which you see that a product might be at the top of the market for price but lower comparably for product value - which of these growth levers would you recommend the most for improving NRR?\n\nIf the value ratio is pushing the upper boundary, which is generally 30%, then the thing to do is to innovate to increase differentiation value. The value ratio is the percentage of differentiation value claimed back in price. For new, untested products, it can be as low as 5%, for mature products where the value is well documented and understood, 30% is generally an upper limit.\n\nThe NRR formula suggests that 1% of growth equals 1% of retention improvement, but looking at the LTV formula, a 1% of retention improvement is far more valuable than 1% of growth - could you please comment?\n\nIt is not quite that simple. One percent of NRR means one percent of total recurring revenue, and this is worth, in terms of equity, somewhere between 3X and 30X in value (probably close to 3X in the current market for companies with ho-hum growth rates or lower-than-average operating margins).\n\nCustomer Lifetime Value (LTV) does not map directly to equity value for most companies (perhaps it should) is a measure of the value of retention over multiple years, while NRR is calculated one year at a time, so one would expect the LTV calculation to be larger than an equivalent NRR calculation.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts on best practices for transitioning pricing models. Specifically from seat-based to usage-based or feature-based pricing for an early-stage company ($7k-$40k ACV).\n\nThis is a big topic in its own right, too big to address here.\n\nA few thoughts though.\n\nChange prices and pricing metrics when introducing new, valuable functionality and/or when repackaging.\n\nSegment your customer base by value delivered, and value captured. Each segment will need a different approach.\n\nCommunicate early and often.\n\nBe transparent, explain how you derived the new pricing.\n\nBe fair, show that the new pricing is a fair distribution of value between the parties involved.\n\nThe below diagram shows how the current customer base can be segmented for price changes and migration to a new packaging and pricing model.\n\nCommunity-led growth happens when users and other stakeholders form a community and encourage others to join the community and adopt the solution. Open-source products and companies grow primarily through community-led growth. Microsoft has historically done a great job building and supporting a developer community. Today, Hugging Face is building, and monetizing, a community of people committed to building and using artificial intelligence.\n\nCould you pick 2-3 insights or recommendations for companies that are not in pure SaaS but are growing their recurring revenue (vs transactional) and therefore should learn from SaaS?\n\nThe most important thing is to take Net Revenue Retention seriously.\n\nMeasure NRR\n\nHave targets for each NRR factor\n\nHave a leader accountable for NRR performance and give them a team\n\nArchitect the solution so that different NRR factors can be leveraged (if you cannot take advantage of at least one, preferably two, of the factors then NRR will necessarily be less than 100%)\n\nInvest in customer success and make customer success accountable for delivering value\n\nAny impact on freemium vs. free trial and NRR performance?\n\nWe did not explore this explicitly in the survey, but it is a very good question.\n\nFreemium can draw users away from the paid tiers, but it can also build a community of users and data that provide value for paid users.\n\nA good free trial program helps you screen out users who will not get value, and this can improve retention numbers. It also helps to set the right expectations as people enter the software and begin to use it.\n\nOne tactic that may help with upsell is the reverse trial. In a reverse trial, one starts by giving all the power (and value) of the top tier, and then lets the buyer select down."
