Many modern businesses are still burdened by inefficient, outdated methods for collecting payments.\n\nA streamlined automation solution for accounts receivables cuts down on the time needed for manual processing, freeing up accounting staff to focus on higher priorities. Automating the payment cycle and managing payments efficiently can reduce input errors, missed opportunities for upselling, and a disorganized payment process.

Maintain up-to-date customer information\n\nMaking sure your customer information is accurate ensures timely payments, which is the foundation of your business.

Set clear payment terms\n\nSetting payment terms in advance is a simple, yet effective way to prevent invoicing problems, payment disputes, and late payments.\n\nYou should document all the agreed payment terms in writing and sign off on them before doing any business. This can serve as a legally binding record that you have a right to enforce.\n\nIf both parties are clear on all aspects of the deal, there will be no problems down the road. Here are some things to include in your payment policy:\n\nInvoicing date\n\nPayment methods accepted\n\nConsequences of late payment including fees and interest charges, and\n\nRewards if any for early payment\n\n3. Offer multiple payment methods\n\nThere are numerous payment options you can use to collect payments from your customers. The type of payment you accept will be dependent on your business and customer base.\n\nBusiness owners of all types and sizes should be thinking about the best ways for customers to pay them. And, what would be the best for your business? With so many payment methods out there, you'll want to consider what your customers prefer. Make it easier for customers to pay you by offering multiple payment methods. A recurring billing provider like LogiSense can help ensure that your business is accepting payments based on your customers' preferences.\n\n4. Ensure accurate invoicing\n\nYour customers want clarity about what they are paying for, so your invoices should be easy to understand. It should also include the details of their usage and billing clearly to avoid any disputes that cause delays in payments. You should also ensure there are no invoicing errors and missing information to make the process as seamless as possible.\n\nMake sure you include the following information in your invoice to ensure you get paid on time:\n\nItemized list of invoiced items\n\nIssuing date\n\nBill due date\n\nBilling breakdown\n\nUsage/ Consumption Summary\n\nTaxation breakdown\n\nPayment method accepted\n\nRemittance advice and other relevant information you customer will need (like PO number) on the invoice for quick references\n\nLate penalty if any\n\nDate when they will be billed next\n\nInvoice Adjustment\n\nCredits/Refunds\n\n5. Automate collections process\n\nEliminate the stress and time spent in the collections process by switching to automated billing software. Often businesses spend countless hours and resources on tedious, manual tasks related to billing which can be easily reduced by optimizing and automating the invoicing process. Sending out invoices manually is time-consuming and prone to errors. Customers could miss a bill due date and it becomes difficult to track delinquent payments manually.\n\nAutomated billing software saves you time by calculating, processing, and sending out invoices automatically. It also lets you schedule automated billing reminders, allows your customers to view their statements via a customer portal, and sends timely notifications reminding them of making the payments on time.\n\nAutomating your collections process will allow your finance team to quickly and accurately identify which accounts have late payments, efficiently notify the appropriate departments, and redirect your team’s time and attention where it is needed.\n\nWrapping up\n\nIn the current competitive business atmosphere, getting payments from your clients on time is critical to your business’s financial health. That, in turn, is critical to your business remaining viable and making the investments required for growth. Therefore, streamlining accounts receivable, by setting up a proper system and welcoming clients to adhere to it, is essential to ensure that overdue accounts do not build up and put a serious dent in your bottom line."
