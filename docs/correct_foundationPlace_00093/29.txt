LogiSense was established by a team of dedicated professionals in early 2010 with the goal of delivering a wide array of comprehensive logistics solutions from a single corporate platform.

The Company has quickly entrenched itself in key areas of domestic logistics, freight management, port & marine services and corporate advisory business. LogiSense was able to achieve this in a brief operating history by assembling a best-in-class management team and forging strategic alliances with renowned operators both domestically and overseas.

Our holistic services array enables us to provide our discerning clientele with one-window solutions throughout the logistics value chain.
