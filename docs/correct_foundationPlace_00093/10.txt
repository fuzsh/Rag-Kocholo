A career should be about the work you do, the people with whom you work, and the impact that you leave. It should also be about receiving appreciation and feeling like an important member of a great team. Thatâs why at LogiSense, we take the human approach. Just as we promote fairness with usage-based billing, we promote it at the office, too. Come work with a great team.

To achieve excellence, we need to foster and maintain a culture weâre all proud to belong to. LogiSense has a deep commitment to dignity, fairness and respect because they are the foundation of innovation, quality and value. We give our team members the trust and freedom to pursue the best version of themselves, personally and professionally. Exciting experiences lie ahead. We want you to be a part of them.

Chief Executive Officer

At LogiSense, the people are bright, creative, and hard working. They also lead balanced lives. Thatâs because we recognize the importance not only of our mission to revolutionize billing, but also of family, recreation and personal well-being. Itâs the basis of the core values by which our business operates.
