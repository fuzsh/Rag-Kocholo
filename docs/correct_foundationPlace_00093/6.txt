LogiSense helped Vonage merge all three companies into one instance, building the right foundation for scale. LogiSense provides Vonage with full billing with usage processing, payment processing, and tax integration using bundles.

LogiSense also provides Vonage with the capability to meet the demands of enterprises that require special pricing, invoicing output, catalogues, bill days, etc. LogiSenseâs motto - monetize anything, personalize everything - is exactly what the solution enabled Vonage to do.

By partnering with LogiSense, Vonage was able to minimize risk and cost of transition. LogiSenseâs billing solution provides Vonage with the ability to outcompete in B2B markets, and a scalable telecom grown back office framework. When a salesperson from Vonage asks "is this possible?", LogiSense has empowered their finance team to say "yes."
