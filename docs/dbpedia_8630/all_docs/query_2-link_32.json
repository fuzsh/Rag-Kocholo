        "text": "President Barack Obama’s candidacy and election represented a momentous milestone in U.S. racial history; yet, the declarations of postracialism that followed his election are grossly premature. Comic discourses on race that reflect racial realities and constructions prominently illustrate the lasting significance of race. I consider the dominant public reactions to a controversial New Yorker cover illustration that satirized fearful discourses about Michelle and Barack Obama during the 2008 election. The dominant responses to the illustration revealed pervasive colorblind, antiracialist discourses and scapegoating rituals that erect significant obstacles to racial justice. These reactions illustrate the potential of racial comedy to provoke important conversations and debates about race that force people to make sense of racial culture.\n\nUsing the concepts of literary criticism advanced by Mikhail Bakhtin, this paper provides an alternative methodology for reading advertising text and demonstrates how carnival culture is incorporated advertising texts, such as an on-line commercial for JBS Men’s underwear, and print advertisements for Glassing Sunglasses and Mattel-Scrabble. Carnivalesque analysis suggests that advertising has always been part of popular culture and is influenced by earlier carnivalesque forms. When analyzed within the carnivalesque framework, advertising text can be understood not only in terms of a cultural narrative reproducing the capitalist social order, but also running counter to dominant capitalist ideology. This paradox has an important implication on how one perceives and defines advertising.\n\nThis article rhetorically analyzes the interaction between American women of childbearing age and digital photographs of Thomas Beatie. I argue that these ideological, emotional, and physical interactions reproduced and transgressed traditional masculinity, as well as reproduced a ‘‘pregnant (transgender) man’’ and ‘‘happy family,’’ in part through the digital photographic processes of cropping, circulating, and conversing. This study differs from existing feminist scholarship that suggests images of pregnant men propagate patriarchal control over procreation and overlook reproduction by women.\n\nTo understand the conditions under authorities allow taboos to be performed or censor obscenities, an examination of comedic routine called \"The Aristocrats\" using the concepts of \"carnivalesque\" and the \"grotesque\" body worked out by Mikhail Bakhtin is useful. Obscene comedic performances create a space in which it becomes appropriate to ridicule authority and to denigrate all that is noble or ideal. This paper argues that contemporary comedy temporarily reifies the limits between permitted and prohibited language, overturns and profanes the social hierarchies of everyday life, and operate as resistance to authority where political change can potentially take place.\n\nThe race card is at once a trope and a topic that reductively prefigures racial meaning and performance. As a trope, it frames most racial discourse as a cheat or violation and thus prevents deliberation over material realities of race. As a topic, it exists as a resource for diminishing the social and political significance of persistent racial problems. We argue that The Daily Show with Jon Stewart (TDS) deploys political humor as a troping device that disrupts the contradictory logics of race card rhetoric and disorders a range of reductive commonplaces and figures of racial discourses. Specifically, we maintain that TDS pushes the boundaries of everyday negotiations of race, performs alternative conventions, and models manners of thinking, speaking, and acting useful for contemporary understandings of race. This essay therefore enhances the contemporary body of scholarship on politics and humor while expanding upon analyses of the rhetoricity of race and race relations."
