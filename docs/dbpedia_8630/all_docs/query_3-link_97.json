        "text": "I think anything like homophobia often takes it form in humour.\n\nMaybe children should be wetting themselves with laughter at the 'gay' taunts they may get in the school playground.\n\nThat's your sense of proportion. Because that's the reality of how it works.\n\nIn that case we'd better get Graham Norton and Stephen Fry off our screens because they often use humour about their sexuality and by implication any other gay or camp person. We'd need to ban Julian Clary's act too.\n\nI don't think there should be \"no go\" areas for humour. Certainly not homosexuality. Anyway the camp nazi is attempting (badly) to have a go at camp behaviour. You can be camp and straight, you can be gay and not camp. So it's not homophobia necessarily.\n\n'Allo 'Allo did a much better job of making jokes about gay Nazis. The humour is not anti-gay, it's in the incongruity of an openly camp or gay Nazi.\n\nChildren don't need to see jokes about gays on TV to taunt other children about it. Little Britain was a far worse offender in terms of gay and camp jokes. Al Murray is just a rather old fashioned comedian in comparison.\n\nI think it's a bit weak to suggest that if somebody doesn't find Al Murray funny then they must lack a sense of humour.\n\nIt's just that people find different things funnier than other things.\n\nOccasionally I found Al Murray funny, but after a while I got bored of his barman act.\n\nWhere did I suggest that? I meant that people who are offended by mildly \"homophobic\" jokes needed a sense of humour.\n\nClearly some people find him funny, others don't, He isn't a sense of humour yardstick, nor did I say he was. I happen to find him funny sometimes, but not always. The Pub Landlord as stand up was rubbish, but as a chatshow format it worked. I don't see why Al Murray should be type cast as the Pub Landlord forever as some people seem to want.\n\n0\n\nPardon me for misunderstanding, but you raised the subject about homophobia in relation to Al Murray's Camp Nazi sketches. Now you say no one was offended.\n\nUnlike you I hated the Pub Landlord at first but liked the character as a chatshow host. I agree it's time for him to be retired.\n\nI'm not offended.\n\nI just referred to it as mild homophobia.\n\nWhich I think it is.\n\nI'm not necessarily saying that Al Murray means any deliberate malice or is a bad person, and I certainly aren't saying that I think Al Murray hates gay people, but personally I find the core of where that kind of character comes from mildly homophobic.\n\n'Mild' being the operative word here, meaning that it's possibly come from somewhere more misguided rather than psychopathic hatred of gay people.\n\nIt's a very lazy comedy stereotype and I personally think it was a misjudgment.\n\nThere's probably supposed to be some kind of clever post-modern irony going on here, but essentially all it boils down to is that the biggest laughs seem to be based around the character's ultra-camp hi jinks and gay based shenangians. What a wheeze eh?\n\nIt's okay. I'm not offended, I'm not angry, I'm not going to ring Ofcom. It's just how I see it.\n\nI honestly don't feel outraged, it's more of a grimace and raised eyebrow wondering what on earth this is doing on telly in 2009.\n\n0\n\nSorry?. You have said the sketches are mild homophobia, which means by definition you must regard them at some level to be derogatory to gays.\n\nOffensive, in other words. Even at a mild level.\n\n'Nobody said it was offensive'?. YOU JUST DID!. Do you understand your own points?. You are contradicting yourself.\n\nYour words. You're putting words into my mouth.\n\n'Nobody said it was offensive'?. YOU JUST DID!.\n\nNo I didn't.\n\nWTF is going on here? Lol. Do you want me to feel offended or do you not want me to feel offended?:D\n\nDo you understand your own points?.\n\nYes. I never said that I or anybody else was offended. You told me that I said it was offensive, not me.\n\nIf there's an 'understanding' problem it lies in believing that an opinion of the portrayal of a character is exactly the same thing as feeling offended. Which you appear to believe.\n\nYes I believe that the depiction of the character is derogatory. No I'm not offended.\n\nYou are contradicting yourself.\n\nI said I find the character mildly homophobic. You are telling me that what I said must mean the same thing as me saying I was offended.\n\nThat's trying to put words into my mouth based on your own perceptions, not mine.\n\nTo see something and form an opinion of it based on what I see is an entirely separate thing from feeling a gut reaction emotion.\n\nDo you want me to feel offended? Are you seeking to find somebody who is offended?\n\nIf I literally tell you that I am not offended is that not enough for you?\n\n0\n\nSadly thanks to having horrible reception in my Uni Halls I haven't seen Murray's new programme, but as a standup I've often found his drivel on the French, the War, British Patriotism etc. tiresome, drab and terribly unfunny.\n\nHis act is so stale it's annoying and I find it even odder that I have mates who will sit there, watch him and laugh.\n\nIt's like reading the Daily Mail with all the offensive bits taken out. At least the Mail suits a purpose...\n\nSorry to be harsh to those who like him, I just don't understand his humour at all (maybe it's ironic genius, that he's trying to show us how much the British have to actually be proud of and what we stand for).\n\n0"
