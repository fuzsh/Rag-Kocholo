        "text": "The Pub Landlord, a character created by comedian Al Murray, will be performing in Bristol next year, touring an extended edition of his show Guv Island.\n\n“Country, the UK, lost its way, seeks life partner/mentor/inspiration. Good sense of humour essential. No timewasters, tedious show-offs or offend-o-trons need apply. HR free zone.” – Al Murray.\n\nStanding up so you don’t have to take it lying it down anymore, the Pub Landlord is back to make sense of the questions you probably already had the answers to. You know what they say: There’s no school like the old school, with the dodgy overflowing toilets. Al Murray’s Guv Island tour is coming to the Bristol Beacon on Thursday 8 May 2025.\n\nThe Pub Landlord is the creation of multi-award-winning veteran comedian Al Murray – a pastiche of parochial, nationalist know-it-alls in the guise of friendly publican. While some might fall a little too hard for the bit and mistake the Pub Landlord as a right-wing figurehead, he definitely falls firmly into parody.\n\nMurray has won numerous awards and accolades, including the Edinburgh Comedy Award and secured Olivier Award nominations for both of his sell-out West End runs. He’s also appeared throughout TV, both as the Pub Landlord in shows like Time Gentlemen Please and as himself in documentaries like Al Murray: Why Does Everyone Hate the English?\n\nMurray’s Guv Island tour took our little island by storm this year, but if you missed it, there’s no need to worry – the Guv Island tour is returning for 2025. If you’re an ardent fan of Murray, don’t go anywhere, because even if you’ve seen the tour already, there’s good news: the tour has been updated and extended for 2025 with new “extra brew” material.\n\nAl Murray’s extended Guv Island tour is coming to the Bristol Beacon on Thursday 8 May 2025. Tickets are on sale this Friday, 12 July. Get yours here.\n\nRead more:"
