        "text": "I can't stand the pub landlord character, I have seen parts of his shows on the TV but just found them boring or totally unfunny.\n\nI don't mind Al Murray when he's just being himself, on talk shows or documentaries etc. In fact when he is out of character I think he's a great guest on whatever show he's on!\n\n0\n\nI deteste him with a passion he thinks his sterotypical views about gender roles are funny.\n\nWomen didnt jump under horses so this useless lump can patronise the roles of females his interview style is pretty bad as well all.\n\nIf you think that then clearly you don’t understand the humour, which is at his expense. The fact that he is an outdated stereotype is part of the humour.\n\nhttp://www.wilco.dircon.co.uk/murray.htm\n\nAl Murray interview:\n\nHe complains that there's also a third audience group - a tiny but irascible minority - that doesn't get the joke at all and believes Murray is a bigot on tour.\n\n\"People say my act is racist, homophobic, sexist and xenophobic.\n\n\"I say to them: 'You can't have been listening.'\n\n0\n\nas ewoodie says it is funny because the pub landlord is an out dated un PC character and can get away with being sexist and racist and pro British and all the other none PC things he says. As such instead of just doing an interview he can do it in the character of the pub landlord and so say things you wouldn't get on a normal chat show\n\n0\n\nNah, not funny at all.\n\nI don't bother to even watch the programme. Have seen some clips and his performances on other shows and it just isn't worth my time.\n\n0\n\nI suppose Al Murray should take it as a compliment that some of his detractors see him as a mouthy bigot when appearing as the Pub Landlord.\n\nVery much in the same way there are people who thought Alan Partridge was a bloody awful chatshow host and couldn't see how he had wrangled his own BBC2 show.\n\n0\n\nIf you think that then clearly you don’t understand the humour, which is at his expense. The fact that he is an outdated stereotype is part of the humour.\n\nhttp://www.wilco.dircon.co.uk/murray.htm\n\nAl Murray interview:\n\nHe complains that there's also a third audience group - a tiny but irascible minority - that doesn't get the joke at all and believes Murray is a bigot on tour.\n\n\"People say my act is racist, homophobic, sexist and xenophobic.\n\n\"I say to them: 'You can't have been listening.'\n\nMaybe theres more to it than I can see but he clearly dosent put his point acrosss in a way which his audience will understand because if your flicking through the channels and had absolutley no background of this guy you'd simply think he was a sexest pig and thats how I see it.\n\n0\n\ni know hes being ironic, playing a character ie a sexist racist bloke and its an act and youre laughing at him not with him etc but i still find him very unfunny and predictable and groanworthy,and it seems he can only do that one character, ive said before i think he seems a 1-trick pony, cant he do anything else?\n\n0\n\nIf you actually watch the show you will understand the comedy. If you are flicking through the channels how can you posssibly comment?\n\nTo be fair, it's possibe to \"get\" most comedy acts just by flicking through the channels, so no-one would assume it would be any different for the pub landlord act, but it is.\n\nAnd this might be the main reason why, despite years of shows on Sky One and ITV1, Al's pub landlord act still hasn't really taken off on TV.\n\nIf ITV lose patience with him after the current series (and they'd be perfectly entitled to do that because they've already given him a second chance), I can't envisage Al ever getting another show on a big channel.\n\n0\n\nTo be fair, it's possibe to \"get\" most comedy acts just by flicking through the channels, so no-one would assume it would be any different for the pub landlord act, but it is.\n\nAnd this might be the main reason why, despite years of shows on Sky One and ITV1, Al's pub landlord act still hasn't really taken off on TV.\n\nIf ITV lose patience with him after the current series (and they'd be perfectly entitled to do that because they've already given him a second chance), I can't envisage Al ever getting another show on a big channel.\n\nI was under the impression that it was doing very well on ITV. He's certainly getting the guests which is usually a good sign.\n\nI don't know the ratings/demographics though.\n\n0"
