Which induces the most laughter? and the most benefit? Are we in the era of unfun now?\n\nAuthor: Sean Moffitt, Co-founder, Grey Swan Guild\n\nHumor — Does More Than Make Us Laugh\n\nSome might say that for a guild that focuses on making sense of the world, why would you want to wallow in the troughs of humor, comedy, gaffes and jokes? Historically, humor was seen as the opposite of seriousness and might have been ascribed to people who were dissonant, errant and flighty.\n\nFor millennia, we likely have done humor a great disservice by dismissing its ability to provide insights, speak truths, promote health and imagine futures better than most media forms. Some among us have seen its merits:\n\nAristotle viewed humor as the path to happiness, to leading a good life and a moderate level of humor improved reasoning\n\nThomas Aquinas believed humor created reason, virtue and social benefits\n\nMark Twain believed humor was mankind’s biggest blessing, replete with wisdom and the good natured side of truth\n\nMilitary trained, WW II leader, architect and president Dwight D Eisenhower believed a sense of humor was a key part of the art of leadership, of getting along with people, of getting things done\n\nNoted psychologist Edward de Bono suggested humor was by far the most significant activity of the human brain and sprung from the ability to make connection between seemingly unrelated concepts, contexts, situations and people.\n\nHumor, as per Merriam-Webster, is defined by the stimulus, effect and process:\n\na quality which appeals to a sense of the ludicrous or absurdly incongruous; a funny or amusing quality\n\nthe mental faculty of discovering, expressing, or appreciating the ludicrous or absurdly incongruous; the ability to be funny or to be amused by things that are funny\n\nsomething that is or is designed to be comical or amusing\n\nHumor — Why It Matters\n\nThe right type of humor makes us better humans and imminently more relatable as people:\n\nHumor is seen in modern times as being a positive psychological strength helping others feel good, important for friendship & intimacy and aiding us to be resilient to stress. Psychologists call these positive traits transcendance, put together they help us forge connections to the world, provide meaning to life and correlate strongly to other traits like: wisdom, courage, humanity, justice, moderation & restraint, learning and optimism.\n\nPersonality and humour in particular were rated extraordinarily high by people seeking romantic partners, more than intelligence, interests, looks or money:\n\nHumor also has health and physical benefits. Laughter has been known to 500x more effective than morphine at eliminating pain, facilitates more blood flow and better sleep.\n\nThe right types of humor make us more relatable as teachers (done well, 99% of students desire it, with 70% having very strong impressions) with better attention & engagement on the learning content delivered :\n\nHumor allows our content and advertising to be more memorable and likable:\n\nSo why don’t be see more of it in our professional and personal lives?\n\nWe Tend to Overrate our Humor\n\nLearning more about humor is the first step to discovery. As we can see, most of us tend to overrate how funny we are. Maybe we’re trying to be funny, but it’s not hitting our audience with the same intent.\n\nWe Tend to Be Scared to Use It:\n\nOnly 33% of workers say they actively exercise their funny bone in the work place because of: real or perceived boss disapproval, lack of knowing how, lack of having time and lack of seeing value.\n\nThe Golden Mean — The Aristotlian View\n\nAristotle believed there was a balancing act to good humour — somewhere between the unpolished boor and the over-indulgent buffoon lay the best form of comedy. It’s an interesting perspective. We’ll make no claim to better versions of humor and comedy as we tease through the 50 types that follow.\n\nFifty+ Types of Humor\n\n#1 Slapstick\n\ne.g. Naked Gun, Tom & Jerry, Gilligan’s Island def: a type of physical comedy characterized by broad humour, absurd situations, and vigorous/violent action, including the well-defined slaptick elements of: the trip, the slip, the double take, the collide, the fall (or faint), and the roar.\n\n#2 Farce\n\ne.g, Space Balls, The Importance of Being Earnest, Waiting for Godot def. a comic dramatic work using buffoonery and horseplay and typically including crude characterization and ludicrously improbable situations\n\n#3 Parody\n\ne.g. Monty Python, Don Quixote, Scary Movie def. an imitation of the style of a particular writer, artist, or genre with deliberate exaggeration for comic effect\n\n#4 Self-Parody\n\ne.g. The Extras, First Law (Asminov), Bill Murray/Zombieland def. a parody of oneself or one’s own work, sometimes in the form of a cinematic cameo role or literature self-insertion\n\n#5 Comedy Genre\n\ne.g. Midsummer’s Night Dream, The Jerk, How I Met You Mother def. one of twelve main classifications of literary and entertainment story genres, a branch of drama, theatre, cinema, stand-up comedy, television, radio, literary, or any other entertainment medium.which deals with everyday life, characters and humorous events; usually stories with a happy ending designed to elicit laughter and entertainment dealing with intrigues, errors, sentiments, humours or manners\n\n#6 Rom-com (short for Romantic Comedy)\n\ne.g. When Harry Met Sally, New Girl, Twelfth Night def. a sub-genre of comedy and slice-of-life fiction, focusing on lighthearted, humorous plot lines centered on romantic ideas, such as how true love is able to surmount most obstacles\n\n#7 Memes/Viral Humor\n\ne.g. RickRoll, Dancing Baby, Charlie Bt My Finger def. an amusing or interesting item (such as a captioned picture or video) or genre of items that is spread widely online especially through social media and person to person or person to group with a network effect benefiting the spreader (“I found this early”) and recipient (“I am now in on the joke”)\n\n#8 Comedic Journalism\n\ne.g. Rick Mercer, John Oliver, Frank Magazine def. incorporates a comedic tone to transmit the news to mass audiences, using humour and/or satire to relay a point in news reports; they generally take a more subjective stance on news and can be more trusted not because of neutrality but because of the emotional connection they generate with their viewers\n\n#9 Droll/Whimsy/Jestering\n\ne.g. The Office, Eraserhead, Rocky Horror Picture Show def. a jester, entertainer or buffoon; comical in an odd or whimsical manner, also considered outlandish, mirthful, queer, odd, or strange, catching their audiences in unusual comedic ways\n\n#10 Wit/Quip/Repartee\n\ne.g. Royal Tenenbaums, Shaun of the Dead, Fleabag, The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy def. sharp humour with the ability to think quickly; mental cleverness, especially under short time constraints\n\nTrends in Humor Types I:\n\n#11 Euphemism/Aphorism\n\ne.g. “Spending more time with the family” — is really “I had to resign”, “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”, Yogi Berra\n\nEuphemism: a mild or indirect word or expression substituted for one considered to be too harsh or blunt when referring to something unpleasant or embarrassing, some intended to amuse, some intended to downplay\n\nAphorism: a pithy observation that contains a general truth, misquoted or misadvised aphorisms are frequently used as a source of humour\n\n#12 Prank\n\ne.g. April Fool’s, Candid Camera, Jackalope def. a mischievous trick played on someone, generally causing the victim to experience embarrassment, perplexity, confusion, or discomfort\n\n#13 Deadpan\n\ne.g. Steven Wright, Aubrey Plaza, Buster Keaton def. a deliberate display of emotional neutrality or no emotion, commonly as a form of comedic delivery to contrast with the ridiculousness or absurdity of the subject matter.
