        "text": "This study is a discussion of the function of comedy as political critique and its role in the contemporary society, locating it back to its traditional historic origins and examining its development as mainly a form of entertainment combining the need to criticise and satirise current events, social issues and trends, as well as flaws and mistakes related to politics. According to the philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, all ideas have a historical essence. Therefore, in contradiction to Plato’s belief of ideas being eternal, timeless and ahistorical, Hegel suggests that an idea is a historical figure that is born and developed in a historically specific society. The reason I am choosing to agree with Hegel in this case is the fact that Plato’s opinion leads me to interpretive impasse. Agreeing with Hegel and thinking of an idea, in this situation comedy, as a historical figure, I am able to trace the reasons it was born and the causes for which it took the form of political satire and did not remain a simple source of amusement and laughter. For this reason, I need to underline from the very beginning that the research is focusing around Aristophanes, whose work has inspired his contemporaries as well as future theatre makers and artists in general. In addition to that and the main reason he is becoming a reference point throughout this study, based on the theory explained above is that he set the basis for the evolution of comedy as a form of entertainment to political satire. Firstly, I am aiming to understand the relationship between Aristophanes’ work and the politics of his time. I am meaning to identify the position of his comedy as a critique towards his society, the flaws and faults of the government, as well as the mistakes of the citizens. Consequently, this will lead me to recognise satire’s as well as the comedian’s position in a contemporary society. However, in order achieve this I am exploring the socio political and historical background in which Aristophanes lived and developed his work and identify his political scope through the examination of several contradicting opinions by theorists, such as E. Spyropoulos, F. Dekazou Stephanopoulos, N.G. Mpouras, M. Croiset, as well as the poet’s comic work. In this process I will also question and investigate the existence and function of political satire in a non democratic environment, which nonetheless will not be answered in this chapter, but will be concluded on a later chapter, as some further inquiry is considered necessary here. Carrying on I am investigating the role of indecency -in the context of ancient Greek comedy and in relation to humorous yet obscene incidents, such as sexual innuendos or even representations of sexual acts and scatological humor- in Aristophanes work and the contradiction to the poet’s acclaimed ethos. Through this I am intending to reach a definitive opinion on why the poet chose comedy as a theatrical form to address his political critique, and how he incorporated all its characteristics that traced back to its very origins and were often contradicting to the higher purpose of his work. I am realising this through the study of Aristophanes work locating the aspects where indecency appears, such as in scenography, costume, music and choreography, in addition to the comical scenes, the character’s behaviors and the language, and its forms, as well as tracing the contradiction to the poet’s acclaimed ethos. From then on, my target is using the above as a basis to analyse the way in which comedy has developed since Aristophanes time, as a form of entertainment, as well as in its relationship to politics. However, I am approaching this looking at two specific examples, that I have chosen because of the worldwide interest and impact they have had; Southpark episode 201 aired in 2010 depicting the prophet Muhammad, and the film The Interview produced in 2014 mocking the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. Finally, summarising everything that has been examined and discussed before and using that as foundation, I am attempting to site a clear definition of comedy as political critique, which will embody satire’s historical background, as well as the process of its transformation from a source of entertainment to a channel for political statement."
