        "text": "Now that we have \"Twenty-Six And A Half,\" the Weird Al tribute album which you should definitely buy, it's time to begin work on \"Twenty-Six And Three-Quarters,\" the follow-up Weird Al tribute album. Don't you agree? \"If I Could Be Weird Al\" by Spaff and Lund certainly needs a home, right? And now there's this new one from me...\n\nThere's always been something about \"Albuquerque\" that made me want to do my own version. Maybe because it's so random and cartoon-y. Maybe because it's so wordy and full of crazy harmonies. Maybe because it's eleven minutes and twenty-two seconds long. Maybe because it would justify some really long-winded commentary [like this] here on the FuMP. Hard to say for sure. But it's been awhile since I put together an eleven-minute song.\n\nAnd about three years ago I had a lawn-mower-related adventure that simply wouldn't fit into a three-minute song. There were just too many ins and outs and what-have-yous to cram in.\n\nYou know, now that I think of it, I've never put together an eleven-minute song. I mean, who would?\n\nBehold... I have now assembled the opus you are privileged to enjoy. Please note that 94 percent of my version of this song is literally autobiographical, particularly the culminating moment at 7:30 - it's absolutely true. Every now and then I stretched 6 percent of the truth for \"entertainment value,\" hoping to instill a bit of that \"humor\" everyone seems to like so much. But the vast bulk, the remaining 94 percent is pure, unadorned, humiliating reality. That's right. I'm an idiot.\n\nPlease also note that the structure of this parody matches Al's song, beat for beat and chord for chord. It would have been really simple to add or remove a bar here and there, in order to make the \"lyrics\" fit more easily... but no. This parody is true to the original, down to the nanosecond. And there are exactly 682,000,000,000 nanoseconds in this song. So that's a lot of dedication right there, gosh darn it.\n\nAs a special bonus, I've posted the chord chart for Albuquerque here. Fascinating, huh?\n\nLyrics, instruments, vocal, production: SG\n\nBackup singing: SG, Sir Walter Cherry, and Barbara D.\n\nBackup yelling: SG, Jace McLain, and Jesse Smith"
