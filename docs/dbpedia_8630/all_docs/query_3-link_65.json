Not only do we have a new Government, but by popular demand The Pub Landlord is back for another round of Guv Island in 2024/2025, with some freshly brewed material on the menu.\n\n“Country, the UK, lost its way, seeks life partner/mentor/inspiration. Good sense of humour essential. No timewasters, tedious show-offs or offend-o-trons need apply. HR free zone.”\n\nStanding up so you don't have to take it lying it down anymore, the Pub Landlord is back to make sense of the questions you probably already had the answers to.\n\nYou know what they say: There’s no school like the old school, with the dodgy overflowing toilets.\n\n★★★★★\n\n‘A supremely polished performer’\n\nMail on Sunday\n\n★★★★\n\n‘Wickedly witty Stuff’\n\nThe Telegraph\n\n‘It remains one of the great joys in comedy to see the Pub Landlord befriend and belittle the front rows’"
