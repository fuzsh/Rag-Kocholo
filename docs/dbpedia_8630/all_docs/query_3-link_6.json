He has named Genesis at Wembley Stadium in 1987 as the best concert he has been to and their 1977 live album \"Seconds Out\" as one of his favourite recordings. He also loves heavy rock and has named his favorite albums as Led Zeppelin I, Led Zeppelin II and Led Zeppelin III.\n\n[on his character \"The Pub Landlord\"] The thing is, the older I get the more I agree with him. There is that thing that once you've had children you instantly become more right-wing. I think the Landlord must have had about a thousand children to be that right-wing."
