Al Murray's Pub Landlord is back on the road to roll out his special Barrel Of Fun, which, as usual, is full of his high-quality, bar-room banter and hilariously misguided every-man philosophy.\n\nDuring the tour, Mr Landlord attracted a staggering 200,000 punters across the country (that's a lot of lager and pork scratchings), and showcased his one-man mission to fix broken Britain.\n\nRecorded at London's Hammersmith Apollo, the man in the burgundy blazer and entertaining a crowd with beautiful British names ruminates on subjects like the differences between men and women, the Pope... and squirrels."
