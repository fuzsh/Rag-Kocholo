Al Murray The Pub Landlord is not only overrated, repetitive, and annoying to watch, he’s also quite offensive, although not in the way some may think. If you don’t know who Al Murray is, he’s a so-called comedy character who performs stand-up (and at one point headed a TV show) portraying a white, working-class, bald-headed, xenophobic pub owner from Britain. Strangely for a character, Al Murray is also the name of the creator, in fact rarely will you see the “real” Al Murray without his signature burgundy blazer and his “common” cockney-esque accent. These blurred lines between what’s real and what’s fake act as a distraction from the ridiculing representation. You have to remember that this comic creation which stereotypes a certain demographic is created by someone on the other end of the class spectrum. Similar to Guy Ritchie who continually writes, references, and therefore speaks for a section of society he does not represent, Al Murray seems to have been accepted by the social class he has been caricaturing for most of his career. Surely this is in very bad taste?

My point is this…

Is it not offensive for an upper-class, over-privileged product of classism to create a parody of the British working class? If you’re entire repertoire is to dress-up and mock the class below you, are you not the same as a white man blacking-up, lampooning a demographic your forefathers have been oppressing for years?

If you don’t know Al Murray’s background, here’s a quick breakdown; his father is a Lieutenant Colonel who is a descendant of a Duke named John Murray, 3rd Duke of Atholl, a Scottish peer and Tory politician who married his own cousin (also a Scottish Peer). Murray is also a descendant of Dr. George Murray who was a Bishop, and on the other side of his family he is related to novelist William Makepeace Thackeray. Al’s grandfather was Sir Ralph Murray who was from Scottish aristocracy and who married into the von Kuenburg family, nobility of the Holy Roman Empire. Because of this heritage, Al Murray awaits both English and Scottish peerage titles, he is in line for the dukedom of Atholl and the barony Strange, each with their own coat of arms.

My point is this…

Someone with this kind of ancestry is so far removed from the common man that his character “Al Murray The Pub Landlord” is insulting and disrespectful. Where does an ex-head boy of a Public School (who then went to Teddy Hall, Oxford) get off caricaturing an everyday manager of a pub?

His fans of course can point to the fact that The Pub Landlord is a satire of a working class British man, but if you think about it that’s pretty offensive in itself. The Al Murray character isn’t just an obvious stereotype of a white, heterosexual, working-class, British male, there’s also the fact that the character amidst making sexist and xenophobic remarks suddenly mentions historical facts which is intended to look surprising and unexpected for the demographic he represents. Wow, how can a white cockney be educated? What a barrel of laughs.

To the real Al Murray, a potential Duke of Atholl, I guess it’s hilarious that someone with an everyday appearance and “common” accent could then orate eloquently about history, as though this is somehow impossible for the working classes to do in reality.

My point is this…

Along with comedians such as Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie, Harry Hill, and Stewart Lee, a swath of toffs took over comedy and then alternative comedy in the eighties and nineties. Now I don’t normally have a problem with someone’s background, Fry & Laurie, Hill, and Lee were and are relatively funny and their routines are rarely classist, but when it comes to Al Murray, his whole schtick is centred around how working class people are prejudiced, uneducated, idiots. This therefore infers that the working class are inferior to the upper-class in terms of opinion, education, and appearance.

Unlike Harry Hill and Stewart Lee (who Al Murray has performed with in the past) Murray is in constant disguise as a “normal” middle-aged white man. This alleged mock-xenophobic stand-up comic who looks like someone from the National Front, English Defence League, or Britain First routinely shows up on mainstream shows such as the Soap Awards, trying to appeal to the working classes. Every time he makes an appearance on a programme that is targeted toward the “lower-classes” he’s essentially saying that prejudice and bigotry is only a characteristic of “normal” everyday people. Every time he appears in character on a show catering to the working-class, he’s basically stating that rich, educated, upper-class people are devoid of hatred and bigotry.

My point is this…

Being patriotic has undoubtedly been drip-fed to the public especially since the mid-nineties, that’s why the noughties were such a state-licking, authority-loving, foreigner-hating decade it turned out to be. Being the son of a Lieutenant Colonel, you couldn’t plan this moulding of society any better if you were plotting a Psychological Operation for M.I.S.O., acts like Al Murray have definitely contributed to the changing attitudes of white Britain.

With the working and middle classes not understanding derision masquerading as satire and not recognising a condescending lampooning from an upper-class prat such as Al Murray, is it not surprising that society has turned out the way it has? Thanks largely to this type of propaganda, with “Keep Calm And Carry On” every-fucking-where, unrequited love for Will, Kate, and even the racist Harry, blind support of the military, supporting every war and drone strike, a xenophobic attitude to asylum seekers and foreigners in general – not that this behaviour is solely Murray’s fault, but acts like The Pub Landlord definitely helped proselytize many of the white working classes into accepting and then adopting their given stereotype.

My point is this…

He probably wishes he was but Al Murray is no Alf Garnett, he isn’t Johnny Speight, if anybody had the right to call out the attitudes of the everyday Briton it was someone born in West Ham rather than someone from Buckinghamshire. But, having said that, even the Alf Garnett character appealed to and affirmed people’s use of racial epithets. Bigots in the sixties and seventies had a mainstream precedent as they hurled abuse at other creeds and cultures, then in the nineties and noughties Al Murray became every racist’s go-to character of admiration. Satire is all well and good until it becomes a behavioural confirmation or stereotype threat.

My point is this…

Al Murray is so far from being “Al Murray The Pub Landlord” that for accuracy he should be called “Alastair James Hay Murray, Public-School Educated, Oxbridge Toff, Higher Rank Than A Lord”, but that wouldn’t fit on a frigging flyer for his tedious stand-up show.
