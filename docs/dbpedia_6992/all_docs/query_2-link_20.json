        "text": "You may have noticed that there was no VNTS post last week. You can thank gravity for its absence. I found myself in a position where it was either me or an old lady falling down a small flight of stairs. The good news is that the old lady is fine. No old ladies were harmed in the making of this VNTS post.\n\nThere were a TON of updates and I know I didn’t get them all. Some officially licensed releases: Raidy III (JAST) here; Sweat Sweat in Summer (MangaGamer) – Link; WORLD END ECONOMiCA episode.02 – Link. There are others further down in the list as well. Also of note: MangaGamer’s and Sekai Project’s Otakon announcements. Zaka wrote a ZakaBox entry, so check that out as well. As always, I’ve got some stuff down in my section.\n\nAnyway! Welcome to our weekly VNTS (Visual Novel Translation Status) series, in which we track visual novel translation updates in-house (we don’t rely on /jp/ posts on 4ch, for example) and post it for your enlightenment and enjoyment each Saturday. Subscribe to email updates by signing up on this page. If you find any errors, or you think a project is missing from this list, please let me know in the comments. There is commentary by myself and Zaka at the end of the post. Any new updates are marked by orange text.\n\nThe Short Version:\n\nOnly the New Stuff\n\nAnniversary no Kuni no Alice – Added to the list.
