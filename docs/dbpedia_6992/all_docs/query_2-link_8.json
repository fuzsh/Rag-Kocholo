        "text": "Denizens -\n\nI pre-ordered MML about a month before release, based upon ImoPara and Evangile and perhaps the artwork previews on MG (figure I have to actually buy these when I can, after all). I've been an f95 user for some time, visiting VN discussions but passively, from the shadows. In the midst of reading MML, it seemed about time for me to commit my first post. So, in the spirit of SOL/MOE, ...\n\n\"Hi - My name is Stephen. I hope we can all get along. Let's all do our best.\"\n\n(see what I did there?)\n\ntl;dr - I'm mostly enjoying \"Magical Marriage Lunatics\" so far - warts and all. I've already done LuLuna, and I'm currently doing Luce (umm, I mean their routes, of course, tsk). Below, I elaborate upon what I've read so far. I then continue, in a spoiler-wrapped tangent, discussing the challenges of learning the Japanese language, and why one might wish to. Lastly, a couple recommendations. And on to the next post\n\ntl;read it anyway - So, it really seems like f95 just might be the place for me - to find a little commiseration and camaraderie. I agree, more or less, with almost everything that's been said here. Still, I'm pretty tolerant of MOE/SOL, given the abundance of spineless-loser MCs that seem typical of the genre. I can put up with most of the absurdity:\n\nYou don't have permission to view the spoiler content. Log in or register now.\n\nI've finished Luluna's route, and.. overall - loved it. I can actually enjoy a fair amount of moe at times - it's a mood thing after all. After a death-of-heroine end, nakige, etc. - a sweet moe story can be comforting. Anyway -\n\nYou don't have permission to view the spoiler content. Log in or register now.\n\nLuluna may end up as my favorite. Luce is also quite endearing, and pretty smokin' hot as well. I also like the artwork in MML - the backgrounds and interiors, the sprites and the CGs, including the H-scenes I've read through so far - all nicely done imho. \"Me likey\".\n\nYou don't have permission to view the spoiler content.

(I've heard things...).\n\nYou don't have permission to view the spoiler content. Log in or register now.\n\nYou don't have permission to view the spoiler content.

I think this is why I'm an infrequent poster - I continually forget that I suck at reigning-in the stream of consciousness, and that it's nowhere as engaging as I think it might be as I furiously click away... I thank you all for the months of thoughts and impressions on VN content.\n\nStephen\n\nSigh, what a letdown. The girls are all class, A+ really, made by the same company that made the Imouto Paradise games, I had high hopes for this after seeing that + the fox girl who shares the face with one of the lolis from Imouto Paradise 1. But no, the game is mostly boring loooooooong parts of text before you get a few scenes with the girls at the end. There dosen't even seem to be any harem ending either. Extremely vanilla in other words, and here I though it would be at least somewhat exciting since the creators have proven that they can make hot games previously. Also, unskippable ending credits is a practice that must die!\n\nOh well, I guess the \"moe\" fans loves these kind of games though.\n\nI guess I must, yeah - I must be one of those, lol... and, yeah - you're RIGHT! I thought I kinda recognized Karin. It's one of the twins - the \"naughty\" one, Koharu. But - the twins were a bit younger iirc... maybe she's Koharu's daughter, from ImoPara2?\n\nAnyway, I guess I did like ImoPara too - but Imouto Paradise is a nukige.\n\nMML just isn't a nukige - although, imho, it's got a fair amount of pretty decent H going on once the route commences. Granted, it's got a fairly long common route, so if that stuff kills it for ya, eh... That said - If you played Luluna's route and didn't think the H was any good, or that it was just too vanilla - I'm very surprised. And remember - I read both ImoPara titles too. Maybe you should power through it, or just skip through the parts that bore you... just a thought.\n\nYou don't have permission to view the spoiler content.

I kid.. none of that in ImoPara either, fortunately. That said - there's a time and a place, lol.. but - for a moege, with several H-scenes per heroine, I think it's surprisingly good.. for all it's sugar.\n\nBut you're right, it's not a nukige, it's not ImoPara for sure...\n\nTotally agree about the credits -- it should be punishable as a crime. Like making them modal like that is going to do anything other than annoy people - not sure what the thought process is behind that...\n\nCheers"
