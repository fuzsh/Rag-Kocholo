        "text": "Just as always, my watch list ended up longer than I had anticipated. It’s okay though since most of the shows I’ve been watching from past seasons have wrapped up. There are the usual magical girl and idol stuff I watch of course, but it seems like there will be more sci-fi and action shows for me to indulge in. Since I’m low on time, I’ve decided to skip specials and movies this time around. Anyway, on to the list!\n\nContinue reading\n\nHappy New Year! With 2014 around the corner ready to bring the new season with it, I’ve finally gotten around to compiling my winter watch list. When I did a quick look at all the shows for the winter season I thought there weren’t too many I was interested in. After a more thorough look however, my list ended up fuller than I had originally estimated. Sequels, a remake and a new entry in a franchise pad out the list but there are a fair number of new shows I’m looking forward to. This time I didn’t bother to add any commentary to the OVAs/Movies sections since they’re all related to things I’ve watched before. Anyway let’s get started!\n\nContinue reading\n\nThe time has finally come to be fashionably late posting the list of shows I plan to watch this season. This time around I’ve tried to limit the number of shows I plan to follow due to time constraints. In fact I haven’t even watched some of the things I was planning to from last season. The list is shorter than normal since I decided to forgo a few shows I was only sorta interested in. With that said it’s not as small as it could be but I think it is a much more manageable and might give me a chance to catch up on some older series included stuff from the aforementioned previous season. Interestingly enough the list contains a lot more action-oriented material than usual which might be a nice change of pace. As for the OVAs and Movies sections, I’ve once again omitted writing explanations if it’s obvious why I’m watching something and don’t have anything important to say. I also haven’t listed stuff I have mentioned in previous posts. Anyway, that’s enough of an intro so onto the list!\n\nContinue reading\n\nAnya and I are back for more Illya! All I have to say is that I really love ChouCho’s singing and this is no exception. Anyway I’ll let Anya (@anya_fennec / Crescent Lilies) do most of the talking:\n\nThis song is a lot more vague and poetic than Prism Sympathy, so we had a much harder time translating it. I think someone else might interpret it differently and come up with a completely different translation for the song ^^”. In our interpretation I find it really romantic, about a girl that made promises with someone but is too insecure to take their hand. Inspired but the gentleness and kindness of the person, she embarks on a journey to find the courage to finally show her true feelings.\n\nJust like last time the translation is colored Kaleido-Ruby to help distinguish it from the rest of the text. Please enjoy the song!\n\nContinue reading\n\nIt’s finally time for another translation. This time I partnered up with Anya (@anya_fennec / Crescent Lilies). She actually did most of the work and I just helped a little. Here are her thoughts on the song:\n\nI liked this song a lot more after I translated it. I love cute upbeat songs, and the meaning of the song made it even better. It’s optimistic and encouraging, about running forward together towards their dream. They’re certain that each day will be bright.\n\nThe format is a little different too but the English translation is colored Kaleido-Ruby for easier reading. Anyway please enjoy!\n\nContinue reading\n\nI’ve been pretty distracted by other things lately so I almost forgot to write this before the season actually started. I wasn’t too familiar with what shows were airing this season until I did some last minute research so I’m surprised by how much my own personal list ballooned. I’m sure it would have saved me a lot of time if I were to write about what I probably am not going to watch but oh well. There are so many things I’m interested in this time that I’ve decided to not write anything for some of the OVAs. I don’t want to waste time and get repetitive by explaining each one is a sequel to something I’m already watching. Even though the number of entries is larger than normal the amount I wrote for each one is pretty small so maybe I’ll go back and expand them later. Anyway time for the list.\n\nContinue reading\n\nKinda wasn’t planning to do this but then I listened to it and had to. I haven’t started watching yet but now I’m pumped. Anyway I tried to keep all the “___ to mata” parts parallel throughout the translation and tried to keep string imagery intact. I’m not sure how well it worked out but I hope you enjoy it!\n\nContinue reading\n\nAt long last it’s time to reveal what I’ll be watching during the upcoming season. Just like the previous season it looks like it’ll be a nearly even split between watching new shows and watching sequels. Overall my level of excitement is roughly the same as last time. However somehow my idols got replaced by robots and as a whole this season may be more action-packed than last. Except for TV series I’ve decided to omit things which have already started (I’m looking at you RDG). Anyway time for the list!\n\nContinue reading\n\nFinally it’s time for insert song single 3! No brand girls is the first song on the single and was played during the end of episode 11. The other song on the single is just START:DASH!! again but this time sung by all members. The lyrics for that are exactly the same so No brand girls will be the only new song today. Anyway enjoy!\n\nContinue reading"
