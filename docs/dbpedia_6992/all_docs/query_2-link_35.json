        "text": "But, something…something doesn’t want us here. Something out there is killing people. ―Hostage\n\nNomad is tasked with rescuing one of the hostages held by the KPA in a village. After breaking through a KPA checkpoint and obtaining information on the hostages’ whereabouts, Nomad enters the town and rendezvous with Psycho, who escorts the hostages to safety. The first hostage the team rescues turns out to be a CIA agent who was sent to monitor Dr. Rosenthal’s work. In the jungle, Nomad finds another hostage named Badowski dead with ice shards in his back, as the KPA battle an alien machine nearby. After Nomad regroups with Prophet, Prophet is suddenly snatched by another flying machine, which flies away with him in its grasp.\n\nAfter stumbling upon a KPA station, Nomad will be ordered to gather intel concerning where the hostages are being held. After the intel is gathered, Psycho will move into the town, and Prophet will remain behind, moving to a new location after the hostages are secured.\n\nMost of the technology exhibitions show off the Crytek Engine by placing the player within the depths of a jungle and illustrating what lighting and texture details are like. I find more enjoyment in having out at the water’s edge. Of course, I can’t actually feel the tropical humidity, but I can nearly imagine it, what with how nice things look here.\n\nThe precision rifle, designated DSG-1, is the main long-range rifle used by KPA forces. Despite the fact that ammunition is relatively rare, the precision rifle is capable of stopping standard KPA soldiers with a single shot, and the weapon does not suffer from damage drop-off to the same extent as the other weapons. The first precision rifle found in the game comes with the assault scope, making the rifle less effective than it would otherwise be. I prefer to grab the rifle for the scope, and then switch back to the shotgun.\n\nProphet suggests blowing up the gas station to create a distraction, but with cloak mode, this isn’t strictly necessary. I attached a silencer to my SCAR, and snuck in to the school where the hostage was held. Careful use of cover meant I did not have to fire a single shot. Of note is the blockade here: there are bounding mines that can kill the players instantly. These mines can be shot, upon which they will jump into the air and explode, but immediately raising the alarm.\n\nThe hostage turns out to be a CIA agent sent to investigate Rosenthal’s research. Regardless of how quick or slowly the player approaches the town, Psycho will always appear behind the player after Nomad makes to open the door.\n\nAfter the hostage is secure, KPA tanks (T-108) will roll into the village. There are missile launchers in the school house: three shots will disable a tank. The player does not have access to C4 charges here, and we note that small arms fire is useless against armour. My favourite approach is to clock, get to a position behind the tank gun and fire. The T-108 has a large fuel tank mounted on its rear that can be ignited with small arms fire, although this only inflicts minor damage to the tank and will eventually burn itself out.\n\nAt my old website, I suggested that players keep to an assault rifle/shotgun loadout to engage the KPA patrols while making their way to the caves to meet up with Prophet. The assault rifle, paired with its assault scope, and a shotgun mounting a reflex sight, will be more than sufficient to engage all of the forces here, although yes, there is the possibility of cloaking and hiding in the creek to evade patrols.\n\nKPA soldiers may be found in groups, making it viable to use fragmentation grenades to force them out of positions and even clear out groups of clustered soldiers. On closer inspection, one may note that I always have my assault rifle in semi-automatic mode: this is because automatic fire will burn through ammunition very quickly, and a single, well-placed headshot from an assault rifle at medium ranges is sufficient to do the job.\n\nAfter reaching the end of the creek and perhaps admiring the scenery (clicking on the images will yield their 1080p resolution), it’s time to go and wrap up this mission. Again, players opting to use cloak and sneak by the KPA forces will complete this part of the mission more quickly; there are KPA patrols everywhere in this area, and engaging all of them will deplete ammunition very quickly. Players who’ve made it thus far without switching to the FY-71 rifle, keeping the SCAR, have done so by picking their fights carefully and not wasting ammunition on every patrol or camp they come across.\n\nThe mission ends after Prophet is abducted by an unknown entity, of the same type that killed Aztec earlier on. The player is not given the opportunity to go spelunking at this point: the third mission begins on a trail outside of a farm.\n\nIt’s been a little more than three years since I’ve played this mission; on my first playthrough, I opted for the Stallone Rambo approach and lit up everything in sight, raising the alarm and taking far too much time waiting for my armour to regenerate even as KPA soldiers lobbed grenades at my last known position. Thus, this mission proved to be a longer one on that attempt. However, in my last play-through, I made use of the cloak and foliage, concealing myself in the bush and using cloak in the open to move around. It comes as hardly any surprise that I was able to make my way to the KPA-held village far more quickly and move on to the mission’s next phase. If anything, Recovery emphasises the fact that Crysis is very much a “do it how you like it” game, permitting for both approaches to be taken. This choice extends to the weapons a player may wield: all of the weapons will get the job done, but the choice of weapon and customising the weapons themselves really allow the player to fine-tune exactly how they want to approach a mission. On YouTube, for instance, some players will make extensive use of cloak and silencers, while others prefer sniping their enemies from a distance, and yet others will jump right in with a shotgun equipped with a reflex sight. The choice is entirely dependent on the player, allowing a player to complete a mission using their style of choice, and weapons of choice. Recovery sees many firsts for the player, including the acquisition of the assault scope, precision rifle, missile launcher and engagement with armour. In many ways, this mission might’ve been more suited for a demo mission in terms of gameplay, but compared to the first mission, it is set entirely during the day, and as such, things like the sunrise cannot be showcased.\n\nSo JSOC’s got us chasin’ Archeologists now? Now this will be a cake walk. ―Aztec\n\nIn 2020 when North Korean forces led by General Ri-Chan Kyong take control of the Lingshan Islands. A team of American civilian archaeologists, led by Dr. Rosenthal, send out a distress call indicating that they have discovered something that could change the world. Thus Raptor Team is dispatched to the islands, with the core mission of evacuating them and securing any valuable information that they have. The team consists of Nomad, Psycho, Aztec, Jester and team leader Prophet (all under code names); they are outfitted with Nanosuits, which help protect them from gunfire and explosions, as well as giving them superhuman strength and abilities. As they perform a high-altitude jump onto one of the islands, an unknown flying entity disrupts the jump by smashing into Nomad, and the team is separated. The crash deactivates Nomad’s Nanosuit and destroys his parachute, but he is saved because he lands on water and his suit absorbs the impact of the landing. After he makes his way to shore, Prophet is able to reset Nomad’s suit remotely, restoring its normal function. As Raptor Team regroups after the jump, Aztec is killed by an unknown entity. When the team finds him, they discover that whatever killed him also killed and dismembered a nearby squad of KPA. The remaining members of Raptor Team proceed with the mission. Along the way they discover the hostages’ boat frozen on a hill near the coast of the island. They also get their first look at the aliens who have been attacking their team, when a flying alien machine sneaks up on them and snatches Jester, killing him shortly thereafter.\n\nWhen I first played Crysis, it was when I was supposed to be studying linear algebra and completing an assignment. Instead, I spent the afternoon shooting at palm trees and watching them collapse to the ground, before realising I had a tutorial I needed to attend. When I played the game next, it was in March 2010.\n\nThe default key-binding in Crysis maps “f” as the primary action key, meaning that every time I made to melee someone, I ended up grabbing them. This allows for some rather cruel laughs, as one can toss KPA soldiers around like ragdolls, but it does serve a more practical purpose: grabbing a KPA soldier and throwing him into a crowd will knock them down, buying one some breathing room to clock, recharge or reload.\n\nArmour mode is the most commonly fielded mode in the game, behaving similarly to the Mjolnir Armour from Halo. However, it takes fewer hits, making it more important to make use of cover. As such, it is actually less time consuming to use clock than to go in guns blazing: the latter means firing, alerting everyone and instigating a prolonged firefight. Now, there’s nothing wrong with a good firefight.\n\nThe first sunrise in Crysis is now iconic, and it is here that the capacity of my current-generation video card really comes into play: one can see the volumetric lighting effects here. Later on, I’ve supplied a link back to my old website and the collection of screenshots I have from the XPS 420 days.\n\nGranted, this is a beautiful morning on a tropical beach, and I’ve pretty much cleared everything here with the SCAR; the SCAR is the American assault rifle all players start with and, compared to the FY-71, has superior accuracy and damage-per-round. Moreover, it has a superior magazine capacity, but ammunition for this rifle is relatively rare. Nonetheless, I like to stick with this weapon for as long as possible.\n\nClock is perhaps the most-praised Nanosuit function, being recommended by all expert players as the means of getting through concentrations of enemy soldiers. The rate at which the clock drains is proportional to how quickly the player is moving, depleting slowly when the player is standing still or prone, and depleting quickly when the player runs. Getting hit will cause the suit energy to drain to zero, rendering the player vulnerable to enemy fire, even in armour mode. As such, the most common trick is to manually switch back into armour mode before firing.\n\nThe HUD in Crysis is more intricate than in Bad Company 2, but the layouts are similar enough, with the minimap on the lower left, and the status indicators on the lower right. The minimap is unique in that it includes a threat indicator that glows green when the enemy forces are unaware of Nomad’s presence, and grows to red to indicate that Nomad’s been spotted and may be taking fire. Were it not for the fact that the KPA were swarming the Lingshan islands, this screenshot would suggest a remote South Pacific island, perfect for getaways.\n\nThe cruiser on the horizon will bombard the player with missiles should they attempt to leave the combat area. It’s more of a habit now, more than anything, but after gathering intel on the KPA from a terminal, I always stop by up here to enjoy the view before continuing with the mission.\n\nPlayers of the demo will have access to most of the first mission and the XM2014 Shotgun, a close-quarters weapon used by the KPA and US Forces. Where needed, the weapon can fire a narrow pellet spread for increased effectiveness at longer ranges.\n\nA frozen boat in the middle of the island foreshadows the nature of the mysterious enemy on the island. A quick player may be able to catch a glimpse or two of these mysterious entities, but for now, the first mission draws to a close.\n\nCrysis was released in 2007, but when I bought the Dell XPS 420, Crysis was not on my radar, and as such, I did not bother building it with a better video card. However, in my first year as an undergraduate, one of my friends bought an Alienware m17x laptop. At the time, this laptop completely blew the XPS out of the water, and was equipped with the NVIDIA GTX 260M SLI, giving it unparalleled performance. Of course, my friend wished to test the system’s performance, and decided to play Crysis on it. It was during a lunch hour that we hung out in a study hall engineering students and watched as he played through the first mission, showing off the game’s graphics on full settings. Subsequently, I obtained a copy of the trial and eventually, the full game. The Dell XPS 420 managed to run the game on medium settings at 1280 by 1024 reasonably well, at least, until the last mission was reached and the particle effects overloaded the HD 2600 XT I was running at the time. After beating the game and getting a review out for my old website, I removed the game to save disk space, playing the trial on occasion for amusement, but my curiosity in Crysis was partially re-ignited by Girls und Panzer and the presence of a brand-new system. Thus, I decided to play through Crysis again at higher settings for the experience, and an experience it was. The first mission felt completely different in that it was more alive than anything I had experienced previously. The differences aren’t really apparent until after reaching the KPA jammer and watching the sun rise. After this, the game is one long visual journey, with a distinct emphasis on the “do it how you like it” approach. In gathering most of my screenshots, I went with a stealthier approach, avoiding checkpoints and enemy patrols where I could, all the while admiring just how gorgeous this six-year-old game looks even when compared to games in this age.\n\n“Quick! In the Head Museum! It’s free on Tuesdays!” -Bender, Space Pilot 3000\n\nDecember 31, 2999 is in fact a Tuesday, and the use of Zeller’s Congruence can be used to verify this claim. Zeller’s Congruence is also seen in Yuyushiki: we’re now past the halfway point in the anime, so it makes sense to consider what I feel about this show after six episodes. Thus far, we’ve seen Yui, Yukari and Yuzoko partake in traditional summer events, recall their childhoods, talk about whales and potatoes, enjoy nabe with Yoriko Matsumoto, their teacher and even watch as Yui goes on a sleep-deprived rampage after she spends an entire night reading a book.\n\nYuyushki is considered to have countless similarities to Lucky Star, and admittedly, the unusual character designs, paired with the premise of information processing, led me to pick up the show, despite it not being in my list of things to watch initially. Of course, I now have more shows to watch than there are seconds on the clock, but the relatively few anime that interest me from the summer offerings might permit me to catch up.\n\n[Bane’s Voice] Wait…I have something to tell you: stop hitting yourself!\n\nSomeone’s probably going to have my head for posting this image, but Yuzuko’s daydream was too amusing to pass up.\n\nI watched the first episode way back in in May, a little more than a month ago and noted that their computer screens are probably of the 21 or 23 inch 1080p type. Had I watched this anime back in April, I might’ve been a little envious: ever since January, I found myself wishing that I had a widescreen monitor, which would have helped me write papers more efficiently (on Windows 7 and 8, the snap feature allows windows to be viewed side-by-side), but I only picked up new hardware, well, you guessed it, after finishing my thesis.\n\nChiho Aikawa is a classmate of the girls and the class president. She is a quiet girl who admires Yui a lot and wants to become friends with her, but is usually intimidated by Yuzuko and Yukari’s antics.\n\nNope, not going to deal with these n00bs today, telegraphs Yui, who is seen here hiding behind a workbook of some sort.\n\nFanservice is pretty limited in this anime, but there is a fair portion of episode two dedicated to talking about…well, I’m not going to go there.\n\nInsofar, Yuyushiki has been less about data processing and more about the outrageous antics the girls partake in in their day-to-day lives. Slice-of-life anime are enjoyable (for me) because they remind me of my high school days, and also because believe it or not, university has been a similarly unique experience.\n\nYuyushiki carries over the unique characterisation style from Lucky Star and the girls-love overtones from Yuru Yuri. There are also more comical, random elements that find themselves at home in Nichijou.\n\nYui’s sleep-deprived state is immensely amusing to watch. I’ve spent a handful of days in a partially awake state, usually as a result of not sleeping well and developing a headache. To reduce its impacts, I carry Advil in my office to prevent myself from being too heavily affected from coding.\n\nAt the near-exact halfway point of the anime, Zeller’s Congruence is discussed as a means of determining the day of week. Upon hitting their equivalent of Wikipedia, Yuzuko and the others find the mathematical expressions for both the Gregorian and Julian calendars, although they are unable to understand how the equation itself operates. Carrying out the calculation itself turns out to be a relatively simple matter, requiring only a basic understanding the floor operation. The expression itself consists of simple operations, as well as a handful of floor operators and the modulo operator: the former simply means “round to the lowest integer” (e.g. the floor of 1.9 and 1.3 is 1), and the modulo operator finds the remainder in a division operation (e.g. 15 mod 7 is 1). Thus, let’s give the Zeller’s Congruence a spin for December 31, 2999. I will ignore the software implementation for this example, and assume that we are using the Gregorian Calendar. For h as the day of week (0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, etc.), q as the day of month, m as the month, K as the year of the century and J as the century. Then:\n\nThus, using Zeller’s Congruence, we have demonstrated that December 31, 2999, will indeed be a Tuesday. Similarly, the equation yield h = 4 when asked for the day of week for January 1, 2020 (by the same methodologies above, although we use m = 13, k = 19 and J = 20 owing to special parameters used in the algorithm). This corresponds to a Wednesday, as expected. Unlike Yuzuko, I have some background in mathematics, so wielding this equation is not particularly problematic. After watching Yuyushiki and pursuing Wikipedia, some Tropers have come across the same page, which tells them that Zeller’s Congruence is for determining the day of week of any date on a Gregorian or Julian Calendar, although much of TVTropes’ user base will run into the same problem Yuzuko did, lacking the mathematical background required to wield the equation.\n\nOn a typical day, I only have hot food during dinner, making it especially delicious. For the sake of inconvenience and efficiency, I prefer eating things that are quick in the mornings and during lunch; this is not to say they don’t taste good.\n\nI was originally wondering how I would go and add figure captions for all twenty of the screenshots, but I realised that I could probably talk about random stuff that (somewhat) pertains to the images the caption is supposed to accompany.\n\nApparently, human interest in cute things is an evolutionary characteristic: our attraction to cute things, such as infants and children, arose from selection choosing for individuals who were more interested in taking care of small children and infants. Because parents who took more care of their offspring were more likely to pass on there genes, this behaviour would eventually have a higher proportion in a population and as such, modern society values cuteness.\n\nI remember this one time, I was watching a game of Street Fighter II and began laughing so hard, I was crying. The damage mechanics, coupled with unique sounds in Street Fighter II make a handful of unique jokes. I also recall laughing myself silly over some of the stuff that happens in Pure Pwnage (most notably, FPS_Doug’s antics and Jeremy’s tendency to pelvic thrust his CRT screen upon a victory). Laughing to the point of tears is supposed to be healthy in moderation.\n\nAdmit it, the English version on Wikipedia of the Zeller’s Congruence is significantly easier to read. I’ve provided an example of how it works above: the equation is probably beyond the scope of materials that most high schools cover, but university students should feel right at home with the floor and ceiling operators.\n\nYui resorts to her fists to keep Yuzuko in check after the latter tries to blackmail Yoriko into letting them have hotpot on campus in their clubroom.\n\nThis is the first time I’ve seen crab meat in nabe: nabe differs from Chinese hotpot in that all of the ingredients are mixed together and cooked all at once, while the versions I’m used to involve cooking the meat first, followed by seafood and vegetables, and the noodles last, resulting in the flavour from everything put in previously to imbue with all of their flavours.\n\nVoiced by Minami Tsuda, Yui behaves in a very similar manner to Yui Funami from Yuru Yuri. Yuzuko, on the other hand, is voiced by Rumi Oubuko, who also played Chinatsu Yoshikawa from Yuru Yuri. Unlike Chinatsu, Yuzuko’s innocent nature does not belie a more evil side.\n\nIn anime, the cameras are almost always “conveniently” placed for the viewer’s amusement, except maybe mine, especially since I choose my titles very carefully to avoid this stuff, and thus, are usually found watching anime in the presence of others, who don’t particularly mind my hobby. However, when this stuff shows up, people start asking questions.\n\nI’d never thought I’d actually be able to generate figure captions for this many images, but here you go.\n\nInsofar, Yuyushiki has turned out to be a remarkably simple anime that is more minimalist than even Lucky Star in the way of story, focusing almost entirely on the girls’ daily lives. What sets Yuyushiki apart from other anime of this class would be its unique integration of data processing into the mix, making it fun to see what the girls will look up and summarise next. From a practical perspective, the girls are really getting nothing of value done (their club activities are essentially equivalent to looking up various topics on Wikipedia), but this aspect is forgiven owing to how well it interfaces with the girls’ unique personalities, making the anime a light-hearted alternative to the more focused series that this season has to offer. I note that I am following Suisei no Gargantia, Yahari ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru and Ore no Imouto ga konna ni Kawaii Wake ga nai (second season) at the present and will discuss those in greater detail, hopefully before June ends.\n\nA few days ago, I read a magazine story that gave several small details about what the Anzio OVA and the movie itself will entail. In particular, the magazine story gives the length of the movie to be relatively short, clocking in at 80 minutes. As a sequel, the movie is to be set after Ooarai’s victory over Black Forest, featuring new characters and tanks. Of interest is the point that claims that a team superior to Black Forest exists, so there are implications that the movie will probably be set at the international level of competition. Furthermore, the movie will emphasise friendship and passion as a thematic element, as did the TV series. The news article also notes that the movie will lack any unexpected plot twists, deaths and betrayal amongst the characters, suggesting that the movie will feel like an extended TV episode, centred around Panzerfahren. With these statements in hand, it is clear that the Girls und Panzer movie will probably be structured similar to the TV series, not unlike the Strike Witches Movie or K-On! Movie; these films stuck close to the mythologies employed by their respective series, giving them a friendly, familiar feel (an example of a movie that deviates from the source is the Ah! My Goddess Movie, which by far surpasses the OVAs that were released before it). I will reserve my judgement for after the movie releases, which is expected to be in March 2014, a seemingly unfathomable distance from the present.\n\nThe movie they speak of will release at some point in 2014, meaning that I probably won’t see the movie until 2015. I’ve got the patience, but depending on what’s happening in 2015, I’m not sure if I’m going to have time. This time around, there seems to be a team that’s even more powerful than Black Forest Peak out there in the world…this is a reminder that there is always a bigger fish, and that Ooarai will need to earn any victory they strive for in the movie, as well.\n\nFor the present, I absolutely cannot wait to see the OVA depicting Ooarai and their campaign against Anzio. I imagine that Anchovy will retain her personality from the manga, and her experiences with Miho will similarly lead to her accepting that Panzerfahren may extend beyond victors and vanquished.\n\nThe article also states that the Anzio match will be completely different than the version we saw in the manga. I have noted previously that the manga itself is not canon, and as such, here are my predictions on the OVA. I anticipate a rush attack from Anzio, forcing Ooarai to regroup. The volleyball team and first years will hopefully be given an opportunity to shine here, taking down several of the units engaging Ooarai’s flag tank, and in a final stand, Miho’s company lays waste to Anchovy’s remaining tanks, resulting in the scene we saw at the end of episode seven. Presently, no release date on the OVA has been noted, but I will post that here once the information itself is made known. For the present, one more OVA will be released, and as per usual, I’m hoping for a 10-15 minute deal showing off some of the celebrations.\n\n“So, they trigger it in the right spot, down goes the US power grid. Then as our fine country slips into total fucking anarchy, the Russians decide to come knocking. The end!” ― Agent Aguire\n\nThe level picks up where Crack the Sky left off and starts with Bravo-Two out on the frozen lake headed towards the downed satellite. Once they get there, Sweetwater explains that they won’t be able to get the black box from it until it cools off. Just then, an explosion is heard to the right. More Russians show up and try to destroy the satellite with M2 Carl Gustav rocket launchers. After this section is clear, more approach from the other side, and soon a Mi-24 approaches with another rocketeer on board. Once they are all killed and the chopper is downed, a blizzard starts to set in while Redford and Haggard leave to try and find transport. As Sweetwater and Preston try and get the black box off of the satellite, Sweetwater decides to look for Sarge and heads off, leaving Preston with the satellite. He then discovers the black box tucked under the satellite, and heads off looking for the squad in the blizzard.\n\nFlynn ends up contacting Preston, saying that he dropped flares along the path to light Preston’s way. Redford then comes in saying he and Sweetwater are looking for Haggard and Flynn while telling Marlowe he will need to find some warmth because of the cold as he moves down the mountain.. Preston heads down the path, keeping warm by going into the houses or creating fires with explosive barrels while killing Russians searching for him along the way. As he gets further down, the blizzard finally starts to let up as Flynn comes in with the squad and Aguire in his Black Hawk. The chopper helps clear out the town with Sweetwater and Haggard manning the miniguns, destroying most of the buildings as Preston pushes through. Once he reaches the last house, he climbs to the roof and boards the chopper. They then head off to a safe spot and Aguire tells them about the Russian superweapon. He says they are building a Scalar Weapon and the project leader is Arkady Kirilenko, the Russian that Preston was not able to shoot in Cold War. Aguire sends them off looking for Kirilenko in Chile where a US Armored Division will be supporting them.\n\nThe first objective is to defend the satellite: enemy RPGs will appear and fire upon it, and the satellite will be destroyed if it takes too many hits. The player may use any combination of weapons here to prevent the RPG operators from firing.\n\nThe heat of re-entry lights the scenery on fire and puts a crater in this abandoned town. There are a great many of emptied villages in Bad Company 2, leading me to wonder who used to live there and how long it has been since these settlements were vacated. Obviously, it’s a setting in a game, but curiosity nonetheless can bring about these questions in the calm before more enemy forces appear.\n\nThere are plenty of M2 RPGs on the rooftops: as soon as the Hind shows up, grab one and torch it. The projectiles arc a little, but at this range, aiming for the helicopter itself (without compensating for the arc) will be sufficient. As per usual, keep moving about to avoid getting hit while reloading.\n\nThis is the interesting part of the mission: with a blizzard now upon Marlowe, the player will have to make their way down the mountain, and the cold will cause the visor to freeze up.\n\nWhile ammunition is common, players may opt to conserve it and use their knife to cut through doors into the homes to warm up. There are enemy soldiers in here, and as such, care must be taken to avoid getting hit, or worse, getting knifed.\n\nExplosive barrels, a cliche in almost all shooters, can be detonated to create fires that can ward off the ice accumulating on the screen.\n\nThere is a house with a mounted grenade launcher somewhere around here, although it won’t be of too much use to the player. Those who are bored might use it to see the Frostbite 2 engine at work: firing a large number of grenades at any building will cause its collapse.\n\nThe blizzard clears out once the player has made a fair bit of distance. Once it clears out, Flynn will inform Marlowe that they’re clear for extraction, but with the blizzard gone, this is a good opportunity to head back up the mountain, find the MCOM stations and arm them without fear of being frozen to death.\n\nI realised that this site does show up on anime news aggregators, meaning that these Bad Company 2 posts also appear with my regular anime posts. To ensure that those using the aggregator services find relevant anime news, I will try to make the gaming posts in conjunction with an anime-related post to keep things real.\n\nHeading up this ladder will conclude the mission, with the next mission involving tanks. I’m going to cap it here and begin the photo posts for Crysis, again, getting to the tank mission, before resuming Bad Company 2. At the time of writing, I’m done both games, but I’ll alternate the posts to ensure that there is sufficient variety.\n\nBeing able to knife through doors is fun, and is a preferred way of entering the various houses scattered around this map. After defending the satellite, a blizzard kicks in, separating Marlowe from the rest of Bad Company. Thus, to survive the mountain blizzard and not freeze to death, there are a handful of villages and explosive barrels along the way; standing near a fire will clear the screen of accumulated ice. Of course, one has to be careful about the soldiers inside the houses: carelessness will result in getting knifed. Snowblind is in fact reminiscent of Crysis‘ Paradise Lost, except that in the latter, the player is covering for a squad mate with a damaged Nanosuit, while here, the player must find heat sources for themselves. Contrasting the other missions in Bad Company 2, Snowblind is one of the most quiet of the missions, emphasising escape over the comedic elements found in other levels, giving this level a quiet, eerie ambiance as one finds themselves surrounded by a snowstorm."
