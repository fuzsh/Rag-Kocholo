FrontWing’s Grisaia no Kajitsu is the highlight for this month, and two new companies 3rdEye and GALACTICA provide all the intense action with BLOODY†RONDO and Gokudou no Hanayome. CIRCUS continues the D.C. series with its loli mahou shoujo title T.P. Sakura, while I’ll be enjoying imouto company with Imouto Paradise!. It’s a slow start to the year, but I’m sure you all still have games on your backlogs to go through anyway. Or you should be playing the Oreimo PSP game.\n\nWell all good things must sooner or later come to a sad end, just happens to be a little sooner this time. Compared to last month January heralds the coming of a new year in such a pathetically impotent fashion I find myself greeting the new year with a sense of trepidation, perhaps I should start going by the Chinese calendar. Either way there are now only 700 days left to live if you happen to believe those silly Mexican temples, so better hope the next 365 days don’t continue in this fashion and let you go out with some better games to read.\n\nSmile☆Shooter ~First Ticket~\n\nCompany: 工画堂スタジオ (Kogado Studio)\n\nGame site: スマイル☆シューター ～ふぁーすと☆ちけっと～\n\nRelease date: January 14, 2011\n\nComments:\n\nThe latest all-ages musical action ADV from Kogado Studio features new idol group Smile☆Shooter, which has been popular on cell phones and Twitter. In the game, you have to help the girls (Yurina, Airi, Mayu) with their debut. It’s a mix of ADV and musical action parts, using the same system as Angelic Serenade and Symphonic Rain. If you like Idolm@ster type games and/or Kogado’s musical action system, this would tickle your fancy. Otherwise, there’s not much else to see here.\n\nSo the goal of this game is to help some random girls become idols, yeah I am sure that is extremely entertaining, especially since the game doesn’t even let you take over the world. Of course as the game is all ages I assume the easy method of sleeping with executives is a no go? But since I have an allergy to all things along the lines of idols or magical girls I will spare you the ranting and just assume anyone interested in this is already well aware of their own tastes and uninterested in my utterly negative opinion on the matter.\n\nSee? I can be nice sometimes.\n\nNoblelige!\n\nCompany: mana\n\nGame site: ノーブルリージュ!\n\nRelease date: January 25, 2011\n\nComments:\n\nThis is an all-ages cross-media series by bishoujo game company mana and light novel publisher MF Bunko J. It is written by Okano Touya and TAMAMI. The light novel covers the first part of the story, while the kinetic novel DVD that comes with the special version of the paperback details the second part of the story. Magic item appraiser Lang visits the house of an impoverished noble to collect debts. There he meets a proud girl named Charlotte who has a great sense of justice and duty to her followers. Even though she had already given out most of her possessions away, he plans to salvage some assets, but…\n\nI’m somewhat interested in this title since it’s a fantasy setting without your typical eroge cast. The main theme probably will be about Charlotte’s compassion even with her fall from riches. There are various ‘baddie’ characters on the official homepage, but I’m not sure how they fit into the story. I plan to pick up the LN to see how it is.\n\nWhen I first saw the art I found myself rather interested in this game, and then! I looked at the story and cringed, but thought maybe… just maybe it will be ok, and yet unfortunately I saw the OP and facepalmed hard enough to cause a concussion. There certainly was a bit of interesting development, till we get the standard justice girl storyline coming into play, and the poorly integrated and cliché magical themes. On the whole I expect this will only be worth reading for people who are already fans of the Light novel, otherwise the story is not compelling enough to warrant wasting your precious life away on the time needed to play this game.\n\nThe light novel and the VN come out at the same time, although there’s a demo available for those interested in seeing how it’s like.\n\nThen no one should ever play or read it.\n\nYou’re pretty grumpy already. Cheer up, have some cake.\n\nWaiii~!! Onii chan cake~!! Onii chan daisuki!!\n\nT.P. Sakura ~Time Paladin Sakura~\n\nCompany: CIRCUS\n\nGame site: T.P.さくら～タイムパラディンさくら～\n\nRelease date: January 27, 2011 (Part 1); February 24, 2011 (Part 2)\n\nComments:\n\nTime Paladin Sakura is an all-ages D.C. spinoff, featuring eternal loli Sakura as an even more loli mahou shoujo. Sakura is a lively 3rd grader at Kazami Gakuen who spends the day as a normal girl with her best friend Kotori and osananajimi Junichi. However, she is actually hiding a secret… she can use the powers of the space-time tree to travel through time and change the past! The game is split into two parts, and an hour-long anime OVA will come out at the same time too. There’s also mini games included.\n\nIt goes without saying that I’ll be playing this. The chars are even cuter and most importantly, I get to see one of my fav chars Miharu again! Well, she’s on the ‘bad’ side with Suginami and Nemu, but the villians are about as evil as those in Milky Holmes. Also, it’ll be a bit different with Taketatsu Ayana voicing her. Actually, the whole cast will be different. I still expect a fun and enjoyable mahou shoujo show though ^^\n\nWhen a company can release a game just about every month, and still insist on reusing the same setting and characters only sparing minor alterations all the while maintaining a loyal fan base who buys just about every game they come along with, they are either doing something right or their fans are in dire need of real 3d girlfriends. This game in particular brings about a deep loathing in me that precious few other things are capable of, as a mix of Circus abusing their dog.. fans and magical girls is about as bad a combination as I can imagine. Next will be an idol making game featuring Nanaka.. if that has not already been done…? Either way that would be followed by a 3d dancing sim game, and after that a game about an alternate universe where they all pilot mecha, then perhaps a game where everyone is gender swapped in order to build up a female fan base as well, then a game all about playing mahjong with characters from both DC games.\n\nWell, they did spinoff an otome game in D.C.G.S. Come to think of it, I’d play an idol making game featuring Nanaka and Kotori.\n\nI knew they had done at least one of them, but my delicate heart could not deal with the effort of looking them all up, forgive me.\n\nAQUA\n\nCompany: SORAHANE\n\nGame site: AQUA\n\nRelease date: January 28, 2011\n\nComments:\n\nThis is the debut title for SORAHANE. In 2056, it is possible to create holograms with mass using AQUA computers. The city of Tsukigahama is the home of the Center of AQUA Research and Development, ECReD, and an antenna on the horizon called Ruka which maintains all AQUA. Souta returns to this city after 7 years, but he hates this place because it reminds him of his dead osananajimi, Chisa. However, he meets a dojikko girl who calls him Sou-chan. There’s only one person in the world who calls him that, Chisa, and this girl not only has the same name as her, but also her kind smile.\n\nThe artwork by Akizuki Tsukasa is definitely not a problem here (the OHP is also quite impressive), but I’m greatly concerned about the storytelling. The scenario writers all come from doujin circles, namely Benitanuki and Sakura Mint. They aren’t bad per se but when it’s an official company and you’re paying a lot for their titles, you expect something of a totally different level. All the heroines are attractive, but I’d go with Rin since she comes with imouto Kaede!\n\nOk… I have a hard time with this one, first of all a hologram with mass defies the very nature of light as a form of energy and thus not having mass. Yet lets for the sake of argument say you could concentrate enough energy to create the mass necessary, the energy required for this is astronomical to the point of being almost impossible, where would that kind of power even come from? I can only conclude they are basing this off of the current “Hologram” technology that uses water vapor as a medium (Also possibly hence the name AQUA?) to reflect the light from multiple projectors thus creating the illusion of a three dimensional image. Anyway silly excuse to come up with a “Unique” design for androids aside does anyone else find this scenario way too predictable? There are several ways it could play out but the three most likely options are that the replica Chisa is one of those androidograms, based either on her memories uploaded at her dying, her body being suspended or in a coma at the hospital and the holoChisa acts as a terminal vessel for her mind, or she was a hologram all along and thus didn’t really die. Micchi has already pointed out the the storytelling feels a little weak despite the quality of the artwork, which when coupled with what I find to be an uninspired setting this is one gigantic pass for me.\n\nEverything comes from the power of LOVE.\n\nSo then may I stuff imoutos in a furnace and use it to power the world as brand new alternative green fuel?\n\nYou don’t always need fire to create energy, you pyromaniac.\n\nLet me tell you something important about life, there are needs required by physics, and there are needs required by the soul. An imouto furnace is one of those things that the soul demands, you can’t use logic on it. Besides, if love is all you say it is it could be the power source of the future!\n\nYour need is in direct conflict of mine. Vetoed.\n\nMoe-tyrant.\n\nBLOODY†RONDO\n\nCompany: 3rdEye\n\nGame site: BLOODY†RONDO\n\nRelease date: January 28, 2011\n\nComments:\n\nThis is the first game by 3rdEye. Shinkurou leads a double life. During the day, he leads a normal school life with other students, but when the sun sets, he heads out to the town to hunt the vampires that have slipped in among humans. One night, he comes upon a girl surrounded by vampires. He takes care of the vampires and takes the fainted girl to his home. However, he soon finds out that she isn’t human. How will a vampire hunter like Shinkurou deal with Luna, the last vampire princess who doesn’t know much about humans at all? An action-based game featuring vampires (including man-made ones), lycanthropes and vampire hunters. Hemi must be thrilled. The OP is pretty good too. What’s not to love about a maid with a rocket launcher?\n\nWhile I may not be against vampire stories, I have a strong aversion to vampire stories that are either childish, or over the top emo and needlessly dramatic, unfortunately this series appears to be in the childish group, set up almost as though it is based upon Kuroneko’s favorite anime and designed around a teenage complex storyline. Well with the bad out of the way it does seem a little bit more interesting than the last few vampire games, especially since they have avoided using an annoyingly worthless protagonist. As this month is rather devoid of games I find to be worth playing I will probably give this one a shot, after all when all else fails I still have yet to find a good maid character…\n\nSo what vampire series did you like?\n\nThat one with erm.. ya know.. .. thing. .. yeah, I’ll have to get back to you on that..\n\nCanvas4 Achrome Étude\n\nCompany: F＆C・FC01\n\nGame site: Canvas4 アクロウムエチュード\n\nRelease date: January 28, 2011\n\nComments:\n\nRyou was selected for a prize at the yearly Sakurabana art contest and was accepted into Nadeshiko Gakuen on a scholarship. He ends up living with his osananajimi Kotono. It’s been half a year since then and in additional to the cultural festival this fall, there will also be an art festival with surrounding schools. As the ace of the art club, Ryou was selected as the school’s representative. However, he has a problem: he can’t draw people. Even though he can complete the drawing technically, he feels that there is something off with it.\n\nThe latest Canvas title from F&C. This takes place 8 years after the conclusion of Canvas2. I really wish that they got the hint from Canvas3, which didn’t leave much of an impression at all, and just stop the series before it’s overdiluted. The idea of the emotional element not coming through from paintings, writing and other artistic forms is a common motif in these games and I’m surprised it hasn’t come up more among eroge based in art schools.\n\nI really enjoyed Canvas2 and to this day consider it among my favorite games of this type, and yet I lose more interest in this series with each successive generation. Even at a glance, repetition of the same themes throughout the series and of course characters whom utterly fail to grab my attention leads me to look upon the continuation of these games with apathy. As much as I enjoy art themes, they need to move on, perhaps to other fine arts, or perhaps try a different theme altogether. However if we are stuck with F&C copying Circus for a dozen more Canvas games I would like to suggest they start consulting real artists when coming up with their stories to help us actually believe what the characters go through both in terms of their art and the development of their setting.\n\nWith Ribbon\n\nCompany: ユロット (HULOTTE)\n\nGame site: With Ribbon\n\nRelease date: January 28, 2011 Delayed to February 25, 2011\n\nComments:\n\nThis is the HULOTTE’s debut title. Shoutarou had a dream where a very young girl who he had never seen before leapt at him, saying that she finally found him and she had wanted to meet her father. She said that even though he’s not her father yet right now, he definitely will be. With a kind smile, she tells him that will understand what she’s saying soon. After waking up, he walks to Tokimizu Gakuen like usual with his osananajimi Hina and saves a girl from being hit by a car. It’s the same girl from his dream! “I’ve come to support your love, papa!”\n\nFor those curious: No, your daughter Haruka doesn’t get a route. Now that that’s out of the way, I think it’s an interesting twist to your typical moe-ge since Haruka’s character changes depending on who you fall in love with (although Hina’s fits the most in my opinion). The cast is mostly comprised of new seiyuus and scenario writer Imaomi Naruto is also new. So if you have time to try out something slightly new, this might be a good choice.\n\nThis story reminds me of a manga I read some time ago where a daughter comes from the future to help her father fall in love with her mother and keep other girls away, then another daughter from the main rival does the same or something like that, cannot for the life of me recall what the title was though. Anyway regardless of the concept itself being a ripoff I must admit I am a little curious about how Haruka will develop through the different routes, even if I am not very interested in the development of what appears to be rather standard characters otherwise. Perhaps the main appeal will be in how Haruka helps, or possibly hinders your attempts to create a relationship with a certain member of the opposite sex and the comedy which ensues as a result.\n\nThere should be a spinoff where you play as Haruka and you go around manipulating your dad’s future so you can be perfect.\n\nI fear what you would consider perfect..\n\n^____^\n\nSorairo Memoir -Precious summer vacation!\n\nCompany: イグジット (Ex-iT)\n\nGame site: そらいろメモワール -Precious summer vacation！\n\nRelease date: January 28, 2011\n\nComments:\n\nThis is the first game by Ex-iT using the scenario writers from HUG. Ryuu and his osananajimi Ichigo return to their hometown for the first time in 8 years. They decide to race to the top of the mountain. What reacquaintances and memories lie beyond the mountain? Zzz… an osananajimi game that’s mostly filled with ero scenes, with mediocre art and ‘WTF is wrong with their limbs!?’ SDs. Pass.\n\nNo story here worth mention, in addition the artwork is sub par and the characters appear to be nothing special. So then what is there about this game that makes it worth it compared to others? Other than being made for people with a childhood friend fetish I myself am trying quite hard to figure this one out, so if someone else has insight which I lack by all means please do enlighten me.\n\nAlso as far as the limbs mentioned by Micchi I submit my hypothesis that they are in fact part seal. Even the pose on the cover art above looks almost the same as a seal being told to wave by its trainer when you really look at it… So maybe, just maybe this game is subtly directed towards a very specific subset of people who are into beastiality?\n\nOtakano -Konna ni Kawaii Kanojo ga Otaku na Wake ga Nai-\n\nCompany: DisAbel\n\nGame site: オタカノ -こんなに可愛い彼女がオタクなわけがない-\n\nRelease date: January 28, 2011\n\nComments:\n\nEiji is a 2nd year student at a regular school with normal grades and average athletic prowess. He lives by himself, spending his free time playing MMOs. He has friends, but none that he would call a best friend. Girlfriend? Forget about it. One day, he competed a SS-level quest with his online friend and he thought it would be nice to meet him in real life. They arrange a meeting and his supposedly male friend is actually a girl in his class, Moe! Not only that, but she’s the bespectacled class rep that doesn’t talk with other people much. And here she is standing in front of him in a cute mini-skirt and top, wearing contacts instead of glasses… what a change!? After the initial surprise, they decided to create a social networking club so that they can meet others like them. Then she adds that seifuku are prohibited in the club room!\n\nThis all boils down to being an otaku-themed nukige, similar to Eroge! and AkiMaho. The highlights are gathering cosplay and ecchi items for future use by completing mini games. This title obviously parodies Oreimo, especially with the creation of the SNC. However, since the Oreimo PSP game is coming out on the 27th, you should be playing that instead of this.\n\nSo let me get this straight, the game is about meeting bishoujo characters who already surround you in real life using an MMO as a medium? DisAbel is definitely catering to their audience by providing a fantasy scenario based on reality, instead of focusing upon a compelling story that draws the reader into the imaginary world of the creators. I suppose knowing your target market then creating a game that is based on their lives while giving them an ideal situation reflecting their ordinary surroundings yet allowing them to live out their fantasies with the best looking girls in their school is a good marketing strategy though.\n\nMy opinion on this game though is that well.. there is nothing to see here, there is no real story for me to care about, nor characters that especially inspire my desire to read their routes, so in keeping with what is apparently the way other people see me… Everyone who does like it is stupid because I don’t, and we all know my word is law therefore you must agree with my opinion. How’s that for a commentary!?\n\nGrisaia no Kajitsu\n\nCompany: フロントウイング (FrontWing)\n\nGame site: グリザイアの果実\n\nRelease date: January 28, 2011 Delayed to February 25, 2011\n\nComments:\n\nYuuji transfers to a small isolated school where there are only 6 students. Having lost all those he love, he has lost sight of the purpose of his life and spends his days in regret and atonement. The girls he meets at the school all have troubled pasts and regrets. He discovers a new hope and decides to do something for them.\n\nIf the chara designs seem familiar, it’s because the illustrators are Fumio (Hoshiuta) and Watanabe Akio (Bakemonogatari). They also brought along Kio Nachi (Lovekami, Sakahari) as a scenario writer. A slightly mysterious feel, this story is about helping each other overcome problems. This is probably one of the better games this month and I look forward to many good tearful stories.\n\nThere are two problems I see with this game, the first is that the whole of five other students who all happen to be around the same age is stretching things a bit, and is a little too specific as a fortunate occurrence even for an eroge setup. The second is how drama laden the whole story feels, just a passing glance at this game while thinking about the likely stories turns so emotionally exhausting I can only imagine how borderline depressing some of this game will be, and of course since I am not very good with reading forcible drama I do not feel like I could put up with this game for very long. That said the primary reason that I won’t be playing this game is how the origins of the writing and problems the characters have feels give me the impression they are a bunch of sad emo girls who are waiting for your love injections to make them feel better, great message there! Afterall when you are feeling down there is nothing like finding someone similar and latching onto each other because you have no one else to rely on and faking happiness is the next best thing, right?\n\nYou’re such a party pooper. It’s just because you don’t have the option of making their lives more miserables, right?\n\nThere might be a bad end option!\n\nThat should be a reason for you to play it then…? Actually, you never played the bad ends in Sinsemilla.\n\nYET! I will play them, only I am saving them till after I have confirmed the good ends, or at least this is true of the characters I like, Shouko gets bad ends right away.\n\nGokudou no Hanayome\n\nCompany: GALACTICA\n\nGame site: 極道の花嫁\n\nRelease date: January 28, 2011\n\nComments:\n\nThis is the debut title from GALACTICA. The Gokudoujin Family. Just hearing the name of this legendary family brings chills to mafia and politicians alike. Well, that was a long time ago. Yuuichi is the heir of the Gokudouin household, which is just a normal family in this peaceful time. That is until Asahi came to his house. Her family (Habutae) has been declining in power and she came to him intending to marry him!\n\nA mix of eccentric girls with special powers and skills. There’s bound to be fights, but I assume they’ll be more towards the comedic side than serious. I wonder if Yuuichi has hidden powers. I’m not too interested in these ‘actually fight over the guy’ scenarios, so I’ll pass on this. Also, ave;new needs to only sing Lump of Sugar OPs.\n\nHow saddened I am by this game, oh woe is me who sees the potential in this setup were it not so comical. Aside from the lost potential, there might be some decent comedy here I suppose, given there is not a whole lot to even consider playing this month, relatively speaking it might be an ok comedy pick, and even I may play it for lack of anything else interesting. Nothing good really saps my desire to be mean to mediocre games…\n\nJangokuhime\n\nCompany: げーせん18 (Gesen18)\n\nGame site: 雀極姫\n\nRelease date: January 28, 2011\n\nComments:\n\nNew release date after being pushed back from December. This is the mahjong fandisk for Gesen18’s Sengokuhime series, including a story mode and free mode. It features 21 heroines to choose from. Basically, you get sucked into the mahjong world and have to win in order to get back out. Oh, and declaring thirteen orphans grants a wish. Nothing too different from other mahjong games.\n\nThe cover for this game tells me that it is all about the furry loving.. oh .. right and something about mahjong?\n\nHoshi no Ouji-kun\n\nCompany: Leaf\n\nGame site: 星の王子くん\n\nRelease date: January 28, 2011\n\nComments:\n\nNew release date after being pushed back from December. Hoshino Ouji is a super handsome boy at the school and popular among all students regardless of gender. He is surrounded by his osananajimi Purin, ojousama Ringo, robot Chino, beautiful Cocoro and trap Yuri. Will they be able to overcome their problems and also find love at the same time?\n\nThere’s nothing that really jumps out at all, other than the fact that Yuri is really cute and I’d love to have him as my kouhai. Also, he has a route. The stories are written by Routes writer Nagata Kazuhisa, so they should be decent. The OP song, art and characters are pretty nice.\n\nAs I feel like I have already written commentary for this awhile ago but can’t seem to find it I will just pretend that I have already said what I wanted to and keep it simple. This game looks boring, nothing really stands out as spectacular to me, and while even TH2 might have suffered from the same thing by the standards of today, it was released a fairly long time ago when the standards for average were quite different, and as such achieved a niche in the market. I cannot imagine this game achieving the same level of market saturation unless the stories are absolutely mind blowing.\n\nPV\n\nImouto Paradise!\n\nCompany: MOONSTONE Cherry\n\nGame site: 妹ぱらだいす！～お兄ちゃんと5人の妹のエッチしまくりな毎日～\n\nRelease date: January 28, 2011\n\nComments:\n\nIt’s summer vacation and your parents are heading overseas for work, leaving you with your 5 little sisters: typical imouto Aya, tsundere Rio, timid Hiyori, lively and ero Koharu and mysterious S Michika. With no distractions and ecchi happenings one after the other, how far will you go with them?\n\nIt’s hereeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!! The trial was a good mix of comedy and ero and I’m highly looking forward to the full game. As expected from MOONSTONE Cherry, there’ll be lots of different ecchi scenarios and harem situations. Just like with IchaPri!, there’ll be animation shots and you can tweet from in-game (like in Angel Ring). My fav imouto is the koakuma-kei Koharu, although Michika’s frank lines made my jaw drop a lot of times. Aya’s personality is nice, but I wish that she and Rio were a bit… smaller. But it’s still great to be an onii-chan!!\n\nI get a headache just thinking about this game. But here you have it, all the incestuous people out there lusting after the fantasy of a little sister giving them sexual favors, there is finally… yet another game for you.\n\nAnekano ~Onee-chan to Ecchi de Amai Himitsu no Kankei~\n\nCompany: chococo\n\nGame site: アネカノ～お姉ちゃんとえっちであまーいヒミツの関係～\n\nRelease date: January 28, 2011\n\nComments:\n\nThis nukige is the first game by chococo. You get a choice of 3 onee-chans: super bracon Sakura, tsundere Kaede and iyashi-kei Tsubaki. This title also comes with a binaural ero-ama drama CD. I included this just because it focuses only on onee-chan instead of imouto like Imouto Paradise!. What’s scary is that the imoutos actually look like they have bigger breasts on the cover. Imouto > onee-chan.\n\nI get a headache just thinking about this game. But here you have it, all the incestuous people out there lusting after the fantasy of an older sister giving them sexual favors, there is finally… yet another game for you.\n\nOther than that since Micchi saw fit to bait a response from me I shall take this opportunity and reply in kind to such cheap provocation, as I cannot help but deny the act of spreading falsehoods through propaganda. The incontrovertible truth which has been proven by science is that in fact Onee-chan > imouto.\n\nWhere’s the proof!?\n\nMy own personal observations have led me to notice that most imouto lovers are much closer to sexual predators / deviants. In addition there was that one study by the Harvard psychology department…\n\nThere’s nothing scientific about that!\n\nHey! It’s Harvard! You can’t say that isn’t scientific, besides just look at certain individuals who frequent the IRC channel, that should be all the proof you need.\n\nMousou Protocol! -Hime x Miko x Robot-\n\nCompany: Triangle\n\nGame site: 妄想ぷろとこる！ -姫×巫女×ロボ-\n\nRelease date: January 28, 2011\n\nComments:\n\nOr maybe if you’re not into imoutos or onee-chans… how about some witches, mikos and robots? In Triangle’s latest ecchi title, Shinpei is an otaku that loves anime and games. Currently, he follows many late-night anime on TV and jerks off to the heroines while watching the heroines on screen and imagining them in ecchi situations. Then, the girls came out of the TV and started living with him! They return to the anime world only when it’s time for that week’s broadcast. Sounds pretty ero and silly. And there’s tentacles and a giant octopus. I think I’ll stick to my imoutos.\n\nMousou Protocol is Video Girl Ai gone eroge. I can’t say there is much here unless all you care about are wacky H scenes, in which case this is a smorgasboard for your fa… *ahem* viewing pleasure. Regardless of my own opinion it does seem that tasteless CG sets masquerading as games sure are popular these days.\n\nDamatte Watashi no Muko ni Nare!\n\nCompany: ensemble\n\nGame site: 黙って私のムコになれ！\n\nRelease date: January 28, 2011\n\nComments:\n\nOn the second day of the new school term, Naoki was walking to Seiran Gakuen with his imouto Fumuko when he witnessed a group of men forcing a girl in a dress into a car. He thought about saving her, but decided not to because he’d be beaten too easily. That’s when a group of butlers appeared and saved the girl. His relief turned to bewilderment when the angered girl ordered the butler to fire a rocket launcher. She smiled at him and invited him to her house as thanks for saving her. Of course, he declined the invitation and ran away as fast as he could.\n\nHowever, that’s not the end of it. When he reached the school gates the next day, he finds the girl from the day before, Rin, arguing with his arranged fiancée, Reona. Rin notices him and gives him a kiss, telling him that she’ll make him her groom. The school ends up getting involved and a ‘bride poll’ is held to decide who he will marry. Wait, why is his future being decided by a popularity vote!?\n\nWhat he should do is ignore both and choose the genki Kotori! They belong to the same astronomy club and share the same hobbies anyway! ^_^ The situation reminds me of AXL games (come to think of it, AXL hasn’t made a game in a while…) and I expect lots of comedy and fighting over his attention and body. The OP is pretty catchy.\n\nWow.. just wow.. A student council style game only instead of trying to win votes to be elected as the president you are trying to win votes for who you want to marry, it’s like some kind of terrible bizarro KoiChoco. As I am sure even the least astute and critical of people would raise an eyebrow at the idea of an eroge where your relationship is based upon the votes of your school, especially given the whole concept of such games is that you can choose. You only really have two options or combinations thereof ; The votes are either going to be the same in every route but rendered meaningless depending on the protagonists choices, or change based on his choices so once again the games own theme is negated. Of course I can’t ignore the silly premise of, “Oh you saved me! Now I will marry you!” being as weak as it gets, especially when apparently thinking about doing something is just as good as actually doing it. I wouldn’t necessarily mind the situation of being stuck in the middle of a marriage debate, but at least put a bit more thought into how it should be set up, I can just feel the laziness of the creators oozing from this games every pore.\n\nAlso for future reference it was an RPG not a rocket launcher.\n\nOborokomachi\n\nCompany: コンチェルト (Concerto)\n\nGame site: 朧小町\n\nRelease date: January 28, 2011\n\nComments:\n\nNew release date after being pushed back from October. Blessed with good quality trees, the village of Oboro had prospered in the forest industry in the Heian era. It has been passed down for generations that the girls from this area are very beautiful. This is because they are descendants of Oboro-hime, a woman of unsurpassed beauty who lived in this fog-covered area. Now, the town is renamed Tsumagoi-shi, but the story of the Oboro maidens still continues. There’s now an OP, but it doesn’t make me any more motivated to play this.\n\nThey are taking way too long for a game that looks sub par in every way. If they are just waiting to learn how to stop doing it wrong, this will not be out anytime soon.\n\nMicchi’s Top 3 for This Month\n\nKoiiro Sora Moyou FD Grisaia no Kajitsu\n\nT.P. Sakura ~Time Paladin Sakura~\n\nDamatte Watashi no Muko ni Nare!\n\nZen’s Top 3 for This Month\n\nBloody Rondo\n\nWith Ribbon\n\nGoukudou no Hanayome\n\nMmm… imouto… paradise…\n\nAt least you have a paradise for this month, I on the other hand just listed the main three I might consider playing in the order they appeared in the post… Then again it shows how bad this month is when Micchi has one third the top picks for this month when compared to last. Instead of a top 3 maybe it should be changed to a simple top picks, to allow for Micchi’s arbitrarily changing how many there are…\n\nSo, about that vampire series you liked…\n\nUhhh…. Dracula..?"
