        "text": "Parade’s Room No. 9 is now available for purchase on MangaGamer.com! Steam customers can purchase their copy later today!\n\nPatch Notice:\n\nIt appears that there was an error with our Room No. 9 release that resulted in outdated scripts appearing in the final build. The build on our site has been updated; however, if you downloaded the game from MangaGamer.com prior to August 7th please extract this patch into the game folder or redownload the game from your My Account page.\n\nBest friends Daichi and Seiji set out on an almost too-good-to-be-true summer vacation, but it quickly turns into a nightmare…\n\nInstead of the island paradise, they find themselves trapped in a strange room and forced to participate in an incomprehensible “experiment” demanding that they either harm Daichi physically or Seiji sexually. They’ll have to play along to have any hope of escaping with their lives, but that means hurting each other and possibly destroying their friendship—and their minds—in the process.\n\nWhile Daichi is quick to declare that he’d be just fine less one arm, and Seiji argues for the options that won’t leave lasting physical scars, do they really understand the consequences? Can they survive the “experiment” and is survival alone enough?\n\nFind out in the latest title from parade, the developers of No, Thank You!!!: Room No. 9.\n\nFeatures & Specs\n\nDeveloper: Parade\n\nPlatform: Windows 7, 8, and 10\n\nLanguage: English text with Japanese audio\n\nGenre: BL, psychological horror\n\nContent: Adult, uncensored\n\nSpecial features: Display options for glasses, body hair, graphic violence, and scat.\n\nContent Warning\n\nSince Room No. 9 has somewhat more extreme content that may be unsuitable for many players, here’s a general rundown of some of the game’s subject matter that may be of particular concern (please note that there may be vague spoilers in these descriptions):\n\nConsent: This one is a little tricky given the game’s premise. Daichi and Seiji are kidnapped and forced by their kidnappers to choose between performing sexual or violent acts on each other. They mutually agree on the course of action to take before performing sexual acts with the exception of one scene which is explicitly described as non-consensual by the script that occurs at the end of one of the routes.\n\nViolence/Gore: As referenced in the premise of the game, Daichi and Seiji are given the violent options in addition to sexual ones. The game settings give players the option to turn off visual depictions of this violence; however, it does not affect the text of the script which is fairly graphic. In terms of specific types of violence depicted, aside from the blood draw shown in the preview images there are scenes depicting the following (these are general descriptions but some may consider them spoilers so please highlight to read):\n\nA nail through the hand (very little blood shown), an incision in the forearm (also very little blood but this is probably the most graphic image), nipple piercing (no blood), and strangulation.\n\nScat: The game contains one scene featuring scatological content with three unique script variations depending on the route. The game settings give players the option to turn off visual depictions of feces, but textual descriptions remain unaltered (these are fairly non-graphic for what it’s worth).\n\nIf you have any additional questions or concerns regarding the game’s content before you make your purchase, please don’t hesitate to reach out to our support team or ask our staff on Discord, they’d be happy to help."
