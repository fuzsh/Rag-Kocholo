        "text": "Hello and welcome to my list of 100 HRPGs. I’ve been a fan of HRPGs since I first played one in 2012-ish, but to me HRPGs are also a curse – when I start playing one, it dominates my day, and if I’m not careful I can spend weeks at a time doing nothing but play HRPGs. The fast-paced gameplay, constant gratification with early to access porn, and endless variety of games is one hell of a combination. It’s such a deadly combination for me that I sealed HRPGs off for 5 years after my initial bout in 2012, knowing that if unrestrained my addiction would become all-consuming. That all changed when a certain soon to be revealed title in 2017 appealed to my tastes so much that I broke my vow and played an HRPG again. As you can imagine from the title of this article, the following 3 years have been a chaotic storm where I rushed to play all the HRPGs of the past that looked good to me, as well as all future releasing titles which interested me. My journey is still far from over, but it occurred to me the other day that I have played literally hundreds of HRPGs and could write a “here’s 100 HRPGs I played and liked” kind of thing, which I immediately did. And here it is!\n\nMy intention for this list is not to be an objective ranking of the top 100 best games ever, nor even my favorite 100. HRPGs are fetishistic in nature, and one’s sexual preferences will vastly impact which games they like. For this reason the following 100 games are largely influenced by my fetishes, being particularly dominated by big tits, NTR, and lewdification. At the same time, there’s a number of games I rate highly for the plot, the writing, the PASSION, the gameplay, and so on. The result of all this is a list of 100 pretty random games, ordered into 10 tiers reflecting how much I like the games. The further down you get the less I generally like the games, but I think each has value and its own appeals. With each game I include a brief summary of my thoughts, but not necessarily a description of the game – for that you can click the link to DLsite and read its description there, or potentially look at the attached image and derive all the context you need from that. My goal here is in some ways just to provide a quick-to-skim catalogue of my favorite games (or games I found interesting) to hopefully spread the good word and help other people find things they’ll enjoy. This is definitely not an objective list and there are many good titles not on here that I just haven’t played or finished.\n\nAnyway, without further ado, please enjoy. Click the names for a link to the game. Incidentally, this list is extremely pornographic, so turn back now if you’re in public or something like that. Lots of NSFW images.\n\nTier 1: Lifetime Favorites\n\n~Violated Heroine\n\nViolated Heroine was the game that started it all for me, so it’s only natural that I start this lift off with it. First released all the way back in 2009, it would be safe to say that Violated Heroine is one of the most influential HRPGs of all time, setting into motion various trends and styles that remain popular to this day – one might even say that the HRPG in general is unlimited Violate Heroine works. It stands up to this day as well, with expressive characters, an immersive world, and a nice variety of scenes. The only thing that doesn’t quite hold up to the test of time is the fact it was made in RPG Maker 2003, which results in an uncomfortably low resolution and some other quirks. Still, a classic game that remains well worth playing.\n\n~Fallen ～炎髪のマキナと遺跡の町～\n\nIf Violated Heroine was the game that started it all for me, Fallen is the HRPG that restarted it all for me. In many ways Makina reflects a regression in design from VH, with a much more limited scope and a much more linear story with generic characters and the like. However, at the same time, it represents an absolute leap forward in terms of high-quality visuals and quality of life. Scenes are easy to find, follow simple yet appealing arcs, and have supremely high quality art. It follows the trends VH established, with a heroine wandering around a town to be violated, and while it has lost much of the SOUL of its predecessor, it gains in return immense fappability. Also yes this is the game I was talking about in the opening. Playing Fallen when it came out in 2017 reignited an HRPG craze in me, the results of which is the rest of this list and more. It’s got a special place in my heart for that.\n\n–転生したら巨根オークだった件\n\nReincarnated Orc is at the moment my favorite HRPG of 2020. The game oozes utter enthusiasm from every pore, and the opening to the game is just a rollercoaster of hilarious moments and high production value. The developer clearly poured their soul into this game and the result is an HRPG with some of the best writing and humor I’ve played all year. It helps that the core concept appeals to my tastes as well, with the protagonist being reincarnated as an orc (lol) in an isekai, and proceeding to engage in a journey to create a harem with his massive orc dick. His attempt to get the goddess who summoned him into bed is, quite possibly, the funniest fight scene in any HRPG – it really has to be seen to be believed. And despite how that might make it sound, the story itself is fairly wholesome and has a heartwarming ending. The one flaw with this game is that there’s a lot of CG reuse, and some of the h-scenes in general could have been handled a bit better.\n\n–外道勇者一行\n\nThug Hero Party is in some ways a deconstruction of the NTR genre, or at least, it’s an artistic and meaningful look on the nature of NTR; what first looks like yet another generic “cute best friend gets NTR’d away by chad thundercock” story actually has a lot of meaningful things to say, and I can only hope that the ending isn’t spoiled for you because the last couple hours of this game are the definition of PURE KINO. The themes and message within this game are powerful and convey valuable ideas, though the ludonarrative harmony of the NTR is so despair-heavy that I don’t blame people for not necessarily being able to see past the presentation. All I can say is, THP is one of the finest written HRPGs I’ve played, and there’s a lot of depth beneath the surface.\n\n–彼女が奴隷になった理由\n\nDorei Riyuu (okay I just made this abbreviation up) is a humble game. It has no grand or epic plot, nor does it aspire to be anything more than a nice fappable game. But what it does have in spades is passion and care; the game is filled to the brim with various different minigames, side content, cute little moments, and so on. It’s just a really fun game to play without any boring RPG maker combat wearing the experience down, it’s just a ton of content, all of it good. The art style is a bit unique, but by the end of the game I really loved how adorable the protagonist is, and the ending of the game is surprisingly touching. All in all this is a supremely well made game with a lot of fappable moments. It’s kind of my golden standard for a “girl explores a city/area while lewd things happen to her” kind of game – if only they all had so much content and effort put into them.\n\n–ナコの魔法と純欲の怪人\n\nThe first thing to know about Nako is that it has such supremely lewd art and scenes that there’s an actual option to tone down the content of the h-scenes, マイルド version vs んほぉ version. The ahegaos, semen-expnansion, and even lewd words are so extreme in the Nhoooh version they decided to include an option to tone everything down. Suffice to say, the porn in this game is incredibly powerful and achieves a degree of depravity that I can only wish other developers matched more often. But even putting that aside, this game is a realm gem. Unlike most games on this list, the gameplay is inspired by Tales of Phantasia and has like side-scrolling action for its battles, which is really neat. The plot is also VERY expansive, with a ton of time dedicated to the story, the characters, etc. It’s a very fleshed out game, and there’s even a DLC pack available to add even MORE scenes and stuff, which is crazy. All in all Nako is a game with no weaknesses for me, it’s good in every area – fappable art, nice story, nice gameplay, etc. The only problem with it is that it can be so hot that the story taking up so much time might get annoying when you really want to see the next h-scene.\n\n–クベルの首枷病\n\nKubel is peak NTR game for me. There’s one thing that must firmly be established: there is 1 NTR man, and throughout the entire game he is the only one to sleep with the main heroine. This isn’t like a game with 5 NTR mans all competing for her, or a game where she chills in a brothel while NTR man bangs her. No, it is pure 1 on 1 NTR, and the result is easily one of the most thorough and hot corruption arcs I’ve ever seen. The corruption process is very slow, but when she finally starts breaking down at the end it’s satisfying in a way beyond words – never before has the idiom “cum buckets” been so true. That said, while Kubel is legendary to me for achieving this incredible corruption arc, it has a lot of weaknesses. The gameplay itself is surpremely repetitive (running through a randomly generated dungeon over and over; no random battles, just repetitive running) and the endings aren’t that good either. I’m not sure how many people will rank it up among one of their favorites like me, but in my case, the pristine NTR makes it all worth it for me.\n\n–マオウオツ\n\nMaou Otsu is a hidden gem that I feel comfortable recommending to pretty much everyone. It’s a rare case of an HRPG having really cool gameplay and top-tier writing, which should appeal to most people. The porn is what you see on the DLsite page, but what you don’t see is just how hilarious this game is. My good friend Teru said that while playing it, he was struck with a sense of disbelief, like “Is this game REALLY this funny? Is it even possible?” and well, the answer is yes. The plot is pretty hype too, with a steady train of reveals – it’s very much a game that begins in media res, and then you slowly piece together the greater plot in a really satisfying way. The later chapter where you play as two heroines form the first chapter is an excellent change of pace and where the writing really starts to shine. The biggest flaw with this game is just that the first chapter of the game is a bit repetitive, and requires a kind of silly thing. (Yes, you really do have to do what you think you have to do to beat the boss of CH1. It’s crazy, I know. Lol.)\n\n–フィラーナと命の薬\n\nAh, Filana. What a game. If you ever asked to yourself “who is the biggest slut in gaming,” look no further than Filana. The appeal to this game is the sheer extreme depth to which Filana falls; there are some reviews which say the sheer sluttiness of her sex talk once she gets corrupted took them out of the experience because they just could not believe what they were reading. I cannot blame them whatsoever. But putting that aside, the game itself is pretty solid. It’s a CG hunter in the vein of Fallen or Violated Heroine where you explore a town and progress the plot to get H-scenes while accumulating Lewdness Points. There’s a nice variety to the scenes, and in general I found the art to be reasonably high quality. But what puts this game in my top 10 is undoubtedly how incredibly perverted the main heroine gets, and how the game reflects this in a ton of hilarious ways. The writing in this respect is top-notch, and it’s just… man, I don’t want to spoil what the game does, but trust me – it’s hilarious. If your peepee gets hard at girls getting lewd and cock-hungry, then this game is paradise.\n\n–紅獄の剣士ティーナ\n\nTiina is a Fallen Makina clone. There’s really no way to get around this. As far as I know the dev has gone on written record as saying Makina was such a huge influence on him that he immediately made a game of his own in its image, with Makina dev’s permission of course, though I’ve never found the actual blog where he said this. Either way, everything from the main heroine design to the kinography of the h-scenes is reminscient of Makina, but in my opinion, this game has plenty of its own virtues. First and foremost is the superior game design – gone is the repetitive dungeons of Makina, with the plot instead progressing through investigating a town. There’s no RPG maker battles bogging things down, and hoenstly the plot itself is kind of cool too. There’s also an immense amount of HCGs, especially after the dev released a patch; the amount of content you get for this game is insane, and since the developer drew from the best of Makina, a lot of the H-scenes are supremely good. The best thing this game done is really sow the seeds for each arc, so that when the heroines finally bang someone/something it feels great instead of just… something meh happening out of nowhere. That said, Tiina has one thing that’s a dealbreaker for some – the dudes are fucking disgusting. Tiina’s dev fucking loves disgusting old men that are painful to look at, and this game is certainly filled with them. Enjoying this game will really require either looking past them or enjoying the added sense of corruption that their disgusting looks add. But either way, Tiina is ultimately a testament of how much can be accomplished when developers learn from each other – a minor dev making kind of bland VNs instantly shot up to being one of the most famous and best-selling HRPG devs overnight after he took inspiration from a game he liked and strove to improve his own games.\n\nTier 2: Platinum\n\n–機核覚醒～六欲姫ユーカ～\n\nThe first gameplay-focused game on this list, Core Awakening is the second game in a series of H-platformers about robot lolis. I’ve sort of made it a habit of mine to play a bunch of h-platformers in search of ones with actually good gameplay, and while most of the time I’m greatly disappointed, Core Awakening is a STRONG exception. It’s a megaman-esque game with 8 robot masters to defeat and all that good stuff, but what sets it apart is the fact that when you beat a robot master, you get to play as the robot master immediately. Not only do you accumulate moves, you accumulate playable characters. This means that each boss you beat unlocks a new playable character to play, AND a move for every single character you’ve already unlocked. Needless to say it’s a ton of fun beating stages and then playing around with your increasingly large roster of robot lolis. The stages themselves are a bit simple, but the appeal of megaman (imo anyway) isn’t in challenging platformer so much as playing around with your tools, which this game certainly allows you to do. There’s a ton of side content available as well, and even a banging OST composed just for this game – here’s two tracks I like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyU8qXOY_w4 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HymknZ5ocAM . All in all this is probably the best H-platformer I’ve played, just for being so fun and cool.\n\n–ソニアと催眠都市\n\nSonia and the Hypnosis City has such gorgeous art that at times I didn’t even feel like fapping to it, since it’s just so pretty to look at. I really can’t emphasize enough how pretty this artwork is, and thanks to the game’s high resolution you can really take in all the details. Sonia is a surprisingly linear game, where you go from one H-scene to the other on a largely railroaded path, but this actually helps with the pacing, and there’s plot consistency between scenes – never is something done then just forgotten, so to speak, like would be necessary in a more non-linear game. The gameplay is neat but not particularly interesting (it’s just a rock/paper/scissors kind of thing with percentages). Pretty much all the appeal is in the hypnosis and the art, so if you like hypnosis and think the art looks nice, you should be satisfied – there’s nice scene variety and plenty of content for nutting to.\n\n–プロナント・シンフォニー\n\nPronant Symphony feels to me the author thinking: what if hypnosis was taken seriously, and its effects on relationships actually examined? The game opens with the protagonist, a hypnonist, challenging a dungeon with 4 adventurer sisters he hypnotized together – he needs to do something deep in the dungeon, and he’s too weak to do it himself. The story of the game is all about analyzing his insecurity over how his bonds with the sisters are fake – they would leave him if the hypnosis broke, wouldn’t they? They’re smiling at him now, but they would hate him if the hypnosis broke, wouldn’t they? They’re helping him in battle, but they would just leave if the hypnosis broke, wouldn’t they? Etc etc. It’s a surprisingly mature story and the relationship between the MC/the sisters is really well done. The plot is Epic as well, with a lot of buildup as you get further down the floors and various elements coalesce. Suffice to say the finale is pretty emotional. The gameplay is also pretty neat with a “limited use of moves” system a la Rance Quest, though personally a lot of the fancy elements like different floors having different environmental effects on the battles didn’t actually change much for me.\n\n–働くアイリがキリ斬りス\n\nHataraku Airi is a game that surprised me. At first glance it’s yet another femMC rape simulator, and while… it is that… there’s also some strong writing backing everything up. The protagonist is turbobitch extraordinare, and her dialogue is actually just hilarious to read because she’s just such an unfathomably bad person. There’s more to her than meets the eye, though, and her backstory is revealed through some H-events that are pretty entertaining – the guy trying to hypnotize her into being the ideal GF really had NO IDEA what he was getting into. The plot ends up pretty cool as well, so yeah, all in all a pretty swell game. The one thing to be cautious about though is that this is NOT a light hearted game. A lot of HRPGs games kind of soften the sexual violence going on by being light-hearted and making it clear it’s all just fetish stuff, but Airi does not do this at all, and the result is some uncomfortably realistic H-scenes at times.\n\n–魔導士ティアと不思議な大図書館\n\nTear is a game by Acerola, one of the most popular h-game developers out there. Their games are well known for having a ton of content, releasing at a steady schedule, and having staples like heart-pupils, dressup for the protagonist girl, a “prostitute every male NCP you can find” system that activates when you get lewd enough, and more. Most of their games I’m not too fond of, because the INSANE amount of content means that there’s no coherent corruption progression at all, just a scattering of like 300 h-scenes, but Tear manages to REALLY get it right in my opinion. First of all, both the protagonist and her soft-titted older sister are omega hotties. Second of all, the corruption is MUCH better written than any of their games, since Tear is a tsundere and the transition from Tsun to Dere is actually 10/10. Third of all, the older sister gets her own linear side series (being sexually trained once per in-game night), so a lot more focus could be put on making the progression satisfying and steady. And finally, I don’t know what it is, but the art in Tear is just sooo much better than their other games. Some of the CGs are insta-nut for me, and really the scenarios in general are incredibly nut. I don’t know entirely what it is, but everything about Tear just combines to be an uber-nut game with a flurry of incredibly kami scenes, smooth progression, hot art, hot corruption, etc etc. I don’t know if it will click with everyone like it did for me, but damn, this is by far my favorite Acerola game.\n\n–IrisHeart\n\nAhhh, NTR. IrisHeart is the quintessential femMC NTR HRPG. There’s a city the plot is based in, there’s like 8 NTR men sitting around, and you go through their H-scenes while accumulating Lewd Points which eventually make you Lewd enough to access the next H-scene in a sequence. IrisHeart nevertheless is one my favorite of these kinds of NTR games because, quite simply, the main heroine is one of my favorite archetypes – emotionless, silver-haired android. The NTR feels so much more powerful when she’s going from emotionless lover of the MC to like panting and ahegaoing as she raves about how great NTR man’s huge cock is. I would really like to see more emotionless silver-haired android GFs in HRPGs. There’s also a lot of variety of the scenes, each NTR-man is distinct, with probably the most unique one being a hacker who installs the mind of a prostitute android onto the heroine before removing it at the end of the h-scenes. Stuff like that. The one flaw of this game, however, is the main plot. It’s a total snooze cruise and you’re probably better off holding CTRL to skip the plot. Note that H-scene progression is blocked by plot; NTR-man 5 will stop talking to the heroine at all after a few scenes until you get to chapter 4, that kind of thing.\n\n–王国の守護天使\n\nBefore I begin talking about this game I would like to note that Sugar Star is an IRL milf who shows her teenage son her character designs and asks for his opinion on it. I am 100% serious, check her blog. Anyway. Sex Angel Ariel is one of the few loli corruption games on DLsite that aren’t extremely tentacle focused so that gets a thumbs up from me. It’s one of those games where you start extremely high level and intentionally walk her into lewd situations which lower her level, which is always fun. Ariel is really adorable and when she gets lewd it’s pretty nut; I like the moment where something clicks in her head and she swaps from using “ochinchin” to “chinpo-sama”. The big-titted side heroine is nut as well, in general I like angel corruption so this is a double win. The plot is surprisingly cool too with some surprises here and there. I don’t have much bad to say about this game, it’s ton of fun and I’m glad a loli HRPG actually suited my tastes for once.\n\n–魔女は復讐の夜に\n\nAn action platformer that rips off… ahem, I mean, is inspired by Bloodborne and the souls series. In general I’m not a huge fan of H-platformers since I find the dialogue-less and impromptu H-scenes lacking any weight whatsoever, so NoR like every other H-platformer on this list is here largely for the gameplay. It’s cool the explore the world, the level design makes sense, and the bosses are actually pretty cool – the church boss has a lot of dope fanart since it really captures that “Epic Duel” feel that Souls games do. It’s incomplete, though, like… extremely incomplete. So it’s hard to recommend. Still, I figured it deserved a spot up here, since it’s one of the more impressive H-platformers out there, and it has a big following.\n\n-幽香ー散らばった大妖怪の欠片ー\n\nNow here’s a lewd one. Yuuka Kakera is the debut game of Amazon, a storied h-manga artist. It’s surprisingly well put together for a first game and has some interesting ideas; Yuuka had her “understanding of sex” turned into 6 crystals and scattered across the world. As the male MC you go hunting for them with her tagging along. The trick is that after getting a crstyal, you can break it, so Yuuka increasingly understands less about sex – at first she’s fairly hostile towards lewdness, then she doesn’t mind stripping in front of people, then she doesn’t mind people groping her, and then… etc. It’s pretty unique progression since instead of going from “pure” to “slutty”, she goes from “pure” to “having no resistance to lewdness, thinking it’s totally normal” etc etc. Anyway I put this game this high mainly because the art is just supremely good; most HRPG devs are not professional manga artists, so the art in this game is very much above average. Yuuka is so enormously thicc that it might turn some peoepl away, but this is exactly my kind of style.\n\n–アンブロシア\n\nThe genre of HRPGs where you play as a girl and purposely put her into increasingly lewd situations are at times called “slutsims”, and Ambrosia is certainly a supreme slut sim. You play as a priestess sent to a remote island for the purpose of shilling her religion there, and the dev really goes far with this concept – instead of just having generic scenes or having the setting be taped on, the first thing you’re doing in this game is going out to town and actually shilling the religion. It’s cute and there’s chibi art for events like this. As time goes on things escalate; people groping her during the shilling raises lewd points, and as more people are attracted to the church by the sheer hotness of the babe protagonist you actually get more traffic in the church itself, which you can buy upgrades for. The dungeons are generally neat, and there’s a LOT of content here. The production values are way higher than average and the art is really cute. The plot is also reasonably nice, though it won’t make or break the game. What stands out about this game is definitely the quality of the art, the effort put into building the game around shilling the church, and just the heroine being max kawaii.\n\nTier 3: Gold\n\n–うさみみボウケンタン\n\nA kamige of plotge, if you will. I have described this game as “Undertale if you had a bunny companion that you could have sex with”. I feel somewhat confident saying the developer actually modeled the game directly after Undertale because thematically and in structure they’re pretty similar, but well, they’re different enough that it doesn’t ruin the game or anything. Rabbit Adventure has plenty of its own personality, with the battle system in it actually being based on quizzes – to beat the Bananas Professor, you don’t cut him to pieces, you answer questions about bananas. It’s as charming as it sounds and it’s definitely one of those games that slowly escalate over time, starting out warm and fluffy then ending with an explosion of noise and insane reveals (much like Undertale!). There aren’t many HRPGs I liked purely for the plot and writing, but this is one of them.\n\n–人妻エルフのお留守番\n\nElf Rusuban is a classic, released way back in… 2016… which is apparent from its design philosophy which has somewhat fallen by the wayside. It’s a femMC corruption game (have you noticed that’s the genre I like most yet?) that puts a LOT of time developiong side characters and side heroines; there’s a truckload of dudes with sprites in this game, which isn’t something you see all the time. The most distinctive part of this game is the large focus on humor, with there being a ton of wackiness and general silliness throughout – despite being NTR, it’s really about as light-hearted as you can possibly get, with cartoony characters and a ton of energy. You never know what the next H-scene is going to be like, and it might even be hard to fap since you’re just more invested in progressing the plot and talking to side characters. Honestly I’m probably hyping it up a little too much, but really, few femMC corruption games put this much effort into fleshing out the town it takes place in and going so nutty with the humor. I played it back in 2016 and I still distinctly remember stuff like the combat master rabbit, or the weirdo doctor, or the item shop owner who hates his wife, etc etc.\n\n–THE HEART OF DARKNESS\n\nThe Heart of Darkness is one of many HRPGs inspired directly by Dark Souls. However, what makes it stand out among them is the degree of effort put into the worldbuilding. It might actually have the best tiling out of any HRPG I’ve played; the environments are seriously beautiful, which is not something I often am able to say about RPG maker games. The H art itself stands in almost comical contrast to the gorgeous pixel art, and this is definitely not a game I fapped to a single time. In any case, the gameplay itself is largely based on exploration, with a 2 party member system that doesn’t allow for much strategy – the highlight is finding the bosses, not fighting them. Also, you find party members in the world, so exploration feels extremely rewarding – each new party member has some fun lore to read and a cool design, so it’s really nice.\n\n–爆災雷鋼ライオウガー\n\nThis is a game I honestly feel embarrassed about having so high, but I like what I like so here it is. RaiOhGar is a game about a strong, independent red-haired mech engineer and her faceless soon to be NTR’d husband heading to some islands to fight off alien invaders in their super mech. The residents of the island are some real horn dogs, and with some quick blackmail our red-haired heroine is forced into sexual situations. The fun part of is this game is the missions; the heroine Asuka assists the protagonist on a voice call, but as the NTR progresses she gets increasingly distracted, going from telling you how to avoid enemies / get treasure to accidentally leading you right into a big group of nasty monsters because she’s too distracted by the dick she’s sucking right out of call of the video. It’s pretty funny, and I like the quality of the art overall, so it’s pretty high up here. The climatic post-corruption scenes for each of the NTR men are pretty nice too. Ultimately this is actually not a great game, but the setting and main heroine are so 1:1 to my tastes that it gets an immense boost.\n\n–SEQUEL Blight (Series)\n\nThe Sequel series has been growing in popularity rapidly after the translations for it have come out, and for good reason. The Sequel Series has just about everything you could ask in an HRPG – solid but not oppressive gameplay, top-tier character designs, and erotic art. The developer is an ass man, which is rare in HRPGs, and truly the asses in this game are something to behold. The Sequel games are good enough that I could see them being someone’s favorite games, and they really are something special. Personally they’re held back a little for me due to the silent MC and somewhat weak plotting, but they’re fun games and seriously the characters are ridiculously good looking. This guy has some of the best art in HRPGs I think.\n\n–夏色のコワレモノ\n\nAn NTR game by the guy who did Tiina up in Tier 1. A lot of NTR HRPGs are NTR in name only, with the actual content basically being a fem MC going around on a wondrous quest to bang as many dudes as possible. This game, however, is NTR in the truest since – you play a male character whose childhood friend gets NTR’d by others outside of your reach. You kick off the NTR arcs, but once they’ve started you have little involvement in them – and in fact, it’s pretty easy to finish the game without seeing a single h-scene, since most of them are contained within a dairy which you click to view the scenes after they happen. While controlling the character, you can hear the shuffling clothes and creaking beds behind doors, but you don’t get to see what actually happens unless you go to the diary. It’s a pretty unique set up, and the production values are pretty nutty at times (especially when you see the sex happening through shadows and windows etc). This is a pretty neat game and I like the art, but ultimately having to view the H-scenes only after they happen really makes me like it less than I would otherwise. It’s lacking a lot of the immersion and immediate gratification that makes so many HRPGs so addicting. Still, it’s an above-average HRPG to be sure. The release was fairly explosive as well, instantly topping charts and getting a TON of fanart from other H-game developers. It feels like the entire HRPG community in Japan really likes this dev and wants him to succeed. It’s nice.\n\n–討魔の乙女\n\nRemember what I said about loving emotionless silver haired heroines back in IrisHeart? While, take everything I said there and apply it here as well. The sole reason this game is so high is because I love the main heroine’s archetype, which enhances all of her h-scenes. So keep that in mind. As for the game itself, well, it’s pretty meh. I strongly recommend just savehacking max stats to skip the dungeons since they’re like rogulike randomly generated junk. There’s some nice H-scenes though.\n\n–NTRヒロイン クリスタルミナ\n\nYet another game I’m embarrassed to have so high, but I have to be honest with my dick. NTR Crystal Mina has hilariously amateurish art with some of the most awful anatomy around, and the most impressive thing about the CGs is how the main heroine seems to be stuck in a quasi state of either being a loli or being a small-headed 25 year old. with a thicc body. That said, this game as some top-tier corruption writing and a pretty big anal focus, which is supremely rare in HRPGs and why I rate it so highly. The biggest problem is just the CG reuse, with each CG being used 4 times, so like 15 CGs are bloated into 60 scenes. This is probably the first of many games on here which most people won’t actually like, but it appeals to me in a really specific and weird way, so here it is up in Gold. Remember, this is not an objective list! Don’t play this and lose faith in me, please!\n\n–ヴァンパイア・ノーツ\n\nNow Vampire Notes is a cute game. The two girl protagonists are so cute that really, one’s interest in this game can be determined largely by the visuals. If you think the girls are cute then gogogogo. The writing is pretty amusing too, with the protagonist vampire being addicted to gacha, and there being some funny skits that get the plot in motion – there’s some effort put into the presentation of the story. One thing of note is that Vampire Notes is an HRPG that uses “piecemeal” CGs instead of normal CGs for a lot of the scenes, which is to say, there’s a generic “blowjob” CG, a general close-up of a vagoo getting a penos put into it, etc that are reused a lot when the situation calls for it. It’s not quite normal CG reuse, because it’s more like an elaborate collection of different poses/etc that are used when the time calls for it. Maybe the preview images will make it more clear. Anyway, Vampire Notes is a cute and funny game with top-tier art, so I like it.\n\n–爆乳エルフ嫁と早漏くん\n\nSometimes the name of a game just says it all. NTR Elf Wife is a funny game in how it borders betweent having just absolutely gorgerous, stunning art and having incredibly chunky, weirdly preportioned art. The titular Elf Wife will jump between being a stunningly beautiful woman to being a chunky sex demon in the blink of an eye. That said, chunky sex demons are pretty hot, so it doesn’t bother me. This is an NTR game with a semi-hypnosis focus and a very strangely complicated setting (the NTR man is literally the head of a branch of the country’s communist party lmao), but despite this it still ends up fairly generic, hitting a lot of standard NTR beats. The stand-out for all of this is definitely the quality of the art and the presence of animation; if you think the main girl is hot and don’t mind NTR, this game shouldn’t disappoint. You can also play from the cuck’s perspective and try to stop the NTR / watch it happen from afar, but who would waste their time with that? Not me.\n\n鈍感勇者とセクハラし放題の女騎士\n\nWowee. Okay. I know the art is shit. Don’t @ me. I know. Look, the actual game is good! I mean, if you like NTR it’s good. Hopefully if you have gotten to this point you know I like NTR HRPGs which are actually just thinly disguised corruption games. Anyway. Donkan Yuusha is up this high because it does a pretty solid job of weaving the plot together with the H; in a LOT of HRPGs the h-content is largely delineated from the main plot and it’s like the plot takes a break to have the H done separately, but in this game the H occurs as you progress the plot, so the characters are more meaningfully affected by it. The writing is (surprisingly) above average, although nothing special, and the art in the HCGs is actually a lot better than the tachie you see on the preview image, so all in all the game is a lot better than how it first appears. This is a must-play for NTR/corruption fans in my opinion, if the tachie isn’t a dealbreaker for you anyway. If it is I totally understand. This is a game only for true degenerates.\n\nTier 4: Silver\n\n–ナイツ・オブ・メサイア\n\nNow this is a weird one. Knights of Messiah is like a pristine example of how crazy HRPGs can get when they’re made by a crazy dude, in this case a guy named Gyu. The plot of Knights of Messiah is baffingly elaborate and filled with actually brutal action scenes, to give you an idea in one of them the protagonist comes across the Empire-analogue mass murdering civilians so he challenges their general, but they’re so overwhelmingly stronger than him he ends up just desperately trying to stab her eyes out so he can at least do lasting damage to their army. That kind of thing. The music consists of free tracks, but some of them are supremely good and I’ve never heard them anywhere else, so I often say Knights of Messiah has one of the best OSTs in HRPGs. There’s just two problems. One, the gameplay is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BAD. Gyu loves scaling enemies and stuff, which I hate soooo much. Two, the NTR is honestly bizarre, even for me. There’s like no coherency to the progression, with H-scenes happening all over the place at random times, and it’s so fetishistic in strange ways even me as a big NTR stan struggles to really get into it. I hope you really like girls dogezaing and taping their vagoos open? Overall it’s just an… interesting game with many cool qualities but many flaws as well.\n\n–聖剣の勇者のヤリまくり英雄譚\n\nThere’s something that I just really love about this art. The ahegaos are powerful , the girls thicc, and everything is all just so perfect. This is a pretty light-hearted game about a Hero in a JRPG going around fucking everything, as the name implies. As you can guess there’s basically no serious plot or anyuthing here, just the protagonist traveling around and accumulating H-scenes at each location. Normally a huge number of heroines would make me like a game less, but this game manages to make each h-scene satisfying even without a ton of buildup. As one last note, the final boss is actually one of the hardest and most satisfying JRPG bosses I’ve ever beaten. Reason being, I REALLY wanted to bang the Maou, but I did NOT want to waste time grinding, so I got to her (the final boss) severely underleveled. But I was determined to win and get the h-scenes, so I threw myself at her over and over until I narrowly managed to scrape out a victory after like an hour of plotting. I really doubt almost anyone else will have the same experience, but I’ll personally never forget the crazy time I had trying to win, and that really boosts it up in my mind.\n\n–MARRIAGE OR PERVERT\n\nAnother game with art by a manga artist (Ichinomiya Yuu), Marriage or Pervert is a fun little “go on an adventure with your wife” game where, as always, you intentionally put the heroine in sexually compromising situations that make her increasingly lewd over time. The actual gameplay in this game isn’t good at all, and everything is pretty low-effort, but the quality of Ichinomiya’s art alone makes this worth playing. The writing is also pretty funny, there’s two versions of each scene based on how many Lewd Points the heroine has, and the lewd versions of scenes can be just hilarious since her personality changes so dramatically. My favorite is when a guy tries to hypnotize the wife into being lewd and sucking his dick, but if she’s already lewd it doesn’t work, which leads to her just pretending to be hypnotized and going like “Oh noooo I’m being forced to suck his dick I can’t stop this noooo”. That kind of thing. The quality of the art and the hilarity of the lewd scenes makes up for the rest of the game being supremely low effort in my opinion.\n\n–なんでも調査少女ＲＰＧ\n\nThis is actually based on a manga series by the same name, which is super cool – they liked the series so much they asked to make a game out of. The result is pretty neat in how it captures the /feel/ of the manga’s theme, which is somewhat emotionless girls entirely unfazed by sex just getting dudes all over the place running at them. It’s fully animated and recreates a lot of scenes from the manga, which again is cool since I’m a fan of the series. One of the cooler parts is that as you do more h-scenes, your fame increases around the city, and more people will attack the protagonists on sight. You can really feel the change in the world over time. Ultimately the animated nature of the scenes makes them less fappable for me, but as a game in general I quite like it.\n\n–Lizbel\n\nLizbel was originally called Atelier Lizbel until Gust copyright noticed them. Whoops! It’s a charming little loli game modeled after the Atelier series, and while it doesn’t quite live up to their pedigree, it’s still a charming little game to run through. The characters are reasonably charming and the production value is high, with nice tiling and menus and so on. There’s even an expansion DLC pack you can DL for more content. If you like the art style, Atelier, and lolis then it’s probably worth giving a play through, although it won’t blow you away.\n\n–戦巫女ミズキ\n\nOh thank god, another NTR RPG. I was starting to be afraid that there weren’t any more coming. Anyway, Mizuki is a pretty amusing game since it’s literally a pokemon clone – the world map, combat system, etc etc are all literally taken from Pokemon. And yet it’s a corruption NTR game. Like I said, pretty amusing. Another funny thing about this game is that the artist improved a LOT while making the game, so the final CGs all look really good and nice, whereas the earlier CGs are more amateurish. This puts my feelings on the game in a weird spot, since the final CGs are all like 10/10 god tier for me, while the earlier game is kind of a meh 6/10. Either way, it’s an amusing game and the NTR can be pretty nice. I particularly like how the protagonist’s mom went missing after a climatic duel with the NTR man, so there’s some dramatic (furi: erotic) tension throughout the game as you hunt for NTR man to find out what happened to her. There’s also an EPIC twist on the NTR which is, quite possibly, the best twist in any NTR story, just because of how insane it is and how out of left field it comes. The story itself isn’t that good but the twist had me rolling on the floor laughing. Anyway, funny game.\n\n–ニプルヘイムの狩人\n\nBranded Azel! I’ll just say it right now – this is one of the easiest RPGs I’ve ever played. It’s just so mind-boggingly easy to win every fight, and although it tries to style itself after Monster Hunter it just… uh… Fails. That said, the art style is really appealing, the author really makes great expressions. The plot is also passably neat. I have surprisingly few things to say about this game on second thought, it has nice pixel art and production value but not much else comes to mind. It’s neat how the H-scenes are portrayed with live updates to the heroine’s status, including her orgasming like 50 times in a single scene.\n\n–Wife Quest\n\nI honestly don’t have much to say about this game because I forgot so much about it, but check out the name. Wife Quest. Isn’t that just epic? I think so. I really like this developer’s art and appreciate the direction he goes with it; this is also a game that blends the plot with the h-scenes in a pretty nice way. The art is also on the higher echelon for HRPGs, with solid shading and attractive anatomy (to me anwyay). His newest game has some truly beautiful HCGs. The only problem with Wife Quest, really, is that it doesn’t quite clench the ending for me. I would have like 2-3 more finale CGs with some more passion from the main heroine. But well, I can’t complain too much.\n\n–ナイトメアガールズ\n\nNightmare Girls is a game by the HRPG circle which I feel by far the most conflicted about. Put simply, I really do not like tentacles at all, and this circle’s favorite and primary fetish is tentacles. These games have almost no human penetration at all actually, and the h-scenes which do exist are dominated by tentacles, monsters, yuri, and so on. These games have insane amounts of content and solid turn-based battling (the uber hard mode Nightmare demands actual strategizing), but god damn, I just don’t like the porn. It’s pretty feelsbad. Oh well. I guess that pretty much sums up my thoughts too: nice art, cute girls, high production values, etc. My favorite part about this game is how the Recollection Room for H-scenes has an in-universe lore reason that actually makes every h-scene in the game more hilarious, which is good. If you like tentacles (and monster sex to some degree?) then this circle might just be the best thing to ever happen in your life.\n\n–DepraviA Egrigori\n\nThis is the third h-platformer on this list, and surprisingly, it has the best level design of them all. If you’ve played a bunch of modern H platformers before you might actually be shocked by how tight the mechanics and level design are on here. On top of that, the gore theme gives the game an INCREDIBLY oppressive atmosphere. To be clear, I really don’t like gore. I don’t fap to it, it even makes me uncomfortable at times. I’m not rating this game highly because I like gore. I’m rating it highly because the ATMOSPHERE produced by the gore is unlike many things I’ve played before. When you see enemies torturing people in the background, then see one of those enemies rushing you way, and you KNOW if they hit you with that blade it’s actually going to leave permanent damage, then it’s much easier to freak the fuck out, or at least feel genuinely uncomfortable. The intense environments, production value, and solid level design combine to make this one of the best h-platformers out there… even though the gore is so extreme it’s unfappable and actually uncomfortable. Conflicting I know, but what can I say. Incidentally, this is like a remake or something of the original DepraviA, but I never played that one.\n\n–Celestite\n\nThis is another game from Orange Piece, the developers of IrisHeart. The game design is also exactly the same: tacked on plot that cucks you from exploring the city as the girl and accumulating Lewd Points with the various NTR men. Honestly, literally all of my points from IrisHeart apply here since they’re basically clones, so I don’t have anything new to say in that respect. All I can say is that IrisHeart is as high as it is because emotionless android -> cock-starved aheagoing android is pretty great, whereas Celestite’s tsundere witch -> cock-starved ahegaoing witch is a lot more common. Still, I like it a lot; there’s something deeply satisfying about Orange Piece’s corruption, and each individual NTR man has their own appeal thanks to the different themes they introduce (though I always end up liking the main NTR man the most since he gets the most scenes and the heroine falls for him the hardest). Also, Celestite’s heroine has a really hot outfit. Love that side boob. And front boob.\n\nTier 5: Bronze\n\n–勇者様は俺の嫁っ\n\nFor the first time in a while, a game that’s good for the plot. There’s not many games on here I rec purely for the plot, and I’m not sure if that’s just a reflection of HRPGs tending to be good just for the porn or if I’m just not aware of a ton of kamige of plot. Either way, Yuusha Yome has some nice writing. The art looks incredibly disgusting, I know, but the H is basically all optional so you can just skip it and focus on the writing. The cast is surprisingly charming and the jokes are funny, especially the callbacks that build up as the plot progresses. Some characters that seem like joke characters end up surprisingly interesting.\n\n–セイクリッドプリンセス 聖王女物語\n\nSo this is one of those “dumb hot girl gets tricked into doing lewd things and then starts to like it” kind of games. What sets it apart, though, and what gets it so high on my list, is the KINO second half. The protagonist of the first half has a child, and sends her off on her own journey in the second half. The daughter retraces the mother’s steps and encounters the same NTR people her mother did, which results in some hilarious callbacks and scenes. The art is pretty amatuerish and this is definitely not a game with universal appeal, but I feel a strange fondness for this circle and the simplicity of the H. Consider this game a stand-in for the rest of the circle’s games as well, none of which were good enough to make it up here but are still cute in their own way. Married Warrior Emma is one of the most popular translated HRPGs of all time, too.\n\n–落第魔女イリスと賢者の石\n\nOkay okay okay. I know the DLsite preview image is not impressive. However, this is another game where the artist significantly improved over time, and ironically the character sprites which he drew first ended up way worse than the rest of the game’s art. This game has INCREDIBLY thicc heroines, and some really sweaty h-scenes, which leads to some high-level eroticism despite how it may seem at first glance. The h-scenes are also woven into the plot, with one of my favorites being a fisherman guy who tags along with the party during the volcano dungeon, and if a girl ever ends up in the “arousal” state during battle he can pound them back to normal, which is pretty hot. The dev also added a lot of content in patches, so there’s a decent amount of scenes to go through. I also really like the final boss, it gets surprisingly epic/chuuni during the final showdown. All in all this is a supremely perverted game that’s largely built on the h-scenes, so just look at the previews and ask yourself how attracted you art to girls with boobs 3x the size of their head. If the answer is yes, go forth, and have an OK time with this OK game.\n\n–Rune’s Pharmacy\n\nRune’s Pharmacy is something of a classic of the “Play as a cute girl” genre. It also has something of an Atelier vibe and there’s a lot of item collection/crafting. The most important aspect of this game is the pee meter, which builds up and requries the protagonist to pee. Keep this in mind, it’s important. Anyway, the art is cute and I like the atmosphere of the game. I don’t actually have much to say about the game though, it’s a pretty standard CG collector that’s carried by the quality of the art and the like, so if you like how it looks then it might be worth playing based on that alone. The developer’s upcoming game looks pretty 10/10 kami though. This is a dev that understands where to put effort into the production values to really make something shine.\n\n–女騎士リフィナ～亡国の女騎士淫辱旅～\n\nAnother game from the devs who did 討魔の乙女. There’s something about this dev’s art that I really like; the blushing of the heroines, their anatomy, the angles in the scenes… It’s all very tasteful and nice. You could say the game is up this far entirely just because I like the art, because the scenes themselves are a bit of a mixed bag. The game follows a pretty generic “accumulate lewd points” structure, and there’s only one significant NTR arc (which ends on a disappointing scene anyway), so it’s very much a pump and dump kind of game with pointless gameplay on top. Still, it’s one of the first HRPGs I played, and it’s not bad or anything, so I still like it.\n\n–セラ＆ノエル～囚われしプリンセスの行方～\n\nNow this is a conflicting game. Sera and Noelle has all the makings of a kamige, but it just didn’t quite manage to stick the landing. The art is cute, the story is decent, the characters are nice, and so on. I like basically everything about the game. The only problem is, it doesn’t quite stick the landing. The h-scenes are nice, but Sera never really gets fully corrupted, and Noelle doesn’t get nearly as many scenes as her. There’s a hot nun sister, but she only gets a few scenes, and the hottest girl in the game – the pink haired princess – only gets ONE scene. The game has so much content it feels bad asking for more, but this game would be in Tier 2 or higher if it just had 5-10 more scenes at the end with the princess and Sera/Noelle fully corrupted. Oh well. Regardless, this is a reasonably fun game with amusing writing and (despite what I said) decent content at 42HCGs and 56 scenes. It’s worth playing, it just… Disappoints me.\n\n–忘却のイグドラシル\n\nAnother game by the Branded Azel dev, if you couldn’t tell from the art alone. This is a conflicting one for me. The vast majority of H-scenes in this game are prostitution, which I’m not a huge fan of. If it weren’t for that I would probably like it a lot more, but alas. Putting that aside, this is a neat game. The plot is neat and has some impressive production values at times, with the final boss in particular being a fairly flashy and epic showdown. The H-scenes themselves are impressively drawn, and different classes having the protagonist wear different dresses is really nice; I particularly like the nun one. Overall this game has nice visuals and a decent plot with reasonable production value, but personally the prostitution killed it for me. If you don’t mind prostituion and don’t mind meh gameplay, you’ll like this a lot more than me. At least the art remains omega cute.\n\n–Valkyria\n\nWheeeew lad. Valkyria. This game is something of a legend in the NTR scene for being in development for so long, and then being released unfinished at Version 0.9 with no word from the developer since. As a result, Valkyria straddles the line between being flat-out one of the best NTR games ever made with an enormous amount of content, and being an incomplete game with truly shitty RPG maker combat. It’s such a maddening game to examine because it’s clearly a labor of immense effort with crazy amount of content/etc, but it just… isn’t finished. You have like hundreds of scenes with complex mechanics to get them all, but the ending’s not there and there’s no payoff to the surprisingly complex story. Everything is building towards greatness, then it just ends out of nowhere. And also the art is pretty amateurish, but true NTR connoisseurs don’t let that bother them. In a way this is the saddest game on this list. With a bit more polish to iron out bugs and an ending (plus some systems to make getting scenes easier), Valkyria would be perhaps the most impressive NTR game ever made. But instead, it’s just a scar on the world, a reminder of how so much potential can be wasted if a developer loses motivation.\n\n–アルテミスパール\n\nArtemis Pearl is by all means an unexciting game to talk about since it largely doesn’t do anything that cool or impressive- it’s just a decent game all around. The art is nice. The animation is nice. The gameplay is nice. The story is nice, though it actually ends on a really epic sequence which brings the game to a satisfying close. Overall it doesn’t do anything particularly amazing but it doesn’t do anything bad either. If you think the girls look hot you’ll have a grand ol’ time and get some nuts off, but the game won’t really stick with you either. It’s a jack of all trades, but a master of none. Except having a cool ending.\n\n–寝取られ幼妻リアナ\n\nAnother game from Acerola, this one much more generic that falls prey to all the pitfalls that Tear so perfectly avoided. It’s one of Acerola’s NTR games so the whole game is based around working around town to accumulate X amounts of money before the 60 day time limit runs out. Each time you work at a place the heroine gets more and more sexually harrassed, resulting in 15 or so different NTR arcs that are scattered all over the place and have no internal interaction – each are totally independent and have no effect on each other. However, what ultimately won me over on Liana is simply the fact that I have a soft spot for QT wives being NTR’d, so uh, yep… Well. Acerola games are nice for their incredible amount of content (hundreds of h-scenes) and clean art, so if you like the core concept there’s a decent chunk of content to enjoy. It’s just nothing incredible. Unlike Tear!\n\n~THE LINE OF NOT LIKING SO MUCH ANYMORE~\n\nLet it be known that the games beyond this point are not necessarily games I actively recommend. They’re games I had some fun with, enjoyed to some degree, but they’re NOT games I would actively recommend to everyone. To me, their flaws might outweigh their strengths, or they might be games I like the art of but nothing else, etc etc. Do not take these as “Approved Kamige” or anything. These are the lower tiers and the games only get worse from here. I include them only because I’m aware that other people may like them a lot more than me, and most of them are still worth talking about, probably.\n\n~THE LINE OF NOT LIKING SO MUCH ANYMORE~\n\nTier 6: Participation Medal\n\n–堕ちモノＲＰＧ\n\nThis is the previous game from the Nako devs which I described all the way back in Tier 1. Similar things apply here – thicc, almost deformed heroines aheagoing hard in a way that may put people off hard. Overall I like this game significantly less than than Nako since the plot is worse, the gameplay is more generic, and I like the heroines less, but it’s still a decent game with decent scenes. The heroines are pretty moe in their adoration of the big-dicked MC, and it’s cute watching them fight over him at times, which is some harem antics you surprisingly don’t see in HRPGs too often since so many of them have female protagonists. Anyway, decent ge, not a lot amazing about it but it’s enjoyable.\n\n–ナイトテール\n\nAh, Knight Tale. A rare loli game amid this horde of big tit ge. This developer has two loli game (the other being Fran and the Island of Sinners), both of which become immediate cult classics for the quality of their art. Really, if you’re a lolicon and you like this art, presumably you’ll play the game regardless of anything else said about the game, because it’s just that rare for loli games to have art of this quality (as far as I can tell anyway). With that said, the game itself is alright; the plot is slightly above average but nothing incredible (with it mainly being fun to see how everything shits the bed at the end), and the scenes are nice enough. I’m not particularly passionate about any facet of this game, but it’s well made and has nice art which is good enough for me.\n\n–帝國の関所番\n\nAs one might imagine, the Imperial Gatekeeper is an h-game version of Papers Please, with the scanning of paperwork replaced with groping travelers to search for weapons and the like. Said travelers are randomly generated with a several different “bases” that then have different hair colors, clothes, etc. Incidentally, I know your first thought will be that only women get groped/examined, but in reality there’s both men and women (with an option to remove men from the game if you wish). Anyway, the game gets more advanced as time goes on; in the beginning there’s not much to check for and you can just let people pass in pretty consistently, but as the main quest proceeds there will start being things like a weapon ban, requires you to pat down entrants and hunt for metallic sounds which will tell you where they might be hiding weapons. There’s actually some impressive ludonarrative harmony here with things slowly escalating. The main problem is just that you have a quota of people to pass, and you end up spending a LOT of time doing repetitive actions, which can get boring. That aside, though, Imperial Gatekeeper is a pretty neat game with unique gameplay and a bold artistic vision.\n\n–ラブラブ!マイばでぃ\n\nOkay, the art is not great. I agree, I am not a huge fan of this art, and I imagine most people won’t be either. The game itself is pretty interesting though. It is an attempt to recreate The Elder Scrolls in h-game form, and surprisingly enough it’s about as successful as you can be with an RPG maker game. There’s a pretty expansive open world with dungeon bosses with randomized loot (armor sets with their own visuals), guilds with their own questlines and the like, a ton of party members to recruit, etc etc. It’s actually pretty cool in this respect, but it’s kneecapped by two things: one, the art is pretty bad, so not a single scene in the entire game is erotic (in my opinion). Two, the writing is pretty unremarkable as well, so even though there’s all these quests they’re not actually that like… cool or anything. Still, there’s a truly impressive amount of content, and there’s a ton of dungeons/quests/stuff to do, etc, so it’s hard to dunk on this game. It’s just really regrettable that the art is so unfappable. Incidentally, the cross version of the game is definitely the way to go – it just objectively has more content/etc. I don’t know why the old version is still for sale but it has a better preview image so I used it instead. Feels good man.\n\n–アイランドサーガ\n\nIsland SAGA is inspired by the SaGa series at the name implies, so the base gameplay has a lot of allusions to SaGa including the classic “unbeatable enemies early on” stuff. Outside of that, the game is an interesting mix of high production values (as the developer is known for) and largely vanilla semi-animated h-scenes. The story to the game is pretty much non-existent (just a basic harem romp), but I appreciate the attempt at making like a fully fledged RPG with voice acting and such nonetheless. I’m not particularly head over heels for this game, but it was amusing to play through and see all the SaGa references.\n\n–マーリィズナイト\n\nThe elf protagonist of this game is absolutely adorable and I love her. She’s so demure and kind, I fell for her at first sight. My opinion on this game is not particularly advanced. The protagonist is top kawaii, that’s all I got. But really. Peach Cat games are pretty fun because he always draws the dudes with really smug expressions, which is even funnier when he adds options to blur out their faces and whatnot, it’s not something you see with many other devs. The theme of this game is hiring these dudes as bodyguards on your journey, and them sexually harrassing the elf QT along the way. I honestly don’t have much to say about the porn itself because I don’t find the art especially nutworthy. I just like the main heroine a lot, and I do think it’s neat how for example the body guard getting knocked out in battle leads to h-scenes, that’s kind of thing.\n\n–騎士姫クラリス\n\nPrincess Knight Claris has one of the most genius concepts for an HRPG I’ve ever played. Instead of playing as a girl and walking her into lewd situations, you play as a ghost POSSESSING a girl and forcing her into lewd situations. It’s essentially the same thing – we as players are “controlling” the protagonists maliciously in a lot of these games – but worked into the plot. It’s really clever and shows the developer’s insight into how HRPGs function, with the players working against the protagonist instead of with them. You can craft potions that do damage to make her lost in battle, you can go to cursed areas on the world map that drain her power, fight Succubi that boost her lewd points, etc. There’s also a lot of content and quite a few scenes, though surprisingly I don’t find the game all that fappable – it gets kind of hardcore with body writing, and there’s some repetitive CG re-use, so while this is definitely a good game it doesn’t end up as one of my all-time favorites.\n\n–アイス～魔龍クエスト～\n\nIce Quest is the previous game from Sera and Noelle’s dev. It inherits much of that game’s problems, having unsatisfying corruption and feeling like it could use just a bit more ending stuff. However, it has virtues of its own in the form of some hilarious minigames. In a lot of rpg maker games, the quests amount to nothing more than killing off some goblins in a dungeon or something, but in Ice Quest you might have to do sokoban, or play like a shmup minigame to avoid getting drunk, etc etc. It’s a charming little game with a surprising amount of content. It just, again, doesn’t quite stick the landing for me. In general I think this dev’s greatest problem is characterizing the heroines properly.\n\n–NTR騎士物語\n\nNTR Knight! This game is hilarious. It’s like such an extreme version of NTR it’s impossible to take seriously, but at the same time it goes so far with it that you can’t help but laugh – just look at that title image! The plot is pretty KINO with twists and turns, it’s pretty common for an HRPG to have an unremarkable plot outside of one incredibly late-game scene and NTR Knight basically falls into this – the final boss is the stuff dreams are made of. That said, sadly I can’t give this game the glowing recommendation I would like to. The gameplay is unbelievably bad, and there’s a pretty low amount of scenes overall so there’s not much to chew on. It’s a very short game that’s full of sound and explosion, but isn’t actually that impressive by itself.\n\n–獣耳乙女は裏切らない\n\nNow this is a sad one. Avantgarde made the big-tit Elf Wife hypnosis game from way back, and this was the game they released after it. Sadly they had such big hopes for it that everything came crumbling down. Instead of focusing on the porn and building the game around it, they basically tacked porn onto a tryhard RPG with disastrous results. The plot’s boring, the h-scenes are scattered about with little coherency, and you have to grind h-stats to access them at times which is the pinnacle of boring. However, the art is incredibly good. The production value in general is far superior to most HRPGs and everything in the game looks great, especially the sprites of the heroines. It’s one of the most disappointing games on this list just because like… it’s so high effort, but all the effort was put in the wrong places, so it ends up just bad. Oh well. At least the art is still good and thus fappable.\n\nTier 7: The Sinking Barrel\n\n–直進迷宮\n\nAnother game from the dev of 聖剣の勇者のヤリまくり英雄譚. This one’s a lot more constrained in scope, instead of being an RPG it’s a linear series of puzzles (with the option to just remove the puzzles to see 1 h-scene after another in quick sequence). The decreased amount of stuff going on leads to this being a much more forgetabble game, you might as well just look up a CG gallery, really. The puzzles are kind of fun but they’re so delineated from the rest of the game that it feels kind of pointless, you would be better off just going out and playing an actual puzzle game.\n\n–レイラのエクスタシティ冒険記\n\nThe third game from fukidamari on this list! I like his art, okay? And with that said, I REALLY don’t have much to say about this game. It’s basically the same as his other two games: decent but forgettable plot, meh scenes carried by the art, etc. There’s really not much more to his games than that. I will say, though, I like red haired heroines and so this game is satisfying in a different way from the other two. You have to like explore this corrupted city and beat the corrupted bosses. It’s… nice? Uuuh… I really should have not put three games from the same dev on here.\n\n–アイドル魔法剣士フィーリア\n\nThis is the previous game from the dev of Dorei Riyuu, which is WAAAY up in Tier 1. What the FUCK happened? Well, put simply, all the stuff that makes Dorei Riyuu good is largely gone in this game – there’s not as many minigames, there’s less content, no cute imouto with her own scenes, etc etc. It’s just a worse game in most respects. However, it’s not an irredeemable game or anything. The main heroine is still cute, and there’s still fun moments – my favorite is when you have to go exterminate some goblins, but they turned the entire mountain hideout into a giant board game which plays out in a pretty funny way. She gets so desperate to win the board game, but the challenges are so great. The author has a good sense for these kinds of games and the protagonist really is a top cutie who responds to lewd situations in enjoyable ways. It’s just a shame that so much of the game is just inferior to his latest work (even in screen resolution!).\n\n–Succubus x Saint\n\nOkaaay. Succubus x Saint is a really hard game to talk about because the game is so all over the place. First of all, the art is great, let’s just get that out of the way. The saint in question is a real hottie and the game is enjoyable to play if only to look at her. The gameplay itself is a bizarre mix of dungeon spelunking and trap dodging, or rather, walking intentionally into traps to get H-scenes. The scenes themselves are similar to Vampire Notes in how there’s a bunch of piecemeal CGs which are reused as the different scenes call for it; personally I’m not a big fan of this and it was fairly disappointing in this game since a lot of things end up feeling samey. Still, it’s a fast game to blast through and the heroine is cute. As a sad addendum, the developer was planning a big content update, but halfway through it he decided that nobody would like it so he dropped the content update and actually quit gamedev in general. Feels bad man?\n\n–軋轢のイデオローグ\n\nSigh. Ideologue is perhaps close to the best selling HRPG of all time, boasting an absolutely insane amount of content, a ton of focus on the story (including a decent number of plot CGs), two main heroines to control, smooth gameplay, animations for some h-scenes and moves, etc. It’s as close to a “Real JRPG” as many HRPGs get, because the developers are intentionally trying to “push the envelope” as it were and make their games legitimate with voice acting and all that stuff. There’s even an append for even MORE content. Sadly, I think Ideologue is kneecaped by perhaps the most tragic thing of all: a lack of talent. The writing is dull and the setting of the game is stolen from more famous properties, namely Attack on Titan. It’s hard for me at least to actually enjoy the game. The h-content, too, is so non-linear and disconnected that it’s pretty unfappable for me. As an example, if the protagonist loses to a bandit in the first mission and loses her virginity, you can immediately go around town and start prostituting her; the only flag stopping it is the virginity flag. So you can go from pure girl punching dudes in the face for flipping a skirt to an actual prostitute with zero buildup. Which reflects how the H-content in oneone1 games are handled in general – no buildup, they just happen and they don’t matter. A shame since the art is pretty good. I think some people will LOVE Ideologue and consider it one of the best HRPGs of all time, but your appreciation for the writing (and whether you’ve read Attack on Titian or not lmao) will play a big role in this.\n\n–サナ\n\nSana is something of a meme, but it’s the kind of meme I can enjoy. As you can tell immediately, the main heroine of this game is grotesquely deformed, as is the trend for games from this developer. It must be painful for her to exist with such a fleshy, deformed body, and as she walks her in-game sprite has ginormous tits that sway side to side, jerking back and forth in a way that must be extremely painful. But it’s this absurdity of character design that makes the… NTR…? so enjoyable. I don’t even really fap to the H in this game, I just observe the insane anatomy and laugh. You have to be pretty high level to fap this game, but just beholding the absurdity of the NTR and art is fun all in itself. For example, if you bring NTRman with you to explore a dungeon, here’s one of the scenes that can happen: https://i.imgur.com/Ypzjget.jpg . Just incredible.\n\n–レナリスサーガ\n\nLenaris Saga is a game I feel very conflicted about. On the one hand, the developer put a lot of time and care into it. The scale and scope of this game is very impressive, the art is really nice, and the plot is even pretty solid. There’s a lot to like in this game, and to be honest, there’s a good chance thatr if YOU play this game you might think it’s a Tier 2 or Tier 3 game, even. But personally, there’s two critical flaws for me. One, thre’s a moment early in the plot that’s SO stupid it just took me out of the experience entirely. It’s kind of a ridiculous thing to be so butthurt about, but it’s just so… so bad it poisoned my perspective of the game’s writing quality entirely. Two, it’s a prostitution themed game, which I have mentioned not liking. So my faith in the story took a hit, then I was faced with a bunch of prostitution porn, which soured me on the game overall. However, the rest of the game is pretty cool, with as I said a ton of content and an above-average plot and stuff in many ways. It’s like a kamige that jut rubbed me the wrong way, so much so I ended up not liking it much. But not everyone will feel the same, surely. This is another game I’ve seen some people really love and consider one of the most epic HRPGs they’ve played before, so it can really hit some people in the right places.\n\n–若妻スフレ\n\nYoung Wife Souffle is an old classic of the “play as a wife and get NTR’d” genre. It was so successful I think the dev just quit game making to roll in the cash or something, lol. But anyway, it’s a pretty bland but enjoyable game. The blue-haired wife is pretty cute and the NTR hits the sweet spot between being serious and being lighthearted where it’s satisfying without requiring too much emotional investment. The part of this game I remember most are the heart eyes, which are used well. Other than that not much to say, it’s just an alright NTR game.\n\n–DESIRE EATER<デザイアイーター>\n\nDesire Eater is an interesting game because while it’s a “play as a girl and get involved in lewdnewss” type thing, it does something pretty rare for them – instead of just getting more lewd over time, the heroine gets more attractive over time as well. You unlock new hair styles, dresses, etc and she does get noticeably prettier which is nice. The scenes are more funny than hot for me, there’s one where the guy masturbates over the tip of a sword to get the “suspension bridge effect” (lol). It’s a short game that’s pretty meme with a plot that doesn’t exist until it explodes dramatically at the very end in honestly a pretty dumb way. Uuuh… Well, yeah. This game is good purely for the idea of the protagonist getting prettier over time, with h-scenes being locked off not by lewd points but by cuteness levels, which is something I wouldn’t mind seeing more of. The production values are also nice and it looks good overall.\n\n–ServantValkyrie〈サーバントヴァルキリー〉\n\nNow this is an interesting game. It’s hyper-focused on a single character in a single point of time – a female general POW in an enemy brothel that doubles as a jail. This game actually goes surprisingly far with it, with a day system, complex interlocking of stats, stealthy plots you can suss up if you talk to the right people at the right time, etc. It’s actually kind of cool how far the setting is taken and how elaborate the brothel ends up being as a location. The only reason the game is so low is I find the art kinda janky and the scenes unfappable. It’s the kinda game that’s so serious and weighty that the main heroine getting lewd just makes me feel more uncomfortable than anything. But anyway, there’s over 15 endings, and overall this is a really complicated hrpg that has way more depth than it first seems.\n\nTier 8: Just Not My Thing\n\n–錬精術士コレットのHな搾精物語\n\nColette is the third game from Acerola on this list, and the first which is not from the “B-Team”, or the NTR team as it is sometimes called. Acerola has two styles of games: one style has a linear focus and generally a time limit or some kind of debt to repay that ends up with the heroine getting NTR’d by her employers (NTR-Team), the other is much more open world-esque with elaborate combat H, semen collection, and in general 3x as many scenes (A-Team). The difference between A-Team and NTR-Team games are pretty vast, with the A-Team games consistently selling twice as much. Collete is one of these, being so popular that it in fact is one of the best selling HRPGs of all time. However, the A-Team games are not really my thing. Their open nature leads to scenes being even MORE incoherent than usual, and the semen collection gimmick usually leads to the protagonist going out and asking for semen day-one, which is pretty much a boner killer for me. However, the amount of content is really impressive, and there’s so much to do that if you aren’t too concerned with like corruption arcs or anything there can be a lot to like. Most impressive of all is that there’s a “flat” or “big boob” option at the start that lets you select the tit size of the protagonist, which is reflected in all scenes. Flat Colette is pretty kawaii and definitely waifu material.\n\n–キリエの異界漂流記\n\nThere’s something about the games from this dev that make me feel something no other HRPG developer does. On the one hand, the writing feels above average, with characters being immediately distinct and at times funny. The worldbuilding has some care, and all in all it feels like a lot of effort is put into the stories of these games. But at the same time, holy shit, I just find them ridiculously unfappable. I really don’t get it. The presentation of the scenes feels wrong somehow, I can never really empathize with the characters or feel eroticism from what’s going on, etc. All I can say is that the games are just aren’t my thing despite their quality in other departments.\n\n–We Are Bandits\n\nIt truly pains me to have We Are Bandits so low on this list. It’s a classic and I feel like even some people not into HRPGs otherwise have played this game before. And for good reason! The premise is pretty top-tier, and while it may not be immediately apparent it’s actually a parody of Fire Emblem in may ways, with the enemies being based on classic FE designs etc. There’s some nice humor, swift progression of plot, etc etc. The problem for me is just the simple fact that captured enemies are turned to the side of the bandits through hypnosis. Well, it’s not a disaster or anything, but it really killed the appeal for me – I would have preferred the bandit squad to have duked it out alone, or maybe to have bribed the enemy to their side with wit and guile, but hypnotizing the enemy forms a lazy middle ground (imo) that has neither the appeal of playing as a group of bandits, nor of conquering the foe and turning them to your side. This is not a bad game by any means, but ultimately this core plot decision made it hard for me to enjoy it.\n\n–素晴らしき国家の築き方\n\nThis is a Big Budget High Effort game that had an animated hentai adaptation planned before even being released. It’s impressive in scale with its huge cast of characters, voice acting, etc etc. The gameplay is an interesting real-time action kind of thing as well, which is backed by a frankly enormous list of skills and upgrades to accumulate while constructing your empire. This is definitely the kind of game where you can get addicted and then just pour like 50 hours without even thinking into base building. However, what killed it for me personally is the focus on prostitution. There’s really no reason for the heroines to prostitute themselves, but it’s the developer’s fetish so all the heroines that join your party just jump to prostitution themselves with no fanfare or attention given to this in the plot. Furthermore, the writing is kind of bad. The setup is so nonsensical it had me gnashing my teeth (the kingdom starts off with LITERALLY 4 people. in the whole kingdom. 4. four. whole kingdom. 4.) and it suffers from Kizuna Events, which shoves a lot of characterization/romance into side content that has no reflection in the main plot. I can’t call this a bad game, but a lot of it just didn’t appeal to me.\n\n–あまえんぼ\n\nThis is a cute game based on pixel art animations for H-scenes, centered around a shota visiting his hot cousins and hot aunt for the summer. It’s actually impressive in a way, with the pixel animations actually being high quality and pretty appealing to see. The core of the game is a comfy summer vacation with regular events like going on a BBQ with the family, wherein shota takes his relationship to the next level with whoever he has the most love points with. The gameplay is a bit interesting with you doing various chores and other things around the house to boost points with the girls, and the escalation from secretly having sex with one cousin to just casually banging the mom in the living room while the cousins are trying to watch TV is pretty based. The problem with the game for me was just that I really don’t like schedule-based games. It’s super hard to see 100% of the content and I kept feeling like I was missing core side content – someone who likes replaying entire games might be more fine with this. Also, naturally, it’s vanilla, so…\n\n–TouringWithWAIFU\n\nWhat a weird game. I can’t even describe how maddening the design of this game is; more than anything I’ve played it feels like the cobbled together delusions of a schizophrenic. There’s so many game windows, text boxes to move around, insane gameplay, etc. I don’t even know where to begin – the tutorial is so filled with text I felt like beating my head against my desk by the end of it. The h-scenes can happen at the drop of a hat and are like just there. Man. This game is impossible to describe, really, but at its core you can replay dungeons repetitively. They’re straight lines with random items and events. If some things happen you unlock new waifus and items. In some ways the core gameplay loop can be potentially addicting. But personally, the game really lost me with the maddening tutorial and insane presentation in general.\n\n–Orika\n\nA rare 3D game, or rather, a 2d game that takes its sprites from screenshots of 3D models. Orika is a surprisingly cool game with an absolute truckload of content (no doubt assisted by the fact scenes are just positioning the 3D models rather than drawing new scenes) and a somewhat elaborate gameplay system based around a single-person party moving multiple times. It’s a standard “Female Adventurer Gets Lewded Up If She Loses in Battle” type game, with the theme being that each dungeon has a unique sequence if Orika gets captured, with sexual training progressing and getting more intense until eventually she caves in. She can run away, but things get worse if she’s caught or capstured again. The Female Adventurers of this world are just used to this, and one of the tests to getting into the Adventurer’s Guild as a girl is to be pretty enough to use your body to escape trouble. This gives the game a light-hearted tone and overall it’s a fun time, but the 3D is actually kind of unfappable for me. I would like this game about x10 as much if it had 2D art assets. And also, had better writing, because it’s fairly bland.\n\n–エルフにもできる売春計画\n\nThis game is an absolute trip. Despite the concept being an elf prostituting herself in increasingly extreme ways, the writer for this game is extraordinarily competent, such that the writing has a full suite of goodness – there’s nice world building, the humor is actually hilarious, the characters are well-characterized, etc etc. It’s actually amazing to me how funny this game can be, some lines actually had me rolling on the floor metaphorically. This is definitely a game where you can feel the developer worked hard to make every aspect of the game as good as possible. However, well, you can probably guess by now, but prostitution porn is not really my thing. The bulk of this game is increasingly intense prostitution, so despite loving the humor/writing I really just… didn’t end up liking the game itself that much. Still, it has some hilarious moments and I don’t regret playing it per se. It’s a game I can respect but not fully enjoy as an HRPG.\n\n–セックス&ヴァーデンリッテ\n\nA rare HRPG where the protagonist is a futa lesbian who goes around plugging the holes of girls she finds cute. There’s some funny humor based around this, but the biggest thing to know about this game is that it tries really hard to be a “life simulator” of sorts. There’s a fairly expansive open world, you can buy a house, there’s all sorts of guilds, economics, crafting, etc etc. When it came out it was all the rage on Futaba as people explored its depth. You can kind of go in any direction you want from the start to hunt for QT heroines to add to your harem, and of course I immediately went East to the elf kingdom. It’s not hard to have some fun with this game and be impressed with what it does. However, for me, there was one critical flaw: randomized roguelike dungeons. The “meat” of the game, if you will, is essentially junk. There’s basically nothing less fun than RNG roguelike dungeons, so the core experience was pretty dragged down for me. However, it still has a lot of virtues, and now there’s a sequel out which may be better! I still have to play that. It markets itself as 100 hour long RPG and I believe it – there’s a lot of content here. Also, yes, this is technically yuri.\n\n–レリィ・ナビゲーション!～少女路地裏紀行～\n\nLelie Navigation is a cute game. The bright-spirited protagonist goes on an adventure with some colorful characters. She’s super genki and there’s all sorts of fun systems throughout the game, like… uh… her nipples getting darker the more sex she has? Look, bro, it’s an HRPG list, the games are lewd. Anyway, the production values on display in this game are pretty crazy and it’s quite the fleshed out game, but for me, well, I actually couldn’t quite get into driving such a genki and kawaii girl like the MC getting into lewd situations. The protagonist is basically the anti-me in terms of arousal, and I couldn’t even pop a chubby all games. This is one game I respect as a game, especially with all the effort put into it, but as an h-game, not quite.\n\nTier 9: Heart of Gold, but Wasted Potential\n\n–魔剣物語\n\nI love this main heroine design. I would marry her IRL the second I saw her. She’s maximum kawaii. But well, you see what this tier is called. This game is wasted potential because the main heroine is silent and doesn’t say anything except some brief moans in the h-scenes. This alone pretty much thrashes her character; the only time she says anything mid-game is when you have a dialogue with the ever-hilarious “serious option” and “meme option”. On top of that, all the porn is Game Over stuff that you get for losing battles which then takes you back to your last save point, so none of it sticks. Honestly, I’m gonna be real with you, the rest of the game isn’t even bad. It has a decent enough plot and RPG maker gameplay that, while unimpressive, manages to be moderately engaging. But the sting of the poorly implemented porn and the silent protagonist kills the whole game for me.\n\n–ASYLUM / アサイラム\n\nAsylum is a game from a dev I generally like, the maker of the Sequel series. The main heroine is omega hot and I was primed to love this game. But sadly, I just really didn’t like it at all. It’s yet another game that apes Dark Souls design principles, which means I’ve played approximately 100 games like it before, except this one doesn’t manage to have great tilesetting or neat lore like Heart of Darkness. It’s all just very surface level, and due to aping Dark Souls your party members consist of silent doll members, which is a HUGE blow for me since I really like party dynamics in JRPGs and having no party just adds salt to the wound. Asylum isn’t a bad game, and the porn remains top-tier thanks to the great art, but everything else about it is just disappointing and stale to me. I think someone who has played less Dark Souls HRPG clones, or alternatively someone who likes the design style more than me, will rate this game a lot higher.\n\n–人妻寝取りRPG The New World Order\n\nThis is a game that tried so hard to be great, and tried so hard to appeal to my tastes (it’s friggin called the Married Woman Netori RPG!!!!), but failed spectacularly nonetheless. It honestly has some good scenes and the setup is cool – the developer fleshed out a fairly elaborate world with a large cast of characters engaging in a reasonably real-deal plot. Like I said, it tried so HARD to be great. But then it fails in two key ways. One, it’s impossibly obnoxious to play. There’s missable content out the ass, and at multiple points the game actively works to trick you into permanently losing party members (just to make replaying the game more worthwhile I guess). If you want to get most of the content in this game you have to keep your nose pressed in a guide. Two, the art just narrowly reaches the point where it’s pretty unfappable even for someone ready to go to pretty dank depths for married woman porn. If the game got a remake that made it more smooth to play (without so much missable content!) and better art, it could possibly end up as one of my favorite games ever. Alas, as it stands, I think it’s so caught up in outdated design principles (having been released in 2012) that it’s nothing more than a monument to what could have been.\n\n–魔王のハーレムは冒険者町にて\n\nThis is the third game from Nako’s developer, and as you can guess from its location it’s by far my least favorite. The problem is quite simply – the gameplay SUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCKS. It’s an extremely repetitive, dull, time-wasting simulating thing where you just spam clicking until you get the next scene. There’s nothing fun about it. The h-scenes themselves fare better, though despite the immense linearity I don’t think the characters actually ended up having good arcs or anything. The sex just kind of happens and it’s like, okay. Thankfully the art is still top-tier so it’s more than fappable, it just feels like a waste since it’s attached to such a truly terrible game. Oh well. The dev ended up updating the gameplay after all the criticism, I believe, so maybe I’ll like it more on a replay – it’s pretty rare for a dev to do a full gameplay update like this so I feel conflicted about whether I should completely abandon my immense disappointment from playing Day 1 and pretend the new style is how the game has always been, but well, in this list at least I will dunk on it for the old gameplay.\n\n–スカーレットプリンセス\n\nThis game has the worst tiling I have ever seen in my life. It looks like a shitty Atari 2600 game with porn plastered on top. It’s bad to the point of being distracting, like holy shit, but anyway… This game is one of those HRPGs that put a priority on having all of the H-scenes be animated. The animation in this game is surprisingly good and it’s why it’s on this list at all; I quite like the motion and the main heroine is pretty hot in general. However, the potential here is wasted in a few ways. The execution is as shitty as the tiling, you just go from town to town while finishing all the H-events around before moving. It’s a bit dull. Second, the writing is super basic and could really stand to level up like once or twice. More effort put into fleshing out events and characters would make a HUGE difference. This game is like a gem in the rough, if it just had 50% more effort and quality put into it, it could be a top-tier game with based animations. Instead it’s just kinda hot but also kinda bad.\n\n–機核覚醒～機工姫ルース～\n\nWowee! This is the first game in the 機核覚醒 series, with the other 機核覚醒 way up in Tier 2 being the second game. Sure is a drop in quality, huh? Well, here’s my reasoning. While Yuka is megaman styled with a ton of characters and moves unlocking all the time, Rusu is more of a traditional metroidvania without that many options that open up. This results in the game relying much more on the quality of the platforming, which is really not a strength of the series. However, it still has charm and is one of the better h-platormers I’ve played, not to mention being required LORE for the second game, so it’s not irredeemable. The “Wasted potential” here is capitalized on in the sequel, which is more than I can say for some games here. Not to mention that some people definitely like this more than me – I know one guy who considers this one of his favorite platformers of all time, too. Different gameplay styles really appeal to different people more.\n\n–ぼくの寝取られやすいスーパーヒロイン\n\nThis entry can be considered in a stand-in for all of this developer’s games. There’s a whole echelon of HRPG devs that pump out extremely low-effort content with poor art and not much content, or alternatively, super short H-scenes to pad out the content list. I’ve tried many of these games but the writing is always fairly poor with rapid-fire corruption and barely any meaningful corruption. However… However! The core Eros is still there. In this game, for instance, the core appeal of the Super Heroine being NTR’d is still there. It’s still nut. Each time one of these games comes out, so many people are no doubt drawn in by the concept and title, only to have one dissatisfied nut. These aren’t the worst games ever made, but it’s always so frustrating to play them. If only the developer shifted mindset into trying to make really good games and flesh things out, maybe they would be better. Maybe it’s presumptious to say they’re intentionally pumping out cheap games. Either way, there’s a whole echelon of games that ape greatness without ever reaching it themselves.\n\n–勇者姫ミリア\n\nThis is the latest game from Princess Knight Claris’s dev, as described back in Tier 6. The art has taken a huge leap and in my opinion the protagonist is much hotter, being a big-titted mesugaki that really begs to be punished. However, her game has a critical flaw – it’s a clone of Princess Knight Claris! Almost the entire game is 1:1 with Claris, to the point of feeling like a remake instead of a new game. So many concepts, areas, etc etc are copied 1:1 with little to no change. This is a shame because I really did like the concept of the first game, so I looked forward to seeing how it was executed here, but the answer is just… the dev taking the easiest way out. If you haven’t played Claris I would recommend this game first, if only because the heroine is hotter, but oof. So much potential, wasted. Also, note that both the loli and the adult in the above preview image are the same person. The big gimmick here is that you can swap the heroine between adult and loli form at will upon obtaining a certain cursed item. It’s the biggest change from the original game and is pretty neat.\n\n–冒険者の宿へようこそ\n\nThe idea behind this game is pretty great. Female adventurers stay at your inn, you bang them and corrupt them to work for you while you boost the quality of your inn to attract more powerful customers. The end goal is to get a harem of 10 powerful adventurers serving as maids in your inn. It’s an attractive conept where jsut stating the idea is enough to make some people eager to play it, I think. However, the execution is fairly poor. The quests are autoplay, so there’s no gameplay outside the inn building, which is very simple. Those looking for some shallow fun and a basic execution of the concept will be satisfied, but it could have been taken so much further and been so much better.\n\nTier ?: Random Stuff\n\nNote that these games aren’t necessarily the worst games on this list, it’s mostly just random stuff I struggled to place elsewhere.\n\n–鉄壁！女戦士\n\nNow this is one hell of a meme game. For those familiar with VIPRPGs this is the closest any HRPG I’ve played has come to basically being a VIRPPG, and it’s one hell of a ride. 8 story chapters building into a 2 hour long tale of insanity where the invincible Victoria beats the shit out of anyone who comes near the kingdom that hired her for protection. Between each chapter you can train different stats 5 times and wander the city for dialogue, with the training being done instantly so there’s basically no down time if you don’t want there to be. There’s 35 plot CGs and each one is an absolute treasure; I can’t even describe how funny and insane the CGs can get. The actual porn of this game is pretty unfappable, but if you ignore it entirely and treat this as a meme game to laugh with for 2 hours, it’s pretty solid.\n\n–びたみんクエスト\n\nAh, the classic! Surely many of us have played Vitamin Quest as one of our first HRPGs way back when. A classic that remains a classic, a female protagonist game where the sex is willing instead of unwilling, which is truly novel. Nice art from a pro, funny writing, iconic protagonist, what more is there to say…? For me, nothing. Because I haven’t replayed it and this is all I remember. I have played the demo to the sequel though and it’s looking really good. Can’t wait to play that.\n\n–ぶるーすきんの森\n\nThis is an H-platformer with something of an underground cult following, it had threads on a certain chan site that went on for months and months as people explored the game and played updates. It’s a metroidvania of sorts where you’re plopped into this forest and given free reign to wander around, fighting monsters and collecting an enormous amount of pixel art h-scenes. It’s a pretty impressive game scale-wise since the developer has been adding onto it so much, and exploring the world can be pretty cool since there’s a lot of areas which require special powers to get to. The pixel art is also super cute in my opinion. Did I mention that this is a monster girl game? Also, the image I used up above is for a different game from the same dev. What can I say, I couldn’t find a good image for the forest one. Maybe play Succubus Affection instead?\n\n–おとぎばなしの鬼ごっこ\n\nFairy Tail Tag is a, uh, unique game. It’s a game where you go into the world of story books and play as the villain characters, navigating puzzle-like environments to catch up to the heroine and “tag” them, i.e. engage in sexual relations with them. The first one is Red Riding Hood and as the wolf you have to strategically block red riding hood’s path to catch up to her. It’s a unique game if nothing else, and the art is pretty high quality. The dev’s last game is a pretty elaborate dungeon crawler with DLC adding even more shit to do, but I haven’t played the DLC. Overall this is a dev that has nice art and gameplay, though the writing doesn’t necessarily keep up.\n\n–Princess Go Round\n\nMilk Force is an h-artist that really sticks out in my mind for how much humor and color he inserts into his art. He never takes things too seriously, so there’s always a fun vibe to his stuff, and Princess Go Round fits that bill. There’s a lot of hilarious CGs in this game while still managing to be pretty hot at times. Well, that’s all I have to say, really… I’d like to post some of the meme HCGs but that would kind of spoil the fun, so all I can do is shrug and say, yeah, it’s a reasonably fun time.\n\n–出し抜け! NNナンパビーチ\n\nThis game is great purely for the memes. Another game by the dev of Sana, and all the same thing applies here – you have to be surpremely high level to actually fap to the art, but if you treat it as kind of a joke it can be hilarious. The best part of this game is how you can leave the beach and go into town to flirt with faceless mob characters in RPG maker battles. Successfully getting into their pants boosts your stats for flirting with the main heroines. At the same time, your two beach buddies are also going after the heroines, so there can be some NTR-flavored scenes as well – you have to actually stumble upon the two doing the deed though, which is a dimension most games dont have. Overall this is one game that sticks in my memory just for how meme it is.\n\n–勇者の寝取られの冒険\n\nThis is NTR in its most extreme form. The most disgusting of men corrupting the hero’s two childhood friends in the most intense way possible. Honestly this game could go all the way up to Tier 3 in terms of eroticism for me, but I remembered it so late it ended up in this random section. Anyway, this game is pretty hilarious for the sheer intensity of the NTR. The NTR-man is a pretty disgusting-looking wizard who attempts to kill the hero MC, but can’t, so instead he puts on curse on hero MC that weakens him dramatically. The party is thus forced to rely on the disgusting wizard despite his terrible ways. The H in this game can get pretty hardcore, with boobs being stretched so far they deform in scenes, or they fuck in a tub and NTR man cums so much the entire bathtub fills with semen which they bathe in, etc. It’s hilarious and at times pretty nut. The gameplay itself is pretty agonizing though (super dull RPG maker stuff), and it’s basically a visual novel in how you just advance linearly forward while seeing scenes at a set time. Still, if you like NTR, this game is pretty top tier. They fall hard and the ending scenes are 10/10.\n\n–淫魔みならい(♂)はじめました。\n\nSuccubus Apprentice is a pretty interesting game in how the core design plays out – rather than doing RPG maker battles or something of the like to accumulate sce"
