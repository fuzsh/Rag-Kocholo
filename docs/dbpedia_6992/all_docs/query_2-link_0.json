        "text": "See also recommendations in those two threads (some of the already mentioned ones, many new ones):\n\nhttps://f95zone.to/threads/femdom-games-comics-suggestion.4483/\n\nhttps://f95zone.to/threads/femdom-games-with-no-transformation.21548/\n\nAgain, my personal favorite: \"Ladykiller in a bind\", which was an instant buy for me and I hope the sequel announced at the end will really happen in the future. It's just one particular path spread over 6 long sessions, but boy is it good. Compared to the majority of content listed, this is a rare, much more realistic depiction of a femdom relationship, based on trust, love and playing with emotions (but still quite intense). And she is lovely. You can tell it's written by a very talented woman. [You might have heard of her earlier (non-sexual) work 'Analogue: A Hate Story' and the sequel 'Hate Plus' (heavily text-based exploratory VNs, though). In case you were following early Humble Bundles, you might even have those in your steam library.]\n\nI think I can list some more which were not mentioned so far:\n\nCure my addiction - High quality game so far and has some femdom scenes quite a bit into the game (mainly with the captain I believe?)\n\nBondage college - lesbian only, game is basically about dominating or getting dominated with lots of bondage, lots of different outcomes and additional scenes locked behind stats grind - cheating recommended after some replays to stay sane (lunch break has a lot of different scenes and a whole club with many scenes)\n\nGirl beats hero - not to my liking, but if you like what the title suggests in a literal way, here you go\n\nCalibration error - not to my liking - a transformation game with some short femdom paths\n\nElf Jail - if you liked the femdom relationship in Lust Doll, here is a currently rather short but complete (?) puzzle adventure game from the same author which is about breaking out (and rescuing a fellow elf) of a jail lead by a sadistic dominatrix who loves to bully elfs all day long\n\nNight Games - a game, where the gameplay is sex battle royale every night - it's basically dominate or get dominated (lots and lots of different skills and various skill tress) - well written and also contains a whole masochismn skill tree(?) and a few related femdom events (not counting the getting defeated sex scenes), but large parts of the content are locked behind the huge grind that is the nightly battles (on the flip side, due to that this game is huge and the battles can be very interesting!!). Worth trying out, the author is a nice and good one.\n\nI don't know why people think that Starless game has anything femdom in it. I endured that stupid interview section staring at the protagonist cock shooting cum over a girl then being serviced orally by the Mistress. I am really into femdom and I can categorically say, it has 0% femdom in it - at least for an hour into the game...and even if it has any later, having to endure any more pov parts of a dick spurting cum all over the place does not worth the wait. I got completely turned off by this game.\n\nI don't know why people think that Starless game has anything femdom in it.

I got completely turned off by this game.\n\nI agree insofar as I stopped playing it after a couple of game days. The focuses of that game aren't a big turn on for me for the most part, even if there are some parts I like. For a similar scenario but done right, try Estate: Dominate - its creator was inspired by Starless but didn't include the Japanese-style \"femdom\" elements you're objecting to.\n\nThanks for your reply fanboi, I agree. I liked the only femdom scene so far with the dominant daughter and her dress-up and pee-drinking. Other than that I saw too many spurting cocks and the text is just endless I could barely click fast enough to get through all of that. After the new servant girl arrived, I gave up - I realized it will be a harem composed of 1 dominant female and probably 5 closet submissive ones. It simply does not worth to see all that disguised cock worship in exchange for 1 femdom scene. So, its not \"japanse femdom\" I hate, I really like some of that content, its a shame that the game is not made so that you can choose the femdom route or the spurting cocks route. I am rambling sorry, but its so unnerving that even \"femdom\" games are centered around cocks, it just shows how male-centered people are on average.\n\nAbout Estate: Dominate, I played that one as well, its sooo much better it does not even compare. Its a proper femdom game, a rare thing, and its artistic level is out of this world, it even moved me a little. Too bad it was kinda short.\n\nPS: I wonder if Euphoria in the list above has any femdom, seeing how the few snapshots featured show the exact opposite?"
