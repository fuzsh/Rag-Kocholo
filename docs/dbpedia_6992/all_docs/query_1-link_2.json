Help improve our database by adding an opening theme here.\n\nEdit\n\nEnding Theme\n\n\"Onii-chan Daisuki!\" by Ruri Yakushi\n\nReviews\n\nRate an 8\n\nEnglish Subtitled\n\nCensored\n\nWarning:(potential nausea inducing) has a somewhat v.r. outlook to it. For those not familiar with that technology imagine a person who had a few alcoholic beverages or ridding on boat with bumpy waves.\n\nStory\n\nPlot idea wasn't original but there was a lot of bang for your buck. As for the conclusion it was a nice touch again on a lot of content but mainly the comical spin.\n\nArt\n\n-Idea of a floral pattern for scope/background was a moderate idea on a scale of good and bad. While it boosted the romance aspect there were flaws. One being ruined view of naughty action/blocked sight. Another was ... duration, never seemed to fade away when you wanted it to(lasted a long time, may have covered 60 percent or more of the show as a whole. Lastly, it would better be used strictly or for the most part in the dream sequences. Doing so making it clear it is somewhat dreaming, distinguishes reality from dream and boosts some element of charm. Luckily, there was some change to the pattern in episode from flowers to what looked like looking through a screen door. Can't say i have a favorite but at least it changed. Episode 2 for those that are wondering wasn't as affected.\n\n-transitions did quite a few jumps. First we are here and now we are here. Please, slow progression. I beg of you.\n\n-Characters at least looked the part(matched the title's name) moreover than season 2 did.\n\n-A lot more content havens per picture than just a romantic encounter with two people.\n\n-Could have done without the v.r. perspective. I loved the anime but that kind of visual was making me dizzy.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nYounger Sister Paradise, one of the hottest hentai I’ve ever seen.\n\nPLOT\n\nIt’s about a boy living with his younger sisters. And when the parents are away the kids will play. In this case the kids will fck.\n\nThe thing that attracted me to this anime was the name: Imouto Paradise (Little sister Paradise) I knew I was in for a treat. I’m a lolicon, what can I say. And the tittle stays true to its name; this guy is living in a paradise of little sisters.\n\nI loved Imouto Jiru despite being very heavy censored (which sucked), this hentai is also censored but that’s hentai for ... you.\n\nThere isn't much of a story. But I think in this hentai's case a story might ruin it.\n\nCHARACTERS: 1 brother, 5 sisters\n\nANIKI perv brother\n\nRIO blue hair\n\nAYA pink hair\n\nHIYORI & KOHARU blond twins\n\nMICHIKA black haired, smart one\n\nCharacters aren’t developed but they do have personalities.\n\nART\n\nBase on a person’s opinion, the art may be very good or very bad. I think it was very good. The female characters are incredibly cute (especially around the eyes).\n\nAlso they use what I think is called the drunken (or wobbly) camera technique: the camera doesn’t stay still, it doesn’t stay straight. Kind of the way an amateur would film, where he zooms in & out, left & right.\n\nThere are some great Point-Of-View shots. The camera will be placed at a great angle making the scene even hotter (there is P-O-V shot from the penises perspective when the penis is inside one of the girl’s mouth and it cums, it’s very hot)\n\nAlso it’s censored. I’ve seen a lot of hentai and I used to really despise censorship but I got used to it. If you’re not used to it by now then I’m sorry.\n\nYou should expect to see the guy cum a lot especially in episode 2. Expect a lot of fellatio and cum drinking aswell.\n\nAnd of course it ends with all the girls wanting him, a classic hentai ending.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nI might not have seen that much 'works of art' in my time but I can easily say that this is the worst and most disturbing one of them all, and that says a lot when you've seen shows like Boku no Pico and Euphoria. I wouldn't bother with this at all unless you want to stare at a screen and question where everything in life went wrong like I did.\n\nStory:\n\nIn terms of a story, there is no story, just 6 little sisters just deciding one day they all want to fuck their brother for no apparent reason other than they love him all of ... a sudden while he does absolutely nothing.\n\nArt:\n\nNever before have I been put of by the art of a show, whether it be a hentai or an anime, this much. The character designs were unmemorable and the sex scenes look like they've been made by alternating between just 2 keyframes. The only thing that was animated fluently was them showing of the cum in their mouths and this looked so weird that in the end I just ended up losing all of my horniness (as we all should) and getting instantly soft.\n\nSound:\n\nI honestly can't remember any of the soundtrack if there even was any, even though i finished the show 15 minutes ago. The dialogue was basically only women moaning with the voice of a 6-year-old.\n\nEnjoyment:\n\nAs mentioned previously I went into this hoping to atleast get a good wank out of this and maybe even enjoy the story but that didn't work out since I was so disappointed I couldn't even think about having some fun. Quite frankly, the only reason I finished this was so I could write this review without being that guy that hates on something he has only seen the first 10% of.\n\nTl;dr:\n\nThe fact that I felt the need to make my first review about this said enough. Just don't bother unless you like seeing poorly animated underage girls getting fucked by their brother for an hour without even a minute of decent story or atleast a set-up to a story.\n\nIf you read this whole thing, congrats, you have no life if you just wasted a few minutes of your life to read a rant about a shitty hentai.
