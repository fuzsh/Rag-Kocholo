        "text": "Hey, everyone. BlackDragonHunt here—part-time translator, part-time code monkey—to talk a little bit about what went into porting MYTH. This is part one in a three-part series.\n\nNScripter\n\nTo start with a little background, MYTH was originally scripted in NScripter, a visual novel engine written by Naoki Takahashi. NScripter has been around since 1999, and if you’re familiar with visual novels, chances are you’ve at least heard of (if not played) some games that use the engine—such as Higurashi, Umineko, Narcissu, and Tsukihime, just to name a few.\n\nNScripter code resembles a mix of BASIC and assembly language, equipped with pretty much all the basic functionality you’d expect of a visual novel engine. For example, here’s a short excerpt from the beginning of MYTH:\n\n*R1_ASGA00 gosub *windowset_nv mov %chapter,2 mov $now,\"違世界プロローグ「意識の始点」\" if %flag_H == 1 skip 2 if %1005 == 1 && lchk *R1_ASGA00_ok skip 2 goto *R1_ASGA00_top mov %300,1 name \"シーンスキップ\",0 mov $52,\"*R1_ASGA00_ok\" mov $54,\"*R1_ASGA00_top\" goto *sceneskipcheck *R1_ASGA00_top mov %300,0 bg \"black\",18 bgm \"sound\\se\\tokei.wav\" HB1 br:br:br:br:br 暗い、黒い闇にいた。\\ br:br:br:br:br そこを『黒』とも『闇』とも認識出来るだけ、 僕は正常。@ 他にも『時計』の『音』だって、分かる。@ 『階下』という言葉、『足音』という言葉だって。@ 『ママ』という言葉だって。@ br 分かるんだ。\\\n\nThis code:\n\ncreates a label\n\ncalls a function that sets up the text box\n\nsets a couple bookkeeping variables\n\nchecks to see if you’ve already read the scene, offering to skip it entirely if you have\n\nsets the background to the color black\n\nstarts playing BGM\n\ndisplays the text box\n\nand finally, shows two screens of text\n\nIt’s relatively straightforward, if a bit verbose—in total, the entire game is a little over 90,000 lines of NScripter code.\n\nNScripter and English\n\nAs with many visual novel engines, NScripter is designed primarily for use with Japanese text—scripts must be encoded in Shift-JIS, which for all intents and purposes restricts us to the use of the ASCII range, and it doesn’t support proportional fonts. So as-is, NScripter isn’t ideal for use in an English-translated game.\n\nThere are other options, though: ONScripter, an open-source clone of NScripter; ONScripter-EN, a branch of ONScripter tuned for use with English text; and Ponscripter, or “Proportional ONScripter,” which has support for Unicode and (as the name implies) proportional fonts. The farther down the line you go, the nicer they are for English, but the less compatible they are with the original NScripter scripts.\n\nI experimented with each of the above options before tentatively settling on Ponscripter-fork, to my knowledge the most up-to-date version of the Ponscripter engine (with the added benefit of Steam support built-in). Nothing was able to handle the MYTH script as-is, but Ponscripter-fork looked like the most promising option in terms of providing a pleasant user experience.\n\nSo I pulled down a copy of the code and started chipping away at it, attempting to implement any missing commands needed to get the MYTH script into a playable condition. But after a couple days of hacking, it became clear that both the script and the engine were going to need a lot more work than originally anticipated to get them to play nicely. In addition to the missing built-in NScripter functionality, MYTH’s intricate UI brought Ponscripter to its knees with frequent crashes and images that would go missing for no apparent reason. But perhaps the biggest obstacle was that Ponscripter doesn’t support plugins, which MYTH makes fairly considerable use of, meaning heavy rewrites would be necessary.\n\nIt was around this time that it was decided that our release of MYTH would include the Japanese text, which was yet another hurdle I had no idea how to approach using Ponscripter. (Witch Hunt would later prove themselves much cleverer than me, managing to implement both text swapping and image swapping into Ponscripter for the MangaGamer release of Umineko.) So I decided this approach was going to be too much work and took a cue from Doddler, choosing instead to port the game to a new engine entirely. Rather than using Unity, as he does, I decided I wanted to use Ren’Py. Python is my language of choice, and I’d always wanted to try building a game in the engine.\n\nRen’Py\n\nRen’Py is a free, open-source visual novel engine developed primarily by Tom “PyTom” Rothamel. Ren’Py has been used for a wide variety of games, including our own Demon Master Chris and A Kiss For The Petals – Remembering How We Met (which was also ported from another language).\n\nThe engine runs on Python, so Ren’Py script naturally looks and feels a whole lot like Python (it even lets you use Python code directly). It has proper Unicode support, built-in functionality for switching between multiple languages, multi-platform, Steam integration, and is extremely flexible and extendable (which I’ll be taking full, horrifying advantage of later).\n\nHere’s the same block of NScripter code from above, automatically transpiled into Ren’Py code:\n\nlabel R1_ASGA00: windowset \"nv\" $ nums[chapter] = 2 $ strs[now] = \"違世界プロローグ「意識の始点」\" if nums[flag_H] == 1: jump _R1_ASGA00__00006 if nums[1005] == 1 and renpy.seen_label(\"R1_ASGA00_ok\"): jump _R1_ASGA00__00007 label _R1_ASGA00__00006: jump R1_ASGA00_top label _R1_ASGA00__00007: $ nums[300] = 1 set_name \"シーンスキップ\" 0 $ strs[52] = \"*R1_ASGA00_ok\" $ strs[54] = \"*R1_ASGA00_top\" jump sceneskipcheck label R1_ASGA00_top: $ nums[300] = 0 scene bg black with effect18 clear_sprite 0 play music \"sound/se/tokei.wav\" fadeout fadeout_time fadein fadein_time loop window show effect12 translate None _R1_ASGA00_line_00000: spk \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 暗い、黒い闇にいた。\" translate None _R1_ASGA00_line_00001: spk \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n そこを『黒』とも『闇』とも認識出来るだけ、\\n 僕は正常。{w}\\n 他にも『時計』の『音』だって、分かる。{w}\\n 『階下』という言葉、『足音』という言葉だって。{w}\\n 『ママ』という言葉だって。{w}\\n\\n 分かるんだ。\"\n\nIgnoring the rather ugly scaffolding code necessary to emulate some of NScripter’s low-level functionality, it’s fairly easy to see that this is doing essentially the same thing as the excerpt above. It’s also a lot easier to read—though still a far cry from how you’d probably write it by hand.\n\nSo with an engine finally picked out and feeling a whole lot more comfortable, being on my home turf, I set out on the (still extremely daunting) task of converting all 90,000+ lines of NScripter code into (nearly) identically functional Ren’Py code.\n\nBreaking Things Down\n\nBroadly speaking, there are a couple different ways you can go about porting a VN to a new engine. You can, as Doddler does, write code that parses and runs the original script directly—essentially a single-game emulator of sorts—or you can translate the code into a new (presumably existing) language. In choosing Ren’Py for my port, I did the latter.\n\nAs I mentioned above, NScripter code resembles a mix of BASIC and assembly language, while Ren’Py is based in Python. You can probably imagine the two look almost nothing alike, and there are some fundamental differences in the way the two engines operate that make 1:1 translation nearly impossible. So first, I had to divide the 90,000 line script up into two parts: a “program” section and a “script” section.\n\nThe program section consists of the various subroutines responsible for implementing game-specific functionality such as menus, the user interface, and handling the general flow of the game. These are essentially the game’s skeleton, amounting to ~7,500 lines of code, which I would have to rebuild by hand in Ren’Py.\n\nThe script section, on the other hand, is the meat of the game—it’s where all the text is contained, where sprites are shown and music is played. This section, just shy of 83,000 lines of code, is structured fairly regularly and generally doesn’t do anything too complex or unpredictable. All the fancy stuff is off in the program section, and the script simply calls those routines as needed. This section I would attempt to transpile into Ren’Py automatically, as doing it by hand would be a herculean task.\n\nFor these posts, I’ll mostly be focusing on the steps required to make the transpilation step possible.\n\nThe Easy Part\n\nAfter breaking the script up into logical sections, I set out to write a preliminary transpilation script for automatically converting a subset of NScripter code into Ren’Py code.\n\nAs both are engines designed for creating visual novels, a decent chunk of basic NScripter functionality has fairly straightforward Ren’Py equivalents. A line prefixed with an asterisk creates a label. “mov” assigns a variable. “goto” means “jump”. “bgm” means “play music”. “return” means… “return”.\n\nNot everything was so straightforward, but with the basics implemented, I was able to have something resembling a game up and running in just a couple days. But “something resembling a game” isn’t good enough—I had to replicate everything, not just the easy stuff—and I had a long way to go.\n\nData Management\n\nAll but the most basic of games inevitably have to store some data somewhere, so VN engines offer you variables where you can store that data. Broadly speaking, there are two different types of data a game could want to keep track of: local, such as flags or affection points, which are specific to an individual playthrough; and global, such as whether you’ve completed certain routes or unlocked the extras menu.\n\nRen’Py allows you to store local data in standard, named Python variables, and global data is stored on a special object called “persistent“.\n\nNScripter, meanwhile, offers two main types of variables—numbers and strings (there are also arrays, but MYTH doesn’t use them outside the UI, so we’ll gloss over that). Variables don’t have names, but are rather stored in a 4096-element list. They can be accessed using numerical literals, named constants defined at the beginning of the script or, indeed, the value stored in another numeric variable. NScripter distinguishes between local and global data by its position in the list—values with an index of less than 500 are local, and the rest are global.\n\nFor example: %10 is the numeric value at index 10. $now is the string value at the index designated by the constant “now”. $%0 is the string value at the index designated by the value stored in index 0 of the numeric list.\n\nTo replicate this functionality in Ren’Py, I needed to do two things: first, create lists in which to store these numbers and strings. Second, I had to figure out some way to determine whether any given variable was accessing data in the local or global range.\n\nInitially, I tried doing this in the transpilation step, parsing for named constants and checking to see whether it was in the global range, then substituting in the appropriate Ren’Py list. However, because NScripter allows for indirect indexing using the value of other variables, this approach was ultimately infeasible without keeping track of a huge amount of state.\n\nSo instead, I took it from a different angle, creating a simple stand-in class that does nothing but forward accesses on it to the appropriate local or global list. This way, I didn’t have to care what any variable accesses looked like, as the game itself would handle it all for me.\n\nclass NScripterNum: def __getitem__(self, key): if key < GLOBAL_START: return store._nums[key] else: return persistent._nums[key] def __setitem__(self, key, value): if key < GLOBAL_START: store._nums[key] = value else: persistent._nums[key] = value\n\nAnyway, I think that’s probably enough for an introductory post. I hope you’re ready, because things are going to start getting a whole lot messier from here.\n\nPart II: Doing Very, Very Naughty Things! | Part III: How Not to Code a Game in Ren’Py\n\nAre you ready to head back to Japan? Join Kaitsu as we dive into the newest addition to the Go! Go! Nippon family, Go! Go! Nippon 2016!\n\nHi there, everyone! I hope you guys are as excited about Go! Go! Nippon 2016 as I am. Today, I’m going to share with you the newest updates, features, and locations in OVERDRIVE’s recent expansion to this fun and educational adventure.\n\nIf you’ve been living under a rock since the initial release of Go! Go! Nippon! (hereafter referred to as “GGN”), there have been a number of changes made to better improve your simulated Japanese adventure. This includes script improvements, map selection, Google Maps functionality, sightseeing album, CG gallery, scene replay, e-mote system, and wallet system. Impressive, huh? Now sit back, relax, and let’s get started!\n\nMAP SELECTION\n\nThe slideshow below shows the transition from the original 2011 release, to GGN 2015, to GGN 2016. Originally, the reader could only select a location by clicking on the text on the left-hand side of the screen. With GGN2016, the text select has been removed entirely, and now you can roll your mouse over a location of your choice, making for a more interactive experience.\n\nClick to view slideshow.\n\nAs seen in the last image in the slideshow, you can now see who your tour guide will be before you select a particular location. This is a new feature to GGN2016, so you just roll your mouse over the icon, and their character sprite, along with a short blurb about that location, will appear. You have the option of visiting some of these locations with either Makoto or Akira, and even as a group!\n\nGOOGLE MAPS\n\nWith the GGN2015, a Google Maps functionality was added to the game that allowed you to actually see where our dear MC-kun and his adorable tour guide were visiting. You simply click the “Google Map” button in the top left-hand corner and it will open your browser of choice, immediately directing you to that spot in Japan. In this instance, we’re visiting Nakano, a new location added in GGN2016. This functionality works for any location you happen to visit during your stay in Japan.\n\nEXTRA, EXTRA!\n\nThe extras menu has been flushed out quite a bit since the original release, now with even more location entries than before (I would certainly hope so)! If you didn’t know this feature existed, the Sightseeing Album can be accessed from the “Extra’s” menu. While in the Sightseeing Album, the tabs on the left-hand side of the screen allow you to learn more about the locations you visited with either Makoto or Akira. Each tab specifically notes which place you visited (and sub locations if your mouse remains on the tab). This album is similar to that of a travel log, but a bit more informative and educational. It’s written from a first person perspective, so it’s like you’re looking over your own travel log!\n\nThis is the CG Gallery, and you can access it from the Extra’s menu (or from the Scene Replay and Sightseeing Album). Here, you can view all of the CG you have unlocked from the original, GGN2015, and GGN2016 releases. Looks like I’ve got one missing! I should fix that…\n\nBetween the original GGN and GGN2015, you can unlock 25 unique CG. With GGN2016, you can unlock 11 more CG! Hurray for more Makoto goodness.\n\nIf you’ve never seen this before, this is the Scene Replay menu. You can access it from the Extra’s menu, or from either the CG Gallery and Sightseeing Album. From here, you can quickly look back on every event, location, and scene you’ve unlocked. Day and time of day are also noted on some listings. This information is relevant for some scenes, especially toward the end of your trip.\n\nYou can also adjust the Exchange Rate and main/sub text languages. These changes will be reflected only in the text and UI from the scene replay menu, and do not carry over into your new or saved games.\n\nE-MOTE SYSTEM\n\nClick to view slideshow.\n\nGGN originally utilized static sprites and basic animations. While this was a great way to start things off, OVERDRIVE wanted to do more with their later expansions. Starting with GGN2015, the E-MOTE system was implemented into the game. This allowed Makoto and Akira to be far more expressive than they were previously, which creates a new level of immersion for GGN. They can blink, breathe, and their mouths even move during conversation. Unfortunately, while the characters themselves aren’t as crisp as their previous sprites, I’ll take the e-mote system any day! Mmm. Makoto. I should poke someone to add the ‘P’ key function…\n\nWALLET\n\nNext, the wallet function! This is a new feature for Go! Go! Nippon, and while it may just be a simple drop-down menu, it’s actually a very handy tool! The wallet lists your expenses for the day, your total expenses for your entire trip (minus your flight), the current exchange rate you entered at the start of the game, and your most recent purchases. As you can see, I’ve spent less than $20 USD on train fare, entry fees, and various food products. A similar function is available if you right-click the game window, but it doesn’t list everything in detail (simply the rate, daily, and total expenses).\n\nI was really excited to see this new feature, since I often forgot how much money I had spent over the course of a day (and overall), so everything felt extremely expensive when it actually wasn’t that bad. I think the most money I spent over a single playthrough was around $200~$300, but that varied depending on which locations I and my adorable tour guide went to. It tends to be more expensive if you go with Akira, since she likes shoveling food in her mouth every chance she gets.\n\nNEW LOCATIONS\n\nLast, but certainly not least, the new locations! I’d imagine from the map alone from the first section, you can venture a guess what has been added. If it’s not, GGN2016 added six new locations: Nakano, Rikugi-en, Yanaka, Ueno, Tokyo, Shibamata.\n\nLike all of the other map locations, you learn a plethora of information, eat local foods, and spend some quality time with a tour guide of your choice. Some locations will trigger special events like Comic Mercato (play on Comiket), a fireworks festival, Makoto cosplaying, and the pair of sisters dressing up in some very cute outfits that you definitely don’t want to miss out on!\n\n—-\n\nThat’s it for now! I hope this post has been both fun and informative for you all! Please look forward to my and some of our beta tester’s comments on GGN2016 in the coming weeks.\n\nSee you next time! o\\\n\nJoin TulipGoddess as she introduces you to the game and characters in Rance 5D!\n\nHeya! With Rance 5D and VI right around the corner, we’d like to provide some info for both newcomers to the series and old fans (since if you’ve played more than one Rance game, you know no two of them are quite the same!), so we’ve prepared some excerpts from Rance 5D’s manual in a series of blog posts beginning with this one. First up is an introduction to the series thus far, Rance 5D’s place in it, and the characters you’ll be getting to know in the game (if you don’t know them already).\n\nThe Rance Series\n\nThe Rance series is an adventure eroge series in a fantasy setting, with ero as the main focus. Each game tells a contained story, so it’s possible to play them without their prequels. Here’s a brief rundown of Rance’s adventures before Rance 5D:\n\nRance 1 -Quest for Hikari- (July, 1989)\n\nRance takes a quest to search for a kidnapped girl named Hikari. How hard could it be?\n\nRance 2 -The Rebellious Maidens- (May, 1990)\n\nRance takes a quest to save the town of Custom from four mage girls who seem to have suddenly gone over to the dark side.\n\nRance 3 -Fall of Leazas- (October, 1991)\n\nThe Kingdom of Leazas has been invaded by the Helmanian Empire and Rance is the only one who can save it.\n\nRance 4 -The Legacy of the Sect- (December, 1993)\n\nRance finds himself on an island floating above the Continent, where a Helmanian force is trying to awaken an ancient super weapon.\n\nRance 4.1 -Save the Medicine Factory- & Rance 4.2 -Angel Army- (December, 1995)\n\nRance takes a quest to investigate the mysterious appearance of monsters beneath a pharmaceutical factory.\n\nKichikuou Rance (December, 1996)\n\nAn extra scenario, outside the normal continuity (non-canon) but with the grandest scale of the series.\n\nA nation-conquering game.\n\nAs you can probably tell, the scale of Rance’s adventures varies pretty wildly from game to game. Our upcoming release of Rance 5D and Rance VI is a combo pack of one of Rance’s smaller adventures and one of his grandest, nation-rescuing ones. We’ll go into more on Rance VI in a later blog post, but as for Rance 5D, the goal of the game is described in its manual as simply “to get Rance home safely after he gets lost in a cave (but… the real goal is to have sex with a lot of girls).” A worthy cause, right?\n\nCharacters\n\nSo with that exceedingly simple premise out of the way, let’s talk about the characters you’ll encounter in Rance 5D:\n\nRance\n\nThe game’s protagonist.\n\nHe’s a warrior affiliated with the Keith Guild, making a living by adventuring.\n\nA super-first-class warrior with great fighting ability, decisiveness, luck, charisma, and all the qualities that could make him a hero forever enshrined in history… but rather than using his power for others, like fighting for world peace or justice, he uses his talent only for his own selfish desires.\n\n“I want good women, I want to fuck good women, all the women in the world are mine!!”\n\n“I want treasures, I want money, everything valuable is also mine!!”\n\nIt may be the world’s greatest injustice that this man, who could save everyone, is a brute who only cares about fucking the woman in front of him. (Oh well!)\n\nSill Plain\n\nThe granddaughter of a great mage, she should have been blessed with a great future, but she was captured by bandits while on a training journey and sold as a slave to Rance.\n\nWhen Rance bought her, she was enslaved under a spell of absolute obedience and could not defy him (the magic has long since worn off and she could escape from him whenever she wants, but despite the way he treats her, the bits of kindness he occasionally shows prevent her from leaving his side).\n\nShe’s Rance’s precious partner, who not only excels in offensive and healing magic, but can cook and do laundry, and serves him at night as well.\n\nAthena 2.0\n\nAn artificial lifeform created by the witch Frostvine.\n\nBecause of certain problems with the components that went into her, she’s a little weird.\n\nShe’s been given to Rance for the purpose of practical training in the hopes of making her more human-like, but she lives her life without a care, having sex with Rance and playing with the neighborhood children, making no progress at all.\n\nFeliss\n\nA devil (Currently a Rank 7 Genie).\n\nNormally devils are supposed to be the creatures humans fear the most, but Rance learned her true name, and now she can’t disobey him.\n\nShe’s basically used at Rance’s convenience. She leads a most pitiful existence, sometimes being summoned by Rance not even for any useful task but just for sex.\n\nBird Lithfie\n\nA totally average adventurer.\n\nHe couldn’t be called first-rate, but he’s not totally inept as a warrior.\n\nHe’s had some unfortunate encounters with Rance in the past.\n\nSuch as losing an arm, and having Rance steal his girlfriend, and his next girlfriend…\n\nNext time, we’ll talk about what sort of game Rance 5D is (in a word… it’s unique), but before we go, here’s some trivia (also from the game’s manual)!\n\nJuicy Info #1:\n\nAthena 2.0: Rance was involved a little in the production of the artificial lifeform Athena 2.0 by procuring some necessary ingredients, “Angel’s Nectar” and “Devil’s Nectar.” It’s pretty extravagant that an angel and a devil were both needed to complete her, but she’s still an idiot.\n\nJuicy Info #2:\n\nThe Hyper Weapon: The name Rance uses to refer to his pXnXs. Since it’s “hyper,” it’s really impressive. And its rapid fire ability is actually quite terrific. How many times does it fire in this game alone…?\n\nJuicy Info #3:\n\nLevel Gods: Once you get to a certain amount of fame in this world, you’re granted a personal Level God. You can summon them whenever you want to perform the level up ritual. But regular people have to go to large towns with level shops to get the ritual performed for them there.\n\nJuicy Info #4:\n\nSheqasar: The mysterious creature the Level Goddess Mikan carries. They’re strange mandarins that only grow once every several years and dine on people. A sheqasar that’s eaten ten people reportedly tastes quite amazing. The sheqasar that Mikan-chan carries has eaten only four people so far.\n\nToday, we have another installment of Guide to Rance 5D, courtesy of TulipGoddess!\n\nWelcome back to our series of intro posts for Rance 5D! Last time we introduced the Rance series and some of the characters appearing in Rance 5D. Things get a little weird today as we talk about the gameplay in 5D, as it’s a very weird game. Its manual has this to say about its gameplay style:\n\n“This game has elements of RPG and adventure games, but it’s something quite different than most of them. This game has its own rules and special behaviors, so common sense for other games of this type may not always apply to it. Please approach it with an open mind and enjoy.\n\nIt’s a game with many random aspects, so it’s impossible to play perfectly. It’s made so that you can clear it even after bad luck and failures. We recommend enjoying your good fortune while you play, rather than getting irritated at every moment of bad luck. (Of course, the game cannot be cleared completely by luck. Your choices can raise or lower probabilities.) The game has been made so that every CG can be obtained in one playthrough (there is no branching, but some choices can lead to a game over). We think the difficulty is fairly average. We think you’ll get a few game overs and have to restart from a little ways before, but please think of clever strategies and clear the game.”\n\nThat’s right, the major mechanic in Rance 5D is luck. Let’s go over the general aspects of the game and discuss some of the ways you can affect your odds.\n\nDungeon Movement\n\nMovement through dungeons is done on this roulette, with the color of the orb you land on indicating what’s in store for the party next in the dungeon. There’s a time limit in each of 5D’s five chapters indicated by the bar on the top of the screen. Spinning the roulette normally will use up one unit of time. If you spin the roulette with “Slow” or “Cautious,” you’ll use more time but you can choose where you’d like to go after it stops.\n\nThe large orbs in the center are a record of your previous spins (but only if you spin normally).\n\nIf you get three in a row of the same color, something good will happen (probably).\n\nA quick look at the different orbs and what they mean:\n\nGreen Orbs (Event): Important events. They start with 5 in each chapter, meaning there are five important events remaining. Aim for these to progress. If you use “Normal Spin,” the green orbs will increase in number, raising the probability of stopping on one. When the roulette stops on the 1 Event Orb, the chapter will end. Keep your remaining time in mind as you spin.\n\nBlue Orbs (Normal): Something happens in these places, but what happens will depend on who takes action, so try out all sorts of things.\n\nYellow Orbs (Treasure): Places with treasure chests. Sometimes you can find some really good stuff here.\n\nOrange Orbs (Monsters): You’ll encounter monsters. The monsters that show up aren’t random. There’s a set order to them.\n\nRed Orbs (Traps): You’ll set off traps. Nothing good will ever happen here, so you’re better off avoiding them. Each chapter has its own set of traps, so if you have precautionary items for them, you’ll be all set.\n\nAs for the other orbs, some of them vary depending on the chapter you’re in, so you’ll have to figure them out on your own! My personal recommendation would be to go for the Kurupiston orbs as often as possible.\n\nThe Adventure Screen\n\n1. Movement Button\n\nUse it to advance to the next scene. Cannot be used if there is an X mark over it.\n\n2. Timer\n\nTime ticks by on this icon with each action on the adventure screen. After five actions, one of the units in the time bar will be used up.\n\n3. Items on the Ground\n\nClick to pick them up. Some items are sold at shops, too.\n\n4. Character Cards\n\nRance and his party members are displayed here. The frontmost character will be used when taking actions. In this example, it’s Rance, but you could make Sill the acting character by clicking her face CG.\n\n5. Important Things\n\nThis card represents the important thing in the scene. Acting on these items (opening treasure chests, searching something) may require a success check.\n\n6. Item Cards\n\nThese are Rance’s party’s items. Not every item is displayed, just ones that may be useful in each scene. Use them by dragging and dropping them on your target. The first entry isn’t an item, but a special action the acting character can use.\n\n7. Camp Button\n\nUse to enter Camp Mode.\n\nThe Camp Screen\n\nRest Button\n\nResting costs one section of time, but character health will recover by 1/3.\n\nStatus Button\n\nCheck the status of your characters. Here, you can view characters’ stats including the amount of EXP they need to level, choose which of their skill sets to hone, and see what their weak point is (for instance, Rance takes double damage from attacks with the “light” attribute).\n\nLevel Button\n\nSummon Level Goddess (in training!) Mikan to level up the party.\n\nReturn Button\n\nLeave the camp screen.\n\nBattle Party Formation\n\nYour three person battle party is shown here (though at first it’s just Rance and Sill). You can rearrange their battle formation by clicking the characters’ face CGs.\n\nBattle Action Formation\n\nEach character has six battle actions that can be rearranged by clicking them (but they cannot be switched with other characters’ battle actions).\n\nUsing Items\n\nUse items by dragging and dropping them onto characters’ face CGs. If it’s an item that can be equipped by that character, it will switch places with what they have currently equipped. If the item is a character, that character will be added to the battle formation. Place items in the trash can to discard them.\n\nAbout the Weapon and Armor Status Bars\n\nThe line graphs next to weapons are, from the left: Attack (or Magic), Accuracy, and Durability.\n\nThe line graphs next to armor are, from the left: Defense, Resistance, and Durability.\n\nDurability drops with each battle, and the equipment will break when it hits 0. When broken, it functions at 1/3rd effectiveness.\n\nThe Level Up Screen\n\nYou can summon the level god and level up as soon as you have enough experience. Everyone in the current battle party will level up, though only in the skill set that they currently have selected. Sometimes when characters level up they’ll gain new battle skills. These new skills can be switched with one of their current six by clicking one of them. If you’d rather not replace an existing skill, click the trash can.\n\nBattle skills can also be upgraded to stronger skills by combining identical skills. If Sill already knows Flame Arrow and obtains a new Flame Arrow skill, combining them will allow her to learn Fire Blast.\n\nOnly humans can level up.\n\nWell, that’s probably enough for now! Next time we’ll go into Rance 5D’s (you guessed it) unique battle system and explain some more details about actions, items, and traps.\n\nBut before we go, more trivia, on monsters this time!\n\nRance Juicy Info #5:\n\nGal Monsters: There are both guy monsters and gal monsters in this world. They may look like humans, but they are indeed monsters. They’re born through monster-monster breeding. Even beautiful frozens sometimes copulate with squidmen… Tohohoho.\n\nRance Juicy Info #6:\n\nCapture Ropes: A specialized tool for hunting gal monsters. They can only be used when the monster is weakened, but they will capture her without further harm. Hunters make a living by capturing these monsters and selling them to enthusiasts.\n\nRance Juicy Info #7:\n\nLucky Can Can: The luckiest gal monster in the world. In fact, they’re too lucky, so if you defeat one, you’ll get oodles of experience. They live proactively, always trying to find the positives in any situation. It’s important to have a fortunate outlook if you want to live fortunately, isn’t it?\n\nRance Juicy Info #8:\n\nHannies: There are male and female hannies, as well as the Hanny King, ruler of the hannies (he does not appear in this game). The Hanny Flash attacks they release deal absolute damage to their targets. Also, magic does not affect them, so be careful when fighting them.\n\nToday, Arunaru would like to give you, our fine MangaGamer blog readers, an overview of the gameplay in Rance VI!\n\nHi there, are you excited for Rance VI to finally come out in English later this week? I sure am, I started working on this at the beginning of 2015. Remember 2015? That sure was a year that wasn’t 2016. Those were the days.\n\nBut what our marketing team is insisting I write about for you today is the gameplay in Rance VI. If you’re going into this game (or 5D for that matter) having only played Sengoku Rance, you might be surprised to learn that the Rance games don’t have a consistent genre or mechanics, so neither of these games are any sort of strategy game. Rance 5D is its own insanity that I’m not talking about here, but Rance VI is a relatively traditional dungeon crawler RPG, albeit a very well done one. The director of the Rance series, TADA, was a fan of old dungeon crawlers like Wizardry, but recognized most of them weren’t actually all that good, so he wanted to make his ideal game in that genre.\n\nIf you’ve ever played Etrian Odyssey or many of the older Shin Megami Tensei games or Wizardry or what have you, it’s fundamentally similar to those. You navigate dungeons made out of squares with a first person view, where you’ll run into random battles with monsters. An effort was made to fill the maps in this game with unique elements so it doesn’t become tedious, so there are all kinds of weird things and different events and conversations between characters that can be found. Besides the stuff you can find sitting around in dungeons, winning fights adds points to your ‘Adventure Achievements’ you see in the bottom right there, which gets you items or money for every five points you get. You can bring a total of 16 party members into a dungeon and have 6 out for combat at a time. Every battle you get into costs a point of SP from each party member you have out, and when they run out of SP they become unusable, so there’s a natural limit on how long you can spend in a dungeon at once.\n\nOutside of dungeons, you’ve got a whole list of events that gets added to as the game moves along. Most events that do anything require spending those orbs you see in the top left corner, which you usually get by acquiring adventure achievements. So the general flow of the game is: Enter dungeon > Go until you finish your mission in the dungeon or your party runs out of SP > Check out events with whatever orbs you picked up. Besides having the effect of progressing your relationship with different characters (Half the time Rance does something that annoys them, but the game says it’s improving their friendship, so I guess it is), you can also power up your party members this way, so there is a gameplay benefit.\n\nBattles are relatively straightforward RPG stuff, you’ve got a party of six people and you fight up to six enemies. There’s no MP or anything, so you can use any attack your party members have as many times as you want, but stronger moves generally have a charge time before they activate. The main limiting factor in the game is your SP, so you need to save your better, lower SP party members for harder battles. Also, unlike games like Etrian Odyssey, you’re using premade characters instead of making their own, so everyone has unique skills specialized to different jobs. Rance is the hard hitter, Sill can heal and use some offensive magic, but not as well as people who use offensive magic exclusively, and so on.\n\nAnd that’s more or less how Rance VI goes. Even if you know nothing about Rance or didn’t care for Sengoku Rance, if you’re into RPGs at all as I am, I highly recommend it. It’s personally one of my favorite RPGs of all time, both because it’s a solid RPG, and because the characters and plot are great and much more involved than Sengoku’s. Please tell all your friends and help make Rance VI the #1 Christmas gift of 2016, thanks.\n\nRance VI + Rance 5D is currently up for pre-order! On sale December 23rd!"
