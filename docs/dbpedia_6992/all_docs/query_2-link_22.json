        "text": "Oh wow. That 2D bishoujo art and drawing sure does make your heart squeal, eh? Oh yeah! 2D lovers are going to love the tons and endless forms of bishoujo art floating all over the internet. Yeah, 1TB of 2D maid porn pictures on my hard drive is not enough for my endlessly growing obsession collection! Oops!!! Revealed too much there… But yeah, those stunning 2D and 3D graphics weren’t the way it always used to be. They came from a long way back in the 80’s and 90’s where many of you young pups were still not even born. Yup, it is time for a bit of nostalgia as 16bit Sensation: Another Layer is going to have our main character getting the blast to the past treatment and learn the awesome and humble beginnings of the bishoujo world since her current graphic designing job sucks. But hey, at least it is not isekai! Heh. Alright folks, let’s make bishoujo great again! Or rather, make bishoujo even greater!\n\nEpisode 1\n\nUnderstandably, Konoha Akisato is panicking. Because she finds herself back in time. More precisely, December of 1992! She’s trying to leave some desperate message in her phone but it ran out of battery. As always. Flashback to see how she got into this predicament. You see, Konoha loves bishoujo games and designing such characters. Her dream is to be a great illustrator. However she is stuck in some illustrating assistant job. So much about her big dreams. Even when she goes home, she continues to have this spark of hope that her designed character will one day see its day as she works hard on her designing. Next day when her boss asks for game opinions, Konoha starts ranting about the most epic and ideal opening ever. Yeah, all that and just the opening! No wonder the boss chews her out because nobody today is into such monumental games. Yeah, this MILF hypnosis game is all they can manage now. Bummer. During lunch, Konoha stumbles upon a game shop that sells retro bishoujo game titles. Was there such a store. She is even shocked to see legendary titles selling at dirt cheap price. She asks granny all about it but obviously she knows nothing. Granny is willing to listen to Konoha’s explanation and oh boy, did she start ranting away all those games! She also talks about her dreams and how designing bishoujo characters cheers her up. Granny is sure that any games she makes will be good. This makes Konoha feel sad as she laments about the culture at her workplace. Basically nobody dares to dream and such games cannot be called games at all. Due to circumstances, she can’t quit the company. But all that blurting made her feel good so she hopes to come back here soon. Next day as she returns, the whole shop is empty and is for lease. However granny left a bag of games for her. A shocked Konoha takes and opens one of them. A bright light flashes and before she knows it, she has gone back in time. Meiko Uehara and Kaori Shimoda seek Mamoru Rokuta’s help to debug some programming line. He doesn’t look too happy to clean up after their mess. As he takes a break outside, he vows to quit this once the game is completed. After all, he doesn’t see any potential in bishoujo games. Shortly, a panicky Konoha crashes into Mamoru. She is now truly in shock that she has gone back in time. This is supposed to be where her workplace is but it’s not.\n\nEpisode 2\n\nKonoha still can’t believe she travelled back in time and must have took a wrong turn. See? This workplace is a different company. So bye. But seeing she has no place to go and a stranger in such times, she returns and wants to seek help. Mamoru isn’t impressed but Meiko and Kaori are happy to help her. So Konoha explains about this time travelling thingy to them. The other staffs include Kiyoshi “Kyonshi” Gomikawa the scenario writer and Masaru Rokuta the manager. The find it hard to believe her words. Yeah, don’t understand what she’s saying. Too futuristic her words! Fearing she will be kicked out, she claims she is a bishoujo game illustrator and can help them. She tries to show some of her works but remember, PDA dead battery! Masaru isn’t hiring but the girls could use extra help. For now, Konoha is hired but unpaid. Uhm, so, volunteer work? Happy Konoha thinks she can get by. Especially using her knowledge from the future to make bishoujo games invincible. Well, only one small problem: Ancient technology! Oh man, you’re not expecting to use the mouse to paint your image?! How barbaric is that?! Photoshop? Tablet? SSD? Alien words! Your knowledge is useless here!!! Mamoru teaches her some of the basics as Konoha gets used in learning the ancient technology. She finally gets the hang of it and completes her first task. Such an achievement. Later she asks Mamoru why he is working here. Apparently he claims his programming is perfect and has no bugs so he does debugging for fun. To her shock, he claims he wants to leave this company once it is over as he sees no future in the bishoujo games market. Those aren’t real games made by people who can’t make regular games. Konoha would sure love to disagree with that as she rants in the future bishoujo has become so popular and everywhere. You think all her innocent passion that she wants to make such games would make Mamoru change his mind. Too bad he still thinks she is nuts! He still dismisses her as having such experience in the industry although he finds her passion for this genre rare and genuine. Then as everyone celebrates the completion of their game, Konoha fools around with Mamoru. She accidentally slips. When she wakes up, she finds herself back in her own time. Back to the future?\n\nEpisode 3\n\nWell, Konoha might be back in her rightful timeline but she’s doing the job she hates. She checks online for that company, Alcohol Soft. Yes, the game she made is up there but it is out of print and when she tried to call that company, no such number. Worse, this new generation of gamers don’t know who that company is. None of the shop owners know them either. Yeah, it’s been quite a while they’ve stopped stocking on DOS games. Konoha then returns to the vacant lot where granny once lived. She takes out one of her games only for a naughty doggy to steal it. When she gets it back, magic happens. Oh, another time slip back. This time to 1996! Damn, those guys at the pool didn’t find something strange a girl just popped up in the swimming pool?! Happy Konoha rushes back. Yes, Alcohol Soft is still around! Yahoo! Even more so to see Mamoru. However he is not pleased and leaves. Oh. Some argument? The other girls recognize her. I suppose they don’t understand her time travelling story and think she lost her direction for 4 years! Anyway, the thing is, Windows is now all the rage and they are going to make games based on that. However Mamoru as their only programmer refuses to do it since he wants to work on only his PC-98. Well, Konoha thinks she now has what it takes to work here. It’s Windows, baby! Win10! Yeah, WHAT’S THAT?! When she tries to show her app, now it doesn’t turn on. That water must have shorted its circuit. Dang.\n\nSo if Konoha wants to work here, she must first bring Mamoru back. Troublesome task but oh well, gotta do what she gotta do. Along the way, she bumps into shy girl, Touya Yamada who has trouble entering a game store herself to buy a bishoujo game. It’s a very discriminated time, if you know what I mean. So Konoha has that looks she is a veteran? She sees no issue to accompany Touya in to buy a game. Touya is grateful but Konoha needs to return to her main mission. She finally finds Touya and it seems he is not too fond she disappeared on him like that after that passionate vow. He remains adamant he will only make games on PC-98. Nothing else. Since Konoha says it doesn’t matter if it’s Windows or PC-98, this makes him mad. So he shows him the PC and if she can name every port and cable, he’ll return. F*ck yeah, know any cables other than that power one?! This makes Mamoru mad and sad. The irony that those passionate about making games don’t know the basics of PC. You must talk to them! F*cking hell, see how Mamoru talks to his PC! CREEPY! However Konoha is impressed. None of her colleagues have this sort of passion and that is why she is adamant she wants to work here. As usual, he maintains his stand, PC-98 only. He also warns her, seeing she is a time traveller, don’t do anything to change history. Hence don’t interfere with what he does.\n\nEpisode 4\n\nWell, Konoha turning into a stalker outside Mamoru’s place! Since he remains stubborn of not budging, vows to be back. And about that not changing history thingy? Nobody listens to her so she’s not worried! So I guess this means Mamoru won’t be listening to her too, huh? Meanwhile Meiko and Kaori has seen other reputable game companies using the latest software and tools. So much easier to use and the results are fantastic. They definitely want to invest their new games in these. Konoha returns. But it is to bring her camping gear as she is going to sleep outside Mamoru’s place until he gives in! Okay. Ganbatte. Along the way, she bumps into Touya. She has more confidence now visiting such stores. They have lunch together and Konoha almost gives away the future by telling the mainstream things that will become big. Oops. Uhm, she feels this is how the future will be. Konoha camps outside Mamoru’s place but falls asleep like a baby. So it’s no surprise the next morning, she makes a panic call to Alcohol Soft that Mamoru has gone missing. No time for that as they have to prepare for Comiket. During that, they have to discuss whether or not to replace Mamoru. If he doesn’t return, that is their only solution. But be surprised, her shows up in a PC-98 cosplay?! He’s back! Later he talks to Konoha and claims this cosplay is his goodbye to PC-98. When she was asleep, he saw his tablet. He realized nothing in this age has such device. This means it is true in the future PC-98 will die out. Actually he knows it is on a path of decline but refuses to face reality (since he has grown up with it). However Konoha tells him to work his ass hard off so that PC-98 will continue to exist in the future. It always happens in the movies, right? Screw changing the future. Is this how deep your love for PC-98 is?! Mamoru is happy but also feels weird since nobody is this passionate about eroge. They return to their booth and it’s a sell-out. Even Touya pays Konoha a visit. With Mamoru back at Alcohol Soft, he programmes their next game and they eventually finish it. As they celebrate their completion, Mamoru has taken the initiative to fix her broken tablet. At least, connect it to some power source. She shows him her art and he is stunned with the visual quality. OMG. This is how bishoujo looks like in the future?! For some reason he doesn’t want her to show the rest this so a little struggle ensues and she falls on him. Then she disappears. Now you believe! Hope this doesn’t mean she is a ghost!\n\nEpisode 5\n\nKonoha could be one of those characters who hates returning to her timeline. But she isn’t giving up. She thinks she knows the trick to time travelling. She realizes the date she returns to depends on the game box she opens. It is the release date of that game. However it seems only games from granny will work and not hers. This is when she realizes something terrifying. There are a few empty spaces on her shelves. Those were filled with games. Uhm, so did she change history? Oh my, she’s getting scared now. She returns to the job she hates until she gets her courage back once more to try. Opening another box, now she is back in 1999. Yahoo! However to her shock, the building Alcohol Soft once stands is no more. It is now a huge corporate building. But to her relief, there is Meiko and Kaori. Yeah, Alcohol Soft has a huge upgrade in terms of building. Everyone is older and it’s like time stood still for Konoha. So she went to change clothes and took 3 years?! More believable than time travelling! They have a lot more staffs too and yeah, Konoha has got a reputation for being that legendary part time staff that disappears and pops up again in a few years! Obviously Mamoru is not happy she disappeared. But as she is about to tell him the trick of time travelling, Masaru comes in with great news: They are going to have a game on console and the one who is backing them is a famous producer named Ichigaya. He has a vision that bishoujo games will be the future, something the current people in the industry will not accept. Thus he is going to hit while the iron is hot and rake in the cash. So as everyone gets hyped up for this, Konoha further talks to Mamoru about the time travelling and this time her fears of changing it. He finds it strange. Wasn’t it her who told him to change history? And what’s her reason of coming back in time? Sure, it is to make games and meet the nice people of Alcohol Soft again. However she is really worried so she is fine not wanting to be directly involved. Hence she is going to be a cleaner? Going to make as little influence as she can. Later another talk, Mamoru is worried about Masaru because he can tell he cannot keep up with all the changes this industry is going through. He is putting up a tough act just to show he is still useful. Then some card slipped out from Konoha’s garbage bag. Mamoru notices this is a cosplay club Ichigaya runs. Time to investigate this shady mother.\n\nEpisode 6\n\nWell, Konoha doesn’t want to interfere with this timeline so she’s not doing anything game related, right? So what better way than to make her stake out at the club! Wished you did something game related now? Must be bored staying there to whole day. She sees a boy trying to get his dropped coin under the vending machine. After she helps him, she bumps into Touya who is now looking different. She thanks Konoha for that talk since she has found great success in this line of business. She is working with a studio that makes great games. With Masaru showing up, Konoha cuts short the conversation to inform Mamoru. Yes, please tail him into the club too! So she eavesdrop him badmouthing about the staffs and that he should be taking the credit for all the business deals. But the straw that broke the camel’s back is the amount of money he ‘invested’ to get Ichigaya to land this deal. This conversation is recorded as Kaori and others confront him about this. Especially about using the company’s money for such shady deals. When the staffs do not buy his denial, he lashes them about working his ass off in making such deals and does not even take any credit for it. Things are about to get worse because right now on the news, Ichigaya has been arrested by the police for fraud. Masaru goes into shock because he trusted that guy. Give back my 1 billion yen! ONE BILLION!!! With Alcohol Soft in massive debt, looks like the only way is to close down the company. For our original Alcohol Soft staffs, oh they’ll still make games. Just not for this company. As Konoha talks to Mamoru, he blames himself for letting this happen. His dad had never played games before and went into this business with no knowledge (he is in hospital now recovering from the shock!). Mamoru let him do what he wished he had done something. He could’ve prevented all this by paying attention to what dad does (he felt suspicious when Konoha doesn’t know who Ichigaya was) and at least could have in some ways kept everyone’s dreams alive. That is when Konoha claims they will make a game to save Alcohol Soft. Mamoru doesn’t sound enthusiastic about it but Konoha is done not changing history. She has always wanted to make a game with them but her fear of changing the past stopped her. If she doesn’t use her powers now, then when? But can her drawings rake in a billion yen? Don’t underestimate the power of bishoujo! As someone from the future, she can guarantee it. Mamoru gives her the green light. Make the game she wants and he’ll bring it to life.\n\nEpisode 7\n\nMamoru has a plan for what’s going to happen next. As Alcohol Soft now with Kaori as the de facto leader trying to chart their next path, Mamoru has Konoha spill the beans. Actually, the story of her being from USA so she has the experience in this industry. As proof, she shows her artwork on the tablet. Amazing! However, even if it is so, they don’t have the technology to do it. Don’t worry. This is where Mamoru comes in. He has improvised his PC-98 and stacked them up into some super multi-core processor! It can handle the pressure and demand of such art! One more thing that worries Kaori: Will Konoha not disappear this time? She promises she won’t and hence will take responsibility in seeing this through. Time to go get that billion back. And Konoha has come from across time the sea to help them! She guides them on how to draw this awesome and everyone does what they can to help out. Konoha also suggests adding lots of merchandise to their game like dakimakura. Hashimoto wonders if they can sell as they are so pricey. Konoha guarantees fan will splash the cash especially on their favourite characters. Soon, Masaru escapes from hospital and barges back here. Why? Ichigaya sent him a key to some locker. Inside is a bag. Masaru thinks it is money but it turns out to be visual concepts of the console game. In a way, it proves that he was serious in trying to port the game on console so he is not totally a scumbag although generally he still is. Masaru gets his motivation back. He pleads to become manager again and will raise any amount they want for the budget. Welcome back, boss. With lots of ups and downs, Alcohol Soft progresses well in making the game. One night as Mamoru works late, he suddenly notices Konoha’s bag on fire. Well, the bag is okay but her game content is all burnt except for 1. When he opens this really old retro game, he vanishes!\n\nEpisode 8\n\nMamoru finds himself back in 1985! In this spot before Alcohol Soft’s building, it is a game company called Echosoft run by a pair of strange people. Both are named Echo! Even their dog too! So for identification, we’ll call the guy as Echo 1 and his cute little assistant Echo 2. Doggie is 3. As Mamoru has no way of returning back, he agrees to stay and do chores. He also helps them with their programming (as long as it is PC-98!). Take out your pen and paper if you’re interested to know some of the back water programming techniques of yesteryears! Too ancient for you to even know it exists, eh?! As Echo 1 could make games in record time all by himself, Echo 2 dresses up in strange cute outfits for Mamoru to give points. But there’s something strange and I believe it is not from 1985! Because Echo 1 drops his finished game into some liquid to see if it is fun! If it doesn’t light up with energy, it means it is not. I don’t think that is how it works in 1985! It seems Echo 1 claims he is from a place with no imagination and thus has none. Each time he calculates in making a game, but the results turn out otherwise. As Mamoru tries to explain imagination but he (and me!) getting even more confused by it! So experience in others is just some sort of analysis? WTF I’M CONFUSED! One day, Echo 2 goes missing and since Echo 1 couldn’t be bothered since he believes she will not be in danger, Mamoru goes to look for her anyway. He finds her wandering in the streets walking Echo 3. Then it’s like she felt compelled to return with him. Then after another round of judging in which he gives zero points, suddenly she understands what imagination is. Echo 1 too. They decide to merge. Mamoru is told to meet them at the rooftop. Echo 1 says he feels this place will have a future and brimming with energy. A place where anything is possible. Not analysis or observation. Just his imagination. He further talks about the power of human imagination. They hint about creating everything from the past and future. You’re not imagining things now, are you? So are they aliens? Are they gods? Uhm, through imaginations, humans become multi-dimensional beings to access the past, present and future. Imagination alters time and space. Imagination defines reality. Holy f*ck, I think I’m pretty confused with this sci-fi trip now!!! They believe they will meet again in the future and vanish. Mamoru wakes up back in 1999. All a weird dream? Or just his imagination?\n\nEpisode 9\n\nWe are given a few brief details about this game they’re making, The Last Waltz. How many endings and CGs, etc. Even how much curry they ate and baths they took?! How relevant are those?! Oh well, all towards the completion of the game. Everyone is so happy and starts celebrating. They even talk a walk downtown to see their promotional poster on the stores. Meiko talks to Konoha that she was initially sceptical about girls making hentai games but now it doesn’t matter. She wants people to play their games. Konoha soon realizes she is going to disappear. Looks like time is kind enough to give her some time to talk to Touya who once again is impressed with Konoha’s vision. Yes, the bishoujo theme is taking over and blooming. So spot on like as though she predicted the future, eh? Touya intends to create her own game company and hopes Konoha can join her to make games. However Konoha says she can’t stay for long this time. But the next time, she hopes to and they’ll talk a lot about games. Meanwhile Mamoru is at a store and sees an old game by Echosoft. The storekeeper mentions about some rumour he heard the company went into some shady dealings and caught the eye of the police. Though, nothing much conclusive. Mamoru realizes he really went back in time and it was not all his imagination. He also remembers telling Konoha about her games burnt up since she only has 1 copy left. He wonders if it was right for him to use those games to time travel since it was Konoha’s privilege to begin with. Now Konoha talks to Mamoru and wants to thank him for everything. He believes their game will sell because he could feel the energy brimming from it. Imagination? Although he thanks her because it was mainly because of her that Alcohol Soft got through and is where it is today, Mamoru also feels he doesn’t want this town to change. He would want things to stay the same but obviously change is rapidly coming at a lightning pace. When Mamoru realizes Konoha being quiet, looks like she has disappeared again. He expected it and feels sad. Konoha returns to her own time. She is done going back to the past and has learnt a lot from it. Time to make do with all that in the present. But as she exits the building, she realizes many of the buildings are different. Eh? Where is she? Is this Akiba? She runs around panicking, looking for any trademark she recognizes. When she does, it is being demolished. The workers try to remove her from the site but their boss will handle this. Guess what? It’s Mamoru! Oh man, he is older!\n\nEpisode 10\n\nSorry Konoha, all is not a dream! She explains that this year 2023 is where she originally came from but all the usual otaku buildings at Akiba are gone. Actually, Akiba has turned into a residential place and if you want some otaku stuffs, you have to go to the outskirts like Ikebukuro. Technically games still exist and currently the one being released is the hit from America: Fate Gears Of Order! WTF?! Saber looks like an ugly mother!!! Yes Konoha, now know the true meaning of fear! Mamoru further explains after The Last Waltz was released, it became a hit worldwide. It got ported to consoles and adapted into a TV anime and drama. Yeah, Americans loved it. Long story short, Alcohol Soft is now based overseas in USA just as many other big game companies because it is easier to raise capital and make your games there. Alicesoft is the only big name in Japan. Mamoru remained here to supervise things in Japan. Obviously Konoha cannot accept this. Even more so bishoujo is so f*cking ugly! In short, bishoujo is dead! Then she goes downtown to check if any games she recognizes are still available. Well, there store has a special section that encases The Last Waltz and it is the last original box. Everybody staring and worshipping it like God! More horror for Konoha as all the games that came out, she recognizes not a single one of them. She starts to blame herself the success of The Last Waltz for the change in history. And what’s this? The new cool slang for moe now is cuu? Coined by Americans as it is short for cute! Meanwhile Mamoru does some sci-fi thinking about parallel worlds. In short, she did not return to the 2023 she wanted and has nowhere to go. Konoha leaves heartbroken and sees on the news that Touya as a game CEO, trying to merge with another game company. Her tears start to flow as she sees Alcohol Soft’s original building is slated for demolition.\n\nOnce again Mamoru has to tell her about reality and remind her that wasn’t she the one who said it was okay to change history and go for it? Yeah. But she didn’t expect to turn out this way? Shifting the goalpost? Still blaming herself that because of The Last Waltz, all other amazing games thereafter ceased to exist, Mamoru takes her to his special warehouse. Why, it houses tons of PC-98 machines! Guess what? In this timeline no matter how hard he tried, PC-98 never became popular! So he blames her for it! She murdered PC-98! However he is quick to say that he wouldn’t know it would turn out this way. Thus it is the same for her as she cherry picked the info to blame herself. Everyone through the era made their decisions so this is where they are today and it’s not because of solely her doing. He asks if she would like to go back to her original timeline that sucks. Because thanks to The Last Waltz, Meiko is now a legendary artist. Is Konoha sure she wants to undo all that? Konoha still hates her own world but doesn’t want this to go away. Oh my, how to have best of both worlds? Mamoru has an idea. Konoha is now in possession of 1 last game box that is released in 1999. In summary, after The Last Waltz is released, Konoha must release this game from another company. Doing so will maintain Alcohol Soft’s success while preserving the games at Akiba. This will create course of events that will lead to the 2023 she knows. Bring both histories into simultaneous existence! Is it even sci-fi possible?! Only 1 way to find out! Of course she won’t have to make the game alone as Mamoru promises he and his PC-98 will help. She is glad he has never changed so one last advice that the world has only changed on the surface and it’s her job to change it. Konoha gets ready to go back in time and face herself to make an even greater game.\n\nEpisode 11\n\nGet ready to put in all the work, Konoha. Even though Mamoru has created some AI programme to help with the design (wow, in this timeline, AI has helped created many games?! Where have I heard it before in reality?!), you still have to draw thousands more illustrations for your game. Your future and history depends on it! Don’t complain! Just start working! Besides, isn’t this supposed to be your dream? If she needs some help in working overtime for the crunch time, there’s the energy drinks and other shady stuffs that only exist in sci-fi to help you stay awake! Konoha continues to work hard and also complain a lot. Mamoru notes how she is talking more like an adult but this baffles her. Hasn’t she talked like this all the while? Mamoru is worried that Konoha may be changing to blend in to today’s era. She might even forget her original memories. Better make that game fast. Suddenly she gets a call from Touya and she wants to meet. Hmm… After years of being unable to contact her and now the call goes through? So as Konoha waits at the designated place, suddenly shady MIBs kidnap and usher her into their car! At the same time, Mamoru thinks about the herculean task Konoha needs to copy and distribute the games when she returns to her original time. He notes Konoha standing across the street but as he turns away and then looks back, she’s gone. Wow. Magic? OMG, Touya’s office looks and feels like some evil villain’s HQ?! Anyway, she contacts her American counterpart, Glenn Faulkner about the merger deal they’re about to make. Glenn receives the good news that they have Konoha with them. This shocks Touya. You see, Glenn uses AI to fake Touya’s voice to contact Konoha. They believe Konoha was the genius behind the release of The Last Waltz and need her creative juice. Although she was a legend, nobody knew her whereabouts or have spoken to her save for a select few like Touya. Konoha’s talents will help them become global entertainment masters. Touya threatens to call the police but Glenn believes she will not. Promise to go along with this and he promises to make it worth her time. Meanwhile Konoha wakes up in a room. Futuristic looking room and in a futuristic looking suit. As she walks out, she is shocked to see humans lined up in incubation chambers?! WTF?! Did she time slip into the wrong anime???!!! Meanwhile sharp Mamoru realizes Konoha can’t just disappear like that. He remembers a vehicle passing by before she was gone. Now he enlists the help of all his PC-98 to search for her whereabouts! Oh my, does it have enough processing power? You bet it does!\n\nEpisode 12\n\nOMFG. The power of PC-98 allows them to track Konoha’s whereabouts to the unfinished Akiba stadium! As Mamoru makes his way there, he knows something is shady. Lots of MIBs. Definitely not the right construction worker uniform, no? Needing to get in, he remembers there was an old abandoned underground railway project connected to it. That’s right, hacker expert can hack his way through the authorized-only doors as he makes his way there. Meanwhile Konoha is further spooked when robots surround her. To her relief, Touya pops up. However Touya is not amused. Konoha looks the same when she first met so who is she exactly. A video of Glenn pops up as he talks to Konoha. He tells her the truth that this place is where they develop games. Huh? What is CI? Cybernetic Intelligence?! You see, when AI started creating games, it was a game changer because what humans took to make in years, AI can do in a day. However it hit its limit. An AI’s creativity is only so much as all the games start to become the same. Then they realize an idea. Why not put humans back to work? Hence all the humans in these pods are actually hooked up to CI and their creativity is what helps AI to create better games. Thus it is now humans assisting AI! Now, Glenn wants Konoha to become part of CI because as the original genius creator of The Last Waltz, she can utilize this 100%. Meanwhile Mamoru stumbles into a room with humans wearing VR equipment. They’re like zombies. He realizes this is hell. Touya now tries to convince Konoha to get into CI. In tears, she explains how her company almost closed down and seeing she had staffs and fans expectations, she couldn’t betray them. Thus this cooperation with Glenn who is the CEO of Planet Games of Japan. She regrets getting Konoha involved. Oh dear, Konoha now crying too?! She apologizes about not being the genius Touya thought she was. But she vows to make a game to overwrite this world and make everyone happy. Too bad that is not what Glenn wants to hear and seeing Touya is uncooperative, he’ll take matters into his own hands. During this distraction, Mamoru comes in to take Konoha and run. Also with the amazing power of PC-98, Mamoru has managed to hack the robots here to become his underlings and zap those hapless MIBs! OMFG! Touya tries to convince Glenn that she will take Konoha’s place in CI. However he tells her to GTFO because she is not even qualified. The gig is up as Glenn and his MIBs surround Mamoru and Konoha. Oh, now what? A giant UFO over the stadium?! Am I watching the right anime?!\n\nEpisode 13\n\nComing down from the UFO is Echo 2! Using her finger gun, she turns Glenn and his goons unconscious before zipping away Konoha and Mamoru. Inside the UFO, Echo 1 pops up to meet them and wonders if they have tried playing the game he made. It seems Echo 1 has been making some very long trip to come to just see Konoha. He is her biggest fan and wants her autograph! If something had happened to her back then, he needed to make another long trip and who knows when they’ll meet again! He claims Konoha as a genius and has made a masterpiece game. He shows samples of the game she makes. Uhm, colourful light balls? He claims these are all human creativity and each human possesses them. These balls then float down and get absorbed by the humans below. Echo 1 didn’t understand the game when he first played it. But after a long journey, he now does and is glad to have met her. Out aliens leave with a smile as the duo are thrust back down to the stadium. They are fine when a helicopter hovers over them. It is the Alcohol Soft colleagues as Mamoru has called them back here to help Konoha. Must be a long trip back from USA. After all the help Konoha has given them, it is now their turn to help her back. Konoha wants Touya to come with them as she still remembers their promise to make a game together. However she needs to do some cleaning up first and only then she’ll join her. Once the gang leaves, Touya calls the police to take Glenn into custody. As the gang sets up the PCs, Konoha notes there are extras. Yes, other Alcohol Soft employees like Hashimoto are back to help! They work hard on the game as Konoha makes what she wants to make. All that is left is to release it.\n\nKonoha’s final request is for Mamoru to walk with her through Akiba. As they talk, Mamoru hands her a letter to be given to himself in 1999. He hopes his past self will figure the rest. Konoha is sad upon learning Mamoru wants to keep watch over history for the next 20 years. She also wonders if by changing history, all these memories will be forgotten. Yes, this is also making her sad as she doesn’t want to forget all these. Mamoru tells her his experience with Echo 1 so he is confident he will remember. He challenges her to remember everything. They part ways as Konoha uses the last box to return to 1999 before coming back to present time. She is glad Akiba is bustling with otaku stuffs but crazier. She goes to look for Alcohol Soft place and bumps into her current boss. As she vows to make a good game, her boss is unsure of what she is talking. Because his company doesn’t make games and is doing a MILF café???!! If she is talking about a video game company, that would be Alcohol Soft. However they become so successful and shifted their base to America. He laments he should’ve gone into the video game business where the money is. As Konoha gives her thanks to Mamoru, she also makes her way to Alcohol Soft’s old place. And what do you know? Mamoru is waiting for her! Immediately she hugs him as he welcomes her back. It wasn’t easy trying to keep a small company alive without making games. So what are they going to do now? Let’s make games!\n\nError 404: Bishoujo Not Found!\n\nWell, uhm, this is how it ends? I can’t say that I am impressed but at the same time I won’t go so far as to say it is a disappointment. It’s like Konoha finally gets the kind of ending she really wants so I suppose that is good for her. She can now live her dream job and future of creating all her cute and favourite game bishoujos. Whatever the future holds for her and the rest, I am sure it will be a great one. She better make it great and successful because she no longer has those ‘cheat boxes’ to go back in time to change history!\n\nI wasn’t sure where the story was heading because I thought this was going to be another blast to the past and change the future kind of story. I didn’t expect Konoha to be travelling back and forth in between the years as I thought this would be some sort of big nostalgia trip to the 90’s and that Konoha would stay there until the rest of the season. Yeah, here I was going to think up some time paradox parody but I scraped that seeing they decided to make her jump between the years. I believe this is to stem the boredom and avoid people like yours truly to make predictable predictions about what was going to happen. Imagine Konoha being trapped in the past and had no other alternatives to return to her own timeline, it would be just one huge boring nostalgia trip back to the past because the only thing to ‘interest’ viewers would be the nostalgia of PC gaming in the 90’s. Unfortunately only old people and those from that time may understand the lexicons and the stuffs that happened in that era. For the many younger anime viewers (many who aren’t even born yet!), they will be definitely lost! Yeah, WTF this outdated technology that they don’t even understand! Even an old fart like myself who is not into this line, I found it confusing too despite they just touch the surface and did not go anywhere deep. So yeah, had they stayed on this route, most probably it would just appeal to a particular demographic and alienate the rest.\n\nI don’t know if I should say when Mamoru then had his own time trip, I felt that particular episode was a bit interesting as well as strange. Oh wow. Now they’re really trying to confuse the hell out of me with this weird alien and abstract thingy. I suppose creativity is something that you cannot explain in words. Yeah, it’s like they want to hammer into us that all of us including useless otaku guys have this potential and you just need to find that opportunity and seize it. Thanks for the tip but looks like I still haven’t found mind yet… Anyway, what I want to say is that with this strange entry, it felt like a plot convenience to end the season. Because I started to have this feeling as the season heads towards its finale, they don’t know where to go or what to do and that is why suddenly that UFO sci-fi thingy out of the blue. It was just bizarre. It felt so unreal. Even more unreal than Konoha jumping back and forth in time! Oh well. Maybe there is some subtle creativity thingy here which I didn’t catch…\n\nOf course as already seen, one of the biggest factor and pull of this series is the feature of old nostalgic games of the 90’s. Yes, they are real and not just pull out from the air. Because I can recognize a few titles (although I didn’t play them) such as Kanon and Comic Party. So if you played those games during those times, you might be hit with a sense of nostalgia to see these titles featured here. I don’t know about the copyright issues to feature so many of these titles here but yeah, they are great Easter Eggs and references for you otaku and nerds to catch. As also pointed out about the olden days of such games in Japan when they are at their infant stages (you can tell by those retro pixels), it is great to note how long that games of today have come such a long way and all those humble beginnings that really had the creators put all their passion, blood, sweat and tears into it. These methods are not delved in too deeply (because younger generations may not understand) but just scratching the surface. So if you are interested to know such humble beginnings, feel free to do your own research. The internet is now a great and easy place to extract such information. Right?\n\nThen there is the other contentious issue for this industry. No, it is not black companies and yes, while that is still an issue, what I want to point out is the effect of AI. That’s right. What we have seen from the recent potential from ChatGPT, you can say its potential is very scary. Even though I would like to point out that AI is only as smart as the human programmers programmed it to be, now I have to take into consideration about AI learning and evolving. This series probably would have started a few discussions regarding the use of AI generating games. However it seems they also went further with this notion that humans now assisting AI in doing so. Roles reversal. Which is also a scary thought because now imagine humans now become slaves to AI strictly in this context. As a human, I would say that I definitely would prefer the human touch in making games because well, there’s a human touch and emotions to it. At this point, I believe AI cannot replicate the passion that humans put into their games. At this point. So as we currently see the gaming industry right now especially in the west with big corporations making their big corporate moves just to make quick big bucks, all at the expense of poor game creators, it is a reason why I believe we must go back to basics. AI and other technological advances should be assisting us and not the other way round.\n\nKonoha as the main character, yeah obviously she looks like the main heroine of a game! So to speak. Anyway, she’s a bit whiny and scatterbrain, mostly complaining and the likes. Her dead end job is one thing but now she has been given a chance to live out her dream, she finds it impossible or at least it is going to take some herculean effort. She somehow gets by because she is the main character. The better character I would say is Mamoru. He might start off as a grumpy kid with some issues especially his bias for PC-98 (they sure want to make it look like it was the ultimate machine, huh?). He might not be as cute and cheery as Konoha but he has this resilience and gets the job done no matter what. He keeps his promises. I would definitely say that it is because of him and his unwavering support, Konoha has managed to get through without much difficulties. Sure, she still struggles but without his push, she would definitely have a different future.\n\nThere were so many times, in fact I would say all the time, Mamoru has been by her side and ally from start to finish. Through thick and thin. Without him, she is dead. Guaranteed. With Konoha traversing between timelines, Mamoru manages to stay the same with his same demeanour throughout the years. Such is a long time and enough to change a man but look at Mamoru. Damn, this guy is so resilient. So if there is a character who deserves the most credit, it is you, Mamoru. So why hasn’t Konoha date him and make him her husband yet?! Oh, this is not romance genre?! Yeah, what a waste. Because if it was, it would be distracting and I would have painted this series a cheesy one for adding in something irrelevant! Konoha just wants to make games and imagine romance getting in the way. Yeah, that would be even weirder than those visiting aliens! Or whatever they are. So sorry folks, hoping to see some sort of chemistry in the romance department blossom between the duo? Don’t hope for it. Their interaction may be amusing and solid but nothing that would lead to the lovey-dovey type. Not when the future of the gaming industry is on the line!\n\nFortunately or unfortunately, the other characters feel like they don’t make much of an impact. I believe it is not to take away the dynamism between Konoha and Mamoru. Because of that, the rest felt relegate to supporting roles and nothing more. Like Kaori and Meiko, yeah, uhm, great Alcohol Soft colleagues. It’s about time they realize Konoha is a time traveller as she has not aged each time they see her! Oh, even better. They think she’s an angel! After aliens and UFOs, you bet angels won’t be so far off! Masaru had his issues at first but slowly redeemed himself although that is mostly played in the background. Kyonshi feels forgettable since he doesn’t have much lines and even so, mostly pertaining to his scriptwriting scenario part.\n\nAs for the Echo aliens, they could be from the future or different timeline or some extra-terrestrial life form and although they may look like some plot convenience, there is nothing much about them we know. Perhaps that episode on them was confusing and it’s like I didn’t really understand anything on them. After all, they are of a different being and how can creatures like us humans understand higher beings when they turn up in the flesh? Like God and angels, right? Yeah, creativity has nothing to do with it.\n\nTouya’s character felt like she was just written for that single role for her to play in the end. Ever since Konoha met her the first time, each other time trips we see her moving up to greater heights. In the end, regretting getting Konoha involved in a dastardly scheme by a westerner. Oh yeah. The white guy is always the baddie. I won’t say it is strange considering the video gaming industry in today’s time and culture. Ah yes, big western studios and game companies with executives at the top calling all the shots and they know nothing about making games except for the idea of making money. So yeah, Glenn needed to be that necessary villain so that Touya can get her redemption and freedom. Never gonna trust a white guy from a western country in making games again, huh? Yeah, I wonder how she’ll handle and clean up all her zombie employees who got hooked up to CI. How will she compensate them? Remember people, it’s not AI that is evil. It is the human touch that makes it evil! Basically humans are the root of all evil. Heh.\n\nArt and animation are standard. The characters look like your conventional Japanese anime of today’s era. Yeah, all the girls looking cute. They are the bishoujos of this anime! Heh. Cuu are they not? Oh sorry, the correct term is moe! Of course there are also some retro at to reel in the nostalgia like those pixelated art work during Konoha’s trip back in time. Even more detail is given to all those game box arts and those Easter Eggs so it feels like you’re really holding up a piece of the past. Some CGI too especially when Konoha showcases her futuristic bishoujo works. Yeah, if only other animes could put this much quality into their sh*tty CGI effects. Don’t have the budget? Don’t even think about using CGI then!\n\nFor the voice acting, once again Aoi Koga is doing her scatterbrain Kaguya-sama mode. Strangely in that same season, she also voiced an anime character in that way (Alyssa in Dekoboko Majo No Oyako Jijou). So is she cute or what? Cuu! Oh sorry, I mean moe! Then there are a few veterans I recognized like Atsushi Abe as Mamoru, Yui Horie as Meiko, Ayako Kawasumi as Kaori (did they hire her so she could also make that single line for Saber?), Showtarou Morikubo as Ichigaya, Tomokazu Sugita as a game shop staff and Ayane Sakura as one of Mamoru’s staffs in the future. The other staffs are Jun Fukushima as Kyonshi (Kazuma in KonoSuba), Kentaro Ito as Masaru (Renji in Bleach), Aya Yamane as Touya (Riho in Megami No Cafe Terrace), Atsushi Tamaru as Echo 1 (Ethel in Saihate No Paladin), Riona Imaizumi as Echo 2 (Anna in Mashle) and Yasuyuki Kase as Glenn (Kankurou in Naruto).\n\nThe opening theme, 65535 by Shoko Nakagawa starts off by baiting you with retro beeping sounds before the fanfare blasts in. However my beef with the song is that the singer’s voice sounds bland and when she sings the song, it’s like in a single monotonous tone. Overall it just feels flat and the whole song soon comes off as weird, if not bland. In comparison, the ending theme, Link ~Past And Future~ by Aoi Koga sounds better despite being a slow moderate dramatic piece that seems to fit games created by Key like Kanon, Air and Clannad. No kidding. That kind of image conjured up in my mind upon hearing this song.\n\nOverall, this series is just rather okay. The series didn’t hit me as hard on the nostalgia side since I am not into this side of the gaming world and industry during my childhood days. With its sci-fi elements of time travelling, definitely this is not just another anime series about a motivated main character trying to make the greatest game such as New Game and Saenai Heroine No Sodatekata. Oh, what’s this? Just like in many Japanese games that have true real hidden endings, there was a preview of the true ending of the series after the final episode aired. Okay, let me see… Hmm… Why does it all look just like recycled scenes and a montage summary of Konoha’s time trips?! I didn’t see anything special from that 5 minute clip! Yeah sure, Konoha being grateful for everybody, blah, blah, blah. I wonder this will unlock a sequel! So yeah, be thankful your beautiful gaming art and graphics have come from such a long way in such a short time span. Look at all those lovely bishoujo pics posted up over the internet for your endless viewing pleasure! Keep scrolling and scrolling. Right click and save. Cuu! Thank goodness not NFTs!"
