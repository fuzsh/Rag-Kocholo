        "text": "Your name is Souichirou, or whatever the hell you want your name to be, and your dad has left for the summer, leaving you alone with your five cute little sisters in a house all to yourselves. What’s a doting older brother to do?\n\nGiven this is an imouto-style nukige, it’s pretty obvious what’s bound to happen.\n\nI started playing this game via a suggestion from a friend of mine. Moonstone Cherry was not a company I was familiar with, so I went into this game not knowing what to expect other than limited plot and lots of sex scenes. I got exactly that, but let’s be honest, it would be ridiculous to judge a nukige on plot.\n\nAs I said, the plot is pretty basic. You play as some faceless protagonist that you can name (I named mine a variety of things, such as Egg, Ass-Sama, and Sandwich) with five adorable little sisters.That’s all there is to it.\n\nCharacters: 9/10\n\nThere are six characters in total, one being the protagonist and the other five being your little sisters. A lot of times in a nukige, I’m faced with a bland heroines and an even blander protagonist that half the time I can’t even care to remember the name of. Somehow, within the span of 10-30 hours, a pretty basic timeline for a medium-length VN, this nukige introduced a set of lovable characters, all with their own unique personalities and kinks\n\nI started with Koharu, one half of the twins. I’ll introduce the later down the line. I took a shot in the dark with her; the common route is short and gives you only brief introductions of the characters. Honestly, I picked Koharu because she was hotblooded, cute, and totally inappropriate. Her H-scenes were all pretty vanilla. There was some exhibitionism, but otherwise everything was mild.\n\nNext up is Michika. Going into this game, I knew she was the fan-favorite and, honestly, I can’t say I disagree. Michika was the take-charge character of the game, the sister in charge of the family’s finances (as seen in a scene where she sells the main character’s collection of eroge.) Michika’s H-scenes consisted of a lot of femdom, which is exactly why she grew to be my favorite.\n\nAfter that was Hiyori, Koharu’s twin sister and my least favorite of the routes. Her route was the hardest to get through. As a character in the common route she was cute, as all of the characters are, but as a love option in the game, I had to force myself through her route. For one, I’m not a fan of loli routes (Koharu’s route was at least funny, I can say) and two, I found her route to be almost annoying. Oh, and there is a crapload of pee.\n\nThen was Aya, the mother-figure of the household. Aya’s route was the most romance-driven of the girls and pretty stereotypical as far as dating sim routes go. Again, her H-scenes consisted of a lot of exhibitionism but was otherwise very vanilla.\n\nThen Rio, the hotheaded tsundere-type character. Big boobs, LOTS of kinks in this route, ranging from vanilla to an armpit job, I kid you not.\n\nThe final route was the harem one. Pretty self-explanatory.\n\nGameplay: 6/10\n\nThe mechanics of this game are simple: you go through a day, then you pick a sister to “spend time” with. Even still, gameplay only gets a six because of the imbalance in selection depth. While most of the choices consisted of something like this:\n\nOnly two of the routes had anything that could even be considered route branches, and that was left to Aya and Rio’s route a lone whereas Michika, Hiyori, and Koharu’s lacked any.\n\nNot exactly the most meaningful choice selections, but still nonetheless disappointing that the other girls didn’t get them.\n\nH-Scenes: 5/10\n\nMost of the H-scenes I enjoyed were in Michika’s route but other than her route and the random assortment of H-scenes in Rio’s, I found everything to be redundant. Each route had a kink that it revolved around, sure, but even those seemed sprinkled in among the many blowjobs and other vanilla scenes.\n\nIt might have been the translation itself, the writing in the scenes seemed almost robotic and just as a repetitive as the scenes as a whole. A lot of parts I found myself idly clicking through and skimming over while every so often glancing at the picture, but otherwise I would not say there was anything special about the H-scenes at all.\n\nArt: 6/10\n\nThe art is what got me to play this game. I’m going to admit, I’m a big fan of the moe-type art style with the 2007 anime-esque big eyes and stereotypical anime tropes to fit the characters. While I am a fan of this cutesy type of style, the art still did not stand out from other visual novels and sometimes the CGs didn’t even entirely fit what was being described in the scenes.\n\nWhat gets me the most are the animated scenes. Every route, Aya and Rio’s aside (they get two) and the harem route (none) had an animated scene thrown in. It might be personal preference, but rarely am I impressed with animations in eroge and Imouto Paradise! is no exception. That being said, I won’t sit here and say that the art is terrible; it is absolutely not. It’s cute, but not memorable.\n\nIn total, I give Imouto Paradise! a 6/10.\n\nIt was not the best visual novel I’ve ever played or even the best nukige I’ve gotten through but for what it lacked in H-scenes and gameplay, it made up for in memorable characters."
