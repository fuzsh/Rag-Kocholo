I've had it on GameCube and originally had it on PS2, but I played it back in 2010 as a 3rd grader who was blown away by it, when in general it is sorta not that good of a game. To me it's more of a skip the cutscenes and just play type of game, but most levels are irritating as all hell, and I would genuinely only recommend it if you liked the Sonic Adventure games and Heroes, and don't want a gameplay switch every stage."
