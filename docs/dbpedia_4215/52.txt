I worked in-house at Ragdoll Productions from 2008-2011 and was Creative Producer, Animation Performance Director and Head Writer on The Adventures of Abney and Teal, broadcast by CBeebies, 2011. I worked closely with director Joel Stewart to develop the world, characters and tone of voice, and oversaw the writing of 52 episodes.

I loved writing these characters and this world, the landscape is based on Victoria Park in London, where the directors and I used to meet to come up with ideas. We were inspired by Yuri Norstein's Hedgehog in the Fog, the 2D multi-plane animated series of Tove Jansson's, The Moomins. It was a joy to work with Joel Stewart, Steve Roberts and Chris and Anne Wood. 'The Moon' episode is inspired by Italo Calvino, and a snowy moment in 'Snow Neep' was inspired by James Joyce's Dubliners. 'Spots' was inspired by a bush covered in ladybirds, that my twin nephews enjoyed :) - my favourite episodes are 'Frogs', 'The Camera' and 'Bop's Babies'
