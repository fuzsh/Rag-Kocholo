Her 'Defying Gravity' and 'No Good Deed' were particularly ferocious! Quite an empty audience, but made up for by the incoming 2024-25 cast in the audience showing their support.

Slight flub where Daniel Parrott (Swing) was on as Fiyero's cart driver and forgot a line, which caused Ross to have to quickly improvise on his entrance line.\n\nIncludes two perfect quality recordings from an Olympus Dictaphone and from the iPhone Dolby On app, as well photos of the cast board and bows\n\nMaster: TimeToBlowYourMind\n\n​\n\nWICKED The Musical | 3rd UK Tour - Edinburgh, Scotland | 10th January 2024 (Evening) | My Master|Limited Trades\n\nCast:Casey Al-Shaqsy* (S/B Elphaba), Sarah O'Connor (Glinda), Carl Man (Fiyero), Donna Berlin (Madame Morrible), Simeon Truby (The Wizard), Stephanie Lindo* (U/S Nessarose), Daniel Hope* (T/R Boq), Simeon Truby (Doctor Dillamond), Nick Len (Chistery), James Gower-Smith (Witch's Father / Ozian Official), Shoko Ito (Witch's Mother), Julie Cloke (Midwife)\n\nNotes: Another powerhouse performance from Casey Al-Shaqsy as Elphaba - she really is an incredible talent!
