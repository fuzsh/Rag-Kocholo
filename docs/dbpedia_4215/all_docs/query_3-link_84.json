        "text": "This essay tracks back from present-day controversies to the very beginnings of television for pre-school children. It focuses on three very well-known, long-running programmes, first broadcast between the 1950s and the 1990s: Watch with Mother, Sesame Street and Teletubbies. It also refers more briefly to other programmes from the same period, including Play School, Barney and Friends and Blue’s Clues. The discussion focuses mainly on the formal qualities of these programmes, and especially on their pedagogy – that is, how they are attempting to ‘teach’ their viewers, rather than what they are attempting to teach. It suggests that differences and changes in this respect reflect broader assumptions about childhood, about education and about media literacy. This essay is part of a larger project, Growing Up Modern: Childhood, Youth and Popular Culture Since 1945. More information about the project, and illustrated versions of all the essays can be found at: https://davidbuckingham.net/growing-up-modern/."
