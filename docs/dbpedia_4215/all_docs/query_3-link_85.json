        "text": "Lizzie B\n\nAhoy!\n\nWith the rate of work increasing, however much I love my hometown Stratford upon Avon, it was gradually becoming more and more stressful commuting to and from London, staying in ‘cheap hotels’ and/or friends sofas.\n\nA credit to those who helped me out during this time for putting up with me for so long! Frazer, Jasmine, Jeff, Tana And Neil!\n\nAfter 18months of on/off work, the time had come to make the move and commit to something of my own - However being freelance and having financial commitments the idea of paying £1000 per month to a landlord in Zone 4 of London didn’t seem to make sense. With searching websites for flat shares and becoming unsuccessful I decided to pursue a burning desire to live on a narrow boat.\n\nA friend of mine in the same industry who again I had met whilst working for Ragdoll, had been living on the Regents Canal for over a year and invited me to take a look at his lifestyle.\n\nThe second that I stepped onto his boat, I was sold. My family had owned a couple of riverboats in the past and so I already had a good idea of ‘life on the water’. I hunted for a few boats, the prices are slightly inflated for those on sale already in London and I was not shy of the idea of bringing a vessel down to London from a far. I finally found a boat within my price range, ‘Lizzie B’.\n\nShe needed some work to turn the ‘retirement home’ interior into something a little more brighter and livable, but she was a solid build with a lot of potential.\n\nThe narrow boat journey started in South Derby. The sudden realization as I wave goodbye to my parents who had joined me to start the voyage had hit me. I hadn’t actually piloted a narrow boat before, and here I am backing this 45ft of steel and wonder into the center of the Marina. The 160 miles and 120 lock journey had began, forward thrust and the sun on my head.\n\nThe smile on my face as other boaters and passers by would wave me by was stuck solid, I had fallen in love with Lizzie B.\n\nMy first ‘lock’ was to be performed with an audience, two small children and their parents who helped me open and close the gates. They pointed at the boat as it rose from within the lock. I felt like a child myself and just wanted to point in amazement with them!\n\nThe trip was blissful; I was joined by my cousin, his wife and 2 young boys on my second day. The boys were so sad when they had to leave after 5 or 6 hours of cruising. I was grateful for their company and again, seeing the looks on the children’s faces as we entered and ‘rode’ the locks and navigated under bridges only further endorsed my decision.\n\nAs I was working during the week in central London, I was spending my weekends cruising the boat towards the Regents Canal. 14-hour non-stop days, mostly single handedly. I would aim and stop near train stations that would get me to London on a Sunday evening and then return back to the boat on the Friday. Waking up at 6am and cruising until the darkness had arrived, these days were long and tiresome, but worth every minute.\n\nAfter cruising day 5, I was within commuting distance of central London, I would return back to the boat to paint and make my ‘home improvements’. The final push saw a 10-hour journey from Watford where I was moored, to a completed journey in central London’s Paddington Basin – the first stop for my new home and ‘floating office’ in central London. It was quite late at night and dark by the time I roped to the side. Lit up tall buildings that gave the basin a ‘new look’. It was like something out of a movie only I was on my boat, watching from within.\n\nThe boat still has a lot of work to undergo before it is complete to a specification that I would like, however I split my time between furthering Moon Man Dan, commuting to my freelance positions and building my own space.\n\nBeing on the boat is romantic and ‘dream like’.\n\nI was slightly apprehensive about telling people of my venture in fear that it would be judged as a ‘gypsy’ lifestyle. However, absolutely everyone who I had met and told has slightly fallen in love with the dream. I do have to say that at this point, as winter settles, the romance and ‘quirky-ness’ of the water is only so deep. You do have to pilot the boat to water points where an hour filling the water tank so that you may wash your dishes and have a shower can become a chore. Not to mention the emptying of your toilet. These are the things that many people wince at the thought, but – so far I am finding enjoyment and achievement from them. Ok maybe not emptying my loo.\n\nAs the cold sets in, sitting on a rocking boat with candles lit and the pitter-patter of rain on the roof makes this living adventure wonderful.\n\nI have had one bad experience so far; someone whilst I was away from the boat took a knife to my front ‘cratch cover’. Thankfully there wasn’t any more damage – but frustrating all the same.\n\nA replaced Alternator and a fuel line problem later, Lizzie B can be seen cruising around London. If you see a cheeky chap steering her through ‘the cut’ be sure to give him a wave!\n\nMoon Man Dan\n\nThe birth of Pickled Pepper Productions Ltd.\n\nA dream of mine has always been to craft an idea that encapsulates a team and an audience, Moon Man Dan is the first of what hopes to be many more ideas.\n\nMoon Man Dan\n\nI wanted to involve as many people as possible in the project. My reason was simply that I was in the fortunate position of having many friends who were all working professionals in the art of creating award winning television content. An opportunity to collaborate with these artists simply couldn't go a miss.\n\nMy second reason was to bring ‘scale’ to the project, pitching a project with a great team to give it weight.\n\nI am a great believer that projects which involve more than just oneself, should embrace and nurture opinion, having confidence in your team, confidence in their experience and giving them confidence to speak up is essential.\n\nMoon Man Dan was our work and we hoped that those we pitched it to, would embrace and build with it. I took it upon myself to setup Pickled Pepper Productions, a company that embraced the talent left behind after the redundancy. I set to tackle producing a finished episode, self funded by passion and personal financial investment.\n\nJeff Wixon, Rob Caithness, Siobhan McGuire, Mel Skellon, Stephen Dorrance, Jon Keifert, Adam Beardsmore, Tom Donovan, Cathal Mellakh, Adam Fenwick, Frazer Milton, Kevin Sear, Louise Livingstone, Laura Kenwright, Jonathan Hearn, Emma Chilton, James Watton had all contributed to the concept.\n\nPersonally, myself and Louise Livingstone, my partner at the time as well as her 9 year old son Hayden had worked on wrapping the educational aspects of Dan with the creative. Louise is a teacher at The Croft school in Stratford upon Avon and worked closely every day with the early years groups. She was a fantastic part of ensuring that Moon Man Dan appealed to the audience and I was ever so fortunate and grateful to have had her interest in the project and for all her help. She took it upon herself to present our pilot to a range of children and we noted their thoughts. To be included in our research, a trip to Reggio Emilia where Loris Malaguzzi's 'Reggio approach' was founded - a teaching method that tis designed to teach through creativity. One of my favourite quotes of his is,\n\n\"Stand aside for a while and leave room for learning, observe carefully what children do, and then, if you have understood well, perhaps teaching will be different from before.\" Loris Malaguzzi\n\nHere we were presented with the 'Ray of Light' installation at the Atelier. We saw children play in a variety of ways, using mirrors and light sources to reflect light and bounce them from one part of the room to another. It was a wonderful and insightful experience. We were taken through dark tunnels, rooms filled with fluorescent tubes and light reactive materials. The exhibition also included the use of sound and how we can 'see sound'. The trip contributed so much to Moon Man Dan and the projects direction.\n\nIn-between contract periods and earning a living, editing for other children’s shows and commercial TV - I had been frantically working on the Moon Man Dan project. We had created a pilot and spoken to many new connections at the Childrens Media Conference in Sheffield. After much contact making, knock backs and agonising networking/presenting - I find myself (through a contact of a contact), walking through the doors of the BBC.\n\nThe night before, whilst panicking whether the DVD a friend of mine had sent had been delivered to my address on time, and that the pitch pack was finished, I spoke to my partner on the phone. I was nearly in tears with excitement. \"This is it\", I told her.... \"years of work and this could be it\".\n\nThe following day, with a clear plastic box in hand sat on the Central Line - with the contents including the Moon Man Dan Luna- Caravan, the mini rocket ship an iPad loaded with the pilot and a pitch book. I was ready to present!\n\nWalking into the BBC was an amazing experience, with my guest badge around my neck, I find myself walking through room after room of notable programme content. In a glass room I am given some time to setup my material. The Luna-Caravan was instantly loved and after I had completed my rehearsed Moon Man Dan 'patter' and shown the episode, it was clear that I had their attention. \"you can see that you have worked in Children’s TV\" the one gentleman said. I was chuffed to bits! The meeting had been a success! The team I presented to were very positive and wished to arrange a further meeting.\n\nUpon this second meeting a few months ahead of the last, I was informed that there was a similar project currently being held at a funding fork in the road, but they remained interested. By my third meeting it had turned out that I had been beaten to the BBC by the reinvented children's classic 'The Clangers'.\n\nDisheartened but head held high, I took it upon myself to turn the pilot into a fully finished episode. I had again been to children media conferences and pitched the project around. It seems that a lot of people are interested up until the point where you aren't as 'connected' as the 'other guy' who works for [ insert large corporation here ]. But I am persistent and I wouldn't let this stop me from pursuing Dan's public existence.\n\nWith meeting after meeting with many different sources, all showing keen interest, the mission continued. The one thing that I found is that those who liked the concept would always come back with the same comment. \"looks great, yes lets meet up again when you have some more material\". A rather obscure comment to have repeated, bearing in mind that a lot of these people had claimed to have commissioned content off the back of a napkin and here I am with a team of experienced award winning children media professionals and an idea that many people, mainly of whom are my research audience loved. It dawned on me that this would be a long and hard process. Not only this, but we were on the back end of a recession, the only things getting commissioned were re-runs and re/hashed versions of the old, there was very little original content being made and if it was, it certainly wasn't being given to small independent companies.\n\nBy this point, it didn't matter if Moon Man Dan wasn't going to be on TV, so long as it had an audience. One child happy from our efforts would make those efforts worth while, and this was my motto throughout.\n\nMore and more contracting work was taken to fund a living and the project. By this time the Moon Man Dan episode had been frantically worked on and was nearing completion. It was a nervous and stressful time, bringing peers together during their own personal financial and work woes added to the intensity, but progress was made and contributed by all.\n\nWe worked together using the Internet as our ‘global office’, contributors nationally and internationally would collaborate via upload and download, using services such as DropBox and WeeTransfer to bring render files, ideas and content to the table. We were fresh and young as a company and we felt that 'the global office' was a good way to keep costs down and remain united. It was important that people were kept in the loop and could still express themselves creatively. Services such as Skype, FaceTime were essential at the time.\n\nThe effort saw me animating, compositing and editing for a solid 6 months, working even Christmas and Boxing Day to meet the April deadline. After intense dedication and long days we finally launched our episode on the 12th April 2014.\n\nIntroducing our first animation, Moon Man Dan:\n\nWe launched in Stratford upon Avon, where this journey had began. The newly built Riverside Stratford venue. There were around 100 guests at the event and I was extremely nervous. I had prepared a speech that had been chopped and changed franticly whilst organizing cardboard cutouts, flyers, promotional material and the finished film itself. There was a good mix of friends, friends of friends and industry, some who had brought their children, who of course were very welcome. After delivering a thank you and a plea to ‘go forth and bring Moon Man Dan to the eyes and ears of all you meet’ we watched the episode. A wonderful moment. Simple things like adding the words ‘Moon Man Dan’ to a Facebook page had seemed like ‘big events’ but now presenting Moon Man Dan to the world in its entirety felt very overwhelming. Some children gathered around one of the screens. Such a relief and a pleasure to hear them laugh and point at the screen. Children who had never met one another before were united and chatting, giggling amongst themselves.\n\nThis was Moon Man Dan. He was no longer mine or ours… he was the children's.\n\nSome 6 months on and the show has been a success, 30,000 and growing YouTube views from all around the world. ‘We want more’, parents and little fans would ask. ‘my 4 year old now knows the word gravity and satellite’ one mother had written in to say. 'My child always points to The Moon and says Moon Man Dan’, would another, with many more wonderful comments to follow.\n\nI yearned to produce another episode, but I couldn’t afford to create another, the money involved and the time required from others was too extensive for any more personal financial investment. Without the secured investment for at least a series of an additional 11, where revenue could be factored, to produce more was to remain a dream.\n\nThe iPad App\n\nIn order to keep an audience happy, I set about the task of creating an iPad app - An interactive storybook. Freelancing had gone well and I felt that I could invest a little more than I had forecast, however the production of an iPad app is a lot more demanding than I had first imagined and in turn, cost me a lot more investment than I had anticipated. I set the task of the app's technical development to Lorna Cooper, a freelance app developer who worked with software named 'Unity'. I had taken on the style and content production of the app, whilst Lorna stitched it all together. Lorna introduced ways to include page turns, interactive functions and nightlight timers, whilst I battled with myself about the educational benefit and style.\n\nThe app is available to download for free here > Apple App Store Moon Man Dan\n\nWithout the brand exposure or the ‘featured’ potential from the AppStore, it had been a slow struggle to bring the app to the attention of parents. But, with perseverance and plenty of time spent emailing and networking… within 4 months of the apps launch we had seen over 3,000 downloads.\n\nMarketing is a big part of the App’s existence and something that I thought would be a pleasure rather than a chore, but how I was wrong. Everyday would see a new avenue to post about the ipad app, but I felt myself becoming very ‘commercial’ and was desperate to find new routes to ‘show off’ the App. Trying to poke a celebrity for endorsement or even a loosely related company such as NASA or ESA to ‘retweet/post’ was like throwing ideas at a brick wall. I really wanted Professor Brian Cox of BBC's Stargazing Live and Wonders of the Solar System' to acknowledge it, as well as a potential future narrator, who has links to Stratford upon avon’s Royal Shakespeare Company – Sir Patrick Stewart. I was finding that being a small fish in a big pond was hard to be noticed.\n\nIt is certainly challenging whilst ‘going it alone’.\n\nFamily life...\n\nFor all the passion and dedication that I gave the concept, a realization had arisen. Amid the drive to finish the show and the daily planning and strive – it occurred to me that I was still back living at home with my parents. I love my parents very much and it was never an issue sharing space under their roof. They have never been frustrating to live with and have always allowed me space and my own direction, for which I am very grateful. I felt like I needed to have somewhere, or at least start to find somewhere that I could call my own. However, being at home at this time was a blessing in disguise. My mother who has lived with Multiple Sclerosis for as long as I can remember had been suffering a broken ankle and now the troubles of using her feet again after being so long ‘off them’ looked to be a long road to recovery. I felt that being close to my father Alan and mother Lynne during this time may have helped them through what was, and still is a tough time.\n\nI had not always lived with my parents, I had moved into a home a few years before with two work colleagues Jeff Wixon and Frazer Milton, nearer our place of work, Ragdoll in Stratford upon Avon. This came to an end upon our redundancy at the company.\n\nAround this time of redundancy, I also found that the stress and financial difficulties was tearing a hole through my relationship with my now ex partner of then two and a half years. To add to the heartbreak in our parting, it also meant that I was no longer to be a part of her son’s world. This has to be the hardest thing I have had to deal with to date. A boy aged 8 when I first met him, then aged 11 when I was to last see him again. He was and I am sure still is a great little character. He inspired much of my creativity and drive throughout the Moon Man Dan process.\n\nIn this story, I was now 28, at my parents home with a children’s media idea, looking at every which avenue to inspire and teach preschool children about our Moon and bring Dan to the hearts of all who’d have the chance to see and listen. I had pitched the show to a few broadcasters, but again, the pond is big and I am a small fish. Everybody loves you and your idea, but getting someone to commit to more than just a coffee with you – without the backing of a ‘large company’ was hard. But I knew I could do this, I had the team willing and the plan set out. I just needed a brake.\n\nSo this is where my story for the time being, comes to an end. Moon Man Dan is still enjoyed by the odd thousand or so per month whilst being shown on Youtube.\n\nWhy do we Smoke?\n\nWhy do we Smoke?\n\nIntroducing the Autodesk Smoke.\n\nIn the world of visualFX, online editing, motion design and what I playfully refer to as ‘colouring in’, the Smoke is an all in one TV post production ‘know it all’ tool… and just like smoking a cigarette, it can be harmful to your health - Late nights, technical bugs and the undeceive creatives that crowd the suites can all lead to heart disease. #notafact\n\nI was first introduced to the Smoke whilst working as a runner, also known as a tea/coffee maker and/or person to be shouted at, at the children’s TV production company Ragdoll Productions. The company, founded by the 'grandmother of UK children's telly', Anne Wood, is responsible for award winning shows such as In The Night Garden, Brum ,Rosie and Jim, Abney & teal and Teletubbies.\n\nWith 'cutting my teeth' in the crazy world of children's, I found my passion... and it lies in bringing content to children. I setup Pickled Pepper Productions in 2012 which brought ,a team and myself together to produce a concept animation named Moon Man Dan, if you haven't heard of this 'yet to be awarded' miracle of entertainment', it is available as an iPad App and animated film here:\n\nwww,moonmandan.com\n\nThe smoke system has been essential in the Moon Man Dan journey. Firstly, its sheer power and versatilely. Secondly, the people you meet along the way. 9 out of 10 Smoke operators are great people. #fact\n\nA colleague, Anthony Brownmoore now of BlueSpill, London was keen to teach me the software. At the time he was bringing together images of ‘Iggle Piggle’, ‘Upsy Daisy’, Makka Pakka and many characters whom if you aren’t aware of, ask the nearest four year old.\n\nMy time whilst learning the Smoke was spent archiving (backing up) the computers and keeping a handle on the general maintenance of the machine room, the ‘tech hub’ of the post production facility. The Machine Room, or MCR as it is known, is a place where banks of Hard Disc Drives ‘wurr’ and ‘bleep’, where buttons flash and stare at you, begging to be pressed.\n\nThis room harbours the computers that the operators link to from their client and sushi clad suites. Banks of plugs and switches with wires interconnecting and tangle to tape decks, gave the sensation of being in a rocket ships 'engine room'. It was during this time as an ‘assistant’ that I learned in-depth the different methods of TV data storage - HDCAM, HDSR, DigiBeta and tapeless formats. Knowing the heart of the facility, your formats and where a lot of the jargon used in the Smoke software derives from is essential, the machine room is a great place to get started.\n\nDuring the early days of my career, I was fortunate enough to have spent 8 months on location - my journey to the Smoke had seen me experience first hand the workings of ‘shooting for FX’. On location green screen, blue screen, motion control cameras, and studio shoots were an every day experience, and where a sponge like mind definitely absorbed and enjoyed a lot of it. Not earning much money (literally minimum wage) and working many long days are some of the most memorable times of my life.\n\nOver time, I had watched, worked and interacted with these rather strange characters and after the shoot I found myself back in the post production studio. It was an amazing feeling to be allowed a continued part in bringing these characters further to life. Knowing that my hand could have been the last to have played a part in the shots final hours was the drive to stay late and learn.\n\nSo what is this Smoke?\n\nThe Smoke is a software package. At first glance it takes you into the complete unknown. It plays with your insecurities as a budding operator and questions your methods. All that may have been learned in past software packages such as Adobe AfterFX or Discreet's Combustion is still very much valid, but the Smoke lures you in. It walks you down a path of complete nervousness with nonsense menus, swipe gestures and fx nodes. Finally it throws you into the compositing abyss where only screams of “why wont this work!” and “This is so easy in AfterFX!” echo the corridors.\n\nKnowing the software now, it is understandably complicated, it is used as a powerful tool for both compositing, fast re-versioning edits and wow’ing/confusing (delete where you feel appropriate) your client. It can produce results fast and once ‘cracked’ an operator never simply ‘operate’s the Smoke, they perform with it.\n\nTo be frank and speak in layman terms, Smoke is a ‘node and timeline based’ compositing tool, mixed into one. By linking and plugging different effects into variations of footage, one simple output then displays on your timeline as the finished shot. Colour corrections, mattes, grain, glows, counting pixels and re-edits are just a day to day occurrence when working with a client, as is sushi and craft beers. #saynomore\n\nTo learn the software that I now use on a day to day basis, it took me around 3 to 4 years of getting to grips with compositing methods and learning the muscle memory, repetitive act of ‘matte making’. From working on set and learning ‘how to shoot for FX’ which in reality translates to “why the hell did you shoot it like this” (said: every operator ever given some green screen footage) To rotoscoping until my wrist wanted to fall off. All the time, whilst learning the Smoke from many different operators, late nights and again - shouting at video tutorials. “He is doing it on the video, but why CANT I!!!???”\n\nNow you are probably wondering what this fancy word ‘rotoscoping’ and phrase ‘Matte Making’ is all about?\n\nWelcome to Matte hell.\n\nHere is what a matte looks like. I call this a Matte Monster. Mainly because it looks like a monster, but secondly, anybody who works with mattes will tell you, some mattes are monsters to make!\n\nAs my experience and relationship with peers grew, which is an essential quality to the world of operators and creatives/geeks who love Atari games and jokes about BNC cables. I had been given a chance to ‘rotoscope’ a shot of the well known (again ask a four year old), ‘Pinky Ponk’.\n\nRotoscoping is the name given to the act of ‘cutting out’ a moving image from its background so that it may be composited against another. The result of rotoscoping is known as a ‘matte’. A black and white image that secretly tells the computer what part of the image to keep and where to disregard.\n\nWithout giving too much detail, here in the UK we generally shoot video at 25 frames per second, meaning that a rotoscope artist will use animated masks to cut out an image that, lets say lasts roughly 8 seconds, in turn meaning that 200 images are ‘cutout’ and ready.\n\nFor more information on Rotoscoping, I asked the internet for you and here is the answer > ANSWER HERE\n\nMy first attempt at the Pinky Ponk took me a little while longer then the average rotoscoper, but I was new to this world and grateful to all those who ‘showed me the way’. A credit to the humour and the love that was shared amongst my peers was receiving a certificate and bottle of wine for having achieved the finished work.\n\nMany years would see me 'paint out' people drinking tea in the back of shot, or the odd cherry picker. I was assisting and gaining confidence along the way. Confidence not only in myself as a professional, but in methods and the way in which the Smoke worked. Smoke really is an array of buttons that all look the same. The menus really are hidden and to get to some, you have to know where to swipe your mouse. Practice makes perfect.\n\nMy first full role as a Smoke artist was with a series named Abney & Teal. Good friend and colleague Adm Fenwick and I had taken on the roles as actual real life ‘operators’. After a 'slap and dash, 'ok are you sure about this' two day round up course with the company XTFX London, we set about creating a workflow with the rest of the departments. We designed ways to introduce 3D methodology into a 2D world and achieved some great results using the batchFX (node based) system, contributing to the overall design.\n\n2 years and 52 episodes later… We were given a pat on the back and made redundant. #recession\n\nLife after Ragdoll\n\nThe time had come to leave Ragdoll and I found myself working freelance for other leading children’s media providers.\n\nAardman was my first port of call for my first role as a Smoke freelancer. I was to be working on a series named Shaun The Sheep whilst based in Bristol.\n\nHere I was responsible for ‘rig removal’. Each plastercein character is unable to physically stand up on its own and so a metal rig is used to keep the character rigid. Of course, the final product doesn’t have this metal rig on show, neither does its shadow, because I have removed it.\n\nimage credit > Aardman Animations\n\nI took some work with a company in London named Hogarth Worldwide, where my skills were used to help produce a music video for a band named the ‘Maccabees’.\n\nFor this film I worked with the director and another editor/compositor to complete re-edited versions of the film and composite the elements into the star filled sky. The most difficult of shots being the heads ‘splitting a part. Thank you to Adam Fenwick for his role in compositing relief. This shoot was supposed to be a motion control rigged camera, however the reality was a lot of elements that failed to align. A nightmare, but worth it for the end result.\n\nSecond Home Studio's gave Adam Fenwick and I an opportunity to work with Pilner Urquell for the campaign 'The Book of legends. A stop frame, motion control shoot using a Canon 5D camera. Adam and I stitched plates together and brought to life a paper world with director Chris Randall.\n\nGolden Square and beyond...\n\nA London commercial based facility named Golden Square Post was where I spent just over 6 months. I was fortunate to have been working with 'top brass' clients such as Saatchi and Saatchi, WCRS and M&C Saatchi. Golden Square presented me with a new world of the fast paced. A sushi eating, soho world of fancy sofas and creative uncertainty. 17 hour days, working without a lunch break. I would spend hour after hour with client after client, all sharing the same frantic battle of the mind. Were we on time and working to the interpretation of the brief? What is for lunch? This world was a far cry from the children’s market. The ‘abfab’ world really does exists!\n\nHere at Golden Square I was responsible for bringing Asda, Sky, Daily Mail and the odd European commercial to the world. Replacing pack shots, billboards (see below) and rebranding/replacing shot items - Everything was fast paced to the last minute.\n\n^ Sky Broadband, Ireland campaign.\n\nAfter a phone call from Ireland (no not from Pierce Brosnan), I was thankful for 3 months work provided by a company named Brown Bag Films in Dublin, they have been responsible for many shows such as Noddy and Doc McStuffins. I was being brought in to work with the CBeebies series Octonauts, Peter Rabbit and Disney’s Henry Huggle Monster.\n\nMy first hour there and I was to take the relief from an operator as the production slowed towards a looming deadline. \"Here are the keys to the front door and the alarm code is *****, here is our number if you get into any bother and we'l do the handover now\" Wow, I replied with \"you are very trusting of me!\" to which they replied that they were that behind schedule that they didn't have time to worry about that kind of thing!\n\nThe role consisted of finishing episodes for broadcast, this meant fixing ‘tears’ in the 3D renders and adding FX elements. Once approved, we would finalising the colour grade and work with directors and teams of production assistants and producers to ensure that the finished product was quality and ready to air.\n\nLondon Calling…\n\nAlthough the world of children’s media is happy to reside outside of the UK capital, commercial work is mostly found in and around London. As a result I increasingly found myself tootling through soho and the hustle and bustle of Oxford Circus. A company named ICP where ex colleague, then freelancer and ‘my original Smoke mentor’ Anthony Brownmoore had asked if I could cover him for some freelance work. With other work lined up, I was unable to take on the roll immediately and in turn gave Anthony a contact of mine, good friend, ex-house ‘mate’ and colleague Frazer Milton. Frazer stayed with the company and as always in life, ‘what goes around comes around’ and in this instance, I will be forever thankful that when ICP were looking to expand to another machine, I received a call.\n\nAnthony has given me some great work in the past with his company BlueSpill - working on Documentary films, National Geographic series and ITV drama's such as 'Cilla'.\n\nI found myself in London more and more as work started to come my way.\n\nICP / “International Co Production”, a company that derives from the print production world, works closely with companies such as Diageo and Unilever. My reason for being hired is that they now not only provide reversion print work, but also TV commercials for international and local markets.\n\nWherever I find myself, I seem to fall on my feet when it comes to meeting great people, Ragdoll, Brown Bag, Golden Square and at ICP this is absolutely no exception. As always in this commercial world, projects are received with tight turn arounds and the one thing that works well amongst any team, is the unified collaboration of creativity. When a project needs to be completed fast, confidence and faith in your peers is essential.\n\nThe brands I have worked with whilst working for ICP have included Johnnie Walker, Haig, Captain Morgan, Smirnoff, Carlsberg, Marc Jacobs, Guinness, Ciroc, Calvin Klein to name but a few. Using the combined efforts of Autodesk’s Smoke and Adobe’s AfterFX / Creative Suite – The digital team and myself provide re-edited, territory creative and legal, specific versions of advertisements optimised for TV and cinema around the globe.\n\nA growing trend in this market is the adapted digital display market known as ‘Digital Out of Home’; some of my time has been spent creating ‘digital billboard ads’ using the master edits from the TV advertisement or applying motion design to a static campaign. Again, every project has a different technical, legal and creative brief. The content of work that I provide for some of these city-based companies may be in contrast to the world of children’s entertainment, but the skill-set required and software remains the same. Skills are forever growing and techniques found. The world of Smoke is small and working in the capital on varied projects is essential to building a network.\n\nWith each new job, brand and idea that comes to fruition, I am learning more and more. I am meeting new people and am thankful to be earning a living whilst growing and exploring creative worlds and city life. The Smoke software won’t last forever, as this years NAB (National Association of Broadcasters) show in Las Vegas demonstrated, the software is being forever molded with it’s counterpart, ‘Flame’. “Never fall in love with a piece of software…” they (whoever they are) say.\n\nMy advice for any budding editors, VFX artists or anyone engaging with the creative world, is – be versatile, approachable and above all – passionate. The hours and the challenges you face in this forever changing industry can un-nerve even the most senior and experienced artists. Thrive on the tension, make mistakes, learn from them, find your style, put faith in the knowledge of others and become confident in how you tackle new challenges.\n\nFrom University to Full time work: Ragdoll\n\nHaving left Stratford upon Avon College and Lincoln University completing media studies courses, I was fortunate enough to land a dream job working for the internationally renowned, children’s TV company, Ragdoll productions Ltd. I worked alongside the Visual FX supervisor Lee Phillips, Directors Dirk Campbell, Alex Kirby and producer Andrew Davenport for the series ‘In The Night Garden’, an 8 month period working intensively on location.\n\nI had a few roles on set, where my hours at one point were 7am till 9pm finishing back at the studio to deliver the rushes (camera tapes) to be edited. They were long days for not much money. But this was my first job and I loved it. The set was being filmed in a woodland outside of Stratford upon Avon. A membrane covered the landscape, layered with real turf and fake flower balls. There were many strange days on the shoot, from ginormous inflatable 'HaHoo's' to half dressed characters joking around, which in essence was the every day surreal world of In The Night Garden.\n\nThis was children's TV on an epic scale.\n\nMy job was working under the VFX supervisor - Lee Phillips, taking camera distances and focal measurements ensuring that this information was provided to camera crews and directors. In turn, our frantic running about set, data collection and VFX direction meant that we may treat the footage efficiently and accurately in the final edit/composite.\n\nAfter spending many long hours working with the supervisor, my skills and live action knowledge was becoming more and more extensive. The VFX supervisors role increasingly became more important back at the studio, this is where I was able to 'step up' and become the voice of the supervisor on set.\n\nI remember an instance having an argument with one of the directors about how much green spill (when using a green screen back drop) was being reflected by the Ponitpine puppets. Shortly after, I decided that this argument was a test to prove myself in the role, for which I believe I came out the other end with having stood my ground with value. This moment paid off for the remainder of the shoot where I was now listened to and not seen as a hindrance.\n\nWhen the shoot had come to an end, I took a roll in the post production studio. During my time I had learned many pieces of software - from the basics such as Adobe Photoshop and illustrator, Autodesk Combustion, to more complex programmes such as Adobe AfterFx, PF Track, Mocha and finally Autodesk's Smoke and Flame.\n\nI was introduced to the Smoke software by a colleague of mine, Anthony Brownmoore now of BlueSpill, Soho. He was keen to teach me how this software worked and how at the time he was compositing 'Iggle Piggle' and 'Upsy Daisy' into a motion control dance sequence for the series 'In The Night Garden'.\n\nWe were using a Mark Roberts Motion Control camera, a piece of equipment that acted as a giant mechanical tripod - a computer would remember the camera move and would replicate the same move over and over. In return, with many elements being shot individually, we were able to composite them together within the Smoke software to create the final scene.\n\nMy time whilst learning the Smoke was spent archiving the machines and keeping a handle on the general maintenance of the machine room (a place where servers, computers and tape decks are stored) and software upkeep. I learned about HDCAM, HDSR, DigiBeta and tapeless formats, whilst interconnecting various pieces of hardware together to keep the six machines and various pieces of equipment alive.\n\nThe Smoke is a piece of software that at first glance takes you into the complete unknown. It plays with you insecurities as a budding operator and questions your methods. Everything you learn in AfterFX or other pieces of software are still very much valid, but the Smoke lures you down a path of complete nervousness with nonsense menus and swipe gestures. Understanding the software now, it is understandably complicated, it is used as a powerful tool for both compositing and wow'ing/confusing (delete where appropriate) your client. It can produce results fairly fast and once 'cracked' an operator doesn't 'operate' the Smoke, they perform with it. The Smoke, at this particular time seemed a long way off to master!\n\nPeople are important in this world of 'arts and production'. Like any 'team based' job - a happy team is a productive team and we had happiness in abundance. I have made some of the best and true friends in the 7 years I spent at the company and as my experience and relationship with peers grew I was fortunate that they wanted to continue working with me. John Lashley, Sean Cole, Adam Fenwick, Alison Brownmoore, Anthony Brownmoore, Lee Phillips, David Birkill, Andrew Merlino, John Mclaren, Ian Cole had put forward to be given a chance to 'rotoscope' a shot of the 'Pinky Ponk'.\n\nRotoscoping is a name given to the act of 'cutting out' moving images from their backgrounds so that they may be composited against another. We had shot a lot of material against blue or green screen, but due to the colours used in the characters and props, it meant that a lot of mate work needed 'cutting out' assistance. It took me a little while longer then the average rotoscoper, but I was new to this world and grateful to all those who 'showed me the way'. A credit to the humour and the love that was shared amongst my peers was receiving a certificate and bottle of wine for having achieved the finished work!\n\nAs I have mentioned, the people that I met whilst working for Ragdoll have remained some of my best'est of friends. I am sure there are many reasons for this, but we like to think that after years of working in the crazy world of colourful craziness, we seem to have all gone mad together, thus 'stayed together'!\n\nAfter many episodes of assisting I was better and faster and learning more and more skills. Painting out cherry pickers or members of the crew who had accidentally found themselves sitting having a cup of tea in the back of the shot.\n\nWith my experience in the show and in offline editing, with my role consisting of assistance in this department also, I found myself editing two episodes of 'In The Night Garden' using software named Final Cut Pro. I worked with the producer to edit the shows and was proud to see my name rolling on the credits as both an editor and compositor.\n\nSome years and various series later at Ragdoll, with roles having progressed from my original post as ‘chief tea maker/runner’ to Post Production assistant, Editor, VFX Artist and finally Online Editor I found myself redundant from the company. I had worked with some wonderfully creative people on shows such as the above mentioned, In The Night Garden as well as, Dip Dap, What makes me happy, Tronji and finally Abney & Teal.\n\nWith 7 years of employment and fantastic experience behind me – the madness and colourful ups and downs had ended.\n\nWith me I took inspiration, experience and a team of fantastic friends. I had been developing a show of my own named ‘Moon Man Dan’. Ragdoll were unable to fund (at the time) their own developing shows, and despite keen interest from Anne Wood of Ragdoll Productions there was little hope given the financial climate that Moon Man Dan would be branded with the Ragdoll stamp."
