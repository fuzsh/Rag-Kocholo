        "text": "The holding company for Teletubbies and In the Night Garden producer Ragdoll has reported a significant increase in losses to almost £4m in its latest financial results and has put its sales joint venture with BBC Worldwide up for sale.\n\nRagdoll Ltd, which owns independent producer Ragdoll, was severely affected by a major slump in the performance of its joint venture with BBC Worldwide, Ragdoll Worldwide, which sells and licences its children's programmes outside the UK. Ragdoll Worldwide is now up for sale, according to documents filed at Companies House earlier this month.\n\nRagdoll Ltd, which owns a 50% stake in Ragdoll Worldwide, reported a pre-tax loss of £3.7m in the year to the 12 months to the end of March 2012.\n\nThis is up from a £492,823 loss posted the previous year. Turnover dropped by 27% year on year from £8.1m to £5.9m.\n\nRagdoll Worldwide reported a pre-tax loss of almost £3.5m in the year to the end of March 2012 – a slump of almost £8m from the profit level it achieved the year before.\n\nIn 2011, the joint venture paid out an interim dividend of £3m to its owners on the way to making a healthy pre-tax profit of £4.4m. Turnover at the joint venture plunged 43% year on year from £11.8m to £6.66m last year.\n\nRagdoll suffered from the loss of its creative executive, Andrew Davenport, said industry sources. Davenport, credited with company founder Anne Wood as co-creator of Teletubbies and In the Night Garden, joined Elisabeth Murdoch's Shine in March 2012, which is understood to have left a gap in the development of new programmes.\n\nWood, Ragdoll founder and creative director, said the company had recently restructured and expected to return to profitability.\n\n\"Ragdoll has recently reorganised its production and distribution business – the joint venture with BBC Worldwide – and this, together with new programme plans will return the company to profitability,\" she said.\n\nWood added that the creative team have started production of a major pre-school animation series, for delivery at the end of 2014, but declined to name the broadcaster. \"We are also working on the final stages of development of an exciting series for older children.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Wood told the Radio Times: \"I'm working on a new pre-schooler show. Because it's stop-frame animation, we are struggling to make ends meet.\" She said that the forthcoming April tax breaks for animation, agreed by the treasury, \"should really help our cash flow\".\n\nIn order to address the ailing Ragdoll Worldwide operation, which took a £3m impairment charge following a review of the value of investment in programme rights, a restructure was undertaken in September.\n\nRagdoll Worldwide hired a new commercial director, Stephen Gould, based at Pinewood, to exploit In the Night Garden, Teletubbies, and two more recent BBC shows Dipdap, and The Adventures of Abney & Teal. He was a brand and licensing consultant at RDF Media Group.\n\nThe company also acquired production and distribution rights \"relating to brands that had previously been exploited by its shareholders\".\n\n\"Whilst it is considered that underlying value remains in back catalogue rights, the timing of when this will be realised is not considered sufficiently certain,\" the company admitted in its Companies House filing.\n\n\"The directors consider this reorganisation, together with two exciting new properties in development and significant cost savings, will better position the company for future growth and a return to profitability,\" the company said.\n\nRagdoll Productions improved its financial position in the year to the end of March 2012.\n\nThe production business reduced its pre-tax loss from £2.7m to £1.9m in 2012. Turnover rose slightly year on year, from £2.25m to £2.59m.\n\nRagdoll Productions has not made a pre-tax profit since being registered at Companies House in 2006, according to annual financial filings.\n\nRagdoll Limited's three directors – Wood, her son Christopher and chief executive Mark Hollingsworth – were paid £479,590 in total in the 12-month period. This is down on the £552,912 paid the previous year.\n\nThe highest paid director, who is unnamed in the filing, was paid £208,577 in 2012 – down from £242,000 in 2011.\n\nStaff numbers at Ragdoll Ltd grew from an average of 47 to 60, with almost £3.2m for salaries, social security and pensions, including the amount paid to directors.\n\nRagdoll was founded by Wood in 1984 and is responsible for shows including Rosie and Jim and Tots TV.\n\nBut it was Teletubbies, launched on the BBC in 1997, that transformed the company's fortunes, generating a reported £200m in revenue and selling 50m merchandising products. In the Night Garden, launched in 2007, was another lucrative global hit.\n\nTo contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
