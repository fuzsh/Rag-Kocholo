        "text": "Joel Stewart is a writer and illustrator of children's books and has published over 20 books since graduating from Falmouth College of Arts in 2000. He is known internationally for his Dexter Bexley picture books, and for illustrations for contemporary authors such as Julia Donaldson, Carol Ann Duffy, and Michael Rosen, and classics by authors such as Hans Christian Andersen and Lewis Carroll. Joel is also known as the creator/director of the hit children's animation series The Adventures of Abney & Teal, which he created, designed, co-wrote, and directed under the guidance of Anne Wood and Ragdoll Productions LTD (creators of Tellytubbies and In the Night Garden). Since completing 52 episodes of Abney & Teal Joel has returned to illustrating and writing for children's books with a renewed passion for lively drawing and for colour. He is also once again working on his own texts for picture books and longer stories. Joel Stewart is one of today's brightest stars in children's books. He won the Macmillan Prize for Illustration in 2000. As well as writing and illustrating wonderfully quirky books, Joel is a keen banjo player and adores comic strips.\n\nThis work was produced as part of The Campaign For Drawing. It is large scale and may have some signs of wear and tear."
