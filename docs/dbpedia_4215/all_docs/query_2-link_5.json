        "text": "The British animation industry, which has spawned favourites from Bagpuss to Bob the Builder, is at risk of terminal decline, leading animators have warned.\n\nAnimation UK, a lobby group backed by prominent studios, has met Chancellor George Osborne to urge him to introduce tax breaks in next month's budget.\n\nThey have told him the industry is at a \"critical tipping point\" and could disappear from the UK within years.\n\nThey say foreign tax breaks and other factors make it cheaper to work abroad.\n\nAnimation UK said their meeting with Mr Osborne was \"positive and productive\".\n\nIt follows a warning from Wallace and Gromit animators Aardman, which said it was considering moving production overseas because it was too expensive in the UK.\n\nIn France, government funds and tax breaks account for almost 20% of production budgets, while Irish tax relief is worth up to 28%. In Canada, tax credits and other public support accounted for 47% of budgets in 2009/10.\n\nA Treasury spokesman said the government recognised \"the important role that all businesses - including those in the animation sector - have in building a strong, sustainable and balanced economy\".\n\nThe government has already taken steps to help businesses by lowering corporation tax and widening measures to stimulate investment, he said.\n\nHere, leading figures of the British animation industry explain why they believe it will be a struggle to ensure future children's favourites are made in the UK.\n\nAsked whether she would be able launch a production company if she was starting out today, she instantly replies: \"Couldn't do it. Wouldn't be viable.\n\n\"When I started, I was one of the first independent companies and we made for Channel 4. You got your full production costs plus a production fee. Now you're lucky to get 15-20% of your production costs and you have to go out and find the other 80%.\"\n\nThe BBC is the only British broadcaster left that spends significant sums on new programmes, she says. \"You've got all of these extra channels but the money for content has gone down.\"\n\nIt is cheaper for TV channels to buy programmes made in countries with tax breaks or in the US, she says.\n\n\"We are then abandoning ourselves to North American culture because in North America it's such a big market, so people can make their money back in their home market and let it come over here cheaper.\"\n\nMs Wood's company Ragdoll tried once to outsource animation to India, where labour costs are lower, but describes that as \"a complete disaster\" because she had less control over the outcome.\n\n\"You lose the confidence and you lose the flair. We have confidence and flair in the UK and that is what's going,\" she said, adding: \"I'm deeply concerned that that heritage and wealth of talent is being eroded to the point of almost disappearing.\"\n\nOverseas tax breaks make it cheaper to make programmes abroad, TV stations are paying less for shows while demanding an increasing share of the profits, and the recession means revenues from toys, books and DVDs are down.\n\n\"If you put those three together then it just doesn't make it work,\" he says.\n\nOf the company's creations, Fifi and the Flowertots, Roary the Racing Car and Raa Raa the Noisy Lion have been animated in Altrincham, Cheshire, with Little Charley Bear made at Pinewood Studios, Buckinghamshire.\n\nThe desire to retain the same styles of animation means there is an \"overriding need\" to keep those shows in the UK, he says.\n\nBut the company's founder Keith Chapman, who created Bob the Builder, has been taking new ideas to producers in Canada.\n\n\"With brand new ones you'd be slightly mad to be doing it in the UK without a tax break or some sort of benefit,\" Mr Haydon says.\n\n\"If we do something that's new, it will be a co-production and it will be an overseas production.\"\n\nIt was shut by its owner ITV in 2009, but the studio was recently resurrected by its founders, the late Mark Hall and Brian Cosgrove along with entrepreneur Francis Fitzpatrick.\n\nSo at a time when the rest of the industry is talking doom and gloom, why are they going back into animation?\n\nMr Fitzpatrick replies: \"Sometimes when things are difficult, the flip side of that is that no one else is starting so there's massive opportunity.\"\n\nTheir new flagship show Pip! will be made in Manchester, he promises. But the UK has \"a big hill to climb\" to compete with countries like Canada, Ireland and France, he says.\n\n\"If you spend Â£1 in Ireland, you will get an immediate tax return of 28p. A French production company can attract up to 70% of the funding [from the government].\n\n\"It's very challenging [in the UK]. Yes it is viable, but it would be so much better if it was on a level playing field.\n\n\"If there was more government support, I think you'd find more Thomas the Tanks, more Peppa Pigs, and the upside of that is massive boosts in revenues to the exchequer.\"\n\nBut in recent years he has turned to writing books because it was too difficult to get animation ideas off the ground.\n\n\"I was trying to get my shows picked up and developed by studios but I was getting a great deal of feedback from producers saying they'd love to work with me, but they can't because they've got a limited budget to work to,\" he says.\n\n\"Rather than looking overseas I've actually concentrated on the publishing side of things. I've been writing novels for the past couple of years and it hasn't been as attritional as developing animations can sometimes be.\n\n\"It is sad when you hear about people going overseas to find work. It's people throughout the industry - jobbing animators, right the way through the production process, to designers and the people who come up with the concepts.\n\n\"I know a couple of people who do a similar role to me, coming up with ideas for shows, who now just work out of LA. They've gone over there and they don't bother knocking on doors in the UK any more.\""
