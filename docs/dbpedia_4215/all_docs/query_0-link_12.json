        "text": "Brand new stop-frame preschool series set to air in 2015\n\nHalifax, NS - 7 October 2014 - UK broadcaster CBeebies has commissioned a brand new 50 x 11’ preschool series from preeminent producer Ragdoll Productions. Twirlywoos, devised and executive produced by Anne Wood with lead creative and writer, Steve Roberts and producer, Chris Wood, combines stop-frame animation and live action sequences set in the real world. Executive producer for CBeebies is Michael Towner. The series is produced in association with DHX Media, which will also handle global distribution, merchandising, brand management and marketing.\n\nContinuing the innovative, nurturing, inspiring, children-led entertainment for which Ragdoll Productions is renowned, Twirlywoos features laugh-out-loud child-centric humour which encourages preschoolers to think for themselves, and gain confidence in their own perceptions of the world. Through the show, young audiences are able to reinforce their understanding as they grow and develop, becoming active and inquisitive within their own lives.\n\nThe Twirlywoos are four small, bird-like characters who are inquisitive, enthusiastic and always looking to learn something new about the world.\n\nEver curious, they seek adventure and fun wherever they go. Whether in the real world or on their big red boat, they love to hide, imitate and be surprised as they discover new things. The show has been developed with a commitment to watching how children interact and develop, and each episode creates spaces for preschoolers to make their own connections, which aids their learning.\n\nController of CBeebies, Kay Benbow, says: “I am delighted to be working with Ragdoll again. It’s been such a positive collaboration and Ragdoll have managed to develop a show that is both brilliantly clever and funny and which has a strong educational element underpinning it. It’s a great new offering for our younger viewers while at the same time the charming nature of Twirlywoos will undoubtedly appeal to all age groups.”\n\nAnne Wood, Founder and Creative Director of Ragdoll Productions, says: “Television that makes children smile is so valuable and I’m proud to be part of CBeebies tradition of wonderful children’s television, contributing towards making children and even some parents, smile. It is particularly rewarding to be working with Steve Roberts. Twirlywoos is our second collaboration after the award-winning Dipdap, and has all the same sense of fun.”\n\nSteven DeNure, President and COO of DHX Media said: “Anne and her team at Ragdoll have created a series that truly puts child-centric development at its centre – it’s also laugh-out-loud funny with a host of standout characters drawing on real-life situations and discoveries. Twirlywoos has an easy charm and visual simplicity but is also multi-layered with each element carefully considered to enhance preschool development. We are confident that it will be a tremendous success.”\n\nFor more information, please contact:\n\nAimee Norman at DDA Blueprint PR for DHX Media +44 (0) 20 8985 4708 or aimee@ddablueprint.com\n\nJo Clayton at CBeebies +44 (0) 7809 597 825 or jo.clayton@bbc.co.uk\n\nMary Hagger at HaggerPR for Ragdoll Productions +44 (0) 77140 87848 or mary@haggerpr.com\n\nAbout CBeebiesCBeebies is dedicated to delighting and surprising its pre-school audience and it remains the UK's most watched and most loved channel for the under-sixes.
