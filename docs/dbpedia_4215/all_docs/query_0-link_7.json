        "text": "Halifax, NS – 10 March 2016 – DHX Media (“DHX” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: DHXM; TSX: DHX.A, DHX.B), a global leader in kids and family entertainment content, and preeminent producer Ragdoll Productions, announce that UK broadcaster CBeebies has commissioned 25 x 11’ new episodes of the preschool series Twirlywoos, which combines stop-frame animation and live action sequences set in the real world.\n\nTwirlywoos is devised and executive produced by Anne Wood with lead creative and writer, Steve Roberts and producer, Chris Wood. Executive producer for CBeebies is Michael Towner. The series is produced in association with DHX Media, which also handles global distribution, merchandising, brand management and marketing.\n\nSteven DeNure, President and COO of DHX Media, said: “The response of preschool children and their parents to this series has been fantastic – Anne Wood and her team at Ragdoll have created another standout show that puts children’s development front and center and is hugely funny and charming to boot. We are very happy to be part of this superb, returning brand.”\n\nAnne Wood, Founder and Creative Director of Ragdoll Productions, added: “Ragdoll is delighted that Twirlywoos makes children laugh as they learn.”\n\nContinuing the innovative, nurturing, inspiring, children-led entertainment for which Ragdoll Productions is renowned, Twirlywoos features laugh-out-loud child-centric humour which encourages preschoolers to think for themselves, and gain confidence in their own perceptions of the world. Through the show, young audiences are able to reinforce their understanding as they grow and develop, becoming active and inquisitive within their own lives.\n\nThe Twirlywoos are four small, bird-like characters who are inquisitive, enthusiastic and always looking to learn something new about the world.\n\nEver curious, they seek adventure and fun wherever they go. Whether in the real world or on their big red boat, they love to hide, imitate and be surprised as they discover new things. The show has been developed with a commitment to watching how children interact and develop, and each episode creates spaces for preschoolers to make their own connections, which aids their learning.\n\nFor more information, please contact:\n\nTrade Media: Aimee Norman at DDA Blueprint PR\n\naimee@ddablueprint.com\n\n+44 (0) 20 8985 4708\n\nFinancial Media: Shaun Smith – Director, Corporate Communications, DHX Media Ltd.\n\nshaun.smith@dhxmedia.com\n\n+1 416-977-7230\n\nInvestor Relations: Nancy Chan-Palmateer – Director, Investor Relations, DHX Media Ltd.\n\nnancy.chanpalmateer@dhxmedia.com\n\n+1 416-977-7358\n\nAbout DHX Media\n\nDHX Media Ltd.
