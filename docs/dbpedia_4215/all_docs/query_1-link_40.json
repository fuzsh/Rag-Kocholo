They are a mischievous lot, always looking for something they can take, especially if it is mummy's glasses, daddy's socks, or even grandpa's wig! But don't worry, here come the tiny cops! They've polished their boots, shined their badges, and now they're ready for action! Which is a good thing, because the tiny robbers are after something really BIG this time!
