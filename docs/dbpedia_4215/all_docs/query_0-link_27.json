His pictures look as fresh as Andersen's tales must have been to their first listeners.\" The Times Educational Supplement\n\n\"This tale of a lost bear in wintry city does what the best picturebooks do: it tells the story through the pictures as much as the words\" Nicolette Jones, Sunday Times\n\nLatest Publications:\n\nPeggy and Stu Investigate: Book 1 (Tangletree Mysteries)\n\nA comic/graphic novel series for 5+ following the adventures of Peggy the dog, who – when she enters Tangletree Woods on her walk every day – takes up her position as investigator of mysteries.\n\nBeyond the park and deep in the woods is a world of surprises.
