He classifies the sounds we hear into geophony (non-living sounds of the Earth produced by wind, water, etc.); biophony (the sounds of life); and anthrophony (the sounds produced by human technology).\n\nHe has recorded soundscapes from all over the world and maintains a growing archive of habitat and species-specific acoustic recordings. He has collected and published these sounds in a number of CDs. He is the author of several papers on the niche hypothesis, an argument that in order to be heard, each animal in a soundscape occupies an acoustic niche characterized by a unique combination of frequency, time and timbre.\n\nKrause began his professional career as a backup studio guitarist for early Motown sessions in the late 50s while attending the University of Michigan. After graduation he joined the folk group, The Weavers, occupying the Pete Seeger slot where, with other members, introduced the song, Guantanamera, at their legendary Carnegie Hall concert in 1963. When the Weavers disbanded the following year, Bernie, and his late music partner, Paul Beaver, helped launch the Moog synthesizer in the pop music and film media on the West Coast and the UK. His work is featured on many albums of that era, including those of the George Harrison, Mick Jagger, and Van Morrison, not to mention Beaver & Krause’s own charted recordings. Bernie’s contributions can be heard on over 135 major feature films like Apocalypse Now, Cast Away, and Rosemary’s Baby.\n\nIn 1968, in parallel with his music production efforts, he began his second career as a founder of the field of Soundscape Ecology – recording, studying, and archiving the marine and terrestrial soundscapes of remaining wild habitats worldwide. While amassing one of the most significant collections of natural soundscape recordings in private hands, Bernie has also been engaged in the creation of dozens of natural sound albums representing threatened habitats, and designs sound sculptures for museums, and other public spaces worldwide. Committed to the creation of new language to describe the numerous fields informed by soundscapes, he is the author of The Great Animal Orchestra: Finding the Origins of Music in the World’s Wild Places, the subject of this program. www.wildmusic.org\n\nMARK MILTON was born in Windsor (UK) in 1962, moved to Switzerland in 1970 and has been living there since. He is married and has two sons, born in 1991 and 1994. His first work was as a ski teacher at the age of 16 but his professional career started in 1980. At first Mark specialised in communication and marketing, responding to his interest in the dynamic of human relations. In 1992, he took part in a training programme on “listening skills” given by the local suicide prevention hotline to become a volunteer for them, which he continued to do for 8 years. In 1994 he become director of the emotional support centre, La Main Tendue, (Samaritans in the UK) in Lausanne, Switzerland, until 2004.\n\nIn 2001 he was elected President of IFOTES (International Federation Of Telephone Emergency Services), which represents 30,000 volunteers in more than 30 countries, a position he held for 10 years, working with the World Health Organisation (WHO) to introduce the recognition of “Emotional Heath” in 2007.\n\nIn 2002, Mark created the Swiss Foundation, Education 4 Peace (www.e4p.org). Its vision is a world in which children leave school not only enriched with educational knowledge and knowhow, but also with self-knowledge. His aim is that all children should be able to learn the skill of listening, to deal with frustrations and conflicts. Since 2008, Mark has been involved in sports, which has shown be a perfect field to introduce emotions and self-awareness in education.\n\nDuring the second half of 2012 the world of arts proved to be a field just as promising, as music and films are at the core of young people’s lives, with sound as its essence.\n\nBesides his activities for the E4P Foundation, Mark is an advisor and a mentor in self-leadership and governance, for individuals and organisations.\n\nJOE MORAN is a choreographer and dancer creating bold, daring and distinctive new works that navigate the meeting points between full-bodied dancing and critical thought. A semi-finalist for The Place Prize 2012, his work has been presented in theatres, galleries and public spaces in the UK and internationally. As a dancer, Joe has worked with many distinguished choreographers including Deborah Hay (USA), Siobhan Davies (UK), Christopher House (Toronto Dance Theatre) and Pontus Pettersson (Sweden). He was a dancer with Gaby Agis & Company (UK), 2001-05. Joe is Artistic Director of Dance Art Foundation, which he founded in 2000 and through which his performance and curatorial work is produced in collaboration with other agencies.\n\nJoe’s work is informed by his background in improvisation and experimentation that he marries with a fascination with formal choreographic composition and conceptually driven dance. These influences meet in his work through an abiding interest in the fertile tension between the liberated, full-bodied individuality of dancers and the constraints of formal composition.\n\nJoe’s work is also concerned with curation as a choreographic endeavor and he is passionate about knowledge and discourses fostered by dance and its dialogue with other disciplines. He pursues these interests through the curation of other artists’ works in counterpoint to his own, collaborations in visual art, music and film, and leading art programmes in health and in business.\n\nJoe is currently touring Forward, three dances for stage and gallery, choreographing for London Fashion Week and leading a three-year programme with investment bankers at the Royal Opera House. He is developing Arrangement, a bold, all-male ensemble work for touring and will create a new work for EDge, the postgraduate touring company at London Contemporary Dance School, in 2013/14. www.danceartfoundation.com, www.joemorandance.com, @joemorandance\n\nPIERS PLOWRIGHT was born in London in 1937 and spent a lot of his childhood listening to the radio and going to the nearby Everyman Cinema, where he saw the classics of European, American and Asian cinema.

Recent research fellowships at University College Dublin and Trinity College Dublin enabled her to complete her second monograph Sounding the Gallery: Video and the Rise of Art-Music (OUP, 2013), in which she argues that video is as much a musical genre as it is a visual one. Holly is currently investigating the interactions between sound and art in the galleries of San Francisco as part of a larger project on video intermediality. As a performer, Holly has played guitar in the backing band for RTE’s Late Late Show, and in the Liverpool Guitar Orchestra; and as a flautist she frequently performs with the Liverpool Mozart Orchestra.\n\nDAVID SONNENSCHEIN is a writer, producer, director, sound designer and games developer.
