        "text": "It took a lot of R&D to create the unusual armatures and soft, fabric-covered bodies for the deceptively simple Twirlywoo characters &dash; they have big round bodies on pencil-thin legs, but they need to be lightweight, capable of energetic and balletic movement and also have an element of squashiness when they sit down.\n\nThe four Twirlywoos were filmed on location and animated in our stop motion studio. The animated puppets have to convincingly interact with the live action footage, and some props from the live action shoots (including a playground roundabout!) were transported to our studio to ensure continuity. We used a lot of green screen set-ups and rigs, and the fantastic team at Nvizible Visual Effects seamlessly blended the animation with the live action.\n\nTwirlywoos is produced by Ragdoll Productions\n\nin association with DHX Media. The producer is Chris Wood, lead creative Steve Roberts and the executive producers are Anne Wood for Ragdoll and Michael Towner for CBeebies.\n\nTWIRLYWOOS and all related titles, logos and characters are trademarks of DHX Worldwide Limited.\n\nÂ© 2015 Ragdoll Productions Limited/DHX Worldwide Limited.
