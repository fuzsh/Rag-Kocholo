        "text": "I worked in-house at Ragdoll Productions from 2008-2011 and was Creative Producer, Animation Performance Director and Head Writer on The Adventures of Abney and Teal, broadcast by CBeebies, 2011. I worked closely with director Joel Stewart to develop the world, characters and tone of voice, and oversaw the writing of 52 episodes.\n\nI loved writing these characters and this world, the landscape is based on Victoria Park in London, where the directors and I used to meet to come up with ideas. We were inspired by Yuri Norstein's Hedgehog in the Fog, the 2D multi-plane animated series of Tove Jansson's, The Moomins. It was a joy to work with Joel Stewart, Steve Roberts and Chris and Anne Wood. 'The Moon' episode is inspired by Italo Calvino, and a snowy moment in 'Snow Neep' was inspired by James Joyce's Dubliners. 'Spots' was inspired by a bush covered in ladybirds, that my twin nephews enjoyed :) - my favourite episodes are 'Frogs', 'The Camera' and 'Bop's Babies'\n\nI pitched, developed and scripted the following episodes:\n\nThe Porridge Party\n\nThe Poc Pocs' Holiday\n\nThe Storm\n\nStuck\n\nFirefly Lullaby\n\nThe Radio\n\nNeep's Birthday\n\nAbney Finds A Hole\n\nFaraway Island\n\nBop's Best Bubble\n\nThe Slide\n\nThe Moon\n\nThe Snow Neep\n\nThe Perfect Tree\n\nThe Artwork\n\nThe Very Cold Day\n\nThe Visit\n\nThe Enormous Sneeze\n\nThe Handbag\n\nThe Mysterious Mist\n\nThe Very Hot Day\n\nThe Enormous Cabbage\n\nThe Summerhouse\n\nBop's Babies\n\nSleep Digging\n\nThe Porridge Tower\n\nAbney's Aquarium\n\nShadows\n\nThe Caf√©\n\nAbney's Precious Things\n\nFrogs\n\nThe Camera\n\nSpring Cleaning\n\nSpots\n\nI was co-writer the following episodes:"
