It is located in Bloxham, Oxfordshire, and has produced a number of children's programmes, most notably Pob's Programme, Teletubbies, Rosie and Jim, Brum, Boohbah, Tots TV, and In the Night Garden..., most of which are now owned by WildBrain.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nRagdoll Productions was founded on 26 July 1984 by Anne Wood, who produced shows for the ITV network. It was incorporated as Ragdoll Productions (U.K.) Limited in April 1985 and was originally based in Birmingham.[4] The company's first show, Pob's Programme, premiered on Channel 4 later that year. The company was later commissioned by Central Independent Television to produce Playbox, which demonstrated the ability for the company to produce their own characters. In 1989, The Magic Mirror and BOOM! marked the company's debut in the animation and live-action markets.[5] The company at first produced puppet-based programmes, and their mascot was originally a female rag doll that was based on one that belonged to Wood's daughter.\n\nIn 1992, the company moved their operations to Stratford-upon-Avon and opened up The Ragdoll Shop.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Ragdoll expanded operations to the United States, and signed a deal with The Itsy Bitsy Entertainment Company to sell their programmes in the market.\n\nIn 2000, Ragdoll dropped their rag doll mascot for a more simplistic logo designed by Lambie-Nairn, with the company also adopting a new name of Ragdoll Limited by that point. During that time, the company started to move away from puppet-based shows (which started with Teletubbies in 1997), by making animated cartoons. Ragdoll still produced live-action shows, but would use costumes and animatronics instead of puppets.\n\nIn October 2001, Ragdoll parted ways with Itsy Bitsy following a failure to reach an agreement with the company's majority owner, the Handleman Group. Ragdoll then started to sell their programmes on their own from then-on, forming Ragdoll USA.[6]\n\nIn January 2002, Teletubbies: Everywhere, a spin-off of Teletubbies, was announced to air on CBeebies within its launch window.[7] On 14 June, a new series titled Boohbah was announced and was pre-sold to CITV and GMTV for a 2003 delivery.[8] The show later saw an international roll-out.\n\nAt MIPTV 2005, Ragdoll announced a new series titled Blurrfect and that CITV had acquired broadcasting rights for an autumn 2005 delivery.[9] By September 2005, the series was renamed Blips, and soon premiered on 29 September 2005 as part of the CITV's autumn schedule.[10][11] On 13 October, Ragdoll unrevealed two new series that were pre-sold to the BBC: In the Night Garden... and Tronji, for a 2007 delivery.[12] In October 2005, Ragdoll subsidiary The Ragdoll Foundation announced that Five's Milkshake! block had commissioned a series of six short films titled What Makes Me Happy?, which would air daily from 19 December.[13]\n\nIn September 2006, Ragdoll formed a joint venture with BBC Worldwide called Ragdoll Worldwide, to sell and license the company's programmes outside of the UK and North America. In the Night Garden... and Tronji would be the first two programmes created as part of the venture, while existing programmes were handled by BBC Worldwide, which managed the international broadcast sales and the UK and international licensing of all Ragdoll properties (including Blips, Boohbah, Brum, Tots TV, Rosie and Jim, and Open a Door), with Ragdoll retaining all British broadcast rights. A new subsidiary, Ragdoll USA Inc., part of the new joint venture, would manage Ragdoll's distribution in North America.[14]\n\nIn January 2013, Ragdoll opted to end their agreement with BBC Worldwide and put up Ragdoll Worldwide for sale.[15] On 16 September, Canadian studio DHX Media (currently named WildBrain) purchased the venture from both companies for £17.4 million (or USD$24 million)[16] The deal included the rights to most of Ragdoll's programming produced from 1990 to 2012. The company also changed to its current name of Ragdoll Productions Limited, with \"Productions\" added back to the name after 13 years.\n\nIn 2015, Ragdoll produced the live-action/stop-motion series Twirlywoos with DHX, making it the first and only co-production between the companies.\n\nIn 2018, the company co-produced a short film with Disney UK for the Hope Works initiative, titled What Shall We Do With The Angry Monster?.[17]\n\nIn 2021, Ragdoll formed a deal with British distribution company Cake Entertainment for them to distribute their new series, B.O.T. and the Beasties, for CBeebies. On 29 March, the company was relocated to Shenington, with Anne Wood retiring from the company on 14 December, and leaving her son Christopher as director of the studio.\n\nOn 13 June 2024, Ragdoll would once again move their operations, this time to Bloxham, another small town in Oxfordshire.\n\nPre-Ragdoll productions\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following are some of productions made by Anne Wood before Ragdoll was founded, accompanied by a brief description and vital statistics:\n\nPuzzle Party - first broadcast in 1977. Hosted by Gyles Brandreth and featuring characters Gnigel and Gnu, the show was one of Anne Wood's earliest TV shows for the BBC.\n\nThe Book Tower - first broadcast in 1979, hosted by Tom Baker and Stephen Moore.\n\nRagdolly Anna - first broadcast in 1982, based on the children's books by Jean Kenward.\n\nRoland Rat - first broadcast in 1983.\n\nProductions\n\n[edit]\n\nRagdoll's programmes produced between 1990 and 2017 (excluding Pob's Programme, BOOM! and Storytime) are currently owned by WildBrain (formerly known as DHX Media).\n\nRagdoll Productions\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Year(s) Network Notes/Sources Pob's Programme 1985–1990 Channel 4 Currently owned by Channel Four Television Corporation Playbox 1987–1992 ITV (Central) Currently owned by ITV Studios The Magic Mirror 1989 ITV Co-production for The Kellogg Company\n\nRagdoll's first animated production BOOM! 1990–1991 Channel 4 Ragdoll's first non-puppet live-action production\n\nCurrently owned by Channel Four Television Corporation Rosie and Jim 1990-2000 ITV (Central) Oldest Ragdoll series to be owned by WildBrain Brum 1991, 1994\n\n2001–2002 BBC One (Children's BBC/CBBC)\n\nCBeebies Tots TV 1993–1998 ITV (Central) Co-produced with Carlton Television in later seasons\n\nRights co-owned with ITV Studios Open a Door 1994–2003 BBC Two (Children's BBC/CBBC)\n\nCBeebies An international short film series co-produced with other companies.

The store first opened in 1992, and traded until 2005, because of expansion limits and failure to find a new larger venue.[18]\n\nThe building that formerly housed the shop is now a optometrist's practice named Dr. CP Grey's. The picture of Rosie and Jim waving can still be seen in the black window at the top of the building.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
