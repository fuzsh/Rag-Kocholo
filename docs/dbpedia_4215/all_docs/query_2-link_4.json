Named after Wood's daughter's favorite toy ragdoll, Jemima, Ragdoll Productions is mostly known for creating shows like Teletubbies, Pob's Progamme, Rosie and Jim, Brum, Tots TV, etc. before its inception in the mid-1980s, Wood made shows like Ragdolly Anna and Rub-A-Tub-Dub Before creating Ragdoll and making the first programme by the company, Pob's Programme. Ragdoll also had a small store based on Wood's works which opened in 1992 but closed in 2005 due to expansion limits. In 2006, Ragdoll and BBC Worldwide formed a joint venture called Ragdoll Worldwide, which then held the rights to all Ragdoll programming from Ragdoll themselves, this joint venture was sold to DHX Media in September 2013, causing the rights to the TV shows that Ragdoll created (except Pob's Programme) to be acquired and picked up by DHX, meaning the shows they produced are no longer produced under the \"Ragdoll\" name. Despite this, Ragdoll Productions themselves are still active to this very day, now producing their latest programme, Twirlywoos, in co-production with DHX.\n\n1st Logo\n\n(October 1985-1995)\n\nNicknames: \"The Ragdoll\"\n\nLogo: We see a black and white Raggedy Ann/Andy-like doll. The ragdoll has stringy hair, button eyes, a triangle nose, a small smile, is wearing a checkered short-sleeve shirt, wears long pants with the same checkered pattern, and is holding a candle above its head with a stylized old gold sun with 12 points behind the doll (it looks like the 1981 Columbia Pictures print logo).\n\nTrivia:\n\nThis logo was designed by Malcolm Bird, who illustrated some Pob-related magazines.\n\nThe Ragdoll Shop (closed in 2005) used this logo on a hanging sign from its opening in 1992 until 1994.\n\nVariants:\n\nOn Pob's Programme, The logo is made of fabric. The ragdoll is a lot smaller and is between between the words \" A Ragdoll (UK)\" and \"Production\" stacked on top of the words \"for\" and \"Channel Four\" (This show was produced for Channel 4 UK). \"Channel Four\" is under the word \"for\" and under that is a Channel Four copyright date. Pob appears over the logo, reading a Pob News magazine and to the left of him is a fabric version of the ragdoll shown in the logo, with carrot orange stringy hair, aredcheckered shirt, and a shamrock greencandle. A female narrator reminds viewers how to send cash or stamps to Pob, while Pob himself chatters over the narration and nudges the ragdoll once. The P.O. box address \"P.O. Box 507, Edgbaston, Birmingham, B15 3AL\" fades in at the bottom of the screen, in a handwritten font in pastel pink. Pob proceeds to \"blow\" out the ragdoll's candle, causing everything to go dark.\n\nOn Playbox, the doll is next to text saying \"A Ragdoll (U.K.) Production for Central\".Below the text and logo is a copyright date for Central Independent Television.\n\nOn the ultra-short lived series The Magic Mirror, the entire logo is in-credit. After the credits finishing scrolling only having the \"A Ragdoll (UK) Production\" disclaimer and Kellogg Company copyright date, the Ragdoll fades onto the titular item, like it's being reflected.\n\nOn Brum, all the text is in Dom Casual, and just simply says \"A Ragdoll Production\" with the doll between the \"A Ragdoll\" and \"Production\". Below that is a Ragdoll Productions copyright.\n\nAt the end of 1993-1994 episodes of Tots TV, the background is a black/dark teal gradient, and the illustration of the ragdoll, the text, and the copyright notice are stacked, and \"A Ragdoll Production for Central\" in Futura. (U.K.) is omitted from the text.\n\nIn 1993, a new print logo was created (originally the print logo was just the doll), featuring the doll on a white background in a rectangle with a white banner saying \"Ragdoll\" in red text on the bottom. It lasted until 1995.\n\nFX/SFX: None. For the Pob variant, Pob blowing out the toy ragdoll's candle, which is actually in live-action. For The Magic Mirror, the Ragdoll fading onto the titular mirror.\n\nMusic/Sounds: None usually, but on Brum, an ascending synthesized piano jingle is played. On Tots TV, the last note of the ending theme plays once the logo appears. For The Magic Mirror, just the ending theme to the show.\n\nAvailability: Extremely rare. Seen on Pob's Programme, the ultra-short lived series The Magic Mirror, Playbox, Tots TV (BBC airings plastered this with the 5th logo), and Brum (reruns have it plastered with the 4th logo); some Brum and Tots TV VHS tapes have the logo removed. The company also produced the 5th and 6th series of the 1980’s-1990’s BBC educational programme Storytime, but this logo doesn’t appear on any of the episodes, just an in-credit notice. It’s unknown if this logo appears on Boom! and the first series of Open a Door.\n\nEditor's Note: This logo is well remembered within fans of the shows this company produced.\n\n2nd Logo (Rosie and Jim Custom Logo)\n\n(September 3, 1990-May 24, 1996)\n\nNicknames:\n\nSeries 1 & 2 Variants: \"The Ragdoll II\", \"The Rosie and Jim Logo\"\n\nSeries 3 Variants: \"The Ragdoll II Returns\"\n\nSeries 4 Variants: The Friendly Ragdoll's Cameo\n\nLogo: On a red background, we see the ragdoll (colorized with brown hair) in checkered black and white overalls obscured inside a porthole. The ragdoll is still holding the candle over her, with a \"yellow sun\" behind it. Below the porthole is a curved banner with red text saying \"A Ragdoll Production for Central\" and a copyright date for Central Independent Television.\n\nVariants:\n\nOn Rosie & Jim Series 2, the logo is smaller, and the copyright date is in a different font.\n\nOn 2 direct-to-video releases titled Learn to Read and Write with Rosie & Jim, the \"A Ragdoll Production for Central\" part is removed, and the Central copyright date is replaced with a Ragdoll Productions copyright date.\n\nOn Rosie & Jim Series 3, the doll was redrawn in checkered red/white overalls, and the sun has more points. The doll still looks identical though. This variant also has the sun wobbling if you look carefully.\n\nOn Rosie & Jim Series 4, the logo instead has the doll from the fourth logo. The copyright text can ether be yellow or white.\n\nFX/SFX:\n\nOn Series 1, it's the logo closing like a book cover, so it appears that the logo is on the back of a book.\n\nOn Series 2, it's a page turning transition.\n\nOn Learn to Read and Write with Rosie & Jim, it's the logo and text fading in and out.\n\nOn Series 3, the sun wobbles, if one looks carefully.\n\nOn Series 4, the logo is completely still.\n\nMusic/Sounds:\n\nOn Series 1 & 2, it's the end theme.\n\nOnLearn to Read and Write with Rosie and Jim, the 1st logo's own music plays, albeit somber and softer.\n\nOn Series 3 & 4, the next logo's music plays, but sped up, although one instance had the normal music playing.\n\nAvailability: Extremely rare. It only appeared on Seasons 1-4 of Rosie and Jim and is preserved on VHS and DVD, as well as re-runs of those seasons. The 1992 variant is even rarer, and only appeared on 2 direct-to-video tapes called Learn to Read and Write with Rosie and Jim, both of which are out of print and are fairly difficult to find.\n\nEditor's Note: It's a favorite within Rosie & Jim fans.\n\n3rd Logo\n\n(October 6-December 22, 1994)\n\nNicknames: \"The Ragdoll III\", \"Lying Ragdoll\"\n\nLogo: On a black background, we see the ragdoll (colorized with orange hair) in checkered red/white overalls lying over the word \"Ragdoll\" in a bold, yellow font. The ragdoll is still holding the candle over him, with a \"yellow sun\" behind it. The sun \"wobbles\" for a second or two. \"works for children\" is seen in a small white font, below \"doll\". Below the logo is \"A Ragdoll Production\", in the same white font, but bigger. Below that is a copyright date.\n\nFX/SFX: The wobbling sun.\n\nMusic/Sounds: A re-arrangement of the first jingle, but played on a harp rather than a synth-piano, and in a different key.\n\nAvailability: Extremely rare. Was only seen on original screenings and VHS tapes of the second series of Brum. It has since been plastered with the next logo on reruns.\n\nEditor's Note: A rarity indeed, considering this only appeared on the second series ofBrum.\n\n4th Logo\n\n(1995-2002)\n\nMain Logos\n\nPlaster Variants\n\nTeletubbies Versions\n\nNicknames: \"The Ragdoll IV\", \"The Friendly Ragdoll\", \"The Teletubbies Logo\"\n\nLogo: We see the same ragdoll from before, only smaller and colorized in checkered teal (or blue)/white overalls and red hair, isn't holding a candle (but we see the \"yellow sun\" anyway), inside a door-shaped frame, a la Columbia Pictures' '80s print logo. Under the ragdoll, the red word \"Ragdoll\" is seen. At the bottom of the screen is copyright info. This is typically presented against a teal blue gradient background.\n\nVariants:\n\nSometimes, it had \"A Ragdoll Production\" (in red), with two yellow squares, under the word \"Ragdoll\". Other times, the slogan \"works for children\" appears below.\n\nOn an advert for The Ragdoll Shop (a shop where you could buy things based on the shows and play around, not open anymore) an early prototype version of this logo is shown against a green gradient background, and the doll's overalls are red instead of blue and have a leg sticking out.\n\nOn a print ad for The Ragdoll Shop, the doll is holding a telephone, is more detailed and the phone is on top of the hotline for The Ragdoll Shop.\n\nOn some direct-to-video releases using the characters from Tots TV (which were aptly named Tots Videos), the logo is much bigger.\n\nOn the 1995 season of Tots TV, the logo is shared with the Carlton UK Productions Logo.\n\nOn Teletubbies, under the Ragdoll logo, the BBC logo is underneath. \"A Ragdoll Production\" is seen underneath as usual. The background is black. On the Spanish version, the logo is shared with the logos for BBC, Discovery Kids, and The Itsy Bitsy Entertainment Company.\n\nOn early Teletubbies episodes, the 1988-1997 BBC logo is seen below the logo.\n\nAn version of the above variant lacks the BBC text and copyright.\n\nOn the 1998 VHS Rosie and Jim: Spring Cleaning, we see the words \"A Ragdoll Production for ITV\", copyright info is seen underneath.\n\nOn PBS airings of Teletubbies, the words \"A Ragdoll/BBC Production for PBS in association with The itsy bitsy Entertainment Co.\" is under the logo.\n\nOn the Tots TV VHS Flying High and other stories, the 1993 Tots TV variant logo is used, but this logo covers up the 1984-1994 Ragdoll. Talk about laziness!\n\nAn in-credit version appeared on the PC version of Play With The Teletubbies. On the PlayStation version of said title, the background is solid teal.\n\nOn reruns of Brum, the logo appears to be slightly darker.\n\nFX/SFX: None.\n\nMusic/Sounds: The end theme to the show mainly, but on some shows, such as reruns of Brum, the same music from the last logo is used (mainly the sped up version) or silence.\n\nMusic/Sounds Variants:\n\nOn Tots Video: Tilly, Tom and Tiny's Fun With French, we hear the last note of the theme and then the sped-up music.\n\nOn Tots Video: Tilly, Tom and Tiny's ABC's, the music is re-arranged in a music box style.\n\nAvailability: Uncommon. Seen on reruns of 1991-1994 episodes of Brum, 1995-1998 episodes of Tots TV (and plastered on earlier episodes), the final seasons of Rosie and Jim (The Neil Brewer Era) and on 1997-2000 episodes of Teletubbies. It also appears on the PS1 game Play with the Teletubbies, and it also appears on the PC version of the same game, but only in the end credits. The red dress variant only appeared on an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9_i9ubIEnA\" target=\"_self\">ad</a> for the Ragdoll shop, which appears on 1995 tapes of Tots TV and Rosie and Jim distributed by VCI (it may appear on Brum VHS tapes, too). The eighth variant was only seen on a 2000 Flemish VHS release of Teletubbies in de Sneeuw (Teletubbies in the Snow).\n\nEditor's Note: The doll has a more friendlier look to itself, and once again is a favorite.\n\nNicknames: \"The Drawing Smile\", \"The Ragdoll V\", \"The Hair and Face\", \"Another Teletubbies Logo\"\n\nLogo: On a yellow background, we see the black word \"Ragdoll\" and a red doodle of a ragdoll's head with eyes, but no mouth. A smile is drawn below the eyes. Copyright info is on the bottom of the screen.\n\nTrivia: This logo was made by Lambie-Nairn.\n\nVariants:\n\nThere is a longer version, in which the logo's hair, eyes and mouth are drawn in as the camera shows shots of the logo forming. This appeared mainly on VHS and DVD releases of Ragdoll shows, but has appeared on Non-UK prints of Twirlywoos before the DHX Media logo.\n\nOn Teletubbies, below is \"for\" and the BBC logo between the Ragdoll logo and the copyright info. From mid-late 2000, it was seen on a yellow-orange background. From late 2000-early 2001, it was seen on a black background, with a yellow-orange box for the Ragdoll logo.\n\nIn the Night Garden uses a logo that is the same as the previous one, but with \"for BBC\" and the BBC logo below. Sometimes, the CBeebies logo would be used instead.\n\nThe Ragdoll Shop used this logo on the hanging sign from 2000 until its closure in 2005.\n\nOn Boohbah, the logo is still with the words \"A Ragdoll Production in association with GMTV\" on the bottom. On some VHS or DVD releases, the long version (described below) plays afterward.\n\nThe variant used on Twirlywoos has the logo on the left, next to the DHX Media logo and the Cbeebies logo appears on the top. The text \"A Ragdoll production for BBC\" appears on the top of the Cbeebies logo, and the text \"produced in association with DHX Media\" appears on the bottom of the Ragdoll and DHX Media logos, below that is the copyright date, all on an ocean background.\n\nOn 2004 re-runs of Teletubbies, the logo is in white.\n\nFX/SFX: The smile drawing, or none at all.\n\nMusic/Sounds: The end theme of the show, or none.\n\nMusic/Sounds Variants:\n\nThe animated variant has a drawing sound, followed by various squeaky party blower-like sounds.\n\nOn some episodes of Brum and Teletubbies, the last sound from the long version plays over the standard variant.\n\nTeletubbies Everywhere used a pan-drop sound.\n\nOn Rosie & Jim repeats on CITV from Early 2000's, the previous logo's music was used.\n\nAvailability: Common. Seen on post-2000 episodes of Teletubbies, its spin-off Teletubbies Everywhere, BBC airings of Tots TV, Boohbah, In the Night Garden, seasons 3-4 of Brum, DipDap, The Adventures of Abney and Teal and Twirlywoos. It also plastered the previous logo on early 2000's CITV airings of Rosie & Jim.\n\nEditor's Note: The sounds are quite annoying, but as with the other logos, it's still a favorite."
