        "text": "English children's television producer\n\nThis article is about the children’s television producer. For the mezzo-soprano and opera administrator, see Anne Wood (singer). For those of a similar name, see Ann Wood (disambiguation).\n\nAnne Wood, CBE (born 18 December 1937) is an English children's television producer, responsible for creating shows such as Teletubbies with Andrew Davenport. She is also the creator of Tots TV and Rosie and Jim. She was a recipient of the Eleanor Farjeon Award.\n\nEarly years\n\n[edit]\n\nShe was born in Spennymoor, County Durham, England, and grew up in Tudhoe Colliery, a small coal-mining village nearby.[1]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nShe qualified as a secondary school teacher through the Bingley Training College in Yorkshire and took up her first teaching post back home in Spennymoor. She married Barrie Wood in 1959 and moved to Surbiton in Surrey where she took up a teaching role at Hollyfield Road Secondary School.\n\nThis was the era of the first children's paperback book and Anne became an early pioneer of a children's paperback book club scheme for schools set up by Scholastic Publications. She retired from teaching on the birth of her daughter and was taken on by Scholastic as editor of their Children's Book Club.\n\nChildren’s books\n\n[edit]\n\nWhen the Wood family moved to Byfleet in Surrey, she expanded her interest in how books and children's development could be brought together. In 1965, she founded and edited a quarterly magazine Books for Your Children, a publication aimed at parents, teachers, and librarians and fully supported by children's publishers. Initially the UK Arts Council supported the magazine with a small financial grant. As a further promotion of children's books, in 1969, Wood set up the Federation of Children's Book Groups, an organisation still in existence today. Also, in 1969, in recognition of her contribution to the promotion of children's books, Wood was awarded the Eleanor Farjeon Award.[1]\n\nTelevision producer\n\n[edit]\n\nTyne Tees Television for ITV 1977 Puzzle Party hosted by Gyles Brandreth and featuring Gnigel the Gnu\n\nYorkshire Television for ITV 1979 – 1983 Five series of The Book Tower, a programme aimed at stimulating children's interest in books.

In April 1983, introduced Roland Rat, a character created by David Claridge in The Spectacular Shedvision Show. The series is generally regarded as the saviour of the ailing breakfast television service. Roland took the audience from 100,000 to 1.8 million. Wood produced six further series, Rat on the Road (1983), Roland's Winter Wonderland (1983), filmed in Switzerland, Roland Goes East (1984), filmed in Hong Kong, Rat on the Road II (1984), Operation Fog I (1984), and Roland’s Countdown to Christmas (1984). Concurrent with Roland Rat, Wood produced a Sunday morning series Rub-a-Dub-Tub – a magazine-style one-hour programme for very young children.
