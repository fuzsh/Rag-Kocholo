        "text": "DHX Television has revealed that it’s moving full steam ahead with its strategic content planning for Family Jr., announcing that Twirlywoos will appear on its soon-to-be rebranded preschool channel this fall. The new stop-motion series from Anne Wood at Ragdoll Productions, produced in association with DHX Media, takes young viewers and their families on a funny flight of discovery over the course of 50 11-minute episodes, exploring themes relevant to children aged 2-5 through comedic and imaginative interactions. This pickup follows the noteworthy news from earlier this month that Family Jr. will also be home to the eagerly-awaited return of Teletubbies in Canada.\n\n“We’re excited to introduce Canadian families to Twirlywoos, an inventive and playful new show that is tailored to the core preschool audience of kids aged 2-5 and encourages imagination and exploration for our younger viewers,” said Joe Tedesco, Senior Vice President and General Manager, DHX Television. “As we divulge more information about the robust and engaging programming lineup we’ve secured for Family Jr., I think the creative and inspiring personality of the channel will shine through and viewers across the country will be able to connect with the playful nature of the series and specials we’re bringing to families.”\n\nSilly, fun and full of surprises, Twirlywoos is a laugh-out-loud treat with loveable comedic characters who seek adventure wherever they go. Whether in the real world or on their big red boat, curiosity leads Great BigHoo, Toodloo, Chickedy and Chick to hide, imitate and be delightfully surprised as they discover new things. The series features child-centric slapstick humour that encourages preschoolers to gain confidence in their own perceptions of the world and reinforces their understanding as they grow and develop.\n\nTwirlywoos is produced by Ragdoll Productions in association with DHX Media. Chris Wood serves as producer, Steve Roberts (Dipdap) is lead creative and the series is devised and executive produced by Anne Wood (Teletubbies, In the Night Garden, The Adventures of Abney and Teal). The stop frame animation has been produced by leading animation studio Mackinnon and Saunders. Twirlywoos was created in association with celebrated education expert and government advisor Professor Cathy Nutbrown to ensure the series identified and catered to the concepts that are most relevant to the target audience. DHX Media handles global distribution, merchandising, brand management and marketing for Twirlywoos."
