        "text": "Reports of Firefly Spottings Supplied by\n\nVisitors to This Web Site\n\nby Donald Ray Burger\n\nAttorney at Law\n\nTo add your sighting e mail me! If you give me permission I will use your name. Information about the date, light conditions, description of the landscape and numbers of fireflies will be appreciated.\n\nTo see if I have a report from your state or country, click here.\n\n2014\n\nMarch 30, 2014: A reader reports: Hi. I'm from Houston, Texas. We were coming back home from Lake Houston on March 29, 2014, and it was about 9:00 pm. We saw a bunch of fireflies. It was about 65 degrees and we had just had a rain storm the night before. It has been more than 20 years since I seen these beautiful fireflies.\n\n2013\n\nJuly 10, 2013: A reader reports: Saw some fireflies last night right after dusk skimming through the corn on my property in Johnstown, Colorado. Thought it odd. Never seen them in the two summers I've lived at this house nor ever in the 8 years in Colorado. The farmer had not even started to irrigate yet. But we recently had some severe thunderstorms creating a humid environment for this area.\n\nJune 29, 2013: A reader notes: Last night had one perched on the outside of my glass door in south Fort Collins, Colorado. This was the second time I have seen fireflys in the area, as we saw a few near Boyd Lake a few years ago. This one was a vivid green, very bright, almost like a Gwen LED. Pretty cool!\n\nJune 25, 2013: A reader reports: Hello! This is for your firefly project. We saw three in our yard tonight at 10:15 pm, in East Preston, Nova Scotia, Canada, There were three greenish-whiteish firflies. We have woods and swampy areas in our yard. This is a full week before we saw them last year.\n\nJune 1, 2013: A reader writes: We spotted our first firefly of 2013 tonight, June 1, in our backyard in a suburb of Syracuse, New York. We have been seeking fireflies in both Rochester and Syracuse for the past couple of years. We have seen a couple of spectacular displays. But there is rarely more than a couple fireflies in my backyard.\n\nMay 17, 2013: A reader reports: I just saw fireflies tonight in my small backyard. It seems there are about ten of them roaming about at 8:30 pm when it was getting dark and the temperature is 71. I live in Pflugerville, Texas. Pflugerville is located between Austin and Round Rock. I think there were a lot less last year when we started developing our garden so I was pleasantly surprised to see more this year. We have a beautiful flower garden in our backyard that has been visited by several honey bees, butterflies, and a hummingbird moth (first sight this year) and now, the fireflies! There is a lot of wooded areas with a nice small creek and lake a little bit farther from our backyard. I hope this small piece of information helps with your fireflies project.\n\nApril 30, 2013: Alan Headrick notes: This is for Pace, Florida. We moved here in the summer of 2005, and I saw four fireflies; never had seen them before out west. It was so cool to see them and was looking forward to seeing them again. Well I never saw them again until tonight, 30 April, 2013. I saw a couple across the street and there may be more. It's a bit breezy out and 76 degrees. They blink twice with a white color and then about 30 second later they blink again, but sometimes 50 feet away. Still so cool I hope they stay around.\n\n2012\n\nOctober 15, 2012: A reader notes: We have fireflies on and off from late spring through early fall. Just tonight I observed a dozen or so out in the front yard (5 acres really) here in Central Florida. We live in north Myakka City, Florida, in the middle of an old orange grove. Thank you for keeping records; it seems to us they are regaining population rather than being in decline. Thank you\n\nAugust 13, 2012: A reader reports: Hi. I now live in The Woodlands, Texas, (north of Houston). I was out tonight around 8:15 PM and noticed a little blink/flash. Have lived in my home here for 10 years and only seen the firefly/lightning bug a handful of times. Had been doing a bit of quick yard work and had put my tools away. Went and checked the mail and when I returned to my driveway I noticed the flash. It was past dusk, starting to get pretty dark out. Think there were at least 3 or they were busy moving. I have a few large pine trees in my front yard and a huge oak tree. I would say they were at 5 feet high or less in this area. You just have to smile when you see them. Lived for 30+ years in southern California and never able to see one till we traveled cross country for a trip. Had to peek on the web to see what type of bug they are so I might be more welcoming of them during the daylight hours.\n\nJuly 13, 2012: A reader reports: I saw my first Utah firefly. It was July 4, 2012, about 10:15 pm. It was a clear sky, around 89 degrees. We don't live far (approx. 5 miles) from Plain City, Utah, where I see they have been sighted before. There are no marshes around us, and it was in my back yard. The moon was out, with fireworks from the neighboring communities going off, and there in my own yard was the best show! Pretty excited to spot my first in Utah!\n\nJuly 11, 2012: A reader reports: Punta Gorda, Florida. July 4 2012. Among vegetation bordering the Peace River in Charlotte Harbor, about 20 fireflies, flashing. Temperature around 90 degrees. Also spotted in Myakka State Park and other state parks where spraying for mosquitoes is not allowed.\n\nJuly 24, 2012: A reader reports: I saw one in my back yard in Sugar Land, Texas, last night at 8:15 pm. Just getting dark.I have lots of butterfly attracting plants so here's hoping I'll see more some day!\n\nJuly 1, 2012: A reader notes: Tonight, July 1, 2012, on an evening walk we saw two glowing movements as we walked over Fossil Creek by Trilby between Lemay and Timberline Road in Fort Collins, Colorado. We stopped and witnessed two fireflies moving along the creek that flows through a private open space. We marveled at the sighting first not being sure of just what we were seeing. We watched for about 10 minutes as they came within about 10 feet of us and then continued on their journey along the creek. Amazing!\n\nJune 18, 2012: A reader notes: I live in Hygiene, Colorado, and for the past few years have observed lightning bugs in the field behind my house. Dozens of lights can be seen after dark. This activity usually begins around the Summer Solstice and lasts for a few weeks. I've been seeing them every night for the past week. Very beautiful and magical--and nostalgic for me because I grew up in Ohio when lightning bugs were abundant all summer long. Thanks for this site!\n\nJune 10, 2012: A reader notes: Thanks for your website! I'm from Owensboro, Kentucky, and my husband, children, and I recently moved to Houston, Texas, in June of 2011. I haven't seen any lightning bugs since we moved down here, and I've been actively looking. Fortunately, we were back home in Owensboro during the first two weeks of May this year, 2012, and my children and I were thrilled able to see and catch several lightning bugs. We were staying with my mom, in the country, where wooded areas, ponds, deer, coyotes, and other such wildlife could be found. However, when living in Owensboro, Kentucky, my husband, kids, and I lived \"in town\" and saw them there too every night during early summer. We sprayed for mosquitoes and tried to rid our yard of standing water. We also lived next to a public facility where the lights stayed on until about 10 pm and the bugs came out anyway. It is just so much easier to see them when it is darker. I was always a little sad when driving at night and killing a lightning bug. For those of you who don't know, when they hit your windshield they continue to glow for several minutes.\n\nJune 9, 2012: A reader notes: June 9, 2012: I saw hundreds of fireflies here in Rochester, Pennsylvania, more than anyone in the family ever remembers seeing. It was around 10:30 PM, temperature 75, humidity 49 percent, barometer 30.02. Thank you Mother Nature for the amazing show! I wish I had a hammock to sleep on.\n\nJune 9, 2012: A reader reports: Hi. I just spotted my first firefly for 2012, in the front garden at dusk in Yorktown, New York. Its two weeks earlier than last years first spotting.\n\nJune 7, 2012: A reader reports: Where: Southampton, New York. When: June 7, 2012, 11:30 pm. Male sighted- flying very high. White light. Not yellow green. Earliest sighting yet!\n\nMay 31, 2012: A reader notes: It's just past 9 p.m. on May 31,2012. My daughter and I just spent 15 minutes catching fireflies in Raleigh, North Carolina. All together we caught about 25 and put them in a large plastic see-through container that she is sleeping with tonight. It's a beautiful calm evening with high humidity and temps are in the low 80s. They are everywhere. The best spring of the four years I've been here. Never saw fireflies growing up in Southern California. Sent from my iPad.\n\nMay 27, 2012: Cathy Crump Vonderhaar notes: Saw a single firefly tonight. We were sitting outside at dusk and I thought it was a fire ember, but there was no fire around. I followed it into the woods. It was clearly a firefly. Had no clue there were any in this area of Perry Park Ranch, Larkspur, Colorado.\n\nMay 26, 2012: A reader writes: Tonight while walking with my daughter and her dog we saw one firefly in the wetland area behind our house. It was 77 degrees F at 9:09 pm in Aurora, Colorado, in the Auburn Hill Area. We have never seen them in Colorado before.\n\nMay 20, 2012: A reader notes: I'm not sure if your website is still active or if your still recording firefly sightings, but as this is the first I've ever seen fireflies (just moved to South Carolina from california) I thought I would email you. I saw them in Greer, South Carolina, (Greenville country) on 5/20/2012, at around 9 pm, It is 78 and a clear night, we are in city limits but its wooded and we have a creek that runs around our house. They were on the other side of the creek so I can't tell how many (and they move around) but there seemed to be a dozen maybe. Thanks!\n\nMay 19, 2012: A reader reports: Thank you for your blog. I just found you on a web search. I had been hearing that fireflies are disappearing in Fort Worth, and wanted to see what had been written, if anything. I was taking a walk with my wife on the evening of May 3, 2012, at around 9 pm, and took comfort in seeing the twinkle of fireflies throughout the wooded creek in Tanglewood Park here in Fort Worth, Texas. I cross my fingers every year and thank the Lord for this little bit of heaven. I estimate the density at one firefly per ten cubic feet.\n\nMay 17, 2012: A reader notes: This report is from Seminole, Florida. At 9:00 P.M. right off the backwater of Long Bayou we saw tons of fireflies as we walked back through the mangroves from a fishing adventure. We were amazed to see fireflies in Seminole! Temperature was around 78 F. This was actually the second time we had seen them, we saw them about two weeks ago around the same time. There were literally hundreds of them.\n\nMay 15, 2012: A reader notes: Hi. I saw a firefly last night in Charlottesville, Virginia. It was in my house, which is in a wooded area. I only saw one. It had just started sprinkling, and then there was a deluge of water. The grass has been very damp lately, with a lot of moisture. I don't know if you are still collecting data, but it was great to see my first firefly of the season.\n\nMay 11, 2012: A reader reports: On March 12, 2012, in Jupiter, Florida, located in Palm Beach County. They were between the road way and beach in highly vegetated area north of Juno Pier. There were over 50. They were flashing. Temperature was between 70-80 degrees F. It was around 10:00 PM.\n\nMay 11, 2012: A reader reports: On May 4, 2012 in Boca Raton, Florida, located in Palm Beach County. North east section of Whyman Park. Highly vegetated area around 100ft from ICW. There were around 20. They were flashing. Temperature was between 70-80 degree F. It was around 11:00 PM.\n\nMay 10, 2012: A reader notes: I just wanted you to know that here in Sugar Land, Texas, I have seen one or two lightning bugs in my back yard over the last week. I keep a lookout nightly, but usually miss them if there are any around. I am trying to introduce my two year old son to the magic of fireflies. My wife has yet to see one and we joke that I am either having a stroke or that I also see unicorns and Bigfoot in our yard. I have such fond memories of lightning bugs while growing up in Arkansas. It's such a reminder of the innocence and simple pleasures of youth. I sure would love to see the firefly population make a big comeback soon! Thanks and keep up the good work. Sent from my Iphone.\n\nMay 7, 2012: A reader notes: I saw your posts online when doing a search for lightning bugs in Florida. I saw a lightning bug in Indian Rocks Beach, Florida, on Saturday night May 5, 2012. This was the most unusual thing I have ever seen. I initially saw a bright concentrated light outside my stained glass door. My initial thought was that someone was directing a laser stick at my door. I quickly opened the door and saw that it was in fact a lightning bug or fire fly of some sort. It was very similar in size to a northern lightning bug that you would find around the Philadelphia area. The main astonishing difference was that this lightning bug was a bright fluorescent green. I wanted to try and catch it but I didn't want to take a chance of injuring it. I have been out last night and earlier tonight to see if I could duplicate this sighting. I sure hope I am not the only one who has seen a similar bug. I am not an entomologist but I am 100% sure of what I saw.\n\nMay 7, 2012: A reader writes: From April 26 to 28, 2012, we were camping at St. Joseph Peninsula State Park in Port St. Joe, Florida. state park. The weather was warm, but pleasant, with high 70s to low 80s. We were in campsite that backed up to vegetation leading over to sand dunes toward the beachside. There were many fireflies wandering back and forth all three nights. It was a great surprise. Like our own little light show. What a peaceful sight, reminding me of my youth!\n\nMay 7, 2012: A reader writes: With the unseasonable warm temperature of about 67 degrees on March 31, 2012, the wife and I were out in the backyard by our garden enjoying our nice little fire in the fire ring as twilight gave way to night. I could hear overhead the ocassional call of migrating waterfowl, Blue-winged Teal and Gadwall, overhead under the blanket of night. I had leaned back in my chair and was looking to the heavens watching the stars when near the top of our Bald Cypress tree was a glowing firefly in flight. We watched if for a few minutes climb ever higher until it stopped blinking or possibly went over our 1-1/2 story house and into the front yard. Our house is set in a pasture setting with an agriculture field across the street and the other side of the field is a slow moving river. Trees are limited in our six acre yard with two rows of pines lining the west side of the property line as a wind break to the house. Five Bald Cypress in front and back yard in a line as if part of an old fence row. One Honey Locust tree, several 18-20 foot Mulberry Trees and 3, 30-40 foot Sweetgums. Earlier in the winter (mild this year 2012), I do remember seeing the glowing of the larval stage fireflies (I think) in the grass. Our address is Bloomfield, Missouri; however, we're about five miles north of Bloomfield proper in what is known as Aquilla, Missouri, just north of the Castor River.\n\nMay 6, 2012: A reader reports: I live in the middle of the city in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and I just saw a firefly while watering my garden. I have lived here for 44 years and I can't remember ever seeing one. We travel to North Carolina several times a year and one of the things that we always look forward to in the summer time is the Fireflies. Up there we have them every night in the summer. I could not believe my eyes when I saw this little guy all the way down here. It was about 8:45 pm. Sunset was around 8 pm.\n\n2011\n\nJuly 21, 2011: Michelle Abney reports: I read about your firefly tracking website in The Eagle this morning. I live in College Station, TX and have never seen fireflies in town. However, my kids had quite a treat in Navasota, Texas, this spring. There were several, I'd say about 15 fireflies, at the Bovay Scout Ranch off Hwy 6 during our Cub Scout family camp out May 7, 2011.\n\nJuly 20, 2011: A reader notes: We live on a farm in north Fort Collins, Colorado, and tonight around 9:30 pm we saw a single firefly along one of our ditches. It was glowing a very bright amber color and stayed there, hanging out on a piece of tall grass while we watched for a few minutes. We have NEVER seen a firefly in Colorado before. So cool.\n\nJuly 16, 2011: A reader reports: Hello. I was fishing from a raft last night on the Animas river about ten miles south of Durango, Colorado, and we saw fireflies! Western slope of Colorado? Highly unusual. I have lived in this are for the last ten years and this is a first. Temps were in the high 50s; time about 9:45 pm, easy westerly breeze, full moon/partial clouds. Two of us saw about 30 fireflies. Have not seen these insects in Colorado, I thought it was a mid-west thing. Well, they are now in the very dry southwestern corner of the state.\n\nJuly 14 2011: Donna Merrill reports: Tonight, around 9:15 pm, I saw a firefly next to Trapper's Point Lake in Fort Collins, Colorado. Temperature was the mid-70s. It was slightly cloudy. There was a very slight breeze. This was the first firefly I have seen here at my house. July 11 2011: A reader writes: Hello there Donald! Great to connect with like minded persons with a common interest in preserving firefly habitat. I do see a lot of fireflies each year during May/June at River Legacy Park (along the Trinity River) here in Arlington, Texas. . Keep up the good work and thanks for keeping this blog!\n\nJuly 3, 2011: A reader writes: Tonight, July 3, 2011, in the midst of fireworks going off I spotted some fireflies in my neighborhood in west Greeley, Colorado. About 77 degrees tonight. Last year we spotted them in a field near our house and none of our Colorado friends believed us until we took them out to the field one night. Our kids were able to catch a few last summer. I caught one tonight to take a picture and then let it back outside.\n\nJuly 2, 2011: A reader notes: Hello. If you are still logging sightings, we saw about 20 fireflies tonight in our wooded yard at 10:00 pm. Dusk. We went outside to see if we could catch the Canada Day fireworks from Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, and witnessed a better lightshow! They were all white/pale green.\n\nJuly 2, 2011: A reader writes: Hello. Mike from Fort Collins here. The last three evenings at least there have been THOUSANDS of fireflies in a field near Laporte, Colorado. It is just a hay field fairly near the Cache La Poudre river. It has been mid 80s and dry this week, following one of the bigger rain storms I have seen in 25 years in Fort Collins.\n\nJune 27, 2011: A reader writes: It was about 1:40 am on June 26 in Kissimmee, Florida. My girlfriend and I were in front of our home when she first just spotted a single firefly. I quickly turned around and saw it light up and fly away over our house heading northwest.\n\nJune 27, 2011: Tina Williams notes: I live in Lakes on Eldridge North in Houston, Texas, in the Eldridge and West Little York area. I have seen fireflies in my back yard in the spring of this year and last year. There are only a couple  but so exciting to see. By the way: I do have a mosquito misting system (using pyrethrium). I have no mosquitoes in my yard, but do have a few fireflies now. So nice to see your web site. I have all different sort of plants in my yard. I also have butterfly bush and butterfly weed,although prior to reading your article I was trying to get rid of both. Thanks.\n\nJune 26, 2011: A reader notes: I walk my dog almost every evening in Houston, Texas, in Terry Hershey Park in West Houston between Dairy Ashford and Eldridge. Around dusk almost every summer evening I see fireflys along the trail in the bushes that border the Buffalo Bayou. This year the numbers seem lower which I attribute to the dryer conditions but who knows. I have fond childhood memories of fireflys during the summers in Wisconsin. I appreciate your site.\n\nJune 26, 2011: A reader writes: I just saw the news story about your tracking sightings. I live in Houston, Texas, near West Sam Houston and Terry Hershey Trail. I noted lightning bugs on my calendar March 12 this year. I believe they were hanging around the old holly bushes in front of my plate glass windows; it was about dusk or a little bit later. I remember being delighted at an early sign that wed have a glorious spring. I dont use any fertilizers. I no longer have Terminix spray my exterior sills, etc., against roaches. My neighborhood hires a pest control company to spray mosquitoes at night (!) but my house is pretty distanced from the street. Ive generally observed the fireflies most years from inside my house as they flash against one plate glass window or another.\n\nJune 25, 2011: Nate Lovator writes: At 9:25 pm in Fort Collins, Colorado, . I would guess the temprature was between 75-80 degrees. It was very dry, saw one here, one there, and no more than three at once. It was amazing. I had never seen a firefly before. I did not know we had them in Colorado.\n\nJune 25, 2011: Kristen Varner notes: I grew up in Trinity, NC (outside High Point) and remember catching lightning bugs as a kid in the summer around dusk and then they would somewhat disappear by dark. I purchased a house in Trinity, North Carolina, three summers ago and have witnessed the most amazing lightning bug show every summer. We notice it begin every year a little before the summer solstice. They emerge around dusk and fly through the yard where they can be caught then, by 10 pm, there are thousands in the trees blinking. It looks like the stands at the World Series. We have an area of woods and a creek that passes through it behind our house and the trees in this area are just full of lightning bugs. It is like no place I have every seen and it is only in a relatively small area. It is magical and beautiful and I can see it all from my back yard!\n\nJune 24, 2011: A reader writes: I have lived in Lafayette,Colorado, since 1979. Tonight, at dusk, in our back pasture, for the first time ever, there were hundreds of fireflies hovering over our marsh. It was so incredibly delightful. I grew up in Illinois catching them nightly. When I was very young, I did what many others do, put them in a jar. And every morning when I got up, they were gone! It took me awhile to figure out my parents let them escape when I fell asleep.\n\nJune 18, 2011: Vicki writes: I'm currently in Tallahasse, Florida, and we went out looking for fireflies tonight. We found a few flying high in night sky in very wooded areas. The time was around 9 pm. The temperature was about 83 degrees. Clear sky. Humidity is at 68%. We were not able to catch any, but enjoyed watching them fly about the trees. The best part was that my daughter got to experience fireflies for the first time ... She loved every minute!\n\nJune 8, 2011: Shawn Kendall writes: One firefly sighted at Enterprise, Florida, at approximately 9:00 pm. At my residence, deep in the swamp woods, but borders a canal on the northeast side of Lake Monroe. I'll keep watching for more!\n\nJune 8, 2011: A reader notes: Milton, Ontario. James snow between Louis St Laurent and Derry Road. My cousin and I were walking about 9:30 pm, on a very hot humid night. We saw hundred and hundreds of fireflies. It was almost like fairy dust over the tall grasses. They seemed to hover just around the top. Some brave ones were higher and were very acrobatic. It was a magical sight. We've never ever seen such a sight. Stunning, to say the least.\n\nJune 3, 2011: A reader notes: Firefly sighting last night. A nice calm evening and they were everywhere in the forest surrounding my home on an acreage 5 minutes from Sherwood Park, Alberta, Canada. I believe that this is earlier than last years sightings and seems to coincide with millions of smaller sized blue dragonflies. We have a lake close by as well.\n\nMay 30, 2011: A reader reports: Sighting was at 3:00 am in Waxahachie, Texas (30 miles South of Dallas). It's about 75 degrees outside, humid, and a bit cloudy. I went outside my front door to let my cat inside when I noticed a bright, firefly-like, light flashing. The unusual thing, besides that it was just one, is that it moved faster and it's light flashed brighter and faster than I'd ever seen before. Almost like an LED strobe light. It was at the end of my sidewalk and moved towards me then up and over my house. Anyone else seen this type of firefly?\n\nMay 14, 2011: A reader writes: At approximately 8:00 p.m. in Huntington Beach State Park, South Carolina, off US 17, Murrells Inlet, Horry County, coastal South Carolina: On the two or so mile-long, paved pedestrian path known as the \"Straight Path\" by the nature observers who congregate there. (Runs directly west of Atalaya, the home of Archer and Anna Hyatt Huntingtons when Brookgreen Gardens was under construction.) I was shocked; I had no idea fireflies occur in South Carolina. Number observed was about 50 in the space of five minutes.\n\nMay 13, 2011: Captiva Island, Florida 9:11 pm. Temperature about 75-78 degrees. Not that humid. A really nice night. Our house is on the bay but directly across the road is the beach. Our lot is wooded--dense vegetation on either side. Very dark at night, which allows us to see them flashing all over the backyard area. When trying to catch one they move a lot faster than they did when I was a little girl. Their lights also seem more of a green glow not the yellow that I remember as a kid. What a great night to remember one of my fondest memories of childhood ... Catching fireflies! Priceless!\n\nMay 7, 2011: A reader reports: I just found your site when I googles fireflies in Florida. I am a native and had never seen a firefly in South Florida until yesterday evening (10 pm) and again tonight (around 9pm) in Hialeah, Florida. Similar to the report from the person on Key Biscayne, these have 2 lights, very bright and green, above the wings. I have never seen a similar lightening bug and these were longer (+1.25 in) than those I am familiar with from the mid-Atlantic and Northeast. The insect body was longer and thinner but the coloring of the body and wings and the wing structure and movement - slow and drifting - were very typical. Thanks very much for the site.\n\nMay 6, 2011: A reader reports: Don't know if you are still tracking their whereabout but here is: Miami, Florida, 33155 -tropical park area. I saw a few fireflies in our neighborhood tonight. My husband caught one for my daughter and we were able to put in a glass jar to examine it for a few minutes. Same as the one seen on Key Biscayne on June 5 2010. It has two green dots one of each side at the base of its head or above the wings. The body is black or dark brown and elongated. It's the first time I have seen those here.\n\nApril 22, 2011: A reader writes: Crystal River, Florida, 2:35 am, 62.6 degrees F. Approximately 1 mile east of the Gulf of Mexico, backyard, approximately 100 feet from a heavily wooded area. I saw only one firefly but I have waited three years to see one on this property. Growing up in central Florida they were plentiful. I hope this means I will see more. This one was very close to a window hovering around a red and yellow hummingbird feeder filled with a mixture of 1.5 cups of sugar mixed with 4 cups of water - no coloring.\n\nApril 15, 2011: I was walking on a nature trail in North Port, Florida, and back into the woods, where there is a ton of bushes and along a little canal I spotted a firefly at about 8:30 pm. As I kept walking through the trail I came to a bit of open field around 9 pm and counted at least 10 other fireflies flickering all around me. It was probably 75 degrees out, no clouds, just moon light and they stayed above head level. I've spotted them before in Sarasota, Florida a couple years ago and also in Englewood Florida, but I haven't seen them in a great while until tonight.\n\nApril 11, 2011: A reader sends from Homosassa, Florida: Hello: I stumbled upon your site when I was wondering about fireflies on the nature coast of Florida, Homosassa to be exact. We just moved to this area and I was so excited tonight to see a firefly hanging around my sliding glass door. I turned off my lights and looked out into a wooded area by my house and saw lots and lots of them! Very cool. We just moved here from East Texas and I never saw them there. I grew up in the Florida Everglades and never recall seeing them there, either. So, being a good mom, I got my kids ot of bed so my boys cold see their first ever firefly. Anyway, if you're still keeping up with your site, I thought you'd enjoy it.\n\nApril 4, 2011: A reader writes: My wife and I were excited to see 6 fireflies from our back yard in DeLand, Florida, at about 2130 this evening (April 4, 2011). There are several acres of second-growth dry/upland forest, mostly oaks with some slash pines (with a palmetto/mixed-shrub understory) just on the other side of our back yard fence. We live in the Glenwood subdivision of NW DeLand, almost in DeLeon Springs. Hope the fireflies are in flight wherever you are.\n\nMarch 23, 2011: A reader writes: I always check your website for hummingbird sightings. I also noticed your Cherokee links and tonight your firefly information. For the first time since I moved to Houston in 1990, my husband and I saw several fireflies in my neighbor's yard - in one area near some plants - last night. I always wondered why there weren't any here. I just read your note about fireflies and thought I'd write to let you know we saw some right in Houston, Texas! We were walking our dogs and passing our neighbor's house, we saw about 5 fireflies on March 22, 2011, around some bushes in West University Place around 7:30 p.m. and again around 8:15 p.m. in the same place. I'm going to go back and take a closer look at the bushes and flowers and see what ones they were. We did not see any other fireflies on our walk of about 12 blocks that night and have never seen any in our neighborhood before.\n\n2010\n\nOctober 4, 2010: Linda reports: We have noticed fireflies on our property near Magnolia, Texas, in Montgomery County North-West of the Woodlands and Houston. We have 12 + acres that backs up to a large wilderness area with ponds and creeks. We have replanted natives plants and trees and most of our neighbors are mow-a-holics with only wasteful lawns. In an acerage estate neighborhood We have the only yard with fireflies since 1998. We also have frogs, foxes and other wildlife absent from the other yards. I have seen the fireflies rise from the ground in the floodplain in a slow spiral to the sky as the darkness decended. We use no pesticides or herbicides or other toxins in the yard. So, God rewards us with fireflies sometimes starting as early in the year as February, flashing along with the spring peepers, the frogs of winter here. Thank you for caring about these delightful lights of our lives.\n\nSeptember 13, 2010: My husband saw a firefly on September 11 and September 12, 2010, in our backyard in Kingwood, Texas. It was just one single little guy, but was very exciting. We woke our three small children to come have a look.\n\nAugust 16, 2010: Gloria Valentine writes: I have had fireflies around my home in Wesley Chapel, Florida, which is just north of Tampa in Pasco County, for the last 2 months (mid-June to now, mid-August, 2010). They are not numerous, but they shine with a quick, bright white light. My yard has a pond with lots of woods behind it, and that's where they like to hang out. I am originally from Maryland and am accustomed to seeing many fireflies in the summer. I have been in Florida for almost five years and have never seen any here until recently. These fireflies blink rapidly, faster than the ones up North, and their light is brighter and white rather than yellowish. The weather here has not been anything out of the ordinary; hot, humid days with thunderstorms/showers in the afternoons.\n\nJuly 13, 2010: M. Nicole Morrison reports: I was in Westport, Connecticut, this past weekend, and the fireflies were out in full force around sunset on Saturday and Sunday. I, too, wish we had them in Houston. Do you think pollution in the area has anything to do with their absence? Thanks for maintaining this website. Take care.\n\nJuly 12, 2010: A reader writes: I have seen fireflies in Ft. Collins, Colorado, a couple of weeks ago, the third week of June. I was in a field along a bike path just west of Taft Hill Between Laporte and Vine streets, there's a little cattail marsh there. I was out in this marsh at about ten pm, and I saw one (only one) flying around, lighting up the area. And now, this night of July 12th, I was out there again and saw a full dozen or so of the glorious creatures. I grew up in the east where we had them in abundance every summer, and now I get to share with my children one of my fondest memoies of childhood, for truly there are fireflies in Ft. Collins, Colorado.\n\nJuly 8, 2010: A reader reports: My husband and son have seen lots of fireflies along the Terry Hershey trail/Buffalo Bayou between Dairy Ashford and Kirkwood in June and July in Houston, Texas. And I have seen them in my front yard.\n\nJuly 5, 2010: A reader reports: We were fortunate enough to see fireflies out at our RV Resort West of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Lake Arnault is about 45 minutes west of Edmonton. We have seen them on a number of occasions there this year. End of April , May 24 weekend and on June 12. if my memory serves me right. April was cool, 12 Deg C, about 10PM and +/- 150-200 lights in about 1 hour. May was warm, 18 Deg C, about 10PM and +/- 1000 lights in about 1- 2 hours June was warm, 22 Deg C, about 1130 PM and +/- 500 Lights in ½ Hour The ones in May were considerably brighter then the other times. It was amazing. I have been out there a couple of weekends since June, and didnt see them. It was just 1 block from the lake. Wooded with poplar and spruce and in each case humidity was a bit high. They were from about 6 feet off the ground to as high as 60 feet. I am looking for more info on these fireflies; thats what I was looking for when I found this site. Cheers.\n\nJune 9, 2010: A reader notes: We are seeing very few fireflies here in North Alabama. Just a few flickers each night. Not even enough for my five year old son to catch. I live within the city limits though where they regularly spray for mosquitoes. I am guessing that pesticide is killing our fireflies too. So sad! A few friends on FaceBook say that they live way out in the country and still have lots of them, but most friends are saying that the numbers are way down from when we were kids ~ 30 years ago.\n\nJune 8, 2010: A reader notes: Tonight at 6 pm 85 degrees in Searcy, Arkansas, we saw 20-25 fireflies lasting 20 minutes between mid-dusk and dark. Small town with heavy brush on property. Thanks.\n\nJune 6, 2010: Chris Biggar reports: We have seen fireflies in Limington, Maine, tonight at 9:30. We were sitting in our hot tub and for about 10 minutes we saw about 10 fireflies. Our property is 3 acres of field surrounded by acres of woods on the top of a hill 30 miles north west of Portland, Maine.\n\nJune 5, 2010: Darin Phillips notes: After a storm blew through the island tonight on Key Biscayne, Florida, we finally saw our first firefly. It had two glowing green spots on each side above the wings instead of a single large glowing underbelly. Large ants on our porch were eating another one that had died. We have lived in this condo near the end of the island for 2.5 years and this was the first time we have seen one. However, we have been unable to find out what species it is.\n\nJune 5, 2010: Elizabeth notes: On thirty acres in S. Fulton Co., Georgia. Unbelievably still rural. High 80's and humid humid humid . . . wish it would just go ahead and rain. Please. Most fabulous year for blooms. Have had several earlier random sightings of fireflies. Tonight, 9ish, stumbled down the hill to the pass-through path from the barn to the mill. It is low land under a hardwood canopy draining down to the creek . A tunnel of magic. Females a-glitter. Siren song of twinkling light. Wonders of a life lived in the south. Memory fails as to how often there has been this full a display. Childhood in Buckhead when it was just a neighborhood. Young adulthood in Inman Park when it was just a neighborhood. Once before here, between the last two droughts. Tonight! Tonight! Tonight! Who could have thought such a thing up? Wonderful. June 4, 2010: Nancy Greig reports: I was walking the dogs around my neighborhood in Houston, Texas, just now (9 p.m., June 4), and to my delight saw about a half dozen fireflies in the bushes at the back of an abandoned lot on the south side of Queenswood Drive. There is a little tributary of White Oak Bayou that runs back there. I have seen fireflies in the same vicinity in past years - didn't notice any last year, perhaps because it was so dry. Anyway, there they were. It gave me a little frisson of pleasure to see them again.\n\nJune 4, 2010: a reader reports: I was sitting in my I saw a firefly, I am from Bethlehem , PA and I would see them all the time growing up and miss them. My husband had told me when he came from work last night that they do not exist here. But that was not the best part, we were sitting in our living room at around 10:00 pm my husband looked down at the floor, and there was a firefly WALKING on our floor, lighting up! To me, it was almost surreal. My husband picked it up and set it free outside. This was the first time (and I have been living in Florida for 17 years), that I have ever seen one, let alone one walking in our living room. Needless to say, my husband is a believer now. I am from Plantation, Florida. The term that best described seeing it was MAGIC. Also, we live in the acres, so we are on an acre of land with surrounding trees and bushes and are about 10 minutes away from the everglades.\n\nMay 31, 2010: a reader reports: We live in near Terry Hershey Park in Houston, Texas. We started taking the children on \"Firefly Walks\" at dusk (+/- 8:30). This evening it was partly cloudy, warm and humid. We saw quite a few in the bushes and flying low to the ground. We were on the trail between Highway 6 and Memorial Drive, right along Buffalo Bayou. I believe the first day I started seeing them was Friday, May 28.\n\nApril 26, 2010: A reader notes: Last night was the night of a wicked storm, which turned out lightning and wind in extraordinary amounts  the lightning alone being called historical. It was actually so bad it was like a strobe light was going off outside. We live in Wesley Chapel, Florida, and this occurred on 4/26 in the wee hours (storm started around 7:30 on 4/25)  it should go down as worse than No Name Storm of 93(?)) I cant tell you for sure the temperature, but would have been somewhere in the 70s, at least around the time the bug was noticed. Anyway, after an explosive lightning strike, we were unable to sleep and got up to sit on the couch to wait the worst out (about 12pm) and my husband noticed a lightning but on the ceiling just behind us (inside the house). I have been in Florida since late 70s and dont recall seeing any since before then, when I lived in Ohio. I read a book about them purporting them in New Orleans at the time of Katrina, but I dont know if that is true or not. If so, perhaps there was something to do with that that moved them back (perhaps with the amount of people who came to Florida after Katrina  and brought them with them - or through some other atmospheric conditions). My husband is a truck driver, and I asked him if he had been anywhere where there were lightning bugs (in the event he somehow brought a bug home), but he said it isnt time yet in the northern areas (i.e. Chicago) where he was, and he hadnt seen any. I dont recollect when they used to start, only  like he said  they seem to be more of a summertime bug. In any event, we have had more rainfall this winter and spring than usual, and then this terrible storm, which went across the Gulf Coast, to this wonderful bug in our living room. I dont know what to make of it. It would be nice if they were coming back  of course preferably in their own environment. Is there any hope that its not just limited to strange sightings or certain habitats?\n\nApril 15, 2010: a reader reports: I was am excited. I had gone out back to take my dogs out at about 8:36 pm for their last potty before bed, and there it was: a firefly. I followed it through our yard and tried to catch it, but was unable to. We live in Palm Bay, Florida. I just wanted to let you know.\n\nLast night was the night of a wicked storm, which turned out lightning and wind in extraordinary amounts  the lightning alone being called historical. It was actually so bad it was like a strobe light was going off outside. We live in Wesley Chapel, Florida, and this occurred on 4/26 in the wee hours (storm started around 7:30 on 4/25)  it should go down as worse than No Name Storm of 93(?)) I cant tell you for sure the temperature, but would have been somewhere in the 70s, at least around the time the bug was noticed.

It's September 26th of 2009. I saw 3 out tonight; it's pouring rain. I live in Thomasville, North Carolina right outside the city limits. It was about 8;30 pm. There were lots here in early June thru August. Didn't see many after that until now. I would to keep as many as possible here, but I don't know how. I have learned this year to how to invite the hummingbirds and to be thankful for our dragonflies. Thanks.\n\nSeptember 24, 2009: Randy Constan, alias \"Peter Pan,\" reports: I had to run to my computer to type \"fireflies in Florida\" into Google! I've been in Tampa since 1995, after living most of my life in New York. I'd never seen any fireflies here in Tampa, Florida, nor heard of anyone seeing a single one. Then, tonight, September 24, 2009, around 10 PM, cluttered around a big \"floating mat\" island in a pond bordering my backyard, hundreds of them! Really fast blinking ones too, like little electronic LED flashers! They'd flash about 3-4 flashes per second, about 7 or 8 flashes in a row, then pause. The whole mass of them looked really magical! I can't help wonder if there's some greater meaning, and all those other fun things to think about. :-) In any case, VERY KEWL!!!!\n\nAugust 1, 2009: My family and I were fortunate to see Lightening Bugs/ Fireflies quite by chance on Saturday, August 1, 2009, in Mena, Arkansas. We were coming out of Spinelli's Restaurant looking back toward a wooded area and I saw the telltale blinking lights. We drove back to our motel - The LimeTree Inn - and sure enough behind the motel in the wooded area there were blinking lights everywhere. I found your site when I got back home to Texas and was wondering, \"Why don't I see lightening bugs here anymore?\" I live north of Dallas in a rural area and I haven't seen them since I was a kid. Any spottings that you know of in the North Texas area?\n\nJuly 4, 2009: On July 4th (2009) we were guests of some friends near Yadkinville, North Carolina. As the day turned to dusk, fireflies began to show up in great numbers. It was great fun seeing them. Of course, there isnt much light being generated from a city and the temperature was mild. My grandchildren enjoyed chasing them, just as I did growing up. Just wanted to let you know that there are still fireflies in the country!\n\nJune 21, 2009: A reader reports: Tonight, while sitting in my hot tub outside in the dark I saw fireflies for the first time. We are located in Colorado Springs, Colorado, towards the area known as the Black Forest which is higher and cooler than the city proper. I have lived in Colorado most of my life and have never seen them locally before. Very happy to see them!\n\nJune 21, 2009: CJ Johansson writes: Hi. I found your website trying to find out if fireflies lived around here after seeing one last night. I live in Malta, Montana. On June 20, 2009, at approximately 11:00 p.m., with just a bit of light in the sky, I saw one at the edge of small wooded area in rural farmland area. I didn't know fireflies lived here. I'd seen them in Indiana when I was in college, but never this far west. I've lived in this area for three years, but have never seen fireflies until last night. Just a single insect, flying. Light was three or four short flashes, which is different from the longer flashes I remember from Indiana (that was 25 years ago, so I may not be too accurate on what the Indiana fireflies were like). Hoping to see some more in the next few nights.\n\nJune 20, 2009: Mr. & Mrs. J Fortin note: We live on the Bow River near Fort Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada, and we spotted two fireflies this evening. It is the first time either of us have seen fireflies in the West.\n\nJune 19, 2009: Brian Scrivens reports: From 2003 to 2005, I lived in Mount Airy, Maryland. While there I discovered a field where a firefly competition is held. There were literally thousands of fireflies flying in a field of tall grass in a valley with a creek running through it. The field was about 200 yards wide X 800 yards long and used as pasture for dairy cows. Most of the soil appeared to be soft and wet, almost a wetland. The field was bordered by the road on one side and woods along the opposite side. This field was just packed with fireflies and I was in awe at the sight. I have brought my wife out to see them on several occasions. It is mid-June now and I am beginning to see many fireflies in the trees along the roads, so Im thinking they should be peaking soon in the area. My wife and I will go out to that field again this weekend to begin checking on this years display.\n\nJune 17, 2009: karen kebarle reports: A firefly flew to the screen of my window last night in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, at about midnight. I heard a buzz and then saw a green light winking and moving across the screen. I got up and saw it was a bug with a glowing patch on its abdomen. It glowed fluorescent green. It flew away when I turned the light on to look at it more closely.\n\nJune 15, 2009: A reader writes: Just outside Perdue Saskatchewan yesterday (June 14th). There had to be at least a thousand in this farmer's field across from this six foot deep standing body of water almost like a giant puddle in the middle of the gravel road grid. It was plus ninteen and around 10 to 11 at night and they blinked almost like sparkles There wasn't a steady glow to them and the light was almost like an LED light blinking off and on.\n\nJune 15, 2009: Chris notes: My husband and I were sitting on our front porch 4 nights ago (June 11, 2009) and both of exclaimed that we saw shooting stars. The next night however we were on our deck facing our woodland behind us and realized that those cant be shooting stars, way too many and some zinged past pretty close. Lo and behold they are fireflies! We havent seen fireflies since our honeymoon in Costa Rica. We are located 2 minutes east of Sherwood Park, Alberta, on a fully treed acreage lot 300 m from a large body of water. Sherwood Park is in the County of Strathcona, or 20 minutes east of Edmonton in the province of Alberta. It has been very dry here for the past 3 weeks and just recently the evenings have been quite warm (lows of 15 C), with daytimes of 23-28 C. What a wonderful sight they are. We cant tell how many there are but more than forty at least as the trees are quite constantly twinkling. Do they click during the day, Im hearing a lot of clicking on my trail walks lately?\n\nJune 10, 2009: A reader reports: After not seeing fireflies for several years, this spring they are back with a vegeance. I have seen them on Lake Hamilton in Hot Springs, Arkansas, and in my own backyard in Glenwood, Arkansas. I thought they were gone from this area for good. Could there be more because of the extremely wet spring?\n\nJune 9, 2009: A reader reports: Last night there were a large number of fireflies near our home. We live in Perry, just south of Brigham City and they were in a marshy area just making little lights like crazy.\n\nJune 9, 2009: Stephen Dehart reports: Last weekend at Brazon Bend State Park, in Texas, it was dry out there ( no rain in about 2 weeks ). Still quite a few flashes, but I noticed instead of an individual bug flashing every five to seven seconds , it ran about every seven to ten or more. This made it hard to get good photos of the flashes. I hope to go again after a rain, and before the season falls away. Also noticed one flashing repeatedly and frantically (gone full auto) under a red buckeye leaf, in fits of a minute or more, off and on for an hour or so, then flying off. Checking briefly under the leaves afterward, I found no obvious sign of egg laying, eating, or what the big deal was, but it was dark and late and I didn't exhaust every possibility. I never noticed it joined by another individual either.\n\nJune 8, 2009: A reader writes: I've been very heartened by the reappearance of fireflies in my backyard over the last two years after their virtual disappearance for the last ten! One thing that I do now during \"Lightning Bug\" season is that I turn off my outside lights: it seems to encourage them to congregate in my backyard... MOST IMPORTANTLY, I turned off the motion-detecting sensor in my carport, because it is very confusing to the males.\n\nJune 5, 2009: A reader reports: I moved to Pagosa Springs, Colorado, from Missouri. We had fireflies there but I did not think we would see them here in Colorado. But last night, at the elevation of 7079 feet, there they were in a field! Pretty cool.\n\nMay 31, 2009: Stephen Dehart reports: Mr. Burger: At the risk of telling what you may already know: Plentiful fireflies along the east side of Brazos Bend State Park, in Texas, from Hale Lake to the Brazos River. But most who care may already know that spot. Anyhow, I've been photographing them at night, and the high season appears to be in May, as long as there has been enough recent rain. Memorial Day weekend was very good there. They got between me and the cameras. This weekend, less so, which I attribute to a dry week, virtually no rain there in about eight or nine days. I have seen occasional, solitary flashes as early as February, and as late as October or November. I wonder if that's even a firefly, and not some predatory lantern beetle thing I've heard about. In the 1980's, the rice and cotton fields along FM 762 and 1462 were alive with flashes, streaking by the car at night like the stars on the old Star Trek viewing screen. The retreat of activity in the Park itself, over the last few years, has been ever eastward toward the Brazos River, and thus into the less-frequented areas of the Park. It might be a good place to study them, if some qualified person could devote the time. The ranger/naturalist informed me of five species identified there. What might I do to help?\n\nMay 23, 2009: Mel and Sharon Hixson write: A few fireflies have appeared nightly following thunder showers starting yesterday, May 22, 2009. We are located on a ranch between Kerrville and Fredricksburg, Texas.Very exciting for us to see as we recently moved to Texas and were wondering if we'd see any fireflies at this location. It's great fun watching them from the deck. This species seems much larger and faster flying than those we remember catching in other states when we were children.\n\nMay 23, 2009: Trish B. writes: Hello from Milton, Florida. We saw our first firefly here tonight. I am from the Midwest and used to seeing thousands, but since we have been in Florida we hadn't seen one. Well tonight we saw exactly one. My little girl was over the moon with interest as she has never seen a firefly. It had rained a great deal today and cooled off a bit this evening. We spotted him in the wooded lot that is adjacent to our property and watched him for a few minutes before he disappeared. It truly was a beautiful sight.\n\nMay 22, 2009: A reader notes: The past two nights, March 20 and 21, I have seen three and up to five or six fireflies buzzing around in my yard in Houston, Texas. . Dusk till 9 PM. One more thing and then I'll stop \"bugging \" you about this From the web: http://www.animalwebguide.com/Firefly.htm \"Many species can be found in marshes or in wet, wooded areas where their larvae have more abundant sources of food.\" I was at someone's house that has buffalo bayou at its backyard and she said she sees a few fireflies, but she lived in Houston a long time and remembers lots of fireflies when she was young, when they used to spray for mosquitoes, actually, in a marshy less developed area of town. I wonder if the secret to my success is the half finished pond project in my backyard, a pond with no liner that I keep somewhat filled most of the time anyway. Maybe the fireflies need low lying watery areas, the kind that people naturally want to drain because these pools are thought to cause mosquitoes. (Of course if you have a strong dragonfly population that helps solve the mosquito problem.) The more \"civilized\" and well drained an area gets, the more difficult it is for the fireflies in their muddy / watery larval stage? This would also explain the vast numbers at the state capitol grounds in Austin, in the middle of a city, since a creek with many slow flowing pools is nearby, and it would explain why people who have well-lined ponds don't have fireflies, because the larvae can't move back and forth from the soil to the water. But larger bodies of flowing water like bayous won't help because fish or minnows would eat the firefly larvae. I'd be interested in your thoughts on this.\n\nMay 5, 2009: A reader notes: Tonight, while out for an evening walk, my girlfriend and I saw some fireflies. We live on what used to be Clear Lake Golf Course near Johnson Space Center in Texas. We were quite amazed to see fireflies here, as neither of us could remember the last time we actually saw some in our area. There are some wooded areas that line the drainage ditch in our area, and the fireflies were swarming around one of these areas. There were very many, easily two dozen or more. The thing is, these fireflies are unlike any we've seen before. The flashes are mostly white in color and strobe very quickly (around a tenth of a second, I would guess) making it difficult to track a particular insect. When I was a youth, the fireflies I remember flashed green and for nearly a second. We were so surprised to see them that when we returned home, we actually started searching google to find if there was information on how common fireflies are in Houston. We stumbled across your page and an article from the Houston Press that referenced you as someone who might like to know. If you'd like to know more, let me know.\n\nMay 3, 2009: A reader notes: Don't know if your firefly report is still up, but I found it on a search. We just saw about four or five fireflies in our neighbor's backyard tonight! We live in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. (May 3, 2009) What a shock! We heard they were extinct in Coastal South Carolina and miss them since we had gazillions in the Northeast where we lived. We even shipped some overnight down to our grandson here in Mount Pleasant South Carolina and they lived a few days and he let them go. We were hoping they would pro-create. Tonight we were so excited I called our daughter and she said she saw one on her way home tonight, but didn't say anything to the kids or her husband because she thought she would be laughed at. She was so excited when I told her that we saw them just after they left to make the three mile trip to her house from ours. IS THERE A RETURN TO COASTAL SOUTH CAROLINA??? Sure hope so! Anyone know out there?\n\nApril 29, 2009: Nancy Borrell reports: I was walking Thursday evening and saw a flying blinking light, but it wasn't yellow, it was more of a bright white/blue light! It flashed a couple of times and I tried to get close to it but it stopped blinking and I lost it! Was it a lightning bug? I have lived here in Saint Lucie West (Port Saint Lucie), Florida, for seven years and have never seen one. Also I have lived in South Florida a total of 24 years and have never seen one. I am from New Jersey and we had tons of them up there but they have yellow lights.\n\nApril 27, 2009: Stephen Barker writes: I live in the panhandle of Florida. Pace, Florida, to be exact. And tonight about 8 pm I noticed at least two fireflies in the back yard. Currrent weather is 71 F. Clear, U V Index: low humidity at 61%; barometer at 30.28. This was the first time I saw any firefies in Florida. It was awsome.\n\nMarch 31, 2009: Jeff Easter notes: Saw your firefly website and thought I'd contribute. I've lived in Merritt Island Florida, for five years and have never seen a firefly until last night, when one lonely firefly briefly buzzed around our backyard and flew off. He (or one of his fellows) reappeared briefly tonight before disappearing off into the darkness. We live in a dense new subdivision so it is awfully nice to see nature making a stand here.\n\nMarch 17, 2009: Cody Zapp writes: Hi, I'm 22 and I live in Cypress,Texas, which is not far out of Houston. We use to have these fireflies all over the place when I was a kid, but sadly they disappeared. Heck, the last time I saw them I was six or seven, at least, and it was up at Double Lake. Last night I was staring up at the stars (noticing that I can see alot more stars than I use to could) and noticed a strange little streak of light. I kind of thought I had seen a shooting star or meteor of some sort. But no, it was a firefly! I couldnt believe it. He was just shooting along and flicking here and there. I thought, I bet I won't see that again for another 20 years. The temperature was around 67 degrees. Tonight, around 9 p.m., I was sitting out on my back porch and out of nowhere I started seeing hundreds of firefl[es! All sorts of colors too. Some were kind of green and some looked like red and yellow. I bet there were atleast 200 or so flickering everywhere in my back and front yard! I tried to get some videos of it with my camera, but it wouldnt pick it up. I live in a semi-wooded area. We have some woods behind us and that's about it. I wouldn,t call us rural but I wouldn't call us city either. I wonder if we got them from Hurricane Ike. I wonder if they got blown in with the storm. It seems we get a new critter every year out here and if this is a sign of the fireflies returning I hope their here to stay because I love them!\n\n2008\n\nMay 4, 2008: Michale Worley reports: We're in a rural area south of St Augustine, Florida. Approximately 2000 hours with a temperature of around 77F. I noticed one firefly toward the tops of a stand of oak trees next to our house. Thought I was seeing things as we have been in Florida since 1997 and I have never seen one firefly. After a bit of observing, several more showed up. I would say that in total there were at least a half dozen fireflies. My wife also witnessed the sightings. It was a real treat for me, as I have not seen any fireflies since 1977 in New Jersey.\n\nApril 24, 2008: Hello. I was looking for information on fireflies and found your website. My husband and I live in Sealy, Texas,  about 50 miles west of Houston. Our a ranch is about 6 miles south of Sealy. In the past 7 years since we moved out here, we occasionally see a few fireflies. It is always such a delight to see them  reminds me of when I was a child in East Texas and they were plentiful. One night about two weeks ago, I went out to the barn after dark and got a wonderful surprise. There were dozens of them in our pastures! Since that night I go out after dark for a few minutes each night and usually see a few. The experience made me wonder if they migrate and we just happened to be in their migration path that night. I, too, would love to see lots of fireflies. Tomorrow, my grandson is coming for a visit. He is 12 years old. I dont think he has ever seen one and Im so looking forward to sharing that experience with him.\n\nApril 9, 2008: A reader reports: Large bugs and plentiful in Clear Lake, Texas. Using Google Earth, I can see that northwest of Space Center drive there is a large drainage channel that runs parallel to the road. The field in-between the road and channel is full of flashing bugs. Space Center Dr. runs \"behind\" Johnson Space Center NASA.\n\nApril 7, 2008: A reader reports from Birmingham, Alabama: I am already seeing fireflies. I saw them as early as 3/28/2008. Isn't that unusually early?\n\nMarch 16, 2008: I live in between Crosby and Huffman, Texas, near FM 2100. I've been seeing lots of fireflies for the past week. In fact, this is the most I've seen in the 15 years I've lived here. They're most active at nightfall. What a treat to see them.\n\n2007\n\nReports are in, but awaiting processing.\n\n2006\n\nJune 19, 2006: Greg writes:I came home from work and found a firefly in my apartment in the Bronx, a densely-populated borough of New York City north of Manhattan and Queens. He/she was shining away as proud as can be in my kitchen. I live across the street from an 800-acre park (which contains a major zoo and botanical gardens) and there are a lot of trees in the neighborhood. My apartment building surrounds a large courtyard with trees but no water except when it rains. It will probably be happier in the park.\n\nMay 3, 2006: A reader writes: My wife and I saw a firefly flying above the wall in the backyard of our house in the Lakeside Forest subdivision in west Houston, Texas. It was just after dark @ 8:30 pm on 5/02/06. We saw several fireflies while camping in Bastrop State Park during the MS150 weekend. I have seen several fireflies after dark in along the bayou in Hershey Park during the spring and summer months.\n\nMay 3, 2006: A reader notes: We live in Clear Lake, Texas, (just south of Houston, not far from NASA JSC) and we saw two fireflies in our backyard about two weeks ago, I think around April 22. I was so excited - I've lived in the area for nearly 15 years and have never seen them here! I'm originally from Maine and grew up taking fireflies for granted, but now I consider it a special treat! And in our own backyard! It was fairly late in the evening, perhaps 10 - 10:30 p.m., so quite dark. Our backyard has several different varieties of plants, and I have (I think) a pair of hummingbirds that frequent my Mexican sage, honeysuckle, and other flowers. We also have monarchs all the time. Our house backs up to a nature preserve/bayou-ish area. I haven't seen them since, but an abundance of snakes this year are keeping me from enjoying the yard as much as I would like! Do you have any tips on keeping snakes out the yard?\n\nMay 1, 2006: Diane Pallot reports: I live in a small town near Titusville Florida called Mims, Florida. I sent in a firefly report on April 11 about fireflies in Mims, Florida. I have made a new discovery in Yankeetown, Florida. We have a cottage over there and we have discovered them in some adjacent woods. They seem to like areas with hardwood trees and low lying shrubs and grass. Glad they are there as well.\n\nMay 1, 2006: Marietta McCall reports: I wanted to share with you that I was watering my herb garden last nite about 8:00 P.M. and I saw my first firefly for this year. I saw only one but was surprised at that. I live in Boerne, Texas, and have shared my sightings with you in the past. We have Acorn Bed and Breakfast and our back yard has been designated a Backyard Habitat by the National Wildlife Federation. We have a brook and a pond (great water sources for birds,butterflies and insects) and we garden for wildlife,birds, and butterflies. I shall keep you posted when I see more fireflies. I should mention that I grew up in New Jersey and we always called them \"lightning bugs\". They are really an experience to behold you cannot describe what they are like to someone who has never seen them. I treasure the wonder of them each time I look for them in the evening around dusk.\n\nMay 1, 2006: A reader notes: A week ago, I saw a firefly in the Oak Lawn area of Dallas, Texas, in an apartment complex. And yesterday evening I saw two of them in a residential area of Round Rock, Texas, just north of Austin. Prior to this, the last I had seen of them was in Houston, back in the late 1970s. This is an encouraging sign for our little friends, I think.\n\nApril 23, 2006: Michelle B. Stein writes: I just came across your site looking up fireflies because my dog just found a firefly inside my house. It's only one but I was so excited about it. I haven't seen a firefly in a couple of years. I'm only 22 but when I was younger my family used to go camping and we'd catch them in jars, I didn't even realized it was so long ago. I don't think I would have realized it was a firefly if my dog wouldn't have been sniffing it. It was glowing while she was sniffing. But I just wanted to report my one firefly sighting in Garyville, Louisiana. It's a really small town in south Louisiana. But I just wanted to let you know because if there's one, there's more.\n\nApril 20, 2006: Carl Freeman notes: I live in Magnolia, Texas, which is about forty miles northwest of Houston. One of the things we heard when we moved here from California was that there were not any fireflies. However, since moving into our home, we have had sightings every night. Now, I don't know how rare it is, or how to support their growth, but I am really happy they are here. It makes sitting on my back porch even better!\n\nApril 11, 2006: Diane Pallot reports: I live in a small town near Titusville Florida called Mims, Florida. In my development I live adjacent to a wooded common area; however, that is not where the fireflies are. They used to be across the street in two vacant lots. The lots were wooded and lots of long wild grass covering most of the ground. The first year I spotted them was 1996. I never saw anything as beautiful. The entire wooded lots were lit up with what seemed to be thousands of fireflies. It looked as other people have described as small Christmas lights twinkling on the ground. Green in color, they would blink just after dark and kept on until 10:00 or 11:00 p.m. My block is a mile long with other woods, but the fireflies seem to be in primarily one spot on my block. As the years have past the two lots have been developed. One neighbor left most of his woods; the other (this is where they mostly were) was clear cut. I told the owner of the land that he ruin a beautiful thing. Now I see them in my backyard which also has the underlying grass . I believe this grass may have something to do with their survival. There is very little lawn on my 1 acre, mostly natural woods. We have screech owls, turkeys, hogs, raccoons, armadillos, opossums, flying squirrels, and gray squirrels .behind my backyard woods is my neighbors woods so there is plenty of area for our fireflies to court one another. They always come at the same time every year, the first week in April and stay for two or three weeks. It is now the 11th of April and I can see them already starting to disappear. I dont believe I will ever see thousands as I did in the past near my property but I am glad that they did not disappear all together. There is still some across the street where the neighbor who kept his woods lives. However they are just not as many. I do not spray any pesticides on my lawn or any fertilizer except Milorganite. This year we are having a drought so I do not know how this will affect their breeding. I feel blessed to have them.\n\nApril 3, 2006: A reader reports: Didn't know if you are still taking sightings of fireflies. I have three. I recently moved from Houston to North Austin, Texas, one year ago, April 2005. About mid April our front yard and back yard were swarming with fireflies. It became a twilight event to sit in the back yard on our deck and just watch them. This lasted until about September as they gradually faded till there were none left. I am anxiously awaiting their arrival this year. I have started to sit on the deck at twilight, they haven't shown up yet. We live in neighborhood that is backed by a ravine and greenbelt. Although the ravine is mostly dry during the year there are a lot of trees and brush. The entire neighborhood has them, as well as the main road that leads to highway183. These are a large golden variety. In Houston, actually Friendswood, Texas, which is about 30 minuets south of Houston and 20 minuets north of Galveston there is a park where fireflies still flourish. Frankie Randolf Carter park off of FM 2351 at twilight is teeming with lightening bugs. If one looks down into the trails as the sun goes down one can see what look to be blinking Christmas lights in the trees and hovering about the trail. We discovered the fireflies in about mid May. They only seem to be around for a month or two in Friendswood, but they are there. These were a smaller golden variety. In Heritage Park subdivision between Friendswood and Webster, Texas, there are a few, but not many little green phosphorous bugs that will show up in June till August. Usually we would only see a handful at a time and it was very inconsistent that they would be out. It was very hit or miss. These were seen in the back portion of the old Heritage Park neighborhood off of Bay Area Blvd. Next to what is now a Super Target.\n\nApril 2, 2006: A reader reports: Today, April 2nd, 2006 I saw a firefly in the front yard of my home, located on the north side of Lakeland, Florida, which is in Central Florida. I live in a suburb area on the north side of Lake Gibson. It was around 9:00 p.m. and the temperature was around 70 degrees. It has not rained here in several days and I had the sprinkler running. I did not see any others, just the one.\n\nMarch 20, 2006: A reader reports: I live in Wellington, Florida, which is in Palm Beach County. I have seen hundreds of fireflies in the past few days behind my house. We live on a natural preserve and there is some water separating our house from the preserve. It hasn't rained in awhile, but the nights have been really nice and in the 60's, and there isn't much humidity now. Mostly all of the fireflies stay in the preserve, but a few show up in my yard. By the way, it's March 20th, the first day of Spring!\n\nMarch 17, 2006: Doris E. Sinclair notes: I am happy to report that here in Naples, Forida, which is in southwest Florida, we have a fine supply of fireflies and have been observing them for at least the past 5 years. And their numbers appear to be increasing. We live in a more rural area on 5 acres of our own, plus the 5 acre tracts on either side of us are not developed. Our fireflies seem to prefer the woods. The first one was sighted at the end of February and since then they seem to be more plentiful each night. It is pure joy to walk in the woods with them twinkling. Thanks for providing a venue where this can be shared!\n\nMarch 2, 2006: A reader writes: On March 2, 2006, I observed fireflies in Lacombe, Louisiana. I saw them from ~2035 to after 2200 hours. I observed maybe six flashes/ minutes, about 20 to 30 feet off ground with woods as background. Air temperature was 68. The high today was 78, last night low was 50. The area is Rural, light population. ~5 miles north from Lake Pontchtraine\n\n******************************************************\n\n2005\n\nJuly 9, 2005: Ellen L. Ramsey notes: Greetings. I enjoyed all the information on your website about fireflies. Here's a firefly description to add to your collection. We live in Chester County, Pennsylvania, and as part of our celebration on the Fourth of July weekend, we drove out to Lancaster County on the evening of July 2nd and had dinner at the Bird in Hand restaurant. We drove back home at twilight, and the countryside was flooded with fireflies--they were flying up from the cornfields and cow pastures, and from around the ponds. The lower branches of the pine trees looked like they were sparkling with hundreds of blinking Christmas lights. It was most magical. Even more fun than fireworks! I noticed Nancy Herman's description about seeing so many fireflies in Merion, PA, this year. I have no idea why there might be so many, but it's magnificent to watch them in the evenings.\n\nJuly 8, 2005: A reader writes: I live in Adams Township, Butler County, Pennsylvania. I have lived 35 miles north of Pgh. in a country area for the past twenty years and have never seen as many \"fireflies\" as we are seeing this year. Does anyone know why? I mean, driving down my road at night is like warp speed in Starwars.\n\nJuly 8, 2005: A reader writes: I live on a lake in the northwest corner of New Jersey. About two weeks ago my brother was visiting and we went out on the deck by the lake at around 10 PM. Now, we had grown up here as children and I moved back about nine years ago, so we are no strangers to fireflies, but this night was like no other! Just off shore there is a small (60 foot by 15 foot) island. When we looked out towards the island we saw thousands of fireflies. The amount was odd enough, but they were lighting up and staying lit, leaving streaks in the night like meteorites. As I've said I have seen fireflies all my life, both here and in Queens, New York, where we lived during the year, but nothing like this. Over the next week they continued to appear, at about the same time but the amount lessened each night. The number, the brightness and the time they stayed lit made it look like Christmas lights twinkling in the sky. We have been looking for information about this ever since. Was it a mating ritual? Or some other natural event? If anyone knows anything about it, please let us know, as it was so beautiful that if it occurs at a given time each year we don't want to miss it next year. Also, in researching fireflies I read that they fly about one and a half feet off the ground. Around here they can be seen in the tops of trees 35-45 feet off the ground.\n\nJuly 7, 2005: A reader writes: As we placed our chairs along the edge of the one acre pond in the middle of the public park my fiance pointed toward the right. We had never seen so many fireflies anywhere. It was the Fourth Of July and there were dozens of people and dogs and lots of noise. As the kids ran around with sparklers and the occasional small firecracker went off it seemed as though the fireflies were completely undisturbed. It was as if watching a pre-fireworks display. As we watched the twinkling - akin to those icicle lights that people hang from their rooflines around Christmas - we realized that describing the actual amount of fireflies would be difficult. The fireworks began and then we had our description. The firefly display was like when one of those really big fireworks goes off and starts to dissipate, as it drifts toward the ground there are a million twinkles of light. That is what we saw in Olathe, Kansas, on the Fourth Of July. During the last week of June we spent some time in Almont, Michigan. There were lots of fireflies, they had a rapid blink - blink - blink to them, unlike at home in Kansas where they just give off the occasional single blink at a time. The color of the blinkers in Michigan was also more of a green compared to the yellowish blink of the Kansan fireflies. In Michigan we were in a tree-lined yard surrounded by farmer's fields. No water within a square mile, unless you count swimming pools.\n\nJuly 7, 2005: A reader writes: Hi. We just moved here and there are a lot of fireflies out each evening. We live in Glasgow, Kentucky. Each night and more then we can count. We live on almost four acres in a city rural area. lots of large lots, with a wooded area on the property. It is very humid here and hot, 54% and a temperature range of 81 to 95 degrees each day, and it goes down to 60 degrees at night. The date we arrived was 7/4/05 and have seen them each evening.\n\nJuly 5, 2005: Kay Gelvin reports: I have been haunted by your plight! It has been on my mind constantly, since seeing it on the internet last week. I have some information which I think could be useful to you. This season, I've seen more fireflies than I have in a very long time. It is mind boggling to think I've seen so many. Let me set up a few facts. I live in the southeastern corner of Michigan, a mile or so from Lake Erie. We have had half the normal amount of rain this year and does it show! I live next to a farmer's field in a small subdivision and it is all clay around here. It has been a warmer than normal season but last summer it was the most mild I can ever remember. I have experienced three incredibly bad winters in a row. This I measure by the damage to my roses and lavenders. (Excessive cold. Extreme cold/warm days in spring and too darn wet. The snow stays on the ground for months.) I grow herbs and specialty (heritage-type) roses. I use both in culinary ways, so I don't want to spray. This year, I am expanding my herb beds and I am spending a lot more time outside than I would normally. From early morning to dusk, I see fireflies. Everywhere! I probably see more of them than any other bug! (Well, maybe not. I've got an awful lot of hornets around here with all that clay!) Anyway, the fireflies are very active during the day. I have a tendency to be a lazy gardener so I usually don't deadhead my plants unless someone important comes for a visit, and even then I have to be motivated. Well, this year, since I've seen so much damage to my roses, I decided to nurse them along with pruning and deadheading. And I'll tell you they have so many little fireflies visiting you would be amazed. If you asked me on any given day to go out and collect 25 in 25 minutes I know it would not be a problem, and I bet I could do it in a lot less time than that! Here's the thing. The fireflies seem to be sweeping the spent roses with their mouths. Over and over again. Some of the most popular (according to the fireflies) roses I have are Alchemist (only blooms once but it is spectacular), New Dawn (repeat bloom), Rugosa roses (repeat bloom), Jacques Cartier (repeat bloom), all of which have quite good scent. Because I don't spray, I have other bugs as well and it is quite obvious from the damage to the leaves. I think it's safe to say that adult fireflies do indeed eat! Since they spend so much time on the decaying flower, I've decided to halt the deadheading and continue to watch their habits. I know there are roses in Houston, but how many people have them, just for the fun of it, and don't use any sprays, powders, or systemic treatments? I do not and will not plant Hybrid Tea roses. They require too much attention in a climate such as this. I have the hardier and more robust roses and my biggest problems are aphids, not Japanese beetles. Is it possible that you could try growing any of the roses I suggested? (My first choice would be Alchemist.) The trick would be to grow these and not use chemicals. My guess is if this is something that makes my yard special, then it may take a few years for the cycle to establish itself. I also have several rosemary plants which I put in the ground in spring and then dig up and bring inside in the fall to winter over in a south-facing bay window. Three years ago, I had a firefly come out of the soil from one of these plants at Christmas. Luckily enough, it was warm enough that he was taken directly outside to fend for himself. I hope this can be of some use to you. You have my permission to use my name and should you want daylight pictures or other information on this, please let me know. I wish you all the very best in your quest. I find your mission to be extraordinary and I applaud your efforts.\n\nJuly 5, 2005: A reader writes: In the lower east side of New York City, New York, , in a rare section with much greenery, fireflies were sighted over three consecutive evenings (after an evening of rain). The second night there were many fewer. On the third night there were even more than the first (maybe thirty?).\n\nJuly 4, 2005: A reader notes: We regularly see fireflies in our area, 45 km. east of Edmonton, Alberta. The terrain is wooded with some water near by. We generaly see them from June to September.\n\nJuly 4, 2005: A reader writes: I live in rural Felton, Minnesota, and it is July 3, 2005, at about 11:30 pm and I have never seen a firefly, but I recently moved to this area and I saw a single firefly in my back yard. It is about 75 degrees and we have had lots of rain recently, lots of thurder-storms, and tonight many people are setting off fireworks. I wonder if the flashing from the fireworks attracted this firefly and why I only saw one. I watched him for about 5 minutes and when he went into my garden, I didn't see him flash anymore.\n\nJuly 3, 2005: A reader writes: Absolutely confirmed! I was invited out by the observer of the previous Plain City, Utah, report and I verify there is a healthy population of fireflies! We watched them (my first ever!) for about 45 minutes. Thanks for the referral to him to make this possible. It was a great thing!\n\nJuly 1, 2005: Nancy Herman writes: I live in Merion, Pennsylvania, right outside of Philadelphia and I have never seen so many fireflies as I have this year. I am 67 so that is quite some time. I was wondering if anyone knows why. I have noticed there don't seem to be any bats around. Could that be it and, if so, where are they?\n\nJuly 1, 2005: A reader writes: We have had a place on the lake in the southwestern British Columbia, for 14 years, with never a sighting until the 29th of June, 2005, at 11:30 PM. We have had an extraordinary amount of rain this year. Our cabin is on a small lake , the forest in primarily spruce, pine, poplar and aspen. The lake is in a valley. Our elevation is 3400 feet. There is a lot of red willow, marsh grass, a few hay fields. The night of the sighting there was a cloud cover. We had the Christmas tree lights on at the edge of the lake, to add to the ambience! There were about 6 fireflies! I felt I was part of a fantasy! I had been so envious of my friend who had seen them in Japan. I truly have been moved by this experience.\n\nJune 29, 2005: Paul Lowry writes: Hello. Many fireflies here in the city of Omaha, Nebraska, in the last couple of weeks, about 30 to 40 per night, all very active and flashing regularly. I have seen many of them mating in the bushes next to my deck. They always seem to appear at the same time, about 1/2 hour after dusk. This week has been cooler (about 85 deg F.) and less humid and they do not seem to be as active as last week when it was in the mid 90's. As for lighting conditions, my backyard faces a busy street with street lights and is never completely dark, but they don't seem to mind. They also seem to react to lightning flashes in the sky, lighting up seconds after a lightning strike as if they were flashing back. Hope this helps\n\nJune 29, 2005: A reader writes: I was walking tonight at dusk under the elevated trian platform in Bushwick, Brooklyn, New York, when all of a sudden I noticed a stange familiar glow. I don't think I had seen a firefly since my childhood in rural Maine. I held out ny hand and the beetle landed in my palm and stayed put while I walked all the way home . . . about a fifteen minute walk! I put him in a jar with a fresh marigold and he was flying around and blinking enthusiastically for about ten minutes but then all of a sudden stopped moving and seemed to be playing dead. I became concerned and freed the firefly in my window box of alfalfa sprouts where he is still resting. I hope I haven't hurt him! Does anyone know if fireflies may be poisoned by marigolds? It's just the change in his behavior was very sudden and I only handled him with the gentliest of care. :) Brooklyn NY June 28, 2005 9 pm 80 degress, humid. One firefly, black with red head, blinking happily...\n\nJune 29, 2005: A.P. Belcamino writes: We were thrilled to read your info on fireflies. We are having the best year that we have ever had . We live in Litchfield, New Hampshire. Our Spring was wet and now the humidity is high. We are spending every evening watching the light show. Thank You for ENLIGHTENING us!!\n\nJune 27, 2005: Greg Price reports: While driving from Waterloo, Iowa to Cedar Rapids, Iowa - between 10:00 PM and 11:30 PM, and after a thunderstorm, I observed thousands of fireflies in the corn and soybean fields adjacent to I-380. Stopped twice at rural road exits to watch away from the highway and was amazed to see literally thousands of sparkling lights per acre of farmland. They were clustered in the grass median at the overpasses and a dozen or so were collected by my windshield and left brightly glowing smears which dimmed after about five minutes. This is my first summer in firefly country and I must say that these creatures are one of nature's treasures.\n\nJune 27, 2005: John Jackson writes: Just how far up do these fireflies fly? My husband and I saw at least 20 to 30 bright flashes of light on June 26th in Hardin, Texas. We watched them until about 10:45 and they never stopped. These lights moved very fast and came off and on. They flew as high as the airplanes and never came close to the ground. Every minute or so we had flashes of what appeared to be distant lightning, but skies were clear and all stars visable. On any given night many planes pass over head, but not on the 26th. About 20 minutes into these sightings, a large plane(or jet) passed over using the biggest, brightest light beam we have ever seen. The aircraft was very loud and seemed to be looking for something. Then about 10 minutes later anouther large aircraft flew over using lights but not the big, bright beam. These bright lights flew very fast and so high I can't imagine a firefly being that far up and it be so bright, as well as the lack of planes that are usually in our skies. Hardin is in southeast Texas, about 50 miles east of Houston. Anyone else see these strange lights and/or large aircraft with the bright beams? Or maybe an airforce base doing something?\n\nJune 27, 2005: A reader reports: I live in Arlington, Massachusetts, and for the past seven years have been viewing fireflies at the marsh opposite the Belmont Country Club, on Concord Avenue as it runs from Belmont into Lexington towards Waltham. It's a very reliable place to find a good number of fireflies, and they have been out this year for about two weeks. Also, I have recently found that the marshes in Concord along the Battle Road in and near to the Minuteman National Park, have very plentiful fireflies. Last night, while a thunderstorm with lightning passed along the north side of Concord, the fireflies & their flashes went absolutely crazy! Have never seen so many in this area. Another great place to find them is the \"cow pasture\" (that's what the sign says!) next to the Concord River where the launch site for private canoes is located, just outside the center on Lowell Road. (My best firefly viewing was in mid-Pennsylvania, Ohio & Indiana - I've never been south to Florida or Georgia at this time of year.) Thanks for keeping up the great, resourceful web page.\n\nJune 27, 2005: Bill Harris wonders: My wife and I have lived in Issaquah, Washington, since 1987 and have not seen a single firefly until early Sunday morning, June 26, 2005 (we moved from Bellevue, Nebraska where there are plenty of Lightning Bugs). However, we've recently moved into an area, that has a wetland (on our property 1.47 Acres) and observed a single blinking light in the grass... could it be possible that we've spotted a Lightning Bug? Are they in the Seattle Area?\n\nJune 27, 2005: C. M. Hill notes: In the little town of Montpelier, Louisiana, there is a place on the Tangipohoa River where the fireflies are so numerous until they fill the sand with their lights. As they rise at dusk, you can't tell them from the stars. They fill the air and trees and the sand.\n\nJune 26, 2005: Paul K. Smith writes: Last weekend I was visiting my parents in Missouri City, Texas, near Houston (the Quail Valley Neighborhood), and I saw one or two fireflies along one of the golf courses there.\n\nJune 26, 2005: A reader notes: Thought I saw one out of the corner of my eye but not sure. Here in Irving, Texas, I rarely see any fireflies, maybe one a year, if I'm lucky. I have lots of flowers and tropicals and woodland shrubs. Lots of shade in the neigborhood, but no creeks nearby.\n\nJune 26, 2005: Nikki King notes: We live in Lakeside, Texas, west of Fort Worth. The fireflies come out by scores every night. It is like a mass meeting of little fairies. Beautiful. The cicadas also live here, as well as the wasps that hunt and kill them.\n\nJune 24, 2005: Lynda McLeod notes: We live in Ajax, Ontario, near Carruthers Creek about one mile north of Lake Ontario. Every year we see the fireflies June 12-13, and this year no exception. The area near the creek bed has several old trees lining the banks, and then opens up to a natural grass area. We see them floating over the tall grasses and as high up as 10 feet after 9:30 at night. Often the males carry on for hours, because I have spotted them glowing as late as midnight. Unfortunately the windy weather and damp weather does seem to affect the numbers, as we don't have as many as we used to have.\n\nJune 23, 2005: Jim Pelletier reports: I've been watching fireflies for the past 4 nights. Locations: Jaffrey and Rindge, New Hampshire. Sighting times: 9-9:30 pm. Density: Fireflies have been sparce. High density of fireflies tends to be around the 4th of July. Great site. Thanks for creating it.\n\nJune 23, 2005: A reader reports: Just saw an article on the web about your curiosity of fireflies. I used to live in a condo in the city of Chicago. Last year, I moved into a suburb of Chicago, Illinois, and had a lawn and my own backyard for the very first time. It was at this time that I discovered native plant species to my local area. I started planting them in abundance from forbs, to grasses, vines, shrubs and trees. Then, this year they came. At dusk, I have fireflies flitting about my yard. They go about their lighting display for about one half hour and then there's silence. I have not seen them in my neighbors' yards so I can only assume that they like the native plantings I provided (or maybe they're attracted to the other beneficial insects that now inhabit my yard). I highly recommend this avenue if one is truly interested in attracting these magnificent miracles. Also provided are shallow puddling pools that I scattered throughout my yard. I took the bottom saucer of a planting pot and filled it partially with sand. Every morning I change the water for the insects that may come to visit me. This may also be a useful tool. Good luck!\n\nJune 23, 2005: Mary writes: I live in Gainesville, Missouri, and there are hundreds of fireflies there. They live in the hedges and come out at night. They fly low and even at times seem to fly right in front of my husband and myself as if they are looking to see what we are. Even our old dog enjoys watching the fireflies in the evening. They seem to loose altitude when their little light blinks on. They fly over the lawn. We enjoy watching them.\n\nJune 22, 2005: Joe Salas writes: Hi. I live in a subdivision called Lakewood Estates, Texas, which is between Lakehills and Pipe Creek, Texas, at an altitude of around 1300 feet. I have been seeing fireflies for the past month on my property. I am about a mile from Medina Lake as well. Sometimes there are two or three fireflies and at other times there could be a dozen or so. I have not seen masses of them yet like I used to see in San Antonio where I grew up in the 1950s and 60s. There are no more fireflies in the city but out here in the country they are making a comeback. The area is not isolated because there are quite a number of homes but lots of woods as well. There is an increasing amount of hummingbirds as well. There have been reports of badgers as well, but I have not seen them. I don't even know what they look like. It is such a pleasure to see the fireflies return. It is even more exciting to see them blink in synchrony even though they are all apart by some distance. How do they do that?\n\nJune 21, 2005: Nancy Greig reports: The fireflies are back in my neighborhood! I saw at least a dozen of them the other evening. They hang out in a \"wild\" area (grasses and trees) around a little ditch/arm of White Oak Bayou that runs behind Queenswood Street in section 5 of Timbergrove Manor in Houston, Texas. It is always quite thrilling to see them!\n\nJune 19, 2005: Adrienne Keener reports: Good Evening!! I came across your web site tonight after doing some research on the ever fascinating fireflies. I am from Palm Beach, Florida and have never seen them until I moved to Jonesborough, Tennessee, last June. I have a six year old little boy that is very fascinated by these little buggers!! Last night (June 18) we were sitting on our deck and watch in amazement on how many there were (it looked like billions) in the pasture behind our house. It looked like Christmas lights dancing in the wind. It was about 9:30 PM, clear skies and dark. I sure am sorry that you are unable to see what my son and I are seeing. I sure hope one day everybody will get to experience what we are getting to see. Good luck in your search!\n\nJune 18, 2005: René Becker writes: Last night we saw three fireflies in my friend's backyard in Roermond, in south of the Netherlands. The yard is rather light, even at night. It is close to water, though. Two or three of the bugs were flying around and another one was having a rest (at least, it was lying still). We picked the last one up, put it on the table and shot some pictures of it. We hadn't seen any before and we were quite surprised to find them here in the Netherlands.\n\nJune 18, 2005: Terri Jalbert writes: Hi from Biddeford, Maine, on June 18, 2005. While looking out the second story window of my home, I observed about 18 different flashes in the field in front of the house. The field the fireflies occupy is natural (not cultivated) and is usually wet, but is very wet this year, due to the rainy spring. The temperature is about 58 at 10 PM. We have lived here since 2001, and have observed the fireflies every year. They are a wonderful sight and I pray they continue every year.\n\nJune 18, 2005: Julie Miller writes: My husband and I have five children 2, 4, 6, 8 and 9 years old and we live in Anderson, South Carolina. I grew up here in the upstate of South Carolina and my husband grew up about two hours away in Stone Mountain, Georgia. We were surfing the internet to see what fireflies eat. Our children caught about fifty fireflies each last night in Stone Mountain, Georgia . We had no idea or had never thought about it, but catching these little night lights for our bedroom night stand is a common activity on summer nights both here in South Carolina and in Georgia. It was a joy for us as children and a joy for our children now. Our older two have said they would catch them and send them to you so you could too enjoy the light show. We also found out the life expectancy was only a few days to a week. So, I don't guess they would travel too well by mail. As a side note, we don't live in a big city and do not have city bug spray trucks. However, Stone Mountain is a suburb of Atlanta and they do spray for bugs. Hope this information is useful.\n\nJune 17, 2005: Rachel Hale notes: I live in a small farming village in south Louisiana on a farm. As a child there were fireflies all over the place. Now there are none. I mean I never see any! I assumed that perhaps it was because of the spray that the parish \"mosquito man\" sprays eliminated them. However, I'm visitig in Atlanta, Georgia ...smack in the middle of Buckhead and there are fireflies all over here. I know there must be a \"mosquito man\" here too. And this addresses your comment about the city lights. If you find any information about breading/raising fire flies, please let me know. Thank You\n\nJune 16, 2005: A reader writes: Hey. I had quite a few fireflies flying around 2 weeks ago in my back yard. I live in Hollywood, Florida, in an urban setting. Just wanted to let you know. We have a golf coarse behind the house and some watery area. They tease me when I try and catch them. They're hard to get and I don't wanna do any damage to them so I try and just sit back and watch them do their thing. I know what you're talking about with the levels going down. I'm only 20 and even 10 years ago I remember places at night being swarmed with em. Now only the occasional few will grace the area if we're lucky. I'm sure global warming and the low water levels can contribute to their decline. As they can be contributed to the decline of many species around here, along with over-development and apathy among the people. Anyhow, I was wondering if you're aware of any good spots around South Florida where one might be able to do some firefly watching, maybe take some photographs or just play around. Anyhow, I'd love to know. Thanks for the great info on the website. Good luck with your research. I'd love to stay updated on how our populations down south are doin! Take care.\n\nJune 15, 2005: A reader writes: I am from Sonoma County, California, and I have identified a glow worm. I have never seen one before. It is a fascinating little creature! Are they suppose to be here?\n\nJune 14, 2005: A reader writes: Hello there. I moved to the US from Ireland last summer.
