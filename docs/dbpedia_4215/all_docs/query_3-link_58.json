The plan in brief, as Mr. Crowther outlined it in an interview in the offices of his publishers, Doubleday Doran, would be to stimulate business by making money available for industrialists and merchants through the granting and accepting of promissory notes for all debts.\" What, however, deserves particular emphasis is the further statement that \"Unless this plan is put into effect,\" Mr. Crowther added,\"the United States will be forced to go off the gold standard in 60 days.\" The United States to be forced off the gold standard in 60 days! How preposterous. We have no hesitation in saying that if all the foreign banks withdrew every dollar of the gold they have on deposit in the United States the country would still rest securely on the gold basis. It holds a position of unimpregnable strength in that respect. As bearing upon the operation of the Recons truction Finance Corporation it is worth noting that money for this corporation as well as for other rehabilitation projects such as an increase in the capital of the Farm Land Banks, is being made immediately available through two new issues of'Treasury certificates of indebtedness aggregating $350,000,000 which Andrew W.Mellon, Secretary of the Treasury, announced on Monday,saying at the same time that \"the certificates are being issued to make funds available to meet the initial needs under the President's emergency program and will also provide for the payment of $60,000,000 of maturing Treasury bills. The new certificates are in two series, both dated and bearing interest from Feb.1 1932, the one series running for six months and being payable on Aug. 1 1932, with interest at the rate of 3 % per annum, / 1 2 and the other running for a year and payable on Feb. 1 1933, with interest at the rate of 33 4% per annum. The offering said that \"The amount of each series to be issued will be in a proportion that 'the total subscriptions for that series bears to the total subscri ption received for both series, the aggregate amoun t of the two series to be $350,000,000, or thereabouts. \" Of course both issues were oversubscribed. Total subscriptions amounted to $646,091,000, of which $395,943,000 was for the short-term issue bearing W interest and running for six months, s% and $250,158,000 was for the 12 -month certificates bearing 334% interest. The allotments were $228,0 00,000 for the six months 31 8% certificates and $145,0 / 00,000 for the 12 months 33 4% certificates. There are no striking changes the present week in the returns of the Federal Reserve banks. The acceptance holdings of the 12 Reserve institutions show a further reduction the past week from $188,041,000 to $162,261,000, indicating that the Reserve banks were unable to obtain fresh supplies of bills, notwithstanding the reduction made in the buying rate for bills two weeks ago. On the other hand, the total of bills held for foreign correspondents increased further during the week from $285,299,000 to ;304,777,000, purchases of bills for account of these foreign banks being presumably at lower rates than those established 'by the Reserve banks themselves. The discount holdings of the 12 Reserve banks are somewhat higher the present week at $837,639,000 against $818,986,000. The holdings of United States 713 Government securities are virtually unchanged, as far as the total holdings are concerned (though some of the separate items making up the total have changed), at $751,716,000 this week against $751,068,000 a week ago. The final result is that total bill and security holdings, which measure the volume of Reserve credit outstanding, are slightly lower at $1,787,912,000 Jan.27 against $1,795,341,000 Jan. 20. Gold reserves have diminished during the week from $3,005,914,000 to $2,986,986,000, but the amount of Federal Reserve notes in circulation this time also shows a reduction, having fallen from ;2,642,140,000 on Jan. 20 to $2,627,296,000 on Jan. 27. As a consequence, the ratio of reserves to deposit and Federal Reserve note liabilities combined has increased a trifle, being 67.4% this week against 67.3% last week. The deposits of foreign banks with the Reserve institutions have decreased during the week from $81,830,000 to $79,937,000. It would not be easy to overestimate the loss to the country by the death last Sunday evening of Paul M. Warburg. In the part Mr. Warburg played in the establishment of the country's banking system, as it exists to-day, he rendered incalculable service to the country. Prior to the establishment of our Federal Reserve System the country had no banking system worthy of the name. His part in laying the foundation for the new system probably exceeded that rendered by any other single individual. Coming from a family of bankers and having a thorough understanding of the principles of banking, he was just the man needed for the occasion when he came to the United States and made it the country of his adoption, quickly recognizing how it was lacking in the first essentials of a genuine banking system. It is common to refer to the part played by him in the formative stages of the Reserve System, he having been for the first four years of the operation of the Reserve banks a member of the Federal Reserve Board, and for the last two of the four years the Vice-Governor. Mr. Warburg certainly served with great distinction during this period and rendered invaluable aid in laying the foundation of the system on a sound and secure basis. But in our estimation he is entitled to even greater credit for what he did in paving the way for the establishment of a banking system of the right sort. In the long preliminary work that was necessary to the creation of a comprehensive banking system on an enduring basis, he proved to be the man of the hour. Public opinion had to be educated up to the point where there would be a realization of just what was needed for the purpose. Here he labored with indefatigable energy, in season and out of season, and against obstacles which would have daunted the ordinary man. The zeal he now showed has never been surpassed anywhere. He made addresses and prepared papers that wilL outlast time, and by working In conjunction with Senator Aldrich helped the latter to attain the fame. which he so securely holds as a financial legislator of the finest type. The two massive volumes, in the best style of book work, which Mr. Warbu rg brought out in 1930 tell the story of these early struggles in illuminating fashion and at the same time they form a most valuable contribution to the literature on the subject. For all of this the country owes Mr. Warburg a debt of gratitude which it can never repay. His passing away at this time is especially to be 714 FINANCIAL CHRONICLE deplored, because of the wise council that he might have given had he lived, in the amendments to the Reserve System that are contemplated as a result of the experience gained in the period of stock market inflation which ended so disastrously in 1929—not without warning from Mr. Warburg. The stock market this week has moved irregularly lower and has had two main features, namely, the publication of the income returns for the December quarter and the calendar year of two of the largest companies in the steel trade, and the course of the conferences between the railroad executives and the heads of the different railroad brotherhoods on the subject of the lowering of wage scales. These conferences proceeded in the same weary way as in other recent weeks,and did not yield anything like definite results, although Thursday evening news came that all of the 20 different labor unions had reached a conclusion in the matter and that conclusion was in favor of a 10% reduction, but limited to the period of a single year. On Friday, however, it appeared that the conferees were still debating the subject. The report of the United States Steel Corp. had been looked forward to with great interest, and no little anxiety, and it came promptly after the close of business on Tuesday. It made a worse exhibit than anyone had looked for. There had been considerable discussion as to what action would be taken on the dividend on the common shares,of the company. The doubt was dispelled in the reducing of 2 1 the dividend for the quarter to only /of 1%. Not only that, but a statement was given out by the Board of Directors saying that during the year 1931 nothing had been earned upon the common shares, the total distribution in 1931 (approximately $43,500,000) in dividends on such shares having been taken from surplus. The further statement was made that it would be manifest that continuance of dividends must depend upon an improvement in the corporation's volume of business and earnings. As a result of this action and announcement, U. S. Steel / common opened Wednesday 134 points off from the close on Tuesday, and touched 37% later in the day. It fell still lower on Friday, to 36%, closing yesterday at 37% against 42% on Friday of last week. The Bethlehem Steel statement was issued after the close of business on Thursday, and was equally bad, no more than $115,745 having been earned to pay the $6,895,000 dividends on the preferred stock. The directors declared the regular quarterly dividend on the preferred stock, but decided to omit the dividend on the common stock. Bethlehem Steel common / dropped to 1518 yesterday and closed at 16 against / 191 8 the close on Friday of last week. There have been quite a number of other dividend reductions and omissions during the week. The dividend suspensions include that of the Childs Co. on the 7% cum. pref. stock; the General Refactories Co. in the quarterly dividend on its capital stock; the Hart, Schaffner & Marx on common; the Intertype Corp.also on common;the New River Co. on accumulations on the preferred stock; the Pittsburgh United Corp. on the 7% cum. cony. pref.; Poor & Co. on the class A preference stock; the Colorado Fuel & Iron Co. on the 8% cumul. pref. stock; Fairbanks, Morse & Co. on the 7% cumul. pref. stock; McCrory Stores Corp. on the com. and class B corn. stocks; Savage Arms Corp.on the 6% non-cumul. pref.stock,and the Hamilton Watch Co. on its 6% cumul. pref. stock. [VOL. 134. Among the dividend reductions the Vulcan Detinning Co. decreased its guar. div. on common from $1 a share to 50c. a share; the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Co. cut its quar. div.from 30c. a share to 25c. a share; the Inland Steel Co. reduced the dividend on common from 50c. a share to 25c. a share; the Gorham Mfg.

A tense situation with dangerous international possibilities has again developed between Japan and China, as the result of a new Japanese military expedition in the native areas of Shanghai, designed to terminate anti-Japanese propaganda and the boycott on Japanese goods. After a series of ultimatums by Japanese commanders, demanding the immediate suppression of anti-Japanese organizations, troops from the vessels stationed at the chief Treaty Port of China were landed, Thursday, and a determined attack launched on the Chinese districts of the city. Serious fighting promptly developed, as the Chinese Government had previously assembled some thousands of crack troops in the area, but the contestants tried to avoid the international settlement of the city. This latest phase of the Japanese activities on the mainland of Asia was observed with undisguised concern in Washington. Efforts were instituted to insure joint action with Great Britain under the Nine Power Treaty, but it appears unlikely that London will consent to'any drastic action in that respect. It was recalled in London that a somewhat similar action by British troops was necessary four years ago to impress upon the Chinese the desirability of observing their engagements with respect to treaty areas. Bitterness against the Japanese has prevailed in China ever since the Manchurian occupation began last September. The complete success of the Japanese in recent weeks aroused Chinese feelings to a pitch somewhat out of tune with the supine attitude of the Nanking Government and the Chinese people during the Japanese advance. The resentment found expression in the proverbial Chinese fashion of a huge organized 'boycott against Japanese goods. Strenuous diplomatic efforts were made by the Tokio Government to prevent such tactics, but they were un availing. More recently, Japanese susceptibilities were seriously offended when, on the occasion of the attempted assassination of the Japanese Emperor, Hirohito, regrets were expressed in no uncertain terms by Chinese journals regarding the assassin's lack of success. Matters became menacing last week, when members of an anti-Japanese organization in Shanghai attacked and seriously injured five Japanese monks. This was followed by reprisals and a sharply stiffened attitude on the part of the Japanese authorities. It became apparent, late last week, that a serious clash might occur at'any time between the Chinese and Japanese. Rear Admiral Koichi Shiosawa, Commander of the Japanese fleet regularly stationed in the Whangpo River off Shanghai, issued the first of his\"ultimatums\"demanding an end of anti-Japanese activities late Jan.22. He demanded that the organizations cease functioning in the foreign settlements as well as in the native cities. The authorities of the International Settlement, who are mostly British, instantly recognized the danger inherent in any Japanese action within the Settlement, and they requested a statement of intentions from the Japanese Admiral. In the event he considered force necessary within the Settlement, he would first consult the authorities, Admiral Shiosawa said. Five additional [Vol. 134. Japanese warships reached Shanghai last Saturday, and the Japanese forces in the International Settle ment were augmented by 400 marines landed from these ships. The Chinese authorities of the native city of Shanghai promised last Saturday that they would reply the following day to the Japanese demands. Failure to comply, an official Japanese statement said, would be followed by occupation of all the Chinese territory immediately surrounding the foreign settlements of Shanghai. A series of conferences between Japanese ConsulGeneral Murai and General Wu Te-chen, the Mayor of the Chinese city, last Sunday and Monday, produced little more than requests for delays on the part of the Chinese. There was an obvious lack of unanimity at Nanking on this matter, and as a result the resignations of Foreign Minister Eugene Chen and Premier Sun Fo were successively announced Monday. Mr. Chen issued a statement placing the blame for the passive Chinese policy on General Chiang Kai-shek, who, he said, held all the reins of government in his hands despite his nominal resignation some weeks ago. Mr. Mural, after his conferences with General Wu, declared flatly that Japan would wait a \"reasonable time\" for a satisfactory answer to the demand for suppression of anti-Japanese activities, and would then take \"necessary and appropriate measures for self-protection.\" There was little doubt thereafter that the Japanese would soon embark on a new military. adventure in the Shanghai area, and discussion turned to the possible extent of the movement. In this connection a reassuring statement was issued Tuesday by officials in Tokio, who said there would be no naval blockade of Shanghai and no interference of any kind with the jurisdiction of the foreign settlements. With a Japanese attack expected momentarily,the Chinese garrison of the native city began making hasty preparations early Wednesday for the defense of the area. Events moved quickly thereafter. Late Wednesday the Japanese Consul-General presented a \"final\" ultimatum to Mayor Wu Te-chen demanding unqualified agreement to the Japanese requests on pain of drastic measures. The ultimatum expired at 6 o'clock Thursday evening. General Wu responded with an order for the suppression of antiJapanese associations. \"The Mayor's statement does not refer directly to the Japanese demands, and it certainly will prove unsatisfactory to the Japanese,\" a Shanghai dispatch of Thursday to the New York \"Times\"said. Additional Japanese warships arrived at Shanghai during the day, and more troops were landed. It was estimated that 4,000 Japanese marines were on duty in the foreign settlement, while 25,000 Chinese troops were assembled for the defense of the Chinese areas. Foreigners living outside the foreign settlement were \"advised\" by the Japanese to come inside. Great numbers of panic-stricken Chinese also moved to the borders of the International Settlement. In some parts of the Chinese city the Chinese troops were reported to be on one of their usual looting expeditions. In Tokio official circles it was indicated that any action taken would be strictly limited and would not represent a foretaste of similar measures in other parts of China. Invasion of the Chinese areas of Shanghai by the Japanese began at midnight, Thursday, notwithstanding a reply to the Japanese ultimatum which wassaid to accede'to all the demands. Admiral Shiosawa issued a statement Thursday evening in which JAN. 30 1932.] FINANCIAL CHRONICLE 717 he outlined the steps to be taken.

He will confer on the subject with Tsuneo Matsudaira, the Japanese Ambassador to London, who is now in Geneva. It was stated in London that no notes have been exchanged with Tokio since the current situation developed. The conversations between Washington and London are of an informal nature, it was added, and have for their object merely the best means of safeguarding the lives and the vast commercial interests of foreigners in the Yangtze Valley. \"Both Governments recognize the vital necessity for avoiding a situation which might induce an irresponsible Chinese Government to declare war on Japan,\" it was said in a report to the New York \"Times.\" \"The situation is not simplefrom the economic or political viewpoints. Next to having difficulties with the Chinese, the worst posible handicap for British commercial enterprise in China would be to have friction with the Japanese. But Great Britain's own policy in the past in China, and particularly in Shanghai when she was herself the victim of a Chinese boycott and violence, is a factor that now makes it difficult, if not impossible, to criticize Japan for taking the same course to protect herself against the same sort of Chinese hostility.\" Tokio reports received yesterday indicated that a good deal of surprise was occasioned in Japanese official circles by the perturbation at Washington regarding the Japanese action at Shanghai. \"A For. eign Office spokesman declared,\" it was reported in a dispatch to the New York \"Times,\" \"that Japan did not want to aggravate the situation and reiterated that Japan would not in any way interfere with the International Settlement or take any action in it, but would limit her present measures to closing the premises of the anti-Japanese associations outside the Settlement and restoring confiscated Japanese merchandise to the owners. Commenting on press telegrams stating that Secretary Stimson was consulting with Sir Ronald Lindsay regarding an economic boycott or other measures, the spokesman said the American press seemed too ready to accept unfounded alarmist reports.\" It was made plain, in addition, that the reply of Mayor Wu to the Japanese demands, Thursday, was unsatisfactory, as it proposed to close only one anti-Japanese association. It was disclosed yesterday both in London and Washington that the Japanese Government, in answer to inquiries, had informed Great Britain and the United States that no action affecting the International Settlement at Shanghai would be taken without previous consultation with other Powers. reThe troubled situation in the Far East caused in both capitals. After a long Cabinet newed concern meeting in Washington, Secretary Stimson issued es that a statement indicating the receipt of assuranc in Shanghai would international rights and interests had not be interfered with by Japan.

[vol.. 134. some debts. The informal conversations on the subject between the British and French Governments, which 'began while the Young Plan Advisory Committee was still in session at Basle, were resumed, Monday. Lord Tyrrell, British Ambassador to France, called on Premier Pierre Laval that day and submitted proposals which were believed to suggest the calling of the postponed Lausanne conference of interested governments in June. The plan was said to include also a further moratorium on reparations payments. Some reports indicated that payments would be suspended, under the plan, for a full year from July 1, while others stated that the moratorium would expire before Dec. 15, when the next debt payments to the United States are due. There was general agreement, however, that Premier Laval rejected the suggestion for a moratorium on the ground that it infringed on the Young Plan. The persistent British efforts to reach a preliminary accord with France on this matter thus again proved unsuccessful. \"The more the British exert themselves to get the French to budge from their position, the less success they seem to have,\" a Paris dispatch of Tuesday to the New York \"Times\" remarked. The suggestion for a meeting of the British and French Premiers was not renewed this week, and it was stated in the \"Times\" report that such direct conversations •are unlikely unless a change occurs in the French position. Although some question was recently expressed in Paris regarding the renewal by the Bank of France of its share of the $100,000,000 credit extended the Reichsbank last summer, directors of the institution voted Thursday to continue the credit for one month from the next due date, Feb. 4. At Geneva the Council of the League of Nations began last Monday its regular meeting for the discussion of the crowded agenda of international problems. There were few developments in the session, despite the importance of the questions troubling all nations and the need for adjustments in all directions. Perhaps the most important incident was the announcement, Monday, that Sir Eric Drummond, Secretary-General of the League, will resign his post early next year. The Council treated this action as a \"grave\" event, a dispatch to the New York \"Times\" said, and tried to persuade Sir Eric to retain the office, but these efforts are said to have been fruitless. The leading Ministers of Europe were unable to attend the 'Council meeting, and the session was further subdued 'by the absence of Aristide Briand, former Foreign Minister of France, who usually dominated the gatherings. The Council was occuppied chiefly with extensive hearings on the SinoJapanese dispute, Dr. W. W. Yen presenting the Chinese side, while Naotake Sato spoke for Japan. A decision was reached, Thursday, to give complete support to the note of Jan. 7, dispatched by Secretary of State Stimson to Japan, calling for maintenance of the Open Door policy in Manchuria. Approval \"in principle\" was expressed on the same day of the British proposal to grant independence to Irak. A committee of the Council began, Tuesday, to examine a report dealing with the question of slavery in Liberia. Repayment by the Bank of England of the remainthis There was again a notable lack of progress ing sums due on the $250,000,000 credit granted the week in ,the international discussion of the German con- institution last August by the Bank of France and reparations problem, owing to the political the Federal Reserve Banks will be completed next ditions which are so firm a part of these unwhole- JAN. 30 1932.] FINANCIAL CHRONICLE Monday and the credit terminated. A brief announcement to this effect was made by the Bank of England Jan. 25, and it was further stated that the repayment will not involve any reduction in the Bank's gold reserves. The £50,000,000 credit was granted the British bank in equal amounts by the French and American banks of issue for the defense of sterling. It was exhausted three weeks after it was opened, on Aug. 1. The funds were made available originally for a period of three months through the purchase by the two creditors of prime sterling bills. Contrary to general expectations, the Bank of England was able to effect repayment of £20,000,000 by Nov. 1, close to £15,000,000 in gold being utilized for the purpose. The remainder of the credit, or £30,000,000 in all, was extended for a further period of three months with the French and American banks again participating equally. Termination of the credit at this time occasioned no surprise in any quarter, partly because of the extensive repayment already made and partly because it was well understood that the Bank of England was making little, if any, use of the funds. The action caused much satisfaction in all financial centers, as it illustrates once again the impressive strength of the British bank. It is suggested that the heavy flow of gold from India, amounting to about £30,000,000 since Sept. 21, proved indirectly helpful in enabling the Bank to arrange for a discontinuance of the credit which really appears not to have been in use recently. This credit, of course, is quite apart from the £80,000,000 advanced the British Treasury in equal amounts by private bankers of France and the United States on Aug. 28 for the defense of sterling. It is not believed that any arrangements have so far been made for repayment of the latter sum, which was made available for one year. 719 5,360,000,000 marks, or $1,275,680,000 at par* of exchange. With the exception of reservations by the Swedish delegates regarding the conversion of credits, complete unanimity prevailed among the foreign creditors, a Berlin dispatch to the New York \"Times\" states. \"It was emphasized at to-day's adjournment that the negotiations throughout had been conducted in a cordial spirit of co-operation,\" the dispatch added. In announcing the agreement, Mr. Wiggin made plain that it was found necessary to revise the original plan in many details on the basis of the six months of experience with its working. The interests of the banking creditors of the different countries naturally vary, he said, and full consideration had to be given to the viewpoints of all concerned. The German representatives made a thorough examination of every point of the new agreement before signing it, Mr. Wiggin remarked. It was evident, he added, that they would do their utmost to carry out its provisions. \"They have been properly concerned to make no commitments which they could not fulfill, and it is evident they believe in the essential stability of German finance, feeling confident of their ability to protect it,\" Mr. Wiggin declared. The foreign creditors were represented as coming away from the conference with great respect for the German leaders with whom they had to deal. Outlines of the complete report and agreement, as cabled to New York, indicate that the short-term creditors feel they have now done everything possible to insure a period of recuperation for Germany. Account was taken of the efforts and sacrifices made by the German Government and people to maintain their position in the midst of the unprecedented difficulties'of the present depression. \"While German economy possesses within itself immense recuperative powers, which will manifest themselves as more favorable world conditions emerge, it is imperative A new agreement which modifies in some respects that the hindrances to such development should be and extends for one year the \"stillhaltung\" arrange removed,\" the report states. \"It will not come withment on the short-term obligations of German banks out positive action by the governments and peoples and private debtors to those of other nations was in the sphere of international co-operation, and, as concluded in Berlin last Saturday, after six weeks both Basle committees have urged, there is no time of negotiations.

With reviving confidence, the German internal money market will receive substantial relief from this source. \"The return of 300,000,000 to 400,000,000 marks would ease the money market considerably,\" it is said,\"and interest rates would decline. Return to the banks of the whole 1,000,000,000 marks hoarded would permit them to make a commensurate reduction of rediscounts at the Reichsbank, while permitting the Reichsbank's note circulation to decline commensurately would mean a sharp rise in the gold and foreign exchange percentage at the Reichsbank and a marked improvement in Germany's credit at home and abroad.\" The work of the Committee can constitute no permanent solution of Germany's credit problem, the report continues. The credit problem is not solved, it is stated, when reluctant creditors agree to prolong the credit out of consideration for a debtor who is embarrassed and out of consideration for the general economic situation of the whole world, in which the debtor occupies a vitally important place. \"The credit problem is solved when the creditors cheerfully and confidently continue credits which they might withdraw at their own convenience,\" the bankers point out. \"The all-important thing is to restore the basis of credit. It is obvious that a settlement of Germany's international payments is a vital element in this problem, as indeed are the interAllied debts, which are in intimate economic connection with them. But these questions, although they profoundly affect private credit, cannot be solved by bankers. The Committee can only repeat that they indorse all that has been said by the Basle committees on this problem. \"Finally, the Committee would emphasize that the whole fabric of international credit is essentially dependent upon an adequate movement of goodsfrom one country to another. Germany can make payments to the world outside only if she can send out an export surplus of goods. Developments in recent months have stripped the problem to its essentials. Vast periodic payments cannot be made with gold. There is not enough gold for this abnormal use. In normal international financial relations, gold is used only in settling moderate balances. Germany has already gone as far as her creditors can ask in paying with gold. She has turned vigorously and courageously 'to the ultimate resource—the normal and sound method of payment in goods and services, and she has created in recent months a very large surplus. But her opportunities for export have lately been restricted by the fact that several countries have gone off the gold standard. Exports to some countries have been sharply limited by restrictions on foreign exchange transactions. And, finally, tariff barriers are growing higher and higher. \"The nations of the world are contending with each other for a disproportionate share of a dwindling world trade. With a different policy they could share with one another an expanding world trade. It is essential that trade policy should permit goods to move in settlement of international debts and that countries should make markets for one another. With trade lines open, labor now idle in one country could be at work producing goods for exchange for goods which would be produced by labor now idle in [VOL. 134. another country. Each is capable of producing goods that the other wants. Each, if allowed a place in the other's market, would obtain income thereby with which it could purchase from the other goods which it wants. But trade barriers stand between them and both remain idle.\" In the official summary of the agreement itself, it is remarked that the standstill agreement has no direct concern with the German Government debt. It is concerned with the short-term debt of German banks and businesses to foreign banks. These shortterm debts represent funds used for business purposes, which on the whole were soundly used. The money was taken in good faith and in good faith the German debtors mean to repay. This is abundantly demonstrated by the magnitude of the repayments which have already been made, amounting to' 5,000,000,000 marks since the autumn of 1930, it is' held. In the flexible plan now provided, the reduction of the standstill debt which has taken place under the first agreement is recognized in a 10% reduction of the credit lines as they existed at the time that agreement began. Not all the creditors received 10%, however, some receiving more and others less. Accordingly, future cash payments are to be made first to those creditors who have so far received the least and the inequalities will thus be rectified. For the guidance of the Committee representing the creditors which will be set up, arrangements are being made for continuous information on incoming and outgoing foreign exchange, and on all payments under the standstill agreement or otherwise. The future schedule of payments determined in the light of such information will safeguard both the Reichsbank and the standstill creditors, it is said. Steps also are being taken to insure that German resources will not be dissipated to meet claims outside the standstill agreement. For this purpose the German Government, with the concurrence of the Reichsbank, will set up a committee on foreign debts to exercise general control of all payments. In addition, machinery has been provided for the conversion, at the option of the creditor, of cash advances to German banks into 10-year notes bearing 6% interest. Special security is to be provided for such notes, as an inducement to conversion. A further important provision for encouraging the conversion of shortterm into long-term debt is one which gives the foreign creditor the right to convert unsecured cash balances into \"blocked investments\" in Germany. Investments made under this provision may not be resold without the approval of the Reichsbank for a period of five years. To the extent that the shortterm debt can be funded, the acute problem of Germany's relations with outside creditors is solved, it is stated, as Germany's private debtors will be able to pay interest on the existing short-term debt and a moderate amortization. As an important factor of safety for the debts included in the agreement, the co-operation of the Deutsche Gold Diskontbank is to be continued. Serious political differences on the tariff question •developed among the members of the National Government of Great Britain late last week, and for a time it appeared that important changes in the Cabinet might follow.

Gold now aggregates 70,689,195,133 francs, in comparison with 55,043,841,497 francs a year ago. French commercial bills discounted and creditor current accounts increased 306,000,000 francs and 524,000,000 francs, while advances against securities fell off 86,000,000 francs. Notes in circulation reveal a loss of 644,000,000 francs, reducing total of notes outstanding to 83,363,657,935 francs. Total circulation last year was 76,539,270,160 francs and the year before it was 68,374,616,860 francs. Credit balances abroad and bills bought abroad show decreases of 951,000,000 francs and 24,000,000 francs respectively.

Some interest was occasioned by the reductions in the rediscount rates of the Richmond and Dallas Federal Reserve Banks to the 33/2% level from the former rates of 4%, these steps being announced Jan. 23 and 27, respectively. It was thought for a time that these reductions might presage a lowering in other centers, but no other changes were announced. Call loans on the New York Stock Exchange were again 23/2% for all transactions, with the supply of funds plentiful. Offerings at concessions in the unofficial \"street\" market were meager, however, funds being available at lower rates only Monday and yesterday, when 231% was quoted for short periods and for limited amounts. Time money was unchanged all week. Brokers loans continued their downward tendency, the report of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showing a reduction of $18,000,000 for the week to Wednesday night. Gold movements reported by the Reserve Bank for the same period were rather heavy, but they consisted in good part of the withdrawal for shipment of earmarked stocks. Actual exports were $34,020,000, this figure being partly offset by imports of $1,554,000 and a net reduction of $8,602,000 in earmarked metal. Dealing in detail with call loan rates on the Stock Exchange from day to day, 23% was the rate ruling all through the week for both new loans and renewals. The time money market remained practically at a standstill this week and very little interest has been shown in this section of the money market. Rates are nominally quoted at 332@3%% for all maturities. The market for prime commercial paper has been fairly brisk this week but the scarcity of satisfactory offerings shortened the market to a considerable extent. Rates are unchanged. Quotations for choice names of four to six months' maturity are 3%@4 3%. Names less well known are 432%. On some very high class 90-day paper occasional transactions at 33/2% continued to be noted. The market for prime bankers' acceptances was in fairly good supply on Monday, but the offerings fell off as the week progressed and dealers were unable to meet the daily requirements. Rates remain unchanged. The quotations of the American Acceptance Council for bills up to 90 days are 2%% bid, 2%% asked;for four months' bills, 314 bid,3% asked; for five and six months, 39/i bid and 33j% asked. The bill buying rate of the New York Reserve Bank remains unchanged at 2% on maturities up to 45 days, 3% on maturities of 46 to 120 days and at 334.% on maturities of 121 to 180 days. The Federal Reserve banks again show a falling off this week in their holdings of acceptances, the total having dropped from $188,041,000 to $162,261,000. Their holdings of acceptances for foreign correspondents further increased from $285,299,000 to $304,777,000.

From Saturday until Wednesday there were the same evidences of hesitancy in trading which characterized the market last week, as bankers on both sides of the water were expecting a reduction in bank rates both in London and in New York. Their conviction that changes were contemplated were strengthened by the fact that the Federal Reserve banks of Richmond, St. Louis and Dallas reduced their rates of rediscount fractionally early this week. However, no change in rates took place either in London or New York. The range this week has been from 3.423 to 3.467 for bankers' % A sight bills, compared with 3.44 to 3.493 last week. The range for cable transfers has been from 3.43 to 3.47/, compared with 3.443/ to 3.493/ a week ago. Bankers still expect that the Bank of England will soon reduce its rediscount rate from the present high level of 6%, as open market discount rates in London show decided signs of weakening. It is thought, however, that the Bank may keep its rediscount rate at the present level until the international financial outlook is clearer. The market is less inclined to believe that there will be any immediate lowering of the New York Reserve bank's rediscount rate. The Bank of England's rate has been at 6% since Sept. 21, when England suspended gold payments. The present steadiness in sterling exchange is due largely to seasonal factors. Sterling futures are now at a premium, whereas a little more than a week ago they were quoted at a slight discount. The belief is growing that the value of the pound is intrinsically higher than the exchange quotation would indicate. Steadiness in the rates is also attributable in some measure to the refusal of the British people to become panic-stricken whenever the sterling quotation declines. In regard to this, Samuel Montagu & Co. of London stated in a recent letter: \"The wonderful steadiness of the British people in the face of political and economic crisis has been remarkable. The absence of panic or of a rush to invest money abroad shows that the people of these islands have not lost faith in the pound sterling or in the recuperative powers of the British nation. It is natural that the pound should lose some of its purchasing power abroad, but the internal purchasing power of the pound note remains unchanged.\" Foreign exchange circles state that sterling is being supported by French pegging operations. There is a systematic transfer of French balances from London to Paris by way of New York. French banking interests, 723 it is pointed out, are apparently controlling the sterling market to insure an orderly transfer of these funds. The operation, it appears, begins with sterling, which is sold against dollars for French account. The next step is the purchase of francs, for which there is a steady demand in the exchange market. The sterling balances are being transferred to New York, it is explained, for two reasons: First, because the sterling-franc market is too thin to allow successful operation; second, gold can be obtained in New York for shipment to Paris whenever the exchange rates permit the purchase of the metal. The French are also said to be capitalizing the seasonal trends. Normally for the next few months sterling receives support against dollars for commercial requirements. This support was strongly apparent during the latter part of this week. A fluctuating rate would interfere with the French program and consequently foreign exchange brokers state, at any sign of weakening in the sterling rate a French bid of substantial size will appear just below the market. This, coupled with the normal seasonal demand, is said to be sufficient to discourage the formation of a substantial short interest. The heavy sales of Indian gold in the London open market are also providing a cushion against a decline in sterling. Estimates regarding the amount of commercial gold in India available for export vary widely, but it is generally believed that the sum total is large enough to have an important bearing on Great Britain's monetary position, so long as the factors now favoring Indian gold sales continue.• Agents of the Indian private bankers are scouring all India for gold and these purchases are pouring into Bombay from up-country for export to London in the form of ornaments, rough ingots, and commercial bars. Since England went off the gold standard exports of Indian gold have amounted to more than £20,000,000. More will be sent so long as the premium on gold continues. The Iildian \"shroffs,\" or private bankers, who have been in the gold trade for generations, estimate that there must be at least £1,500,000,000 of hoarded gold in India. Official returns show that the net import of gold into India since 1900 amounts to 065,000,000. In the degree in which sterling appreciates in New York the premium on gold has a tendency to decrease. Traders report that the position of sterling exchange is growing stronger in this market. This week considerable pressure was lifted from sterling when the Bank of England prepared to repay the last of its $75,000,000 credit due to the Federal Reserve banks at the end of this month and a similar amount owing to the Bank of France. It is understood in well-informed circles that the greater part of these credits, probably in excess of $60,000,000 in New York, has not been in use for many weeks, as the Bank of England was known to be selling sterling against dollars, in the past several weeks, whenever the market could stand the pressure, and in this way accumulated dollars. This week gold has been selling in the London open market at from 119s. 3d. to 120s. 9d. an ounce. The Bank of England statement for the week ended Jan. 27 shows a decided improvement. Gold holdings increased £28,662 to £121,349,833, which compares with £140,141,236 a year ago. The ratio on Jan. 27 moved up to 39.48% from 35.42% on Jan. 20. The present ratio compares with 49.41% a year ago. The improvement in the ratio is due partly to 724 FENANCIAL CHRONICLE [VoL. 134. aid materially in bringing the Canadian dollar back to par.\" ReferringitoTday-to-day rates, sterling exchange on Saturday last was dull and inclined to ease.
