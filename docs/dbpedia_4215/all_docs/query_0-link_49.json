        "text": "Posted by nathan lloyd | Published: 05/09/2016\n\nTwirlywoos come from far away and secretly interact with the real world, and on Sunday 4 September, Twirlywoos visited Central England Co-operative’s Stirchley food store as they embarked on a new adventure.\n\nTwirlywoos is a popular children’s pre-school comedy series from Ragdoll Productions, which encourages youngsters to think for themselves and gain confidence in their own perceptions of the world. These naïve, joyous little creatures learn and experiment both outside in the big world (at Stirchley food store this time) and at home in their special red boat.\n\nAs a result of the filming, Central England Co-operative has donated their filming fee to their staff-elected corporate charity, Newlife Foundation for Disabled Children. Newlife is dedicated to providing guidance and practical support for children with disabilities and their families, and although Newlife is a national charity, every penny raised by Central England Co-operative is helping children in the Society’s trading area. So far, the partnership has raised £1.2million and helped fund specialist disability equipment for more than 520 children.\n\nChris Wood, Director, Ragdoll Productions Ltd and Producer, Twirlywoos, said: “Ragdoll thanks Central England Co-operative for all their help and assistance with the production of a new episode of their popular children’s programme, Twirlywoos, by granting filming facilities at their Stirchley store. Ragdoll is also delighted to know of their decision to donate their filming fee to Newlife Foundation, which is a very generous gesture to a worthwhile cause.”\n\nNewlife Head of Operations, Stephen Morgan, said: “Central England Co-operative have been doing an amazing job of supporting disabled children across their trading area through a range of fundraising activities. This donation from Ragdoll Productions will help another local child get the vital specialist equipment they need for everyday life. We’d like to thank everyone at Central England Co-operative for their continued support, which is helping to transform young lives.”\n\nThe Stirchley Co-operative store is open from 7am-10pm Monday – Friday, 7am-9pm Saturday and 10am-4pm on a Sunday. The store offers a wide range of products from everyday necessities to something a little more special. The store offer includes: fresh and local fruit and vegetables, an in-store bakery offering breads and pastries, chilled beers and wines, fresh and frozen product, Truly Irresistible product ranges, a Deli, a café, Costa Coffee, a fish counter, Brantano Shoes, The Works, Dorothy Perkins, Julian Charles, a key cutting service and electrical goods.\n\nThe store also offers; a travel agent, photo booth, Paypoint, Collect Plus, Lottery, foreign currency, a car park and a free cash machine.\n\nNotes to editors\n\nAbout Central England Co-operative\n\nCentral England Co-operative is one of the largest independent retail co-operative societies in the UK.

The Newlife Birth Defects Centre based at the Institute of Child Health is Europe’s first dedicated Birth Defects Research Centre.\n\n• To meet current demand, the charity needs over £8,000 a day to provide essential equipment such as wheelchairs, beds, walking frames, seating, safety equipment and communication aids to children nationwide.\n\n• Newlife does not receive any government funding and is reliant on income from its unique recycling operation, volunteers and supporters all over the UK and regional appeals to carry out its work. Newlife is one of the few national charities that actively offers donors/supporters the chance to ensure 100% of their gift is spent how they want it used - nothing taken out for admin etc.\n\n• Newlife recognises there are almost a million children in the UK with significant disabilities. It is believed that this number is increasing, as childhood deaths decrease due to improved treatment and management of prematurity, accidents, infections, cancers and inborn conditions.\n\nInformation on the charity can be found at www.newlifecharity.co.uk or the trading company at www.newlifetrading.co.uk.
