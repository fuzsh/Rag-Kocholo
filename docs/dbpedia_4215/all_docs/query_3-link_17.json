        "text": "TELETUBBIES\n\n(1997-2001)\n\nHERE’S some news to remind you of how you are getting older. In March, the Teletubbies will turn... FIFTEEN!\n\nYes, those ageless, rotund, playful things will be in the middle of their teenage angst.\n\nAimed at children from nine to 36 months, they were originally broadcast from March 31, 1997, until January 5, 2001.\n\nIn case you’ve forgotten these double BAFTA winners, narrated by Tim Whitnall, Toyah Willcox and Eric Sykes, one of the 365 episodes made can still be seen opening the 6am daily schedule on CBeebies.\n\nTinky Winky was the purple one with a triangular aerial on his head. The biggest Teletubby, he was also the most gentle and he just loved his red bag.\n\nDipsy was the green one, the second biggest Teletubby and the most stylish thanks to his black and white hat offering shades of the Monster Raving Loony Party’s late Lord Sutch.\n\nLaa-Laa was yellow, with a twirly aerial on her head and a fondness for a big, orange ball. Finally, Po was red and, although the smallest, was still distinctive thanks to a circular aerial on her head and a pink and blue scooter.\n\nAll four characters loved big hugs, but she loved them most of all.\n\nFilmed on a rolling landscape of green hills near Stratford-upon-Avon, they all lived in Teletubbyland where the important things in life were tubby toast, tubby custard and Noo-Noo, a vacuum cleaner with a conscience.\n\nAnne Wood, who created the series with Andrew Davenport, said: “Teletubbies is a responsible, enjoyable half-hour where our youngest viewers find their place – a playful, imaginative world inhabited by gentle, loving characters and experiencing everything around them.\n\n“The series is also a wonderful opportunity for parents to share the joy of first discovery through children’s eyes.”\n\nThe Teletubbies were taken to China in February 2006 and in March the following year they were invading New York City with a tour and pop-up shop.\n\nAs part of the tenth anniversary celebrations in 2007, parents, teens, tweens and adults of all ages were asked to ‘Take The Ten-Minute Teletubbies Test!’.\n\nThis global multi-media campaign asked viewers and consumers to watch the programme for 10 minutes, ready to share their reactions to it.\n\nNew toys included Tomy’s “super-soft huggable plush, Big Hug Laa-Laa and Po, which have a soothing night light in their tummy that glows and gently changes colour while playing a lullaby version of the Teletubbies theme tune, and say ‘Aaah’ when hugged and giggle when kissed on the nose.”\n\nIn January 2008, it was announced the Teletubbies would be hitting the road in the UK for the first time in December as part of the new CBeebies Live! Wonderlands tour.\n\nBy 2009 the series had been broadcast in more than 120 countries, and in September the Teletubbies were animated for a new DVD.\n\nIn January 2010 they were on their way to Australia for a tour of shopping centres.\n\nLater that year, Tomy launched the “Hug N Glo Po”. The instructions were to “Give Po a hug to hear a soothing lullaby and watch the soft glow of the tummy screen.”\n\nOn November 18, 2010, Anne Wood was awarded with yet another honour as part of her illustrious career, the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Mother & Baby Magazine Awards.\n\nAccepting the award, the former secondary school teacher, originally from County Durham, said: “Producing television for children has never been more challenging, as budgets for children’s programmes continue to shrink.\n\n“I am very appreciative of this recognition which reflects on the work of everyone at Ragdoll, who have worked so diligently on all our programmes over the past 26 years. I accept with huge pleasure on behalf of all of us.”\n\nOther characters with Anne’s stamp include Roland Rat, Rosie And Jim, Tots TV and Brum. More recent series include In The Night Garden and The Adventures Of Abney And Teal, who live on an island in the middle of a lake.\n\nThe question Anne has most often been asked is: “Why do you teach little kids ‘Eh-oh’ instead of proper English like ‘Hello?’ ”\n\nTo which Anne replies: “We never teach children to say ‘Eh-oh!’ – that’s just the way the Teletubbies say it.\n\n“All the children and adults in the programme say ‘Hello’.”\n\nGRAHAM YOUNG"
