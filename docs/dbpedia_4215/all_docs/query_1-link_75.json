        "text": "I’m a preschool animation script writer, author and illustrator, based in London. Thanks for visiting my site.\n\nBroadcast Credits\n\nI’m currently writing for Peppa Pig, season 5. Other credits include episodes of ‘Sarah and Duck’, ‘Olobob Top’, ‘Dipdap’, and ‘The Adventures of Abney and Teal’, all for CBeebies.\n\nI have written show bibles and pilot scripts, and enjoy working with companies to develop their ideas.\n\nBooks\n\nI write picture books for children, published by Walker. I write comics and drawing guides for adults, published by Penguin, Viking, Ivy Press, Abrams, and Cicada. My comic strips have featured in the Guardian, Vice, Glamour and Art Review magazines.\n\nMy first book, ‘Probably Nothing’ (Penguin, 2014), is a graphic memoir, or diary in the form of a comic, about being diagnosed with cancer during pregnancy. Since the book’s publication I’ve been a guest speaker at various Medical Humanities conferences, on topics to do with the interplay between comics and healthcare. I’m fine now and so is my son.\n\nTeaching\n\nI teach animation and visual communication on the Art Foundation course at Kingston University.\n\nEducation\n\nMA Animation, Royal College of Art, London.\n\nBA Illustration, University of Brighton.\n\nContact\n\nI’m always interested to hear about new offers of work. Email me or contact my agents, Emily Wraith at Berlin Associates (for TV) or Elinor Cooper at DKW (for books). Or find me on Twitter or LinkedIn.\n\nReference\n\n“Matilda has provided the majority of plot-lines for our writing, as well as much of the narration and many, many general ideas and lots of editorial work throughout the whole process. Her ideas have been consistently funny, original, surprising, and downright numerous and I basically can’t recommend her highly enough!”\n\nJoel Stewart, creator and director of The Adventures of Abney and Teal, August 2011."
