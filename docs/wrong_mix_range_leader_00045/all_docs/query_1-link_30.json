We have the chance to drive wider positive change, for the environment and for society.\n\nTaking a proactive approach to societal and environmental issues is not just a social responsibility; it’s also a matter of good guardianship. Businesses that are more sustainable in their operations and have a more diverse workforce are proven to deliver stronger performance.\n\nBusinesses that do good grow faster, and we want to help them do both. Our ambition is to create lasting, sustainable, positive impact, because that’s what we believe in.\n\nThe 30 million beneficiaries of Bridgepoint funds want us to generate healthy returns in a manner they can be proud of.\n\nSince the business was founded in 1985, our ambition has remained consistent: we create lasting, sustainable positive impact\n\nThat ambition is supported by four key beliefs that guide our investment decision-making.\n\n1. We believe that business can and should be a force for good. Growing businesses should benefit the communities in which they operate.\n\n2. We believe well-governed businesses perform better and are more resilient.\n\n3. We believe we must invest in our world. Environmental action is heralding a new era of innovation, productivity and sustainable growth. Climate change represents both an investment risk and opportunity.\n\n4. We believe in the power of the individual. By bringing diverse teams together we can deliver better performance by reflecting the world in which we operate."
