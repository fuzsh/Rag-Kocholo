        "text": "Firm Description\n\nAs a leading independent EU public affairs consultancy based in Brussels, NOVE’s journey is a tale of entrepreneurship and trust. Our success comes from the quality of our services and our commitment to our clients.\n\nWe base our work on the conviction that every client is unique, and on the ambition to ensure they are successful and impactful in their advocacy and engagement towards the European institutions and relevant stakeholders.\n\nWe rely on our consultants to make the difference. Our team is composed of around 30 colleagues representing more than 15 nationalities, including former EU insiders from the European Parliament, European political parties and Council Presidencies, as well as seasoned consultants with a strong network in the institutions and industry associations. This blend of insider knowledge and consulting expertise ensures our clients are always ahead, benefiting from timely intelligence on political and policy developments. Going beyond personal relationships, we always engage strategically with all policymakers and stakeholders.\n\nKey Strengths\n\nAs a fast-growing company, we work a little differently than most other agencies in the ‘EU bubble’. We have managed to overcome the challenge of scaling up as a small company by fostering our start-up mentality to make this a unique selling point.\n\nInnovation lies at the heart of NOVE. We continuously invest in our proprietary technology solutions, including an advanced knowledge and relationship management software. This commitment to technology not only enhances our service delivery but also keeps us at the forefront of the ongoing digital revolution.\n\nOur UNESCO-listed offices in Brussels are not just a workspace but a hub for connection. Here, we regularly organize exclusive networking events, providing our clients with invaluable opportunities to meet each other and engage with key European policymakers in a meaningful way.\n\nTestimonials and why clients like to work with us\n\nAlmost all clients who joined us upon our launch are still working with us. Since then, many companies, industry associations and patient organisations have entrusted us with directing their positioning and advocacy in the Brussels bubble.\n\nWe believe that a successful client-agency relationship is fundamentally based on passion, chemistry between people, and two-way trust in how we operate. This is why we aim at integrating ourselves early on and as much as possible with our clients. This investment allows us to be recognised as reliable partners, able to define the best path forward for our clients. It also explains why we prioritise long-term partnerships over short-term transactions."
