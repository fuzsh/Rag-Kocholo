        "text": "This chapter discusses education and training for public servants in the midst of Germany’s strong federal tradition and its different forms of state, with monarchies, city states, democracy, dictatorships, the division between East and West and, finally, re-unification. The chapter starts by examining the mainly monarchical, occasionally oligarchical, early modern administrative structures in Germany, and their lines of thought about public servants. In the nineteenth century, there were three different basic conceptions of public administration, two professional ones in Bavaria, and in Prussia, and thirdly the pattern in the city-states, still based on part-time ‘amateurs’. Accordingly, the duties of public servants, as expected by the monarchs and their governments, produced different schemes of education and training. Further key points of change were the beginning of modern, state-run technical infrastructures with mass employment of personnel after the 1830s, and the transition to democracy in 1918 in the Weimar Republic, which lasted until 1933, when National Socialism came to power and penetrated all public services. After 1945, the Cold War produced a Soviet-style cadres administration in East Germany and a revival of tradition in West Germany; now it is united under the Western model. The chapter ends with a short reflection on the duties and responsibilities of public servants under the conditions of its democratic system."
