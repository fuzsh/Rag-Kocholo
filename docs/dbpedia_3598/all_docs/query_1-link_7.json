The book began as a dissertation at the University of Chicago under the direction of John W. Boyer and Michael E. Geyer. For their encouragement, suggestions, and support long after the dissertation was completed, I am most grateful. I am equally indebted to David Blackbourn, whose comments on the finished dissertation proved invaluable for transforming it into the present volume. The research in France and Germany for this book was made possible through the financial generosity of several institutions and foundations. I am grateful to the Friedrich-Ebert Stiftung, the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD), the Institut für Europäische Geschichte in Mainz, and the University of Chicago for supporting the initial work, and to the National Endowment for the Humanities and the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga for summer fellowships that underwrote the subsequent research and writing. I have drawn on considerable archival and library materials for this book. My deepest thanks to the staff at the libraries and archives that graciously and patiently assisted me in consulting their collections: the Archives Départementales du Bas-Rhin (especially Christian Wolff, now retired); the Archives Départementales du Haut-Rhin; the Archives Municipales de Strasbourg (particularly François Schwicker); the libraries of the Faculty of Theology and the Institutes for Alsatian and Contemporary History at the University of Strasbourg; the Bibliothèque Nationale et Universitaire de Strasbourg; the Archives of the Diocese of Strasbourg; the Bibliothèque Municipale de Strasbourg; the Archive of the Archdiocese of Trier; the Bundesarchiv-Koblenz and the former Bundesarchiv-Potsdam; the Geheimes Staatsarchiv Preußischer Kulturbesitz Berlin-Dahlem; the Political Archives of the German Foreign Ministry (then at Bonn); the Vorpommerisches LandesarchivGreifswald; the Library of the Institut für Europäische Geschichte (especially Martin Vogt); the Stadt- und Universitätsbibliothek Frankfurt am Main (particularly Jochen Stollenberg); and the Universitätsbibliothek Tübingen. I am very indebted to the presidents of the Lutheran and the Reformed Churches of Alsace-Lorraine as well as the pastors of the\n\nxii\n\nacknowledgements\n\ncity’s Protestant parishes for allowing me to work extensively in their private archives. Without that access, this book would not have grown into its present form. Similarly, Gustave Koch and Madame Pig-Lagos made it possible for me to take full advantage of the rich collections of the library of the Séminaire Protestant (Collegium Wilhelmitanum) in Strasbourg. My sincerest thanks to the staffs of the Regenstein Library at the University of Chicago, the Adelstone Library at the College of Charleston, and the Lupton Library at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga for their assistance in procuring research materials. While I take full responsibility for any errors and omissions in the text, any success that it might find owes much to the exchanges I have had with a number of scholars and friends on both sides of the Atlantic. Christian Baechler, François Igersheim, Marc Lienhard, and Bernard Vogler not only facilitated my research in Strasbourg, but they helped me to understand a culture that was not at all my own. In Germany, my work benefited greatly from conversations with Wolfgang Schieder (then at the University of Cologne) as well as from my interactions with the fellows and staff at the Institut für Europäische Geschichte (particularly Ralph Melville and Claus Scharf ). Sam Goodfellow, Steve Harp, Amy Leonard, Rebecca McCoy, Wendy Norris, and Peter Wallace have engaged me in many conversations about Strasbourg and Alsace over the years, for which I am very grateful. Andrew Lees has been generous in sharing his insights into nineteenth-century European urban history. I am also indebted to my friends and colleagues who have actively explored the importance of religion in modern Europe. My work has gained appreciably from the encouragement and feedback from this company of scholars, especially Margaret Lavinia Anderson, Jim Bjork, Olaf Blaschke, Jeff Cox, Anselm Doering-Manteuffel, Paul Hanebrink, Róisín Healy, Dagmar Herzog, Lucian Hölscher, Hartmut Lehmann, Antonius Liedhegener, Hugh McLeod, Jan Palmowski, Rebecca Rodgers, Helmut Walser Smith, Till van Rahden and Peter van Rooden. At the annual meetings of the American Historical Association, German Studies Association, and Society for French Historical Studies, the conferences organized at the German Historical Institute-Washington, the University of Amsterdam, and the University of Chicago, and seminars held at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, the University of Tübingen, and Vanderbilt University, I fleshed out many of the ideas that appear in the pages that follow. My thanks to the participants and audience members for their insightful remarks.\n\nacknowledgements\n\nxiii\n\nI offer special thanks to Matt Berg, Jim LeSueur, and Paul Steege for their encouragement and advice regarding the publishing process. I also wish to acknowledge my debts to my colleagues (past and present) at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga for their support as I brought this project to completion. Amy Froide, Aaron Althouse, Victoria Steinberg, and Jim Ward all willingly read sections of this book and, through their comments and criticisms, helped make it better. Jeffrey Zalar, too, offered his keen mind and editorial savvy on numerous occasions, for which I am deeply grateful. Many thanks are due also to Roger Chickering and Tom Brady for their contributions as series editors, and to Franz Peter Hugdahl for his generous assistance with the final copyediting. On a more personal note, I thank my good friend Linda Gaus for her sense of humor, practical advice, and encouragement. My parents, Ray and Jeanne Steinhoff, have also been a constant source of love and support, without which this book would have been much more difficult to complete. Finally, I dedicate this volume to the memory of my maternal grandmother, who first opened my eyes and mind to the wonders of other worlds and cultures.\n\nNOTE ON TRANSLATIONS AND USAGE Writing about Protestantism in late nineteenth-century Strasbourg and Alsace-Lorraine for an English-language audience raises a series of technical challenges, which I have tried to resolve in the following manner. In this linguistic borderland region, I use the French variant of place names where that has become standard English usage, hence Strasbourg and not Straßburg, Colmar and not Kolmar, Mulhouse and not Mülhausen. In all other instances, I have employed the French version when referring to towns during the period of French rule and German appellations for the period of German rule (e.g., Bouxwiller and Buchsweiler respectively). In citing titles, documents, or songs, however, I have retained the original place names that appeared. Similarly, the official bulletin of the Lutheran church in France (and later Alsace-Lorraine) appears under two names. It is the Recueil officiel prior to 1872 and again after 1918, but the Amtliche Sammlung between 1872 and 1918. The German territory of which Strasbourg became the capital in 1871 was formally named the Reichsland Elsaß-Lothringen, or the Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine. I use the terms “Reichsland” and “Alsace-Lorraine” interchangeably throughout this book. For the most part, I have avoided the locution “Alsace-Lorrainer” to refer to the territory’s inhabitants and opted instead for Alsatians and Lorrainers. This choice reflects the fact that the pieces of Alsace and Lorraine that became the Reichsland had no ties to each other prior to 1870 (apart from the shared membership in the French state) and that, long after the annexation was accomplished, the native inhabitants still thought of themselves either as Alsatians or Lorrainers. The phrase “AlsaceLorrainer” (Elsaß-Lothringer) did exist, but it was created and used largely by the immigrant Germans (a.k.a. “old Germans” in contemporary parlance), particularly in official documents. I use the term in this restricted sense. For ecclesiastical terms and titles, I have translated pasteur and Pfarrer when referring to Protestant ministers as “pastor” and rendered the Catholic curé and Pfarrer/Priester as “priest.” I have translated réformé and reformiert as “Reformed” rather than “Calvinist,” since not all the Reformed Protestants in Alsace were, strictly speaking, Calvinists. However,\n\nxvi\n\nnote on translations and usage\n\nbecause the word “Reformeds” doesn’t exist in English, I have translated Réformé and Reformierte (used as nouns) as “Calvinists.” For the sake of clarity, I rendered the Lutheran term inspection/Inspektion as “inspection” when it denoted a geographical unit, but used “inspectoral assembly” (Inspektionsversammlung) to refer to the delegations gathering from the consistories in the inspection. The inspection’s administrative head, the inspecteur ecclésiastique or geistliche Inspektor, has been translated as “religious inspector.” Lastly, I have rendered confession and Konfession as “confession” when referring to Catholics, Protestants, and Jews as religious groups instead of “denomination,” since the latter term generally denotes divisions within a religious tradition. I have also translated most of the French and German titles of political officials and administrative units into English. Préfet became “prefect,” and the Ministre/Ministère des cultes the Minister/Ministry for Religious Affairs. Likewise, Bezirk became “district” and Kreis “county.” I have called a division head within the Ministry for Alsace-Lorraine, the Unterstaatssekretär, an “undersecretary” (e.g., undersecretary for justice and religious affairs), and the civil servants in a division (Räte) either “counselors” (e.g., ministerial counselor for Ministerialrat) or “senior civil servants,” depending on the context. I chose to translate Präsident in the titles Oberpräsident and Bezirkspräsident literally, thus “Superior President” and “District President,” instead of using “governor,” to call attention to the unique set of duties associated with these offices in Alsace-Lorraine (in comparison to Prussia, for instance). For similar reasons, I opted not to translate the title of the highest political official in Alsace-Lorraine for the period 1879–1918: the Statthalter (singular and plural). The term “viceroy” has colonial connotations that are out of place in this context, while “governor” or “territorial governor” fails to capture the Statthalter’s considerable power and autonomy. Finally, all translations provided here are my own unless otherwise noted.\n\nABBREVIATIONS ADBR ADHR AEA AEK AELKZ AHR AKZGM AMS AS ASPC BAK BAL BCW BNUS BSHPF CEH DR ECAAL EL ELJ ERAL FB GFMFM GG GStA HZ JMH JUH KAK KB\n\nArchives Départementales du Bas-Rhin Archives Départementales du Haut-Rhin Archives de l’Église d’Alsace (= AEK, 1945–) Archiv für elsässische Kirchengeschichte (= AEA, 1929–1945) Allgemeine Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirchenzeitung American Historical Review Arbeitskreis für kirchliche Zeitgeschichte, Münster Archives Municipales de Strasbourg Amtliche Sammlung der Akten des Ober-Konsistoriums und des Direktoriums der Kirche Augsburgischer Konfession (= RO 1870 –1918) Archiv der Straßburger Pastoral-Conferenz Bundesarchiv-Koblenz Bundesarchiv-Lichterfeld (Berlin) Bibliothèque du Collegium Wilhelmitanum (Séminaire Protestant) Bibliothèque Nationale et Universitaire de Strasbourg Bulletin de la Société de l’Histoire du Protestantisme Français Central European History Deutsche Revue (Archives de) l’Église de la Confession d’Augsbourg en Alsace et Lorraine Elsaß-Lothringen (Alsace-Lorraine) Elsaß-Lothringisches Jahrbuch Église Reformée en Alsace et Lorraine Evangelisch-Lutherischer Friedensbote aus Elsaß-Lothringen German Foreign Ministry Files and Microfilms Geschichte und Gesellschaft Geheimes Staatsarchiv Preußischer Kulturbesitz, BerlinDahlem Historische Zeitschrift Journal of Modern History Journal of Urban History Kirche Augsburger/Augsburgischer Konfession (= ECCAL) Evangelisch-Protestantischer Kirchenbote\n\nxviii KS LBY MGkK MSV NCIR P.

Many European commentators regarded the year 1900 as the beginning of a new era that would continue to multiply and share the political, economic, social, and cultural benefits of modernity amongst an increasing share of the people in Europe and the rest of the world. Other observers were less comfortable with the nature and direction of change at the fin de siècle. They mourned the decline in traditional ways of life and expressed anxiety about the consequences of trends such as the emergence of democratic politics and mass culture.1 Yet another perspective was expressed by people like Michel Knittel, a Lutheran curate and religious inspector in the Alsatian city of Strasbourg, who took a more balanced approach and acknowledged contemporary problems while maintaining a guarded optimism. Reporting on the religious situation early in 1901, he remarked: The superficial observer of social life and activity at the end of the century will find reason enough for complaint. He can point to the growth in a materialistic world view, the erosion of public morality, the rising degree of pleasure-seeking, and the ever increasing amount of indifference towards church and religion. Anti-Christian tendencies, too, are striding ahead more and more, and celebrating ever greater victories. . . . And yet, despite all the clouds that darken the religious horizon at the end of the century, a clearer look reveals that the [ Protestant] religious sense is stronger and more visible today than ever before, because it is more evangelical.2\n\nAlthough this appraisal was consonant with the general mood at the turn of the century, it was a most unusual characterization of the contemporary religious climate. Most of Knittel’s European peers, who toiled in the cities and held conservative theological positions (as he did),\n\n1 Cf. Eugen Weber, France: Fin de Siècle (Cambridge: Belknap, 1986) and August Nitschke, Gerhard A. Ritter, Detlev J. K. Peukert, and Rüdiger vom Bruch, eds., Jahrhundertwende. Der Aufbruch in die Moderne, 2 vols. (Reinbek bei Hamburg: Rowohlt, 1990). 2 St. Thomas-Strasbourg Inspection Report (hereafter STIR) 1900, Archives Départementales du Bas-Rhin (hereafter ADBR) 172 AL 226.\n\n2\n\nintroduction\n\nfound little if any solace in nineteenth-century religious developments. In cities such as Berlin, London, and Paris, ministers bemoaned the dwindling size of their congregations. They lamented the drops in the number of baptisms and church weddings, as well as the growing signs of disinterest in organized religion. Many of these pastors, priests, and rabbis were also in agreement as to the root cause of these trends: the rise of the modern, big city. The rapid growth of urban Europe after 1850 created many cities with too few churches and ministers for the traditional understandings of priest and parish to function. New residential patterns and work rhythms made it difficult for both established inhabitants and immigrants to maintain regular ties with their faith communities, which was consequently reflected in rising crime rates, alcoholism, and births out of wedlock. Indeed, given this discourse of the big city as a modern day Sodom and the clerical complaints of a moral, religious world that seemed utterly lost, it is hardly surprising that the German sociologist, Ferdinand Tönnies, asserted in his classic work from 1887, Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft, that the demise of religion in the city was part and parcel of the paradigmatic shift from traditional communities to modern societies.3 Given the strength of this fin de siècle chorus of religious decline, it is tempting to dismiss Knittel’s sentiments as an aberration. More charitably, one might suggest that the situation in Strasbourg was somehow unusual. In light of recent work on European religious life in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, however, another reading seems likely. Namely, the inspector’s comments are representative of a much larger body of evidence that shows that religious communities were not worlds lost in urbanization’s wake. Rather, they were transformed worlds, whose members and institutions participated actively in the construction of urban modernity. To understand this transformation and its broader ramifications for religion in Europe and the modern condition, this book explores the experiences of one urban faith milieu during the high season of European urbanization: the Protestants in Knittel’s own Strasbourg. Certain factors made Strasbourg’s situation between 1870 and 1914 unique. The coexistence of many Catholics, Protestants and Jews gave rise to a highly competitive confessional On the religious dimension of the late nineteenth-century antiurban discourse, see especially Andrew Lees, Cities Perceived: Urban Society in European and American Thought, 1820 –1840 (New York: Columbia University Press, 1985), and, more recently, Lees, Cities, Sin and Social Reform in Imperial Germany (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2002), esp. 23 – 48. 3\n\nintroduction\n\n3\n\nclimate in the city that took on new energy following the German Empire’s annexation of Alsace-Lorraine in 1871 and its designation of Strasbourg as the capital for the new imperial territory (Reichsland). At the same time, Strasbourg’s situation speaks to the experiences of a type of European big city—the regional administrative, commercial, and cultural center—which has not received sufficient attention in the scholarly literature. It is this combination of factors that make Strasbourg’s example so useful for reassessing the myth of the secular big city as well as examining anew the complex relationships among religion, cultural integration, and national identity in Imperial Germany. Religion and the Modern Big City The notion that modernity was essentially an urban phenomenon emerged most powerfully from the turn of the century ruminations of social thinkers like Tönnies, Durkheim, and Weber. Their understanding of the European big city—that is, places with at least one hundred thousand inhabitants—and their personal experiences in such environments led them to conceptualize the late nineteenth-century city as both the exemplar and engine of a fundamentally new social, political, and economic order.4 In their seminal writings, these founders of modern sociology identified the city as the centerpoint of modern state formation and capitalist production. It was also where new and influential forms of social relations and cultural activities were taking shape and subsequently being spread beyond the cities’ walls due to urban concentrations of political and economic power and the expansion of city-based communications and transportation systems. In short, the sociologists predicted that rural Europe would take on the characteristics of urban society (Gesellschaft), which was not only atomized and differentiated, but rationalized and demystified (entzaubert)—in a word, secular.5\n\n4 Adna F. Weber discusses the designation of cities with over 100,000 inhabitants as “big cities” or, in German, Großstädte, in The Growth of Cities in the Nineteenth Century (New York: Columbia University Press, 1899), 16. Useful on the connections between German sociologists’ urban experience and their understanding of modernity is Ira Katznelson, “The Centrality of the City in Social Theory,” in The Divided Heritage: Themes and Problems in German Modernism, ed. Irit Rogoff (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991), 253 – 64, and Jennifer Jenkins, Provincial Modernity: Local Culture and Liberal Politics in Fin-de-Siècle Hamburg (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2003), 1–2. 5 Owen Chadwick, The Secularization of the European Mind in the 19th Century (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1975), 5–8.\n\n4\n\nintroduction\n\nThe equation of urbanity with modernity has exerted a powerful influence over scholars’ thinking about social and cultural change in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The years following the Second World War, in particular, witnessed the elevation of such modernization theories to the status of social science orthodoxy. Academics on both sides of the Atlantic not only turned to thinkers like Weber for theoretical and methodological inspiration, they also defined their research in terms of the modernization paradigm. Among Clio’s adepts, for instance, the history of modern society became a matter for serious inquiry, in which analyses of the urban working class or urban industrialization took pride of place.6 In retrospect, this intellectual commitment to urbanization qua modernization seems warranted. Over the course of the twentieth century, the world—and the Western world in particular—has become decidedly more urban. More people live in urban settings than in rural ones. Furthermore, the political, economic, cultural, and social currents emanating from cities largely shape the everyday life of both urban and rural residents.7 Curiously, while social scientists and social historians pursued their research with great rigor and analytical sophistication, they did not examine some of their theories’ key premises. Now that scholars have begun to explore these assumptions as well, the old predictions about the course of urbanization and the spread of urban influences beyond the city seem less compelling. Despite the importance of the big city for theoretical notions of modernity, the history of modern urban Europe received little attention, even in the land of Weber. Indeed, only with the fruition in the 1980s of the first generation of labors from the “new urban history” movement have we begun to appreciate what urbanization in Europe between roughly 1860 and 1918 actually entailed.8 In particular, this\n\nSee especially Thomas Mergel, “Geht es weiterhin voran?

While rapid urban growth destabilized many traditional forms of community, it also permitted the development of more localized forms of social organization in the big city, based on neighborhoods, voluntary associations, and cafés.9 In his insightful essay on the modern condition, Anthony Giddens even suggests that such configurations or “partial societies” are a consequence of modernity. They represent the successful reinsertion of urban social relations into specific temporal and spatial contexts that provide vital sites of intimacy and informality in what can otherwise be a large, impersonal world.10 Recent research is even more critical of the argument that religion’s decline in the big city, as evidenced by decay both in religious sentiment and in organized religion’s broader social, cultural, and political salience, drove a more general, long-term process of secularization.11 Despite their prominence, these ideas about religion and the encounter with modernity never rested on a solid footing. Durkheim’s and Weber’s own claims about a “disenchanted” urban society depend primarily on anecdotal and other prima facie evidence, which does not reveal rigorous empirical research. Subsequent scholarship has not corrected this omission. After 1945, Marxist and social science scholars took advantage of the disdain for “pre-modern” forces in the theory of modernization in order to ignore religion altogether, whether in the city or the countryside. Meanwhile, those who did take an interest in matters religious, especially academics affiliated with churches, treated secularization as History Research in Germany: Its Development and Present Condition,” Urban History Yearbook (1981): 39 –54; as well as early synthetic accounts by Paul M.

Instead of questioning whether secularization occurred, their studies strove to record and quantify its progress.12 In this manner, social science helped advance the Friedrich Nietzsche’s claims in the Gay Science that created a picture of modern Europe where God was indeed dead or, at least, largely absent. In the 1970s and early 1980s, scholars started to consider more carefully religion over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and it became evident that the secularization paradigm misrepresented both basic facts and wider trends. The modern era, an ever growing body of revisionist literature demonstrates, was hardly a period of unmitigated religious decline. Neither churches nor other religious institutions were incapable of adapting to changing political, social, and cultural conditions.13 In fact, instead of killing off religion, modernity helped give churches and other forms of religious community a new lease on life. The professionalization of clerical training and the rationalization of ecclesiastical institutions, Olaf Blaschke usefully points out, enabled the established churches to establish a much more extensive and pervasive public presence after 1820 than during the “confessional age” of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.14 The expanded schooling\n\n12 See Wolfgang Schieder, “Sozialgeschichte der Religion im 19.

In Protestant lands like Britain and Germany, commonly considered the most “secular” areas of Europe, the state explicitly drew on religious symbols and notions of confessional belonging to foster a sense of national identity, that is, membership in a characteristically modern form of supra-local community.20 As the century progressed, religious affiliation increasingly structured social interaction in Europe. From Germany to England and from Holland to Switzerland, it determined where one lived and whom one married. It conditioned the terms of schooling and employment and it established the parameters for interacting or identifying with the state.21 In this light, the British scholar Callum Brown contends that the most momentous shifts in Europe’s religious landscape took place not during modernity’s prime, but rather in its twilight, the 1960s.22 These assaults on the secularist orthodoxy have been so persuasive that religion has become as broadly accepted a category for analyzing modern Europe’s past as class and gender.23 Nevertheless, revisionist\n\nClass, Religion and Local Politics in Wilhelmine Germany: The Center Party in Württemberg before 1914 (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1980); Wilfried Loth, Katholiken im Kaiserreich: Der politische Katholizismus in der Krise des wilhelminischen Deutschlands (Düsseldorf: Droste, 1984); and Sperber, Popular Catholicism. 20 Hugh McLeod, “Protestantism and British National Identity, 1815–1945,” in Nation and Religion: Perspectives on Europe and Asia, ed.

First, scholars largely continue to talk about religious activity in terms of the secularization paradigm. Lucian Hölscher’s massive Datenatlas epitomizes one dimension of this dilemma. By accepting the emphasis on quantitative analysis that is concomitant with secularization theory, the work validates a narrow definition of “religious,” by ignoring, or at least marginalizing expressions of religious activity that lacked official (church) sanction or took place outside of formal church settings.24 The desire to quantify also advances the discursive strategy of secularization by framing discussions about modern religious practice and piety in terms of a premodern standard. This approach idealizes the premodern character of religion and makes all modifications negative.25 The “milieu studies” that have dominated research on religion in German-speaking Europe over the past fifteen years typify another dimension of the methodological conundrum.26 Scholars working in this vein concede the point about traditional religion’s decline, following the secularization thesis, and thus devote little attention to it. Many works in this mode, which include Antonius Liedhegener’s volume on Münster and Bochum and Dietmar von Reeken’s analysis of north German Protestantism, do investigate official, church-based religious practice (Kirchlichkeit).27 This exercise is, however, perfunctory, because their arguments about the vitality of modern religious activity depend on new developments like the emergence of the confessional milieu 24 Lucian Hölscher, ed., Datenatlas zur religiösen Geographie im protestantischen Deutschland von der Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts bis zum Zweiten Weltkrieg, 4 vols. (Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 2001). 25 Callum Brown urges moving away from the reductionism of quantitative studies in Death of Christian Britain, 10 –12. 26 The definition of “milieu” derives from M. Rainer Lepsius’s influential essay, “Parteisystem und Sozialstruktur: Zum Problem der Demokratisierung der deutschen Gesellschaft,” in Die deutsche Parteien vor 1918, ed. Gerhard A. Ritter (Cologne: Kiepenheuer & Witsch, 1973), 56 – 80.

Kaiser, 1999).\n\n10\n\nintroduction\n\nand its voluntary associations and media organizations as well as the new types of piety, such as the Cult of the Sacred Heart.28 Studies of popular religion are also guilty of this kind of intellectual bait and switch when they draw important attention to the activity outside the realm of “official religion,” but simultaneously imply that the “old religion” no longer warrants sustained consideration.29 Third, these new works in modern European religious history maintain the fundamental hypotheses about religion and the modern city essentially intact. Revisionist historians have only rarely directed their gaze at the situation in Europe’s big cities. Those few examples focus on Europe’s “giant” cities, places like Berlin, London, and Paris.30 But the emphasis on such cities is consistent with a singular understanding of the modern urban experience that urban historians are beginning firmly to reject.31 For their part, urban specialists have been no more 28 Cf.

Williams, Religious Belief and Popular Culture in Southwark c. 1880 –1939 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999). 30 Hugh McLeod discusses this situation in his introduction to European Religion in the Age of Great Cities 1830 –1930 (London: Routledge, 1995), 1– 39; and McLeod, “Die Kirche in Großstädten,” in Kirchliche Zeitgeschichte.

There, too, the image of the secular big city remains alive and well.32 I contend that it is time to dispense with this urban legend. The big city was not nearly as inhospitable to religion as was long presumed. The changes brought on by urbanization certainly challenged traditional faith communities and forced them to adapt and innovate. But they did survive. This survival made it possible for religion to remain an important force in the big city and become a part of the influences referred to as “urban modernity,” which transformed life in the city and countryside alike. Exploring the dimensions of religion’s encounter with the big city stands at the heart of this book and entails looking at the structures and practices of “traditional,” organized religion as well as at the new ideas about religious community and piety that emerged out of the modern urban environment. At the same time, this study seeks to move the discussion about religion in modern Europe beyond the dichotomies of modernization and secularization.33 Instead of straining to define the city as either sacred or secular, or trying to identify a single force—capitalism, democracy, Christianity—as the determinant force of an entire social system, I start from the premise that big cities, like modern societies more generally, were complex settings structured by a range of influences, including religion.34 Precisely because cities maintained both sacred and secular elements, modernization could promote sacralization and secularization alike. Because the secular dimension has dominated the literature to date, I concentrate here on the sacred.\n\n32 Hans-Jürgen Teuteberg, “Moderne Verstädterung und kirchliches Leben in Berlin. Forschungsergebnisse und Forschungsprobleme,” in Elm and Loock, Seelsorge und Diakonie, 161–200. 33 This tendency to frame accounts of modernity in terms of pre-modern/modern alternatives is found in Giddens, Consequences, 100 –11. 34 This stance repudiates, in particular, the suggestion that because religion was only able to shape pieces of a social system (cf. Niklas Luhmann’s idea of social subsystems) and not modern society more broadly (as it purportedly did in pre-modern times), religion should not be viewed as modern in the same way that class, or even gender were modern forces. See here Luhmann, Funktion der Religion (Frankfurt a. M.: Suhrkamp, 1977), and more recently, Carsten Kretschmann and Hennig’s Pahl’s critique of Blaschke’s thesis of a “second confessional age,” in “Ein ‘Zweites Konfessionelles Zeitalter’?

We need to comprehend the conditions in specific cities as well as in general types of cities before we can develop a richer and more persuasive picture of urban religion in modern Europe. Consequently, this volume takes the form of a case study, focusing on late nineteenth-century Strasbourg. The experience of Strasbourg between 1870 and 1914 is not viewed or pursued as typical or representative of European or, more specifically, German urbanization. No single case study can make that claim. However, Strasbourg’s specific situation provides an extraordinary opportunity for reassessing our notions about urban religion, and religion’s encounter with European modernity more generally. First, Strasbourg allows us to learn more about urbanization and its consequences for a city that was neither a “great city” like Berlin or Hamburg, nor an industrial boom town like Bochum or Essen. Like most of the forty-eight German big cities (Großstädte) in 1910, Strasbourg became a modern big city after 1871, largely due to its designation that year as the capital of German Alsace-Lorraine.35 On the eve of the First World War, Strasbourg was Germany’s twenty-sixth largest city in population, and eighth in area. While immigrants from other parts of Germany and Alsace swelled its population, Strasbourg remained an administrative, commercial, cultural, and military capital like it had been throughout the century, which made it comparable to places like Barmen, Halle, Mannheim, and Münster.36 Although a very different type of city than Munich or Hamburg, urban growth presented Strasbourg with similar types of challenges: creating additional housing, improving hygiene and sanitation, organizing the new urban environment, and securing the funds to pay for it. In fact, thanks to the\n\n35 Germany had only eight big cities in 1871: Berlin, Hamburg, Breslau, Dresden, Munich, Cologne, Königsberg, and Leipzig. Reulecke, Urbanisierung, 203 – 04. On the period 1870 –1918 as the apex of modern German urbanization, see especially Tenfelde, “Urbanization and the Spread of Urban Culture.” 36 Karl Eichelmann, ed., Die Bevölkerung der Stadt Straßburg (auf Grund der Volkszählungsergebnisse mit besonderer Berücksichtigung des Jahres 1910) (Strasbourg: Friedrich Bull Verlagsbuchhandlung, 1913), i – vi; and more generally, Georges Livet and Francis Rapp, eds., Histoire de Strasbourg des origines à nos jours, 4 vols. (Strasbourg: Éditions des Dernières nouvelles d’Alsace, 1980), 4:3 –183 and 269 – 395.\n\nintroduction\n\n13\n\nleadership of its talented mayors, Otto Back and Rudolf Schwander, Strasbourg emerged as one of the pioneers in German urban planning and social reform.37 Equally important was Strasbourg’s vibrant religious culture when urbanization commenced. Large numbers of Catholics, Protestants (Lutheran and Reformed), and Jews made their home in Strasbourg, and by 1870 interconfessional competition was established as a defining factor in local political, social, and cultural life. Furthermore, the city was an important ecclesiastical center for each of these faith communities. Strasbourg was the seat of the Catholic diocese of Alsace and its respected seminary, as well as the headquarters for the Lutheran Church of France and the Faculty of Protestant Theology. Regional Calvinist and Jewish affairs were also administered in Strasbourg through the actions of their respective consistories.38 By studying the affects of urbanization on these arrangements, we will not only augment our understanding of religion in Europe’s big cities, but we will help write a new chapter in the modern religious history of both Strasbourg and Alsace.39 Ideally a history of religious culture in German Strasbourg would examine each of the city’s faith communities and their interactions with one another. Coexistence—and conflict—played a key role in shaping the identities of the three groups. Interdenominational competition between Protestants and Catholics, in particular, was pivotal for the dynamism of Strasbourg’s religious culture both before and after 1870. For pragmatic and historiographical reasons, however, this study focuses on the experiences of Strasbourg’s Protestant community. At\n\n37 Alexander Dominicus, Straßburgs deutsche Bürgermeister Back und Schwander 1878 –1918 (Frankfurt a.M.: Moritz Diesterweg, 1939); Christoph Cornelißen, Stefan Fisch and Annette Maas, Grenzstadt Straßburg: Stadtplanung, kommunale Wohnungspolitik und Öffentlichkeit 1870 –1940 (St. Ingbert: Röhrig Universitätsverlag, 1997), and, for Strasbourg as an urban “success story,” Palmowski, Urban Liberalism, 237–54 and 289; and Krabbe, Die deutsche Stadt, 100 – 07 and 127–28. 38 I will trace a more detailed picture of Strasbourg’s religious situation prior to 1870 in Chapter One. 39 Although historians of Alsace-Lorraine and Strasbourg have considered how religious and confessional differences shaped society and politics both before and after 1870, they have devoted little attention to the specifically urban dimension of the question. Albert Wahl’s pathbreaking study, Confession et comportement dans les campagnes d’Alsace et de Bade, 1871–1939, 2 vols. (Strasbourg: Éditions Coprur, 1980) ignores cities entirely, while Livet and Rapp’s magisterial Histoire de Strasbourg devotes a mere four paragraphs (4:355–56) to religion during the German period (and most of these concern the Catholic church).\n\n14\n\nintroduction\n\nthe practical level, one concern was keeping the project manageable. But there were also great disparities in the available primary sources. All three faith communities left considerable traces in the archives of the various territorial and municipal administrations. The periodical press—secular and religious—reported on a wide array of religious and ecclesiastical events. There exists as well a substantial memoir literature for the period. However, the sources that can shed light on the internal dynamics of Strasbourg’s Jewish and Catholic communities are extremely inadequate. Large amounts of the Jewish material perished during the Nazi occupation of 1940–44, while the different approaches to Catholic and Protestant church government in AlsaceLorraine meant that Catholic records at both the parish and episcopal levels were never very plentiful.40 Strasbourg’s Protestant communities however, left a rich documentary record that has largely survived the ravages of time. The more democratic approach to Protestant church government in Strasbourg produced a considerable paper trail that enables the historian to gain a rare look at debates within the Protestant community on a wide range of administrative and ministerial issues. Moreover, the fierce theological debates within the Protestant community found expression in rival hymnals and liturgical collections, polemical pamphlets, and party-specific religious newspapers and voluntary organizations. While such materials make it possible to explore the structures and practices of late nineteenthcentury Protestantism in Strasbourg with unprecedented depth, they also underscore the role that interconfessional coexistence and conflict played in shaping internal Protestant affairs. The choices that Strasbourg’s Protestants made regarding such matters as parish organization, religious education, and urban ministry between 1870–1914, for instance, repeatedly took into account the position and attitudes of the Catholic “other.” Thus, even though I focus on Protestants and Protestantism here, the need to place my analysis within the broader context of interdenominational relations has yielded a study that, in critical respects, is indeed a history of urban religious culture in Strasbourg and not 40 This said, access to the extant material remains problematic. ADBR has rich holdings but lack adequate catalogs. Until recently, most of the Protestant and Catholic archives were held privately and not easily consulted. Many Protestant materials (Lutheran and Calvinist) have made their way either to ADBR or the Archives municipales de Strasbourg (hereafter, AMS) and are more readily available, but the bulk of the Diocese of Strasbourg’s records for the Reichsland period remains closed to scholars.\n\nintroduction\n\n15\n\njust of Protestantism. This contextualized approach has the further merit of reappraising our understanding of confessionalization, such that we see it not only in terms of its outcomes, that is, the specific social groups it produces, but also, and even more so, as a sociocultural process, namely, a way for generating both these social identities and the very religious practices they referenced.41 Concentrating on Strasbourg’s Protestants during the Reichsland period has important historiographical benefits. First, it addresses a significant lacuna in the literature on Strasbourg and Alsace-Lorraine. Although the era of German rule was important on a number of levels for the history of Alsatian Protestantism, it has received scant attention from historians and religious scholars. 42 In recent years, some important contributions to the history of Catholicism between 1870 and 1918 have appeared,43 but Otto Michaelis’s Grenzlandkirche remains the only monograph devoted to Reichsland Protestantism. It is a fine study, in no small part due to his personal connection to the material, but political circumstances after 1918 prevented the German Michaelis from consulting the official church and government archives in Strasbourg.44 The history of Protestantism in German Strasbourg, where roughly one-fifth of all the Reichsland’s Protestants lived and where both territorial Protestant churches were installed, exists only in fragments, most significantly Christian Albecker’s work on the Urban Mission, Bernard Vogler’s essay on the students attending the Faculty of Protestant Theology, and Paul Muller’s master’s thesis on the St. William Inspection.45 41 Helmut Walser Smith and Christopher Clark, “The Fate of Nathan,” in Smith, Protestants, Catholics and Jews, 3–29, esp. 14–16.

The religious turn in modern German historiography, in fact, has primarily focused on Catholicism,46 although scholarly efforts to examine the roots of modern German anti-Semitism in the wake of the Holocaust have also fostered considerable research into nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Judaism.47 Recent years have witnessed the publication of several important titles concerning German Protestantism in Imperial Germany—Gangolf Hübinger’s valuable inquiry into cultural Protestantism; Frank-Michael Kuhlemann’s and Oliver Janz’s studies of the Protestant clergy; as well as Claudia Lepp’s, Harry Liebersohn’s, Armin-Müller Dreier’s and Helmut Walser Smith’s analyses of Protestant associational life48—but much de 1890 à 1939 (Strasbourg: Association des publications de la Faculté de Théologie protestante, 1992); Bernard Vogler, “Le recrutement des étudiants à la Faculté de théologie (1872–1918),” RHPR 68 (1988): 97–112; and Paul Muller, “La vie religieuse dans l’inspection ecclésiastique de St-Guillaume entre 1877 et 1900” (Maîtrise en théologie protestante, Université de Strasbourg II, 1980). Sadly, Robert Will, who ministered at Strasbourg-St. William (1899 –1922), never wrote a detailed article on the Reichsland era in his series on Strasbourg and Alsatian Protestantism that appeared in the Revue de Histoire et Philosophie Religieuses during the early 1940s. 46 Insightful discussions of the new work on German Catholicism appear in: Margaret Lavinia Anderson, “Piety and Politics: Recent Work on German Catholicism,” JMH 63 (1991): 681–716; idem, “The Limits of Secularization: On the Problem of the Catholic Revival in Nineteenth-Century Germany,” Historical Journal 38 (1995): 647–70; Oded Heilbronner, “From Ghetto to Ghetto: The Place of German Catholic Society in Recent Historiography,” JMH 72 (2000): 453–95; and Karl-Egon Lönne, “KatholizismusForschung,” GG 26 (2000): 137–44.

Scholars like Helmut Walser Smith and Hartmut Lehmann call attention to how German national identity acquired Protestant encoding between 1866 and 1871, and how this confessionalization of national belonging contributed to the designation of first Catholics and then socialists as “national outsiders.”51 In their own work on German national identity, historians such as Celia Applegate, Alon Confino, and Siegfried Weichlein emphasize how Germanness was rooted in local and regional experiences, even after the formation of the unitary nation-state in 1871.52 However, sufficient consideration of how much Applegate’s idea of a “nation of provincials” reflects the regional organization of German Protestantism itself is missing from these discussions. The ambiguities in the specifically Protestant dimension of German national identity became particularly evident—and problematic—following the Empire’s annexa-\n\nGerman Nationalism. In terms of larger syntheses, the most successful are the relevant chapters in Gerhard Besier, Religion, Nation, Kultur: Die Geschichte der christlichen Kirchen in den gesellschaftlichen Umbrüchen des 19.

In order to make Alsatians into Germans, public officials in both Berlin and Strasbourg had to struggle to define “Germanness” for the purpose of shaping public policy. With respect to Protestantism, the German state initially sought to import the national “distillate” into the Reichsland: it required state-run theology exams of Protestant ministers. It called immigrant German (“old-German”) theology professors to the reorganized University of Strasbourg.53 Ultimately, such “top-down” measures had limits, like the government’s overall policy of germanization.54 Instead, the Reichsland’s inhabitants became Germans most effectively when they were allowed to participate in the “nation of provincials” as equal partners, a situation that was most fully achieved in the evolution of the Lutheran and Reformed Churches into true territorial churches (Landeskirchen). Plan of the Argument This book is organized into three large sections. The first set of four chapters examines the structures of religious culture and community in Strasbourg, and their evolution in the course of urbanization and the shift to German rule. Chapter 1 sets the stage for the investigation by looking, first, at Strasbourg’s development as a city and center of Alsatian Protestantism over the first two-thirds of the nineteenth century. It then explores the transition to German rule in 1870–71, during which time the critical decisions concerning the development of the local Protestant churches as territorial churches were made. Alsace-Lorraine was to exist as an independent imperial territory (Reichsland ), and the French ecclesiastical statutes would be maintained in the region as the local church law, which confirmed the Lutheran and Reformed Churches’ status as independent, regional institutions. Chapter 2 focuses on Strasbourg’s entry into the ranks of the German big cities, which was accomplished already in the 1880s. Although the 53 On the creation of the “German” University of Strasbourg, see generally John E. Craig, Scholarship and Nation Building: The Universities of Strasbourg and Alsatian Society, 1870 –1939 (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1984). Unfortunately, we still do not have a satisfactory history of the Faculty of Protestant Theology for the Reichsland period, although Michaelis discusses some of the faculty’s most prominent members in Grenzlandkirche, 173 – 80. 54 Hans-Ulrich Wehler, “Das ‘Reichsland’ Elsaß-Lothringen von 1870 bis 1918,” in Krisenherde des Kaiserreichs 1871–1918: Studien zur deutschen Sozial- und Verfassugsgeschichte, 2nd ed. (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1979), 23 – 69.\n\nintroduction\n\n19\n\ncity’s urban transformation was triggered largely by secular forces—the wave of immigration resulting from Strasbourg’s new position as a territorial capital, the need to rebuild and expand physically following the bombardment of 1870 and the newcomers’ arrival—the chapter reveals that urbanization was not merely a secular process. It also encouraged a considerable degree of sacralization as new churches were constructed, streets were named after historical religious figures, and new mobility patterns endowed many neighborhoods with a palpably confessional character. Chapter 3 investigates the Protestant parish milieu: the parishes and their clerical and lay leaders. It reveals how the competitive interconfessional climate placed Strasbourg’s Lutheran and Reformed parishes in a strong position to deal with the influx of new residents, both in terms of churches and personnel, and how they managed it over time, albeit with some difficulties. But the milieu itself changed in important ways between 1870 and 1914. It became more diverse, with the implantation of the German military church system and, later, free churches and sects. The clergy were professionalized. Its candidates had to pass first one, and then two state-administered exams. Systems of clerical placement, at least in the Lutheran church, were standardized. At the turn of the century, a fully modern salary and pension system was also introduced, which was paid for, in part, by a new regime of church taxes. Chapter 4 takes up the question of church-state relations, which is made especially important by the shift to German rule and the concentration of both political and Protestant ecclesiastical authority in Strasbourg. Whereas secularization theory emphasizes ecclesiastical stasis and secular state interests, this investigation highlights change and the state’s considerable involvement in church affairs. Both the Lutheran and the Reformed churches pursued reforms—the creation of a new Lutheran inspection, the convocation of a territorial Reformed synod—in order to adjust to their post-1870 circumstances and to modernize their administrative practices. But, they had to contend with the new German administration, which was composed primarily of Protestants who sought to use their powers in the Protestant churches’ internal affairs to promote their own ideas of proper (German) Protestant church government—and enforce new standards of political reliability. The book’s second section considers three areas of religious cultural practice that served to inculcate notions of confessional belonging and piety among the faithful while also calling attention to the existence of faith communities in the constantly evolving urban setting. Chapter 5\n\n20\n\nintroduction\n\nconcentrates on worship and, in that context, notions of ritual space and time. Although urbanization challenged traditional ideas about worship as religious practice, most notably by attenuating the churches’ claims on Sunday mornings and afternoons, it persisted as a key agent of religious acculturation in the city. Parishes responded to the altered social and cultural climate by moving services to new hours of the day and week, and by experimenting with new liturgical formats. The churches updated their hymnals and they organized special one-time feast days to commemorate the actions of locally important Protestant figures such as Martin Bucer and John Calvin. Many Lutherans and Calvinists did not attend services as frequently as their ministers would have liked, but their contacts with the culturally rich liturgical environment remained intact. Not only was attendance on feast days regularly strong, but throughout the Reichsland the vast majority of the city’s Protestants continued to receive religious rites of passage and engage in worship. In Chapter 6 the attention shifts to religious education in school and parish, a cultural activity of tremendous importance to the faith communities. These programs prepared youth not just for a particular rite of passage (Protestant confirmation, Catholic first communion) but their future as members of these socio-religious groups. The modernization of primary and secondary instruction in Strasbourg after 1870, such as the introduction of mandatory schooling, the reorganization of the school day, and the making of new school districts, created real difficulties for the churches. It became harder for the ministers to oversee the schools’ programs of instruction, and schoolchildren could not always attend parochial catechism lessons as they once had. The educational reforms also resulted in religious education reaching more of the city’s youth, since every boy and girl had to attend not just school, but also the mandatory religion classes. It did not develop into a “secular” institution, as the recent literature on the European culture wars would indicate.55 Instead, schools became critical, complementary sites for disseminating religious knowledge in the city.56 In contrast to their\n\n55 On the conflicts over schooling in nineteenth-century Europe, see Clark and Wolfram, Culture Wars; Marjorie Lamberti, State, Society, & the Elementary School in Imperial Germany (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1989); and Mona Ozouf, L’École, l’Église et la République, 1871–1914 (Paris: Éditions Cana, 1982). 56 Jeffrey Cox has developed the term “diffusive Christianity” to talk about this kind of non-church based religious knowledge; Cox, English Churches, 90 –128.\n\nintroduction\n\n21\n\nCatholic peers, who sought to dominate the school system, Strasbourg’s Protestant clergy aimed to work with school officials and their religious education teachers in order to improve the quality and content of the actual instruction. Chapter 7 addresses the evolution of pastoral care and ministry in urban Strasbourg. In this context, too, the changes associated with urbanization challenged the city’s faith communities. The Lutheran personal congregation system prevented an efficient use of available financial and personnel resources. It was also foreign to most newcomers and consequently delayed their establishment of formal ties with the city’s official faith communities, if they did so at all. In light of these difficulties, Strasbourg’s Protestant leaders proceeded with reforms and innovations. To make it easier to remain in contact with the city’s Protestants, the Lutheran clergy proposed a system of geographicallybased parishes. Parish councils formed service committees to handle the material needs of their parishioners, permitting pastors to concentrate more on spiritual matters during their house visits. For the provision of medical and certain types of social assistance, parishes began hiring women from the local deaconess house, making these women de facto the first group of female parish officials. In addition, Lutherans and Calvinists exploited new, urban forms of sociability, like the voluntary association and the press, to reach out to the city’s Protestants. Indeed, Strasbourg’s larger and more diverse population made possible a greater number of religious associations and newspapers, through which it was also possible to cater to the specific religious requirements of groups within the larger community. The city’s Lutherans and Protestants created channels that allowed urban religious culture to spread more effectively into the countryside. They also elaborated alternative notions of religious community, which were anchored in, but no longer dependent on the traditional parish. The final chapter functions as the book’s third section. It is devoted to the issue of Protestant church reform and the modernization of ecclesiastical structures to make them more effective and more responsive to the needs of the urban populations. The local, geographicallydefined parish was formally established as the base of the entire church structure, and given greater autonomy. Church decision-making was reorganized in accord with liberal legal (rechtstaatlich) principles. The church governments gained a greater degree of independence from the state, especially with respect to managing their internal affairs. Even women were to gain the right to vote at the parish level, reflecting\n\n22\n\nintroduction\n\ntheir active involvement in local religious life. In short, Strasbourg’s Protestant Churches sought to take advantage of modernity, not to pursue “antimodern” agendas, as Wilfried Loth once characterized the goal of Catholic modernization efforts, but à la Inspector Knittel, to realize better Protestant ecclesiastical principles.57 Hesitant to support reforms that might serve as precedents either for altering Catholic church-state relations in the Reichsland or political reform elsewhere in the Empire, the Reichsland’s government ultimately scaled back many of the Churches’ proposals. But it did proceed to draw up legislation to grant many of their wishes in bills that the territorial Assembly would have approved, had war not broken out in 1914 first. There is still much we need to learn about religion’s encounter with modernity in the urban environment, in Imperial Germany as in late nineteenth-century Europe more generally. The history of Strasbourg presented here will not alone fill this gap, but it makes a valuable contribution. It calls attention to developments in a type of big city that heretofore have not figured significantly in the historiography. It makes official religious institutions and practices key figures in the analysis, rather than topics to be dismissed or explained away. Above all, in arguing that the time has come to move beyond the old chestnut of the “secular” big city, it hopes to provoke further investigation of urban religion and, thereby, engage further debate on the consequences of European modernity.\n\n57 Loth, “Einleitung,” in Deutscher Katholizismus im Umbruch zur Moderne, ed. idem (Stuttgart: Kohlhammer, 1991), 9 –19, here 11.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nFROM GRANDE VILLE TO HAUPTSTADT On the morning of 28 September 1870, after a devastating siege of fifty days, the French troops guarding Strasbourg capitulated to the opposing German forces. The heavy bombardment damaged the town’s fabled fortifications and many neighborhoods so badly that further resistance was pointless. In terms of military strategy, this victory was not significant. The German army had already established its mastery of eastern France after beating Napoleon III at Sedan earlier in the month and the real focus of the Franco-Prussian war was shifting towards Paris.1 Symbolically, however, Strasbourg’s capture was critical. It fulfilled the dream of nineteenth-century German nationalists, including the historian Heinrich von Treitschke who argued that a new Germany would be incomplete as long as Strasbourg, the wondrously fair city and pride of the old German empire, remained in French hands.2 To underscore this shift in geopolitical fortunes, the German leaders in Strasbourg celebrated their victory in a particularly evocative fashion.\n\n1 The French Republic was proclaimed on 3 September, one day after Napoleon III surrendered at Sedan; because of the siege, however, Strasbourg’s citizens only heard this news on 11 September.

On the history of “O Straßburg,” see Ludwig Erk and Frank M. Böhme, ed., Deutscher Liederhort. Auswahl der vorzüglicheren deutschen Volkslieder, nach Wort und Weise aus der Vorzeit und Gegenwart, 3 vols. (Leipzig: Georg Olms, 1893), 3:259 – 60.

Treitschke’s famous demand of Strasbourg (and Alsace) as the fruits of Germany’s victory over France appeared in “Was fordern wir von Frankreich,” Preussische Jahrbücher 26 (1870): 367– 409, republished as “What We Demand From France,” in Germany, France, Russia, and Islam (New York and London: G. P. Putnam’s Sons, 1915), 96 –79.\n\n24\n\nchapter one\n\nThey held a special worship service for the troops on 30 September, the very day on which the free German city of Strasbourg surrendered to Louis XIV’s French troops back in 1681. By itself, this act serves as a useful reminder of the ways in which religion and ideas of national identity were linked in nineteenth-century German Europe. Hartmut Lehmann has emphasized that narratives of Germanness during this high season of nation building drew heavily on the notion that God was with the Germans, that they benefited from His special aid and protection, which made it all the more essential that momentous victories were marked with religious celebrations of thanksgiving.3 The specific choice of venue for this service was equally telling. For rather than holding this liturgy at the Cathedral, that icon of Strasbourg’s medieval German past, the Germans gathered at the Lutheran parish of St. Thomas. It was this Protestant setting that served as a legacy of Strasbourg’s Reformation past and an emblem of its multiconfessional present, where field chaplain Emil Frommel offered thanks and rejoiced that Strasbourg’s future lies with the “Protestant German Empire of the German Nation.”4 Strasbourg’s return to Germany certainly marked the beginning of a new era in the city’s history. After 1871, the major French city ( grande ville) and departmental seat became the capital (Hauptstadt) of the German imperial territory (Reichsland ) of Alsace-Lorraine. This change in status along with the reconstruction work set in motion forces that turned Strasbourg into a big city, a Großstadt. Critical as these developments were, so too were the continuities between the French and German periods. The foundations for Strasbourg’s prominence as an administrative, commercial, transportation and intellectual center were all established well before 1870. So too were the basic elements of its religious culture. The city counted large numbers of Catholics, Protestants and Jews among its residents. It was also a major ecclesiastical center: the seat of a large Catholic diocese, both a Calvinist and a\n\nLehmann, “ ‘God Our Old Ally’.” Emil Frommel, O Straßburg, du wunderschöne Stadt!

This reworking of the old Holy Roman Empire’s formal name came from another military chaplain, Adolf Stoecker; Kurt Nowak, Geschichte des Christentums, 158.

Finally, while the peace treaty between Germany and France severed the bonds between the various French and Alsatian (and Lorrainer) church institutions, the challenges of the transition period impressed upon the Germans the desirability of retaining French ecclesiastical law in their new territory. Consequently, as Alsace-Lorraine entered the newly established German Empire in 1871, it found that it already enjoyed one of the benefits of membership in this “nation of provincials”: its own regional church law.5 Strasbourg, Frontier City By 1870, the citizens of Strasbourg could reflect on more than five hundred years as an important urban center. Until 1681, the Republic of Strasbourg enjoyed a position as one of the leading free cities of the Holy Roman Empire. Like the late medieval and early modern cities of Augsburg and Nuremberg, Strasbourg owed much of its initial fame and glory to a propitious location on the crossroads of major European travel routes. Commerce and artisanal production thrived, swelling the city’s coffers and its influence over other towns and villages in the upper Rhine valley.6 Strasbourg’s golden age coincided with the turbulent years of the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, a time of religious crisis, reform, and eventually war.7 Under the leadership of city fathers like Jacob Sturm and theologians like Martin Bucer, Strasbourg emerged as an independent center of the Protestant Reformation and further developed its reputation as a cultural and intellectual capital. At the same time that the promotion of humanism, tolerance, and religious reform fueled spectacular growth in the area of publishing and book production, the city opened a new school in 1538—the Gymnasium—to give the burghers’ sons a proper humanistic and theological training. Three decades later, the upper forms of this institution were split off 5 According to the Imperial Constitution of 1871, ecclesiastical policy was the prerogative of the individual German states. Consequently, this bit of Alsatian particularism was not particular, but rather a sign of the Reichsland’s membership in what Celia Applegate has called the “nation of provincials.” Nipperdey, Deutsche Geschichte 1866 –1918, vol. 2, Machtstaat vor der Demokratie (Munich: C. H. Beck, 1992), 85 – 86; Appelgate, Nation of Provincials, 11–15. 6 Livet and Rapp, Histoire de Strasbourg, 2:99 –177. 7 Ibid., 2:177–354.\n\n26\n\nchapter one\n\nto form the municipal Academy, which became the University of Strasbourg in 1621.8 The sixteenth- and seventeenth-century wars of religion presented a constant threat to the city’s religious arrangements and its independence. In 1555, for instance, the Peace of Augsburg forced a (temporary) restoration of Catholicism to the city (a situation called the Interim). Orthodox Lutherans took advantage of the city’s diplomatic weaknesses—and the treaty’s failure to recognize anything other than Lutheranism and Catholicism—to expel rival forms of Protestantism from the city and declared Strasbourg a Lutheran Republic in 1598.9 Strasbourg survived the Thirty Years War (1618–48) largely intact, but the Peace of Westphalia installed a new danger at the city’s door: France. Having acquired most of Upper Alsace from the Habsburgs, Louis XIV wished to consolidate his holdings so that the Rhine formed France’s eastern frontier, and this meant stripping the Alsatian free cities, Strasbourg above all, of their autonomy. One by one, Louis’ armies did precisely that, and on 30 September 1681 Strasbourg fell into Bourbon French hands.10 Incorporation into France had a number of notable consequences for Strasbourg. For starters, the former free city became the center of French administration in Alsace, the capital of the Intendancy of Alsace. Thanks to its strategically valuable position on the Rhine, Strasbourg also emerged as a major French military outpost, complete with an extensive set of fortifications designed by Louis XIV’s military engineer, the Marquis de Vauban. In religious terms, Strasbourg’s fall to France resulted in the return of Catholicism. Lutheranism continued on in Strasbourg, protected by the capitulation agreement and the treaty of Westphalia, but until the middle part of the eighteenth-century, the French state made life very difficult for the city’s Lutheran residents. 8 The literature on late fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Strasbourg is enormous. For a synthesis and bibliographic overview, the best starting place is Livet and Rapp, Histoire de Strasbourg, 2:365 – 541 (“La Réforme”). On the rule of the city magistrates, see Thomas A. Brady, Ruling Class, Regime and Reformation in Strasbourg (Leiden: E. J.

Catholics were free to proselytize throughout the city, whereas the public exercise of Lutheranism was strictly controlled. Nevertheless, institutions like the University and the Gymnasium remained in Lutheran hands. Lutheran elites discovered, as well, that the French state was a good ally in their efforts to keep Reformed Protestantism out of Strasbourg.11 Although Strasbourg’s commercial position declined somewhat over the course of the eighteenth century, it was still regarded as one of the great inland ports in Europe. Even more significantly, it became a privileged point for human and intellectual exchange between France and German Europe. As a French provincial capital, Strasbourg was exposed to a wide range of influences emanating from “the interior.” Recognizing the political, commercial, and social benefits to be gained, local elites began learning the French language. Court officials imported the latest styles and dances from Paris. Parisian-styled hôtels also sprang up in parts of the city, such as the Palais épiscopal de Rohan. Literary societies and salons became part of Strasbourg’s cultural scene in this period, when men like Jean-Daniel Salzmann gathered to discuss the latest writings of philosophes like Voltaire or Diderot.12 German culture also flourished in eighteenth-century Strasbourg. The Protestant University enjoyed considerable renown, especially in the areas of law, medicine, and letters, drawing students from across Germany to its doors, including a young poet named Goethe. Fluent in both their native German and French, Strasbourg’s intellectuals played a key role as translators in the eighteenth-century republic of letters. They absorbed information and ideas from German sources, spoke and wrote about them in French, and then repeated the process working from French back into German. Strasbourg’s theaters, too, served as a point of cultural contact, hosting both troupes from Paris and itinerant Germans musicians like Mozart.13 11 The best single study of eighteenth-century Strasbourg remains Franklin R.

The events of the early Revolutionary period destroyed most of the institutions and socioeconomic practices that had defined the city for centuries.
