        "text": "Hauptsturmführer Eduard Roschmann was an Austrian serving as a Sicherheitsdienst officer. He served in Latvia where he became the Commandant of the Riga ghetto. He was responsible for the deaths of over 80 000 people and killing Peter Miller's father, a Wehrmacht captain. Roschmann had killed him because he refused to give him control of a boat.\n\nAfter the war ended, Roschman disguised himself as an army corporal and escaped with two other officers. However, he was captured by the British in 1947. As he was being transported in a train, he managed to escape again, but injured his leg in the process, causing him to limp as he walked. He then escaped to Argentina with a false name of Hans Josef Kiefel. At some point he also joined the Odessa, a secret underground organisation consisting of old SS members.\n\nIn the 1960's, Roschman had resurfaced in Hamburg, and was being hunted down by a journalist called Peter Miller. Miller succeeded in finding him, and accused him of murdering his father. They both shot at each other, but due to Roschmann's terrible aim, only he got hit, and died from his wounds.\n\nNotes[]\n\nHe is a fictional portrayal of the real Eduard Roschmann.\n\nFor an SD officer, it was quite unusual to be appointed as a camp commandant."
