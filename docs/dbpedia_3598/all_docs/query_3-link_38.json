How to support women displaced from Ukraine on the EU labour market\n\nIt has been 3 months since Russia invaded Ukraine. Since then, 6 million people have fled the country. Most of them women and children. Quickly after the start of the war, the EU triggered the Temporary Protection Directive, an exceptional measure intended to give people displaced from Ukraine an automatic right to travel freely throughout Europe, and gain access to social welfare, healthcare, housing and work.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about how Ukrainian refugees have fared and how they are integrating in their host countries. And because so many of them are women, we delve deeper into what specific challenges that are facing on the labour market.\n\nWith: Lyuba Karpachova, Refugees Department Lead, Promote Ukraine; Lena Detlefsen, Postdoctoral Researcher, Kiel Institute for the World Economy (IfW), part of the MEDAM project team; Teresa Hornung, Senior Adviser, BDA Confederation of German Employers' Associations; Katerina Dimitrakopoulou, Head of Sector working on Integration, Legal Migration and Integration Unit, DG HOME; and Silvia Carta, Policy Analyst, European Policy Centre.\n\nThis episode is part of the Mercator Dialogue on Migration and Asylum or MEDAM, a research project that develops evidence-based solutions for asylum and immigration policies.\n\nWith Rebecca Castermans , Silvia Carta\n\nAfghanistan / PODCAST\n\nAfghanistan revisited - Part II\n\nFour months after the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, the spotlights have dimmed. But as winter sets in and the new regime tightens its grip, what is the state of the country, its people, and the Afghans that have fled and are still looking for safety? In the second part of a two-part episode, we discuss the EU’s tense, knee-jerk response to the crisis back in August and September, and what it has revealed about the EU’s current view and approach to migration policy.\n\nWith Jean-Louis De Brouwer, the Director of the European Affairs Program at the Egmont Institute; Silvia Carta, Policy Analyst in the European Migration and Diversity programme at the European Policy Centre; and Helena Hahn, junior policy analyst in the European Migration and Diversity programme at the EPC.\n\nThis episode is part of the Mercator Dialogue on Migration and Asylum or MEDAM, a research project that develops evidence-based solutions for asylum and immigration policies.\n\nAdditional sources:\n\nMEDAM Assessment Report 2021\n\nChallenges and priorities of the EU’s response to the situation in Afghanistan (Egmont Institute)\n\nAfghanistan: Commission announces €1 billion Afghan support package (12 October 2021)\n\nWith Rebecca Castermans , Helena Hahn , Silvia Carta\n\nSecurity & defence / PODCAST\n\nNATO Summit wrap-up: The road to 2030\n\nThis episode takes a closer look at the outcome of the NATO summit and the implications for EU-NATO cooperation and the transatlantic relationship, and how the Alliance plans to deal with Russia and China.

But without any real power in this area, what concrete results can we expect?\n\nIn this episode, the EPC's Social Europe and Well-Being team looks ahead at the summit and explores the tension between the dream of a social Europe and doing the work of building it. They explain why EU-wide social policies are worth pursuing and how they could be implemented successfully.\n\nThe discussion also covers health, the potential role of the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility in spurring reforms, and the disproportionate effect COVID-19 has had on women in the workplace.\n\nWith Rebecca Castermans , Simona Guagliardo , Mihai Palimariciuc , Aileen McLeod , Laura Rayner\n\nHealth / PODCAST\n\nVaccine certificates: Damned if you do, damned if you don't\n\nAn EU vaccine passport could help us get back to normal sooner, but at what cost?\n\nDespite lingering disagreement between member states, the Commission will soon present its proposal for an EU vaccine passport. The upcoming 'digital green pass' should make it easier for EU citizens to cross borders in time for the summer holidays.\n\nBut not everyone is on board; health experts warn there are still too many unknowns about the effectiveness of the existing vaccines, while others worry about the ethical, social, and privacy implications.\n\nWith vaccine certificates becoming a potential ethical, technical and political minefield, the Commission and member state governments will have to think through all possible effects and outcomes: What are the benefits of having an EU vaccine certificate? What are the potential pitfalls? And what could be some of the unforeseen, downstream consequences in the long run?\n\nIn this episode, EPC analysts try to answer those questions, covering the health, social, freedom of movement and data privacy dimensions of the debate.\n\nWith contributions from Greek Minister of Digital Governance, Kyriakos Pierrakakis, and EPC policy analysts Simona Guagliardo, Alberto-Horst Neidhardt and Andreas Aktoudianakis; and Programme Assistant Helena Hahn.\n\nWith Rebecca Castermans , Alberto-Horst Neidhardt , Simona Guagliardo , Andreas Aktoudianakis , Helena Hahn\n\nForeign policy / PODCAST\n\nFeminist Foreign Policy: What’s in a name?\n\nFeminist foreign policy is gaining momentum around the world. But what makes a foreign policy 'feminist'? And why is it important to re-evaluate defence and security policies through a decidedly feminist lens?\n\nIn this episode, I put these and other questions to Shada Islam, Senior Advisor on Asia and Africa to the EPC and well-known commentator on EU affairs, and Nina Bernarding, Director at the Centre for Feminist Foreign Policy.\n\nWe also talked about intersectionality, the need for broader inclusion in foreign policy, what an EU feminist foreign policy could and should look like and our shared admiration for New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.\n\nWith Rebecca Castermans , Shada Islam , Nina Bernarding\n\nDIGITAL EU / PODCAST\n\nThe Digital Services Act - Why data access matters\n\nWith its upcoming Digital Services Act, the European Commission intends to set clear rules for online platforms and the services they provide, which will make them more accountable and subject to public scrutiny and oversight.\n\nIf internet platforms are to be held accountable, the new rules must enable journalists and researchers to gain access to data that allows them to dissect the algorithmic systems that govern the content users get to see on their screens.\n\nIn this podcast, AlgorithmWatch and the EPC explore why data access matters; what makes it so difficult for journalists and researchers to get their hands on data from internet platforms; and how EU policymakers plan to take the decision-making on internet governance out of the private boardroom.\n\nYou will hear excerpts from a speech by Margrethe Vestager, Executive Vice President of the European Commission for A Europe Fit for the Digital Age and Competition. She spoke recently at an online webinar where AlgorithmWatch and the EPC presented the outcome and final recommendations of their 'Governing Platforms' project. We also spoke with Tom Dobber, postdoctoral researcher at the Amsterdam School of Communication Research, and Rania Wazir, data scientist and board member of the Vienna Data Science Group. They are two of many researchers who, in the context of AlgorithmWatch's 'Left on Read' campaign, gave an account of their experiences with trying to get access to data on internet platforms.\n\nThe support the European Policy Centre receives for its ongoing operations, or specifically for its podcasts and publications, does not constitute an endorsement of their contents, which reflect the views of the authors only.

After years of gridlock, Commission Vice-President of Schinas and Commissioner Johansson seem confident that this set of proposals can bridge the gap between the member states and deliver real progress on EU migration reform.\n\nMarie De Somer, Head of the EPC's Migration and Diversity programme, Olivia Sundberg Diez, EPC Policy Analyst, and Matthias Lücke, coordinator of the MEDAM project (Mercator Dialogue on Asylum and Migration)assess the New Pact's strengths and weaknesses. What is it that is 'new' about this proposal? What are the chances that it will lead to actual reform? And can the new solidarity mechanism convince the more sceptical member states?\n\nWith Marie De Somer , Rebecca Castermans , Olivia Sundberg Diez , Matthias Lücke\n\nMobility / PODCAST\n\nGreen mobility in Europe - with Lilyana Pavlova, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank\n\nOn the occasion of the European Mobility Week, our own Annika Hedberg (Head of the Sustainable Prosperity for Europe programme) and Stefan Sipka (policy analyst) talked to Vice-President Lilyana Pavlova of the European Investment Bank, the lending arm of the European Union, about the future of green mobility in Europe and the Union’s efforts to decarbonise transport in light of the EU Green Deal.\n\nThey discussed how making and encouraging the right investment decisions can drive the climate-neutral transformation of transport; the different actions the EU, and the EIB specifically, have already undertaken and what more could and should be done; and the unexpected ways the Coronacrisis has affected mobility on European roads.\n\nWith Annika Hedberg , Rebecca Castermans\n\nForeign policy / PODCAST\n\nThe renewed Franco-German partnership and its potential to build a geopolitical Europe\n\nIn this episode, Jana Puglierin and Ulrike Esther Franke from the European Council on Foreign Relations argue that it is time for the EU to get serious about its foreign policy - and explain how France and Germany can lead the way.\n\nWhen it comes to geopolitics, the EU is still something of a navel-gazer. The past decade saw one existential crisis after another, forcing the EU leadership to focus its attention inward. But while the Union was dealing with its own issues, the outside world became an increasingly chaotic and sometimes even hostile place, seeing the return of zero-sum thinking and great power rivalry. The COVID-19 crisis and the economic recession that followed have only emphasized how critical foreign policy challenges are.\n\nIn response to the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel in May of this year announced that they would back a €500 billion EU bond to help with Europe's economic recovery. The historic statement led many to wonder if the previously sputtering Franco-German engine could also force a breakthrough in EU foreign policy, especially since Germany was about to take over the presidency of the Council of the EU.\n\nJana's and Ulrike's contributions are based on the ECFR Policy Brief 'The big engine that might: How France and Germany can build a geopolitical Europe'. Their analysis draws from the findings of the third edition of the European Council on Foreign Relations' EU Coalition Explorer – a survey of foreign policy experts and government officials across the EU27 that was taken in March and April of this year.\n\nWith Rebecca Castermans\n\nEuropean Commission / PODCAST\n\nEU leaders agree on top jobs, but will it stick?\n\nAfter a marathon Council meeting, EU leaders finally settled on a new leadership team for the bloc, picking German defence minister Ursula von der Leyen as Commission president, Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel as president of the Council, IMF’s Christine Lagarde as president of the ECB, and Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Borrell as the new High Representative for foreign affairs and security policy.\n\nIn this episode, EPC Director of Studies Janis A. Emmanouilidis lifts the curtain on what was going on behind closed doors at the summit and explains how von der Leyen became the Commission president candidate everyone could get behind (sort of). He also covers what this means for the Spitzenkandidaten process, lessons learnt (introduce transnational lists, pick your Spitzenkandidat carefully, and Parliament, take the initiative!), and what will happen next.\n\nWith\n\nPopulism / PODCAST\n\nA look ahead at 2019: Can the centre hold?\n\nIn our last podcast of 2018, Director of Studies Janis A. Emmanouilidis and Junior Policy Analyst Paul Butcher take stock of where the EU stands after the December summit but also look ahead at what’s in store for Europe in 2019.\n\nNext year promises to be another turbulent year, as a divided and polarised EU will head to the polls in May. The stakes are high. Many analysts predict – or fear is the better word – that Eurosceptic, anti-globalist parties will take over the European Parliament and blow up the Union’s traditional consensus-building politics. Emmanouilidis and Butcher talk about what the growing polarisation means for the upcoming political transition and address the threat of disinformation and fake news ahead of the elections.\n\nWith Paul Butcher , Janis A. Emmanouilidis"
