        "text": "Andreas Fritz Hillgruber (18 January 1925 - 8 May 1989) was a conservative German historian. Hillgruber was influential as a military and diplomatic historian.\n\nAt his death in 1989, the American historian Francis L. Loewenheim said: \"Andreas Hillgruber was probably the leading West German historian of his generation - a scholar of indefatigable energy and fierce independence, a scholar of weighty judgment even if one did not always agree with him\".[1] Other historians were more hostile, with the British historian Richard J. Evans taking the view that Hillgruber was a great historian whose once-sterling reputation was in ruins.[2]\n\nBiography[]\n\nHillgruber was born in Angerburg, Germany (modern Wegorzewo, Poland) near the then East Prussian city of Königsberg (modern Kaliningrad, Russia).[3] Hillgruber's father lost his job as a teacher under the Third Reich.[4] Hillgruber served in the German Army from 1943 to 1945 and spent the years 1945-1948 as a POW in France.[3] During World War II, Hillgruber fought on the Eastern Front, an experience that was later to play a role in his evaluation and writing about the period.[5] In 1945, Hillgruber fled west to escape the Red Army, another experience that was to have much influence on him.[4] After his release he studied at the University of Göttingen, where he received a PhD in 1952.[3] As a student, Hillgruber was a leading protégée of the medievalist Percy Ernst Schramm, an academic who, as Eberhard Jäckel commented, regarded World War II as a normal war that regrettably the Nazis were not as skilled at waging as they should have been.[6] Much of Hillgruber's early work reflected Schramm's influence.[3] He spent the decade 1954-1964 working as school teacher.[3] In 1960 he married Karin Zieran, with whom he had three children.[3] Hillgruber worked as a professor at the University of Marburg (1965–1968), the University of Freiburg (1968–1972) and the University of Cologne (1972–1989).[3] In the late 1960s he was a target of radical student protesters.[7] He died in Cologne of throat cancer.\n\nEarly historical work[]\n\nIn the early 1950s Hillgruber still saw World War II as a conventional war, but by 1965 in his book Hitlers Strategie (Hitler's Strategy), he was arguing that the war was for Hitler a vicious, ideological war in which no mercy was to be given to one's enemies.[6] In his first book, Hitler, König Carol und Marschall Antonescu (Hitler, King Carol and Marshal Antonescu) (1953), a study of relations between Germany and Romania from 1938 to 1944 with a focus on the personalities of Adolf Hitler, King Carol II and Marshal Ion Antonescu, Hillgruber argued for the fundamental normality of German foreign policy, with the foreign policy of the Reich being no different from that of any other power.[6] By contrast, in his 1965 book Hitlers Strategie, which was Hillgruber's Habilitationsschrift, Hillgruber examined the grand strategic decision-making progress in 1940-1941 and concluded that, while Hitler had to adjust to diplomatic, economic, strategic and operational military realities, whenever possible his decisions were influenced by his racist, anti-Semitic and Social Darwinist beliefs.[6] Hillgruber's work on German foreign policy made him one of the leading players in the debates about National Socialist foreign policy.\n\nHillgruber's writings on the Soviet Union show certain constancies as well as changes over the years. He always argued that the Soviet Union was a brutal, expansionary, totalitarian power, in many ways similar to Nazi Germany. But, on the other hand, he argued that Moscow's foreign policy was conducted in a way that was rational and realistic, while the foreign policy of Berlin during the Nazi era was completely irrational and unrealistic. The turning point in Hillgruber's attitude came in 1953-1954 when he was in involved in a celebrated debate with Gerhard Weinberg and Hans Rothfels on the pages of the Vierteljahrshefte für Zeitgeschichte. Together with Hans-Günther Seraphim, Hillgruber had argued that Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, had been a \"preventive war\", forced on Hitler to prevent an imminent Soviet attack on Germany. So effectively did Weinberg and Rothfels demolish Hillgruber's arguments that he repudiated his previous views.[8] Thereafter, he maintained that Operation Barbarossa had been prompted solely by Hitler's ideological belief in the need for Lebensraum (living space) in Russia, where a massive German colonization effort was planned and the entire Russian people were to be reduced to slave status. In the 1970s and 1980s Hillgruber often attacked historians such as David Irving and Viktor Suvorov for putting forward the same arguments as he had done in 1954.[9] Along the same lines, he criticized the American neo-Nazi historian David Hoggan, who argued that the British had provoked World War II in 1939.[10] Hillgruber contended that there was a \"kernel of truth\" in Hoggan's claims in that Hitler had believed that he could invade Poland in 1939 without provoking a war with Britain, and was most unpleasantly surprised by the British declaration of war, but that, overall, Hoggan's view of Germany as the victim of an Anglo-Polish conspiracy was simply \"preposterous\".[11]\n\nThe exchange between Hillgruber and Weinberg on the pages of Vierteljahrshefte für Zeitgeschichte in 1953-54 marked the beginning of a long series of clashes between the two historians over interpretations of German foreign policy. In a 1956 book review of Hitler, König Carol und Marschall Antonescu, Weinberg criticized Hillgruber for engaging in what Weinberg considered an apologia for Germany in World War II.[12] Weinberg took issue with Hillgruber's claim that World War II began with the Anglo-French declarations of war on Germany on 3 September 1939 rather with the German attack on Poland on 1 September 1939.[12] In his 1980 monograph The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany Starting World War II 1937-1939, Weinberg noted that about the question of the war's origins that \"my view is somewhat different\" from Hillgruber's.[13] In his 1981 book World in the Balance, Weinberg stated that \"Hillgruber's interpretation is not, however, followed here\".[14]\n\nHistorical perspective[]\n\nContinuities and discontinuities of German history[]\n\nHillgruber's area of expertise was German history from 1871 to 1945, especially its political, diplomatic and military aspects. He argued for understanding this period as one of continuities.[6] In his first address as a professor at Freiburg in 1969, Hillgruber argued for understanding the entire \"Bismarck Reich\" as one of continuities between 1871-1945.[6] For Hillgruber, the continuities of the \"Bismarck Reich\" were a certain mentalité amongst German elites, namely a Weltanschuauung (world view) that emphasized an \"either-or\" outlook on international relations, Social Darwinism, a deterministic understanding of history, and dreams of worldwide expansionism.[15] However, though Hillgruber paid attention to structural factors, in his opinion it was the actions of individuals that made the difference.[16] As a member of the \"Hitler Youth generation\" and a World War II veteran, Hillgruber's major interest was why and how Germany failed as a great power.[4] These interests were reflected in the title of one of Hillgruber's better-known books, Die gescheiterte Grossmacht (The Failed Great Power) (1980), in which he examined German power politics from 1871 to 1945.[4] For Hillgruber, there were many elements of continuity in German foreign policy in the 1871–1945 period, especially with regard to Eastern Europe. Hans Mommsen wrote that the \"ground-laying works of Andreas Hillgruber... suggested the view for the continuities of German policy from the late Wilhelminian period up to the capitulation\".[17]\n\nHillgruber argued that in the 1870s, Germany had won a position of \"semi-hegemony\" in Europe, and that Otto von Bismarck had three options for preserving that \"semi-hegemony\":[18]\n\nFollow the advice of Moltke the Elder and launch a \"preventive war\" to destroy France once and all.[18]\n\nEnd Franco-German enmity by \"compensating\" France for the loss of Alsace-Lorraine by supporting the French annexation of Belgium.[19]\n\nMaintain the status quo of \"semi-hegemony\".[18]\n\nHillgruber argued that the \"war-in-sight\" crisis of 1875 was Bismarck's way of probing the European reaction towards a German \"preventive war\" to destroy France, and finding that Russia was unsupportive and Britain inclined to intervene, chose the third option.[18] Hillgruber argued that the article under the title \"Is War in Sight?\" published in a Berlin newspaper close to Bismarck, and which concluded that war was indeed in sight was a trial balloon by Bismarck to see what the international reaction would be to a German attack on France.[18] In response to negative international reaction to the \"war-in-sight\" crisis, Bismarck ultimately issued the Bad Kissingnen degree of June 25, 1877 in which he called for a situation \"in which all powers save France need us and in which they are prevented from forming coalitions against us through their ties to one another\".[18] Hillgruber argued that after the \"War-in-Sight\" crisis that Bismarck followed a conservative foreign policy aimed at upholding the international status quo which was so favourable to Germany.[18]\n\nHillgruber argued that the accession of Wilhelm II in 1888 marked a watershed in German diplomatic history.[20] To start with, the German decision not to renew the Reinsurance Treaty in 1890 marked the breakdown of the once warm relations between the Hohenzollerns and the Romanovs going back to the 18th century.[20] Instead, Wilhelm preferred a policy of Anglo-German alliance, which he attempted to achieve through a mixture of bribery and blackmail in the form of a vastly expanded German navy.[20] The huge build-up in the Navy spearheaded by Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz with his Riskflotte (Risk Fleet) concept of creating a sufficiently powerful fleet that Britain could never risk war with, had the opposite effect from the one intended on Britain.[20] Instead of leading British leaders to conclude that they could never risk a war with Germany, and therefore must ally themselves with the Reich, the build-up in German naval power led to the Anglo-German naval race of the early 20th century, and Britain aligning herself against Germany.[20] Hillgruber maintained that influenced by Friedrich von Holstein, Wilhelm came to believe in the inevitability of a \"race war\" in Eastern Europe between the \"Teutonic race\" and \"Slavic race\", which ultimately came to be a self-fulfilling prophecy.[20] Hillgruber argued that Wilhelm's policy of Weltpolitik (World Politics) which he launched with great fanfare in 1897 had with the First Moroccan Crisis in 1905 ended in failure, and that thereafter Germany was forced to retreat into a defensive posture in the \"bastion\" of Central Europe with Austria-Hungary forming the crucial \"land bridge\" to the Ottoman Empire in the Middle East.[20]\n\nTo some extent he agreed with Fritz Fischer's assessment that the differences between Imperial, Weimar and Nazi foreign policy were of degree rather than kind. Moreover, he accepted Fischer's argument that Germany was primarily responsible for World War I, but as a follower of the Primat der Aussenpolitik (\"primacy of foreign policy\") school, Hillgruber rejected Fischer's Primat der Innenpolitik (\"primacy of domestic policy\") argument as to why Germany started the First World War.[21] During the so-called \"Fischer Controversy\" which coalesced the German historical profession in the early 1960s, Hillgruber stood apart from the various right-wing historians who attempted to rebut Fischer, such as Gerhard Ritter, Hans Herzfeld, Egmont Zechlin, and Karl Dietrich Erdmann, by accepting Fischer's arguments in part instead of attempting to rebut Fischer in toto.\n\nHillgruber argued in the aftermath of Fischer's 1961 book Griff nach der Weltmacht (Grasping at World Power) that the old distinction made by the Swiss historian Walter Hofer between the \"outbreak\" of World War I in 1914, in which all of the Great Powers were equally at fault, and the \"unleashing\" of World War II in 1939, in which Germany was exclusively responsible, was no longer acceptable.[22] Hillgruber commented that Fischer had established that Germany was indeed responsible for both world wars, and Hofer's formula had to be disregarded by all serious historians.[22] Having conceded that much to Fischer, Hillgruber went on to challenge Fischer's argument that Germany had started a premeditated war of aggression in 1914.[23]\n\nHillgruber believed that what had happened in 1914 was a \"calculated risk\" on the part of the Imperial German government that had gone horribly wrong. Germany had encouraged Austria-Hungary to attack Serbia in an attempt to break the informal Triple Entente alliance between the United Kingdom, France and Russia by provoking a crisis that would concern Russia only, the so-called \"calculated risk\".[24] Hillgruber maintained that Germany did not want to cause a world war in 1914, but, by pursuing a high-risk diplomatic strategy of provoking what was supposed to be only a limited war in the Balkans, had inadvertently caused the wider conflict.[25] Hillgruber argued that, long before 1914, the leaders of Germany had been increasingly influenced by Social Darwinism and völkisch ideology, and had become obsessed with Russian industrial and military growth, leading to the view that Germany was in an untenable position that required drastic measures.[26] Hillgruber argued that, when the Austrian attack on Serbia caused Russia to mobilize instead of backing down and seeking an accommodation with Germany as expected, the German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, under strong pressure from a hawkish General Staff led by General Motke the Younger, panicked and ordered the Schlieffen Plan to be activated, thus leading to a German attack on France.[27] In Hillgruber's opinion, the \"calculated risk\" gambit was a highly dangerous and foolish one, as Bethmann Hollweg and the rest of the German leadership gratuitously failed to anticipate what the most likely Russian reaction to an Austro-Serbian war would be, and that therefore the German leadership of 1914 was extremely irresponsible in trying to use the \"calculated risk\" of an Austro-Serbian war as a diplomatic device to break the Triple Entente.[21] The German historian Annelise Thimme commented that Hillgruber's \"calculated risk\" theory to explain World War I was little more than putting \"new wine into old wine skins\".[28] Thimme noted that Hillgruber relied almost entirely upon the diary of Bethmann Hollweg's aide and friend, Kurt Riezler, to support his \"calculated risk\" thesis, which was a dubious source because portions of Riezler's diary had been forged after the war to make German foreign policy appear less aggressive then it was in 1914.[28] The Canadian historian Holger Herwig commented that Hillgruber's \"calculated risk\" theory was the most intellectually sophisticated and ingenious attempt to rebut Fischer's claim of a premeditated war of aggression in 1914, but suffered from his heavy reliance on passages in Riezler's diary likely to have been forged.[28]\n\nIn Hillgruber's opinion, after the war had begun, a split occurred within the German leadership between the moderate imperialism of the Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, who wished for territorial gains if they could be obtained, but was prepared to settle for a peace based on the pre-1914 status quo, and a more radical group centered around General Erich Ludendorff and the rest of the Third Supreme Command who wanted total victory over all of Germany's enemies, no matter what the cost, and very wide-ranging annexations in Europe, Asia and Africa.[29] In this way, Hillgruber largely followed the distinction first made by Gerhard Ritter between a moderate civilian group in the German leadership centred around Bethmann Hollweg who, while not eschewing territorial expansionism, did not insist on it as a precondition for making peace, and the more radical group in the military centered around Ludendorff, who would settle for nothing less than a war ending in making Germany the world's greatest power.[30] Hillgruber argued that Ludendorff's foreign policy, with its demand for extensive territorial gains together with plans for obtaining lebensraum in Eastern Europe through a program of ethnic cleasing and German colonization, was in many ways the prototype of National Socialist foreign policy.[31] Hillgruber argued that the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and the empire it created for Germany in Eastern Europe was the prototype for Hitler's vision of a great empire for Germany in Eastern Europe. Hillgruber wrote:\n\n\"To understand later German history one must pay special attention to a consequence of the Eastern situation in the autumn of 1918 that has often been overlooked: the widely shared and strangely irrational misconceptions concerning the end of the war that found such currency in the Weimar period. These ideas were not informed, as they should have been, by an appreciation of the enemy's superiority in the West and the inevitable step-by-step retreat of the German Western Front before the massive influx of the Americans. Nor did they indicate any understanding of the catastrophic consequences for the Central Powers following the collapse of the Balkan front after Bulgaria's withdrawal from the war. They were instead largely determined by the fact that German troops, as \"victors\" held vast strategically and economically important areas of Russia.\n\nAt the moment of the November 1918 ceasefire in the West, newspaper maps of the military situation showed German troops in Finland, holding a line from the Finnish fjords near Narva, down through Pskov-Orsha-Mogilev and the area south of Kursk, to the Don east of Rostov. Germany had thus secured the Ukraine. The Russian recognition of the Ukraine's separation exacted at Brest-Litovsk represented the key element in German efforts to keep Russia perpetually subservient. In addition, German troops held the Crimea and were stationed in smaller numbers in Transcaucasia. Even the unoccupied \"rump\" Russia appeared - with the conclusion of the German-Soviet Supplementary Treaty on 28 August 1918 - to be in firm though indirect dependency on the Reich. Thus, Hitler's long-range aim, fixed in the 1920s, of erecting a German Eastern Imperium on the ruins of the Soviet Union was not simply a vision emanating from an abstract wish. In the Eastern sphere established in 1918, this goal had a concrete point of departure. The German Eastern Imperium had already been - if only for a short time - a reality\".[32]\n\nHillgruber argued that the Weimar Republic was only a \"bridge\" between the expansionism of the Second Reich and the even radical expansionism of the Third Reich rather a new era in German diplomacy.[33] In his 1974 book Grossmachtpolitik und Militarismus im 20. Jahrundert, Hillgruber took a revisionist view of the Treaty of Versailles.[34] Far from being an intolerably harsh \"Carthaginian peace\" that crippled Germany, Hillgruber argued that Versailles was actually a moderate peace treaty that left the German state intact and with the potential to once again be a great power.[34] Furthermore, Hillgruber argued that with the disappearance of Austria-Hungary and with Soviet Russia widely mistrusted, the outcome of World War I meant that Germany now had the potential to dominate Eastern Europe in a way that never been possible before 1914.[34] Hillgruber argued that none of the states of interwar Eastern Europe had the economic or military potential to be serious rivals to Germany. In 2000, the American historian Robert M. Citino wrote that \"Hillgruber's thesis has become the consensus among German historians\".[34] Hillgruber argued that Gustav Stresemann was carrying out a \"liberal-imperialist\" policy in which he sought improved relations with France and by creating an unofficial alliance with the United States in return for which he wanted acquiescence in Germany \"revising\" her borders with Poland, the annexation of Austria, the remilitarization of the Rhineland, and the return of Eupen-Malmedy.[33] Hillgruber wrote that Stresemann was seeking the return of the Bismarckian \"semi-hegemony\", which would serve as \"the prerequisite and the basis for an active Weltpolitik\".[33] In his 1974 essay “Militarismus am Ende der Weimarer Republik und im “Dritten Reich” (\"Militarism at the End of the Weimar Republic and in the Third Reich\"), Eberhard Kolb noted that:\n\n“Referring to M. Geyer’s research, which had not then been published, Hillgruber pointed out from the mid-1920s onwards the Army leaders had developed and propagated new social conceptions of a militarist kind, tending towards a fusion of the military and civilian sectors and ultimately a totalitarian military state (Wehrstaat)”.[35]\n\nHillgruber wrote that after the fall of Hans von Seeckt in 1926, Kurt von Schleicher became “in fact, if not in name”, the \"military-political head of the Reichswehr”.[36] Hillgruber wrote that Schleicher's triumph was also the triumph of the \"modern\" faction within the Reichswehr who favored a total war ideology and wanted Germany to become a dicatorship in order to wage total war upon the other nations of Europe in order to win the \"world power status\" that had been sought unsuccessfully in the last war.[37] The total war ideology of the Reichswehr and the attendant demand that Germany be transformed into a militaristic, totalitarian Wehrstaat (defense state) went a long way to explaining why almost the entire Reichswehr welcomed the coming of the National Socialist dictatorship in 1933.[37]\n\nDespite the example provided by Ludendorff and his circle, for Hillgruber, the changes in German foreign policy introduced by National Socialist Ostpolitik (Eastern Policy) were so radical as to be almost differences of kind rather than degree. He argued that Nazi foreign policy was an extremely radical version of traditional German foreign policy.[38] Furthermore, he argued that what during the Weimar era had been the end became, for the Nazis, just the means. He set out a thesis that goals such as the Remilitarization of the Rhineland and the Anschluss with Austria, which had been the end-goals during the Weimar period, were just the beginning for the Nazis. Unlike the Weimar government, the Nazis' desire to re-militarize was only a step on the road to the complete domination of all Europe, and eventual world domination.[39]\n\nIn a 1978 essay \"Das Russlandbild der führenden deutschen Militärs\" (\"The Picture of Russia held by the Leadership of the German Military\"), Hillgruber examined the views about the Soviet Union held by the German military elite in the period June 1940 to June 1941.[40] According to Hillgruber, the following assumptions were shared by all of Germany's leading generals:\n\nThe Wehrmacht was ill-informed about the Soviet Union, especially the military and the economy.[40]\n\nBecause of the paucity of information, Wehrmacht thinking about the Soviet Union were based upon traditional German stereotypes of Russia as a primitive, backward \"Asiatic\" country, a \"colossus with feet of clay\" that lacked the strength to stand up to a superior opponent.[41]\n\nThe leadership of the Wehrmacht viewed war with the Soviet Union from an extremely narrow military viewpoint with little consideration given to politics, the economy or culture.[41] The industrial capacity of the Soviet Union was not considered at all as a factor that might influence the outcome of a German-Soviet war.[41]\n\nThe average soldier of the Red Army was considered brave and tough, but the Red Army officer corps were held in contempt.[41]\n\nThe Wehrmacht leadership after the victory over France was in a state of hubris with the Wehrmacht being seen as more or less invincible.[41]\n\nAs such, it was assumed that the Soviet Union was destined to be defeated, and that it take Germany between six to eight weeks to destroy the Soviet Union.[41]\n\nHillgruber argued that these assumptions about the Soviet Union shared by the entire miliary elite allowed Hitler to push through a \"war of annihilation\" against the Soviet Union with the assistance of \"several military leaders\", even through it was quite clear to the military that such a war would violate all standards of civilized warfare and would be waged in the most inhumane fashion possible.[41]\n\nThe Stufenplan concept[]\n\nFrom the 1960s on, Hillgruber was regarded as one of the world's foremost authorities on German military-diplomatic history, his theory about Hitler having a Stufenplan (stage-by-stage plan) being especially influential.[42] In 1989 the American historian Jerry Z. Muller called Hillgruber \"the most distinguished German diplomatic historian of his generation\".[43] Hillgruber argued that Adolf Hitler had a Stufenplan (stage-by-stage plan) for conquest and genocide in Eastern Europe, and then the world. In the 1960s-70s, Hillgruber was one of the leaders of a group of German historians comprising Klaus Hildebrand, Gunter Moltman and J. Henke who argued that far from being “haphazard” as was thought after the war, that Hitler possessed and attempted to execute a coherent and detailed foreign policy programme aiming at nothing less than world conquest.[44] Hillgruber stated that Hitler’s foreign policy “geographically was designed to span the globe; ideologically, too , the doctrine of universal anti-Semitism and Social Darwinism, fundamental to his programme, were intended to embrace the whole of mankind”.[44] According to Hillgruber, the conquest of the Soviet Union and the intended alliance with Britain were the most important stages of Hitler’s Stufenplan.[44] Hillgruber claimed that through Hitler was highly flexible in ways of realizing his \"progamme\", Hitler was consistent throughout his political career in trying to achieve the \"programme\" he worked out in the 1920s.[45] Hillgruber claimed that the outbreak of a world war in 1939 which Hitler had caused, but had not planned with the invasion of Poland brought forward the timing of \"programme\".[45] Hillgruber used as examples to support his theory the Z Plan of January 1939 and Hitler's plans in June 1940 for annexing much of Africa together with key strategic points in the Atlantic as evidence that Hitler was moving forward drastically the timing of his planned ultimate show-down with the United States.[45]\n\nAccording to this argument, the first stage of Hitler's plan consisted of the military build-up of German strength and the achievement of the Weimar Republic's traditional foreign policy goals.[46] The second stage was to be a series of swift regional wars to destroy such states as Poland, Czechoslovakia and France.[46] The third stage was to be a war to liquidate the Soviet Union and what Hitler regarded as its \"Judaeo-Bolshevik\" regime.[47] The fourth stage was to be a war against the United States by the now Greater Germany in alliance with the British Empire and Japan. Hillgruber argued that after the conquest of the Soviet Union, Hitler wanted to seize most of Africa, build a huge navy and in alliance with both the Japanese and the British to engage the United States in a \"War of the Continents\" for world domination.[48] As Hillgruber described it:\n\n\"After the creation of an European continental empire buttressed by the conquest of Russia, a second stage of imperial expansion was to follow with the acquisition of complementary territory in Central Africa and a system of bases to support a strong surface fleet in the Atlantic and Indian Ocean. Germany, in alliance with Japan and if possible also Britain, would in the first place isolate the USA and confine it to the Western hemisphere. Then, in the next generation, there would be a \"war of the continents\" in which the \"Germanic empire of the Germanic nation\" would fight America for world supremacy\".[49]\n\nHillgruber wrote that:\n\n\"These enormous schemes, and particularly their connection with racist ideology, were, to be sure, the program of a single individual. But in the case of such prominent provisions as the revision of the Versailles Treaty and the creation of a \"Greater Germany\", they overlapped with the aims of the old German leadership and the fantasies of a large part of the German public that had never assimilated the loss of the war. To this one must add, however, that the essence of Hitler's program \"violated all standards and concepts of German foreign policy to such a radical degree that it... did not penetrate the consciousness of the German public\", despite its continual proclamation in his speeches from 1926 to 1930\".[50]\n\nThe American historian of modern Germany Gordon A. Craig praised Hillgruber for his \"masterful delineation of Hitler's grand strategical plan\".[51]\n\nHillgruber maintained that the strategy of Blitzkrieg was based largely on economic factors, namely, that for the earlier stages of the stufenplan, Germany did not have the economic resources for a long war, and that therefore a military programme based upon quality, not quantity, was the most rational use of German economic capacity.[52] Hillgruber argued that Hitler's desire to postpone the final struggle with the United States to the last stage of the stufenplan was likewise determined by economic considerations, namely that only a Germany with sufficient lebensraum ruling most of Eurasia and Africa would be immune to the effects of blockade, and have the necessary economic resources to match the enormous economic capacity of the United States.[52] In the debate between the \"Continentists\" such as Hugh Trevor-Roper, Axel Kuhn, and Eberhard Jäckel, who argued that Hitler wanted only to seize Europe, and the \"Globalists\", who argued that Hitler wanted to conquer the entire world, Hillgruber was definitely in the latter camp. As a globalist historian, Hillgruber argued that Hitler was always intent upon a war with the Soviet Union and he maintained that Hitler's interest in Admiral Erich Raeder's \"Mediterranean plan\" in the fall of 1940 as an alternative to Barbarossa was half hearted at best, and that right from June 1940 Hitler was firmly committed to turning east.[53] Other historians, such as the German historian Wolfgang Michalka, the Anglo-German historian H.W Koch and the Israeli historian Martin van Creveld, have contended that Hitler's efforts to form an anti-British Eurasian \"continental bloc\" that was to include the Soviet Union in late 1940 as a diplomatic prelude to the \"Mediterranean plan\" were sincere, that until December 1940 Hitler's first priority was in defeating Britain, and that it was only when Hitler gave his approval to Operation Barbarossa on 18 December 1940 that he finally lost interest in Raeder's \"Mediterranean strategy\".[53] The Greek historian Aristotle Kallis wrote that the best evidence suggests that in late 1940 Hitler was serious about carrying out Raeder's \"Mediterranean plan\", but only within certain strict limits and conditions, and that he saw the \"Mediterranean plan\" as part of the preparations for Barbarossa by defeating Britain first.[54]\n\nHillgruber regarded Hitler as a fanatical ideologue with a firmly fixed programme, and criticized the view of him as a grasping opportunist with no real beliefs other than the pursuit of power - a thesis promoted by such British historians as A.J.P. Taylor and Alan Bullock, which he thought profoundly shallow and facile.[55] Moreover, he categorically rejected Taylor's contention that the German invasion of Poland was an \"accident\" precipitated by diplomatic blunders.[56] Hillgruber argued adamantly that the German invasion of Poland was a war of aggression caused by Hitler's ideological belief in war and the need for Lebensraum (living space). World War II, for Hillgruber, really consisted of two wars. One was an europäisches Normalkrieg (\"normal European war\") between the Western powers and Germany, a conflict which Hitler caused but did not really want.[57] The other war - which Hitler both caused and most decidedly did want (as evidenced in part by Mein Kampf) - was the German-Soviet one, a savage, merciless and brutal all-out struggle of racial and ideological extermination between German National Socialism and Soviet Communism.[57]\n\nIn Hillgruber's opinion, Hitler's foreign policy program was totally unrealistic and incapable of being realized. Hillgruber argued that Hitler's assumption that a German \"renunciation\" of naval and colonial claims, in exchange for British recognition of all of Europe as lying within the German sphere of influence, was based on an unviable notion that British interests were limited only to the naval and colonial spheres.[58] Hillgruber noted that Britain was just as much a European as a world power, and would never accept so far-reaching a disruption of the balance of power as Hitler proposed in the 1920s in Mein Kampf.[58] Hillgruber wrote that Neville Chamberlain for all his attachment to appeasement, once he learned that Hitler’s aims were not limited towards revising Versailles, ultimately went to war with Germany in September 1939 rather than accept the disruption of the balance of power that Hitler was attempting to carry out\"[59] Likewise, Hillgruber argued that Hitler's contempt for the Soviet Union, especially the fighting power of the Red Army, was a dangerous illusion.[60] Hillgruber argued that the lack of British interest in Hitler's proposed anti-Soviet alliance temporarily derailed Hitler's foreign policy programme in the late 1930s, and led to the ideas of the Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop whose anti-British foreign policy programme Hillgruber called the \"very opposite\" of Hitler's taking precedence in the period 1938-41[61] In a 1967 review, the American historian Howard Smyth called Hitlers strategie \"a magnificent work based on a thorough study of all source material and literature available in German, English, French, and Italian, and on translations from Russian and Japanese\".[62] Hillgruber argued that Hitler drew a distinction between winning Germany a Grossmacht (great-power) position through Kontinentalimperium (Continental imperialism) and the goal of Weltmacht (\"World Power\") where Germany would embark on building a huge navy and win a massive colonial empire in Africa and Asia as the prelude to war with the United States.[63] In addition, Hillgruber argued that Hitler did not wish to destroy the British Empire as he believed that the United States would take advantage of the collapse of the British imperialism to seize British colonies for itself, but at the same time, Churchill's repeated refusals of Hitler's offers to begin peace talks in 1940-41 left him with no other choice, but to work for the destruction of British power.[63]\n\nIn his 1974 article \"England's Place In Hitler's Plans for World Dominion\", Hillgruber argued that, during the Nazi period, German foreign policy went through ten different phases. Hillgruber contended that, during the early phases, Hitler was intent on having the anti-Soviet alliance with Britain he had written of in Mein Kampf and Zweites Buch. By the time of the Hossbach Memorandum of 1937, Hillgruber argued, Hitler was undertaking a course of expansion either \"without Britain\" or, preferably, \"with Britain\", but if necessary \"against Britain\".[64] By the late 1930s, when it became clear that Britain had no interest in his overtures, German foreign policy turned anti-British as reflected in the Z Plan of January 1939 for a gigantic German fleet that would crush the Royal Navy by 1944.\n\nHillgruber noted that in 1939, when war threatened over Poland, unlike in 1938 when war threatened to occur over Czechoslovakia, Hitler received overwhelming support from the Wehrmacht leadership.[56] The reason for this difference, in Hillgruber's opinion, was the rampant anti-Polish feelings in the German Army. In support of this argument, Hillgruber quoted from a letter written by General Eduard Wagner, who was one of the officers involved in the abortive putsch of 1938, who wrote to his wife just before the invasion of Poland, \"We believe we will make quick work of the Poles, and in truth, we are delighted at the prospect. That business must be cleared up\" (emphasis in the original).[56] Hillgruber noted because of anti-Polish prejudices that in 1939 Fall Weiss served to unite Hitler and the German military in a way that Fall Grün had failed to do in 1938.\n\nHillgruber argued that Hitler's decision to declare war on the United States before he had defeated the Soviet Union was due to Hitler's belief that the United States might quickly defeat Japan, and hence it was better to engage the Americans while they were still involved in a two-front war.[65] Likewise, Hillgruber argued that Hitler's decision to take on the United States in December 1941 was influenced by his belief that the Soviet Union would be defeated by no later than the summer of 1942.[66]\n\nIn his 1965 book Hitlers Strategie, Hillgruber caused some controversy with his argument that a French attack on the Siegfried Line in the autumn of 1939 would have resulted in a swift German defeat.[67] In 1969, the French historian Albert Merglen expanded on Hillgruber's suggestion by writing a PhD thesis depicting a counter-factual successful French offensive against the Siegfried Line.[67] However, many historians have criticized both Hillgruber and Merglen for ignoring the realities of the time, and for using the advantage of historical hindsight too much in making these judgements.[67]\n\nHillgruber's Stufenplan concept was and is not universally accepted by historians. The British historian E.M. Robertson wrote that through the Stufenplan concept seemed to explain much of Hitler's foreign policy, but noted that Hitler himself never spoken of having any \"stages\" or even a plan at all.[68] Moreover, Robertson commented that Hitler's use of the phrase \"world power or collapse\" in Mein Kampf is ambiguous and can be interpreted in several different ways.[69] However, Robertson went on to note in support of the Stufenplan thesis several speeches Hitler made to his senior officers in late 1938-early 1939 where Hitler did claimed to be working out some sort of a master plan in his foreign policy, albeit in a very improvised and flexible way.[70] The Anglo-German historian H.W. Koch in a 1983 essay criticized Hillgruber's picture of Hitler following rigidly preconceived foreign policy he was alleged to have worked out in the 1920s.[71] Koch wrote against Hillgruber that Hitler did not want a war with Poland and the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact in his view was meant to pressure the Poles into making concessions instead of being as Hillgruber claimed a plan for partitioning Poland.[72] The Hungarian-American historian John Lukacs criticized Hillgruber's portrayal of Hitler following a Stufenplan, arguing that there was much opportunism and contingency in Hitler's strategy, with little sign of a masterplan.[73] In Lukacs's opinion, Operation Barbarossa was primarily an anti-British move intended to force Britain to surrender by defeating the Soviet Union.[74] Likewise, Lukacs argued that Hitler's statement to the League of Nations High Commissioner for Danzig, Carl Jacob Burckhardt, in August 1939, stating that \"Everything I undertake is directed against Russia…\", which Hillgruber cited as evidence of Hitler's ultimate anti-Soviet intentions, was merely an effort to intimidate Britain and France into abandoning Poland.[75] In the same way, Lukacs took issue with Hillgruber's claim that the war against Britain was of only \"secondary\" importance to Hitler compared to the war against the Soviet Union.[76] The Greek historian Aristotle Kallis wrote that there is \"no conclusive evidence\" that Hitler \"...had a clear plan for world domination...\"[77]\n\nAs a conservative historian[]\n\nIn the 1970s, Hillgruber, together with his close associate Klaus Hildebrand, was involved in a very acrimonious debate with Hans-Ulrich Wehler over the merits of the Primat der Aussenpolitik (\"primacy of foreign politics\") and Primat der Innenpolitik (\"primacy of domestic politics\") schools.[78] Hillgruber and Hildebrand made a case for the traditional Primat der Aussenpolitik approach to diplomatic history with the stress on examining the records of the relevant foreign ministry and studies of the foreign policy decision-making elite.[79] Wehler, who favored the Primat der Innenpolitik, for his part contended that diplomatic history should be treated as a sub-branch of social history, calling for theoretically-based research, and argued that the real focus should be on the study of the society in question.[79]\n\nIn 1971, Hillgruber was a leading critic of the Quadripartite Agreement on the status of Berlin accusing the West German government and the three western powers with rights in Berlin, namely the United States, Great Britain and France of granting approval to what he saw as the illegal Soviet occupation of eastern Germany and the equally illegitimate East German regime while at the same time accepted the partition of Berlin as permanent.[80] Hillgruber wrote that the agreement had confirmed the \"status quo minus\" of Berlin, and that the agreement was too vague with the reference to the \"existing conditions in the relevant area\".[80] Finally, Hillgruber charged that the West had given in by promising to limit contact between West and East Berlin and allowing a Soviet consulate to be established in West Berlin, which Hillgruber claimed was an implicit admission of the Soviet claim that West Berlin was not part of the Federal Republic.[80]\n\nAs a right-wing historian, Hillgruber often felt uncomfortable with the increasing left-wing influence in German academia from the late 1960s onwards.[81] In his 1974 textbook, Deutsche Geschichte 1945-1972 (German History 1945-1972), Hillgruber complained that radicals influenced by \"the forces of doctrinaire Marxism-Leninism\", and leaning towards East Germany, were having too much influence in West German higher education.[81] In the same book, Hillgruber attacked the New Left for lacking the proper methodological tools for the understanding of German history.[82] In particular, Hillgruber argued that the Primat der Innenpolitik thesis employed by historians such as Wehler was not a proper scholarly device, but was instead \"an apparent scholarly legitimation\" for the New Left to advance its agenda in the present.[82] Hillgruber accused Wehler of \"quasi-totalitarian\" goals for the German historical profession, and called for conservative historians to make a sustained offensive to defeat Wehler and his \"cultural revolutionaries\" for the sake of saving history as a profession in Germany.[5] Likewise, despite his partial agreement with Fischer about the origins of the First World War, Hillgruber frequently fought against Fischer's interpretation of the Second Reich as a uniquely aggressive power threatening its neighbours throughout its existence.[5] In 1990, Hillgruber was a posthumous contributor to the book Escape Into War?, a collection of essays examining Imperial German foreign policy that attacked Fischer and the left-wing Bielefeld school of historians headed by Wehler for \"relativising\" history, and making \"banal\" statements[83] The Canadian historian James Retallack took the view that Hillgruber together with his allies Klaus Hildebrand, Lothar Gall, Gregor Schöllgen and Michael Stürmer were guilty of a \"grave injustice\" with their attacks in Escape Into War? on those German historians like Fischer and Wehler critical of Imperial German foreign policy.[83] Hillgruber expressed considerable disappointment with the republication of the once-banned work by Eckart Kehr, which Hillgruber dismissed as merely \"trendy Marxisants\" typical of the intellectual environment of the 1960s-70s.[5] In a book review published in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on 18 June 1979, Hillgruber for the most part offered a highly unfavorable judgment of David Irving's work.[84] Despite his criticism, Hillgruber ended his review with the comment that Irving's work \"amounts to an indubitable and in no way small merit of Irving\".[84] The American historian John Lukacs thought it a sign of Hillgruber's general right-wing biases that he attached no such qualifying words of praise like those he gave to Irving during any of his attacks on left-wing historians like Eberhard Jäckel and Hans-Ulrich Wehler.[84] As part of his criticism of the left-wing social historians, Hillgruber affirmed what he considered the primacy of traditional diplomatic-military history by writing:\n\n\"Despite the significance of all long-term developments, the great differences between the great world powers have basically determined the course of general history, even in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries\"[85]\n\nThe Canadian historian Holger Herwig wrote in 1982 that Hillgruber was a follower of Leopold von Ranke's Primat der Aussenpolitik concept.[86] Herwig wrote that for Hillgruber history was made by small political and military elites who were not prisoners of forces beyond their control, and that instead made history through their choices and decisions.[86]\n\nA self-proclaimed conservative and nationalist, Hillgruber never denied nor downplayed the crimes committed in Germany's name and in no way can he be considered a Holocaust denier; but he argued that Germany as a great power had the potential to do much good for Europe.[3] For Hillgruber, the tragedy was that this potential was never fulfilled. In his view, the problem did not lie with Germany's domination of Eastern and Central Europe, but rather with the particular way this domination was exercised by the Nazis.[3] He argued that German-Russian, German-Polish, German-Czech, German-Hungarian and German-Jewish relations were traditionally friendly, and lamented that the Nazis had shattered these friendly ties.[87] Others contended that these bonds of friendship had never existed except as figments of Hillgruber's imagination. For Hillgruber, Germany's defeat in 1945 was a catastrophe that ended both the ethnic German presence in Eastern Europe and Germany as a great power in Europe.[6] As someone from the \"Germanic East\", Hillgruber often wrote nostalgically of the lost Heimat of East Prussia where he had grown up.[6] Hillgruber once responded to a question about what was his fondest wish by replying \"to live a life in Königsberg\".[88]East German, Soviet, Polish, Hungarian and Czechoslovak counterparts, denounced him as a German chauvinist, racist and imperialist, and accused him of glorifying the Drang nach Osten concept.[89]\n\nHowever, Hillgruber was prepared to accept, albeit grudgingly, what he often called Germany's \"Yalta frontiers\" after the Yalta Conference of 1945.[90] What he was not prepared to accept was the partition of Germany. He often complained that the West German government was not doing enough to re-unite Germany. In a 1981 speech, he called on Bonn to create a new German nationalism based on respect for human rights that would ensure that future generations would not lose sight of the dream of re-unification.[91]\n\nThe intentionalist historian[]\n\nHillgruber was an Intentionist on the origins of the Holocaust debate, arguing that Adolf Hitler was the driving force behind the Holocaust. This set Hillgruber against Functionalist historians such as Hans Mommsen and Martin Broszat, whose \"revisionist\" claims on the origins of the Holocaust Hillgruber found distasteful.[92] Hillgruber was well known for arguing that there was a close connection between Hitler's foreign policy and anti-Semitic policies and that Hitler's decision to invade the Soviet Union in 1941 was linked to the decision to initiate the Holocaust.[66] Hillgruber argued that the Kernstück (Nucleus) of Hitler's racist Weltanschauung (world view) was to be found in Mein Kampf. He believed that the Holocaust was meant to be launched only with the invasion of the Soviet Union.[93] In Hillgruber's view, Hitler's frequent references to \"Judaeo-Bolshevism\", to describe both Jews and Communism, betrayed his desire to destroy both simultaneously.[93] In Hillgruber's opinion, Operation Barbarossa had been conceived as, and was, a war of total extermination against what Hitler saw as \"Judaeo-Bolshevik\" system in the Soviet Union.[94] Hillgruber was noteworthy as the first historian to argue for the connection between Operation Barbarossa and the decision to begin the Holocaust.[95] In Hillgruber's opinion, for Hitler:\n\n\"The conquest of European Russia, the cornerstone of the continental European phase of his program, was thus for Hitler inextricably linked with the extermination of these \"bacilli\", the Jews. In his conception they had gained dominance over Russia with the Bolshevik Revolution. Russia thereby became the center from which a global danger radiated, particularly threatening to the Aryan race and its German core. To Hitler, Bolshevism meant the consummate rule of Jewry, while democracy - as it had developed in Western Europe and Weimar Germany - represented a preliminary stage of Bolshevism, since the Jews there won a leading, if not yet a dominant influence. This racist component of Hitler's thought was so closely interwoven with the central political element of his program, the conquest of European Russia, that Russia's defeat and the extermination of the Jews were - in theory as later in practice - inseparable for him. To the aim of expansion per se, however, Hitler gave not racial, but political, strategic, economic and demographic underpinnings\".[96]\n\nIn a 1985 conference, Hillgruber declared that the history of the Second World War could not be treated as a separate event from the Holocaust, and that for the National Socialist leadership, there were no difference between the war against the Jews and the war against the Allies - both events were different sides of the same coin.[97] As such, Hillgruber decried the tendency on the part of historians' to sever the history of World War II from the \"Final Solution\", and urged historians to start writing histories that took account that the National Socialist \"racial revolution\" and plans for a German \"world power status\" were all part and parcel of the same process.[97]\n\nHillgruber argued that anti-Semitism was very important for the \"intergal integration\" of the various disparate elements of the National Socialist movement, but it was not crucial for the NSDAP's electoral success in the early 1930s, which Hillgruber believed had more to do with the impact of the Great Depression rather with any surge in anti-Semitism.[98] Hillgruber argued that for most ordinary people in Germany who became anti-Semitic that it was a case of them becoming anti-Semitics after becoming National Socialists as opposed to anti-Semitics becoming National Socialists.[99] Hillgruber maintained that Hitler had always intended to exterminate the Jews since the early 1920s, contending that for Hitler a \"racial revolution\" was needed to win a \"global power\" position, but that he at first needed to fulfill certain preconditions.[100] Hillgruber contended that for Hitler the invasion of Poland in 1939 was meant to be both the beginning of both the \"biological revolution\" and to be only a local war, and that British and French declarations of war were an unpleasant surprise which interrupted the full execution of his plans.[101] As such, in Hillgruber's view, Hitler had to put off the full execution of his plans that already began with the war against Poland until France was defeated.[102] In the same way, Hillgruber maintained that the Action T4 programme was part of Hitler's attempts to build a national consensus for genocide and to enlist the support of the bureaucracy (most of whom had began their careers under the Second Reich or the Weimar Republic) for his genocidal politics.[100] Hillgruber argued that the limited public protests that took place in 1941 against the Action T4 killings against a backdrop of widespread public approval or indifference to the killings of fellow Germans who just happened to be mentally and/or physically disabled showed Hitler just how easy it was to create a genocidal national consensus, and that crucially the bureaucracy were not amongst those who protested.[103] This was especially noteworthy as the Action T4 killings took place within Germany, and that victims of Action T4 were the amongst the most vulnerable, hapless and weakest elements in German society - people that Hillgruber argued that by all rights should have inspired compassion and kindness rather than a merciless drive to kill them all.[104] Hillgruber maintained that if the Action T4 killings of fellow Germans caused only limited protests in Germany, then Hitler could had reasonably expected that killings of Jews (the vast majority of whom were not German) outside of Germany in Eastern Europe would meet with even less public opposition.[105]\n\nIn the 1984 essay \"War in the East and the Extermination of the Jews\", Hillgruber argued that based on a reading of Hitler's early speeches and writings that Hitler associated Jews and the Communists as one and the same, and accordinlgy Hitler regarded the destruction of the Jews and the Soviet Union as part and parcel of the same process.[106] Hillgruber argued that the decision to begin the Holocaust was probably taken during the very earliest stages of the planning for Operation Barbarossa in late June-early July 1940, but that the surviving documentary evidence was not conclusive on this point.[107] Based upon Hitler's statements to his generals about the coming war of annihilation against “Judeo-Bolshevism” and Reinhard Heydrich's orders to re-establish the Einsatzgruppen, Hillgruber argued that the decision to start the Endlösung was not taken later than March 1941.[108] Through Hillgruber noted that the massacres of Soviet Jews by the Einsatzgruppen that were to culminate in their extermination were often justified under the grounds of anti-partisan operations, that this was just a mere \"excuse\" for the German Army's considerable involvement in the Holocaust in Russia and the term war crimes and crimes against humanity were indeed correct labels for what happened.[109] Hillgruber maintained that the slaughter of about 2.2 million defenceless men, women and children for the reasons of racist ideology cannot possibly be justified for any reason, and that those German generals who claimed that the Einsatzgruppen were a necessary anti-partisan response were lying.[110] Hillgruber described the relationship between the Einsatzgruppen and the Wehrmacht as follows:\n\n\"The practical cooperation of the regular army and the Einsatzgruppen with regard to Jews took this form: Immediately after gaining control of an area the army commander issued orders for the Jews to be registered. Instructions for Jewish residents to come forward and identify themselves were provided on large-format posters, making it easy for the units of the security police and SD to place them under arrest - unless some of them, having learned of their intended fate, fled to the woods or otherwise \"went underground\"... Just like the Einsatzgruppen in the Rear Army areas, in parts of the Soviet Union placed under German civilian administration the \"Higher SS and Police Leaders\" had a prescribed set of duties - that included the systematic killing of Jews\".[111]\n\nHillgruber took a rather extreme \"No Hitler, no Holocaust\" position. He believed it was Hitler alone who made the Holocaust possible.[112] He argued that, even if the Nazis had come to power under some other leader such as Hermann Göring or Joseph Goebbels, for example, the Jews would have suffered persecution and discrimination, but not genocide.[113] Hillgruber once presented at a historians' conference in 1984 a counter-factual scenario whereby, had it been a coalition of the German National People's Party and the Stahlhelm that took power in 1933 without the NSDAP, all the anti-Semitic laws in Germany that were passed between 1933 and 1938 would still have been passed, but there would have been no Holocaust.[114] He maintained that the other Nazi leaders such as Göring, Goebbels and Heinrich Himmler willingly participated in the Holocaust, as did many other Germans in the ever-widening \"rings of responsibility\" for the Holocaust, but that without Hitler's decisive role there would have been no Holocaust.[112] Despite his emphasis on the role of Hitler, Hillgruber often stressed that the Holocaust was the work of both the German state bureaucracy and the Nazi Party, the apolitical and committed Nazis while \"the mass of the German population\" accepted \"unvermeidlicherweise nur unzulänglich verschleierten Vorgangs\" (\"a process that could never be more than inadequately concealed\").[115] Hillgruber wrote that:\n\n\"The evident ease with which people could be recruited and \"manipulated\", under the civilized conditions of the 20th century, to treat human beings like merchandise and kill them in large numbers ... is the most disturbing aspect; the large number of university graduates involved is the most deeply alarming. One must raise the question - which touches anthropology, social psychology and individual psychology - of a possible repetition under other ideological conditions, in actual or perceived extreme situations and circumstances. Beyond the historian's responsibility to keep alive the memory of the millions of victims, this question - which points to a central problem of the present and future, and thus transcends the historian's task - presents a challenge to us all.\"[116]\n\nThe Historikerstreit[]\n\nZweierlei Untergang[]\n\nHillgruber was one of the protagonists in the so-called Historikerstreit, the Historians' Dispute (or Historians' Controversy) of 1986-87. Hillgruber felt that the Holocaust was a horrific tragedy, but just one of many that occurred in the 20th century. In a 1986 interview, Hillgruber stated there was no moral difference between the Soviet regime and the Nazi regime, and that the Holocaust was not unique.[117] In his highly controversial 1986 essay \"Der Zusammenbruch im Osten 1944/45\" (\"The Collapse in the East 1944/45\") from his book Zweierlei Untergang (Two Kinds of Ruin), Hillgruber highlighted the sufferings of Germans in what was then eastern Germany, who had to flee or were expelled or killed by the Red Army.[3] He documented the mass gang rape of German women and girls, and widespread looting and massacres of German civilians by the Soviet army.[3][5][9] He paid homage to those who had had to evacuate the German population and to those soldiers who did their best to stem the Soviet advance.[3][5][9] Hillgruber described the efforts to evacuate the German population, much of which was hopelessly bungled by corrupt and incompetent Nazi Party officials, and the savage and desperate fighting which marked the bloody climax of the war on the Eastern Front.[3][5]\n\nFor Hillgruber, the end of the \"German East\", in which he had been born and grew up, was just as tragic as the Holocaust and marked the end of what he considered to be Eastern Europe's best chance for progress.[118] Hillgruber's intention in Zweierlei Untergang was to show the \"obscure intertwinement\" between the Shoah and the expulsion of the Germans from Eastern Europe.[119] Hillgruber described it as \"a tragedy for all of Europe\" that World War II ended with Eastern Europe brought into the Soviet sphere of influence, with the expulsion of the Germans from Eastern Europe (which, Hillgruber pointed out, included his family) and with Germany reduced from a great power to a Cold War battlefield between the United States and the Soviet Union.[118] The two kinds of ruin in the title were the Holocaust and the expulsion of Reichsdeutsche (Reich Germans; those Germans living in Germany) and Volksdeutsche (ethnic Germans living outside of Germany). For Hillgruber, both events, or \"national catastrophes\" as he preferred to call them, were equally tragic.[120][121] He blamed both ultimately on the Nazis and their ideologically driven and inhuman expansionism. The subtitle of Zweierlei Untergang, Die Zerschlagung des Deutschen Reiches und das Ende des europäischen Judentums (The Smashing of the German Reich and the End of European Jewry), reflected his controversial view of the moral equivalence of the ending of Germany as a great power and the Holocaust. In the same essay, Hillgruber attacked American President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill for supporting at various war-time conferences the expansion of Poland and the Soviet Union at the expense of Germany.[122] Hillgruber asserted that Germany had every moral right to keep all the territory that had belonged to the Reich in 1914, plus Austria and the Sudetenland, and that any effort to take land away from Germany was profoundly wrong.[122] Hillgruber wrote that the doomed German defence in the East was \"justified\" as every city, every town and every village in eastern Germany the Soviets took was \"lost forever for Germany and its German inhabitants\".[123] In Hillgruber's opinion, what he considered to be the great wrong that Germany was to lose some of its eastern territories after losing the war could only be explained by anti-German prejudices that he accused American and especially British leaders of holding.[122] Hillgruber wrote that the expulsion of the Germans from Eastern Europe was not a response to Nazi crimes, but was instead part of pre-existing Allied plans to destroy Germany, writing that the expulsions were not: \"some kind of \"answer\" to the crimes of German despotism - the full extent of which was not actually recognised while the war was on. They also corresponded to objectives which had long been harboured by the main enemy powers, and which were put into effect during the war\".[124]\n\nIn an apparent disavowal of his own criticism of the Anglophobic American historical writer David Hoggan in his 1967 book Germany and the Two World Wars, Hillgruber claimed in his 1986 essay that it had been British policy to seek the destruction of Germany since 1907 starting with Sir Eyre Crowe's memo on Germany entitled \"Memorandum on the Present State of British Relations with France and Germany\".[122] Hillgruber claimed that were irrational anti-German prejudices within the British elite drove British policy, and that what happened to Germany in 1945 was merely the culmination of a long-term British policy to destroy Germany as a nation, which every British government had pursued since 1907.[122] According to Hillgruber: \"Anti-Prussianism was the basis of the British war policy against Germany\".[125] Hillgruber accused the British of holding to \"a negative image of Prussia, exaggerated to the point of becoming a myth\", which led them to seek the utter destruction of the Prussian-German state in World War II, and blinded them to the fact that a strong Central European state led by Prussia was the only thing that prevented the \"flooding\" of Central Europe by the Red Army.[119] In this way, Hillgruber argued \"that the amputation of the Reich in favor of a greater Poland was a war aim of the Allies long before Auschwitz\", and asserted that the loss of the German eastern territories was due to anti-German prejudices.[126] Hillgruber claimed that the Anglo-American strategic bombing offensive against Germany was just as much a policy of Anglo-American genocide for the Germans as the policy of genocide that Germans were waging against European Jews at the same time.[120] Perhaps most controversially, Hillgruber described how the German Wehrmacht acted in what he regarded as a \"heroic\" and \"self-sacrificing\" way in defending the German population against the Red Army and the \"orgy of revenge\" that they perpetrated in 1944-1945.[127] Hillgruber wrote that it was time to start celebrating what he regarded as the Wehrmacht's \"heroic\" last stand on the Eastern Front.[128] Hillgruber asserted that the Wehrmacht was fighting in 1944-45 \"for a centuries-old area of German settlement, for the home of millions of Germans who lived in a core of the German Reich - namely in eastern Prussia, in the provinces of East Prussia, West Prussia, Silesia, East Brandenburg and Pomerania\".[122] Hillgruber claimed during the war that there were four versions of what Central Europe should look after the war. These were:\n\nHitler's vision of a greater Germany ruling over all of Europe from the English Channel to the Urals with all of the European Jewish population exterminated and 30 million Slavs expelled from Eastern Europe to make way for German colonization.[122]\n\nThe conservative German vision associated with the July 20 plotters, who envisioned the destruction of the Versailles system and a greater Germany ruling over all of Central and Eastern Europe.[122]\n\nThe Anglo-American vision which called for a greater Poland up to the Oder-Neisse Line at Germany's expense, and an alliance of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Austria to keep the peace.[122]\n\nAnd finally Stalin's vision which envisioned for the Soviet Union to expand at the expense of its neighbours and the establishment of Communist regimes in all of the countries of Eastern Europe.[122]\n\nHillgruber claimed that Roosevelt and even more so, Churchill blinded by their hatred of everything German failed to see that their vision was flawed as it called for the dismemberment of Germany,the only power capable of keeping the Soviet Union out of Central Europe and thus tragically allowed Stalin's vision to prevail.[122]\n\nHillgruber ended his essay \"Der Zusammenbruch im Osten 1944/45\" with a call for a history that would take account of what Hillgruber considered the decisive events on the Eastern Front. Hillgruber wrote that:\n\n\"The mighty happenings between the autumn of 1944 and the spring of 1945 still demand a description and treatment which keeps in view the events on the world historical stage, and yet illustrates the sufferings, deeds, ambitions and failings of men as individuals. This must be one of the most difficult tasks which lie before historians. With stupendous effort historians have researched the decline of the democratic Republic, the rise of the National Socialist movement and its Führer, and the foundation of the Third Reich and its structures. Perhaps the last great demand on this historiography will be to form a comprehensive picture of the collapse of the battle fronts, the conquest of eastern Central Europe, and the shattering of the Third Reich and the fall of the Germanic East, together with all the things that these developments mean\".[129]\n\nThe British military historian Christopher Duffy was to write in the preface to his 1991 book Red Storm on the Reich that his book was meant to answer the call for the sort of history that Hillgruber wanted to see written about the final days of the Eastern Front.[129] Hillgruber praised those German generals who had stayed loyal to Hitler during the 20 July plot as making the right moral decision.[130] Hillgruber called the leaders of the putsch attempt of 20 July 1944 Gesinnungsethiker (sentimental moralists) and those who stayed loyal to Hitler Veranthworthungsethiker (responsible moralists).[84] Hillgruber argued that if Hitler had been killed, the Eastern Front would have collapsed faster than it did, thereby endangering the lives of millions of German civilians, and he therefore condemned the July plot as irresponsible.[84] John Lukacs commented that what Hillgruber appeared to be saying here was that, in light of the Soviet threat in 1944, the right and moral thing for a German to do was to rally around the Führer.[84] In addition, Hillgruber claimed falsely that Himmler had ordered the death camps to cease operating in September 1944, and argued that after January 1945 all the death camps were in Soviet hands anyhow.[131] Thus, in Hillgruber's opinion, the only moral question in 1945 was whether the German Army could hold out long enough to allow as many German civilians as possible to escape westwards.[131] In his essay, Hillgruber raised the \"problem of identification\" for the historian when writing about the last days of World War II.[119] Hillgruber wrote that, as a German historian, he could not \"identify\" with those in the German death and concentration camps, for whom the defeat of Germany meant liberation.[132] Hilgruber wrote that, although the term \"liberation\" was \"completely justified for the victims of the National Socialist regime freed from the concentration camps and gaols\", it was \"inappropriate\" as concerns \"the fate of the German nation\".[133] Hillgruber wrote that the Allies, especially the Red Army, came as conquerors, not liberators, to Germany, and that no German could \"identify\" with them.[133] Hillgruber wrote:\n\n\"If the historian gazes on the winter catastrophe of 1944-45, only one position is possible...he must identify himself with the concrete fate of the German population in the East and with the desperate and sacrificial exertions of the German Army of the East and the German Baltic navy, which sought to defend the population from the orgy of revenge of the Red Army, the mass rapine, the arbitrary killing, and the compulsory deportations\".[134]\n\nThe American historian Charles S. Maier summarized Hillgruber's thesis in \"Der Zusammenbruch im Osten 1944/45\" as:\n\n\"Evoking the Wehrmacht's terrible mission in the winter of 1945, Hillgruber has written, is among the most difficult challenges a historian can face. He refers to the hallowing winter flight before the Russians. Hitler had given orders for impossible defenses of fortress cities; Soviet troops had arrived with apparent license to rape and assault. Millions of German civilians and soldiers waited for occasional trains in bombed out stations, caravanned through the Prussian forests, or precariously sailed through the Baltic to Jutland, often harassed by their own fanatic Nazi officials\"[135]\n\nHillgruber saw the expulsion of the Germans as the culmiation of a half century of horror. Hillgruber wrote:\n\n\"The mass expulsion of the Germans from a quarter of the territory of the 1937 Reich was a provisional end station on the journey that had began with the spread of the idea of a rationalization of territory according to national allegiance and that had led to the nationality struggles on the European periphery during the First World War. These struggles were followed by the first genocide - that of the Armenians in Turkey - and the mass expulsions of Greeks from Asia Minor. The extermination and resettlement practices of Hitler and Stalin in their respective \"spheres of influence\" in the period of their partnership in 1939-41 had continued such \"exchanges of populations\", and mass murder had reached an extreme degree in Hitler's \"Eastern War\" from June 1941 onward; first the Jews in Poland and in the entire East were to be exterminated, then those in the whole of German-occupied Continental Europe. The idea of mass resettlement in East-Central Europe won ever more support - first in Great Britain and then in the United States, in a complete departure from their humanitarian traditions - as victory became more certain and as the aim of the destruction of Prussia as the allegedly permanent hard core of the German Reich became more and more clearly an actual war aim\".[123]\n\nOf the two essays in Zweierlei Untergang, one was a well-regarded summary (at least by those who take an Intentionalist position such as John Lukacs) of the history of the Holocaust.[128] In his essay about the Holocaust, Hillgruber admitted there had been much anti-Semitism in the Second Reich, but argued that anti-Semitism was more much prevalent and worse in France, Russia and Austria-Hungary before 1914.[136] Hillgruber believed that, with the appearance of the government sponsored and avowedly anti-Semitic Fatherland Party led by Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz in 1917, anti-Semitism become for the first time sanctioned by the German state.[137] Hillgruber argued that, due to Austrian and Russian influences, anti-Semitism become more common in the Weimar Republic than it had been during the Kaiserreich.[137] Finally, Hillgruber ended his essay by claiming that the Holocaust was Hitler's personal pet project and nobody else's, and that without him there would have been no Holocaust.[138] The other essay concerned the ending of the \"Germanic East\".\n\nOther historians react, and Hillgruber's defence[]\n\nWith his favorable description of Wehrmacht activities, Hillgruber drew the anger of the philosopher Jürgen Habermas who rebuked Hillgruber in a feuilleton (opinion piece) entitled “A Kind of Settlement of Damages” published on 11 July 1986 in Die Zeit. Habermas attacked Hillgruber for allegedly praising the \"tested senior officials\" in the Nazi Party in the East in Zweierlei Untergang.[139] In fact, Hillgruber had written no such sentence. What Hillgruber had written was a lengthy sentence in which he had commented that different officials of the Nazi Party in eastern Germany evacuated the German public with varying degrees of success.[139] What Habermas had done was to edit Hillgruber's sentence selectively and remove the customary ellipsis that indicate that something is being left out of the quote to produce the sentence about the Nazi Party's \"tested senior officials\".[140] Hillgruber was enraged at what he considered to be a fabricated quote being attributed to him, which he called a \"scandal\".[141] Many, such as the British historian Richard J. Evans (who was otherwise highly critical of Hillgruber's historical work), felt that this was an intellectually disreputable method of attacking Hillgruber.[91] In addition, Habermas claimed in a sentence where Hillgruber wrote that Hitler believed that only through the genocide of the Jews “could” Germany become the world’s greatest power that Hillgruber’s use of the word “could” might have indicated that he shared Hitler’s perspective.[142]\n\nIt was Habermas's attack in Die Zeit in July 1986 that first drew attention to Zweierlei Untergang, which had until then been an obscure book published in the spring of 1986 by the Siedler press of Berlin.[135] Habermas wrote in his essay first published in Die Zeit newspaper on 11 July 1986 that the work of Hillgruber in glorifying the last days of the German Army on the Eastern Front was, together with the work of Michael Stürmer and Ernst Nolte, intended to serve as a \"...kind of NATO philosophy colored with German nationalism\".[143] Habermas argued that Hillgruber's claims that Allied plans for the borders of a post-war Germany were due to anti-German prejudices and a \"cliché-image of Prussia\" was absurd, and that \"it does not occur to Hillgruber that the structure of power in the Reich could actually have had something to do, as the Allies had assumed, with the social structure especially well-preserved in Prussia\".[144] Writing of Hillgruber's intentionist theories about the Holocaust, Habermas claimed that Hillgruber wrote in such a way as to imply that even top Nazis were opposed to the Shoah, and were only reluctantly forced to participate in the \"Final Solution\" by Hitler.[145] Apart from philosopher Habermas, numerous historians took issue with Hillgruber's essay, including Hans Mommsen, Eberhard Jäckel, Heinrich August Winkler, Martin Broszat, Hans-Ulrich Wehler, Karl Dietrich Bracher, and Wolfgang Mommsen.[146]\n\nCriticism centered around a number of areas. The following points were raised against Hillgruber:\n\nThose historians who take a functionalist line on the origins of the Shoah like Richard J. Evans felt that Hillgruber attributed too much responsibility for the Shoah to Hitler.[147] Evans went on to write that Hillgruber had down-played both the level and the virulence of anti-Semitism in pre-1914 Germany, writing that Wilhelm II and his Court were a center of a vicious anti-Semitism that Hitler could have easily approved of.[138]\n\nHillgruber largely ignored the fact that the reason why Soviet troops were in Germany in 1945 was because Germany had attacked the Soviet Union in 1941.[148]\n\nHillgruber mostly ignored the fact that the same troops fighting to save German civilians from the Soviets were also allowing the Nazis to continue the Holocaust.[149] The Israeli historian Omer Bartov commented that it was simply disgusting on the part of Hillgruber to call upon historians to \"identify\" with German troops fighting to extend the Holocaust.[150] Furthermore, it was noted that Hillgruber's call for \"empathy\" for the German troops fighting on the Eastern Front implicitly devalued the lives of those held in the German death camps or forced to walk in the death marches. Critics of Hillgruber such as Bartov noted that his call for historians to have \"empathy\" with German soldiers placed a higher value on the lives of German civilians protected by the Wehrmacht then on those dying in the Holocaust.[151] In another essay, Bartov commented that Hillgruber appeared to imply that the British government’s decision to repudiate the Munich Agreement in 1942 was the basis of the decision to expel the Germans after the war.[152] Bartov commented that Hillgruber appeared not to care that the German aggression against the states of Eastern Europe such as the destruction of Czecho-Slovakia in March 1939, which itself negated the Munich Agreement might had something to do with the British abrogatation of the Munich Agreement, and that there is no direct link between the repudiation of Munich in 1942 and the expulsion of the Germans from Czechoslovakia after the war.[152]\n\nThat the expulsion of Germans from Eastern Europe (which today might come under the rubric of \"ethnic cleansing\") cannot be equated with the racially-based extermination of European Jewry.[153]\n\nThe sufferings of Germans were presented in isolation, with little reference to the sufferings of Jews, Poles, Russians, Czechs, etc. The impression given is that Germans were the primary victims of the war.[154]\n\nThat Hillgruber asked his readers to sympathize with the officers and men of the German Wehrmacht and Kriegsmarine who fought to protect and evacuate the German population is morally indefensible/[155]\n\nThe sub-title of Hillgruber's book drew controversy with the Swiss historian Micha Brumlik in an essay entitled \"New Myth of State\" first published in Die Tagezeitung newspaper on 12 July 1986, commenting that the use of the word Zerschlagung (destruction) for the Germans indicated that an act of extreme violence was committed against the Germans while the Jews were assigned only the neutral term Ende (end) to describe the Holocaust.[156] Brumlik argued that in his view, Hillgruber by his use of the word \"End\" to label the Holocaust implied that the Shoah was just something terrible that happened to the Jews of Europe, but it was not anybody's fault.[156] Brumlik accused Hillgruber of reducing German history down to the level of Landserheft (a type of comics in Germany glorifying war).[157] Brumlik argued that Hillgruber's thesis about the Holocaust as one of many genocides, instead of a unique event, was a form of \"psychological repression\".[158] The American historian Gordon A. Craig expressed the view that Hillgruber's choice of the word Ende for the Holocaust suggested that the Holocaust was \"something that just sort of happened\".[159]\n\nThe right-wing German historian Klaus Hildebrand defended Hillgruber in an essay first published in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper on 31 July 1986, by attacking Habermas over the \"tried and true higher-ups of the NSDAP\" line created by Habermas, which Hildebrand considered a highly dishonest method of attack.[160] Hildebrand argued that Hillgruber was merely trying to show the \"tragedy\" of the Eastern Front, and was not engaging in moral equivalence between the German and Soviet sides.[161] Responding to the defence of Hillgruber by his close associate Hildebrand in his essay \"The Age of the Tyrants\", Habermas argued in a letter to the editor of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on 11 August 1986 that Hillgruber's approach of \"identifying\" with German soldiers fighting on the Eastern Front \"...would perhaps be a legitimate point of view for the memoirs of a veteran - but not for a historian writing from the distance of four decades\".[162] Habermas went to warn of the \"apologetic effect\" of the sub-title of Hillgruber's book.[162] Habermas stated that:\n\n\"A German reader would have to bring along a healthy portion of linguistic insensitivity in order not to let himself be influenced by the juxtaposition of an aggressive 'destruction of the German Reich' by its external enemies and an almost automatic following 'end of European Jewry'. This first impression justifes itself above all through the compilation of two parts so unlike in their style of presentation and declared partisanship\".[162]\n\nJoachim Fest defended Hillgruber in an essay entitled \"Encumbered Remembrance\", first published in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on 16 August 1986, by arguing that Habermas himself was guilty of euphemistic language such as labelling dekulakization as \"the expulsion of the kulaks\".[163] The philosopher Helmut Fleischer, in an essay first published in the Nürnberger Zeitung newspaper on 20 September 1986, asserted that there was nothing morally objectionable in Hillgruber's argument for the morality of historians siding with German troops on the Eastern Front.[164] The left-wing German historian Hans Mommsen in an essay first published for Blatter fur deutsche und internationale Politik magazine in October 1986 wrote of Hillgruber that:\n\n\"His [Hillgruber's] historiographic association of resettlement and the Holocaust indirectly supports the plan, so aggressively posited by Stürmer, of relativizing the crimes of the Third Reich. It allows for revisionist misunderstandings by its demand for \"a reconstruction of the destroyed European Middle\".[165]\n\nMartin Broszat, in an essay first published in Die Zeit on 3 October 1986, wrote that Hillgruber had come very close to being a Nazi apologist, and his book Zweierlei Untergang was simply not very good.[166]\n\nThe German publisher Rudolf Augstein, in an essay entitled \"The New Auschwitz Lie\" first published in Der Spiegel magazine on 6 October 1986, called Hillgruber \"a constitutional Nazi\".[167] Augstein went on to call for Hillgruber to be fired from his post at the University of Cologne for being a \"constitutional Nazi\", and argued that there was no moral difference between Hillgruber and Hans Globke.[167] The classicist Christian Meier, who was president of the German Historical Association at the time, in a speech given on 8 October 1986 called the allegations that Hillgruber was a Nazi apologist \"nonsensical\", but argued that Hillgruber was guilty of \"methodological dubiousness\" in Zweierlei Untergang.[168]\n\nThe German historian Imanuel Geiss wrote in defence of Hillgruber that Augstein's calling him a \"constitutional Nazi\" was way over the top; that together with Habermas, Augstein was guilty of slandering Hillgruber; that Hillgruber's views deserved consideration; and that Hillgruber was no Nazi apologist.[169] The German historian Hagen Schulze wrote in defense of Hillgruber:\n\n\"For the discipline of history, singularity and comparability of historical events are thus not mutually exclusive alternatives. They are complementary concepts. A claim that historians such as Ernst Nolte or Andreas Hillgruber deny the uniqueness of Auschwitz because they are looking for comparisons stems from incorrect presuppositions. Of course, Nolte and Hillgruber can be refuted if their comparisons rests on empirically or logically false assumptions. But Habermas never provided such proof\".[170]\n\nHillgruber defended his call for the identification with the German troops fighting on the Eastern Front in an interview with the Rheinischer Merkur newspaper on 31 October 1986, on the ground that he was only trying \"…to experience things from the perspective of the main body of the population\".[171] In the same 1986 interview, Hillgruber said it was necessary for a more nationalistic version of German history to be written because the East German government was embarking upon a more nationalist history, and if West German historians did not keep up with their East German counterparts in terms of German nationalism, it was inevitable that Germans would come to see the East German regime as the legitimate German state.[172] Hillgruber was most furious with Augstein's \"constitutional Nazi\" line, and stated that he was considering suing Augstein for libel.[173] Repying to the interviewer's question about whether he thought the Holocaust was unique, Hillgruber stated:\n\n\"...that the mass murder of the kulaks in the early 1930s, the mass murder of the leadership cadre of the Red Army in 1937-38, and the mass murder of the Polish officers who in September 1939 fell into Soviet hands are not qualitatively different in evaluation from the mass murder in the Third Reich\".[117]\n\nIn response to the interviewer's question about whatever he was a \"revisionist\" (by which the interviewer clearly meant negationist), Hillgruber stated that:\n\n\"Revision of the results of scholarship is, as I said, in itself the most natural thing in the world. The discipline of history lives, like every discipline, on the revision through research of previous conceptualizations...Here I would like to say that in principle since the mid-1960s substantial revisions of various kinds have taken place and have rendered absurd the clichéd \"image\" that Habermas as a nonhistorian obviously possesses\".[174]\n\nRepying to the interviewer's question about whether he wanted to see the revival of the original concept of the Sonderweg, that is of the idea of Germany as a great Central European power equally opposed to both the West and the East, Hillgruber denied that German history since 1945 had been that \"golden\", and claimed that his conception of the Central European identity he wanted to see revived was cultural, not political.[87] Hillgruber called the idea of Germany as great power that would take on and being equally opposed to the United States and the Soviet Union as:\n\n\"...historically hopeless because of the way the Second World War ended. To want to develop such a projection now would mean to bring the powers in the East and the West together against the Germans. I cannot imagine that anyone is earnestly striving for that. Reminiscences of good cooperation between the Germans and Slavic peoples in the middle of Europe before the First World War, and in part also still between the wars, are awakened whenever journalists or historians travel to Poland, Czechoslovakia, or Hungary. In that atmosphere it seems imperative to express how closely one feels connected to representatives of these nations. This is understandable, but it cannot all merge into a notion of \"Central Europe\" that could be misunderstood as taking up the old concept again, which is, as I have said, no longer realizable. In a word, I think the effort to latch on to the connections torn apart in 1945, because of the outcome of the war, and then in turn because of the Cold War, is a sensible political task, especially for West Germans\".[87]\n\nIn another essay first published in the Die Zeit newspaper on 7 November 1986, Habermas wrote that: \"This longing for the unframed memories from the perspective of the veterans can now be satisfied by reading Andreas Hillgruber's presentation of the events on the Eastern Front in 1944-45. The 'problem of identification', something that is unusual for an historian, poses itself to the author only because he wants to incorporate the perspective of the fighting troops and the affected civilian population\".[175] In a newspaper 'feuilleton' entitled \"Not a Concluding Remark\", first published in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on 20 November 1986, Meier wrote that:\n\n\"What moved Hillgruber to \"identify\" with the defenders of the front in East Prussia will probably have to remain a mystery…But however that my be, and whatever other weaknesses his book contains, it cannot be accused of trivializing National Socialism. In this respect, Habermas's concerns are certainly without foundation\".[176]\n\nThe political scientist Kurt Sontheimer, in an essay entitled \"Makeup Artists Are Creating a New Identity\" first published in Rheinischer Merkur newspaper on 21 November 1986, accused Hillgruber of being guilty of \"revisionism\" (by which Sontheimer clearly meant negationism) in his writings on German history.[177] In another essay entitled \"He Who Wants to Escape the Abyss\" first published in Die Welt newspaper on 22 November 1986, Hildebrand accused Habermas of engaging in \"scandalous\" attacks on Hillgruber.[178] Hildebrand claimed that \"Habermas's criticism is based in no small part on quotations that unambiguously falsify the matter\".[178] Responding to Meier's comment about what why he chose to \"identify\" with German troops in a letter to the editor of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on 29 November 1986, Hillgruber wrote:\n\n\"Is it really so difficult for a German historian (even if he is, like Meier, a specialist in ancient history) to realize why the author of an essay about the collapse in the East in 1944-45 identifies with the efforts of the German populace? I identified with the German efforts not only in East Prussia, but also in Silesia, East Brandenburg and Pomerania (Meier's homeland) to protect themselves from what threatened them and to save as many people as possible\".[179]\n\nThe German historian Wolfgang Mommsen, in an essay entitled \"Neither Denial nor Forgetfulness Will Free Us\" first published in Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper on 1 December 1986, wrote about Hillgruber's demands that historians identified with the \"justified\" German defence of the Eastern Front that:\n\n\"Andreas Hillgruber recently attempted to accord a relative historical justification to the Wehrmacht campaign in the East and the desperate resistance of the army in the East after the summer of 1944. He argued that the goal was to prevent the German civilian population from falling into the hands of the Red Army. However, the chief reason, he argued, was that the defense of German cities in the East had become tantamount to defending Western civilization. In light of the Allied war goals, which, independent of Stalin's final plans, envisioned breaking up Prussia and destroying the defensive position of a strong, Prussian-led Central European state that could serve as a bulwark against Bolshevism, the continuation of the war in the East was justified from the viewpoint of those involved. It was, as Hillgruber's argument would have it, also justified even from today's standpoint, despite the fact that prolonging the war in the East meant that the gigantic murder machinery of the Holocaust would be allowed to continue to run. All this, the essay argued, was justified as long as the fronts held. Hillgruber's essay is extremely problematic when viewed from the perspective of a democratically constituted community that orients itself towards Western moral and political standards.\n\nThere is no getting around the bitter truth that the defeat of National Socialist Germany was not only in the interest of the peoples who were bulldozed by Hitler's war and of the peoples who were selected by his henchmen for annihilation or oppression or exploitation - it was also in the interest of the Germans. Accordingly, parts of the gigantic scenery of the Second World War were, at least as far as we were concerned, totally senseless, even self-destructive. We cannot escape this bitter truth by assigning partial responsibility to other partners who took part in the war\".[180]\n\nIn an essay published in the 1 December 1986 edition of the New Republic entitled \"Immoral Equivalence\", the American historian Charles S. Maier criticized Hillgruber for engaging in \"vulgar Historismus\" in Zweierlei Untergang.[181] Maier wrote the historian is supposed to examine all sides of historical occurrences, and not serve as the advocate of one side.[181] Maier wrote:\n\n\"Hillgruber goes on to claim, moreover, that Stalin, Roosevelt, and above all Churchill had long harbored designs to dismember Germany. It does not seem relevant to Hillgruber's way of thinking that German aggression might indeed have led the Allies to contemplate partition; in any case the notion was rejected in theory, and partition came about only as a result of circumstances when the war ended. Hillgruber's historical contribution to \"winning the future\" thus amounts to the old Prusso-German lament, dusted off and refurbished, that the Machiavellian British were always conspiring to encircle the Reich. Predictably enough, the essay closes with a lament that after 1945, Prussia and Germany would not longer be able to fulfill their mediating role between East and West. But precisely what sort of \"mediating role\" had brought all those German soldiers to Stalingrad in the first place?[181] \"\n\nMaier noted that in marked contrast to the way Hillgruber highlighted the suffering of German civilians on the Eastern Front in dramatic and emotionally charged language in the first essay, in the second essay:\n\n\"...that Hillgruber's second and (brief) chapter on the extermination of the Jews might seem pallid after the emotional exercise in \"identification\" that precedes it. No depiction of sealed freight cars, purposeful starvation, degradation, and the final herding to the gas chambers parallels Hillgruber's vivid evocation of the East Prussian collapse. Not that Hillgruber minimizes the crimes of the SS (through he ignores the massacres of Red Army prisoners by his heroic Wehrmacht)\".[181]\n\nMaier called Zweierlei Untergang not an \"evil book\", but one that was \"...badly balanced; and its particular imbalance opens the way to apologia\".[181] Finally, Maier rejected Hillgruber's claim of moral equivalence between the actions of the Soviet Communists and German Nazis on the grounds that while the former were extremely brutal, the latter sought the total extermination of a people, namely the Jews.[182] The German historian Horst Möller defended Hillgruber in an essay first published in late 1986 in the Beiträge zur Konfliktforschung magazine by arguing that:\n\n\"Hillgruber comes to the conclusion, on the basis of British files that have come to light in the meantime, that the destruction of the German Reich was planned before the mass murder of the Jews became known - and that the mass murder does not explain the end of the Reich…It is hardly disputable that the attempt to hold the Eastern Front as long as possible against the Red Army meant protection for the German civilian populace in the eastern provinces against murders, rapes, plundering and expulsions by Soviet troops. It was not simply Nazi propaganda against these \"Asiatic hordes\" that caused this climate of fear. It was the concrete examples of Nemmersdorf in October 1944, mentioned by Hillgruber, that had brought the horror of the future occupation into view\".[183]\n\nThe journalist Joachim Perels, in an essay first published in the Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper on 27 December 1986, thought it was outrageous for Hillgruber to praise those German officers who stayed loyal to Hitler during the July 20th putsch as making the right moral choice, and felt that Hillgruber had slandered those Germans who chose to resist the Nazi regime as traitors who left down their country in its hour of need.[184]\n\nIn an essay meant to reply to Habermas's criticism entitled \"Jürgen Habermas, Karl-Heinz Janßen, and the Enlightenment in the Year 1986\" first published in the right-wing Geschichte in Wissenschaft und Unterricht (History In Academics and Instruction) magazine in December 1986, Hillgruber accused Habermas of engaging in \"scandalous\" methods of attack.[141] In answer to Habermas's criticism of the sub-title of his book, Hillgruber argued that the title of his Holocaust essay, \"Der geschichtliche Ort der Judenvernichtung\" (The Historical Locus Of The Annihilation Of The Jews) and the first sentence of his book, in which he spoke of the \"murder of the Jews in the territory controlled by National Socialist Germany\", disproved Habermas's point.[185] In particular, Hillgruber was highly furious over the sentence about \"tried and true higher-ups of the NSDAP\" that Habermas had created by selective editing of Hillgruber's book.[186] Hillgruber claimed that Habermas was waging a \"campaign of character assassination against Michael Stürmer, Ernst Nolte, Klaus Hildebrand and me in the style of the all-too-familiar APO pamphets of the late 1960s\" [Hillgruber was attempting to associate Habermas with the APO here].[187] Hillgruber described Habermas as a kind of left-wing literary hit-man who had asked to \"take apart\" Zweierlei Untergang by Karl-Heinz Janßen, the editor of the culture section of the Die Zeit newspaper.[188]\n\nReacting to Habermas's criticism that in the Holocaust essay in Zweierlei Untergang that his use of the word \"could\" in a sentence where Hillgruber wrote that Hitler believed only through genocide of the Jews could Germany become a great power, which Habermas claimed might have indicated that Hillgruber shared Hitler's viewpoint, Hillgruber took much umbrage to Habermas's claim. Hillgruber stated that what he wrote in his Holocaust essay was that the German leadership in 1939 was divided into three factions. One, centred on the Nazi Party and the SS, saw the war as a chance to carry out the \"racial reorganization\" of Europe via mass expulsions and German colonization, whose roots Hillgruber traced to the war aims of the Pan-German League in the First World War.[189] Another faction comprised the traditional German elites in the military, the diplomatic service and the bureaucracy, who saw the war as a chance to destroy the settlement established by the Treaty of Versailles and to establish the world dominance that Germany had sought in the First World War.[189] And finally, there was Hitler's \"race\" program, which sought the genocide of the Jews as the only way to ensure that Germany would be a world power.[189] Hillgruber insisted that he was only describing Hitler's beliefs, and did not share them.[189] Hillgruber argued that only by reading his second essay about the Holocaust in Zweierlei Untergang could one understand the first essay about the \"collapse\" on the Eastern Front.[189] Hillgruber compared the feelings of Germans about the lost eastern territories to the feelings of the French about their lost colonies in Indochina.[189] Hillgruber claimed that, when writing about the end of the \"German East\" in 1945, to understand the \"sense of tragedy\" that surrounded the matter one had to take the side of the German civilians who were menaced by the Red Army, and the German soldiers fighting to protect them.[190] Hillgruber went on to write that Habermas was seeking to censor him by criticizing him for taking the German side when discussing the last days of the Eastern Front.[191] Replying to Habermas's charge that he was a \"neo-conservative\", Hillgruber wrote:\n\n\"How does he come to come categorize my work as having so-called neoconservative tendencies? For decades I have never made any bones about my basic conservative position. Deeply suspicious as I am of all \"leftist\" and other world-improving utopias, I will gladly let the label \"conservative\" a"
