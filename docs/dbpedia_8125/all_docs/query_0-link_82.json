        "meta_description": "Listen to this episode from Reimagining Atlantis on Spotify. This week, I wanted to expand on Pythagoras and how his work influenced Plato. In order to understand what Plato meant we have to dig deep into his psychology. Plato was well influenced by Pythagoras well into his earlier works, way before he wrote about Atlantis. Both Plato and Pythagorus had a vision of a perfect society. Now, let's take a moment to assign numbers to those notes. We do this every day with computers. Can we say “auto tune”? If a sound could be mathematically orchestrated, what sound would a computer make? Could we mathematically calculate a human? Could I mathematically predict my future child based on gene expression and sound alone? Could a god be a number?  All of these questions and more were pondered 3000 years ago. Pythagorus and Plato spent most of their professional years pondering those questions. It was Pythagoras who popularized the idea of a human having a soul and reincarnation. Could our next lives be mathematically deduced?  https://science.jrank.org/pages/9578/Harmony-Plato-s-Harmonic-Cosmology.html https://urbeginnerwitch.medium.com/pythagoras-and-numerology-2ccf6d508a54  ---   Support this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/mary-torrey4/support",
