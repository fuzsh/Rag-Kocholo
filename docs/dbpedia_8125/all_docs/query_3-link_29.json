        "text": "Many narratives, whether or not it is noticeable, share similarities. This can be due to various reasons, such as the authors decision of genre, the intended audience, as well as many other factors. The novel “Indian Horse” by Richard Wagamese and the short story “Perspective” by Taren Orchard have many things in common. One big similarity between both stories is that they are centered around young First Nations boys that have experienced hardships through life. Some other connections are how both narratives have someone who is under the exposure to alcohol abuse due to stress.\n\nThe creations of Pythagoras were very powerful during the era in which he lived in. He created a community of followers (known as the Pythagoreans) who believed that mathematics was fundamental and ‘at the heart of reality’ (source 1). The people in the society were all proficient mathematicians took mathematics very seriously, to the extent that it was similar to a religion (source 1).\n\nHipparchus was a greek astronomer, geographer, and mathematician born 190 B.C. in Nicaea and died in 120 B.C. Rhodes, Rhodes, Greece. Hipparchus is accredited as the inventor of trigonometry because of his discovery of the first table of chords and also because he's the only person with valid data of the discovery and usage of trigonometry. In order to calculate the rising and setting of zodiacal signs, Hipparchus brought to light the division of circles into 360 degrees and the calculation of chords by looking at the triangles (spherical triangles or triangles that made up a circle) differently. Hipparchus experimented putting all triangles to be within a circle and with the three points each touching the\n\nThroughout the paper I’ll be describing the story of the Odysseus and his Epic Journey, as well as Gilgamesh Journey. I will show you how these two epic stories relate to one another. By comparing and contrasting the two stories, I will compare how Odysseus and Gilgamesh relate to the gods and have a good communication with them, as well how both of them are epic warriors and last the pain they both received in there epic journey. I will show examples of Odysseus communicating with the gods, and how Gilgamesh communicated with his mom the god. Also I will show the example that they are both great warriors by explaining how Odysseus beat the Trojan and killed Poseidon son just as Gilgamesh fought a war and build the wall. Both of these examples reflect the great warriors they were. Last I will show the pain Odysseus and Gilgamesh encountered in there soul by doing there epic journeys.\n\nAs people age, they begin to wonder what is the meaning of life, particularly their own life. It is a natural curiosity and has been thought about for several centuries. Philosophers claim to know, or at least be fairly aware of, what the meaning of life is. Three that come to mind are Rene Descartes, Epictetus, and Plato; these three philosophers have lived through different time periods and differ greatly in theories. Descartes had no true theory but used skepticism to establish his philosophy, Epictetus was a Stoic, and Plato was a Platonist. One, Descartes, lived questioning anything and everything to only be sure of two existences, another, Epictetus, lived perhaps too happily since he believed that everything that occurred in life was a part of God’s plan, but one lived in the middle of these two philosophers. This philosopher was Plato, he was not too skeptical of life nor was he too engulfed in “God’s plan,” instead he was rational about life and searched for the deeper meaning to his own being. For this reason, his theories are far more well thought-out and reasonable than those of Descartes and Epictetus.\n\nPythagoras made influential contributions to philosophy and religion in the late 6th century BC. He is often revered as a great mathematician and scientist and is best known for the Pythagorean theorem which relates the two sides of a triangle to the hypotenuse using the formula a squared plus b squared equals c squared. However, because legend and obfuscation cloud his work even more than that of other pre-Socratic philosophers, one can give only a tentative account of his teachings, and some have questioned whether he contributed much to mathematics or natural philosophy. Many of the accomplishments credited to Pythagoras may actually have been accomplishments of his colleagues and successors. Some accounts mention that the philosophy associated with Pythagoras was related to mathematics and that numbers were\n\nIn ancient Greece two great written philosophers lived. First there was Plato and then Aristotle. Aristotle was a pupil of Plato. Despite being taught by Plato they had different theories and views. Their ethics were very typical and traditional of ancient Greece but Aristotle detailed virtue ethics and the path to happiness. Plato’s political theories for a utopian society varied from Aristotle’s view of ‘best state for each society’. Their metaphysical theories are complete opposites and very contradicting. Even though Plato and Aristotle came from the same era and were closely linked they had very different philosophies.\n\nThe Greeks made several inventions, most notably in the subject of math, which are still studied today and taught in school. Mathematician Euclid is often credited as the “Father of Geometry” for all his work and studies in this subject, which are compiled in his books called The Elements. He organized known geometrical statements called theorems and logically proved all of them. He proved the theorem of Pythagoras (another Greek mathematician), which stated that the equation (c2 = a2 + b2) is true for every right triangle.\n\nEmpedocles was a pre-Socratic philosopher who lived from 490 to 430 BC in Acragas, Sicily, Italy. His writings mainly focus on the study of cosmetology, religion, and nature; and have influenced some of today’s modern theories in science. Although he was a colorful character who claimed to be able to bring back the dead, he maintained a democratic political standpoint and was known for being generous and fought for equality of the people. Empedocles was a poet, philosopher, and physician.\n\nIn Famous scientist’s (2015) article Pythagoras it states that five 3D solids were brought into existence by Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans, these items are identical on all of the sides and today they are called dice. The ranged from four sides all the way up to twenty and later Plato believed they belonged to the five Greek elements including aether (n.pag). They said “Pythagoras believed that, like everything else, music was based on whole number ratios. He also believed in its healing properties.”(n.pag) He later would learn that music was controlled by rations, like if a sting is shortened by half it raises an octave or if it’s shortened two-thirds then it moved the pit up one-fifth discovering that octaves are split into fifths not halves (n.pag). Those are the biggest discoveries of Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans, but they still has many more different discoveries. He has been accredited with a lot for being an enigma, and having written no books in his life. Even so the thoughts from learning of this brilliant mathematician tickles the mind and creates great and wonderful thoughts and ideas for many people. Learning about all of this should inspire anyone to travel and learn the ways of other countries and customs and even grasp their mathematical\n\nIn around 569 B.C on a small island of Samos, Pythagoras was born. His mother, named Pythais, was a native to the island Samos and his father, named Mnesarchus, was a traveling merchant. Due to his father being a traveling merchant, Pythagoras spent his most of his childhood traveling with his father, thus causing young Pythagoras to become more intelligent and worldly compared to other youth at the time. Along the travels he picked up reading and reciting poems created by Greek Poet, Homer. Though there were two\n\nHypatia’s most well-known improvements to science and astronomy include her re-inventing of the hydrometer and charting of the stars. In mathematics, she is most notable for her contributions to working on different conic sections.Simply by dividing cones in different ways on a plane, she was able to develop the idea of different graphs and shapes such as parabolas, ellipses, and hyperbolas. Her understanding of the conic sections lead her to be one of the key contributors to the invention of the astrolabe as well (Morrow 1998). Christianity became extremely popular in Alexandria during the time when Hypatia lived there along with many riots breaking out. She was a pagan and known for defending science against any form of religion. She was mercilessly killed by an angry mob who accused her of religious turmoil. Although she died a horrible death of being stripped of her skin and limbs, her legacy lived and still lives. Mathematics was thriving in Athens, so that is where her students eagerly fled to. Although, many of her works that were stored in the library of Alexandria were destroyed by an Arab invasion. Hypatia is an important symbol for many generations and will always be considered to be the first woman in mathematics.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Euclid of Alexandria was born in about 325 BC. He is the most prominent mathematician of antiquity best known for his dissertation on mathematics. He was able to create “The Elements” which included the composition of many other famous mathematicians together. He began exploring math because he felt that he needed to compile certain things and fix certain postulates and theorems. His book included, many of Eudoxus’ theorems, he perfected many of Theaetetus's theorems also. Much of Euclid’s background is very vague and unknown. It is unreliable to say whether some things about him are true, there are two types of extra information stated that scientists do not know\n\nEuclid Of Alexandria may be the best-known mathematician of the world, he is best known for his work on mathematics The Elements. The fact that his work has survived so long, 2000 years in fact, is a tribute to his mathematical genius, however very little of him is known. Three theories abound as to the true nature of this historical figure. Not all historians agree that Euclid was in fact a historical figure, some argue that the school in Alexandria took up the name Euclid to publish their works. But the more accepted theories are that Euclid was in fact a real historical figure who may have been the leader of a team of mathematicians."
