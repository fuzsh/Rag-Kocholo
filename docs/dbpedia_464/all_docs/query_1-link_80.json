        "text": "Maybe you could explain what you are trying to achieve! From your above post I wasn't able to derive that.\n\nWhat are you trying to build? Where did you download its source from?\n\nYour assumption of macOS being based on FreeBSD is misleading. Although there is some truth to it.\n\nNeXTSTEP, the operating system MacOS X was derived from, was largely based on FreeBSD 4 - FreeBSD 6(this was innacurate, see corrections further down by Tingo) BSD code, but with the BSD kernel replaced by Mach. So while FreeBSD and MacOS X share a past, and under the hood macOS still has lots of BSD code, their path has significantly diverged since. Do not consider macOS to be a FreeBSD variant. It never was. NeXT simply used large portions of BSD code to kickstart the development of their new operating system. It was a better and faster way than starting to write an OS from scratch.\n\nFreeBSD system source, or a FreeBSD application source from the ports collection should never be expected to compile under macOS. Even though one can write cross-platform C or C++ code that builds equally well on FreeBSD, macOS, Linux, and other systems.\n\nMacOS is not at all based on FreeBSD. Not at all clear what OP is trying to accomplish. Release what?\n\nS/He downloaded the holy FreeBSD sources to a MacIntrash and tried to build with the release.sh script.\n\nmintchoco, you can't do that this way, it must fail since there're far too many differences between these two systems. You can build FreeBSD on a FreeBSD system, maybe in another BSD or Linux with a careful setup of build options & tools. Best option might be to setup a hardware virtualized machine - not VBox, for shure Mac has a better (in terms of performance) solution available. Install FreeBSD into that, and then you can play around with it's build system. Install the docs: pkg install {de,en}-freebsd-doc, replace de with your native tongue. The docs are under /usr/local/share/doc/freebsd"
