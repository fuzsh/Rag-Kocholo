We can think about it as the GNU/Linux kernel is in Linux distributions.\n\nXNU is the intermediate layer between the software (like iOS/macOS) and the hardware (components of an iPhone/MacBook). It is one of the first pieces of software that is loaded into memory and one of the last when the system is turned off (https://www.iphoneitalia.com/658413/xnu-kernel-macos).\n\nThe source code of XNU is published under APSL (Apple Public Source License) v2.0. It is hosted in Apple’s own site (https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/) or as part of GitHub (https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/xnu). There are instructions on how to build the XNU kernel (https://kernelshaman.blogspot.com/2021/01/building-xnu-for-macos-big-sur-1101.html).\n\nLastly, we can summarize XNU as a hybrid kernel combining the Mach kernel developed at Carnegie Mellon University with components from FreeBSD and a C++ API for writing drivers called IOKit (https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/) — more on those in future writeups. A diagram showcasing that is shown below. By the way, in the diagram “OSFMK 7.3” is the Mach component (https://dbpedia.org/page/XNU)."
