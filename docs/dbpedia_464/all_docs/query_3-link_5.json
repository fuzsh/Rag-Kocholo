        "text": "The programming language C was written to be used to program the UNIX operating system. Just because the UNIX operating system is mostly written in C it doesn't mean you have to use C to program on UNIX.\n\nThe language the operating system is written in has nothing to do with what can be ran on the system.\n\nFor example, Java can be ran on any system that can support a JVM. In fact, the JVM code is written mostly in C so that it can be ported to almost any platform that can compile C code. This is what makes Java so powerful.\n\nHigher languages such as C and Java are meant to be ran on any platform where they are supported. This is the difference between high level and low level. Low level languages like Assembler can only be ran on a specific processor.\n\nTo sum up, the language that the operating system is written in has nothing to do with can be ran on the system. When you are targeting a specific system such as Mac OSX or Windows you can use any high level language like C, C++, Java, Python..."
