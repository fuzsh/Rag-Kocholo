        "text": "This is where XNU visionOS kernel differs from the Linux and the BSD kernels. When you make a kernel request in XNU that request is routed to one the BSD server (green) or Mach (red). In most POSIX compliant systems syscalls are unsigned integers. In XNU you can pass in a negative value which indicates the request should be routed to Mach. It’s a simple thing but it exposes the under.ting complexity and layering of the kernel. Unix is an abstraction layer over Mach. BSD is POSIX compatible and well documented. Mach doesn’t know what POSIX is and is not well documented.\n\nUnlicensed hard disk.. The server is original but the hdd is un-lineside one. The update packages (which i done it linux ..with full authority-GE Corp) - it is there for all Unix flavors...it done it legitimately via console prompt helped by Mr. Sandeep Kamboj for Unix server's...should be downloaded and merged with the un-licensed hdd..once it is done ..it will allow the patch packages to install in the server.\n\nOpenSSH 9.4p1: This is a Linux/portable port of OpenBSD's excellent OpenSSH. OpenSSH is based on the last free version of Tatu Ylonen's SSH with all patent-encumbered algorithms removed, all known security bugs fixed, new features reintroduced, and many other clean-ups.\n\n\"Simple information about Kali Linux, but very useful\" The -a option shows all files, including hidden files. Notice the files that start with a dot (.) These are hidden files. Typically these files are used to manage terminal settings, collect command history, and other shell-related settings. They are hidden to prevent users from making accidental changes to these important files and to keep the directory listing clean.\n\nOpenSSH 9.7p1: This is a Linux/portable port of OpenBSD's excellent OpenSSH. OpenSSH is based on the last free version of Tatu Ylonen's SSH with all patent-encumbered algorithms removed, all known security bugs fixed, new features reintroduced, and many other clean-ups.\n\nOpenSSH 9.8p1: This is a Linux/portable port of OpenBSD's excellent OpenSSH. OpenSSH is based on the last free version of Tatu Ylonen's SSH with all patent-encumbered algorithms removed, all known security bugs fixed, new features reintroduced, and many other clean-ups.\n\nWhen your kernel is sensitive to a software that runs on top, that’s an eye opener that probably you have’nt implemented proper application runtime isolation or that your bootstrap sequence requires a design review. Feel very sorry for businesses that were affected by this outage and that’s why I remain admiring the Unix / Linux based kernels. Although the reason given states that it’s a content update, can’t imagine why a system cannot boot because of a bad signature if at all. It shall have been “staged “ so that you fall back in a recovery mode or to previous version of the update.\n\nNot sure who is old enough to remember the Unix wars :-) I did enjoy the videos about this topic: * The Rise of Unix. The Seeds of its Fall. https://lnkd.in/eADpy9AC * A Chronicle of the Unix Wars https://lnkd.in/e67GbqYm The rise and fall of #Unix, the rise of #BSD and #Linux."
