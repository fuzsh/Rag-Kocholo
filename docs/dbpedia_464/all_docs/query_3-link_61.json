        "text": "AgileBits, the developer of the hugely popular 1Password password manager, has confirmed that a critical security vulnerability could have allowed an attacker to exfiltrate password vault items and potentially obtain account unlock keys from macOS users.\n\nWhat Is CVE-2024-42219?\n\nIn a 1Password support posting it was stated that CVE-2024-42219 could enable a ‚Äúmalicious process running locally on a machine to bypass inter-process communication protections‚Äù and allow the malicious software in question to ‚Äúexfiltrate vault items, as well as obtain derived values used to sign in to 1Password, specifically the account unlock key and SRP-ùë•.‚Äù SRP refers to the Secure Remote Password and forms just one part of the multi-layer security protecting access to 1Password vaults.\n\nWhen it comes to 1Password data encryption, passwords have an additional layer of protection by way of a 128-bit secret key that must be used in conjunction with your master password to decrypt anything. This is created using your own device and is not known to 1Password.\n\nA 1Password spokesperson gave me the following statement:\n\n‚ÄúRobinhood‚Äôs Red Team found vulnerabilities that can occur when a device is compromised by malware and a malicious actor has full control over it. When malware or a malicious user gains full control over a user‚Äôs device, there is little that can be done to guarantee its security. We have since addressed the vulnerabilities within our control, with the latest updates rolled out in the 8.10.38 client app release. We appreciate that Robinhood‚Äôs Red Team disclosed and collaborated closely with us to address these issues ahead of their presentation at DEFCON this Saturday at 2pm PT. We‚Äôre committed to transparency about security issues and keeping our customers safe and will publish more details on our blog after their presentation.‚Äù\n\nWhich 1Password Accounts Does CVE-2024-42219 Impact?\n\nThe security vulnerability was found within 1Password for macOS and targets users of all 1Password 8 for Mac versions before 8.10.36. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to specifically target 1Password for Mac users and convince them to run malicious software on their computer. An attacker could, the 1Password support posting confirmed, abuse missing macOS-specific inter-process validations in order to impersonate a 1Password browser extension.\n\nForbesSmart Guessing Algorithm Cracks 87 Million Passwords In Under 60 Seconds\n\nThe macOS XNU (macOS kernel) inter-process communication framework is system-native and used by 1Password to enforce ‚Äòhardened runtime‚Äô protections that should prevent tampering with such processes and, therefore, prevent certain types of local attacks from taking place. The Robinhood Red Team hackers found a way around this protection during an independent security assessment of 1Password for Mac.\n\nAgileBits has confirmed that, as far as it is aware, the issue has not been discovered or exploited by anyone other than the researchers themselves. 1Password has received no reports to the contrary, it said.\n\nMitigating The 1Password For Mac Security Vulnerability\n\nAll users of 1Password for macOS are advised to ensure they have updated to the latest version of password manager application as a matter of urgency. The security flaw has been patched in 1Password for Mac version 8.10.36, so users should check they have this version or later installed.\n\nThankfully, 1Password checks for such updates five minutes after the application is opened and does so every day. You should see a notification concerning an available update if the app is unlocked. If the app is locked, then it will update itself automatically."
