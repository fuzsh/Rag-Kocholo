I donÂ´t think that such technology exists, where you will be able to run Linux binaries inside XNU.\n\nHowever, you could give it a try on the PureDarwin software distribution, that is a Darwin compilation and it will allow you to user softwares like MacPorts. Quoting their goals:\n\nThe goal of the PureDarwin project is to make Darwin more usable for open source enthusiasts and developers by providing documentation and by enabling them to retrieve, understand, modify, build, and distribute Darwin."
