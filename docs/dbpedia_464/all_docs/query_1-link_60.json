        "text": "Different fields? Did Jobs ever even touched a computer professionally other than to sell it?As of October 9, 2011, Jobs is listed as either primary inventor or co-inventor in 342 United States patents or patent applications related to a range of technologies from actual computer and portable devices to user interfaces (including touch-based), speakers, keyboards, power adapters, staircases, clasps, sleeves, lanyards and packages.I refuse to believe that it is possible to patent lanyard designs....all the uneducated hipsters believe Jobs is 'the founding father of modern computing'.It's a shame all the uneducated hipsters believe Jobs is 'the founding father of modern computing'. Not to mention he pioneered the invention of GUI's and such with the first Apple products.he helped to push computing from the hacker culture \"geek thing\" to the point where almost everyone has a computer"
