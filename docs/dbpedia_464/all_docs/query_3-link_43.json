It aims to demonstrate basic fuzzing techniques on image data to uncover potential vulnerabilities in image processing routines. The Objective-C Code implements 12 CGCreateBitmap & CGColorSpace Functions working with Raw Data and String Injection that are User Controllable Inputs.\n\nwhoami\n\nDavid Hoyt is an independent, authoritative source for Best Practices & Transparency of Telecommunications, Legal & Regulatory Matters since 1994.\n\nStart\n\nProject Documentation\n\nClick to Open the Xcode Project\n\nRun\n\nBig Picture\n\nMy Code\n\nThis\n\nProof of Concept\n\nNative Rendering of Fuzzed Images\n\nCommand Line Version\n\nRuns on x86_64 or arm\n\nFuzzed Image File Collection\n\nhttps://github.com/xsscx/macos-research/tree/main/code/iOSOnMac\n\nFuzz with Jackalope\n\nRun the Fuzzed Images through multiple Fuzzers\n\nhttps://github.com/xsscx/macos-research/tree/main/code/imageio\n\nRender\n\nSeeds\n\nBackground\n\nI had been using Jackalope for Fuzzing and to confirm that it could find easy to identify Bugs. Looking deeper at Jackalope, I found minor UAF, OOB, NPTR that impacted some results given the Seeding.\n\nI wrote this Objective-C Code for A/B Testing along side Jackalope using the Command Line version of this Code. Stitch together your Fuzzed Images into a Malicious Movie and then Fuzz with the VideoToolbox Interposing Code.\n\nThe Command Line version is preferred for Fuzzing and Collecting the post-processed Images. The example Code provides the ability to change a few Numbers in a Function() and further Modify the Program Behavior, perhaps you will get a good Crash.\n\n#pragma mark - Fuzzing Functions /** Applies a color shift fuzzing method to the specified pixel data. This method randomly increases or decreases the RGB values of a pixel to simulate color distortions that might reveal handling errors in image processing. @param data The raw image data. @param index The index of the pixel to be modified. */ void applyColorShift(unsigned char *data, size_t index) { for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) { // Affecting RGB channels int shift = (arc4random_uniform(2) == 0) ? -15 : 15; // Randomly decide to increase or decrease color value int newValue = data[index + i] + shift; data[index + i] = (unsigned char)fmax(0, fmin(255, newValue)); // Ensure the new value is within the byte range } } /** Randomly scrambles the RGB values of a pixel. This method swaps the values of two RGB channels at the given pixel index, which can help in uncovering issues related to incorrect channel processing or assumptions in color models. @param data The raw image data. @param index The index of the pixel where the RGB channels will be scrambled. */ void applyPixelScramble(unsigned char *data, size_t index) { unsigned char temp; int swapIndex = arc4random_uniform(3); // Choose a random channel to swap with another temp = data[index + swapIndex]; data[index + swapIndex] = data[index + (swapIndex + 1) % 3]; data[index + (swapIndex + 1) % 3] = temp; }\n\nPurpose of Using Fuzzed Images in Fuzzing\n\nUse your fuzzed files for analyzing & rendering to identify potential vulnerabilities in software that processes or displays PNG images.\n\nEmbedding fault mechanisms into a generic image and further processing it through fuzzing enhances the effectiveness of testing by uncovering edge cases and potential vulnerabilities in image processing software.\n\nThe presence of unexpected or non-standard chunks could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code, cause denial-of-service (DoS) conditions, or lead to information disclosure if the software does not properly handle such anomalies.\n\nWorkflow\n\nPrepare the Image:\n\nStart with a generic image.\n\nApply initial fuzzing to introduce random mutations.\n\nEmbed specific fault mechanisms to target vulnerabilities.\n\nSubmit to Fuzzing Harness:\n\nLoad the processed image into a fuzzing framework like Jackalope or AFL.\n\nConfigure the tool to use the image as a seed for further automated fuzzing.\n\nMonitor and Analyze:\n\nMonitor for crashes, hangs, and other signs of vulnerabilities.\n\nCollect and analyze the results to identify and understand the bugs found.\n\nCrash Analysis"
