Highly enjoyable from start to finish.\n\nWith the whole Matrix franchise, I do have a bit of a love-hate relationship with it. I think the first one is amazing. And I watched the next 2 films out of dedication. But I was never truly happy with the storyline.\n\nThere's plenty of breakdowns about \"what's wrong with the Matrix,\" so I won't go in to all that here. I am a little worried that Matrix 4 may \"jump the shark.\" But I will be watching that out of the same dedication lol\n\nI am hoping that Matrix 4 is some side-story type of thing. Perhaps NEO is dreaming. Or perhaps they are working with the machines now and entered in to some form of the Matrix that needs help?\n\nOr maybe someone screwed up and the peace between the humans and robots was ended; with this movie picking up where everyone is once again enslaved.\n\nSo may angles they can take. Just please please please don't jump the shark lol\n\nOh yeah, Kill Bill. I should have thought of that influence.\n\nAlso part of the plot is similar to Hard Revenge Milly : Bloody Battle, another awesome \"woman seeking revenge goes on a gruesome martial arts killing spree\". Specifically the plot of the female side character that tags along.\n\nI'd recommend the Hard Revenge Milly series (2 movies) if you like japanese action/gore films like The Machine Girl, Tokyo Gore Police, Robogeisha, etc.\n\nI'd post trailers for some of the Noboru Iguchi (The Machine Girl, RoboGeisha, Mutant Girls Squad, Zombie Ass : Toilet of the Dead, Dead Sushi) and Yoshihiro Nishimura (Tokyo Gore Police, Vampire Girl vs Frankenstein Girl, Helldriver) movies I've seen, but I'd probably get banned from the forum. Just the Tokyo Gore Police trailer alone is pretty messed up. (The two of them work together on some of those, Yoshihiro is a gore makeup artist on many movies and directs some too)\n\nThe most disappointing was RoboGeisha, they replaced the blood effects with CGI, which looked so crap. All the others use so much actual liquid fake blood that Evil Dead 2 would feel jealous.\n\nBut it does have this scene, making it all worth while. (No blood or violence)\n\nAuthor: Oculus Monitor, Auto Oculus Touch, Forum Dark Mode, Phantom Touch Remover, X-Plane Fixer\n\nHardware: Threadripper 1950x, MSI Gaming Trio 2080TI, Asrock X399 Taich\n\nHeadsets: Wrap 1200VR, DK1, DK2, CV1, Rift-S, GearVR, Go, Quest, Quest 2, Reverb G2\n\nWasn't expecting much for Black Widow, but was positively surprised. There're several awesome scenes which may justify the $200 mill budget. But most of all I don't remember any Disney 4K movie looking this sharp. Black Widow may be an example of a close to perfect 4K movie. While many other movies use upscaling from 2K to 4K, Black Widow is full 4K all the way. Even the larger special effects scenes, which often get reduced to 2K to save costs, looked totally sharp and 4K to me. Movie immersion never really has been better - ok, maybe if I could get 4K 3D, sigh.\n\nI can see other movie enthusiasts noticing the glory of the Black Widow 4K version too:\n\n\"The native 4K resolution further allows for a brilliant bit of textural gain as well. The picture is obviously crisper and cleaner. There's something of a glossier sheen to it at this resolution but the increase in overall clarity is obvious even without a direct comparison; simply watching the movie a second time reveals the jump. Still, A-B comparisons do demonstrate the exceedingly good uptick in textural gain, particularly obvious in close-ups where skin details, for example, leap off the screen with newfound depth and precision. Look at a Romanoff close-up at the 1:34:22 mark for a terrific example of the UHD bringing out a fairly substantial increase in clarity and fine detail. This extends to practical and digital elements, clothes, and various environments as well. Add in the absence of distracting noise and the picture's freedom from compression and encode issues and there's nothing to dislike here. This is a first-rate UHD presentation from Disney.\"\n\nhttps://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Black-Widow-4K-Blu-ray/258631/#Review\n\nBeing able to see small windows in building miles hundreds of meters away means that the depth of the 2D image was incredible. You can see all finer skin details like never before, lol - really felt close to Scarlett Johansson Florence Pugh playing as Johansson's younger sister wasn't a bad move too - I greatly enjoyed Pugh in stunningly high 4K res too\n\nThe Dolby Atmos sound was awesome too. Only using the UHD disc version you get lossless Atmos - when streaming the movie, Atmos sound is compressed, and the 4K movie is also much more compressed than the disc version. Thus streaming the 4K version is not at all the same as experiencing the 4K disc version (disc may contain up to 100GB data).\n\nMy son did complain that this was a \"chick flick\" - and that there were few men in the movie. But as I tried to explain above, for married men this may not be all that bad I do think Black Widow was a way for Disney to try to expand their female audience, not sure if that worked. My wife did like the movie a lot.\n\n7.5/10 on my scale. But that's only for the 4K disc version - you may subtract up to 2 for other verisons (4 for the DVD version, lol).\n\nOculus Rift CV1, Valve Index & PSVR2, Asus Strix OC RTX™ 3090, i9-10900K (5.3Ghz), 32GB 3200MHz, 16TB SSD\n\n\"Ask not what VR can do for you, but what you can do for VR\"\n\nGot bored and bought some stuff\n\nI don't even really like Tenet - but steelbooks are my soft spot (and Tenet isn't exactly a walk in the park, might not be a bad idea wacthing it twice)\n\n- and bought a girlie movie for the wife... the movie's budget was $200 mill, it can't be a bad movie! (By a complete pure coincidence I got the steelbook again )\n\nLast and maybe least, I bought some existential intellectual educational movie about hunting ... stuff ...
