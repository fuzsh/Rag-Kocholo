        "text": "See a Great Japanese Movie on the Big Screen for Free, Courtesy of Japan Society and SciFi Japan Source: Japan Society Official Site: Japan Cuts 2012 Special Thanks to Shannon Jowett The 2012 New York Asian Film Festival/Japan Cuts: Festival of Contemporary Japanese Cinema is now in full swing. Running through July 12 at the Film Society of Lincoln Center and July 12 - 28 at Japan Society, the combined festival will feature dozens of films, international and world premiere screenings, Q&A`s with filmmakers, and other special events. Our friends at Japan Society are offering SciFi Japan readers a chance to win free tickets to see one of three films on their schedule... the North American premiere of Takashi Yamazaki`s live action SPACE BATTLESHIP YAMATO, a 35mm screening of the suspense classic CURE by award-winning director Kiyoshi Kurosawa (PULSE, BRIGHT FUTURE) or the New York premiere of the outrageous ZOMBIE ASS: TOILET OF THE DEAD by modern schlockmeister Noboru Iguchi (ROBOGEISHA, MUTANT GIRLS SQUAD)! All three screenings will take place at Japan Society, located at 333 East 47th Street between First and Second Avenues in New York City.\n\nZOMBIE ASS: TOILET OF THE DEAD (?????, Zonbi Asu) Tuesday, July 17 at 7:30 pm New York Premiere Japan. 2011. 84 minutes, HD Cam, in Japanese with English subtitles. Directed by Noboru Iguchi. With Asami, Mayu Sugano, Ashana Mamuro, Yuki and Kentaro Kishi. A steaming heap of bad taste from the twisted mind of cinematic madman Noboru Iguchi (ROBOGEISHA, MUTANT GIRLS SQUAD). Wracked with guilt over the suicide of her sister, karate student Megumi accompanies a group of older friends on a trip into the woods. Things start to go badly when Maki finds a parasitical worm inside a fish -- and wolfs it down alive in the hopes that it`ll help keep her skinny. Attacked by a crowd of undead who emerge from an outhouse toilet, the group seeks refuge at the home of Dr. Tanaka and his daughter Sachi. Unbeknownst to them, Tanaka has been conducting experiments on the parasites and the zombies. Featuring special effects by Yoshihiro Nishimura and some truly jaw-dropping contributions from Iguchi`s genius subconscious. 18+ This film is unrated, but may only be viewed by persons 18 or older.\n\nCURE (???, Kyua) Saturday, July 21 at 11:00 pm Japan. 1997, 111 min., 35mm, in Japanese with English subtitles. Directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa. With Koji Yakusho, Masato Hagiwara, Tsuyoshi Ujiki, Anna Nakagawa, Yoriko Doguchi. Renowned for his horror films, Japanese writer-director Kurosawa Kiyoshi made his international breakthrough in 1997 with the psychological thriller CURE. Detective Takabe (Yakusho Koji) is assigned to investigate a series of murders in which the victims are killed by knife and left with an X-shaped wound carved across the throat and chest. All of these murders, however, have been committed by different people who are apprehended shortly afterward. With the help of psychologist Sakuma, Takebe traces the case to a young mysterious man with no memories of his past and strong hypnotism abilities. Pulled into a dangerous mind game, Takebe finds that the man is starting to have an unsettling effect on him as well.\n\nSPACE BATTLESHIP YAMATO (???????, Supeesu Batorushippu Yamato) Saturday, July 28 at 9:00 pm, Closing Film North American Premiere Japan. 2010. 137 min., 35mm, in Japanese with English subtitles. Directed by Takashi Yamazaki. With Takuya Kimura, Meisa Kuroki, Toshiro Yanagiba. The landmark 1974 animated series SPACE BATTLESHIP YAMATO finally gets live-action treatment from director Takashi Yamazaki (ALWAYS -SUNSET ON THIRD STREET-). In the year 2199, earth has become a wasteland after five years of radiation attacks from an unseen alien enemy called the Gamilons. One of the survivors is Kodai Susumu (Kimura Takuya), who picks up a mysterious device one day while hunting for scrap metal. After discovering a map to a planet inside the device, the military sends out its last battleship -- the Yamato -- in the hopes that it`ll be the key to save humanity. Kodai joins the Yamato crew and quickly proves to be a worthy team member. With only a year left before the end of earth, what will the Yamato crew find at the end of their long and perilous journey? One of the highest-grossing Japanese films of all time, SPACE BATTLESHIP YAMATO is a sci-fi spectacular for audiences of all ages.\n\nOFFICIAL CONTEST RULES and INFORMATION\n\nPrize: A.
