        "text": "For the second year, the Cinema Alliance pairs QFest with its long-running Danger After Dark festival, focusing on movies best viewed after midnight, like horror flicks and Japanese action films.\n\nMartial arts aficionados will be interested in \"Bangkok Knockout\" solely for its kickin' credentials. Co-director Panna Rittikrai mentored Thai superstar Tony Jaa and directed his charge in sequels to the popular \"Ong Bak\" flicks.\n\nFor more off-the-wall Asian entertainment, there's \"Microrze: A Love Story,\" that ties together four disparate stories by casting Takayuki Yamada as all of the male leads. Last year's Danger After Dark brought us \"RoboGeisha\" from director Noboru Iguchi, who returns again with \"Karate-Robo Zabogar,\" his homage to a popular '70s TV show. Similarly crazy is the Spanish road flick \"Finisterrae,\" about two ghosts who leave their realm to be reborn.\n\nThe one repertory film on the list is \"In a Glass Cage,\" a 1987 Spanish movie that goes beyond the torture porn of the \"Saw\" franchise by adding pedophilia and Nazis to the mix.\n\nRepping for the U.S.A. is Delaware-born Ti West, whose newest film \"The Innkeepers\" appears at Danger After Dark. His 2009 film \"The House of the Devil\" wowed us with its dedication to '70s horror. \"The Innkeepers\" returns to the haunted house concept of \"Devil,\" but this time the setting is a creepy hotel. Haddonfield resident Kelly McGillis (\"Top Gun,\" \"Witness\") shakes things up as a mysterious guest.\n\n- Molly Eichel\n\nDanger After Dark, various times and locations, through July 17, dangerafterdark.com."
