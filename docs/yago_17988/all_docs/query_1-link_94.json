The main character is a geisha with innate powers that is recruited by a group of assassing geishas. Step by step, parts of her body are replaced by lethal weapons:\n\nThis is the trailer. You can watch the full movie here\n\nWalking on a road and… she suddenly turns into a tank!\n\nIt is BAD movie but it has some good WTF moments guaranteed and it will surely bring a few laughs. If you liked Robegeisha, The Machine Girl is another movie made with the same style by the same director."
