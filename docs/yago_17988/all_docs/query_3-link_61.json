        "text": "Podcasts\n\nPodcast: Ted Geoghegan on ‘Zombie Ass: Toilet of the Dead’\n\nJuly 8th, 2020 | By Matthew Monagle\n\nWhen it comes to a film like Zombie Ass: Toilet of the Dead, what you see is most certainly what you get. Noboru Iguchi‘s 2011 cult classic is a gassy, bloody romp through some of the most familiar tropes in both Japanese and horror cinema. The director of The Machine Girl and RoboGeish has always kept his exploitation heart on his sleeve, and that makes Zombie Ass the perfect addition to any late-night movie party.\n\nBecome a Free Member on Patreon to Receive Our Weekly Newsletter\n\n(It also contains enough ass-zombies to make you start wondering if your early-30s are too young to schedule your first colonoscopy. Seriously. Get those private parts checked, men of the internet.)\n\nBut just because a film is about zombies and farts doesn’t mean it isn’t worth a thoughtful discussion. Movies like Zombie Ass shine a light on the thriving exploitation cinema industries in other countries; when contrasted with American cinema, they raise interesting questions about the line between cheap entertainment – and something considerably more important for international audiences.\n\nIn this week’s episode of the Certified Forgotten podcast, The Matts are joined by horror writer, director, publicist, trivia host, and podcaster (whew) Ted Geoghegan to discuss his love of exploitation cinema and his near-accidental journey into the bargain bin horror credits of the early-2000s. Is there more to this movie than the juvenile joke you see in the title? You’ll have to listen to find out!"
