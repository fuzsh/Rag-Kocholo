        "text": "Tak (Be a Man! Samurai School) Sakaguchi, Noboru (Robo-Geisha) Iguchi, and Yoshihiro (Tokyo Gore Police) Nishimura are teaming up to direct the genre mash-up Sento Shojo (Japanese title) or Mutant Girls Squad for Nikkatsu Films starring pin-up model Yumi Sugimoto.\n\nMarc Walkow at Outcast Cinema tipped us off that the Tokyo-based shoot begins on February 1st and lasts 20 days, with each of the men tackling a different 1/3 of the movie. The directors have stated that it is not an anthology film, and rumor has it that each portion of the movie will reflect their respective talents in action (Sakaguchi), comedy (Iguchi), and splatter (Nishimura).\n\nDirector Iguchi, who also wrote and directed Machine Girl, has stated that “gore and freak effects will be abundant” throughout the movie. Always nice to hear that, no?\n\nKeep it locked for more as it comes. In the interim … dig on a yummy photo of Yumi!\n\n– Nomad\n\nVISIT THE EVILSHOP @ AMAZON!\n\nGot news?
