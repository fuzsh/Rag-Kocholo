        "text": "Welcome again puny humans. Let’s start things up with yet another live action review.\n\nA follow up to Noboru Iguchi’s The Machine Girl (the excellence of excellence), the film Robogeisha ushers in his second attempt at cheesy laced violence. (Mmm,cheese.) Let’s see what this Japanese flick has in store for us, and why you don’t mess with a cyborg geisha.\n\nRobogeisha tells us the tale of two geisha sisters, Yoshie Kagusa(played by Aya Kiguchi) and Kikue Kagusa(Hitomi Hasebe). Younger Yoshie lives humbly assisting her older geisha sister, but they both run into problems when they are kidnapped by the Kageno Steel Manufacturing Company. This is a group dedicated to conquering Japan by using geisha super soldiers that assassinate unsuspecting targets through seduction. (An honored pastime in Asia.) Yoshie and her sister are modified to become the perfect killing machines but they eventually must fight their way to survival.\n\nWhat follows is a nonstop barrage of hilarious action sequences of the weirdest kind, including cyborg machine gun breasts and ninja stars shooting out from the butts of female assassins. There are some pretty good action scenes. Right off from the beginning of the movie we get a pretty good sword fight involving the two villainous goblin assassin women versus a group of bodyguards. Of course there are sword fights a plenty in this since there are so many lousy shots when using guns (otherwise known as the storm trooper method of gunmanship.) Things get even crazier as Yoshie and her sister descend into the form of cyborg geisha assassins. (Hey look! A bleeding building.)\n\nThe special effects are handled by Iguchi’s peer film maker Yoshihiro Nishimura, the director behind such esteemed films as Tokyo Gore Police and Vampire girl vs. Frankenstein Girl. Unlike in his previous film Machine Girl, the gore level is severely played down here. There’s plenty of blood spurting, but hardly the severed limbs and organs rainfall of Iguchi’s former work. Though no need to worry since this hardly hampers the action and humor throughout. (If you’re a gore hound…yeah,tough luck for you.)\n\nOn that note, the humor is put to good use. From the two sisters bickering and a bizarre song sung by senior citizens to a man yelling angrily after Yoshie smashes his head deep into his body, it is very obvious you are laughing along with this flick rather than at it since the film feels like it’s aware that this is an absurd premise.\n\nAdding to the humor is the music. The rhythm sways according to the situation quite nicely. Examples of this are a funky beat in the films introduction, hard driving guitar during assassin training, and a parody of the Robocop theme when Yoshie’s legs transform into a tank. It’s the John Williams of b-movie soundtracks."
