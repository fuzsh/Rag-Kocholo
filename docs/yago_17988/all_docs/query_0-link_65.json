Yoshie suffers near constant abuse at the hands of her elder sister, who derides her lack of grace and potential for becoming a Geisha at every opportunity. While Yoshie for the most part tries to take this treatment in stride, at times her rage boils over and manifests itself in almost-superhuman feats of strength.\n\nTheir lives change when the young heir of the Kagano Steel Manufacturing corporation notices one of these feats, and forces the sisters to become part of his private army of geisha assassins. Accepting their fate, the sisters quickly rise through the ranks of the geisha corps, constantly replacing their human flesh with ever more deadly and bizarre mechanical body-parts and weaponry, each hoping to out-do the other in their ongoing rivalry.\n\nHowever, when Yoshie is given the order to eliminate the family members of the other girls that have been kidnapped and forced into servitude by the corporation, she has a change of heart. Vowing to bring down the company and its cadre of cybernetically enhanced assassins once and for all, she puts her nearly unmatched skills in the arts of death-dealing to use in an effort to avenge the lives the corporation has taken in its mad rise to power. This decision puts Yoshie on a path that will inevitably lead to a final confrontation with her now more-machine-than-human sister, and to uncovering the secrets of the men who have been pulling their strings all along.\n\nRobo Geisha is a Japanese splatter-horror/action/comedy film directed by Noboru Iguchi (The Machine Girl). It stars Aya Higuchi as Yoshi, Hitomi Hasebe as Kikuyakko , and Takumi Saito as Hikaru Kageno. Originally released in Japanese theatres in 2009, it was later licensed for distribution in English by FUNimation. See James Rolfe review it here.\n\nRobo Geisha provides examples of the following tropes:[]\n\nAction Girls: Yoshie and Kikue, and, well, the entire geisha army.\n\nAnimeland / Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo: There is not a Japanese stereotype in existence that this movie does not portray. Yakuza, Geisha, Ninjas, Samurai, Sailor Fuku, Kaiju, Tokusatsu... you name it.\n\nAss Shove: Shows up with the cybernetic AssSword, which is exactly what it sounds like. Considering the rest of the film, it's surprising when the girls point out that using a sword protruding from your ass is not only embarrassing, but also really awkward to use. It doesn't stop them from having a sword fight around a conveniently placed stripper pole.\n\nB-Movie\n\nBadass Grandpa / Cool Old Guy / Handicapped Badass: Kanai.\n\nBeauty Is Never Tarnished: Both played straight and subverted - the most damage Yoshie gets to her face is having the skin of her cheekbone torn off, revealing her cyborg implants, and it doesn't look too bad, but poor Kikue has the skin on her face removed from the bridge of her nose down as part of her full transformation.\n\nBeware the Nice Ones: Yoshie.\n\nBlack Bra and Panties / Stocking Filler: Essentially what the Tengun wear.\n\nBlade Below the Shoulder: An interesting take on this trope, as one of the many hidden weapons in Yoshie's arsenal are a pair of retractable katanas that emerge from her arm pits.\n\nBlack Comedy\n\nBloody Hilarious\n\nBody Horror: Kikuyakko, by the end of the film.\n\nBrainwashed and Crazy: Kikuyakko, towards the end. Also the Tengun.\n\nThe Bully: Kikuyakko starts out as one towards Yoshie.\n\nCalling Your Attacks: Happens often.\n\n\"Wig napalm!\"\n\n\"Breast milk from hell!\"\n\nCamp\n\nCorrupt Corporate Executive: Both Hikaru Kagano and his father, Kenyama. They kidnap and force young women into becoming their personal assassins, attempt to murder anyone and everyone who gets in their way, and they ultimately desire to destroy Japan to achieve their goals.\n\nDark Action Girls: The Tengun.\n\nDirty Old Man: Kanai has shades of this, notably during his death.\n\nThis is paradise!"
