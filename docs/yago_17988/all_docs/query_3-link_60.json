        "text": "Now, I am no stranger to Japanese horror films. I personally prefer them to American horror, mostly because I think that the Japanese really know how to captivate an audience, unlike a lot of bad slasher-films and classic horror remakes that have no real aesthetic or even comedic value (and that means quit it, Rob Zombie). I absolutely loved Audition and even some of the more bizarre concept-movies like Battle Royale, where a 9th grade class is sent to a remote island and ordered to kill each other off until one survivor remains, are still favorites of mine.\n\nSo a few months ago, when my brother said he had some “messed-up Japanese thing” to show me, I was undoubtedly interested. I agreed to access the trailer on Youtube and there it was: RoboGeisha. The three and a half minute bag of crazy had me guessing whether or not the movie was actually real. With geishas shooting katanas out of their mouths, transforming into tanks, and something that can only be described as “fried shrimp,” I had to believe that this was some Japanese teenager’s practical joke on us gullible Westerners. But, when I looked it up on IMDB, there it was. Apparently that trailer wasn’t a figment of my imagination or an elaborate joke: people actually made this movie. And, even worse, once I watched it, I had to tell everyone I knew that this nonsensical, extremely gory film would make its way to America as soon as the translator could figure out what the hell the story even meant.\n\nReleased in the beginning of this month in Japan and screened at film-festivals in the States, RoboGeisha actually has some reputable people involved in the film. Writer and director Noboru Iguchi is also responsible for the slasher meets pulp-film shootout The Machine Girl and the special-effects production team had a hand in the bizarre Tokyo Gore Police. These filmmakers know how to make a gore-fest, and in just three minutes RoboGeisha undeniably delivers.\n\nAlso, since the movie’s release, the plot-line has been much more fleshed-out from the incomprehensible string of deaths from machine-gun busts found in the preview. The story centers around two sisters who are both in love with a young business man, and proceed to fight to win his affection. How that translates into acidic breast-milk, chainsaws coming out of weird places and bleeding buildings, I’m not quite sure, but I have a feeling it’s going to be the most awesome cult train-wreck this year.\n\nI absolutely cannot wait to see this film, mostly because it will actually provide concrete evidence of the sheer insanity that springs from the minds of the Japanese. So, I’ll be waiting patiently for the translation and, in the meantime, showing this trailer to everyone I know. Just when I thought I knew Japanese horror, RoboGeisha has thwarted all of my preconceptions. Good show, Japan. Good show.\n\nCheck out this insanity. It’s not safe for work, kids or normal people:"
