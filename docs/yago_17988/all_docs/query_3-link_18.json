        "text": "#58 - Directed by Noboru Iguchi from Asian Horror Challenge 2023\n\nProgress: 46/61\n\n\"Ghost Squad\" was... really hard to endure, IMO.\n\nThe plot, in theory, is actually promissing but the translation was far from it. The movie is a oddly mix (and very off-tone) of several genres that just don't seem to work that well.\n\nIf nothing else and to be fair, the girls (some of them more) seemed to be very into things, which was a plus.\n\nThe movie felt very poor throughout.\n\nEven the horror elements were, for the most part, quite underwhelming.\n\nThe ending (the movie was way too long) felt like it never came lol\n\nOverall, and apart from a few better accomplished scenes, a very uninspired and forgettable outing from Noboru Iguchi, IMO. Not very much to write home about in this one.\n\nI occasionally seek out trashy horror films because while they're immensely flawed they're also incredibly fun to watch. However, this was an exception. Took me three sittings to finish this flaming pile of garbage because I was bored out of my mind. Bad acting, terrible effects, loose plot and a lot of questionable shit going on here. Half star for those kooky weapons.\n\n[Content warning for sexual assault]\n\nshe can’t accept the truth and has entered an escape loop.\n\nthis is my sixth noburo iguchi movie and his movies are fun and silly with very unrealistic very entertaining special effects. ridiculous dialogue. funny. this is all that, but it has the most heart of any of his movies. revenge and ghosts that are stuck and unable to rest are two of my favourite things to see in cinema. it’s heartbreaking getting to know the young ghost girls and seeing what was taken from them. how brutally their lives were taken. with everything ahead of them. one haunting unable to even remember the full horror of what happened to her on this earth\n\nthe juvenile law in japan is…\n\nIf you know Noboru Iguchi, you know what you're in for here. Personally, I prefer his compatriot Yoshihiro Nishimura whose films usually have more artistry and edge - Iguchi to me is a bit like the Lloyd Kaufman of Japan, sloppy, splattery, goofy, sometimes fun but just as often tedious.\n\nUnfortunately, this is one of the tedious ones. Far, far longer than it needs to be (106m, why?), this tale of a bunch of ghost girls teaming up to get revenge on their killers is heavily padded with schtick and never goes anywhere interesting or transgressive. If it weren't for the nifty practical effects used for the ghost girls' weapons, it would be a total wash. Watch Karate-Robo Zaborgar instead.\n\nWhat are we some kinda ghost squad?\n\nA fun Japanese ghost story about girls getting revenge. The characters were a lot of fun plus it has a cool puppy girl. This movie probably counts as fetish material though, but that's par for the course with the director Noboru Iguchi. It has some really dark moments but overall the story was mostly fun and silly, and I had a good time. The actresses seemed to have a ton of fun too so that makes it better. If you can look past the weird, you might enjoy it. It has a great ending!\n\nThis movie is godawful. By all merits of its own it shouldn’t even be rated as highly by me as it is, but I had an unbelievably good time watching this with a friend and a couple of drinks. You’ve got a clumsily written story, flagrant continuity errors, a metric fuckton of loops jumped through to give the film a narrative reason to have lesbian ghost stuff and some truly terrible special effects.\n\nThe girl power angle of this movie even rings hollow thanks to the flagrant and kinda iffy sexualization of its four protagonists. Sure it’s gratifying to see these ghost girls get back at the men who hurt and killed them, but the inherent feminism in such a premise…\n\nI actually really liked this movie. I thought the way it was shot was actually really pretty, and some of the scenes with the girls are really well done.\n\nNo it’s not perfect, and it has many continuity errors through as the girls talk about what they need to do, but they also are young girls who are shown in the film, to not know what they’re doing to get there until someone shows up to help.\n\nIn addition it both exploits its female characters while also giving them personalities and genuine care to who they are and why they died. It’s depicted to be sad and brutal and the reality is that crimes like this against women are quite frequent. But here, in this fictional movie, the girls have a chance to take it back."
