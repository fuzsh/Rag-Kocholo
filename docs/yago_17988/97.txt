Director Noboru Iguchi and gore master Yoshihiro Nishimura team up for this hyper-violent and hilariously grotesque depiction of a very angry army of butt sword-wielding geisha robots with enough strength to embed tempura shrimp in villains’ eyes. Special effects in Iguchi’s (Machine Girl) over-the-top, feminist melodrama include chainsaw lips, blood-spouting buildings, geisha transformers, machine gun bras and some basic decapitations.

Robotic geishas, butt sword-weilding assassins… ass-assassins as I call them. Penis-nosed, milk squirting maidens… shew, I’m exhausted. AND THAT’S WHAT WE LOVE ABOUT THEM.

Just like the other over the top Nishimura flicks, there’s blood and gore aplenty. And for you loyal MoW’s, plenty of absurd characters to blast your screen, and your underpants, with glee.

This is a rent for sure. Great laughs and imaginative story. Over the top visuals. Enjoy, MoW’s, enjoy.
