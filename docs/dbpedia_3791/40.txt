Cedar Lawn was the home of John Thornton Augustine Washington (May 20, 1783-October 9, 1841), the great nephew of George Washington. It is a Federal style two story, white painted brick structure with a hipped roof and two central chimneys. The front porch faces east and boasts a one story Greek revival style with a pediment. South of the main house is a long, 1.5 story kitchen wing. To the north, there is a small, one story attachment added in the 20th century but in the 19th century style.

The Cedar Lawn property was originally part of the Harewood estate. The National Register of Historic Places reports that the property was left to Thornton Washington (born 1760- died 1787) and "in 1780, Thornton built a large log and plank house, naming it Berry Hill in honor of the Miss Berry he had married." Unfortunately, this property and structure was destroyed by fire. When John Thornton Augustine inherited the property, he built the present day structure of Cedar Lawn 1825.
