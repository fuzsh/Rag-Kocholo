        "text": "President George Washington's home at Mount Vernon is one of the best preserved historic buildings in the country, serving in many ways as the epicenter for pioneering advancements in the field. Yet, despite the clear importance of the landmark for American history, its protection was far from certain in the middle of the 19th century.\n\nBy 1840, the estate had been passed down to John Augustine Washington III, the last Washington family member to own Mount Vernon. (President Washington did not have children; when his wife, Martha, died in 1802, Mount Vernon passed to Washington's nephew, then his nephew who was Washington III's father.) During his tenureship, a series of poor harvests along with continued soil degradation, plus the steady stream of sightseers eager to visit the first president's home, accelerated the decline of Mount Vernon's condition. Washington III attempted to sell the property to the federal government and the Commonwealth of Virginia, but both bodies were deeply mired in the political and regional partisanship of the 1840s and 1850s.\n\nThe fate of the first president's home changed, however, when a woman named Louisa Bird Cunningham passed by Mount Vernon while traveling on the Potomac River in 1853. Its decrepit state prompted her to write a letter to her daughter, Ann Pamela Cunningham, asking: \"If the men of America have seen fit to allow the home of its most respected hero to go to ruin, why can't the women of America band together to save it?\"\n\nHer mother's words inspired Cunningham to form the Mount Vernon Ladies Association, which raised $200,000 (or $5.7 million today) to purchase the Mount Vernon estate, plus 200 acres. With that, the first national historic preservation organization, and the oldest women's patriotic society, was born. The MVLA has owned Mount Vernon since 1860, overseeing its care with the mission of restoring the estate exactly as it was in 1799, when President Washington died. Interpreting the lives of the enslaved people who lived at Mount Vernon has also been fundamental to the organization's mission since its inception.\n\nMany advancements in the preservation field, from comprehensive paint analysis and the use of archaeological research to the digitization of Mount Vernon via a historic building information model, have been pioneered by the MVLA. Thanks to their efforts, much has been discovered about what Washington wanted at Mount Vernon and how he lived there."
