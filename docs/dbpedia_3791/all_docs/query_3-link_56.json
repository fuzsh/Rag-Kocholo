        "text": "M, b. 1758, d. 5 February 1793\n\nGeorge Augustine WASHINGTON, son of Charles WASHINGTON and Mildred THORNTON, was born in 1758 in Stafford County, Virginia.\n\nMaj. George A. Washington was a distinguished Revolutionary officer and was aide-de-camp to Gen. Lafayette.\n\nGeorge married Fanny Bassett on 15 October 1785 in Mt. Vernon, Virginia. They continued to live at Mount Vernon after the wedding. A few months later, George Washington made George Augustine Washington manager of Mount Vernon. He remained in that position through the first several years of George Washingtonâ€™s Presidency. However, poor health forced him to give up the job. Eventually, Fanny and George Augustine purchased a house in Alexandria.\n\nOn 5 February 1793 George Augustine died in Mount Vernon, Fairfax County, Virginia, leaving Frances a widow.1 He was buried in Mount Vernon Estate, Mount Vernon, Fairfax County, Virginia.1\n\nLast Edited=28 Jun 2023"
