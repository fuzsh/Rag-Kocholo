        "text": "To my family:\n\nI recently came across the document below that states the most commonly accepted, or perhaps \"traditional\" is a more appropriate word for this family's history.\n\nFirst, it clearly demonstrates how and in what relation we are related to George Washington, which I am frequently asked about, and explains it pretty clearly.\n\nThere is a dispute, however, over this traditional Rogers lineage, and at the heart of it is the descent coming from John Rogers, b. about 1500, who was burned at the stake in England for his religious views of Reformation, and for printing the Bible. He has become known as \"John Rogers, the Martyr\" down through history from that time, and there is evidently a lot of controversy about his particular line of descent, with many families claiming to be descended from him. The document I am including does not appear to be the same as our line of descent until after it is in our country, where it does conform to our line, but to confirm that would take many hours of research, and then you would just have either confirmed or eliminated only one theory. The truth is that there appears to be little documentation of his direct line of descent, so there will probably always be controversy about it. Whatever the case may be, until documentation is shown to discount our line as it is, it shall stand.\n\nIn comparing what they have here, you will see that it varies some down to Samuel, at which time it coincides with our line and follows it from there down to the present.\n\nI do think it is important to realize that there is some controversy about this lineage, and to know that although you might be a descendant of John Rogers the Martyr, it is not something that is assured, or should be attested to.---Marcia Rogers Foley, descendant\n\nThe Jane Washington Thornton Chapter of the National Society of Daughters of the Ameri­can Colonists, the 10th Chapter of DAC in NC, was organized at Cullowhee Nov. 20, 1975, through efforts of Mrs. W. B. Harrill of Cul­lowhee, a 25-year member of DAC. It was named Jane Washington because she was a grandmother (several times removed) to a majority of the group. She was also daughter of Augustine II to which a majority traced descent.\n\nAugustine Washington m. Jane Butler. Their son was Augustine Washington II. Jane died, so Augustine Washington m. Mary Ball and to them was born a son, George Washington, first president. So Augustine Washington II and George Washington were half brothers and Jane Washington a half niece to George Washington.\n\nJane Washington was the wife of Col. John Thornton and mother of Nancy Thornton. They lived at the foot of Kings Mountain and John manufactured powder used in the battle of Kings Mountain. His young daughter, Nancy, served water in a gourd to Col. Sevier and his men as they moved up the mountain to attack the British. It was that day that Nancy Thornton met Hugh Rogers and they were later married.\n\n[Going back in history to the 1500s, ed.] Rev. John Rogers, a reformed English cler­gy [living in England, ed.], led by William Tindall, had prepared for the press much of the Bible translated into English [At that time only landed gentry could own a bible, ed.]. Soon after Queen Mary arrived in London, John was the first martyr. He was burned at the stake at Smithfield in 1555 on Feb. 4 (Encyclopedia Americana).\n\nHis children were: John, Jr., b.1538; Daniel b.1540; Samuel b.1541; Barnard b.1543.\n\nBarnard's children were: Thomas b. 1565; Jiles [Giles], and Samuel. Samuel was Robert Rogers' father, who married Francis Russell. Robert and Francis were parents of Hugh Rogers.\n\nThe Rogers Family were English. Robert Rogers (b. 1741) and wife Francis Russell, along with other family members, came to America about 1759.\n\nRobert and Francis first came to Philadelphia where Hugh Rogers, Revolutionary War soldier, was born, 1761. Robert and Francis moved to Mecklenburg Co.\n\nSoon after Hugh and Nancy were married, they all moved from Mecklenburg County to East Ten­nessee. From there they moved to Buncombe Co NC, somewhere within the Vanderbilt Estate. Robert Rogers died in 1800. Hugh then moved to Fines Creek, Haywood County, where Francis Russell Rogers died. Jackson County was a part of Haywood County earlier. Hugh and Nancy raised their family here.\n\nNancy Thornton Rogers died before her hus­band.\n\nHugh stayed on there with his youngest son, Powers, who married Matilda Noland. Matilda survived her husband. Hugh Rogers died at an old age and was buried beside his wife.\n\nHugh and Nancy's children (12 sons, 3 unaccounted for): Robert settled at Lake Junaluska; William went to Tennessee; John m. Polly McCracken; Mathew m. Lusk; New­ton m. Carolyn Lamb; David lived in Macon County; Hugh, Jr. went to Georgia; Powers m. Matilda Noland. [Note: missing are Cyrus m. Peggy McCracken, Barnard, James, Thornton LaFontaine.]\n\nDavid Rogers I (1789-1857) married Polly Berry and moved to Cullowhee where he owned much property and was a prosperous farmer. Their children were: Hugh b. 1760 m. Vinnie Parker; Phaniah m. William Brown; Polly m. Jason Chastain; Jane m. Nathan Coward; Sallie m. Andrew; Robert m. Samantha Rus­sian, Rebecca Smith; Minerva m. Mack Hooper; Emily m. Isaac Davis; David II (Uncle Dave) unmarried.\n\nHugh and Vinnie Rogers' children: Addie m. Jim Moss; Weston, m. Rebecca Wyke; Polly m. William Hughes; John m. Mary Hooper, Esther Adams; Fannie m. Lee Leach.\n\nPhaniah and William Brown's children: David, m. Sophia Davis; Emily, m. Basil Edmondson; Hamilton, m. Anna Bryson; Sarah, unmarried; Albert, m. Lou Simpson; Minerva, m. John Hunter.\n\nPolly and Jason Chastain's children: Sarah m. Brawley; Mary, m. Stevens; Stella, unmar­ried; Vie, m. Fortner; June, m. Sarah Wilson. This family lived in Georgia: Jane and Nathan Coward's children: (See related article)\n\nSallie Rogers Andrew had no children.\n\nRobert and Samantha Rogers' daughter Dolly was never married.\n\nRobert and Rebecca Rogers' children: Ida, m. John Cotter; Hugh, m. Fannie Pressley; Belle m. William Shelton; Lula m. William Messer; Sallie m. William Miller; Baye m. John Noland; Bertie, unmarried; Bethie m. John Hooper.\n\nMinerva and Mack Hooper's children: Timmoccenie m. George ; David, unmarried; Margaret m. Thad Dillard; Pauline m. John Alley; Lee m. Daisy Madison (sister of R. L. Madison, founder of WCU); after her death, Nellie Smith; Stella m. Will Bryson.\n\nEmily and Isaac Davis' children: Javan m. Ellen McAfee; Dave m. Judy Robinson; Sallie m. Ed Norton (brother of W. C. Norton).\n\n\"Uncle Dave' Rogers was a very industrious bachelor farmer who owned much property around Cullowhee. He gave the original plot for the college which is now WCU.\n\nSeveral of the early pioneers are buried in Little Rogers Cemetery, Cullowhee.\n\n-----Submitted by Hazel H.
