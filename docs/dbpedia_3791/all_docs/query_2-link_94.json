        "text": "I chose this Ancestor because he was born in KING County, VA.\n\nFrancis Thornton Strother is my 7th Great Grandfather. Born on the first of August 1702 in KING County, Virginia. He was the second son of William (III) and Margaret Thornton Strother who were first cousins.\n\nThe Strothers were a very wealthy family. Francis’ Grandfather William (II) was born in Kerknewton, England in 1627. He immigrated to Virginia in 1650 at the age of 23. He met and married Dorothy Savage in 1651. Upon arrival in America William purchased a great deal of land along the Rappahannock River, most of which Francis eventually inherited. He also served as High Sheriff of the County, a vestryman of Handover Parish and was called “Captain Strother”. He was Gentleman Justice of King George County.\n\nFrancis married Susannah Dabney in 1720. They had 10 children. Francis was a vestryman and a planter. Although not much is known about Francis and Susannah’s lives we do know a lot about some of their children.\n\nTheir son William, who married Margaret Watts, was deeded a section of the land along with a home owned by Francis in his will. Shortly after taking possession of the property the home he lived in burned. William then sold this tract of 280 acres of land with its two-story (8 bedroom) house to Augustine Washington, the father of George Washington.\n\nWilliam’s (Son of Francis) daughter, Sarah Dabney married Colonel Richard Taylor and their son was President Zachary Taylor.\n\nWilliam’s other daughter Elizabeth married Col. John Frogge. President Jimmy Carter came from this line.\n\nI have just begun to research this particular line. I am excited to see what else I may find.\n\nI am a professional genealogist, writer, photographer, crafter, reader, wife, mother, and grandma. I have two books available onAmazon.com: Your Family History: Doing It Right the First Time and Planning Your Genealogy Research Trip.
