        "text": "1. Wild Goose Farm\n\nWild Goose Farm is in the Terrapin Neck region north of Shepherdstown, an area known for its agriculture and connection to the Shepherd family in the nineteenth century. The Shepherds owned the Wild Goose Farm from 1838 to 1911. The large mansion house was constructed in three phases: 1810 by George Stipp, 1842-1845 by R. D. Shepherd, and 1911 by Edwin Jarrett. The combination of buildings on the property is unusual and unique for Jefferson county and the property was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018.\n\n2. Boidstones Place (Greenbrakes)\n\nBoidstones Place, known today as Greenbrakes, has been in continual use for agricultural production since the 1760s. The house was constructed in three phases—1766, 1850s, and 1920s—and most of the original structure remains unchanged. The 1766 frame house is one of two surviving frame houses from the pre-Revolutionary period (the other is the Peter Burr house). It was designated a Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. In addition to the main house, the historic buildings include a log cabin, log cottage, tenant house, springhouse, garage, machine/pole shed, hen house/wood shed, main barn, machine shed, spray shed, bull shed, and cemetery (possibly slave) to the south of the house.\n\n7. Shepherdstown Historic District\n\nShepherdstown, WV is considered the oldest community in West Virginia. It was founded as Mecklenburg in 1762 by Thomas Shepherd, but a settlement existed here before that. Most of the structures in the historic district date between 1790 and 1920. The Shepherdstown Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, the first historic district listed in the state of West Virginia. The historic district was revised with a boundary extension in 1986. In 1986 there were 386 contributing resources and 69 non-contributing resources within the District.\n\n9. Potomac Mills\n\nPotomac Mills is an 18-acre mill complex on the Potomac River that was in operation between 1826 and 1900. Starting as a grist mill to process local grain for eastern markets, the mill switched to cement production in the late 1820s. While the current mill structures are largely in ruins, the complex represents the commercial activity that once occurred along the banks of the Potomac. It is one of ten mills in West Virginia and Maryland associated with the construction of the C & O Canal, and it is the best preserved and most intact of the ten. During the Civil War the mill was burned by Union troops and was central to the Battle of Shepherdstown/the Battle of the Cement Mill during the retreat from Antietam/Sharpsburg. Now owned by the Jefferson County Landmarks Commission, the property was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014.\n\n10. Rosebrake/Poplar Grove\n\nKnown as Poplar Grove until renamed in the 1870s to Rosebreak, the home was constructed in three phases between 1745 and 1859. Started by original settler Richard Morgan, it has been home to the notable Morgan and Bedinger families. In addition, local poet and historian Dandridge called Rosebrake home for much of her life. The home was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. It is part of Morgan's Grove, which was designated a Historic District in 1999.\n\n11. Falling Spring (Morgan's Grove)\n\nFalling Spring is one building in the complex known as Morgan's Grove, completed in 1837. Morgan's Grove was settled by Richard Morgan in 1730, with Richard's grandson Jacob Morgan constructing Falling Spring in 1837. His eldest son, William Morgan, inherited Falling Spring and served in the 1st Virginia Cavalry during the Civil War. The property was the site of several community changes after the Civil War, including a railroad station and community agricultural fair. The building remained in the Morgan family until 1904, when it was sold to Dr. M. H. Crawford. It was be added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.\n\n12. Fountain Rock/Morgan's Grove Park\n\nA two-story home known as Fountain Rock stood here between 1831 and 1864, home to the Boteler family and part of Morgan's Grove. The estate saw activity during the Civil War, with troops skirmishing and encamping on and around the grounds. In 1864 Fountain Rock was burned to the ground by Union forces and never rebuilt. After the war, the property was used as a fairgrounds and then purchased for the current community park.\n\n14. Elmwood Farm/Plantation\n\nElmwood Plantation is located on land claimed by one of the Shenandoah's first settlers, Edward Lucas the II in 1732. His son Edward Lucas III, a Revolutionary War soldier, built the Plantation house in 1787. Lucas III reached the rank of second lieutenant during the Revolution by a commission signed by George Washington. Lucas's son, Robert Edwards IV, received his medical certificate from the University of Pennsylvania and inherited the Plantation. Although he was a physician, Robert chose to farm instead of practicing medicine. Robert was called to serve as a physician during the Civil War and allowed Elmwood to be used as an army hospital during the war years. Generations of Lucas's remained at Elmwood until 1948 when it was purchased by Dr. Oscar Stine. The house remains privately owned and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Elmwood was also inhabited and farmed by slaves; unfortunately, the records of these slaves individual names have not survived yet their quarters where they lived still stand to provide us some connection to them through the centuries.\n\n15. Linden Spring / Captain William Lucas and Robert Lucas House\n\nLinden Spring was the home of William and Susannah Lucas in the late-1700s. Constructed around 1793, the home represents typical Berkeley & Jefferson County construction with field stone walls and an “L” shape. The Lucas family was one of the early prominent settler families in what would become Jefferson County, WV. Linden Spring was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 for its architecture and its connection to William and Robert Lucas. William Lucas was known for his military service in the French and Indian War and American Revolution. His son, Robert Lucas, was governor of Ohio and first governor of Iowa in the 1830s. The house underwent a restoration in the 1980s when it was placed on the NRHP.\n\n17. Rose Hill Farm\n\nRose Hill Farm was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990 for its well-preserved architecture in the Greek Revival style. While other local houses have been remodeled or lost distinctive features of original architecture, Rose Hill has most of its exterior and interior features preserved. The main brick house (1835) and the smaller log house (1795) illustrate the architectural development of the county and the pattern of the construction of a smaller, rougher structure followed later by the construction of a larger, more sophisticated house on the same property.\n\n19. Rock Spring\n\nRock Spring is a two-story brick home near Shenandoah Junction, WV. The original core of the house was a 1.5-story structure built sometime between the 1790s and 1810 and the house was later expanded to its current appearance. Rock Hill is largely connected to the Hendricks and Snyder families who owned the property between 1762 and 1971. The house is a good example of the evolution of Jefferson County architecture from the first Federal/Early Republic style house to the Greek Revival appearance in the 1850s. Like many homes in the area, the house expanded along with the needs and wealth of the families as the county developed. Rock Spring is an example of the evolution of architecture and agriculture Jefferson County of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The property was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.\n\n20. York Hill (Twin Ridge Orchard/York Hill Orchard & Farm)\n\nYork Hill is a historic house and farm that has been in continuous agricultural use from the 1750s to today. The home at York Hill is a “telescope house” with sections constructed in the late 1700s, early 1800s, and 1970s. Initially farmed for grain and possibly tobacco, the land was converted to orchards in the twentieth century and is currently operated as the Twin Ridge Orchard and York Hill Orchard & Farm. York Hill was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006 for its role in the agricultural development of the region and the representative agricultural architecture.\n\n22. Traveller's Rest\n\nA British soldier who was dispatched to the North American colonies, Horatio Gates served with distinction during General Braddock’s attempt to seize Fort Duquesne from the French. Gates was wounded and was unable to serve in the military for a period. In 1772, Horatio Gates resigned his commission in the British Army after not realizing a position in government. He decided to settle, with his wife in Virginia. Gates purchased a farm approximately in Kearneysville, Wv. Gates named his property “Traveller’s Rest”. When the Continental Congress commissioned him as a Brigadier General, Gates left Traveler’s Rest to assume his post in the Northern Department.\n\n25. Sunnyside Farm\n\nSunnyside Farm is a historic farm and dairying operation outside of Kearneysville, WV. The significance of Sunnyside Farm is largely connected to William Fulk who owned the farm from 1899 to 1942. He farmed and raised an orchard on the property, but was most significant for his role in the dairying industry of Jefferson County. He was a founder of the Kearneysville Creamery in the 1910s and ran the operation between 1919 and 1921. Sunnyside Farm was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999 for the architecture of the main house and historic agricultural buildings, as well as the connection to William Fulk.\n\n27. Peter Burr House\n\nThe Peter Burr house is one of the oldest houses in the state of West Virginia. There are only about a dozen houses in West Virginia that pre-date the American Revolution. In Jefferson County there are five and all are stone except the Peter Burr House. The Burr house is significant as a rare surviving example of a wooden post-and-beam construction from the early settlement period. It is also an example of a family homestead in comparison to the other surviving structures which are largely stone manors or homes of wealthier families. The Peter Burr house was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981 and is now being restored by the Jefferson County Historic Landmarks Commission.\n\n28. The Bower\n\nThe Bower was initially constructed in 1806 by Adam Stephen Dandridge I, though the property had contained a hunting lodge well before that. The earliest known owner of the property was Major General Adam Stephen, Dandridge's grandfather, who had received it as part of a grant from Lord Fairfax in 1753. During the Civil War, the Bower was used as a headquarters by Major General Jeb Stuart. The house remains in the Dandridge family to this day and was added to the National Register of Historical Places in 1982.\n\n29. Woodbury\n\nWoodbury was constructed in the 1830s for Henry St. George Tucker, a wealthy lawyer and politician. He served in state and national politics, fought in the War of 1812, served on the supreme court of appeals in Virginia, and taught law at the University of Virginia. A Regency style mansion, Woodbury represents a new era of architecture in Jefferson County as the once frontier was now established and more Virginia gentry built homes there. The home is an example of wealthy antebellum architecture in Jefferson County. Woodbury was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.\n\n30. Gap View Farm\n\nGap View Farm was the home of the last surviving World War I veteran, Frank Buckles. The farm was first established in the 1770s and the main house dates from 1774. The 330-acre farm has been used for agricultural production from the 1770s to the present and is one of few surviving pre-Revolutionary farms in Jefferson County. Buckles acquired the farm in the 1950s and lived there until his death in 2011 at the age of 110. Portions of the farm property are now being conserved in partnership with the Jefferson Country Farmland Protection Board. Gap View Farm was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.\n\n31. Elmwood-on-the-Opequon\n\nElmwood-on-the-Opequon is associated with the families of General Adam Stephen and George H. Bowers, whose family still owns the property. The main house was constructed around 1830 with an addition done in 1906 and the property includes several historic farm dependency buildings. The property is reflective of agriculture that has evolved from the nineteenth century to today and the main house reflects the practice of building an early log home and then expanding or rebuilding the homes to meet the needs of growing families. Elmwood-on-the Opequon was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.\n\n34. Woodlawn (Wiltshire Farm)\n\nWoodlawn was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000 for its Federal architectural style and its agricultural history. It is an example of Federal style architecture with Georgian influences and was in continual agricultural use from the 1820s through the twentieth century. It was the home of the Wiltshire family from the 1820s to 1990. In addition to agricultural production there was also a school on the property for many years.\n\n36. Strider Farm\n\nThe Strider Farm was established in 1790 by Phillip Strider and has been continuously owned by the Strider Family into the present. The farm and the family were both influential in the economic and religious development of Jefferson County and West Virginia. However, the proximity to the B&O Railroad mainline made it a valuable location during the Civil War and was occupied by forces on both sides. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.\n\n37. Lee-Longsworth House (Jackson Rose Bed and Breakfast)\n\nThe Lee-Longsworth House, currently named the Jackson Rose Bed & Breakfast, is a two-story brick house constructed in the Federal style around 1800-1810. There is also a two-story attached kitchen wing; this was originally 1.5 stories and was raised to two stories after 1850. Local history has it that Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson used the house as a headquarters in 1861 and stayed in one of the second-floor rooms. The house was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.\n\n39. B&O Railroad Potomac River Crossing\n\nUntil 1824, Harper's Ferry relied on the ferry of the same name for transportation across the Potomac River. Since then, five bridges have been built over the Potomac, though only two are still standing. These bridges would be one of the factors that made Harpers Ferry into one of the most sought after positions in the Civil War, where it changed hands eight times between 1861 and 1864. The crossing was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.\n\n41. St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church\n\nSt. Peter’s Roman Catholic Church is a historic structure in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. Completed in 1833, it was the third church in Harpers Ferry as well as the first Catholic parish in Jefferson County. In 1896, the original building was demolished and replaced with a larger structure in the same location. The church sits on a rocky outcrop overlooking the Lower Town district, making it one of the area’s most visible landmarks. It is under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston. In 1999, the parish combined with the nearby St. James' parish and regular church services at St. Peter’s ended. Today the church has been designated as a historic chapel and hosts community events, weddings, and conducts a weekly mass for visiting tourists.\n\n42. Allstadt House and Ordinary\n\nThe Allstadt House and Ordinary, or tavern, property was originally built in 1790 by the Lees family. In 1811, 114 acres of the property was sold to Jacob Allstadt, who then obtained a license to run an ordinary on the site. The house was renovated and enlarged in the 1830s. The property's main claim to fame is its part in the John Brown Raid on October 16, 1859, where John Cook, one of John Brown's men, took John Allstadt, his 18 year old son John Thomas, and seven of their slaves as hostage along with the Washington's from the nearby Beallair estate.\n\n43. Beallair\n\nBeallair, or Beall-Air as it is sometimes written, was the home of Lewis William Washington, the great-grand-nephew of President George Washington. When Lewis William Washington inherited the property in 1827, he incorporated an old stone house into the taller, front portion he had built between 1850 and 1855. As it stands today, Beallair is a two story stuccoed brick structure with a stone foundation and boasting a classical revival architectural style. Aside from its impressive architectural features and state of preservation, Beallair played a part in John Brown's Raid of Harpers Ferry on October 16, 1859 when Lewis William Washington was kidnapped and held hostage by Brown and his men. Beallair was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.\n\n46. Rion Hall\n\nRion Hall was constructed in 1836/1840 by William Lucas and later connected to the separate kitchen dependency by a two-story wooden gallery. The Lucas family was a prominent early settler family in Jefferson County responsible for several historic homes in the region. Rion Hall bears the name of William Lucas’ maternal family, his mother’s maiden name being Sarah Rion. Rion Hall was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 for its architecture, connection to the prominent Lucas family and their contributions to both politics and literature, and the use of the house by General Philip Sheridan during the Civil War.\n\n47. Aspen Hill\n\nThe historic Charles Town home known as Aspen Hill was constructed around 1840 by James G. Hurst and is an example of middle-architecture in the antebellum period. Aspen Hill was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 as an example of the middle-class homes constructed during this period. Aspen Hill typifies this type of home as well as the transition from the 1700s when the region was dominated by a handful of wealthy landowners. By the 1800s a middling class of planters and merchants emerged, and these families established estates and aspired to the lifestyle of their wealthy neighbors.\n\n48. Barleywood\n\nBarleywood is situated on land owned in the 1700s by Samuel Washington, one of several large Washington estates in the area. Divided among succeeding generations, this parcel of land was owned in the 1840s by Samuel Washington’s great-granddaughter Millicent and her husband Robert G. McPherson. In 1853, the McPhersons sold the land out of the family and the estate has been divided since into smaller plots. Barleywood has been vacant since the 1960s and is in a state of disrepair. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.\n\n51. Richwood Hall\n\nLocated on land that was once owned by George Washington, Richwood Hall is a historic mansion constructed in 1829. Washington's nephew Lawrence Augustine, the son of Samuel Washington, resided here with his wife and family prior to the construction of the current mansion. The property was sold several times and in 1829, this brick mansion was constructed and has been well-preserved in subsequent years. Richwood passed ownership throughout the century from the Washington family to the Slaughter, Shewater, and Flagg families, each of whom were leading families in Jefferson County. The estate is best known for its connection to the Civil War battle of Cameron's Depot. In this battle, the Confederate army established a defensive position against men led by Union General Sheridan. Flagg and his family escaped but shells and bullet holes remain in the brick walls of the home.\n\n53. Ruins of St. George's Chapel\n\nThe ruins of St. George’s Chapel are a “T” shaped building with stabilized walls that range from four to eighteen feet in height and two feet thick. This Anglican Church was constructed between 1771 and 1774 to serve local families such as the Washingtons, Worthingtons, Morgans, and Stephensons. The church was only active a short time because the Anglican Church declined after the Revolution. In use only until the early 1800s, the Chapel rapidly declined and became ruins that were a popular local tourist location. The ruins were stabilized in 1975 as part of the Bicentennial and archaeological investigation of the property were done in 1999. St. George’s Chapel was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001 with the hope that further archaeology will be done on the property.\n\n55. Altona\n\nThis historic estate dates back to 1793 with the construction of a small weatherboard farmhouse by Abraham Davenport, Jr. In 1830, the estate was enlarged and a brick facade was constructed, adding to the size of the home in addition to adding two formal Federal-style entrances. The house was enlarged further in the 1830s by Colonel Braxton Davenport and his wife, Elizabeth Bedinger, named the estate Altona after her family estate in Germany. During the Civil War, both Union and Confederate troops encamped on the property. Union General Sheridan stayed in the carriage house during the Union occupation. Altona is an excellent example of a well-preserved colonial home and an early important economic center to Jefferson County and has operated as a plantation and farm since its construction in 1793.\n\n56. Charles Town Mining, Manufacturing & Improvement Company Building / Ranson City Hall\n\nBuilt in 1891, this 3.5-story Romanesque Revival building is a unique and commanding presence in Ranson, WV. It was constructed as the headquarters of the Charles Town Mining, Manufacturing & Improvement Company, which hoped to develop the economic prospects of the region. It was later used as a high school, post office, and is now Ranson City Hall. The building’s design makes it unique in Ranson, and it is one of the few buildings remaining from the early development period. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001 for its historical significance for Ranson and its architectural significance.\n\n57. Old Opera House\n\nThe Old Opera House is a historic performing arts center in Charles Town. It opened in 1911 under the direction of Annie Packette, a prominent local who sought to bring more culture to the community. The opera house hosted a number of plays, vaudeville shows, minstrels, sporting events, and film screenings before closing in 1948. In 1973 the building was donated to the newly-formed Old Opera House Theatre Company which worked to restore and refurbish the old theatre. It reopened to the public in 1976 and today hosts a variety of plays along with an art gallery and acting, dance, and singing lessons. The Old Opera House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.\n\n58. Jefferson County Courthouse\n\nThe Jefferson County Courthouse was originally built between 1803-1808 in Charles Town on a plot of land donated by Charles Washington. It was replaced by a larger structure in 1836. Due to damage incurred during the Civil War, the Jefferson County seat was temporarily moved to Shepherdstown, and then moved back to Charles Town in 1872. The Jefferson County Courthouse is famous for housing two treason trials: John Brown's trial after his raid on the Harpers Ferry armory in 1859, and the trial against unionizing coal miners from Logan County in 1922. Today the courthouse remains in operation and is open to the public. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.\n\n59. Downtown Charles Town Historic District\n\nCharles Town was laid out and established in the 1780s by Charles Washington around a public square where the Jefferson County Court House stands. In addition to the connection to the Washington family, Charles Town was the site of the 1859 trial and execution of John Brown, several Civil War engagements, the first Rural Free Delivery of Mail in 1896, and the treason trials of Logan County miners and union leaders after the Mine Wars. The Downtown Charles Town Historic District includes the central blocks of the town extending down Washington, Liberty, and Congress Streets. Of the 238 structures documented within the Historic District boundaries, 87% were considered contributing to the historic and architectural nature of the District.\n\n62. The Gibson-Todd House/Site of John Brown's Execution\n\nBuilt in 1891, the Gibson-Todd house was designed by the architect Thomas A. Mullet. While the building has gotten attention over the years, the site is better known for being the place where John Brown was hanged following his trial. John Thomas Gibson was the first occupant of the house after it was completed. His granddaughter, Frances Prakette, married Augustine J. Todd and donated the house to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The house is now privately owned.\n\n65. Hopewell\n\nHopewell was built in several phases starting around 1765. William Little constructed the first part of Hopewell, as well as a grist mill and sawmill on the Shenandoah River at what became known as Little Falls. In the early 1800s, projects to improve navigation and trade on the Shenandoah River included building a canal and lock to navigate past Little Falls. This prompted his heirs and future owners to build an additional woolen mill at the river. The house was expanded several times in the 1800s and 1900s. The Hopewell property was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.\n\n69. Blakeley Plantation (Washington-Chew-Funkhouser House)\n\nBlakeley Plantation was built in 1820 by John Augustine Washington II and is now privately owned and placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Generations of President George Washington's family, slaves, and prominent members of the Jefferson County community have inhabited these grounds. Historical figures such as Richard Washington, was one of the chosen to join the posse that pursued John Brown and killed one of the raiders, called Blakeley home in 1855. Roger Preston Chew, whom led Jefferson County's only Confederate artillery unit who was engaged in more skirmishes and battles than any artillery unit in the entire Confederate army, resided here from 1875-1892. Sadly not every slave's story is known; however, slaves such as Hannah Parker left behind information regarding her life and the lives of many others who born into slavery at this site. Philanthropist Raymond Funkhouser restored the home in 1943; this structure remains an example of the value of historical preservation of the symbols of America's past.\n\n70. Beverley; Bullskin; Stephenson-Whiting-Burns Farm\n\nEstablished prior to the American Revolution, the Beverley Estate has changed names over the years but the property remains a working farm just as it was at the time of its establishment in 1750. The original stone house was built in 1760 by John Stephenson on land surveyed by his friend George Washington. Stephenson's house was replaced by the current grand home in 1800 by Beverley Whiting. Whiting's plantation took advantage of the fertile soil of the Shenandoah Valley and produced supplies that aided Washington's troops during the French and Indian War. The estate also produced notable soldiers as well. During the American Revolution, Stephenson's sons John, Hugh, and William all rose to the rank of Colonel. Bullskin passed to the ownership of Beverley Whiting: a prominent and wealthy planter of Jefferson County. Whiting served as a court justice and prominent member of the agricultural producers of the community. In 1845, the property was officially renamed from Bullskin to Beverley in Whiting's honor. The property remained in the Whiting family until 1870 when it passed to the Burns family in whose possession it still remains and operates as a farm. Beverley has been home to revolutionaries, Colonels, soldiers, wives, widows, children, and slaves. Each individual has their own unique story woven into the history of the land. Sadly, the only documentation of the enslaved people who lived and worked here are tax documents and the modest slave quarters where they lived. Some of these structures still stand and provide some glimpse into the life of enslaved persons in western Virginia.\n\n72. White House Farm\n\nWhite House was constructed in 1742 as a 1.5-story rubble building and later enlarged. The home was constructed by Dr. John McCormick, an immigrant from Ireland. The architecture of the house shows the evolution of expansions and alterations to fit an expanding family and its use as a tavern in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. During the Civil War, White House was the site of an 1863 cavalry skirmish and a United Confederate Veterans monument stands on the property. The White House farm was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 as one of the oldest houses in eastern West Virginia.\n\n73. Cool Spring Farm\n\nThe property at Cool Spring was first surveyed in 1732 and was farmed starting in the 1750s. Through a succession of families, the land was cultivated for different purposes as part of the agricultural development of the region. The farm is distinct for its two side-by-side houses, evidence of the architectural styles of different periods. Cool Spring was placed on National Register in 2007 for significant in the historic agricultural development along Bullskin Run and for its evolution of architecture—Early Republic/Federal Style stone house and Greek Revival influenced main house with Victorian Era changes.\n\n74. Feagans' Mill\n\nFeagans’ Mill was in operation from the 1790s to the 1940s with three mills built on the same foundation. The mill was important to the agricultural progress of the region, processing grain from farms and plantations along the Bullskin. The complex was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014 for the category “Industry/Processing” due to its continued operation from the late-18th into mid-20th century. It was also placed on the Register for the category “Engineering” due to the progression of milling equipment evidenced in the evolution of the mill and because its milling machinery remains largely intact.\n\n75. William Grubb Farm (\"Conway\"/\"Brook Manor\")\n\nThe William Grubb Farm was established sometime around the 1740s and was the center of the local Quaker community. The Grubb family was one of the first settlers on the south fork of Bullskin Run and owned more than 1,000 acres of land here. William Grubb operated the farm and a mill, and the property included the Quaker Meeting and burial ground. The William Grubb Farm was added as a historic district to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.\n\n78. Shannondale Springs\n\nShannondale Springs is a 66.5-acre site on the Shenandoah River where a resort property operated between 1820 and 1909, and the site’s three mineral springs were used before and after that period. While very few structures remain from the resort, the photographic, textual, and archaeological evidence about the property illustrate the trend to use mineral springs for healing, restorative, or tourism purposes as well as efforts to increase tourism and the economic vitality of Jefferson County. The property is currently managed by the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources and it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998."
