Nalbandian quits tennis due to injury (and line judges breathe sigh of relief...)

Former Wimbledon finalist David Nalbandian has announced his retirement from tennis, citing a shoulder injury as the reason behind his decision.

The 31-year-old Argentinian announced his arrival on the tennis circuit in 2002 when he surprised many by reaching the final at SW19, where he lost out to Lleyton Hewitt.

He was also a semi-finalist in the other grand slams - the Australian Open, the French Open and the US Open - and climbed as high as third in the world in March, 2006.

But, despite reaching the final at SW19, Nalbandian was most well-known in Britain for his astonishing temper-tantrum during the 2012 Queen's final.

Nalbandian kicked an advertising board into a line judge's leg, causing a nasty cut on the official's shin, and was disqualified.

The incident was the subject of a police investigation while Nalbandian lost more than Â£40,000 in fines and forfeited prize money.

A loss of form and fitness have since seen Nalbandian tumble down the rankings to 231 and the Argentinian has now decided to call it quits because of a troublesome shoulder.

'It's a sad day but the shoulder is not responding well,' he told a press conference in Buenos Aires.

'As a result I can no longer compete at ATP level.'
