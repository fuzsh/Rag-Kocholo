Defending champion David Nalbandian managed to put the news of the accidental death of his godchild out of his mind and claim his place in the semi-finals of the Masters Cup in Shanghai on Thursday.

The Argentine's nine-year-old godson, Lautaro Nalbandian, was crushed in a faulty elevator in the tennis player's home town of Cordoba this week, according to a report on the Web site

infobae.com.

"Well, it was terrible," the 24-year-old said after beating Andy Roddick 6-2 7-6. "I mean, I couldn't enjoy the match that way I would like it. Life is like this. I can do nothing from

here. I try to push as hard as I can on the court."

World number seven Nalbandian still needed the help of Roger Federer to get him through to the last four for the second year in row and sealed his place when the Swiss beat Croatia's Ivan

Ljubicic 7-6 6-4.
