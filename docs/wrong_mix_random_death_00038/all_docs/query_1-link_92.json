        "text": "Let there not be any doubt that the real story (and prologue) of this year’s Tennis Masters Cup is David Nalbandian’s absence, a matter well-noted by NYT’s Chris Clarey.\n\nI, for one, can forgive him for not making the schlep from Argentina to Shanghai — a trip which would have demanded a minimum of 32 hours travel time from Buenos Aires, one way — to be the first alternate. True, he won the Cup as an alternate in ’05, but he’s just won two Masters Series events in less than 3 weeks; why risk jet lag if all he’s going to do is keep the bench warm (Tommy Robredo is doing a mighty fine job of doing so, by the way)? This way, Nalbandian gets to end his 2007 season on a high note.\n\nThis year’s eight-man draw seems to be missing an ingredient -– a sauce, or perhaps some spices -– to make things interesting. Despite the close contest between Roddick and Davydenko, I slogged through it impatiently. Maybe there’s more to be said for style — both in fashion and play -– than some (at least those not familiar with this blog) may think. Without a stylist to counter their respectively stiff presences, there’s little flavor to find here.\n\nThe exception, of course, was the match between Roger Federer and Fernando Gonzalez, a battle so moist, it needed extra bread to soak up all the sauce. Once the inevitable (Federer taking his 11th straight win over Fernando) turned into the impossible (Gonzo upsetting in three sets), the whole Cup has taken on a vastly different tone. It hasn’t hurt that the ATP’s latest darling, Nole Djokovic, has also stumbled.\n\nThere’s no sheriff in town now. Let’s see who can find their gun.\n\n—\n\nMichael Shaw writes about tennis and other subjects for the Los Angeles Times, and is also an artist. He can be reached at michaelshaw_sar AT yahoo DOT com. Read his previous posts for TSF here.\n\nThis week’s winners were all about the streaks…\n\nLindsay Davenport continues her successful comeback campaign with her second title in three tourneys. She beat Julia Vakulenko 6-4, 6-1 at the Quebec City Bell Challenge. She looked good wearing Nike‘s Drop Shot Cable Top from the winter collection.\n\nIf it ain’t broke…: Boo to you, Masters Series Paris. You were in the running for best tennis trophy with your Fanti Tree, and you replace it with this. But hey, it’s better than a silver cup, right?\n\nDavid Nalbandian continues his comeback with a 6-4, 6-0 destruction of Rafael Nadal in the finals. This is the second time in the last three weeks that the Argentine has beaten both Roger Federer and Rafa in the same tournament (the other being Madrid, which he also won. Not bad to have your only two titles in 2007 be Masters Series ones, no?). Could this latest streak mean that he’ll take the TMC like he did back in 2005?\n\nTwo more looks (one NSFW)…\n\nRoger Federer does it again. The World No. 1 is playing yet another Sunday, and this week it’s at the Mutua Madrilena Masters in Madrid. He took out Nicholas Kiefer 6-4, 6-4 in the semis and will face David Nalbandian in the finals. The Argentine “overweight has-been” is showing the form that took him to No. 3 in the world in 2006; he took out Novak Djokovic 6-4, 7-6 (4) in the semis after beating a rusty Nadal 6-1, 6-2.\n\nRoger’s moved away from his fall “Darth Federer” and his patriotic Davis Cup ensemble. Instead, he goes for an Obsidian Blue version of his custom Nike shirt (that one with the “RF” logo) and pairs it with the Mist Grey Control Shorts.\n\nTSF’s totally okay with the Roger’s haute couture. If you saw what Nike’s selling to the masses for Winter 2007, you’d agree.\n\nWhat do you think of the look? Tell us!\n\nSee an up-close photo of the “RF” on Roger’s shirt (plus a green striped tee for training) after the cut…\n\nDoubles: It’s weird to see two baseliners — Lleyton Hewitt and Rafael Nadal — play on the same side of the net. The duo’s entered in this week’s doubles draw at the Rogers Cup.\n\nLleyton’s renaissance: This most recent chapter in the Aussie’s career — showing off his softer side — can be credited to his new manager, David Drysdale. (SMH)\n\nYonex’s Summer ’07 lookbook: Clearly someone was watching a little too much of The Big Lebowski during the idea meetings for this summer’s Yonex line. These gawdy U.S. Open Polos are available here.\n\n(Racqonteur did better than me, managing to pry eyes away from the shirts long enough to rant about David Nalbandian‘s “samurai wrap”. While it might not look so hot on this Argentinian, his countryman Juan Monaco and the stylish Roger Federer look just fine in them.)\n\n(photos via Getty Images)"
