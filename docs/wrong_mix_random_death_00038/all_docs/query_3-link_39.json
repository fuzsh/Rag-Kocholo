        "text": "The doctor was out on court again at Wimbledon yesterday, but in circumstances more alarming to witness than those surrounding the now legendary battle of Timmy's Tummy last Monday, and with no smelling salts involved.\n\nXavier Malisse, the pony-tailed Belgian semi-finalist best known to British audiences for putting out Greg Rusedski in the fourth round, has suffered in the past with a racing heart and yesterday, early in his semi-final against David Nalbandian, after pulling off a number of typically vigorous backhands from the baseline, he began occasionally to lay the palm of his hand across his chest and breathe deeply. He also began rotating his right shoulder, as if trying to rid himself of a pain, and after only five games he signalled the umpire to call for the doctor.\n\nThe doctor seemed to take a small eternity to arrive. Then again, you try asking for a home visit in south-west London on a Friday afternoon and see how you get on. Malisse seemed happy merely to consult with the medic at this point, but at the conclusion of the first-set tie-break - again after hitting a winner of extraordinary velocity from the back of the court - he asked for another consultation and this time left the court, with the doctor's arm around his waist, for a 10-minute medical time out. He was probably grateful, as the crowd wasn't, for the rain break that came six games after that.\n\nThe doctor's report later in the evening was that Malisse had felt \"breathless, dizzy and generally unwell\". Yet by the time the players returned to the court shortly after 7.30pm, Malisse's problem seemed to have passed - which left him merely facing the problem of Nalbandian, who moved smoothly into a two-set lead. At this point, the 20-year-old from Argentina looked well on his way to becoming the first debutant in The Championships to go all the way to the final. But Malisse grew in strength as he left his earlier disturbances and distractions behind him and levelled at two sets all in the fading light.\n\nAnyone who has ever visited Wimbledon as a spectator will confirm that it can be hard to get a place on Centre Court. Generally you need to be extremely fortunate in the ballot or Sir Cliff Richard. But then exclusivity is part of what sustains this legendary showcourt's abiding mystery and allure. Why, sometimes even Wimbledon finalists don't get in there until the last day of The Championships, queue as they might.\n\nOut on Court No 1 yesterday, by a quirk of this year's rain-adjusted schedulings, Malisse and Nalbandian were playing, not just for a place in the final, but also for an opportunity to walk on to the Centre Court for the first time in this tournament - to break through the palace walls and finally learn what it feels like to step out in the arena known the world over as the place where Cliff did Living Doll.\n\nSo much has the rain denied Nalbandian in particular his share of the glory that his quarter-final took place on Court No 2, which isn't even the kitchen at the party; it's the pantry. During that match, in which he ended Ecuadorian interest in the tournament by very slowly seeing off Nicolas Lapentti, distracted spectators at the back were able to entertain themselves by peering next door at a tubby Ilie Nastase, going through the motions in the veterans' event. That's how far from the white hot centre of the action Nalbandian's match was staged: about 75 yards and 30 years.\n\nYesterday's semi-final should have taken place on the Centre Court but was moved out to No 1 so that it could run simultaneously with Henman v Hewitt and make the maximum use of the time available between the cloudbursts and spates of frustrating drizzle. Ordinarily, No 1 would amply satisfy the criteria for a dignified home for a big occasion, but its audio backdrop is Henman Hill, so the first set of Malisse v Nalbandian took place against an intrusive soundtrack of unrelated screaming.\n\nThis certainly seemed to confuse Malisse, who lost a point to his distraction at one stage and asked the umpire to remind those of us in the seats of our duty to silence during the rallies. It wasn't us, of course; it was them outside he should have been raising the matter with. But what can you do?"
