        "text": "The list of champions at London's Queen's Club reads like a Who's Who of grass-court experts, from John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors to Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg to Pete Sampras and Andy Roddick. On Sunday Marin Cilic added his name to that famous group but, unfortunately for the tall and talented Croat, his achievement is likely to be forgotten amid an incident of which we have rarely seen the like.\n\nMcEnroe was once stripped of his honorary membership at Queen's Club after swearing at the wife of the then‑chairman over an incident regarding the booking of a practice court. Other players have had swearing fits and smashed rackets but David Nalbandian being thrown out for kicking a linesman outdoes anything that has gone before.\n\nThe 30-year-old Argentinian has never been a stranger to controversy in his time on the circuit; in Australia at the start of this year he was accused of throwing water over a doctor during a post-match drugs test. As a junior, he was disqualified at Wimbledon for showing up late for his match.\n\nHowever, the incident on Sunday tops them all. Having won the first set on the tie‑break, playing some outstanding tennis, Nalbandian dropped serve to trail 4-3 in the second and his frustration boiled over. As he ran to the side of the court after missing a forehand, he kicked at the base of an advertising hoarding. But his anger turned to horror as his foot and the plywood followed through to kick the left leg of linesman, Andrew McDougall, who was seated on the service line.\n\nThe embarrassment of the incident was immediately compounded as Nalbandian watched the linesman recoil in pain, the blood gushing from his leg. As the crowd sat behind him showed their shock, Nalbandian was immediately defaulted by the tournament supervisor, Tom Barnes, who later said that he had no choice once he had seen the extent of the injury.\n\nNalbandian was contrite on the court as he apologised for the incident and later admitted that it was among the toughest moments in his career. \"I know that I made a mistake, 100%,\" he said. \"If I have to pay for what I did, it's perfect, I agree. I made a mistake and I apologise and I feel very sorry for the guy. I didn't want to do that.\n\n\"But sometimes you get angry. Sometimes you cannot control that moments that many time happens. Well, to me. Maybe you throw a racket or maybe you scream or maybe you do something like that. So many things happen at that kind of moment.\"\n\nNalbandian has never been considered the friendliest of players on the Tour; at times he has hidden behind his broken English when he does not want to speak; at others he has refused interviews even when he has won matches. Being defaulted in such fashion was clearly a huge disappointment after what had been an excellent week until that point.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, he cut loose on the ATP, the governing body of the men's Tour. Players are often asked to compete in less than perfect conditions, he said, which can lead to injuries, but are unable to change anything because the rules are set out at the start of each year.\n\n\"You have to sign that you agree with everything that the ATP says,\" he explained. \"And sometimes you don't. And if you don't want to sign, you cannot play ATP tournaments. So you don't have the chance to ask or change anything. Sometimes the ATP puts a lot of pressure on the players and sometimes you get injured because you play on dangerous surface and nothing happens.\"\n\nTo their immense credit, both Barnes and Chris Kermode, the tournament director, suggested that Nalbandian's comments should be taken for what they were, a bit of anger in the heat of a difficult moment. Kermode said he was sure Nalbandian would be welcomed back to Queen's Club in future years. Losing his runners-up cheque of £36,144, his 150 ranking points and a potential fine of up to $10,000 (£6,363) is punishment enough, they said.\n\nFor Cilic, it was a bizarre end to a good week as he picked up his seventh title. \"It feels a little bitter,\" he admitted."
