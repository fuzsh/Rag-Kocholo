        "text": "Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal have turned to playing mindgames ahead of the latest instalment of their epic French Open rivalry.\n\nFederer, desperate for a first Roland Garros title to add to his 12-strong Grand Slam collection, believes he is the more positive of the two men while Nadal, bidding for a fourth historic trophy, says the world number one’s decision to bring in Jose Higueras as coach could backfire.\n\nNadal, with a perfect record of 21 wins in 21 matches here, holds a mesmeric stranglehold over the world number one, winning eight of their nine claycourt meetings, including the last two finals here, and 10 of their 16 total career clashes.\n\nThat dominance has continued in 2008 with Nadal beating Federer in the finals of the Monte Carlo and Hamburg Masters. But the Swiss superstar, who needs a Roland Garros title to become just the sixth man to clinch a career Grand Slam, insists his approach has not reaped its rewards.\n\nGood Tactics\n\n“I know I can beat him. I’m the one playing aggressive. I’m the one trying hard. I’m the one taking the risks in those matches, so I think I have positive chances of winning here,” said Federer who will face tricky American Sam Querrey in his opener. “Two years ago I was more pessimistic, because I saw that Rafa was completely dominating the game on clay. But now I think I’m really close, and I believe I have the good tactics. I showed it in Monte Carlo and Hamburg. I just need to be broken one time less.”\n\nIn an effort to iron out the problems, he has turned to Higueras who coached Michael Chang and Jim Courier to the title here.\n\nHowever, Nadal, is not convinced by the merits of that decision. “It’s difficult to change the style of probably the best player in history in just three or four weeks,” said Nadal, who will be bidding to follow Bjorn Borg into the record books by winning four French Opens in a row.\n\nNadal will begin his campaign against a qualifier but could face world number three Novak Djokovic, the Australian Open champion, in the semis. Compared to Federer, he has the toughest of the two draws with a potential quarter-final match-up with David Nalbandian, against whom he has played two and lost two. But his record on clay is intimidating. Since April 2005, the 21-year-old Spaniard has racked up 108 wins in 110 matches on the surface.\n\nDjokovic, who starts his campaign against Denis Gremelmayr, is the man breathing down both Federer and Nadal’s necks. Beaten by Nadal in the semi-finals here in 2007 and quarter-finals in 2006, the third seed is the most successful player on tour this year.\n\nFederer, Nadal and Djokovic are head and shoulders above the rest of the men’s field.\n\nAs a result, the top trio are certain to dominate court time, but there won’t be a dry eye in the house when former triple champion Gustavo Kuerten plays and, probably, loses in the first round."
