        "text": "Andy Murray celebrated a victory at the Rome Masters against David Nalbandian on the same day he turned 25 to take him through to the third round of the competition.\n\nMurray was pushed to the limit by former Wimbledon runner-up Nalbandian before booking his place in the next round of the Rome Masters with a 6-1, 4-6, 7-5 win.\n\nBirthday-boy Murray swept through the first set, dominating Nalbandian’s serve.\n\nThe Argentine levelled as Murray’s serve deserted him and went a break up in the decider before his errors began to tell and the Scot clawed his way back on the red clay.\n\nMurray eventually clinched his victory in two hours and 37 minutes.\n\nThe British number one has recently recovered from a back injury and was happy he was able to win despite being forced to miss last week’s Madrid Masters because of the complaint.\n\n‘The way the last two weeks have gone, I am so happy to win,’ he said.\n\n‘When you haven’t hit that many balls you don’t feel that comfortable.\n\n‘But it’s like Roger [Federer] last week in his first match in Madrid, he wins 7-6 in the third and then goes on to win the title.\n\n‘That’s how it works sometimes, so hopefully I can go on from here.’"
