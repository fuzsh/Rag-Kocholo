        "text": "Associated Press\n\nMELBOURNE, Australia -- Andy Roddick had a much easier run to the Australian Open semifinals than he did two years ago, one that Lleyton Hewton can only envy.\n\nAveraging just 11‚ÅÑ2; hours per match, Roddick advanced today when Russia's Nikolay Davydenko experienced breathing problems for the second straight match and retired after trailing 6-3, 7-5, 4-1.\n\nRoddick next faces the third-seeded Hewitt, a 6-3, 6-2, 1-6, 3-6, 10-8 winner over David Nalbandian in a 4-hour, 50 minute match with fireworks on and off the court.\n\nThe other semifinal has defending champion Roger Federer against fourth-seeded Marat Safin in a rematch of last year's final.\n\nHewitt gave the home crowd plenty to cheer about in his gritty victory, with Australia Day fireworks going off near the arena in the third set.\n\n\"It's been pretty smooth sailing so far,\" said Roddick, who has only dropped one set in five matches.\n\nOn the women's side, top-seeded Lindsay Davenport, healthy after a bout of bronchitis just before the Australian Open, outlasted Olympic bronze medalist Alicia Molik, seeded 10th, 6-4, 4-6, 9-7.\n\nShe will face France's Nathalie Dechy, who reached a Grand Slam semifinal for the first time. Dechy, seeded 19th, ousted No. 12 Patty Schnyder 5-7, 6-1, 7-5.\n\nWhile the two women's quarterfinals lasted exactly the same time -- 2:33 -- Davenport then headed back out to advance to the doubles finals with Corina Morariu in a three-set victory that took another 1:44. She said she never considered defaulting to improve her singles prospects.\n\nShe has only about 20 hours to recover, taking the court after fourth-seeded Maria Sharapova and No. 7 Serena Williams meet in a rematch of last year's Wimbledon final, when the 17-year-old Sharapova won her first Grand Slam title."
