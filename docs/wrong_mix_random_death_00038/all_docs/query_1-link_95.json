        "text": "LONDON, (Reuters) – Argentina’s David Nalbandian was defaulted from his Queen’s Club final against Croatia’s Marin Cilic yesterday for kicking out and injuring a linesman.\n\nNalbandian was leading 7-6 3-3 when he dropped serve in the seventh game and reacted by slamming his right foot into a wooden advertising board which disintegrated and caused a nasty gash on official Andrew McDougall’s left leg.\n\nA shocked McDougall cried out and instantly clutched his leg. When he rolled up his beige trousers, blood could be seen seeping from his shin. He received some on-court attention before being escorted off the ground to the club’s medical centre.\n\nAfter prolonged discussions between a number of tournament and ATP officials, umpire Fergus Murphy awarded Cilic the match by disqualifying Nalbandian for “unsportsmanlike behaviour”.\n\nThe 12,000 capacity crowd booed, whistled and chanted “play on” but it was match over. Cilic and Nalbandian both retreated to their seats unable to believe the events that had just unfolded.\n\nATP rules state instant disqualification in such instances but the Argentine, a Wimbledon finalist in 2002, felt he had been harshly punished and lashed out again during a rather strange presentation ceremony.\n\n“I’m very sorry to do that,” the 30-year-old told the crowd who had been booing and jeering after the final had been cut short.\n\n“Sometimes you get frustrated on court and it’s tough to control… sometimes I do a mistake."
