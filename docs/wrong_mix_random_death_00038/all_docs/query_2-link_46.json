        "text": "The Museum of Death, located on Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, Los Angeles, and New Orleans, was established in June 1995 by J. D. Healy and Catherine Shultz. The founders' stated goal for the museum is \"to make people happy to be alive.\" This unique museum offers a different perspective on life and death, aiming to provide visitors with a deeper appreciation of their own lives.\n\nExhibits at the Museum of Death\n\nThe Museum of Death showcases a wide variety of art and artifacts related to the subject of death. Exhibits include baby coffins, letters and artwork from various serial killers, films about autopsies, explicit photographs of crime victims, and a room dedicated to taxidermy. The museum also features a recreation of the Heaven's Gate mass suicide, including the original beds. One of the most notable items on display is the head of Henri Landru. In 2014, the museum added Thanatron, one of the original suicide machines built by Jack Kevorkian, to its collection."
