        "text": "Tyler Hansbrough wants to make one more run at the NCAA championship. The North Carolina star will have to wait a little longer to find out whether two of his high-scoring teammates will be back to help him.\n\nThe Associated Press National Player of the Year said Friday that he will return for his senior year. However, sophomores Ty Lawson and Wayne Ellington will declare for the NBA Draft, though they won’t hire agents – leaving open the possibility of their return.\n\nHansbrough, a 6-foot-9 forward, averaged 22.6 points and 10.2 rebounds. He led the Tar Heels (36-3) to the winningest season in school history and the Final Four while sweeping the major national player of the year awards.\n\nETC.: Brigham Young guard Lee Cummard is entering his name for the NBA Draft, but will keep his options open by not hiring an agent. Cummard was an AP All-America honorable mention selection as a junior when he led BYU in scoring at almost 16 points per game.\n\nA Miami judge denied bail for one of the suspects in the slaying of Washington Redskins star Sean Taylor.\n\nCircuit Judge Dennis Murphy noted that 20-year-old Jason Scott Mitchell and three other suspects allegedly hatched their plot in the Fort Myers area and drove across the state intending to burglarize Taylor’s Miami-area home.\n\n“Youth and guns have been such a prevalent issue of concern in our community. Now we’re getting it imported from other parts of the state,” Murphy said at a hearing. “I’m not sure any form of release would adequately protect the public.”\n\nJurisprudence\n\nRoger Federer rallied from a set down to defeat David Nalbandian, 5-7, 6-2, 6-2, and advance to the semifinals of the Monte Carlo Masters.\n\nFederer remains on course for a third straight final against three-time defending champion Rafael Nadal, who beat No. 5 David Ferrer of Spain, 6-1, 7-5.\n\nMorgan Hamm’s petition to the U.S. gymnastics championships was approved, keeping alive his bid to make a third Olympic squad.\n\nHamm dropped out of a qualifying meet Wednesday, suffering from an allergic reaction that made breathing difficult. He is on the comeback trail after tearing a pectoral muscle in October. The qualifying meet in Colorado Springs, Colo., was his first competition since the injury.\n\nHe planned to compete in four events, but dropped out after two, saying he could barely breathe in the floor exercise. Thus he had to file a petition to gain a spot in next month’s nationals.\n\nETC.: Georgia won its fourth straight NCAA women’s gymnastics title in Athens, Ga. Utah was second for the third straight year. UCLA’s Tasha Schwikert won the individual all-around title with 39.6 points.\n\nBanned rider Ivan Basso has signed a two-year contract with the Liquigas team to return to cycling next year.\n\nIn June 2007, Basso became the first high-profile rider suspended for the recent doping scandals rocking cycling. He received the maximum punishment after acknowledging involvement in the Spanish blood-doping probe known as Operation Puerto.\n\nBasso won the Giro d’Italia in 2006 and finished on the Tour de France podium twice before being banned.\n\nLeonel Manzano broke away in the final 200 meters and carried Texas to its third straight Penn Relays victory in the college men’s distance medley relay championship in Philadelphia.\n\nThe victory moved Texas toward its stated goal of trying for a Relays sweep of the DMR, 3,200 and 4-mile relays. The sweep has been accomplished by four schools, Maryland in 1940, Michigan in 1945 and 2005, Arkansas in 1999, and Villanova 11 times from 1964-80.\n\nAsafa Powell, the world record-holder at 100 meters, pulled out with an injured chest muscle.\n\nETC.: Georgia’s Chris Hill threw his javelin 268 feet, 1 inch at the Drake Relays to set a meet record and take the men’s college title in Des Moines, Iowa. It was the best throw by a U.S. college athlete and the fifth-best in the world this year.\n\nOlympics\n\nOlympic marathon champion Stefano Baldini has a stress fracture in his left leg and will miss a month of training, slowing his bid to defend his crown."
