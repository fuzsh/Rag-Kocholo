        "text": "It was a peculiar moment, because only a few seconds earlier Nadal had been joking about his autobiography and pronouncing himself delighted with his form. Then he slumped back in his chair, putting his hand to his face, and slid under the desk. It did not appear to be a case of a particularly tough question – although the interviews had switched to Spanish by this stage.\n\nThe unscheduled interruption came fully two hours after Nadal had walked off the court. He was on the floor for a good ten minutes, while a physio stretched out his leg. But eventually he got up and declared himself recovered. \"I just have cramping in front and behind,\" he said. \"That's why I was so painful. That's all.\" And he carried on speaking to the local reporters from Spain.\n\nEarlier in an incident-packed day for the No. 2 seed, Nadal had called the trainer during the match for attention to his foot, but the problem wasn’t as serious as it looked. Rather than a recurrence of the tendon problem that has affected his footwork since Wimbledon, Nadal just had a little blister. “I am lucky,” he said as he left the court.\n\nNadal’s feet were forced to cover plenty of ground on a stiflingly airless day in New York. Despite a lowly ranking of No. 76, Nalbandian is justly feared by all the top players because he is one of the purest hitters in the game. His groundstrokes are mostly flat, fast and low over the net, whereas Nadal plays with more loop and heavy topspin. And during the early part of the match it was the Argentine who was forcing the pace, jumping into the air to strike his double-handed backhand like a piston.\n\nNadal cannot have been comfortable. Both players were bathed in sweat from the first few games, and he admitted later that he had changed his shirt five times. But he is used to suffering. His recent autobiography revealed how he was trained to deal with it from an early age by his uncle Toni, an ornery fellow who used to hit balls at him when he wasn’t looking, call him a mummy’s boy and send him home in tears.\n\n“Endure, put up with whatever comes your way, learn to overcome weakness and pain.” That was the Toni way, as related by Nadal in his book. And it came in handy on this occasion. Nadal showed an early sign of weakness when he double-faulted on break point, to go 3-2 down, but he improved as the match went on and felt dominant by the end.\n\nNalbandian is one of those sportsman with more talent than focus; a sort of Matthew le Tissier of tennis. On Sunday, though, he was in one of his more switched on moods. He gave Nadal a real test, especially early on, when he served for the first set at 5-4.\n\nThere are plenty of people around Flushing Meadows who believe that Nadal is losing his edge, partly because of his sore tendon and partly because of his recent inability to beat Novak Djokovic. But there was little sign of it here.\n\nAs Nalbandian served at that key moment in the first set, Nadal broke back for 5-5 with a magnificent sequence of points. He squeezed one forward pass down the line at full extension, using the incredibly fast hands that make him such a unique talent.\n\n“I was happy about almost everything today,” he said. “I think my movements worked pretty well, and the forehand worked really well, and the backhand, too.\""
