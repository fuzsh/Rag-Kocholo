        "text": "Lleyton Hewitt prevented an Australia Day of disappointment at the Australian Open with a battling victory, lifting the gloom after compatriot Alicia Molik was dumped out.\n\nHewitt advanced to a semi-final meeting with second seed Andy Roddick after battling through the pain barrier to defeat Argentina's David Nalbandian 6-3, 6-2, 1-6, 3-6, 10-8 in an epic 4hr 5min duel on the Rod Laver Arena.\n\nThe third seed's victory raised the roof after Melbourne Park fans had watched Molik suffer a heartbreaking 6-4, 4-6, 9-7 loss in her quarter-final with world number one Lindsay Davenport as Australia celebrated its nation holiday.\n\nPrior to this season, Hewitt had never gone further than the fourth round of his home grand slam in eight previous attempts and is bidding to become the first Australian winner of the singles crown since Mark Edmondson in 1976.\n\nThe 23-year-old former world number one had been nursing a hip injury going into the quarter-final and looked to be heading for defeat as the problem flared again allowing Nalbandian to level at two sets apiece.\n\nBut Hewitt dug in for victory and is now looking forward to Friday.\n\n\"Last year I was beaten on Australia Day,\" Hewitt said. \"Thank Christ I came away with a win tonight. It's a long way to the title but I'm hanging in there.\n\n\"I had to dig deep in the fifth set but yet again the old never-say-die approach got me through. I think I'm as mentally tough as anyone out there and I think I've won a lot of matches in the past because of that,\" Hewitt said.\n\nHewitt had attracted criticism in the build-up for his aggressive on-court behaviour, roaring and pumping his fist even in response to errors by opponents.\n\nThere was no toning down of his act against Nalbandian, and tension simmered between the two players throughout, stoked by some controversial line calls.\n\nEarlier, Roddick reached the semi-finals for the second time after 26th-seeded opponent Nikolay Davydenko of Russia retired with breathing difficulties as the American led 6-3, 7-5, 4-1.\n\nRoddick has spent a total of just 7hr 42min on court en route to the last four and said he was feeling fresh.\n\n\"It's been pretty smooth sailing so far as much so as I've ever had being in this position in a grand slam. I don't have many miles on me so far this tournament,\" he said.\n\nDavydenko frequently called on the trainer and tournament doctor for treatment during changeovers. He used an inhaler several times and donned an ice vest to help cool down during changeovers in the second and third sets.\n\nBrave Molik falls just short\n\nEarlier, Davenport had thrown a dampener on Australia's holiday mood to defeat Molik and set up a semi-final with France's 19th seed Nathalie Dechy as fierce heat disrupted play again.\n\nBoth women's quarter-finals were halted for 10 minutes after the second set to allow players a respite from the heat as the mercury soared past 35 degrees Celsius.\n\nDavenport, chasing her fourth career grand slam title, looked to have squandered victory when she had her serve broken by Molik after holding match point at 5-4 in the final set.\n\nThe next four games went with serve, but Davenport scored the all-important break to take an 8-7 lead and then recovered from 15-40 down to hold serve and seal victory with a forehand volley.\n\n\"I don't know how I did that. I really thought I'd let the match get away from me in the final set,\" said Davenport. \"I don't know how I got it back. It was a match with a lot of ups and downs.\"\n\nMolik, dreaming of becoming the first Australian winner of the women's title since Chris O'Neil 27 years ago, refused to be downcast at the end of a campaign that has helped propel her into the top 10.\n\n\"The bottom line is I probably had a chance out there to win today. I guess I can be comforted by the fact that I feel like I'm going to put myself in more positions like today to beat the top five players in the world,\" she said.\n\nDechy advanced to the first grand slam semi-final of her career after shading a tight encounter with 12th seed Patty Schnyder of Switzerland, winning 5-7, 6-1, 7-5 after an energy-sapping 2hr 33min contest.\n\nBut Dechy voiced disappointment that the match was relegated to the Margaret Court Arena, the third-choice showcourt, at the same time as Molik's clash with Davenport, meaning only a smattering of fans bothered to watch.\n\n\"I feel really disappointed because you just think that nobody cared too much about this match, and it's still a quarter-final grand slam,\" Dechy said."
