        "text": "Lleyton Hewitt again needed on-court treatment for a hip injury as he scraped past Argentina's David Nalbandian in front of a capacity 16,000 crowd on Australia Day in Melbourne.\n\nThe third seed was three times within two points of defeat in the decider, but eventually sealed a 6-3 6-2 1-6 3-6 10-8 victory in four hours five minutes, the fifth set taking an hour and 41 minutes.\n\nIt was a typical fighting display from the 23-year-old and not for the first time in the centenary championships there was obvious ill-feeling between the players.\n\nJuan Ignacio Chela spat at Hewitt in their third round match after tiring of his frequent cries of `Come on', especially after his own errors rather than Hewitt winners.\n\nNalbandian admitted before the game that many players did not like the Australian's antics and he and Hewitt twice exchanged words at the change of ends, also bumping into each other as they crossed at the net.\n\n\"He is not a gentleman,\" said Nalbandian. \"What he does is not good for tennis. His attitude speaks for itself.\"\n\nOn the incident Hewitt would only say: \"He brought it on himself a little. He sort of waited for a bit of a shoulder.\"\n\nHewitt will now play Andy Roddick in the semi-finals, the second seed enjoying another easy day when Nikolay Davydenko retired with breathing problems in the third set.\n\nRoddick, who was leading two sets to love and 4-1 at the time, has played just seven-and-a-half hours compared to 14-and-a-half for Hewitt, but Hewitt is confident he will be fit for their Friday evening clash.\n\n\"He has an advantage because he's in bed already but come Friday night I'll be ready to go,\" said Hewitt.\n\n\"A year ago on this day I lost and thank Christ I came away with a win tonight. I just kept hanging in there, it was always tough serving second in the fifth set.\n\n\"I told myself to give everything and in the end it paid off once again. Yet again the never-say-die attitude came out.\n\n\"It's a long way from holding that trophy up there but I'm hanging in there. Only four guys left can win and we're the top four in the world.\n\n\"It's set up for a pretty good showdown in the semis and finals.\"\n\nEarlier in the day Roddick's stroll through the championships continued when Davydenko indicated he was unable to continue in the stifling heat in Melbourne.\n\nThe Russian had received treatment on court during the second set, using an inhaler and wearing an ice vest during the change of ends as he seemingly struggled to catch his breath.\n\nHe surprisingly managed to break Roddick's serve on the resumption but eventually lost the set 7-5 and decided enough was enough after going two breaks down in the third set.\n\nDavydenko had beaten Britain's Tim Henman in the third round but admitted he may not have been able to continue against Guillermo Canas in the last 16 if he had not won in straight sets.\n\n\"I think about 3-3 all in the first set I started feeling something,\" he said.\n\nMen's singles quarter-finals: (3) Lleyton Hewitt (Aus) bt (9) David Nalbandian (Arg) 6-3 6-2 1-6 3-6 10-8, (2) Andy Roddick (USA) bt (26) Nikolay Davydenko (Rus) 6-3 7-5 4-1 ret.\n\nWOMEN'S SINGLES QUARTER-FINALS: (1) Lindsay Davenport (USA) bt (10) Alicia Molik (Aus) 6-4 4-6 9-7, (19) Nathalie Dechy (Fra) bt (12) Patty Schnyder (Swi) 5-7 6-1 7-5.\n\nMEN'S DOUBLES QUARTER-FINALS: (5) Wayne Black (Zim) & Kevin Ullyett (Zim) bt (3) Mahesh Bhupathi (Ind) & Todd Woodbridge (Aus) 7-6 (7-3) 6-3, (4) Jonas Bjorkman (Swe) & Max Mirnyi (Blr) bt (6) Michael Llodra (Fra) & Fabrice Santoro (Fra) 7-6 (7-2) 7-5.\n\nWOMEN'S DOUBLES SEMI-FINALS: (6) Svetlana Kuznetsova (Rus) & Alicia Molik (Aus) bt (7) Anastasia Myskina (Rus) & Vera Zvonareva (Rus) 6-2 6-3, (15) Lindsay Davenport (USA) & Corina Morariu (USA) bt Gabriela Navratilova (Cze) & Michaela Pastikova (Cze) 3-6 6-2 6-3.\n\nMIXED DOUBLES 2ND RD: (5) Bob Bryan (USA) & Vera Zvonareva (Rus) bt Frantisek Cermak (Cze) & Katarina Srebotnik (Slo) 6-3 6-2, (4) Kevin Ullyett (Zim) & Liezel Huber (Rsa) bt Yen-Hsun Lu (Tpe) & Nannan Liu (Chn) w/o.\n\nMIXED DOUBLES QUARTER-FINALS: Andy Ram (Isr) & Conchita Martinez (Spa) bt (1) Daniel Nestor (Can) & Rennae Stubbs (Aus) 7-5 6-7 (3-7) 7-6 (14-12), Scott Draper (Aus) & Samantha Stosur (Aus) bt Wayne Arthurs (Aus) & Trudi Musgrave (Aus) 6-2 7-6 (9-7)."
