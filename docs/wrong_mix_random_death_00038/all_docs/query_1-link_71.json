(Swipe)\n\n‘The horror was indescribable: He not only watched me, but could also see me naked!’, the report claims she said in the indictment. \n\nShe had originally reported Nalbandian to the police immediately, but a lack of evidence saw the charges dropped.\n\nHowever, Torrado and her lawyers persisted and showed audio recordings and messages which allegedly led to Nalbandian admitting to filming her. \n\nArgentine newspaper La Nacion report that in a voice message the former tennis star allegedly said: ‘Do you want me to be honest? Yes, I set up the camera. \n\n‘But I couldn’t see anything because there were internet problems.’\n\nThe report goes on to claim Nalbandian is now facing charges of stalking and sexual harassment, with the 41-year-old likely to be sued by his ex-partner if found guilty. \n\nNalbandian, 41, was one of the sport’s elite stars in the 2000s, rising to as high as world No. 3 in March 2006 \n\nHe won 11 singles tournaments and along with his appearance in the Wimbledon final 21 years ago when he lost in straight sets to Lleyton Hewitt. #brahadams\".",
