        "text": "Photograph by Jim Bartsch, courtesy of the Estate of Jerry Perenchio\n\nMedia scion Lachlan Murdoch reportedly paid $150 million for an estate in Los Angeles' Bel Air neighborhood, making it the most expensive home ever sold in the city.\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, Murdoch — the eldest son of media tycoon Rupert Murdoch — is the buyer of the 10-acre estate being sold by the estate of the late A. Jerrold Perenchio. Perenchio, who died in 2017, was the chairman and CEO of Univision.\n\nThe estate, known as Chartwell, has a storied history. Its exterior was used in the credits of \"The Beverly Hillbillies\" TV series. It was built in the 1930s and later owned by Chicago hotelier Arnold Kirkeby. Perenchio bought it in 1986 for $14 million and over time, added three adjacent parcels of land. In 2016, he acquired the neighboring former home of Ronald and Nancy Reagan, which is also included in the Murdoch sale.\n\nThe estate had originally been listed for $350 million, but got a price cut to $195 million in August .\n\nPhotograph by Jim Bartsch, courtesy of the Estate of Jerry Perenchio\n\nThe property's 25,000-square-foot main residence has 11 bedrooms, 18 bathrooms and a limestone facade. If the exterior looks familiar, that's because it was used in \"The Beverly Hillbillies,\" a TV series that aired from 1962 to 1971, as the Clampetts' mansion. The original home was designed by Los Angeles architect Sumner Spaulding and completed in 1935.\n\nShortly after acquiring Chartwell in 1986, Perenchio did a complete gut renovation of the interiors that took five years to complete. During that time, he also extended the property's footprint to more than 10 acres by purchasing and combining three neighboring lots. One of those lots included a home that Perenchio converted into Chartwell's 5,700-square-foot guest house, a second was demolished to make room for a driveway, and a third was bulldozed to become a grassy helipad.\n\nPhotograph by Jim Bartsch, courtesy of the Estate of Jerry Perenchio\n\nThe media mogul adorned his main residence with rare European furniture and antiques he collected over the years, including his private art collection worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The collection was bequeathed to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art upon his death.\n\nHe also constructed some significant modern additions to the property.\n\nThe main residence\n\nPhotograph by Jim Bartsch, courtesy of the Estate of Jerry Perenchio\n\nPast the iron gates of 875 Nimes Road is a winding driveway bordered by lush greenery that leads visitors to the iconic entrance of the main residence.\n\nPhotograph by Jim Bartsch, courtesy of the Estate of Jerry Perenchio\n\nThrough the front doors and past the main entry is an expansive living room, designed by late French interior designer Henri Samuel. Samuel renovated all rooms in the home in the late 1980s.\n\nPhotograph by Jim Bartsch, courtesy of the Estate of Jerry Perenchio\n\nPhotograph by Jim Bartsch, courtesy of the Estate of Jerry Perenchio\n\nThe main living area has spectacular views of the backyard, including sights of estate's grand fountain bordered by an allee of trees.\n\nPhotograph by Jim Bartsch, courtesy of the Estate of Jerry Perenchio\n\nPhotograph by Jim Bartsch, courtesy of the Estate of Jerry Perenchio\n\nThe estate's master bedroom and dressing area also have the same breathtaking views of the landscape below.\n\nPhotograph by Jim Bartsch, courtesy of the Estate of Jerry Perenchio\n\nPhotograph by Jim Bartsch, courtesy of the Estate of Jerry Perenchio\n\nPhotograph by Jim Bartsch, courtesy of the Estate of Jerry Perenchio\n\nThe estate's formal dining room — with seating for 18 — has paneled walls imported from Europe and date to the mid-1700s.\n\nPhotograph by Jim Bartsch, courtesy of the Estate of Jerry Perenchio\n\nThe \"morning room\" has a mint-green vaulted lattice ceiling that was constructed in Paris, shipped in sections, and reassembled inside the room. The curtains identically match the floral wallpaper.\n\nPhotograph by Jim Bartsch, courtesy of the Estate of Jerry Perenchio\n\nOn the opposite end of the main level is the \"garden room.\" On the walls are five black-and-gold Japanese lacquer panels inlaid with mother of pearl.\n\nPhotograph by Jim Bartsch, courtesy of the Estate of Jerry Perenchio\n\nGary Gold, one of the listing agents from Hilton & Hyland, said Perenchio loved to entertain. One level below the main living room is a ballroom where he hosted big events.\n\n\"The owner knew how to throw a party. And in [here], he loved a surprise,\" Gold said.\n\nPhotograph by Jim Bartsch, courtesy of the Estate of Jerry Perenchio\n\nWith the press of a remote control button, a pair of motorized Asian screens split open to reveal a grand piano on a stage.\n\nPhotograph by Jim Bartsch, courtesy of the Estate of Jerry Perenchio\n\n\"Now, I'm not going to drop names, but on this very stage, Mr. Perenchio would have A-list performers who were used to playing in arenas, playing here for an intimate gathering of a hundred guests,\" said Gold.\n\nSteps away from the performance area is the billiard room.\n\nPhotograph by Jim Bartsch, courtesy of the Estate of Jerry Perenchio\n\nAn avid wine collector, Perenchio built a climate-controlled wine cellar that holds as many as 12,000 bottles. (His wine collection later sold in two separate Sotheby's auctions — one in March 2018 and the other in May 2018 — for just under $12 million.)\n\nPhotograph by Jim Bartsch, courtesy of the Estate of Jerry Perenchio\n\nThe secret tunnels\n\nBuried underneath the main residence is a subterranean level that dates to 1935. This lower level is accessible by elevator. It opens into two tunnels that lead to different areas of the estate.\n\nThe late Italian opera singer Luciano Pavarotti, who was a friend and a frequent guest, would often come down to these tunnels to practice because the acoustics were so great, Gold said.\n\nOne of the tunnels leads to the estate's 75-foot swimming pool and pool house.\n\nPhotograph by Jim Bartsch, courtesy of the Estate of Jerry Perenchio\n\nThe other tunnel delivers visitors out of a colossal stone head and into acres of private gardens, grottos and ponds filled with koi fish.\n\nThe gardens\n\nPerenchio poured millions of dollars into the 10-acre compound's gardens and landscaping, and his passion for horticulture is still apparent.\n\nPhotograph by Jim Bartsch, courtesy of the Estate of Jerry Perenchio\n\nWhen visitors drive up the perimeter of the property on Bel Air Road, they are greeted by perfectly sculpted gumdrop trees in front of a stone wall.\n\nHidden underneath the estate's rose garden is a motor court Perenchio built for when he had visitors.\n\nPhotograph by Jim Bartsch, courtesy of the Estate of Jerry Perenchio\n\nThe parking structure can hold up to 40 cars.\n\nPhotograph by Jim Bartsch, courtesy of the Estate of Jerry Perenchio\n\nPhotograph by Jim Bartsch, courtesy of the Estate of Jerry Perenchio\n\nThere's also a vegetable garden.\n\nPhotograph by Jim Bartsch, courtesy of the Estate of Jerry Perenchio\n\nBut perhaps the most unique landscaping feature the billionaire created was his private redwood grove.\n\nPerenchio admired the redwoods found mostly in Northern California so much that he shipped in dozens of trees to Chartwell. The trees now lend shade to the estate's meandering bridle paths.\n\nPhotograph by Jim Bartsch, courtesy of the Estate of Jerry Perenchio\n\n\"Not only is there nothing like this in Los Angeles, I don't think there's anything like this in the country,\" said Gold.\n\nChartwell Estate originally hit the market for $350 million in 2017. One year later, the price was reduced to $245 million. Then, it was lowered to $195 million, furniture not included.\n\nGold is one of eight platinum triangle real estate agents representing the mega-listing, along with Jeff Hyland and Drew Fenton of Hilton & Hyland; Jade Mills, Joyce Rey and Alexandra Allen of Coldwell Banker Global Luxury; and Drew Gitlin and Susan Gitlin of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices.\n\n—CNBC's Ray Parisi contributed to this report."
