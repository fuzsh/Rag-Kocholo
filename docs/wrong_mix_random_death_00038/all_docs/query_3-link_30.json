        "text": "Paris: US star Andy Roddick reached the quarterfinals of the Paris Masters on Thursday and in so doing clinched his season-ending Shanghai Masters Cup berth, beating Gilles Simon of France 6-3, 7-5. Simon stood eighth in the ATP Race going into Thursday’s match but realistically needed to win as James Blake of the United States and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga are breathing down his neck. Argentine eighth seed and title-holder David Nalbandian earlier thrashed his ninth-seeded Davis Cup teammate Juan Martin Del Potro 6-4, 6-0 to become the first quarterfinalist at the Paris Masters.\n\nWith his loss to Nalbandian, Del Potro, suffering from a broken toenail, now must sweat on joining Roddick in China.\n\nThe rising star is seventh in the ATP Race but could slide out of the eight-man field depending on other results here.\n\n“I don’t like playing against friends or Argentinian players - it’s tough,” said a crestfallen Del Potro. “David did a great match. I don’t know if I’ll play Shanghai - I’m not qualified yet. “At least if I don’t I have the Davis Cup for sure - and that gives me plenty of motivation.”\n\ntop seeds through\n\nOn Wednesday, Top-ranked Rafael Nadal, the man he usurped as world number one, Roger Federer, and pretender Andy Murray all marched into the last 16 with straight sets wins. French Open, Wimbledon and Olympic champion Nadal knocked Federer off his perch in August after the Swiss had spent a record 239 weeks at the top of the heap and looked fresh as he swept past unseeded Frenchman Florent Serra 6-2, 6-4.\n\nFederer looked rustier in winning 6-4, 7-6 (9/7) against Swede Robin Soderling - a man he has now beaten eight times in as many meetings, while Murray was little troubled by modest US hope Sam Querrey as he steamed through 6-2, 6-4 to book a meeting with Spaniard 15th seed Fernando Verdasco. Nadal, who has won a tour-leading eight titles in 2008, was never in danger against a man he has now beaten three times this year for the loss of just 11 games.\n\nBut Federer had to sweat in a second-set tiebreak against Soderling, who threw away two set points before the Swiss won through to a match with unseeded Croatian Marin Cilic. “I think I did well, served well,” Federer said. “I’m not giving away any really easy points.”\n\nFeisty Scot Murray is still on course to become the first man to win three straight Masters events after he blitzed Querrey. After a bright start Murray, who triumphed in Cincinnati and Madrid, conceded his serve in the eighth game of the second set but broke straight back.\n\nHe then flunked three match points but stormed the net to put away a volley at the fourth time of asking. “I was a bit disappointed to lose my serve - but the way I responded was pretty good,” said the 21-year-old from Dunblane. Also advancing was US 11th seed James Blake, who can still squeeze into the Shanghai Masters Cup after defeating Italian Simone Bolelli 6-7 (8/10), 6-3, 6-4.\n\nPaes, Bhupathi ousted\n\nLeander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi crashed out of the doubles event after suffering straight-set defeats along with their respective partners in the second round encounter here. The third seed Indo-Czech pair, who got a first round bye, lost to their Brazilian opponents Marcelo Melo and Andre Spa 3-6, 2-6 in a little over one-hour contest to crash out of the penultimate tournament of the season.\n\nPaes and Dlouhy squandered two breakpoints each in both the sets while their rivals broke them thrice out of 12 chances in the match.\n\nThe fourth seeded pair of Bhupathi and his Bahamian partner Mark Knowles lost their second round match 4-6, 2-6 to Juan Monaco of Brazil and Rafael Nadal of Spain.\n\nPrakash crashes out\n\nNew Delhi: India’s Prakash Amritraj crashed out in the first round of USD 50,000 ATP Challenger event in Louisville, USA. Amritraj squandered a set lead to lose 7-6 (2), 3-6, 2-6 to Sam Warburg of US in the opening round of the hard court event.\n\nMeanwhile, Stephen Amritraj and his American partner Donald Young defeated wild card entrants Bruno Agostinelli of Canada and American Bradley Cox 6-4, 6-4 to enter the quarterfinals of the doubles event.\n\nPetrova in quarters\n\nQuebec City: Top-seeded Russian Nadia Petrova advanced to the quarterfinals of the 175,000-dollar Bell Challenge WTA tennis tournament on Wednesday with a straight-sets win over Varvara Lepchenko.\n\nPetrova, a former world No.3 who is currently ranked 11th in the world, beat the American qualifier 6-2, 6-4 to stay on course for a ninth career title.\n\nShe next faces Hungarian Melinda Czink, who defeated 2007 semifinalist Julie Ditty of the United States 6-1, 6-1.\n\nAmerican Melanie Oudin, who ousted second-seeded Austrian Sybille Bammer in the first round, kept up her winning ways with a 6-1, 7-6 (7/3) victory over Olga Puchkova of Russia. Oudin will face sixth-seeded compatriot Bethanie Mattek of the United States, who booked her quarterfinal berth despite a spirited challenge from Canadian wildcard Valerie Tetreault."
