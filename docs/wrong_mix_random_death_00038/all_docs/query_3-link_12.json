        "text": "\"After the last couple of weeks I've had, I am so happy to win,\" he said. \"I got a bit lucky at the end but I went for it and sometimes you make your own luck.\"\n\nThe luck referred to an outrageous dead net cord he got to break serve for 6-5 in the final set but having broken, he still needed to save two break-back points before serving out for victory and a place in round three.\n\n\"The last two weeks have been tough,\" Murray continued, having missed last week's Madrid Masters because of a back injury.\n\n\"Sometimes when you haven't hit that many balls, you don't necessarily feel that comfortable. So when you do get through, you feel that much better.\n\n\"It's like Roger [Federer] in his first match in Madrid last week when he won 7-6 in the third [against Milos Raonic] then he went on to win the title.\n\n\"Sometimes that's how it happens then you get better. So, hopefully, I can go on from here and do well because it's important to get more matches this week.\"\n\nMurray said he had yet to open any presents from his support team but if he thought he was going to get a gift from Nalbandian, he was disappointed.\n\nThe first set was easy as Nalbandian struggled in the wind and dipping sun but the Argentine, now ranked 42 but once as high as No.3, is no mug on clay and worked his way back with a series of brilliant drop shots.\n\nMurray was scrambling in vain for much of the time and when he dropped serve to give Nalbandian a 3-1 lead in the decider, he looked beaten.\n\nHowever, we ought to have known better than to write off Murray and the Scot broke back immediately then rode his luck at the end to clinch a match against either Frenchman Richard Gasquet or Paolo Lorenzi, the Italian qualifier, tomorrow.\n\n\"Getting the break back immediately was the key,\" Murray said. \"He is an exceptional player and we were both playing well at the end. It was a physical match.\"\n\nNovak Djokovic, who beat Murray in the semi-finals here last year, began his title bid in style with a 6-3, 6-3 win over Australian Bernard Tomic.\n\nFederer, fresh from his win in Madrid last week, and Rafael Nadal, chasing a third clay-court title of the year, both start their campaigns today."
