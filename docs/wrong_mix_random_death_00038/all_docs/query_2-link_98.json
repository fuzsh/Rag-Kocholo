        "text": "From Elisa Lam to Richard Ramirez, the Cecil Hotel's history has been filled with bizarre horrors since it was built in 1924.\n\nNestled within the busy streets of downtown Los Angeles lies one of the most infamous buildings in horror lore: the Cecil Hotel.\n\nSince it was built in 1924, the Cecil Hotel has been plagued by unfortunate and mysterious circumstances that have given it a perhaps unparalleled reputation for the macabre. At least 16 different murders, suicides, and unexplained paranormal events have taken place at the hotel — and it’s even served as the temporary home of some of America’s most notorious serial killers.\n\nThis is the eerie history of Los Angeles’ Cecil Hotel.\n\nThe Grand Opening Of The Cecil Hotel\n\nThe Cecil Hotel was built in 1924 by hotelier William Banks Hanner. It was supposed to be a destination hotel for international businessmen and social elites. Hanner spent $1 million on the 700-room Beaux Arts-style hotel, complete with a marble lobby, stained-glass windows, palm trees, and an opulent staircase.\n\nBut Hanner would come to regret his investment. Just two years after the Cecil Hotel opened, the world was thrown into the Great Depression — and Los Angeles was not immune to the economic collapse. Soon enough, the area surrounding the Cecil Hotel would be dubbed “Skid Row” and become home to thousands of homeless people.\n\nThe once beautiful hotel soon gained a reputation as a meeting place for junkies, runaways, and criminals. Worse yet, the Cecil Hotel ultimately earned a reputation for violence and death.\n\nSuicide And Homicide At “The Most Haunted Hotel In Los Angeles”\n\nIn the 1930s alone, the Cecil Hotel was home to at least six reported suicides. A few residents ingested poison, while others shot themselves, slit their own throats, or jumped out their bedroom windows.\n\nIn 1934, for example, Army Sergeant Louis D. Borden slashed his throat with a razor. Less than four years later, Roy Thompson of the Marine Corps jumped from atop the Cecil Hotel and was found on the skylight of a neighboring building.\n\nThe next few decades only saw more violent deaths.\n\nIn September 1944, 19-year-old Dorothy Jean Purcell awoke in the middle of the night with stomach pains while she was staying at the Cecil with Ben Levine, 38. She went to the bathroom so as not to disturb a sleeping Levine, and — to her complete shock — gave birth to a baby boy. She had no idea she had been pregnant.\n\nMistakenly thinking her newborn was dead, Purcell threw her live baby out the window and onto the roof of the building next door. At her trial, she was found not guilty of murder by reason of insanity and she was admitted to a hospital for psychiatric treatment.\n\nIn 1962, 65-year-old George Giannini was walking by the Cecil with his hands in his pockets when he was struck to death by a falling woman. Pauline Otton, 27, jumped from her ninth-floor window after an argument with her estranged husband, Dewey. Her fall killed both her and Giannini instantly.\n\nPolice initially thought the two had committed suicide together but reconsidered when they found Giannini was still wearing shoes. If he had jumped, his shoes would have fallen off mid-flight.\n\nIn light of the suicides, mishaps, and murders, Angelinos promptly dubbed the Cecil “the most haunted hotel in Los Angeles.”\n\nA Serial Killer’s Paradise\n\nWhile tragic calamities and suicide have contributed heavily to the hotel’s body count, the Cecil Hotel has also served as a temporary home for some of the grisliest murderers in American history.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Richard Ramirez — murderer of 13 people and better known as the “Night Stalker” — lived in a room on the top floor of the hotel during much of his horrific killing spree.\n\nAfter killing someone, he would throw his bloody clothes into the Cecil Hotel’s dumpster and saunter into the hotel lobby either completely naked or only in underwear — “none of which would have raised an eyebrow,” writes journalist Josh Dean, “since the Cecil in the 1980s… ‘was total, unmitigated chaos.'”\n\nAt the time, Ramirez was able to stay there for a mere $14 per night. And with corpses of junkies reportedly often found in the alleys near the hotel and sometimes even in the hallways, Ramirez’s blood-soaked lifestyle surely raised nary an eyebrow at the Cecil.\n\nIn 1991, Austrian serial killer Jack Unterweger — who strangled prostitutes with their own bras — also called the hotel home. Rumor has it that he chose the hotel because of its connection to Ramirez.\n\nBecause the area around the Cecil Hotel was popular with prostitutes, Unterweger stalked these environs time and again in search of victims. One prostitute he is believed to have killed vanished right down the street from the hotel while Unterweger even claimed to have “dated” the hotel’s receptionist.\n\nEerie Cold Cases At The Cecil Hotel\n\nAnd while some episodes of violence in and around the Cecil Hotel are attributable to known serial killers, some murders have remained unsolved.\n\nTo pick one of many, a local woman known around the area named Goldie Osgood was found dead in her ransacked room at the Cecil. She had been raped before suffering a fatal stabbing and beating. Though one suspect was found walking with bloodstained clothing nearby, he was later cleared and her killer was never convicted — another instance of disturbing violence at the Cecil that has gone unresolved.\n\nAnother grimly noteworthy guest of the hotel was Elizabeth Short, who came to be known as the “Black Dahlia” after her 1947 murder in Los Angeles.\n\nShe reportedly stayed at the hotel just before her mutilation, which remains unsolved, despite a wealth of Black Dahlia suspects, including an especially promising one named George Hodel. What connection her death may have had to the Cecil is not known, but what is known is that she was found on a street not far away on the morning of January 15 with her mouth carved ear to ear and her body cut in two.\n\nSuch stories of violence are not simply a thing of the past. Decades after Short, one of the most mysterious deaths ever to take place at the Cecil Hotel happened as recently as 2013.\n\nIn 2013, Canadian college student Elisa Lam was found dead inside the water tank on the roof of the hotel three weeks after she had gone missing. Her naked corpse was found after hotel guests had complained of bad water pressure and a “funny taste” to the water. Though authorities ruled her death as an accidental drowning, critics believed otherwise.\n\nBefore her death, surveillance cameras caught Lam acting strangely in an elevator, at times appearing to yell at someone out of view, as well as apparently attempting to hide from someone while pressing multiple elevator buttons and waving her arms erratically.\n\nHistory Uncovered Podcast\n\nEpisode 17: The Disturbing Death Of Elisa Lam\n\nWhen Elisa Lam was found inexplicably dead in February 2013, investigators were baffled — then the security footage taken just before she vanished only made things stranger.\n\nAfter the video surfaced publicly, many people began to believe that the rumors of the hotel being haunted might be true. Horror aficionados began drawing parallels between the Black Dahlia murder and Lam’s disappearance, pointing out that both women were in their twenties, traveling alone from L.A. to San Diego, last seen at the Cecil Hotel, and were missing for several days before their bodies were found.\n\nThin though these connections may sound, the hotel has nevertheless developed a reputation for horror that defines its legacy to this day.\n\nThe Cecil Hotel Today\n\nThe last body was found at the Cecil Hotel in 2015 — a man who reportedly committed suicide — and ghost stories and rumors of the hotel’s haunting swirled once more. The hotel even subsequently served as the chilling inspiration for a season of American Horror Story about a hotel that’s home to unimaginable murder and mayhem.\n\nBut in 2011, the Cecil attempted to shake off its macabre history by rebranding itself as the Stay On Main Hotel and Hostel, a $75-per-night budget hotel for tourists. Several years later, New York City developers signed a 99-year lease and began gut-renovating the building to include an upscale boutique hotel and hundreds of fully furnished micro-units in keeping with the surging co-living craze.\n\nPerhaps with enough renovations, the Cecil Hotel can finally shake its reputation for all things bloody and eerie that has defined the ill-fated building for the better part of a century."
