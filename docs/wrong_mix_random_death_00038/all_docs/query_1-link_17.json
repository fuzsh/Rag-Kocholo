        "text": "Former tennis star David Nalbandian cheated this weekend after his rally car rolled twice during an event in his native Argentina.\n\nThe 34-year-old, an ex-Wimbledon finalist and world number three at the height of his career, lost control of his vehicle during a national competition yesterday.\n\nFootage taken by spectators showed his Chevrolet Agile rolling twice before ending up on its side.\n\nHe and his co-driver were helped out of the battered car by fans who at first feared the worst.\n\nMiraculously, both were unhurt.\n\nNalbandian, runner-up at the 2002 Wimbledon final to Lleyton Hewitt, was reunited with his family soon after and boasted later in the day he was relaxing in a swimming pool with his daughter.\n\nThe former tennis player decided to try his hand at rally driving after retiring from tennis in 2013.\n\nThe dramatic crash happened in San Justo in the province of Entre Rios around 200 miles from the Argentinian capital Buenos Aires.\n\nHe was taking part in the Copa Maxi Rally, part of the national rally calendar.\n\nSpeaking earlier this year of his decision to test himself as the wheel, he said: “Tennis was my job and racing is a hobby. It’s very different.\n\n\"I don’t have pressure here. I am learning and trying to do my best but not as a professional.”\n\nHe walked away from a spectacular crash in April last year in which his car was also left a write-off after flipping several times.\n\nNalbandian turned professional aged 18 and is the only Argentinian tennis player in history who ever reached the semi-finals or better at all four Grand Slam tournaments.\n\nHe announced his retirement on October 1 2013 after a shoulder op sidelined him for much of the season.\n\nHe famously landed a line judge in hospital in the final of the Aegon Championships at the Queen’s Club in London in 2012 after kicking an advertising board which struck him on the shin.\n\nHe ended up forfeiting his prize money and being docked an additional 150 ranking points by the ATP."
