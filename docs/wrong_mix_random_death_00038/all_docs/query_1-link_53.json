        "text": "Wimbledon finalist David Nalbandian is being sued by his model ex-girlfriend for sexual harassment and stalking after allegedly installing hidden cameras in the apartment they shared in Italy.\n\nThe Sun reports Araceli Torrado, 29, made the complaint against her former partner Nalbandian, 41, accompanying it with a video in which she discovers a camera allegedly set up by the Argentinian.\n\nThe installation of the camera, which a judge ruled was placed there by Nalbandian, is not a crime as the apartment was shared by the couple.\n\nBut Torrado, 29, is now suing him for harassment and stalking after their split.\n\nAs reported by C5N, Nalbandian has admitted to installing the device, saying in a voice memo: “What matters to me is that I’m okay with you, I want to find a way for us to get back together.\n\n“Do you want me to be honest? Yes, it was me. I was never able to watch anything because of the internet. I cannot see it.\n\n“If you want to sleep with someone, you’re welcome any day, any time.”\n\nTorrado responded on social media on Wednesday, posting: “In light of the questions I receive about the events of which I was a victim and whose author was David Nalbandian, I want to inform you that I am filing a criminal case and the corresponding civil legal proceedings. thanks for the support.”\n\nNalbandian achieved a career-high ranking of World No. 3.\n\nHe reached the Wimbledon final in 2002, losing in straight sets to Lleyton Hewitt.\n\nHe also made two French Open semi-finals, as well as the last four at the Australian Open and US Open.\n\nNalbandian announced his retirement in 2013 following an operation on his right shoulder.\n\nHe has continued to compete in sport through taking up rally driving and made one appearance in the World Rally Championship.\n\nIn 2021, he became the coach for Serbian tennis player Miomir Kecmanovic."
