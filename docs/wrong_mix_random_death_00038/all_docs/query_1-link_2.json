        "text": "DAVID NALBANDIAN cheated death after a massive crash as he raced his rally car in Argentina.\n\nThe tennis star - a former world No 3 and Wimbledon finalist - somehow walked away from the huge accident.\n\nSpectator footage shows how the 34-year-old, who quit tennis in 2013 because of injury, flipping over twice and ending up on his side after losing control in San Justo, 200 miles from Buenos Aires.\n\nHe and his co-driver were helped out of the destroyed Chevrolet Agile by fans but somehow both were unhurt.\n\nThe runner-up at the 2002 Wimbledon final later revealed he was able to go swimming with his daughter after being reunited with his family.\n\nNalbandian turned to rallying after his retirement.\n\nSpeaking earlier this year, he said: \"Tennis was my job and racing is a hobby. It’s very different. I don’t have pressure here.\n\n\"I am learning and trying to do my best but not as a professional.\"\n\nIt's not the first time Nalbandian has cheated death - he walked away from a similarly spectacular crash in April last year.\n\nHis car was left a write-off after flipping several times.\n\nNalbandian is the only Argentine player in history to have been to at least the semi-finals of all four Grand Slam tournaments."
