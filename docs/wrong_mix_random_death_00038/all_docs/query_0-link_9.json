Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nI would just say go and look at this guide, and see what it says about color issues.SaysWhoWhatWhenWhereWhyHow? (talk)\n\nIf it goes for the symbols than we got two choice : transform every ATP tour tables to use symbols instead of colors OR make that new table match the already existing ones (I vote for the latter as the ATP scoreboards worked just fine until now). If you linked it for the colors (I really don't know what was your purpose to embed it) what you've posted is acceptable for me. Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nI'm not really excited with the colors or the complexity of the chart for novices. Too harsh imho, especially the pink. If the colors scattered throughout an article are too bright or have too much contrast the article starts to take on the look of a coloring book which drives the eyes to the colors more than the well written prose or information in those charts. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nBut introducing a symbol-based outlook along with the color-coded ATP-tour tables will unnecessarily force the leader to learn a new abbreviations key while the only thing he did is scrolling down from the previous table. As for the colors : what do you think of the original ones (the link in the first sentence below the header)? Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nWP:ACCESS reasons each color in a table needs to be accompanied by a symbol so that it isn't the only thing distinguishing the information. Afro (Talk)\n\nAt least move it to the Rubber coloumn. It still looks superfluous to me though. Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nThe symbol usually goes after the name or number, which in this case it is the number in the rubber column. This goes by the policy, so I don't recognize or get what is so superfluous about this if we are in fact actually following Wikipedia policy.SaysWhoWhatWhenWhereWhyHow? (talk)\n\nIt is simply practicism and functionality : The ATP scoreboards worked fine with the colors for years not even one reader complaining about its comprehensiveness. It is the same table (just for the Davis Cup) or otherwise following this logic we can jump back to Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Tennis#Colors of tournament categories in ITF articles and Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Tennis#WTA color schemes and attribute them with random characters as well, which I will also find superfluous (I can easily do so since it's my opinion). The guidelines are suggestions not orders, so if an article works fine with colors it isn't a must to raid it with a symbol hailstorm. Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nActually is says \"do not use colored TEXT unless its status is also indicated using another method such as an accessible symbol matched to a legend.\" Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nOk I'll apply the new colors but if anything other sides with the symbols apart from the guidelines (which is obiously not the case here) I will omit them unless a horde of complaints flow in saying the colors are confusing) Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nI changed it it this version (see above) Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nTo correct Fyunck it says \"Ensure that color is not the only way used to convey important information. Especially, do not use colored text unless its status is also indicated using another method such as an accessible symbol matched to a legend, or footnote labels.\" Afro (Talk)\n\nYou didn't correct me you simply added the ambiguous part of the sentence. Colored text you need symbols... colored anything else will depend on its importance which, because this is wikipedia, will have to be argued about endlessly lol. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nI am posting the full Wikipedia guide to using color and making it identifiable \"Ensure that color is not the only way used to convey important information. Especially, do not use colored text unless its status is also indicated using another method such as an accessible symbol matched to a legend, or footnote labels. Otherwise, blind users or readers accessing Wikipedia through a printout or device without a color screen will not receive that information.\" Did you all read it! It says the Davis Cup chart is not made to Wikipedia policy, which means it must adhere to the policy.SaysWhoWhatWhenWhereWhyHow? (talk)\n\nRight. I've expanded the table with a special column for handicapped readers or printer, fax machine, scanner users. Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nGood, I like the column to the left that you did! I did not see that in the previous revision, so what you have going on right now is good. Thanks, for addressing my point(s) of consideration.SaysWhoWhatWhenWhereWhyHow? (talk)\n\nBut once again, color can be used in minor information without the need for symbols. I'm not saying this chart in particular but if let's say some chart uses color to signify whether a player is left or right handed that is not important information and would not need anything but the color. Or one could say a few words in prose after the chart saying something like \"the years 1968-1972, 1978-1979, and 1990\" were played in Michigan, but have the chart show that in blue with no symbols at all. Just so we're on the same page here.\n\nAnd in looking at the chart I do notice the incorrect nomenclature for showing the tiebreak score. Remember it's not 7â€“66, it's 7â€“6(8â€“6), as vetted out here awhile back. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nI might miss that then but is this apply for all the articles? Just for intance 2011 ATP World Tour still uses the one-number formula. Can you link the aforementioned discussion here for me please? Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nAll articles, it's just a slow process of converting the ones that don't follow protocol. The discussion was at [[11]]. Wikiproject synthesized the agreement and has it listed at [[12]], however I was under the impression it was agreed at with brackets around the tiebreak so my bad there, and I know that &ndash has been supplanted by simply using the ndash character \"â€“\". Hope that helps. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nThank you. I'll follow that in the future. Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nExample 2\n\nWe already have this on Nadal's Rafael Nadal career statistics#ITF Davis Cup subpage. I don't know what the colors are for in this piece. Any ideas on this compared to the above one?

Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nI picked the third one and will inculde it in the article guideline as well. If anyone oppose to this let me know. Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nI haven't seen any guidance regarding whether or not rankings should be bold, as seen in this example with \"World No. 65\" and \"No. 65\". Is anybody aware of any prior discussion about this? If not, can we establish what should be done about ranking numbers? â€”LOL T/C\n\nBold text should be used in conformance with WP:MOSBOLD. I see no good reason that prose should be bold in these cases. The Rambling Man (talk)\n\nNo, no, no. That's really unnecessary. Definitely not in prose and to bold the highest ranking in the infobox is just illogic considering that the \"Highest\" is always is the most achievable ranking no need to further highlight it (it is placed next to the current ranking so it's quite obvious that is is his best - if not equal). Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nI 100% agree with my fellow editors. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nMe too (Gabinho>:) )\n\nI think you all have come to the appropriate conclusion on this matter, no further opinion needed by me!SaysWhoWhatWhenWhereWhyHow? (talk)\n\nIt's quite usual trhoughout the tennis biographies : I accidently ran into one recently and changed it back to normal and I encourage everyone to do it as well, if they'll come upon one. Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nI've noticed that the project article guideline page has a separate section for coaches (and a dead template for it). So I've arbitrarily expanded the notability criteria for them. I would happily accept comment from you on this:\n\nIf it's a coach :\n\nSince these are very rare article types, the most common case is when a player chose coaching after retirement. In all other cases reveal the coach's background to see if he/she notable. It is important as it could easily happen that a child player is coached by a non-proffessional or non-tennis-affiliated relative and cotton to him during his career (see Toni Nadal). The minimum requirement that can obviously qualify without doubt for coaches of players are:\n\nThe player has reached the final of or won one of the major professional tournaments.\n\nThe player has entered to ATP top 10 for a week at least.\n\nThe player was member of a champion team competing in a Davis Cup, Fed Cup, Hopman Cup (reserve players and team captains don't count).\n\nThe player won and reached the final of another ATP Masters 1000 event.\n\nThese also ensure that the notability of one-hit wonders' coaches doesn't automatically granted with his/her coachee's success. (See Roberto Carretero for example) This guideline applies equally to singles and doubles players. Junior players' coaches are to be omitted otherwise it has to be shown to meet the wider requirements of WP:GNG. Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nAlthough I'm a bit sceptical on coaches' role in Wikipedia (if they have any in tennis), but there must be a line drawn. The above \"rule\" still allows the creation of Dick Hordorff (some sources list him Dirk Hordorff [13]), who is currently coaching Janko Tipsaeric (Davis Cup champion). The main thing is that the problem would still exits if I changed the rule to \"multiple terms must be fulfilled the same time\" as he was also Rainer SchÃ¼ttler's coach when he entered to the top 10 (and became a major finalist). So I'm really out of bullets on this topic. Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nIf it would be a \"three-players-rule\" he would be still in : He is coaching/managing Olivier Marach (top 8 in doubles) [14]. Maybe my ideas are not enough to sort out or is he truly notable (I must note that he is also the president of the Hessian Tennis Association)?Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nI've created a template for them. Please take a look : {{Infobox Tennis Coach biography}}. Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nLooks good. I would suggest a player/coach box as well. Just use the existing tennis bio and your coach bio temp and merge them together. Obviously removing certain bits. KnowIG (talk)\n\nWouldn't it be too long? I saw articles with multiple different biography templates in case a player changed profession. Like in Bob Sapp. So if he/she starts to coach then a new section is dedicated to it within his Career and an infobox could be placed there. Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nIt most certainly would take up less space than the example you've shown. For example benefits, no need to write personal info twice, in different boxes. So no personally it wouldn't be too long. KnowIG (talk)\n\nI definitely feel the need for a solution as most of tennis players become coaches by time. As you can see the current coach infobox has a section for the coaches' active years. What about expanding that further with optional parameters? What would you require to have in it? Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nThat's what I was implying. Simple soultion just merge the tennis player box with the coach box. KnowIG (talk)\n\nCopy here from Template:Infobox_tennis_biography/doc#Usage what lines do you prefer to have in the merged version and I cut it into the current coach infobox. Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nAll of it cause Annacone, Cahill and Gilbert, all of that box is applicable to them. KnowIG (talk)\n\nI've updated Paul Annacone#As a coach. Is it really that bad? Give it a try. Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\n(also I can easily transform it to have a collapsible parameter so it won't appear on the page unless the reader clicks \"Show\". Just for cases when two infoboxes are present). Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nIt's good but IMO only works for Annacone, because it's got a separate coach section and player and coach prose is big enough for it to fit nicely. On Gilbert and Cahill I don't think there are separate sections which are big enough. Could get messy IMO. Refinement maybe needed as I think that collaspable although a good solution is not the best way to go, but if you do an example then we can evaluate the viablity of it. KnowIG (talk)\n\nOk. I'm done. You can test it on Template:Infobox Tennis Coach biography/doc#Example. Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nCould work with a minor change. I will point out that the change is nothing to do with the template. I'll try it on Gullickson later. KnowIG (talk)\n\nI've added it to Galo Blanco as well. Try to spread it through Wiki. Thank you for helping me out with that . Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nRecently updated Zoltan Kuharszky and planning to do Marian Vajda but I was wondering that we should compile a list of articles needing coach infobox to gather a task force for that. I presume there are far more coach-oriented articles, than I first thought. Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nHave a look at this Tim Gullikson all personal detail removed to avoid repitition with box above :) KnowIG (talk)\n\nDid you leave the Paul Annacone coaching career in it? Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nFraid so. Don't know enough about poor Tim and Pete to be definative. Should go and get so bios and check it out lol KnowIG (talk)\n\nNo prob . Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nSome of these people are more notable as coaches than as players, and also their article is expandable with prose based on it: Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nObserving the recent discussions here I came to the decision we might update the Wikipedia:WikiProject Tennis/Article Guidelines as it contains various obsolete information and it should be also expanded a bit more regarding scores, colors , rankings, notability and other fixes. For example even the example articles don't follow the tiebreak upper index directives (2008 Queen's Club Championships â€“ Singles under the Draws section) and it offers a template for coaches that has been already deleted...\n\nThe example for a perfect(?) player article shows Pete Sampras' though his highest ranking is in bold within its infobox, which is unnecessary. I found three bolded rankings in biography pages just today (not counting Sampras') by randomly browsing through player's articles so it has to be definitely included in the guidelines. I would also add an example infobox to show how it should look next to the player infobox section and some more FAQ on free pictures (linked to the appropriate WP Help page).\n\nThe colors principles (for color-blinded people and monochrome monitor or black and white printer users) are omitted in all ATP titles/runner-ups tables. I guess it all could had been prevented if it has been an example table in it. Also if we can agree in a Davis Cup pattern I would also recommend indicating it in a separate section as well.\n\nThe notability criteria for tennis players is also needed (it is easily expandable from Wikipedia:Notability (sports)#Tennis). The whole article is just too \"general\" and not specified to tennis itself. Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nyep...wiki is a living breathing entity and unfortunately pages frequently get left out of updating. You'd think that wikiproject tennis would be at the head of the update list to keep us all informed, but as you just pointed out it's a victim too. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nA lot of things need to be tightened on here. Such as do we use sponsor names or non sponsor names. And looking on the archieves here it is very much inconclusive, but at naming conventions they seem to go towards the non sponsor names. I personally vote for non sponsor so we know where to find the article where possible, etc but obviously we all need to agree and then impliment on all articles. I will have a think about some other bits and bobs. I am also trying to expand the wheelchair tennis stuff at the mo, so if we can come up and tighten the guidlines then all of this section will look good and uniformed. KnowIG (talk)\n\nI like the non-sponsor names also if at all possible. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nOk. I'll begin the updating by adding example excerpts from articles into the Lead, History...etc sections, correcting the reference articles at least to match what is recommended for them. And I am planning to add an example infobox in accordance to the guidelines with some arrows on it pointing out which row is for what purpose. I just wanted to make sure that you aware of that and follow the updating. As for the sponsor links, I guess we can have a overwhelming majority in favor of non-sponsor here, so I'll include it (a warning on avoiding it or redirect it) in the example links right at the top of the introduction. Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nIt's difficult because when I first started creating articles for tennis tournaments, I used generic names but these were gradually moved to the sponsored name of the tournament. Most tournaments are known officially by their sponsored name e.g. the AEGON international or BNP Paribas Open and I think that is what we should tell our readers. I have created articles for every WTA tournament in 1983 and 1984 and have used sponsored names where available. 03md\n\nSee you point 03md and is very frustrating. But I think non sponsered is the way to go, as that was what it was traditionally on here. Wikipedia is not a commercial operation and it has gradually changed to sponsored names which is wrong. Unfortunatly (No offence Lajbi and any other reading this) too many random IP's and non English speakers have done what they have liked and so we end up just chasing our tales all the time. In the past few months I've chipped away at the articles with out importance and literally every single draw sheet was uncatagorised even though it's clearly low on the scale. Also with joint challengers I've finally got people to do the women's draws as well. It's not the fact that you have to tell people. Just changing it and being consistant is enough of a nudge in my experience to get people to conform (and do the women's draws as well in my example above).\n\nI know it's been a while since I contributed anything significant on this front, but I felt I had to comment on something that, in a way, I helped to start (Stella Artois Championships etc.). When I started working on tennis articles on Wikipedia I used generic names too. Then it occurred to me that that didn't necessarily make sense â€“ tournaments had sponsored names, so why not use those for article titles? This formula was later backed up by reference books using sponsored names, and so I went along with it. The only reason that generic titles might not work is how they are written â€“ long-running tournaments in particular have never described themselves as said location, then Open. The Next Generation Adelaide International, for example, was never known as the Adelaide Open â€“ it was the South Australian Open, then the Australian Men's Hardcourt Championships, then the AAPT International and so on. Nor has the BNP Paribas Open been called the Indian Wells Open â€“ it has, however, used titles such as the Newsweek Champions Cup and the Pilot Pen Classic. That is the only problem with being generic with article titles â€“ even non-sponsored tournament articles would have to indicate changes to their endings (i.e. Indian Wells Cup, Indian Wells Classic etc.) over time, so generic titles still wouldn't be accurate enough to reflect their actual names. The best compromise I can think of is to use non-sponsored titles but the correct endings, such as the Internazionali d'Italia for the Internazionali BNL d'Italia. Even then, a lot of work would be required on that front. I do not necessarily agree with the generic format, but if it must be so, it must be so. Totalinarian (talk)\n\nMaybe it was not called the Indian Wells Open but it has certainly been called The Indian Wells Masters and the Indian Wells Championship, and to this day many magazines/papers call it as such. Miami the same way. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nOther quick examples to back up the one above; Miami Open, Auckland Classic (the WTA's ASB Classic), or the Washington (Tennis) Classic. Totalinarian (talk)\n\nI've long been advocating for more people to get involved in the creation of archived tennis tournaments and draw articles. Perhaps it is the fact that only myself, Totalinarian and KnowIG (and Oxford St. when I first began editing). have really made headway that has led to problems - other tennis editors may not have noticed these developments. It would be good if more people could get involved once we have sorted this issue out to fill in the vast gaps. A look at the yearly templates for men's and women's tennis indicate the amount of redlinks that need to be turned blue. 03md\n\nActually when I just looked at Wikipedia:WikiProject_Tennis/Templates most names in the templates are not red so you must have done a pretty good job. Sure something like Template:Australian Open girlsâ€™ doubles champions has lots of red names but it should...most are not notable enough to warrant their own article. Either that or they should be unlinked so as not to show red. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nThanks for your kind words. However I was really meaning templates such as Template:1980 WTA Tour which I would like editors to help fill in. It is not important to find loads of refs for each tournament to begin with but we want to start with creating stubs for all open era tournaments (WTA, ATP, Grand Prix, Virginia Slims, WCT etc.). I have recently created stubs for every tournament on these two templates. 03md\n\nCan someone help me to find out what are these? Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\ncommons:Category:Matches Tennis daily\n\nCategory:Matches Tennis daily\n\nHello!\n\nFrankly, I mean to clarify the idea until you're doing a project to develop a daily page is where all the tennis matches that are played\n\nJust like the site http://www.livescore.com/tennis/\n\nBut I did not mean to better clarify what I think\n\nI hope to work on this project because I am sure it will Succeed on Wikipedia\n\nThank you Ù…Ø­Ù…Ø¯ Ø§Ù„Ø¨ÙƒÙˆØ± (talk)\n\nIs there any reason why the color scheme below isn't used for the calendar pages (2009, 2010 and 2011 WTA Tour) ?\n\nWinner â€” Legend (pre/post 2010) Grand Slam tournaments Year-end championships Tier I / Premier Mandatory & Premier 5 Tier II / Premier Tier III, IV & V / International\n\nThese are the colors used in the Clijsters, Wozniacki, Zvonareva, Serena and Venus career stats articles, and many other player pages. I think this scheme is easier on the eyes than the one currently used, plus it matches the ATP colors. So, using these colors, the pages would look something like this. --JMDP (talk)\n\nYour version looks great, colour scheme is much easier on the eye. Boddefan2009 (talk)\n\nI know that there is a new trend for putting these up, so this is a quick heads-up regarding archive qualifying draws if anyone is interested in creating articles using them. It is still possible to find draws from 2001 and onwards on the ATP's website and an example article can be found here in due course. Totalinarian (talk)\n\nAnd on a similar vein, archive doubles qualifying draws â€“ because qualifying for doubles draws on the ATP Tour seems to have existed until the 2001 Wimbledon Championships â€“ are also available as well, and an example article for those draws can be found here. Totalinarian (talk)\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/2011 ASB Classic â€“ Singles Qualifying nominated five singles qualifying draws. It was closed as no consensus so they were kept and people now seem to be making them for all current tournaments. Doubles qualifying draws have not been at AfD as far as I know but they might get less support than singles. PrimeHunter (talk)\n\nI think they are notable but we should look at creating main articles for every WTA and ATP event (as I have been doing) in history before worrying about qualifying. 03md\n\nJust a little heads up. The WTA have changed it's website address again! Cause it was soneyericssontour this time last year! Anyway the latest change sees wtatour.com changed to wtatennis.com. Links should be fine but just be aware if you find any duffs as this is what has changed. Also any articles with links to the LTA website need to be changed as they had a revamp a few weeks ago. KnowIG (talk)\n\nHello, not sure what you all think about this article. For me its a step too far down the WP:LISTCRUFT route, but then I think that about quite a few of the articles on tennis on Wikipedia. Anyway, I thought that I'd draw attention to it as if nothing else it needs clearing up by someone with more time on their hands than I have; I'll let you tennis people decide what you want to do with it! --Pretty Green (talk)\n\nAt least it should be moved to List of ATP Grand slams & Masters Singles champions otherwise one might think it's a \"readable\" article (like I did). On other hand it could be likewise better if we transform it into a collapsable template, and place it at the bottom of referred articles. It will serve the purpose of summerizing those who has won the series, but won't occupy a whole page. I must say it also needs to be cleaned up. I know the masters series is a subject of modification all the time, but to simplificate them to master1, masters2 is kinda strange. Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nThe solution of having it at the bottom of pages is nul and void. Already have boxes for that. KnowIG (talk)\n\nI hadn't noticed this article before and my first impression is it's useless and should be deleted. We have pages for the majors, Atp finals and masters events already. The masters winners on the chart are only for masters wins in yearly order...not for a particular masters event... a useless stat imho. The title says \"ATP grand slams and masters singles\" yet it includes the ATP finals. It also only has the titles since 1990 when the \"ATP Tour\" started but the ATP and Masters have been around since 1972, so the title would need to be changed to reflect that. Something Like \"ATP Tour singles Grand Slam tournaments and Masters events.\" Heck those little asterix links are also very hard to hit correctly. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nIt says ATP in the title. Why would you need to add the other stuff when ATP did not have a tour until 1990. Nonplussed whether it is deleted or not. KnowIG (talk)\n\nBecause it's confusing without it. There have been plenty of atp sponsored masters events before 1990. The title says nothing about atp tour that started in 1990 so by adding the word \"tour\" it clarifies what this page is about. It's also not about grand slams it's about Grand Slam Tournaments or Majors so that could use clarifying. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nI still think that it wouldn't stand the test of Afd. It is senseless. I came up with the ideas above just to save it. It's not a common article, it's a list at most, but generally there's no need for it. As it has been said list of grand slams already exists, the masters have templates so having a separate article is totally useless in my opinion. Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nPlaying devils advocate to be fair... maybe I would think differently if it was by masters events instead of timeframe, the article title fit the content, the colors were better and had a key, the links in the table were bigger than an asterisk and that it was sorted by oldest to newest. The olympics are just as important also so they might need a column. There would also need to be a list at the bottom of maybe the top 5 leaders in totals for all of these events. Something to note that Federer leads with 38 victories, Sampras is 2nd with 30, Nadal has 27 and Agassi has 26. Just some thoughts since a nice comprehensive article, even with overlap, can be helpful to readers. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nThe creator asked for comments at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Tennis/Archive 6#ATP Grand slams & Masters Singles champions but got no replies. PrimeHunter (talk)\n\nBoy he sure did. It was squished right in the middle of Roland Garros ww2 winners and a big decision on tiebreaks so I unfortunately missed it. It's certainly no fault of his since he asked and did so in the right place. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nNice catch. We can still PM Fahidka to join the discussion here. Maybe we are a year late but reviewed it. BTW only two conventional pages link to it, so it's a reason to remain hidden so long. About the format : I would also recommend to have the masters enumeration changed to the location it was held if it changed then a new row should be inserted as a new header with the new venue. The same for the changes in their chronology. Otherwise it would need a ton of sidenotes. Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nThank you for the healthy discussions & thanks KnowIG for pinging me on talk page on this. My intention on this article is that there was no single page available from where we can monitor the real dominance in tennis over the years and I was particularly interested on the mens singles circuit. I believe there are 3 types tournaments really mattered for all the tennis players - GS, year end masters and ATP Masters / 1000 event and by comparing performances in these we will get the real dominance in tennis ckt over the years. I could not come up with a proper naming and I thought some one will suggest me a better name for the same. I intended it to go beyond 1990 & should be complete. Hope all of you can contribute on the same and make it better but I prefer this article stays without delete as lot of information is provided on the same which makes the users to really compare the dominance in tennis over the years and go to the selected tournament wikilinks available on the same. Fahidka (talk) 15:57 16 March 2011 (UTC)\n\nI fixed a bunch of things that were of concern and moved the article. Not sure what to do about the asterisks so I left them for the time being. I'm not sure if this is the best remedy but it is a remedy. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nI have noticed that the performance timelines for ATP players have been changed in recent weeks. Editors have begun including players' results from the ATP World Tour 500 Series, ATP World Tour 250 Series, Davis Cup etc. I was just wondering if this is really necessary as it makes the table quite lengthy. Furthermore, they have introduced a new colour scheme along with it for headings such as Grand Slams, ATP Masters Series 1000 etc. I for one would like to see the old format restored, but would like to ask what you guys think about this first. JayJ47 (talk)\n\nIt really is getting stewy isn't it? The rule of thumb seems to be that you can never have too much info here on wikipdedia. I only looked at Nadal and Federer career statistics... did you have other examples to bring to our attention? Thanks. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nThanks for your input Fyunck. Here's a list of players pages whose timelines have been changed to the new format (that I know of).\n\nRafael Nadal career statistics\n\nRoger Federer career statistics\n\nNovak Djokovic career statistics\n\nRobin Soderling\n\nJuan Martin Del Potro\n\nTomas Berdych\n\nBernard Tomic\n\nFernando Verdasco (just the new colour scheme)\n\nBut I'm sure there's a whole lot more. So what should we do about it? Leave it as is or change the tables back to normal? My suggestion is that we should keep the original format as it is easier to understand because it only lists a players achievements from the major events e.g. Grand Slams and Masters tournaments, and it is far less lengthy. JayJ47 (talk)\n\nReverting tables back to the old ones\n\nI'm going to start changing the tables back to what they use to look like. So if you guys could help me do so, that would be great. JayJ47 (talk)\n\nDo any of you know why the Indian Wells Masters points have been doubled for the qualifiers? All of them, Devvarman, Young, Harrison, Russel, etc received double points apparently without any reason (no it's not the point for qualification nor it is the 2010 IW points, it's simply multiplied by two). It would be useful to include the concerning rule to the 2011 ATP World Tour Finals (as the one with the actual race) ,in ATP Rankings and all articles containing a point distribution table (ATP World Tours). An example for it from Somdev Devvarman's ATP point breakdown :\n\nDate Tournament Round Points Drop Date 10.03.2011 ATP World Tour Masters 1000 Indian Wells - 106 19.03.2012 10.03.2011 ATP World Tour Masters 1000 Indian Wells R16 106 19.03.2012\n\nAnd he really got 212 points in total for his performance. He earned more points than a quarterfinalist. He moved a bunch of places in the top 100 as a consequence. I'm a bit confused. Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nWhy do you think that he really got 212 points? Manually adding all the points at Somdev Devvarman's ATP point breakdown gives 789. As you say, 106 is listed twice, but his total is only given as 683. This indicates to me that only one of the two listed 106 is actually counted. PrimeHunter (talk)\n\nYes I did that just moments ago. I couldn't post it since you've posted yours (edit conflict). I was wrong. I make my above comment null as ATP just shows as double but doesn't count it as so (the total equals by adding the IW pts only once as you've said). Still it looks misleading. Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nI agree it's misleading to have two 106 lines, and I guess it's an error which will be fixed at some time. 07.03.2011 he had 585 points. 21.03.2011 he had 683. 8 points from 2010 expired. 683-585 = 106-8, so this confirms that 106 is only counted once.

Your opinions and your advice are welcome. bon week-end Ã  tous --GeneviÃ¨ve (talk)\n\nI've nominated Oscar Wegner for deletion. You'll see why when you visit the page and read my comment on the AfD entry. Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nlol...The guy who started the page has only that article to his editing credits. Me thinks Eztennisswing=OscarWegner. Pretty much all the googling hits lead to his own pages or his published books on Amazon. The Scientologist arena seem to have written about him also. That said, he is published and is in a couple tennis forums...he has talked on espn and \"says\" he has worked with major pros. It needs references and it's not like it's a massively long self bloating article. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nI agree that the Oscar Wegner page should have been deleted as it did not comply with Wikipedia rules for writing a biography of a living person. However, Oscar Wegner is a notable person in the tennis world and there should be a Wikipedia page on him. The comments of Bushranger, MLA, Armbrust, Undertaker, MBelgrano and Fyunck are inaccurate or inappropriate. Mr. Wegner would like to write the text for his own page but I have explained to him that this is strongly discouraged, so I volunteer to write an unbiased, accurate, referenced article about him. As I am new to Wikipedia I need help in how to do so correctly and also need guidance on how to contact others and be contacted here on Wikipedia. Thank you for your help in this regard.Operalives (talk)\n\nI don't feel my comments were inappropriate or inaccurate and I searched for quite awhile to verify notability. What I wrote is what I found. You'll note that what I wrote here played devils advocate and mentioned some good things too. No rules I know of against him writing his own bio but with a living person the references should be plentiful and ironclad. They need to be printed or internet references that can be easily verified. Your best bet is to create it in a subpage called User:Operalives/sandbox. There you can edit, experiment and do whatever you like until you think it's ready. Then ask others here to check it out and make comments and suggestions to help out. I always found it easier to start an article by finding someone similar already in wikipedia. I would then edit, copy everything, and paste it into your sandbox page. Then tweak it and rewrite it to work with the new person. When you think it looks pretty good that's when you would again copy it and create the official page. Other help can be found at Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons. Good luck. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nYes. The main problem is that there must be a third-party publication about him (e.g. interview). Still some claims that makes him notable has to be said within it. For guidance please look up Wikipedia:WikiProject Tennis/Article Guidelines where you'll find the notability criteria as well. Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nI thank you, Fyunck and Lajbi, for your suggestions. Question: Is there any way to correspond privately with those of you who are editors and/or administrators, or are all discussions \"out in the open\"? Operalives (talk)\n\nSome have private mailing available... I don't. You would mention the article here but ask for answers on the article's talk page. That way everyone who wants to can comment and help. You would do that when you think it looks reasonably good. So you would write the query on the article's talk page and let people know about it over here to begin with. Once comments start flowing on the talk page some/many will comment and click the \"watch\" tab on top of that page to keep track of followups. Some wiki people will be very critical, some will be very friendly and helpful, and some will write a lot but not say very much. :-) That's the nature of the beast around here. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nThanks, Fyunck. I am starting to get t he hang of it.Operalives (talk)\n\nI think this requires major modifications. It does not contain list of most number of ATP singles titles (only given details of Jimmy connors with 109 but does not list top 10 in the list) which is much important. There should also be a separate section on most number of ATP match wins. Also detailing is needed on all the sections. I think the same should be arranged in the following way\n\nATP Wins / Titles\n\nMost Number of ATP singles titles\n\nMost Number of ATP singles match wins\n\nMost Number of consecutive singles title wins\n\nMost Number of consecutive final wins\n\nWinning Streaks\n\nLongest Match Winning streaks (all surfaces)\n\nLongest Match Winning streaks on Hard-courts\n\nLongest Match Winning streaks on Clay-courts\n\nLongest Match Winning streaks on Grass-courts\n\nATP Masters 1000\n\nMost number of ATP Masters 1000 titles\n\nMost number of ATP Masters 1000 match wins\n\nMost number of consecutive ATP Masters 1000 titles\n\nYear End Masters\n\nMost number of Year end masters titles\n\nMost number of Year end masters wins\n\nYear End winners who does not loose a set\n\nTournament Stats\n\nMost number of titles in a particular tournament\n\nMost number of consecutive titles in a particular tournament\n\nMost number of consecutive wins in a particular tournament\n\nI think Player records can be moved to separate page.

There is already a page with much more detailed info at ATP World Tour records. There are also now 2 masters 1000 articles.

It can also be helpful in List of ATP Tour Grand Slam tournaments and Masters singles champions.Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nI have made some changes to make it more user friendly - giving flag icons in all, changing the arrangements etc. Please check the same. Fahidka (talk) 10:26 26 March 2011 (UTC)\n\nMy understanding was that wikipedia frowns on \"flagicon\" but that if you do use it.... the first time a particular flag appears you should use \"flag\" instead of \"flagicon.\" Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nI think it is good to have a separate page containing match by match details of longest match winning streaks, especially for the top 10 winning streaks listed here. Let me know your opinion so that I can create separate page containing the details. Fahidka (talk) 16:40 4 April 2011 (UTC)\n\nI assume one page per winning streak? I see one major problem with it. As an article it is noteworthy ONLY because it's a top ten winning streak so if someone new comes around and knocks them out of the top ten the old article would need to be deleted from wiki. If all on one page it seems like it would be an incredibly long set of charts for men and women. It would need to be linked to the player's career statistic page and I would think each would need the two losses listed... the one that started the streak and the one that ended the streak. Actually it it might be better to make the chart and plop it into the player's career statistic page rather than make a separate page for each streak. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nI think it would be too much detail to list all matches in these winning streaks. I have linked the Federer years to existing articles where the streaks can be seen. PrimeHunter (talk)\n\nAdded Federer's winning streaks under his career statistics. Please let me know if you have any comments on the same before proceeding to other winning streaks. Fahidka (talk) 07:54 10 April 2011 (UTC)\n\nThe tiebreaks are done incorrectly. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nDone I fixed em up. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nWould it be worth me going through all of the old tennis tournament draw articles and changing the draw templates to the ones currently in use? For example, 2011 Grand Prix Hassan II â€“ Singles has the tennis3-v2 template with a top and bottom half, and also a finals section at the top, where the finals draw has full names, and the main draw has first initial, then last name. However, 2006 Grand Prix Hassan II â€“ Singles has a different and inconsistent layout. I'm perfectly happy to go through all the old main draws, as a majority of them are simple to fix, but I just want to clarify that we have the tennis3-v2 layout as the preferred. SellymeTalk\n\nThey both look ok to me though only the 2006 Grand Prix Hassan II â€“ Singles gets the tiebreak notation correct for wikiproject tennis. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nSo adding both scores is correct? I'll go around and do that then. SellymeTalk\n\nCorrect Sellyme. It was decided that many readers would not understand tennis notation so both scores are required for simplification, even in the draw brackets. They should be in superscript format. For me it's a pain to do because a lot of the notation is different... did they use \"&ndash\" script or simply \"â€“\", if there are hyphens I have to change them too and of course the tables are filled with \"|-\" so you can't change those hypens. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nI've created a template for tennis events at multi-sport events like the Olympics, PanAm Games, etc., called {{Tennis event MSE}}. It's similar to the tennis event boxes at Masters 1000 events, with the addition of the mixed doubles event (in preparation for the 20122 Summer OGs and the 2011 PanAm Games). But, the links to the other events below the champion information are repetitive if the events have an infobox with links to the other events (see Tennis at the 2011 Pan American Games â€“ Men's Singles for an example). Also, some previous tennis events' singles and doubles competitions are named differently than the ATP/WTA events are (i.e. Men's singles instead of Men's Singles. Should they be capitalized or not capitalized? Thanks! Prayerfortheworld (talk)\n\nCheck this out:\n\nI personally think it's a hoax... (Gabinho>:) )\n\nCheck out Section 4 and Section 5. It has GrÃ©ta Arn twice and it changes flag color from the actual Hungarian to Indian. And it also a draw with a size of a Grand Slam with only women singles as \"It was a singles only tournament. Many top players took part as it was a big tournament\". Sound childish, isn't it? And most of all Google finds the Wikipedia page only. It IS a hoax. Must be deleted. Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nIt looks like a hoax to me too plus we now must be suspicious of everything Saihimesh has attributed to wikipedia. I'll ask him/her about it nicely on their talk page and also ask if they've made any other hoax edits. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nIt is a hoax. Bally was nowhere near LA on that date. She came home after losing in Miami to prep for the clay |Oh and Venus is injured â€”Preceding unsigned comment added by 194.66.216.40 (talk)\n\nI have deleted it as a blatant hoax. PrimeHunter (talk)\n\nI nominated, but then withdrew my nomination for deletion of Fred Hagist after further consideration. He lost a Cincinnati Masters final back in the 1950s before it was a Masters (was known as the Tri-State Tennis Tournament), before the Open Era and the well organised ATP tour. The question comes down to how does the WP:NTENNIS apply to pre-Open era tennis players? Does criterion #3: \"The player has competed in the main draw in one of the major professional tournaments\" also apply to the amateur precursors of the current major tournaments, or not? You're opinions would be appreciated. The-Pope (talk)\n\nI think we need to be flexible on the pre-open era notability. To be honest I do think the list is already too liberal...just being in the draw of a 250 tournament is notable? I think not and I don't know who put that in the requirements. But back to Fred Hagist, he also played in several US Opens, making it to the third round in 1952. Being in a slam draw and being notable is debatable... but if you are notable for it in 2002 then you must be notable for it in 1952. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nThanks for your input, and I don't want to appear to be canvassing, but you really need to add it to the article and the AfD to make your opinion count. The-Pope (talk)\n\nDone on both AfD and the main article. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nThe spelling of this player's name was discussed before, but no conclusion was reached. In addition to 100 Years of Wimbledon, by Lance Tingay, and The Official History of the Championships, by John Barrett, her name is also spelled Lilian in the 2010 Wimbledon Compendium, by Alan Little, published by the AELTC (who should know). I would submit that these sources carry greater weight than 21st. century newspapers, which seem to be the only source for the spelling Lillian. Rmallett (talk)\n\nI came across the article short tennis, and I was wondering, since the article states \"it is recognised as a common training method by the ITF\", why there were no interwiki links. So, I looked around, and found fr:Mini-tennis and de:Kleinfeldtennis, but I am not sure whether they are the same or a different variant on tennis. Please could someone clarify this? All three are played on a smaller court than normal, and are designed to be helpful for beginners and small children. Coyets (talk)\n\nI speak all three languages and what is common in them that they describe the sport as having a smaller court. Only the German version mentions the metric parameters, while the two others mention a softer ball too. Neither the French nor the German have references, while the English has four but none of them is significant. While Google translator translates Kleinfeldtennis as Mini-tennis in French as well as in English, I assume it's the same as short tennis. But with such few information available so far it could happen that these \"training\" tactics differ although they are all designed for children education. Maybe we should ask Pretty Green the creator of the page for clarification. Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nOr you could look on the ITF website. never seen any mention of it there, seems to be something that could be attributed to the new tennis 10s thingy â€”Preceding unsigned comment added by 2.102.252.47 (talk)\n\nSorry for the late response, I've been away for the past few weeks. My comment that 'it is recognised as a common training method' is based entirely on the source here, in which the ITF endorses a couple of books on short tennis as ways of teaching the sport. 'Common' could perhaps be removed - on reflection that's probably my own addition and isn't necessarily supported in the source. --Pretty Green (talk)\n\n10-and-under tennis was mandated by the ITF in August 2010 ITF RULE CHANGE and is practiced in countries around the world ITF PLAY AND STAY Other names for this program include QuickStart Tennis, Mini Tennis, Little Tennis. This is a huge development in tennis teaching worldwide (especially in the USA) and there are copious amounts of data available on it.Operalives (talk)\n\nShould we begin to name the articles of tennis tournaments by their common name. In F1 articles, we don't use the sponsored names, just the common names, eg. we don't use name Petronas Malaysia Grand Prix, we use Malaysian Grand Prix. Hardly nobody speaks about BNP Paribas Masters or Heineken Open, instead we talk about Paris Masters or Auckland ATP tournament. --August90 (talk)\n\nIt has been discussed many times most recently here. Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nOK. Seems that generic names are recommended. But what about the report pages? E.g. Queen's Club reports don't have the sponsor's name whereas e.g. Miami Masters reports have. IMO the sponsor's name could be used in report pages especially if the tournament has no own name, like in BNP Paribas Open and AEGON Championships' cases. But if the tournament has an 'own' name, then the sponsor's name could be dropped, e.g. SkiStar Swedish Open -> Swedish Open. --August90 (talk)\n\nI assume by report pages you mean the links to something like 2010 Queen's Club Championships â€“ Singles? I would think the sponsor name could be used in these cases. It's a specific year and a specific tournament. There will always have to be some exceptions but it will need to be case by case. Heck Queens was always the \"London Grass Court Championships\" for me and the world saw it that way for 90 years. No one called it the Queens Club Championships before that because it housed more than one tennis tournament. But it has slowly morphed into the Queens Club Championships in today's lingo. So while generic is recommended we will need to remain flexible. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nMaybe we should mention both the sponsored and official name on the tournament reports. I think this article should be edited.\n\n2010 Queen's Club Championships\n\nHere's how it starts:\n\n\"The 2010 AEGON Championships was a tennis tournament played on outdoor grass courts. It was the 39th edition of the AEGON Championships...\"\n\nI think the generic name should also be mentioned. There hasn't been 39 AEGON Championships, instead there have been 39 tournaments at Queen's Club in the open era. IMO the article should start like this:\n\n\"The 2010 AEGON Championships was a tennis tournament played on outdoor grass courts. It was the 39th edition of the Queen's Club Championships...\"\n\nAnother thing is naming these pages. I think that generic names could be also used in the names of tournament reports, as we never speak about e.g. 2010 AEGON Championships, we speak about 2010 Queen's Club Championships. But the first bolded name in the article should IMO be the official (sponsored) name. --August90 (talk)\n\nI fully support using a mix of the two. For article naming, I recommend that if the sponsor is well known and has been sponsoring the tournament for a long time (e.g. Sydney Medibank International) then the sponsor's name can be used in the lead, whereas otherwise the common name would likely be the original name of the tournament, where one exists. SellymeTalk\n\nThat would be better but also incorrect. It was always the \"London Grass Court Championships\" held at Queens club. In '79 it got sponsored and in '08 it got sponsored again. So saying there were 39 Queen's Club Championships is also incorrect. Queens Club has held other championships besides this particular tournament. It would be better written as \"The 2010 AEGON Championships was a tennis tournament played on outdoor grass courts. It was the 39th edition of this tournament, held at Queens Club, in the open era.\" Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nStill, if you say \"Queen's Club Championships\", everybody thinks about the Queen's Club ATP tournament, not other tournaments hosted by Queen's Club. I haven't seen the name \"London Grass Court Championships\" anywhere else than in Wikipedia. In Queen's Club Championships' discussion page one argument is that BBC uses name \"Queen's Club Championships\".\n\nAnyway, in most cases generic name is the best option for the article title. Sponsored names are IMO OK if it's the common name of the tournament. And IMO the the title doesn't necessarily have to be the former non-sponsored name if it's not used in common speech. In some cases a good system is just naming articles like ATP Buenos Aires. --August90 (talk)\n\nI agree that everyone calls it the Queens Club Championships and I have no problem with that being the generic name, but there have not been 39 Queens Club Championships just as there have not been 39 Aegon Championships. If you had grown up in the 60's and 70's you would have talked about the London Grass Court Championships at Queens Club, or the London Covered Court Championships at Queens Club. The name should be the Queens Club championship here but we need to be careful and accurate how we word the sentences within the article. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nI understand your point. There is not and has never been a tournament called \"Queen's Club Championships\". It would be interesting to know the name of the trophy. If it's London Grass Court Championship trophy, then we could call the tournament with it's old name \"London Grass Court Championships\". --August90 (talk)\n\nThis site calls 2010 AEGON Ch'ships as Ch'ships of London. The history of London Ch'ships is explained here. So maybe the 'formal name' of this tournament is 'London Championships' or 'Championships of London'. But maybe we should also take into account the editions of this tournament held at London Athletic Club. --August90 (talk)\n\nI checked two books I have, one of them the \"Encyclopedia of Tennis - 100 Years of Great Players and Events\" by Max Robertson & Jack Kramer. They call it the \"London Grass Court Championships.\" However I think most call it Queens Club Championships today so maybe that's where it should stay for now. I emailed Queens Club to see what the trophy is named and I also asked what the tourney is officially named minus any sponsor. We'll see if they get back to me with a response or give me a link. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nQueens Club just emailed me with a short answer... the name of the trophy is called the \"The Queens Cup.\" I tried to find a source by googling the name but came up dry. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nSo would it be a good system to refer to a certain year's tournament with its official sponsored name and to refer to a tournament in general with its non-sponsored/generic name? --August90 (talk)\n\nI think that's pretty reasonable. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nAnother tournament whose name I've been wondering is Canada Masters/Rogers Cup. Its article calls that tournament with three names; the title is Rogers Cup, the first bolded name is Canada Masters, and the title of the infobox is Canadian Open. I don't know whether that tournament is anymore even formally the Canadian Open ch'ship, or is it just the tourny that used to be the Canadian Open. If it can still be considered to be the Canadian Open, then it would be relevant to talk about that tournament as Canadian Open. But if it's not anymore the Canadian Open, then I think the generic name should be Canada Masters. Of course, women's tournament isn't a Masters event, but Canada Masters would at least be a non-sponsored generic name. --August90 (talk)\n\nAs you can see the Oscar Wegner article has been recreated by Operalives. After having a first look on it I've easily found a dozen errors regarding its references and fetched a dozen tags on them. I follow the good faith principle, and assume that the creator lacks enough Wikipedia experience, otherwise I would nominate it for deletion for the second time though. I'll give it a grace period for a month or so and see if it improves but if not, AfD will be inevitable.

Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nThanks, Lajbi for your attention on the new Oscar Wegner page. It is intended to educate readers and to counter the previous suggestions that Mr. Wegner is not a notable person in tennis. Having spoken personally with or been privy to conversations with many of the greatest names in tennis regarding Mr. Wegner there is no doubt that he is very significant as both a witness to and participant in the pre-open era international circuit as well as a keen observer of the open era and major contributor to the development of modern tennis teaching techniques. The problem lies in published sources to validate statements of people such as Rod Laver, Charlie Pasarell, Ray Moore, Bud Collins, Butch Buchholz, Patrick McEnroe, Jose Higueras, Cliff Drysdale, etc. Since I do not have such material in writing I have used whatever I could find to substantiate events and opinions regarding Mr. Wegner. I appreciate any and all help in improving the page's content and citations as it deserves to remain on Wikipedia for the edification of readers. I am a newbie so I want to learn from you all through this. Please be specific in your comments with solutions, not just problems with the article. This is a learning experience for me, and hopefully for you as well.Operalives (talk)\n\nKeeps conterversally merging the ATP International series and series gold pages into the 250 and 500 series articles.

They have just become number one and two in the world and Djok may surpass Rafa after the French Open. They have met 27 times with Nadal leading 16-11...They have recently played what, 4 matches, all in Djokovic's favor. They are about the same age. What if Djok and Rafa meet for the French final and Rafa wins in 5 tough sets, snapping Djoks winning streak? It would be hard to argue against an intense rivalry in the making at that point. Are people talking about it right now where they would very likely want to look up their head to head details? I think they might be. Maybe you should be bold. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nSince they probably change place on the top, I think such an article has matured to come alive, but we need to be very careful with the references. As I remember it existed earlier and has been deleted in AfD with many reasons saying that the ATP-related refs are hypeing up the situation for advertisment purposes and thus are not reliable. So unless we find third-party publications that it is an actual rivalry we shouldn't jump in and wait for references to later come by (and so we can't name it a \"rivalry\" based on the many encounters, because that's an original research). But anyways I support. Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nBy what both of you are saying, I think time is the better part of discretion here on this subject. I just brought it up to see if it was correct to create the article again. Thanks for the great feedback.SaysWhoWhatWhenWhereWhyHow?

More information is available at the previous post here. Hopefully someone cares to answer this before the tennis event at the 2011 PanAm Games rolls around. Thanks. Prayerfortheworld (talk)\n\nI like it.SaysWhoWhatWhenWhereWhyHow? (talk)\n\nThanks for replying! Someone from the MSE WikiProject brought up the fact that the Tennis MSE template makes the infobox for tennis at MSEs redundant. Because this issue will probably come up later on with other MSEs, I wanted to put it up here so that WP:TENNIS would be aware of it. Prayerfortheworld (talk)\n\nIt appears that tennis articles are in breach of MOSFLAG in that they are using flags in infobox and also to show the birthplace of the players. Is not the goal of wikiprojects to promote their article to featured article status which can't be done as long as they are in breach of our style guidelines. Mo ainm~Talk\n\nI have to disagree with you per Wikipedia:MOSFLAG#Use of flags for sportspeople (except for the place of birth, which is indeed unnecessary). Since a tennis player will become notable if he/she represents his country in the Davis Cup, it is inevitable to include it his infobox as flags are allowed in representing the mother country in the Olympic Games. As Davis Cup hasn't got an bottom infobox extension on its own and it would be highly inadequate to add one so the nationality flag applies for his ITF affiliation as highest governing body as per \"Flags should generally illustrate the highest level the sportsperson is associated with.\". See Michael Venus (tennis) for example who became notable when he switched nationality and thus played in an international level. For tennis events the exception mentioned here applies to us as well (FIFA World Cup equals the Davis Cup, they both are dedicated for the same purpose). Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nThe page you linked to is a prime example of why flags shouldn't be used in an infobox, I know nothing about tennis players but when I look at that infobox the 2 flags do not explain anything to me. Did he represent the USA in the Davis Cup and now represent New Zealand? And what extra information is added with the flag that the text doesn't convey? Also I would say the exception you also link to would do for articles on the Davis Cup not on individual tenni players.Mo ainm~Talk\n\nSigh. Oh my word. Talk about interpretation of the rules. Just because YOU think that it doesn't add anything does not mean that it shouldn't be there. Every sports person page has a flag for identification of the nation they repersent in their info box apart from snooker which doesn't include them for an entirely different reasons. 194.66.216.40 (talk)\n\nCalm down IP take a chill pill, don't make statement that are incorrect no every sports person do not have flags in their respective infobox. Mo ainm~Talk\n\nExample which isn't snooker then. 194.66.216.40 (talk)\n\nCristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney, Ronan O'Gara, Geoffrey Boycott, on a quick look need I get more? Mo ainm~Talk\n\nProblem none of those boxes have parameter for nationality as you play for a national team, now go and pick people with boxes which have the nationality parameter and stop taking the piss and bending stuff to your view. 194.66.216.40 (talk)\n\nSo you admit you are edit warring to insert a flag to represent someone's nationality? What about the reverts you did on 2009 SAT Bangkok Open â€“ Singles and 2009 Internazionali di Tennis di Bergamo where are the nationality fields in those infobox, if that is the criteria you are using to make your judgement or are you jut following my edits and reverting? Mo ainm~Talk\n\nAh! Someones throwing their toys out the pram cause they can't get their own way! Bless. How about you respond to my last edit. And perhaps if you didn't go I@VE GOT CONSENSUS when you hadn't then you wouldn't get reverted. But I see you just want to ban me so you can have your own way. But I ain't going to go through your edits so I guess your going to have to work harder to get rid of me. 194.66.216.40 (talk)\n\nWhy would I want to get rid of you? You are responsible for your own actions and nothing I could do could get you blocked only you would bring about that situation. You made a statement which I showed to be false, now why did you revert the two articles I listed above when they don't have the \"magic\" nationality parameter that you are using as your defence? Mo ainm~Talk\n\nAh! now your moving the arguement from biography pages to tournaments. Be consistant in your arguement what are you exactly saying. But I see that you felt you couldn't be BOLD on any recent article and had to go to 2009 articles which no one is looking at cause you knew you'd get shouted down that your wrong. pathetic. 194.66.216.40 (talk)\n\nMy stance hasn't changed no flags in infobox is my stance according to MOSFLAG, I see again you are trying to deflect away from my question to you obviously you have no reasoning why you reverted or I'm sure you would have shouted by now also the articles I removed the flags from came up when I hit the random article link. Mo ainm~Talk\n\nStop deflecting you changed the arguement from biblography to tournaments so fail yourself. One man campaign jog on son your a joke 14:21, 6 May 2011 (UTC)\n\nI will not be responding to you any longer, and will wait till someone who at least can put up some rational argument for the stance of the project. Mo ainm~Talk\n\nOh my God what's going on here? I'm sorry Mo ainm, it isn't the style were are commonly using here on WP:TENNIS. So getting back to the infobox flag problem as his article says Michael Venus didn't play for the USA and thus wasn't notable as per Wikipedia:Notability (sports)#Tennis. When he switched his nationality he played for New Zealand and became notable. So nationality does really count in the field of tennis. Yes text would be also nice, but the rule you linked allows the usage of flags in these cases because he represents his country so why not include them. And yes the other link I provided is for cups/tournaments not for players, but I don't know exactly which articles are you complaining about. Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nNo need for apologies IP was a little annoyed, I can understand the point you are making with regard to the Tennis players sporting nationality but that is not what the field in the infobox is showing, it is Country now the assumption that can be made from that is it is the birthplace of the player. Why is the USA flag being used in the article you linked to? Mo ainm~Talk\n\nThat is the point: He was playing as an American citizen but not for their Davis Cup (he wasn't notable because he hasn't won any titles), but as being born in NZ he returned and began to play to them thus he qualified for Wikipedia. So if you check any tournament table before 2010 they indicate Venus as an American player. Ian Thorpe has a flagicon in his featured article infobox because he played for his nation. As I said Davis Cup hasn't got any infobox plug-in but the players affiliation does count (not in his birth date data, USA member states and other stuff are agreed to be avoided) as WP:Notability says:\"The player has competed in the Fed Cup, Davis Cup, Hopman Cup or similar international competition\". I know that based upon my reasoning the USA flag might be deleted, but it's kinda awkward, isn't it? Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nSo why then should we ignore the manual of style in such flags should not be used to emphasize nationality without good reason, or flag icons should not be used in infoboxes, even when there is a \"country\", \"nationality\" or equivalent field? Mo ainm~Talk\n\nHold on just a second all of you The rule is clear and is not about who is interpreting the rule correctly at all, which I wish you all would get over yourselves on that matter, pronto. I would say take the tennis player Andy Murray because he would be a better example of this rule. I am not going on interpretations at this point nor will I ever. Andy Murray clearly was born Scottish, yet he competes for the Davis Cup and Olympic team of Great Britian. So, go and look at his page and tell me what you all think is the solution because I already know what it will be. Try to work it out amongst yourselves, but I will be their if you all can't see the light of day. Good day to all and to all a good night.SaysWhoWhatWhenWhereWhyHow? (talk)\n\nI'm sure there is a better way to write this than what SaysWhoWhatWhenWhereWhyHow said... it was a little harsh by my standards. MOSFLAG is both pretty clear and pretty vague. It is clear that in tennis infoboxes, flags are there ONLY for the nationality the player plays or played under. That's it. It's vague on whether they should be there at all. It says try not to use them but it also says it's fine in things like fifa or the olympics which are international contests. In some respects tennis is like Fifa and the Olympics. It's international and to play one of the 4 Majors you MUST be a representative of a nation or you can't play. I'm not sure about the lower tiers and eligibility but Davis Cup is like the 4 Majors. Now I really don't care whether the flags are there or not but if they are they must not indicate birthplace... playing nationality only. Also by wikipedia standards on first use in a table or article the country name or abbreviation should be visible next to the flag. Usually by using \"flag\" instead of \"flagicon.\" Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nYes that's my point as well. I can't see any difference between Ian Thorpe (featured article) and Andy Murray, so both of them can have the flag based on the nation they represent in international level. That's all. Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nSolution: Nationality should not have the flag, but they should create a new section of the infobox called National team or National representation, and list Andy Murray's nationality as being Scottish and his National team or whatever as being Great Britian. You all did not need to go on needlessly debating this out, when the solution was staring both of you right in the face. By the way, I was being abrupt with both of you all so you all can get done with this nonsense.SaysWhoWhatWhenWhereWhyHow? (talk)\n\nI'm not sure where you would be reading this as a solution \"staring them in the face.\" Nationality certainly can have a flag and changing wiki rules of infobox templates requires some consensus with others. It might be able to be done but it is certainly not obvious nor in their faces. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nActually, this is a minor concern that even you Fyunck are blowing up to immense proportions. This could be easily and readily changed by adding one small thing to the infobox, which is a national team section. This would go in line with Andy Murray, which country would be Scotland, and that is more correct than to say Great Britain. Also, the national team would be Great Britain because he plays for them in the Davis Cup and in the Olympic Games. Consensus is not always talked about because it is done through multiple changes by various editors on an article, infobox, or a template. So, someone needs to change the infobox to mirror the rule, and see if others object to the matter, or put a wait and see while it is debated on the appropriate page.SaysWhoWhatWhenWhereWhyHow? (talk)\n\nIf you have another solution to this problem come up with one you all, lets not fight over rules because they are here to guide us in editing. They need to be debated and re-intrepreted on the rule pages not on some WikiProject about a sport. This is why, I get massively frustrated seeing this get done here and would like a solution not rule debating. This rule has to be debated on the appropriate page not here because it effects multiple projects like golf, tennis, and swimming just to name a few. I would be glad to see it debated on the rule page, which I might just in fact join in the effort. So, it is all about place here, which this is not the place. This debate if it goes forward needs to be notified on all other sports project, which may have a stake in the matter.SaysWhoWhatWhenWhereWhyHow? (talk)\n\nHmmm... If you want to debate and add an international event nationality section to the infobox I have no problem with it at all. National team won't really do because Wimbledon is not a national team event yet mandates a national sponsor. So the wording could be tricky. And while you could have a flag icon for the international event line in the infobox you couldn't for the birth country or country one lives in as that would be against policy. You are correct that this is a multi-sport argument that could use multiple inputs but it is tough enough to work out the kinks in one sport let alone multitudes. Flag issues have been a pretty big concern from the arguments I've seen through the years... some real knock-down-drag-outs have happened... the tiff above seems very cordial compared to the whoppers throughout wiki. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nI just want solutions not endless frustration of arguing. I am a solutions based guy, and what to find out what things mandates and get them over and done. Debating helps when an idea or something is vague or not workable. I think you are right on again about the wording issues involved here. I think we could do a wait and see before we go forth with our solution or we could use it as an example, you pick.SaysWhoWhatWhenWhereWhyHow? (talk)\n\nI flipped a coin and.... of course it stayed up on its edge. :-) I really don't know the best way to do it. I have no problem the way it is now and if it gets changed I'm fine with that too. I try to pick my battles on items I'm more passionate about than flags so when people have trouble agreeing I simply point to policy. I guess I'm usually a wait-and-see person. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nI take a step and edit the tennis biography infobox and add a collapsible team event affiliation line at the bottom (if I have enough time to do so). Then we \"do\" the waiting stuff... (Grand Slam problems will be resolved later). Agreed? Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nYou are making it extra hard on yourself. I suggest all you do it put right below country or above your preference a new attribute with national team or NOC/ITF Team or something you decide on that, too! I will support you in doing just something that simple because you are trying to make it difficult on yourself.SaysWhoWhatWhenWhereWhyHow? (talk)\n\nSo the solution, for your example of Andy Murray above, is to show the Union Flag instead of the Saltire, in the infobox of someone who very publicly self-identifes as Scottish rather than British. Brilliant. Daicaregos (talk)\n\nWell now that wasn't all that helpful. I think you fail to understand the infobox... we can change it to possibly say he is Scottish while also still saying his international affiliation is UK. The flag, if used, MUST only be for the UK to signify his national sports affiliation... it can not be used per wikipedia for citizenship acknowledgment. I don't think there is anything about words but flags can not be used that way in an infobox. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nMy understanding of the infobox was that it should summarize key facts about the article in which it appears. Have I misunderstood? One of the key aspects of Andy Murray is that he is Scottish. I don't think he would thank members of this project for enforcing a rule requiring the Union Flag to be shown on his Wikipedia article, instead of the Saltire. I'm sorry if you feel that wasn't all that helpful, but don't you think Wikipedia has some responsibility towards the subjects of its biographies? Daicaregos (talk)\n\nJust use the MOS and do not put any flag in the infobox, they add nothing to the article as the name of the country is beside it. Mo ainm~Talk\n\nThat's one option. However, at the risk of repeating myself (as the issue hasn't been addressed at all): \"my understanding of the infobox was that it should summarize key facts about the article in which it appears. Have I misunderstood? One of the key aspects of Andy Murray is that he is Scottish.\" If there is a nationality field in this infobox, I couldn't find it. And I do not agree with you that flag icons add nothing to an article. They are easily recognisable symbols, which was, after all, their original purpose. Daicaregos (talk)\n\nSome flags are instantly recognisable but far from all and in an infobox they give undue weight to one field also flags should not be used to denote someones nationality. Mo ainm~Talk\n\nSo, at the risk of repeating myself: \"However, at the risk of repeating myself (as the issue hasn't been addressed at all): 'my understanding of the infobox was that it should summarize key facts about the article in which it appears. Have I misunderstood? One of the key aspects of Andy Murray is that he is Scottish.'\" You may have missed this. Daicaregos (talk)\n\nAll the more reason not to add it as flags shouldn't be used to represent the current, birth or death place of someone per MOSFLAG. Mo ainm~Talk\n\nAndy Murray self-identifies as Scottish. The Saltire would denote his nationality, not his current, birth or death place. His sense of nationality is one of the key facts of the article and should be noted in the infobox. Daicaregos (talk)\n\nHe is Scottish by birth and the addition of the flag is to show this, which is against MOSFLAG, for the record if you don't already know I oppose all flags in all infobox they ad nothing that the text doesn't already say in it. Mo ainm~Talk\n\nAndy Murray self-identifies as Scottish and he is Scottish by birth. Nevertheless, a nationality field would denote wait for it ... yes, you guessed it his nationality, not his current, birth or death place. So your contention of it being against MOSFLAG on those grounds wouldn't apply. And for the record, MOSFLAG does not oppose all flags in all infoboxes. Daicaregos (talk)\n\nGranted there are some exceptions but this isn't one. Mo ainm~Talk\n\nThanks for responding. However, the problem is yet to be resolved. I will try to set it out clearly. Please let me know if you don't understand. Infoboxes should summarize key facts about the article in which it appears. One of those facts about Andy Murray is that he self-identifies as Scottish. His infobox currently shows his 'country' as Great Britain. With or without a flag, that can't be right. What can be done to improve this? Daicaregos (talk)\n\nI haven't looked at the article but IMO if he is Scottish then that should go in the field marked nationality. Mo ainm~Talk\n\nI find myself in the unusual, but happy, position of agreeing with you Mo ainm :) However, as I said what seems many hours ago, but was actually at 11:47 (I checked) there is no field marked nationality in this template. Daicaregos (talk)\n\nAny of you actually play tennis, of have the slightest interest in it at all? If so, maybe point us to the tennis articles you've edited; really edited, I mean, not just removed flags from. LevenBoy (talk)\n\nBreak\n\nGoodness. Once again, for sports people per wikipedia \"Flags should never indicate the player's nationality in a non-sporting sense; flags should only indicate the sportsperson's national squad/team or representative nationality.\" For Murray that would be Great Britain. Now this is only flags, not words. I see no reason that a player's non-sport nationality can't be there without a flag although that info is usually right in the first sentence of the article above the infobox. You'll note that Murray's is a tennis biography infobox and it summarizes pertinent tennis info about the man... e.g. he plays for GB in tennis events. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nIt would be helpful if, when quoting policy, the relevant policy is linked (or at least noted). Would you mind? I see no reason why a player's nationality is not in the infobox either. Are you sure the last sentence is accurate. How often, or for what percentage of his tennis events does he play for GB? Daicaregos (talk)\n\nThat is not made clear in the infobox of Murray the field is Country so it wouldn't be to far of a stretch to assume that it is talking about his place of birth, if the field said sporting nationality then it would be a hell of a lot clearer, but still shouldn't have a flag in the infobox. Mo ainm~Talk\n\n@Daicaregos. Are you purposefully trying to be difficult here? Are you reading all of this thread or only some of it? The relevant policy is linked already in this thread. It's even in the header put up by Mo ainm MOSFLAG. And then Lajbi put up Wikipedia:MOSFLAG#Use of flags for sportspeople. I read what they posted and the links they posted and I assumed that you did too before you continued on with your argument. As far as I know all Murray's tennis events are played under GBR. In doing a quick check at the official websites for Maimi Masters and Canadian Masters he is playing under GBR. It looks like there was already an argument on this under Murray with people unsure of whether he was listed under GBR or UK. Consensus wound up with GBR. Exhibitions may be different though. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nNo editor has given a reason why the MOS is ignored by this project, yes on certain limited occasions tennis players represent a country but the majority of the time they are not representing anyone but themselves, so could someone explain why we should ignore \" flag icons should not be used in infoboxes, even when there is a \"country\", \"nationality\" or equivalent field: they are unnecessarily distracting and give undue prominence to one field among many.\" Example look at 2006 Wimbledon Championships now that is IMO a disgrace of an article with flagicons taking over the page never mind the infobox, what encyclopaedic value is the addition of the flags to that article considering it isn't an event were international teams are represented? And has every single person listed actually played in Davis Cup?Mo ainm~Talk\n\nMOSFLAG is not being ignored imho. For the most part it discourages flags in infoboxes but makes exceptions for sports people's representative nationality. The page you link to I see nothing wrong per-say with the infobox flags... that infobox would be a stew, flags or no flags. And Davis Cup is only part of it... look at Alex Olmedo. He was a Peruvian citizen yet played under the US flag for all his Major tennis events along with Davis Cup. Murray plays under the flag of Great Britain and that shows up as a flag icon on the main websites for all these tennis tournaments... not just wikipedia. We have incorporated the playing nationality in almost all articles and tables and that's a good thing. I really don't care if there's a flag icon in the infobox or not, my point being only that \"if\" there is a flag icon in the infobox it must only represent playing nationality... in Murray's case, Great Britain. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\n(edit conflict) Were in MOSFLAG does it state that exceptions are made for biographical sports articles? I agree with you that the flag when used must be their sporting nationality but at present the field were most flags are beside is Country not Sporting Nationality. On the article I linked to an editor who is not very familiar with Tennis will assume that the tournament was won by Switzerland with Roger Federer representing themMo ainm~Talk\n\nIn tennis articles, which have so many tables, the flags represent sporting nationality not country. When you see a list of US Open winners with flags beside the names it's the player's sporting nationality. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nBut that isn't conveyed if an new editor were to look at any tennis article do you really believe that they will now about \"sporting nationality\" and not just the tennis players nationality? As to my question above do you really believe an editor not familiar with Wimbledon would think that the tournament was won by Switzerland with Roger Federer representing them? Mo ainm~Talk\n\nAndy Murray\n\nAndy Murray is Scottish. Country should be listed as Scotland or if nationality is used it should be Scottish, so that must be listed as his country/nationality. The ITF (Davis Cup) and IOC (Olympic) games will not allow him to compete on the Scottish national team, since his Davis Cup team and NOC in the Olympic games is Great Britain. By wikipedia rules it would mandate no Scottish flag to be utilized, and says that for teams the flag of Great Britain is to be used. By the way, tennis players are defined by their nationality in every event they play. By the way unless a player plays the requiste number of matches in Davis Cup/Fed Cup they are prohibited from being allowed to play in the Olympic Games, which if injured they can get a waiver, but I don't want to go their. Also, the ITF governs the grand slams in tennis, which mandates national affiliation to compete in the slam, and they are the biggest event on the calendar in tennis and takes place four times in a year. I just think we should add one little tiny label to the infobox to comply with the spirit of the rule.SaysWhoWhatWhenWhereWhyHow? (talk)\n\nThat is more of an issue for the template than a MOSFLAG issue. Mo ainm~Talk\n\nExactly, all that has to be done is to add an additional field to the infobox, which would say national team, and that would solve it. All you would have to do is say on the Andy Murray page for example. After the template is fixed, would be to take Great Britain and replace it to Scotland for the country field, and for the national team field put in Great Britain.SaysWhoWhatWhenWhereWhyHow? (talk)\n\nI prefer to use nationality instead because we would be able to say Scottish. I will go and try to work of some examples of this for other players.SaysWhoWhatWhenWhereWhyHow? (talk)\n\nBut your missing the point of this thread it is about the ignoring of the MOS and putting flags in the infobox. Mo ainm~Talk\n\nNo, I am coming up with solutions guided by the MOS because use of flags for sportspeople is the guide. You all are debating the rule, I am trying to work within it to the best of my abilities.SaysWhoWhatWhenWhereWhyHow? (talk)\n\nIt sounds like what you are suggesting would work just fine and still fit within the rules. It would show he is from Scotland and also show he plays for Great Britain as far as tennis events go. The flag no-flag issue would still go on and on and on and on but the infobox would give more complete details. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nI would be against the addition of another field (and the possibility of another flag) in the infobox. Look at Jackie Stewart and Jim Clark, two of the most famous Scottish sporting personalities ever. The opening paragraph identifies them as Scottish but the infobox shows that they competed under a British flag. Bjmullan (talk)\n\nYep... and it seems perfectly fine to me too. As long as no second flag is introduced (I'm against that 100%) I can live with either way.\n\nI would be all for it because an infobox purpose is to summarize the key concepts in an article, which means without nationality and/or national team it would be rather incomplete at best, so it merits inclusion of both based on policy. Regardless your view on flags.SaysWhoWhatWhenWhereWhyHow? (talk)\n\nIt would be silly to put a Scottish flag next to Andy Murray's name, when every WP:reliable source I've seen lists his country as \"Great Britain\" or \"United Kingdom\", and all show the Union flag only. (e.g. ATP, Australian Open, Roland Garros, etc.) Remember, this is an encylocpediaâ€”we report what external reliable sources say, not create new synthesis of information. â€” Andrwsc (talk Â· contribs)\n\nOk, then we must take country/nationality out for tennis players anyways because he competes for Great Britain in the Davis Cup/Olympics. So, I believe we should just go with national team alone, and leave in flags like the rules say to do, which would put these in link with MOS.SaysWhoWhatWhenWhereWhyHow? (talk)\n\nWhy does this depend on the Davis Cup or Olympics? Tennis is a sport where \"country\" is prominently shown in reliable sources (complete with flag), so there is no issue with following those reliable sources. The flag MOS was originally written years ago because some editors were popping flag icons onto any biographical infobox, but for sports like tennis, there is no controversy. â€” Andrwsc (talk Â· contribs)\n\nGreat, go and tell mo_anim that. I agree with your sentiments as well on this issue as it presently stands is fine.SaysWhoWhatWhenWhereWhyHow? (talk)\n\nFor what its worth I am Welsh born in Wales but I am British as neither Scotland, England, Northern Ireland and Wales exist as individual Sovereign States under International Law they are United (Kingdoms) held together by various acts of union/treaty in 1284, (Kingdom of England & Principality of Wales) to form the Kingdom of England & Wales. 1707, Kindom of England & Wales & Kingdom of Scotland) to form ( Kingdom of Great Britain). 1801 (Kingdom Great Britain & Kingdom of Ireland) to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain & Ireland. 1922 year of Southern Ireland's independence to form the Republic of Ireland or Eire finally in 1927 (Great Britain & Northern Ireland) to form (the United Kingdom Great Britain & Northern Ireland so unless Scotland recently have broken away from the United Kingdom Andy Murray is born in Scotland is Scottish by birth but is British Citizen. The only time these countries play any sport individually at international level are at the Commonwealth Games, Rugby, and Football (soccer).--Navops47 (talk)\n\nOf course you are. That's why your user page says you originate from Chester and that \"An ancestor of this user was born in Wales\". For what its worth I have two Nobel prizes, one for Chemistry and one four Litrature. So that trumps your claims and original research about sports. Daicaregos (talk)\n\nI don't know if it changes anything but tennis.com, which is obviously a reliable source lists him for Scotland : [15]. Lajbi Holla @ me â€¢ CP\n\nHockey example\n\nHockey infobox has it done correctly by the rules because they use national team just look at Ryan Kesler, and they link it to the national hockey team. I could do this for tennis players to the Davis/Fed Cup and Olympic teams, which would be well within the policy like the Hockey player are right now.SaysWhoWhatWhenWhereWhyHow? (talk)\n\nIt would need to say more like \"Nation Represented\" or \"National Affiliation\" instead of \"National Team\" since at Wimbledon they might represent the US but be from Peru yet not be part of a team. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nFlags in an infobox is against WP:MOSFLAG. Mo ainm~Talk\n\nNo it is not for national team/squad, which you are confusing with nationality. They are allowed for the use to represent a national team an athlete plays for, which you are sorely missing the correct passage on your own policy page you are citing. Go read on down, then come back here and make that comment again.SaysWhoWhatWhenWhereWhyHow? (talk)\n\nGo read second sentence here!SaysWhoWhatWhenWhereWhyHow? (talk)\n\nNow that I have nearly finished adding draws and scores for the early Wimbledon tournaments (in singles anyway) I see that (at least) the early 1920s Wimbledon pages that already exist are slightly different :-\n\na) the first set of draw results on the page only give semi-finals and final. Would it be better to give the quarter finals here as well ?\n\nb) only the players' surnames are given.

Would it be better to display their names in plain text if they don't have a biographical page ? I seem to remember that this was discussed before in another context, but can't find it now.\n\nAnd, regarding Andy Murray, AFAIK he has never represented Scotland at any international event, so (until Scotland declares independence) the saltire should not be used.Rmallett (talk)\n\nMy opinions are:\n\na) quarter-finals should be included if we want consistency across the board b} add surnames where known (or initial if not known), again for consistency c) link them to the pages even if they are redlinks - this should hopefully encourage people to click and create stubs for missing players. 03md\n\nQuarter-finals should be included, yes. And each players full name should be included in every scenario. However, redlinks should always remain there, any player who has played at an ATP World Tour event (Or any of the predecessors) is inherently notable, and should be linked regardless of the existence of a relevant article. SellymeTalk\n\nWe need a comment in tennis draws mentioning that the winner's tie-break score has to be included, as I've added them in to about 25 articles, and every week a majority of them are reverted. It's normally a fairly simple exercise to revert and undo these edits, but a simple comment such as <!-- Remember to include the tie-break score of both participants, not just the loser as per this. --> SellymeTalk\n\nI keep trying to put them back but I may not be watching all the same articles as you. It's usually one or two people who keep messing with them and I try to let them know on their talk pages. I guess it's just one of those things we have to stay on top of to the best of our ability. You're doing a good job and I'm not sure those that revert you will bother reading the comments. :-( Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nYeah, I've seen you comment on talk pages of users I monitor as well. Another issue is people adding redundant </sup> and ''' codes, when the new parameter makes them redundant. SellymeTalk\n\nI didn't notice that. Is that now standard wiki policy to not include the ending </sup> and '''? I always add them out of habit but if it's now advised against I'll change my tune. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nWell, it's not needed, and causes less accidental mistakes so I generally remove them to lessen page size when I'm adding tie-break scores. SellymeTalk\n\nI checked out Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_(superscripts_and_subscripts) and it says to include the </sup>. It obviously works in some tables not to use it (as you've shown) but they tinker with wiki code updates and html updates all the time. What happens if wikipedia make a change \"assuming\" the code has been written in traditional html and now those draws turn into something funky? Before I change my ways of doing it I need to see something that says it is now correct per MOS. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nIt says nothing about tables and places where it defaults though. However, even with the </sup> there, almost every tennis article on the site uses only a starting bold, not an ending, so I'm presuming removal of redundant code is the general consensus. I'm fairly sure the people in charge of the code would know the consequences of their actions before deciding to change the entire site. SellymeTalk\n\nSo, as per WP:TENSCR, how does reporting tennis scores in regular text work? I know it says something about reporting scores in prose, but it's not too clear. I see scores everywhere reported like the following: 7â€“5, 6â€“3, 7â€“6(4). I've always reported scores in that fashion because I've always seen them written in that fashion, whether in tennis player biographies, results pages, day-by-day summaries, etc. Does this mean that all scores must be reported like the following? : 7â€“5, 6â€“3, 7â€“6(7â€“4)? Because that makes for a lot of work in changing pages upon pages of already-written tennis results and, in my opinion, it is a little confusing. Prayerfortheworld (talk)\n\nMy recollection was that recording the tiebreak score in prose was not necessary... leaving it at 7-6 was just fine. However we should not record it as just 7-6(4) because many people read these articles (not just tennis fans) and not everyone understands what that (4) means. More and more pages are being slowly converted (you're right, it is a lot of work) and no one expects it to be done overnight. However newly created pages and draws must conform. When I see it done incorrectly I make a note that I'll have to go back and fix it... just like hyphens and ndashes. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\n7â€“6(7â€“5) is preferred to 7â€“6 alone, for obvious reasons, but 7â€“6(5) and 7â€“65 are wrong. Why don't we try to get the word out regarding this, while getting it all done at the same time with a little mini tiebreak-drive? We'll all spend a week or a fortnight fixing as many articles as we can. I've been meaning to find the motivation to keep going. SellymeTalk\n\nA daunting task my friend. Well I just ripped out the following tonight. fixed all the ndash/hyphen problems and tiebreaks. I'd done all the singles pages of the Majors long ago.\n\nList of Australian Open men's doubles champions\n\nList of Australian Open women's doubles champions\n\nList of Australian Open mixed doubles champions\n\nList of French Open men's doubles champions\n\nList o"
