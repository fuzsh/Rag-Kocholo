        "text": "Johannesburg, Oct 3 (ANI): Former US Open Champion Juan Martin del Potro has paid tribute to fellow Argentine David Nalbandian, after the one-time top-three player announced his decision to retire from tennis due to injury. According to Sport24, Nalbandian, perhaps best known for a stirring five-set comeback victory against Roger Federer in the 2005 Tennis Masters Cup final, hung up his racquet because of a persistent right shoulder problem. The gritty 31-year-old, winner of 11 ATP Tour titles, had slipped to 231st in the world rankings after another injury-hit season, the report said. Del Potro said that on his day, Nalbandian could beat anyone, adding that he remembered when he reached the final at Wimbledon and tennis had lost a really talented player from the tour. Nalbandian had called the decision 'difficult' when he made the announcement earlier, the report added. He had said that it was a sad day but his shoulder couldn't cope any more at the highest level. He will play a final exhibition match against Rafa Nadal on November 23 in Buenos Aires, the report further said. Nalbandian, who reached his career-high three in the world in 2006, also inspired Argentina to three Davis Cup finals, although they lost all of them, according to the report. (ANI)"
