        "text": "A Los Angeles man accused of killing three homeless men as they slept and another person in their home last year pleaded not guilty Monday to murder and other charges, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office.\n\nJerrid Joseph Powell, 33, was charged in December with four counts of murder, one count of residential robbery and one count of being a felon with a firearm. He also faces special circumstances including multiple murders and murder in the course of a robbery, according to a criminal complaint.\n\nCNN has reached out to Powell’s attorney for comment. Powell, who is being held without bail, is scheduled to have a preliminary hearing April 24, the district attorney’s office said.\n\nPowell was arrested November 30 in connection with the fatal shooting of a man in a home during a robbery. Investigators using surveillance technology then linked Powell to the killings that same week of the three men in Los Angeles, the city’s Police Chief Michel Moore has said.\n\nWhen Powell first appeared in court in December, the Los Angeles County Public Defender’s Office said in a statement to CNN: “As with every client, we are committed to presenting a vigorous defense for Mr. Powell and holding the prosecution to their burden of proof.”\n\nThe killings targeted some of the city’s most vulnerable residents as police believe the suspect shot the men as they slept on sidewalks or in alleys – one near Skid Row – in Los Angeles, home to one of the nation’s largest homeless populations. The spree prompted the city to deploy hundreds of workers and partners to warn unhoused residents a killer was still on the loose.\n\nThe first killing happened around 3 a.m. Sunday, November 26, in an alley; the second occurred the next day shortly before 5 a.m.; and a third person was killed Wednesday around 2:30 a.m, police said. The victims were two Hispanic men, ages 37 and 52, and a 62-year-old Black man, according to police.\n\nIn the other killing, Powell is accused of following Nicholas Simbolon, 42 to his home in San Dimas, robbing the father of two inside his garage and fatally shooting him, according to the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department. Officials do not believe Powell had any prior connection to Simbolon.\n\nInvestigators recovered a gun authorities believe was used in the robbery, police have said.\n\nPeople experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles already face dangerous conditions every day, Mayor Karen Bass said in December, noting four to five unhoused people die each day due to a range of causes, including violence."
