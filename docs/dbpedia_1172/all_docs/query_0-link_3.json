        "text": "85 Marc Anthony and his kitty are back, but their blissful home is disrupted by the arrival of Claude the Cat, who likes to beat up on kitty and basically frames Marc Anthony to get him thrown out of the house. Most of the cartoon is Marc Anthony thinking of ways to get his mitts on Claude to pound the stuffing out of him. The douche owner of the house gets no comeuppance.\n\nAnimated well I suppose, but this one just strikes me as so repetitive and one-note, and it's characters that don't really click with me at all, so there's very little sense of investment going on here. It makes the whole thing feel a lot longer than it is for me.\n\nI don’t really have anything particular to say about this one. It’s very standard but even standard Chuck Jones is still great to watch. I’ll probably have a lot more to say about this one in my commentary with Anthony and Eli soon though.\n\nStarring Claude, Marc Anthony and Pussyfoot.\n\nStarring 3 of the unsung heroes of the Looney Tunes roster. Some great visual gags here with minimal dialogue. What Chuck Jones does best and when Looney Tunes are at their peak.\n\nThis short is available on the Platinum Collection Vol 1.\n\nThis is the third cartoon with Marc Anthony and Pussyfoot, adding Claude Cat to the mix with Marc defending the cute little kitten from Claude's bullying. Their owner perceives Marc as the aggressor and beats him mercilessly. I wish all three would find common ground and rise up against their master to skin him alive, but I guess I'm just in a punk horror kind of mood this morning.\n\n• An odd one: it feels like each Marc Antony/Pussyfoot entry strays further away from what made FEED THE KITTY so uniquely wonderful. This one just feels strangely mean-spirited - I don't think the Marc Antony/Pussyfoot dynamic really needs a villain, and seeing Claude get beaten senseless over and over gets rather repetitive because there's not a ton in the way of inventiveness each time this iterates.\n\nCreating a battle between Claude Cat and Marc Anthony is a fun choice, especially with them sort of fighting over Pussyfoot.\n\nClaude is a fun enough villain for them, and it’s so easy to root against him with how cruel he is to Pussyfoot. His final defeat is a bit extreme though, and possibly the funniest moment."
