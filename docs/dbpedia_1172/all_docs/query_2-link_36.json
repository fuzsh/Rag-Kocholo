        "text": "Pet Travel to a foreign country can be complex and time-consuming. Before you start the process, you will need to know the following: the type of animal traveling, the destination country, the date of departure from the United States, and whether or not the pet will be traveling alone, as cargo, or with a person in the cabin of the plane.\n\nDetermine whether your animal qualifies as a pet. A pet is a privately-owned companion animal not intended for research or resale and includes the following animal groups only:\n\nDogs, Cats, Ferrets, Rabbits, Rodents, Hedgehog/Tenrecs, Reptiles, Amphibians, and Pet Birds (non-poultry).\n\nBirds considered poultry include chickens, doves, ducks, geese, grouse, guinea fowl, partridges, pea fowl, pheasants, pigeons, quail, swans, and turkeys).\n\nIf your animal is not one of the types listed above or considered poultry, it does not qualify as a pet. View the requirements for exporting non-pet animals.\n\nWhat are the requirements to take my pet from the United States to another country?\n\nWork with the pet’s veterinarian to determine the destination country’s requirements, including any necessary vaccinations, tests, or treatments. We recommend creating a schedule to make sure all requirements are met within the specified timeframe.\n\nEvery country has its own set of health requirements for pets that may require your pet to get a microchip, specific vaccinations, or undergo certain tests. The requirements pages provide essential information for civilians, military service members, brokers, pet shipping companies, and accredited veterinarians.\n\nUse the Worksheet list to capture the information needed to plan for the pet’s trip and complete the process for obtaining a health certificate.\n\nPet Owner Worksheet for Preparing Visit with Accredited Veterinarian to Complete Health Certificate (103.1 KB)\n\nWhat is a USDA Accredited Veterinarian?\n\nA USDA Accredited Veterinarian has completed formal training from the National Veterinary Accreditation Program (NVAP) in the state(s) they are licensed to practice medicine in. Accreditation is state-specific and is voluntary (not all veterinarians are accredited).\n\nHow do I find a USDA Accredited Veterinarian to complete my animal's health certificate?\n\nUse the drop-down menu below to select your destination country and view their requirements. Country requirements can change frequently. Be sure to verify your destination’s requirements every time you plan to travel with your pet.\n\nHow do I Get My Pet's Health Certificate Endorsed by USDA?\n\nIf the destination country requires a USDA-endorsed (countersigned and embossed/stamped) health certificate, work with your accredited veterinarian to complete, sign, and date the health certificate. The accredited veterinarian should submit the certificate to the USDA Endorsement Office in the Veterinary Export Health Certification System (VEHCS) on your behalf or provide the paperwork to you to submit to the USDA Endorsement Office.\n\nImportant\n\nMost health certificates become valid the day the accredited veterinarian signs it, so make sure yours is issued within your destination country’s required timeframe. The original endorsed hard copy health certificate must accompany your pet to the destination country.\n\nOption 1: Use VEHCS to submit the Health Certificate\n\n(Accredited Veterinarians can access VEHCS on your behalf).\n\nChoose Option 1 or Option 2, not both.\n\nOption 2: Ship the Paperwork to USDA\n\nChoose Option 1 or Option 2, not both.\n\nYour submission must include:\n\nInternational health certificate\n\nVaccination certificates (if vaccination required by the destination country)\n\nTest results for laboratory tests (if required by the destination country)\n\nImport permit (if required by the destination country)\n\nPayment (See below for fees and how to submit payment)\n\nPre-paid express shipping label if USDA APHIS’s digital endorsement is not accepted by the destination country (See below for more information)\n\nYour submission must include:\n\nThe ORIGINAL International health certificate\n\nVaccination certificates (if vaccination required by the destination country)\n\nTest results for laboratory tests (if required by the destination country)\n\nImport permit (if required by the destination country)\n\nPayment (See below for fees and how to submit payment)\n\nPre-paid express shipping label (See below for more information)\n\nInclude The Pet Owners Checklist for Shipping Health Certificate(s) to a USDA Endorsement Office to be sure you have all required paperwork in your shipping package\n\nGive adequate time and proper planning for the endorsement of your health certificate. Incomplete submissions or incorrect information on health certificates will cause endorsement delays until the USDA Accredited Veterinarian or the owner/exporter of the animal can correct the problem. Endorsement of a correctly completed health certificate can take upwards of 3 business days.\n\nEndorsement Fees and Payment Options\n\nThere are fees for USDA to endorse your health certificate. Learn more about the Cost to Endorse Your Pet's Health Certificate (USDA fees).\n\nPayment options using the Veterinary Export Health Certification System (VEHCS): For health certificates submitted in VEHCS, your USDA Accredited Veterinarian must ensure that payment is provided by either depositing money in the VEHCS account or by providing a USDA APHIS User Fee Credit Account in the submission.\n\nPayment options when shipping the health certificate to USDA: For health certificates submitted by express shipping, payment may be made by using the following acceptable methods of payments:\n\nUSDA APHIS User Fee Credit Account\n\nCheck or Money Order (made payable to USDA)\n\nCredit or Debit Card: For payment of health certificates submitted by overnight shipping, please use the credit card information sheet (90 KB) to provide your credit or debit card information.\n\nIf you have questions about the cost of the endorsement of a health certificate, payment method, or if the pet is traveling to multiple countries, please contact your USDA Endorsement Office.\n\nPayment Exemption for Service Animals\n\nThere is no endorsement fee for service animals (dogs) belonging to individuals with disabilities as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Although USDA APHIS recognizes the importance of all animals in their owners’ lives, health certificate endorsement fees apply to emotional support animals and any other animal not officially covered by the ADA."
