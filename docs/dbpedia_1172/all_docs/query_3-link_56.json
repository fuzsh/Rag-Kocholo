        "text": "A magically gifted con artist must gather her estranged mother's old crew for a once-in-a-lifetime heist, from the New York Times bestselling author of Stranger Things: Suspicious Minds.\n\n\"Romantic, clever, and makes grand larceny more fun than ever.\" Holly Black, New York Times bestselling author of Book of Night\n\nDani Poissant is the daughter and former accomplice of the world's most famous art thief. There was no job too big for Maria and her loyal crew. The secret to their success? A little thing called magic, kept rigorously secret from the non-magical world. They seemed unstoppable…until a teenage Dani turned her mother over to the FBI.\n\nTen years later, with Maria still in prison, Dani finds herself approached for a job that only Maria and her crew could pull off…if any of them were still speaking to her. But it's the job of a lifetime and might just be the lure Dani needs to reconcile with her mother and be reunited with her mother's old gang — including both the love of her life and her former best friend.\n\nThe problem is, it's an impossible task — even with the magical talents of the people she once considered family backing her up. It's a heist that needs a year to plan, and Dani has just over a week. Worse, the more Dani learns, the more she understands that there's far more at stake in this job than she ever realized."
