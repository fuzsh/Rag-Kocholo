        "text": "The first step towards helping your pet is contacting your local vet. Although it can feel awkward to talk about money, it's good to speak honestly with your vet about what you can afford as there may be alternative options.\n\nYour vet should be able to give advice on how best to help your pet but if unable to, there are other options to consider depending on your circumstance and location. Options can sometimes be offered at a reduced cost, free through some pet insurance providers and your vet may provide treatment directly.\n\nIf you're worried about money, you may be tempted to use home remedies or ask people without a professional vet's qualification for help. Unfortunately, many common human products and medications can be very harmful when used on pets. For example, paracetamol is highly toxic to cats and ibuprofen is very toxic to cats and dogs. Complications can be serious and lead to vet costs much higher than the original concern. In some cases, it can result in the loss of the pet, as symptoms may not be seen until serious damage has been done.\n\nWell-meaning people, who are not professionally trained, may also offer you pet health advice and this type of advice may not be suitable or safe to use on your pet for reasons only a trained vet would know.\n\nThis is why it's very important to speak to your vet practice if you notice a change in your pet's health or behaviour. Getting your pet to the vet quickly tends to lower the long-term cost of vet bills, as well as helping improve your pet's wellbeing sooner.\n\nCosts can vary for the same medication, so it's worth asking your vet if they can write a prescription to use online or bring it to a pharmacy where the price may be lower. Pharmacies that buy very large amounts of medications at a time can often put a lower price tag for each one. But many vet clinics are small businesses, they cannot buy this larger amount of medication and use it all before it expires.\n\nYour vet will need to charge for writing the prescription and this goes to the cost of running their clinic, but buying some medication this way can still reduce your overall costs.\n\nThere could be other treatment options your vet can offer. Lower-cost treatments can offer good results but these options may come with less certainty or with more risks than the higher-cost alternatives. This is something your vet can explain to you. The more recent advances in medicine and equipment come with an increased cost, and on a low budget, the sort of things you might see on the TV probably won't be available. But there may still be an option that might help your pet feel better.\n\nPeople's Dispensary for Sick Animals (PDSA) provides low-cost and free vet care to the sick and injured pets of people in need.\n\nDogs Trust offers free and reduced-cost vet assistance for people who are in housing crises or are homeless."
