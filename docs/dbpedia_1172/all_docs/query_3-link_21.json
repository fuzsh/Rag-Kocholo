        "text": "Cat Feud is a 1958 Merrie Melodies short directed by Chuck Jones.\n\nTitle[]\n\nThe title is a play on \"cat food,\" and the feud or fight between the cat and dog.\n\nPlot[]\n\nMarc Anthony is a bulldog working at a construction site. He finds a kitten named Pussyfoot, to whom he gives a wiener. Claude Cat sees Pussyfoot and attempts to take the wiener away from her. To defend the kitten, Marc Anthony gets enraged and fights the cat on the steal beams of a construction building.\n\nTelevision Airings[]\n\nBugs Bunny and Friends (1970s)\n\nThe Bugs Bunny & Tweety Show[1]\n\nSeason 6, Episode 4, along with \"Hyde and Hare\", \"A Mouse Divided\", \"Hare-Less Wolf\", \"Beanstalk Bunny\", \"A Broken Leghorn\", \"Hot Cross Bunny\", and \"The Jet Cage\". (29 September 1990)\n\nSeason 7, Episode 4 along with \"High Diving Hare\", \"A Fractured Leghorn\", \"Knights Must Fall\", \"Hare-Breadth Hurry\", \"There They Go-Go-Go!\", and \"A Pizza Tweety-Pie\" (3 October 1992)\n\nSeason 7, Episode 19 along with \"High Diving Hare\", \"Cats A-weigh!\", \"Hare Brush\", \"Sugar and Spies\", \"Tree Cornered Tweety\", and \"Upswept Hare\" (16 January 1993)\n\nAvailability[]\n\nStreaming[]\n\nCensorship[]\n\nVersions of this cartoon that aired on ABC's The Bugs Bunny & Tweety Show:[2]\n\nReplaced the scene of Marc Anthony repeatedly punching Claude Cat in the face with a still shot of Pussyfoot the kitten sleeping, though the edit was clumsily done, as most of Marc Anthony punching Claude was left in and the part where Marc Anthony kicks Claude after punching him wasn't censored.\n\nShortened the part where Claude Cat makes Marc Anthony hit himself on the head with the I-beam he's clinging to from six hits to two.\n\nNotes[]\n\nThis cartoon marks the final appearances of Marc Anthony and Pussyfoot.\n\nThis is the first appearance of Claude Cat since \"No Barking\", and he would make one last appearance in 1962 (as Pierre) in the short \"Louvre Come Back to Me!\"\n\nClaude is also heavily redesigned differently from his earlier appearances.\n\nThis short also marks the return of the musicians, who were absent from the previous 7 shorts due to a large Musician's Strike.\n\nUnlike other cartoons, Marc Anthony has grey fur in this cartoon (much like Hector) instead of brown fur as in other appearances.\n\nBecause of this, some viewers often mistake Marc Anthony for Hector in this short, given that both bulldogs have similar appearances. This bulldog confusion is even acknowledged in an episode of Toon in with Me on MeTV as well.\n\nThe start of this cartoon is very similar to \"Feed the Kitty\". Also, unlike previous cartoons such as \"Kiss Me Cat\" and \"Feline Frame-Up\", this cartoon presumes that Marc Anthony and Pussyfoot have never met before.\n\nThis was the final cartoon released in 1958.\n\nGallery[]"
