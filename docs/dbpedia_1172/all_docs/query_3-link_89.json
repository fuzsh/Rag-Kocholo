        "text": "Size: Carrier must be large enough for your pet to stand up fully without their ears touching the top of the carrier, and be able to turn around and lie down freely in a normal, comfortable position, and prevent them from putting any part of their body outside the carrier. The following carrier sizes are acceptable for travel in the baggage compartment:\n\nKennel size chart Size Carrier size Dimensions (length x width x height) Extra small 100 21\" x 16\" x 15\" Small 200 27\" x 20\" x 19\" Medium 300 32\" x 22\" x 23\" Large 400 36\" X 24\" x 26\" Extra large 500 40\" x 27\" x 30\"\n\nExamples of acceptable space for pet in carrier Examples of insufficient space for pet in carrier\n\nPet bowls: A food and water dish must be attached to the inside of the carrier. We are happy to feed your pet (without having to open the carrier door) with the food you provide.\n\nExample of acceptable food and water dish\n\nBedding: Carrier must be clean and leak-proof with absorbent bedding that is safe and non-toxic to the animal. Shredded paper and absorbent pads are acceptable.\n\nConstruction:\n\nCarrier must be constructed of solid material suitable for air transportation including handles or handholds that allow the carrier to be lifted without tipping. Carriers that are collapsible, soft-sided, constructed with cardboard or wicker, composed of mesh or wire, or that have a snap-top will not be accepted.\n\nExample of acceptable handle\n\nCarrier must be constructed only with original parts or standard replacement parts and be free of cracks, damage, sharp points or edges, or any protrusions that may injure the animal. Carriers that use zip ties, duct tape, or rubber bands to construct the frame will not be accepted.\n\nCarriers with wheels must have the wheels removed or the carrier will not be accepted.\n\nFor carriers with multipiece construction, top and bottom sections must be secured with nuts and bolts. Carriers with sections secured by twist, slide, or snap fasteners will not be accepted.\n\nExample of acceptable nut and bolt fastener\n\nVentilation: Carrier must provide air ventilation and have a solid roof. Ventilation slots are permitted in the roof if structural integrity remains intact. All ventilation slots must be constructed with bars or another sturdy material suitable for air transportation. Carriers without structurally sound ventilation and carriers that have a plastic or fabric covering such as a tarp or crate cover will not be accepted.\n\nSecurity: Carrier must be escape-proof with one metal grated door closed securely and fastened with releasable zip ties (Alaska can supply) around the door and frame, utilizing only holes from the original carrier construction. Carriers with a plastic door or a door that is secured by a lock will not be accepted.\n\nRegulations: Carrier must meet all USDA and IATA carrier requirements.\n\nFood and water for checked animals\n\nRegulations require animals traveling as checked baggage to have been offered food and water within 4 hours of check-in (5-6 hours prior to scheduled flight departure).\n\nAnimals must be offered sufficient food and water to last the entire journey.\n\nGuests with a connection of 4 or more hours must request access to their animal in the connection city to offer additional food and water.\n\nThe guest is responsible to re-check the animal in the connection city and provide the paid receipt when rechecking the animal.\n\nTransfers and delays\n\nIf your trip includes a transfer to another flight operated by Alaska Airlines, Horizon Air or SkyWest Flight Series 3300-3499, we allow a maximum connection time of 4 hours for the animal at the connection city.\n\nAlaska Airlines does not transfer pets to other airlines. If your trip includes a transfer to any other airline, you must allow time to pick up your pet in the baggage claim area and re-check your pet with the connecting airline.\n\nIf a delay prevents your pet's flight from departing, your pet may be placed in a carrier facility until it can be transported. Costs incurred due to weather-related delays are the responsibility of the pet owner.\n\nPet embargoes Breed restrictions\n\nBrachycephalic or \"short-nosed\" dogs and cats are not accepted for travel in the baggage compartment on Alaska Airlines flights (including flights operated by Horizon and SkyWest). Veterinary experts say that short-nosed animals commonly have abnormalities that can compromise their breathing. Stress associated with flight can make those conditions worse.\n\nBrachycephalic or \"short-nosed\" dogs and cats may still travel in the cabin with their passenger provided their pet carrier fits under the seat.\n\nBaggage compartment restrictions apply to the following breeds and mixed breeds thereof:\n\nDogs: American Pit Bull, American Staffordshire Terrier, Boston Terrier, Boxer, Brussels Griffon, Mastiff (All Breeds), Bulldog, Bull Terrier, Chow Chow, Dutch Pug, English Bulldog, English Toy Spaniel, French Bulldog, Japanese Boxer, Japanese Pug, Japanese Spaniel, Pekingese, Pug, Shih Tzu, Staffordshire Bull Terrier\n\nCats: Burmese, Exotic Shorthair, Himalayan, Persian\n\nExtreme outdoor temperatures\n\nExtreme hot and cold temperatures can pose a health risk to pets. In summer, choose early morning or late evening flights. In winter, choose mid-day flights. Whenever possible, book nonstop or direct flights. If temperatures at the origin, destination, or connecting airports exceed certain limits, Alaska Airlines may decline acceptance for the animal's welfare.\n\nPreparing for traveling with a pet in the baggage compartment"
