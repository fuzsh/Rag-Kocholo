        "text": "Update 7/23/2024\n\nPC: 1.108.289.1030 / Mac: 1.108.289.1230\n\nConsole: 1.94\n\nSul Sul, Simmers! We’re lovestruck to share this abundance of new Base Game features and pack fixes!\n\nWhat’s New in The Sims 4 ?\n\nAll for Love\n\nRomantic Boundaries\n\nReal life relationships are nuanced and complex! Romantic Boundaries bring some of that into The Sims 4 by enabling you to define the conditions under which your Sims become jealous. These live in Create a Sim alongside the “Gender” and “Sexual Orientation” options in the Identity Panel and you can change them at any point in time.\n\nDoes your Sim become Jealous from Non-Physical Romance?\n\nNon-Physical Romance consists of social interactions that do not involve physical touch. Examples: flirting and complimenting appearance\n\nDoes your Sim become Jealous from Physical Romance?\n\nPhysical Romance consists of socials that do involve physical touch. Examples: Kissing and holding hands\n\nDoes your Sim become Jealous from WooHoo?\n\nThis applies to WooHoo for Young Adults and older and Mess Around for Teens.\n\nIs your Sim open to changing the factors that cause them to become Jealous?\n\n“Yes” means the Sim can be asked in Live Mode to reconsider their feelings surrounding Jealousy for the settings above.\n\nThe defaults for all of these will be “Yes” for Sims in your existing games so that you can be the one to decide if you want different behavior. New Sims that the game makes can run the spectrum!\n\nHiding Relationships\n\nAs your Sims are dating or simply going about their daily lives, their Relationship Panel will accumulate more and more Sims. Tired of it being cluttered with random Sims that you met once and have no desire to meet again? Or have an ex that you want to scrub from your contacts? Well, good news! Now you can remove those Sims (who are not members of your household) by selecting them in the Relationship Panel and selecting “Hide Relationship”. Make room for the Sims who really matter!\n\nNeutral Relationship Names\n\nThe language for Sims’ relationships now is more neutral to be more inclusive.\n\n“Husband / Wife” → “Spouse”\n\n“Fiancé / Fiancée” → “Engaged”\n\n“Boyfriend/Girlfriend” → “Partner”\n\nOne place where you can see this is in Create a Sim. Select the “Identity” button (it looks like three dots) and go to the Household Relationships Panel.\n\nPartner Status\n\nPreviously, the Partners relationship could only be established through gameplay. Now you can set it within Create a Sim between two Sims in your household!\n\nCreate a Sim\n\nEyelashes\n\nEyelashes now have their own category! As you all know, some eye shapes have eyelashes as part of them. Now, Sims can have separate eyelashes applied independently from the shape of the eye! And since they are in their own category, they also are compatible with other accessories such as glasses and piercings. The base game includes two styles of lashes for a more dramatic look for your Sims! Seriously! It’s for everyone. For free. Today. Right now!\n\n“Apply to All Outfits” Button\n\nThe days of manually finding and selecting the same accessory, makeup, hat, hair, top, bottom, full-body outfit, or footwear for each outfit are gone! Now you can hit this single button to apply the item to every outfit at once! Love that makeup look you just perfected in your Sim’s Everyday style? Now you can apply it to multiple categories! Found the perfect pair of pants for your party outfit, but applied it to Everyday by accident? You can also select specific categories to copy to, as well! This works on all ages and with all types of Occult Sims. We can’t believe it either. Is today the best day ever?!\n\nNote: Currently, the Apply All Button adds the selected item to your Sim’s outfits. It does not remove outfit pieces - only adds or replaces.\n\nWe look forward to any feedback you might have on this new feature, so we can continue to improve it to meet your CAS needs in future releases!\n\nUpdated Hairstyles\n\nIs that a new hairstyle or are you just happy to see me? Yes, we are happy to see you and, yes, it is new hair!\n\nDark and Lovely Hairstyle Partnership\n\nAnd there’s even more hair! Part two of The Sims 4 collaboration with Dark and Lovely arrives in this update with two color variants of the new loc braids. Check out Dark & Lovely’s - Play In Color, a campaign that champions diversity and inclusion and spotlights the game changers who are redefining the rules in the games industry.\n\nFrench Tips, Coffin Nails, and Neutral Palettes\n\nWe’re excited to bring more nail styles and color palettes! There are new designs for French Tips and Coffin Nails to add flair to your fingertips. We’ve also added more color palettes for everyone to express themselves more freely! A whole new series of nude nails is also available to provide an extensive selection to match natural nail beds.\n\nBuild Mode: Curved Pools\n\nNow your pools can have rounded corners! Curved Pools work like Curved Walls—place a corner piece and adjust the sides. Mix and match with regular corners—let your imagination run wild! There also is a new pool light, Oblong Wall Light, that works perfectly on curved pool walls!\n\nLive Mode\n\nRelationship Interactions\n\nA new “Relationship…” category in the Interaction menu now contains actions across the Base Game and a number of packs that directly relate to relationship status such as “Ask to Join Household” or “Become Best Friends”.\n\nSafe Music Streaming\n\nThe Music section of Game Options now has a “Safe for Steaming” toggle to play only the music that is safe for streaming The Sims 4! When this is checked, you don’t have to worry about your stream or video running into music copyright issues. We’ll be adding more music with streaming-friendly licensing as time goes on.\n\nNeighborhood Stories\n\nNeighborhood Stories now has two new options within Manage Households: Friendship Changes and Romance Changes. This enables Sims in other households to start and end those types of relationships on their own. You can use the mailbox each day to “Check Recent Neighborhood Stories” for news such as Sims your household knows becoming best friends, breaking up, or getting back together.\n\nConversation Panel\n\nWe gave a new coat of paint to improve the usability of that panel that appears at the top of the screen when your active Sim is in a conversation! Did you know you can do all these things with it?\n\nSelect the Sims’ portraits to see…\n\ntheir mood\n\ntheir relationship levels (regular and romantic) with your Sim\n\nSelect the book icon to see that Sim’s Sentiment with your Sim\n\nBug Fixes\n\nBase Game / Multipack\n\nTop Fixes\n\nToddlers now receive Top Notch and Happy Reward Traits after reaching the required Skill levels. Leave no Toddler behind!\n\nStair Railings no longer disappear when one tile is placed next to a one tile room.\n\nWhen Sims change their mind about how they are walking to somewhere, they no longer teleport to their final destination.\n\nSims who are not part of the Date interrupt conversations less often.

The same goes for nails with various outfits.\n\nSeveral nose rings now fit properly (yfAfrican09_Nose, yuAcc_NoseLeftGP12RingDouble_Black, yuAcc_NoseLeftEP09Ring_Silver, yuAcc_NoseRightGP12RingDouble_Black, andyuAcc_NoseRightEP09Ring_Silver). Pierce to your heart's content.\n\nWe smoothed out the frame rate stuttering that sometimes occurred a few minutes after launching the game.\n\nLive Mode\n\nSims in a relationship will no longer receive unsolicited autonomous flirtations from other Sims, unless they have the Noncommittal Trait, of course.\n\nSims will Dance if the radio is turned on and playing music, but they'll save their dance moves if the radio is turned off.\n\nEnchanting and Flirty interactions are now only available for Sims who are compatible with the active Sim's orientation.\n\nMarried Sims no longer receive a Want to flirt with Sims who are not their spouse.\n\nTeen Sims will no longer feel jealous around a previous Teen romantic partner who has become a Young Adult.\n\nJealousy was getting ahead of itself! Those jealousy buffs were wrongly calling an engaged Sim a spouse. We've calmed things down and fixed the mix-up!\n\nUpon learning a Sim's WooHoo interest and opening their Sim Profile, the Sim Profile will no longer say “No One“ even when the sim has a WooHoo interest in Men/Women.\n\nThe Knowledge of a Sim's Sexual Orientation and their Sim Profile will now remove outdated information when that Sim changes their Sexual Orientation in Create a Sim.\n\nThe need for fun won't stop a Sim from enjoying their meal—they'll finish eating before fulfilling their fun needs.\n\nWhen multitasking two books being read, the Sim will no longer skip the first book. Now they will read it, put it away, and then go for the second book.\n\n“Make a Move“ now is available between Sims whose marriage was established in Create a Sim.\n\nIf a Sim is rejected after asking another Sim on a date, a notification will be given on why they were turned down.\n\nGhost Sims are now available for “Ask on Date...“ from the Relationship Panel.\n\nBoth the Host Sim and the Sim's date can contribute to the main date goal with one another. Before, only the Host Sim could accomplish the goal.\n\nIf a Sim heads off to work or school during an Event, the Event will come to an end. Duty calls!\n\nPlanning a Stay Over during an Event at the Sim’s home will bring the Event to a successful close. Time to kick back and relax!\n\nIf a Discovery Quest appears during an Event, the Event progress bar will not reset if the Discovery Quest is canceled.\n\nIf a Discovery Quest appears during an Event that has Goals and Rewards, your Sims now keep their Event titles and the progress remains visible.\n\nSims will be able to “Ask on Date...“ without the need for Romantic Relationship. That won't stop Sims from rejecting the date proposal if things are off though.\n\nWhen planning an Event, the Plumbob will appear next to the venue choices when scrolling through the available locations.\n\nWhen planning an Event, the selected venue will appear at the top of the selection list if you navigate away and then back to the venue selection.\n\nWhen planning an Event, Sims that are preselected will now count as a single entry rather than not being counted.\n\nWhen planning an Event on console, the tooltip will now inform that a Sim is being changed from a Guest to a Hired Role. Additionally, a tooltip will appear if the Sim being hired for a Role has work scheduled during the Event.\n\nWhen planning an Event on console, the location image will not appear in the description section of the planning page. Just the description text will appear.\n\nWhen setting up an Event, the checkmark for each phase such as “Invite Sims” now is on the right side of the button for easier reading.\n\nA Sim now can learn about another Sim's financial status when they “Get to Know“ that Sim.\n\nLips are synced so that Sims making out keep their lips on their kissing partner.

Gotta show off the bucks with a bang.\n\nThe contrast and font color have been improved for better readability in the Styled Looks section of Create a Sim.\n\nGallery Server\n\nViewing creations from Followers should return results more quickly (internet speeds allowing) so you can get straight into browsing all of their shared creations.\n\nBlocked players no longer show up in the Gallery searches.\n\nSimmers on PlayStation and Xbox can see their Profile Showcase uploads in the Gallery again.\n\nGet to Work\n\nScheduling Events from the Calendar while in Sixam no longer is available—seems like there's no signal here!\n\nPosing for a picture will look fabulous without creepy zombie teeth cutting into your face.\n\nGet Together\n\nClosets built into walls once again allow your Sims to “WooHoo“ and “Try For Baby.“ Get Together indeed!\n\nSims will no longer ignore your desire to “Make Out with...“ when using the Get Together closets: Perfect Size Closet, Squaring it Square, and Fashionista’s Closet.\n\nPronouns on the notification for acquiring the Dance Skill and asking about another Sim are now correct.\n\nCity Living\n\nRounded decks, walls, platforms, pools, and fountains can now be placed in Apartments in San Myshuno.\n\nCats & Dogs\n\nA Sim without the Cat Lover Trait who is watching the sky from the picnic table with another Sim who has that Trait will not spontaneously stare elsewhere besides their partner and the sky.\n\nA Sim with the Cat Lover Trait will no longer slide in animations when sitting close with another Sim.\n\nInteractions for collecting Cat and Dog hair piles are more performant.

We were waiting for Residential Rentals to high-rise to the occasion and now they're ready to be built to your specifications.\n\nThe name of the Residential Rental lot will stop reverting back to its default name.\n\nThe amount of Rent per Day now can be set with a controller on console.\n\nHouseholds that do not use utilities such as power and water and owe zero Simoleons will not receive messages that threaten utility shutoff.\n\nWhen the Property Owner is visiting a Tenant unit on the same residential property, the Sim Picker specifies “Visit Unit...“ rather than displaying “Go Home...“\n\nDeleting and then undoing the deletion of a shared unit wall in a Residential Rental lot that has reached its maximum unit capacity will no longer cause issues with the “Create Unit“ functionality.\n\nVisiting the Property Owner on the same residential property will no longer state that the Property Owner is not home—they can't escape meeting you now!\n\nChanging the name of the Penthouse Residential Rental will also be reflected in the Property Management Interface and the Lot Name headers.\n\n“Sell Residential Rental“ is specifically used to avoid confusion with commercial businesses when selling residential property.\n\nAll versions of Oh So Floral, Oh So Fancy Tile now are shiny.\n\nThe Rent shown now is correct based on the unit size and amenities.\n\nWhen renting a residential unit, a tooltip now specifies “Rent Unit“ before confirming the rental, similar to renting an apartment.\n\nTenants and Property Owners can now find each other in the Business filter of the Relationships Panel.\n\nThe ability to increase and decrease the panel height on console is now available for the Owned Business Panel.\n\nThe Unit Selection display for Residential Rentals in Manage Worlds now uses the D-Pad instead of L1/R1 (PlayStation) or LB/RB (Xbox) when changing floor level.\n\nSpa Day\n\nShort Round Nails look more natural and match the preview image.\n\nDine Out\n\nSims will drink and eat autonomously when they order both food and drinks at a restaurant. Previously, they would only drink.\n\nSims no longer get stuck when replacing a restaurant they are running with another from the Gallery.\n\nSpecial non-playable Sims (like Michael Bell) are no longer available to be hired for restaurants.\n\nNeighborhood Sims now leave the restaurant after completing the eating of a grand meal and will no longer wait until the restaurant is closed.\n\nWearing the respectable shirt and vest combo (ymTop_GP03Vest) was cutting off circulation, causing a groove to appear around the Sim's fingers. The cuffs have since been loosened and the Sim’s fingers are back to normal.\n\nVampires\n\nOccult rank status for non-household occult Sims can now be seen in the Sim Profile.\n\nStar Wars™: Journey to Batuu\n\nFor galactic safety, scheduling Events from the Calendar while in Batuu no longer is available.\n\nMy Wedding Stories\n\nWedding Cakes now note that only the Sim who plans the event can select the Cake.\n\n“Call off the Wedding“ is available on both the Sim and the wedding arch while performing the vows.

Go eat something else!\n\nSims who travel to Tartosa can now successfully “Get Married to…” their partner at Town Hall.\n\nWe heard that you wanted the option to plan a wedding with the Base Game Wedding Event even when you have My Wedding Stories, so Sims now can choose between “Plan Wedding Event“ from Base Game or “Plan Customized Wedding Event“ from My Wedding Stories when they're ready to get married.\n\nSims now stand instead of sitting on the floor from “Please Take Your Seats“ if there aren't enough chairs.\n\nWerewolves\n\nThe Sweater (ymTop_GP12SweaterDecal) no longer distorts at the arm for male Sims when viewing from a distance.\n\nCrystal Creations\n\nWhen a Sim wears jewelry crafted and charged with the Fire Opal crystal on a Date, completing date goals will count 50% more towards the Date's score.\n\nBust the Dust\n\nThe “Filth Kills the Fun“ Moodlet now has a unique icon all its own, awww.\n\nSims no longer get multiple negative Dust Moodlets at the same time.\n\nIndustrial Loft\n\nThe preview image of the Johnny Zest's Sweet Revenge Sofa faces the same direction as the other couches in Build Mode.\n\nUrban Homage\n\nThe Track Pants (ymBottom_SP50Track and ymBottom_SP50Denim) are now correctly tagged as masculine.\n\nRiviera Retreat"
