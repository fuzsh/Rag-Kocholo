A list of the best Looney Tunesc cartoons is exactly as hard and subjective as it sounds, and so I open the list to the public. Add what you think is missing and vote on what you think are the best. I know it's hard. God, I know. So...much...funny.\n\nMost divisive: Bushy Hare\n\nOver 500 Ranker voters have come together to rank this list of The Best Looney Tunes Cartoons\n\n1\n\nMel Blanc, Arthur Q.

It is the sequel to Rabbit Fire, and the second entry in the \"Hunting trilogy\" directed by Jones and written by Michael Maltese. Produced by Edward Selzer for Warner Bros. Cartoons, Inc., the short was released to theaters on September 20, 1952 by Warner Bros. Pictures and is widely considered among Jones' best and most important films. In Jerry Beck's 1994 book The 50 Greatest Cartoons, Rabbit Seasoning is listed at number thirty.\n\nReleased : 1953\n\nWatch This Show If You Love: Space Jam, Looney Tunes: Back in Action, The Sylvester & Tweety Mysteries, The Road Runner Show, The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Hour\n\nWhy Should I Stream?

Marvin the Martian had been introduced as an unnamed villain in Haredevil Hare playing opposite Bugs Bunny, but this cartoon was the first of many appearances of Duck Dodgers. The cartoon is an extended parody of comic book character Buck Rogers, and especially on one collective title of his adventures in particular, Buck Rogers in the 25th Century. In 1994, it was voted #4 of the 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by members of the animation field. In 2004, it was retrospectively nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.\n\n3\n\nMel Blanc, Arthur Q. Bryan\n\nReleased : 1950\n\nWatch This Show If You Love: Robin Hood Daffy, Hillbilly Hare, Operation Rabbit (Wile E. Coyote Genius & Bugs Bunny), Bully for Bugs Ali Baba Bunny\n\nWhy Should I Stream?

Enjoy the delightful synergy between high culture and timeless humor that makes Rabbit of Seville an enduring masterpiece.\n\nRabbit of Seville is a Warner Bros. Looney Tunes theatrical cartoon short released in 1950. It was directed by Chuck Jones and written by Michael Maltese. The cartoon, in a plotline reminiscent of Stage Door Cartoon, features Bugs Bunny being chased by Elmer Fudd into the stage door of the Hollywood Bowl, whereupon Bugs tricks Elmer into going onstage, and participating in a break-neck operatic production of their chase punctuated with gags and accompanied by musical arrangements by Carl Stalling, focusing on Rossini's overture to The Barber of Seville. Stalling's arrangement is remarkable in that the overture's basic structure is kept relatively intact; some repeated passages are removed and the overall piece is conducted at a faster tempo to accommodate the cartoon's standard running length. In 1994 it was voted #12 of the 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by members of the animation field.\n\nReleased : 1953\n\nWatch This Show If You Love: Rabbit Seasoning, Duck!

This innovative short film pushes the boundaries of traditional storytelling techniques, earning its reputation as one of the greatest cartoons ever created by both critics and fans alike. Witness for yourself why this groundbreaking work continues to endure in popular culture.\n\nDuck Amuck is a surreal animated cartoon directed by Chuck Jones and produced by Warner Bros. Cartoons. The short was released in early 1953 by The Vitaphone Corporation, the short subject division of Warner Bros. Pictures, as part of the Merrie Melodies series. It stars Daffy Duck, who is tormented by a seemingly sadistic, initially unseen animator, who constantly changes Daffy's locations, clothing, voice, physical appearance and even shape. Pandemonium reigns throughout the cartoon as Daffy attempts to steer the action back to some kind of normality, only for the animator to either ignore him or, more frequently, to over-literally interpret his increasingly frantic demands. In the end, the tormenting animator is revealed to be Bugs Bunny. In 1994, it was voted #2 of The 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by members of the animation field, losing only to What's Opera, Doc?, also made by Chuck Jones and also written by Michael Maltese. It remains one of the most notable Warner animations, and has been inducted into the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.\n\n5\n\nMel Blanc, Arthur Q. Bryan\n\nReleased : 1953\n\nWatch This Show If You Love: Duck Amuck, Rabbit Seasoning, What's Opera Doc?, Long-Haired Hare, Baseball Bugs\n\nWhy Should I Stream? Revel in the brilliance of Duck!

Overflowing with quick-witted banter and expertly timed physical comedy, this classic cartoon stands as a shining example of animation prowess at its best. Take pleasure in watching this extraordinary creation that has delighted audiences for generations.\n\nDuck! Rabbit, Duck! is a 1953 Merrie Melodies comedy cartoon, directed by Chuck Jones, and starring Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and Elmer Fudd. It is the sequel to Rabbit Seasoning, and the third and final entry in Jones' \"Hunting trilogy\". Produced by Eddie Selzer for Warner Bros. Cartoons, Inc., the short was released to theaters in 1953 by Warner Bros. Pictures and is widely considered among Jones' best and most important films.

Bryan\n\nReleased : 1957\n\nWatch This Show If You Love: Homeless Hare, Acrobatty Bunny, Forward March, Hare Gee Whiz-z-z-z-z, My Favorite Duck Daffy Slept Here, Bonanza Bunny Hyde and Hare\n\nWhy Should I Stream? What's Opera, Doc? serves up an extraordinary feast for the senses by melding classical music with hilarious antics from some beloved characters in an epic parody performance. Highly regarded for its exceptional artistry, superb orchestral arrangements, and side-splitting humor, this animated short film remains a celebrated piece in popular culture. Relish the opportunity to enjoy this awe-inspiring production that bridges the gap between high art and accessible entertainment.\n\nWhat's Opera, Doc? is a 1957 American animated cartoon short in the Merrie Melodies series, directed by Chuck Jones for Warner Bros. Cartoons. The Michael Maltese story features Elmer Fudd chasing Bugs Bunny through a parody of 19th-century classical composer Richard Wagner's operas, particularly Der Ring des Nibelungen, Der Fliegende Holländer, and Tannhäuser. It borrows heavily from the second opera in the \"Ring Cycle\" Die Walküre, woven around the standard Bugs-Elmer conflict. Originally released to theaters by Warner Bros. on July 6, 1957, What's Opera, Doc? features the speaking and singing voices of Mel Blanc and Arthur Q. Bryan as Bugs and Elmer, respectively. The short is also sometimes informally referred to as ''Kill the Wabbit'' after the line sung by Fudd to the tune of Wagner's \"Ride of the Valkyries\", the opening passage from Act Three of Die Walküre. In 1994, What's Opera, Doc? was voted #1 of the 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by 1,000 members of the animation field."
