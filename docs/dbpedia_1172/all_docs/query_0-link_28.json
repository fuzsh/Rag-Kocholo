        "text": "Estimated reading time is 25 minutes.\n\nMOST INFORMATION on the Internetabout gold and platinum records of the Sixties is crap! That is, most of the “information” regarding RIAA Gold and Platinum Records awarded to albums from the ’60s and early ’70s is factually incorrect. This applies to almost every website: the few that aren’t plain incorrect are often unintentionally misleading, and this includes the RIAA’s own website!\n\nThis article will assist most readers in understanding RIAA Gold and Platinum Record Awards for records issued prior to 1975. 1\n\nThis article addresses the basic criteria that were used by the RIAA for awarding Gold and Platinum Records to singles and albums. The focus is on the awards from 1958 through 1974, during which the criteria remained stable.\n\nThis article looks at the criteria for the RIAA to certify a Gold and Platinum Record Award in the ’50s and ’60s.\n\nA lot of changes have occurred since, especially for albums; this article notes a few but not in the detail it deserves.\n\nThere have been so many changes for the definition of a “unit” when counting multi-record sets that it would require an article of its own\n\nMost websites screw up the information when mentioning Gold Record Awards for albums. Almost without exception, they apply post-1974 standards to pre-1974 Awards and almost always mention numbers of copies sold—usually incorrect or unverified numbers.\n\nOn January 20, 1964, Capitol Records released MEET THE BEATLES, and it sold 750,000 copies in its first week of release, for which it was awarded an RIAA Gold Record. It was just getting started: by the end of March, sales were approaching 3,000,000 copies. By the end of 1964, sales were approaching 4,000,000 copies, and by the end of 1966, sales were approaching 5,000,000 copies! And it kept on selling! (Sales figures courtesy of Joseph Murrells’ book “Million Selling Records – From The 1900s To The 1960s.”)\n\nThe nutshell version of this article\n\nHere are the entire 5,400 words of this article summed up in four statements of fewer than one hundred words:\n\n1. In the ’60s, the RIAA Gold Record Award for albums was based solely on dollar amounts.\n\nPeriod.\n\n2. The number of copies sold was irrelevant.\n\nPeriod.\n\n3. RIAA Platinum Records don’t have to sell a million copies, but a million units—which doesn’t matter because there were no RIAA Platinum Records in the ’60s.\n\nPeriod.\n\nAny time you read a remark that references RIAA Gold or Platinum Record Awards made prior to 1974 that states numbers of copies sold, you’re probably reading a source that don’t know nothin’ ’bout nothin’ ’bout RIAA Gold and Platinum Record Awards.\n\nPeriod.\n\nNow on to the nitty-gritty!\n\nThe 500,000 copies statement\n\nNo record was ever certified for an RIAA Gold Record Award based on “the sale of more than 500,000 copies” in the 1950s or ’60s.\n\nPeriod.\n\nAll RIAA Gold Record Awards were based on sales of one million (1,000,000) copies of a single.\n\nThis photo was taken in October 1963 on the set of the Kissin’ Cousins movie. It was part of a news release that appeared on January 4, 1964, with a caption that read (and I am paraphrasing), “Steve Sholes and Elvis Presley show off new gold record for the million-dollar sales of ELVIS’ CHRISTMAS ALBUM. The LP was first issued in 1959 and has sold over the 100,000 mark each year since.” Like all articles from these years, the dollar amount is mentioned, as that was the basis of the award. This also notes the sales of 100,000 per year, a big number in the pre-Beatles years.\n\nThe RIAA according to the RIAA\n\nEveryone who buys sells, collects, or records knows the initialism “RIAA.” Many do not know exactly what the RIAA does. Here is the introduction to the RIAA that greets one on the organization’s website:\n\n“The Recording Industry Association of America® (RIAA) is the trade organization that supports and promotes the creative and financial vitality of the major music companies.\n\nIts members comprise the most vibrant record industry in the world, investing in great artists to help them reach their potential and connect to their fans.\n\nNearly 85% of all legitimate recorded music produced and sold in the United States is created, manufactured, or distributed by RIAA members.\n\nIn the ’60s, RIAA Gold Records for albums were based solely on dollar amounts; units sold were irrelevant.\n\nIn support of this mission, the RIAA works to protect the intellectual property and First Amendment rights of artists and music labels; conduct consumer, industry and technical research; and monitor and review state and federal laws, regulations and policies.\n\nRIAA also certifies Gold®, Platinum®, Multi-Platinum™, Diamond and Los Premios De Oro y Platino™ sales and streaming awards. Originally conceived to honor artists and track sound recording sales, Gold & Platinum Awards have come to stand as a benchmark of success for any artist.”\n\nBelieve it or not, the RIAA website does not provide any meaningful background or history on the changing criteria of the various awards!\n\nAretha Franklin receiving a pair of RIAA Gold Record Awards from Atlantic Records partner and producer Jerry Wexler. This photo was probably taken in June 1967 and the awards are for Respect and I Never Loved A Man The Way I Love You, the first of her fourteen awards for singles.\n\nA little more of the story\n\nThe RIAA formed in 1952 as a united front representing the interests of the larger record companies. These companies are often referred to as “the major companies,” or simply “the majors” (and yes, it’s a baseball analogy). The work of the organization included oversight of copyright issues, working with various unions, and carrying on research “relating to the record industry and government regulations.”\n\nThe RIAA also established universal standards for such technical aspects of recording as the equalization curve and how stereophonic record grooves should be cut. These were very important issues in the industry at the time.\n\nThis is the award given Glenn Miller by RCA Victor. It uses a gold-plated 78 rpm record from Victor’s subsidiary imprint Bluebird. Note that the basic design of this in-house award served as the blueprint for the RIAA’s Gold Record Award of 1958.\n\nIn-house awards are not fake awards\n\nRecord companies were giving awards to artists for exceptional achievements for years. The first known gold record award was given to Glenn Miller in 1942 by RCA Victor for sales of 1,000,000 copies of Chattanooga Choo-Choo during the previous year. 2\n\nOther companies followed suit and the gold record became fairly common in the industry. The sales that were being acknowledged were not confined to the US: a million-selling record is a big deal, wherever the sales are made. A record that sells 500,000 copies in the US and 500,000 copies in Europe is still a million-seller.\n\nThe spread of misinformation on the Internet includes writers who are experts on other aspects of popular music.\n\nThey are called in-house awards and for many records, these are the only sales indicators that we have to go on.\n\nSupposedly, record companies gave gold records for authentic million-sellers and for a host of other things. Since no one was checking, any company could give any artist any award for any reason. Most of the hubbub about phony awards being handed out willy-nilly is difficult to verify.\n\nToday, in-house awards from major record companies are generally recognized as legitimate sales barometers—especially those from the pre-RIAA era.\n\nA hypothetical situation\n\nAn American record company can give an American recording artist a gold record for a record that was a commercial failure in the US but sold a million copies in Europe. Despite the record failing to sell anything in the US, it is nonetheless a legitimate gold record award celebrating a genuine achievement. And the record company is not obliged to state on the award where the records were sold.\n\nOn February 10, 1942, RCA Victor presented bandleader Glenn Miller with the first known gold record award for sales of 1,000,000 copies of Chattanooga Choo Choo in 1941. The record on the plaque is a ten-inch 78 rpm disc. The presenter of the award is W. Wallace Early of RCA Victor with announcer Paul Douglas. Needless to say, this was also the first ‘in-house award.’\n\nGold and platinum awards for singles\n\nFor some reason, the RIAA took an interest in all of this and instituted their own Gold Record Awards program that began in February 1958. Since then, the RIAA awards are considered the only “official” awards. To qualify for certification, record companies had to request certification and pay for an independent audit of their books to verify that a given record had in fact sold the requisite amounts.\n\nAs the awards had little value at first, many companies did not request certification for their artists. (There are many reasons why a record company might not want to show anyone their books.)\n\nWhen the RIAA began issuing Gold Record Awards in 1958, singles were the medium that mattered but albums were recognized. The criteria for singles and albums were very different in the beginning: the RIAA counted records sold for singles but counted dollar amounts for albums as few LPs sold large quantities of records.\n\n1958-1988\n\nGold awards for singles\n\nA single had to sell 1,000,000 (one million) copies within the United States. The RIAA counted all sales of 78s and 45s to retailers and wholesalers, including jukebox vendors. They also counted free copies given to retailers for placing large orders, as they were more a discount to encourage large orders than actual freebies. 3\n\nThey did not count free copies given for promotional purposes, notably those shipped to radio stations for airplay. These never counted for more than a few thousand per title.\n\n1976-1988\n\nPlatinum awards for singles\n\nBeginning in 1976, the RIAA awarded a Platinum Record to a single that sold 2,000,000 (two million) copies.\n\n1989-2016\n\nGold awards for singles\n\nWith the increasing lack of interest in singles as a medium, sales plummeted over the years. This was not good for the industry: there were no more gold singles, even for records that topped the charts!\n\nIn 1989, the RIAA lowered the criteria for singles: they only needed to sell only 500,000 (five-hundred-thousand) copies for a Gold Record Award.\n\n1989-2016\n\nMulti-platinum awards for singles\n\nBeginning in 1989, the RIAA awarded a Platinum Record to a single that only sold 1,000,000 (one million) copies.\n\nThe Beatles received this Gold Record Award on December 15, 1967, for Hello Goodbye within weeks of its being released. The plaque reads, “Presented to The Beatles to commemorate the sales of more than one million copies of the Capitol Records pop single record Hello Goodbye.”\n\nGold awards for albums\n\nAs stated above, initially the RIAA only counted dollar amounts for albums. The criteria were constant for seventeen years before being changed out of necessity. Other changes have occurred since then.\n\n1958-1974\n\nGold awards for albums\n\nAlbums had to sell $1,000,000 (one million dollars) at the manufacturer’s wholesale price to qualify. The wholesale price was a portion of the manufacturer’s suggested retail price. As these varied from company to company, to simplify the process the RIAA set wholesale price as one-third (33⅓ percent) of the retail price.\n\nPeriod.\n\nThe number of copies sold was irrelevant.\n\nPeriod.\n\nNot one single 45 or LP received an RIAA Platinum Record Award in the 1950 or ’60s as the award wasn’t official until 1976!\n\nAnother hypothetical situation\n\nHere is the most extreme example of the irrelevancy of copies sold as a qualifying factor in RIAA Gold Record Awards in the ’60s. Suppose a wealthy collector made a deal with a record company to tape a once-in-a-lifetime performance of a string quartet made up of musicians who never make records.\n\nFrom this tape, one record was pressed after which the tape and all the parts were destroyed. The company assigned a manufacturer’s suggested list price of $3,330,000 to that unique record and the collector paid the full retail price.\n\nAll of the criteria required by the RIAA would be have been met and four musicians would be awarded an RIAA Gold Record “to commemorate the sales of more than one million dollars worth of records” based on the sales of . . . one record.\n\n1974-2016\n\nGold awards for albums\n\nAs production costs and mechanical fees rose through the years, so did the wholesale and retail price of albums. As the price rose, the number of records required to reach the RIAA gold standard declined. In January 1974, Bob Dylan’s PLANET WAVES shipped gold and received a Gold Record with fewer than 500,000 orders!\n\nThis caused some consternation in the industry and the RIAA set about tweaking the rules. Beginning sometime in 1974, an album had to meet two criteria:\n\n1.An album must sell $1,000,000 (one million dollars) at the wholesale level.\n\n2. An album must sell at least 500,000 (five-hundred-thousand) units.\n\nIn 1958, no one discussed “units.” First, albums were LPs. The few tapes that sold were reel-to-reels and they mostly sold to classical music buffs. The impact of tapes on RIAA certification was effectively non-existent.\n\nSecond, neither albums nor units had anything to do with RIAA certification: the award was based on a monetary achievement.\n\nBy 1968, a unit consisted of either an LP or tape. While reel-to-reels and 8-tracks were still manufactured, they sold little and had a minuscule impact on sales tallies. Most tape sales were of cassettes.\n\nThe times they are a-changing: this is the RIAA Gold Record presented to Stephen Stills on September 19, 1974, for the Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album SO FAR. The plaque has switched from commemorating one million dollars worth of sales to “the sale of more than 500,000 copies.”\n\nAbout the 500,000 copies statement\n\nIn the section titled “The 500,000 copies statement” at the top of this post, I wrote that no record was ever certified for an RIAA Gold Record Award based on the sale of more than 500,000 copies in the ’60s. And that is true and this is important: 1974 was the first year in which the RIAA awarded Gold Records to an album based on unit sales (“the sale of more than 500,000 copies”), not just dollar sales.\n\nYes, a few albums received a Gold Record for sales of fewer than a half-million, but they were double-albums with a higher list price and the award was based on the dollar amount, not the unit sales.\n\nIn fact, thinking about it just makes me wonder why they changed the wording on the plaque. Had they kept it the way things were (“the sales of more than one million dollars worth of [Whatever] Records”), no one would have noticed!\n\nIn the wake of Elvis Presley’s unexpected death on August 16, 1977, sales of his then current album MOODY BLUE skyrocketed! On September 12, 1977, the RIAA certified it having sold 1,000,000 copies. This RIAA Platinum Record Award was given to Mark Douglas, apparently an employee of RCA Records at the time.\n\nPlatinum awards for albums\n\nNot one single or album received a Platinum Record Award in the ’60s! Why? Because there was no such award until the ’70s! During the early ’70s, some record companies gave their artists platinum records as awards for sales beyond the gold level. These were unofficial, in-house awards.\n\nIn 1976, the RIAA introduced the official Platinum Record Award. They used a similar set of criteria to the Gold Award:\n\n1. An album must sell $2,000,000 (two million dollars) at the wholesale level.\n\n2. An album must sell at least 1,000,000 (one million) units.\n\nMulti-platinum awards\n\nIn 1985, the RIAA introduced the Multi-Platinum Award for sales levels in multiples of one million. Wholesale dollar amounts were also a part of the award and were counted in multiples of $2,000,000 (two million dollars).\n\n• For a 2xMulti-Platinum Record Award, an album must sell $4,000,000 (four million dollars) at the wholesale level and move at least 2,000,000 (two million) units.\n\n• For a 3xMulti-Platinum Record Award, an album must sell $6,000,000 (six million dollars) at the wholesale level and move at least 3,000,000 (three million) units.\n\nEtcetera.\n\nThe first double-album to receive an RIAA Gold Record Award was BELAFONTE AT CARNEGIE HALL. Released in October 1959, it reached #3 on Billboard’s Top LPs survey and was nominated for a 1960 Grammy Award as Album of the Year. On October 16, 1961, it was awarded an RIAA Gold Record commemorating one million dollars worth of sales for approximately 300,000 albums sold.\n\nDouble-albums and boxed sets\n\nExactly how the RIAA counts multiple-record sets has varied over the years. A single album is always one “unit”; a double-album has been one or two units. At one time, whether or not a double-album counted as two units or one was based on the length of the music!\n\nThis is completely contrary to the original intention of the Gold Record standards for LPs. Plus, it was just plain idiotic in action. Considers these possibilities:\n\n• If a two-record set had a manufacturer’s list price of $9.98 but was only 59:59 minutes long, it counted as a single unit towards certification. If it was 6o:00, it counted as two units.\n\n• But if a two-record set was just one-second longer (60:01), it counted as two units—even if it had a lower manufacturer’s list price than normal (such as $7.98).\n\nConfused? Just remember that prior to 1975, an album need only sell $1,000,000 wholesale; the more expensive an album’s retail price, the fewer copies it needed to sell to reach that level.\n\nWhile this 1948 advertisement boasts of forty-five minutes of playing time, actual pop albums tended to clock in at around thirty minutes. This had as much to do with money matters (like royalties) as it did with technical matters (like fidelity).\n\nThe wholesale cost of records\n\nNow a little history: on June 28, 1948, Columbia Records introduced the 33⅓ rpm long-playing records, establishing a new industry standard that would hold for almost forty years.\n\nThe first twelve-inch 33⅓ rpm album featured violinist Nathan Milstein performing the Mendelssohn Concerto In E Minor with Bruno Walter conducting the Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra of New York. It was issued as Columbia ML-4001 with a “premium price” of $4.85.\n\nReleased at the same time was the first ten-inch 33⅓ album featured Walter conducting Beethoven’s Symphony No. 8. It was issued as Columbia ML-2001 and was priced at $3.85. 4\n\nAs other companies quickly entered the LP market, retail prices varied from company to company and from genre to genre.\n\nRCA drops the price of albums\n\nIn early 1954, Columbia Records reduced the manufacturer’s retail price of its classical line by 30%. The February 13, 1954, issue of Billboard featured an article titled “Victor Fires Salvo / Slashes On LP’s Heightens General Price Skirmish” about RCA Victor’s response. The company cut the price of most of its 12-inch classical LPs from $5.72 to $3.99! They also reduced the price of their 10-inch LPs from $$4.60 to $3.25.\n\nBy the end of the year, they reduced the list price for all of their LPs: twelve-inch LPs were cut to $3.99, whereas they had been $4.19 to $5.95. They also lowered the cost of 45 rpm singles to 89¢ and EPs to $1.49. The prices took effect on the first day of 1955.\n\nRCA president Frank Folsom said he was convinced the record industry was on the threshold of its greatest period of expansion:\n\n“Introduction of the 33 and 45 rpm records in 1949 greatly increased the number of record players. Today there are more than 20,000,000 phonographs in use compared with only 10,000,000 at the end of World War II.”\n\nHe then predicted that Americans would purchase another 20,000,000 players in the next five years. 5\n\nIn 1958, stereo LPs were available, and most companies charged one dollar more for them than for their mono counterparts ($4.99 vs. $3.99).\n\nIn 1968, mono albums were discontinued as a viable commercial format; the average price for an LP in the US was now $4.99.\n\nThis mono copy of THE SUPREMES SING COUNTRY WESTERN & POP (Motown MT-625) from 1965 has a sticker with only the manufacturer’s list price of $3.98, indicating that the store did not discount records.\n\nHow many mono LPs must sell to go gold?\n\nFrom 1955 through 1967, the average retail price for a mono LP was approximately $3.99. Using the RIAA’s one-third rule, then the wholesale price was $1.33. An album would need to sell slightly more than 750,000 mono copies to reach the million-dollar mark.\n\nSince the majority of pop LPs sold prior to 1964 were mono, we may assume that any pop LP that was awarded an RIAA Gold Record prior to 1964 sold approximately 700,000 copies.\n\nThere weren’t many: Among the artists enjoying the folk music boom, the Kingston Trio was the most successful with six gold LPs, while Peter, Paul & Mary had two. Elvis had eight gold LPs and Ray Charles had one. No other rock & roll artist had a Gold Record for an album—the Beach Boys would not receive one until 1965.\n\nThat all changed in 1964 with the Beatles and the British Invasion.\n\nCapitol issued SGT. PEPPER as a deluxe album with a gatefold jacket, allowing them to add a dollar onto the manufacturer’s list price. As the stereo copy above illustrates, the store’s price sticker displays the manufacturer’s suggested price of $5.79, and the store’s discounted price of $3.75. This premium on the price would lower the number of copies required to qualify for an RIAA Gold Record Award (not that PEPPER needed it.)\n\nHow many stereo LPs must sell to go gold?\n\nFrom 1958 through 1967, the average retail price for a stereo LP was approximately $4.99. Using the RIAA’s one-third rule, then the wholesale price was $1.66. An album would need to sell slightly more than 600,000 stereo copies to reach the million-dollar mark.\n\nBy the middle of the decade, rock and pop LPs were selling a mixture of mono and stereo copies. During this time, we can assume that any LP that was awarded an RIAA Gold Record sold approximately 650,000 copies.\n\nWith the elimination of the practice of releasing new albums in both mono and stereo in 1968, most new LP sales were stereo with a list price of $4.99. We can assume that any LP that was awarded an RIAA Gold Record from 1968 into the early ’70s sold approximately 600,000 copies.\n\nThen the prices started going up regularly.\n\nThis mono copy of THE IKE & TINA TURNER SHOW VOLUME 2 (Loma 5904) has a sticker that indicates a list price of $3.79 followed by the store’s discounted price of $2.97. Regardless of the price that stores sold the records, the RIAA based its certification on a percentage of the list price!\n\nWe may never know the truth\n\nThe actual sales figures of an album that received an RIAA Gold Record Award prior to 1975 cannot be precisely known. Unless the album has been re-certified and upgraded to a new RIAA Award since 1975, its sales figures can only be estimated.\n\nThese examples are random and are based on errors that I found while researching other articles. They’ll have to suffice because I’m not looking for others . . .\n\nA Gift From A Flower To A Garden\n\nDonovan’s 1967 album A GIFT FROM A FLOWER TO A GARDEN was pop and rock’s first truly “deluxe” album: aside from being a boxed set, it featured an extraordinary photo on the front cover that required a six-color separation rather than the usual four-color process. The box also included a folio with twelve sheets of lyrics and drawings. This was one of the most expensive albums ever manufactured at the time.\n\nThis truly deluxe package carried a deluxe manufacturer’s retail price that dramatically lowered the number of copies old required to meet the million-dollar mark for an RIAA Gold Record Award.\n\nIn its entry on A GIFT FROM A FLOWER TO A GARDEN, Wikipedia wrote, “The album earned a Gold Record award for half-a-million sales during 1970.” This is not correct: with its higher retail price, the boxed set required sales of approximately 300,000 boxes to qualify for a Gold Record. 6\n\nAs Epic has never requested the RIAA to re-certify the album for an upgrade to the newer Gold Record Award, there is no way to know if Dono’s album has even sold a half-million copies in the forty-nine years since its release!\n\nIn the mid to late ’60s, some record companies began affixing shiny gold stickers to the front covers of jacket announcing that the album had received an RIAA Gold Record Award. It was the first attempt by the industry to exploit the award as a potential sales motivator. While most of the stickers found their way into the upper left corner, but I have seen them all over the cover!\n\nWheels Of Fire\n\nRead the inscription on the second image above: “Presented to Cream to commemorate the sales of more than one million dollars worth of Atco Records.” This Gold Record was presented on July 22, 1968. At that time, $1,000,000 represented sales of approximately 300,000-400,000 copies of a two-record set, depending on the manufacturer’s list price.\n\nNow Wikipedia states that WHEELS OF FIRE “reached #3 in the United Kingdom and #1 in the United States, becoming the first platinum-selling double album.”\n\nThis is a confusing statement, as the word platinum in that context was meaningless in the ’60s. And the word platinum in the context of double-albums has had several meanings over the past forty years.\n\nI assume that what the Wiki editors meant was that the album “reached #3 in the United Kingdom and #1 in the United States, becoming the first double-album to sell a million copies through combined global sales.”\n\nExcept that there is no evidence that WHEELS OF FIRE has actually sold a million copies; Joseph Murrells didn’t include it in his book, and there is no documentation on the Internet that level of sales has ever been reached.\n\nMaybe what the Wiki editors meant was that the album “reached #3 in the United Kingdom and #1 in the United States, becoming the first double-album to sell a half-million copies through combined global sales and can, therefore, be counted as a platinum if we count each of the records in the album as one separate unit.” Yes, that sounds about right.\n\nGo look up WHEELS OF FIRE on the Gold & Platinum search on the RIAA site: they got July 22, 1968, for the album’s certification for a Gold Record Award correct. But under the section titled Certified Unit, the RIAA lists “0.5 million.” And as we know by the award above, it was for not for 500,000 sales, but for $1,000,000. Nothing else.\n\nThere is no way to know what the actual sales of the album were at the time of the certification without knowing the manufacturer’s list price for it, which I have not been able to find. But there are two reasonable choices: $9.98, the highest price associated with double-albums (and twice that of a standard single-record album), or a middle price such as $7.98.\n\n• If the album listed for $9.98, then it would have had to sell 304,000 copies to qualify for an RIAA Gold Record Award in 1968.\n\n• If the album listed for $7.98, then it would have had to sell 417,000 copies to qualify for an RIAA Gold Record Award in 1968.\n\nAs of this date, the Warner Music Group/Atlantic Records Group (or whoever owns whomever) has not sought certification for a Platinum Record Award, implying the requisite 500,000 copies in domestic sales has not been reached.\n\nHere is another copy of the Beatles’ WHITE ALBUM that was so enthusiastically (over) loved by its owner that it looks as if it had been abused at the hands of a vinyl sadist. Believe it or not, there is an artist who collects nothing but used and tattered copies of THE BEATLES as an art project! Refer to “Rutherford Chang And The Beatles (We Buy White Albums).”\n\nThe Beatles\n\nAs successful as WHEELS OF FIRE was, it wasn’t even close to being the biggest selling double-album of the ’60s. That honor belongs to THE BEATLES, affectionately and universally known as “The White Album.” It reputedly sold more than 2,000,000 copies (not “units”) in its first twelve months of release!\n\nFor this astounding accomplishment, it received the same RIAA Gold Record Award as every other album that sold $1,000,000 at the wholesale level. Nothing more.\n\nThat is, it received the same award as WHEELS OF FIRE, which it outsold by a factor of five-to-one by the end of 1969 (and I am being conservative). 13\n\nDespite this unprecedented achievement, Capitol didn’t request Platinum Award certification for this album until 1991!\n\nThe Wonder Of You\n\nIn May 1970, Elvis received a Gold Record Award for sales of 1,000,000 copies of The Wonder Of You. Yet when RCA upgraded Presley’s catalog in 1992, they couldn’t find the sales receipts that showed that original million, so they couldn’t upgrade this single from its original Gold Record status of 1,000,000 copies sold to the new Platinum Record status of 1,000,000 copies sold.\n\nIf you go to the RIAA website and type “the wonder of you” into the Gold & Platinum search, it returns, “Unfortunately that search produced no certifications.”\n\nIf you scroll through the Elvis listings, you will find The Wonder Of You in the 1970 listings! There it informs you that the record has only been certified Gold in 1970 and then for 500,000 sales—despite the fact that no record was ever given a Gold Record for sales of 500,000 copies before 1974!\n\nRight, if we can’t trust the bloody RIAA to get it right on their own website, why should we expect writers to get it right in their articles, right?!!?\n\nThe year 1964 is best remembered as the year of Beatlemania in the US, but it was also the year of the ascendency of Tamla/Motown to artistic and commercial success. And no one better defined the Motown sound and look than the Supremes. Between 1964 and 1969, they had seventeen Top 10 hits on Billboard, eleven of which reached #1. But because Berry Gordy refused to allow anyone to see the real numbers in his company ledgers, the Supremes did not receive a single RIAA Gold Record Award in the ’60s.\n\nA conclusion with advice\n\nConsider this: how does anyone have a sane conversation about record sales in the ’60s based on RIAA Awards when not a single Motown record received a Gold Record Award in the ’60s. Using the RIAA Awards as a deciding factor, one could easily and reasonably conclude that Motown was not a particularly successful record company—just about the stupidest conclusion one could ever reach!\n\nSo, writers and “content providers” that clog up the Internet with observations based on ignorance, here’s my advice (the simplest one first): Stop mentioning sales figures when you mention RIAA Gold and Platinum Awards in your articles.\n\nThis advice is more difficult (but more rewarding): Stop mentioning RIAA Gold and Platinum Awards as meaningful sales indicators in your articles without understanding the Awards and taking into consideration the circumstances surrounding each one.\n\nIn 1958, RCA Victor released Elvis’ latest single I Got Stung / One Night as both a 45 (47-7410) and a 78 (20-7410). The 45 sold a million, while sales of the 78 were so teensy-weensy that RCA discontinued manufacturing them! Consequently, a near mint copy of the 45 will cost you $20-30, while a near mint copy of the 78 will set you back $500-1,000. (In the UK, RCA continued with 78s into 1960 before calling it quits. In other parts of the world, 78s lasted into the late ’60s.)\n\nAbout all those gold records on the Internet\n\nThere are lots of gold record awards on the Internet, many of them for sale. If you’re in the market for one as a buyer, know these three things:\n\n1. Most of them are not legitimate RIAA or even in-house awards; they are wall decorations.\n\n2. There have been many styles of the actual physical RIAA Awards, including the wooden frames, the backing in the frames, and even the RIAA symbol on the plaque. Many records that were originally awarded in one format can be found as legitimate awards in later formats. Know which format is which if you’re spending big bucks.\n\n3. There are fake/counterfeit RIAA Gold Record Awards.\n\nRemember, that in 49 BC, as Caesar led his army across the Rubicon River, he famously said “Alea iacta est, caveat emptor.” Roughly translated, that means “The die is cast, so let the buyer beware.” If Julius said it, we should all give it good heed indeed.\n\nWriters should stop mentioning sales figures about RIAA Gold and Platinum Awards in their articles as they are usually incorrect. Share on X\n\nFEATURED IMAGE: In February 1964, Capitol Records president Alan Livingston presented the group with awards for I Want To Hold Your Hand and MEET THE BEATLES. Each record would sell more than 3,000,000 copies in the US by year’s end. The album would keep on selling. Nothing has been the same since.\n\nFinally, according to one RIAA Award Collector, most of the photos of awards in this article as illustrations are fake. Unfortunately, he wouldn’t tell me which ones were fake nor would he provide images of genuine awards. See his remarks in the comment section below.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n1 For this article, the word album refers mostly to LP records. The word single refers to seven-inch, 45 rpm records with one track per side. I don’t address the various permutations of singles of the past forty years, such as one-sided singles, twelve-inch singles, cassette singles, CD singles, etc.\n\n2 To avoid confusion throughout this article, I only capitalized RIAA awards (“Gold Records”). In-house awards or other references are in lower case (“gold records”).\n\n3 In 1957, RCA Victor announced that Elvis had sold 12,000,000 singles the year before. They noted that less than 10% of those singles were 78s. By the end of 1958, the few 78s manufactured in the US were mostly blues and rhythm & blues records for the black market.\n\n4 I adapted these three paragraphs from the article “A Brief History of the Sony Classical Label” on the official Sony website. Sony has since removed the original article from its site.\n\n5 This data was taken from the article “R.C.A. Cuts L-P Prices; Many by 30%” that appeared in the Chicago Daily Tribune on December 28, 1954."
