        "text": "Accessibility.\n\nPersonal Voice helps users with speech loss create a voice that sounds like them, then use it with Live Speech to communicate in FaceTime calls and in-person conversations. Made for iPhone hearing devices can now pair directly with Mac, so users with hearing disabilities can take calls and have conversations more conveniently. Other updates include an easier way to adjust text size for reading comfort, an option to automatically pause animated images while browsing the web, and a new experience for learning how to use Voice Control.\n\nScreen Sharing.\n\nTap into the full power of your Mac while working away from it. The new high-performance mode in the Screen Sharing app uses the advanced media engine in Apple silicon to enable highly responsive remote access over high-bandwidth connections.\n\nReminders.\n\nGrocery Lists automatically sort items into categories to make shopping easier. Change how items are grouped, and the list remembers your preferences. And new Column View organizes sections into columns across your screen, making it easy to visualize your tasks.\n\nVisual Look Up.\n\nFind recipes for similar dishes from a photo. And look up information on an object that appears in a paused video frame.\n\nPhotos.\n\nThe People album is better than ever at recognizing your favorite people and now includes the cats and dogs that are part of your family too.\n\nFind My.\n\nShare AirTag or Find My network accessories with up to five other people. Everyone in the group can see the item on a map and play a sound to pinpoint the location of a shared item when nearby.\n\nHome.\n\nActivity History lets you see who locked or unlocked the door — and when. It also shows recent activity for garage doors, contact sensors, and your security system. And Grid Forecast shows when a user’s electrical grid has relatively cleaner or less clean energy sources available so you can plan when to run appliances.\n\nAirPods.\n\nMoving between Apple devices with AirPods is now significantly faster with updates to Automatic Switching. Press the stem of your AirPods to quickly mute or unmute yourself when on a call."
