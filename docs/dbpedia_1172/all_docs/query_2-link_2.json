        "text": "Anyone who is even slightly familiar with American animation history has probably heard the name of Chuck Jones. One of the most distinctive and recognizable filmmakers to arise during the Golden Age of American animation, during the 1940s and 50s Jones put out a slew of often truly great shorts at the Warner Bros. cartoon studio, including several of the most well-known WB shorts (The Dover Boys, Haredevil Hare, Rabbit Hood, Long-Haired Hare, Barber of Seville, Rabbit Seasoning, Bully for Bugs, Duck Amuck, Duck Dodgers in the 24 1/2th Century, One Froggy Evening, What’s Opera, Doc?, and the Road Runner cartoons, to name just a few). What makes Jones’s best films stand out are their impeccably-drawn-and-animated characters, the characters’ own animated humanity as sharply expressed in their poses and facial expressions, the cinematic layouts (most likely inherited from fellow WB director Frank Tashlin), a willingness to experiment with any element of a film, and a subtle sense of both sophistication and cynicism.\n\nIn addition to working with (and often tweaking) established characters like Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, Jones and his collaborator, writer Mike Maltese, came up with several of their own memorable characters, some more well-known than others (the aforementioned Road Runner and his nemesis, Wile E. Coyote, being two of the most well-known). These characters generally starred in their own cartoons, or co-starred with the more established characters, or (in the case of Jones’s dysfunctional Three Bears) even both. At times, these “lesser” characters could even co-star with each other.\n\nChuck Jones’s 1954 classic, Feline Frame-Up, is not only a great example of the latter, but also a great example of Jones’s 1950s films in general.\n\nThis would be the last film to pair the unlikely duo, Marc Antony the bulldog and Pussyfoot the kitten. Jones had introduced them in his 1952 film Feed the Kitty, in which Pussyfoot’s cuteness and kitten-like innocence won over Marc Antony almost instantly; Marc Antony’s love for Pussyfoot and his willingness to do anything to protect her, in spite of his being a dog and her being a cat, would be depicted for the rest of that film and in its 1953 follow-up, Kiss Me Cat.\n\nHaving established their relationship in those earlier cartoons, Jones now introduces a devious interloper: Claude Cat, who had appeared in several of Jones’s cartoons before, most notably as a neurotic foil to the mouse duo Hubie and Bertie. Here, Claude has become a self-serving, manipulative jerk who is all too willing to curry the favor of his owner (voiced by Robert C. Bruce) while destroying Marc Antony’s and Pussyfoot’s close relationship. Accordingly, Jones has a new focus: Marc’s violent retaliations against Claude Cat. This new dynamic between Marc and Claude gives this film a delightfully cynical edge that is absent in Marc’s earlier cartoons with Pussyfoot.\n\nThe film’s opening scenes make a point of subverting the earlier cartoons’ cuteness, while immediately establishing the somewhat new dynamic between the three pets. Pussyfoot sleeps peacefully on her large pillow, underscored by Brahms’ Lullaby….but just seconds later, Claude, showing what anthropomorphic feline scum he is, slides in and kicks Pussyfoot off (timed to the lullaby!), sending her flying as he gets comfy on the pillow! But then Marc Antony comes in and kicks him off, and gently places Pussyfoot back on the pillow where she belongs. In one of the film’s many ingeniously brutal scenes, Marc Antony begins giving Claude a good beating in the face, whereby the owner begins caning Marc on the head; told to drop Claude, Marc literally flings the malicious cat onto the ground, earning him another hit in the head!\n\nNo time is wasted in establishing the status quo. But the aggressive reprisals are just beginning.\n\nThe owner, carrying Claude (who sticks his tongue out at Marc Antony) off, warns Marc not to mess with him again, oblivious to Claude’s own behavior towards Pussyfoot. Thus, while Marc Antony and Pussyfoot are sleeping together, Claude puts Pussyfoot in Marc’s mouth and brings the scene to the owner’s attention; again, not knowing Claude is responsible, the owner gets fed up and kicks Marc Antony out of the house, giving free rein for Claude to trap Pussyfoot in a glass vase—but not before showing off more what a butthole he is by flicking her in front of the booted-out Marc Antony and slamming the door in the enraged bulldog’s face!\n\nA recurring theme in Jones’s cartoons is obsessive determination to achieve a goal, no matter what the odds or the means; its purest manifestation is surely the Road Runner cartoons. Feline Frame-Up from here on becomes like a truly sadistic version of a Road Runner cartoon, in which Marc Antony, determined to get revenge, finds several ways to cause serious bodily harm to Claude. All end in strategic defeat for Marc Antony as the owner kicks him out; eventually, though, Claude seems to realize that he can’t keep up his miserable existence knowing that, no matter how many times Marc Antony is kicked out, he will keep coming back and bringing violence upon him until he owns up to his crimes. Such it is that, as Claude is being beaten in the face for the third time in the film, he surrenders and signs a confession about his mistreatment of Pussyfoot and Marc, and even personally puts Pussyfoot back on her pillow; he is then kicked out of the house, and to add more injury to insult gets run over by a street cleaner! (Just before the iris-out, he guesses—in his only line in the film—that he’s having one of those days, and collapses.)\n\nWhat keeps the violence, as funny as it is in itself, from coming off as overly cruel and unnecessary is that Marc Antony is doing it all for the sake of Pussyfoot; despite being off-screen for much of the film, she is the character around whom the film gravitates. It is because Claude Cat would gladly kick her away so he could have the house for himself that Marc Antony, who loves Pussyfoot, becomes aggressive towards him. Claude, in trying to do away with Marc, goes beyond the pale: he does not just frame Marc for something he didn’t do, he makes it look like Marc is on the verge of eating Pussyfoot (the last thing Marc would ever think of!!)—and afterwards dangles Pussyfoot smugly before Marc, provoking him by hurting her. In the face of such deliberate spite, Marc Antony has no choice but to inflict his series of vicious abuses against Claude, relenting only when Claude agrees to reveal the truth to their owner about what he has done to Marc and Pussyfoot.\n\n“Hey, look at what I’m doing to your precious kitten!” What a butt-hat. (This shot as a whole is great, by the way…more on that in a bit!)\n\nMike Maltese’s writing, particularly his oddball sense of humor and quirkiness, was essential to the success of Chuck Jones’s cartoons in the 1950s, and Feline Frame-Up is certainly no exception. Thanks to him, Marc Antony’s methods of harassing Claude Cat are eccentric, ranging from using a string to lasso Claude’s tail through a door slot and pulling on the string repeatedly to shove Claude against the door, to slamming down on a board in the back porch to launch a mocking Claude into the ceiling (evidently the board extends inside the house) then going into the basement to supposedly bring Claude down by sawing the ground under him (it turns out to be his infuriated owner!), to making Claude think it’s snowing in July then slamming the window down on his neck when he looks out, to finally entering the house and punching Claude twice, first by disguising himself as a gift box, then (when that’s through) by unlocking the front door using a hook attached to a blown-up (under the door) balloon!\n\nYet the cartoon is no mere succession of hilariously violent gags with an underlying purpose. Thanks to Jones’s masterful direction, Maltese’s story is executed with a refined penchant for deft comic timing; more importantly, however, the characters involved in the gags come off as real people, so believably human they are. Their facial expressions, in particular, brilliantly reflect their state of mind at each moment with a precision that remains unequaled in animation to this day. What makes these expressions particularly special is that they relish in not being “realistic”—they cannot physically be made by a real-life human—yet perhaps because of that, they are all the more convincing, distilling the characters’ thoughts and emotions into a raw, clear representation.\n\nJones’s range of expressions, and how effectively they depict his characters’ feelings, is a key component of his cartoons.\n\nComplementing the sublime facial expressions are the equally lovely poses, which help greatly in getting across the characters’ personalities. Through them, Marc Antony cannot be anything other than a brawny, powerful bulldog who nevertheless has his soft moments, and is well-satisfied when justice is finally served; Claude Cat reads well as arrogant, malignant feline vermin, with his physical condition gradually worsening as he endures more abuse; and Pussyfoot, of course, is just adorable enough as a kitten without being outright cloying. Even the owner has his moment when Marc Antony accidentally saws him down into the basement: his expression and his pose work together to depict his exasperation, how sick and tired he is of having to deal with Marc, and his very uncomfortable position all at once.\n\nGreat poses working in tandem with great expressions to create great characters in great scenes.\n\nThe wonderful expressions and poses would have been impossible without Jones’s beautiful draftsmanship. The near-anatomically-built character designs of Marc Antony, Claude, and Pussyfoot, constructed of often complex, angular shapes, succeed very, very well in capturing the look and nuances of a real-life bulldog, cat, and kitten, respectively; yet they are caricatured enough that they can be quite human, too!\n\nMost significantly, however, all these elements result in the high-caliber character animation that is the trademark of Jones’s best cartoons. In this regard, Jones’s animators do not get enough credit for actually bringing his layouts together into a satisfying whole; it is because of them that the characters can engage in real acting, rather than just a timed-and-inbetweened series of beautifully-drawn poses and expressions. The sole key animators on this film are Richard Thompson and Abe Levitow, both of whom had been recently promoted (they were assistant animators); for reasons that remain unknown, Jones decided to split up his unit for three cartoons, with star animator Ken Harris animating all of No Barking (also starring Claude Cat, this time with Frisky Puppy) and fellow veteran animators Ben Washam and Lloyd Vaughan animating The Cats Bah (featuring Pepé Le Pew). In the case of this particular cartoon, perhaps it was Jones’s test to see if relative novices Thompson and Levitow (both of whom, according to Greg Duffell, were influenced by Harris, especially Levitow since he was Harris’s assistant) could carry a cartoon on their own while living up to the challenge of bringing his vision to the screen, and they more than succeed in that regard.\n\nDig these head multiples as Marc Antony beats the feces out of Claude!\n\nMaurice Noble had been Jones’s regular layout artist for some time when he designed Feline Frame-Up; as painted by Philip DeGuard, Noble’s backgrounds attractively depict, in a lovely semi-stylized manner, the suburban setting in which the film takes place. The house interiors, in particular, are sleek yet charming, with occasional ornateness in the furniture, and the scribbly flower-like patterns on some of the walls are an understated yet brilliant touch; outside, distant buildings and trees are represented in silhouette. Noble’s eye-pleasing color styling enhances the settings; striking, vivid colors abound, whether the reds and greens (with occasional lavenders, blue-greens, browns, and yellows) that make up the house interior, or the cool night blues that cover the outside of the house and the sky, yet the characters always read well against them, an effect that Noble, who always believed in tasteful design and color that served the needs of a film as a whole, actively sought out. Indeed, his skill at laying out well-composed shots was a natural fit for Jones’s own cinematic proclivities; dynamic live-action-style camera angles are peppered throughout this film, as in Jones’s other films, yet they work with their given scenes so well that they may not be immediately noticeable.\n\nOne of the many expertly laid out and colored shots throughout the cartoon. Take note of the shadow in the corner of the door! (And look out for noticeably darker areas in the other backgrounds, too—a nice, almost dramatic effect.)\n\nCarl Stalling was the composer of just about all of Warner Bros.’ cartoons from 1936 to the late 1950s; his music, with its magnificent and creative use of WB’s vast library of songs, public domain songs, classical music, and his own musical emphasis on the on-screen action, is as inseparable from these cartoons as top-notch animation and brilliant direction. In addition to Brahms’ Lullaby, the other songs Stalling uses in Feline Frame-Up are “So Dumb, But So Beautiful” during the opening credits, “Jingle Bells” as Claude witnesses fake snow falling outside the window, and the “Retreat” bugle call when Claude surrenders. Treg Brown, who is uncredited, was the WB cartoons’ main SFX editor; his whack sounds are put to good use throughout this cartoon as Marc Antony (and, in the end, Claude Cat) is constantly kicked out of the house, and his punch sounds manage to deliver an impact without sounding painfully cliched. (To say nothing of Brown’s various other great sounds in this cartoon!)\n\nFeline Frame-Up is a fine animated film made by a talented visionary and his brilliant crew at an important studio, all at the height of their powers. Its ostensibly innocent, cute story (giant dog protects cute kitten from mean cat) is a façade and a justification for what quickly becomes a twisted display of uproarious brutality and cynicism, making the film almost blatantly subversive in tone. Everything else—the characters, their designs, the faces and poses, the animation, the layouts and backgrounds, the color styling, the voices (in addition to the aforementioned Robert C. Bruce, Warner mainstay and voice acting legend Mel Blanc provided additional vocal effects and, of course, Claude’s dialogue at the very end), the music, and even the SFX—is absolutely of excellent quality as well. While the film isn’t quite as ambitious as some of Chuck Jones’s other cartoons from the 1950s, it still embodies what makes his best work so enjoyable, and for that, it is highly worth watching—the unique character combination, well-conceived plot and violence, and exceptional visuals alone make it a classic!\n\nWe all have one of those days, Claude. We all do."
