        "text": "BUSA JEREMIAH WENOGO | Informal Economist\n\nTHE Incredible Hulk comes to mind when one is asked to identify a comic character to describe the National Capital District buai ban – which has seen a significant increase in the price of betel nut and the proliferation of smuggling and associated clandestine and illegal activities.\n\nJust like the Hulk, whose transformation is ignited by rage, the imposition of the ban and the incredible increase in prices has caused vendors to be more rebellious and prepared to defy new rules and regulations.\n\nThe now illegal buai trade has created a whole new set of problems and challenges as suppliers and traders compete for the wealth to be acquired from the sale of the ‘green gold’ – leading to violent confrontations and deaths among the competing suppliers and an inexorable growth in lawlessness.\n\nThe government could only watch as the buai unleashed its wrath on a city struggling with what I call a ‘Cinderella’ syndrome.\n\nWhatever cosmetic treatment has been given to the city is quickly being eroded away by ugly red stains that are the aftermath of chewing a nifty combination of buai nut, lime and mustard.\n\nStains of red invade the alleys, walls, walkways, footpaths and roads in the city. The presence of the buai husk is so pervasive, every cubic feet of public space in the city has been invaded.\n\nRarely do you find a buai-free zone. The city drainage is overflowing with clot of both newly husked and old betel nut skins. Combating littering in the city is now a daunting task for the city authority.\n\nThe more hostile the punishment, the more elusive the conduct of the buai traders to stay one step ahead of the government in this lucrative trade. It seems unfair, but who should we pity?\n\nNow the buai vendors are cashing in and their nemesis, the ban, is revered as their saviour. Thanks to the buai ban the value of the betel nut trade has increased several fold.\n\nPort Moresby in reality is a sham: cosmopolitan only from the outside. At the heart of its supposed modernity is a thriving buai trade that is an eyesore to the government but a lifeline for the city’s large population that earns its income outside of the formal sector.\n\nAt best Port Moresby can be mistaken for Bruce Wayne’s Gotham with white collar crime now at its peak aided by a police force that is more and more treated with suspicion and disgust by its citizens.\n\nA case in point is the poor response of police in attending to civil matters affecting the city’s ordinary citizens. Police officers are now said to discharge their duties on the precondition that ‘fuel or lunch’ money is provided.\n\nThus there is a strong sentiment among the public that police nowadays prefer to provide ‘escort services’ to businesses and high profile individuals to earn quick bucks than attending to their basic responsibilities.\n\nFurthermore, the set-up of unnecessary roadblocks by various road authorities is becoming infamous for soliciting money from the travelling parties. The law of the land seemed more inclined to be lax when dealing with bourgeois than with commoners.\n\nJustice in the case of the latter is swift. Combining the ‘Harvey two-face’ style of justice system with a thriving buai trade and you have a city that is reminiscent of New York City during the bootlegging era.\n\nWhat resistance is good enough to stop its rampage?\n\nGovernment efforts are languishing, but the tax payers are ignorant. If we are educated as we claim to be, then how come we allow millions of kina of our contributions being wasted on a failed policy? Our silence is just as responsible for allowing the buai trade to thrive.\n\nImposition of the ban has had a significant impact on the health of the population especially when the chewing of betel nut is argued to be responsible for the spread of TB and mouth cancer.\n\nHowever, when we start to ask the important question about the ban’s effectiveness in achieving these objectives, we come to a glaring reality that it has instead done more harm than good considering the fact that, since its imposition, loss of life, smuggling and harassment have become rampant.\n\nSince the ban, commonsense has been in ruins. Out on the streets, incivility thrives. Enforcement with its one eye closed is enthralled in this game of hide and seek. There is no way to tell who is who. Enforcers have been tempted and have been found wanting. Now they all want a share of the money they help to make.\n\nThe city is a jungle as it witnesses a new style of civil warfare. Buai rangers scamper in all directions in hope of capturing smugglers and traders unaware.\n\nMen and women, young and old are on a constant watch to avoid being caught. Their desperation to survive is our economic sin.\n\nWho are we to play God in an unjust society where the rich get rich at the expense of the poor? Jail terms do no good to the traders. Nor are they justified when their crime is provoked by their desperation to survive in an uncompromising city.\n\nWhat good is a law when it takes the bread away from a dying man?\n\nROB PARER\n\nOVER many years, American billionaire David Tallichet (1922-2007) was interested in the World War II aircraft left behind in the Sepik.\n\nTallichet, who made his fortune as ‘the father of the themed restaurant’, had piloted bombers over Europe in World War II and his post-war hobby was in restoring some of these aircraft.\n\nHe corresponded with me on a number of occasions and, coming from a family of aviators myself, I was always eager to help where I could.\n\nThere were other guys like him in the 1970s, such as John White from the Australian War Memorial who when in Aitape loved talking to Rev Fr Urban Reid, who as Flying Officer Danny Reid DFC was the only Allied pilot to shoot down of one of the Luftwaffe’s rarest aircraft, an Arado AR-234 jet.\n\nThat’s a pretty long introduction to the story of how the Aitape War Museum came to lose millions of dollars worth of vintage aircraft.\n\nEmile Glaus of Wewak had the non-ferrous rights for the Wewak and Aitape Districts and had melted down most of the aircraft in Wewak, But and Boiken.\n\nHe was ready to move his equipment to Aitape when the price of aluminium dropped and I offered to purchase the rights for Aitape in the name of the Aitape War Museum. Glaus accepted and I paid him in January 1972.\n\nThen in December 1972 a letter from David Tallichet was hand delivered to me by an Aerial Tours pilot.\n\nTallichet had been at Tadji the day before and wrote from Wewak. I responded that none of the aircraft were for sale.\n\nPrior to this I had two letters from Tallichet wanting to purchase some of the aircraft. Each time I replied that I, being the owner and founder of Aitape War Museum, wanted them left in the area around Tadji Airstrip for future generations and particularly to attract tourists.\n\nSo I was shocked one day to hear that there were expatriates at Tadji with equipment which was pulling aircraft apart.\n\nThey had come in a small aircraft and I told them to stop, which they did and went to see the District Officer who contacted the District Commissioner in Vanimo.\n\nHe eventually was able to get a decision from the authorities in Moresby to say the workers had permission to proceed.\n\nTo this day no one has told me how the ownership was transferred.\n\nSo I just had to let them proceed but we were able to keep a Mitchell B25 bomber.\n\nWe moved it to the safety of Aitape High School and it is still there on display.\n\nDavid Tallichet (left) sponsored one of the world’s single largest recoveries of aircraft wrecks, with the majority of the work conducted in 1974 by New Zealander Charles Darby and Australian ‘Monty’ Armstrong.\n\nMost of the Kittyhawk P-40s recovered were taken from the dump sites at the end of the Tadji strip. The salvage work was easy as all the aircraft were near the road and barge service to ship them from Aitape. Recovered were over a dozen complete aircraft and a variety of parts.\n\nThere were seven Airacobra P-39Q fighters, a Boston light bomber, six Kittyhawks, a Hudson light bomber and four Beaufort A9 torpedo bombers.\n\nMany of these aircraft were restored to flying condition, some in the United States and others in New Zealand.\n\n‘Feather Merchant’ was saved for Aitape and continues to grace the high school; other aircraft worth millions of dollars found a home elsewhere.\n\n‘Feather Merchant’ was the ninth B-25C bomber produced by North American Aircraft. It was originally intended for the Netherlands East Indies Air Force but was appropriated by the Americans.\n\nIt became famous during the war for bringing senior military commanders from Manila in the Philippines to Darwin.\n\nIt also flew on a bombing mission against Lae where it was attacked and damaged by Japanese Zeros eventually making a forced landing in a kunai grass field near Port Moresby.\n\nIt was repaired and taken out of combat service and, around February 1944, turned into a ‘Fat Cat’ supply and transport plane with its armament removed but still in olive drab paint.\n\nLater, it was stripped to natural aluminum finish, declared war weary and transferred to a service squadron before, at the end of the war, being abandoned at Tadji Airfield with its tail removed.\n\nPhoto: B25 Mitchell bomber ‘Feather Merchant’ now on display at Aitape High School.\n\nPAUL OATES\n\nSOON after Australia’s election was called – and too late for it to be anything but an historical document – the Australian parliament released the Senate report on the delivery and effectiveness of Australia's bilateral aid program in Papua New Guinea.\n\nYou can read the full report here.\n\nAs I started to read this extensive document my eye was drawn to a sub paragraph that spoke of a matter near and dear to my heart: ‘(g) establishing realistic performance benchmarks to assess aid outcomes against set targets and to improve accountability’.\n\nThat’s a point strangely familiar, I thought, very similar to the collective suggestions submitted to the Senate by Keith Jackson on behalf of PNG Attitude readers. There might actually be something in this report other than public service motherhood statements, so I read on.\n\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) Performance Report for PNG in 2014-15 provided an overview of the development challenges facing PNG:\n\nOver three million people – or 40 per cent of the population – remain poor and/or face hardship:\n\n- Malnutrition rates are high (45 per cent of children stunted and 14 per cent wasting).\n\n- Around 80 per cent of the population reside in traditional rural and remote coastal communities and secure their livelihoods from subsistence farming, fishing and small-scale cash cropping.\n\n- Life expectancy is only 62 years (compared with 60 years in 2005) and infant mortality is 47.3 per 1,000 live births (compared with 51.5 per 1,000 in 2005).\n\n- Women and girls suffer unacceptably high death rates related to pregnancy and childbirth, and the majority experience sexual and family violence.\n\n- It is estimated that around 15 per cent of the population has some form of disability.\n\nCrumbs, I thought, those statistics seem to fly in the face of current statements by the PNG government and their PM.\n\nA DFAT assessment of Australian aid noted that six out of seven program objectives in PNG in 2013-14 were classified as 'at risk'.\n\nThen the news got even worse:\n\nMr Paul Flanagan's recent analysis has highlighted deep cuts to core development sectors: The 2015 [Final Budget Outcome] reveals that overall domestic expenditure reductions in 2015 amounted to 14.3%. However, the cuts in particular sectors are particularly worrying. The largest cuts were to health – an extraordinary within year cut of 37.1%. Infrastructure was cut by 36.0%, and Education by 30.3%. This pattern of cuts is the opposite of what the government claims are its priorities and the areas that would be protected. These are frightening figures for service delivery in PNG, as well as investment in human resources.\n\nIf those savage cuts to essential government services had occurred in Australia the government would have been tossed out on its ear.\n\nDr Karl Claxton and Mr Peter Jennings from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) commented: Australia is served by a stable, confident, active and prosperous PNG, given its proximity and location across our direct approaches; historical and personal bonds; consular responsibilities; our trade and investment links; and expectations we'd assist if Port Moresby requested our help.\n\nHowever, Dr Claxton and Mr Jennings cautioned that as PNG population 'climbs toward 15 million in 2030 and up to 30 million by 2050' questions have been raised regarding whether a crisis in PNG could overwhelm the capacity of Australia to respond. They argued that 'anti-poverty and security-enhancing measures needn't be incompatible but rather overlap significantly in places like PNG.\n\nAnother observation made in the Report said:\n\nDifferent delivery partners bring unique strengths and expertise to the provision of aid programs. The aid program must achieve a balance between supporting government, the private sector, multilateral institutions and civil society, so as to maximise the strengths of each sector and reflect its ability to achieve results and deliver sustainable development outcomes.\n\nYet later in the report it notes tellingly:\n\nThe committee was surprised by the fact that only four per cent of the Australian bilateral aid program to PNG is delivered by NGOs (compared to 58 per cent by commercial suppliers). The committee accepted the consistent evidence that NGOs often have the better reach into the most disadvantaged and isolated communities in PNG. The relatively small base of funding allocated to churches through the PNG Church Partnership Program also appears starkly at odds with the range of education and health services provided by church organisations and the cultural influence of churches in the lives of the ordinary people in PNG. The committee notes that the A Lost Decade report recommended that given the superior performance of church-run schools and health clinics, existing partnerships with church education and health service providers should be expanded.\n\nIn the view of the committee, a balanced Australia aid program should include increased support for the work of NGO partners in PNG.\n\nWow! That’s telling it. But predictably, Coffey International said:\n\n…that in performing their roles in PNG '’advisers may require assistance to be \"politically conscious\" especially in environments of corruption and poor decision-making around spending public funds'. It had found that 'overt activity or reporting by advisers may jeopardise their position or compromise the trust of their PNG counterparts…\n\nSo is this a ‘given’ for advisors going to work in PNG? Apparently, this is a new idea and concept for some service providers, bureaucrats and commercial concerns. Technical assistance versus ‘conducive’ leadership.\n\nReading between the lines of bureaucratic ‘tokples’, it seems there may be some recognition that simple ‘technical advice’ may not be the way to go.\n\nCARE Australia also noted that 'Australian aid program's approaches have largely relied on technical assistance, by placing advisers and Australian Government officials in PNG Government agencies in long-term positions'. It stated: Technical assistance can effectively contribute to development outcomes, especially when advisers play a facilitative role and where there is strong local ownership and leadership. Sometimes, however, there is an overreliance on technical assistance at the expense of other more promising approaches.\n\nA number of commentators have highlighted that expectations of what technical assistance can achieve are unrealistic, given that change is complex, slow and gradual and requires conducive leadership, incentives and political economy. Some have concerns that technical assistance sometimes promotes technical solutions that are not appropriate to the context.\n\nCracks have appeared in DFAT’s Strongim Gavaman program:\n\nAs a review of DFAT's Strongim Gavman Program found, there are also risks that technical assistance can undermine local capacity when advisers take a more capacity-substitution role.\n\nLogically of course, those who have a vested interest in providing commercially available aid programs responded differently:\n\nIn contrast, Coffey International defended the value of technical advisers in the Australian aid program, noting a study from November 2014 found that 'counterparts, stakeholders and senior managers in the PNG Government commonly expressed views about, and reported instances of, the success of the (adviser) placements.\n\nIt (the Committee) recommended: While it is important to adopt a range of practical and flexible aid modalities in PNG, technical assistance and advisory support is important for sustaining and improving the core functions of government. The Australian government should continue to fund such assistance as a complement to other support options.\n\nCoffey International also observed:\n\nA large number of advisers from Australian Government agencies work in PNG as part of the Strongim Gavman Program (SGP).\n\nDFAT noted:\n\nThe PNG Prime Minister announced plans to remove all foreign advisers by 31 December 2015. After that date, Prime Minister O'Neill indicated that all advisers would be recruited and employed directly by the Government of PNG…Australia currently has a total of 217 advisers deployed in PNG funded directly out of the aid budget, made up of 34 Strongim Gavman Program advisers, 110 contracted advisers and 73 Australian Federal Police personnel. In preparation for these discussions DFAT is actively considering options for moving advisers to in-line roles, including through consultations with staff who have worked on previous aid adviser reviews and with academics, think tanks and other agencies.\n\nThere may be positive development benefits to shifting to inline advisory support in some contexts, and Australia will be discussing these in detail with the Government of PNG.\n\nMr Kimberley from DFAT told the committee: We agree that it is important that PNG agencies have a greater role in managing advisory resources. We do, however, have concerns about the transition time frames that have been proposed. We have suggested to PNG that the transition period needs to be longer—something more like 1 July 2016.\n\nSo what about the stated aid object of:‘(g) establishing realistic performance benchmarks to assess aid outcomes against set targets and to improve accountability’, one could well ask?\n\nA PNG national was quoted as saying:\n\nWe have had Australian development practitioners work with us in PNG. Their role is to provide support to our internal policy development process, strategic plans, targets etc. They merely facilitate. We decide whether to accept their advice or not. We set the agenda and have the final say as to what is good for us.\n\nAustralia’s national interest then was briefly discussed:\n\nA significant recent change has been increasing development assistance by China to PNG. Research by the Lowy Institute's Dr Philippa Brant has shown that China’s aid to Papua New Guinea has become more significant in recent years. Over the period 2006 to 2014, cumulative Chinese aid to Papua New Guinea has totalled US$440.3 million, making China the second largest bilateral donor in PNG. To put this in perspective, Australian aid over the same period (on a cumulative basis) totalled approximately US$3 billion.\n\nThe Manus Island situation came up:\n\nDr Howes argued that 'Australia has lost leverage over the PNG aid program because of the Manus regional agreement relating to asylum seekers'. He cautioned: 'Australian leverage in relation to the aid program is important not because Australia knows best or should throw its weight around. But there is the risk that Australia will not say \"no\" when it should, and will end up taking responsibility in areas beyond its capability.'\n\nAustralia’s position as regards the Torres Strait:\n\nDr Butler from the CSIRO described the Torres Strait; Western Province, PNG; and Papua Province, Indonesia as 'probably one of the most complicated social or political areas of the world': One of the big questions that is emerging is the rapid growth of both the population and the economy in Papua Province is placing enormous pressure on the communities on the New Guinean side of the border and therefore, by association, with Australia as well. At the moment the Torres Strait Treaty, being a bilateral treaty, does not really cope with a lot of those pressures that are coming from just a few kilometres away, literally, across the border.\n\nThe CSIRO stated: Although Indonesia and PNG are connected by land, Australia has not succeeded in integrating Australia-PNG-Indonesia trilateral initiatives. This is of critical importance to Australia's northern border of the Torres Strait, where current arrangements under the PNG-Australia Torres Strait Treaty can only manage environmental, fisheries, health, biosecurity and border security issues relating to these two countries.\n\nHowever, the PNG-Indonesia border also adjoins the Torres Strait, and the rapid development of Indonesia's Papua Province is driving new pressures on the border region, such as illegal trade, people movements, biosecurity and environmental impacts. Consequently, a tri-partite approach to managing the Torres Strait Western Province-Papua Province border may be necessary, supported by collaborative research and development to analyse trans-boundary issues and solutions.\n\nThe Torres Strait Treaty between PNG and Australia, signed in 1978, governs the sovereignty over the islands in the Torres Strait and establishes maritime boundaries, and seabed and fisheries jurisdiction lines.\n\nThe Gizra Tribe, located in the Western Province of PNG, argued that developmental issues for economic sustainability could be addressed through the Torres Strait Treaty. They held the belief that through the review of the Treaty 'bilateral aid to Western Province can be easily channelled through these arrangements without any interference from corrupt bureaucrats in Port Moresby'. The Gizra Tribe requested this matter be the subject of a separate parliamentary inquiry.’\n\nACFID's view that such a large and rapid shift in itself presents serious risks to the wellbeing of vulnerable groups in PNG. This is particularly the case given current issues with governance and institutions in PNG and the low levels of government service provision. ACFID emphasises that any transition that does occur must be appropriately staged in a manner that accounts for the current lack of government capacity, and be supported with strong and sustained investment in local capacity building and systems strengthening. Appropriate safeguards must also be put in place to ensure this transition does not pose a risk to the most vulnerable in the short or longer term.\n\nThe committee’s views and recommendations in summary overview:\n\nDevelopment assistance to PNG cannot be considered in isolation from the rest of Australia's aid program. The committee has previously identified a lack of strategic clarity in the Australia Government's approach to foreign aid. This is perhaps best illustrated by the recent changes to the funding to Australia's overseas aid programs.\n\nDespite earlier bipartisan commitments to the goal of increasing Australia's overseas aid to 0.5 per cent of GNI, Australia's foreign aid budget has been the subject of substantial reductions. The 2015 OECD DAC assessment of overseas aid identified Australia as a country with one of the 'largest decreases recorded'. Australia's ODA/GNI ratio was 0.27 per cent in 2015, down from 0.31 per cent in 2014.\n\nMy reading of this report is the usual all things to all people and that a government of the day may well only accept the report and then bury it like so many others. But this report has appeared during a ‘caretaker’ government in the middle of a general election.\n\nWhat chances are there it will ever get any traction or rubber of the road?\n\nBILL BROWN MBE\n\nIN KAINANTU in late 1953, with Assistant District Officer Harry West returned from a long patrol to the Fore, I was planning a follow-up patrol to the Lamari, but it did not work out that way.\n\nDistrict Commissioner Ian Downs decreed that the Lamari patrol was to be delayed until after he had made an aerial survey of the area in the New Year.\n\nIn the late afternoon of News Years Day, Downs duly arrived in a de Havilland DH84 Dragon flown by Ray Harris, the boss of Territory Airlines.\n\nThe next morning, we took off with Harris in the single pilot’s seat in the nose of the aircraft, Downs and West perched behind him on bench seats on either side of the aircraft and me in the rear.\n\nDowns and West could see some of the countryside ahead but I could only see a little to the side. That was odd, as I was the one who needed to see the terrain over which I was about to walk.\n\nThe further we flew down the valley, the more precipitous it appeared, the more the engines chattered and the more I thought about engine failure.\n\nThe aircraft had no radio, so we had no contact with the outside world. I could not help thinking about the story Downs had related the previous evening: that during the ANGAU period, in about 1944, the survivors of a Liberator bomber crash near Mount Michael had been killed and eaten by the local people.\n\nOn my earlier Lamari patrol, I had very much relied on three police constables: Tokam, a Chimbu from the Kamanaku, now promoted to Lance Corporal; Homugei from Watabung; and Pita from Bena-Bena. I had retained them, and secured an additional expert, Afuti from Bena-Bena.\n\nWith the exception of a Sepik, Kausingut, the eight members of my new team were from the Eastern Highlands. They all had joined the police in the post-war years and they had done so, in the customary way, by volunteering at the nearest kiap outstation.\n\nThey had then undertaken a six-month boot camp style course at Goroka where they had been groomed, taught foot drill and learnt a little about the law.\n\nNone of them could read or write, they did not understand the English language, they knew nothing of legal niceties such as the Judges’ Rules, but they were intrepid bushmen.\n\nTen days after the flight, our patrol set out for the lower Lamari: eight police, one medical orderly and 45 carriers. Don Shepherd, a 22-year-old didiman from Aiyura Agricultural Station joined us to see the country and to keep me company.\n\nThe objectives were to explore the right bank of the Lamari River south of the Aziana junction and to investigate the reported murders of two natives from Ilessa village by their Obutasa neighbours.\n\nIt took seven days to reach to our real kick-off point: we trekked through the Taiora grasslands, over the ridge to the Parokiti valley, thence over the next ridge to Kamira in the Kasane valley, and finally to Purossa.\n\nSome of the Kamira and Purossa people were wearing waist bands adorned with mussel shells with one or two sporting well-worn shirts and pieces of mosquito netting.\n\nThe netting was said to have come from Tapu village on a big river five days walk away through uninhabited country. They had never visited it and nobody knew how to get there but they knew there were coconuts, canoes and fish at Tapu.\n\nTwo days later we stumbled on the palisaded hamlets of Azapindi, Kakilliwind and Agagovints almost at the junction of the Kasane mountain stream with the Lamari River.\n\nThe hamlets had never been visited before but some of the residents had seen previous patrols at Purossa. Despite the palisades they were friendly, both men and women bringing food to trade, and then remaining to gossip.\n\nThey also knew about Tapu village but said that they knew nothing of tracks leading to the south, so the police spent a day searching.\n\nWe scrambled through the thick rain forest for the next two days, occasionally seeing the glimmer of a track, but no landmarks. The trees were huge, too big to cut, so we built our overnight shelters between them.\n\nAt times we were hacking our way forward but, even when we were not, stinging nettles lashed legs and arms, prickly cane grabbed our clothes and on every leaf leeches swayed ready to attach.\n\nIt was torture, but the Highland police and my Kamanaku cook were in raptures because the forest was thick with Vulturine parrots, which the Highlanders prized for their plumage.\n\nMy compass said that we were walking on a general bearing of 210 degrees, a heading that should have been parallel to the Lamari. The police had been challenging my navigation and laughed as we broke out of the forest on the rim of a gorge, with the river winding across our path, 500 metres below.\n\nSix days after we left Purossa, we reached the Ta-arata, a lowland stream of crystal-clear water flowing slowly over a gravel bed edged by lush green growth and breadfruit trees.\n\nThe luluai of Kamira who a week earlier had denied all knowledge of tracks to the south was waiting on the bank with a broad, welcoming smile.\n\nWe descended 1,350 metres to reach Soi-inantu only to find that there were no fish, no prawns, no canoes and no coconuts. But the men spoke Police Motu, most of them had worked for the Australasian Petroleum Company and they had been visited only by one patrol - from the Gulf - years before.\n\nWe were short of food and my Highlands team members did not like the only local food available, sago. It was time to retrace our steps, and to trek up-river through a chaos of spurs, ravines and peaks to Ilessa and Iakea.\n\nBoth villages had been visited by a number of patrols since 1946, and every patrol leader had told them to cease fighting, threatened them with punishment if they did not and assured them of Administration protection.\n\nThey had ceased fighting and now they wanted the Administration to honour their promise of protection.\n\nWe arrived and they went to the gardens for food but the Obutasa struck again, killing a food gatherer. It was time to act.\n\nWe were delayed a day by the flooded Lamari River but eventually bridged it and struggled up the 580 metre escarpment to Obutasa.\n\nStatements made by the police provide this description of subsequent events:\n\nConstable Afuti, 12 March 1954:\n\nLast December [1953] I heard that two Ilessa natives had been killed by natives of Obutasa village. I reported this… The ADO told me that a patrol would make an investigation as soon as possible. I left Kainantu with Mr Brown on a patrol…\n\nThe Luluai of Ilessa… told us that the Obutasa natives had that day killed another Ilessa man… We went to Obutasa. About 70 people surrounded the patrol There were plenty of natives around the hills at distances of 50 yards and more armed with bows, arrows and shields decorated with cassowary feathers.\n\nL/Cpl Tokam, 12 March 1954:\n\nOn Saturday the 13th February 1954 we descended to the Lamari River and slept on the bank. We went to Obutasa village on Sunday. On Wednesday some men from Obutasa village came to the camp. Natives armed with bows and arrows and carrying shields watched the camp from the nearby ridges. I think these were natives of the next two villages who had come to assist the Obutasa. We were instructed to arrest some men indicated to us…\n\nAs soon as we arrested the men spears began to fall around and in the camp. These spears (arrows) were for fired from a short distance about forty yards away and hit hard. Mr. Brown fired a warning shot but the arrows continued to fall in the camp. I saw Mr Brown and Constable Afuti move forward. If Mr. Brown had not move quickly he would have been hit by the arrows.\n\nThere were three men beneath the camp as well as a large group above the camp. They were coming around to attack us from the rear firing arrows as they went. They were just below the camp and the arrows they were firing were dangerous. They took no notice of the warning shots so I fired at one of them. He fell down and the other two men ran away… He was dead.\n\nWhen the investigation was completed, I explained to the men in custody what was going to happen to them. Eight were to be released and could return to the village, and six were going to Kainantu to face the court.\n\nWe walked back into Kainantu on 20 February and the enquiries and paper war began, and continued for four months. It started with my report then there was a police enquiry.\n\nHarry West, as Coroner, determined an inquest was not necessary, but Australian Territories Minister Paul Hasluck intervened and a coronial enquiry was held.\n\nHasluck commented that his remarks were general ones and \"not criticising the conduct of ADO West whom I know is an officer with a good record and sound experience.\"\n\nMy report provoked both support and a mild admonition from headquarters in Port Moresby, which observed: “Only six native policeman were with the patrol leader, two others being sick and left at Iakea”.\n\nActing District Commissioner Les (LH) Williams added: “It had escaped my notice that, at the time of the attack on the patrol, Mr Brown had with him only six native policeman… Future patrols to the South Lamari area will include a minimum of twelve native police.”\n\nMaybe he could not read. I had eight police constables with me. Lindsay, on the two initial Lamari patrols, including the hazardous round trip to Menyamya,had been accompanied by only five.\n\nThe Administrator added, “Mr WT Brown, Patrol Officer, who was in charge of the patrol is not a Coroner.” Someone had misinformed him. I was appointed a Coroner in July 1953, but as I was leading the operation and had fired the first shot, I did not see it appropriate to conduct an enquiry into my own actions.\n\nThe Minister’s direction to the Administrator was specific:\n\n“Please watch carefully all such cases to ensure that Coroner’s inquests are held promptly and that so far as local conditions permit, they fulfill the strictest requirement of an inquest and do not become a mere form.\n\n“I recognize such incidents are more likely to occur in remote areas than near the centre of population and I also recognise that it may be difficult to avoid a situation such as apparently existed at Kainantu, in which the ADO first conducts the police inquiry and then puts on a different necktie and conducts the Coroner’s inquest.\n\n“The administrator … will appreciate the need for overcoming such situations, in the interests of the officers concerned and of the reputation of the Administration generally, as well as to ensure that the requirements of the law and the theory of the law in respect of death by violence are satisfied.\n\n“Unusual difficulties can be used to explain why this standard cannot always be achieved but they do not allow us to give up trying to achieve that standard.”\n\nPatrol Officer John (JR) McArthur led the next patrol to Obutasa and, on his return, District Commissioner Downs commented, “Considering that fact that the last two patrols to the area were attacked, his reception by the native people is somewhat surprising until one remembers that, with the establishment of the Okapa Patrol Post, the Administration is only 15 hours walk from the farthest village.”\n\nMcArthur had been organising the construction of the Patrol Post for some five months, and during that period men from Obutasa had initiated friendship with the Administration. They had “pulled a pig through to the station” then “the six time-expired prisoners had arrived from Kainantu to be repatriated to their village by the patrol.”\n\nHe had followed the same route I had taken, used my campsites and, at Iakea, encountered nine men from Obutasa who told him that they had prepared houses for the patrol.\n\nNear Obutasa, eight unarmed men met the patrol and led them through irrigated taro gardens to a campsite where about 50 unarmed people were gathered. “Water had been run into camp by means of bamboo lines. The two houses, which had been built, were sufficient for the police and carriers. [Later] almost a hundred Obutasa people came singing into the camp. The leaders were carrying a large pig, which they threw in front of my tent. They placed a plumed tanket beside it – a sign or peace.”\n\nThe two other villages in the area provided a similar friendly reception: prepared a campsite and houses for the patrol; men, women and children visited, food and pigs were provided.\n\nHow things had changed since my visit, and confrontation, just six months earlier.\n\nNotes\n\nMap of the Obitasa patrol (Bill Brown)\n\n[Photo 01] VH-AON, Territory Airlines DH84 de Havilland Dragon, Eastern Highlands. 1954.\n\n[Photo 02] The lower Lamari River valley from the air. 1954.\n\n[Photo 03] The patrol moving through the grasslands.

I gave up a long time ago trying to explain to others who had not served in PNG.\n\nSome of the reasons and explanations I’ve canvassed include the following.\n\nFirstly, when I first arrived in PNG, I was, at 20 years of age, young, naïve and immature - in a physical and cognitive developmental sense, and in the ways of the adult world.\n\nThose early years of service were, then, my rite of passage, my initiation, if you like, into adulthood and, as such, have left a deep, lasting intellectual and emotional attachment to that time and place and the people with whom and for whom I served.\n\nSecondly, my motivations for going to PNG were, at their core, idealistic.\n\nWhile a sense of adventure, doing something quite different from my peers and escaping the routines of suburban Australian life were also contributing factors, the opportunity to do some good for others was certainly one of my primary motivations – even if they were tinged by more than a semblance of paternalism.\n\nThirdly, and as arrogant as it sounds, I thought that, through teaching young Papua New Guineans, I was helping in some small way to build a nation and help PNG acquire political and economic independence.\n\nThose latter thoughts were rarely, if ever, at the forefront of my mind during the nearly 10 years I spent in PNG: I was too engrossed in the daily grind of my work, study and social pursuits to pay any overt attention to them.\n\nAnd it was through those pursuits that I forged numerous connections and friendships with Papua New Guineans and, through them, acquired a modicum of understanding about the Melanesian way of life.\n\nUntil the election of the Whitlam government, I shared the commonly held but misplaced view that PNG’s political independence was probably a decade or more away.\n\nWhen it came, and like many others, I accepted the TE Lawrence view of the world which, in modified form, circulated throughout Konedobu at the time: ‘Better that they do it tolerably than that you do it perfectly. It is their country, and you are to help them, not to do it for them. Actually, under the very odd conditions of Papua New Guinea, your practical work will not be as good as, perhaps, you think it is.’\n\nAnd that remains my view today.\n\nSo, like my lapun colleagues, I have observed PNG’s progress and development closely, with fluctuating surges of pride, joy, disappointment and occasional despair.\n\nI have felt so because I did play a role, however small, I did forge connections and friendships and I continue to do so, and I continue to want the very best for the people of PNG.\n\nThat’s why I care, Sonja.\n\nKEITH JACKSON\n\nHal Holman OL OAM was cremated yesterday near Beenleigh in Queensland. I was honoured to be asked to deliver a eulogy.\n\nHAL HOLMAN lived a long and productive life and I want to represent some of that life in this tribute.\n\nA year or so ago, his wife Jo edited and published - in a limited but finely produced volume -Hal’s memoir, The Phoenix Rises Eternal.\n\nHal had written the book over many years but had found that his struggles with computers and earlier editors difficult to overcome.\n\nHal’s voice speaks clearly and authentically from those pages, and the anecdotes emerge gloriously in all their comedy as if he himself were there.\n\nYes, Hal could create great words as well as art and sculpture and, as with much that he created, it revealed the poetry, beauty - and the struggle - that lay within him.\n\nIn the introduction to the memoir Hal writes:\n\n“I make no rash claims of my importance or my worthwhileness. I have no role models. I do not copy others or force my views on anyone.\n\n“I have the greatest admiration for all who strive for worthwhile goals of their choice, and applaud their diligence, whether they succeed or fall short of their aspirations.\n\n“Just being a good person who lives an exemplary life is accomplishment enough. Being a loving Mum or Dad wins top marks as does being a forthright person without guile.”\n\nOf course, Hal’s long life proved to be very different from the triumph of the Everyman who he honours in those words.\n\nIndeed, Hal may have sometimes have wished he could be Everyman, living an exemplary but sedate life. But he was not cut from such cloth.\n\nHal Holman excelled in painting, sculpture, design and being alive.\n\nI’m sure he would also have liked to have excelled in better understanding women, but that proved to be a more contested struggle.\n\nAs an artist, Hal distinguished himself by attaining the upper reaches of his profession, especially seen in his creation of the iconography of Papua New Guinea’s nationhood, everything from the national crest to postage stamps, and very much between.\n\nFor this substantial contribution, Hal received from Papua Ne Guinea the high award of Officer in the Order of Logohu.\n\nHe also distinguished himself in his contribution to public art in Australia, for which he was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia.\n\nFor me personally, he distinguished himself as a mate of 50 years. Hal and I had half a century of being agreeable.\n\nIf you look back on Hal’s rich life, it has a storybook quality.\n\nA commando in wartime. A distinguished artist, designer and sculptor. A charismatic man who loved women even if he never understood them. A man of grand ideas, many of which were realised.\n\nSome were not – like the enormous portrait of a nude that didn’t make it through the preliminaries of the Archibald Prize despite its eight breasts.\n\nOr the massive ferro-cement catamaran which sank leaving Port Moresby harbour.\n\nLet me note here just some of Hal’s creations worthy of specific mention.\n\nHe made a major and controversial contribution to the design of Papua New Guinea’s national flag, the Kumul, with its soaring bird of paradise.\n\nControversial because this was one of those triumphs claimed by many but was in fact the consequence of one man’s inspiration, experience and insight.\n\nJust as spectacularly, but without the controversy, was his design of the Papua New Guinea national crest.\n\nHe later rendered the crest in one tonne of steel with the sculpture that dominates the façade of Supreme Court building in Port Moresby. And this – his first significant sculpture - was completed in just four weeks.\n\nAround the same time, he produced a twice life-size bronze of Queen Elizabeth II commissioned by Britain as an independence gift to Papua New Guinea.\n\nMuch later, in the early 2000s, Hal was asked to produce bronze busts of PNG’s first six prime ministers.\n\nOne of the prime ministers didn’t like his rendition and it had to be recast. Another, whose reputation suffered a dip, had his likeness hidden in a garden shed for some years.\n\nBut all six now reside for the people of PNG to reflect upon in Port Moresby’s parliamentary gardens.\n\nAnd in Australia, there’s the cast bronze of Filipino national hero, Jose Rizal, which was unveiled by then Philippines President Fidel Ramos in a park near Sydney’s Central Railway Station.\n\nThere’s a 50 meter decorative steel fence in Sydney’s Centennial Park….\n\nThe leadlight doors and windows at a chapel in Pokolbin, NSW, together with its wrought iron large-than-life-sized figure of Christ on the cross….\n\nThe sculpted steel archway entrance to Bancroft Park at Roseville in Sydney….\n\nAnd the black swans in fibreglass and steel which once flew over Darling Harbour in Sydney before some swine did away with them.\n\nOut at Gordon Public Library there’s a children’s secret garden where resides a lifesize steel giraffe and bronze bas relief of fairies, pixies and gnomes.\n\nBack in PNG there is an eight meter high stainless steel bird of paradise situated on a roundabout on a major highway adjacent to Parliament House….\n\nAnd a more diminutive three meter high bronze fountain at the University of Papua New Guinea.\n\nTwo of Hal’s later works were the bust of General John Baker, Chief of the Australian Defence Force, unveiled in 2009 by then prime minister Kevin Rudd, and the iconic sculpture of the mermaid at Mermaid Beach.\n\nAnd these great works of sculpture represent just some of Hal’s output along with hundreds of oil paintings, pastels and watercolours - landscapes, portraits, flora and fauna, particularly the Bird of Paradise. His paintings and drawings are in private collections and in galleries around the world.\n\nI met Hal in Port Moresby in 1966. I was 21 and had been transferred from my school in the bush to write and edit the school magazines. Hal, a couple of decades my senior, was the illustrator. He was also my tutor in the technicalities of printing and the night life of Moresby.\n\nBut let me go back even further.\n\nIn 1942, as a 20-year old, Hal volunteered for the Australian Infantry Forces and within weeks of enlistment was promoted to the rank of sergeant due to his earlier cadet training at Sydney Boys High School.\n\nWhile serving as an instructor in Dubbo, he volunteered to join the 2/6 Independent Commando Squadron and fought with this unit in the highlands and coastal areas of New Guinea.\n\nLater, as war subsided, he was with the American marines in New Britain. This wartime experience began a long association with Australia’s onetime Territory.\n\nIn 1945, upon demobilisation, Hal attended the Julian Ashton Fine Art School and East Sydney Technical College, from where he secured a Diploma of Art.\n\nHe then spent three years as art director with an advertising agency in India, working in New Delhi, Calcutta and Bombay, before returning to Australia and six years as an animator and set designer in the film industry.\n\nIn 1965 he drifted to Port Moresby, where his sister Lexie ran a guest house, and in early 1966 secured an appointment as senior illustrator with the Department of Education, which is where we met.\n\nAs I moved on to the ABC a year later, Hal joined the Department of Information where he produced the iconography of the nation that was about to emerge - the flag, the crest, the livery for Air Niugini, postage stamps, the uniform for the police band, there was so much.\n\nHe instructed and mentored Papua New Guineans in graphic design and print production, creating a human as well as an artistic legacy.\n\nDuring this period, he was provided with government accommodation in Port Moresby whereupon he began to construct, in the backyard, a 27 tonne, ferro-concrete catamaran.\n\nEven before the first steel rod was bent and tied, it was christened Phoenix. His expressed intent was to “build a boat and sail away” whenever he might want to.\n\nThat was not to happen – Hal returned to Australia without Phoenix after running out of money and selling the completed hull which, when being towed to Cairns, sank in a big swell outside the entrance to Port Moresby harbour. “Bad towing,” Hal would say.\n\nBut the experience of working with thousands of steel rods - welding, bending, cementing, forging - had been transformational for Hal. As he wrote later: “It had launched me into the beginnings of my destiny as a sculptor.”\n\nAnd this man, whose brain and eyes and hands could invoke the most remarkable works of art, soared to another level of creation. He was a very good artist but he became a great sculptor.\n\nMeanwhile I was building my career as a radio producer in the ABC; on one occasion, under the misapprehension that the effervescent Holman might be able to act, casting him for a small role in a nautical drama. Most of his character ended up on the editing room floor except for the exclamation, “Land ho!”\n\n“Easiest $6.76 I ever made,” Hal would remind me for years after, adding that he also continued to receive royalties for the repeat broadcasts.\n\nMeanwhile, Hal’s respective girlfriends continued to accumulate and, where Hal and women were concerned, the life of all contestants would soon become entangled and ensnared in complex webs of intrigue.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Hal left government employ for the first and last time, unimpressed by bosses, bureaucracy and bulldust. To be fair, he was often treated badly by his superiors, probably because he never tolerated fools of any rank.\n\nHis government career had been brief but prolific and there had been keenly felt disappointments. The unseemly dispute about who was responsible for the design of the national flag, where the kudos was given to a schoolgirl who won a colouring in contest.\n\nAnd, when the Supreme Court was opened by the Queen, who unveiled the crest Hal had wrought in steel, he was not invited, which left him frustrated and bitter.\n\nNot long before PNG’s independence in 1975, Hal returned to Australia and freelanced in graphic design and film animation before spending eight years as art director at Sterling Pharmaceuticals in Sydney.\n\nHe hated this corporate bureaucracy as much as he had detested government bureaucracy but stuck it out recognising the need for some stability in his life.\n\nDuring this time he also began sculpting in other media, with his first major commission being the production of the black fibreglass and steel swans that flew elegantly over Darling Harbour’s festival marketplace.\n\nThis period included a one-man retrospective exhibition of his sculptures and paintings at Martin Place in Sydney, which I can remember launching and being told by one of his Army mates that Hal’s nickname in the commandos was Gidge.\n\nHal’s transition to sculpting really took off in the 1980s and ignited a new phase of his life as an artist as he began to produce significant public sculpture in steel and bronze. He also began teaching part-time at community art centres and at TAFE.\n\nHe continued to visit Papua New Guinea where he picked up commissions, some of them of great importance, and sold paintings. On Australia Day 2004, he was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia the citation reading: “for service to the arts as a designer and sculptor”.\n\nI was there too, receiving my own award from NSW Governor, Marie Bashir. It was a great day for both of us.\n\nBut there was a gap in Hal’s life that continued to gnaw at him. He had done so much for the national iconography of Papua New Guinea and had fought for that country in war but no formal recognition had been forthcoming.\n\nWell, that all changed towards the end of 2008 when Hal was told by the PNG government that he would be awarded the high national honour of Officer of the Order of Logohu. At last the ledger was balanced and the angst subsided.\n\nEarly in 2009 I received an anxious phone call from the PNG high commissioner in Canberra, Charles Lepani, an acquaintance of mine. Could I arrange a function in which Charles could invest Hal with his award? And could I arrange the audience?\n\nA group of us political, media and PNG types were in the habit of meeting every couple of months at the Mido restaurant in Sydney. One of these lunches could be converted into an official occasion. Charles agreed to foot the bill.\n\nSo about 30 friends and family gathered at Mido, Hal resplendent in the Blue Devil’s commando uniform which still fitted him like a glove. Charles thanked Hal for his contribution to PNG through design, sculpture and art, offering the gratitude of the people of PNG.\n\n“This is the greatest day of my life,” Hal said, the Order of Logohu hanging from his neck, adding that, although he had been honoured by his own country, receiving one of PNG’s highest honours was even more special.\n\nThe gathering was of good cheer, especially as someone else was paying, and drank of fine wine and ate of expensive seafood.\n\nAs people began to drift away, a worried Charles Lepani approached me. The bill had been far more than he had anticipated, he said, especially the drinks bill. Could I pick that up? I did.\n\nIn his memoir, Hal wrote a brief preamble which he entitled, Stand firm upon this stone…. And I think this is a fitting valedictory….\n\nWith all your strength and concentration know that you command a foundation upon which to build the rest of your life.\n\nIt starts right here and now.\n\nLet this stone represent to you, a bulwark against adversity-the beginnings of a buttress to your fortress, and the keystone of your doorway to the future.\n\nTread warily the arid sands of promises - the quicksand that is the quagmire of excess. Walk softly upon the sacred soil of your departed forebears.\n\nStand taller on this stone than you ever were before, be it unaided or with friendly encouragement; whilst there, give thanks to your Creator for your existence.\n\nStep up to a higher level and discover a wider horizon – a new perspective. Stand tall above your tribulations. Stand firm in your beliefs.\n\nDon’t trample on the sensitivities of your fellow human beings. We are all temporary tenants on this planet Earth.\n\nMake it worthwhile.\n\nBy moving your droplet you will help the course of human love.\n\nYou will have earned that love.\n\nGREGORY BABLIS\n\nIN 2006, when I was doing my undergraduate studies at Divine Word University in Madang, I wrote five poems. It was part of the assessment tasks for a course on contemporary literature in which we were required to write about current issues in Papua New Guinea.\n\nI have never before shared them, except with my lecturer of course.\n\nThe beauty of poetry is that it never becomes redundant. The verses in poems are malleable messages of modernity instilled with transcendent transcripts of the values of society and prevalent cultural norms.\n\nThe issues I perceived a decade ago are still relevant today at some level of society. As our country develops, old issues still linger, and even as we try to lay old issues to rest, new ones appear.\n\nIt is by learning from how we dealt with old problems that helps us to deal with new problems. And so a poem is the capturing of a moment in time and history that reverberates and recycles itself in any era in which it may be read.\n\nThe first two poems are published here; may they be for you whatever you need them to be.\n\nOld Man\n\nGREGORY BABLIS\n\nOld Man is as much about an old man as it is a metaphorical presumption of PNG and the rigors of democratisation, globalisation and western influences on PNG.\n\nOld man,\n\nWhat have they left you now?\n\nHave they left you your mind,\n\nThat once sliced and diced\n\nA piercing intellect so ready\n\nTo spew out those sharp answers?\n\nOld man,\n\nWhere is it now?\n\nIs it still in there, hidden away\n\nBeneath the mindless media mayhem?\n\nHave they left you your spirit so free\n\nThat once challenged many a mountain\n\nYour boldness and dashing personality,\n\nThat drank non-stop from a fountain.\n\nOld man,\n\nWhere is it now?\n\nIs it still alive in there\n\nUnder that heavy haze of cloud?\n\nHave they left you your body, now so frail\n\nThat used to run so far and so swiftly\n\nThat massive chest and those arms so strong\n\nThat carried her over the threshold that very first night?\n\nOld man,\n\nWhere is it now?\n\nIt’s all been melted away\n\nTo that skeleton strapped in the wheelchair.\n\nHave they left you your love\n\nThat won over all of them\n\nA small baby, an adolescent, a fair lady and all the above\n\nThey basked in your radiance, which shone like a gem.\n\nOld man,\n\nWhere is it now?\n\nAs you grimace so mean.\n\nIs it plastic and dead like the rest of your world?\n\nHave they left you your splendid face\n\nThat once wooed a hundred princesses?\n\nThose noble features so rugged and fine\n\nThe envy of women wherever you went.\n\nOld man,\n\nWhere is it now?\n\nThat stringy hair, that hooked nose and toothless grin\n\nIt’s all been sucked away, by people so perfect.\n\nHave they left you your pride\n\nYou were once so justly proud.\n\nThey all looked up to you, in you they could confide\n\nA man of honour, beauty and honesty, outspoken and loud\n\nOld man,\n\nWhere is it now?\n\nThe babytalk nurses, hand feeding you\n\nHave squeezed it from you, every last morsel.\n\nHave they left you your hope\n\nThat saw an endless future\n\nThat spoke of great grandchildren,\n\nAnd a world of goodness and light.\n\nOld man,\n\nWhere is it now?\n\nYes, it’s buried so deep, far from reach\n\nIn the grey concrete beneath your feet.\n\nHave they left you your soul\n\nThat lifted you in times of need\n\nYour very being, your lifeblood, your whole\n\nBreathed into your once newborn seed.\n\nOld man,\n\nWhere is it now?\n\nHas it already left you, escaping the pain,\n\nOr has it turned to cement, like the rest of the world?\n\nOld man,\n\nWhat have they left you now?\n\nHave they left you anything at all?\n\nSounds of War!\n\nGREGORY BABLIS\n\nWhen I wrote Sounds of War, events such as World War II, the Bougainville crisis and violent internal conflicts and tribal warfare loomed large in my mind.\n\nThe 8 June UPNG shootings have come to represent for me the fight to save our country from corruption and tyranny of immoral leadership.\n\nThis event is a reminder that, in history, sometimes blood has to be spilled for the required change to be effected.

Thus her exit is raising fears that a domino effect could follow with other countries leaving the union. Questions are now being asked if the EU will survive.\n\nThere is evidence indicating that right wing ‘nationalists’ in other countries are now pushing for an exit from the EU. One could argue that this is rather premature given Britain and the EU have not yet seen the full extent of the Brexit outcome.\n\nThree million Britons have petitioned the government to revoke the decision and parliament had yet to address the outcome of the referendum.\n\nMore importantly for the United Kingdom, Brexit is already raising questions of independence for Scotland and the reunification of Ireland. So Britain’s exit could lead to other important developments that could re-shape her own and Europe’s future.\n\nWhile the pro-Europeans are in tears; the Eurosceptics who have longed seen the arrangement as repressive and wanted their country to choose its own destiny are enjoying their victory.\n\nIn Europe, as in Britain, more and more people are demanding that their own governments take a tougher stance against immigration. Britain’s exit is the Eurosceptics’s finest hour and their call for protecting national borders is echoing across Europe.\n\nThe Brexit is creating a ripple effect around the world. Already stock markets have been pummeled and the pound sterling has seen its worst drop in a very long time. For us in the Pacific, the result seems likely to hit our shores sooner rather than later.\n\nIn 2007, the EU concluded an interim partnership with PNG and Fiji, paving the way for eventual formal implementation.\n\nThe EU is currently negotiating a comprehensive economic partnership agreement with all 14 island states in the south Pacific. The comprehensive agreement will cover trade in goods and services, development cooperation, food health and safety, agriculture, sustainable development and competition.\n\nThe Brexit looks as though the EU might put a temporary halt to this negotiation. Britain, for its part, is going to have to negotiate an exit strategy with the EU which seems likely to have effects in this part of the world including a renegotiation of the terms of the economic partnership agreement.\n\nThe interim agreement provided PNG with duty free access into the British and European markets; a renegotiation could potentially turn this around and affect PNG’s economy – especially its foreign reserves which are already under pressure.\n\nThis would spell disaster for PNG given its current economic condition where problems in the foreign reserves have forced the government to pursue extraordinary borrowing measures.\n\nThe decision by Britain to hold a referendum to decide its future in the EU has brought to the forefront the important question of whether the Pacific could emulate a similar economic union.\n\nThere is merit for such a set-up to facilitate trade and labour mobility – and it is an issue that has recently gained recognition.\n\nThere is also a need to establish a common security policy to address terrorism, illegal fishing, transnational crime, human smuggling and border protection. Most Pacific Island nations have just a tiny military to protect their borders or exclusive economic zones.\n\nThe Melanesian Spearhead Group also needs a common voice to address West Papua’s push for independence from Indonesia.\n\nUnlike Europe, the Pacific countries have limited resources to be able to stand up individually to negotiate trade and security issues. Through a collective arrangement, the more powerful Pacific island countries like PNG might, in time, be able to support economically depressed countries of the region.\n\nThe Pacific islands nations could explore introducing a common currency. However, as we have seen with the Greek crisis, such an option is not presently viable in a region which is prone to global market shocks.\n\nNevertheless, having a common currency could ease payments for trade in raw materials and reduce transaction costs to boost tourism.\n\nCHARLES YALA | PNG National Research Institute | Edited extracts\n\nI PUT out for public discussion, especially within Papua New Guinea and Indonesia, the idea of opening up the Island of New Guinea.\n\nFrom the outset, I want to emphasise that I acknowledge the cultural, political, and security arguments involved. I restrict my arguments to the economic benefits that are likely to arise from opening up the island of New Guinea.\n\nI am personally convinced that there would be significant economic benefits via the facilitation or enhancement of trade, investment, and movement of people between the west and the east of the island of New Guinea.\n\nThe island of New Guinea is divided almost equally between PNG and Indonesia. The original inhabitants are of Melanesian descent. The total population is estimated to be 12.2 million people: 4.4 million on the Indonesian side and 7.8 million in PNG. The island is rich in natural resources: minerals, oil, gas, timber, and fertile agricultural land, and tourism opportunities.\n\nTogether, the island can be an economic powerhouse located strategically between Australia and New Zealand to the south and Asia, the fastest developing region in the world, to the west and north.\n\nAt present, the island is not economically or physically integrated, neither internally nor externally, especially with the rest of the region. PNG, in particular, is so physically isolated that trade with the rest of the world is a critical challenge for the nation.\n\nFor instance, Jacksons International Airport in Port Moresby is the only international airline gateway to the rest of the world. Connections between Port Moresby and the rest of the country remain expensive and difficult.\n\nLikewise, Lae and Port Moresby are the main ports that facilitate the bulk of international trade. Internal maritime and land transport linkages between these two ports remain difficult and costly. This fragmentation remains a significant constraint to broad-based, sustained economic growth and development in PNG.\n\nPNG’s sustained growth and development as a nation is dependent on its ability to facilitate domestic and international trade. Improving transportation and communication systems are needed to reduce the costs of goods and services and improve access to markets for local products.\n\nIt will also improve the capability of the government to deliver and for people to access basic services such as health and education. It is these considerations that have motivated me to put the case for the opening up of the island of New Guinea.\n\nThe proposal for opening up the island of New Guinea foresees Indonesia and PNG working collaboratively along the international border. As a start, I propose, in a very crude way, the idea of four cities and three highways as the core elements of the proposal to open up the island of New Guinea.\n\nThe four cities that I envisage are:\n\nOne Port or Maritime City on the South side of the border to the west of Daru, on the Indonesian side, largely because the PNG side of the border is mostly swampy. The exact location of this city, however, would be dictated by the engineering soundness of a substantial port that could serve as the foundation of trade between South East Asia, Australia, PNG, and Indonesia.\n\nTwo port cities on the north side of the island: Vanimo on the PNG side and Jayapura on the Indonesia side. These are existing towns, but they will need to be developed and expanded significantly.\n\nOne hinterland city situated halfway between the north and south of the island of New Guinea, along the international border between PNG and Indonesia. This city has to be strategically located with the view to connecting by road to the east of the island, making a connection to the existing highlands highway, and to the western end of the island. A maritime city could be developed in the west end by Indonesia at a location like Timaka.\n\nLikewise, PNG would need to ensure that the road connects to the port cities of Lae and Madang, with the road running through the existing city of Mt. Hagen.\n\nThe three highways, critical for linking the four cities and making the idea of opening up the island of New Guinea a reality, are:\n\nNorth-South Highway: this highway would connect the south port city with the two northern maritime cities, passing through the hinterland city. This super-highway along the international border will be critical for connecting trade links with the Asian countries to the north through the two port cities. Likewise, this highway will connect trade links with south east asian countries, Australia, and New Zealand through the south-based port city.\n\nEast-bound Highway: this highway would connect the hinterland city with the highlands highway through Mt Hagen. This highway would connect with the existing maritime city of Lae and the township of Madang.\n\nWest-bound Highway: this highway would connect the hinterland city with a port township to the west of the island of New Guinea, which Indonesia could develop.\n\nThe exact locations will need to be subjected to detailed feasibility studies, taking into account the geography, topography, and soundness of the marine base for a port city. Collectively, the four cities and the three super highways comprise the core elements of the project that would open up the island of New Guinea.\n\nThere are engineering, financial, social, cultural, political, economic, and security considerations for all who would be affected by this proposal.\n\nWhile acknowledging that taking these issues fully into consideration is important, the premise on which this article is penned is the significant economic gains from trade and interconnectedness, especially for the inhabitants of the island of New Guinea.\n\nThe economic impact of this proposal would be significant for both PNG and Indonesia. This proposal links both economies to the fastest growing and/or strong economies of the world: Asia, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThe proposal has the potential to develop an integrated economic community within this part of the world and place PNG and Indonesia, especially West Papua, on a path to sustained, broad-based growth and development.\n\nThis proposal complements two other major projects: the Maritime Silk Road being advanced by China and the Northern Australia Policy proposed by the Australian government for the development of the northern half of the Australian continent.\n\nIf this idea is progressed by PNG and Indonesia, it could be a good candidate project for the newly-established Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.\n\nIn ending this paper, I invite genuine discussions with a view to progressing this project because the potential economic gains for all inhabitants of the island of New Guinea, and more specifically for the broader PNG community and Indonesia, in my view is significant.\n\nHence, I sign off with the question: Why not open up the island of New Guinea?\n\nRead the full paper by Charles Yala here: http://www.nri.org.pg/images/Downloads/Publications/2016_publications/Spotligt_Opening_up_New_Guinea_280616.pdf\n\nGREGORY BABLIS\n\nTHE ongoing student unrests at our universities – especially University of Goroka, Unitech and UPNG – took on a new dynamic with as yet unknown elements resorting to arson as a means of venting their anger.\n\nI do not wish to speculate here whether or not students were responsible or if external elements were involved, suffice to say that media have been reporting a mixture of both.\n\nThe absurdity of all this is that Peter O’Neil has remained oblivious to the reasons for this current state of affairs and has continued to bounce off an outpouring of calls from all levels of society for his resignation.\n\nObviously, he did not force people to burn down buildings and vehicles at the different universities but his stubbornness in not heeding these calls and continuing his propagation of a culture of impunity has created a void within which immorality, criminality and opportunistic behaviour has been allowed to proliferate.\n\nThe nature of student unrest and national movements against governments toes a very fine line between the ‘right’ side of the law and the ‘wrong’ side of the law because very often the law is manipulated, controlled and enforced by those in power.\n\nThis has been apparent in PNG under the current leadership and it did not take very much for the issues to be transformed into, and concurrently portrayed as, ethnic or political.\n\nI believe this is not necessarily the case and is just a convenience to divert the people’s attention from the real issue at hand, which is a defective leadership.\n\nIn fact, in most other vibrant democracies, these events would logically point to defective leadership and implicated leaders would have already stepped down.\n\nPlans by the current government for a commission of inquiry are also signs of a diversion and the people of PNG are already wise to this ploy.\n\nWhat should be noted with alarm are reports that the government has imposed a curfew at universities and that the PNG Defence Force will be called in to assist the police to maintain the situation.\n\nNo matter how well-intentioned, this kind of arrangement is a precursor to an authoritarian type of rule and should be scrutinised carefully.\n\nA major casualty in the ongoing unrest at UPNG has been the Book Nook, the business and brand name given to the PNG-Pacific collection of books collected and kept for sale by the UPNG Press & Bookshop, the only stock-holding bookshop in PNG and operating in the niche area of PNG and Pacific books.\n\nWith the expansion of this unique collection of books, mainly through the efforts and expertise of general manager Dr John Evans, a new space was created directly under the old bookshop at Gunther Building, the main UPNG administrative block.\n\nThe collection was moved there in 2012. However, in late 2013, the UPNG administration had the collection moved to the old Printery Building, adjacent to the Security Base. The building was burned down on Friday 24 June between 4m and 6 am. The PNG-Pacific collection is now just a pile of ashes.\n\nWhile the most recent valuation of the collection in 2015 by a US bookseller was K715,000, I would argue that this unique collection was priceless as a cultural and historical heritage that marketed PNG to the rest of the world through the sales of books on PNG history, biology, law, anthropology, literature, linguistics, medicine, poetry, agriculture, culture, prehistory and other aspects of PNG society.\n\nThe monetary value simply would not do justice to the value of the books that have been burned along with the building in which they were housed.\n\nWhile much has been published about PNG, the bulk of this has been done outside the country and, over the years, the bookshop has built its international credibility and capacity to import these books into the country and to print and publish books itself.\n\nIndeed some of the books that have been lost were scarce and it will take many more years to replenish their number. Some notable original Press & Bookshop titles and prints lost in the fire include Sana: An Autobiography of Michael Somare, Arise, Sir Thomas! The Autobiography of Sir Thomas Ritako, Ebia Olewale: A Life of Service, and Nameless Warriors: The Ben Moide Story.\n\nDr Evans has assured, though, that all Press & Bookshop titles can be reprinted as Sterling Press in New Delhi and Masalai Press in California have electronic copies of all its titles.\n\nOther titles will have to be reordered and imported from all over the world. However, the loss of original books is lamentable and the way in which they were lost should be condemned.\n\nOver the years, many international and national academics and others have commended Dr Evans and his staff for the improvements to the Book Nook.\n\nLast year, a former professor at ANUs College of Asia and Pacific commented:\n\n“I've been meaning since my last visit in 2014 to write to congratulate you and the staff on the UPNG bookshop, which has improved so much in your time there.\n\n“As you said on the national book day, bookshops are essential in PNG and the UPNG bookshop has developed well beyond its low point of only selling a few course readers.\n\n“The lowest ebb was when the shop was privatised and the valuable stock of real treasures virtually given away. Now there is a wide range of course-oriented books, others in wider topics, and the incredibly valuable recycling of books from earlier decades.\n\n“Very few books are written about PNG these days, and serious students (and academics) need to get hold of what they can, especially since the Somare Library at UPNG is so run down. The essential materials for PNG studies are simply not available on-line.\n\n“And then there's the involvement with in-country publishing, which is essential for any academic community and helps local academics get recognition. I have travelled widely in PNG and there is no serious book seller in PNG, and no private business would provide the essential service your team provide.”\n\nA Fellow at the State, Society and Governance Program at ANUs College of Asia and Pacific made this comment also in 2015:\n\n“As a regular UPNG bookshop customer from 1981, and a former UPNG staff member (till 1996), I recently visited the bookshop for the first time in about five years.\n\n“I was deeply impressed five years ago at the remarkable ‘rebirth’, development and expansion of the bookshop. But in those five years, the improvement and expansion of the bookshop has only continued and improved. And this at a time when all the other serious bookshops that once used to operate in PNG have all but ceased to exist.\n\n“I was particularly struck by three main things about the bookshop. The first concerned the material available in relation to the disciplines taught at UPNG. Even at its best in the early 1980s, the bookshop tended to have mainly a few standard texts available in relation to each discipline. Now, in addition to those, there is an eclectic range of material into which students – and staff – can dip. This is an unparalleled resource, and one that is particularly valuable when the Michael Somare Library’s ability to renew and expand its resources is so constrained.\n\n“Second, in relation to PNG and the wider Pacific, the stock available in the bookshop is remarkable. It far exceeds the range available in any bookshop I know in Australia (and as an avid reader and sometime collector of such volumes, I am regularly surveying what is available in Australia (as well as other countries, where, again, there is nothing comparable that I am aware of).\n\n“To have this array of material available in PNG is an astounding achievement, and not one that was ever even attempted when the bookshop was at its best in the 1980s. Further, I know of no university bookshop in Australia that has the range of books I found in the UPNG Bookshop the week before last.\n\n“The third thing was that the staff of the bookshop were very knowledgeable, helpful and efficient. They helped me locate the many things I was interested to look at, and advised me with interest and enthusiasm. To build the teamwork and effectiveness of the staff must have taken years of enthusiastic attention from management. This alone is an unusual and invaluable resource, and one that really should be recognised, encouraged and protected by the university.\n\n“I have no doubt, however, that UPNG academic management recognise that fact, for it is to be congratulated on foresight it has clearly exhibited in supporting the development and operation of such an amazing bookshop. No doubt UPNG academic management support for the bookshop has enabled it to be developed by Bookshop management to a point of extraordinary achievements. The contribution that the resource this Bookshop is making to scholarship and to education is, in my considered view, incalculable.”\n\nThe Book Nook has been another unnecessary casualty in the ongoing battle to save our democracy from becoming a demo-crazy!\n\nGregory Bablis is a master’s degree student in the College of Asia Pacific at the ANU and vice president of the PNG Canberra Students Association."
