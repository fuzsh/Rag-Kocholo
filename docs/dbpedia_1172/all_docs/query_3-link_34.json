Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies shorts.[1] Three cartoons focus on the dog and kitten pair: Feed the Kitty (1952), Kiss Me Cat (1953) and Cat Feud (1958).[2] They also appear in one Claude Cat cartoon, Feline Frame-Up (1954).[3]\n\nDescription\n\n[edit]\n\nMarc Antony is a burly bulldog that is usually brown with a tan belly and black ears, though his coloration varies in some shorts. He bears a close resemblance to Hector the Bulldog, but with thinner back legs and minus the outer fangs. Pussyfoot/Cleo, in contrast, is a petite and extremely cute, blue-eyed black-and-white tuxedo cat to whom Marc Antony is utterly devoted with motherly passion. The characters seem to be named as an allusion to Mark Antony and Cleopatra, who were lovers detailed in Plutarch's Parallel Lives. Chuck Jones, the creator, has discussed the efforts to maximize the kitten's sheer adorableness. All head and eyes, she is black with a white face and belly and a white tip on her fluffy tail.\n\nInfluence\n\n[edit]\n\nPussyfoot has appeared in some Warner Bros. merchandising and the pair have been featured in various Warner Bros. productions, such as the third segment of Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983) and a Looney Tunes comic book story called \"Bringing Up Baby\" that was published in 1999. Tiny Toon Adventures featured a similar character named Barky Marky, who was a comparatively minor character on the show. The pair were also an inspiration for the characters Buttons and Mindy that were featured in the successor to Tiny Toon Adventures, Animaniacs. In the Buttons and Mindy short \"Cat on a Hot Steel Beam\", the cat that Mindy follows throughout the cartoon is Pussyfoot. Additionally, the kitten makes a very brief cameo appearance in the Chuck Jones short Another Froggy Evening (1995).\n\nJones would later revisit the idea of a cute kitten having an unlikely protector in the MGM Tom and Jerry short The Unshrinkable Jerry Mouse (1964), with Jerry becoming a kitten's friend and protector against a selfish and jealous Tom (the plot of which was borrowed from Feline Frame-Up (1954)). In Feline Frame-Up, Claude Cat attempts to convince their human owner that Marc Antony wants to harm Pussyfoot.\n\nA segment of Feed the Kitty in which an apparently \"inconsolable\" Marc Antony believes that Pussyfoot has been turned into a cookie (and unaware that the kitten is actually perfectly safe), was the subject of a homage in the 2001 Pixar film Monsters, Inc. in which Sulley believes that a little human girl he is protecting has fallen into a trash compactor, and reenacts the scene with Marc Antony nearly shot-for-shot.[4]\n\nA reference is also made to Feed the Kitty in the South Park episode \"Mysterion Rises\" with Eric Cartman acting as Pussyfoot and Cthulhu as Marc Antony in his \"cute kitten\" routine.\n\nIn Archer, the relationship between Archer and his daughter A.J. was inspired by their cartoons according to series creator Adam Reed.[5]\n\nFeed the Kitty is available on DVD, appearing on the compilations Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 1, disc 3 and Looney Tunes Spotlight Collection, and on Blu-ray, on Looney Tunes Platinum Collection: Volume 1.\n\nAlternate names\n\n[edit]\n\nMarc Antony is referred to as \"Marc Anthony\" on his food dish in Feed the Kitty and therefore his name should be spelled \"Marc Anthony\" throughout this article. Pussyfoot is sometimes called \"Kitty\" or \"Cleo\" in some WB animation history books. She was later renamed \"Pouncy\" for her appearances in Bugs Bunny Builders.\n\nAppearances\n\n[edit]\n\nClassic shorts\n\n[edit]\n\nCheese Chasers (1951, Marc Antony only, unnamed)\n\nFeed the Kitty (1952)\n\nKiss Me Cat (1953)\n\nFeline Frame-Up (1954)\n\nCat Feud (1958)\n\nMarc Antony also makes a cameo appearance in No Barking (1954), and Pussyfoot makes one in Another Froggy Evening (1995).\n\nOther media\n\n[edit]\n\nFilms\n\nWho Framed Roger Rabbit (Marc Antony cameo only, colored gray)\n\nSpace Jam (as two of the background characters)\n\nLooney Tunes: Back in Action (cameos at the end)\n\nTweety's High-Flying Adventure (Pussyfoot only)\n\nTelevision series\n\nAnimaniacs (Pussyfoot only in \"Cat on a Hot Steel Beam\")\n\nToon Marooned (Marc Antony cameo at \"Fowl By Comin' Round the Mountain\")\n\nParallel Porked (Marc Antony cameo)\n\nBaby Looney Tunes (Marc Anthony cameo as a puppy in the song “Paws and Feathers”)\n\nNew Looney Tunes\n\nLooney Tunes Cartoons (starring in \"Boarding Games\"; cameo at \"Happy Birthday Bugs Bunny!\")\n\nBugs Bunny Builders (Pussyfoot only, renamed as \"Pouncy\")\n\nVideo games\n\nThe Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle 2\n\nBugs Bunny Crazy Castle 3\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
