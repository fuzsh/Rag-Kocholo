        "text": "The KHAD (Khasi Social Custom of Lineage) (Second Amendment) Bill, 2018 was destined and designed to fail and it was not a surprise to see that it did when it was rejected by the Governor and sent back. It was rife with inconsistencies which now the leaders of Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council claim that it will look to correct. It is a little too late for that now.\n\nThere are two arguments against the bill which were put forward by those that oppose the bill: it was anti-woman and undemocratic because it was passed without taking important stakeholders like the various clans that make up the Khasi community into consideration. There was a tentative acceptance from some of those who oppose the bill that certain problems like non-tribal men marrying Khasi woman for material benefits may exist. I believe that in some cases that might be true, more in exception than in rule. But there are certain things that have to be understood when such an argument is made. There is the concept of ‘gold diggers’ – people who marry other people for wealth rather than affection. So the question becomes can Khasi men also not be ‘gold diggers’? I for sure know some Khasi men who can be categorised as such. This is therefore not a unique of a situation.\n\nSo is the transfer of land and wealth to non-local through matrimony a problem? This again is not that simple. Land Transfer Act does not allow non-tribals, in fact, other tribals other than indigenous to Meghalaya from buying property in the State. So when confronted with the legal impossibility of such a transfer, the supporters of the Amendment argue about indirect control, i.e., Benami. But then is there not a law for that as well? If that is the case why bring a new law when there are already existing ones that need to be properly implemented, especially the second.\n\nIn light of these facts, The KHAD (Khasi Social Custom of Lineage) (Second Amendment) Bill, 2018 was nothing but a stunt for next year’s MDC/MP election. There is though another problem with the Bill. It is anti-jaidbynriew (to borrow the term from the local Right) and will weaken the community at a time when the danger from outside forces (political dispensation, economic system, ecological uncertainty) is going to become more severe.\n\nThe thrust of the Bill was to ensure that there is purity of race (a discarded concept) by forbidding marriages outside the community. But by leaving out Khasi men marrying non-Khasi women the cat got out of the bag. Racial purity (supposed) is going to be disturbed if any foreign element is brought in. It doesn’t matter whether it’s from the men’s side or the women’s. The answer to this dilemma was given by one of the panellists in one of the TV debate held on the issue. “The problem doesn’t arise because the seed comes from the man” argued by one who was in support of the bill. Not surprisingly it was a man who said it. I was wondering if that was true why doesn’t he trying mixing his seed with the seed of another male panellist sitting beside him and see if it germinates. If it does I will agree to whatever arguments are made in favour of the Bill. On a serious note though, this idea of racial purity is especially not applicable to the Khasis because the sub-groups within them have acknowledged the history of admixture. One of such groups is the Bhoi.\n\n“A Bhoi is someone who takes the mother’s surname while a Karbi is someone who takes the father’s surname” – an elderly Karbi lady from one of the villages in Ri Bhoi tells me. This particular Karbi lady married a Khasi man and her children now have a Khasi surname. Though she still has a Karbi surname she hardly communicates in Karbi anymore. With the Karbi people from other villages also she converses in Bhoi (a dialect different than the Sohra dialect which the official dialect of the Khasi community) and she is not the only one. What is important to notice is that it is not language but lineage which according to her distinguishes a Bhoi from a Karbi. This could be because of the stark difference between the Karbi and Khasi based on lineage rules. However, in case both groups had followed the same system this distinction will not work. This situation is further complicated because some ‘Khasi’ customs are not followed by the Bhoi, like the tang-jait.\n\nIn the Bhoi region, there is a type of matrimonial alliance which is known as shim-bhoi. In case a family has only male children, in order to keep the property within the same clan brides are sought from the Karbi clans (who follow the patrilineal system) rather than the matrilineal Bhoi clans. The children get the father’s surname and if they in turn have female children of their own the matrilineal system is adopted. This is different from the upland Khynriem (a Khasi sub group like the Bhoi) custom of tang-jait where the children of a union between a Khasi man and a non-Khasi woman will get a new Khasi surname. This comparison illustrates the comparatively greater flexibility in the Bhoi region where the presence of a patrilineal system is used as a medium through which a particular clan continues to maintain control over the ancestral property. What is also noticeable is also how the term Bhoi is used to designate the members of Karbi population who follow a patrilineal system rather than the matrilineal system of the Khasis. The headman of the Karbi lady’s village stated that “the Bhoi actually are the Karbis who actually were called Bhoi by the other Khasi sub-tribes”. This is something which has been alluded to by the British when they first arrived in this region: “The people are known as Bhois in these hills, who are many of them really Mikirs (another name for Karbi), live in the low hills to the north and north-east of the district (United Khasi and Jaintia Hills), the term “Bhoi” being a territorial name rather than tribal” (PR Gurdon, 1914).\n\nThe equivalence of surname is another phenomenon which is present in the Bhoi region (Ramirez, 2014). Members from the different ethnic communities which are residing in the area are found to be sharing membership in more than one ethnic group. A surname among the Bhoi-Khasi is found to have an equivalent among the Karbi and the Tiwa another important ethnic group (see table). This performs two functions, viz., new members into a group can only be admitted into the clans that already have established inter-ethnic affiliations; and consequently, marriages also have the follow the same route, i.e., following the rules of endogamy marriages cannot take place within the equivalent clan across the ethnic categories. According to the Census records Karbis formed around 15% of the population in Ri Bhoi, but according to Karbi activists and commentators the number is much higher, more than 30% (Teron et al, 2008). The discrepancy could be due to the fact that the latter might have included all the surnames that have Karbi equivalence or its corruption as being part of the Karbi population, for example, Killing (Karbi) becoming Klein (Bhoi-Khasi). Done in this way the Karbi numbers will inevitably increase. However, such an approach is fraught with problems.\n\nTable Examples of equivalent surnames\n\nKarbi Tiwa Khasi/Khasi-Bhoi Ingti Mithi Muktieh Ronghang Malang Markhap Hanse Maslai Khymdeit Ronghang Malang Muker Be Kholar Lamare Ingleng Madar Syngkli Timung Puma Umbah Teron Amish Paraphang Teron Amsong Mynsong\n\nSource: Phillippe Ramirez (2014)\n\nThe stability of such a system of inter-ethnic commonality points to the fact that such a process has been a two-way traffic. The method of identifying the population of a group (Karbi) by also counting its surname equivalent in another group (Khasi) is based on the assumption of a flow towards only one direction, i.e. of the latter. However, as observed in a case where an entire village was converted from Garo to Karbi through a ceremony it is clear that this is not the case (Ramirez, 2014). The British administrations have also recorded cases of non-Karbis being assimilated in such a manner during 17th Century (Teron et al, 2008). Therefore the assumption of unilateral flow is not tenable. In case of mixed marriages, the problem becomes more complicated. For example, a child borne out of a marriage between a Bhoi (matrilineal) and a Karbi (patrilineal) can be claimed by both the ethnic groups. Therefore, the real numbers will vary depending on who is counting them. In an environment where demand for ethnic homelands is quite endemic amongst the various groups in the region, inflating numbers can be a very useful strategy. This allows a group to lay claim on additional territories as well. Of course this does not go uncontested.\n\nFrom the Karbi side the argument can be made that in a Khasi dominated landscape the trend is primarily assimilation towards the latter rather than the former. The Bhoi region had been under the influence of Jaintia (Pnar – another Khasi sub-group) kingdom and the Nongkrem (Khynriem) Syiemship in the past and is presently a district on the Khasi-dominated part of Meghalaya. For socio-political reasons it would make more sense for the Karbis to assimilate within the Khasi rather than the other way around. However, this is not assimilation where the minority community’s identity gets completely lost within the dominant community. Here vestiges of the previous identity are still intact and in fact it is these connections that guide the process. This allows the incoming group to still maintain connection with the group they left. It is these connections that allow some of them to try and regain the previous identity. There are cases of people who having been born with a Khasi surname chose to leave it for a Kabri surname. The dominance of a community cannot be looked only from the macro scale of a district or a state but at the micro level of village as well. Also, individual decisions based on factors other than politics has to be considered.\n\nBhoi can be understood as both ‘border’ as well as ‘people of the border’ (Ramirez, 20147) and like all border areas shows a great deal of diversity in terms of ethnic and linguistic composition. This identity like Gurdon (1914) remarked could be more of a geographic nature than an ethnic category. The line of argument can be advanced regarding the identity of the different sub-tribes among the Khasis as well. The seven sub-tribes of the Khasis can be identified with specific geographic locations (see figure 1) which could be the initial criterion for differentiation. This later got ossified into a restrictive ethnic category where lineages became the defining criterion rather than location. However, many on the ground still cling to the original design. When asked about their ethnicity people (from different ethnic backgrounds) in the village identified themselves firstly as Bhoi and then on being further prodded as Bhoi-Khasi or Karbi. Coming to myself, my grandfather was a Pnar, my father is a Karbi and my mother is a War (another Khasi sub-group).\n\nThe Khasi community can be divided into seven sub-groups, viz., War, Jaintia/Pnar, Lyngngam, Maram, Diko, Khyriem and Bhoi. These groups can be identified with certain geographical locations (see figure). Collectively they are called as Khasi. However, this nomenclature is not accepted by others, especially the Jaintia who prefer to refer themselves as Jaintia or Pnar. Another term which has been attempted to identify the community is Hynniewtrep after the origin myth. So if the Bill is accepted it would mean you have to remove the Bhoi and the Lyngngam (who have been acknowledged as being a mixture of Khasi and Garo) out of this scheme for the simple reason that they are not pure. Not just a single parent, both the parent were most probably non-Khasi. So there is no Hynniewtrep anymore and we have to find a new word to define the community which is acceptable to the remaining groups.\n\nThe more correct way of looking at the Khasi is that they are not a race but a people who follow different customs and traditions but have chosen to identify as Khasi based on similarities like the lineage system, language and other cultural markers. As more work is done on other groups especially the War (to which I belong) more diversities will be unearthed. The story of the Khasi is the story of different groups coming in the past and assimilating making the community making it richer in diversity and history. This does not mean there is nothing called the Khasi. When I cross into Ri Bhoi from Assam I know I am home among my people. When the time comes I will stand shoulder to shoulder with my brethrens to make sure that our homeland does not become another Tripura or Sikkim-Darjeeling. This land has been the abode of the Khasi for thousands of years and will continue to remain so in the future as well. But at the same time, the history of my community saves me from falling into the trap of prejudiced hate and unjustified animosity. This for me is the beauty of being a Khasi which no Bill will ever take it away.\n\nReferences\n\nPhilippe Ramirez (2014). People of the Margins: Across Ethnic boundaries in North-East India.

He grew up in his native village at Umthied Bynther in West Khasi Hills.\n\nAt the age of eight he started to mesmerize the village folks with the melodious sound of his duitara and his soul searching singing. In 1967-68 he was given an opportunity to sing in an All India Radio programme. After that Syiemlieh became a regular artiste in All India Radio Shillong and his songs were appreciated and loved by many.\n\nLiving the Memories\n\nIn numerous songs, Syiemlieh would begin by saying:\n\nHa sngap ho para ngan iathuh khana\n\nListen oh my brothers and sisters I will tell you a story\n\nIndeed his songs were stories told not only to entertain, but more importantly to teach and admonish. Like a story teller of old he would sing the stories. The duitara, the guitar and the violin were accompaniments that gripped his audience as he would retell stories about his own people, the Khasis, and in particular the rural folk.\n\nIn his songs he would retell the Khasis’ sacred tales (in the song Ki Khanatang), the story of Tirot Sing in prison (in the song Iing Byndi), the origin-myth of his own clan and the awe-inspiring story of the ancestral father of his clan, U Lohryndi, the tragic tale of U Manik Raitong, the story of Ka Suna. Creation and origin-myths of the Khasis, ancient sacred tales, history, tragic tales of fallible Khasi heroes and tragic romances of the Khasi folk form the subject of his art.\n\nFor Syiemlieh, story-telling and singing were one and the same. The accompanying musical instruments like the duitara (a four-stringed Khasi musical instrument), the guitar and the violin help to enhance the union between the stories and his music.\n\nThough his songs are tales of yore, Syiemlieh’s unique way of representing them reveal different perspectives of the same tales.\n\nIn the song ‘Iing Byndi’, the artiste does not sing about the battles and heroism of U Tirot Sing Syiemlieh. Rather, he chooses to sing about the anguish and bafflement in Tirot Sing’s own family after his arrest.\n\nIn another song called ‘U Lohryndi’, he tells us about U Lohryndi the Thawlang or the ancestral father of the Syiem Sutnga and Syiemlieh clan. While many have only sung about the Iawbei or ancestral mother of the clan, Ka Lidohkha, Skendrowell chooses to show us another perspective of the same folktale wherein we see Lohryndi as the protagonist of his song.\n\nHe does not only sing and retell the tales of his ancestors but also weaves his own story to teach us about the evil born out of envy, jealousy and betrayal. In the song ‘Ka Mahadei’, he tells his own story about how the Syiem (traditional Khasi chief) had asked his myntri (nobles) to fetch a poor woman for a wife, especially someone who is a khun khatduh of a poor family. The Syiem hopes to marry a humble and self-sacrificing woman who knows how to keep her house and serve him and her family too. There is one such woman but her elder sister is envious of her. She lies and gets married to the Syiem claiming that she is the khun khatduh who is taking care of her parents. The younger one has no idea about it. She marries a baker. But as justice would have it, the Mahadei (the Syiem’s wife) gives birth to abnormal children who do not live long. The Syiem understands that there is something the Mahadei is hiding from him. She confesses and the Syiem imprisons her. The Syiem then orders his nobles to fetch another wife for him. They come back with the Mahadei’s youngest sister whose husband, the baker, dies before fathering any children. They find her to be the best match for him.\n\nSkendrowell sings:\n\nKo jingpihuin ko jingbishni phin lah shan slem oh katno sngi?\n\nLa phi leh bein ha sla pyrthei ia rangli ki juki,\n\nKa jinglanot kan wan ha phi,\n\nKhatduh ym slem kan thad lyngkrang ia phi\n\nOh envy, oh jealousy! For how long would you last?\n\nYou may have ill treated the poor,\n\nbut suffering will come to you and in the end\n\nyou will be shamed and laid bare\n\nA unique way of starting some of his songs is that without singing and in the absence of music he would just tell a story to give a moral lesson. He would do this in many of his songs and then proceeds to sing when the music begins.\n\nRomanticism in his songs\n\nSyiemlieh’s songs were inspired by the beauty and serenity of nature in the rural areas. In one song after another he would sing about the four seasons (like in the song saw aiom ki por) and his village. The various elements of nature, animals and plants alike, serve to suggest the many facets of man’s existence and qualities of a person.\n\nIn the song ‘Ah Moina’ he sings:\n\nAh Moina! Ah Moina!\n\nBu chong cha ri bujngei\n\nOh Mynah! Oh Mynah!\n\nThat lives in a faraway land\n\nand in the song ‘U Sohkhia’ the image of the Mynah reappears. The bird Mynah or Moina is a recurrent image that symbolically suggests a love that is lost and has flown away. In innumerable songs of his, plants, especially flowers, like U Tiewlyngksiar, U Tiewlyngskaw, U Tiewdohmaw (all wild orchids) are nature’s symbolic suggestions of the innumerable manners and qualities of human beings.\n\nIn the song ‘Khublei Khublei’, Skendrowell sings about how he is regarded as an honourable and well-mannered gentleman in his village but when in town he is regarded as being ill-mannered and a rustic. The flowers U Tiewlyngksiar and U Tiewlyngskaw are used to describe this. He is U Tiewlyngksiar (an orchid symbolising an honourable gentleman) in his village but when in town he is forced to apologise to others since to the elite urban folk he is just U Tiewlyngskaw (a flower symbolising the rustic). In the midst of this drama he mentions how U Tiewdohmaw (a flower symbolising a wise person) would listen to the songs sung by U Tiewlyngksiar who is but U Tiewlyngskaw to the urban elite.\n\nThe rural landscape inspired and fuelled up his singing prowess. In ‘Ah Moina’, Skendrowell sings of a life led in the soothing embrace of nature, a life filled with the simple joys felt when catching a bird or a mountain rat, when ploughing the field, when playing the duitara and when eating u sohphlang.\n\nSinging in the Mawiang dialect (one of the many Khasi dialects spoken in West Khasi Hills), he begins the song with these words:\n\nChi bu duk bu toi\n\nSet synduk ia ka loi loi\n\nWe who are poor,\n\nwe lock up the nothing we have in a box.\n\nThe empty box is symbolical of poverty as well as the meaninglessness of material possessions. This box which is seemingly empty to the urban folk is in fact a treasure box containing the most precious experiences of rural life. For him these rural experiences must be carefully locked up in a box, a box that the urban rich sees as having nothing or “loi loi”. This is a proof of his unwavering belief in the serenity and freedom of rural life. This serenity and freedom helped him sing even in the midst of poverty.\n\nIn the midst of a difficult village life, his songs still talk about ka Tip Kur Tip Kha, ka Tip Briew Tip Blei, and ka Kamai ia ka Hok (To know one’s maternal and paternal relations — the sacred principle that defines family relations; to know man and know God — the sacrosanct value that defines human relations and our relationship with God; to earn righteousness — the ideal and belief that one must work one’s righteousness out).\n\nThese are the Khasi ideals, ethics that have been engendered in him since childhood as he would sit around the hearth with his village folks and family members. His love for the rural and the natural, however, is unlike Wordsworth’s pantheistic ideology, unlike Keats’ worship of beauty and it indicates nothing of Shelley’s escapist desire. But like a true son of his village and like an integral part of the rural folk he sang his songs. A villager singing his songs.\n\nHis songs are a magical description of the intoxicating, inspirational and soul-soothing rural life of which he has been part of. He has not waited for a Wordsworth to describe his life. Skendrowell’s songs are not poems about a ‘Yarrow Unvisited’ (a poem of Wordsworth) but he is part of his own Yarrow meaning the Khasi rural landscape.\n\nSinging his own songs\n\nSkendrowell was a folk member singing his own songs. His love for his village is mirrored in his song ‘Shnong ba nga ieij’ (The village I love). He ends the song by submitting himself to the call of nature. If W.B. Yeats could not help but arise and go to Innisfree where he hoped to find peace and a quiet life, Skendrowell gave in to the call of his hut in the village, a call that Mother Nature (ka Mei Mariang) commissioned (Ban khot noh ia nga, Ba phah ka Mei Mariang).\n\nLike a true Khasi, he sees nature as a Mother (Mei meaning mother – Mei Mariang or Mother Nature).\n\nHis songs, however, are not descriptions of a utopian Khasi world. He was not blind to the loss of values among Khasis and with an honest eye he saw the moral decadence in his own society. In the song ‘Akor Khasi’, he mourns the loss of good Khasi manners and values. “Akor Khasi pat la ha niamra (good Khasi manners and values are now in dark caves).\n\nRaising questions\n\nHis songs were not just meant to entertain and tell stories but also to teach and reflect on human nature.\n\nHis search for meaning in life starts with questions that dig deep into the deepest pits and chaotic labyrinths of human nature. Questions abound aplenty in many of his songs. Balei? or why?, he would question. In the song ‘Balei jinglong briew?’ or ‘Why is human nature such?’, Skendrowell sings:\n\nBalei jinglong briew kum ka sla halor um kaba shu per?\n\nWhy is human nature like a leaf that floats on the water surface?\n\nThis suggests his understanding that humans are simply drifters and wavering like leaves on the water surface.\n\nIn the same song he continues to sing:\n\nBalei jinglong briew ka shu lum Dorbar khlem nongbishar?\n\nWhy do humans gather a Dorbar when there’s no proper judge or righteousness?\n\nThis suggests corrupt practices in the traditional Khasi Dorbar.\n\nBalei jinglong briew ba shu kwah ban her sha ka ri ki khlem kam tang shyntur suda?\n\nWhy do humans want to escape to a land where people don’t work but only talk?\n\nThis suggests tall talks but no action taken.\n\nBalei jinglong briew ba shu kwah ban her shaba sting u ba met ba khia u stait?\n\nWhy do humans want to escape to where the edible part of the rice-grain is light and the husk is heavy?\n\nThe part of the rice grain that is edible should have been described as being heavy since we toil and labour for our food. But Skendrowell turns this upside down. The edible portion is light but the husk which is unnecessary is heavy. This suggests a chaotic and absurd world where there is a total inversion of values as opposed to the world of his village where the simple joys of life in the midst of nature is soul-soothing and where everything is in order.\n\nHowever, like Pablo Neruda in his collection, ‘The Book of questions’, Skendrowell does not provide solutions to the human predicament. He sees his own people as being caught in a dilemma (Ka Dum Dngiem) and he firmly believes that it is but the greed of man and the loss of the old Khasi value of ‘Ka Kamai ia ka Hok’ that the Khasi world is now absurdly chaotic and seemingly irredeemable.\n\nSubaltern art of a Nongkyndong\n\nBah Skendrowell Syiemlieh’s inability to sing in English made him a not-so-sought-after singer by the urban elite. However, he has remained “the singing story teller” for many in the villages and small Khasi towns that till date are considered ‘Nongkyndong’ (a derogatory term used by the urban elite to paint the village folks as village idiots).\n\nEven the posthumous Padma Shri in 2008 did not help to raise his image among the Khasi urban elite. His songs have remained the subaltern art of a subaltern rural narrative. But despite this his courage to sing about himself as a son of the village bore him great success when without any inhibition he sang ‘Ah Moina’ in the Mawiang dialect.\n\nThe Mawiang dialect comes along with the rural, rustic life that he held dearly till his last days. Nobody ever imagined that a song sung in one of the West Khasi Hills dialects would ever be appreciated. Till date, ‘Ah Moina’ remains one of the most popular Khasi songs. He had brought fame not only to himself but to the whole of West Khasi Hills.\n\nSkendrowell is not a pure folk singer. Though much of his music is fusion music yet it enhances the folktales and it only helps our generation to automatically relate to the tales as many of us have been tuned to the sounds and beats of a western drum or guitar. Thus the duitara has found a new companion to help in the retelling of the tales to a new generation. He had found a way to connect our generation to our roots and folklore. With him the oral story-telling tradition becomes a singing tradition. The ancient folktales are given a new life and are now sung out to our generation and much of what his forefathers have told him are now immortalised in his songs.\n\nThe old has given way to the new but the folktales of ancient times is part of our cultural memory and his songs too have contributed much to the retelling of these ancient Khasi tales. In immortalising these tales in songs he has immortalised himself. Thanks to Skendrowell Syiemlieh many of the Khasi folktales have now become flesh and blood in songs. Let us all tell our own stories in songs and maybe we too will live forever.\n\nThe post The Songs of Bah Skendrowell Syiemlieh appeared first on RAIOT.\n\nOne of the first ethnographic accounts of Ka Shad and Pomblang of Hima Khyrim was by Fr. Christoph E Becker SDS who served as the Apostolic Prefect of the Catholic Mission of German Salvatorian missionaries in Assam. Published in German in Anthropos, Vol. IV (1909), 892-902, it was a description of the rituals held in 1906. Illustrated by photographs by Fr. P. Frumenus Stegmüller, SDS, the account surprisingly (mostly) stayed clear of missionary clichés. While publishing this translation by Elizabeth Knight, we have let all the spellings, notes and photographic numbering intact.\n\nTHE NONGKREM PUJA IN THE KHASI HILLS(ASSAM) / DIE NONGKREM-PUJA IN DEN KHASI-BERGEN (ASSAM)\n\nAbout five English miles to the east of Shillong, the chief town of the Khasi Mountains, lies the town of Nongkrem. It is the seat of the king (u S’iem) who governs the state Nongkrem of Khyrim, the largest of the 25 Khasi little states and which is partly independent (semi-independent) of the English government. Nongkrem is best known for the great sacrifice, simply called Nongkrem Puja or also ka Pom blang-u-S’iem Nongkrem (Slaying the goat of the S’iem of Nongkrem) which takes place there annually. This festivity offers, as little else does, an instructive insight into the religious and social views and customs of this interesting mountain people and should therefore be given a concise description, which may be divided into three parts:\n\nThe Preparations for the Sacrificial Feast.\n\nThe Sacrificial Feast.\n\nThe Celebration that Follows.\n\nThe Preparations for the Sacrificial Feast\n\nJust as matriarchy prevails in the family among the Khasi so a similar arrangement has been kept in the management of the Khasi state, Nongkrem. In the state the S’iem is not the actual head but a high priestess, called ka S’iem sad. Sad means the divinity which watches over the royal races. The temporal government is transferred by the S’iem sad to the S’iem: he acts as her authorized agent although independent in his decisions, working with his advisers, whose advice he must obtain in matters of importance. The moneys of the kingdom are kept by the S’iem sad. Everything that comes in, such as taxes, market contributions, or that which comes in through the administration of justice must be given to her. She may dispose of it as she sees best, while the S’iem receives from her the money necessary for paying the costs of the government.\n\nThe S’iem sad is the sole authority in matters of religion. She must watch over the religious sacrifices and determine the time and place for them; the state sacrifices are held in her house or in front of her house, and they must be performed in her presence. The actual S’iem is her son or nephew or even more distant male relative, who is chosen by the “state council,” the Mentris.\n\nAfter the death of the S’iem sad, this office passes to her oldest living daughter, and lacking such to the eldest daughter of her eldest daughter, and lacking such granddaughters to the oldest daughter, and so forth. In case there are no daughters or granddaughters, the oldest living sister takes the office; if there are no sisters, then the oldest daughter of the oldest sister of the mother of the deceased S’iem sad is the successor, and so it goes further. In this way the office always remains within the royal lineage.\n\nIn the house of the S’iem sad (called ka-iing sad), which is one of the largest and most attractive in the Khasi Hills, there is a post in the middle which reaches from the floor to the ridge of the roof. It is called u rishot Blei (post, pillar of god) and serves at the same time as the altar before which many sacrifices are performed. The pillar is nothing other than the trunk of the Khasi oak (ka dieng sning; botanical name: castanopsis sp.), which is holy to the Khasi. If the house of the S’iem sad burns down, or if it is built up anew, a new pillar must be brought. Only certain families (jaid) have the privilege of cutting down the trees for this purpose. As soon as it is cut down, dancing and music begins; the trunk is covered with a cloth and carried away on a carrying frame. Hundreds of persons participate in this. As long as the pillar is not set up, it is guarded night and day. If a person or an animal might jump over it and that would be sang (= taboo): the trunk would be defiled and another tree would have to be cut down. If something dreadful happens in the kingdom, or if a danger threatens, the S’iem sad goes with six official sacrificial priests of the kingdom Nongkrem before the post and offers sacrifice there in order to avert the evil.\n\nThe foregoing had to be mentioned in order to give a better understanding of the following.\n\nThe Nongkrem Puja usually takes place in the month of May. One month before the celebration rice liquor is poured into a hollowed out gourd bottle in the house of the S’iem sad and offered before the rishot Blei as a ‘suit’ (sacrifice of drink). This is done in order to inform the u Suidnia long S’iem (the spirit of the first great-uncle on the maternal side who was the first king), the ka Blei long S’iem (the divinity who makes kings kings) and the u Blei Shillong (the god Shillong), that preparations are now being made for the Puja and that they might help with them.\n\nThe u Blei Shillong plays the chief part in the whole ceremony. He enjoys great reverence among the Khasi, especially in the kingdom Nongkrem and Mylliem. Not far from Nongkrem a mountain peak rises 6,450 feet above the sea. It is the highest peak in the Khasi Mountains; its name is “Shillong Peak.” Here is the seat of the god Shillong. The story goes that a man appeared here once, who said he 894 had not been born but came of himself (shu long). He also told the people that they would receive the kings, S’iem. So the god who lives here was called u Shu long (he who is out of himself), from which the Europeans gradually made the word Shillong and also gave this name to the splendid mountain station in the heart of the Khasi Mountains.\n\nAfter the S’iem sad has determined exactly the day of the ceremonies, the news of this is sent out two weeks prior to the ceremony to the village elders (Rangbah shnong). This is done on the day of the large market (jew duh), which takes place every eighth day. Two weeks after is the pom blang, also on the day of the large market, which is discussed below.\n\nThe way in which the invitation is issued is interesting. A number of chains are made of bamboo rings. These are called kyrwoh. One of these is sent to the oldest man of each village. Since the Khasi formerly had no script, this bamboo chain always served as a sign of invitation or summons to the S’iem for ceremonies, or of danger of war, or of court matters and such. The degree of urgency was shown by the form of the links; in the case of great haste the form was longish and flat, otherwise correspondingly rounder. The sending of the kyrwoh to the village elders serves now as a sign of invitation for the whole village to appear at the ceremonies and at the same time as a demand to gather together the prescribed sacrificial gifts. Each of the six districts, into which the kingdom Nongkrem is divided, must furnish a goat; each individual hut must pay a tax (called pynshok) of one rupee and four anna as in addition. Very poor people only have to pay one anna or even only a half. The sacrificial gifts, such as rice, various sacrificial animals, fish, brandy and such are bought with these contributions; the balance, as with other money, is handed over to the S’iem sad for management.\n\nUntil the approach of the actual festival, the fish sacrifice (suit-dohkha) takes places on the day called jeu pomthiah, on which all who appear are fed with dried fish and brandy. This is supposed to be a further announcement to the u Blei Shillong, u Suidnia long Siem and ka Blei long S’iem of the imminent Puja. Twelve different kinds of drums (ksing) are beaten.\n\nThen the drum, ksing shad tyngkoh, is beaten three times, and the first sacrificial priest (Soh Blei) and a flute player dance. The dance, tyngkoh, will be described in more detail below. After it is finished, the ksing kynthei (women drums) have a turn, to the sound of which the S’iem and the flute player (duhalia) dance three times. Usually only women dance to this drum. About the method of dancing it is sufficient to remark that in a Khasi dance the dancing persons do not touch each other, and each carries out the motions independent of the others. After the women drums are beaten, then the sword dance drum (ksing mastieh) and the large drum (nakra) are beaten. Torches are carried around and shouts of joy uttered nine times. Various drums, flute music, and clashes of cymbals follow, while dancing takes place. At the end the S’iem dances alone, while the drums and flutes are not silent the whole night through. Fig. 2 shows several Khasi drums, a flute, and cymbals which are never missing from a dance.\n\nThe day of the large market, on which the actual ceremony begins, approaches meanwhile. On the day before — ka sngi umni— the roads are swept and the place for the sacrifice of the goat put in order. As a sign of joy as to what will happen, drums are beaten again and flutes (tangmuri) played. In front of the house of the S’iem sad, the S’iem and other men perform a sword dance. Although interesting, this dance is not very artistic. Hopping and skipping from one foot to the other, the men, one behind the other, move slowly in a circle on the open place. (cf. Fig. 6). They hold a bunch of goat hair in one hand and a sword in the other. A shout of joy is uttered from time to time, then they stop again, jump at each other two by two, and hit each other with quick blows of their swords. Each one quickly draws back again and moves in a circle again as before. In this way the dance continues.\n\nAfter it has become dark a hen is sacrificed in front of the house of the S’iem sad: to the ka S’iem synshar (the queen who rules the world) and to the Biskurom, the god who instructs in the playing of flutes and other instruments. Then various drums are beaten.\n\nThen everyone goes inside the iing sad. The S’iem sad hands the Soh Blei, the first sacrificial priest, who is from the family (jaid) Rumnong, a hollowed-out gourd bottle (u skaw) with rice liquor. The Soh Blei pours out the contents in front of the rishot Blei in honor of the goddess of the markets (ka Blei ieu lei hat) so that the markets will be good, remunerative, and successful; so that the roads will be good and safe and everything will be blessed; so that the kingdom itself will progress and develop. It must be remembered here that the market system is very marked among the Khasi and is the chief source of their income. After this ‘suit’ the same sacrificial drink is offered to the Ka Blei long S’iem, in order to receive her blessings, so that the kings will be good and may make progress. Music and dancing then lasts until daybreak.\n\nThe Sacrificial Feast\n\nThe actual ceremony begins on the day of the large market. This day itself is called pom blang (goat heads). The S’iem sad may not eat rice for three days, only a kind of bread, which is made from rice flour. On the large open place in front of the iing sad the men hold their sword dance (shad wait) and guns are shot off until the S’iem sad, the S’iem and the Rangbah (elders) come out of the iing sad. Following the S’iem sad, is her slave-girl (mrau), who carries the utensils and sacrificial gifts. These are arranged by the S’iem sad herself and consist of a banana leaf, of which however only the upper part is taken (ka sla kait), five betel nut leaves (tympew), five portions of betel nuts, as much as is usually put in the mouth at one time (kwai), a kind of bread made of rice flour (kpu), for which the rice is first put in water, then taken out, dried, and pounded into flour; then rynsi bread, which is also baked with pounded rice or corn, mixed with sugar and rolled into the shape of bullets; some uncooked, shelled rice (u khaw), a gourd bottle with rice liquor (u klong) and several leaves of the Khasi oak tree. The following utensils are used: a golden or silver water container (u luta), a silver dishlike plate (ka pliang rupa). All these are now given by the S’iem sad to the Soh Blei and in addition a rooster and a white he-goat are brought to the place of sacrifice.\n\nThe spectators now go to the side, the S’iem and the Rangbahs come down to the place of sacrifice, while the Soh Blei receives the utensils and the sacrificial gifts and spreads them out in order on the ground. Then he takes the rooster in both hands and calls on the god Shillong with these words; “O god Shillong, thou who hast been seated since time immemorial! (ko Blei Shillong kumba la buh u long shwa!)” With a deep bow he then offers the sacrifice five times. Rooster and goat are sprinkled with water, rice, and the flour from kpu and rynsi, and are then beheaded. Then the examination of the entrails (dykhot) takes place in order to see if the sacrifice was acceptable. The way of doing that will be given below.\n\nFig 5: Khasi Men Dancers in front of iing sadAfter the end of the sacrifice the Soh Blei and a flute player lead the sword dance; after them the S’iem and the other dancers follow in turn. Various drums are beaten alternately and flutes are played through the whole night. When night falls the goats of the S’iem and those of the various districts of the kingdom of Nongkrem are brought for the sacrifice of the next day.\n\nThe day following the great market is called ka sngi Lyngka. It is the center point and climax of the whole ceremony. From early in the morning the crowds pour in from all sides of the Khasi Mountains.\n\nEarly in the morning an unmarried girl of the royal lineage (ka S’iem ba dang khynraw) dances in the house of the S’iem sad before the rishot Blei. Usually a granddaughter or nearer relative of the S’iem sad is chosen for this. Two men then take the girl in their arms and carry her with a rocking motion to the large open place in front of iing sad.\n\nThen the great folk dance begins. In the middle of the place musicians squat on the ground and play the drums and flutes, and strike the cymbals. The music is quite without art, only a repetition of the same monotonous tones.\n\nThe women dancers move in a rather narrow circle around the musicians. Only the unmarried girls dance. The clothes they wear for it are very rich and frequently very valuable. Fine cloths, usually of red, yellow, or blue silk are draped over their bodies; the upper body and arms are covered by a satin jacket. Their hair is bound together in a bun behind their heads; a string hangs down from the bun which usually ends in three tassels.\n\nThe head is covered by a golden or silver crown of fine chased work, which is topped by a bunch of feathers or a bunch of artificial flowers. Around their necks they wear chains of gold or silver and several in various sizes made of real corals. Their ear lobes are decorated with heavy earrings; shoes and stockings are not worn. Around their arms and wrists are massive silver rings or hoops, the latter being quite wide and in the same shape as cuffs. Fig. 10 shows the ornaments in detail. The very grand women dancers usually have a servant carrying an opened umbrella behind them.\n\nThe Khasi dance does not have the exciting and lively motions that are characteristic of our dances. Each woman dancer with her arms hanging down at her sides and her eyes cast modestly to the ground could be considered a model of modesty. Each completes her motions alone and completely independent of the others. She continuously makes a circle around the musicians, moving sideways, forwards, or backwards. At the same time the feet are kept close together and are moved seemingly so little that the motion is scarcely visible. When a woman dancer is tired she withdraws in order to rest a bit, and then enters again into the rows of the other dancers.\n\nFigs. 8 and 9 illustrate the above description of the Khasi woman dancers. Fig. 8 shows the girls in the dance in front of iing sad, of which only the front part may be seen above in the picture on the right.\n\nAt a proper distance from the girls the men dance in a wider circle around the place. They also have special clothing. Over the usual white cloth that covers the lower part of the body they wear a shirt, and over it a silk coat embroidered with many colors without sleeves which ends in a long fringe. Cf. Fig. 9 for this. A tail or train of animal hair hangs down over the back. Costly coral chains decorate the breast. A bunch of artificial flowers (thuia) about 18 inches long or of black and white rooster feathers is placed in the silk turban, while the right hand holds a bunch of goat hair. The modern shoes and stockings which are now worn by many go very badly with the otherwise pretty costume.\n\nThe motions of the men are more lively than those of the dancing girls, but still quite relaxed. In a dawdling manner they hop from one leg to another in a childish way, without lifting their legs very much. In this way they move forward, describing a circle; at the same time they wave the bunch of hair around in the air. From time to time they stop and as a group make a bow towards the middle of the circle with a loud rejoicing shout of pleasure, while they swing the bunch of hair downwards at the same time (cf. Fig. 5).\n\nThus the dance continues for hours at a time amidst the noise of the music. Thousands of spectators who do not seem to get tired throng around the great place. In the afternoon, at about three o’clock 898 the dance, which plays a large part in all the religious festivities is ended.\n\nThen preparations are made for the large sacrifice. In front of the house of the S’iem sad several boards are placed in a row beside each other, and in front of them at certain intervals twelve little heaps of loam are made. Music now plays inside of iing sad. All the sacrificial gifts are given to the S’iem sad in front of the rishot Blei and then distributed to the sacrificers by her. These then go out of the hut to the place of the sacrifice. There are twelve of them, namely the six official sacrificial priests of the kingdom and several lyngdohs from the villages; the Soh Blei is at their head, wearing a special sacrificial coat (cf. Fig. 4), while the others wear everyday clothes. Each one carries a dish in his hand with some rice, pounded flour for kpu and rynsi, betel nuts and the pepper leaf that belongs with them, a small young hen, a water container, leaves of the Khasi oak tree, as well as a small gourd bottle with rice liquor. The dish and the water container of the sacrificial priests are of ornamented brass, those of the Soh Blei of silver — all clean and polished until gleaming.\n\nThe spectators are arranged to the right and the left of the sacrificers, so that there is a wide alleyway open through the middle of the place to the gate of the board fence which surrounds the place and the[unknown] iing s[unknown] ad. Several men are constantly busy keeping the crowd within these bounds. No one may come in through the gate during the whole ceremony, because the god enters here during the sacrifice-therefore the broad path must be left open. If anyone should chance to wish to come in through the gate during the performance of the sacrifice, he is driven back with loud shouts. If he dared to come in anyway, in earlier times he would have been a child of death; now the fear of the English government might protect him to a certain extent, although this could hardly be an absolute guaranty of his life because of the religious excitement of the people.\n\nThe twelve now squat down on the boards placed in front of iing sad, the Soh Blei in the middle. Behind them the S’iem sad sits alone on the steps which lead from iing sad to the place of the sacrifice. Somewhat further back sits the S’iem surrounded by his Mentris and relatives (cf. Fig 7). The Soh Blei sets the example in all that follows; the others watch him and copy him. While each of the sacrificers slaughters only a small hen or a goat, the Soh Blei has [Page 9] the right to kill two of them, since he sacrifices to the ka Blei long S’iem and to the u Blei Shillong at the same time.\n\nEach one places the little liquor bottle on the little pile of earth in front of him. This also represents the altar. Then they take pepper leaves and oak leaves and place them in a certain pattern beside and on top of each other; pieces of betel nuts are placed on them, and the whole is strewn with rice, kpu flour and rynsi flour, while short prayers are murmured (cf. Fig. 1). Then follows the sacrifice of the little hens. The sacrificers each take one between both hands, murmuring soft prayers, then 899 the head of the little animal is sprinkled with water and strewn with rice, kpu flour, and rynsi flour. Each one dips a kind of pocket knife in the water and then cuts through the throat of the chicken. The freshly flowing blood is allowed to drip on the altar — the little pile of earth with the bottle of liquor and the leaves. Then the entrails are taken out of the animals in order to see whether god is favorable to them or is angry with them because of the sins and wickedness of men. The sacrificers hold them up high with their right hands and look at them carefully. A joyful “u bha! (it is good)” escapes their lips and spreads through the circle of spectators.\n\nThis observing of entrails (dykhot) occurs at all the sacrifices. Although there are many kinds of such auguries, the following are more or less the usual ones. The gullet of chicken is about in the middle between the neck and the stomach and shaped like a fork. The right prong is called u Blei (god), the left one u briu (man). First the rectum is looked at to see if it is empty or shows any symptoms of sickness or spots; in these cases the hen is not suitable for sacrifice. But even when everything is faultless, better signs are wanted. The forking mentioned above is looked at and the sacrificer, holding the intestines in his hand, begins the ceremony with the question: “Nga kylli nga byrthen da ka shat ka khan, ieng rangbah u bri u, dem u Blei? (I ask and seek through the strewing and the oracle, does the man rise and god bow?)” With his other hand he throws a little rice on the forking of the gullet, and because of the convulsive twitching actually one part or the other does rise. If the “man” rises, it is a good sign since the opposite branching, the “god” then bows or stays still as a sign of agreement.\n\nIf the omens are unfavorable, then it must be determined by throwing /perhaps a misprint — Einwerfen instead of Eierwerfen – egg throwing: tr./, why the god is angry and which sacrifice would be pleasing to him. Then the sacrifice begins again until the omens reveal that the god is reconciled and propitiated.\n\nLet us return to our Nongkrem Puja. After the observing of the entrails of the hens is completed with good results, the main part of the ceremony begins. Goats are brought out of the inside of iing sad and one is placed behind each of the sacrificers. This moment is captured in Fig. 1. The hens that have already been sacrificed and the other sacrificial objects that have been mentioned can be seen lying in front of the Soh Blei and the other sacrificial priests on the ground. The Soh Blei now takes a long knife (ka wait) between both flat outstretched hands and squatting speaks a prayer with bowed head. Fig. 3 shows various kinds of such knives; the smaller folding ones are the ones mentioned above in describing the killing of the hens.\n\nMeanwhile a kind of looping plant is thrown around the neck of one of the goats; one the the people present pulls it into the middle of the place where it /facing p. 898. Fig. 8. Dance of the Khasi Girls in front of iing sad. Two photographs by P. Frum. Stegmiller, S.D.S. Fig. 9. Women Khasi Dancers. Two photographs by P. Frum. Stegmiller, S.D.S./ 900 is held fast by a rope. The Soh Blei gets up, walks up to the animal with the ka wait in his hand and waits for the instant when it holds still. With one blow the head lies on the ground. It is at once picked up and placed beside the gourd bottle standing on the little pile of earth. The twitching rump is dragged in front of iing sad. Thus it continues until five goats are beheaded.\n\nNow the S’iem comes down to the sacrificial place. He takes the slaughtering knife in his hand, squats down in the place of the head priest, and observes as the latter had done the same ceremonies. Then he gets up and strides into the middle of the place in full costume with raised head and a self-conscious dignity. A goat has already been lead out there. One blow and its head also rolls on the ground. He sacrifices the first goat to the divinity which made him king; afterwards the four others are sacrificed to the u Blei Shillong. A salvo of guns and a loud shout of joy accompanies each blow of the S’iem.\n\nThe slaughter is now continued by others in endless turns. Sixty, eighty and more goats must lose their lives. The poor victims are not always lucky enough to be killed with one blow. The animal might move at the last minute or an unskilled hand may lack a certain firmness. Then the goat is only lightly wounded and crying seeks to escape. The sacrificer throws the knife away in order to disappear hastily among the spectators; some pick up earth and throw it at him with reproachful cries, while others seize the poor animal, throw it on the ground and saw the head off with the knife. That is a horrible sight. It is considered an unfavorable sign when the goat is not [Page 11] beheaded with one blow. If it happens to one of the first twelve goats, the man concerned must inquire through new sacrifices why his sacrifice was not pleasing to god.\n\nThe observing of the entrails is only done with the twelve first goats decapitated by the S’iem and the sacrificial priests. As in the case of pigs, it is only observed whether the liver, lungs, spleen and gall bladder are healthy and without spots, in which case the sacrifice is a good one and pleasing to god; otherwise through egg throwing (Eierwerfen)and new sacrifices a more favorable result must be brought about.\n\nDuring the night a pig is sacrificed to the honor of the u Suidnia long S’iem and he is informed thereby that Puja has now taken place and that it will take place once annually to the honor of the u Blei Shillong so that the kings will be lucky and healthy, the markets will enjoy progress and good results, and the children of the kingdom will be happy. This closes with the address to the Suidnia long S’iem: “Bring it about that the augury turns out well, and if the god Shillong should still not be satisfied, then reveal it to us through the augury.”\n\nThe Soh Blei now takes a chicken in his hand, sprinkles it with water, rice, flour of kpu and rynsi and speaks: “Now thou art sprinkled in order to lose thy life by having thy neck cut so that I can see the good or the evil (La pynsum pynsleh ban duh ka mynsiem ban dykut u ryndang; ba ngan khmih ia ka bha ka sniw).” Then 901 the animal’s neck is cut, the blood, as mentioned above, is allowed to drip on the leaves and the gourd bottle, and the entrails are taken out. After the augury has turned out favorably, a white he-goat is brought in and the Soh Blei speaks: “O god Shillong, this prayer is for thee, this sacrifice of the goat, of the hen, of the kpu and rynsi, of the utensils of preparation are for thee which thou hast given the royal family so that once annually the Puja may be celebrated in thy name, so that we may live happily, be healthy and increase, so that kings will arise so that their honor and that of the kingdom will grow and increase and the children of the kingdom will spread out to increase thy name and thy honor. O god Shillong, when thou hast received the sacrifice, bring it about that the heart, the lungs, the spleen, the gall bladder and the other parts are good.”\n\nMeanwhile dancers are arranged on both sides; they swing the sword (ka wait) and the bunch (u symphiah) around in the air and utter shouts of joy. As mentioned above, the goat is now strewn three times with the various sacrificial gifts, and guns are shot off three times and shouts of joy uttered. Then the S’iem gets up, takes the ka wait in his hand and sits down on the place of sacrifice. He takes [Page 12] off his turban (ka jain spong) and thanks god three times in a quiet voice; then he hands over the ka wait to the Soh Blei who does the same and then gives the knife to the sacrificer from the jaid Nongkseh, this one hands it on to the one from the jaid Thangkieu, and this one finally gives it to the one from the jaid Niangnong. Only one from these three families may undertake the beheading. When this has taken place, the head is placed on the leaves in front of the gourd bottle, and the entrails are taken from the body in order to read the omens. If these come out right, the dance of joy is set in motion. All members of the kingdom are invited to the feast, which consists of rice, sacrificial meat, and rice liquor and which lasts until early in the morning.\n\nThe Celebration that Follows\n\nOn the evening of the following day — called mied Maulong — a special meeting of the council takes place, which is called Dorbar sla in order to announce that all the sacrifices are now past. The S’iem has mats spread out inside the house and in the front room for the people to sit on; he himself takes his place on a palong, a raised seat, in the front room. Goat meat and pork is distributed to all those present, while the person who is designated as the speaker in the Dorbar and the first of the flute players receive betel nuts. The S’iem sends to the village and has it announced three times that as long as the Dorbar lasts nobody may leave his hut.\n\nThen he takes his turban off, raises both hands and offers thanks in the name of the lord and creator (ha ka kyrteng u trai u nongthau), who made him king, gave him subjects as well as the districts of the kingdom, the markets and the roads leading thither and prays that he will ever give strength, growth and progress and prosperity to the fields. Then he cries out: “O god, lord and creator, give me, the S’iem, happiness and prosperity also, so that my thanks and submission to thee may become ever greater (Ah Blei, trai kynrad u nongthau u nongbuh to ai bha ai roi ia nga I S’iem ban nongkhrau ka nguh ka dem).” Then he steps back.\n\nThe one who has been made the speaker now follows from the jaid Rynjah. He thanks the S’iem three times and then says: “O lord, thou who hast created heaven and earth, thou hast seated the king that we may be children of his kingdom; thou hast given the sun and the moon for reckoning the year, so that we can have Puja once in every year, so that the king appears, the children of the valleys increase and thrive, the children of the Khasi 2 , the children of the Bhoi 3, the children of the War, so that the sacrificial gifts will increase before the face of thy altar (Ko trai ba thau ia ka bneng ka khyndew uba pynlong i S’iem i kynrad ba long ma ngi ki khun ki hajar kumba phi buh ka sngi ban khein ia u bnai, phi buh u bnai ban khein ka snem ban long ka puja shi sien shi snem ban im ban roi i S’iem ban roi ki khun dykhar, khun Bhoi, khun Bhoi, khun Khasi, khun War ban khrau u blang u bhet ha khmat ka duwan jong phi).”\n\nThen the drum of joy (ksing risa) is beaten and everybody is given rice liquor, as much as he wants. The S’iem and the S’iem sad eat of the inner parts of the entrails observed the day before. Music and dancing last the whole night long until early the next moming when the participants in the festival return again to their villages and their huts.\n\nThe post [1909] THE NONGKREM PUJA IN THE KHASI HILLS by Fr. C E Becker appeared first on RAIOT.\n\nIn a letter to the editor of The Shillong Times dated June 24, 2016, a member of the public addressed what he believed to be a nuisance caused by hawkers. While hawkers in Shillong have previously been associated with dirt and the defilement of public spaces, this particular piece does so by comparing hawkers to cow dung. The author wrote:\n\nCow dung is a valuable matter which a farmer would lovingly handle with his bare hands to fertilize. But the same matter would be menacing dirt if it happens to be in a Church yard’s lawn or in the school compound.\n\nTo begin with, the letter has a patronizing tone. The author suggests that, in the right “hands,” hawkers could be of use to society. However, since they occupy footpaths and streets, this occupation is tantamount to their defiling churches and schools. The presence of hawkers in Shillong is, in this author’s understanding, so profane that it inspires the same disgust that one would feel in getting a whiff of cow dung. The author goes on to say, in a later paragraph of the letter, that hawkers are greedy, ignorant and criminal.\n\nIn comparing the working-class community to cow dung, the author of the letter strips them of their humanity and, in its place, assigns them bestiality or even worse ―what bestial nature itself rejects. By comparing the hawkers to cow dung, the author implies that, unlike him, they lack culture and social etiquette; that they are to be treated no worse than excreta.\n\nAfter reading the letter, I thought, “These are not the women I know/knew.” As the great-granddaughter of a woman who sold moonshine and the granddaughter of a tea seller (both of whom belonged to the unorganized sector of the Shillong working-class community) I knew differently. The working-class women I knew possessed ethics, morals and they also possessed that most human of attributes, dreams. If mainstream society refused to see them for who and what they are, then I had to do something about it. I had to write. Hence, apart from the obvious sociological implications this essay is also intended to unravel the human attributes of the women whose identities are, more often than not, concealed and made politically “savvy” by their being working-class.\n\nOf Women, Dreams and Working-Class Things\n\nLet us begin in the summer of 1972 or even 1975. It does not matter. The officials at the Shillong Sports Association have no record of the occasion. But it is etched in the memory of the runner as a momentous occurrence. As she crossed the finish line, the referee pressed the button on the timer: 13.5 seconds. My mother had just won the 100 metre dash with a record as yet unbeaten in Shillong’s athletics history. It was a time when dreams were possible and my mother, Antina Warjri, wanted to run. Years later, as she slaved away in the offices of the Telecommunications Department―in 2000 re-christened the Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited―memories of her time on the track worked to shore up her lost pride. “Ask about the time I won third place at the National Games,” she hastily tells me. These are memories worth having, she implies, because they show her for who she is and what she could have been.\n\nAntina Warjri was born on February 13, 1954―at least according to official records. She remembers a (largely) happy childhood and recollects a desire to explore the world beyond Shillong. Athletics, she tells me, gave her the opportunity to visit places as far away as Delhi, a chance that few young women from her economic background got. Agra, Jaipur and Delhi were some of the places that my mother visited because of her participation and interest in athletics. I recall instances from my life where my mother was stopped in the middle of the street and congratulated for being the athlete that she was. It is an image, however, that did not correspond to the life she led behind the public eye. While in public, my mother was hailed as one of Shillong’s leading athletes, her main concern behind closed doors was to provide for the family―a concern that her engagement in sports did not ease, partly due to bureaucratic loopholes. In their lives as athletes, Antina Warjri and her sister Nah Santina Warjri were never given the sports scholarships that they had applied for and were eligible to receive. The need to provide for her family and systemic apathy put an end to my mother’s dream of becoming an athlete.\n\nAntina Warjri is one of many from among the working-class in Shillong who have had to endure loss because bureaucratic and economic circumstances deemed it unfavourable for them to pursue their desired professions. The story is a familiar one. Kong Synjup Warjri, her mother and my maternal grandmother, wanted to be a nurse. But again, economic hardship compelled her to be something else―a tea seller. The immediate necessity of earning a living led women like my maternal grandmother and my mother to forgo their dreams. At the heart of such decisions, however, is concern for the family.\n\n“We were poor. I needed to earn,” my mother tells me.\n\nSo, at barely 20, Antina Warjri applied for, and got a job, as a Class III clerk in the Telecommunications Department, Government of India. As a salaried worker, my mother “improved” upon her condition. She became part of a generation of working-class women in the family to enter the organized sector. This entry meant that my mother’s chances of becoming part of the middle-class in Shillong society increased, aided no less than by the fact that her job was “respectable.” But does entry into mainstream society necessarily mean the erosion of work related values and are working-class identities necessarily forgotten when material prospects improve?\n\nA recurrent story that my mother relates in her interactions with me concerns her working relationship with a customer of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL). By the time of her retirement in 2014, Antina Warjri had shifted base as a clerk from operational services to being a clerk in the administrative wing of the office. Her job involved manning the call centre and preparing bills, especially for customers who have leased their lands to BSNL for installing cell phone towers. A certain Mr. B.was due to receive his payment from BSNL for a cell phone tower which the corporation had erected in his house. At least five years had elapsed since the last payment and Mr.B.was in for quite a bit of money.\n\n“Please help me,” he begged my mother.\n\nSensing his desperation, Antina Warjri took it upon herself to hasten the process of preparing his bill and having it approved by a senior officer. Within a week’s time, Mr. B.received his arrears. Grateful to my mother, Mr. B.returned to the BSNL office bearing a gift.\n\n“Take it,” he said. “It is my appreciation for what you have done for me.”\n\n“I can’t,” my mother replied. “I was only doing my job and you bringing me such gifts defeats that purpose.”\n\n“If you do not take it, I’ll bring a hen.”\n\n“Please do not do so. I will not accept it, even if it were a hen.”\n\nThis anecdote is intended to highlight the importance of honesty in the workplace and in our dealings with fellow men and women. In addition, the story passes on lessons in humility. One should be humble enough to do one’s work without expectations of a reward and a faithful execution of one’s work and duty is enough of a reward so that one can abstain from accepting bribes. These principles are encapsulated in the Khasi aphorism, kamai ïa ka hok or to work for righteousness. Social and cultural markers symbolized through righteousness in work or kamai ïa ka hok link the private, individual context (my mother telling me the story) to public, communitarian outcomes. In telling this story, my mother was providing a point of reference so that if I were caught in a similar situation, I would know how to act. Work related values taught within the home are, therefore, validated through their practice within public, professional and social contexts. The implications of these values, however, reach beyond my mother’s working-class background and identity.\n\nWorking-class identity is a tricky subject. On the one hand, we have members of the community identifying themselves as working-class based on shared cultural and social experiences. My mother, for instance, especially remembers going to the local school as evidence of her belonging to the working-class community of Malki, Shillong.\n\n“The rich kids in the neighbourhood never went there,” she tells me.\n\nOn the other hand, working-class identity is also imposed from without, often with a tinge of bias by those who think they know what being “working-class” means. My memory takes me back to 2002, when the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) results were declared. I received a meagre 74 overall percentage. I was disappointed and particularly so when my paternal grandmother, my Meikha, had a thing or two to say on the matter.\n\n“Don’t be disappointed,” she told me.\n\nYou are, genetically speaking, not designed to do well in academics.\n\nMy paternal grandmother, a teacher, was referring to my working-class lineage. In my Meikha’s eyes, working-class legacies were distinctive because the community was/is by and large illiterate. My being middle-class, according to my Meikha, did not absolve me of my working-class antecedents. Meikha, like any other human being, however, was not infallible. Sixteen years on, the encounter impressed upon me the need to re-visit my working-class heritage, if only to prove Meikha wrong. I also realized that digging up my past is necessary in order for me to come to terms with a narrative that is deemed problematic and bound to failure.\n\nThe story begins with a plague in the village of Nongjri near Pynursla in East Khasi Hills District. San Klis Warjri, my mother’s cousin, provides me with an account of what happened then.\n\nSet among the rolling hills near Pynursla is the village of Nongjri. My ancestors lived there. Their economic and personal well-being was taken care of by farming and their participation in trade. From what San Klis Warjri tells me, the Warjri clan must have been quite prosperous. This claim to prosperity is supported by the fact that Bah Kyrhai Warjri, my maternal grandmother’s cousin, was able to obtain a large piece of land when he re-located from Nongjri to Malki, Shillong. At the turn of the 20thcentury, however, a plague overwhelmed the village. People died by the hundreds. According to family lore, there was only one old woman, seated beneath a rubber tree, who escaped the plague. It was at this time that my maternal great-grandmother, Kong Kyndir Warjri, decided to leave her place of birth. How she travelled the 30-odd kilometres to reach her destination in Shillong is a journey that is left to the imagination. Then, unlike now, the road to Shillong was barely a path cutting across dense forests filled with wild beasts and the occasional robber. The trek must have been dangerous as well as arduous. After a month or so hiatus at Nongkrem, Kong Kyndir Warjri made it to Malki. She settled in a three-room wooden hut where she promptly set up shop as a dealer in local alcohol or kyiad.\n\nThe hardships that my maternal great-grandmother faced must have hardened her to life. She is remembered as a woman with a caustic tongue, unforgivable in her reprimands both to her family and customers. My mother tells me:\n\nShe used her tongue like a two-edged sword\n\nShe was also engaged in a trade that, with the onset of Christianity and colonialism in Khasi Hills, was deemed illegal and disrespectful. It is, perhaps, not a coincidence that the line of work she was engaged in should be dominated by females. In his monograph, The Khasis (1914), P. R. T. Gurdon remarks on the prevalence of Khasi females who were engaged in the manufacture and distribution of kyiad in Khasi Hills. He writes:\n\nThe manufacture of country spirit gives employment to a considerable number of persons, most of whom are females. At a census of the country stills in the district, undertaken by the district officials, the number of stills was found to be 1,530. There must be at least one person employed at each still, so that the number of distillers would be probably not less than 2,000, possibly more. The spirit is distilled both for home consumption and for purposes of sale, in some villages almost entirely for sale.\n\nUntil the 1960s, therefore, Kong Kyndir Warjri worked in a sector that many of her contemporaries, and women before her, had been working in for a long time. As a young girl, my mother remembers carrying empty bottles to be filled with kyiad by the main dealer in Malki market. The kyiad was taken to customers surreptitiously and Kong Kyndir Warjri would take care to hide the bottles behind the wooden planks of her home should the state authorities come by for a surprise check. From the very beginning of her working-class career, therefore, my maternal great-grandmother was placed on the fringes of Shillong society. Her profession, which was illegal, made her a criminal in the eyes of the law. Moralistically too, she was regarded as an outcast, tempting Khasi men to waste their time drinking when they should be looking after their wives and children. And yet, it was all she could do to support her children and grandchildren.\n\n“Poverty. Extreme poverty compelled her to sell kyiad,” San Klis tells me.\n\nPoverty, however, could not stand in the way of moral convictions dictated by the Presbyterian Church. Counselled by her children and community members, Kong Kyndir Warjri gave up her profession to become a member of the Presbyterian Church in the early 1970s. Her decision to do so coincided with a larger socio-religious diktat that viewed the selling of kyiad as an unrespectable profession. As early as 1914, Christian churches―most notably the Welsh Presbyterian Church―were actively involved in tempering the tide of alcoholism in Khasi Hills. In The Khasis (1914), Gurdon comments on the widespread intake of kyiad in Khasi and Jaiñtia Hills:\n\nDrunkenness prevails on every market day at Cherrapunji, Jowai, and other large hats, and on occasions when there are gatherings of the people for various purposes. This cheap but strong spirit is demoralising the people, and more restriction of its use would be welcomed by many. In the Khasi Welsh Methodist Church abstention from liquor is made a condition of Church membership, but the vast number of stills and the facilities with which liquor can be obtained are a constant source of temptation to the Christian community, and cause many defections.\n\nGurdon’s observations reveal the popularity of kyiad as a social, communitarian drink. What is also interesting are the moral underpinnings associated with its consumption. The consumption of kyiad is seen as a “demoralizing” influence on the Khasi community, a notion that is popularized through support from Christian religious institutions. But because its manufacture and distribution was primarily done by women, it is safe to assume that working-class women would have faced the brunt of religious and social ostracization as a result of their trade. Christianity has been, and still is, the moral watchdog of Khasi society. But to solely attribute moral correctness to the church would be myopic, overlooking the ethics that the working-class women themselves possessed irrespective of their religious affiliations. In my maternal great-grandmother’s case, moral responsibility towards her family preceded any profession of religion. This is seen in her adoption of San Klis Warjri as a daughter long before she ―Kong Kyndir Warjri― became a Christian.\n\nSan Klis Warjri does not know her precise date of birth. At the time of the interview, on 7thJuly 2018, she surmises that she must be 87-years-old. Having suffered a fall in 2010, she has been mostly confined at home and, since that time, has been out for family gatherings only during weddings, births and deaths. As she hobbles on her walking stick, I was struck by how much age had transformed an otherwise healthy body. Her present physical state, however, belies a sharp, decisive mind. When I approached her with my proposal to write a family history from the perspective of women, she responded with enthusiasm. A cup of tea and half a story later, we were ready to begin. She led me to the living-room where she promptly shut the door on the rest of the house.\n\n“We must not be disturbed,” she says, ignoring entreaties from the rest of her family to conduct the interview in their presence.\n\nClearly, this is a woman who is sure of herself and is used to having her way. The decisiveness with which she claims her space is also reflected in her telling of stories. With very little prompting on my part, San Klis Warjri tells me of my familial origins, her entry into the narrative and her role as a member of the family.\n\nSan Klis Warjri recollects a troubled past. When she was about six or seven, her mother, my grandmother’s eldest sister, ran off to join a cult. The leader of the cult, Bah Kyrhai Warjri, had thought it necessary to lead his followers into the woods at Nongkrem to await the end of the world and Jesus Christ’s Second Coming. San Klis’ mother was never heard from again. Her mother’s disappearance caused San Klis to come to terms with the enduring realities of displacement; a reality that she observes to be at work till today.\n\n“We are all spread out,” she tells me. “Your mother is in Laitkor, I’m here in Laitumkhrah. We’ve all moved out of home (Malki).”\n\nYet Malki remained the place where San Klis’ sense of belonging would be restored following the loss of her mother. Until then, however, little Klis was brought up by her father, a carpenter. Whenever money was hard to come by, San Klis Warjri was taken to her paternal relatives’ place where she was made to eat. After some time of wandering about from place to place, depending on the work her father found, San Klis Warjri was adopted by my maternal great-grandmother’s eldest sister, Meirad Heh.\n\n“She (Meirad Heh) would never beat me,” San Klis tells me. “I was an orphan, you see.”\n\nIt was with the admonishment from Meirad Heh that San Klis should never be beaten that the little girl was eventually handed over to Kong Kyndir Warjri.\n\n“If she (Kong Kyndir Warjri) so much as raises a hand against you, you’re free to come home to me,” Meirad Heh told San Klis Warjri at the time of their parting.\n\nThus, with the reassurance that she could return anytime she wished, San Klis Warjri began her life in a new home. It must have been hard for her initially especially since my maternal great-grandmother, Kong Kyndir Warjri, was never open in her affections.\n\n“She (Kong Kyndir Warjri) was not a great talker. She never told stories,” San Klis Warjri tells me.\n\nBut this woman who was known only for heaping up curses against people gave San Klis Warjri the thing that she needed most of all―a family. The topic of San Klis’ adoption is rarely discussed in the family. When I broached the subject with my mother, I was heavily reprimanded.\n\n“Don’t be stupid,” my mother scolds me. “She (San Klis Warjri) is one of us.”\n\nThree generations of Warjri women (from left to right): San Klis Warjri, her daughter Kong Christina Rebecca Warjri and Meieit Synjup Warjri\n\nThe assimilation of the adopted child into the family reflects a practice among the Khasi community where adopted children become indistinguishable from one’s own biological children. Belonging to the same kpoh or womb, San Klis Warjri was readily integrated into the family. Later, when my maternal grandmother gave birth to her children, San Klis Warjri was looked upon as the eldest daughter. Oftentimes, she would play the role of a surrogate mother to her siblings. It is a role she takes seriously, especially in counselling her younger siblings on future marriage partners\n\nWhat surprised me in my interactions with the women in my family is the near-absence of men from their narratives. When I asked San Klis Warjri about her marriage, she was reluctant to talk about it, revealing only her husband’s name and the fact that she was probably “married off” when she was 20. I also learned that my maternal ancestors, instead of being officially married in a church or the court, practised co-habitation. This is an important piece of information as it indicates personal agency between the women and their chosen partners where matters of love are concerned. Co-habitation does away with religious and state authority as social imperatives needed for the institution of marriage. Should a couple want to stay together, a meeting between their respective families is arranged where, barring social taboos, their status as a “married” couple is decided. San Kils Warjri remembers many instances when she acted as a mediator and facilitator between the families of couples who had decided to stay together.\n\n“When your uncle wanted to stay with Ñia Rilin, I was the one who talked to her family,” she tells me. “I also counselled him on various aspects of married life and starting a family.”\n\nThe roles that San Klis Warjri played as mediator and advisor where conjugal relations within the family are concerned, are rather unusual. Usually, in Khasi society, such roles are given to the kñi or the uncle. Owing to their deaths, my maternal grandmother’s brothers, Bah Jorshon Warjri, Bah Korshon Warjri and Bah Dorshon Warjri, were absent when my mother and her siblings wanted to start families of their own. The absence of the kñi enabled San Klis Warjri to come into her own as a primary negotiator and the go-to person where family affairs were concerned. It is a role that is hard earned and one that involved years of hard work and sacrifice on behalf of the family.\n\nAt about ten years of age, San Klis Warjri was compelled to leave school and was made to work as a help in a tea shop. The woman she worked for, Nah S., owned a tea shop near the Guwahati High Court in Shillong.\n\n“Little one, wash my cup,”“Little one, bring me my tea” were words that would send San Klis Warjri scurrying around the shop to fulfil customers’ demands. For her efforts, San Klis Warjri was given generous tips by the lawyers who visited the shop daily. She particularly remembers an incident when a man from Sohra tipped her more than the usual fare.\n\n“He gave me five rupees. In those days, five rupees was the equivalent of a hundred rupees today,” she tells me.\n\nWith the precious money in her hand, San Klis Warjri hurried over to her corner of the shop to stow away the prize.\n\n“Meirad Kyndir will be happy today,” she thought. “Imagine what five rupees would do. Maybe we could have a week’s worth of that beef stew she always wanted.”\n\nWhat San Klis Warjri imagined the five rupees could bring her, however, was short-lived.\n\n“Did that man give you that?” asked an angry man’s voice.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Return it to him immediately otherwise he’ll take you away to be his wife.”\n\n“His wife! Ani! What does that even mean? If he takes me away, who will look after Meirad and Parad?”\n\nIt cannot be. So, with a drooping heart, San Klis Warjri returned the money surrendering, along with it, the promise of succulent beef stew. The experience would leave her in no doubt over the ethics that a woman needs in dealing with men: in the cut-throat world of jacks and kings, innocence and concern for one’s family save the day.\n\nSan Klis Warjri continued to work as a daily wage labourer, mostly as domestic help in people’s houses, until the mid-1950s when she finally got a job as a housekeeper at the government-run Pinewood Hotel. By then, she had married Bah Alfred Wahlang and had started a family of her own. But the lessons she learned while she worked at the tea shop would stay with her till today.\n\n“Honesty,” she tells me, “is what matters.”\n\nUp until the time when she had a family of her own, San Klis Warjri would hand over all her earnings to my maternal great-grandmother, ensuring that―in no small way―she was responsible for seeing her younger siblings through school, an opportunity that she was denied.\n\nEducation is a much talked about subject in a working-class home; often, with a sense of distrust as to what it might achieve for an individual. Superstition also played a role in discouraging parents from sending their children to school. My maternal great-grandmother, Kong Kyndir Warjri, for instance, refused to send my maternal grandmother to school, believing that doing so would make the child susceptible to kidnapping by “dkhars.” But more than superstitious belief, poverty is a major deterrent in keeping children away from classrooms. With so many mouths to feed, one simply cannot afford to spend money on education. Often, as was the case with San Klis Warjri, the oldest sibling would have to forgo school so that the needs of the younger siblings are met. But education gave working-class women something else that living without it did not―aspirations to be something other than what current reality offered. Certainly, this was true of my maternal grandmother, Meieit Synjup Warjri.\n\nI always picture Meieit Synjup Warjri glued to a mula in a corner of the kitchen, mouth blood-red from chewing kwai. This is the memory I have of my maternal grandmother. That, and the fact that she never spoke much. When she did, it would be to enquire if we had eaten lunch and, if not, whether we would like to have some with her. Because Meieit Synjup Warjri mostly kept to herself, I have very little first-hand information about her life. The little that I know of her past has been gleaned from my conversations with my mother and my aunts.\n\nMeieit Synjup Warjri was the second youngest of eight siblings. Owing to the early death of the khatduh or youngest daughter, the custody of the family property fell on her. When she was about 20-years-old, she fell in love and co-habited with Bah Bekin Rymbai, a tailor. At an early age, Meieit Synjup Warjri nurtured a desire to go to school. She knew that she had to go to school if she wanted to become a nurse. She saw her contemporaries running off to school and envied them for it. And so, with her youngest sibling on her back, she would steal out of the house and attend the local government school at Malki.\n\nLittle is known about Meieit Synjup Warjri’s brief time at school. Perhaps she learnt to recite the multiplication table. Perhaps she was rewarded by the teacher for getting her sums right. In any case, her experience in school impressed upon her the need to have her children educated. Meieit Synjup Warjri wanted her children to lead better lives than what fate had handed down to her and education, she thought, would be their passport out of the crippling poverty she saw around her. From an early stage in her adult life, Meieit Synjup Warjri scraped and saved whatever money she could to pay for her children’s education. Of course, the schools and colleges they were sent to were not premier institutions but my mother and her siblings were encouraged to take their education seriously. When it so happened that my uncle, Mama Hughlet Warjri, played truant he was in for a surprise.\n\nIt must be mentioned that Meieit Synjup Warjri was never one for corporal punishment. When any of her children went astray, she would gently chide them about their behaviour.\n\n“She never raised a hand against any of us,” my mother recalls. “She was a gentle soul.”\n\nVery few things angered my maternal grandmother and one of them was when her children took their education lightly. The story goes that one day, Mama Hughlet Warjri decided that he would much rather go to the cinema than go to school. He was discovered by a neighbour who took the news of his truancy to Meieit Synjup Warjri.\n\n“I saw him [Mama Hughlet Warjri] at Kelvin,” the neighbour said. “What was he doing there?”\n\nMama Hughlet Warjri arrived home that day to a scowl on Meieit Synjup Warjri’s face.\n\n“So, you prefer the cinema to school, do you?” she asked him, “We shall see.”\n\nThe next morning Meieit Synjup Warjri pronounced Mama Hughlet Warjri’s punishment. While his brother and sisters went to school, he was instructed to carry sand on his back for the construction of a relative’s house. Dejectedly, he reached for the conical bamboo basket (ka khoh) and its appendage (ustar) and went to work. His muscles strained at the effort but Meieit Synjup Warjri would not let up. She was determined that her son would learn his lesson. The only time Mama Hughlet Warjri was allowed to rest was when he had his lunch and dinner. A day turned into two and two days became a week. Still, Meieit Synjup Warjri kept prodding her son on. She even neglected her duties at the tea shop to keep a watchful eye on her son. Finally, on the eighth day, she relented.\n\n“Enough,” she said.\n\nHeaving a sigh of relief, Mama Hughlet Warjri returned the ka khoh and u star to the corner of the kitchen. He finally understood what his mother was trying to teach him. If he neglected school he would have to spend the rest of his life building other people’s houses while not having one himself. The incident also reveals a certain truism: most daily wage labourers in the Khasi community do not exercise free choice in their line of work. They become daily wage labourers out of necessity because that is the only form of work available to them. The lesson that Mama Hughlet Warjri learned from his mother made a deep, personal impression and influenced his choice of work. He went on to become an author, writing novels and short stories in the Khasi language for a living. Having taken care of her domestic responsibilities, Meieit Synjup Warjri returned to her working life as a tea seller.\n\nIf you ever make it to the Khasi Hills, you will find small shops made out of wood or, more recently, reinforced concrete on the roadsides. Usually, a sign hangs on the doors of these shops― “Hangne Die Sha bad Ja” or “Here, We Sell Tea and Rice.” On any given day, one finds numerous people gulping down cups of tea and jadoh within the confines of the shops. These are the famous tea shops of Khasi Hills, reflecting the community’s ongoing, quotidian connection to the colonial past.Mostly run by women, these shops testify to the working roles that Khasi women play and their contribution to the everyday running of the economy. It was in one of these shops near the office of the Accountant General that Meieit Synjup Warjri conducted her business. Due to dearth of research and information on women running these tea shops, I have relied on interviews with a couple of women who are engaged in these businesses to get a sense of what everyday life in a tea shop is like.\n\nA tea seller’s day begins at dawn when the dough that has been prepared the night before is fried and made into namkees, samosas and rice delicacies such as putharo that the customers have with their tea. By 10 in the morning, business starts. It marks the beginning of a busy day where, apart from money, news and local gossip are also exchanged by the customers. Spending time in the tea shops keeps one in the know of the goings-on in the neighbourhood and regional as well as national politics. Exposed to this world, the working-class woman knows herself to be part of a larger social and political milieu. It is a rare tea shop proprietor who does not have an opinion on social and political issues. What happens in the public sphere of the tea shop translates into other political activities such as the family’s support for political parties and voting. Thus, apart from economic benefits, the working-class woman has some degree of influence over the nature of public and political outcomes. Because of this work, the private and public domains overlap. Since the daughters of the house are called upon to help with the preparation of the snacks, the tea shop also reflects a gendered space.\n\nMy maternal aunt, San Wantimon Warjri, remembers helping Meieit Synjup Warjri in preparing the food.\n\n“We would make the dough for the singaras the previous day,” she says. “This made it easier for my mother [Meieit Synjup Warjri] to fry them in the morning. The food was always fresh which attracted a lot of customers to her shop.”\n\nBorn on March 1, 1950, San Wantimon Warjri remembers a time before technological innovations in the form of computers made an appearance. She began her work as a typist and by the time she retired in 2008, she had become a supervisor for typists at the BSNL office.\n\n“Computers,” she says, “have made such professions redundant.”\n\nTogether with ushering a new era in telecommunications, however, the age of computers also did away with the communitarian values that San Wantimon Warjri perceives to be central to her narrative.\n\n“I remember a time when people were good. Not like today,” she tells me.\n\nHer memory takes her back to her childhood.\n\n“We went to school in the Mission Compound where all the poor children went. We didn’t even have shoes,” she says.\n\nOne day, she tells me, as she and her friends were walking to school, a black car followed them.\n\n“Go away! Go away!” yelled the frightened children.\n\nFifty metres and the car still kept following. By now, San Wantimon Warjri and her friends were terrified. Of late, they had been hearing rumours of nongshohnoh kidnapping children in big, black cars with tinted windows just like the one following them. Fortunately for them, another car pulled over.\n\n“That black car is owned by a nongshohnoh,” the driver of the second car told them. “Do not worry. Walk along and I’ll escort you to school.”\n\nSan Wantimon Warjri and her friends reached school safely that day. But the driver in the second car could have easily been the bus conductor who would give her a free ride everyday, the neighbour who looked after her when her mother was away or the man who owned a horse cart and gave my mother and her friends a bumpy ride to school. Whatever the situation one finds oneself in there are always people and family to count on. It was also concern for the family that influenced San Wantimon Warjri’s decision to help her mother, Meieit Synjup Warjri.\n\n“The tea shop was our bread-and-butter,” she tells me. “It was important that I also pitched in to help in running the business.”\n\nMeieit Synjup Warjri’s duties were not confined to the shop alone. She also made it a point to visit the neighbouring offices to sell her wares. As the proprietor of a tea shop, she engaged a couple of girls to help her with the running of the shop. Washing dishes, cleaning and delivering tea to office workers―as is the case with tea shops today―were taken care of by these helpers. When one of them (or both) was absent, however, it fell on my mother’s older sister, San Wantimon Warjri, to fulfil their duties. Often, especially when the time came to collect credit owed to Meieit Synjup Warjri from the office workers, San Wantimon Warjri would forgo a day at school to help collect the money. Like the running of tea shops today, the wages that Meieit Synjup Warjri earned from her business were not much. As Miss S., a present-day tea shop proprietor tells me, missing one day at work could make a difference in whether the rent for the month is paid or not. The economics of the tea shop are tied as much to the size of the business as to familial obligations. Owning a rather small business, Meieit Synjup Warjri could not afford to take time off work. When Mama Hughlet Warjri played truant, therefore, the matter was serious enough to warrant her presence at home for a week, at the very least. For Meieit Synjup Warjri, it was the family that sustained life outside of it; the tea shop being an establishment that extended her role as a mother and breadwinner for her family. Meieit Synjup Warjri’s profession is also connected to her belonging to a place where most of the residents have working-class lineages.\n\nThen, unlike now, Malki was a sparsely populated locality with most of its inhabitants belonging to the working-class community. As it turns out, most of the women from Malki were tea sellers. My mother, Antina Warjri, gives me a sense of how selling tea was indicative of one’s belonging to the working-class community in Malki, Shillong.\n\n“Malki tea was very famous,” my mother tells me. “How could Meieit Synjup Warjri be anything else but a tea seller given the popularity of tea in the Malki community?”\n\nAlthough my mother’s observations are innocently articulated there is a gendered component to her words. Why is it that a majority of tea sellers from Malki were women? Is it possible that gendered identities within the domestic sphere also influenced one’s chosen profession? Domestic duties were, according to my mother, divided on the basis of gender. While the men in the house were required to do physically demanding chores such as carrying water from the local pump, women were expected to do “soft” chores such as preparing meals and washing utensils and clothes. The tea shop, which entailed that women should serve customers tea and food, make polite conversation with their “guests” and wash dishes (the latter evidenced in highly scrubbed utensils), was a public extension of domestic duties nurtured within the confines of the home. While such duties did not yield monetary rewards when performed within the confines of the home, the same duties in the tea shop were a means of livelihood. The performance of gendered identities, therefore, is held in place by their nurturing in the domestic sphere and by the system of reward that accompanied such a performance in the public sphere.\n\nThe Past, Present and Future\n\nThe three-room hut that was home to my maternal great-grandmother, Kong Kyndir Warjri, and after her, my maternal grandmother, Meieit Synjup Warjri, has been dismantled. In its stead is a three-storeyed house where my cousins now live. There is a frost-free refrigerator in the corner of the kitchen but the past, it seems, refuses to die down. On chilly days, a chulha is brought out and we gather around the fire. The stories are told once more and we, the fourth generation, are transported back to the past. They are stories of dreams and losses; but more importantly, of hope. Because my maternal ancestors survived displacement, poverty and hardship, it is implied that I will do the same.\n\nSeveral features of these narratives in a working-class home stand out. In the absence of history to testify to the existence and achievements of working-class women in Khasi Hills, memory plays an important role in shoring up narratives that historical records have left out. This memory which places the working-class subject within the matrix of social, political and cultural forces, seeks to dismantle the same by creating subjects whose peripheral presence constantly challenges the dominant narrative. Stories told around the hearth stem from working-class women’s needs and desires to be remembered in ways that are especially subversive. On the other hand, the performance of normative gendered roles need not be indicative of oppression. Resourcefulness on the part of the gendered subject enables a woman to transcend patriarchal barriers and question the social status quo. Often, as is seen in their narratives, working-class women step into societal roles traditionally assigned to men as workers, disciplinarians or familial mediators. The working-class woman, therefore, shows that gender is, essentially, a fluid identity both at home and in the public sphere. She occupies an in-between place, balancing societal expectations on the one hand and simultaneously questioning what society expects of her on the other. Hence, the act of remembrance is characterized by liminal gendered variables.\n\nWhile the notion and character of work changes with each succeeding generation (my cousins and I lead fairly middle-class lives now), working-class legacies still form the bedrock against which identity and belonging are measured. Household chores such as cooking, cleaning and washing dishes still form part of our daily, quotidian commitments to our working-class past. The ethics related to work are especially noteworthy in this regard. By telling their stories, the women interviewed in this essay impart values of honesty and perseverance to succeeding generations.These values of underlying work remain in place even when the subject―as in the case of my mother, Antina Warjri―enjoys middle-class amenities. Apart from surnames, therefore, what are passed down in matrilineal societies are ethical values associated, in this instance, with belonging to a certain class. Working-class memory itself, however, stretches back to historical, geographical and gendered narratives of identity formation.\n\nOne of the key components "
