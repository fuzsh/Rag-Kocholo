In designing the Model A, reference was taken from a car made in Europe.\n\nThe model was built using sketches of the dismantled base car. The engine was built of cast iron, the chassis of beaten sheet metal and the interior was made by experienced horse coachbuilders using hollowed-out lacquered white cypress. It was fitted with gas headlamps, used an air blown horn and the body shell was formed from lacquered steel panels stuck to a wooden frame. The interior trim used luxury English worsted fabric. The Model A was displayed at the Fukuoka Expo in 1919 alongside an aircraft engine also manufactured by the Kobe Shipyard. Sales of the Model A were handled by the Ote Company, Mitsubishi's first automobile sales company and a joint venture between Mitsubishi Shipbuilding and Mitsubishi Corporation.\n\nIn June 1946 the prototype XTM1 for a small three-wheel truck with a 0.4 ton payload was completed and named Mizushima. Powered by a 744cc 4-cycle single-cylinder air-cooled engine, the truck was 2780 mm long, 1196 mm wide and 1230 mm high and carried a cargo bed that was 1100 mm long and 1106 mm wide. Unusually for three-wheel truck, the Mizushima had popular features including a folding soft top and aviation technology windows. Successive improvements were made through 11 prototypes and the vehicle underwent on-road proving in the hills of Hakone outside Tokyo before it went into full-scale production and on sale as the 0.5 ton payload TM3A in May 1947. The TM3A Mizushima was Mitsubishiâs first standard truck and the first to go into mass production and on sale to the public. In the year to May 1948, 945 were produced, after which production of small three-wheel vehicles continued at Mitsubishi until 1962 by which time a total of some 90,000 units had been produced.\n\nImmediately after World War II, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Co. Ltd. had seeked a path to reconstruction in the Nagoya area where it used to have its largest business premises. When the company heard that Kojiro Maruyama, who had been an engineer with General Motors, had brought a scooter back with him from America, it immediately invited him to join the company and started work on designing a Japanese-made scooter using Maruyama's scooter for reference. The first prototype was completed in August 1946. It was powered by a 112 cc 4-stroke side-valve air-cooled single-cylinder engine developing 1.5 PS. Using a flywheel magnet, the scooter had to be pushed to fire up the engine. For this reason, it was fitted with a lever on the handlebars that activated a compression release valve in the cylinder head.\n\nThe scooter was given the C-10 type code and named the Silver Pigeon and after it and the engine were granted mass production approval. It went on sale at the beginning of 1947. A facelift the following year saw the introduction of the Silver Pigeon C-11 model. The company was honored to present a C-11 scooter to his Imperial Highness the Crown Prince (now the Emperor) of Japan.\n\nWith a production run extending to 18 years and earning valuable export volume at the time, the Silver Pigeon made a major contribution to the company's business results.\n\nThe three-wheel K-truck came under the spotlight in Japan and ignited a sales boom in the years just before and after 1960, offering scooter-like drivability as well as benefits in terms of vehicle taxes during the transition from scooter to four-wheel K-truck. Amid this growth in demand, Mitsubishi launched the Leo three-wheel K-truck in 1959. With its name taken from a character in a popular manga series at the time, \"Kimba the White Lion\" by Osamu Tezuka, It featured the first fully enclosed all-steel cabin with seating for two on a three-wheel K-truck and shortly after its launch became a best-seller with production topping 1,000 units a month. The three-wheel K-truck market in Japan enjoyed explosive growth around this time with production soaring from 14,000 units in 1958 to 83,000 in 1959 and to 190,000 in 1960. Altogether, 28,000 Leo models were produced. The boom in three-wheel K-truck sales was short-lived, however, peaking in 1960 and after which four-wheel K-truck became the mainstream. Mitsubishi also moved to four-wheel K-truck production when it launched the Mitsubishi 360. While its production run was very short, Leo served an important role as the link between three- and four-wheel K-trucks.\n\nA compact family car, introduced in 1960, the Mitsubishi 500 was the first mass production passenger car to be made by Mitsubishi post World War II in concert with the \"national vehicle plan\" implemented by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.\n\nEmployed latest technologies at the time seeking simplicity and rationality in design, the 500 was sold at an affordable price of 390,000 yen. With a monocoque body construction and rear-engine/rear-wheel drive layout, the spare tire and fuel tank were housed under the front hood. It featured a practical and simple design with a single wiper, no indicators on front or rear except for a single set mounted on the side pillar.\n\nIt was the first Japanese car to be tested in a wind tunnel.\n\nIn 1961 the 500 was replaced by the Mitsubishi 500 Super Deluxe that offered seating for five, a 594 cc engine replacing the original 493 cc unit and much improved acceleration.\n\nThe Mitsubishi 500 made its world debut in the international motor sport at the Macau Grand Prix where four Mitsubishi 500's occupied from the first to fourth rank in the category of class A (less than 750cc).\n\nThe Mitsubishi 360 K-light van was developed as a trailblazer for Mitsubishi four-wheel K-cars. Targeting small and medium-size businesses, the new car was designed as a commercial vehicle for transporting small loads of goods, people and for communications. At the same time, with an eye on the growing popularity of passenger K-cars, the company chose a \"wide, low and beautiful\" styling theme as it aimed to develop an attractive vehicle which had a chic passenger car flavor to it. Designed with a frameless, lightweight and rigid body, the Mitsubishi 360 was powered by a 359cc 2-cylinder 2-stroke air-cooled engine designed especially for it mounted at the front and driving the rear wheels. Its styling gave it the lines of a passenger car and was offered in two body types: a panel van with blank windows and seating for two; and a light van with seating for four. Christened the Mitsubishi 360 this K-car light van was launched in April 1961 after being shown at the Tokyo Motor Show. In October of the same year the lineup was joined by a pickup model and in April 1962 by a deluxe specification light van. Production of all derivatives in the lineup totaled 54,000 units in the 1963 fiscal year as it garnered a 16 percent share of the market. Mitsubishi 360 established the market base for Mitsubishi Motors cars today.\n\nIntroduced in 1962, the Mitsubishi Colt 600 was the first Mitsubishi model to bear the Colt name. The Mitsubishi 500 Super Deluxe that won the Class A victory in the 1962 Macau Grand Prix received high critical acclaim for its performance but with other auto makers starting to bring out a wide variety of K-cars it was on this classification that consumer popularity focused because of its favorable tax treatment. To break through this situation Mitsubishi gave the styling and equipment specification of the Mitsubishi 500 Super Deluxe, which had been slated for being too simple, a complete makeover. The new model sported a somewhat pointy exterior design crafted using narrow lines for the front half and the tail of the body, while the interior underwent an overall refinement. Colt 600 retained the monocoque body and rear-mounted engine/rear-wheel drive configuration of the 500 Super Deluxe but was made more competitive with the use of a steering column shifter, a bench seat and increased fuel tank size. Colt 600 displayed its high performance qualities when Mitsubishi entered it in the 1963 Malaysian Grand Prix where it took line honors as well as second and third places in the under 600 cc class. Colt 600 is recognized as being a prime mover in driving the company's growth.\n\nThe Debonair is a flagship model into which Shin Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Co. Ltd. poured its entire technological prowess as an automobile manufacturer. Powered by 2.0L 6 cylinder twin-carb engine, its maximum speed was 155km/h. The model made its first public appearance at the 1963 Tokyo Motor Show as the Mitsubishi Colt Debonair. It attracted favorable attention at the Motor Show, and was launched in July 1964.\n\nIn the 22 years before the advent of the Debonair V in 1986, basic design or styling and its unique lines remained and its dignified stylying was fondly regarded. The person responsible for the styling was GM designer Hans S. Bretzner, who took leave from the GM Design Center and was looking to work as a design consultant for a Japanese auto maker. Mitsubishi engaged his services. Bretzner worked passionately on developing the design of this model, to the extent that he went to Kyoto's famed weaving district of Nishijin to find a woven fabric for the seat upholstery for the car that was displayed at the Tokyo Motor Show. He also designed the exhibit stand. Through its collaboration with Bretzner, the company was able to obtain valuable knowhow on using imported oil-based clay to create clay models.\n\nThe 1st Japanese Grand Prix had been held at the Suzuka circuit in 1963, attracting the attention of the Japanese nation to motorsport. This was quickly followed by the dawning of \"the highway age\" when the Meishin Highway opened in July 1965 and saw demand for high output cars start to grow. As Japan embarked on becoming a motorized nation, the first Colt 600 of 1962 was succeeded by the 1000 in 1963.\n\nThe Colt 1500 launched in October 1965 was designed to strengthen the Colt series and meet the needs of this fledgling market. It retained Colt 1000's styling but featured a longer wheelbase and overall length. Previous Colt models had been fitted with two headlamps but Colt 1500 had four. It was also more powerful with its 1.5L 4-cylinder OHV engine producing 70 PS and taking it up to a maximum speed of 140 km/h.\n\nThe Colt 1100 was launched in September 1966 with a 1.1L engine to boost the power output of the Colt 1000, an extra 100 cc were added to a 1.0L engine which was becoming pretty ubiquitous at the time. At 58 PS, power output was much higher than the 51 PS produced by Colt 1000 and with its lighter body delivered a significant increase in driving performance. Improved wiper, heater and defroster performances, a classy dashboard with a switch and control layout that was easier to operate, quieter noise levels after improvements to the underpinnings and transmission, and front seats that allowed taller drivers to obtain a more comfortable driving position all served to deliver a more luxurious ride quality.\n\nIn terms of styling features, Colt 1000 and Colt 1100 were fitted with round headlamps, Colt 1500 with twin round headlamps, while the New Colt 1200 and 1500 which were launched after a redesign in 1968 used twin square headlamps.\n\nThe Colt 1000F was launched in September 1966 which retained the same styling of the Colt 800 innovative fastback body, with more powerful \"1.0L 4-cylinder engine\" from the Colt 1000 that had proved so successful over a period of four years. With output pumped up to 55 PS and offering improvements in performance, economy and reliability this model was critically acclaimed for meeting the requirements of the new age of high-speed motoring. When launched Colt 1000F had the same 2-door body as Colt 800 but in December 1967, it was joined by a 3-door hatchback version with tailgate, and in August 1968 by a 4-door sedan model. To maximize the limited interior space enclosed by its fastback lines, Colt 1000F offered a variety of storages. The seats were designed for greater comfort and less fatigue on longer journeys and the front seats had 180mm of slide travel. The brochure for the 3-door hatchback model described as, \"The first passenger car to offer so much utility\" and contained an illustrated explanation of the different ways in which the seats could be arranged.\n\nGiving further breadth to the Colt series, the Colt 1100 and Colt 1500 underwent a major redesign to spawn the New Colt 1200 and New Colt 1500 which shared the same body and were brought to market in May 1968. In April 1968, the first three sections of the new Tomei Expressway were opened: Tokyo to Atsugi, Fuji to Shizuoka, and Okazaki to Komaki. Development of the new Colts focused on meeting the dynamic performance required in a real highway era about to arrive as well as to provide improved interior comfort and safety. In keeping with the promises the highway era offered, the styling was crafted using Mitsubishi's \"dynastream lines,\" a three-dimensional front grill and fascia with rectangular headlamps, a stable rear view using wide slim rectangular taillamps, and a side view that made full use of the long wheelbase. All New Colts were fitted with a tilting steering column. Variable ratio steering and all-weather ventilation were other new technologies adopted in the series.\n\nThe Colt series stirred up a storm of interest when the Colt 800 was launched in 1965 as the first Japanese car with fastback styling. It was followed in 1966 by the 1000F which used the same body design but was powered by a 4-cylinder 4-stroke engine. 1967 saw the addition to the series of 3-door hatchback. This was followed in August 1968 by the 4-door Colt 1000F and by the Colt 1100F Sport which offered various performances. Then in November of the same year the Colt 1100F Super Sport was announced with more focus on running performance in the series. The Super Sport featured a tuned engine using an SU twin carburetor to deliver 73 PS, had front disc brakes and radial tires and 3-point front seat belts and gave a glimpse of the company's first GT model.\n\nUnder one-ton four-wheel light truck sales had been growing steadily, mainly on the back of demand from the retail, wholesale, manufacturing and other industries. In anticipation of further growth in light truck demand and after launching the Minicab Truck in August 1966 Mitsubishi shifted its light truck development into a higher gear around April 1967. The first fruit of this development drive was the introduction of the Delica Truck in July 1968. With its name deriving from a contraction of the English \"delivery car\", the Delica Truck adopted a cab-over-engine design to increase payload capacity and interior space at a time when bonnet-type design dominated the class. The Delica Van, Delica Route Van and Delica Cargo variations as well as a high-cargo bed Delica Truck were launched the following year to offer a wider lineup of commercial vehicles. The Delica Truck was distinguished by soft lines using curved glass and offered the first 3-seat cabin in its class as well as a maximum payload of 600 kg, more than any other vehicle in its class. It was powered by the same 1.1 L engine used in the Colt 1100, developing class-topping 58 PS.\n\nThe Colt Galant made its debut in December 1969 as the first Mitsubishi model to bear the name Galant. With the advent of the highway era now in earnest, the model was developed to the key phrases of \"more beautiful,\" \"higher performance,\" \"wider,\" \"quieter,\" and \"more luxurious\". It was powered by 1.3 L and 1.5 L engines, Mitsubishi's first OHC power units. The cabin was roomier and as well as offering generous front seat leg room there was ample head clearance for rear seat passengers and a spacious trunk. The dashboard located an oval instrument cluster with a patented non-reflective curved visor and together with fatigue-reducing double-spring front seats allowed the driver to enjoy their motoring in comfort even on longer distance driving. The addition of a 2-door hardtop and an estate van in 1970 expanded the target customer group. There were competition successes for the Colt Galant in both domestic and international rallies, including an overall victory for the 16L-GS in the 7th Southern Rally in 1972.\n\nResponding to the rapid growth in demand for light trucks of under one-ton payload in the mid-60s, the Delica Truck with a 600 kg payload went on sale in July 1968. Features distinguishing the Delica Truck included its payload that was some 20 percent larger than other models in its class, class-topping power output, the first 3-seater in its class, soft lines using a curved windscreen and ride comfort on a par with a passenger car. In 1969, a year after the Delica Truck's launch, the Delica Light Van 500 kg one-box cargo van, Delica Route Van, and Delica Coach 9-seater passenger van were added to the lineup. In November 1971, a new engine was added, payload was increased by 100 kg and the name changed to Delica 75. As consumers became more conscious of leisure time in the early 1970s, the Delica Camping Van with a pop-up roof went on sale in 1972. Although the Delica name derives from the English delivery car, it has played an active role as a utility vehicle that goes outside the conventional commercial vehicle box from its first-generation Delica to this date.\n\nJuly 1969 saw the introduction of the second-generation Minica bearing the name Minica 70 after a major redesign of the model originally launched in 1962 as Mitsubishi was keen to offer a minicar which anticipated the needs of the 1970s. Minica 70 was developed and designed employing the latest in Mitsubishi technology as a K-car that would handle highway driving faster, more comfortably and more safely. Features included \"wing flowline\" styling that lowered aerodynamic drag and a rear hatch. MacPherson strut suspension was used at the front and a 5-link rigid axle at the rear. Minica 70 was fitted with urethane foam padded seats giving superior comfort and durability, as well as a powerful 2-level heater / all-weather ventilation system that allowed the driver to adjust vent angles and air flow. In December 1969 the twin carburetor 38 PS SS and GSS performance models, and in October 1970 the GL luxury trim level with stereo radio receiver were added to the lineup. After a minor change in September 1971 the model name was changed to Minica 72.\n\nMitsubishi showed the Galant Coupe GTX-1 at the Tokyo Motor Show in the fall of 1969 where it created a sensation. Featuring long nose and short deck proportions and sporty, styling, the car was developed to gain a foothold in the market for cutting-edge specialty models. After further development, it was launched in November 1970 bearing the Galant GTO nameplate. Deriving from the Italian Grande Tourismo Omologare, GTO signified that this was a model that had been officially approved as a GT car. Features distinguishing Galant GTO included its long nose proportions and a ducktail that harmonized sporty and elegant lines with function of reducing air drag. It was also the first Japanese car to use curved side windows with a 50-inch curvature ratio in a tumblehome cross-section design. The roominess of the cabin overturned preconceived notions that coupes were short of interior space. The round-sided instrument panel gave the feeling of sitting in the pilot's seat of an aircraft. The GTO-MR performance version powered by Mitsubishi Motors' first new Saturn DOHC engine (125 PS) today remains one of the most illustrious cars to grace the Japanese market.\n\nThe Galant Coupe FTO launched in November 1971 was designed to share some of the underpinnings and body of the Colt Galant with its proven track record while creating a full-feature coupe similar to the Galant GTO. FTO derives from the Italian Fresco Tourismo Omologare and signifies a \"touring car with a new kind of coupe styling\". Its fast/notchback styling solved the issues of poor rearward visibility and restrictions on the trunk opening as well as eliminating the tail dropping look common to fastback coupes. With a windshield rake of 34.5 degrees and side glass with a 50 inch curvature ratio it caught other auto makers off guard with its unique styling. At 1300 mm Galant Coupe FTO offered the widest interior in its class and while being the lowest in overall height it offered the best head clearance. It was powered by a 1378 cc engine with high-lift camshaft giving excellent durability at high revs. On the safety front, the body structure was designed with impact-absorbing front and rear sections for better cabin protection.\n\nThe Minica Skipper launched in May 1971 is a sporty K-car with fastback styling, popular at the time, and represented a smaller version of the Galant GTO. It was the first Japanese car to use scooped rear glass and was distinguished by its high cut-off tail design that provided good visibility. The Skipper designation reflects the intent to create a car that would bring variety to and allow young adults with more matured tastes to enjoy their everyday life stylishly. The GT top trim model was powered by a twin SU carburetor water-cooled engine that developed 38 PS and took the car up to a maximum speed of 120 km/h and which, with its gold-finish air cleaner case, was called the Gold engine. This was later replaced in October 1972 by the 4-stroke engine in response to concerns about air pollution and the model was renamed Skipper IV. Another feature distinguishing the Minica Skipper was its equipment specification which - with radial tires, bucket seats and stereo radio receiver - was on a par with that of a compact car.\n\nThe second-generation Minicab Truck was launched in June 1971 bearing the Minicab EL nameplate. Both step-style and drop-side types boasted the largest cargo bed in their class and the flat floor construction with no wheel arch intrusion meant it could easily carry items up to 182 cm long. Curved glazing all-around, rectangular headlamps, large door openings, separate seats and a floor-mounted shifter were features that gave it more of a passenger car-like feeling. It was initially powered by a 2-stroke air-cooled engine which had been upgraded from 28 PS to 30 PS but a year after its launch in September 1972 this was replaced by a 2-stroke water-cooled engine and the model name was changed to Minicab W. With the Minicab Truck series having undergone a full model redesign in 1971, the Minicab Van was given a new front grille and its name changed to the Minicab EL Van. In 1972, the Minicab EL Panel Van was added to the lineup.\n\nSpurred by the enactment of the Air Pollution Control Act passed by the Japanese government, Mitsubishi Motors launched the third-generation Minica, Minica F4 powered by a new 4-stroke water-cooled engine in October 1972. The F4 designation pointed to the model's family-use orientation and to its 4-stroke engine. The styling took its cue from the Japanese scarab beetle and was developed to give it as friendly an appearance as possible. Larger doors facilitated access to and from the rear seats. The Minica F4 was powered by the new 4-stroke water-cooled engine which incorporated the Mitsubishi Clean Air (MCA) system that optimized fuel combustion for cleaner emissions. The Minica F4's major distinguishing feature was its sash-less rear window that opened up like a tailgate to make loading and unloading easier. Its front-engine/rear-wheel drive layout gave it a generous pedal layout and a slight degree of understeer while the use of fully reclining front seats was another example of the effort that had gone into making the Minica F4 easy to drive.\n\nThe Lancer is a compact passenger car launched in February 1973. It is named after a soldier of the cavalry regiment armed with a lance in the knightly age in Europe. The styling was aerodynamically oriented, giving the Lancer a long low \"aero nose\" with superior drag characteristics, a tumblehome, and wide turn-under proportion. It used a strong and safe monocoque body structure. The Lancer was powered by engines using Mitsubishi Clean Air technology and was the first 1973 model to be certified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as using a low-pollution engine. With tilt-adjust steering column, a 45 L fuel tank, all-season ventilation, disc brakes and vacuum booster assist for the master cylinder, the Lancer offered fatigue-free driving and reliability even on longer trips. In August 1973, the Lancer 1600GSR powered by the twin carburetor engine (110 PS) joined the lineup. In 1974, this model was piloted to overall victory in its debut Safari Rally by \"Flying Sikh\" Joginder Singh. The Lancer with its strong and lightweight body went on to notch up victory after victory against its more powerful rivals and vividly stamped the Mitsubishi name on the world rally scene.\n\nThe second-generation Galant, dubbed the New Galant and Colt was removed from the nameplate, was launched in June 1973. With its bigger body, the New Galant moved its vehicle class. While inheriting the design image of its predecessor, the New Galant incorporated softer, more curvaceous surfaces to give it a milder, more sedan-like flavor. The New Galant's larger body provided more generous interior space as emphasis was placed on comfort to separate it from the Lancer series. The equipment specification included a driver's seat with lumbar support and a tilt-adjust steering column, made it with a fully adjustable driving position. The two-door hardtop and four-door sedan were offered with three engines: a 1.6L , and 1.85L or 2.0L engines which all met the 1973 Japanese emission regulations. Improved aerodynamics and braking performance as well as greater body rigidity and beefed up suspension produced a car that delivered feel-good driving with optimally balanced handling and stability and engine performance. Offering comfort and reassurance underpinned by an impact-absorbing body structure and high safety performance, the New Galant was a model worthy of its \"personal sedan\" moniker.\n\nAs reconstruction efforts following the end of WWII gathered pace in Japan the Jeep became a desirable vehicle for its utility and versatility. However, the government policy for protection of domestic industry in Japan restricted number of built-up vehicles imported into the country.\n\nIn 1952 Shin Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Co. Ltd., which was already producing three-wheel small trucks and scooters, obtained a license from Willys Overland of the United States and started knock-down production of the Jeep in Japan. In 1953, the first Mitsubishi Jeep assembled from knock-down kits, the J1, was completed and the company delivered 54 units to the Forestry Agency. The next year, in July 1954, the company signed technical assistance and marketing agreements as it moved toward domestic production in Japan. Subsequently, the Mitsubishi Jeep came to be offered in a wide variety of body types, including canvas or metal top, delivery wagon and with either gasoline or diesel engines. Approximately 200,000 units of the Mitsubishi Jeep were sold in 45 years, from the first model in 1953 until the final memorial version went on sale as limited edition in June 1998. The Mitsubishi Jeep J-58, launched in 1975, took the canvas top and door body style that was growing in popularity as a recreational vehicle and became the series' first gasoline engine model to be classified with a 4-figure number plate, denoting a light commercial vehicle. It was characterized by sportier and more elegant exterior styling and with a fashionable looking soft top. Power was supplied by a 2.0 L gasoline engine that produced 100PS. Other features included a roll bar for greater safety and ELR seatbelts with tension reducers that stopped the belts from binding too tightly when driving over poor surfaces.\n\nIntroduced as the successor to the Galant Coupe FTO in March 1975, the Lancer Celeste took its place in the lineup as the coupe variant of the first-generation Lancer, the Celeste designation coming from the Latin for blue sky. Addressing consumer demand at the time for convenient and versatile cars, the Lancer Celeste used a hatchback design in which a large rear gate was added to the fastback back-window. The model was distinguished by its beautiful and high-performance styling with its low aerodynamic drag born of numerous wind tunnel evaluations. The roomy trunk space could be expanded into a very spacious compartment with luxurious carpeting by lowering the rear seatback. The Lancer Celeste was first offered with 1.4 L and 1.6 L engines, the 1600 MCL-GL unit having clearing Japan's 1975 emission regulations. On its launch, the synergy between the Lancer's performance in rallies and Lancer Celeste's styling caught the hearts and minds of younger drivers while the practicality of the hatchback gate attracted the family consumer group. In June 1979 the 2.0 L engine was added to the lineup and the compact body-plus-large capacity engine formula saw it gain popularity in the United States, particularly among young women drivers.\n\nFollowing the Galant Æ©, the Galant Î 2-door personal luxury model made its market debut in December 1976. It was given the Î designation because in Greek it corresponds to the letter L which in turn is the first letter in the word \"luxury.\" Described in advertising copy at the time as \"neither a hardtop nor a coupe,\" Galant Î used the same chassis components as the Galant Æ© but was differentiated by its unique styling which used rectangular double headlamps for the first time in Japan, a long slanted nose and a rear window which wrapped round into the body sides. Later a model with a large front bumper and indicator lamps housed in roll bar garnish was added to the lineup. The Galant Î's single spoke steering wheel was not just a case of seeking a unique direction in terms of fashion but also had the function of making the instrumentation easier to see. Initially it was only offered with a 2.0 L engine but 1.6 L and 2.6 L units were added later. Overseas it was sold under the Mitsubishi Sapporo nameplate, the moniker stemming from the fact that the name Sapporo had become known world-wide as the host city of the 1972 Winter Olympic Games held in Hokkaido. The Galant Î advertising used Finnish model and Vogue cover girl Pia-Sofia Kiukkonen as its poster girl - the first time Mitsubishi Motors had used this marketing technique.\n\nThe third-generation Galant was launched in May 1976. It was given the Æ© (sigma) designation because in Greek it means \"summation\" or \"culmination\" and this sedan reflected the zenith in terms of the Mitsubishi Motors' technology devoted to its development. In creating an elegant and dynamic image, the styling employed low wide proportions, a functional airdam skirt and a tumblehome cross-section. A new 4-link with assist link and coil suspension design together with its wide track and precise steering worked together to give the Galant Æ© superior handling and stability. Its engine with Silent Shaft balance technology delivered power smoothly and quietly. In advertising, a cup of water was placed on the engine at 6000 rpm to show how smoothly and vibration-free it ran. Television commercials shot in Utah, America showed it is a world-class vehicle. The Galant Æ© was the first model for which Mitsubishi Motors had used an overseas' location to shoot a TV commercial. Monthly sales volume of the Galant series moved at the 10,000 unit level as it became a popular model on the market.\n\nThe Minicab 5 was launched with only increase in size of engine tentatively up to 471cc reflecting the new K-class standards introduced in 1976, while its vehicle size remained from the previous specification.\n\nTo take full advantage of the new standards, the Minicab Wide 55 was launched just a year later in March 1977. The Minicab Wide 55 was powered by a new 546 cc 4-stroke engine using Mitsubishi Motors' Silent Shaft balance technology to deliver the kind of smooth and gutsy performance normally found in a larger size class of light commercial vehicle. The Minicab Wide 55 used the new K-class standards to the full, bringing in body dimensions of 1395 mm wide and 3195 mm long for the Truck and 3155 mm for the Van body types and with new styling that gave it an assured stable appearance. The Minicab Wide 55 Van responded to the increasing diversification in demand for K-vans with the introduction of a Hi-Roof model in 1980 and the addition of a rear wiper, a tailgate with solenoid locking and other equipment in 1981. With the market now considered to be aware of the model meeting the new K-class standards, Wide 55 was removed from the nameplate and the series reverted to the Minicab name. In 1982, the MCA-Jet engine and a four-wheel drive model were added to the lineup and a silent chain transfer case adopted to drive the front wheels.\n\nThe Minica 5 was launched in April 1976 soon after the introduction the new K-class standards which the industry had been lobbying for because the K-car had come to be re-appraised by the market from the viewpoint of conservation of resources and energy. (The new K-class standards saw an increase in engine size from 360 cc to 550 cc, in overall length from 3.0 m to 3.2 m and in overall width from 1.3 m to 1.4 m). On its launch, the Minica 5 was only able to reflect the change in engine size, being powered by the new 471 cc 4-stroke engine that used Mitsubishi Motors' Silent Shaft balance technology. It was followed just over a year later in June 1977 by the introduction of the fully revised fourth-generation model Minica as the Minica Ami 55, using a body with the full overall width of 1395 mm allowed by the new K-class standards and powered by a new 546 cc 2-cylinder 4-stroke water-cooled engine. A year later in September 1978, this was replaced by the company's lean-burn MCA-Jet emissions control system which both met Japan's 1977 emission regulations and returned fuel consumption of just 22 km/L in Japan's 10-mode driving cycle test. The Minica Ami 55 was 100 mm wider and 45 mm longer than the Minica 5 and as well as a full facelift for front and rear styling came with a \"simple & wide\" 3-door hatchback body. The use of torque-arm rear suspension and Silent Shaft balance technology in the 2-cylinder engine helped the Minica Ami 55 provide a quiet and comfortable ride on a par with a 4-cylinder engine model. The spacious and comfortable interior was coordinated in light trim colors, had a split rear seat that allowed right and left seatbacks to be reclined individually and a ventilation system powerful enough for a compact car.\n\nThe Mirage is a range of car originally developed as a \"world's minimum car,\" sporting Mitsubishi Motors' own styling and incorporating the company's wealth of technological prowess as a response to the global call for greater conservation of resources and better fuel economy after the first oil crisis in 1973. The model name was announced in time for the Tokyo Motor Show in October 1977. It was launched in March 1978 for sale exclusively through the newly established \"Car Plaza\" sales channel. The Mirage name derives from the French \"mirage\" meaning, alternately, mystical, romantic and mirage (as in desert mirage). In overseas markets it was sold under the Colt nameplate. The body design was developed around a stable trapezoidal shape and featured a low-drag slant nose and flush surface panels. The use of jumbo-size doors, narrow pillars and a large glazing area gave the Mirage a very bright and comfortable interior. As Mitsubishi Motors' first front-engine/ front-drive model, an \"idle\" transfer shaft and reverse rotation gear had to be fitted for the rear-drive engine to be positioned transversely. Using this as an auxiliary transmission saw the debut of the Super Shift transmission, which had a secondary shift level that allowed the driver to change between Power and Economy ranges to give high performance and low fuel consumption. The Mirage had independent suspension all round, using a new U-type multi-link arrangement at the rear. A 4-door hatchback model was added to the lineup in 1978, followed by 1.6 L and 3-speed AT models in 1979. Joining the lineup in 1982 were a 4-door sedan named Mirage II, powered by a 1.4 L turbo engine, and the Modulated Displacement (MD) engine that switched from 4- to 2-cylinder operation at low engine loads. This engine boasted a Japan 10-mode driving cycle consumption of 20 km/L.\n\nDemand for small pickup trucks was high as they were commonly used for commuting, running children to and from school and recreational purposes, in North America in the 1970s. Mitsubishi Motors entered the pickup market with the Mitsubishi Forte launched in September 1978. Exports to North America went into full swing in October of the same year. Named from the Italian word for \"strong\", the one-ton pickup Forte was put through extensive durability testing in North America, Thailand and Saudi Arabia during development to ensure that it lived up to its name. The Forte's styling was based on that of the Galant Æ© Eterna and featured a long nose, an airdam skirt (a first on a Japanese pickup) and twin round headlamps. Powered by a 1.6L engine and with its 1360 mm front track and 2780 mm wheelbase, the Forte delivered superior driving stability. Suspension was by double wishbone with coil at the front and by leaf spring with rigid axle at the rear. Disc brakes were fitted at the front. A four-wheel drive model was added in October 1980, using a part-time direct drive silent chain transfer case developed by the company using its many years of experience in producing the Mitsubishi Jeep. This arrangement solved the problem of gear noise and power loss making it suitable for on-road driving at high speeds. The four wheel drive Mitsubishi Forte was the trailblazer for the Pajero (Montero, Shogun), Delica 4WD and other 4x4 models in the Mitsubishi lineup.\n\nThe second-generation Delica went on sale in June 1979 after its first full model change in 11 years. Van and truck variants were joined by the 9-seat Delica Star Wagon powered by a MCA-JET engine that complied with Japan's 1978 emission regulations. Subsequently hi-roof variants of the van and wagon types were added in May 1980, while in September 1981 a wagon with automatic transmission joined the lineup. This was followed by four wheel drive, long body and diesel powered variants in October 1982. The extensive range of models brought an increase in sales volume and in segment share. The Delica Star Wagon enjoyed growing popularity as its overall width was stretched to the limit dictated by Japanese regulations for compact cars to offer a very roomy interior space, full fold-flat seats in the second and third rows, a clean and linear boxy design, comfortable ride quality, easy-to-drive handling and stability, and rigidly. The four-wheel drive model that joined the lineup on October 1982 was Japan's first four wheel one-box wagon and employed a full-feature four-wheel driveline. The grille guard that provided additional front end protection fitted the overall design neatly and with its tall stance Delica Star Wagon 4WD made a strong impact on the market and helped creating consumer perception that the Delica meant 4WD.\n\nThe second-generation Lancer was developed to an \"optimized size, optimized quality\" concept and launched in April 1979. It was given the EX designation, for Exceed, to signify that it literally went beyond conventional models in its class. With clean styling composed of straight lines and flat surfaces, the Lancer EX used a hexagonal body cross-section that gave it larger windows and more interior space. It was initially offered with MCA-JET system engines. Also new was the 4-link rear suspension and more responsive steering. In October 1981, an 1.8L turbo model, later to be affectionately known as the \"LanTurbo\", was introduced. Using an engine with electronically controlled fuel injection and a TC05 turbocharger made by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, this high-performance model developed 135 PS and accelerated from 0 to 400 m in 16.0 seconds. The stripe on the oversize front airdam skirt bore the letters TURBO in mirror writing that the driver in front would read the right way round in their rearview mirror as the Lancer EX Turbo closed in from behind.\n\nIn May 1980, the New Galant Î£, New Eterna Î£, New Galant Î and New Eterna Îwere all launched at the same time. They had been developed as \"sedan/coupe with worldwide currency,\" offering low fuel consumption, high performance, comfort and high quality. They were powered by new gasoline and dieselturbo engines; the Î£s using 1.6L, 1.8L, 2.0L gasoline and 2.3L dieselturbo units; the Îs by 1.8L, 2.0L, 2.6L gasoline and 2.3L dieselturbo units. Other features new to the two series were the VELNAS electronic driving information display system which included the first instant fuel consumption readout on a Japanese car, automatic climate control and cruise control. With an eye on markets overseas, the interior provided 50 mm more leg room to comfortably accommodate the larger European and American users. The dieselturbo engine used Mitsubishi Motors' first turbocharger, and six months later a gasoline turbo engine model was added to the lineup. The 2000GSR performance variant had electronic fuel injection using Mitsubishi's own Karman vortex airflow sensor, a new independent suspension design, disc brakes all round, and a steering gear box with three-point mounting.\n\nWith demand for K-cars growing rapidly, Mitsubishi Motors developed the fifth iteration Minica series in response to the call for more modern styling, better fuel consumption, easier handling and better interior comfort. The Minica Ami L was introduced in September 1981, now sporting the maximum 3195 mm overall length permitted by the regulations, 100 mm more than its predecessor the Ami 55, and with the wheelbase extended by 50 mm to 2050 mm. Around this time, K-vans styled to look like passenger models ignited an explosive boom in sales because K-van classification meant lower vehicle taxes. In response to this, Mitsubishi Motors launched at the same time as the Ami L a bonnet-type van which shared the Ami L's body, calling it the Minica Econo. The new Minica series was characterized by elegant styling that used rectangular headlamps and oversize plastic bumpers and was powered by the 2-cylinder 4-stroke water-cooled engine with Silent Shaft balance technology. An automatic transmission was available on all models for the first time. March 1983 saw the addition of the Minica Ami L Turbo, the first turbocharged K-car in Japan, boasting a power output of 39 PS.\n\nAs private ownership of cars in Japan was advancing its state of maturity in the late 1970s and accompanied by the call for conservation of resources and energy, requirements for compact and mid-sized cars became more diverse. Mitsubishi Motors had already brought out the Galant, Lancer and Mirage series which addressed these needs and in March 1982 added to its product lineup the Tredia 4-door sedan and the Cordia 2-door coupe, both front-engine / front-drive (FWD) cars. Mitsubishi Motors' second FWD models were developed to a concept of providing a roomy interior within compact exterior lines and of reducing vehicle weight. Their innovative styling was designed to reduce aerodynamic drag to the minimum using a wedged shape, flush surfaces and even concealed lip rain moldings which ran inboard the roof edge. They were powered by 1.6 L turbo engine (115 PS) and were offered with the electronically controlled automatic transmission or the two-range Super Shift manual transmission that was proving popular in the Mirage series. The Cordia Turbo trim level sported LED instrumentation with easily legible and elegant color digital readouts.\n\nThe Starion is Mitsubishi Motors' fourth sports model, following the Galant GTO, Galant FTO and Lancer Celeste. It was launched in May 1982 the Starion was designed wedge-shaped with slant nose and short ducktail proportions. Styling elements giving emphasis to its specialty model looks included an oversize integral front bumper, wide center pillars and the clean surface composition stemming from the use of large full doors. It was powered by a 2.0L turbo engine. The careful attention given to safety and ride comfort at higher speed can be seen in its specification which included ventilated disc brakes all round, strut independent rear suspension, high caster angle and low mechanical trail as well as zero camber front suspension. During the life of the series, a 175 PS intercooled turbo model was introduced in June 1983, a 200PS engine model was added in June 1984, a wide body with flared wheel arches model for the American market joined the lineup in February 1987 and a 2.6L engine model came to market in Japan in April 1988. The Starion chalked up noteworthy results in endurance races and rallies, and a 4WD prototype was built and tested.\n\nMitsubishi Motors was unable to export the Mitsubishi Jeep to full-feature four-wheel drive markets overseas because of its license agreement with Willys at a time when its rivals were expanding their market share. In Japan, meanwhile, the forecast was that demand for four-wheel drive vehicles would grow as private owners sought them for leisure use and that the time was ripe for the company to develop its own four-wheel drive technology. The result was the birth of the full- feature four-wheel drive Pajero (Montero, Shogun) brimming with Mitsubishi-ness. It was named after the Leopardus pajeros or Pampus cat that inhabits the Patagonian plateau at the southern end of South America, shared by Argentina and Chile, and reflects the company's wish to achieve in the car a harmony between \"taste of the wild\" and \"beauty\". The first Pajero, was well received when shown as a concept at the 1979 Tokyo Motor Show and in 1982 metal and canvas top variants of the 3-door short body model were brought to market. A long-body variant was added in July 1983. The lineup was joined by a model using Mitsubishi's own automatic transmission in 1985 while V6 gasoline and intercooled dieselturbo engines were added in 1988. In the meantime, the underpinnings were improved with the original leaf spring rear suspension being replaced by a 3-link with coil arrangement to give further polish to the Pajero's distinguishing characteristic of delivering outstanding all-terrain performance while also providing passenger car-like drivability. The Pajero won the Unmodified 4WD Production Class of the Paris-Dakar Rally, renowned as the world's toughest motorsport event, in 1983 at its first attempt. The Pajero won the first overall victory in 1985 and took the victory for 12 times thereafter. Since it has been a prime mover in spawning and growing the recreation and 4WD vehicle boom and has built up the solid position, it enjoys today in the 4WD / SUV category.\n\nLaunched in September 1983, the fifth-generation Galant was developed to a design brief of creating \"a new-age sedan that employs new concepts to deliver high levels of comfort and satisfaction\". The biggest change in the new series was the switch to a front-engine/front- drive layout, this realizing a roomier interior living space and trunk. The FWD layout was adopted for the first time with the Galant series. The exterior was distinguished by its novel wedge shape developed using Mitsubishi's extensive aerodynamics technology and knowhow and which realized class-leading low-drag performance as well as contributing to interior roominess. The range was powered by a new series of 1.8L/2.0L turbo engines and 1.8L/2.0L NA engines. With the NA engines, an electro-carburetor was used which controlled the air-fuel ratio electronically to deliver high output while returning excellent fuel economy. The Galant saw the extensive application of electronics: the ELC automatic transmission for improved fuel consumption; electric controlled suspension for proving both driving comfort and stability; and electric powered steering.\n\nIn March 1984, the addition of 1.6L gasoline and 1.8L dieselturbo engines broadened the target consumer group. And May of the same year saw the introduction of the 200PS engine featuring a 3x 2 valvetrain that used different inlet valve diameters for low and high engine speeds. When Mitsubishi Motors Australia geared up to produce the new FWD Galant, the body was widened by 65 mm and the model was renamed the Magna.\n\nThe second-generation Mirage was launched in October 1983. In a full model change, the forward-looking design of its predecessor was replaced by smoother edges inspired by an egg, giving the model unique styling together with outstanding aerodynamics.\n\nThe model saw significant improvements in practicality as its extensive glazing area gave the driver a better field of view.\n\nThe extensive Mirage range addressed both performance and fuel economy requirements being offered with a number of engine types including a 1.6L turbo, a 1.8L diesel and a 1.5L MD \"modulated displacement\" unit employing a system which ran on 4 cylinders when power was required and on two cylinders when cruising or idling to reduce fuel consumption. Mirage also catered to different user needs and tastes with three body types: 3- and 5-door hatchbacks and a 4-door sedan. Equipment and trim features included LED instrumentation as well as an AM/FM radio receiver with digital wavelength display and a heater unit that automatically kept the cabin at a comfortable temperature, both class firsts. The 3-door variant of the Mirage NOW debuted in 1986 which attracted much attention with F.A.Porsche Design steering wheel and alloy road wheels.\n\nWhen Mitsubishi Motors showed the Mitsubishi SSW (Super Space Wagon) front-engine/ front-drive 7-seats in 3 rows concept car as a show model at the 1979 Tokyo Motor Show it stirred a lot of interest. This persuaded the company to launch in February 1983 the first-generation Chariot which would one of the pioneers of three-row minivans. The Chariot was slightly larger than the SSW and combined sedan-like drivability with the superior interior space of a cab-over wagon. The name was taken from the French for the two-wheel chariots used in ancient Greece to indicate that the Chariot was a car that sported high mobility and displayed the pride shown by those warriors. Maximizing the open and airy interior, the Chariot offered a number of seating arrangements including one in which a mechanism allowed the 2-row seatbacks to be rotated in direction so that they faced the 3rd row seats. Both 2nd and 3rd row seats could also be folded flat. Optionally available was an overhead audio system and these and other novel ideas ideally suited a car which was creating a new genre. The 2.0L model added in June 1984 used a part-time four-wheel driveline with a push-button selector making it a simple task to change between two-wheel drive and four-wheel drive. Later that year in October, the series was joined by a dieselturbo engine model and in November by the Chariot Los Andes with a full-feature ski specification. The Chariot was offered in a wide range of specifications fitting to its multi-purpose qualities.\n\nGalant Î£ (Sigma) Hardtop and Eterna Î£ Hardtop debuted in October 1984 as Mitsubishi Motors' first 4-door hardtop models following the company's decision to discontinue the Galant Î (Lambda) and Eterna Î. The hardtop models were offered with two engines: a 2.0 L turbo and the 200PS intercooled turbo with a 3x2 valvetrain that had two inlet valves and one exhaust valve per cylinder. They were also fitted with ECS electronic suspension and EPS electronic power steering. The stylish wedged-shape body design extended flush surface treatment to minimize wind noise. The cockpit was distinguished by the use of \"wing\" stalk levers on the steering column and a redesigned instrumentation cluster. Top trim levels were equipped with steering wheel audio controls as well as a 9-way adjustable driverâs seat to elevate the high-grade image at the same time as enhancing functionality. In October 1986, 2.0L V6 models were added to the hardtop as well as to the Galant Î£ and Eterna Î£ sedan lineups.\n\nThe K-cars came to be reevaluated in the early 1980s for their economic benefits and the market was looking for more attractive styling, roomier interiors and better road performance. To address these requirements, the sixth-generation Minica was launched in February 1984 with a front-engine/front-drive layout - a major transformation. The FWD layout with longer wheelbase gave the new model the roomiest living space and largest luggage space in its class, both bordering on those of a 1-liter car. The company dubbed the exterior design \"Sneaker-look Styling\" as one of its unique selling points. This was the first model in the Minica series with a 5-door body and it also established the MacPherson strut front and 3-link rear suspension design that would be used on future generations. The Minica was powered by the new high output, low consumption and quiet 2-cylinder engine and, in a class first, an intercooled turbo model joined the lineup. A part-time four wheel drive model was added in September 1985 and an open top variant in April 1986. The Minica range was joined by a new 3-cylinder engine, 3-speed automatic transmission and full-time 4WD models in 1987. Amistar, Parsely and Marie trim levels were introduced in response to the popularity the sixth-generation Minica enjoyed among female consumers and total production topped 820,000 units.\n\nThere was significant diversification in demand for the commercial K-car Minicab at the beginning of the 1980s as the market looked for more attractive styling, roomier interiors and better road performance. In response, Mitsubishi Motors introduced the fourth-generation Minicab in June 1984, its first full model change in seven years. The new Minicab models came, as might be expected, with significantly improved practical functionality as a commercial K-car. The Minicab Van in particular was developed as a one-box K-car with a distinct minivan flavor that provided a comfortable and pleasant driving experience for leisure purposes, as well as satisfying commercial use requirements. Design features included a large glazing area, bonded windshield and rectangular headlamps, while the Estate variant was available with a class-first power sliding glass sunroof and had flat folding seats. The lineup included models powered by the new engine as well as a part-time 4WD model with freewheeling hubs which improved running performance and noise levels. The larger interior featured seat slide adjustment for the driver, a class-first tilt-adjust steering column and an air-mix heater for easy-to-drive and occupant comfort. The lineup was joined in 1987 by the supercharger while in 1989; the Minicab Bravo replaced the Estate as the top-end trim level. The Bravo series included a hydraulic coupling full-time four-wheel drive model, and the Super Aero Roof model which sported a glass sunroof with glasses on front and sides of the roof, an oversize bumper, and other aero parts.\n\nThe Mirage Wagon launched in February 1985 was the first station wagon in the Mirage series. Its twin Lancer Wagon was introduced. Distinguished by its original two-step roof, Mirage Wagon delivered high levels of fuel economy, practical utility and handling. The 1500 CX trim level was fitted as standard with a double sunroof, a first in its class. Rearward of the fixed glass panel over the front seats was a power-operated panel over the rear seats. Together with its two-step roof, these panels created a very open and airy feel to the interior. The 87PS 1.5L engine with an electronic carburetor optimized the air-fuel mixture for different loads and driving conditions, and the 65 PS 1.8L diesel engine with a Super Quick Glow system made it as easy to start as a gasoline engine. The rear seats were moved back to provide more room and leg space, making the Mirage Wagon an attractive car for the way in which it fused station wagon functionality with a well-defined personality. Mitsubishi Motors' first full time 4WD with center differential model was added in 1986.\n\nThe Debonair V was launched in August 1986 as a front-engine/front-drive luxury personal sedan after the first full model change in 22 years. Taking the V from VIP, no effort was spared in creating a mainstream luxury sedan to serve as the company's top-end model. Defined by orthodox and flavored with a modern taste of chic, its styling gave the car a marked road presence. Four coats of color paint, each individually baked, gave the body a high gloss finish. It was powered by a new V6 engine with a super-fast intake system utilizing the intake air momentum, a high-squish and compact combustion chamber design and a dual exhaust system that eliminated interference and increased exhaust gas speed. The ECI-MULTI high-performance injection system contributed to outstanding performance particularly at low- and mid-engine speeds. With its new FWD layout, the car delivered responsive and reassuring performance with comfortable cruising guaranteed. Befitting its luxury sedan status, a number of original items were developed for the equipment specification. The Debonair V was the first Japanese car to use a \"high tilt\" steering column that tilted up when the door was opened to facilitate driver entry and exit. Pressing in the cigar lighter activated an exhaust fan in the dual climate control system to automatically vent cigarette smoke from the car. Among other features that defined it as a luxury personal sedan, the Debonair V was also the first Japanese car to be available with a hands-free car telephone system. The lineup included a 3000 Royal AMG performance model tuned in a tie-up with the German tuning company AMG.\n\nIn June 1986 the Delica series underwent its third full model change, the first in seven years. When development work on the third-generation series began in the spring of 1983 there was a proposal to create a semi-cab-over engine body which would improve impact safety and allow a walk-through but the design team eventually decided to retain the full cab-over-engine configuration of the previous generations for its superior space efficiency. The new Delica Star Wagon's monocoque body structure was chosen for its safety and durability. The more rounded \"soft cube\" styling put the emphasis on space efficiency. To a \"Living room on wheels\" theme, Delica Star Wagon was fitted with multi-seat, multi-audio and multi-climate control systems and was available with the first Crystal Lite Roof in its class, enhancing further the light, airy and open ambience to the interior. The 2.0 L engine and 2.5 L dieselturbo engine delivered brisk and feel-good performance both on and off road. The Delica Star Wagon 4WD featured an upgraded equipment specification worthy of its status as the series' image leader. To firmly establish its position as the leading cab-over four-wheel drive engine in its category, Delica Star Wagon 4WD sported full-feature off-road performance together with improved comfort. In August 1988 an automatic transmission trim level was added to the four-wheel drive lineup.\n\nLaunched in 1987, the sixth-generation Galant was developed as a car that \"answers the needs and requirements of those who have a clearly defined sense of values and who seek the genuine article\". \"An individual 4-door\" was the catchphrase used in advertising. Its muscular organic form crafted from a âreverse-slant noseâ, tall stance and body sides which undulated like a wave from top to bottom really stood out among the low and wide proportions that were the fashion at the time. Using the latest in automotive technology, the four-wheel drive model's \"Active Four\" component systems referred to its 4-valve DOHC engine, fulltime four-wheel drive with viscous coupling center differential, 4-wheel independent suspension, 4-wheel steering and 4-wheel ABS. Two-wheel drive models were fitted with active Electronically Controlled Suspension (ECS) that kept the body virtually horizontal to the road surface. This generation won Mitsubishi Motors its first Car of the Year Japan award. A Group A rally car developed from the high-performance Galant VR-4 four-wheel drive variant powered by an intercooled turbo engine won overall honors in the 1989 WRC 1000 Lakes Rally, the first WRC victory for the company since the Lancer first won the Safari Rally in 1974 and again in 1976. In 1989 the lineup was joined by the Galant AMG, with modifications by German tuning company AMG. Across the history of the Galant, the sixth-generation best expresses the essence of what a Galant is meant to be.\n\nThe third-generation Mirage launched in October 1987 was available initially only as a 3-door hatchback with a four-variant lineup bearing Fabio, aimed very much at the female owner, Swift, Cyborg and XYVYX variant names to distinguish their different personalities. Both the Cyborg, with its 145 PS 1.6L DOHC turbo engine, and the two-seat XYVYX, with blanked out rear windows, stood out from the crowd. They used dual-mode suspension that allowed the driver to change stabilizer and damper characteristics at the same time. A comprehensive range of easy-to-use equipment choices included so-called \"chameleon\" instrument cluster with graphics that changed color from day to night, double-action folding rear seats, tilt-adjust/telescopic steering column and uphill start assist. In January 1988, the 4-door sedan range also underwent a full model change to a \"high-quality sedan for the style-conscious adult\" theme. This series also used personality distinguishing variant names including Vie, Fabio and Cyborg. With a 70 mm longer wheelbase and 25 mm taller overall height, the 4-door sedan range offered a roomier living space. New to the lineup were a diesel engine model, and a fulltime 4WD with viscous coupling center differential.\n\nThe 5-door hatchback Lancer launched in June 1988 was the successor to the model sold as the Lancer EX and the Lancer Fiore in Japan. While presenting a three-box silhouette distinguished by its 3-dimensional wrap around rear window, the Lancer was in fact a 5-door hatchback sedan in which the large trunk lid and rear window opened together. The engine lineup comprised five units: 1.3L, 1.5L, 1.6L DOHC, 1.6L DOHC turbo and 1.8L diesel. Though derived from the Mirage body, the Lancer had attractive exclusive body lines similar to the styling language employed on the Galant. True to its âactive sedanâ development theme, the Lancer was equipped with many high-performance and high-function features including: a 145PS 1.6 L intercooled turbo engine, full-time four-wheel drive with viscous coupling center differential, dual-mode suspension that allowed the driver to switch between a handling/stability bias and ride comfort, as well as split double-action rear seats that folded down to produce a flat surface into the trunk. The Lancer also adopted measures to prevent the driver-induced misoperation problems affecting automatic transmission that had become a social issue from around 1987 and included an ignition key interlock, a shift lock button and a \"reverse selected\" audible alert.\n\nMitsubishi Motors developed a new sporty and elegant \"lite\" 4-door sedan to join the sixth-generation Galant and Eterna and better meet the increasing individualization and diversification among mid-sized sedan owners. The Eterna Sava came to market in October 1989 with a variant name reflecting the casual nature of the French greeting \"ca va?\" A stylish 4-door sedan derived from the Galant was distinguished by the treatment of the trailing edge of the roof and the more gently slanted C-pillars. Inside, the Eterna Sava presented a chic and elegant living space that was dressed in a darkish color scheme counterpointed by light colored seat fabric. The main force of the model was powered by a 1.8 L engine but the lineup included a full-time four-wheel drive variant with a four-wheel steering to deliver stable and well-balanced road behavior. The comprehensive equipment specification included fully automatic climate control, power steering and windows, central door locking and a stereo audio system as standard. Presenting itself as great value for money, the Eterna Sava met the needs of a wide spectrum of owners.\n\nThe seventh-generation Minica was launched in January 1989 after a development process that involved styling input by 350 Mitsubishi female employees and other opinion holders as the design team targeted the female owners who accounted for over 60 percent of the K-car market. The result was a body with rounder, cuter and more modern styling distinguished by its large rear gate glazing which wrapped up into the roof. Joining the new 3- and 5-door lineup, the \"1:2-door\" model that gave shape to the wish for better safety by providing a rear door on the passenger side only to prevent child occupants jumping out into the road. Other features assuring safety included class-first cornering lamps. Later the Minica Dangan performance model powered by the world's first DOHC 5-valve with four-wheel car and intercooled turbo engine (64PS), was added to the lineup. The range was also joined by several models boasting cutting-edge technologies, including fulltime four-wheel drive with Hydraulic Coupling Uint , as well as electronically controlled power steering. In January 1990 K-car regulations were changed allowing a 100 mm increase in overall length and a 110 cc increase in engine displacement. The company launched a new Minica in March 1990 to take advantage of these changes, with a 70 mm increase in body length and 30 mm increase in bumper length for a 100 mm increase in overall length to give improved safety as well as interior and luggage space. The new Minica was powered by the same 3-cylinder engine but with bored out cylinders and a longer stroke to increase displacement to 660 cc and delivered performance on a par with a compact class car. The Dangan DOHC intercooled turbo model was registered under the new regulations in August of the same year.\n\nThe market for Japanese luxury cars took off after a revision to the tax system in April 1989 when commodity tax was abolished and changes made to the vehicle tax, as well as after revisions to the voluntary insurance system for private cars. Accurately pinpointing these market trends the Diamante 4-door hardtop which came to market in May 1990 is notable for having created the 2.5 L segment. With its wide body taking it out of the mid-sized car bracket Diamante's form gave it an imposing road presence and a subtle profundity that would not have been possible in the mid-sized car category. Its sizable living space stemming from the wide body featured wrap around cockpit styling and seats designed to support the occupant's center of gravity. All models in the range were powered by V6 engines with electrically controlled variable inlet valve system. 4-wheel drive models were fitted with Mitsubishi Motors' Active Four system: fulltime 4-wheel drive, 4-wheel steering, 4-wheel ABS and 4-wheel independent suspension. 2-wheel drive models were fitted with the Traction control system as well as the Active Two system: active electronically controlled suspension, 4-wheel steering, 4-wheel ABS and 4-wheel independent suspension. These systems helped deliver confidence-inspiring driving dynamics. Diamante also showcased a number of cutting-edge technologies including the MICS Mitsubishi Integrated Communications System, a world-first, that automatically adjusted seat, steering wheel and other positions to match the driver and his preferences. In November that year, a new Sigma 4-door sedan, derived from the Diamante but giving greater priority to interior comfort, was launched. Three years after the Galant, Diamante and Sigma won the Car of the Year Japan award for 1990-1991.\n\nLaunched in October 1990, the GTO came into being as a new-age super four-wheel drive sports car. The model was powered by a new 280PS 3.0 L V6 intercooled twin-turbo engine and naturally aspirated (NA) engine which used an electronically controlled variable inlet valve system. Twin-turbo engine variant used a Getrag 5-speed manual transmission The GTO delivered superb handling and stability thanks to a fulltime four-wheel drive driveline using a viscous coupling center differential to transmit all the engine torque to the road surface with a front-rear torque split of 45:55; MacPherson strut suspension at the front with a double wishbone arrangement at the rear; electronically controlled suspension which adjusted damping rates as required; and four-wheel steering system to operate rear wheels in the same direction as the front wheel at mid- to high-speed . Notable equipment features included an Active Aero System which automatically operates a front venturi cover and a variable rear spoiler while driving at high speed, as well as an Active Exhaust System which at the touch of a button switched the exhaust gas routing to the silencer for either a louder or quieter exhaust note.\n\nIn January 1990, regulations governing the K-car were revised, increasing the permitted size of engine from 550 cc to 660 cc and the overall length from 3.2 m to 3.3 m. Both to take advantage of the new regulations and to meet the ongoing diversification in K-car user needs, Mitsubishi Motors developed the Minica Toppo model that was the precursor to a totally new \"height wagon\" body style. Launched in March 1990 at the same time as the new regulation compliant Minica, the Minica Toppo was developed to a \"DIY Fun Box\" theme. The Minica Toppo gave shape to ways of enjoying the vehicle not seen before providing drivability and comfort of a bonnet-type model, cargo capacity of a one-box model, as well as asymmetric front door size with the driver's door smaller than the front passenger's door for easier access to the rear seats. The new model also sported a number of novel interior equipment features as seen in the overhead shelf for small item storage in its roomy cabin. The tailgate used vertically located hinges and could be opened fully even with long items on the roof carrier while a small glass hatch facilitated the loading of small items. A number of specially equipped variant were built with the model, which included parcel and chilled foodstuff delivery vans for commercial use while the Marble variant featured a specification designed for mothers with babies or young children.\n\nThe fifth iteration of the Lancer series was launched in October 1991 with a brand new body, engine, suspension and other major components. Developed to maximize basic vehicular performance and with a much improved functional equipment specification, the new Lancer sported its own exclusive design that bore nothing in common with the Mirage and its \"basic car for the new age\" environmental and safety orientation. The aim with the Lancer was to create a high-density interior space for an orthodox sedan, and to that end the car was lengthened while the front overhang was trimmed to produce a longer wheelbase and rear overhang. This, together with a wider body, resulted in a spacious interior. Among other elements, the styling used stout and rigid-looking pillars to give expression to the car's road performance and strength. The extensive engine lineup included the world's smallest V6, a 1.6L unit, the super low-consumption 1.5L Mitsubishi Vertical Vortex (MVV), 1.5L and 1.6L DOHCs and a 1.8L intercooled dieselturbo engine. Suspension was by the subframe design MacPherson strut at the front and by a new design multi-link arrangement at the rear. Four-wheel drive models employed a viscous coupling center differential driveline. The wide track, long wheelbase and rigid body delivered outstanding handling, stability and ride quality. The fifth-generation Lancer formed the base model for the Lancer Evolution series that went on to stamp its name so firmly in the history of the World Rally Championship.\n\nIn a full model change and sporting a rounder body shape and new-taste styling, the fourth-generation Mirage was introduced in October 1991. Developed to a \"Basic Car for the New Age\" theme, the new Mirage came with its own all-new body, engine and chassis. The lineup initially comprised two variants each with its own distinctive styling: a \"Chic urban sporty\" 3-door and an \"Elegant 6-light sedan\" 4-door. Highly-density packaging saw a significant improvement in interior space. The extensive engine lineup included the world's smallest V6 engine, a 1.6L unit, as well as super-low consumption 1.5L Mitsubishi Vertical Vortex (MVV), 1.5L DOHC and 1.8L dieselturbo units. The range rode on a new multi-link design rear suspension. Active safety systems included traction control (TCL) that helps controlling traction in a corner when throttle input is mismatched to road surface conditions, while anti-lock braking (ABS) was available. The lineup was joined in May 1993 by the Mirage Asti 2-door coupe variant with a standard equipment specification that included climate control, power steering, power windows, central locking and keyless entry at an affordable price. It was powered by 1.3L and a 1.5L DOHC engines.\n\nThe 1990s were said to be a decade in which the Japanese enjoyed spiritual happiness and their leisure time. The diversification in how people saw their lives and in the way they spent their leisure time saw major changes in their motoring needs and requirements. This created a new market segment for those seeking a sedan-like quality and versatility that differed from that offered by RVs and station wagons but for whom the conventional sedan failed to satisfy their needs in terms of interior space, functionality or utility. After a full model change developed to pinpoint such market needs, the second-generation Chariot was launched in May 1991 offering \"more freedom than a sedan, and more versatility than a station wagon \". While retaining its predecessor's 3-row seating layout, the new Chariot's semi-tall cabin and extended wheelbase created a roomy interior space offering more comfortable accommodation for seven people than its predecessor. The Chariot also featured an improved equipment and trim specification with high quality fabric upholstery for the seats that provided over 12 different seating patterns, no less than 10 small-item storage spaces and a high airflow ventilation system. The two-tone exterior sported \"double cabin\" styling divided by the C-pillar. The 2.0 L engine gave the Chariot comfortable performance even with a full complement of passengers.\n\nPajero (Montero, Shogun) was launched in January 1991 after the full model change in nine years. The first-generation Pajero had enjoyed wide-reaching popularly both in Japan and other markets as a full-feature four-wheel drive vehicle delivering all-terrain capabilities while also integrating the more urban amenities of a passenger car. The Pajero was offered in four body types - metal top, mid-roof, kickup roof, J-top - to accommodate diversifying user needs and brought significant improvements in performance, comfort and safety. It was powered by uprated 3.0 L V6 and 2.5L intercooled dieselturbo engines mated to either 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmissions.\n\nIn terms of functional components, the Pajero saw the introduction of the world-first Super Select 4WD that delivered the benefits of both full- and part-time four-wheel drive by allowing the driver to switch between 2WD and 4WD modes while on the move at speeds under 100 km/h. This system was joined by Multi-mode ABS which responded to all Super Select 4WD modes. In July 1993, new 3.5L V6 and 2.8L intercooled dieselturbo engines were added to the lineup. In May 1997, the Pajero Wide models were fitted with wheel arch and a new high-efficiency 3.5L V6 GDI engine joined the lineup. In September of that year, the company introduced the Pajero Evolution in response to changes in entry requirements for the Paris-Dakar Rally. Powered by the high-performance 3.5L V6 GDI MIVEC engine, with a more rigid and lightweight body, increased width with the use of over fenders and with all-round independent suspension, the Pajero Evolution combined all-terrain capability with on-road comfort.\n\nAccompanying the growth in demand for recreational vehicle (RV) type models such as the Delica, Pajero (Montero, Shogun) and Chariot was a diversification in the needs and requirements of those buying them. Launched in February 1991, the RVR was developed along similar lines to the Pajero but with the aim of replacing the full-feature SUV's \"heavy-duty\" character with a much lighter persona. The intention behind tagging Runner to RV in the model name was to indicate that it was a RV type model with outstanding and passenger-friendly driving dynamics. Its 2.0 L DOHC engine and fulltime four-wheel driveline delivered solid and comfortable on- and off-road performance. The RVR also boasted a new approach to packaging with its short-nose/tall-cabin minivan proportions providing outstanding space utility. The floor from the rear seat passengers' feet back is totally flat. In addition, the rear seats have split-back, tumble, and full-recline features which enable a variety of seat arrangements. Together with the 300mm travel long slide rear seats and the sliding leftside rear door, these features create an interior which offers high flexibility in the ways it may be arranged to suit different situations.\n\nOctober 1992 saw the launch of the RVR Sport Gear with a strong 4WD cross-country bias as seen in its oversize grille guard, alloy skid plates, wide fenders, side steps and oversize rear bumper. This was followed in August 1993 by the RVR Open Gear that featured a power-operated roof and attracted much interest for adding an open car flavor to the RV type genre.\n\nThe Minicab Bravo was originally introduced in January 1989, replacing the Minicab Estate. Undergoing a model change when the fifth-generation Minicab series was launched in January 1991, the new Bravo dropped the Minicab name to become an independent series. Demand for cab-over K-car vehicles among private users had grown sharply since the late 1970s and sales grew firmly as owners with young families began using them for leisure and everyday purposes. Reborn to meet this demand, the Bravo sported vibrant and lively \"Aero Spindle Shape\" styling which took its cue from the shape of a water droplet. The Bravo boasted a comprehensive functional equipment specification with a number of novel features including: a tilt-up front glass roof and an outer panel sliding rear glass roof; power-operated Super Aero Roof; the Super Arrangement Seating comprising a front passenger seat that could be swung round to face the rear seats and double-cushion rear seats; and a retractable and illuminated rear step that facilitated access to the rear seats. The engine lineup included a new 4-valve unit as well as the 5-valve DOHC intercooled turbo engine that was finding much favor in the Minica series among more performance-oriented owners. Hydraulic control unit-type fulltime 4WD was mated with a class-first 2-mode 3-speed automatic transmission for the ultimate in user-friendly performance.\n\nThe fifth-generation Minicab Van and Minicab Truck series appeared in January 1991 after their first full model change in six years. The overall development concept for the latest Minicab series was \"Easy + Quality\": Minicab Van to be an \"easy commercial vehicle that made business easier and more fulfilling\"; Minicab Truck to be an \"easy commercial vehicle that made work easier and more pleasant\". The Minicab series used styling that projected a functional, gutsy image while taking advantage of the larger body under the new size standards to enlarge the cab (Van 70mm longer, Truck 90mm) and extend the wheelbase (Van 140mm longer, Truck 50mm), bringing improved interior space, payload capacity, cab access, ride quality and safety. The new series also featured upgraded functional and equipment specifications, including class-first hydraulic power steering, making them more comfortable and user-friendly. The larger body made for larger door openings, while the Minicab Van became the first in its class to use a retractable rear step. With the Minicab Truck, the height of the cargo bed from the ground was lowered and the model was fitted with a function to lower the bed itself by 80mm, facilitating access and loading work. 4WD models used a new part-time four-wheel drive system which, with an auto freewheeling unit, provided better practical utility by allowing drive to be switch between two-wheel drive and four-wheel drive while moving.\n\nThe seventh-generation Galant went on sale in May 1992 as did the new Eterna series after a full model change. With wide body, low center of gravity silhouette and dynamic and progressive \"gentle wedge shape\" styling, the overall width of 1730mm took the new Galant into the Japanese standard-size body dimensions classification. Overall length and width dimensions were fixed after the decision to use a 1500mm-plus track and a long 2635mm wheelbase. 35mm wider than its predecessor, the Galant provided one of the largest cabin spaces in its class. The new model was the first front-engine/front-drive car to use multi-link suspension all round and combined with its wide track and long wheelbase this delivered high levels of handling/vehicle stability and ride comfort. All models in the range were powered by a new engine series led by 1.8L and 2.0L V6 units. Underpinned by its high levels of basic vehicle performance, some Galant models were fitted with Mitsubishi Motors' Intelligent & Innovative Vehicle Electronic Control System (INVECS) automatic transmission technology that introduced the application of fuzzy control logic in a car. INVECS matched shift patterns in the automatic gearbox to road surface and other driving conditions to allow drivers of all abilities to operate their vehicle safely and more comfortably. The Galant was also fitted with traction control, electronically controlled full-time four-wheel drive (4WD) and active four wheel steering (4WS) and was the first car anywhere to use Active Preview ECS suspension. These systems enhanced its active safety performance and elevated its degree of completion as a 4-door sedan. In August 1994, the Galant-based 5-door Galant Sport joined the lineup to satisfy customers looking for a light-duty RV / sport specialty model.\n\nMitsubishi Motors launched the Libero multi-purpose station wagon in May 1992 after a total makeover of styling, road performance and functionality to meet the ever-diversifying needs of station wagon users. Coined from the Italian for \"free\", the name Libero was also familiar to the Japanese for its use in soccer terminology (meaning sweeper). The Libero was developed to a \"multi-purpose town car\" concept with sedan-like fresh and urban styling that made it look at home in a wide variety of situations, with generous interior space and a flat luggage compartment floor, and with a number of functional features including reclining double-action split rear seats allowing left and right squabs and seatbacks to be folded down separately. It was initially offered with two engines: a 1.8L engine and a new 2.0L dieselturbo engine. The Libero's firm but pliant suspension and wide track together with its high-rigidity body structure gave it excellent handling and stability. The range was also offered with a number of active safety systems, including fulltime four-wheel drive with viscous coupling center differential, anti-lock braking, a LED high mounted stop lamp and rear fog lamps.\n\nThe Lancer Evolution was launched in October 1992 . WRC events at the time were mostly contested by FIA Group A (modified production models) cars, homologation for which required an annual production volume of at least 2,500 units. To make the Lancer Evolution truly competitive, Mitsubishi Motors took the lightweight and compact Lancer and powered it using the 4G63-type intercooler turbo engine delivering torque through the fulltime 4WD system with viscous coupling center differential proven in the sixth-generation Galant VR-4. The engine was modified to produce 250 PS, an extra 10 PS. Body rigidity was increased with strategic reinforcements while reducing weight through adopting an aluminum engine hood and other weight reduction measures. The suspension was optimized chiefly by boosting rigidity. Aerodynamic performance was addressed through the use of large openings in the front bumper and an oversize rear spoiler. Packaging the high level of driving dynamics in a car based on a rally machine, the Lancer Evolution was available with Recaro sport seats and a MOMO steering wheel. The initial 2,500 production run for homologation purposes sold out within days of its launch.\n\nIn October 1992, Mitsubishi Motors launched the Emeraude 4-door hardtop specialty model derived from the Galant. Coined from the French for \"emerald\", the Emeraude was, like the Diamante (diamond), named after a precious stone. With low and wide proportions and a low center of gravity, its smooth and rounded form did justice to its precious stone moniker. Optimized using advanced computer simulation and wind-tunnel testing, the Emeraude's body shape returned a Cd=0.29 aerodynamics. The interior used the finest quality velour soft upholstery while onyx texture panels either side of the center control console added a further touch of luxury to the cockpit. The engine lineup included a 2.0L V6 unit that pumped out 170 PS to deliver smooth and effortless acceleration as well as the quiet and vibration-free operation inherent to a V6. Drivability was enhanced further with the use of an automatic transmission that employed fuzzy logic in controlling the shift pattern. Targeting customers seeking a level of luxury normally found in a larger vehicle class, the Emeraude's equipment specification included the advanced-function Mitsubishi Multi Media Communications (MMCS) navigation system and a digital-surround sound system.\n\nFollowing the first-generation Debonair and the Debonair V, the third iteration of Mitsubishi Motors' executive sedan series was launched in October 1992. Mitsubishi Motors devoted the full spectrum of its vehicle technology into its development and design to achieve the highest levels in terms of size, styling and performance. The Debonair's body was 110mm longer and 90mm wider than its predecessor, featured stately proportions that created a rich and distinctive personality embraced by aesthetically pleasing soft lines and with its generously roomy interior and spacious trunk could rightly claim to offer the full package. The company spared no effort in bestowing the Debonair with the kind of equipment specification that befitted this class of car. The high-tech equipment specification included the laser-based distance warning system which monitored the distance to the vehicle ahead and automatically shifts the transmission out of overdrive (OD) when the system determines the situation was getting dangerous.\n\nOther advanced features included a Rear View Monitor system that sent images to the center console display when reversing, an Active Power Lock system that completed the closing process after the doors and trunk lid had been partially shut, as well as the Mitsubishi Intelligent Cockpit System (MICS) that automatically set seat, head restraint, mirror and steering column tilt/telescope positions to the preferences of the driver operating the keyless entry system. The Debonair was powered by a 3.0L V6 or 3.5L V6 DOHC engine mated to Mitsubishi Motors' INVECS automatic transmission that used fuzzy control logic system in controlling shift patterns to assist the driver.\n\nLaunched in September 1993, the New Minica (in 3- and 5-door body types), the eighth generation in the series, used gently curved surfaces to create a larger-looking body in an elegant, stable looking and distinctive design developed to a \"gentle basic mini\" styling theme. The rounder styling exploited the latest minicar class dimension limits to the full in lengthening the wheelbase by 20 mm. The interior at first glance appeared to be design-focused but also provided significant improvements in comfort and roominess. The 3-door body type used asymmetrically sized front doors, the smaller driver's door facilitating access in tight and narrow spaces. With its high-rigidity well-crib structure frame, the New Minica cleared occupant injury protection requirements for 40 km/h frontal impacts and was the first Japanese car to use power windows with safety mechanism. The New Minica was powered by a new 4-cylinder engine which on higher trim levels was mated to the 4-speed INVECS automatic transmission with fuzzy logic control system well proven on the Galant and a first in the K-car class. The result was quiet and smooth acceleration and a comfortable driving experience. With disc brakes on all four wheels to handle its hot performance, the Dangan-4 brand image leader used a DOHC 20-valve engine with intercooled twin-scroll turbocharger, a 5-speed manual gearbox and a full-time four-wheel driveline with hydraulic coupling unit.\n\nThe New Minica Toppo was launched alongside the eighth-generation Minica in September 1993. To a \"super-space runabout\" theme, the New Minica Toppo's styling sported distinctive lines and a class-topping big cabin that gave expression to its utility and playful character while giving it a road presence similar to that of a compact car. The model also adopted a \"1:2 door\" configuration with a single door on the driver's side and two doors on the passenger side, as well as a \"Super High Roof\" that added 70 mm to the height of the standard roof. The New Minica Toppo provided a roomy cabin as well as a spacious luggage compartment which featured a number of storage solutions. Extended by 20 mm, its longer wheelbase also added to interior roominess. On the safety front, the body cleared occupant injury protection requirements for 40 km/h frontal impacts and featured the first power windows with safety mechanism on a Japanese car. All models came with front disc brakes as standard. The engine lineup included a new 4-cylinder unit , while top trim levels became Mitsubishi Motors first K-cars to be fitted with the 4-speed INVECS (Intelligent & Innovative Vehicle Electronic Control System) automatic transmission employing fuzzy logic control system. Addressing the desire to drive something a little different, the lineup was soon joined by a number of variants with personalities designed to bring more fun to the class and including the recreation specification Carabosse, the young mother and baby-oriented Marble and the Town Bee with its round frog-eye headlamps projecting just forward of the leading edge of the engine hood.\n\nThe FTO sport coupe was launched in October 1994. Anteceded by the Galant FTO launched in 1971 as a younger brother of the Galant GTO, and as a younger brother of the GTO that debuted in 1990, the new FTO was developed as a model that gave ready access to sports car performance. A nimble coupe, the FTO was instantly identifiable as a sport model by its very, for a Mitsubishi Motors' model, curved design and by its long deck, wide track and short wheelbase proportions. Front and rear overhangs were pared to the minimum and overall height was kept low to achieve superior driving dynamics and present a road-hugging appearance. Top trim levels used a 2.0 L V6 MIVEC engine that powered it to a \"fastest machine in its sport car class\" label at the time. This was mated to Mitsubishi Motors' new INVECS-II Sport Mode automatic transmission that employed Learning Control feature to tailor gear shifting timing to the preferences and driving abilities of individual drivers. It also featured Japanâs first Sport Mode on a Japanese-built car allowing enthusiast drivers to shift up and down as if it was a manual gearbox. A car that delivered fun-to-drive qualities in abundance, the FTO was selected 1994-95 Japan Car of the Year.\n\nIn 1993, Mitsubishi Motors started campaigning the WRC in Group A homologated Lancer Evolutions and with several top place results, including second overall in the final round of the year the RAC Rally, showed the model's potential for winning overall line honors. The Lancer Evolution II, introduced in January 1994, exploited competition feedback from its predecessor and featured a number of improvements, chiefly in the areas of handling and stability. The rear LSD was replaced by a mechanical plate type to improve turn-in when entering corners. A longer wheelbase and wider track realized better stability. The Lancer Evolution II rode on OZ alloy road wheels shod with 205/60R15 tires, uprated from the 195/55R15 used on its predecessor. The use of lower first and second gear ratios in the close-ratio transmission brought better acceleration while a change in clutch disc material saw better control as well as improved durability. A reduction in silencer back pressure, a higher turbo boost pressure and changes to valve lift raised the maximum output of the 2.0 L intercooled turbo engine by 10 PS to 260 PS. New design Recaro bucket seats gave much better lateral hold.\n\nThe Delica Space Gear was launched in 1994 as the fourth-generation in the Delica series, \"a new-type of RV\" with multi-pattern seating arrangements, a generous walkthro and extended space utility. The Gear variant name was added in the belief that customers would become attached to it as a familiar âpiece of gearâ for leisure and everyday purposes. The new model replaced the one-box body type of its predecessors with a layout that placed the engine in the nose and not under the front seats, giving a significant improvement in frontal impact safety. With a flat floor from the front seat wells to the luggage compartment, the interior provided a generous walkthro from front seats to the rear cabin. The second-row seats could be arranged to face each other or to face the third-row seats, while tipping up their squabs converted the rear cabin into a very roomy luggage space. The Delica Space Gear was powered by a lineup of four engines, including a 3.0L V6 and a 2.8L intercooled dieselturbo engine. Suspension was by double wishbone at the front and a 5-link with coil spring arrangement at the rear. The 4WD model used the Super Select 4WD driveline popular on the Pajero and with ample obstacle clearance angles and ride height delivered outstanding off-road performance. The Delica Truck and Delica Van series also underwent a full model change at this time.\n\nThe Pajero Mini was launched in December 1994 as a new-approach mini recreational vehicle that fused the functionality of the Pajero with the simplicity and economy of a K-car. The Pajero Mini was a full-feature RV type model that steps outside of the K-car category. It used a high-rigidity monocoque structure, which integrated the body shell with a large cross-section frame, and cleared the Japanese 40 km/h frontal impact occupant injury protection standards. The Pajero Mini was offered with an innovative 4-cyclinder DOHC 20-valve intercooler-turbocharger version with 5-valves per cylinder. Giving better all-terrain performance, the Easy Select four-wheel driveline enabled the drive to change between two- and four-wheel drive and to switch from Hi to Lo range in four-wheel drive while on the move to match different road surface conditions. Its MacPherson strut front and 5-link rear suspension helped the Pajero Mini to deliver outstanding handling and stability as well as a comfortable ride. The interior was loaded with RV functional equipment including a Multi-meter that combined an electronic azimuth display compass, altimeter, external temperature and clock. 3-point ELR seatbelts, in which the freely extendable belt was automatically locked in the event of a sudden stop or collision, were standard. An SRS airbag system was also available.\n\nThe second-generation Diamante was introduced in January 1995, after a full model change. The engine lineup included a 3.0 L V6 MIVEC unit that pumped out a class-topping 270 PS and a 2.5 L V6 MVV unit that was the first lean-burn engine with a displacement over 2.0 liters. Automatic transmission models used the 5-speed gearbox with Sport Mode feature. Suspension was by multi-link all round. The Diamante showcased many of Mitsubishi Motors' latest system technologies, including INVECS-II automatic transmission, Traction control, Electronic Controlled Power Steering, Electronically Controlled Suspension and 4-wheel Steering. These were complemented by advanced safety systems including, auto door unlock triggered on detection of an impact, tire pressure alarm, and the world's first Preview Distance Control that maintained a pre-set and speed-dependent distance using a laser-radar device to measure the distance to the vehicle ahead and a miniature CCD camera to provide visual identification.\n\nTaking the low-stance and distinctive V-shaped front view for its cue, the styling projected an image of speed and stability. While boasting aerodynamics with a Cd = 0.28, the Diamante also provided a generously roomy interior.\n\nIn 1995, and enjoying high acclaim for its motorsport track record both in and outside Japan, the Lancer followed the Mirage in its first full model change in four years. The sixth-generation Lancer was developed to a \"Total Evolution\" theme with the aim of creating a new-generation basic car that had been totally revamped inside and out. Retaining its original body size, the Lancer provided more living space by increasing front and rear head room while also offering a 10 percent increase in trunk volume. The new Lancer came with an eight engine lineup, including: new 1.5 L DOHC unit, 1.8 L V6, and 1.6L MIVEC that powered the sporty MR trim level; and the 1.8L intercooled turbo in the GSR performance model. All gasoline engine models were available with the easy-drive INVECS-II 4-speed automatic transmission, which on some trim levels had Sport Mode manual override that allowed the enthusiast driver to enjoy the motoring experience more fully. The sixth-generation Lancer also provided the base model from which the second-generation Lancer Evolution (IV to VI) models evolved in leaps and bounds.\n\nBuilt by Mitsubishi Motors North America, the second-generation Eclipse, which went on sale in the United States in June 1994, was imported into Japan and launched on the domestic market in June 1995. It shared the platform of the seventh-generation Galant that had undergone a full model change in 1992. Although the lineup included a 4WD model in the United States, in Japan, the Eclipse was available only in a front-engine/front-drive configuration. In its latest iteration, the Eclipse sported a body that was 55 mm wider than its predecessor and was crafted with sleek lines and softly rounded surfaces that gave it a very energetic appearance. Well received for its futuristic cab-forward design and its wide and low road-hugging proportions, it continued to sell well in the U.S. The interior employed a wrap round cockpit with the center console angled toward the driver and with the dashboard and door trim looking as though they were formed in a single molding. The driver's sport bucket seat featured 6-way adjustment for optimum hold and"
