Original layout drawing (graphite on two-hole punch 12 field animation paper) by Chuck Jones for his 1954 short animated film, "Feline Frame-Up." Starring Marc Anthony, the bulldog helplessly in love with a little kitten, and pitting him against the evil Claude Cat. Bow-wowing in theaters on February 13th, it ends with Claude Cat's (you do get the pun, right?) confession and removal from the house.
