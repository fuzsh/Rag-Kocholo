1954 marks when the Warner Bros. animation studio begin efforts to distribute their theatrical cartoons in widescreen to theaters, although by using cropped versions of their Academy prints. Twenty-nine Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies shorts were released.

Notes[]

The Warner Bros. animation studio reopens on January 4.[1]

Starting with this year, the Warner Bros. cartoon opening rings would get a significant overhaul and become smaller. The center hole in the Merrie Melodies rings was made smaller, almost the same size as that found on the old-style Looney Tunes rings, which were made smaller still, to the point where the WB shield cuts into the rings. This was implemented as a new practice to optimize the cartoons for the widescreen ratio that can be played in theaters due to rising popularity of the aforementioned aspect ratio.[2] However, Blue Ribbon reissues during this period would still use the old-style rings and remained only available to theaters in Academy ratio format. Beginning with the 1954-55 season, this also applied to the closing titles, as well as the Blue Ribbon reissues.
