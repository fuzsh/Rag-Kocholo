After spending a little less than a decade in prison, J.W. Coop returns to the world of professional rodeo in the 1960s. Adjusting to the new scene and making up for missed opportunities, Coop goes through a series of challenges on his way back to the top. Cliff Robertson (J.W. Coop) co-wrote and directed the film and a cameo of rodeo legend, Larry Mahan, is also featured in the movie. Another interesting tidbit about this movie: during the National Finals Rodeo scene, the man with a cowboy hat and blue sports coat is Clem McSpadden, a nephew of Will Rogers.
