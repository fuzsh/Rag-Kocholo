        "text": "\"J. W. Coop,\" written, directed and produced by Cliff Robertson, who also plays its title role, is the story of 10 months in the life of a lonely, slightly overage rodeo circuit rider, photographed almost entirely in and around those small Western rodeos that can—if the rider is good—earn a man $60,000 a year, plus another $60,000 in endorsements for things like soft drinks and underwear.When it limits its focus to what J. W. Coop is thinking, or tries to interpret his emotions, the film is unsurprisingly self-conscious, the work of a new filmmaker who is no better or worse than you might expect him to be. When, however, it draws back to see and hear the world around J. W. Coop, which is most of the time, it becomes very fine, almost elegiac, as full of feeling for rootless American lives as any film I've seen since \"Derby,\" which was, after all, a documentary.According to the production notes, Robertson researched his screenplay by following the rodeo circuit and tape-recording conversations, but that cannot, I think, explain the accuracy of so many things in the film not immediately related to professional rodeoing. Overheard at a hamburger stand is a child calling: \"When's dinner, Mom?\" Answers the impatient mom as she climbs into a Barracuda, or a Galaxy, or a Comet, or some such vehicle: \"When I get done bowling!\"Robertson's screenplay is no great shakes as narrative, but it takes a certain courage to amble as amiably as it does. The film follows Coop from his release after nine years in prison (for passing a bad check and then beating up a sheriff), through his return to the rodeo circuit and an idealized affair with a funny, ecology-minded, nut-chewing hippie (Christina Ferrare), up through the rodeo championships in Oklahoma City.It includes quite a lot of spectacular rodeo footage, and dramatic things do happen to Coop in and out of the arena, but Robertson wisely allows his character, which he plays with beautifully authentic, small-town Texas accent, to be defined as much by what we see as by what he does. The movie records things that Coop doesn't necessarily notice—a Texas bus in which all the blacks sit in the front seats while the whites more or less huddle in the back, a rodeo parade with a huge, flowered float labeled \"Church of The Nazarene.\" When an old cowboy wants to stress a point, he says, \"I guaran-damn—tee!\"The language is beautiful and often very funny. This is—as far as I can remember—the first film in which (as reported in dialogue) an airplane has ever been eaten by cows, in which a truck driver talks, with absolute sincerity, about the blessings of Jimmy Hoffa, and in which a farmer philosophizes about labor: \"You don't agitate the fruit, and you don't agitate the pickers.\"There are occasional moments when the movie goes awkwardly sentimental, when it weeps for the passing of the old and the coming of the new, but its point of view is mostly amused and tough, and full of unpatronizing appreciation for its people, the rodeo characters as well as the professional actors. Of the latter, the most noticeable, next to Robertson himself, is Geraldine Page as Coop's addle-brained mother who keeps her radio tuned to cheery revivalists and apparently sleeps with a chicken in her bedroom.\"J.W.
