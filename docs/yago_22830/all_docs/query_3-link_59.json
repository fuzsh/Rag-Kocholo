        "text": "The 1971 Western drama film J W Coop is a triumph for co-writer-producer-director Cliff Robertson, who also stars as the rodeo cowboy J W Coop who rides back to confront his kinfolks after a decade behind bars, actually 9 years, 9 months and 13 days. He wants to pick up where he left off, but the rodeo business, society and everything has changed.\n\nRobertson does a thoroughly worthwhile job in all his tasks, and this is a special, sensitive, poignant film, quietly packed with agonising regret, frustration and pain, and he gives a subtle, appealing performance, though finally there is a slight lack of excitement that allowed the similar simultaneous Junior Bonner (with Steve McQueen) to take most of the plaudits.\n\nGeraldine Page makes the most of her small co-star role as Robertson’s bible-thumping Mama.\n\nIt is written by Cliff Robertson, Gary Cartwright and Bud Shrake.\n\nAlso in the cast are Cristina Ferrare, R G Armstrong, R L Armstrong, John Crawford, Wade Crosby, Marjorie Durant Dye, Paul Harper, Son Hooker, Richard Kennedy, Bruce Kirby, Mary Robin Redd, Claude Stroud, Wayne Taylor, Augie Vallejo, Dennis Reiners and Myrtis Dightman.\n\nIt was also competing with the The Honkers and When the Legends Die.\n\nIt was premiered at the Chicago International Film Festival in October 1971 and released in the US on 1 January 1972, but did not come to the UK till 29 March 1973.\n\n© Derek Winnert 2020 Classic Movie Review 10,564"
