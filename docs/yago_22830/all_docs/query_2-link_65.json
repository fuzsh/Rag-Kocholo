        "text": "Cliff Robertson was a solid, dependable Hollywood leading man who periodically threw off a somewhat bland persona to play more troubling characters, such as the psychotic husband in Autumn Leaves, avenging gangster in Underworld USA and manipulating politician in The Best Man.\n\nHe was an Oscar winner for his performance as a mentally handicapped man in Charly and in 1977 helped to expose a notorious Hollywood embezzlement scandal when he discovered that his name had been forged on a cashed pay cheque for $10,000. A criminal investigation revealed that the forger was David Begelman, head of the Columbia studio. Columbia discovered that Begelman had embezzled an additional $65,000 through other forged cheques but tried to contain the scandal by quietly easing Begelman out."
