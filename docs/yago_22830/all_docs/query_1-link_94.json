        "text": "By of the\n\nCliff Robertson, who won an Oscar for his performance in the 1968 movie \"Charly\" and was reintroduced to audiences two generations later as the beloved uncle of Peter Parker in the \"Spider-Man\" movies, died Saturday, one day after his 88th birthday, the Los Angeles Times reports.\n\nThe Times, quoting Robertson's family, said he died of natural causes.\n\nRobertson starred in a string of high-profile movies in the 1960s and '70s, playing a young John F. Kennedy in the 1963 World War II drama \"PT 109,\" an ambitious anti-communist candidate for president opposite Henry Fonda in the 1964 political drama \"The Best Man,\" and a man intent on finding his late wife in the 1976 thriller \"Obsession.\"\n\nOff the screen, Robertson was the whistleblower in a dramatic check-forging scandal in Hollywood in the late 1970s. The scandal implicated then-Columbia Pictures president David Begelman, but Robertson, by bringing the case out in the open after having his name forged on some checks, later claimed he'd been unofficially blacklisted for speaking up, and for several years was unable to get work in Hollywood.\n\nRobertson's diverse credits ranged from playing a jealous rich kid in \"Picnic\" (1955) to surfing legend \"The Big Kahuna\" in \"Gidget\" (1958) to Cole Younger in the Western \"The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid\" (1972) to Hugh Hefner in the Dorothy Stratton biopic \"Star 80\" (1983)."
