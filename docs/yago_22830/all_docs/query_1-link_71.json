Robertson, an avid pilot and promoter of aviation, will narrate the documentary Reach for the Sky: Inside the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds, produced at an upstate New York PBS station. “I am not a warlord type,” Robertson told The Associated Press. “I love aviation for the people in it.” The actor said he was impressed with the unique footage shot for the film and enjoyed doing the voiceover. He will next appear in Spider-Man, scheduled for release in May 2002."
