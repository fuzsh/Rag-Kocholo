Davis) The Pilot (screenplay), New Line Cinema, 1979.\n\n(With Michael Maryk) Thirteenth Child: Legend of the Jersey Devil, Volume I (screenplay), Alex Mendoza & Associates, 2002.\n\nAlso author of the play The V.I.P.s, 1981. Robertson reportedly wrote a sequel to Charly in the 1990s.\n\nSIDELIGHTS: Actor Cliff Robertson's own biography might well be the subject of a movie. The son of a father who loved partying and women much more than he cared for his son and wife—the elder Robertson was married half a dozen times in an era when divorce was uncommon—young Robertson was adopted and raised by his grandmother after his own mother died of a ruptured appendix when he was two years old. Consciously disavowing the negative role model set for him by his father, he grew up with a strong work ethic, and as a child even lied about his age so that he could get a job delivering papers.\n\nIn 1955, the young Robertson appeared in the film Picnic as the clean-cut Kansan who loses his girlfriend, Kim Novak, to his old buddy William Holden. His career entered high gear in the early 1960s, when no less a figure than President John F. Kennedy personally chose Robertson to play him in PT 109, which dramatizes Kennedy's wartime service. Against the advice of his agent, who told him that playing a mentally retarded man would spell the end of his career, Robertson took the title role in Charly, an adaptation of Daniel Keyes's moving novella Flowers for Algernon, and walked away with the Academy Award for best actor in 1968.\n\nFour years later, Robertson wrote, produced, directed, and starred in J. W. Coop. At the outset of the film, Coop is released from prison after eight years, and intends to return to work as a professional rodeo cowboy. But as the overly confident Coop discovers, much has changed in the world since the early 1960s, and he finds himself bewildered by the society he encounters.\n\nJ. W. Coop was well received, and Robertson went on to create a second project, The Pilot, in which he played Mike Hagan, a successful commercial flyer who tries to hide his alcoholism. The year of The Pilot's release in 1979, however, found Robertson embroiled in a scandal that would ultimately confer even greater status on the actor, but which in the short run all but brought his career to a halt.\n\nIn 1976, Columbia Pictures president David Begelman forged Robertson's name in order to cash a check for $10,000, made out to Robertson by the studio. Robertson only found out about this much later, when the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) contacted him, demanding payment of taxes on the money, which Robertson did not even know he had earned. He reported Begelman, and in what many regard as a typical Hollywood response to a problem, the film industry took swift action—against Robertson. While Begelman received a slap on the wrist, Robertson was blacklisted throughout Hollywood, and could get no work between 1979 and 1982. As for Begelman, the studio head went on to MGM/United Artists, but several failures led him to leave and form his own production company. When that company failed, too, he shot and killed himself in August 1995. The scandal involving Robertson is the subject of David McClintick's 1982 book, Indecent Exposure: A True Story of Hollywood and Wall Street.\n\nUltimately Robertson returned to favor, with successful roles such as his portrayal of Playboy's Hugh Hefner in Star '80. The incident, however, only confirmed his suspicions of Hollywood: Robertson is famous for his refusal to move to Los Angeles, a fact that brought an end to his marriage to actress Dina Merrill, and he has chosen instead to reside on Long Island.\n\nEver the independent, Robertson reportedly wrote a sequel to Charly, the rights to which he had purchased long before. In 1996, he told People that he intended to make the picture, but needed to raise $4.6 million to do so. In 2002, he appeared in, and wrote the screenplay for, a film made for an even smaller budget—just $1.5 million. Released just in time for Halloween, Thirteenth Child: Legend of the Jersey Devil takes as its premise a centuries-old folk tale regarding a horned, cloven-hoofed demonic figure that is said to roam the Pine Barrens of southern New Jersey. Supposedly the devil was the child of a woman named Mother Leeds, who already had twelve children, and who cursed the thirteenth, born in 1735. In the film, Robertson plays Mr. Shroud, an old man who lives alone in the Pine Barrens as part of a pact with the devil.\n\nBy contrast, Robertson himself is famed for his refusal to make a pact with the real-life devils of fame and fortune. \"I've lived long enough to learn,\" he told Luaine Lee of the Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service, \". . . where the top of the totem pole should be. To me it's my kids, family, a kind of a religion, and a sense of self.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nBOOKS\n\nContemporary Theatre, Film, and Television, volume 32, Gale (Detroit, MI), 2000.\n\nCrist, Judith, and Shirley Sealy, Take 22: Moviemakers on Moviemaking, Viking (New York, NY), 1984.\n\nInternational Dictionary of Films and Filmmakers, Volume 3: Actors and Actresses, St. James Press (Detroit, MI), 1996.\n\nMcClintick, David, Indecent Exposure: A True Story of Hollywood and Wall Street, Morrow (New York, NY), 1982.\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nChristian Science Monitor, May 5, 2000, \"A Man with a Moral Mission: Hollywood Stories\" (interview), p. 19.\n\nKnight Ridder/Tribune News Service, August 5, 1996, Luaine Lee, \"Cliff Robertson Still Breaking Hollywood's Rules,\" p. 805.\n\nNew York Times, October 13, 2002, Margo Nash, review of Thirteenth Child: Legend of the Jersey Devil, Volume I, p. 11."
