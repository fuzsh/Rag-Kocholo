I thought the scenes were done very well in that they were original rides; therefore could not help to have two (or three) bulls in one ride. Taking cuts like that must have been heartrending for Cliff. I thought Cliff Robertson epitomized the rodeo cowboy of that era; he looked just exactly like most of the men I grew up around. They all had that aura of being so tough you didn't mess with them. None of them would accept 2nd place.\n\nMovie Reviews\n\nA minor masterpiece...\n\ninframan | the lower depths | 05/29/2000\n\n(4 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"Cliff Robertson has always been one of the hugely underrated actors of stage, TV & film. Anyone who saw his original performance in Days of Wine & Roses on Playhouse 90(with Piper Laurie) or saw him doing Tennessee Williams on Broadway knows that this is someone who for whatever reasons missed out on the major stardom that was his natural due. J.W. Coop is one more surprise from Mr. Robertson. This movie is the closest approximation I've ever seen on the screen to a Hemingway story. It's full of the rich true details of place and incident, and the aching pain of the fighter/cowboy/soldier/man rubbing up against life, trying to make some kind of mark, some kind of sense, before his end comes, & it always comes too soon for these guys.\"\n\nCOOP? How do you spell that?\n\nJohn Cobb | Austin, TX | 02/13/2000\n\n(4 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"Growing up in the Mid_West, the concept of \"art' film was quite foreign to me in 1971. The first time I saw J.W. Coop, it struck me like a thunderbolt. Lots of ambin' around, reaction shots, quiet confidence, pseudo-documentary style, unspoken sub text...WOW.A labor love for Cliff Robertson, JW COOP is an indie-like movie developed in the 1970's studio system, where titles like POSEIDON ADVENTURE and TOWERING INFERNO were the only things that made sense at the time.As a result, studio-type compromises are evident throughout--Christina Ferrare is atrocious as the hippie-chick who interjects JW's dust covered mind-set to the present. I'm certain the original script-by Gary Cartwright and the ingenious Bud Shrake was likely funnier...and edgier.What's left is still engaging, and the rest of the supporting cast is solid, the story interesting--spiced with wonderful little vignettes throughout. I highly recommend.\"\n\nThe RCA at its best before it became just entertainment.\n\nReginaldo B. Cornejo | Porterville, CA USA | 03/03/2010\n\n(4 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"Having grown up around Rodeo in the early 50s and 60s, I found J.W. Coop to be a magic carpet ride into the past when Rodeo hadn't been tainted by big money sponsors and television. One more thing that made this movie enjoyable to watch was that it was filmed on location in two of my home towns I lived in Porterville and Springville, California, as a very young man. Infact the young, teen, blonde girl stirring the pot in the movie (don't blink or you'll miss her) was one of my friends and she still lives in Porterville. Anyway, if you want to watch a good A- Rodeo movie with a small town feel to it, then pick up this solid, well written movie. One more thing, I had forgotten the movie, so I was really surprised by the ending. No special effects, just good editing and good writing. I felt I was watching my father rodeo again. He never made it big, but it was fun to see him try to earn some money doing what he loved.\""
