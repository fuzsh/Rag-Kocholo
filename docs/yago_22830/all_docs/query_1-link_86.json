        "text": "Q. Please help me before I lose it. Could you tell me where Leah and Holly are on “The Talk”? They haven’t been on for the past week and I really miss them.\n\nA. The simple truth is that the contracts of Leah Remini and Holly Robinson-Peete were not renewed as part of some general tinkering going on with the show.\n\nBut that hasn’t stopped rumors from spreading that include: Co-host Julie Chen didn’t like them, and since she’s married to CBS president Les Moonves, she gets whatever she wants. Or co-creator Sara Gilbert didn’t like them. Neither of these have been confirmed.\n\nQ. Tell me more about the TV programs “Peter Gunn” and “Mannix.” When were they on, who were the actors and was Mother’s a bar on “Mannix” or “Peter Gunn”?\n\nA. “Peter Gunn” ran on NBC from 1959 to 1961, then jumped to ABC for the 1961-62 season. It was a private eye series with a couple of important differences — one was its star, Craig Stevens, who used his resemblance to Cary Grant to maximum advantage as the cool, suave gumshoe Gunn. Another was the show’s creator and producer Blake Edwards, who went on to give us “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” and the Pink Panther movies, and the third was the show’s jazzy, cocktail-hour score by Henry Mancini, beginning a long association with Edwards. Mother’s was the name of the bar where Gunn hung out, listening to Mancini jazz and visiting with girlfriend Edie Hart (Lola Albright).\n\n“Mannix” was also about a private eye, Joe Mannix by name, played by Michael Connors. The show ran on CBS from 1967 to 1975. During its first season, Mannix was an investigator for the high-tech security firm Intertect, but after that he was on his own, supported only by his “gal Friday” Peggy Fair (Gail Fisher).\n\nMannix never went to Mother’s.\n\nQ. When is “The Walking Dead” returning to AMC?\n\nA. The hit zombie drama is scheduled to return Oct. 16.\n\nQ. There’s a commercial for American Express in which a couple’s car has broken down and they’re playing chess. Then one of them finds a passport and they go on a trip. What’s the music in that commercial?\n\nA. The song is “Tenuousness,” by Andrew Bird.\n\nQ. I fell in love with the dog in “Gran Torino” and would very much like to know what kind of dog it is.\n\nA. That dog is a yellow Labrador retriever.\n\nQ. When I read about the death of Cliff Robertson, I was surprised they did not mention his brother. I think his name was Dale. Am I right? I thought Dale was so handsome, but Cliff the better actor.\n\nA. You’re right, sort of: There is an actor named Dale Robertson, but he and Cliff Robertson are not related.\n\nQ. I remember a movie about an affluent young couple tired of the rat race who sold everything and bought a motor home to travel the country.\n\nA. That’s a good, little offbeat comedy called “Lost in America,” released in 1985, with Albert Brooks and Julie Hagerty as the couple. Brooks also directed and co-wrote the movie. Writer-producer Garry Marshall (“Pretty Woman”) is also in the cast as a casino owner. It’s on DVD."
