        "text": "COMO Alpina Dolomites, South Tyrol, Italy\n\nCradled by the sheer cliffs of a UNESCO Natural World Heritage site is a modern architectural masterpiece.\n\nClad in quartzite and wood, this boutique hotel brings a modern twist to the alpine experience, with its circular take on chalet style. The luxury year-round COMO Alpina Dolomites has a family atmosphere true to the traditional spirit of South Tyrol’s mountain hospitality. It features 60 thoughtfully designed rooms and sweeping views of some of the most famous peaks in the Dolomite mountain range.\n\nEach aspect of the resort – from dining to wellness – reflects the region’s cherished traditions, enhanced by the style of COMO Hotels & Resorts. Every property under the brand’s umbrella is deeply rooted in its environment, whether it be the urban pulse of London, Bhutan’s beautiful landscapes, or the serene beaches of Turks and Caicos and the Maldives.\n\nDesign\n\nWith the facade built using original quartzite natural stone and a roof embraced by a wooden structure, the design emulates the natural movements of the mineral-rich terrain. The entryway was designed to resemble a rock crevice. Inside looks contemporary and feels soothing, with natural materials used to integrate the resort with its surroundings, and every room soaked in natural light.\n\nGuestrooms are private sanctuaries combining soft colours with functional, high quality furnishings finessed by South Tyrol’s traditional artisans. Each room offers magnificent views of the Dolomites range, its alpine meadows and jagged peaks from either a balcony or terrace. The vibe is peaceful, with soft lighting, natural wood and a muted colour palette of brown, green and tan.\n\nAll suites have a bio fireplace with real flame, and the classic and deluxe suites feature an infrared sauna. Suites in the circular chalet building are connected to the main building by a heated underground passageway. The headline COMO Suite is suitable for up to four adults and has two en suite bathrooms.\n\nAmenities\n\nThe resort champions the freshest local and regional products, with a menu that fuels alpine adventures. Dining options include: the bright and casual Alpina Chalet in the fresh mountain air; and the intimate Mountain Restaurant, which is dedicated to the art of healthful dining by COMO Shambhala Cuisine. The relaxing Lobby Lounge is the perfect setting for drinks and small bites as well as a complimentary afternoon tea.\n\nHolistic wellness is one the core pillars of COMO properties. Here, COMO Shambhala Retreat offers a wellness programme that includes a 22m indoor pool, a 7m panoramic outdoor pool, sauna, relaxation zones, a fitness centre, and a beauty sanctuary. The focus is on revitalisation and rejuvenation, ensuring that guests return from their stay feeling both refreshed and renewed.\n\nDestination\n\nThe resort is in Val Gardena on the Alpe di Siusi, one of Europe’s largest high-altitude plateaus and is nestled within a landscape characterised by towering peaks, sprawling valleys and alpine meadows. On the adventure front, pristine pistes beckon, with Val Gardena being a jewel in the Dolomiti Superski circuit. The ski-in/ski-out resort offers the guidance of skilled instructors to ensure an exhilarating skiing experience for everyone whether they’re an off-piste expert or a novice finding their footing on the slopes. For those looking to venture beyond the slopes, the area also provides year-round activities, from hiking and mountain biking in warmer seasons to snowboarding and cross-country skiing in winter.\n\nCOMO Alpina Dolomites is accessible by car from the Italian cities of Verona/Bolzano or Brennero and transport can be arranged from the Bolzano and Chiusa stations, as well as the airports of Bolzano (40km) and Innsbruck (120km). The property is near the mountain station of the Siusi-Alpe di Siusi cableway. Cars are not allowed to access Alpe di Siusi from 9am to 5pm without a transit permit.\n\nThe Dolomites are spectacular at any time of the year and receive more hours of sunshine than other mountain ranges in the area, even in winter. Summer months offer warm temperatures and plenty of sun, with an average maximum temperature of around 25ºC on the valley floors. Winter snow usually begins to accumulate in December, lasting through March and sometimes April."
