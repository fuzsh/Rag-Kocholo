This follows extensive R&D at ALPINA.\n\nThe engines are still all made by hand at ALPINA's factory in Buchloe (* apart from the D3 engine). Each engine is built by one technician and when complete shipped to the relevant BMW factory to be added to the car's chassis. All other parts are specified and sourced by ALPINA and also delivered to the BMW factory.\n\nOnce the car is constructed by the BMW factory it is shipped to Buchloe for completion. This at a minimum includes adding the wheels, badges, spoilers and interior details. Options anywhere from ALPINA stripes to fully bespoke leather interiors are also available.\n\nFor further information about ALPINA today please refer to this article\n\nLast updated: 8:33 PM, 9th July 2007ACTIVEALPINA FAQ 6:\n\nWhere can I buy a BMW ALPINA?\n\nALPINA is officially represented in the following geographies:\n\nGermany\n\nBMW ALPINA automobiles can be purchased through BMW dealerships throughout Germany.\n\nThe full list is -> HERE UK\n\nIn the UK cars are supplied by Sytner group.

The Plaque illustrates the unique number of the vehicle based on worldwide production of a particular model derivation e.g. e39 5 Series based B10 3.3 Saloon or e46 3 Series based B3 S touring.\n\nBoth LHD and RHD cars share the same numbering.\n\nAs implied above there will be a 001 B3 Bi-turbo Saloon, 001 B3 Bi-turbo Coupe, 001 B3 Bi-Turbo Cabrio and a 001 B3 Bi-turbo Touring.\n\nIn the UK\n\nSome of the earlier UK cars were made under license by TWS and then by Sytner (vs. being imported from Buchloe) these cars have a less clear numbering system.\n\nYou can find a breakdown of the UK production numbers since 1993 Here\n\nLast updated: 8:43 PM, 9th July 2007ACTIVEALPINA FAQ 8:\n\nWhat is the Warranty on a BMW ALPINA ?\n\nAll BMW ALPINAs world-wide come with a two-year, unlimited-mileage warranty, as do all BMWs*.\n\n(*)Switzerland and the UK are the only two countries in Europe that BMW offers a three year warranty\n\nLast updated: 8:43 PM, 9th July 2007ACTIVEALPINA FAQ 9:\n\nWhat is the current BMW ALPINA line up ?\n\nALPINA currently produces:\n\nALPINA B7 Saloon\n\nThe longest running of the current model line up. Based on the e65 7 Series. Introduced in 2004 the car saw the first appearance of the H1 engine. This 4.4-litre engine utilises an ASA supercharger to increase power to 493bhp and 516lb ft.\n\nALPINA B6 Coupe and Cabrio\n\nBased on e63/e64 6 Series and also using the H1 engine. Performance is up slightly from the 7 Series thanks to smaller weight. The car also has 4 exhausts as compared to 2 on both the 7 Series and 5 Series.\n\nALPINA B5 Saloon and Touring\n\nBased on the e60/e61 5 Series and again featuring the H1 engine.\n\nALPINA D3 Saloon and Touring\n\nBased on the e90/e91 3 Series. The D3 opens up a new segment for ALPINA being their cheapest car ever. The D3 uses a tuned version of the 320d engine. Power rises to 197bhp and torque to 302lb ft.\n\nComing Soon....\n\nALPINA B3 Bi-turbo Saloon, Coupe, Cabrio (and Touring)\n\nThe new B3 Bi-turbo Saloon debuted at Geneva 2007 and features a tuned version of BMW's 335i petrol engine. Power rises to 355bhp and torque 369lb ft.\n\nThe B3 Bi-turbo Coupe made it's world-wide debut at Goodwood Festival of Speed, June 2007.\n\nLast updated: 8:44 PM, 9th July 2007ACTIVEALPINA FAQ 10:\n\nAre BMW ALPINAs Speed restricted?\n\nNo\n\nA characteristic of All ALPINA cars is that they have no artificial limiter on their top speed.\n\nIn fact the only speed-limited BMW ALPINA was the BMW ALPINA ROADSTER V8, as BB felt putting the aerodynamics needed to reduce rear lift would have been \"like a moustache on the Mona Lisa\" !\n\nThis is unlike all BMWs including M cars which are loosely limited to 155mph like most German cars.\n\nLast updated: 8:46 PM, 9th July 2007ACTIVEALPINA FAQ 11:\n\nWhat is the rarest BMW ALPINA?\n\nThe rarest ALPINA ever was the B8 4.0 which only reached 4 units. All 4 cars went to Japan.\n\nLast updated: 8:46 PM, 9th July 2007ACTIVEALPINA FAQ 12:\n\nWhat is the H1 ?\n\nH1 is the codename for the engine that powers the current B7 (7 Series), B5 (5 Series) and B6 (6 Series) ALPINAs.\n\nBased on the 4.4-litre (N62B44) BMW Engine it utilises supercharger to produce 493bhp and 516lb ft.\n\nThe supercharger is unique and patented. There is, at present, nothing like it in the industry.\n\nIt uses what looks nominally like the intake half of a turbo, but is driven through a fixed-ratio planetary gearset off the crank, hence being termed a 'Radial' or 'Nautilus-type compressor'. Using this system, 6,000rpm at the crank changes to 7,000 at the super-charger's bell housing pulley (driven over a poly-V belt), and rises to 105,000rpm at the turbine. As you can imagine that produces quite a bit of air pressure.\n\nThe real key is that the radial compressor's geometry is quite efficient. ALPINA talk of parasitic losses of about 20bhp at 6,000rpm. Most Roots-type or Lysholm super-charging systems use over 100bhp just to operate themselves at full song.\n\nThat's why the fuel economy is so good. Most Magazines are reporting ALPINA fuel economies in their double-tests of about 30% better than the competition. Another reason for the good mileage of the B7/B6/B5 is the generously-dimensioned, air-to-air inter-cooler. It is of the size and thermal capability usually found in a 7.5-tonnes lorry.\n\nLastly, and the reason for another patent on the system, there is the throttle switch or throttle plate before 'upstream of' the radial compressor.It feathers just the right amount of air over the turbine vane, sometimes only 3-4 percent of maximum volume, so that when it's disconnected or free wheeling\n\nLast updated: 8:35 PM, 26th March 2007ACTIVEALPINA FAQ 13:\n\nShould my ALPINA have ALPINA roundels\n\nA common question is whether an ALPINA should have ALPINA roundels / Crest Logos instead of BMW ones on the boot and bonnet.\n\nThe answer is no they should not. No ALPINA has ever featured such a thing and ALPINA have never made one. The car is known as a BMW ALPINA, as a reflection to the two companies working in close co-operation. As such the car retains it's BMW roundels and gets the ALPINA wording alongside.\n\nALPINA continue to use every legal means to challenge and stop the makers of ALPINA Crest Logos for the boot and bonnet, since there is, originally, no such thing.\n\nLast updated: 5:12 PM, 1st September 2008ACTIVEALPINA FAQ 14:\n\nWhat is an ALPINA Plaque\n\nAll ALPINA cars have a unique plaque, highlighting it's rarity and exclusivity. The Plaque illustrates the car's unique number of the car based on Worldwide production of a particular model derivation e.g. e39 5 Series based B10 3.3 Saloon or e46 3 Series based B3 S touring.\n\nBoth LHD and RHD cars share the same numbering.\n\nAs implied above there will be a 001 B3 bi-turbo Saloon, 001 B3 bi-turbo Coupe and a 001 B3 bi-turbo Touring.\n\nIn the UK\n\nSome of the earlier UK cars were made under licence by TWS and then by Sytner (vs. being imported from Buchloe) these cars have a less clear numbering system.\n\nLast updated: 9:45 PM, 9th July 2007ACTIVEALPINA FAQ 15:\n\nHow can I recognise a BMW ALPINA\n\nYou can recognise a BMW ALPINA usually by the following details: Low stright front spoiler. ALPINA 20 spoke wheels either in Classic or more modern Dynamic styles. ALPINA badging on rear of car\n\nLast updated: 8:32 AM, 8th July 2007ACTIVEALPINA FAQ 16:\n\nSo whats with ALPINA Wheels\n\nALPINA Wheels\n\nOne of the most recognisable aspects of an ALPINA is the wheels.\n\nCLASSICS\n\nOnly started being called CLASSIC when ALPINA introduced the DYNAMIC wheel.\n\nThey debuted in 1971 on the BMW 3.0 CSL \"batmobile\", the car ALPINA developed and built for BMW for Touring Car racing.\n\nClassic Wheels Evolution\n\nSoftlines vs. Hardlines\n\nDYNAMICS\n\nDynamics were introduced in 2002 on the Z8 based Roadster V8. As with the Classic wheel the Dynamic has 20 spokes (5 sets of 4)\n\nALPINA wheels are available for purchase seperately and can be bought for all models where there is an ALPINA derivative as well as models that never had an ALPINA version (1 Series, X3, X5, and Mini)\n\nLast updated: 8:30 AM, 8th July 2007ACTIVEALPINA FAQ 17:\n\nDo BMW ALPINA's have more than 1 VIN / Chassis numbers\n\nYes\n\nThey have in fact two VINs (Vehicle Identification numbers).\n\nThe original BMW one, which is crossed out (physically with a X, this is done with a laser). This is done in such a way that the VIN is still readable.\n\nAnd the ALPINA one. This is the car's real VIN which should appear on the vehicles V5 (in the UK).\n\nJust to confuse BMW refer to the car using the original VIN on their computers.\n\nLast updated: 8:56 PM, 9th July 2007ACTIVEALPINA FAQ 18:\n\nIs my BMW ALPINA thatcham Cat 1?\n\nYes.\n\nIn car entertainment and security are standard BMW items. Therefore the car has a BMW security system that is thatcham Cat 1 approved. Certainly this is the case for all cars 1997 onwards.\n\nLast updated: 8:56 PM, 9th July 2007ACTIVEALPINA FAQ 19:\n\nIs a BMW ALPINA modified or imported\n\nDespite insurance companies telling you this. A BMW ALPINA is neither imported or modified.\n\nALPINA is recognised a car maker in it's own right and their automobiles are brought into the country just like any other makers cars, such as BMW.\n\nLast updated: 9:01 PM, 9th July 2007"
