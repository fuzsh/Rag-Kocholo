        "text": "Is it for me?\n\nThe Via Alpina is likely to satisfy stronger trekkers who like a good day out in the hills. You'll know you've had one! In the week from Engelberg to Kandersteg, for example, the difficulty builds up right to the last day. The crossing of the Hohturli is notable for its wooden steps on the approach and the scree paths on the way down.\n\nNot all of the passes are like this, however, and by judicious choice it's possible to walk 3 or 4 consecutuve days over the lower, grassier passes such as the Grosse Scheidegg (1,962m).\n\nThe route is relatively even in terms of daily distances and difficulty, given the range of areas and terrain encountered. This gives a pleasing rhythm. The Swiss set-up caters extremely well for trekking in this way.\n\nCan I manage it?\n\nThe hardest parts of the route (in terrain terms) are the ascents to the Sefinafurgga and the Hohturli, the two highest Via Alpina passes. Both passes have ascents and descents over at times loose shale and scree. The wooden steps (up and down the Sefinafurgga and up to the Hohturli) give solid walking but the angles are at times daunting and need a good head for heights. In bad weather the experience is needed to judge whether to cross the pass or to go around by train and bus.\n\nIn terms of distance, the route is not unduly hard each day; the lifestyle of trekking point to point is one that is quickly settled into, we find, and that gives a relaxing pace of life. Your day is reassuringly governed by the main event, crossing to the next valley.\n\nWhat's it like underfoot?\n\nForest paths in the valleys are straightforward enough, rising to the open meadow where narrow hard-pack (or muddy) paths cross grassland. Above, we venture into the high hills and good balance is needed on loose rocky paths and steps. In descent from the Hohturli to the Oechinensee there is hard walking on rocky paths, at one point along the crest of a lateral moraine. Textbook geography! Some drops to the side are substantial and good footing is essential.\n\nAre the routes obvious?\n\nThe paths in the Swiss Alps are aided by frequent waymarking. This means a mix of white-red-white paint flashes on rocks and trees, or occasionally yellow diamonds painted on rocks and trees. Signposts are present at most of the main junctions, yellow-enammelled metal, with estimated times given.\n\nThe presence of a waymark of course only tells the walker that they are on a path - not which path it is! Another key point is that there is no official Via Alpina given on signposts. Instead the walker must follow for the day's destination. Often this is given as the village across the pass (e.g. Grindelwald) but until the pass it might just be the pass itself (e.g. Grosse Scheidegg) at which point signs start to point to further destinations.\n\nDespite the good waymarking and signposting, it is essential for all parties in the Swiss Alps to have at least one competent navigator with a map and compass, for those situations where the route is not marked at a turning or where the clouds have closed in. Our routecards, notes and maps give you all you need to complete the trek under your own steam.\n\nDuring each summer season, snow falls on typically two or three or more occasions. It tends to go away equally quickly and tends not to be deep at the altitude of the Via Alpina, but for the time that it remains it can make navigation quite challenging. Under a cover of snow, ground features are hidden and reliance on map and compass skills is key.\n\nIs the walking technically difficult?\n\nOur Via Alpina is a walk, not containing any climbs or via ferrata routes. There is no glacier walking and no rock climbing.\n\nThere are however some sections where the path crosses rocky and steep ground including steep scree slopes, plus sections with metal cables as handrails over normal Alpine walking terrain. Some stages cross open, unforgiving terrain without easy escape routes: full days of mountain walking calling for self-reliance especially in wet weather with bad visibility.\n\nUnseasonal weather\n\nThe typical summer's day in the Alps brings hot sun, perhaps with occasional rain or afternoon storms, but in any case paths clear of snow. However, fresh snowfalls occur each summer on a handful of occasions. Most often, these leave a coating of an inch or two on higher passes only, and they disappear in a day or two. However, sometimes the snow stays for longer periods and is deeper. While the Via Alpina should be approached as a summer Alpine trek, with Summer snow unlikely, it is wise to know that snow can fall even in summer.\n\nWhen to go?\n\nOur Via Alpina season runs from mid-July to mid-September.\n\nThis short season is imposed by the weather: the chance of late-Spring snow patches remaining into the middle of July across the higher passes, and the chance of the weather deteriorating into late September. Because we can't predict the weather for the coming summer, we have to set these dates in advance.\n\nRe-routing between Lenk and Rochers de Naye\n\nIn 2020, 2021 and 2022 the Via Alpina around Gstaad and Col des Mosses was fluctuating among some different routes on the ground; that is, local Swiss authorities (Club Alpin Suisse) were moving the Via Alpina from Lauenen, Gsteig and Col des Mosses above Les Diablerets, towards the North to Gstaad, l'Etivaz and Rossiniere. We like some of these new routes but not others! Specifically we are glad to give in our Routecards the routes via Gstaad and l'Etivaz, but not as much via Rossiniere. During 2022 we completed our full recces of the new routes, and we are advising on nights at Gstaad instead of Gsteig, and at Chateau d'Oex instead of Col des Mosses. This makes the walking better, and also the nights! This is all on the Western week.\n\nOn the Eastern week we are able to advise in our Routecard VAS1 on the optional Vaduz-Sargans day, before our route starts in Sargans. We do not recommend adding this day as a matter of course, but it is an option for those with the time and energy.\n\nEvery year, our short season is imposed by the weather: the chance of late-Spring snow patches remaining into the middle of July across the higher passes, and the chance of the weather deteriorating into late September. Because we can't predict the weather for the coming summer, we have to set these dates in advance.\n\nThe Via Alpina in context\n\nThe Via Alpina compared to treks in the UK\n\nTrekking in the UK tends to be about distances more than elevation gain, making comparisons difficult. Supposing you were to trek in the English Lake District by asending the higher peaks (Scafell Pike, Helvellyn) daily for a week, with 1,000m of ascent and descent over sometimes very rocky and loose terrain, this would more closely approximate the Via Alpina than does the Coast to Coast or West Highland Way. However, a good idea is given by the Coast to Coast stage from Grasmere to Patterdale if the Helvellyn ascent option is taken.\n\nThe Via Alpina compared to the TMB and the Walker's Haute Route\n\nThese other treks bear a lot of comparison, being series of valley crossings across cols of varying difficulty. The Sefinafurgga and Hohturli cols on the VAS, as the two hardest, take the difficulty level beyond that of the TMB up to that of the Walker's Haute Route. Perhaps the settings are a little less wild and demanding than the hardest of the Haute Route. Otherwise, the mix of distances and grassier cols is akin to the TMB, especially as we reach the more undulating and cross-country Western end of the Via Alpina. Overall, the theme of crossing cols is more consistent on the VAS. It really is a crossing of passes from one side of Switzerland to the other.\n\nComparing our 5 big Alpine treks\n\nThe Haute Route is substantially the toughest, suitable only for trekkers with particularly solid experience, balance and fitness.\n\nThe Via Alpina includes three rocky cols that approach the Haute Route's level of challenge, though the route as a whole is more forgiving. The same applies to the Adlerweg but in its case one col (the Eppzirlerscharte) stands above the rest as very difficult, and it can be skipped by descending and taking the train. The Adlerweg is notable for some long days on wide tracks.\n\nThe AV1 is more consistent in its difficulty but is especially demanding of good balance, with steep, rocky and wild situations calling for mountain experience.\n\nThe TMB is a superb all-rounder that mixes tough, solid mountain days with gentler ones, allowing trekkers to sample the harder terrain as at the Fenetre d'Arpette (a variant, shared with the Haute Route) while not requiring any extremes.\n\nIt's worth noting that each trek has different possible schedules, governing the physical difficulty, and on many days different variants affect the terrain difficulty.\n\nBelow we compare the stats of our 5 big trips:"
