        "text": "The Alpine region is one of the largest economic and productive regions in Europe where about 70 million people live and work, as well as it is an attractive tourist destination for millions of guests every year. However, it faces several major challenges:\n\nEconomic globalisation requiring the territory to distinguish itself as competitive and innovative\n\nDemographic trends characterised by ageing and new migration model\n\nClimate change and its foreseeable effects on the environment, biodiversity and living conditions of the inhabitants\n\nEnergy challenge at the European and worldwide scale. Its specific geographical position in Europe as a transit region but also as an area with unique geographical and natural features\n\nBetter cooperation between the regions and States is needed to tackle those challenges.\n\nThe main added value of the Strategy for the Alpine Region will consist in a new relationship between metropolitan, peri-mountain, and mountain areas. According to the political resolution adopted by the representatives of the 7 Alpine States and 15 Alpine Regions in Grenoble in October 2013, the new strategy will focus on the following 3 thematic priorities:\n\nCompetitiveness and Innovation\n\nEnvironmentally friendly mobility\n\nSustainable management of energy, natural and cultural resources\n\nThe Strategy does not come with extra EU finance but it is supported from the resources already available according to an integrated approach. Countries may also make use of the funding they receive through EU cohesion policy, other EU programmes and financial instruments, and various international financial institutions.\n\nTo know more about financial opportunities visit EuroAccess"
