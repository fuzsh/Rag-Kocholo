The elegant retreat is located in the village of San Cassiano in Badia at 1,537 meters above sea level. Rosa Alpina is an Aman Resorts partner hotel and serves as the perfect base for exploring the Dolomites in the sunshine from June to October, whether hiking, climbing, cycling, sky running, paragliding, mountain biking or simply picnicking. Continuing the Aman story in Italy, this time in the Unesco-protected Dolomites, Aman begins a unique partnership with Rosa Alpina, a family-run mountain retreat. Following in the footsteps of Aman Venice, home to the Arrivabene family for over 200 years, Rosa Alpina will remain under the guidance of the Pizzinini family, who have been firmly at the helm for three generations.For years this elegant, family-run hotel with its renowned 3 Michelin-starred restaurant, expansive spa and generous accommodation has been a home-away-from-home. But it’s not just Rosa Alpina’s exceptional facilities, breathtaking views and quiet glamour that makes it the perfect Aman Partner Hotel: It is the warmth of its discreet service and its timeless sense of peace. Individually decorated with local antiques, Rosa Alpina offers 50 rooms and suites, the exclusive three-bedroom Penthouse and the free-standing, three-bedroom Chalet Zeno with its private outdoor Jacuzzi and sauna. Celebrating local hospitality and refined Alpine style, the hotel's 50 rooms and suites were individually designed with an authentic mountain influence that includes antiques and luxurious materials. There are Ladin style living areas, balconies, and bathrooms with ceramic or marble baths with showers, and some with walk-in showers and double sinks. For dining, the hotel offers three Michelin-starred cuisine at the Restaurant St. Hubertus. Intimate dinners are served at the Fondue Restaurant, and casual dining is offered at the Restaurant Wine Bar & Grill. While Restaurant Limonaia serves an extensive breakfast buffet. Designed for relaxation and energizing workouts, the hotel's spa has a private garden with discreet service, as well as an indoor swimming pool, saunas, and fitness center. During the winter months the property offers ski fittings and ski/snowboard preparation for guests, as well as a shuttle to Piz Sorega Lift Station. While the summer opening offers guests the opportunity to go hiking, mountain biking, road biking, golf, and climbing. Rosa Alpina also provides a variety of family-friendly amenities, including cooking classes, a family pool, in-room amenities, and guided activities. Please note: This property is open seasonally from mid-June to mid-October and mid-December to mid-March."
