        "text": "For over 35 years, and with the same fervor with which we produce our automobiles, we’ve been investing in famous, carefully-chosen wines, procured directly from selected vintners. We base our selections on our experience – thereby fulfilling the highest expectations.\n\nOur range of wine is unique in many respects, composed of rare vintages and excellent wines, representing exceptional value in relation to inherent quality.\n\nNot only top-flight gastronomes are able to enjoy our exquisite wines, private parties have access, as well, and across all national borders.\n\n\"He who is able to enjoy doesn’t drink wine anymore, he tastes secrets.\" (Salvador Dali)\n\nReveal the secrets lying in our wine cellar and enjoy \"savoir vivre\" in its purest form."
