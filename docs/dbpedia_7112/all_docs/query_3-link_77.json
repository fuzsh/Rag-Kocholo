        "text": "In 2019 we hiked the Walker’s Haute Route and this summer, after re-hiking some of the stages, we did the ‘Bear Trek’ in the Bernese Oberland which is part of the Via Alpina 1 hike that includes 20 stages from Lichtenstein and continues to Montreux, Switzerland. Our trip included stages 10 - 15 from Meiringen to Lenk. There are no bears! It’s simply a reference to wilder times in the far past when there would have been bears. Our goal was to do some amazing hiking and take enough time to visit extra natural attractions in the area. All of the stages on the Via Alpina 1 are from valley to valley, so there is always a small village to find lodging. You can do some variations to stay in mountain huts in some areas such as the Gspaltenhornhütte and Blüemlisalphütte.\n\nStage 10: Meiringen to Grindelwald\n\nTo get to this part of the Swiss Alps, we traveled for 3 hours by train from Zermatt to Meiringen and then took the Post Bus up a super windy, steep single-lane mountain road to Schwarzwaldalp. The bus driver blasted his horn before most corners to alert oncoming cars and bikes that he was coming. Quite an experience! Then we started our hike to Grindelwald.\n\nThe hike goes over the pass of Grosse Scheidegg between the Schwarzhorn and Wetterhorn mountains. We opted for the higher trail that contours above the valley to the first gondola station above Grindelwald. It was noticeable that the hiking was in a more pastoral landscape, greener, and less wild than we experienced in the Pennine Alps earlier on this trip. We had our first views of the Eiger, Mönch, and Jungfrau peaks, and the Finsteraarhorn which is the tallest peak in this mountain range. Cindy went out on the First Cliff Walk and then we took the gondola down to our hotel and dinner in the village.\n\nRest Day: With two nights scheduled in Grindelwald, we had a ‘rest day’ to experience the Jungfraujoch – “Top of Europe” at 3454 meters (11,332 feet). What an amazing experience! We took the gondola to the Eiger Glacier viewing area. It was really beautiful but also troubling to see how much the glaciers have melted. We then took the train that tunnels 7 kilometers through the north face of the Eiger mountain to the Jungfraujoch which is a saddle between the Mönch and Jungfrau mountains. The observatory here partners with the one we saw at Gornergrat near Zermatt and has the highest viewing platform for the area. We hiked out on an ice field up to the Mönchsjochhütte so we could have lunch at 3657 meters! (11,965 feet). On the way back to the observatory we saw several large crevasses and a couple of small rockslides. The way back to Grindelwald was on two cogwheel trains: The train through the Eiger tunnel and another one from Kleine Scheidegg through the valley. A really fun day!\n\nStage 11: Grindelwald to Mürren\n\nOn our 3rd day, with a forecast for rain by 11 or 12, we opted to skip hiking to Mürren and took advantage of the Swiss trains and gondolas to get from Grindelwald to Lauterbrunnen and then Mürren. We were worried we wouldn't get to see everything we wanted to see in Mürren and Lauterbrunnen before it clouded up or rained. We left Grindelwald at 8:48 am and were at the top of the Schilthorn by noon! Fantastic Swiss engineering and planning. We took the train to Lauterbrunnen at the bottom of the valley and then a gondola and train up to the top of the cliff on the right side of the valley to Mürren. Our hotel is literally on the cliff and our room looks straight at the Schwarzmönch, Eiger, and Mönch.\n\nWe immediately took another gondola up to the Schilthorn while the weather was good. Outstanding 360-degree views! We could see the Sefinenfurgge pass we'll be hiking over on our next hike. The Schilthorn Piz Gloria is where they filmed the James Bond movie \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\" in 1969. Beautiful views down to Mürren, the Thunsee of Interlaken, the Eiger, Mönch, and Jungfrau peaks, the Lauterbrunnen Breithorn, the Gspaltenhorn, the Blüemlisalp peaks, and more. Luckily the weather held off until around 5 pm, so we had the entire day to enjoy the mountains and valley views!\n\nRest day: With two nights in Mürren, we had a free day to explore the Lauterbrunnen Valley. The barn with the cow bells is in Gimmelwald, another tiny picturesque, classic Swiss village below Mürren. We took the cable car from Gimmelwald down to Stechelberg in the Lauterbrunnen Valley and we could feel the cable car lurch as it went over the edge of the cliff to descend almost vertically to the valley floor. It was a gorgeous day to stroll down the steep-walled valley which is known for its 72 waterfalls!\n\nStage 12: Mürren to Griesalp\n\nAs we started out hiking today, I kept looking back instead of forward. I'd look back to catch one more glimpse of the Wetterhorn, Eiger, and Jungfrau peaks. We could even look up and see the Schilthorn we had visited a few days ago. Eventually, I could no longer see them and started looking ahead to the Gspaltenhorn and the Sefinenfurgge pass we would be crossing.\n\nToday's hike was lovely. We had beautiful weather, gorgeous mountains and saw lots of animals. I'm more inclined to call this the 'Cow Trek\" since we see so many! It seems they are always free-range here.\n\nOur hike took us by the Rotstockhütte just in time for a yummy lunch of soup, rösti, and plum pie. This fueled us for a hike up the very steep pass. Near the top, there were short, steep switchbacks and then ropes and then wood stairs! 95 up to the top of the Sefinenfurgge Pass. There were another 162 stairs down the other side of the pass. The reason for the stairs is that the top of the pass is gritty black shale and scree on a very steep slope that is not stable.\n\nStage 13: Griesalp to Kandersteg (or Oeschinensee)\n\nBut wait....it gets steeper! We thought yesterday's hike was very steep at the final ascent to the pass. Today was even more challenging! From Griesalp, the hike was immediately steep. Approaching the pass, the climb became more severe with a black grit spur eroded with gullies. We gained elevation with every step and could see the Blümlisalp peak and hut above.\n\nThe ascent steepened even more and as I peered around a rock wall corner I was astonished to see timber liners for more wood stairs. First, there were fixed cables and then the stairs began. They were built beneath overhanging craggy rocks and I started to count. There were 567 stairs for the final ascent to the Hohtürli Pass, the highest pass on the Bären Trek at 2778 meters. The views were outstanding and made the effort worthwhile. The snowy peaks of the Blümlisalp dominated and on the hike down the other side, we saw the shrinking Blümlisalp glaciers.\n\nDescending into the valley brought us to the Bärgli hut where we caught our first glimpse over the precipice into the steep-walled basin of Oeschinensee, a beautiful alpine lake. We opted for the high trail with stunning views of the lake and peaks. Lucky for us, we reserved a room with a balcony at the Arva Gasthaus right on the lake. A short rain in the early evening rewarded us with a full rainbow over the lake.\n\nThis was our very last full day of hiking. We said goodbye to the beautiful Lake Oeschinen, watched a rockslide above the lake (!), and started off to Adelboden with a combination of gondolas for the steep, cliff sections and hiking. If you zoom in on the waterfall and cliff photo (right), you'll see people doing a very vertical via Ferrata.\n\nAs we headed up to Bunderchrinde Pass we were caught in some rain which made the very narrow ascending traverse a little bit scary. As soon as we completed that section, the rain stopped and a rainbow appeared! This pass was much different than the last two days, with more gradual, long traverses up the steep parts... no stairs! We hiked up the rest of the way to the pass and enjoyed views back to the lake where we had started and ahead to the Adelboden valley.\n\nAdelboden is a village tiered on the slopes of the valley and is known as a big ski area. In the evening, the church bells rang for 15 minutes straight right outside our hotel!\n\nStage 15: Adelboden to Lenk\n\nFor our last day, we hiked from Adelboden over Hahnenmoospass to Lenk. The pass is part of the ski area and connects Adelboden in the Bernese Oberland to Lenk im Simmental. There are gondolas everywhere in this valley so we hiked, took a gondola, and then hiked the rest of the way to the pass and then down the valley to Lenk. Compared to previous days, this was a pretty easy hike! At the pass, I again saw the colorful Trotti bikes that we've seen at all the ski areas. The Hahnenmoospass has an RC Glider club and many people were out flying their gliders.\n\nWHO ARE WE?\n\nThe Hiking Club empowers anyone to walk the way they want in the wild with personalised self-guided hiking experiences that are easy to find, quick to plan and simple to navigate.\n\nWe believe hiking experiences have the power to transform lives.
