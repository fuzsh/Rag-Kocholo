        "text": "German automotive manufacturer\n\nFor other uses, see Alpina (disambiguation). Not to be confused with Automobiles Alpine.\n\nAlpina Burkard Bovensiepen GmbH & Co. KG is an automobile manufacturing company based in Buchloe, in the Ostallgäu district of Bavaria, Germany that develops and sells high-performance versions of BMW cars. Alpina works closely with BMW and their processes are integrated into BMW's production lines, and is recognized by the German Ministry of Transport as an automobile manufacturer, in contrast to other performance specialists, which are aftermarket tuners. The Alpina B7 is produced at the same assembly line in Dingolfing, Germany (BMW Plant Dingolfing), as BMW's own 7 Series. The B7's twin-turbo 4.4-litre V8 is assembled by hand at Alpina's facility in Buchloe, Germany, before being shipped to BMW for installation, and the assembled vehicle is then sent back to Alpina for finishing touches.[1][2]\n\nThe firm was founded in 1965 by Burkard Bovensiepen (1936–2023),[3] a member of the Bovensiepen family of industrialists. On 10 March 2022, BMW announced its intention to acquire Alpina.[4] That same day, BMW wrote on its website that it had officially acquired the brand.[5]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nAlpina's roots can be traced back to 1962, when Burkard Bovensiepen developed a Weber dual carburetor for the BMW 1500. This carburetor was well received by the automotive press, as well as BMW's own sales boss Paul G. Hahnemann. In 1964, BMW certified the quality of this Alpina product by awarding BMW vehicles fitted with the Alpina system the full factory guarantee.\n\nAlpina Burkard Bovensiepen KG was established on 1 January 1965 in Kaufbeuren, Bavaria. The company had eight employees. Although Alpina started by producing typewriters, the original Alpina ceased to exist at the end of the 1960s in their attempt to move into the textile industry. In 1965, Burkard established a BMW tuning business, following his success with investments in the stock market. He started the tuning business in an outbuilding of the original Alpina typewriter factory. The company worked on carburetors and revised cylinder heads. By 1970, with seventy employees, the original facility changed locations from Kaufbeuren to Buchloe.\n\nIn its first years, Alpina established its core competency by tuning carburetors and crankshafts to extract more power from BMW engines, elements that eventually defined the company's logo, which came into being in 1967. Between 1968 and 1977, Alpina cars did very well in competition. The highlight was in 1970, when the team's cars won the European Touring Car Championship, the German Hillclimb Championship, rally and track racing championships, and the prestigious Spa 24 Hours.\n\nAlpina officially withdrew from racing in 1988 because of capacity limitations and restrictions. Tied to this was the decision to begin production of a new set of BMW Alpina automobiles.[6]\n\nBrand distinctions\n\n[edit]\n\nSince 1983, Alpina has been recognized by the German Federal Ministry of Transport as an automobile manufacturer,[5] thus Alpina-built cars are branded and registered as Alpina instead of BMW, although an Alpina can be serviced at all BMW dealerships, and is fully covered if a warranty issue arises. Alpina automobiles are also sold at some BMW dealerships.\n\nDistinctive features of Alpina vehicles are the fact that these models are literally \"manu-factured\", meaning \"hand-made\". The production process switches between fine tuning the engine, delivering it to the BMW plant, marrying engine and body there, and bringing it back to Alpina for interior upgrade with Alpina's specific components, again all in a hand-made process that allows only limited production numbers. Besides engine and interior, Alpina also optimizes the transmission and installs steering wheel-mounted button shifters (called Switch-Tronic) on most cars, with paddle shifters used on the B4 S Edition 99. This has historic reasons, since Alpina was the first to mount shifting buttons on the steering wheel.[7] Distinguishing marks from the exterior are the 20-spoke alloy wheels with hidden valves under the center cap and the \"Alpina Blue\" or \"Alpina Green\" metallic exterior colours. Inside, \"the finest materials are used to fabricate the exclusive feel\". A typical blue and green pattern is often used on interior parts such as stitching on leather. A thin, pinstriped style outside body decor set in gold or silver is also a hallmark of older Alpina cars which is an option on new Alpina models. Another distinguishing mark is the Alpina wordmark at the bottom of the car's front, a design heralded from its racing cars. A metal plate inside also proves the heritage and the serial number of the car.\n\nCompared to cars from BMW's in-house performance subsidiary, BMW M, Alpina's vehicles have more emphasis on Touring, higher torque, and have their own Alpina-style shiftable ZF automatic transmissions instead of manual or semi-automatic transmissions.[8] For instance, regarding the high performance variants of the BMW E60 5 Series, the B5 offers a different take on performance and how to accomplish it. Unlike BMW M's own M5 which has a naturally aspirated, high-revving 5.0L V10, the Alpina B5 uses a supercharged 4.4L V8 which produces similar horsepower and greater torque at lower rpm.\n\nCurrent lineup\n\n[edit]\n\nAlpina D3 Bi-Turbo Saloon/Touring: based on the BMW F30/F31 3 Series - featuring a 3.0-litre straight-six bi-turbocharged diesel engine, delivering 350 PS (257 kW; 345 hp) / 700 N⋅m (516 lb⋅ft)[9]\n\nAlpina B3 S Bi-Turbo Saloon/Touring: based on the BMW F30/F31 3 Series - featuring a 3.0-litre straight-six bi-turbocharged petrol engine, delivering 440 PS (324 kW; 434 hp) / 660 N⋅m (487 lb⋅ft)[10]\n\nAlpina XD3: based on the BMW G01 X3 - featuring a 3.0-litre straight-six diesel engine:\n\na quad-turbocharged version delivering 388 PS (285 kW; 383 hp) / 770 N⋅m (568 lb⋅ft) (left-hand drive)\n\na bi-turbocharged version delivering 333 PS (245 kW; 328 hp) / 700 N⋅m (516 lb⋅ft) (right-hand drive)\n\nAlpina D4 Bi-Turbo Coupé/Convertible: based on the BMW F32/F33 4 Series - featuring a 3.0-litre straight-six bi-turbo diesel engine, delivering 350 PS (257 kW; 345 hp) / 700 N⋅m (516 lb⋅ft)[11]\n\nAlpina B4 S Bi-Turbo Coupé/Convertible: based on the BMW F32/F33 4 Series - featuring a 3.0-litre straight-six bi-turbocharged engine, delivering 440 PS (324 kW; 434 hp) / 660 N⋅m (487 lb⋅ft)[12]\n\nAlpina B4 S Bi-Turbo Edition 99 Coupé/Convertible: based on the BMW F32/F33 4 Series - featuring a 3.0-litre straight-six bi-turbocharged engine, delivering 452 PS (332 kW; 446 hp) / 680 N⋅m (502 lb⋅ft)[13]\n\nAlpina XD4: based on the BMW G02 X4 - featuring a 3.0-litre quad-turbocharged straight-six diesel engine delivering 388 PS (285 kW; 383 hp) 770 N⋅m (568 lb⋅ft) (right-hand drive only)\n\nAlpina D5 S Saloon/Touring: based on the BMW G30/G31 5 Series - featuring a 3.0-litre straight-six bi-turbocharged diesel engine :\n\ndelivering 388 PS (285 kW; 383 hp) / 800 N⋅m (590 lb⋅ft) (left-hand drive)\n\ndelivering 326 PS (240 kW; 322 hp) / 700 N⋅m (516 lb⋅ft) (right-hand drive)\n\nAlpina B5 Saloon/Touring: based on the BMW G30/G31 5 Series - featuring a 4.4-litre V8 bi-turbocharged engine. 608 PS (447 kW; 600 hp) / 800 N⋅m (590 lb⋅ft)[14]\n\nAlpina B6 Bi-Turbo Coupé/Convertible/Gran Coupé: based on the BMW F06/F12/F13[15] 6 Series - featuring a 4.4 L V8 bi-turbo engine. 600 PS (441 kW; 592 hp) / 800 N⋅m (590 lb⋅ft)[16]\n\nAlpina B8 Gran Coupe: based on the BMW G16 8 Series - featuring a 4.4 L V8 bi-turbo engine. 630 PS (457 kW; 620 hp) / 800 N⋅m (590 lb⋅ft) [17]\n\nAlpina XB7: based on the BMW G07 X7 - featuring a 4.4 L V8 bi-turbo engine. 621 PS (457 kW; 612 hp) / 800 N⋅m (590 lb⋅ft)\n\nAlpina XD3\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Alpina XD3 made its debut at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show.

The engine also utilises new pistons, all of these modifications allow the engine to generate 408 PS (300 kW; 402 hp) between 5,550 and 6,250 RPM and 601 N⋅m (443 lb⋅ft) between 3,000 and 4,000 RPM.\n\nAlpina B5 Bi-Turbo\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Alpina B5 (G30)\n\nThe Alpina B5 was introduced at the 2017 Geneva Motor Show in all-wheel drive Saloon or Touring versions.[24] The B5 features a 4.4-litre N63M30 V8 engine[25] that generates a maximum power output of 447 kW (608 PS; 599 hp) and 800 N⋅m (590 lb⋅ft) of torque.[26] Based on the N63B44O2 V8, it has uprated pistons,[27] new twin-scroll Garrett turbochargers[28] and new spark plugs by NGK. The B5 can accelerate from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 3.5 seconds with a top speed of 330 km/h (205 mph) for the Saloon, and 325 km/h (202 mph) for the Touring, making it the fastest production estate car in production at that time.[29][additional citation(s) needed]\n\nAlpina D5 S\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Alpina B5 (G30)\n\nThe Alpina D5 S debuted at the 2017 Frankfurt Motor Show[30] in all-wheel drive only sedan and Touring variants. The D5 S uses a modified 3.0-liter B57D30 diesel inline-six engine. The engine has three turbochargers and produces 285 kW (387 PS; 382 hp) and 800 N⋅m (590 lb⋅ft) of torque in left-hand drive markets, whereas it has two turbochargers and produces 240 kW (326 PS; 322 hp) and 700 N⋅m (516 lb⋅ft) of torque in right-hand drive markets.[31] The left-hand drive D5 S saloon has a top speed of 286 km/h (178 mph) and a 0–100 km/h (62 mph) acceleration time of 4.4 seconds.[32] Alpina claims it is the fastest diesel-powered production car in the world.[33] The right-hand drive, saloon-only version has a 0–100 km/h (62 mph) acceleration time of 4.9 seconds and a top speed of 275 km/h (171 mph).[34]\n\nAlpina B6 Gran Coupé\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Alpina B6 (F12)\n\nThe high performance Alpina B6 Gran Coupé xDrive was launched in 2014. This model is conceived by Alpina and based on the 650i. This model is sold by BMW only in the United States and in Canada (but Alpina also independently offers it in other countries). The Alpina B6 Gran Coupé 2015 model shares the 540 hp (403 kW; 547 PS), 730 N⋅m (538 lb⋅ft) 4.4-litre twin-turbo V8 of the Alpina B5 BiTurbo and B6 BiTurbo coupé which are not sold in North America. The 2016-2019 model produces 600 hp (447 kW; 608 PS) and 590 lb⋅ft (800 N⋅m) of torque. Specification includes a more luxurious interior, 20-inch Alpina light-alloy wheels, aerodynamic elements and exclusive Alpina trims and paints. The Alpina B6 can go from 0–100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.9 (3.8 for the 2016-2019 model) seconds and has a top speed of 318 km/h (198 mph). (324 km/h or 202 mph for the 2016-2019 model)[35]\n\nAlpina B7\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Alpina B7 (G12)\n\nThe Alpina B7 is one of the two Alpina cars offered in the US and Canada, the other one being the Alpina B6.[36] The B7 is produced at the same assembly line in Dingolfing, Germany, along with BMW's own 7 Series.[citation needed] It can be equipped identically to a normal M760li. However, an exclusive Alpina Green finish is available.[37]\n\nBMW permitted Alpina to produce a high-performance version of its flagship 7 Series, however they did not want it to be a high-revving, BMW M version (which would have been known as a \"BMW M7\" under the current nomenclature). It has also been suggested that there was no market for an M7 that would have featured the BMW M's trademark high-rev engine and twin-clutch automated manual transmission, and most customers who desired a performance option in the 7 Series would have gone for the V12-engined BMW 760Li.[38]\n\nCompetitors include the Mercedes-Benz S63 AMG and Audi S8.[39]\n\nAlpina B7 xDrive\n\nThe Alpina B7 xDrive was announced by BMW North America on 8 February 2016 with sales starting in September 2016. With an electronically limited top speed of 310 km/h (193 mph) and a 0–100 km/h (62 mph) acceleration time of 3.7 seconds along with a sportier setup, it is the sportiest 7 Series[40] but is sold by BMW only in the United States and Canada.[41] The B7 is sold in other countries by Alpina as the B7 Bi-Turbo, with a delimited top speed of 330 km/h (205 mph).\n\nThe Alpina B7 features a 447 kW (608 PS; 599 hp) 4.4 litre twin-turbocharged V8 engine delivering 800 N⋅m (590 lb⋅ft) of torque and a more luxurious interior.[citation needed] It was unveiled at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show.\n\nThe face-lifted model, unveiled in February 2019, has a better power band which allows better performance, with a 0–100 km/h (62 mph) acceleration time of 3.6 seconds. The top speed of 330 km/h (205 mph) is now delimited worldwide.[42]\n\nPrevious models\n\n[edit]\n\nPetrol-engine\n\n[edit]\n\nAlpina Previous Models (Petrol engines)[43][44] Alpina model BMW donor model Alpina Engine Power at rpm Torque at rpm Production A1/3 E21 320 A1/3 90 kW (122 PS;

The C1 2.3 made 125 kW (168 hp) and 225 N⋅m (166 lb⋅ft) of torque. 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) is achieved in 7.8 seconds. Top speed was 213 km/h (132 mph).[47] The extra power is due to special Mahle pistons, and a special exhaust and ignition system. It also received dry-sump lubrication and a short-ratio five-speed gearbox.[47] Only 35 C1 cars were built, making it one of the rarest Alpina models. As BMW released the 325i, Alpina responded with the C2 2.5, and later the 2.7 models, providing between 190–210 hp (142–157 kW). The brakes and suspension were also upgraded.\n\nThe C1 2.5 and early C2 / 2.6* models used the M20B23 (2,3L) engine, but bore and stroke were increased to achieve a displacement of 2552 cm3. Alpina reworked the head which was ported and polished, installed harder valve springs and a hotter cam. The intake manifold was also reworked, and Alpina used a larger throttle body. It produced 136 kW (182 hp), with 246 N⋅m (181 lb⋅ft) of torque. Alpina claimed 0–100 km/h (62 mph) acceleration in 7.1 seconds. Top speed was 220 km/h (137 mph). Production is unclear, with estimates ranging from 35 cars built to around 400 depending on the source.[48]\n\nAlpina C2\n\n[edit]\n\nAn interesting variant of the M20 engine was Alpina's C2. The first C2 combined the wider bore of the M20B25 with the slightly larger 76.8 mm (3.02 in) crankshaft of an M20B23, to create a torquier engine of 2552 cc. This version put out 185 PS (136 kW; 182 hp) and 265 N⋅m (195 lb⋅ft), 74 units were built between 1985 and November 1986.[49][50] After the C2 2.7 appeared in the spring of 1986, the 2.5 was slightly upgraded and gained 5 horsepower. However, to indicate its \"little brother\" position in the lineup, the name was changed to C1 2.5. When the September 1987 facelift model of the E30 was introduced, the 2.5 litre C1 was discontinued, although a few cars were finished into 1988.\n\nThe larger yet 2.7 litre unit was introduced in February 1986 in uncatalyzed C2/1 form.[50] This engine, sharing the dimensions of the M20B27, develops 210 PS (154 kW; 207 hp) at 5800 rpm and shows what the engine was really capable of.[51] Originally installed in the E30-based Alpina C2 2.7, with available four-wheel drive, the catalyzed C2/2 appeared in the interim C2 2.7 Kat in March 1987. This was then renamed \"B3 2.7\" five months later, by which time the \"C2\" labelled cars were discontinued. The B3 2.7 continued to be available until June 1992, in all body variants and drivetrain configurations (excepting automatics) in which the E30 was offered.[50] Around 1986, 67 \"B6 2.7\"-labelled C2-engined E30s were built for export to Japan, where the larger 3.0 L B6 3.5 had a hard time passing emissions regulations. Aside from the C2 drivetrain, the B6 2.7 is cosmetically identical to the B6 3.5.[52]\n\nLater C2 2.5 models (C2 /3 2.5) were based on the 325i. Alpina used the M20B25 engine with very few modifications compared to earlier models. Again the cylinder head was decked to increase compression ratio, and it was ported and polished. The ECU was also remapped. Max power is 140 kW (188 hp), with 235 N⋅m (173 lb⋅ft) of torque. 0–100 km/h (62 mph) was achieved in 7.2 seconds. Top speed is 220 km/h (137 mph). Only 50 cars were built.[citation needed]\n\nThe C2 /1 2.7 used the 325e eta model engine block, crank and rods, but with custom flat head pistons provided by Mahle. Originally Alpina modified the \"200\" casting number cylinder head specific to the 325e with bigger intake valves, larger air intake ports, and redesigned the valve chamber for better flow. A more aggressive camshaft was used, with higher lift and duration, and harder valve springs were installed. Compression ratio was increased to 10.2:1. The C2/1 2.7 made 210 bhp (157 kW) with 267 N⋅m (197 lb⋅ft) of torque and was the fastest E30 available at the time[citation needed] (227 km/h (141 mph) top speed). 108 cars were built.[citation needed]\n\nLater C2 /2 2.7 (and early 1987 B3 2.7) used the M20B25 block with ETA (325e) crank and rods. The intake manifold was also redesigned for better flow. The head was decked to improve compression ratio (10.1:1 for models with the 731 head, 9.6:1 for later \"885\" head models with catalytic converter) and matched with custom pistons - flat Mahle pistons for engines equipped with the 731 head, and domed KS pistons for engines equipped with the 885 head. Larger throttle bodies were installed (the C2/2 version uses the same throttle body as the M20B25 325i). A total of 309 cars were built between 1986 and 1987. The C2/2 2.7 makes 204 bhp (152 kW) and 266 N⋅m (196 lb⋅ft) of torque. Top speed is 224 km/h (139 mph) and 0–100 km/h (62 mph) is achieved in 7.5 seconds.\n\nThe B3 2.7 is similar to late C2/2 2.7 cars. It uses the M20B25 block with M20B27 crank and custom rods. The 885 head is exclusively used for the B3 model. The head is decked ~ 1 mm to improve CR to 9.6:1 and matched with custom domed KS or Mahle pistons. Intake and cylinder head are ported and polished. Custom ECU mapping is used. Engine management is Bosch Motronic 1.3. The B3 2.7 is equipped with a catalytic converter to conform to emission standard of the time. Performance numbers are similar to the later C2/2 2.7 cars. 254 cars were built from 1987 to 1992.\n\nAlpina B6\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Alpina B6 2.8 is based on the 323i, but uses the same B6/2 engine used in the B6 E21. The car makes 210 bhp (157 kW) and 270 N⋅m (199 lb⋅ft) of torque. Top speed is 230 km/h (143 mph). 0–100 km/h (62 mph) is achieved in 7.2 seconds. 533 cars were made from 1983 to 1986.[53]\n\nThe Alpina B6 3.5 is based on the 325i chassis, but uses the M30 \"big six\" 3430 cm3 engine, upgraded to 261 bhp (195 kW) and 346 N⋅m (255 lb⋅ft) of torque. 0–100 km/h (62 mph) is achieved in 6.4 seconds. The engine uses custom Mahle pistons and rods. The cylinder head was ported and polished, and a hotter cam was used. Top speed is 250 km/h (155 mph). Suspension and brakes were upgraded. Bigger ventilated disks and progressive springs were installed at the front. Only 210 cars were made from 1986 to 1990.[citation needed] The B6 3.5 was sold in Japan as the B6 2.7 and used the 2.7 L engine from the Alpina C2 as the larger 3.0 L engine was unable to pass emissions.[54]\n\nThe Alpina B6 3.5 S uses the M3 chassis. The 3.5 S, like the 3.5, uses the B10/2 M30 \"big six\" which makes 261 bhp (195 kW) and 346 N⋅m (255 lb⋅ft) of torque. Displacement is 3430 cm3. 0–100 km/h (62 mph) is achieved in 6.4 seconds. Top speed is 250 km/h (155 mph). The gearbox used is the Getrag 260/6 sport, known as a dog-leg gearbox. Only 62 cars were made from 1987 to 1990.[55]\n\nThe E30 BMW 333i was developed by Alpina for BMW South Africa. It was based on the 325i chassis and M30B32 engine, with numerous Alpina components common to the B6. Customers had to choose between power steering or air conditioning because of limited space in the engine bay.\n\nAlpina B3 GT3\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Alpina B3 (E90)\n\nTo celebrate Alpina's victory in the 2011 ADAC GT Masters with an Alpina B6 GT3, Alpina decided to produce a limited run of the Alpina B3 S Bi-Turbo, called the Alpina B3 GT3.[56] The B3 GT3 features a new exhaust system developed in collaboration with Akrapovič which is 11 kg (24 lb) lighter than the standard exhaust and increases power to 300 kW (408 PS; 402 bhp) and 398 lb⋅ft (540 N⋅m) of torque. It features upgraded brakes with 380 mm discs, a Drexler limited slip differential and fully adjustable coilovers by KW at all four corners.[57][58]\n\nThe most noticeable changes were on the exterior: The B3 GT3 sports a carbon fibre rear wing, a special front splitter and 19\" lightweight Alpina GT3 Classic wheels, painted in Himalaya Grey. The B3 GT3 was available in Black Sapphire metallic, Mineral White metallic, Alpina Blue metallic or with a full body vinyl wrap in the official GT3 design. The car could be ordered with an extra set of lightweight wheels (also 19\" Alpina GT3 Classic, but equipped with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup+ tires) for use on the track.\n\nOnly 99 units were produced.[57]\n\n5 Series based Alpinas\n\n[edit]\n\nE12 B2\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Alpina B2 is based on the 1976 BMW 5 Series (E12) 528i. The car featured a bored-out 230 hp (233 PS; 172 kW) 3.0-liter straight-six fitted with three double barrel carburetors.[59] Only eleven B2 were built before the introduction of the B7.[60]\n\nE12 B7 Turbo / B7 S Turbo\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Alpina B7 Turbo is based on the BMW 5 Series (E12) 528i like its predecessor the B2. From 1978 to 1982 it featured a B7 engine with 221 kW (300 PS; 296 bhp) at 6,000 rpm and 462 N⋅m (341 ft⋅lbf) at 3,000 rpm. In 1981, Alpina introduced the B7 S Turbo with 243 kW (330 PS; 326 bhp) at 5,800 rpm and 500 N⋅m (369 ft⋅lbf) at 3,000 rpm. Only sixty B7 S Turbos were produced.[61][62]\n\nE28 B9\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Alpina B9 was built in a small series from November 1981 to December 1985 on the basis of the BMW E28. About 500 examples were produced.[63]\n\nChanges\n\n[edit]\n\nThe B9 is based on the 528i, whose M30-2.8-litre BMW engine was replaced by a 3.45-litre. Alpina tuned engine. The motor is based on the 3.5-liter version of the M30, but has been extensively modified. Alpina replaced the cylinder head, pistons, camshaft and modified the Bosch Motronic ECU. The engine transmits its power to the rear wheels via a 5-speed gearbox, an automatic transmission was also available. The suspension of the E28 has been modified with Bilstein gas dampers, as standard the B9 was delivered with 16-inch wheels (see picture). Alpina also modified the interior with among other things, Recaro seats, a new shifter and a modified instrument cluster.[63]\n\nTechnical specifications\n\n[edit]\n\nB9 3.5 B9 3.5 / 1 Production period 11/1981 – 08/1983 01/1983 – 12/1985 Motor type B9 Design Inline-six Displacement 3453 cm3 3430 cm3 Power 180 kW (245 PS; 241 hp) at 5,700 rpm Torque 320 N⋅m (236 ft⋅lbf) at 4,500 rpm Acceleration 0–100 km/h (62 mph) 6.7 s Top speed 240 km/h (149 mph) Source [64]\n\nE28 B10\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1985, Alpina launched the B10 3.5, based on the BMW 535i (E28).\n\nThe 3.5 liter six-cylinder engine from the B6 3.5 was fitted to replace the B9's 3.45 liter. The output was 192 kW (261 PS; 257 hp). Only 77 examples of the B10 3.5 were produced.\n\nTechnical specifications\n\n[edit]\n\nModel B10 3,5[65] Platform BMW 535i E28 Production period 7/1985–12/1987 Displacement 3430 cm3 Engine architecture Inline-six Power 192 kW (261 PS; 257 hp) at 5,700 rpm Torque 346 N⋅m (255 lb⋅ft) at 4,000 rpm Transmission 5-speed manual transmission, or a 4-speed automatic transmission (optional) Acceleration,\n\n0–100 km/h (62 mph) 6.4 s Top speed 250 km/h (155 mph) (automatic: 245 km/h (152 mph)) Production 77[66]\n\nE34 B10\n\n[edit]\n\nB10 3.5\n\n[edit]\n\nThe B10 3.5 was the first Alpina based on the BMW E34, With production beginning in April 1988 at launch it was the only available B10. The 3.5-liter BMW M30 inline-six cylinder engine of the BMW 535i was reworked with Mahle pistons, a modified cylinder-head, and a new camshaft increasing power from 155 kW (208 hp) to 187 kW (254 PS). In 1992 production was stopped after 572 cars were made.[67]\n\nB10 4.0\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1993 the BMW M30 ended production forcing Alpina to discontinue the B10 3.5 and B10 BiTurbo. In April 1993 Alpina launched their replacement, the first B10 with an eight-cylinder engine. The BMW M60 engine of the BMW 540i was modified with higher-compression Mahle pistons and a modified air intake. Power was increased from 210 kW (286 PS) to 232 kW (311 hp). 49 examples were built.[68]\n\nB10 3.0 Allrad\n\n[edit]\n\nThe B10 3.0 Allrad was based on the all-wheel drive BMW 525ix, launched in October 1993. The displacement of the six-cylinder single-VANOS and four-valve engine was increased from 2.5 liters to 3.0 liters and the performance was increased from 141 kW (192 PS) to 170 kW (231 PS). 64 sedans and 70 tourings were produced.\n\nB10 4.6\n\n[edit]\n\nThe B10 4.6 replaced the B10 biturbo from March 1994 onwards. The engine was a re-designed and enlarged V8 with a displacement of 4.6 liters, which was also used in the E36 Alpina B8 4.6 With 250 kW (340 PS), the power was only just below the B10 Bi-Turbo. 27 saloon cars were produced, and 19 Tourings - all were left hand drive except one right hand drive Touring.\n\nTechnical specifications\n\n[edit]\n\nModel B10 3.5[69] B10 Biturbo[69] B10 3.0 Allrad / Touring[69] B10 4.0 / Touring[69] B10 4.6 / Touring[69] Platform BMW 535i E34 BMW 525ix E34 BMW 540i E34 Production period 4/1988 – 12/1992 8/1989 – 3/1994 10/1993 – 5/1996 4/1993 – 8/1995 3/1994 – 4/1996 Displacement 3430 cm3 2997 cm3 3982 cm3 4619 cm3 Engine architecture Inline six V8 Power 187 kW (254 PS; 251 hp) 265 kW (360 PS; 355 hp) 170 kW (231 PS; 228 hp) 232 kW (315 PS; 311 hp) 250 kW (340 PS; 335 hp) Torque 325 N⋅m (240 ft⋅lbf) 520 N⋅m (384 ft⋅lbf) 312 N⋅m (230 ft⋅lbf) 410 N⋅m (302 ft⋅lbf) 480 N⋅m (354 ft⋅lbf) Acceleration,\n\n0–100 km/h (62 mph) 6.4 s 5.6 s 7.9 / 8.4 s 6.5 / 6.7 s 6.1 / 6.2 s Top speed 250 km/h (155 mph) over 290 km/h (180 mph) 235 / 230 km/h (146 / 143 mph) 268 / 263 km/h (167 / 163 mph) over 275 / 270 km/h (171 / 168 mph)\n\nE34 B10 BiTurbo\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Alpina B10 Bi-Turbo\n\nThe B10 BiTurbo is a high performance version of the BMW 5 Series E34. Beginning production in 1989, the B10 BiTurbo was based on the 535i and received several upgrades by Alpina, being the fastest production saloon in the world at the time of its introduction, as tested by Road & Track.[70] Production ended in 1994 with 507 examples produced, almost as many as the B10 3.5.\n\nE39 B10\n\n[edit]\n\nThe B10 was built as a sedan and touring based on the BMW E39 from January 1997 to May 2004.[71]\n\nIn February 2000, Alpina introduced the Alpina D10 Biturbo, the first six-cylinder diesel model produced by Alpina. The engine, a 3.0 litre twin turbocharged unit with 182 kW (247 PS) and 500 N⋅m (369 lb⋅ft) of torque, was based on the engine of the BMW 530d.[71] It was at the time the most powerful diesel saloon in the world. High-pressure common-rail injection technology (the famous Bosch CP3 high-pressure pump) has revolutionized the diesel industry.\n\nEngines\n\n[edit]\n\nThe third generation of the B10 was built with both six-cylinder and V8 engines.\n\nThe six-cylinder engines with 3.2 and 3.3 liters displacement were based on the 528i and the 530i.[71] For the 3.3 liter engine the engine block was bored to increase displacement to 3298 cubic centimeters. The cylinder head was machined and a modified crankshaft was added, different pistons and camshafts were also used. A modified intake system enabled a higher rate of air flow, as well as a stainless steel exhaust system (Alpina-Bosal) with metal catalytic converters. The engine control unit was also completely revised, which increased the power to 206 kW (280 PS; 276 hp).[72]\n\nThe two V8 engines with 4.6 (B10 V8) and 4.8 liters (B10 V8S) come from the BMW 540i. Again, a larger displacement was achieved by boring the engine block, which, together with other modifications, increased the power to 250 kW (340 PS), then to 255 kW (347 PS) for the 4.6 liter engine,[73] and 276 kW (375 PS) through an increased stroke with the 4.8 liter engine.[74]\n\nSuspension\n\n[edit]\n\nThe original suspension from the BMW E39 has been reworked for the B10. Changes include modified springs and tuned shock absorbers from Sachs that help lower the car.\n\nTechnical data\n\n[edit]\n\nModel Engine Power Torque Years B10 3.2 BMW M52\n\nI6 191 kW (260 PS; 256 hp)\n\nat 5,900 rpm 330 N⋅m (243 ft⋅lbf)\n\nat 4,300 rpm 8/1997–12/1998 B10 3.3 BMW M52\n\nI6 206 kW (280 PS; 276 hp)\n\nat 6,200 rpm 335 N⋅m (247 ft⋅lbf)\n\nat 4,500 rpm 2/1999–10/2003 B10 V8 M62B46\n\nV8 250 kW (340 PS; 335 hp) 470 N⋅m (347 ft⋅lbf) 1/1997–10/1998 B10 V8 M62TUB46\n\nV8 255 kW (347 PS; 342 hp) 480 N⋅m (354 ft⋅lbf) 10/1998–9/2002 B10 V8S Alpina F5\n\nV8 280 kW (381 PS; 375 hp) 519 N⋅m (383 ft⋅lbf) 1/2002–5/2004 D10 Biturbo M57D30\n\nI6 180 kW (245 PS; 241 hp) 500 N⋅m (369 ft⋅lbf) 4/2000–10/2003\n\nE60 B5\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Alpina B5 (E60)\n\nThe BMW E60 and the 4.4-liter BMW N62 engine from the 545i serve as the basis for the Alpina B5, which uses the same H1 supercharged engine as the E65 B7. Compared to the E60, the B5 has larger brakes, a new suspension with Electronic Damper Control, a stainless steel silencing system with polished double tailpipes and the typical Alpina changes to the interior and exterior.\n\nThe B5 was made from February 2005 to September 2007 and the B5 S was made from September 2007 to May 2010.\n\nDrivetrain\n\n[edit]\n\nThe N62B44's output is increased by means of a centrifugal supercharger. The supercharger is made by the company ASA, and is also called \"Turbessor\" because it is able to combine the advantages of turbocharger and supercharger. At low speeds, it spontaneously responds as a conventional displacement compressor, but it can also immediately provide the thrust of a turbo. It also reaches speeds of more than 100,000 revolutions per minute. As compared to the 545i performance has increased from 245 kW (333 PS; 329 hp) to 368 kW (500 PS; 493 hp),[75] torque was increased from 450 N⋅m (332 ft⋅lbf) to 700 N⋅m (516 ft⋅lbf).[75] The power is transmitted to the rear wheels by means of a six-speed automatic transmission (6HP 26). As usual with Alpina, this was refined and has \"Switch-Tronic\".[76]\n\nTechnical data\n\n[edit]\n\nAlpina B5 Sedan Touring Displacement 4398 cm3 Compression ratio 9,0:1 Horsepower 368 kW (500 PS; 493 hp) at 5500–6000 rpm Torque 700 N⋅m (516 ft⋅lbf) at 4250–4850 rpm Transmission 6-Speed Automatic \"Switch-Tronic\" Top speed 314 km/h (195 mph) 310 km/h (193 mph) Acceleration 0–100 km/h (62 mph) 4.7 s 4.8 s Empty weight 1,720 kg (3,792 lb) 1,810 kg (3,990 lb)\n\nNote\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2005, an Alpina B5 Touring was tested by Auto, Motor und Sport on the Nardò Ring. The B5 reached a top speed of 319 km/h (198 mph).[77]\n\nAlpina B5 S\n\n[edit]\n\nAt the 2007 Frankfurt Motor Show (IIA), Alpina presented the revised B5 S. [78]\n\nEngine\n\n[edit]\n\nThe motor's combustion process was optimized by changing the camshaft. This resulted in a significantly lower exhaust gas temperature, which is the basis for the performance increase. The power of the 4.4-liter V8 was thus increased by 22 kW (30 PS; 30 hp) to 390 kW (530 PS; 523 hp). The torque increased by 25 N⋅m (18 ft⋅lbf) to 725 N⋅m (535 ft⋅lbf). The B5 S takes the sprint to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.6 seconds; The top speed increases to 317 km/h (197 mph).[75]\n\nTransmission\n\n[edit]\n\nOne innovation is the ZF six-speed Sport-Switch-Tronic transmission. The switching time was reduced by 50% compared to the predecessor. The reaction time is 1/10 s. In manual mode, the driving feeling is similar to the shift dynamics of a dual clutch transmission.\n\nChassis\n\n[edit]\n\nA further feature is the EDC suspension tuning with the company Sachs Race Engineering.\n\nTechnical data\n\n[edit]\n\nAlpina B5S Sedan Touring Displacement 4398 cm3 Compression ratio 9,0:1 Horsepower 390 kW (530 PS; 523 hp) at 5500 rpm Torque 725 N⋅m (535 ft⋅lbf) at 4750 rpm Transmission 6-Speed Automatic \"Switch-Tronic\" Top speed 317 km/h (197 mph) 313 km/h (194 mph) Acceleration 0–100 km/h (62 mph) 4.6 s 4.7 s Empty weight 1,720 kg (3,792 lb) 1,810 kg (3,990 lb)\n\nF10 B5\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Alpina B5 (F10)\n\nAlpina produced two variants based on the BMW 5 Series (F10), the petrol-engined B5 and diesel-engined D5.\n\nB5 Bi-Turbo\n\n[edit]\n\nThe B5 is based on the 550i and is powered by an Alpina-modified version of the BMW N63 twin-turbo V8 engine. The original B5, which was unveiled at the 2010 Goodwood Festival of Speed, produced 373 kW (507 PS) and 700 N⋅m (516 lb⋅ft). The transmission is an 8-speed automatic.[79]\n\nAlpina unveiled an updated B5 at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show. Power had been uprated to 397 kW (540 PS) and torque to 730 N⋅m (538 lb⋅ft).[80] During 2015, Alpina sold the B5 Bi-Turbo Edition 50, which marked the company's 50th year in operation. The Edition 50 uses an upgraded engine which produces 441 kW (600 PS) and 800 N⋅m (590 lb⋅ft).[81] The standard B5 received this same engine for the B5's last year of production, 2016.[82][83][84]\n\nD5 Bi-Turbo\n\n[edit]\n\nThe D5 Bi-Turbo is based on the 535d. It is powered by Alpina-modified version of the BMW N57 turbo straight-6 engine, which produces 257 kW (349 PS) and 700 N⋅m (516 lb⋅ft) of torque.[84]\n\nG30 B5\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Alpina B5 (G30)\n\nThe third generation B5 is based on the BMW 5 Series (G30), and is available in both saloon and wagon bodystyles.\n\n7 Series based Alpinas\n\n[edit]\n\nE38 B12\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Alpina B12\n\nBased on the BMW 750i and 750iL, Alpina released the B12 5.7 in 1995 and the B12 6.0 in 1999. In contrast to the cars they are based on, these models are not electronically limited to a top speed of 250 km/h (155 mph), but are able to reach top speeds of more than 280 km/h (174 mph) and 291 km/h (181 mph), respectively.[85] According to Alpina the B12 5.7 was the world's first vehicle with an electrically heated metal catalyst as standard.[86] The B12 5.7 has a 5.7 litre V12 and the B12 6.0 has a 6.0 litre V12.\n\nModel Engine Power[85] Torque Years[87] Production[88] B12 5.7 V12 285 kW (387 PS; 382 hp) 560 N⋅m (413 lb⋅ft) 12/1995–08/1998 202 B12 6.0 V12 316 kW (430 PS; 424 hp) 600 N⋅m (443 lb⋅ft) 07/1999–07/2001 94\n\nE65 B7\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Alpina B7 (E65)\n\nFor the E65 7 Series generation, the Alpina B7 was widely credited with being able to hold its own against top performing offerings from Mercedes (including AMG) such as the S600 and S63 AMG, Audi (particularly quattro's Audi S8), the Bentley Flying Spur, and Jaguar XJ Supercharged, while BMW's own top-of-the-line V12 760Li was considered uncompetitive.[89]\n\nThe E65 B7 uses a supercharged version of the 4.4-litre V8 found in the BMW 745i as the 750i and its 4.8-litre engine were not around when development began.[89] The 760Li's naturally aspirated 6.0-litre V12 was deemed too heavy to have a sporty offshoot.[8][90][91] The 2011 Alpina B7, with its twin-turbo 4.4-litre V8 engine and 6-speed automatic transmission, is less expensive and yet faster than its F01 stablemate, the 2010 BMW 760Li powered by a twin-turbo 6.0-litre V12 mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission. The B7's engine, derived from the BMW N63 that is found in the standard BMW lineup, matches the BMW 750i in fuel economy despite increased performance, plus its lighter weight than the 760Li's V12 engine gives the B7 considerably better weight distribution and handling than the 760Li.[1][2]\n\nBMW of North America, LLC offered 800 Alpina B7s as limited edition models for 2007 and 2008, all of which quickly sold out.[92]\n\nF01/F02 B7\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Alpina B7 (F01)\n\nThe F01 B7 will be offered again for the 2011 model year in the US, with approximately 500 vehicles (half of the annual production of the B7) with a choice of rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive and/or a standard or long wheelbase (the B7, B7 L (long wheelbase), B7 xDrive (all-wheel drive), and B7 L xDrive), otherwise all configurations have the same equipment.[93][94] Roughly 80 models will be sold in Canada, all of the xDrive variety due to that country's winter weather.[38]\n\nThe B7's twin-turbo 4.4-litre V8 is assembled by hand at Alpina's facility in Buchloe, Germany, before being shipped to BMW for installation, and the assembled vehicle is then sent back to Alpina for finishing touches.[1][2] It is based upon BMW's twin-turbo V8 but produces considerable more torque and horsepower, albeit with some turbo lag due to the larger turbos, yet more measured throttle mapping makes the B7 smoother than a stock BMW 750i.[95]\n\nWhile BMW uses run-flat tires for its 7 Series, the B7 comes with non-reinforced tires with a tire repair kit for emergencies. By using conventional, softer-sidewalled tires, compared to the reinforced sidewalls of run-flats, Alpina engineers were able to stiffen the B7's suspension for better handling and still improve the ride quality over that of a stock BMW 750i.[38]\n\nFor the 2013 model year, the Alpina B7 received similar updates to the rest of the 7 Series lineup, including an 8-speed automatic transmission, while its engine adds Valvetronic and now produces 540 hp (403 kW; 547 PS) and 538 lb⋅ft (729 N⋅m), which is good for a 0–100 km/h (62 mph) time of 4.3 seconds and a top speed of 300 km/h (186 mph). Compared to BMW M's version of the 4.4L twin-turbo engine (such as found in the F10 M5), Alpina's engine has 20 hp (15 kW; 20 PS) less but more maximum torque which is also available at a lower rpm.[38]\n\nIn a comparison of the 2013 BMW 7 series and the Alpina B7, Motor Trend stated the B7 handled better than the BMW 760iL, but not as well as the 750iL.[96]\n\nG12 B7\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Alpina B7 (G12)\n\nThe all new 2019 B7 based on the G11/G12 BMW 7 Series and features a 4.4L V8 producing 608 hp (453 kW; 616 PS) and 590 lb⋅ft (800 N⋅m) of torque. The B7 can accelerate from 0-60 mph (97 km/h) in 3.6 seconds and reach a top speed of 205 mph (330 km/h).[97]\n\n8 Series based Alpinas\n\n[edit]\n\nE31 B12\n\n[edit]\n\nB12 5.0\n\n[edit]\n\nThe B12 5.0 was built from 1990 to 1994 and is based on the BMW E31 850i. It is powered by an Alpina modified BMW M70 V12 (shared with the E32 B12 5.0) producing 257 kW (349 PS; 345 hp) and mated to an automatic transmission.\n\nB12 5.7\n\n[edit]\n\nThe B12 5.7 was available from 1992 and is based on the 850CSi. It is powered by an increased displacement version of the BMW S70 V12 with a modified intake, crankshaft. camshafts and a stainless steel exhaust system as well as a six speed manual gearbox with an optional system called Shift-Tronic that automatically actuates the clutch when shifting and allows the vehicle to creep in traffic,[98] 32 B12 5.7s were equipped with Shift-Tronic.[99] it produced 306 kW (416 PS; 410 hp). The carbon-fibre hood has cooling vents and a NACA duct.\n\nG16 B8\n\n[edit]\n\nB8 Gran Coupé\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Alpina B8 Gran Coupé was available in 2021 and is based on the BMW M850i and M8 Gran Coupé's respectively. Powered by an Alpina tuned version of BMW's S63 4.4L V8 Bi-Turbo, the B8 produces 630 PS (463 kW; 621 hp) and 800 N⋅m (590 lbf⋅ft) of torque. Alpina tuned suspension and handling provided drivers with a Comfort+ and Sport+ mode for ideal ride comfort and performance. The exterior sports Alpina Classic 21 inch wheels featuring 20 spokes per wheel, Alpina designed front and rear bumpers, and a choice of Alpina blue or green metallic paint. The interior features Alpina trim appointments, custom Alpina leather upholstery, and or BMW Individual trims and upholstery.[100]\n\nTechnical data\n\n[edit]\n\nModel Engine Power Torque Years Production B12 5.0 V12 257 kW (349 PS; 345 hp) 470 N⋅m (347 lb⋅ft) 6/1990-5/1994 97 B12 5.7 V12 306 kW (416 PS; 410 hp) 570 N⋅m (420 lb⋅ft) 11/1992-11/1996 57\n\nAlpina Roadster V8\n\n[edit]\n\nWith production of the BMW Z8 completed by November 2002, for 2003 the Z8 production was replaced by the Alpina Roadster V8.[101] The Alpina was a departure from the hard-edged sporting focus of the original car, and elements of the new grand touring intent were evident throughout this final edition.\n\nInstead of the original six-speed manual and 4.9 L (S62) engine featured in Z8's, the Alpina came only as an automatic, using a five-speed BMW Steptronic transmission mated to a 4.8 L Alpina-tuned V8 motor from the Alpina E39 B10 V8 S (Alpina F5). In order to complete the car's transition from sports car to Alpina, relaxed suspension tuning was used. The standard Z8's run-flat tires on 18 in (46 cm) wheels were discarded in favor of conventional tires with softer sidewalls, on 20 in (51 cm) wheels.\n\nA new, softer grade of Nappa leather replaced the Z8's less supple specification, and special Alpina gauges were featured on the dash cluster. An Alpina steering wheel with three solid spokes replaced the original, which could not be retrofitted with shift paddles for the automatic. Gear selection was displayed in an Alpina-specific display mounted in front of the wheel.\n\nPerformance of the Alpina V8 differed from that of the standard car in that peak power was reduced to 381 PS (280 kW) while peak torque was raised to 520 N⋅m (384 lb⋅ft); this torque was available at significantly lower rpm than the original in order to enable more relaxed cruising. Curiously, the electronically limited top speed was officially raised to 260 km/h (160 mph), rather than the 250 km/h (160 mph) that most cars are limited to.[101]\n\nOnly 555 of these Alpinas were built, 450 of which were exported to the U.S. market and only eight to the UK.[102] In the United States, this special edition of the Z8 was sold directly through BMW dealerships, marking a first for Alpina, whose cars had never been sold through retail channels in the U.S.\n\nGallery\n\n[edit]\n\n1974 BMW 3.0 CS 'Alpina' profile view\n\n1974 BMW 3.0 CS 'Alpina' interior\n\n1984 BMW Alpina B7 Turbo Coupé / 1\n\nAlpina C2 2.7 Allrad\n\nAlpina C2 2.7 Allrad\n\n1992 Alpina B10 BiTurbo\n\nAlpina Deco stripe\n\nAlpina wheel\n\nAlpina B5 (2005) engine bay\n\nAlpina B6 S\n\nAlpina D3 Bi-Turbo\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nABT, similar marque specializing on high-performance Audi models.\n\nBrabus, similar marque specializing on high-performance Mercedes-Benz models.\n\nLister, similar marque specializing on high-performance Jaguar models.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
