A backcountry XC boot that isn't overkill, a nice blend of solid binding connection, stability from a torsionally stiff sole, great ankle support, and best of all not overly stiff and clunky. A BC boot one can actually stride instead of being forced to ski like one would imagine Frankenstein would.\n\nTourer Free is a higher volume fit, Tourer Free is a lower volume fit\n\nWhile there is overlap, consider the Tourer Light as a women's fit and the Free as a men's or women's wide fit\n\nCompatible only with the Rottefella NNN-BC binding\n\nSynthetic leather upper is durable and weatherproof\n\nA close, supportive, and comfortable fit that needs minimal break in"
