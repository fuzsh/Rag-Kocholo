A Z8 with an automatic\n\ntransmission? A new Z8 powered not by the BMW M engine, but rather by a\n\nspecially developed, higher-performance version of BMW's \"regular\" V-8 engine?\n\nA new Z8 with 20-inch wheels and tires in place of the original model's\n\n18-inchers?\n\nYes, it's all true, and there's quite a story here. For starters, this new Z8\n\nis not only from BMW, but also from ALPINA. Located in the Upper Bavarian town\n\nof Buchloe, ALPINA was established in 1964 as an official and approved\n\n\"ennobler\" of BMW automobiles - and with that word, we unabashedly translate\n\ndirectly from the German word Veredler, which tells us that ALPINA is not\n\nconcerned merely with making BMWs go faster and look racier. Instead, ALPINA's\n\ntradition is to take production BMWs and make them even more appealing to\n\nconnoisseurs of automotive finery. Performance finery, we must add, as ALPINA's\n\ntreatments include not merely cosmetic modifications but also a palette of\n\npowertrain and chassis refinements that consistently enhance BMW models'\n\nalready formidable road capabilities within a context of thorough engineering\n\nand mature character.\n\nThe character of ALPINA is the character of founder Burkard Bovensiepen, who is\n\nbest described as an epicure within whose range of interests and passions motor\n\nvehicles also fall: Bovensiepen is also a connoisseur (and distributor) of fine\n\nwines; a gourmet; and.... (More to come on ALPINA and Mr. Bovensiepen.)\n\nWith this latest creation, which amounts to an exclusive and unique ALPINA\n\nre-interpretation of the Z8 roadster, Bovensiepen's team of automotive\n\nennoblers has added its unique touch to an already classic creation, and has\n\ndone so with the skill and maturity of the seasoned automotive gourmet. The BMW\n\nALPINA ROADSTER V8 incorporates change not just for the sake of change and\n\nexclusivity - although of course it offers exclusivity in great measure - but\n\nrather as a specific, targeted refinement in the direction of greater comfort.\n\n*****************************************\n\nTo read the full story please download the first attached file."
