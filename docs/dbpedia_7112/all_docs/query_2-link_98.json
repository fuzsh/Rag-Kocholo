There were seven of us – all having different expectations of zip-lining. Some never did it and were excited, some had done it before, and some never did it and had a major fear of heights. Our three guides – Emily, Blye, & Ian were amazing! They were so nice, gave us a few laughs, and put us all at ease. We highly recommend going to Alpine Adventures!! – Britni F"
