        "text": "The Bovensiepen family and the employees of ALPINA mourn the loss of company founder Burkard Bovensiepen, who passed away on October 12th, 2023, at the age of 87. We owe it to his life's work that BMW ALPINA automobiles and the ALPINA brand enjoy a first-class reputation worldwide. His legacy is evident in every car delivered to this day, like the BMW ALPINA B5 GT, launched in 2023 with the most powerful drivetrain in the company’s history and limited to 250 units worldwide.\n\nFor the first time, ALPINA delivers more than 2.000 BMW ALPINA automobiles in a year. The 2021 portfolio ranges from the mid-size saloon, in other words the 3 Series segment, to the extra-large SAV, the BMW ALPINA XB7. New to the model range is the luxurious BMW ALPINA B8 Gran Coupé. The three most successful markets this year were once again Germany, Japan and with big gains the USA.\n\nAlongside the new BMW ALPINA XD3, a SUV Coupé is also added to the range of models: the BMW ALPINA XD4. Both models are powered by an ultra-modern straight-six diesel engine with quad-turbo charging. They will premiere at the Geneva Motor Show.\n\nBMW ALPINA B4 S EDITION 99\n\nThe announcement of the BMW ALPINA B4 S EDITION 99 coupé and convertible models in a limited series of 99 units, was enthusiastically received. The sporty, dynamic models perfectly blend in with the tradition of special ALPINA models.\n\nBMW ALPINA B7 CANADA EDITION\n\nA special model of the BMW ALPINA B7 in a limited series of 21 units is launched on the Canadian market; seven units each in the three offered colours Frozen Grey, Frozen Black and Black Sapphire Metallic.\n\nGeneva Auto Salon witnessed the unveiling of the all new BMW ALPINA B5 Bi-Turbo, for the first time with all-wheel drive and rear-wheel steering as standard! The powerful 4,4 l V8 is also available as a Touring, making this the only estate / wagon with a BMW badge to feature an eight-cylinder engine! The equivalent diesel mode, the all new BMW ALPINA D5 S was launched a few months later at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September of 2017.\n\nNew Importer in Poland\n\nThe Auto Fus Group becomes the official ALPINA importer for Poland. Another important milestone in expanding the authorised ALPINA dealer network throughout Europe.\n\nThe new BMW ALPINA B7 Bi-Turbo is launched at the Geneva Auto Salon. The new long-wheelbase luxury flagship features Integral Active Steering, a first for ALPINA, which in combination with the powerful drivetrain and all-wheel drive results in extraordinay driving performance and very precise, agile handling.\n\nNew Partner in China and Australia\n\nALPINA expands its sales operations to new markets and begins operations in China and Australia.\n\nFor the first time in the company's history, more than 1700 vehicles were delivered worldwide. The broadest product portfolio in the company's history contributed to this success.\n\nThe most important market is Germany with nearly 600 newly registered BMW ALPINA automobiles, closely followed by the USA and Japan with 400 vehicles delivered to customers in each country.\n\nBMW ALPINA automobiles based on the BMW 3 Series and BMW 4 Series make up almost fifty percent of total production.\n\nThe return to international motor sport culminated in 2011 with ALPINA winning the German GT series. Ex DTM pilot Alexandros Margaritis and GT ace Dino Lunardi battled to take the Driver's Championship in the fiercely competitive ADAC GT Masters with the BMW ALPINA B6 GT3 Evo, which had seen continuous engine, aerodynamic, chassis and transmission development during the winter. ALPINA launches a limited edition model on the basis of the BMW ALPINA B3 S Bi-Turbo at the Tokyo Motor Show called the B3 GT3 to celebrate this successful year in motor sports.\n\nAfter a 20 year time-out ALPINA celebrates its motor sport comeback with the BMW ALPINA B6 GT3 in the FIA GT3 European Championship – a young racing series comprising renowned sports cars from twelve manufacturers, including Aston Martin, Ferrari, Lamborghini and Porsche.\n\nALPINA has developed a thoroughbred race car especially for the GT3 category based on the BMW 6 Series. The B6 GT3, which is available to customers, collectors and race teams, can be seen partaking in the FIA GT3 European Championship, the ADAC GT Masters Series and other long distance endurance races. Many of the drivers piloting the B6 GT3, such as Andreas Wirth, Jens Klingmann, Claudia Hurtgen, Csaba Walter, Chris Mamerow and Maxime Martin, have had considerable success already early on in the season.\n\nALPINA continues the 3-Series success story with the 3.0-litre, six-cylinder B3-Bi-Turbo: design and technology combine to form a fascinating mix. In 1978, the legendary BMW ALPINA B6 2,8 began the successful run that continues to this day, with nearly 6,000 3-Series-based automobiles built to date. In fact, each of the B6 2.8's successors have always been at the head of their respective classes.\n\nAs found standard on the BMW ALPINA B12 5.7 E-KAT, ALPINA is the first automobile manufacturer to introduce an electrically-heated, metal catalytic converter, the SUPER-CAT, into series production. This joint project with BMW and EMITEC represents the use of a completely new emissions control technology, undercutting the 1996 European emission standard by 80% with regard to HC, NOx and CO, respectively.\n\nALPINA SWITCH-TRONIC opens a new, sporty automatic driving dimension. The combination of manual gear selection coupled to the traditional ease of driving an automatic convinces many died-in-the-wool stick-shift drivers to make the move to this modern automatic system. One of the merits of ALPINA's SWITCH-TRONIC is the ability to shift the gears using buttons on the back of the steering wheel, much like Formula racing drivers shift their semi-automatic gearboxes.\n\nALPINA converts its entire automotive production to engines with catalytic converters. What’s unique about this is that instead of installing the more commonly used ceramic catalytic converters standard in the automotive industry, ALPINA are the first manufacturer to exclusively install metal catalytic converters, using EMITEC technology. Not until years later will this concept be found in other high-technology automobiles.\n\nBurkard Bovensiepen incorporates a new business endeavour, the ALPINA wine importership. In an impressively-short span of time, ALPINA wins over nearly all of Germany’s top restauranteurs as clients, as well as many wine lovers.\n\nALPINA Partner in Japan\n\nThe ALPINA Importer to Japan is established, and a successful partnership begins – in 2016 ALPINA delivered the 5000th BMW ALPINA to Japan.\n\nALPINA presents three automobiles, each completely developed at ALPINA. The BMW ALPINA B6 2,8 is a 3 Series BMW with a six-cylinder engine, at a time when BMW only sold 3-Series with four-cylinder engines. The BMW ALPINA B7 Turbo, based on the 5 Series BMW, is the fastest saloon in the world. With 300 horsepower, the B7 Turbo Coupé establishes itself amongst the most powerful Coupés. Each of these new-generation ALPINA engines have a fully-electronic computer ignition, unique at the time in the automotive world.\n\nDerek Bell, Harald Ertl, Niki Lauda and Brian Muir win the European Touring Car Championship for ALPINA and BMW. Niki Lauda sets an absolute Touring Car record for the six-hour race on the Nurburgring, driving the BMW ALPINA Lightweight Coupé.\n\nOil Crisis\n\nThe oil crisis rocks the motor industry. ALPINA works through this difficult time without layoffs. Two factors have a hand in this: the good reputation of the company, as well as the flexible reaction to market needs by a team of employees who were, already then, unusually bound to their firm. ALPINA develops engines that run on regular petrol – engines that are at once frugal and powerful.\n\nProduced in his father‘s precision components factory by the young business and engineering student, the engines produced with ALPINA dual-carburettors receive praise not only from the automotive press, but also from BMW and its legendary sales boss, Paul G. Hahnemann. BMW certify the exceptional quality of these ALPINA products by awarding BMW vehicles with the ALPINA system the full factory guarantee."
