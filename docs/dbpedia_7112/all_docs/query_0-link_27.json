        "text": "Embark on an idyllic road trip route in a country that adores its automobiles: Germany! Seamless to navigate with top-tier car rentals, and full of incredible sites and towns to traverse, this is one of our favorite destinations for self-drive itineraries. Explore dozens of natural landmarks and traditional villages in a beloved region – Bavaria – while unveiling this famous road trip destination.\n\nThe German Alpine Road whisks visitors across a breathtaking stretch of gentle curves, gliding through towering peaks and passing more than 20 glimmering lakes, dozens of spellbinding castles, and a plethora of enchanting small villages. This 280-mile route can be driven straight through in under 6 hours, but the motive of this motorway isn’t to rush, but rather, to meander. From Lindau to Königsee, wind through valleys and gaze upon verdant forests, marvel at craggy peaks, rest at family-owned lodges, and eat homecooked meals alongside locals.\n\nExplore some of the most beloved stops along the way!\n\nLindau\n\nHugging the eastern shore of Germany’s largest lake – uniquely situated in such a spot that it shares borders with both Switzerland and Austria – Lindau is a charming historic village in an idyllic vacation hotspot. This small city is a visual delight, with a medieval and Baroque appearance that flaunts stunning views of Lake Constance, sprawling lush greenery, and distant mountains. Additionally, Lindau is home to bountiful aesthetic attractions such as the famous former watchtower of Mangturm, the painted façade of its Rathaus, and a series of lighthouses. This area is also a foodie hotspot and regarded as one of the best places to visit overall in Germany. Lindau is at the western end of the German Alpine Road, and thus the perfect place to start or end the road trip!\n\nGarmisch-Partenkirchen\n\nGarmisch-Partenkirchen consists of two villages that united in 1935 – while Partenkirchen retains Bavarian tradition and has a historic vibe with its cobbled streets and charming old houses, Garmisch is considered more modern and trendy. Near the towering summit of Zugspitze, Germany’s highest peak, this town was put on the map when it hosted the Olympic Winter Games in 1936. Tucked in a sunny valley surrounded by forests and hills, this is an awe-striking destination all year long, whether visitors are seeking to ski down the Olympic jump course, go for a sunshiny hike through alpine forests, or explore the charming streets of its two areas of town. Garmisch-Partenkirchen is a midway point on the German Alpine Road, making it a great stopover for the road trip journey.\n\nBerchtesgaden\n\nTucked away in Germany’s southeastern corner, surrounded by the border of Austria, Berchtesgaden is a small but mighty town. This area not only boasts a plethora of natural marvels including towering mountains, a national park, a vast gorge, and a salt mine, but it’s also a hotspot for history buffs who want to explore the Eagle’s Nest – a Nazi regime construct on the top of Kehlstein. Visitors can also take advantage of the close proximity to several castles, Lake Chiemsee, and even Austria’s Salzburg. Berchtesgaden is at the eastern end of the German Alpine Road, near bountiful attractions which make it an idyllic spot to start or end the road trip and move on to additional adventures."
