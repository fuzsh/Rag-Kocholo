        "text": "From April 1st onwards, Dutch customers can order BMW ALPINA Automobiles directly from the BMW dealer Dusseldorp Automotive. The showrooms are located at Den Haag and Apeldoorn. The first BMW ALPINA demonstration vehicles have already arrived at both locations.\n\nArie Ruitenbeek, Chief Commercial Officer at Dusseldorp Automotive, is excited to welcome ALPINA to Dusseldorp and the Dutch market: “We want our customers to enjoy their car or motorbike to the fullest and that is how we organise our operations. BMW offers great models underlining the slogan of the German brand – ‘Sheer Driving Pleasure’ – but there are always customers with additional personal desires. For this group of customers ALPINA offers unique automobiles with in- and exterior refinements in, high-performance power output and a superior driving experience. We are extremely happy that we are representing ALPINA exclusively in our country. Dusseldorp and ALPINA fit together perfectly in offering the best there is to offer: Adding ALPINA to our portfolio gives us the opportunity to make every customer a Dusseldorp-fan,” concludes Arie Ruitenbeek.\n\nMarket entry in the Netherlands is an obvious move for ALPINA. “In recent years we have received an ever increasing number of enquiries regarding BMW ALPINA Automobiles from Dutch customers. We appreciate that we were able to partner with the successful BMW dealer Dusseldorp and really looking forward to an excellent cooperation”, says Managing Director ALPINA Andreas Bovensiepen."
