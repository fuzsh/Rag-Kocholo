        "text": "The ride premiered at the DÃ¼sseldorf Rheinkirmes on 16 July 1983. It was originally named Himalaya Bahn. In 1987, it was renamed Achter Bahn (German for Roller Coaster)[1] and finally in 1998 it received its current name and paint job.[2]\n\nThe roller coaster operated yearly at the Munich Oktoberfest until it was displaced in 1995 by Euro-Star, an inverted travelling roller coaster. It returned in 2008, after Bruch sold the Euro-Star.[3]\n\nAlpina Bahn has no inversions, instead focusing on twists and drops. The first drop leads directly into a large airtime hill.\n\nTrains\n\n5 trains with 5 cars per train. In each car, riders are arranged 2 across in 2 rows, for a total of 20 riders per train."
