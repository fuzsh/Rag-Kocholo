        "text": "County in California, United States\n\nNot to be confused with Alpine, California.\n\nCounty in California\n\nAlpine County is a county in the eastern part of the U.S. state of California located within the Sierra Nevada on the state border with Nevada. As of the 2020 Census, the population was 1,204,[4] making it California's least populous county. The county seat and largest community is Markleeville.[5]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Washoe people, a Great Basin tribe, inhabited the Sierra Nevada on the California–Nevada boundary, with the Hung A Lel Ti band populating the Diamond Valley including what would become Alpine County.\n\nKit Carson and John C. Frémont were among the first explorers to bring nationwide attention to the Sierra Nevada region in their winter 1844 expedition, though the first known westerners to actually explore the area were Jedediah Smith and Joseph R. Walker. Though gold spurred the infrastructural development of Alpine County, the Comstock Lode found near Virginia City, Nevada and the subsequent silver boom was what triggered Alpine County's growth, even attracting gold miners from neighboring Nevada.[6] This prompted the formation on March 16, 1864, from parts of Amador County, Calaveras County, El Dorado County, Mono County and Tuolumne County.[1] It was named Alpine County due to its resemblance to the Swiss Alps.[7] At its formation, it had a population numbering around 11,000. By 1868, however, the local silver mines had proven unfruitful of replicating the Nevada silver boom and the population fell to about 685 in the 1870 Census, a decline that would steadily continue through the 1950s.[8][9] Silver Mountain (established as Köngsberg)[10] was designated the county seat following the discovery of silver nearby by Norwegian miners.[11] Markleeville, established by Jacob Markley in 1861 as a 160-acre claim encompassing a bridge and toll station, became the new county seat in 1875.[1] The collapse of the silver industry and closing of mines was finalized with the demonetization of silver in 1873, and Silver Mountain was abandoned by 1886, with most businesses moving to Markleeville.[6][11]\n\nFollowing the devastating collapse of the silver industry, the population began quickly declining until the 1950s, falling to an all-time low of 241 in 1930.[9] During this time, its small economy limited the county to serving primarily as a trading center for the local farming and lumber industries, as well as fishing and hunting during the 1930s. Several lots in the county were left vacant.[6]\n\nAlpine County finally managed an economic rebound with the construction of the Bear Valley and Kirkwood ski resorts in the late 1960s, the latter of which is split with Amador County. The population shot up from 484 in 1970 to 1,097 in 1980, a 126.65% increase, and has remained around that level.[9] The three national forests (Eldorado, Humboldt–Toiyabe and Stanislaus) means 96% of the county is owned by the federal government,[12] providing opportunities for economic development and tourism to the skiing resorts as well as historical tourism and outdoor recreation.[13]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the county has an area of 743 square miles (1,920 km2), of which 738 square miles (1,910 km2) is land and 4.8 square miles (12 km2) (0.7%) is water.[14] The federal government owns about 96% of Alpine County, the highest percentage in California,[12] including three national forests: Eldorado (54,318 acres, or 7.81% of the 695,098-acre total), Stanislaus (119,805 acres, or 13.32% of the 899,427 acre-total) and Humboldt–Toiyabe (233,962 acres, or 3.72% of the 6,290,945 acre-total).[15][16]\n\nAdjacent counties\n\n[edit]\n\nEl Dorado County – northwest\n\nDouglas County, Nevada – northeast\n\nMono County – southeast\n\nTuolumne County – south\n\nCalaveras County – southwest\n\nAmador County – west\n\nNational protected areas\n\n[edit]\n\nEldorado National Forest (part)\n\nStanislaus National Forest (part)\n\nToiyabe National Forest (part)\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 1870685—1880539−21.3%189066723.7%1900509−23.7%1910309−39.3%1920243−21.4%1930241−0.8%194032334.0%1950241−25.4%196039764.7%197048421.9%19801,097126.7%19901,1131.5%20001,2088.5%20101,175−2.7%20201,2042.5%2023 (est.)1,141[17]−5.2%\n\n2020 census\n\n[edit]\n\nAlpine County, California - Demographic Profile\n\n(NH = Non-Hispanic) Race / Ethnicity Pop 2010[22] Pop 2020[23] % 2010 % 2020 White alone (NH) 852 801 72.51% 66.53% Black or African American alone (NH) 0 10 0.00% 0.83% Native American or Alaska Native alone (NH) 210 214 17.87% 17.77% Asian alone (NH) 7 12 0.60% 1.00% Pacific Islander alone (NH) 0 0 0.00% 0.00% Some Other Race alone (NH) 1 7 0.09% 0.58% Mixed Race/Multi-Racial (NH) 21 76 1.79% 6.31% Hispanic or Latino (any race) 84 84 7.15% 6.98% Total 1,175 1,204 100.00% 100.00%\n\nNote: the US Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnic category.

The population density was 2 people per square mile (0.77 people/km2). There were 1,514 housing units at an average density of 2 units per square mile (0.77 units/km2). The racial makeup of the county was 73.7% White, 0.6% Black or African American, 18.9% Native American, 0.3% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 1.4% from other races, and 5.1% from two or more races. 7.8% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. 12.1% were of German, 12.1% Irish, 9.3% English, 6.5% American and 5.7% Italian ancestry. 95.0% spoke English, 3.1% Spanish and 2.0% Washo as their first language.\n\nThere were 483 households, out of which 25.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 43.9% were married couples living together, 11.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 38.9% were non-families. 27.7% of all households were made up of individuals, and 5.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.50 and the average family size was 2.96.\n\nIn the county, the population was spread out, with 22.8% under the age of 18, 10.4% from 18 to 24, 27.5% from 25 to 44, 29.3% from 45 to 64, and 9.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 39 years. For every 100 females there were 110.8 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 117.2 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the county was $41,875, and the median income for a family was $50,250. Males had a median income of $36,544 versus $25,800 for females. The per capita income for the county was $24,431. About 12.0% of families and 19.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 27.4% of those under age 18 and 10.1% of those age 65 or over.\n\nPolitics\n\n[edit]\n\nThroughout the 20th century, Alpine County was a Republican stronghold in presidential and congressional elections. From 1892 until 2004, the only Democrat to carry Alpine County in a presidential election was Franklin Roosevelt in 1932 and 1936. In 1964, Alpine was one of only five counties in the state to back Barry Goldwater. It was among the five most Republican counties in the entire nation in 1892,[29] 1908,[30] 1920,[31] and 1928.[32] Warren Harding and Herbert Hoover gained over ninety percent of the county's vote. However, Alpine has become more of a Democratic county in recent elections. It was carried by John Kerry in 2004 and has stayed in the Democratic column since. No Republican has won a majority in the county since 1988.\n\nUnited States presidential election results for Alpine County, California Year Republican Democratic Third party(ies) No. % No. % No. % 2020 244 32.71% 476 63.81% 26 3.49% 2016 217 36.05% 334 55.48% 51 8.47% 2012 236 36.09% 389 59.48% 29 4.43% 2008 252 36.31% 422 60.81% 20 2.88% 2004 311 44.37% 373 53.21% 17 2.43% 2000 281 47.95% 265 45.22% 40 6.83% 1996 264 43.00% 258 42.02% 92 14.98% 1992 222 35.18% 215 34.07% 194 30.74% 1988 306 55.43% 230 41.67% 16 2.90% 1984 264 56.65% 194 41.63% 8 1.72% 1980 254 55.10% 133 28.85% 74 16.05% 1976 225 50.34% 189 42.28% 33 7.38% 1972 366 63.54% 195 33.85% 15 2.60% 1968 150 59.29% 83 32.81% 20 7.91% 1964 124 57.67% 91 42.33% 0 0.00% 1960 132 76.74% 40 23.26% 0 0.00% 1956 114 79.72% 29 20.28% 0 0.00% 1952 148 88.10% 20 11.90% 0 0.00% 1948 106 76.81% 25 18.12% 7 5.07% 1944 98 68.53% 45 31.47% 0 0.00% 1940 125 66.49% 62 32.98% 1 0.53% 1936 74 46.54% 85 53.46% 0 0.00% 1932 53 47.32% 56 50.00% 3 2.68% 1928 49 94.23% 3 5.77% 0 0.00% 1924 52 88.14% 5 8.47% 2 3.39% 1920 64 91.43% 6 8.57% 0 0.00% 1916 60 72.29% 23 27.71% 0 0.00% 1912 8 10.00% 34 42.50% 38 47.50% 1908 75 87.21% 11 12.79% 0 0.00% 1904 74 89.16% 9 10.84% 0 0.00% 1900 69 82.14% 15 17.86% 0 0.00% 1896 40 49.38% 39 48.15% 2 2.47% 1892 65 75.58% 17 19.77% 4 4.65%\n\nIn November 2008, Alpine was one of just three counties in California's interior in which voters rejected Proposition 8, the ballot initiative to amend the California Constitution to reject the legal extension of the title of marriage to same-sex couples. Alpine voters rejected Proposition 8 by 56.4 percent to 43.6 percent. The other interior counties in which Proposition 8 failed to receive a majority of votes were neighboring Mono and Yolo counties.[33]\n\nAlpine County is in California's 3rd congressional district, represented by Republican Kevin Kiley.[34] In the State Assembly, the county is in the 5th Assembly District, represented by Republican Joe Patterson.[35] In the State Senate, the county is in the 1st Senate District, represented by Republican Brian Dahle.[36]\n\nDue to its low population density, Alpine County votes entirely by mail, one of two counties in California which do so.[37] In the June 2014 primary elections, about 22% of registered voters statewide went to the polls; in Alpine County, the number was almost 70%, the highest of any county in the state.[38]\n\nStonewall Nation\n\n[edit]\n\nGay activist Don Jackson seriously presented an idea for taking over Alpine County at a December 28, 1969, gay liberation conference in Berkeley, California. The project, which eventually became known as Stonewall Nation, was subsequently surreptitiously used by fellow gay activists Morris Kight and Don Kilhefner as an agitation and propaganda tool with no serious plans to bring the idea to fruition.[39] Once the political theater aspect of the project was exposed, planning for the Alpine County project came to a halt even among demoralized true believers.[40]\n\nPosse Comitatus controversy\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the late 1970s, the Posse Comitatus organization attempted to take over Alpine County by settling there and fielding candidates in local elections.[41] The Posse thought winning local elections in Alpine County was their best opportunity to take control of a single county. The group fielded a candidate for sheriff and registered fictitious voters using post office boxes and vacant lots as their addresses. Six people were prosecuted for voter fraud, the false registrations were thrown out, and the incumbent sheriff was re-elected.[42]\n\nVoter registration statistics\n\n[edit]\n\nPopulation and registered voters Total eligible population[43] 1,015 Registered voters[43][note 1] 915 90.1% Democratic[43] 388 42.4% Republican[43] 216 23.6% Democratic–Republican spread[43] +172 +18.8% American Independent[43] 50 5.5% Libertarian[43] 18 1.9% Green[43] 8 0.8% Peace and Freedom[43] 3 0.0% Other[43] 2 0.0% Other[43] 3 0.0% No party preference[43] 277 30.3%\n\nTransportation\n\n[edit]\n\nMajor highways\n\n[edit]\n\nState Route 4\n\nState Route 88\n\nState Route 89\n\nAirport\n\n[edit]\n\nAlpine County Airport is a general aviation airport in the Eastern Sierra about 4 miles (6.4 km) from the town of Markleeville.
