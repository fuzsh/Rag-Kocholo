        "text": "A combination of Swiss heritage and modern luxury nestled among the Alps\n\nCompleted in 2012, the Alpina was the first new luxury hotel to be built in Gstaad in over a century, and is fast redefining the Alpine experience while staying true to the Simmentaler architecture style which characterises the region. The Swiss heritage is also reflected in the rooms and suites, which feature classically carved ceilings and timber-clad walls as well as decorative touches such as the traditional leather straps used to hold cowbells. Choose a room with a private terrace boasting views over the foothills of the Bernese Alps or the Diablerets mountains to feel truly immersed in your spectacular surroundings.\n\nAfter a day exploring the hiking trails, sit back and relax with a glass of wine or expertly mixed cocktail at the lounge and bar, where large open windows mean you will never feel too far away from the enchanting pastoral meadows and majestic mountains. The wine cellar is home to 1,700 vintages from across the world. For dinner, restaurant Sommet has been awarded a Michelin star for its innovative and immaculately presented dishes, whilst MEGU offers creative Japanese cuisine. The warm atmosphere of the Swiss Stübli is an ode to authentic local favourites such as fondue and raclette.\n\nThere are a plethora of outdoor activities to help you discover the beauty of your Alpine surroundings, from the classic – guided hiking and e-biking, to the adventurous – rafting, paragliding and bridge jumping. Besides the mountains, you can find solace in the Six Senses Spa, a haven of peace and tranquillity offering a range of treatments inspired by Asian wellness traditions. There is also an indoor and garden pool, hammam, a gym, two Jacuzzis and a yoga studio."
