        "text": "Investment Approach\n\nOur Investment philosophy centers on identifying repeatable trading opportunities, driven by specific market catalysts that we can identify by researching and understanding market dislocations. These opportunities span a wide range of approaches and cover global markets across asset classes. Our strategies are global in nature, spanning across all regions and over 40 different countries. We focus on global arbitrage opportunities, generating alpha through the identification of disparate market pricing between Futures/ETFs/Indices.\n\nWe foster innovation and encourage our Portfolio Managers to explore new ideas and perspectives that will yield consistent returns in ever evolving markets. Because of our structure, we are able to offer flexibility with trading strategies and ideas, giving traders autonomy that they might not experience at other firms. This is further enhanced through our founding partners’ willingness to provide their expertise, gained through years of being involved in the markets. Alpine is committed to providing its capital, excellent infrastructure, and creating a culture where our Managers are able to maximize the profitability of the trading opportunities they unlock – simultaneously building trades and building sustainable businesses."
