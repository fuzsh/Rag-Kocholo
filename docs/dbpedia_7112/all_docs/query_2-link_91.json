        "text": "Once again the trail after Filmoorhütte is technical. Actually it is possible to skip Sillianer Hütte to take a trail more pleasant crossing the lovely mountain pastures and going straight to Moos. The village of Moos (a few kilometers South of Sexten) marked the end of 4 days spent on the border ridge mainly above 2,000 m.\n\nEntering in the Dolomites (and South Tyrol) was a big contrast: extremely hot, crowded but still absolutely beautiful. The long climb to Refugio Locatelli with the Tre Cime di Lavaredo in the background is amazing.\n\nThe descent on the West side on the rocky trail toward Höhlensteintal was hot and a bit long. We bivouacked in a forest and continued our traverse of the Dolomites the following day which is one the nicest place of the Via Alpina.\n\nThere is no interest to run along the road between Lago Di Braies and Anterselva di Mezzo. There is a nice Camping at Antholz. After Antholz there is 1,530 meters non-stop climb to Rieserfernerhütte, followed by a long descent to Sand in Taufer (town).\n\nWe had a storm after Sand in Taufer so we avoided the exposed ridge of the Via Alpina and followed a lower valley (South) through Mühlwald. We continued in really bad weather up to the Lago di Neves where we found shelter in a barn (thanks to the owner). Note that despite what is written on certain maps, there are no huts by the lake.\n\nWe took a bus from Biberwier to Weißenbach am Lech as we didn’t find this part so interesting. We resumed our trail at Weißenbach am Lech but the following 18 km were not so nice neither (road and dirt track) and could have been skipped too. Once again the rain came and we reached Prinz Luitpoldhaus in pouring rain.\n\nThe descent from Prinz Luitpoldhaus to Oberstdorf was nice with plenty of waterfalls and a dramatic atmosphere. From Oberstdorf it is better to take a bus to Birgsau as walking along the road has no interest. After Birgsau (Germany) up to Hotchtannberg (Austria) the Via Alpina is very scenic and pleasant again.\n\nThe Trail continues across mountain pastures all the way to Buchboden. There is a nice camping further down, just before Raggal. Between Buchboden and Feldkirch the Via Alpina follows the road for 35 km so it’s highly recommended to hitchhike or take a bus.\n\nAfter Feldkirch we left Austria to enter in Liechtenstein. The climb from Feldkirch to Gafleispitz is long, +1,900m for 13km.\n\nThe trail below Alpspitz is very technical, sometimes dangerous and exposed (especially during thunderstorm).\n\nWe left the Red Trail of the Via Alpina (stage R57) at Gaflei and switched to the Green Trail (C1). The section from Gaflei (Liechtenstein) to Schwendi im Weisstannental (Switzerland) is mainly along big road, train and cities. Fortunately, there are plenty of buses to escape and get back to the mountains. We bivouacked in a nice place not far from Untersass.\n\nWe left Untersass early in the morning in a typical Swiss pasture landscape: perfect green grass, colorful flowers, happy cows, waterfall and perfectly well marked trail.\n\nThe Trail crosses several nice passes and villages, the only “so-so” section is around Linthal. If Linthal is not so nice, the valley of Urnerboden, just after, is beautiful. Perfect meadow surrounded by step limestone cliffs, waterfalls and dominated by Clariden, a 3,267 m peak.\n\nThe valley ends by the Klausenpass and the trail continues along the road for 22+ km to Altdorf and Attinghausen. After a nice bivouac close to the Surenenpass, we continued the trail to Engelberg.\n\nAfter Engel, the Trail goes up straight under the ski lift which is not so exciting. Fortunately, the scenery is amazing again, especially after the Jochpass.\n\nWe passed the Tannensee lake and continued on a scenic trail to Meiringen.\n\nMeiringen – Grindelwald – Lauterbrunnen is another highlight of this traverse with breathtaking views over the Eiger, Jungfrau, Mönch… on the flip side, it’s crowded, noisy and horribly expensive. We were finally happy to escape the crowd and discover the lovely village of Mürren.\n\nThe section from Mürren to Adelboden is really nice and is a perfect representation of the Swiss Alps: green pasture, snowy peaks, pretty, clean and quiet villages. The Via Alpina is perfectly marked and it is easy to find the trail.\n\nWe spent a fortune in a bakery at Adelboden, trying to get some energy to reach Lenk, the end of the Green Via Alpina Trail. The climb to the Hahnenmoospass from Adelboden has no interest; the trail follows the road and goes under the ski lifts. We were one of the few going up, crossing scootering descending full speed on the road… The descent from Hahnenmoospass to Lenk is not exciting either, especially under the rain, fortunately there was a bus…\n\nAfter Lenk we planned to make our own connection of Trail to join Chamonix. Unfortunately the weather changed for the worse and it snowed above 2,000m, so we had to change our plans. Finally we decided to go South, cross the Rawilpass to join Sion – Matigny. Then we crossed the pass in the storm with less than 50 meters visibility (thanks to the GPS again). We reached Sion soaking wet.\n\nWe continued our journey in poor weather and finally reached Chamonix after 25 days, exhausted but happy. Crossing a mountain range is always a great experience with plenty of up’s and down’s. This one is no exception. If we were do it again, we would completely skip some sections and spend more time in the nicest places."
