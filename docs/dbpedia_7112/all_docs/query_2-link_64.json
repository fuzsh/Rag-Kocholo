        "text": "We don't get the Alpina B3 in the United States, which got the M3's \"S58\" engine before BMW launched its own car. The classier M3 alternative ditches the controversial kidney grille and has spawned its fair share of special editions.\n\nThe latest model comes from South Africa and marks 50 years since BMW set up shop in the country. Painted in the iconic Alpina Green II color, the sedan also has Alpina's elegant 20-inch multi-spoke wheels. It gets \"Alpina\" lettering on the front spoiler and retro-flavored side decals that take us back to the 1980s.\n\nAlpina B3 50 Years of BMW South Africa Edition\n\nOpen the doors and you'll be greeted with Alpina-branded sills and a special plaque on the center console that denote the car's exclusivity. Only five are being made, and all have the black leather interior with a special BMW Group South Africa 50 Years anniversary logo on the headrests. There's also white and green stitching, along with a leather-wrapped steering wheel featuring Alpinaâ€™s logo.\n\nExclusive to South Africa, the special edition is based on the more powerful B3 facelift introduced in 2022. The twin-turbo 3.0-liter inline-six engine produces 488 hp and a massive 538 pound-feet of torque routed to both axles via an eight-speed automatic transmission. It needs 3.6 seconds to reach 62 mph (100 km/h) and tops out at 190 mph (305 km/h).\n\nAlpina also gives this B3 a sports suspension with variable damping. In addition, the engineers from Buchloe install upgraded brakes with drilled discs and heat-resistant brake pads. Chassis and steering tuning are also included, as is a quad exhaust system and the choice between four driving modes: Comfort+, Comfort, Sport, and Sport+."
