        "text": "Press Release\n\n10 March 2022\n\nReorganisation of the ALPINA Burkard Bovensiepen GmbH + Co. KG company\n\nBMW assumes the ownership rights to the ALPINA brand\n\nThe family run company BOVENSIEPEN opens a new chapter in new and existing business opportunities\n\n• The BMW Group buys the ALPINA brand from the ALPINA Burkard Bovensiepen GmbH + Co. KG.\n\n• BMW ALPINA automobiles will continue to be developed and produced in BUCHLOE until the end of 2025.\n\n• The family run company will rebrand itself under the BOVENSIEPEN name, invest in the business related to classic automobiles and will continue to offer different, exciting new mobility solutions.\n\n• The ALPINA Burkard Bovensiepen GmbH + Co. KG and the BMW Group will continue to cooperate closely in the future, but in a new form and inter alia, with a focus on engineering and development services.\n\n• The spare parts supply and the service offering for BMW ALPINA automobiles of all ages is guaranteed in the long-term.\n\nBuchloe – The Bovensiepen family leads its 57 year old partnership with BMW into a new era. ALPINA becomes a brand of the BMW Group. From 2026 onwards, BMW will introduce more automotive offerings in the luxury car range, in which ALPINA has been established in for many years.\n\nUsing its engineering know-how and expertise, the company of the Bovensiepen family will continue to develop, produce and distribute exclusive BMW ALPINA automobiles under the existing cooperation agreement. „In the coming years we will showcase new, exciting, dynamic and efficient automobiles. Our order books are as full as ever and several new products and product updates are imminent“, explains Andreas Bovensiepen, CEO of ALPINA Burkard Bovensiepen GmbH + Co. KG. „The strength and attractiveness of the ALPINA brand is very well established. We made the conscious decision to not sell ALPINA to any other interested manufacturers in the automotive industry because BMW and ALPINA have cooperated trustfully for many, many decades. It is for this reason the correct strategic decision that the ALPINA brand will be operated by the BMW Group in the future.“\n\nThe full completion of the transaction of the trademark rights is still subject to the approval of the antitrust authorities.\n\nThis strategic reorganisation is taking place on the basis of a strong position to react to the increasing dynamics of tightening regulatory demands.\n\n2021 was the most successful year to date for ALPINA Burkard Bovensiepen GmbH + Co. KG with more than 2000 BMW ALPINA automobiles delivered around the world. At the same time, the politically driven transformation to electric mobility as well as tightening worldwide regulatory demands – especially on vehicle emissions, software validation and requirements on safeguarding driver assistant and supervisory systems – means the demands on and risks for small series manufactures are increasing.\n\nIt is on the back of this development that the existing cooperation agreement, which was last renewed for another five years at the end of 2020, will end on the 31st of December 2025.\n\nWith the passing on of the ALPINA brand, the Bovensiepen family company sets the course for the future. We will continue our father’s life work and legacy by investing in the equally well-known BOVENSIEPEN name. With our in-depth expertise and know-how, we will continue to bring different but impressive mobility offerings to market”, says CEO Florian Bovensiepen. “Our family, our employees will continue to stand for engineering quality of the highest standard. Our manufacturing activities will transform into engineering services over time. Through this strategic reorganisation the operations of the company in Buchloe is safeguarded well into the future.\n\nThe engineering and development know-how of our company, gained over many decades of operation, will be made available to further automotive manufactures besides the BMW Group. Both in the areas of internal combustion engines and electric mobility.\n\nThe close connection of the ALPINA Burkard Bovensiepen GmbH + Co. KG company with the ALPINA brand and the BMW Group will continue to prosper in the future. The cooperation in the area of after sales will be continued without change. The availability of original ALPINA replacement parts, ALPINA accessories and high quality service offerings from the Buchloe company are guaranteed.\n\nFurthermore, the Buchloe company’s rich tradition and unique heritage means a new business area will be developed with regards to the restauration of classic BMW ALPINA automobiles. This includes the new production and distribution of classic parts and classic accessories, as well as sourcing and selling sought-after BMW ALPINA models.\n\nThe family owned and operated wine business under the ALPINA naming is not affected by the transfer of the ALPINA trademark and will continue to operate as ALPINA Wein GmbH + Co. KG.\n\nThe purchase of the ALPINA brand by the BMW Group and the associated end in 2025 of the current and future automobile product portfolio will have effects on the existing workplaces at the Buchloe facility. In the coming years, the development, production and distribution of BMW ALPINA automobiles will continue unchanged, demand is at an all-time high and exciting new products are in the pipeline.\n\nBMW will support ALPINA in the coming years with the transformation of workplaces at the Buchloe facilities. This means that by the end of 2025 BMW will offer employment opportunities to a number of employees for whom a continued employment at the Buchloe facility will not be possible, and also coordinate with engineering partners and suppliers for possible employment opportunities."
