        "text": "Germany-Austria Alpine Roadtrip: A One Week Road Trip Through Bavaria and Austria\n\nI previously wrote a similar blog post that was a 10-day trip but I heard some feedback from some people who wanted a shorter trip.\n\nHopefully, this itinerary will help you plan your next Bavaria road trip, and don’t forget to add a detour into Austria like this one does!\n\nThis part of Germany and Austria is truly magnificent, so much so that I live right in the heart of it in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. In this part of the country, you can see people wearing lederhosen and dirndl year-round, not just at Oktoberfest. It is a part of the culture of the area. The southernmost region in Germany and northernmost in Austria is famous for their breathtaking environment. The Alpine foothills offer fantastic hiking routes to mountain lakes and summits. During the winter season, you can enjoy yourself going skiing, sledding, or ice skating. Whether you are looking for action or quieter moments — South Bavaria and Upper Tyrol hold plenty of great locations to create lasting memories.\n\nGerman Alpine Road Trip with Austrian Detour in One Week\n\nStarting in Munich and ending in Munich — If you’re short on time, the easiest way to do this German Alpine road trip is to fly into and out of Munich International Airport. Munich is one of Germany’s most magical major cities, so don’t miss out on an extra day or two there.\n\nDo you have more than one week? The Romantic Road in Germany can easily be added to a trip!\n\nTHE FIRST DAY: FÜSSEN GERMANY\n\nTo help him withdraw from public life, King Ludwig II had a medieval German castle built on a rugged cliff overlooking a scenic mountain backdrop in 1868. Even though the building is constructed in the style of the 13th century Romanesque, some of the mural images are patterned after Wagnerian operas, including “Tannhäuser” and “Lohengrin.”. The castle was opened to the public after King Ludwig died in 1886, and it has become one of Europe’s most popular castles.\n\nIn the city center, enjoy the cafe culture\n\nVisit Neuschwanstein and Hohenschwangau Castle\n\nVisit the Stadt Museum and see the Hollywood in Füssen exhibit which features exhibits from the movie The Great Escape.\n\nTake a hike to Marien Brucke for some outstanding views\n\nDriving Distance to Next Stop: 1 Hour — 59 Km\n\nTHE SECOND DAY: GARMISCH-PARTENKIRCHEN, GERMANY\n\nYou can take a cable car to the top of Zugspitze, Germany’s highest mountain\n\nA short hike away from the city center is the Partnach Gorge\n\nVisit Lake Eibsee\n\nVisit the Linderhof Palace, the only completed palace of the King Ludwig II palaces in nearby Ettal.\n\nTake a stroll through the streets of the city and try one of the traditional Bavarian Alps restaurants\n\nDuring the winter months, go skiing or sledding\n\nRead a full story on Garmisch-Partenkirchen here: https://europeantravel.blog/garmisch-partenkirchen-bavarian-wonderland/\n\nDriving Distance to Next Stop: 22 min — 17 Km\n\nTHE THIRD DAY: MITTENWALD GERMANY\n\nIf you need to scratch a day off of this itinerary I would make it this one although if you have the time it is a nice little stop. One of the reasons to leave it is that it is so close to Garmisch-Partenkirchen is that you could stay in the same hotel for 2 nights if you wanted to.\n\nDiscover one of the most beautiful small Alpine towns in Germany\n\nTake a hike in the Karwendel Alps or take the cable car up and visit the highest distillery in Germany\n\nAt the Mittenwald Brewery, which opened in 1860, you can enjoy a beer\n\nA tour of the Mittenwald Brewery can also be arranged on a Tuesday\n\nIn the winter, ski the Alps and visit the Bavarian Alps of Germany\n\nDriving Distance to Next Stop: 45min — 41Km\n\nTHE FOURTH DAY: INNSBRUCK AUSTRIA\n\nExplore the beautiful streets of the old town\n\nInnsbruck’s Seegrube cable car offers panoramic views of the city\n\nTake a stroll through the immaculate gardens of Ambras Castle\n\nEnjoy lunch or dinner atop the Bergisel Ski Jump\n\nThe world-famous ski slopes are a must if you go in winter\n\nDriving Distance to Next Stop: 2 hours 17 min — 155 Km\n\nTHE FIFTH DAY: BERCHTESGADEN AND LAKE KÖNIGSSEE GERMANY\n\nRide an electric boat around the lake\n\nView the Bavarian Alps from the lake’s base as you walk around Lake Königssee\n\nTake a dip in the clear, crystal-clear water and cool off (It is an Alpine lake so it is pretty cold).\n\nExplore Berchtesgaden’s old town\n\nVisit the Eagle’s Nest\n\nDriving Distance to Next Stop: 1 Hour 17 Min — 72 Km\n\nSIXTH DAY: HALLSTATT AUSTRIA\n\nThe picturesque setting created by an Alpine lake, a beautiful town, and majestic views is what makes this site so attractive. Hallstatt, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is also known for its ancient salt mine with the oldest wooden staircase in Europe. For those that follow Rick Steeves, this is one of his top places to visit in Austria.\n\nYou can explore the downtown area on foot\n\nVisit the famous Hallstatt Viewpoint for a photo\n\nView Hallstatt from a boat on the lake\n\nEnjoy amazing waterfalls and views from above the city on a hike\n\nYou can explore the oldest salt mine in the world, said to be 7,000 years old\n\nDriving Distance to Next Stop: 1 Hour 11 Min — 71 Km\n\nSEVENTH DAY: SALZBURG AUSTRIA\n\nVisit the 11th-century fortress of Hohensalzburg\n\nTake a Sound of Music tour\n\nEnjoy the gardens and palace of Mirabell\n\nVisit the marble-domed Salzburg Cathedral\n\nVisit the Stiegl Brewery\n\nVisit the Red Bull Museum\n\nVisit the busy Getreidegasse for some shopping\n\nVisit Mozart’s birthplace"
