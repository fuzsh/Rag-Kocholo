If you think fast is fun, then you're going to love this ride. ALPINA is a quick short-travel 29er trail bike, but it's a lot more forgiving on rowdy descents than a true cross-country bike. It's the best of both worlds, Cross-Country speed with a Trail bike capability, and a hell of a lot of fun on the dirt!"
