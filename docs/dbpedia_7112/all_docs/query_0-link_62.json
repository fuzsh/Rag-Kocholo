        "text": "Made in West Germany sunglasses by Alpina\n\nAlpina, the German traditional brand which has its headquarters near Augsburg, Germany, owns its fame to the legendary Model M1. The Alpina M1 is a giant model which was produced and sold in the 80s innumerable times and reached cult status before it even hit the stores. The price for an original Alpina M1 was accordingly high. An absolute must for connoisseurs and sunglass lovers is the engraved inscription \"Handmade in West Germany\" which is located on the inside of all originals. You can purchase authentic Alpina M1s in two different sizes 60/12 and 64/12 in our store. Naturally, only as long as they are not sold out!"
