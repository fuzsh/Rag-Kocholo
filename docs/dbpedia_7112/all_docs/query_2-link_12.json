It bordered Skandia in the north; Teutlandt, Magyara, and Gallica in the west; Toscana and Aslava in the south; and the Eastern Steppes in the east.\n\nGeography[]\n\nA large mountain range started in Alpina and ran into Teutlandt and Skandia, where it formed the eastern border.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe name Alpina is the name the Romans gave to the Alps, a mountain range in Central Europe. It is therefore likely that Alpina is based on an Alpine country such as Switzerland, Austria, Bavaria, or all of them."
