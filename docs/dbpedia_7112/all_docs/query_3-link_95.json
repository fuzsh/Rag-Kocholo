        "text": "Founded in 1955, the brand has set itself apart with its French-style sports cars. In 2017, the brand reinvents the A110 with a sports car faithful to Alpine’s timeless principles of compactness, lightness, agility and driving pleasure. In 2021, Alpine Cars, Renault Sport Cars and Renault Sport Racing have joined forces under the Alpine flagship. Alpine has become the dedicated brand to innovative, authentic, and exclusive sportscars of Renault Group, benefiting from the heritage and craftmanship of its historic plant in Dieppe, as well as the engineering mastery from the Formula 1 and Renault Sport teams. The next brand's range will consist of a 'dream garage' of 100% electric, sporty, exclusive and futuristic models for real life.\n\nA290_β: Alpine unveils its vision of the electric hot hatch for everyday driving\n\nThe A290, the future compact B-segment electric sports car in Alpine’s new era has been unveiled in Bristol, and shined through the spectacular, ultra-sporty A290_β (A290 beta) show car. The first of the three models in the future “Dream Garage” will be a new-generation, full-electric sports car designed to trigger every driver’s competitive spirit and recast the notion of sports cars.\n\nThe A290_β, in other words, is opening a new chapter in Alpine’s enthralling history. The brand is tapping into its motor-sports heritage and essence, and venturing into new segments starting with an urban sports car. The show car’s design, materials and technology encapsulate a new angle on electric cars that are just as suited for motor-sports tracks as they are for everyday drives – and as exciting for the driver as they are for passengers. And, as low-carbon mobility is becoming a sine qua non in the automotive sector, the Alpine A290_β is more than a show car: it embodies the brand’s strong stand and unwavering commitment to sustainable motor sports.\n\nRead more"
