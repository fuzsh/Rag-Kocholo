To produce quality components at every stage of the manufacturing process

Anyone who wants to be as successful as ALPINA when it comes to road cars and racing needs the best possible tools in order to produce quality components at every stage of the manufacturing process, and introduce new ideas wherever possible. 2008 ALPINA decided to use hyperMILL® for its CAM system. Not only does the program have the required functionality, it is ‚made in Germany‘ and the two companies are located in close proximity – both deciding factors in ALPINA‘s decision.

Reduced programming expenditure

hyperMILL® allows users to program any type of machining – 2D, 3D, HSC and 5‑axis milling, as well as mill turning – from within a standardised user interface. After all, there are hardly any modern components that require only one type of machining.

In particular, the user is presented only with options that are task-oriented, practical and safe, instead of every imaginable configuration. This is one of the reasons that users are able to progress so quickly. “An additional hyperMILL® speciality is its ability to work with indexed axes. 5‑axis machining is not about completing as many movements as possible; it is about milling economically. And that is achieved when a task can be completed with a minimum amount of movements,” explains Andreas Leser, Sales Director for OPEN MIND.

It is particularly important to the vehicle specialists at ALPINA that hyperMILL® provides a simple user interface, with tried and tested commands which allow them to reach their goals quickly. The safety technology integrated into the CAM system, which automatically avoids collisions, is also very important.
