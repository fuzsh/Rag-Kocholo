        "text": "Zabaan Sambhal Ke was a cult sitcom featuring veteran actors Pankaj Kapoor and Shubha Khote in lead roles. A new version of the show has recently been launched by Alt Balaji starring talented actor Sumeet Raghvan in the central character of Mohan Bharti.\n\nIn a candid chat with us, Sumeet Raghvan speaks about the kind of response the show is getting, comparison with Pankaj Kapur and how comedy is the most challenging genre.\n\nWell, everyone agrees Zabaan Sambhal Ke was a cult show. We asked Sumeet what made him say yes for the show and he quipped, \"First and foremost it was a main role. Secondly, as you mentioned it was an iconic show, so being a part of it was a proud feeling. Thirdly, it was being made in a fresh setup and I always admired Mohan Bharti and I thought I could add my own element to an already iconic character.\"\n\nWhen asked what are the changes that you observe in the original show and the remake, he replied, \"I guess the writing has changed. Double meaning humor has been added in the script this time. Today, as we know, the content on the internet is a lot more liberated. I believe the audience is ready to watch all kind of content. Be it Cuss words or sex scenes, they are there, because the script demands so and I think the audience has now accepted it. So keeping in mind this, the writers of the show have incorporated some double meaning humor, though keeping the innocence intact.\"\n\nThe original Mohan Bharti was played by Pankaj Kapoor. On comparison with him, he said, \"I think, if I'm being compared to Pankaj Ji then it's a compliment for me.\"\n\nAlso speaking about the kind of response the show is getting, he shared that he is getting quite good response on Twitter and Instagram. People are liking the entire setup, humor and the freshness of the show.\n\nOff late, Sumeet has been doing a lot of comedy stuff, and we asked when will the audience get to see him in a different light, to which he replied, \"I hope that happens. But it's okay, if people think I'm doing good comedy then it's a great thing because comedy is one of the most difficult genres, but at the same time I'm waiting for other kinds of roles too. And the dialogue that I want to do something different sounds very cliche to me. Performing convincing comedy is challenging enough for me.\"\n\nSharing his views about the digital platform becoming mainstream now, he said, \"See, there are two sides to it. The people who are of my parents' age, for them TV is the mainstream medium of entertainment and for obvious reasons because they don't understand the digital platform. Digital medium is for the consumer who is always on the move. So, digital is no doubt growing, but TV will always stay.\"\n\nFeeling nostalgic? Tell us about which other classic shows do you miss and why..."
