        "text": "Absolutely! India's summers are known for their intense heat and humidity, which can make daily life quite challenging. During this time, it's crucial to stay hydrated, seek shade whenever possible, and take necessary precautions to avoid heat-related illnesses. Additionally, it's essential to recognize and appreciate the hard work of individuals like delivery personnel and sales representatives who continue to work tirelessly despite the sweltering conditions. A small gesture of offering them water or acknowledging their efforts can go a long way in making their day a little easier. Let's come together to support and appreciate each other during this hot season.#SummerAppreciation #HeatWaveHeroes #StayHydrated #ValueEveryEffort #SummerGratitude #IndianSummer #DeliveryHeroes #SalesTeam #SummerRecognition\n\nUTTARAYAN I think that you should take following measures on Uttarayan. Any wise person, sees both sides of the coin or situation and not just one side. 1) You will not fly your kite beyond 300 metres. The clouds are at an roughly 1 kilometers above the ground but temperature is very cold there. When you are flying kites beyond 300 metres, you leave specific substantial amount of area for birds(Eagle- Jatayuu, there is even an mythological reference here). That's fairly reasnable for normal demands anyway. Enough to beat some society benchwarmers and fullfil anyone's society masculinity syndrome(SMS)ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. 2) Birds are an important part of our eco system, which was shown in the movie \"2.0\". Birds after some years will understand this trend and will double stock food up in their nests, and will chirp and enjoy their holiday. Let them take an holiday too, and let them enjoyðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š. This trend if followed will save hundreds of bird related injury cases in India during Uttaryan.\n\nThe issue of taking things for granted is a common human tendency, but when this behavior negatively impacts the larger population, it becomes a serious problem. Unfortunately, certain cities in India are experiencing the consequences of neglecting air quality, resulting in respiratory diseases and even death. Despite the recent Supreme Court ruling prohibiting firecrackers, the Tamilnadu government has allowed limited bursting of crackers during specific hours. However, this relaxation has proven to be ineffective as people have disregarded the law and engaged in excessive fireworks celebrations. It is disheartening to witness how our actions are harming Mother Earth, who is incredibly tolerant towards us. A mother's love is considered one of the purest forms of love after divine love; yet, it saddens me to see how our greed and ego are causing harm to her. How much longer will we continue to take her for granted? And at what cost? #respectearth #considerate #airpollution #tn #sacredtrinitydigiagency\n\nThe #winters didn't seem like winters this time ,it wasn't as cold, it didn't snow in the most expected places and the we could all feel the hit of #climatechange The #cancerous idea of so called #development is affecting the #mountain state of Uttrakhand and it's not alone. #Sustainabledevelopment is only left in textbooks of school curriculum and the state of #Uttarakhand once know for it's famous #chipkomovement is today witnessing the state government making mockery of such movements. The #government is mindlessly welcoming any sort of funds, in the name of investments, repeating the mistake of urban disasters like Delhi! Does development only mean, hotels, highways and multistorey block of dead concrete with no trees, and just few saplings in a huge building, in the name of being environment friendly! People really need to wake up and we also need to acknowledge the work of people who help us wake up. One such individual is Dr.Lokesh Ohri who has really done some ground work to not just create awareness but also to preserve the natural beauty of Uttrakhand, working in the fields like #greentourism. Listen about his experiences and his initiatives like #beentheredoonthat on the next episode of my #podcast #brainstorming where he talks in depth about the current crisis and what steps need to be taken by the masses to save the dying beauty of Uttrakhand and other natural treasures of the country. Stay tuned, the episode is dropping soon! #brainstorming #ashutoshshrivastav #Lokeshohri #Dehradun #Uttrakhand #sustainabledevelopment\n\nHi there....! Information about trees ðŸŒ³* ðŸŒ³ 1.

Humans breathe three cylinders of oxygen per day. One oxygen cylinder costs Rs 700, three cylinders cost Rs 2100, which comes to over Rs 7,66,000 per year. If the average life span of a human being is 65 years, it reaches more than 5 crore rupees. Trees give us such precious and precious breathing air for free........, ðŸŒ³ðŸ‘Œ If so, how much should we respect the trees? Trees, the treasure given to man by nature..., let us make a commitment to prevent and protect the identity of trees from being destroyed. ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ³ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ„ Let's plant trees and get rain. ðŸŒ§\n\nRecent days Kerala witnessed warning about Swell Surge (Kalla Kadal in Malayalam), perhaps first time in the history of Kerala. It affected badly the coastal districts like Trivandrum, Kollam and Alapuzha. Losses of property have been reported from many parts. Warnings were issues for complete stoppage of recreational activities in coast and beaches. According to the reports by INCOIS (Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services) the origin of the recent Swell Surge was in Atlantic Ocean at about 10,000 km away from Indian coast. It began on 26th April 2024, and the first impact was felt between 3rd and 5th May on coastal areas of Goa, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Odisha, Tamilnadu, Kerala, Lakshdweep, Karnataka, Gujarat and Andaman. The speed was about 60 kmph. Kerala experience similar phenomena in March Also. What is Swell Surge? Swell Surge are the waves formed by the Ocean Swell. It happens due to storms, hurricane or longer duration fierce gale winds. During Swell surge, huge energy transfer happens from air into water, leading to formation of high waves. Swell surge could last for 30 seconds (in some case for longer duration) and if the Swell surge coincides with high tide period, the waves will become stronger and rise to higher level. The waves may rise to 2 m and during its peak time, it can reach upto 10m. These waves travels thousands of kilometers.\n\nIt was Ambani's wedding!! You know Ambani's have spent Rs 700cr on their Isha Ambani's wedding! It was just 7-8% of their net worth! And we middle-class Indians just save our whole life to spend at weddings! Like literally whole life's savings, without even thinking of planning retirement, buying a home, or even education. Even when I ask my parents to wed me very small, they are like \"Ek hi to beti hai uski bhi shadi rukhi sukhi kr de?\" Due to this mentality, the Indian wedding market is increasing with a whooping percentage of 20-30% per annum. Only this wedding, the contribution of wedding season towards the Indian economy is Rs 4.74 lakh crores. Now you can say it's a good sign that the Indian economy is boosting in some ways! But you need to understand the allocation of funds! Only 17% of Indian households are covered with life insurance and around 75% of the Indian population pays health expenses from their pockets. During covid, demand for wedding loans was the highest among all the types of loans. It means they either don't have health insurance or they don't have access to health insurance, or their health insurance gets rejected for any reason. What I am trying to say here is despite the level of financial insecurities, we are still allocating all of our funds just to impress our relatives and friends who don't even pick up our calls when we need them! So yes back to the clickbait!! Why I call it (this picture) an Ambani's wedding! Because proportionately, they have spent even more than Ambani on their son's wedding! Do you think it is reasonable to spend all your savings in just one day while having crucial financial insecurities first hand? #indianwedding #indianweddings #insurance #indianeconomy #moneymatters"
