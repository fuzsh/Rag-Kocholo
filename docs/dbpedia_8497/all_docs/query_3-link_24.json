The series stars Sumeet Raghvan as the protagonist who is the head master of Hindi speaking institute. The idea for the plot has been taken from Mind Your Language, the British sitcom from the late '70s.[1] The series revolves around the hilarious miscommunication between the students due to language barriers.\n\nThe series is available for streaming on the ALT Balaji App and its associated websites since its release date.[2]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nThe comedy series centres on a Hindi-learning class which has students from different nationalities and ethnicities.[3]\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nSumeet Raghavan as Mohan Bharti, Professor of Hindi at NIL i.e National Institute of Languages\n\nShoma Anand as Ms. Diwan, Principal of NIL\n\nTanu Khan as Tara Parker, a former porn star from Los Angeles, USA\n\nBakhtiyaar Irani as Perzin, a Parsi middle-aged bachelor\n\nAshwin Mushran as Sheikh Al Fukar, an Arabian oil businessman\n\nRupali Bhosale as Paro, a fish seller from Maharashtra\n\nPipa Hughes as Jennifer, a social worker from France\n\nMishka Sharma as Lin Dolo, from Aizawl, Mizoram\n\nHemant Kumar as Balwant, a wrestler from Harayana\n\nBhawsheel Singh Sahni as Money Singh, a Punjabi rapper\n\nJimmy Moses as PMS, an MLA from Chennai who wants to become Prime Minister\n\nMeenakshi Chand as Rimjhim, a Bhojpuri actress\n\nMadhuurima as Bela Bose, Receptionist and Ms. Diwan's Secretary at NIL\n\nRakesh Shrivastav as Pandey, Peon at NIL\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nBiswadeep Ghosh of National Herald wrote, \"It is impossible to understand why ALTBalaji chose to produce a pathetic remake of the 1990s classic Zabaan Sambhal Ke. Each actor seems uninspired, apart from Sumeet Raghavan who is occasionally tolerable as the Hindi instructor teaching a motley group of students. The liberal use of double entendre is one of the dubious hallmarks of the script, which has nothing in common with the original barring the basic idea.\"[4]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
