        "text": "Television Talk shows have always invited attention of the home viewers, especially in Marathi. And the reason is simple. People would always like to know the frank opinion expressed by the guest invitees in such shows. But, it is equally important to have the proper host, who should be able to extract the best from such celebrities. Jitendra Joshi, known for his frank and humour filled chat , he will be hosting one such show ‘Don Special’, which will be telecast every Thursday and Friday at 9.30 pm on Colors Marathi channel.\n\nMany renowned celebrities from Marathi stage, television and films will be part of this show and the very first episode will present Subodh Bhave and Sumeet Raghavan together. So, you can imagine, how Jitendra will handle them to speak out their frank opinion on different subjects. In the subsequent episodes there will be pairs like Guru Thakur- Kishore kadam, followed by participants from Big Boss-2 season and others.\n\nSpeaking about his show, Jitendra said,“The celebrities invited in this show will be all known celebrities in Marathi. And this programme will try to extract from them what the people are not aware. This being my programme, there will not be any kind of pretended show, but there will be more freedom offered to the guests.:"
