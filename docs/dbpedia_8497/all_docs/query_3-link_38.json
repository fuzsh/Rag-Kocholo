        "text": "Way before, when there were no web shows or OTT platforms, daily soaps like Sarabhai vs Sarabhai, Khichdi, Baa Bahoo Aur Baby, Hum Paanch, and others used to entertain us. One of the most popular comedy serials, Sarabhai vs Sarabhai, is based on a rich Gujarat family. It was directed by comedian, Deven Bhojani and was written by Jamnadas and Atish Kapadia. Today we are going to talk about its characters and their real-life stories and partners.\n\nSarabhai vs Sarabhai had run through two seasons. The first season came in 2004 and had aired till 2006. But with its growing popularity and demand, it had returned in 2017, along with the brand new episodes of Sarabhai vs Sarabhai second season. The show's episodes still feel fresh and new, and we haven't got over the characters, such as Indu Sarabhai (Satish Shah), Maya (Ratna Pathak), Monisha (Rupali Ganguly), and Sahil Sarabhai (Sumeet Raghvan), who had made us laugh so hard. But who gets to spend their lives with these amazing actors? Let's take a look at their real-life partners.\n\n#1. Satish Shah and Madhu Shah\n\nIn the year 1951, Satish Ravilal Shah had born in Maharashtra. He plays the head of the family, 'Indravardhan Sarabhai', in Sarabhai vs Sarabhai. But before he could step into the television world, he had featured in many Bollywood movies like Hum Aapke Hai Koun, Hum Saath Saath Hai, Main Hoo Naa, Bhootnath, Humshakals, and many more. Satish had worked in more than 250 movies in his lifetime. He is a very talented actor. He can make you laugh and cry with the power of his acting skills.\n\nSatish met his wife Madhu at a film festival, and after knowing each other for a while, he had proposed to her for marriage. But she had turned his proposal down. And after trying several times, they finally had tied the nuptial knot in 1972. They will be completing 50 years of togetherness soon, but the saddest part is they never had a child. Madhu is an actress and a filmmaker herself and has been known for films like Saath Saath, Aashiq Hai, and others.\n\n#2. Ratna Pathak Shah and Naseeruddin Shah\n\nRatna Pathak, daughter of Dina Pathak and sister of Supriya Pathak, was born in 1957 in Mumbai. She has been working in films and television and has earned a name in showbiz over the years. In Sarabhai vs Sarabhai, she had starred as Indu Sarabhai's wife, 'Maya'. People still remember her character from the show.\n\nBut who is her better half? That's none other than Bollywood's one of the most established, versatile, and rich actors, Naseeruddin Shah. They met when Ratna was in her college days, and Naseeruddin Shah was a graduate student. They had fallen head over heels for each other. But as Naseer was already married and didn't get divorced, they had decided to live in. In 1982, they got married and have two sons, Vivaan Shah and Imaad Shah.\n\nRecommended Read: 10 Celebrity Babies' Nurseries: From Anita Hassanandani's Son, Aaravv To Neeti Mohan's Son, Aryaveer\n\n#3.
