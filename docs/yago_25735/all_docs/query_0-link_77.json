        "text": "Elliott Gould (b. 1938) has always been an inspiring actor and a hero of mine. Nominated for an Academy Award (for his role in Paul Mazursky’s “Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice,” 1969) and a Golden Globe (Robert Altman’s “M*A*S*H,” 1970), at a time when he also appeared on the cover of Time magazine (1970), it comes as no surprise that he still gets rave reviews for his excellent work in front of the camera. Looking back, for more than half a century he has been one of the most prominent, appealing and all-round leading and character actors of his generation which includes Donald Sutherland, Tom Skerritt, Dustin Hoffman, James Caan, Martin Sheen, Jon Voight, Michael Sarrazin, Richard Benjamin, Michael Douglas, Jeff Bridges, Bruce Davison and Al Pacino. He also appeared in several other Altman films, such as “The Long Goodbye” (1973) with Mr. Gould in his signature role, Raymond Chandler’s Philip Marlowe, and “California Split” (1974), opposite George Segal.\n\n“Little Murders” (1971), a black comedy which he also produced, has always been one of my favorites, although I must say that I’ve been hooked on his entire body of work practically from day one, with his numerous powerhouse performances in films as Ingmar Bergman’s “The Touch” (1972), the action thriller “Capricorn One” (1978), the crime drama “The Silent Partner” (1978), or Bugsy Siegel’s biopic “Bugsy” (1991) with Warren Beatty and Annette Bening. Mr. Gould also appeared in Leon de Winter’s drama “Hoffman’s Hunger” (1993), the frighteningly and hard-hitting drama “American History X” (1998), or the delightful “Ocean’s Eleven” caper trilogy with an all-star cast, directed by Steven Soderbergh. With his deep, rich, baritone voice, he also graced the television screen; his TV credits include the sitcom series “Friends,” playing the recurring role of Jack Geller.\n\nElliott Gould and Bibi Andersson in Ingmar Bergman’s “The Touch”\n\nIn the meantime, he’s still going strong, and it’s always a thrill to meet Mr. Gould. As I had the pleasure to experience a couple of times before, he is a most loyal host, a vivid, bright, wonderful, and very knowledgeable man, very down-to-earth, fascinating and sensitive—a joy to talk to and to listen to. He is also the father of actors Jason Gould (b. 1966, with his first wife Barbra Streisand), and Samuel Gould (b. 1973, with his second wife Jennifer Bogart).\n\nSo when I had the opportunity to sit down with him at his Los Angeles home, he was going through his latest script, but he was so gracious to put it down and allow me some of his precious time to talk about his work in films. And that’s always such a treat!\n\nMr. Gould, the film that really put you on the map was “Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice.” What was the response like when it was released?\n\nWhen the film first was screened here, and I got so many calls. People got so excited. This film got me my only Academy Award nomination. I hoped to get more, but that’s not the reason why I am here. I’m very grateful and proud of that accomplishment, and it was the first film that Paul Mazursky directed. He wanted me to do other films with him too, he really tried to convince me to do “Alex in Wonderland” [1970], he was actually pleading with me to do that, but I wanted to make my own film [“Little Murders,” 1971, as leading actor and producer]. I certainly haven’t managed my career intelligently in relation to it being a business, because what I really care about is my family. Paul also said to me, ‘I’m writing another one for you, called “Blume in Love” [1973].’ But then I fell out of grace, I went too far. Yet “Bob, Carol, Ted and Alice” will never age, so how could I be sorry about anything, sorry that I didn’t do “Alex in Wonderland” or “Blume in Love.” There I found my first objective relationship, the first one in my existence. In the script and in the film “Bob, Carol, Ted and Alice,” there are four fantasies, and my fantasy is that I’m going somewhere, I see a girl taking off her clothes, and my character had an affair, while Dyan Cannon’s fantasy was that every man in her head would want to dance with her. So Paul Mazursky and [co-screenwriter] Larry Tucker staged the scene with Dyan and me, and about three hundred male extras. And in terms of movie history, that very same day at Columbia Pictures, Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn were doing “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner” in the adjoining soundstage. So we rehearsed it, and when we had a five or ten-minute break for union regulations, they turned the lights off. They left the camera where it was, and all the extras went out to get some air or to get a cigarette. I stayed and then realized, ‘Oh, the camera will never give me problems, it will never lie to me, it will never manipulate me, it will just report what I’m doing.’\n\nYou have always been a very committed and loyal actor, haven’t you? You’re always true to each and every role you play.\n\nRichard Dreyfuss once wanted to have lunch with me and Norman Lloyd who’s going on a 105—we’re very friendly, we meet quite often—he had been married to Peggy [Peggy Lloyd, 1913-2011] for seventy-five years before she passed away. He had worked with Charlie Chaplin, Orson Welles, Alfred Hitchcock, and Jean Renoir. So Richard Dreyfuss joined us, and he said, ‘Sometimes I’m smarter than my directors.’ And I said to Richard, ‘I understand, I made that mistake too. You must understand that we’re just actors and it’s our job to serve the director, to be able to help and participate, so the director can have what he needs to make the picture.’ Richard said to me, ‘You mean you would go down with the ship?’ I said, ‘Absolutely, to care, something to live for and something to die for, that’s what I believe in.’ It’s inspiring to believe in something, to believe in what you do. When Robert Altman offered me to do “McCabe and Mrs. Miller” [1971], I couldn’t accept it, because I was doing “I Love My… Wife” [1970]. I had people doing business for me, I didn’t do that myself, I don’t do business with anyone. So Robert Altman said to me, ‘You’re making the mistake of your life.’ I said, ‘Well, you can’t take away that I was your first choice for this. And someday I will see the film and think, Wow, what a masterpiece, and you wanted me to play the part!’ This is how I look at things. And Warren Beatty and Julie Christie were just fabulous in it.\n\nWhy haven’t you written your autobiography yet?\n\nOh no, I have not been terribly encouraging. First of all, ego is something I find toxic. If I did, I would want to write it for me, and write it in a way that has real life in it. And I don’t want to exploit anybody or anything… We’ll see—we’ll see about the book, or better: we’ll see about a book, not the book. I’ve done a little work with someone, but I don’t know. I have a story about Elvis Presley who once said to me, ‘You’re crazy, man!’ That was Elvis with a gold .45 automatic in his belt, and he was calling me crazy. He was there with his father and with the Colonel, his manager. So I said, ‘I’m not crazy, Elvis.’ ‘But why did you and Barbra break up? You’re two of my favorite people!’ And I said, ‘Shut up, Elvis.’ I thought that is an interesting idea for a title. But again, we’ll see.\n\nYou make it very rewarding for people to see and admire your performances. Are you aware of that?\n\nWell, they’re identifiable because I’m vulnerable and sensitive. We’re all sensitive. The greatest artist in the world is an uninhibited child at play, and I subscribe to that. A friend of mine, Herb Gardner, a very successful writer, and his wife once said, ‘And Picasso.’ I said, ‘Oh, I didn’t know you were a materialist.’ I also love Picasso, but you can have Picasso and I’ll keep the child, because for me, without the spirit of the child, it’s all meaningless. And then I discovered that Picasso was the one who made the statement: the greatest artist in the world is an uninhibited child at play.\n\nEach and every performance you did is a kind of nourishment for the mind, but also for the heart. Would you agree with that?\n\nYou know, I did a film called “Humor Me” [2017], directed by Sam Hoffman, with Jemaine Clement from New Zealand. He’s very good; he played my son. I gave everything I had when we did that film, like I always do, no matter what. When we did the “Ocean” films, I became friendly with Casey Affleck, and with everyone of the cast; we were like a group. Matt Damon’s best friend was Ben Affleck. I had never been in touch with Ben; we had never talked. But after I had seen “Argo” [2012], I was really impressed with his craft. Matt Damon said to me, ‘Ben is the smartest person I know.’ Then I said to him and George Clooney, ‘I guess you haven’t met all of us. This isn’t just individual intelligence; this is a family. This is nature, and it doesn’t matter who anyone is.’ So when George Clooney was giving a party for Ben Affleck and the cast of “Argo” at the Beverly Hills Hotel, I thought I’d go there and maybe I could have an opportunity to tell him, because I thought it might please him, and so I did. As I had also said to Mick Jagger once, ‘It’s impressive how good you are.’ I knew he would be pleased to hear that. He waited a moment and said, ‘I have a question for you. Everything you’ve done over all this time, have you ever done anything that you were sorry you did afterward?’ I said, ‘Thanks for that question, but no. It would be so disloyal. Sometimes things work; sometimes they don’t. There are so many people depending on us for their livelihood.’ So right now, I haven’t quit, and I haven’t retired, and it remains to be seen if I can still make a fair living doing what I do. But I feel okay. Even though I’m eighty, mentally, I’m very young and I’m always inspired by wonderful artists. Even my love for Jacques Brel, I mean, I knew Frank Sinatra, but Jacques Brel… A great friend of mine had told me about Jacques Brel and I saw him in America at Carnegie Hall. Songs like “Ne me quitte pas” and “La valse à mille temps”… he was such a brilliant and sublime artist and poet. During the course of “Funny Girl,” Barbra, a few of our friends and I even went to Europe, to L’Olympia in Paris where we saw Gilbert Bécaud whose manager also worked for Jacques Brel. I asked him about Brel, and he said, ‘Jacques Brel will be in Marseille.’ So we went to Marseille, because I wanted Barbra to see him. I asked him, ‘Could you ask Brel, when we are there, if he would consider to sing “Ne me quitte pas” and “La valse à mille temps”?’ So when we arrived into this music hall, the women were wearing fur coats and fur hats, and the audience was booing. Boo. I mean, what did we know; we were kids from Brooklyn and Massachusetts. We saw his show and he didn’t sing “Ne me quitte pas” and “La valse à mille temps.” After the show, I hoped to meet him, and we went to his dressing room. The door was open, and we saw him with a woman in his arms, a bottle of beer in his hand, we see one another, and then he sees what’s behind me—fur hats and fur coats—and he goes no [shakes no with his head]. So Barbra never met him, but for a moment, we said hello to Jacques Brel.\n\nWhy didn’t you ever make a film together?\n\nThere were a couple of opportunities. We never expected that I would be successful in film. Barbra once called me when she was casting “Nuts” [1987]. First, we thought Mark Rydell was going to direct the picture with Debra Winger, and he had talked to me about playing her lawyer. But he couldn’t do it, so then Barbra decided to do it, and then Richard Dreyfuss wound up playing the lawyer. Barbra called me when she was doing the film and asked, ‘If you had a choice, what would you do? Your television series or my movie?’ At that point and moment, my television series was a series for CBS called “Together We Stand” with Dee Wallace Stone and the whole family. I said, ‘I don’t have a choice, I’m committed to the television series, I’m in New York to meet the affiliates. We had done a pilot, they picked us up, and they want us to go on air.’ And then she said, ‘But if you had a choice?’ I said, ‘Okay, I’ll talk with you later.’ Richard Dreyfuss, who wound up doing it was excellent and terrific. But Barbra and Martin Ritt, who directed the picture, didn’t have an easy time together. I knew Marty; he had been interested in me to do “Norma Rae” [1979].\n\nWould you consider “Little Murders” one of your major accomplishments, because that’s a real masterpiece, isn’t it?\n\nYes. I even have a letter here from Jean Renoir. Norman Lloyd took him to a screening before the film opened theatrically. Jean Renoir wrote the letter to Alan Arkin [director of “Little Murders” and Mr. Gould’s co-star].\n\n“Little Murders” (1971, trailer)\n\nWhen you do a scene, what is most crucial to you?\n\nI want to be supportive. I want to be available. I spent some significant time with Alfred Hitchcock, and he said to me, ‘It’s all music, but if one person thinks he has to make himself more outstanding than the others, it throws off the concert. You realize that one person wrote every note for each instrument, but those people have to play together.’ My mind went to Beethoven’s Ninth, which at its time was thought to be impossible to play. And when a symphony orchestra was able to play it, he was deaf, and the only way he could hear it or feel it was sitting in the pit with the orchestra with his shoes off to feel the vibrations of what he had written. Hitchcock said, ‘Everybody has to be playing together for me to see my picture.’ He was great, and he was right. He even sang to me!\n\nLos Angeles\n\nMarch 27, 2019\n\nFILMS\n\nQUICK, LET’S GET MARRIED (1964) DIR William Dieterle PROD William Marshall SCR Allan Scott CAM Robert J.
