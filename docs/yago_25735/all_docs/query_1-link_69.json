        "text": "“I leave with a heart full of gratitude for the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of Oklahomans.”\n\nWith a legacy of dedicated service and significant legislative achievements, Senator Chris Kidd, R-Waurika, has announced his intention not to seek reelection and retire from the Oklahoma Senate in November, at the end of his current term. Senator Kidd, a fifth-generation Oklahoman with deep roots in the state’s agricultural community, leaves behind a record of impactful legislation and community development.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon- Oklahoma Farm Report’s Ron Hays talked with Oklahoma Farm Bureau President Rodd Moesel about the word that Senator Kidd will not run for reelection- hear his comments in the listen bar below:\n\n“Working for the citizens of Oklahoma has been one of the most rewarding, fulfilling, and humbling experiences of my life,” said Kidd. “I take great pride in the accomplishments we made for our state during my tenure, but now I look forward to spending more time at home with my family.”\n\nThroughout his tenure, Senator Kidd has been a tireless advocate for economic prosperity, public health, education, and the well-being of military families in Oklahoma. Notable among his legislative accomplishments is the Oklahoma Research and Development Attractions Act, an innovative measure designed to invigorate the state’s economy by attracting research and development companies through a grant program managed by the Oklahoma Center for the Advancement of Science and Technology (OCAST).\n\nAs chairman of the Senate Agricultural and Rural Affairs Committee, Senator Kidd has overseen the passage of countless policies to help rural Oklahoma and ensure the state’s agriculture industry continues to thrive.\n\nIn a move to support military families, Senator Kidd extended a sales tax exemption to spouses of service members killed in action, demonstrating his commitment to those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. The state now celebrates Oklahoma State Aviation and Aerospace Day on Aug. 19 each year after he passed a bill during the 2017 legislative session to commemorate Oklahoma’s second-largest industry.\n\nFurthermore, Senator Kidd’s legislation enabling county health departments to form “health districts” stands as a testament to his dedication to enhancing health care access and outcomes across Oklahoma counties. He also showed his commitment to our public schools when he championed legislation to ensure school support staff were paid even if their district was closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSenator Kidd’s efforts have directly contributed to historic investments in Oklahoma’s public education, including securing funds to expand nursing programs at Cameron University and the Great Plains Technology Center. He also sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the Oklahoma State University Veterinary Medicine Authority. This helped ensure a dependable source of funding for OSU’s veterinary medicine education programs.\n\nHis advocacy for the elimination of the state’s grocery tax and the expansion of broadband access further highlights his commitment to improving the quality of life for all Oklahomans.\n\nIn recognition of his contributions, Senator Kidd was honored as the County Commissioner Legislator of the Year in 2022, a fitting accolade for his work in strengthening county governance and services.\n\nPrior to his election to the Senate in 2016, Senator Kidd’s diverse career spanned roles in economic development with the Chickasaw Nation, banking, and education, in addition to his ongoing involvement in the agricultural sector alongside his family. As a devoted husband and father of three daughters, his commitment to his family and community has been paramount.\n\nSenator Kidd expressed his gratitude to the people of Oklahoma for their trust and support, stating, “It has been the honor of my lifetime to serve the great state of Oklahoma. I am proud of what we have achieved together, and I leave with a heart full of gratitude for the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of Oklahomans.”\n\nAs he steps down to focus on his family and ranch, Senator Kidd’s legacy of service, advocacy, and leadership will undoubtedly continue to benefit Oklahoma for years to come.\n\nKidd was first elected to the Oklahoma Senate in 2016."
