        "text": "Two decades after going out of business, Albert Steiger Co. is just a memory for many in Western Massachusetts.\n\nWGBY's \"Connecting Point,\" hopes to stir up nostalgia with a discussion of the department store in the first of a four-part series titled, \"Gone but not forgotten.\"\n\n\"I think we all like looking back in our lives – to remember things we did and places we enjoyed visiting with friends and family,\" Director of Public Affairs and longtime host Jim Madigan wrote in a blog post. \"That's the idea behind a four-part series we'll be bringing you on 'Connecting Point' the next few weeks.\"\n\nThe show invited grandson of the founder Allen Steiger, former downtown Springfield Steiger’s Manager John Donnellan, and one-time Steiger’s employee Cheryl Dutton to discuss impact the stores had on the community.\n\nSteiger's was founded by the late Albert Steiger, a German immigrant who came to America in 1868. With a background in fabrics - his family owned a silk factory while living in Europe - he opened a department store in Port Chester, NY.\n\nAfter initial success, he opened his first store in the Valley in 1896, in Holyoke. Within decades, the store was in Hartford, Longmeadow, Springfield, Westfield, Eastfield and Enfield.\n\nThe key to the department store's success was attitude, Allen Steiger told Madigan. \"We wanted people to be treated well and that was I think the secret of our business - that we treated people well and they in turn treated the customer well.\"\n\n\"There was an expectation on the part of the Steiger's family. An expectation on how you would present yourself, how you would dress, how you would speak, and that was carried on throughout,\" one-time Steiger’s employee Cheryl Dutton said. \"I learned very early on to respect and listen to people and present myself in the best way possible.\"\n\nSuch attitudes, are considered to have created lifetime customers.\n\n\"Just as there were generations of Steigers, there were also generations of Steiger's customers,\" downtown Springfield Steiger’s Manager John Donnellan. \"[There were] a number of people in Springfield, in Greater Springfield, who would come - for instance, to register for their china, to buy their wedding gown - would tell us that their mother, grandmother had done the same thing 40 or 60 years before.\"\n\nWhether buying a gown or glassware, Donnellan said Steiger's stood for class.\n\nOur buyers were the arbiters of taste,\" said downtown Springfield Steiger’s Manager John Donnellan. \"If somebody bought something at Steiger's that meant fashion, that meant quality.\"\n\nBeyond fashion, taste also played a part in bringing in customers by way of the Tea Room. \"On a Saturday, we'd have over 1,000 people eat there for the reason that the food was so good and very reasonably priced,\" Steiger said.\n\nTwenty years ago the department stores closes. \"We could sense it coming,\" Steiger said. \"We were really a peanut compared to [larger chain stores.]\"\n\nIn addition to their piece on Steiger's, Connecting Point has several other upcoming pieces."
