        "meta_description": "In the wake of the October 17, 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake, Caltrans commissioned an oral history project to document the personal and professional experiences of Caltrans employees who worked to restore the State's damaged transportation system. This is an interview with Allen Pierson, a Lead Worker and Adam Steiger, Equipment Operator on the Striping Crew at Caltrans 29th Avenue Maintenance Yard, in Oakland, CA. The Striping Crew was the only crew for all of Caltrans District 4 and they did road striping projects from Gualala to Watsonville. Some of the highlights are describing the earthquake damage and re-striping Interstate 80 from Powell Street to the Toll Plaza, Main Street in downtown San Francisco, and adding an extra lane on the San Mateo Bridge.",
