        "text": "The Warrant Officer’s Quarters\n\nThe Warrant Officer’s Quarters was built in 1897 to house a Master Gunner and his family. It had a kitchen, pantry, and living room on the main floor. Upstairs there were two large bedrooms and a third smaller room off the master bedroom. Until after the Second World War, Master Gunners lived at Work Point. So, the highest-ranking Non-Commissioned Officer at Fort Rodd Hill lived in the Warrant Officer’s Quarters.\n\nWe know quite a few names of the families who lived in the Warrant Officer’s Quarters over the years, including two brothers from the same family: the Buxtons. We only have photographs of a few of these families. If you possess any additional details regarding the soldiers and their families, please let us know.\n\n1906 to ? – Major A.A. Warder\n\n1910 to 1911 – Bombardier Titch Buxton and family\n\n1911 to 1916 – Sergeant Fred Buxton and family\n\n1916 to 1919 – Lottie Collings and Family\n\n1919 to 1928 – Titch Buxton and Family\n\n1934 to 1935 – Sergeant Tom Eastick\n\n1936 – Bombardier Bill Wharton and family\n\n1936 to 1938 – Bombardier Bill Cameron and family\n\n1938 to 1939 – Gunner B. Henderson and family\n\n1939 to 1945 – During WWII the Warrent Officer’s Quarters was used as an officer’s mess\n\n1945 to 1946 – Warrant Officer Class 1 (Master Gunner) T.G. McIndoe\n\n1946 to 1947 – Master Gunner Jack Rippengale and family\n\nFamilies who lived in the Warrant Officer’s Quarters\n\nAnnual Summer Training Camps held at Fort Rodd Hill\n\nFort Rodd Hill was the site for the 5th (BC) Regiment’s training camps, held for a few weeks each summer. While the training courses were taking place, the wives and children of married servicemen would camp on-site. Large canvas tents were set up in the field and above Upper Battery. The family living in the Warrant Officer’s Quarters also moved into a tent for a few weeks while the Warrant Officer’s Quarters became the Officer’s mess for the duration of the camp.\n\nWooden Huts\n\nWhile the Warrant Officer’s Quarters was the only official married quarters at Fort Rodd Hill, families also lived in other buildings temporarily. These included a log cabin built by the Royal Engineers and a wooden hut down by the beach.\n\nDuring WWI, Lieutenant Albert Robertson lived in the wooden hut by the beach with his wife and young daughters Bernice and Gladys. A third child, Mac, was born in the hut sometime between 1914 and 1916. The Robertsons moved out in October 1916 when Lieutenant Robertson left to command Fort Macaulay.\n\nPermanent Married Quarters After World War II\n\nAfter WWII, new housing units were built at Belmont Park near Fort Rodd Hill and near Work Point to meet the demand for more married quarters. The old system of a limited number of free married quarters and rations to those on the married list was replaced by providing a combination of better pay and a larger number of married quarters available at reasonable rent. This ensured that military personnel could find affordable housing for their families wherever they were posted.\n\nFamily Fun moments at Fort Rodd Hill\n\nIt was not all serious business living inside a military fort. The families who lived at Fort Rodd Hill found many ways to enjoy their time here. Picnics, swimming, and fresh seafood dinners brought families together for recreation and relaxation. Playing with dogs, swings, bicycles, and other toys entertained children for hours."
