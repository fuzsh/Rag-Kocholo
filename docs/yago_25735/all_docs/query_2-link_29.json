        "text": "“If a man cannot understand the beauty of life, it is probably because life never understood the beauty in him.” Criss Jami Compassion is a lovely word and it’s meaning is the sympathetic consciousness of others distress together with a desire to alleviate it (Merriam-Webster Dictionary). I think that it is a human trait to be compassionate to others and this is why many people get into the helping professions, such as the health industry. Whilst I see being compassionate as a lovely trait, like anything – it can also have a downside as people may burn out. Carer fatigue or compassion fatigue does exist, and steps need to be taken to avoid this. I know that I have been discussing self-care for a few weeks now. It is high on my agenda, both inside my clinic and outside. For those in the caring/helping fields, self-care is essential as you cannot help others if you are run down yourself. I have downloaded Black Dogs Self-Care Plan and provide this as a handout to all my clients at some point. I have also used this for wellbeing discussions with health professionals. Do a quick google search and see if you can find it. It is a really useful plan as it highlights that we all have negative and positive coping strategies when dealing with stress. It also provides the different aspects to self-care and gives examples of what these activities may look like. Taking time out for yourself to reduce the burden is necessary and helps you provide a better service to those that you care for.\n\nThrowback to March at the Congolese Women Forum - @thecwforum hosted by @itsbisonabiso where I led my first Wellness Workshop. What a beautiful feeling it was to be in a room filled with so many inspiring fellow Congolese women sharing their stories and being genuinely open to helping one another. May is Mental Health Awareness Month and as an advocate and a full time therapist, my passion is to lead more conversations on the importance of mental wellbeing, in spaces like this. So book me for a workshop at your next event. ☺️ A few things I’d like to share about therapy: • Most insurance companies DO cover a portion of therapy services. • You CAN be a believer and seek counseling at the same time. (Proverbs 11:14) • If you feel you’re not connecting or something isn’t right with your current therapist, please advocate for yourself and make it known. This is your time and chances are the therapist will make an effort to meet your expectations. If not, don’t just give up, you can find someone else. • Vulnerability is a strength and not a weakness. Therapy isn’t just for when there is crisis, but it’s also to help you understand yourself and your experiences better; why you act and think the way you do. Nothing has to be “wrong”, you can seek out counseling for self improvement. • The gym, traveling, shopping, and everything else you use to cope is NOT therapy. They are coping mechanisms. These things may be therapeutic, but not equivalent to meeting with a licensed professional who can assess your needs and provide solid guidance. • Therapy is so needed in the African community. I encourage you to be the first in your family, to stop the cycle and find healing for you and the generations after you. • If you’ve read this far, this is your sign to find a therapist. You won’t regret it. With love, Your favorite Congolese Therapist\n\nHow can we support our employees taking care of their mental and physical health? At the AXA Headquarters, we are committed to promote a healthier workplace for all by raising awareness and strengthening prevention. As part of our wellbeing program, we have been implementing various initiatives over the past few months to equip our employees with concrete tools and to boost #prevention, #seflcare & #support. Yesterday, we made the focus on hyperconnectivity with our “Let’s talk with experts” conference cycle entitled “All addicted to screens, how to manage our cyberaddictions?” We were so pleased to welcome 3 experts to address this topic : Dr Michel Desmurget, Syrine Fendri & Alexis Peschard. They shared with us their vision of daily screen management today in professional & personal environments, what does “addiction” mean, and gave us some tips to better manage our screen connection. My main takeaways: - Screens are part of our daily life and useful, and we need to have a healthy use of them putting limits and learn “how to disconnect” - Each of us should look at our link to screens and be aware of potential damages. By understanding addiction mechanisms, we can better get difference between hyperconnexion & addiction. - Disrupted sleep, musculoskeletal disorders, stress, attention and concentration difficulties … keep an eye out for these potential warning signs and symptoms. We all need to find the right balance to have a healthy use of screens!
