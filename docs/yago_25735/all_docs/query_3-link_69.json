        "text": "Joan Benedict, best known for starring on the original Steve Allen Show and Candid Camera, has passed away at the age of 96. She died of complications from a stroke. Her death was confirmed by a family spokesperson.\n\nAt a young age, Benedict studied dance at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and later at the Rome Opera Ballet School. She went on to study acting at the famous Actors Studio in New York. She began her career on the network game show Masquerade Party. In the 1960s, ’70s and beyond, she worked steadily appearing on The Steve Allen Show, Candid Camera, General Hospital, Fantasy Island, T.J. Hooker, Days of Our Lives and more.\n\nBenedict was also known for her marriages. She was married to actor John Myhers (History of the World: Part I, How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying) from 1962 until his death in 1992. Then, she wed Oscar-winning actor Rod Steiger (In the Heat of the Night, On the Waterfront) in 2000 and they stayed together until his death in 2002. After, she was in a relationship with actor Jeremy Slate (True Grit, The Devil’s Brigade) until he died in 2006.\n\nIn 2016, she opened up about her marriages and shared, “Both of my husbands, and my lifetime partner, Jeremy, were wonderful men who respected me as an actress. They all died from different forms of cancer, so my memories are sometimes bittersweet, but with no regrets.”\n\nBenedict starred in several stage shows including the autobiographical The Loves of My Life and a show about Leona Helmsley. She published a memoir titled Brooklyn Baby in 2016. She is survived by her daughter, Claudia and two granddaughters. Let us know in the comments if you remember seeing her on Candid Camera or another show!"
