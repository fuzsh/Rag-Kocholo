He was born January 20, 1954 in Jerome, Idaho to Robert and Betty Dudley Rodd.\n\nBilly served in the Navy and was a devote Catholic.\n\nHe married Anita Cecilia Rodd Dominguez on April 30, 1977. They were blessed with 4 children, Maryann, Cassandra, Christina, and Marie.\n\nBilly was a loving husband, father, grandfather, great grandfather and brother. His world was his dear wife and there is nothing he wouldn’t do for her. He would move heaven and earth if that’s what she wanted.\n\nBilly Ray Rodd was our hero and heart of our family. There was nothing he wouldn’t do to keep us safe, loved, and taken care of. His motto was God first, family and the country he fought for. He was a man of honor and always stuck by his word. He will be clearly missed; a piece of our hearts went with him when God took him home.\n\nBilly is survived by his dear wife Anita, children; Maryann, Cassandra, Christina, Marie, brothers; Lauren D. Rodd, Robert R. Rodd, Harold R. Rodd, Paul A. Rodd Samual E. Rodd, sisters; Barbara D. Andkrum, Pat Massion, Cynthia Weatherman, 17 grandchildren, 5 great- grandchildren, and many nieces and nephews, aunts and uncles, and cousins.\n\nHe is preceded in death by his father, Robert Rodd, mother, Betty Ann Rodd, sister, Vynette Rodd, and grandparents.\n\nMass was held Monday, June 19, 2023 at 12 noon at the St James Catholic Church.\n\nR.I.P. Our Hero, and Our Hearts.\n\nAka the man, the myth, the legend.\n\nIt’s not good bye, it’s see you later.\n\nA viewing will be held Sunday, June 18, 2023 from 5-6pm with a rosary to immediately follow at 6pm at the St James Catholic Church.\n\nMass will be held Monday, June 19, 2023 at 12 noon at the St James Catholic Church."
