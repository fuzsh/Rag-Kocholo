Steph refused to have treatment until Charlie was born.[3] In October 2010, it was revealed that Charlie was going to be snatched in a storyline, which also saw the return of a character that wanted to cause pain to Steph and Libby Kennedy (Kym Valentine).[4] TV Week said that Charlie would \"go missing in mysterious circumstances\" and it would leave Steph panicked.[4] The storyline began when Summer Hoyland (Jordy Lucas) and her friends brought Charlie out for Halloween and she took her eye off him.[4] In 2011, Charlie left the show, along with Lyn Scully (Janet Andrewartha).[5]\n\nOn 13 October 2015, it was announced that the character would be returning in early 2016, with Alexander McGuire now in the role.[6][7] McGuire researched his on-screen family and began filming for the guest stint on 16 October.[6] Of joining the show, he commented \"It's an amazing first job in the industry.

Now that I have a small role, I feel very lucky to be part of an amazing team.\"[7] The character returned on 29 May 2018.[8]\n\nWhen Steph falls pregnant, she is also diagnosed with breast cancer. She refuses to have treatment to protect the baby, causing a rift between her and Max. Their son is born two weeks premature and is named Charlie after Steph's grandfather, Charlie Cassidy (Cliff Ellen). When Izzy Hoyland (Natalie Bassingthwaighte) babysits Charlie, Robert Robinson (Adam Hunter) sneaks into the house and turns on the gas. Izzy passes out, but they are both saved by Lyn Scully. A few months later, Max believes he is losing his mind when Elle Robinson (Pippa Black) launches a revenge plan against him. She snatches Charlie when Max is meant to be looking after him. Max later walks out on his family and leaves town. Steph begins a relationship with Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney), giving Charlie a new father figure. When they become engaged, Charlie is one of Toadie's best men. However, the wedding is called off when Steph struggles with her vows. Charlie befriends Ben Kirk (Blake O'Leary). Steph starts dating Jay Duncan (Charlie Clausen) and she and Charlie go away to a cabin with him. Steph realises that Jay started a fatal bush fire, and she tells Charlie to walk back to a fruit stand down the street alone. Toadie and Nicola West (Imogen Bailey) find Charlie by the side of the road and Nicola stays with him, while Toadie saves Steph. Steph decides to concentrate on Charlie for a while.\n\nWhen Steph takes Charlie to the garage, she is distracted by her new partner Greg Michaels (Nick Farnell) and a cabinet falls on Charlie. He is left without serious injury. Charlie befriends Mickey Gannon (Fletcher O'Leary) and Callum Jones (Morgan Baker). They form a band with Ty Harper's (Dean Geyer) help. Steph becomes pregnant and leaves town with Charlie for a while, where she gives birth to his half-brother Adam. Summer and her friends take Charlie trick-or-treating for Halloween and he wanders off. Lucas Fitzgerald (Scott Major) finds Charlie's ghost costume in a car park. Samantha Fitzgerald (Simone Buchanan) finds Charlie and is taking him to Harold's Store when she runs into Steph, Lucas and Lyn. Steph spends as much time as she can with Charlie during her trial for culpable driving. She tells Charlie that she may need to go away for a while and Charlie asks if he can go with her. Steph is sentenced to six years in prison, leaving Charlie in the care of Lyn. Charlie misses his mother. Charlie and Callum bring home a Blue-tongued skink, called Teddy. On his birthday, Lyn tells him that Teddy needs to go back to his owner. Charlie tells Lyn that he hates her and he misses his own party. Jim Dolan (Scott Parameter) returns with Teddy, explaining that his owner did not want Charlie to be upset. While Sophie Ramsay (Kaiya Jones) is babysitting him, Charlie runs away to find Steph. Lyn has Steph moved to a low security prison in Bendigo and she and Charlie leave Erinsborough. When Steph is released from prison, she reveals that Max has full custody of Charlie and that they are living in Fiji.\n\nA few years later, Lyn brings Charlie back to Erinsborough, promising him a surprise. They end up spending the day with Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne). At the Harold's Café, Charlie meets Jimmy Williams (Darcy Tadich), who tells him that he enjoys spending time with Steph, who is living on Ramsay Street. Charlie leaves the café to see Steph. She explains to him that she has been ill and did not want him to see her that way. Steph shows Charlie some letters she wrote to him, but never posted, and he softens towards her. As Lyn prepares to take him back to Bendigo, Charlie promises Steph that he will not tell Max about his visit. Charlie returns a couple of weeks later, having caught the train from Bendigo to come and see Steph. Lyn comes to collect him, and she and Steph let Charlie spend time with Jimmy. When Charlie and Jimmy argue, Steph struggles to tell him off and he runs away when he learns she has been giving Jimmy presents. He watches Steph fix her motorbike and comes back to help her. Shortly after, Charlie's stepmother Philippa Hoyland (Wendy Bos) turns up, having checked on Charlie's phone location while she was in Sydney. She collects Charlie, and is satisfied that Steph did not instigate any of the meetings with him. Steph video calls Charlie, but he tells her he wants to stay in Fiji and that he knows she was sick again. Charlie then ends the call. Philippa and Max later allow Charlie to spend time with Steph. Charlie rejects Steph's gift of a bicycle, and tells Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) that he is scared as he had a recent bike accident back home. He also voices his concerns about Steph relapsing, after Philippa told him that Steph was ill during mediation. Charlie opens up to Steph and makes a pact not to get stressed about her. Mark arranges for them to spend time in a police car and Charlie decides to try out the bike. He also tells Steph that he approves of Mark becoming her boyfriend. After standing up for Jimmy, who was being teased for his mother's past employment, Charlie is locked in a dumpster by Archie Quill and his friends, and rescued just in time. Charlie returns to live with Max and Philippa in Fiji and Steph decides not to seek custody again.\n\nCameron Robinson\n\n[edit]\n\nCameron RobinsonNeighbours characterPortrayed byAdam HunterFirst appearance28 March 2006Last appearance6 September 2006ClassificationFormer; recurringIntroduced byRic Pellizzeri\n\nIn-universe informationOccupationArchitectFamilyRobinsonFatherPaul RobinsonMotherGail RobinsonBrothersRobert RobinsonSistersElle RobinsonHalf-brothersDavid Tanaka\n\nLeo Tanaka\n\nAndrew RobinsonHalf-sistersAmy WilliamsGrandfathersJim Robinson\n\nIan Chadwick\n\nRob LewisGrandmothersAnne Robinson\n\nLouise Hampstead\n\nBrenda Lewis\n\nCameron Robinson, played by Adam Hunter, made his first on-screen appearance on 28 March 2006. Cameron is one of three children (triplets) born to Paul Robinson and Gail Robinson.[9] Ruth Deller of television website, Lowculture, called Cameron \"an all-round nice guy (who was bumped off by Max Hoyland, as if we didn't have enough reason to hate that bloke).\"[9]\n\nCameron grew up in Tasmania with Gail (Fiona Corke), his sister Elle (Pippa Black) and identical twin, Robert (Adam Hunter). Cameron developed a close bond with Elle and they made up nicknames for Robert and kept journals about him. Cameron began work in an architects office, before realising that he wanted to train as a nurse. Robert engineered a car crash and Cameron is left in a coma in a small country hospital. Robert then steals Cameron's identity and goes to Erinsborough to carry out a revenge plan against his father, Paul. Cameron wakes from his coma and is unable to understand how he had lost two months of his life. He hides when he hears someone coming and when Robert comes into the room, Cameron knocks him out and steals his clothes. He goes to Ramsay Street and he is arrested for all of Robert's crimes, including planting a bomb in Elle's car and killing three of Paul's neighbours. Cameron remains adamant that he is innocent, while Robert gets into his hospital bed. Cameron pleads with Gail and claims that he had been set up.\n\nRobert pretends to wake from his coma and convinces Paul and Gail that Cameron is the real psycho. The family visit Cameron in jail and he tries to tell them that he had been set up, but they refuse to believe him. Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) is assigned to the case, despite not believing in Cameron's innocence. The police find a shed, set up by Robert, containing diaries and plans in Cameron's name.

Robert's plan is uncovered and he runs away, while Cameron is released. During a lunch with Paul, Gail and Izzy Hoyland (Natalie Bassingthwaighte), Cameron starts flirting with Lilly DeRouge (Klara Lisy). However, Paul steals Lilly away from him. Cameron decides to stay in town to help Paul to be a better man. Cameron asks Carmella Cammeniti (Natalie Blair) to speak to Paul and they become friends.

When he sees Katya running towards him and Cameron chasing her, as she had forgotten her bag, Max drives into Cameron. At the hospital, Cameron makes Paul promise to be a better person. Cameron is later rushed into surgery, but he does not survive the operation.\n\nRobert Robinson\n\n[edit]\n\nRobert RobinsonNeighbours characterPortrayed byAdam HunterDuration2006–2007, 2019–2020First appearance28 March 2006 ( )Last appearance6 January 2020 (2020-01-06)ClassificationFormer; recurringIntroduced byRic Pellizzeri (2006)\n\nJason Herbison (2019)Spin-off\n\nappearancesNeighbours vs Time Travel (2017)\n\nIn-universe informationOther namesCameron RobinsonOccupationHospital orderlyFamilyRobinsonFatherPaul RobinsonMotherGail RobinsonBrothersCameron RobinsonSistersElle RobinsonHalf-brothersHalf-sistersAmy WilliamsDaughtersHarlow Robinson\n\nRobert Robinson, played by Adam Hunter, made his first full appearance on 28 March 2006. The character's initial appearance, credited as \"mysterious figure\", was portrayed by body double Richard Swanson on 24 October 2005. Robert is one of three children born to Paul Robinson and Gail Robinson.[10] Hunter reprised the role in 2017 for the five-part web series Neighbours vs Time Travel.[11] Hunter reprised the role again two years later and Robert's return scenes aired on 15 July 2019, as Robert agrees to meet his half-brother David Tanaka (Takaya Honda).[12]\n\nRuth Deller of television website Lowculture, praised Robert, calling him the \"best psycho the street had seen since, well, Michael Martin.\"[9] She added \"[He] ran off, hopefully to return and wreak havoc in the future.\"[9] In late 2007, Deller called for the return of Robert, saying \"RobRob [..] must return soon to cause havoc. Particularly if that havoc involves clearing out the cast of some deadwood as it did last time round. Good times.\"[13] The Daily Mirror named Robert one of the \"Top ten most evil soap villains\".[14] They said \"Behind the chiselled good looks of businessman Paul Robinson's son, lurked the mind of a psycho – one who went to increasingly twisted lengths to slaughter the good people of Erinsborough.\"[14]\n\nRobert is resentful towards his father for being absent and becomes withdrawn as he grows up. His sister Elle (Pippa Black) and identical twin, Cameron (Hunter) gang up on him and keep him away from their friendship circles. Robert hatches a plan to destroy his father and everyone close to him. The first part of the plan saw him plant a bomb on a plane, which Paul, Elle and other residents use for a joy flight to Tasmania. The plane explodes and kills three of Paul's neighbours. Robert causes a car accident, which leaves Cameron in a coma and Robert goes to Erinsborough as Cameron. Robert decides to target Dylan Timmins (Damien Bodie) and makes sure Paul is left doubting whether Dylan could be trusted. Robert causes some shelves to fall on Elle and Paul sacks Dylan. Robert then turns his attentions to Paul's girlfriend, Izzy Hoyland (Natalie Bassingthwaighte). When she is babysitting her nephew, Charlie (Aaron Aulsebrook-Walker) Robert turns the gas on, causing Izzy to pass out. Izzy and Charlie are saved by Charlie's grandmother, Lyn Scully (Janet Andrewartha) and Robert's plan fails.\n\nRobert gets a job at Erinsborough Hospital and meets Katya Kinski (Dichen Lachman). He struggles as he has had little experience with women, when he and Katya grow close. Robert tells Cameron that he did not think about falling in love and he would have to get rid of her. Robert takes Katya for a picnic, but he saves her when she falls over a cliff, as he does not want her to go. Robert later murders Shawn Dempster (Colin MacPherson), a businessman that Katya, Paul and Izzy knew. Robert flirts with Izzy and records several conversations with her. He patches them together and makes it sound like Izzy had flirted with him. Paul throws Izzy out and Robert breaks up with Katya. Robert plants a bomb in Elle's car and goes to see Cameron, who wakes up and hits him. Paul and Izzy work out who is behind all of the events and they call Elle, who escapes her car. Cameron is arrested for Robert's crimes and Robert pretends he is the one in the coma. Gail (Fiona Corke) then returns to Erinsborough and when Robert sees Paul and Gail kissing, he tells Gail not to get back with Paul.\n\nRobert takes Paul camping and ties him up in a mineshaft. Robert makes the mineshaft collapse on Paul and he heads to Ramsay Street. He kidnaps Katya, drugs her and ties her up in the back of a camper van. Robert hears that Paul and Gail are getting married again and goes to stop the wedding. Robert arrives and shoots Paul, but he is caught by the police. Robert realises that Paul had been wearing a bulletproof vest. Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) visits him, trying to find out what had happened to Connor O'Neill (Patrick Harvey). Robert hides from the staff at the prison, leading them to believe that he had escaped. This leads to Max Hoyland (Stephen Lovatt) killing Cameron by mistake. A few months later, Robert goes to Max's trial and Toadie proves that Robert is still dangerous, when he makes him think he is with Katya. Robert snaps and threatens to make Paul pay.\n\nTwelve years later, Robert's half brother David Tanaka applies to visit him in prison, as part of his studies into psychopathic tendencies. Robert agrees to the visit and is seen by David and his husband Aaron Brennan (Matt Wilson). As Robert is about to speak, Paul appears and Robert abruptly leaves. He subsequently declines any further visitation requests, including that of his daughter Harlow Robinson (Jemma Donovan), whose existence he discovered while in jail. Months later, Robert agrees to meet Harlow. He apologises and tells her that he wants to get to know her better. He learns that Harlow is living with Paul and that he has recently married again. Robert explains that it was a challenge meeting David in person, when Paul showed up. Harlow tells Robert that David is seriously ill and needs a kidney transplant. Robert agrees to get tested and passes the first two tests. He later meets with Paul and his wife Terese Willis (Rebekah Elmaloglou) to tell them that he will donate his kidney if he is moved to a minimum security prison closer to Harlow - Paul agrees. Robert is brought to Erinsborough Hospital and David thanks him for being his donor. However, before the surgery, and with everyone believing he has been sedated, Robert assaults the guard removing his handcuffs and flees the hospital in a stolen ambulance. He drives to the Lassiters Complex and watches Paul, before making his way to Ramsay Street. Robert sees that a heavily pregnant Elly Conway (Jodi Anasta) has recognised him and he forces her inside Number 28, where he holds her at knifepoint and she goes into labour. When Finn Kelly (Rob Mills) hears Elly's screams, he runs inside to help and Robert orders him to deliver the baby. Elly gives birth to a daughter and Robert leaves the house. After stealing a phone, he calls Harlow and asks her to meet him with some money. Robert tells Harlow that he will send for her when he is settled, but she persuades him to return to the hospital and go through with the transplant by promising to visit him every week. After the surgery, Robert is taken back to the prison to recover in the hospital there. Harlow and David later visit him and David expresses his gratitude for what Robert did for him. Robert asks after Elly and then says that what he did was stupid, but he panicked. Paul enters the room and watches on as Harlow and Robert discuss books, before deciding that he wants to talk with Robert alone. Paul asks why Robert came after him, and Robert explains that he just wanted to tell Paul that he was letting go of all the anger towards him for Harlow's sake. Just before he leaves the room, Paul thanks Robert for saving David's life.\n\nMishka Schneiderova\n\n[edit]\n\nMishka SchneiderovaNeighbours characterPortrayed byDeborah KennedyFirst appearance17 April 2006Last appearance24 November 2006ClassificationFormer; recurringIntroduced byRic Pellizzeri\n\nIn-universe informationOccupationBoutique Owner\n\nGeneral Store assistant\n\nAir HostessHusbandIgorSonsGregor\n\nMishka Schneiderova, played by Deborah Kennedy, made her first on-screen appearance on 17 April 2006.

Mishka tells Karl that she has a husband and son back in Russia and Karl encourages her to be honest with Lou. Mishka tells Lou that her husband is a political prisoner and she had to get a fake passport in order to leave Russia, so she is an illegal immigrant.\n\nMishka settles into the community and becomes a regular at the Russian club. She and Lou begin brewing their own vodka, but after Harold finds out, he tells them to move out.

Two men from the Russian Embassy arrive and Mishka is told that she could stay in the country if she went with them to sign some papers. Mishka does not return as she has been kidnapped.\n\nLou flies to Moscow and Mishka tells him to go home. She pushes him down the stairs to save him from her husband, who had been freed. Lou does not remember much of his trip and he tries to move on from Mishka. However, Mishka turns up after getting a job with a Russian airline and they get back together. Mishka discovers that the airline is cutting the Moscow-Melbourne route and Mishka applies for residency in Australia. They have to convince the officials that they had been a couple for more than two years and invent a back story. However, they decide to be honest and it works, until Mishka tries to give the officer a bribe. Mishka is then taken away and sent back to Russia.\n\nAnne Baxter\n\n[edit]\n\nAnne BaxterNeighbours characterPortrayed byTessa JamesDuration2006–2007First appearance10 August 2006Last appearance13 July 2007ClassificationFormer; recurringIntroduced byRic Pellizzeri\n\nIn-universe informationOccupationStudentFatherKim TimminsMotherJanelle TimminsAdoptive fatherGreg BaxterAdoptive motherBrenda BaxterBrothersDwayne Timmins\n\nBrandon Timmins\n\nDylan Timmins\n\nScott TimminsSistersJanae Timmins\n\nBree TimminsGrandmothersLoris Timmins\n\nAnne Baxter, played by Tessa James, made her first on-screen appearance on 10 August 2006.

Anne tells Bree that she is her biggest fan and when people starts to walk out of the reading, Anne defends her.
