My heartbeat is to glorify God and serve Him forever. To that end God has called me to carry out that task through education. I received my bachelor’s from the University of Northern Iowa in Social Science Education.

Our job as Christian educators is to help our students press on in their faith and biblical worldview. I will lead with this conviction that we must press on in our faith, work, responsibilities, and become more like Christ every day.\n\nI’ve been married to the love of my life, Sarah, since 2003. We have four children, Jack-rising 9th grade, Lydia-rising 7th grade, Holly-rising 5th grade, and Bethany-rising 4th grade.
