        "text": "Rod Williams: [to Detective Latoya and two other detectives] Then he sent me some weird pictures. I'm like, \"Ah man, that's Andre Hayworth.\" This dude's been missing for 6 months, right? So I do all my research, you know, 'cause as a TSA agent. You know, you guys are detectives. You know, I got the same training. We might know more than y'all sometimes, you know, 'cause we are dealing with some terrorist shit, so... but that's a totally different story. So look, I-I go do my... my detective work, right? And I start putting pieces together. And see, this is what I came up with. They're probably abducting black people, brainwashing them and making them slaves... or sex slaves. Not just regular slaves, but sex slaves and shit. See? I don't know if it's the hypnosis that's making 'em slaves or what not, but all I know is they already got two brothas we know and there could be a whole bunch of brothas they got already. What's the next move?\n\n[after a few seconds, the three detectives look at each other and burst out hysterically in laughter]\n\nDetective Latoya: Don't ever, ever say that I don't do nothing anymore.\n\n[still laughing]\n\nDetective Latoya: Oh, white girls. They get you every time.\n\nChris Washington: I got hypnotized last night.\n\nRod Williams: Nigga, get the fuck outta here!\n\nChris Washington: No. Yo, yo, yeah it's to quit smoking. But Rose's mom's a psychiatrist, so...\n\nRod Williams: Bro, I don't care if the bitch is Iyanla Vanzant, okay? She can't fix my motherfuckin' life. You ain't getting in my head.\n\nChris Washington: I know, she caught me off guard, right? But it's cool because... I'm cured. It worked!\n\nRod Williams: Bro, how you not scared of this, man? Look they could have made you do all types of stupid shit. They have you fuckin' barking like a dog. Flyin' around like you a fuckin' pigeon, lookin' ridiculous. Okay? Or, I don't know if you know this. But, white people love making people sex slaves and shit.\n\nChris Washington: Yeah, I'm pretty sure they are not a kinky sex family, dawg.\n\nRod Williams: Look, Jeffrey Dahmer was eatin' the shit out of niggas' heads. Okay? But that was after he fucked the heads. Do you think they saw that shit comin'? Hell no! Okay? They were coming over there like \"I'm just gonna suck a little dick, maybe jiggle some balls or shit.\" No! They didn't get a chance to jiggle shit because their head was off their fuckin' body! Yeah, they still sucked the dick, but without their heads. It was fuckin' weird detached heads shit. You know, that's Jeffrey Dahmer's business.\n\nChris Washington: Thanks for that image right there, man.\n\nRod Williams: Hey man, I ain't makin' this shit up. I saw it on A&E. That is real life.\n\nChris Washington: Yo, and the black people out here too. It's like all of them missed the movement.\n\nRod Williams: It's because they probably hypnotized. Look bro, all I'm doin' is connectin' the dots. I'm takin' what you presented to me, okay? I'm gonna tell you this, I think that mom is puttin' everybody in a trance and she's fuckin' the shit out of 'em.\n\nChris Washington: Do they know I'm - Do they know I'm black?\n\nRose Armitage: No. Should they?\n\nChris Washington: It seems like something you might want to, you know, mention.\n\nRose Armitage: Mom and Dad, my black boyfriend will be coming up this weekend and I just don't want you to be shocked that he's a black man - a black.\n\nChris Washington: So, I was the first black guy you ever dated.\n\nRose Armitage: Yeah, so what?\n\nChris Washington: Yeah, so this is uncharted territory for them. You know, I don't want to get chased off the lawn with a shotgun.\n\nRose Armitage: You're not going to. First of all, my Dad would have voted for Obama a third time if he could've. Like, the love is so real."
