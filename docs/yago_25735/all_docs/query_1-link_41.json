Clark Jr.\n\nBorn: Jan. 6, 1993, in Kansas City, Mo.\n\nHometown: Kansas City, Mo.\n\nHigh School: Lee's Summit West\n\nCollege: Lindsey Wilson College, 2015\n\nWife: Alexis\n\nDaughter: Zara\n\nCoaching Experience\n\n2017-19:\n\nSunrise Christian Academy (Kan.), assistant coach\n\n2019-20:\n\nIllinois-Chicago, assistant coach\n\n2020-21:\n\nAustin Peay, assistant coach\n\n2021-Present:\n\nTennessee, assistant coach\n\nCLARK'S NBA DRAFT PICKS\n\nYear Name, Pos Round (Overall) Team 2022 Kennedy Chandler, G 2nd (38) San Antonio 2023 Julian Phillips, F 2nd (35) Chicago 2024 Dalton Knecht, G 1st (17) Los Angeles Lakers\n\nClark signed or coached each player listed above.\n\nRod Clark, then 28, was handpicked by Rick Barnes to join the University of Tennessee men’s basketball staff as an assistant coach in April 2021. A young and energetic rising star in the profession, Clark has helped the Volunteers to a 79-28 (.738) record through his first three years with the team.\n\n“We had an opportunity to be very selective in making this hire, and I couldn’t be more excited about adding Rod to our staff,” Barnes said when Clark was hired. “We weren’t the only high-major program who wanted him, but thankfully he wanted to be at Tennessee. He fits everything we prioritize in our program culture, and I know he is going to connect with our players in a special way.”\n\nBefore even arriving on Rocky Top, Clark played a role in developing players such as Kennedy Chandler (an eventual VFL), Shaq Harrison, Tyrese Maxey and Drew Timme. While at Tennessee, he has helped a Volunteer hear his name called in the NBA Draft each year.\n\nTennessee has appeared in every AP Top 25 poll through Clark’s first three years on staff, including finishing a program-best fifth twice. It has made the NCAA Tournament each year, claiming two Sweet 16 bids and an Elite Eight appearance, as well as won a pair of SEC titles.\n\nDuring Clark’s first year at Tennessee, 2021-22, the team went 27-8 (14-4 SEC) and won the SEC Tournament for the first time since 1979. The Volunteers knocked off four AP top-10 foes, tying a program record, and made the NCAA Tournament Round of 32.\n\nIn 2022-23, Tennessee posted a 25-11 (11-7 SEC) ledger and reached the Sweet 16. It went 5-1 versus AP top-15 foes, including defeating third-ranked Kansas to win the Battle 4 Atlantis title, taking down top-ranked Alabama and beating No. 12 Duke in the NCAA Tournament. The Volunteers finished first nationally in KenPom adjusted efficiency.\n\nDuring the recent 2023-24 campaign, Clark helped Tennessee go 27-9 (14-4 SEC) and advance to the Elite Eight for the second time ever. The Volunteers won the outright SEC regular season championship and tied a school record with seven AP top-25 victories, equaling the mark set during his first year at Tennessee, 2021-22. Dalton Knecht, whom Clark served as the lead recruiter for and worked closely with throughout the season, was a finalist for the Naismith Trophy and Wooden Awards, won SEC Player of the Year, claimed the Julius Erving Award and was a consensus First Team All-American. He was then selected No. 17 in the NBA Draft by the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nThrough three years on Rocky Top, Clark has tutored five players to seven total All-SEC honors. In addition, two individuals have earned SEC All-Freshman Team accolades and two players have combined for four SEC All-Defensive Team plaudits, including 2023-24 SEC Defensive Player of the Year Zakai Zeigler doing so thrice.\n\nA native of Kansas City, Mo., Clark spent the 2020-21 season as an assistant coach at Austin Peay State University in Clarksville, Tenn. The Governors posted a winning record and led the Ohio Valley Conference in offensive rebounding while ranking second in rebounding defense, third in turnover margin and fourth in scoring. Terry Taylor won OVC Player of the Year, finishing the season as the only player to rank among the Division I top 10 in both scoring (eighth, 21.6 ppg) and rebounding (seventh, 11.1 rpg).\n\nClark’s first stop as a collegiate coach came in the Horizon League as an assistant coach at the University of Illinois at Chicago in 2019-20. The Flames posted impressive defensive statistics, leading the league in field-goal percentage defense, 3-point defense (No. 14 nationally) and blocks per game. UIC finished the season with an impressive run to the 2020 Horizon League Tournament championship game.\n\nFor a two-year span from 2017-19, Clark honed his skills in player development, video breakdown and scouting as the top assistant coach at Sunrise Christian Academy, a national prep basketball powerhouse in Bel Aire, Kan.\n\nIn 2017-18, Sunrise Christian went 24-2 and finished the season ranked second nationally according to USA TODAY and MaxPreps. The 2018-19 squad followed with a 22-5 record, a year-end No. 10 ranking and the program’s first-ever appearance at GEICO Nationals.\n\nClark also spent time as a coach with the prestigious MoKan Elite program on the Nike EYBL circuit. MoKan Elite posted a 30-7 record in 2018 and reached the semifinals at the Nike Peach Jam. He built on that experience to guide MoKan Elite to the Peach Jam championship in 2019 with a roster that included Chandler, whom he later coached in 2021-22 at Tennessee.\n\nAs a collegiate player, Clark spent his first two seasons at the junior college level, first at Neosho Community College in Chaunte, Kan., and then Redlands Community College in El Reno, Okla. He concluded his career at Lindsey Wilson College, an NAIA school in Columbia, Ky., from which he received a degree in communications in 2015.\n\nClark and his wife, Alexis, reside in Knoxville, Tenn. They welcomed their first child—daughter, Zara—in July 2021."
