        "text": "When Rodd and I were getting to know one another in our first semester of medical school, we spent A LOT of time together. It wasn‚Äôt particularly romantic‚Äìit was sitting next to one another in lecture halls, maybe having lunch together in between, and studying near one another. In other words, our relationship was completely intertwined with our medical education. I quickly learned that Rodd is a genius test taker. He will score two standard deviations from the mean even when he knows nothing about the test‚Äôs content. He‚Äôs just really, really good at answering multiple choice questions accurately. I, on the other hand, am not. I mean, I‚Äôm good enough to have become a licensed physician, but I had a learning curve when it came to studying medical textbooks and preparing for exams. And, I was concerned about what my new boyfriend would think of me when he saw the gap in our scores. One of our classmates was married to a brilliant woman at another medical school. He often said to us in a variety of contexts, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt compare.‚Äù He knew how important it was to remain clear about each person‚Äôs human value in a relationship and not get caught in comparing test results. He was right, of course. He was right about not comparing test scores. He was right about not comparing when it came to how much time I got to spend with our new daughter when I arranged for lighter rotations and my husband was sleep-deprived all the time. He was right about not comparing how often we saw our parents, or how many friends each of us have, or how much money either of us is making. It‚Äôs also been extremely important to keep this in mind when it comes to personal growth. There have been very, very few times when we have been neck-in-neck, growing at the same rate. Far more often I might discover a training, or a book, or find a teacher‚Ä¶and I‚Äôll go all in. Inevitably, I find it frustrating that he‚Äôs lagging, holding me back, unable to keep up with my personal growth and expansive mindset. Then, all of a sudden, it will feel like Rodd has leap-frogged over me and I find myself unexpectedly ‚Äúbehind,‚Äù feeling confronted by our reversed positions. Sometimes one of us is the tortoise, and the other the hare. Other times it‚Äôs reversed. I‚Äôm sharing this because I have heard from countless frustrated spouses, yearning for their partners to ‚Äúdo the work‚Äù and meet them where they are. This is a real phenomenon. However, invariably, there‚Äôs a lot of hidden wisdom in that partner who‚Äôs behind. With patience, coaxing, and a wholehearted approach, that partner can blow your mind with their perceptions and articulation of truth. And you realize all that comparison never served you‚Äìit just created frustration, disappointment, and disconnection. If you want your partner to grow more, look at how you can soften, or lead, become a safer presence for whatever is keeping them captive in their own internal environment. And whatever you do, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt compare.‚Äù It isn‚Äôt helpful.\n\nDizziness is not a right of passage into the golden years! My #1 goal in vestibular education is improving access to skilled care, especially for those living in rural communities. Over the past two years, we have begun incoporating vestibular training for all new therapists, regardless of experience, using the course I created specifically for this purpose. Vestibular 101 consists of 2.5 hours of independent online work https://lnkd.in/g2fuvDhE followed by a 4 hour skills lab and can be implemented in any facility! This course provides instruction in differential diagnosis, thorough assessment and treatment techniques for BPPV and vestibular hypofunction, including a review of clinical practice guidelines. As our clinics incorporate PT into the emergency department, urgent care, primary care, we now have a larger bench of vestibular-trained therapists and can offer vestibular eval within 24 hours. It's a win-win-win! Providers have an option, PT's and OT's can assist in early management of a condition that can have a significant impact on patient's quality of life and safety, and patients have early access to the care they need within their community. Let me know if you would like to discuss how to implement this in your facility! If you would like an opportunity to implement this program at your facility, please complete this google form: https://lnkd.in/g5mZ4p9r\n\nAs a Med SLP for 15 years, I've seen the field evolve and expand in so many ways. But if I‚Äôm being honest, so many of my clinical peers and even SLP graduate students don‚Äôt have a full grasp of what all a #MedSLP does! So let‚Äôs get into it üëáüëáüëá Almost 40% of SLPs work in healthcare settings, including hospitals, outpatient facilities, and residential care facilities. About 20% are in private practice, which is where a huge level of autonomy and flexibility comes in. But what exactly does a day in the life of a Med SLP look like?? Well, it varies greatly depending on the setting, patient acuity, and job description. Nonetheless, ALL of our days are fast-paced and dynamic, with each patient case presenting new ways for innovation and growth as an SLP. We serve patients across the lifespan, from premature infants in the NICU to individuals in end-of-life hospice care. And even though we aren‚Äôt *technically* counselors, counseling plays a crucial role in our job ‚Äì helping patients and families navigate life-altering conditions and treatments. BUT did you know that Med SLPs can be found in the operating room or the burn unit?? Yeah, me neither, until I started working in the hospital. ü§∑üèº‚ôÄÔ∏è Here‚Äôs the deal, there's no one-size-fits-all approach to being a Med SLP. Whether you prefer acute care or private practice, specializing or remaining a generalist, the choice is yours. It's all about finding where you can make the greatest impact and feel fulfilled in your career! And if you haven‚Äôt found that special spot in this field that just feels right for you ‚Äì don‚Äôt sweat it. Oftentimes, it takes YEARS to find what we truly love (heck, it might even change a few times!) üíõ If you think you might need some outside perspective on navigating your career and, I have EXCITING news! This week & ONLY this week, the Collective is OPEN for enrollment! Comment ‚ÄúCOLLECTIVE‚Äù & I‚Äôll send you some info on how to get enrolled so you can get equipped with the tools, resources, and community you need to elevate your clinical career! #medslp #slp #slpmentorship\n\nLast week, after completing the final clinical hour requirements, my class got to celebrate the end of our Radiadition Therapy program with the annual pinning ceremony. It gave me the opportunity to reflect on all the hard work, dedication, and perseverance it took to get to the end. This was recognized by others as well, which resulted in me receiving the JRCERT award for clinical excellence and performance. I was unaware I would be receiving the award, so that surprise was the cherry on top! It was also quite eye opening. Ever since I was little, I have been extremely hard on myself. I‚Äôve held myself to sky high expectations; only perfection, no failure. While this outlook is what gave me my work ethic and dedication, leading me to an educational career of all As and multiple awards like the one I received today, the fear of failure is also what has hindered me for YEARS. It prevented me from having full confidence in myself, caused me to question my abilities, and resulted in unnecessary stress. However, through this intensive RT program, I learned that perfection is not an option. In fact, it is not desired. Just like many other careers out there, radiation therapy is an ever-evolving field, so it is important to put yourself in positions to evolve and grow with it. Without failure, there is no learning, no getting better, no evolving. I had to accept and become comfortable with this in order to become the best person and therapist possible. By receiving the award, it validated that imperfection leads to success as well; that failure and success are not mutually exclusive. Accepting this is definitely still a work in progress but we are getting there. For anyone else who has ever felt the same, just know it is ok to not be perfect; no one is or ever will be! Although this is the ending of one journey, it is just the beginning of another. It takes a village to get through one of the most rigorous programs in the country, and that‚Äôs exactly what I had. Thankful for all the support that got me here! Goodbye SLU, thank you for everything you‚Äôve taught me üíô"
