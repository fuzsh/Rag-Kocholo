        "text": "Fremont native Chris Rodd was told he’d never play soccer again after having surgery in 2010 to repair a severely broken foot.\n\nThe former Norwegian professional spent 2011 in a wheelchair and for the past few years coached at De La Salle High and Bay Area youth teams.\n\nNow Rodd, 28, hopes to continue a career as a central defender for the New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League. On Friday, the Cosmos signed the former San Ramon Valley High and USF star. The season opens in August.\n\nRodd played with the semi-pro Sonoma County Sol last year when realizing, “My foot doesn’t hurt. I can train.”\n\nRodd, the 2002 North Coast Section player of the year, broke his foot during a tryout with Sheffield United in 2009.\n\n“My heart was broken,” Rodd said. “It was an easy fix.”\n\nThe Cosmos, once America’s best-known soccer club, have proposed to build a privately funded 25,000-seat stadium in Belmont Park on Long Island.\n\nColleges\n\nStanford’s Kori Carter captured the women’s 400-meter hurdles in a collegiate-record 53.21 seconds at the NCAA outdoor track and field championships in Eugene, Ore.\n\nCarter broke the mark of 53.54 set by UCLA’s Sheena Johnson at the 2004 NCAA championships. It was also the fastest time in the world this season. Arizona’s Georganne Moline placed second in 53.72 at Hayward Field.\n\nAlso, LSU’s Natoya Goule won the women’s 800 in 2 minutes, 0.06 seconds. Stanford’s Justine Fedronic was third at 2:01.67, and teammate Amy Weissenbach sixth at 2:02.29.\n\nCal’s Amanda Hunter triple-jumped a personal-best 43 feet, 3 1/4 inches to finish 12th.\n\nSonoma State senior Harmen Sidhu won the 2013 Tino Martinez Award, which is presented annually to the most outstanding player in NCAA Division II baseball.\n\nSidhu (College Park High) went 10-1 with a 0.98 ERA and 93 strikeouts in 82 2/3 innings. His ERA was tops in Division II.\n\nPlay at the Palmer Cup was suspended due to inclement weather at the Wilmington (Del.) Country Club. Best-ball matches will resume Saturday. Cal’s Michael Kim and Michael Weaver are playing for the U.S., and Joël Stalter is with Team Europe.\n\nStanford’s Patrick Rodgers and Justin Thomas were 1-up through two holes against Europe’s Greg Eason and Ben Taylor. Alex Carpenter and Cory Whitsett were 1-up after one hole against Julien Brun and Stalter. The Kim-Weaver vs. Gary Hurley-Kevin Phelan match hadn’t begun.\n\nAFL\n\nThe SaberCats (7-3), who lost to Spokane 75-45 last weekend to snap a five-game win streak, host Pittsburgh (3-7) at HP Pavilion on Saturday night. Quarterback Mitch Mustain is expected to make his first AFL start in relief of Russ Michna, who got knocked out of the Shock game as a result of blow to the head.\n\nSan Jose signed Zack Eskridge as insurance during Michna’s absence. The Power is led by quarterback Steven Sheffield (21 touchdown passes and 267.2 yards passing per game).\n\nBaseball\n\nThe St. Louis Cardinals announced the death of Jeanine Duncan — the wife of former A’s and Cardinals pitching coach Dave Duncan and the mother of former major-leaguers Chris and Shelley Duncan. Jeanine Duncan, who had battled a malignant brain tumor for some time, was 64.\n\n“They were the perfectly matched couple that raised two great sons,” former Oakland and St. Louis manager Tony La Russa told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. “Dave’s strong, silent character versus Jeanine’s wonderful outgoing embrace-all personality.”\n\nStaff writer Steve Corkran, the Associated Press and wire services contributed to this report."
