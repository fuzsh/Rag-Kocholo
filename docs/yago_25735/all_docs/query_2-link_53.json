        "text": "Wendy Kaye Twomey (née Rodd) passed away peacefully on Saturday, Feb. 10, 2024. Wendy was preceded in death by her beloved parents, George and Arlene. Wendy is survived by her siblings, Randy (Connie), Tayna, Kerry (Roni), Timm (Nancy), Scott and Kipp. Wendy is also survived by her children, Christina Jungbauer (Mike), Kyle Kiminski (Erin), Connor Twomey and Patrick Twomey. She is also survived by three grandchildren whom she adored, Carolyn, Kameron and Kyleigh.\n\nWendy was born on Sept, 24, 1956, in Cloquet. She grew up with her five brothers and her sister in Scanlon, and graduated from Cloquet High School in 1973, where she was an active member of the majorettes and cheerleading squads. Wendy maintained close friendships from childhood throughout her life, staying connected with those who knew her best, up to the moment of her passing. She married Steve Kiminski, with whom she raised Christina and Kyle. Wendy was later married to Mike Twomey, with whom she raised Connor and Patrick. Driven by her unwavering love for her family, Wendy worked tirelessly in various roles, including in a law firm, overnight shifts at hotels, various office jobs in the Twin Cities area and many more. Wendy spent both the beginning and the end of her life in the Cloquet area, but also lived for 30 years in Eagan and Apple Valley. Wendy spent the final years of her life again living in Scanlon with her brother Kipp, whom she cherished so much.\n\nWendy took after her mother and was an avid reader, often completing multiple books in a week. She was also remarkable at completing puzzles of any type. Wendy also enjoyed traveling, including trips to dozens of state parks, a multitude of national parks, and at least 10 MLB stadiums to see the Twins play. Wendy was also a passionate supporter of the Vikings and the Wild, along with the Cloquet Lumberjacks and her children and grandchildren's numerous teams. Many of Wendy's recipes will also be treasured for years to come, as she was a tremendous cook.\n\nAbove all else, Wendy will always be remembered as a devoted daughter, sister, friend, mother and grandmother, whose nurturing spirit and endless love enriched the lives of all who knew her. A model of compassion and kindness, Wendy selflessly gave of herself to her family, friends and community, leaving an indelible mark on countless hearts. Her legacy of love and care will continue to resonate long after her passing, a testament to the incredible woman she was.\n\nOn Wendy's behalf, the family expresses our deepest gratitude to everyone who supported and visited her in her final days. We would especially like to thank Roni and Tif Rodd for their tremendous care and grace in supporting Wendy. We would thank the entire staff at Essentia Health-St. Mary's Medical Center for their tremendous care of Wendy in her final weeks.\n\nCelebration of Life details will be shared with family and friends at a later date. In lieu of flowers, please consider making a donation in Wendy's name to the March of Dimes, which she supported for many years."
