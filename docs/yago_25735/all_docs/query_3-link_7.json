        "text": "Owner Alan Steiger founded Steiger Craft in 1972 on the site of his grandfather’s former wholesale bakery that was purchased in the late 1800’s and operated into the 20th century. Alan’s grandfather, Santo Manino came from Italy and operated Manino’s bakery located on the same property that the family currently retains. Alan Steiger remembers growing up above the bakery, his now office was where he spent most of childhood raised by his parents. Steiger, an only child, never enjoyed working for the family business and always had dreams of his own.\n\nRather than staying in the family business Alan had other plans for his future. He entered high school and began selling supplies to other clammers and designing wooden clamming boats. He worked in the small wood shop located in the back of the property which is where he slowly transitioned into a full-time boat builder.\n\nInitially, all the craft were wood, but by 1975 Al had switched to fiberglass construction all done by hand —no robots or machines involved. These days, the only significant part of the boat that contains wood is the transom, the back wall of the hull.\n\nAlthough Steiger Craft boats were originally designed for the shallow waters of the bay, in the mid-1990s Steiger developed deep-V bottom boats for recreational ocean fishing. Today, Steiger Craft is known as a premier builder of sport fishing boats with the world’s most proven pilot house.\n\nAlan Steiger and the Steiger Craft family of employees are proud that almost everything that goes into the boat is made on-site. The molds used to create the hull and other components of the boat are also made by the talented and capable team of boatbuilders, many who have been with Steiger Craft for 30-40 years. Anything wood or fiberglass is made at Steiger whereas other components such as canvas, bow rails, swim ladders, and more are bought from local vendors."
