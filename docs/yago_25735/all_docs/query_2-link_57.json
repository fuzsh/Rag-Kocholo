        "text": "Funeral Service: Saturday, April 2, 2011 at 1:00 p.m. at Stevenson & Sons Funeral Home in Miles City.\n\nInterment: Brockway Cemetery\n\nRobert Wolff passed away on Sunday, March 20, 2011 at Highgate Assisted Living in Billings, Montana at the age of 88.\n\nHe was born on November 4, 1922 on his parents homestead in Prairie County, Montana, the fourth of twelve children born to German-Russian immigrants Christian and Christina (Rath) Wolff. The family moved to a farm south of Brockway, Montana when Robert was a young boy. He spent most of his life working on the family farm and this farm was his home for nearly 80 years.\n\nRobert attended the rural Berry School through the 8th grade when his formal education ended. Because of the Great Depression, his family could not afford to send him to high school and his help was needed on the farm. In 1939, Robert was confirmed in the rural Zion German Congregational Church along with his brother, Aldo. This church was later moved to Circle, Montana, where it became part of the Circle Museum. Robert served in the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1939-1940 at the Nine Mile Camp near Missoula. This was his first time away from home and a memorable experience for him.Robert married Anna Wangen of Brockway, Montana in 1946 and they made their home on his parents farm and ranch where they raised cattle and grain. When Robert and Anna retired, they moved to Miles City where they lived for a few years. Because of declining health, they moved to Billings in 2009. Anna passed away shortly thereafter.\n\nRoberts life was governed by the rhythm of the seasons, caring for cattle through the winters, spring calving, and seeding and harvesting during the growing seasons. Robert loved his farm and would have spent the rest of his life there had he been able. He enjoyed a good game of pinochle and played countless games of crazy eights and Chinese checkers with his children and grandchildren. He was a quiet and unassuming man who loved and enjoyed his family and friends. He was proud that all four of his children and all of his grandchildren attended college even though he had to end his education after the 8th grade.\n\nRobert is survived by his children Dennis Wolff (Karen) of Circle, MT and their children Eric (Denelle) and Kristi (Jeff Schwartz); Benna Tiensvold (Mel) of Prescott, AZ; Robin Wolff (Rodd Hamman) of Billings, MT and their son Alex; and Laura Zimmerman (Ric) of Billings, MT and their children Ben and Bryan. He is also survived by three great-grandchildren and a fourth expected to arrive in June. His surviving brothers and sisters are Laura Wells, Palma Chambers, Florence Zwicker, Marion Schleining, and Leonard, Ralph, and Harold Wolff. He is also survived by a sister-in-law, Gladys Wangen Cole and many extended family members. He was preceded in death by his wife, Anna, of 63 years; his parents; two brothers, Clarence and Aldo; sisters Anna Wolff Young and Altina.\n\nThe family wishes to extend a special thank you to the staff of Highgate Assisted Living for their kind and loving care of both Dad and Mom.\n\nFuneral services will be held on Saturday, April 2, 2011 at 1:00 p.m. at Stevenson & Sons Funeral Home in Miles City. Interment will be held in the Brockway Cemetery. Stevenson & Sons Funeral Home of Miles City is in charge of the arrangements.
