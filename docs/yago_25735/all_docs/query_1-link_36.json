        "text": "Rodd Foster passed away peacefully on Sunday, June 6, 2021 at his home in The Villa, Port Perry. Rodd will be remembered as a committed leader in his community, his church, his many interests and clubs, and in his family. His story telling and sense of humor were well known to all his family and friends.\n\nRodd was the eldest child of Reg and Velma Foster of Greenbank. Rodd and his extraordinary wife and companion in life, Marie Foster, now deceased, also made Greenbank their home. They raised five children who mourn their loss and celebrate their lives: Lynne (Bob Rose), Reg (Maryann Jablonowski), Don (Wendy Lee), John (Kathy Smith), and Laurie (Normand Leduc). Their wonderful son Don passed away a few years ago and remains in the heart of the family. Rodd’s dear brother Doug predeceased him and he is survived by his sister Bonnie and her husband Bill Beer, brother Steve and his wife Sharon and sister-in-law Wanda Foster.\n\nRodd was an ardent supporter of many aspects of the Greenbank and Port Perry communities. He served on his church and hall boards, the hospital board, and was tireless in improving and maintaining the Greenbank Park. He was one of the initiators and leaders of the popular Greenbank Barbeque. Rodd helped to form the Greenbank Lions Club and led it for many years. He was a compassionate and generous supporter of many local good causes. The friends and neighbors who worked with Rodd on these community projects evoked his admiration and gratitude. He said often that this coming together as a community was what made Greenbank a special place.\n\nRodd was an avid sportsman. He was an outstanding basketball player at Port Perry High School where he and Marie became young sweethearts. As a younger man he played baseball with Brooklyn and was a prime mover in the creation of the Greenbank Gamblers, a team that won many titles and tournaments under his management. His curling exploits led to many bonspiel and Port Perry Curling Club victories. He was a devoted fan of the Maple leafs and Blue Jays, and followed the Blue Jays to Florida for many years, where Marie loved to walk on the beach and Rodd attended the spring training games.\n\nRodd spent his entire career at General Motors and was a loyal ‘GM man’ throughout his life. Family members visiting Rodd and Marie in non-GM vehicles were forbidden for many years to park in his driveway. His many friends and colleagues at GM formed a network he deeply valued.\n\nRodd and Marie were loving and caring grandparents and great grandparents. They cherished nothing more than being surrounded by their grandchildren: Chris and Justin Kubbinga; Andrew and Brett Foster; Mike, Emma and Sam Foster; and Janelle and Daniel Leduc, and their ten great-grandchildren. Rodd was a reliable provider of chewing gum for the younger members of the clan, which was always accompanied by a joke and some advice."
