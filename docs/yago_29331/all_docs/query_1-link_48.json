        "text": "Here is my old essay.\n\nIn the years 895-896 the Magyars, led by their leader Arpad, invaded central Europe destroying the old Eastern European power structures of the day. The Bulgarian Empire was driven below the Danube, and Great Moravia collapsed soon after. This event set the stage for the development of new powers within east central Europe; Hungary under Stephen I, and Poland under Mieszko I and Boleslaw the Brave emerged as new kingdoms in the 11th century. Poland’s initial unity under its founders did not last, and it fragmented into nine duchies and provinces. Hungary stayed united however, and the crown of St. Stephen achieved a certain level of awe and respect among Hungarians that the Polish crown never achieved in Poland. This long line of Hungarian Kings, the Arpads, did not survive forever and their last king, Andrew III, died in January 1301. The Arpads weren’t the only dynasty dying out however. The Czech Přemyslid dynasty, and the Polish Piast dynasty, would also end by the close of the 14th century. This extinction of houses allowed new political dynasties to move in, and among the most important were the Angevins of Hungary under whom both Hungary and Poland would enter into their first union. The first union would be under Louis I and the second under Władysław III/I. Though the actual total of years that Poland and Hungary were in union together was only sixteen, they played a key role in the development of both Poland and Hungary, and established a lasting friendship.\n\nReasons for the Union of Hungary and Poland​\n\nIn the medieval period, Poland and Hungary were remarkably similar to each other and shared a number of common mutual interests. In terms of feudal structure, both had noble families organised around a clan structure , and the mounted warfare of the plains led to a massive number of nobles in both kingdoms. Only Spain, out of every other European country, had a similar number of nobles. The two kingdoms both tied themselves with Rome at around the same time in order to strengthen their positions against the German Emperor, and sought to control the churches within their own kingdoms in order to increase their power. Strong anti-German sentiment was prevalent in Hungary and even more so in Poland. Just before Władysław I Łokietek took the throne in 1320, the Bohemian Přemyslids had taken the throne of Poland with Imperial aid and the last Přemyslid, Vaclav III, was murdered by the Poles at Olomouc to prevent him from cementing his power. However, this end of the Přemyslid dynasty only allowed the ambitious Luxembourgs to take power. The expansion of the power and domains of the Luxembourg Emperor Charles IV, especially after his inheritance of Brandenburg alarmed the Poles so much that they sought increasing ties with Hungary in order to counterbalance his growing power. The Luxembourgs were not the only threat that faced Poland. The Tartars, Turkic warriors who had exploded onto the scene by destroying the Kievan Rus’, initiated devastating invasions of Poland and Hungary, with major attacks on Buda and Estergom in 1241. The Tartars retreated slightly, and thence forth had a more defined frontier with both the Poles and the Hungarians. The Tartars replaced Poland’s and Hungary’s old eastern Orthodox neighbours with a Muslim one, and created a new sense of mutual purpose for both Kingdoms. The Tartars marked a shift in mentality, as Hungary and Poland suddenly became acutely aware that they were at the geographic frontier of Western Catholicism. This began to be expressed as the concept of \"Antemurale Christianitatis.” The two kingdoms became the bulwarks of Catholicism, defending Catholic Europe from the heathens of the east. This mutual identity was enhanced by the most basic of all things: commerce. Poland and Hungary straddled the “Amber Road,” which was the trade route from the Baltic to the Black Sea and Constantinople. Amber, cloth, and salted herring went south, while Hungarian copper, along with goods from further south, moved north. All of these were strong reasons to unite the two kingdoms.\n\nLeadup to the Unions of Hungary and Poland​\n\nThe road to unification started with Charles Robert of Anjou, the first Angevin King of Hungary. With the extinction of the Arpads in 1301, Charles Robert of Anjou raced to claim his inheritance. He faced competition from others with worse, but still legitimate, claims in the form of the Přemyslids and the Wittelsbachs. Fortunately, the last Přemyslid was murdered in Poland, and the Wittelsbach claimant gave up after Croatia threw its lot in with Charles Robert, who then engaged in a long campaign across the country in order to bring it under his control. He finally assumed total control as Charles I of Hungary in 1308. Charles Robert was favoured by the majority of the nobility because he wasn’t connected to the Holy Roman Empire, and he used this support to reform his new Kingdom with great vigour. His centralising efforts produced a number of rebellions from the powerful magnates, with Charles crushing each revolt as it came along, using their defeats to strengthen himself. One rebel Charles never could fully defeat was Matthew Csák of Trenčín. A thorn in Charles’ side, Charles decided to encircle Matthew’s domain by allying himself with the kingdom north of Csák. This kingdom was of course Poland, which was being reunited under Władysław I Łokietek.\n\nWładysław I had been patiently building up his power for years, securing Krakow in 1306, all of Greater Poland by 1314, and in 1320 he was finally secure enough to have himself crowned King. Władysław I was able to bring four of the nine duchies under his control, though Masovia and the Silesian duchies would forever escape him. He gave the crown of Poland a permanence it never had before, stablising Poland into a kingdom that would last for centuries to come. To go along with his coronation, Władysław I celebrated by marrying off his fourteen year old daughter Elizabeth to Charles I of Hungary as part of a marriage alliance. Charles I, it would turn out, married well because it would be through Elizabeth, the older sister of the future Casimir III, that his son Louis would inherit the throne of Poland. Casimir III the Great, who inherited the throne in 1333 and would be the only Polish King to ever gain that epithet , was already deeply involved in the alliance cultivated by his father. Casimir had already visited Hungary in 1329, where he had an infamous love affair with a Hungarian noblewoman, but it was his visit in 1335 after he became King that was of utmost importance. The meeting was an arbitration organized by Charles I in order to reconcile Casimir with the Luxembourg family about their dispute over Silesia. It was during this meeting that Charles I sought to secure the throne of Poland for his sons, as Casimir had been married to his wife Anna of Lithuania for ten years and they were without children. Casimir agreed, and in 1339 he and his nobles had Charles I vow that in the event of his heir’s succession to the throne of Poland, the Angevins would help Poland conquer territories lost to the Teutonic Knights at Angevin expense, and to never appoint foreigners to positions within Poland. Charles I’s arbitration in 1335 allowed Casimir to forgo any claims to Silesia, and allowed him to focus on affairs to the east of Poland. Casimir was able to bring a fifth Polish duchy, Masovia, under his control in 1351 but it was Ruthenia where the Casimir expended the most effort in conquering. Casimir invaded in 1340 and siezed Lvov, though his gains would be soon lost in a revolt. It was under Casimir that Poland really re-oriented her interests towards the East, and Poland would fight numerous wars to gain control over Ruthenia and the Russian lands beyond such as Vladimir and Halicz, bringing him into on and off conflict with the Lithuanian princes. It was only in 1366 did the Poles gain full control over the disputed region, thus expanding the kingdom out of the Vistula-Oder basin, and into the Dnieper basin, almost doubling his father’s kingdom.\n\nLouis I, son of Charles I, played a large role in Casimir’s efforts. He had often helped his uncle protect these areas, with the understanding that they would fall to him once he inherited Poland. As Casimir’s reign continued without heirs, the importance of Louis securing the succession grew. Casimir had no legitimate sons, with all the ones claimed by him being born to other married women. In order to guarrantee his succesion, he agreed in 1351 to never appoint Germans to government positions, never to use Polish funds for Hungarian adventures, and only use funds given to him to sustain himself while staying in Poland. In 1355, he agreed to only use Polish troops for the defense or expansion of the Polish realm. It was during these agreements that the Polish Sejm took embryonic form. The Polish Sejm had not existed under Władysław I Łokietek or Casimir the Great. Władysław I had removed the provincial palatines and castellans from their administratvie duties, instead replacing them with royal appointees. The palatines and castellans instead became representatives of their provinces at court and in the King’s council. The Royal Council was a consultative body, but during their discussions with Louis they assumed a representative position for the country, and upon Casimir’s death, this was only enhanced. Casimir died during a hunting accident in 1370. In the ensueing medical complications, he died of pneumonia on November 5th.\n\nThe Reign of Louis the Great​\n\nLouis’ reign is viewed as one of Hungarian power. He never experienced any kind of noble or internal threat during his reign, having inherited a strong position from his father. He spent almost his entire reign, with it waning off as he got older, at war. His first war was in Southern Italy against his sister in law, who was greatly suspected in the assassination of Louis’ brother Andrew. He made war against her more than once, and was mostly successful but the outbreak of the black plague eventually defeated him. Louis was drawn away from Italy by an agreement he made with Pope Clement. Louis was a devout Catholic, and he kept close ties to the Papacy. It was then partly at Papal insistence, and the granting of the revenues of the Papal tenth by Clement VI, that Louis ended his wars against his Angevin cousins in Naples. The Pope granted Louis the right to any lands belonging to pagans, heretics, and infidels, thus driving Hungarian expansion south and east. Louis focused primarily on trying to dismember the very strong Serbian kingdom of Stephen Dushan which had occupied much of Greece and the southern Balkans. He waged numerous wars on Serbia, but it was only when Stephen Dushan finally died in 1355 that Louis was finally able to successfully make Serbia a vassal. Louis married his wife, Elizabeth of Bosnia, in order to solidify his claims on Bosnia. This proved insufficient to the Bosnians, and he was forced to wage wars numerous times until they were finally accepted him as overlord. He also waged wars on Wallachia at least three times, and even as far as Bulgaria in 1365. Despite his wars, or perhaps because of them, Louis’ frontiers were never truly secure. He waged war on the Moldavians quite often, second most only to the Serbians. He was constantly trying to bring them into his orbit, and waged war on them from 1359 to 1370. Moldavia would only finally submit in the years 1374-1377, when Władysław of Opole marched a Polish army down from Ruthenia and brought them under Louis’ control. Louis, like other 14th century rulers, preferred to keep Church revenues to himself for his projects and wars. Since he often waged wars against the enemies of the Church, he had a propaganda advantage over other western rulers who fought fellow Catholics all the time. He still had constant arguments with the Papacy over who would get the proceeds of the Papal tenth. Louis was still rather pragmatic towards his national interests, and used Church revenues to wage wars against his fellow Catholic Venetians for control of the Dalmatian coast. He waged war against them a number of times, and by the 1360’s, Louis was in his element. Louis I ruled over the largest territorial expanse any Hungarian King had or would ever possess. The 1360’s was the period of Louis’ greatest strength. He had consolidated his suzerainty over Serbia, defeated Venice, and conquered the northern portions of Bulgaria. He was disinterested in wars against the Turks though he was often called to wage a crusade against them. He did nothing in the 1360’s however, and in the 1370’s he became consumed with matters of his succession. He only ever acted to protect his conquests in the south, and never actively acted against the Ottomans.\n\nWith Casimir the Great’s death in 1370, Louis rushed to Poland to affirm his succession to the crown. He had been worried that Casimir had been planning to change his succession plans in favour of his own grandson through one of his legitimate daughters, who was also named Casimir. He need not have worried, since Duke Casimir would actually prove loyal, unlike others, and died fighting for Louis. After his coronation Louis rarely visited Poland, instead ruling through regents. Armed resistance against his rule continued throughout his reign, with some rebels still being in the field on his death in 1382. Louis was generally prudent in not putting Hungarians into positions of power within Poland, though he did from time to time. In fact, Poles actually had a better chance of governing in Hungary, such as Władysław of Opole who became the Palatine of Hungary in 1367-1372 and would later serve as both governor of Ruthenia and Regent of Poland. His first regent was his mother Elizabeth, who herself was Polish and Casimir III’s sister. She ruled for six years, but a conflict between her Hungarian retinue and the Kraków garrison resulted in the Hungarians massacred and Elizabeth returning to Hungary. Louis’s one long stay in Poland was during the defence of Ruthenia during the Lithuanian invasion in 1376, and the following vicious war of reprisal against the Lithuanians in 1377. Afterwards, he removed Władysław of Opole from his position as governor and made him the second regent of Poland instead. Ruthenia was put under Hungarian governors from that point on. Ruthenia had always been a point of contention, and after the Lithuanian invasion, Louis’ transfer from Polish to Hungarian governance infuriated the Poles back in Kraków so much that that was the reason they attacked the Queen’s retinue. The third regent did not last long and was soon replaced with Louis’ daughter Mary and her husband Sigismund of the house of Luxembourg. Before they could truly establish themselves properly and gain a power base, Louis died and the Poles gave the German Sigismund the boot. As the King grew older, his lack of a male heir became increasingly pressing. In order to get the Poles to agree to his daughter ascending the throne, Louis agreed to the Statute of Košice, which enlarged the rights of the Polish nobles while also granting autonomy to the provinces. The nobles in turn agreed to pay a fixed land tax, to give unpaid military aid, and to keep their castles in repair. Louis also engaged in a program of ‘restitution,’ in which he gave back land that had been seized by Casimir so as to bribe the Polish nobility into accepting his daughter. It was even worse in Hungary where women were forbidden from inheriting land, and even a male inheriting through the female line was unheard of. Louis spent the last few years of his reign trying to get an assurance from the nobles that they would have Mary as their queen and finally, before he died, they agreed. They lied of course.\n\nHungary and Poland between the Unions​\n\nThe Poles insisted, upon Louis’ death, that the King should reside in Poland. So they had Jadwiga elected as King, and chased off her Hapsburg fiancé. They had a different candidate in mind: Jogaila, Grand Duke of Lithuania. The Poles gained from Jogaila’s marriage to Jadwiga. Jogaila agreed to have himself and his men baptised, taking the Christian name Władysław II Jagiello. He also released all Polish prisoners and slaves, and agreed to coordinate efforts against the Teutonic Knights. Jogaila, as he was known in Lithuania, was never a very devout Catholic. He viewed it as “the German God,” which came from his hatred of the Teutonic Knights. However, he decided to convert because he realised that with the growing power of Poland and the Teutonic Knights, Christianity was coming one way or another to Lithuania; he decided to take it on his own terms, all the while sticking it to the Teutons. The fact that he got a nubile young princess and a whole new kingdom was only an added bonus. Jadwiga didn’t survive long, dying from complications with her first pregnancy in 1399. In 1410, Jogaila won his famous victory at Grunwald against the Teutonic Order, and in 1415 the Council of Constance gave the Polish Church the authority over converting the Lithuanians fully to Roman Catholicism, taking away the duty from the Teutonic Knights, who found themselves without a purpose any longer.\n\nHungary, on the other hand, found herself in a succession crisis. A girl inheriting the throne of Hungary flew in the face of custom, and so on the death of Louis, the Hungarian nobles instead chose to have Charles of Naples, one of Louis’s last surviving male Angevin relatives, inherit the throne instead. Charles of Naples moved in to take the throne, but Elizabeth of Bosnia (the mother of Mary and Jadwiga) had other plans. Once Charles had been fully settled into the royal castle, Elizabeth had him murdered in 1386, and seized the throne for her daughter. The enraged nobility seized Elizabeth, along with her daughter, and had her strangled in front of her child. Soon after, Mary’s husband Sigismund liberated the castle where she was being held, saving Mary’s life. A compromise between the factions was finally reached, with Sigismund being elected to the throne of Hungary, and not Mary who merely remained his Queen. In order to secure his position, Sigismund engaged in the degradation of royal authority. He agreed to share power with the nobles, while also giving away most of the Royal Domains in order to secure the throne for his election. At the end of it all, royal power in Hungary had collapsed, with Sigismund only slowly regaining it over his long reign. Mary died in a hunting accident in 1395 while pregnant, having been thrown from her horse. Without Angevin blood to secure his claim to the throne, Jogaila invaded the northern parts of Hungary to take the throne in the name of his wife, but he was beaten back and peace resumed.\n\nA year later, Sigismund went on a crusade against the Ottomans. It culminated in the Battle of Nicopolis in 1396, which ended in an unmitigated disaster for the Crusaders. The failure of the battle can mostly be placed at the ill judged and over enthusiastic charges of the French-Burgundian cavalry, despite the advice of the Hungarian King for a better strategy, and Bayezid I won the day. Sigismund able to retreat with his life, but the force was routed and many of the prisoners taken were summarily executed. Bayezid never pursued Sigismund or invaded Hungary, as he was interested in his ultimately failed siege of Constantinople. Meanwhile Sigismund was able to recover and to fortify his frontiers. The Hungarians adopted fighting methods used by the Turks, and proved more successful at fending them off when the Ottomans started attacking again in 1419. Following the failure at Nicopolis, Sigismund was frequently gone from Hungary, as he became consumed with Imperial politics and the Hussite problem, and was known for his reign in Hungary for his ruthlessness, absenteeism and neglect. With the death of the authoritarian and imposing Sigismund in 1437, royal power again collapsed under his heir, Albert of Hapsburg, Archduke of Austria. He had married Elizabeth, the only child of Sigismund, so like Sigismund before him, he took the throne through marriage. The Ottomans finally invaded the Kingdom in 1437 and Albert mustered a defence, but was hindered by the reticence of the nobles who refused to help their king. Albert died of dysentery during a siege in 1439, leaving behind a pregnant wife. With his death, the Hungarian counter attack would be delayed by a civil war until 1442.\n\nWładysław III of Poland and I of Hungary and the Crusade of Varna​\n\nBack in Poland, Jogaila finally had male heirs. His eldest son Władysław was born in 1424, and assumed power as Władysław III Jagiello in 1434 at the age of ten. The Bishop Olesnicki, possessed of a domineering personality, assumed the regency after some opposition. He and his allies used the regency to expand the rights of the nobles and promote their interests. Olesnicki led a very active foreign policy, using the division between Pope and Anti Pope to advance Poland’s influence in the Catholic world and got himself named Cardinal in order to promote Poland’s interest. The Hussites even offered the throne to Władysław III, but Olesnicki was able to turn it down in order to not entangle himself in German affairs. In 1440, Hungary asked Władysław III to become their King and marry Albrecht’s ageing pregnant widow, Elizabeth. Władysław reluctantly accepted for religious reasons of defending Hungary, and agreed to the deal. Elizabeth, who during this time gave birth to a son, did not. Elizabeth protested the election of Władysław in 1440, wishing to maintain power for herself and her infant son Ladislas, called the Posthumous since he was born after his father had died. Władysław, on his election was able to secure himself the support of the majority of the nobility. The towns and the wealthy magnates, not wishing to see the majority of the nobility grow in power, supported the baby Ladislas. In this situation, a civil war inevitably broke out and lasted for two years, from 1440 till 1442, and ended with the death of Elizabeth. Elizabeth had the support of the German emperor, and used Austrian soldiers and Czech mercenaries to wage her war against Władysław. Since he lacked monetary support from the Polish Sejm, Władysław was initially in a worse position against the wealth behind Elizabeth. Władysław was then fortunate that he had the support of one of the best generals of the age. Janos Hunyadi, an obscure Captain from Transylvania, distinguished himself in the service of Władysław when he crushed Elizabeth’s German and Hungarian supporters at the battle of Bátaszék, thus bringing much of central Hungary under Władysław’s control. Władysław rewarded Hunyadi and gave him near total control of Southern Hungary and Transylvania, as both the King and his Captain understood the danger of the Ottomans. Hunyadi, transformed the east into an area of calm and peace during the civil war, and focused solely on the Ottomans. Not soon after, the Papal Legate Cardinal Cesarini was finally able to broker a peace between the factions in 1442.\n\nAfter repeated disasters in the Balkans against the Ottomans, the Papacy and the Byzantine Emperor John VIII Palaeologus formalised a union of the churches in 1439; a crusade against the Ottomans could finally be realised. The crusade of Varna lacked foreign support; France and England had entered another stage of the Hundred Years War and the Hussites distracted Germany. Realising that the west was useless for a crusade against the Turks, Pope Eugenius IV turned to Central Eastern Europe, positive that they would recognise the Ottoman threat. Of course, by 1440 the Polish and Hungarians were fighting a war of succession so Eugenius had to act quickly to bring peace to the region. Once peace was made under the guidance the Cardinal Cesarini, a crusading army was amassed, and in 1443, the crusading army, under Władysław and Hunyadi, set out against the Turks. They won the Battle of Nisch, and some other minor victories before retiring to Buda. The Crusade had always meant to have been supported by the sea, but it was hampered by the Venetians seeking to profit from the endeavor. They consistently refused to arm the galleys of the crusading war fleet until they were paid, and without the support of the war fleet, any gains by the Crusaders would be impermanent. During the arguments with the Venetians, the Turks made a generous peace offer in 1444. Hunyadi, aware of the crusaders weaknesses, favoured it so Władysław had an emissary sent to negotiate a potential peace settlement. The Ottomans agreed to restore Serbia, free the hostage sons of the Despot of Serbia, and pull out from Wallachia. This was held to be satisfactory by everyone. During this time, the fleet was finally outfitted and set sail, and the Papacy notified Cesarini. Cesarini thus clandestinely moved against Hunyadi and the peace he supported. He had the King swear a public oath that he wouldn’t obey the treaty even if he signed it, which he did eventualy sign. Hunyadi’s protestations were over ruled when Wladislaw promised him the throne of Bulgaria once the Crusade was succesfull. With the treaty signed between the Serbians and the Turks, Władysław embarked on his crusade without any Serbian reinforcements. The Crusading fleet was initially succesfull in preventing Murad II from crossing the Helspont to Europe, but an unfortunate gale immobilised the fleet, while Murad was able to cross using barges supplied by the opportunistic Genoese. The Crusaders and the Ottomans met at Varna, and during the battle, the Crusaders nearly won. However King Wladislaw foolishly charged ahead without his personal guards into the midst of the Ottoman army, trying to attack the sultan, and was cut to pieces. His body was never recovered, and the Crusaders retreated in disorder. With his death, Hungary and Poland were never united under a single monarch again.\n\nThe Legacy of Louis the Great​\n\nThe long term effects of Louis’ reign are numerous. Without a male heir, much of Louis’ physical empire collapsed. Jadwiga was elected as King of Poland, contrary to his wishes (he wanted both thrones for Mary), and they annexed Ruthenia on the sly during Hungary’s succession issues. Mary’s marriage to Sigismund saw the initial collapse of royal authority, which Sigismund had to fight to regain at certain points in time though he never fully achieved what Louis had. All the nations that Louis had made vassals likewise took this opportunity to leave the Hungarian orbit.\n\nLouis accrued a reputation as a Crusader. His Kingdom was at the very frontier of Western Christendom, and he fought Schismatic Orthodox, Pagan Lithuanians, and Infidel Turks and Tartars. Louis’ Balkan policy was, in hindsight, a disaster for the long term interests of Hungary. He consistently failed to act against the Ottomans after over 20 years of calls of crusade against them. His lack of crusading was even more disappointing, as he was ideally placed and had the backing behind him to greatly expand his interests at southern expense. Of course, one should not judge Louis on hindsight, but the Ottomans were even then viewed with increasing alarm, and Louis underplayed the strong hand available to him at the time.\n\nLouis, prepping the thrones for his daughters, tried making woman nobles more equal in the view of the law but many considered it “contrary to natural law.” Still, by the end of his reign, female nobles held a slightly better standing in Hungarian culture. Louis, like his mother, was a religious fanatic. Near the end of his life, he spent increasing hours of meditation and secluding himself from the world. He also allowed certain religious orders to flourish, and he introduced the Paulines to Hungary. The oldest known book in Hungarian was also written during his rule; it was a translation from Latin of the life of St. Francis and had been written for nuns who couldn’t read Latin.\n\nLike in Hungary, Louis had a lasting impact on the development of Poland. Charles I’s and Louis’ agreements in 1339, 1351, and 1355 with the Polish nobles assented to the Angevin succession to the throne of Poland, but at the cost of the authority of the crown. Casimir had been centralizing and extending the authority of the King during his rule, and it was the hallmark of his reign. Louis’ concessions to the nobles, especially during his rule, were central in the formative stages of Poland’s political culture. The Council of Košice that was convened in 1374 under Louis I guaranteed the succession of his daughters. This required the change of ancient laws, and the council was initially opposed but they came to a compromise. This was a turning point in the power structure of Poland. If the king wanted to raise extra taxes, he had to appeal to the local szlachta of the provinces, thus forming the Sejmiki, the local councils. These Sejmiki then met up in bigger annual councils, called the Sejm. Louis’ concessions were probably never meant to be permanent, but were merely a play for time until he or his descendant could establish a stronger executive on the Hungarian model. The contemporary chronicles at the time complained that Louis never really upheld his promises of not instituting any new taxes without permission, of reconquering the lost lands, or installing foreigners in office. This shows that Louis never really meant his promises to be permanent, and that if he had had a son, they probably would have been revoked. His lack of a son prevented this, and can be seen as a failure on his part. Like Casimir before him, he was a strong dynast without a strong dynastic hand. His lack of reconquering lands for Poland was also rather sensible. During the his reign, and that of Casimir before him, the Teutonic Knights were at the very height of their strength. Not even Casimir thought it wise to attack them, and Louis was an experienced soldier. If the union had continued, a son of Louis probably would have exploited the weaknesses that the later Jageillons would exploit.\n\nWładysław III/I’s Legacy on Poland and Hungary​\n\nThe Polish szlachta, who after ninety decades without the throne passing from father to son, were rather leery of going back to a hereditary monarch and eventually opted to elect young Władysław, thus confirming a new tradition. Władysław III’s minority allowed the nobility to accrue powers to themselves, and haggled with Władysław’s brother Casimir for three years over his election to the Polish throne because the autocratic Casimir refused the terms they wanted; it was under Casimir that the Sejm really developed. Władysław’s reign was relatively minor compared to that of his brother Casimir, who was much more influential on the development of Poland, but Władysław’s reign, or lack thereof, laid the ground work for his brothers rule. Władysław went on to do a similiar thing in Hungary as well. Władysław’s election was extremely important for the political development in Hungary. Władysław was the son of Jogaila’s fourth wife, not Jadwiga, so he had no Angevin or Arpad blood in his veins. More importantly, it embodied an ideological turning point. A statement was made with the election that “the crowning of Kings is always dependent on the will of the Kingdom’s inhabitants in whose consent both the effectiveness and the force of the crown reside.” The power of the estates to elect and depose the monarch was finalised. It also allowed for Mathias Corvinus to eventually be elected as well. Mathias’ father, Janos Hunyadi, owed much of his early career to Władysław III of Poland.\n\nIt was Wladislaw who granted Hunyadi almost total power in Transylvania, which he would transform for him and his son as his original power base. His campaigns under Wladislaw against the Ottomans also gave him the nescessary status as a hero in order to assure his later regency over Ladislas the Posthumous after the interegnum following Wladislaw’s death. The era of Janos Hunyadi and his son Mathias Corvinus are today seen as the last ‘Golden Age’ of Hungary. On a darker note, Władysław’s disaster at Varna enabled the Ottomans to consolidate their gains in the Balkans, bringing it all under their control, and increasing their Empire in strength. By 1481, the Ottomans directly ruled an Empire roughly analogous to the Byzantine Empire of 1204, and were only growing in strength. Hungary was able to fend off the Ottomans with the successful leadership of John Hunyadi and Mathias Corvinus until 1490, but Hungary eventually fell when the full brunt of the Ottomans came to bear at the battle of Mohacs.\n\nWhy the Unions Failed​\n\nThe union between Poland and Hungary didn’t succeed for a number of reasons. Louis I, the first King to hold both kingdoms, viewed himself as first and foremost the King of Hungary, and thus promoted her interests at Poland’s expense, most explicitly in Ruthenia. Poland also had less and less to gain from a union with Hungary, as many of her traditional enemies weakened over the 15th century. Jan Hus’s followers threw Bohemia and Germany into five decades of internal strife (1419-1470) which provided a distraction to the Holy Roman Empire. With this lack of threats from Bohemia, the only real threat to Poland came from the Teutonic knights, who were even greater enemies of Lithuania than they were of Poland. Thus the Lithuanian connection was natural. The Battle of Grunwald in June 1410, which ended in a horrific defeat of the Teutonic knights at the hands of Jogaila, crippled the Knights fighting ability and proved Lithuania’s dedication to ending the threat of the Baltic Crusaders. The tartars had also collapsed during the time frame, and what had once been common cause had become competition. The Poles began to view the alliance with Hungary as one sided, especially over the issue of Ruthenia. To the Poles, their interests were being over ruled by those of Hungary. The Lithuanian option, where the Poles would be the senior partner, became attractive, and the eastern orientation within the Polish nobility, initiated by Casimir III’s renunciation of Silesia and expansion eastward, found a natural outlet in their decision to have Jadwiga marry Jogaila of Lithuania. The expansion of the Ottomans and their advance throughout the Balkans disrupted the North South trade route from the Baltic through Poland and Hungary to the Balkans, while Poland’s growing grain trade led her to further focus on the Baltic. This northern Baltic trade was further enabled by the conquest of Gdansk by Władysław III’s brother, Casimir IV. Finally, there is the major reason the personal unions failed: dynastics. After the Arpads, no dynasty could hold onto the throne of Hungary for over two straight generations. The Angevins only lasted until Louis I, who never had a son. Sigismund of Luxembourg married Louis’s daughter Mary to get the throne and Albert of Austria did the same through Sigismund’s daughter Elizabeth. Władysław I Jagiellon (III of Poland) was elected, and so was Ladislas the Posthumous of Hapsburg, son of Albert. Mathias Corvinus was likewise elected, as were Władysław II, and Louis II of the House of Jagiellon. Simply put, no one survived long enough to maintain the union until it became the custom, like it became between Poland and Lithuania.\n\nThe potential for a personal union between Hungary and Poland didn’t die with Władysław I of Hungary. The Jagiellons were again elected to the throne of Hungary in 1490 with Władysław II, the nephew of Władysław III (first of Hungary), but it did not last. His son Louis II and much of his Hungarian army meet their end at Mohacs, with Louis II drowning from falling in a bog while retreating from the battle field. The last Jagiellon King of Poland meanwhile was Sigismund August, who without a Hungarian branch of the family to succeed him, was without heirs. It was under him that the Union of Lublin was signed, joining Poland and Lithuania into a single commonwealth in 1569, and he died in 1572. Even after the Jagiellons had died out, the Hungarian connection was never truly forgotten. Stephen Bathory, one of Poland Lithuania’s greatest Kings, came from Transylvania and the Hungarian house of Bathory. It is from these ancient ties, from the alliance of Charles I and Władysław I Łokietek to the unions under Louis I and Władysław III/I and onwards, that the long lasting relationshipand friendship between Poland and Hungary was formed."
