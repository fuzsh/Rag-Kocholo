        "text": "From 1308 to 1395, Hungary was ruled by the Capetian House of Anjou. The first King of Hungary from this dynasty was Charles I, also known as Charles Robert. He married three or four times. His first confirmed wife was Maria of Bytom. Maria was the only recorded daughter of Casimir, Duke of Bytom, and his wife, Helena. She had at least five brothers. Maria’s father, Casimir, belonged to a lesser branch of the Silesian branch of Poland’s ruling Piast dynasty. The origins of her mother, Helena, are unknown, but she is sometimes thought to have been from the Rurik dynasty, which ruled over present-day Russia and Ukraine. The Rurik prince who is thought most likely to have been Helena’s father is Leo I, King of Galicia. The name Maria was rarely used in the Piast dynasty, so it is thought to have come from her mother’s side.\n\nFirst or Second Wife?\n\nMaria of Bytom was probably born between 1290 and 1294. She is believed to have married Charles of Anjou, claimant to the crown of Hungary, in 1306. This is evidenced by a charter from 1306, which mentions Queen Maria of Hungary. However, some believe this may refer to Charles’ grandmother, Maria of Hungary, Queen of Naples, who used the title of Queen of Hungary after the death of her brother, Ladislaus IV, in 1290. However, it is also argued that it is not Maria of Hungary, because she titled herself Queen of Hungary, Sicily, and Jerusalem. This makes it more likely that the Maria mentioned was a wife of Charles.\n\nThere is confusion if Maria of Bytom was Charles’ first wife and when she married him. One chronicle mentions that Charles married a daughter of Leo II, King of Galicia, in the first half of 1308. Others say this could have happened in 1305 or 1306. However, Leo II seems too young to have been the father of Maria of Galicia if she existed.\n\nAnother argument for the Galician marriage is the fact that Charles stated in a charter in 1326 that he once went to Galicia to bring his first wife back to Hungary. Yet the Illuminated Chronicle, which was written during the reign of Charles’ son, Louis, says that Maria of Bytom was indeed his first wife. There are some explanations for the conflicting reports. Some believe that there was indeed a marriage arranged between Charles and a Maria of Galicia, but she died before it could happen, or that the contract was broken off. Another belief is that Maria of Bytom was a granddaughter of Leo I of Galicia through her mother, Helena.\n\nQueen of Hungary\n\nWhat we do know for certain is that by 1311, Charles had married Maria of Bytom. Around 1305, Casimir of Bytom obtained 140 pieces of silver, and this was probably used to pay the wedding expenses. This makes the 1306 date more likely. The wedding probably took place in Maria’s hometown of Bytom. Soon after the wedding, Maria would have headed to Hungary with her new husband and been crowned Queen at the coronation Basilica of Szekesfehervar.\n\nThe reasons for this marriage are uncertain. If the Galician marriage happened, it would have probably been more beneficial for Charles’ international standing. It is important to mention that Maria and Viola of Teschen, Queen of Bohemia, were first cousins through their fathers. Wenceslaus III of Bohemia married Viola in 1305. From 1301 to 1305, Charles and Wenceslaus were rival claimants to the crown of Hungary, so possibly the marriage of Maria and Charles was a response to the Bohemian marriage. Maria and Viola were about the same age. The exact reasons for the marriage of Wenceslaus and Viola are uncertain too. Just like Viola, Maria was described as being very beautiful. Sometimes Wenceslaus is thought to have chosen Viola because of her beauty, so maybe this could be why Charles chose Maria. However, it seems unlikely that Maria and Viola were chosen for their beauty alone, and these marriages probably offered political benefits. The marriage of Maria was probably for a Hungarian-Polish agreement directed against Bohemia.\n\nFrom 1301 to 1305, Charles was fighting for the crown of Hungary against Wenceslaus III of Bohemia, and then from 1305 to 1308, he was up against Otto III of Bavaria. In November 1308, he was finally proclaimed King of Hungary and would have two coronations, first in 1309 and then in 1310. It is not certain if Maria was crowned alongside him at the first coronation, but she is known to have been crowned with her husband at the second.\n\nMaria did not play a big role in the Hungarian court. Not much is known of her life as queen. There are two documents issued by Maria between 1312 and 1313. There is also a letter from her to Charles, asking for permission to donate land to a youth in her service. Maria had her own seal as queen. In 1315 Maria invited two of her brothers, Boleslaw and Mieszko to the Hungarian court. Both brothers would have prominent church careers in Hungary and would go on to be bishops.\n\nMaria most likely had no children. However, some later sources say that she and Charles had two daughters who married into Maria’s Silesian Piast family; Catherine, who married Henry II, Duke of Swidnica, and became the mother of Anna of Swidnica, Holy Roman Empress, and Elizabeth, who married Boleslaw II of Niemodlin. This is most likely false, for contemporary sources say that Maria had no children. Some think that Charles’ third wife, Elizabeth of Poland, was their mother instead, but that’s also unlikely. Contemporary sources mention five sons but no daughters for Elizabeth. Also, Catherine and her husband, Henry, would have been first cousins if Elizabeth were her mother. It’s possible that Catherine and Elizabeth were illegitimate daughters of Charles, or they could not have been his daughters at all. While Catherine certainly existed, the existence of Elizabeth is less certain. Her alleged husband, Boleslaw, is said to have never married.\n\nMaria died on 15 December 1317, in Timisoara, where the Hungarian court was based at the time. She would have been in her twenties, and the cause of her death is unknown. Interestingly, her cousin, Viola of Teschen, whose life was parallel to hers, died a few months earlier. Maria was buried in Szekesfehervar Basilica, the burial place of many previous kings and queens of Hungary. Charles married twice more, firstly to Beatrice of Luxembourg, and then to Elizabeth of Poland, who gave him his long-awaited heirs.\n\nSources:\n\nBlazkova, Tereza; “Viola of Teschen and her period”\n\nDavies, Stephen Rhys; “Marriage and the Politics of Friendship: The family of Charles II of Anjou, King of Naples (1285-1309)”\n\nMielke, Christopher; “Every hyacinth the garden wears: the material culture of medieval queens of Hungary (1000-1395)”\n\nMielke, Christopher; The Archaeology and Material Culture of Queenship in Medieval Hungary, 1000-1395\n\nI originally wrote this article for Historyofroyalwomen.com\n\nMaria Mstislavna was not only a Rus princess by birth, but she also got to be Grand Princess of Kyiv by marriage. She was born into one branch of the Rurikid dynasty and married into another.\n\nMaria might have been the fifth daughter of Mstislav I, Grand Prince of Kyiv, and his first wife, Christina Ingesdotter of Sweden. Maria’s first name is only mentioned in later sources, and some sources call her Agatha instead. I’ll refer to her as Maria in this post. Maria was perhaps born between 1110 and 1113. She was probably born in Novgorod, where her father was ruling as Prince at the time. Mstislav became Grand Prince of Kyiv when his father died in 1125. Maria had three older sisters who married foreign princes: Malmfred in Norway and Denmark, Ingeborg in Denmark, and Dobrodeia in the Byzantine Empire.\n\nMarriage\n\nIn the early 12th century, the Rurikid dynasty which ruled Rus was split into several branches. The two most prominent of these were the Monomakhovichi, descended from Vsevolod, the fourth son of Yaroslav the Wise and Ingegerd of Sweden, and the Olgovichi, descended from Yaroslav and Ingegerd’s third son, Svyatoslav. Conflict soon arose between these two branches, but marriage was seen as a way for them to keep peace.\n\nMstislav, from the Monomakhovichi branch, had long been in conflict with Vsevolod Olgovich from the Olgovichi branch. Therefore, the marriage between Maria and Vsevolod was probably arranged to make peace. The date of the marriage is not known, but it was probably during the 1120s, most likely in 1126-1127. Maria and Vsevolod had several children together:\n\nSvyatoslav III (c.1123/28-1194) Prince of Turov, Volhynia, Novgorod-Seversk, and Chernegov, Grand Prince of Kyiv.\n\nZvenislava (c.1126/27-1155/60) Married Boleslaw I, Duke of Wroclaw, Polish prince.\n\nAnna, married Ivan Vasilkovich, Prince of Galicia (not mentioned in all sources.)\n\nYaroslav (c.1139-1198) Prince of Ropesk, Starodub, and Chernigov.\n\nOn the death of Maria’s father, Mstislav, in 1132, his brother, Yaropolk became Grand Prince of Kyiv. When Yaropolk died in 1139, another brother, Viacheslav became the new Grand Prince, but he was soon driven out by Maria’s husband, Vsevolod. In March 1139, Maria’s husband became Grand Prince Vsevolod II of Kyiv. His marriage to Maria is believed to have gotten him into this position.\n\nMaria was loyal to both her husband and her birth family. She would often negotiate between her husband with her brothers and uncles. When Vsevolod first became Grand Prince, he wanted to take away the lands of Maria’s brothers and uncles, but decided not to. It was likely Maria who persuaded him not to. In 1141, Maria’s brother, Izyaslav, asked her and their stepmother, Liubava Dmitrievna Zavidich, if they could ask Vsevolod to make their brother, Svyatopolk, Prince of Novgorod. Maria carried out his request, and Svyatopolk became Prince of Novgorod. During conflicts between the Monomakhovichi and the Olgovichi, Vsevolod would take the side of the Monomakhavichi- Maria’s family, rather than his own family.\n\nWidowhood\n\nVsevolod died in 1146, and despite his closeness to Maria’s brothers, he left the throne of Kyiv to his brother, Igor, instead. Igor was not popular in Kyiv, and was eventually driven out and killed. Maria’s brother, Izyaslav became the new Grand Prince. It is possible that Maria herself helped him become Grand Prince. Maria seems to have supported Izyaslav against their uncle, Yuri Dolgorukiy, who was also vying to be Grand Prince.\n\nMaria was one of the founders of St. Cyril’s Monastery in Kyiv.The construction of the church began in 1139, when Vsevolod became Grand Prince of Kyiv. At some point during her widowhood, Maria became a nun. She died in 1179 or 1181, and was buried in St. Cyril’s Monastery.\n\nMaria seems to have supported her husband, while still remaining loyal to her brothers. She is remembered as an important mediator between the two main branches of the Rurikid dynasty. Maria and Vsevolod’s marriage is seen as a binding of the two most powerful families in Rus.\n\nSources\n\nEvgenievna, Morozova Lyudmila; Great and Unknown Women of Ancient Russia\n\nRaffensperger, Christian and Ostrowski, Donald; The Ruling Families of Rus: Clan, Family and Kingdom\n\nRaffensperger, Christian; Ties of Kinship: Genealogy and Dynastic Marriage in Kyivan Rus’\n\n“Maria/Agafya Mstislavna” on the website The Court of Russian Princesses of the XI-XVI centuries\n\nOne of the dynasties the Rurikid dynasty intermarried the most with was the Arpads of Hungary. The marriage of Euphrosyne of Kyiv with King Geza II of Hungary seems to be one of the most successful of these unions.\n\nEarly Life\n\nEuphrosyne was the only known daughter of Mstislav I, Grand Prince of Kyiv, by his second wife, Liubava Dmitrievna Zavidich. She was probably born around 1130, the same year her future husband was born. Euphrosyne had two full brothers, Vladimir and Yaropolk. By her father’s first marriage to Christina Ingesdotter of Sweden, she had many half siblings, including Malmfred, Ingeborg, and Dobrodeia, who all married foreign princes before she was born. Euphrosyne’s father died in 1132, and she seems to have been raised by her mother.\n\nQueen of Hungary\n\nMost likely in 1146, Euphrosyne married Geza II, King of Hungary. They were both about sixteen at the time. The marriage was possibly arranged as an alliance against the Byzantine Empire. At this time, Hungary was expanding south into Croatia and Dalmatia, resulting in military conflicts with the Byzantine. Therefore, Hungary was looking for allies among their Slavic neighbors. Geza’s mother, Helena of Serbia, was also a daughter of a Slavic-Orthodox prince. At the beginning of her marriage, it is possible that Euphrosyne could have looked up to her mother-in-law. Helena was regent for Geza during his minority, and even during her husband’s lifetime, she was a powerful queen consort. Just like Euphrosyne, Helena was raised Orthodox and married a Catholic. There is evidence to suggest that Euphrosyne remained Orthodox after her marriage.\n\nAnother reason for this marriage could be the fact that Geza was in conflict with his cousin, Boris, at the time. Boris was the son of Euphrosyne’s aunt, Euphemia. Euphemia had been married to Coloman, who was king of Hungary from 1096 to 1116. When she was pregnant with Boris, Euphemia was accused of adultery and sent back to Kyiv. Due to this, Coloman did not consider Boris to be his son. Boris, however, considered himself Coloman’s son. When Stephen II of Hungary, Coloman’s son from his first marriage, died childless in 1131, he was succeeded by Geza’s father, Bela II. Boris tried to seize the throne from Bela with the help of the Byzantine Emperor, but failed. In 1145, he tried again, this time trying to take the throne from Geza. Boris being allied to the Byzantine Emperor, could be another reason why Geza was seeking an alliance against the Empire. Also, by marrying Euphrosyne, Geza could keep the alliance with Kyivan Rus in place.\n\nIn the summer of 1147, Euphrosyne gave birth to her first child, a son named Stephen. King Louis VII of France was passing through Hungary at the time, on the way to the Second Crusade, and stood in as Stephen’s godfather. Louis’s wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine was accompanying him on the journey. It is possible that Euphrosyne and Eleanor could have met, but no sources mention this.\n\nEuphrosyne kept in touch with her siblings after her marriage. In 1148 or 1149, Euphrosyne’s older half-brother, Iziaslav II, lost the throne of Kyiv to their uncle, Yuri. Iziaslav looked for support among his western neighbors, including Geza. Geza’s armies ended up fighting a total of six times in Rus from 1148 to 1152. In 1150, a marriage was arranged between Euphrosyne’s full-brother, Vladimir, and a first cousin of Geza. Euphrosyne took part in arranging this marriage, and the Kyivan Chronicle mentions at the wedding she feasted with her brothers and gave them gifts. In 1155, Euphrosyne’s mother visited her in Hungary.\n\nEuphrosyne had a close connection to the Hospitaller order. In 1157, after the death of Archbishop Martirius of Esztergom, she completed the construction of the Hospitaller convent at Székesfehérvár, which he started. She also donated many properties to the foundation.\n\nEuphrosyne and Geza had eight children together:\n\nStephen III (1147-1172), King of Hungary from 1162 to 1172.\n\nBela III (c.1148-1196) King of Hungary from 1172 to 1196.\n\nElizabeth (c.1149-after 1189) Married Frederick, Duke of Bohemia.\n\nGeza (c.1151-c.1210) Pretender to the Hungarian throne.\n\nOdola, married Sviatopluk, Bohemian prince.\n\nArpad, died in childhood.\n\nHelena (c.1158-1199) Married Leopold V, Duke of Austria\n\nMargaret (1162-1208) Married firstly, Isaac Dukas and secondly, Andrew, Ban of Slavonia. Possibly married thirdly, Mercurius, Ban of Slavonia.\n\nGeza died on 31 May 1162. Euphrosyne probably gave birth to her final child, Margaret, around this time. During her widowhood, Euphrosyne would become a very powerful queen mother of Hungary, just like another Rus princess, Anastasia did a century before.\n\nRegency and Reign of Stephen III\n\nSince Euphrosyne’s eldest son Stephen, was barely fifteen when his father died, she stepped in to rule as regent. However, his accession was challenged by his two uncles, Ladislaus and Stephen. Ladislaus was the first to claim the crown, and was crowned as King of Hungary in July 1162. Ladislaus was supported by the Byzantine Emperor, Manuel Komnenos. Soon afterwards, Stephen, possibly along with Euphrosyne and her other children, fled to Austria and then to Bratislava. Euphrosyne soon found support from the Bohemian King, Vladislaus II, and the Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick I. As a result of the alliance with Bohemia, Euphrosyne’s eldest daughters, Elizabeth and Odola were married to Vladislaus’s two eldest sons, Frederick and Svatopluk, respectively.\n\nLadislaus’s reign did not last for long, as he died in January 1163. His brother, Stephen, then had himself crowned as King of Hungary as Stephen IV. Euphrosyne and Stephen III raised an army, and Stephen IV was defeated in battle on 19 June 1163. After this, Stephen III was back on the throne. Euphrosyne continued to rule with him, and was involved in church affairs.\n\nThat same year, Euphrosyne took part in a peace treaty with Byzantine Emperor Manuel Komnenos. On the advice of Euphrosyne and the Archbishop of Esztergom, her second son, Bela, was sent to Constantinople. Since Manuel had no sons at the time, Bela was betrothed to his daughter, Maria, and named as his heir. Bela was baptized in the Orthodox church as Alexios, and was given the title of despot.\n\nThe uneasy relationship with the Byzantine continued, and in 1164, Manuel and Bela attacked forces loyal to Stephen. There was much territory that was disputed between the two countries, such as the Dalmation Coast. In 1164, Stephen was betrothed to a daughter of the Rus prince, Yaroslav Osmomysl of Halych. This betrothal was possibly arranged by Euphrosyne herself. However, the betrothal was annulled in 1166, possibly due to pressure from Emperor Manuel. Soon, Stephen was betrothed to Agnes of Austria, daughter of Henry II, Duke of Austria, who was a close ally of Stephen. The Hungarian-Byzantine war ended in 1167, with the Byzantine gaining control of the Dalmation coast and Bosnia. In 1168, Stephen and Agnes were married.\n\nIn 1169, Euphrosyne appears first in a list of lay advisors of the king promoting papal reforms in Hungary. Euphrosyne was also a staunch supporter of the military order, the Hospitallers. She participated in the founding of the first Hospitallers convent in Hungary. Under Euphrosyne, the convent building was finished, and she donated fifty-five of her properties to this foundation.\n\nReign of Bela III\n\nStephen died on 4 March 1172. According to a later chronicle, he was poisoned on the orders of his younger brother, Bela, but this is unconfirmed. Stephen left behind no surviving children, so Bela was next in line for the throne. The nobles of Hungary invited Bela to take the throne.\n\nBela was no longer needed as Emperor Manuel’s heir. In 1169, a son was born to Manuel, and the emperor married Bela off to his sister-in-law instead of his daughter. Bela arrived back in Hungary in late April or early May of that year, but due to a conflict with the Archbishop of Esztergom, he was not crowned until January 1173. Euphrosyne was not in favor of Bela’s accession, and instead preferred her younger son, Geza. The reason for this could be that Bela had spent years at the Byzantine court, and may have preferred a Byzantine approach to ruling his kingdom, rather than a Hungarian one.\n\nSince Euphrosyne preferred Geza, she eventually fell out with Bela. Soon after Bela’s coronation, he arrested Geza. Geza soon escaped, possibly with Euphrosyne’s help, but he was arrested again in 1177. Euphrosyne might have been imprisoned with Geza around this time. By 1186, Euphrosyne was reported to be imprisoned in Branicevo (today in Serbia).\n\nLater Life\n\nBela would eventually exile Euphrosyne. This might have happened as late as 1186. Geza was released between 1186 and 1189. In her exile, Euphrosyne is believed to have traveled to Constantinople, and then on to Jerusalem. At the Hospital of Saint John in Jerusalem, Euphrosyne became a Hospitaller nun.\n\nIt is not entirely clear what became of Euphrosyne after this. She is sometimes thought to have died this year, but she is also said to have lived until 1193. Either way, she probably did not remain in Jerusalem for long. In 1187, Jerusalem was captured by Saladin, and all crusading orders left the city. For a while, it seems that many thought that Euphrosyne died near Jerusalem, and was buried in the church of St. Theodosius in Jerusalem, and her remains were later transferred back to Hungary. However, it is now believed that her death and burial in Jerusalem has been confused with another Rus princess, St. Euphrosyne of Polotsk, who died in Jerusalem. According to a 1272 document, Euphrosyne was buried at the Hospitaller convent at Székesfehérvár, which she founded.\n\nIn conclusion, Euphrosyne’s life seems to have been quite an adventurous one. A Rus princess married in Hungary, she fiercely defended the rights of her older son when her husband died. After her first son died, she was involved in a conflict with her younger son, and was exiled due to it. Euphrosyne is notable for having been the last Rus princess to rule as Queen of Hungary, and the last Rus princess to rule over a Latin Christian kingdom.\n\nSources\n\nFont, Marta; “The princess of Kievan Rus in Hungarian History” on hromada.hu\n\nMielke, Christopher; “Every hiacinth the garden wears: the material culture of medieval queens of Hungary (1000-1395)”\n\nMielke, Christopher; “No Country for Old Women: Burial Practices and Patterns of Hungarian Queens of the Arpad Dynasty (975-1301)”\n\nMielke, Christopher; The Archaeology and Material Culture of Queenship in Medieval Hungary, 1000-1395\n\nRaffensperger, Christian; Ties of Kinship: Genealogy and Dynastic Marriage in Kyivan Rus’\n\nVoloshchuk, Myroslav; “Ruthenian-Hungarian Matrimonial Connections in the Context of the Rurik Inter-dynasty Policy of the 10th-14th centuries: Selected Statistical Data”\n\nZajac, Natalia Anna Makaryk; “Women Between West and East: the Inter-Rite Marriages of the Kyivan Rus’ Dynasty, ca. 1000-1204”\n\n“Euphrosyne Mstislavna” on the website The Court of Russian Princesses of the XI-XVI centuries\n\nEven though the historical record is scarce, it is known that in the early twelfth century a Byzantine Emperor married a Kievan Rus princess. Later legends say that the Rus princess was named Dobrodeia and that she wrote a medical book.\n\nLife\n\nThe name of this princess is not known. Later sources give her a variety of names: Dobrodeia, Eupraxia, Irene, and Zoe. It is often believed that Eupraxia was her name at birth, and when she married she was renamed Irene or Zoe. Apparently, Dobrodeia is a nickname which means something along the lines of “goodness” or “kindness”, and she got it through her love of caring for the sick.\n\nDobrodeia was probably born sometime in the 1100s decade, perhaps around the later years of the decade, i.e. between 1106 and 1109. She was possibly the fourth daughter of Mstislav I, Grand Prince of Kyiv, and his first wife, Christina Ingedotter of Sweden. Two of her older sisters, Malmfred and Ingeborg married into Scandinavian royalty. Another daughter married the Rus Prince, Yaroslav Sviatopolkovich around 1112, but was repudiated in 1118 or 1119. This could possibly be the same person as Dobrodeia, but there is no evidence.\n\nThe only reference to “Dobrodeia” in the chronicles is when the Hypatian Chronicle reports that in 1122, a daughter of Mstislav was sent to Constantinople to marry the Emperor. The emperor at the time was John II Komnenos, but it is well-documented that his wife was Irene-Piroska of Hungary. The husband of Dobrodeia is usually thought to be John’s oldest son, Alexios, who was the co-emperor. There are some suggestions that Dobrodeia’s husband might have been one of John’s younger sons, but Alexios is usually considered the one most likely to have been married to Dobrodeia. Apparently Alexios married twice, and based on the chronology, Dobrodeia would have been his first wife.\n\nDobrodeia is not mentioned with any certainty in Byzantine sources. If Dobrodeia was married to Alexios, she might have been the mother of his daughter, Maria, who was born around 1125-1129. Maria later married the Byzantine nobleman, Alexios Axouch.\n\nSince Alexios would marry again, Dobrodeia is thought to have not lived for long. Most modern sources give her death date as 16 November 1131. Alexios would marry again around 1136, this time possibly to Kata of Georgia. Alexios did not live to be senior emperor; he predeceased his father in 1142.\n\nThe Alimma\n\nDobrodeia is believed by some to have been the author of a medical book known as the Alimma, however this authorship is denied by most scholars today. The word alimma means ointments in Greek. Apparently the full title is Ointments of Lady Zoe the Queen. The Queen Zoe in question could refer to Dobrodeia, but some believe it refers to an earlier empress, Zoe Porphyrogenita, who was Byzantine Empress in her own right from 1028 to 1050. Some believe that the book was instead written by an unknown doctor. Fragments of a 14th century copy of this manuscript survive to this day in the Medici Library in Florence.\n\nSources\n\nRaffensperger, Christian; Ties of Kinship: Genealogy and Dynastic Marriage in Kyivan Rus’\n\nRussian and Ukrainian Wikipedias\n\nIn the early twelfth century, the Kievan Rus and Scandinavia continued to make marriage alliances to keep them connected. This included the marriages of the two oldest daughters of Mstislav I of Kyiv and his wife, Christina of Sweden. Around 1111, their daughter, Mamlfred, who was possibly their oldest, married Sigurd I of Norway. Not long afterwards, their next daughter, Ingeborg, married Canute Lavard, who had a strong claim to the Danish throne.\n\nEarly Life\n\nIt is not known when Ingeborg was born. She seems to have been one of the older children of Mstislav I, Grand Prince of Kyiv, and his first wife, Christina Ingesdotter of Sweden. Her parents married between 1090 and 1096, and Ingeborg married around 1115-1117, so she is thought to have been born around 1097-1102. She was possibly the second daughter of Mstislav and Christina, their first being Malmfred. Like her sister, Ingeborg is not mentioned in Rus sources, and what we know about her comes from Scandinavian and Latin sources.\n\nIt is debated if Ingeborg was her name at birth. Ingeborg is a Scandinavian name, and some believe that her birth name could have been a Slavic or Greek name instead, as most Rus princesses had such names, and that she was renamed Ingeborg upon her marriage. However, with Ingeborg’s mother being Scandinavian herself, it is entirely possible that Ingeborg could have been her birth name. It is also possible that she had multiple names. At this time, Rus princes were known to have multiple names- a Slavic name, a Greek Christian name, and sometimes a Scandinavian name. For example, her father had Mstislav as his Slavic name, Theodore as his baptismal Greek name, and Harold as his Scandinavian name.\n\nDuchess of Schleswig\n\nProbably between 1115 and 1117, Ingeborg married Canute Lavard, Duke of Schleswig. Canute was the only legitimate child of King Eric I of Denmark and Boedil Thurgotsdatter. When Canute was seven years old, both of his parents died when they went on Crusade. At the time, Denmark usually followed lateral succession, (from brother to brother), rather than direct father to son succession. Also, a king’s illegitimate sons had as much a right to the throne as legitimate ones. Canute’s grandfather, King Sweyn II of Denmark had no surviving legitimate sons, but many illegitimate ones. Five of them would successively become Kings of Denmark. Canute’s father was the fourth of these five sons to be king. Since he was still a child when his father died, Canute was bypassed in favor of his last surviving uncle, Niels, when a new king was elected in 1104.\n\nIn 1115, Canute was made Duke of Schleswig by either Niels, or Lothar, Duke of Saxony. Ingeborg and Canute were probably married around this time. It is thought that they married before 1117, when Ingeborg’s father, Mstislav moved from Novgorod to Belgorod. There are several different versions on how this marriage came about.\n\nThe first theory involves Ingeborg’s grandfather, Vladimir Monomakh, Grand Prince of Kyiv, and Lothar, Duke of Saxony. When Vladimir came to the throne of Kyiv, he was in conflict with his cousin, Yaropolk, who was allied with the Polish. Lothar was a major opponent of the Poles, and he was allied with Canute. This marriage could be seen as an alliance against Yaropolk and the Poles.\n\nA later twelfth-century Danish chronicler, Saxo Grammaticus, gives another explanation. According to Saxo Grammaticus, Margaret, the aunt of Ingeborg via her mother’s side, arranged this marriage. Margaret was first married to King Magnus III of Norway, but at the time of Ingeborg’s marriage, she was married to Canute’s uncle, King Niels of Denmark. In this case, this marriage was made to draw the families closer. By this time, Ingeborg’s sister, Malmfred would have been married to Magnus’s son and Margaret’s stepson, King Sigurd of Norway. Whether or not Margaret arranged the marriage, she deeded some of her lands in Sweden to Ingeborg.\n\nA third version is given in the thirteenth-century Knytlinga Saga. According to the Saga, Canute knew about Ingeborg, and sent a Baltic trader named Vidgaut to Mstislav’s court to negotiate a marriage agreement. Vidgaut is described as a recent convert to Christianity, who knew many languages, and did not need a translator at the Rus court. Vidgaut was successfully able to get Mstislav and Ingeborg to agree to the marriage to Canute. Vidgaut then returned to Denmark, and told Canute the good news, and wedding preparations were made. Ingeborg then departed from Denmark with “a splendid retinue”, and the wedding was a grand affair.\n\nIn 1127, Canute became ruler of the Abdorites, after the death of the previous ruler, his cousin, Henrik Gottskalksen. The Abdorites were a group of Slavic people on the Baltic coast. For his possessions, Canute paid homage to Lothar, Duke of Saxony, and eventually Holy Roman Emperor, rather than King Niels of Denmark. In 1129, Lothar titled Canute as “King of the Adborites.”\n\nCanute and Ingeborg had four children together:\n\nChristina (c. 1118-after 1141) Married King Magnus IV of Norway\n\nMargaret, married Danish nobleman, Stig Hvitaledr\n\nCatherine, married Pribislav-Henry of the Adborities\n\nValdemar I (1131-1182), King of Denmark\n\nInterestingly, Ingeborg’s three daughters all shared the names of Ingeborg’s mother and her two sisters. It seems like the names were the same for the birth order of both of these generations, from youngest to oldest, the sisters’ names were Christina, Margaret and Catherine.\n\nCanute’s loyalty to Lothar suggests a difficult relationship between him and his uncle. Niels would have seen Canute’s increasing power as a threat to him. Niels also had a son, Magnus, whom he saw as his heir. It is believed that eventually Niels and Magnus saw Canute as a threat to their power.\n\nAccording to the twelfth century Chronicle of the Slavs, Ingeborg had a premonition of her husband’s murder in a dream. Due to this, she tried to warn Canute against meeting with his cousin Magnus, but he ignored her advice. Canute went to meet Magnus on 7 January 1131, but was trapped and killed. About a week after Canute’s death, Ingeborg gave birth to their only son, Valdemar, named after Ingeborg’s grandfather, Vladimir Monomakh, Grand Prince of Kyiv.\n\nThere are two different accounts of the place of Valdemar’s birth. The Chronicle of the Slavs suggests that Ingeborg was in Denmark at the time. However, the Knytlinga Saga says that Ingeborg was in Rus visiting her father at the time of Canute’s murder and Valdemar’s birth. If true, Ingeborg probably would not have found out about her husband’s death until after her son’s birth. If Ingeborg was in Rus, this would be an example of a Rus princess maintaining close ties to her birth family after her marriage.\n\nWidowhood\n\nIngeborg’s sister, Malmfred, Queen of Norway, had been widowed less than a year before her. In widowhood, the two sister’s paths crossed again, and they played an important role in the marital ties of the royal families of Denmark and Norway. Canute’s illegitimate half-brother, Eric, looked after Ingeborg and her children, and wished to avenge his brother’s death. Eric allied with the reigning King of Norway, Magnus, who was the stepson of Malmfred. A double marriage was arranged to seal this alliance, Magnus would marry Ingeborg’s daughter, Christina, and Malmfred would marry Eric.\n\nIn 1132, Eric went to battle against Niels and Magnus of Denmark, but was defeated. He fled to Norway with Malmfred, to the court of Magnus of Norway. Ingeborg’s whereabouts at this time are not known, she and her younger children may have fled to Norway too, or they may have been in Rus. When Niels found out that Magnus was sheltering Eric and Malmfred, he asked him to turn them over to him. Ingeborg’s daughter, Christina, who was by this time married to Magnus, found out about this, and helped Eric and Malmfred escape. When Magnus found out about Christina’s involvement in this, he repudiated her.\n\nOn 4 June 1134, Niels and Magnus of Denmark were defeated in the Battle of Fotevik by Eric. Magnus was killed in the battle, and Niels fled, and was murdered three weeks later. Eric’s vengeance for Canute’s death was now complete, and he became the new King of Denmark. However, his reign was not to last long. Eric proved to be an unpopular king, and was murdered at an assembly on 18 September 1137.\n\nSoon after this event, Ingeborg resurfaces. Her six-year-old son, Valdemar was chosen to become the new king, but Ingeborg refused because of his age. According to Saxo Grammaticus, she feared for Valdemar’s life, so she forced the nobles to swear to not choose him as king. Instead, his cousin, Eric III became the new King of Denmark. However, Valdemar was still considered to be a future king. This is the last time that Ingeborg is mentioned. She may have remained in Denmark to watch over her son, or she might have returned to Rus. The date and place of her death is not known.\n\nValdemar eventually did become King of Denmark in 1154. He continued to maintain ties to his mother’s family, he married a Rus princess himself. In 1170, Valdemar started the canonization process for his father, whose murder was considered a martyrdom. Canute would eventually be canonized as a saint. Valdemar’s other accomplishments included initiating primogeniture in Denmark. From then on, Danish kings followed primogeniture instead of lateral succession. Valdemar was a very successful ruler, and is remembered by history as “The Great”.\n\nThrough their marriages, Ingeborg and her sister, Malmfred appear to have created strong family ties, which defined early twelfth-century Scandinavia.\n\nSources\n\nRaffensperger, Christian; “Dynastic Marriage in Action: How Two Rusian Princesses Changed Scandinavia”\n\nRaffensperger, Christian and Ostrowski, Donald; The Ruling Families of Rus: Clan, Family and Kingdom\n\nZajac, Natalia Anna Makaryk; “Women Between West and East: the Inter-Rite Marriages of the Kyivan Rus’ Dynasty, ca. 1000-1204”\n\n“Ingeborg of Kiev” on the website The Court of Russian Princesses of the XI-XVI centuries\n\nIn the early twelfth century, Kievan Rus continued its ties to Scandinavia. This included the marriages of the two oldest daughters of Mstislav I of Kyiv and his wife, Christina of Sweden. One of the daughters- Malmfred got to become a queen twice- first of Norway and secondly of Denmark.\n\nEarly Life\n\nVery little is known about Malmfred’s life before her marriage. In fact, she is not mentioned in any Rus chronicles, and is known through Scandinavian and Latin sources. This is the case with many Rus princesses who married abroad. She was one of the older daughters- possibly the oldest daughter- of Mstislav I, Grand Prince of Kyiv, and his first wife, Christina Ingesdotter of Sweden. We do not know when she was born. Her parents married sometime between 1090 and 1096. Estimates of when Malmfred could have been born vary between 1095 and 1102.\n\nIt is debated if Malmfred was her name at birth. The name is also spelt as Malfred, Malfrid, Malmfrid, Malmfrida or Malmfreda. Malmfred is a Scandinavian name, and some believe that her birth name could have been a Slavic or Greek name instead, as most Rus princesses had such names, and that she was renamed Malmfred upon her marriage. However, with Malmfred’s mother being Scandinavian herself, it is entirely possible that Malmfred could have been her birth name. It is also possible that she had multiple names. At this time, Rus princes were known to have multiple names- a Slavic name, a Greek Christian name, and sometimes a Scandinavian name. For example, her father had Mstislav as his Slavic name, Theodore as his baptismal Greek name, and Harold as his Scandinavian name.\n\nQueen of Norway\n\nMalmfred’s marriage is believed to have occurred between 1111 and 1116, possibly closer to the earlier date. She was married to Sigurd I, “the Crusader”, King of Norway. It is not known how this marriage exactly came about. The marriage could have been arranged to keep Rus-Scandinavian ties. Malmfred’s mother was a daughter of a king of Sweden, and ties to the Swedish royal family would have been desirable to a Norwegian king. Sigurd’s father, King Magnus III of Norway had been married to Malmfred’s aunt on her mother’s side, Margaret. However, the marriage was childless, and Sigurd and his siblings were born to concubines. Margaret, who was by this time married to the King of Denmark, might have had a hand in arranging Malmfred’s marriage. When Malmfred married, she might have received a piece of her aunt’s inheritance, perhaps as a dowry.\n\nThis was the second marriage between a Rus princess and a Norwegian king- in the 1040s, Harald Hardrada married Elisaveta of Kyiv. Interestingly, Elisaveta’s mother, Ingegerd, was a Swedish princess, just like Malmfred’s mother, Christina.\n\nMalmfred was Sigurd’s second wife. In 1102, while in his early teens, Sigurd was married to Blathemuine, daughter of the King of Munster, in Ireland. When Sigurd’s father was killed in 1103, Sigurd returned to Norway to claim the crown with his brothers, and left Blathemuine behind. Sigurd left on crusade in 1107 and returned in 1111. It is believed that he may have met Malmfred on his way home. His exact route back to Norway is uncertain, but he may have passed through Rus, and met Malmfred there. Sigurd was not the only King of Norway at that time. He shared the throne with his two brothers, Eysteinn and Olav. Olav died in 1115, and Eysteinn in 1123, leaving Sigurd as sole King of Norway.\n\nThe marriage of Sigurd and Malmfred is not considered to have been happy. Sigurd had an illegitimate son, Magnus, who seems to have been born during the marriage. Malmfred and Sigurd had just one daughter, named Christina, who was perhaps born around 1125. Sometime between 1126 and 1128, Sigurd was believed to have taken a lover named Cecilia, who was the daughter of a local magnate. Sigurd demanded to marry her, but was in conflict with the local bishop. Malmfred’s involvement is not mentioned in this episode, but she appears to have remained married to Sigurd, even though he was believed to have broken church rules and married Cecilia anyway. According to some, Sigurd divorced Malmfred, but she remained in Norway. Others believed he remained married to Malmfred, but still married Cecilia. At this time, it was not uncommon for Scandinavian kings to be married bigamously. In anycase, it seems like Malmfred continued to be acknowledged as Queen of Norway, while Cecilia was not. About eighty years earlier, Harald Hardrada, the husband of the earlier Rus princess, Elisaveta, bigamously married Tora, a daughter of a powerful Norwegian noble. There is some debate if the story of the marriage of Sigurd and Cecilia is true.\n\nSigurd died in 1130. He was succeeded by his son, Magnus, and Harald Gille, who claimed to be a half-brother of Sigurd. At first, Malmfred would remain at the Norwegian court, as Magnus’s step-mother, but fate would have her marry again.\n\nMarriage to Eric of Denmark\n\nAround 1117, Malmfred’s sister, Ingeborg married Canute Lavard, who had a strong claim to the Danish throne. However, they never got to become King and Queen of Denmark, for Canute was murdered in 1131. After this event, the two sisters seemed to have worked closely together. Canute’s half-brother, Eric, rebelled against the reigning King of Denmark, his uncle, Niels, who had played a part in Canute’s murder. Niels was the second husband of Malmfred’s aunt, Margaret, who died around 1130.\n\nEric made a claim to the Danish throne. He allied with Malmfred’s stepson, Magnus, now King of Norway. This alliance was to be sealed by a double marriage. By marrying the sister of his brother’s wife, Eric could get support in his struggle for the throne. Between 1131 and 1133, Malmfred and Eric married. Another marriage was arranged between Ingeborg and Canute’s daughter, Christina, and Malmfred’s stepson, Magnus. Malmfred may have had a hand in arranging this marriage herself. This double marriage was a way of tying the families together to protect Ingeborg and her children and to avenge Canute’s death.\n\nMalmfred and Eric had no children together, but Eric had an illegitimate son named Sweyn, who was born before the marriage. In 1132, Eric was defeated in battle by Niels and his son, Magnus. Due to this, Malfred, Eric, Sweyn, Ingeborg and her children, had to flee to Norway, to the court of Malmfred’s stepson, King Magnus of Norway. When Niels found out about this, he reached out to Magnus, and convinced him to turn Malmfred, Eric, and Sweyn over to him. Soon Magnus’s wife, and Malmfred’s niece, Christina found out about these plans. She warned Malmfred and Eric about this, and helped them escape in the night. Malmfred and Eric then allied with the rival-king of Norway, Harald Gille. When Magnus found out about his wife’s role in her aunt and uncle’s escape, he separated from her.\n\nQueen of Denmark\n\nOn 4 June 1134, the Battle of Fotevik was fought between Eric and Niels and his son, Magnus. During the battle, Magnus was killed, Niels fled, and Eric won. Niels was murdered just three weeks after the battle, and Eric became King of Denmark. Therefore, Malmfred became Queen Consort of Denmark. Just like her aunt, Margaret, Malmfred had successively became Queen of Norway and Denmark.\n\nLittle is known about Malmfred’s time as Queen of Denmark. There seems to be just one record from 1135, where Eric grants estates to the Archbishop of Lund, with the consent of Malfred and Sweyn. Eric turned out to be an unpopular king, and he was murdered at an assembly on 18 September 1137. There is no mention of Malmfred after this, so her date of death is unknown. She is thought to have died before 1150, because around this time, another daughter of the Rurikid dynasty was born and named Malmfred. This Malmfred was a daughter of Yuri Yaroslavich, Prince of Turov, and his wife, Anna of Grodno, who was a daughter of Malmfred’s aunt, Agafia. The younger Malmfred would later marry Vsevolod Yaroslavich, Prince of Lutsk. Apparently it was common for Rurikid princes to name their children after deceased relatives, so Malmfred is thought to have died before the younger Malmfred was born.\n\nMalmfred’s stepson ruled as King Sweyn III of Denmark from 1146 to 1157. Malmfred’s daughter, Christina, married a Norwegian nobleman named Erling Skakke. They had one son, named Magnus, was was King of Norway from 1161 to 1184.\n\nThe marriages of Malmfred and her sister Ingeborg are seen as important examples of marital ties and family alliances in early twelfth century Scandinavia.\n\nSources\n\nRaffensperger, Christian; “Dynastic Marriage in Action: How Two Rusian Princesses Changed Scandinavia”\n\nRaffensperger, Christian and Ostrowski, Donald; The Ruling Families of Rus: Clan, Family and Kingdom\n\nZajac, Natalia Anna Makaryk; “Women Between West and East: the Inter-Rite Marriages of the Kyivan Rus’ Dynasty, ca. 1000-1204”\n\n“Malmfred Mstislavna” on the website The Court of Russian Princesses of the XI-XVI centuries\n\n“Princess Malmfrida: Queen of the Two Nordic Countries”\n\nDuring the eleventh century, most of the daughters of the Grand Princes of Kyiv would be married off to foreign princes. However, in the early twelfth century, this began to change, and many of the Grand Prince’s daughters would marry within their own Rurikid dynasty. One of the first princesses to be married in this way was Agafia, the third daughter of Vladimir Monomakh.\n\nEarly Life\n\nLike most of the Rus princesses, we don’t know when Agafia was born. She was probably born in the late 1090’s at the earliest, and the early 1100’s at the latest. Since she was married in 1116, she was probably born no later than 1104. Her father was Vladimir II Monomakh, who would have been Prince of Pereyaslavl at the time of her birth. The identity of her mother is less certain. She could have been his first wife, Gytha of Wessex, or his second wife, Euphemia from the Byzantine. If Gytha of Wessex lived until 1107, she would have been Agafia’s mother. Agafia was one of Vladimir’s youngest children. She was the youngest of his three known daughters.\n\nMarriage\n\nAgafia’s father became Grand Prince of Kyiv in 1113. In 1116, Agafia was married to Vsevolod, Prince of Grodno. Vsevolod most likely came from the Rurikid dynasty, but his exact parentage is disputed. He is usually thought to be the son of David, Prince of Volyn, who in turn was the son of Igor, the youngest son of Yaroslav the Wise, Grand Prince of Kyiv and Ingegerd of Sweden. This would make Agafia and Vsevolod second cousins. Others believe he was the son of Yaroslav, who in turn was the son of Yaropolk, Prince of Turov and Volhynia and Kunigunde of Meissen. Yaropolk was the son of Iziaslav I, Grand Prince of Kyiv, and Gertrude of Poland. Iziaslav was the second son of Yaroslav the Wise. This would make Agafia and Vsevolod second cousins-once-removed. It is also suggested that Vsevolod could have come from the family of the Izyaslavychis of Polotsk, the descendants of Iziaslav, the eldest son of Vladimir the Great and Rogneda of Polotsk.\n\nAt the time of the marriage, Vsevolod appears to have been a landless prince. As a dowry, Agafia brought Castile Hill on the Neman River and its surroundings as an inheritance. The Neman River flows near the city of Grodno in present-day Belarus. Vsevolod was first mentioned as Prince of Grodno in 1127.\n\nEven though not much is said about Agafia, she is believed to have had a happier life and more successful marriage compared to her sisters. The husband of her oldest sister, Marina, turned out to be an imposter, and was eventually assassinated on the orders of the Byzantine Emperor. Her second sister, Euphemia, was accused of adultery a year into her marriage, and sent home, pregnant. Euphemia’s husband never recognized her son as his own. Marina and Euphemia’s sons were raised at the Rus court with no hope of having their own inheritance. As for Agafia, she and her husband had five children together. Agafia and Vsevolod may have ruled Grodno together. Agafia might have been very involved in the cultural life of the city. She is believed to have used her father’s writings to teach her children. Vsevolod appears to have been a close ally with Agafia’s family. In 1132, he accompanied his brother-in-law, Mstislav, now Grand Prince of Kyiv on a campaign against the Lithuanians.\n\nTogether, Agafia and Vsevolod had five children- three sons and two daughters:\n\nBoris (d. between 1151 and 1166) Prince of Grodno\n\nGleb (d. 1170) Prince of Grodno\n\nMstislav (d. after 1183) Prince of Grodno\n\nAnna (d. after 1190) married Yuri Yaroslavich, Prince of Turov\n\nUnnamed daughter, who first married Vladimir Davydovich, Prince of Chernigov, and secondly, Bashkord, Khan of the Cumans\n\nVsevolod died on 1 February 1141 or 1142. Nothing further is recorded about Agafia. She is thought to have died before 1144, when her two daughters were married, since she does not appear to have taken part in their marriages.\n\nAgafia’s Daughters\n\nAgafia had two daughters, Anna, and one whose name is not recorded. For convenience sake, I’ll refer to the unnamed daughter by her patronymic name, Vsevolodovna. It is not clear which one was the oldest. Their birthdates are not known, but they were likely born sometime between 1117 and 1132, since they were old enough to marry in 1144.\n\nIn 1144, the two sisters were married, possibly in a double wedding that took place on the same day. The marriages were arranged by Vsevolod II, who was the Grand Prince of Kyiv at the time. Vsevolod came from the Sviatoslavichi, a rival branch of the Rurikid dynasty, while Agafia came from the Monomakhovichi. (The Sviatoslavichi were descended from Svyatoslav, the third son of Yaroslav the Wise, while the Monomakhovichi were descended from Yaroslav’s fourth son, Vsevolod.) Anna was married to Yuri Yaroslavich, Prince of Pinsk and Turov. Yuri was the son of Yaroslav, Prince of Volhynia, who in turn was the son of Svyatopolk II, Grand Prince of Kyiv. Svyatopolk was the son of Iziaslav I, Grand Prince of Kyiv, the second son of Yaroslav the Wise. Vsevolodovna was married to Vladimir Davydovich, Prince of Chernigov. Vladimir was a first cousin of Grand Prince Vsevolod.\n\nEach of Agafia’s sons ruled Grodno. There is no record of them marrying or having children.\n\nAnna, Princess of Pinsk and Turov\n\nAnna had seven children- five sons and two daughters:\n\nIvan (d. after 1170), Prince of Turov\n\nSvyatopolk (d. 1190) Prince of Pinsk and Turov\n\nYaroslav (d. after. 1184) Prince of Pinsk\n\nGleb (d. 1195/6) Prince of Turov and Dubrovnik\n\nYaropolk (d. after. 1190) Prince of Pinsk\n\nAnna (d. after 1205) married Rurik Rostislavich, Prince of Novgorod, Chernigov, and Grand Prince of Kyiv\n\nMalmfred, married Vsevolod Yaroslavich, Prince of Lutsk\n\nAnna’s husband, Yuri, died around 1168. Anna was still alive in 1190, when she, along with her son-in-law, Rurik, were present at the wedding of her youngest son, Yaropolk.\n\nVsevolodovna, Princess of Chernigov\n\nVsevoldovna had just one known son with her husband, Vladimir: Svyatoslav, Prince of Vshchizh, who died in 1166 or 1167.\n\nVsevolodovna’s husband, Vladimir, was killed in battle on 12 May 1151. Soon afterwards, Vsevoldovna, together with her son, fled to the territory of the Cumans, who were allies of her husband’s family, seeking their protection. She married Bashkord, a Cuman khan, who ruled territories in what is now Southern Ukraine.\n\nAround this time, it was not unheard of for Rus princes to marry Cuman princesses. If fact, three previous Grand Princes of Kyiv were known to marry Cuman princesses: Vsevolod I married a Cuman princess as his second wife around 1069, Sviatopolk II married one as his second wife in 1094, and Yuri I married one as his first wife in 1108. When a Cuman princess married a Rus prince, she would convert to Orthodox Christianity, and be baptized under a Christian name, that she would be known by from then on. However, Rus princesses would not be married to Cuman princes. This is the only known marriage between a Rus princess and a Cuman prince. This marriage does not seem to be recognized as legitimate by the Rus princes. The marriage is also considered to have worsened the ties between Bashkord and the Sviatoslavichi family (the branch Vsevolodovna’s late husband was from).\n\nBashkord appears again in 1159 and 1160, when he was switching alliances between rival Rus princes. There appears to be no record of him and Vsevolodovna having any children together. There also seems to be no more mentions of Vsevolodovna after this.\n\nEven though records are very scarce concerning Agafia and her daughters, their marriages are early examples of the Rurikids marrying into their own dynasty rather than seeking foreign alliances. There would be many more marriages like these to come.\n\nSources\n\nEvgenievna, Morozova Lyudmila; Great and Unknown Women of Ancient Russia\n\nKucheruk, O.; “Princes and Princesses, Kings and Queens. Dynastic connections of Kievan Rus”\n\n“Agafia Vladimirovna” on the website The Court of Russian Princesses of the XI-XVI centuries\n\n“Agafia Vladimirovna” and “Vsevolod Davydovich” on grodno.by\n\nBetween the eleventh and thirteenth centuries, there were several marriages between the Arpads of Hungary and the Rurikids of Rus. Most of these marriages were successful, but the marriage of Euphemia of Kyiv and Coloman of Hungary was not.\n\nEarly Life\n\nEuphemia of Kyiv was born around 1096 or sometime in the late 1090s, to Vladimir Monomakh, who was at the time Prince of Pereyaslavl. It is debated whether her mother was Vladimir’s first wife, Gytha of Wessex, or his second wife, sometimes named Eufimia, who is thought to have been a Byzantine noblewoman or a Cuman princess. I tend to think that Gytha was most likely her mother, because she still seems to be alive at the time of Euphemia’s birth. Vladimir became Grand Prince of Kyiv in 1113, a year after Euphemia’s marriage.\n\nQueen of Hungary\n\nIn 1112, Euphemia married Coloman, King of Hungary, as his second wife. Coloman was at least twenty-five years older than her. Euphemia was about sixteen, and Coloman was about forty-two, with a son who was about only five years younger than his new wife. Coloman’s first wife was Felicia of Sicily. She bore him three or four children, two sons and one or two daughters. Felicia died sometime between 1102 and 1112. When Coloman’s son, Ladislaus, died in 1112, leaving him with one surviving son, Stephen, he decided to marry again in hope to produce additional heirs.\n\nColoman’s second marriage also seems to be a strategic move. In 1104, Coloman’s brother, Almos, married Predslava, the daughter of Sviatopolk II, who was Grand Prince of Kyiv at the time. Sviatopolk was the first cousin of Euphemia’s father, Vladimir. Over the years, Coloman and Almos were involved in on-and-off power struggles between each other. By marrying a woman from a rival branch of the Rurikid dynasty, Coloman counterbalanced his brother’s alliance with Rus.\n\nHis new wife’s time as Queen of Hungary was not to last long. A year into her marriage, Euphemia was accused of adultery. Very little is known of this incident, not even the name and fate of her supposed lover. However, one source says that her lover was the king’s brother, Almos. It is true that Coloman ordered Almos to be blinded, and possibly even castrated by 1115, to remove him from the line of succession. Almos had revolted against Coloman many times up until then. Coloman divorced Euphemia and sent her back to Kyiv, pregnant. In 1113/14, she gave birth to a son named Boris, a name from her own dynasty. Coloman did not consider Boris as his own son.\n\nThere is some debate if Euphemia was actually guilty of adultery. Some believe that she actually was a victim of a political conspiracy. It has been suggested that when the relatives of Felicia found out Euphemia was pregnant, they turned Coloman against her, so they could remove any competition against his older son, Stephen. Coloman was seriously ill at the time, and it is possible that his first wife’s family was planning on seeing his twelve-year-old son, Stephen, soon come to the throne. They may have feared the influence of Euphemia and her relatives, so they wanted to disinherit any children she had, so the young Stephen would not have any competition.\n\nColoman also could have repudiated Euphemia for his own political reasons and used adultery as an excuse. The same year Euphemia was accused of adultery, her father became Grand Prince of Kyiv. Vladimir did not have a good relationship with the Byzantine, while Coloman had close ties with the Empire, and staying married to Vladimir’s daughter might have soured his ties. It has also been suggested that Coloman felt jealous and suspicious of his much-younger wife.\n\nLater Life\n\nWhether or not her family believed she was guilty, Euphemia seems to have been completely welcome back in Kyiv. They believed her son, Boris, to be a true son of Coloman, and he was raised in the Kyivan court alongside his maternal cousins. Coloman refused to acknowledge Boris as his son, but Euphemia raised him with the belief that he really was his son. Coloman never remarried and died soon after, in 1116. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Stephen II. Even though he never knew the old king, Boris believed that he was truly his son.\n\nSome time after her divorce, Euphemia became a nun. She would eventually be joined by her sister, Marina, who was widowed in 1116. Euphemia died on 4 April 1138 or 1139 and was buried at the Church of the Holy Savior in Berestovo, near Kyiv- a monastery that was very important to her family. Her fate is somewhat similar to that of her aunt, Eupraxia. Eupraxia had been married to Holy Roman Emperor Henry V, but she eventually separated from him, claiming he was abusive. Some chroniclers claim that Henry forced other men onto Eupraxia. Eupraxia was able to return to Kyiv after her divorce, and was accepted by her family. She became a nun, and was given an honorable burial after her death at a prominent monastery. Despite the scandals that were attached to them in their adopted countries, both Euphemia and Eupraxia were able to be welcomed back, and keep a high status in their home countries.\n\nBoris’s Hungarian Ambitions\n\nEven though Euphemia’s son, Boris was born in Kiev and grew up at the court of his maternal grandfather, he always saw himself as a true Hungarian prince. In 1131, Stephen II of Hungary died childless. He was succeeded by his cousin, Bela II of Hungary, who had been blinded with his father around 1115. Boris tried to lay claim to the Hungarian throne. He went to the Byzantine Empire, where he got the support of Emperor John II Komnenos. John even married Boris to one of his nieces. Boris adopted the surname of “Kalamonos”, to show that he was Coloman’s son. His attempt to seize the crown was unsuccessful. He would make two more failed attempts on the Hungarian throne in 1145 and 1147. After his failed attempts, he settled in the Byzantine empire. Boris and his wife had at least two sons. Boris was killed in battle against Hungary in 1153 or 1154. Neither Boris nor his sons were ever recognized as legitimate members of Hungary’s royal Arpad dynasty. Boris’s sons never tried to lay claim to Hungary.\n\nEuphemia has largely been forgotten by history. She only spent about a year as Queen of Hungary. Many Rus princesses went on to become powerful queens in their new countries, but for Euphemia, she was driven out early on. Whether or not she was guilty of adultery, Euphemia never seems to have had a chance to prove what type of queen she could have been.\n\nSources\n\nBak, Janos M.; “Queens as Scapegoats in Medieval Hungary” in Queens and Queenship in Medieval Europe\n\nEvgenievna, Morozova Lyudmila; Great and Unknown Women of Ancient Russia\n\nMielke, Christopher; “Every hiacinth the garden wears: the material culture of medieval queens of Hungary (1000-1395)”\n\nMielke, Christopher; “No Country for old Women: Burial Practices and Patterns of Hungarian Queens of the Arpad Dyanasty (975-1301)”\n\nMielke, Christopher; The Archaeology and Material Culture of Queenship in Medieval Hungary, 1000-1395\n\nVoloshchuk, Myroslav; “Ruthenian-Hungarian Matrimonial Connections in the Context of the Rurik Inter-dynasty Policy of the 10th-14th centuries: Selected Statistical Data”\n\nZajac, Natalia Anna Makaryk; “Women Between West and East: the Inter-Rite Marriages of the Kyivan Rus’ Dynasty, ca. 1000-1204”\n\n“Euphemia of Kiev” on the website The Court of Russian Princesses of the XI-XVI centuries\n\nYou probably know by now that real-life royalty is no fairytale. But it is quite rare to find a story about a princess marrying a prince, only to find out that he is not a prince, but an imposter, and the real prince has been dead the whole time. A real-life princess this happened to was Marina, the eldest daughter of Vladimir II of Kyiv.\n\nEarly Life\n\nIt is not known when Marina was born. She was most likely born before 1090. Her parents were Vladimir II Monomakh, Grand Prince of Kyiv, and his first wife, Gytha of Wessex. Her parents married in 1075 at the latest, and their first son was born the next year. So Marina was probably born sometime between 1077 and 1089. She is believed to be the eldest of Vladimir’s three or four daughters. Her name is also written as Maria or Maritsa. At the time of Marina’s birth, her father was Prince of Chernigov. He would not become Grand Prince of Kyiv until 1113.\n\nThe Real Leo Diogenes\n\nRoman IV Diogenes was a Byzantine Emperor who ruled from 1068 to 1071. By his first wife, he had one son, named Constantine. His second wife was Eudokia Makrembolitissa, who was the widow of the previous emperor, Constantine X. By her, he had two more sons, Leo and Nikephoros. These two sons were co-emperors from the time they were born. Roman was deposed in 1071, and died the next year. Eudokia was banished to a monastery with Leo and Nikephoros. Roman’s eldest son, Constantine died in battle in 1073.\n\nIn 1081, Alexios I Komnenos became Byzantine Emperor. He took in Leo and Nikephoros and raised them as if they were his own. Leo became a strong supporter of the new emperor. Leo would take part in military campaigns on behalf of Alexios. Unfortunately, Leo was killed in a battle against the Pechenegs in 1087. He was only about eighteen.\n\nThe Rise of the Imposters\n\nIn 1094, the surviving brother, Nikephoros was caught leading a conspiracy against Alexios. Because of this, he was blinded. Soon afterwards, at least two imposters appeared, and claimed to be his two dead brothers. In the 1090s, a man appeared claiming to be the oldest brother, Constantine. In 1095, he was arrested and blinded. Sometime after this, another imposter appeared, claiming to be Leo Diogenes.\n\nIt is unknown who this man really was. It is also debated when he first started impersonating the Byzantine prince. It could have been as early as the 1090s, or as late as the 1110s. Sometime during these years, he arrived at the court of Vladimir Monomakh. Vladimirs seems to believe that this man was the real Leo Diogenes, and decided to support his claims.\n\nMarriage\n\nIn order to support the imposter’s claims, Vladimir married him to his daughter Marina. The date of their marriage is unknown. The 18th-century historian, Vasily Tatishchev wrote that the marriage took place on 20 July 1104 in Constantinople, but this claim is not usually accepted. The marriage may have occurred as early as the 1090s or as late as 1116. However, the mid-1100s decade does seem to be a good estimate for the time of the marriage.\n\nMarina and her husband appear to have settled in the Rus city of Voin. They had one son together, named Vasilko. Vasilko’s surname is variously shown as Leonovich, after his father’s claimed name, or Marichich, after his mother’s name.\n\nAround 1116, Vladimir gave a number of Byzantine cities along the Danube to the false Leo. It is possible that he planned on creating a new state out of these cities which would be subject to Rus. Soon afterwards, the false Leo settled in Dorostol (now Silistra in Bulgaria). In the summer of 1116, Vladimir and his son-in-law launched a campaign against the Byzantine Empire. It is possible that Vladimir hoped to place the imposter and his daughter on the imperial throne. This would never happen. The false Leo was killed on 15 August 1116 by assassins sent by Emperor Alexios.\n\nMarina and her young son returned to Kyiv soon afterwards. It is unknown if she ever believed that her husband was an imposter. Whether or not Vladimir believed his son-in-law was an imposter, it seems that the Grand Prince might have been trying to use his influence to set his son-in-law on the Byzantine throne. After the death of the imposter, Vladimir set up his own governors in the Danube cities to rule in the name of his grandson, Vasilko. This would not last long, because the Rus troops would eventually be driven out by the Emperor.\n\nLater Life\n\nMarina would not marry again. She seems to have remained in Kyiv and raised her son. Vasilko would grow up to be loyal to his mother’s family, and seems to have no imperial ambitions. In 1135, he was killed in battle, fighting for his uncle, Yaropolk, who was now the Grand Prince of Kyiv.\n\nAt an unknown date during her widowhood, Marina became a nun. It is not known what monastery she resided at, but it was possibly the Church of the Holy Savior in Berestovo, near Kyiv. This is based on the fact that her sister, Euphemia was a nun at this monastery, after she was divorced by her husband, the King of Hungary. Euphemia, and a brother and nephew of Marina were known to be buried at the monastery.\n\nMarina seems to have spent her final years involved in charity and church construction. She died on 20 January 1146 or 1147, and was buried in a church that she founded. The chronicles do not name the church, but it possibly was the one in Berestovo.\n\nSources\n\nEvgenievna, Morozova Lyudmila; Great and Unknown Women of Ancient Russia\n\nKucheruk, O.; “Princes and Princesses, Kings and Queens. Dynastic connections of Kievan Rus”\n\nMielke, Christopher; The Archaeology and Material Culture of Queenship in Medieval Hungary, 1000-1395\n\n“Maritsa, daughter of Monomakh. Why was she married to an imposter?”\n\nIn the eleventh and twelfth centuries, there were several marriages between the Rus and Hungary. Usually it was a king who married a Rus princess, but in this case, a king’s younger brother married one of these highly desired princesses.\n\nThe princess in question was named Predslava. She was born around 1090 to Sviatopolk II, Grand Prince of Kyiv, and his first wife, who might have been a Bohemian princess. Nothing is known about Predslava’s life until 1104, when she went to Hungary for her marriage. The Russian Primary Chronicle records that Predslava was taken to Hungary on 21 August 1104.\n\nSoon afterwards, Predslava married Almos, the second son of Geza I, King of Hungary. Geza had died in 1077, and was succeeded by his brother, Ladislaus I, because his sons, Coloman and Almos, were still children. Even though Coloman was the older brother, Ladislaus wanted him to have a career in the church, and Almos to be his heir. Coloman was not happy with this decision. Ladislaus had also made Almos Duke of Croatia and Slavonia. When Ladislaus died in 1095, Coloman became King of Hungary soon afterwards. The two brothers may have fought over the crown, but they soon came to an agreement. Around this time, Almos became Duke of Nyitra, which is in present-day Slovakia.\n\nAlmos and Coloman had another falling-out between each other in 1097. Almos’s 1104 marriage to Predslava may have been to ally himself with Rus in his struggle against his brother. Almos would spend the following years in and out of Hungary, and given that he and Predslava had three children during this time, she likely accompanied him on his journeys. Their three children were:\n\nAdelaide (c.1105/07-1140) Married Sobeslav I, Duke of Bohemia\n\nBela II (c.1108/09-1141) King of Hungary from 1131-1141\n\nHedwig/Sophia (c.1107 or aft. 1108-c.1138) Married Adalbert II, Margrave of Austria\n\nIn 1105, Coloman had his four-year-old son, Stephen, crowned to ensure his succession. Almos rose up in revolt against his brother, and fled to the court of Holy Roman Emperor, Henry IV, to seek his assistance. Henry had previously been married to Predslava’s cousin, Eupraxia, but they had separated in 1095. The emperor was involved in his own conflicts, and could not help Almos. Instead, Almos returned to Hungary in 1106. However, he soon afterwards went to Poland to seek assistance from Duke Boleslaw III, who was married to Predslava’s sister, Zbyslava.\n\nSoon afterwards, Boleslaw switched his allegiance to Coloman, and Almos had no choice but to yield to his brother. In 1107-1108, Almos went on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. During his absence, Coloman seized his properties. Afterwards, Almos went to Germany, and allied with the new Emperor, Henry V. There is no mention whether Predslava accompanied him on these journeys, but it is likely, since their son, Bela, was born around 1108. Around this time, Henry invaded Hungary on Almos’s behalf, but was ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nColoman forgave Almos, and allowed him to return to Hungary. However, peace would not last forever. In 1112, Coloman married Predslava’s second cousin, Euphemia, possibly trying to create an alliance to challenge Almos’s. Sometime between 1112 and 1115, Almos conspired to seize the throne again. Coloman was less merciful this time. He arrested Almos, and his son, Bela, who was no more than seven at the time, and had them blinded. According to some sources, Coloman wanted his brother and nephew castrated too, but only Almos was castrated out of fear that the royal line would be put in jeopardy. Apparently Coloman had his brother and nephew mutilated to make them ineligible for kingship. After his mutilation, Coloman lived in a monastery. There is no mention about what had happened to Predslava. If she was still alive at the time, it is likely that she was sent to a monastery too.\n\nColoman died in 1116, and was succeeded by his son, Stephen. Soon afterwards, Almos fled to the Byzantine Empire, in fear of his life. Once again, there is no mention of Predslava, but if she were still alive and married to Almos, it is likely she went with him. Almos died in Constantinople on 1 September 1127. When Stephen II died childless in 1131, he was succeeded by Almos’s son, Bela, although he was blind. Due to this, all further Hungarian kings in the Arpad dynasty descended from Almos and Predslava.\n\nLike so many other details about her, the place of Predslava’s death and burial is also unknown. Almos was firstly buried in the Byzantine, but in 1137, his body was returned to Hungary and buried in Székesfehérvár Basilica. It is suggested that Predslava could also be buried at Székesfehérvár.\n\nAlmost nothing is known about Predslava, and this article turned out to be more about her husband than her. However, from the fact that they had at least three children together, Predslava must have experienced Almos’s travels with him. This would have made her very well-traveled for the time.\n\nSources\n\nMielke, Christopher; “Every hiacinth the garden wears: the material culture of medieval queens of Hungary (1000-1395)”\n\nMielke, Christopher; The Archaeology and Material Culture of Queenship in Medieval Hungary, 1000-1395\n\nVoloshchuk, Myroslav; “Ruthenian-Hungarian Matrimonial Connections in the Context of the Rurik Inter-dynasty Policy of the 10th-14th centuries: Selected Statistical Data”\n\nZajac, Natalia Anna Makaryk; “Women Between West and East: the Inter-Rite Marriages of the Kyivan Rus’ Dynasty, ca. 1000-1204”\n\n“Predslava Svyatopolkovna” on the website The Court of Russian Princesses of the XI-XVI centuries"
