It lay in the path of successive waves of so-called barbarian invaders who migrated into Europe from central Asia between the 4th and 9th centuries. Their influence was widespread in Balkan Europe north of the Byzantine empire but for convenience the families of these invaders are shown in this document concerning Hungary, where many of them settled at least temporarily.\n\nThe territory of \"Pannonia\" was organised as a separate province of the Roman empire, centred on what is today Hungary, in AD 10 . It was heavily fortified as protection against barbarian incursions from the east. Gregory of Tours, writing towards the end of the 6th century, records that \"it is commonly said\" that the Franks originated in Pannonia, before migrating northwards across the river Rhine into Germany and later northern France, citing \"the historians whose works we still have\" . No other source has so far been identified which corroborates this claim. If it is correct, the Frankish occupation of Pannonia predated the arrival of the Ostrogoths in the territory.\n\nLoss of Roman control of Pannonia was confirmed when Emperor Valens was defeated by the Goths in 378 at the battle of Adrianople, in neighbouring Thrace. In the last decades of the 4th century, the Ostrogoths migrated into Pannonia from the area north of the Danube and used it as their base from which to launch their onward migration into Italy. The mythical origins and later history of the Goths is recorded by Jordanes in his mid-6th century Getica . Well-connected with the contemporary ruling class in Italy, and not too distant in time at least from the later events which he records, it is reasonable to suppose that his narrative is broadly accurate, although impossible to identify the precise moment in the text when myth evolves into fact. The Ostrogoth settlements in Pannonia came under pressure from the Huns who were competing for territory. While Hun/Ostrogoth collaboration at the battle of the Catalaunian fields in Gaul indicates some early coordination between the two groups, the onward migration of the Ostrogoths from Pannonia in the 470s was probably motivated in part by pressure from the Huns.\n\nThe Langobards, more commonly known as Lombards, were the third set of invaders, migrating from Moravia into Pannonia in the 520s, before being invited into Italy in the 550s. This preceded their mass migration into the Italian peninsular which is dated to 568/69, although it is not known whether this exodus involved a complete abandonment of the Lombard settlements in Pannonia .\n\nIn the 8th century, Pannonia was part of the Avar khaganate centred on the Tisza river. Charles I King of the Franks (later Emperor Charlemagne) eliminated the independent Avar state during his campaign in 795-96. The Croatians, previously subjects of the Avars, established a principality under Frankish overlordship, under the direct suzerainty of the Marchesi of Friulia , although this was absorbed into the twin Croatian principality of Dalmatia in the 820s (see the document CROATIA). The Croatian principality became part of the kingdom of the East Franks, under Ludwig II \"der Deutsche\" King of Germany, after the division of the Frankish empire under the 843 Treaty of Verdun.\n\nMeanwhile, the last invasion of Pannonia, that of the Magyars, was being prepared. During the 6th-9th centuries, the Magyar tribes formed part of the Khazar confederacy, whose ruler appointed their leader, the \"kende\". By 830, seven tribes of Magyars were established above the Maeotis, on the right bank of the River Don, in the region of Lebedia north of the Black Sea, where they led a nomadic existence. Other Magyar tribes lived in the Ural steppes and in the Caucasus. The seven tribes formed a loose federation without a single supreme authority . According to Hungarian national tradition, their chieftains elected Árpád, the most powerful among them, as overall leader. The Gesta Hungarorum records that \"Hunni sive Hungari\" (referring to the Magyar) divided into seven armies, each having 30,000 warriors and a single commander of whom \"Arpad \" was the most powerful and the first to enter Pannonia .\n\nAn assumption evolved among later medieval historians that the Magyars descended from the Huns. This is the basis of the narrative of Simon of Kéza's Gesta Hungarorum, the surviving 18th century versions of which are assumed to be based on a late 13th century manuscript which can no longer be traced . The Gestis Hungarorum Liber names \"Ugek de genere Magog regis dux Scythie\", apparently also confirming this alleged descent from Attila, when recording that he was the ancestor of Árpád first Magyar leader in Hungary . According to the Gesta Hungarorum, the \"Hungarian nation\" comprised 108 clans which trace their ancestry to \"filios Hunos et Magor\" born in the marshes of Meotis after they invaded \"Scythia\" , although the only specific genealogical link with the Huns which is quoted in this source is the alleged descent of the Aba clan from Csaba, supposed son of Attila . The Annals of Lambert record that \"regina Ungariorum, mater Salomonis regis\" presented the sword of \"rex Hunnorum Attila\" to \"duci Baioriorum Ottoni\" after her son was restored as king of Hungary , suggesting that the alleged Magyar/Hun connection was not solely an invention of later Hungarian sources. A connection with the Huns is apparently suggested by the name \"Hungary\", assigned by western Europeans to the country. However, there are other theories to explain the origin of the name. According to Hungarian scholarship, the name derives from the Onogur confederation of tribes to which the ancestors of the Magyars once belonged . Macartney states that the word \"Hungarian\" is a Slavicised form of the Turkish term \"On Ogur\" (meaning Ten Arrows), by which the Magyars were known by their Khazar neighbours who held the mouth of the Volga . On the other hand, the Gesta Hungarorum records that \"Hunni sive Hungari\" finally settled \"in fluvio Hung [Ung]\" where they built a fortress and, later, six other castles, and that the name \"Hungari\" given to them by western people derives from this river .\n\nThe Annals of Saint-Bertin record that the Magyars first raided Frankish territory in 862 . Under military threat to the east from the Pechenegs, the latter launched a major attack on the original Magyar homeland in 889, forcing the Magyars to migrate westwards and re-settle in the area later known as Bessarabia and Moldavia . According to the Russian Primary Chronicle, the Magyars \"passed by Kiev and on arriving at the Dnieper pitched camp\", expelled the Vlakhs and settled on their land . The Gesta Hungarorum records that \"Hunni sive Hungari\", indicating the Magyars, passed through \"regna Bessorum [Pechenegs], Alborum Comanorum [White Kumans] et civitatem Kyo [Kiev]\" on their way to Pannonia . To avoid the threat of further attacks from the east, Árpád led the Magyars further west across the mountains into Transylvania, where the Szekels submitted voluntarily. From there, they passed into the region which is now Hungary where the existing population was sparse.\n\nIn 892, Emperor Arnulf enlisted a contingent of Magyars to help suppress his vassal Sviatopluk King of Moravia, not anticipating the longer term implications of his move. The Magyars continued to raid on their own account, and in 907 defeated a Bavarian army at Ennsburg and extended their rule to the old Avar frontier at the confluence of the Enns and Danube rivers. Árpád's own tribe settled in the Dunántúl between Székesfehérvár (where he established his headquarters) and Buda. Another of the seven tribes, led by Gyula, settled in Transylvania. The Magyars continued to inflict major damage with their raids on western Europe, although they were defeated by Heinrich \"the Fowler\" King of Germany at Riade near Merseburg in 933. Their defeat by Otto I King of Germany at Augsburg in 955 marked the end of this aggressive lifestyle. The raids ceased and, after his accession in [970], Géza Prince of Hungary sent ambassadors to the court of Emperor Otto I .\n\nThe arrival of Christianity played a significant role in the development of Hungary. Prince István, son of Géza, received a royal crown from the Pope, who was anxious to extend his sphere of influence and prevent the Orthodox church from gaining ground in Hungary. István was crowned as first king of Hungary in 1000.\n\nThe descendants of Árpád ruled Hungary until 1301. Traditional dynastic succession was by seniority. Of the 24 successions between István I in 1000 and András III in 1290, there were only eight cases of the king being succeeded by his eldest son. During the nine years which followed the extinction of the dynasty in the male line in 1301, four rival claimants for the Hungarian crown emerged. Representatives of eight different dynasties ruled Hungary over the succeeding 250 years. Succession of each new dynasty was based on power, backed in most cases by a family connection with the preceding dynasty either through the female line or engineered by marriage.\n\nDespite the long series of foreign monarchs, Hungary remained independent. Integration with each new monarch's country of origin was avoided by the fiction of personal rule. The most extreme example was King Albert, from the Austrian Habsburg dynasty, who in his personal capacity ruled Austria, Bohemia and Germany as well as Hungary. He was also elected King of the Romans, although he died before being crowned emperor. Even after the dynastic succession settled permanently with the Habsburgs in 1526, there was no political integration between Austria and Hungary, the two countries being ruled separately until the early 20th century under what became known as the Dual Monarchy.\n\nChapter 1. KINGS of the OSTROGOTHS in PANNONIA\n\nThe Goths originally lived north of the Danube. According to legend, they had migrated to the Black Sea area from the island of Scandza in the Baltic Sea, before separating into two tribal groups, the Visigoths to the west and the Ostrogoths to the east. Under pressure from the Huns, they sought permission from the Roman Emperor Valens to move into the Roman Empire to the south of the river Danube. By 380, the Ostrogoths had settled in Pannonia as federates of Emperor Gratian, but appear to have become subjects of the Huns . Two dynasties of Goth kings are recorded in Pannonia: the Sciri Goths (see Part A below) and the Amal Goths (Part B). There is considerable uncertainty about the early Ostrogoth kings and their history. Procopius records that the Goths were given permission by the (western) Roman emperor to settle in Thraciam, but he does not specify whether this was after living in Pannonia . The Ostrogoth Theodoric captured Italy and declared himself king in 493. He and members of his family continued to rule in Italy until 536.\n\nA. DYNASTY of the SCIRI GOTHS\n\nEDICA, son of --- (-killed in battle [467/68]). He was the leader of the Sciri and united his troops with those of Hunimund King of the Suevi to march against the Pannonian Ostrogoths. He was killed during the attack .\n\nEdica had two sons:\n\n1. HUNULF . After the failure of the attack on the Pannonian Ostrogoths, and the death of his father, Hunulf entered the service of the Eastern Empire . He left to join his brother in Italy in 479 . After his brother was killed he sought refuge in a church and was used as a target by Ostrogoth archers . Isidor's Historia Gothorum, Wandalorum, Sueborum names \"Odoacar rege Ostrogothorum atque fratre eius Onoulfo\" when recording that the latter fled across the Danube after his brother was captured .\n\n2. ODOVACAR ([428/29]-murdered 15 Mar 493) . His birth date range is estimated from Wolfram speculating that Odovacar was 60 years old when put to flight by Theodoric in 489 . After his father's death, he became a soldier in Italy, where he led the Heruli, Rugians and Turcilingi and was considered their king . He deposed Romulus \"Augustulus\", last of the Roman Emperors in the West, in 476, becoming ODOVACAR King of Italy.\n\n- KINGS of ITALY.\n\nB. DYNASTY of the AMAL GOTHS\n\nIordanes sets out the supposed ancestors of Athal, in order, as follows \"Gapt Hulmul Augis Amal a quo et origo Amalorum decurrit Hisarnis Ostrogotha Hunuil Athal\" . Nothing is known about the Amal Goth leaders, supposed descendants of Athal, who are shown below apart from the sparse amount of information which has been extracted from Iordanes.\n\nATHAL . Athal had two children:\n\n1. ACHIULF . Iordanes names \"Achiulf et Oduulf\" as the sons of Athal . Achiulf had four children:\n\na) ANSILA . Iordanes names \"Ansila et Ediulf, Vultuulf et Hermenerig\" as the sons of Achiulf .\n\nb) EDIULF . Iordanes names \"Ansila et Ediulf, Vultuulf et Hermenerig\" as the sons of Achiulf .\n\nc) VULTWULF . Iordanes names \"Ansila et Ediulf, Vultuulf et Hermenerig\" as the sons of Achiulf . Vultwulf had one child:\n\ni) VALARAVANS . Iordanes names \"Valaravans\" as the son of Vultwulf . Valaravans had one child:\n\n(a) VINITHARIUS . Iordanes names \"Vinitharius\" as the son of Valaravans . Vinitharius had one child:\n\n(1) VANDALARIUS . Iordanes names \"Vandiliarum\" as son of Vinitharius .\n\n- see below.\n\nd) HERMENRICH . Iordanes names \"Ansila et Ediulf, Vultuulf et Hermenerig\" as the sons of Achiulf . Hermenrich had one child:\n\ni) HUNIMUND . Iordanes names \"Hunimundum\" as son of \"Hermanaricus\" . Hunimund had one child:\n\n(a) THORISMUND (-killed in battle [451/55]). Iordanes names \"Thorismundo\" as son of \"Hunimundus\" . Iordanes records that \"Thorismundo filius eius\" succeeded as King of the Goths after the death of \"Hunimundus filius quondam regis Hermanarici\" but was killed fighting the Gepids in the second year of his reign . Thorismund had one child:\n\n(1) BERIMUD . Iordanes names \"Berimud\" as son of \"Thorismundo\" . Iordanes records that \"Beremud cum filio Vitiricho\" left the Ostrogoths to join \"Vallia rex Gothorum\" [King of the Visigoths in Toulouse] . The implication of a later passage in Iordanes, which records that \"Valamer ex consobrino eius genitus Vandalario\" succeeded as king after \"Thorismundo\" was killed , is that Berimud's departure was triggered after he was passed over in the succession. Berimud had one child:\n\na. VETERICUS . Iordanes names \"Vetericum\" as son of \"Berimud\" . Vetericus had one child:\n\n(i) EUTHARICH (-[522/23]) . Iordanes names \"Eutharicum\" as son of \"Vetericus\" and as husband of \"Amalasuentham\" and father of their two children . Eutharic was adopted by Emperor Justin in recognition of his father-in-law's decision to designate him his successor after his marriage. He was given Roman citizenship and became first consul in 519 as FLAVIUS EUTHARICUS CILLIGA . Wolfram estimates that Eutharich died in [522/23] . Jordanes specifies that Eutharich predeceased King Theodoric's nomination of his son Athalaric as his successor. m (515) AMALASUINTHA, daughter of THEODORIC King of the Ostrogoths in Italy & his wife Audofledis of the Franks ([493]-murdered [30 Apr] 535). The Chronicle of Cassiodorus records the marriage in 515 of \"Theodericus filiam usam dominam Amalasuintam\" and \"gloriosi viri dn Eutharici\" .\n\n2. ODWULF . Iordanes names \"Achiulf et Oduulf\" as the sons of Athal .\n\nVANDALARIUS, son of VINITHARIUS . Iordanes names \"Vandiliarum\" as son of \"Vinitharius\" and father of \"Thiudemer et Valamir et Vidimir\" . Relative of Thorismund .\n\n1. VALAMIR (-killed in battle [468/69]). Iordanes names \"Thiudemer et Valamir et Vidimir\" as the sons of Vandilarius . He and his brothers followed Attila the Hun into Gaul in 451 . Valamir commanded the Ostrogoth contingent in Attila's army which was defeated at the battle of the Catalaunian fields . He was considered king of all Ostrogoths in Pannonia. Iordanes records that \"Valamer ex consobrino eius genitus Vandalario\" succeeded as king after \"Thorismundo\" was killed fighting the Gepids in the second year of his reign . He shared the land with his two brothers, retaining for himself the eastern part of the territory covering lower Slavonia. In 456, he defeated an attack by the Huns, who are said to have retreated to the River Dnieper . He defeated another Hun attack on Bassianae, near Belgrade, in 467/68, but was killed in battle during a similar attack the following year.\n\n2. THEODEMIR [Thiudimir] (-Kyrrhos 474) . Iordanes names \"Thiudemer et Valamir et Vidimir\" as the sons of Vandilarius . King of the Ostrogoths in Pannonia, subordinate to his brother Valamir, he ruled over the western part of their domain which covered the county of Somogy and north-eastern Croatia. He succeeded his brother in [468/49] as King of all the Pannonian Ostrogoths. Iordanes names \"Theodemir\" when recording that he succeeded his brother \"Valamero rege Gothorum\" together with \"Vidimero fratre et filio Theodorico\" . When the Ostrogoths left Pannonia in [473], Theodemir and his contingent went towards Constantinople. They settled in Macedonia, based in the city of Kyrrhos .\n\n- KINGS of ITALY.\n\n3. VIDIMIR (-473). Iordanes names \"Thiudemer et Valamir et Vidimir\" as the sons of Vandilarius . King of the Ostrogoths in Pannonia, subordinate to his brother Valamir, he ruled over the central part of their domain which covered upper Slavonia. Iordanes names \"Theodemir\" when recording that he succeeded his brother \"Valamero rege Gothorum\" together with \"Vidimero fratre et filio Theodorico\" . When the Ostrogoths left Pannonia in [473], Vidimir went into Italy where he suffered several defeats.\n\na) VIDIMIR. Iordanes records that \"Vidimero cum Vidimero filio\" were sent to \"partes Hesperias\" by Theodemir . After his father's death, Emperor Glycerius sent Vidimir and his contingent of Pannonian Ostrogoths to Gaul, where he settled in the Limousin .\n\nC. GEPIDS\n\nJordanes states that the Gepids were a sub-group of the Goths, recounting that during the migration from Scandinavia their ship was the slowest, their name being derived from \"gepanta\" meaning \"sluggish ones\". The Gepids migrated southwards and settled east of the river Tisza in present-day Hungary. By the 370s, they had fallen under the domination of the Huns. After fighting as Hun allies at the battle of the Catalaunian Fields in 451, their leader Ardaric defeated Ellac, son of Attila, at the battle of Nedao river in 454. The Ostrogoths defeated a Gepid, Rugian and Scythian alliance at the river Bolia in 469, but in 471 the Gepids captured Sirmium, in territory conquered by the Ostrogoths on their way into Italy. The Gepids recaptured Sirmium under king Elemund. The Lombards conquered the Gepid kingdom in the mid-6th century. Little detailed information has been found relating to the Gepid rulers.\n\n1. TURISIND . Paulus Diaconus records the death of \"Turisindus rex Gepidorum\" . Turisind had one child:\n\na) TURISMOD . Paulus Diaconus names \"Turismodus, Turisindi filius\" .\n\n2. OSTROGOTHA [Austreusa/Austrigosa] . The Origo Gentis Langobardorum names \"Austrigusa filiam Gippidorum\" as King Wacho's second wife . The Historia Langobardorum names \"Austreusa filia Gibedorum\" as Wacho's second wife . m as his second wife, WACHO King of the Lombards, son of ZUCHILO [Unichis] of the Lombards (-540).\n\n3. CUNIMUND (-killed in battle 567). Paulus Diaconus records the accession of \"Cunimundus\" as king after the death of \"Turisindus rex Gepidorum\" . He also reports that Alboin King of the Lombards defeated and killed him in battle in 567, allegedly making his skull into a drinking cup , although this should probably not be taken literally as it is the fate of defeated warriors which is recorded in many primary sources relating to eastern European history in the early medieval period . The Origo Gentis Langobardorum records that Albuin fought and killed in battle \"rege Gippidorum Cunimund\", weakening the power of the Gepids . Cunimund had one child:\n\na) ROSAMUNDIS (-after 572) . The Origo Gentis Langobardorum records the marriage of Albuin to \"Rosemunda filia Cunimundi\" after killing her father in battle . Theophylactus records that \"Longobardicæ gentis principem Alboinum\" married \"adolescentulam Conimundi Gepidarum regis filiam\" . Paulus Diaconus names \"filiam [Cunimundum] Rosimundam\" as second wife of Alboin, who married her after killing her father in battle . Gregory of Tours records that Alboin King of the Lombards married his second wife soon after he had killed her father and that \"she loathed her husband as a result\" and poisoned him \"for she had become enamoured of one of his servants\" with whom she fled before they were both caught and put to death . The Origo Gentis Langobardorum records that Albuin was killed in Verona by \"Hilmichis et Rosemunda uxore sua per consilium Peritheo\", before she was poisoned herself with Hilmichis by \"Longinus præfectus\" . According to Paulus Diaconus, she incited the murder of her husband by his own men . m ([567] as his second wife, ALBOIN King of the Lombards, son of AUDOIN King of the Lombards & his first wife --- (-murdered Verona 28 Jun 572).\n\nChapter 2. HUNS\n\nThe earliest records of the exploits of the Huns are contained in the Chronicle of Marcellinus and the mid-6th century Getica of Jordanes. The late 13th century Gesta Hungarorum names \"Wele Chele file filius ex genere Zemen\", his brothers \"Cuwe et Caducha\", and \"ducis Ethela Bendacuz filius de genere Erd oriundi\" as leaders of the \"Huni in Scitia\", dating this to 700 . The dating is clearly incorrect, and the origin of the names, which bear no resemblance to any names in the earlier sources, is unknown. It is possible that the Huns were connected with the Avars. Paulus Diaconus refers to \"Avaribus qui primum Hunni\" stating that they changed their name after \"regis proprii Avares\" , but there is clearly considerable confusion in the early sources relating to the names of the various barbarian tribes. A presumably spurious charter of Lászlo I King of Hungary, dated 1095, records the descent of the \"familiæ Estoras\": \"Eursus Dux fuit filius Ducis Essed, qui fuit Eudmedzur, qui Ernaci ducis, fratris Vegeci, qui Edi, qui Chabæ regis, qui magni Atilæ, qui Bendeguz Scythiæ imperatoris, qui Turdæ, qui Stemene, qui tandem magni Scytharum imperatoris Opos filius fuit\" (adding that the last named lived at the time of Christ) .\n\nThree brothers:\n\n1. OCTAR . Iordanes names \"Attila patre genitus Munduzco\" and his \"germani Octar et Roas\", recording that they held the kingdom before Attila .\n\n2. ROAS . Iordanes names \"Attila patre genitus Munduzco\" and his \"germani Octar et Roas\", recording that they held the kingdom before Attila .\n\n3. MUNDUZCO . Iordanes names \"Attila patre genitus Munduzco\" and his \"germani Octar et Roas\", recording that they held the kingdom before Attila . Munduzco had [three] children:\n\na) [REVA . The Gesta Hungarorum names \"Reuwa et Buda\" as brothers of \"ducis Ethela Bendacuz filius de genere Erd oriundi\" , although no brother of Attila with a name similar to Reva is referred to in the earlier sources so far consulted.]\n\nb) BLEDA (-murdered 445). The Chronicle of Marcellinus records that \"Bleda et Attila fratres\" raided Illyria and Thrace in 442 . Iordanes names \"Bleda germano [Attilæ]\", specifying that he was killed by his brother . The Gesta Hungarorum names \"Reuwa et Buda\" as brothers of \"ducis Ethela Bendacuz filius de genere Erd oriundi\" , the name \"Buda\" presumably being based on \"Bleda\". The Chronicle of Marcellinus records that \"Bleda rex Hunnorum\" was killed by \"Attilæ fratris sui\" in 445 .\n\nc) ATTILA (-453). Iordanes names \"Attila patre genitus Munduzco\" . The Gesta Hungarorum names \"ducis Ethela Bendacuz filius de genere Erd oriundi\" as one of the four leaders of the \"Huni in Scitia\" . The Chronicle of Marcellinus records that \"Bleda et Attila fratres\" raided Illyria and Thrace in 442 . Paulus Diaconus records that \"rex Hunnorum Attila cum fratre Bleba\" ruled a kingdom \"intra Pannonias Daciamque\" and devastated \"Macedoniam Misiamque et Achaiam utrasque etiam Tracias\", in a later passage recounting his attack on the kingdom of Burgundy . Iordanes records that Attila unsuccessfully proposed marriage to \"Honoriam Valentiniani principis germanam, filiam Placidiæ Augustæ\" . The exploits of Attila are also fully recorded in later chronicles such as that of Sigebert of Gembloux, who states that he died of apoplexy on his wedding night in 455 . This is based on the account of Iordanes who names \"Ildico\" as Attila's new bride . Attila had [five] children:\n\ni) ELLAC (-killed in battle ). Iordanes records that \"filius Attilæ maior natu Ellac\" was killed in battle .\n\nii) HERNAC . Iordanes names \"Hernac iunior Attilæ filius\" when recording that he was assigned to \"extrema minoris Scythiæ sedes\" . Sigebert of Gembloux records that \"Hernac filius eius\" succeeded his father in 455 .\n\niii) DINTZIC . Iordanes names \"Dintzic filius Attilæ\", recording that he ruled in \"inferiorum Pannoniam\" . Sigebert of Gembloux records that \"Dintzich filius Attilæ Hunorum rex\" was defeated by the Ostrogoths in 460 .\n\niv) [CSABA . The Gesta Hungarorum names \"Chabam regis Ethelæ filium ex Grecorum imperatoris filia Honorii\" when recording that he was favoured by some Hun factions to succeed his father, was forced to flee to Greece after the Huns were defeated, but returned to Scythia . This reflects Iordanes who records that \"Hernac iunior Attilæ filius\" was assigned to \"extrema minoris Scythiæ sedes\" . The Gesta Hungarorum records that \"Chabam regis Ethelæ filium\" was treated with scorn in Scythia and therefore married a wife \"de gente Corosmina\" and was ancestor of \"generatio Abæ\" .] [Csaba had two children]:\n\n(a) [EDEMEN . The Gesta Hungarorum names \"Edemen et Ed\" as the sons of \"Chaba filius Ethelæ\", when recording that Edemen entered Pannonia, his mother being \"de Corosminis orta\" .]\n\n(b) [ED . The Gesta Hungarorum names \"Edemen et Ed\" as the sons of \"Chaba filius Ethelæ\", when recording that Ed remained in Scythia while his brother went to Pannonia .]\n\nv) [ALADAR . The Gesta Hungarorum names \"Aladarium [regis Ethelæ filium] ex Cremildi Germaniæ principissa\" when recording that he was favoured by some Hun factions to succeed his father .]\n\nChapter 3. KINGS of the LOMBARDS in PANNONIA [510]-572\n\nThe Langobards (more commonly known as Lombards) were another nomadic people who installed themselves in what is now Hungary. The Istoria Longobardorum states that their name derives from \"langeth\" (long) and \"bardozab\" (beard) in their own language . The first historically attested homeland of the \"Langobardi\" was in the lower Elbe valley in northern Germany . They migrated south-eastwards, probably along the valley of the River Elbe, towards Bohemia, where the first Lombard king Agelmund, son of Agio, was elected . The precise nature of this \"election\" process is not known. King Agelmund was killed in a Hunnic assault on a Lombard settlement, although his successor King Lamissio is recorded as having achieved a notable victory against the Huns . The onward migration of the Lombards continued in the late 5th century into Moravia, where they displaced the Heruls who had been the allies of the Ostrogoths of Italy, and into Pannonia (north-west Hungary) in the 520s.\n\nAfter the Byzantines finally defeated the Ostrogoths in Italy in 552, imperial forces retook control of the whole peninsula as far as the Alps. Their position was, however, weak, especially after Emperor Justin II forced the retirement of the veteran governor Narses who, it is alleged, invited the Lombards to migrate en masse from Pannonia into Italy from his new base in Naples . The migration is dated to 568/69, maybe involving around 150,000 persons, although it is not known whether the exodus involved a complete abandonment of the Lombard settlements in Pannonia .\n\nA later manuscript of the Origo Gentis Langobardorum names the first five kings of the Lombards \"primus Agelmud genere Guingus, secundus Lamicho, tertius Leth, quartus Fildehoc filius Let, quintus Godehoc\" The Istoria Longobardorum assigns lengths of their reigns to the last four of these rulers as follows: \"Lamisio\" 22 years, \"Lecheth\" 40 years, \"Gildoeth filius Lothoth\" 24 years, \"Geldeoth\" 16 years . The historical value of the information from these two sources is dubious. An idea of the chronology is given by a manuscript based on the Pauli Historia, which states that during the time of \"Godeoc\" the ruler in Italy was Odovacer, who is recorded in other sources as reigning from approximately 476 to 493 .\n\nIt appears that the Lombards were formed into clans, probably named after early leaders. The sources name four such clans:\n\nLethings. The Origo Gentis Langobardorum specifies that King Wacho and his family were \"Lethinges\" , presumably descendants of King Leth, the third ruler named above.\n\nGausus. Ancestors of King Audouin, who is stated in the Historia Langobardorum to be \"ex genere Gausus\" .\n\nCaupus. A late manuscript of the Origo Gentis Langobardorum records that King Ariowalt, who ruled in Italy from 625 to 636, was \"ex genere Caupus\" .\n\nArodus. The Origo Gentis Langobardorum states that King Rothari, who ruled in Italy from 636 to 652, was \"ex genere Arodus\" .\n\nThe Lombard kings until the accession of King Alboin in 560 are recorded below. For later Lombard rulers, see the document ITALY, EMPERORS and KINGS.\n\nKLEPH, son of [GODEOC] . A later manuscript of the Origo Gentis Langobardorum names \"Claffo filius Godeoc\" as sixth king of the Lombards . The Istoria Longobardorum assigns a reign of 28 years to \"Graffo filius Geldeoth\" . Kleph had two children:\n\n1. TATO . A later manuscript of the Origo Gentis Langobardorum names \"Tato filius Cleffoni\" as seventh king of the Lombards . Tato had one child:\n\na) HILDECHIS . Paulus Diaconus records that Wacho defeated \"Hildechis filius Tatonis\" .\n\n2. ZUCHILO [Unichis] . Paulus Diaconus names \"germani sui [Tatonis] Zuchilonis\" when recording the accession of his son Wacho . Zuchilo had one child:\n\na) WACHO (-540) . From the Lething clan. The Origo Gentis Langobardorum names \"Wacho filius Unichis\", specifying in a later passage that they were \"Lethinges\" . A later manuscript of the Origo names him \"Wacho, filius Unichis, nepos Tatoni\" . He deposed King Tato in [510], defeated his son Hildechis, and installed himself as WACHO King of the Lombards. Paulus Diaconus names \"Wacho filius germani sui [Tatonis] Zuchilonis\", recording that he fought \"Hildechis filius Tatonis\" . The Historia Langobardorum records that Wacho killed \"Tattone rege barbane suo cum Vinsilane\" and succeeded as king, defeating \"Heldechis filio Tattoni\" who fled \"ad Gibidos\" and died . He consolidated his position, and the integration of his tribe as they moved into Pannonia, by his three marriages with daughters of three competing chiefs. m firstly RANIGUNDA [Raicunda], daughter of FISUD [Pisen] King of Thuringia. The Origo Gentis Langobardorum names \"Raicundam filia Fisud regis Turingorum\" as King Wacho's first wife .

Paulus Diaconus names the three wives of Wacho \"primam Ranicundam, filiam Regis Turingorum Austrigosam, filiam regis Gepidorum tertiam Herulorum regis filiam Salingam\" . King Wacho & his second wife had two daughters:\n\ni) WISIGARDIS (-[541/42]) . The Origo Gentis Langobardorum names \"Wisigarda secundæ Walderada\" as the two daughters of Wacho & his second wife, specifying that Wisigarda married \"Theudiperti regis Francorum\" . Paulus Diaconus names \"Wisigarda [et] secunda Walderada\" as the two daughters of King Wacho & his second wife, specifying that Wisigarda married \"Theodeperto regi Francorum\" . m ([540]) as his second wife, THEODEBERT I King of the Franks, son of THEODERIC I King of the Franks & his first wife --- ([499/504]-end 547).\n\nii) WALDRADA . The Origo Gentis Langobardorum names \"Wisigarda secundæ Walderada\" as the two daughters of Wacho & his second wife, specifying that Waldrada married \"Scusuald regis Francorum\" and later \"Garipald\" . The Historia Langobardorum names \"Waldrada\" as Wacho's second daughter by his second wife, specifying that she married \"Chusubald rex Francorum\" . Paulus Diaconus names \"Wisigarda [et] secunda Walderada\" as the two daughters of King Wacho & his second wife, specifying that Walderada married \"Cusupald alio regi Francorum\" and later \"Garipald\" . Gregory of Tours names Vuldetrada as the wife of King Theodebald . Herimannus names \"Wanderadam\" wife of \"Theodpaldus rex Francorum\" when recording her second marriage to \"Lotharius rex patris eius Theodeberti patruus\" . According to Gregory of Tours, King Clotaire \"began to have intercourse\" with the widow of King Theodebald, before \"the bishops complained and he handed her over to Garivald Duke of Bavaria\" , which does not imply that King Clotaire married Waldrada. m firstly ([554]) THEODEBALD I King of the Franks, son of THEODEBERT I King of the Franks & his first wife Deoteria ([534]-555). [m secondly (555, repudiated) as his fifth wife, CHLOTHACHAR I [Clotaire] King of the Franks, son of CHLODOVECH King of the Franks & his second wife Chrotechildis of Burgundy ([501/02]-Soissons [30 Nov/31 Dec] 561, bur Soissons, basilique Saint-Médard).] m [secondly/thirdly] (after 555) GARIBALD, son of ---. He became Duke of Bavaria in 590.\n\nWacho & his third wife had one child:\n\niii) WALTARI (-547). Paulus Diaconus names \"Waltari\" as the son of King Wacho & his third wife, specifying that he reigned for seven years after his father . The Origo Gentis Langobardorum names \"Waltari\" as the son of Wacho & his third wife, specifying that he succeeded his father and reigned seven years . He was installed as WALTHARI King of the Lombards in [540] in succession to King Waccho.\n\n[---] . King of the Pissa.\n\nm MENIA ---. The Historia Langobardorum names \"mater Audoin Menia uxor fuit Pissæ regis\" . This wording suggests that \"Pissæ regis\" was not the father of Audoin, presumably Menia's second husband. It is assumed that \"Pissæ\" indicates that he was king of a tribe of that name.\n\n[Pissa] & his wife had one child:\n\n1. AUDOIN (-in Pannonia 560). The Historia Langobardorum names \"Audoin ex genere Gausus\" and his mother \"Menia uxor Pissæ regis\" . He was installed as AUDOIN King of the Lombards in Hungary in [547] in succession to King Walthari. The Origo Gentis Langobardorum records that \"Auduin\" reigned after Walthari, specifying that he brought the Lombards into Pannonia and, in a later passage, stating that they remained in Pannonia for 43 years . Byzantium encouraged the Lombards to consolidate their position in Pannonia by granting them the city of Noricum and other strongholds, although it is reported that they celebrated by raiding Dalmatia and Illyricum . The war with the Gepids, which started in [547], was settled by a peace treaty imposed by Emperor Justinian in 552, under which the Lombards sent troops to Italy to help Narses rout the Ostrogoths . The Historia Langobardorum records that Audoin died in Pannonia . m firstly RODELINDA [Roddenda], daughter of ---. The Origo Gentis Langobardorum names \"Roddenda\" as mother of \"Albuin filius [Auduini]\" . The Historia Langobardorum names \"Rodelenda\" as mother of Alboin . Paulus Diaconus names \"Rodelindam\" as wife of Audoin and mother of Alboin . m secondly --- of the Thuringians, daughter of HERMINAFRID King of the Thuringians & his wife Amalaberga the Ostrogoth. Procopius records that \"Amalafridus, vir Gotthus, ex filia nepos Amalafridæ sororis Theoderici Gotthorum regis et filius Hermenefridi regis Thoringorum sororem eius married \"Anduino Langobardorum regi\" . The Codex Theodosianus records that the daughter of Amalaberga became the second wife of King Audoin . King Audoin & his first wife had [two] children:\n\na) ALBOIN (-murdered 28 Jun 572) . The Origo Gentis Langobardorum names \"Albuin\" as son of \"Auduin\" . Paulus Diaconus names \"Alboin, filius Audoin\" when recording his succession . He succeeded in 560 as ALBOIN King of the Lombards in Pannonia. He was crowned ALBOIN King of the Lombards in Italy at Milan in [570].\n\n- KINGS of ITALY.\n\nb) [---. m ---.] One child:\n\ni) GISULF . Shield-bearer of Alboin King of the Lombards, who installed him as duke in the region of Friuli after the Longobard migration into Italy in [569] . Paulus Diaconus records that King Alboin installed \"Gisulfum suum nepotem\" as \"ducem [in] Foroiulanæ civitati\" . The Chronicle of Andreas Bergomatis records that Alboin conceded Friuli to \"nepoti sui Gisolfi\" . The precise relationship between Gisulf and King Alboin is unknown and may have been more remote than implied by \"nephew\" if the word nepos if translated strictly in these passages.\n\n- DUKES of FRIULIA.\n\nChapter 4. LEADERS of PANNONIAN CROATIA\n\nLittle factual information has been found in the primary sources so far consulted about the Avar Khaganate, installed in Pannonia from the late 6th century and centred on the Tisza river. The Croatians were one of the vassal tribes of the Avars. Charles I King of the Franks (later Emperor Charlemagne) launched his first campaign against the Avars in 791, followed by a second in 795-96. The Annales Fuldenses record that \"Ehericum ducem Foroiuliensem, deinde Pippinum filium regis\" captured the camp of \"Hunorum Hringum\" in 796, specifying that \"Cagan et Iugurro principibus Hunorum\" were killed by their own people . King Charles eliminated the independent Avar state, although a small khaganate continued to exist until at least 822 as a vassal of the Franks. The Franks were overlords of territory as far east as the Tisza River, which included the Croatian principality in Pannonia . Under the Treaty of Verdun 11 Aug 843, which settled the disputes between the sons of Emperor Louis I, Pannonian Croatia was assigned to the kingdom of the East Franks ruled by King Ludwig II \"der Deutsche\" . The expansion of the new Magyar state of Hungary represented a threat to Pannonian Croatia, which requested help from Tomislav Duke of Dalmatian Croatia who defeated the Magyars. In the early 900s, he established a lasting border along the Drava River, shook off Frankish suzerainty and annexed what remained of Pannonian Croatia , the territories later evolving into the kingdom of Croatia. The little information that has been identified about the leaders of Pannonian Croatia is set out below. See the document CROATIA, for the leaders of Dalmatian Croatia and the dukes, later kings, of Croatia.\n\n1. VOJNOMIR . Leader of the Croatians of Pannonia and Slavonia. He supported the Frankish campaigns against the Avars, accepting Frankish overlordship in the 790s. The Franks placed the Croatians of Pannonia under the Marchesi of Friulia .\n\n1. LJUDEVIT (-murdered [823]). He succeeded as Prince of Pannonian Croatia in [810], with his main residence at Sisak. Einhard's Annales name \"Liudewiti ducis Pannoniæ inferioris\" in 818 . Einhard's Annales record that \"Liudewitus\" sent legates to the emperor in 819 . He revolted against the Franks in 819 , the uprising starting at Kranj. Einhard's Annales record a meeting at Aachen in 820 in which the rebellion of \"Liudewiti\" was discussed, \"Borna\" being the leader of the legates . Thegan records the imperial army´s campaign adversus orientales Sclavos, quorum dux...Liduit in the year after the emperor´s second marriage, so in 820 . The Royal Frankish Annals record that he was forced to flee to Serbia in 822 . The Vita Hludowici Imperatoris records that \"Baldrico\" expelled \"Liudovitus\", who had defeated \"Bornæ Dalmatiæ ducis\" . He defeated Borna Prince of Dalmatian Croatia, but sought refuge with Borna's successor, only to be murdered there soon after . m ---, daughter of DRAGOMOSUS. Dragomosus is named as father-in-law of Ljudevit in the Royal Frankish Annals, when recording the death of the latter in 819 after defecting to support Borna . Einhard's Annales also record that in 819 \"Borna dux Dalmatiæ\" fought \"Liudewito\" at \"Colapium fluvium\", that \"Draganosus socer Liudewiti\" was killed in the battle, and that Borna married his widow .\n\nChapter 5. MAGYAR PRINCES of HUNGARY from [900], KINGS of HUNGARY 1000-1301 (ARPÁD)\n\nThe origin of the Magyar people in the area north of the Black Sea is discussed in the Introduction to the present document. The Gesta Hungarorum records that \"Hunni sive Hungari\" divided into seven armies, each having 30,000 warriors and a single commander, naming \"Arpad \" as the most powerful of the commanders and the first to enter Pannonia . The Gesta names the other six commanders:\n\n\"Zobole [Szabolcs]\", leader of the second army who settled \"ubi Chakwara\" which \"now stands in ruins\", ancestor of \"generatio Chak [Csák]\" . According to Europäische Stammtafeln , he was related to Álmos, although the precise relationship is not shown.\n\n\"Iula\", commander of the third army who settled \"in partibus Erdevelu [Transylvania]\" .\n\n\"Vrs [Örs]\", leader of the fourth army who settled \"circa flumen Soio [Sajó]\" .\n\n\"Cund [Künd]\", leader of the fifth army who settled \"circa Nyr [Nyírség region]\" and his sons \"Cudis [Küsid] et Cupian [Kaplony]\" .\n\n\"Lel [Lél/Lehel]\", leader of the sixth army who first lived \"circa Golgocha [Galgóc/Hlohovec]\" and later \"in partibus Nitriæ [Nitra]\" after \"Messianis [Moravians] et Boemis [Bohemians]\" were eliminated, and was ancestor of \"Zuard [Zovárd] oritur tribus\" .\n\n\"Werbulchu dux [Vérbulcsu]\", leader of the seventh army who settled \"in Zala circa Lacum Boloton [Lake Balaton ]\" .\n\nThe commentary in the edition of the Gesta which was consulted states that Gyula and Künd [Kende] were the titles of dignitaries rather than names . The Gestis Hungarorum Liber gives a different version of these six other Magyar commanders :\n\n\"Eleud pater Zobolsu\", ancestor of \"genus Saac\".\n\n\"Cunda pater Curzan\".\n\n\"Ound pater Ete\", ancestors of \"genus Calan et Colsoy\".\n\n\"Tosu pater Lelu\".\n\n\"Huba\", ancestor of \"genus Zemera\".\n\n\"Tuhutum pater Horca\", whose sons were \"Gyyla et Zombor\" ancestors of \"genus Moglout\".\n\nWhile there are similarities between the two versions, the differences underline the semi-legendary nature of these descriptions of the early Magyars and the fruitlessness of attempting to reconcile them.\n\nHungarian raids on western Europe from Pannonia were frequent and devastating over the course of the next half century. The Gesta Hungarorum records raids by the Magyars (although the text does not give them this name) into Moravia and Bohemia (where they killed \"Waratizlao\" in battle), Carinthia (where they killed \"Meraniæ dux Gotfridus duxque Eburhardus\"), Bulgaria, Lombardy (where they murdered Liutward bishop of Vercelli), and Saxony, Thuringia, Swabia and eastern France and Burgundy . Western sources also record these early 10th century Magyar raids, for example Regino notes the death in battle of Liutpold dux of Bavaria in 907 against the Hungarians . The Magyars continued to inflict major damage during their raids on western Europe, although they were defeated by Heinrich \"the Fowler\" King of Germany at Riade near Merseburg in 933. The continuator of Regino dates their attack on the monastery of Fulda (with raids on Swabia, Thuringia and Saxony) to 915, another attack on Swabia, Alsace and Lotharingia to 917, a raid on \"orientalium Franciam\" to 924, another attack on France, Alsace and Swabia to 926, a battle at Worms to 932, an attack on Saxony to 938, a raid into Bavaria and Carinthia (with a battle \"in loco Weles\") to 944, and a last attack into France and Italy to 954 . Magyar raids as far as eastern France are corroborated by the Casus Sancti Galli which names \"in Alsatiam Luitfrido\" (Graf im Sundgau - see the document ALSACE) as in \"terræ illius potentissimo\" when recording that Alsace was devastated by \"Ungri\" . Although the passage is undated, it precedes text which names \"Burgundionum rex Chuonradus, adolescens floridus\" which suggests that it should be dated to the late 930s/early 940s. The first major setback for the Magyars was their defeat at the battle of Augsburg, 10 Aug 955, by Otto I King of Germany where, according to the Gesta Hungarorum, \"Lel et Bulchu\" were the Hungarian commanders who were later captured at Regensburg and hanged . The defeat at Augsburg in 955 is also recorded by Thietmar .\n\nIf the Gesta is to be believed, Magyar raids on western Europe continued after Augsburg, as a subsequent attack on the monastery of Fulda is recorded, followed by the laying waste of Swabia, an attack on France and the plundering of Susa and Turin . However, it is assumed that these are the same events which are recorded at earlier dates, as noted above, in the continuator of Regino . Regino records no further Magyar raids after 954 before the chronicle ends in 967. The Gesta Hungarorum names \"Tocsun\" as leader of a Hungarian raid into Greece and Bulgaria, recorded after the defeat at Augsburg, but states that this was their last raid \"while living as pagans\" . In conclusion, it is likely that major Magyar raids on western Europe ceased after their defeat at Augsburg, which marked the start of their more settled existence in Hungary.\n\nA. ORIGINS\n\nThe relationships between the first members of this family, as set out in this Part A, appear speculative. They are as shown in Europäische Stammtafeln . The sources on which this information is based are unlikely to be historically reliable.\n\n[Two possible brothers]:\n\n1. [UGEK [Ügyek] .

As leader of part of the Magyar armies, he crossed the Verecke and other passes in 895 into the fields of the Carpathian basin . The Gestis Hungarorum Liber records that \"Arpad dux\" invaded \"terram inter Thisciam et Budrug usque ad Ugosam\" and besieged \"castrum Borsoa\" .

According to Europäische Stammtafeln , Adelajda was the daughter not sister of Mieszko I Prince of Poland, although the primary source on which this is based has not yet been identified. If this is correct, she was an otherwise unrecorded daughter by his first wife (name not known), assuming that Prince Mieszko's marriage to Dobroslawa of Bohemia is correctly dated to 965. Adelajda's birth date range is estimated from the supposed dates of birth of her two sons by her first husband (before his death in [976/78]) and of her three known daughters by her second marriage after [985]. The birth date range appears chronologically more consistent with her having been the daughter, rather than sister, of Mieszko, but this would be in direct contradiction to the sources quoted below. If she was Mieszko's sister, it is likely that they did not share the same mother, assuming that the estimated birth dates of Mieszko and Adelajda are both accurate. After her first husband died, she married secondly ([980]) her husband's older brother Prince Géza, a marriage which may have been arranged in accordance with the Magyar tradition that the oldest male relative should marry the widow of a deceased relative and take care of his children.

He sent ambassadors to the court of Emperor Otto I, with whom he established friendly relations. Géza was baptised in 974 as ISTVÁN [Stephen] by priests sent by Pilgrim Bishop of Passau, although he appears to have adopted Christianity more for political expediency than religious conviction as he never renounced his pagan beliefs entirely, declaring himself, according to Macartney, \"rich enough to afford two gods\" (although this alleged quote may represent an inaccurate report of comments by Thietmar, see below) . He continued to use his pre-baptismal name Géza. He centralised Magyar government, based at Esztergom, where his bodyguard consisted of Bavarian knights. The alliance with Bavaria was confirmed after the accession in 985 of Duke Heinrich II, and sealed by the marriage of Duke Heinrich's daughter to Géza's heir in 996 . Thietmar names \"Deuvix\" as father of King István, describing him as \"very cruel when becoming a Christian he turned his rage against his reluctant subjects [and] sacrificed both to the omnipotent God and to various false gods.

Her origin is suggested by her supposed son Günther the monk being shown as nepos of István King of Hungary in Europäische Stammtafeln . According to the late 11th century Vita Guntheri, Günther was (less precisely) \"Stephani regis Ungarorum, ipsius venerabilis viri cognati\" . According to Kosztolnyik , it was after visiting the court of King István that Günther decided to become a hermit, which seems to exclude the possibility that his mother was the king's sister. It should be remembered that the early 11th century witnessed an influx of foreign monks into Hungary, invited to convert the population to Christianity, a process which may have been favoured by creating propaganda about supposed relationships between these foreigners and the king. m (shortly before 985) [SIZZO] Graf in Thuringia & his wife ---.]\n\n3. daughter ([973]-after 988) .

Comes palatii [Palatine] of King István in 1001. Shaba & his wife had one known child:\n\na) ABA (-murdered Feldebrö [Jul/Aug] 1044, bur Sáros Abbey) . His ancestry is indicated by the Gestis Hungarorum Liber which records that \"dux Arpad\" gave large territories to \"Edunec et Edumernec\" in \"silva Matra\", where \"Pota nepos eorum\" later built a castle, and that \"rex Samuel qui pro sua pietate Oba vocabatur\" was descended from him . He was baptised SÁMUEL. He succeeded in 1041 as SÁMUEL King of Hungary, after deposing his first cousin King Péter. The Chronicon Posoniense records that \"Petrus rex\" was expelled in 1041 and replaced by \"Abba\" . The Annalium Hildesheimensium records that King Péter was expelled and fled to Heinrich III King of Germany, while the Hungarians chose \"Ovonem\" as king . The Gesta Hungarorum names \"comitem Aba, sororium sancti regis Stephani\" when recording that he was installed as king after the first deposition of King Péter . A violent man, he was, like his predecessor, faced with internal opposition. In 1044, troops from Emperor Heinrich III invaded Hungary and defeated King Sámuel at Ménfö near Györ 5 Jul 1044. The Chronicon Posoniense records that \"Abba rex\" was killed in 1044 and that \"Petrus rex\" was restored . The Gesta Hungarorum records that ex-king Péter \"cum Henrico cæsare\" marched against King Aba in the third year of his reign, the latter counter-attacking against Austria and Carinthia . The Gesta records that the Germans invaded Hungary and defeated King Aba at Ménfő, after which the king fled towards the river Tisza and was strangled \"in an old storeroom\" .

Her parentage is confirmed by Herimannus who names \"Petrum, sororis suæ [=Stephanus Ungariorum rex] filium, de Venetia natum\" when recording his accession in 1038 . Chronology suggests that she was the daughter of Prince Géza's second marriage but the primary source which confirms that this is correct has not yet been identified. Her marriage is confirmed by the Gesta Hungarorum which names \"Petrum Venetum filium sororis suæ cuius pater dux fuerat Venetorum\" as successor to King István . As Pietro Orseolo was Doge from 1009 to the early 1020s, he is the only possible Venetian ruler to whom this can relate. Andrea Dandulo´s Chronicon Venetum records the marriage \"Otto Ursiolo dux\" and \"filiam Geyzæ regis Hungarorum et sororem Stephani\", dated to 1009 from the context . m (1009) PIETRO OTTONE Orseolo, son of PIETRO Orseolo II Doge of Venice & his wife Maria --- ([989]-Constantinople 1031).\n\n- see below (after the descendants of King István I).\n\n7.

The Gesta Hungarorum records the birth in 967 of \"Geicha dux [filium] regem Stephanum\" . The sources are contradictory regarding the identity of his mother. The Gestis Hungarorum Liber names \"una Caroldu et altera Saroltu\" as the two daughters of \"Geula\", specifying that the Sarolt was mother of \"sancti regis Stephani\" . On the other hand, the Annales Kamenzenses record that \"Mesco rex Polanorum sororem Atleydem\" married \"Iesse rex Ungarie\" by whom she was mother of \"Stephanum regem Ungarie\" , and the Breve chronicon Silesiæ names \"Adilheidem\" as sister of \"primo dux Mesco\", adding that she married \"Jesse rex Ungarie\" and that she was the mother of \"Stephanum regem Ungarie\" . Both these Polish sources record the birth of István in 975, which is more consistent with his having been the son of his father´s first marriage. It is possible that the Hungarian source is more accurate, as the Polish sources may have misrepresented the facts in order to fabricate what could have been seen as a prestigious family relationship between the Polish kings and the first king of Hungary. Thietmar names \"Waik brother-in-law of Duke Heinrich of the Bavarians\" . He was baptised as ISTVÁN [Stephen]. He succeeded his father in 997 as Prince of Hungary. His succession was challenged on grounds of seniority by his older cousin Koppány, whose rebellion was suppressed at Veszprem in 998 with the help of Bavarian cavalry . Prince István received a royal crown from Pope Sylvester II and was crowned ISTVÁN I King of Hungary 25 Dec 1000 or 1 Jan 1001. He was also granted an apostolic cross, symbolic of the status and authority of the Hungarian church which was responsible to the Pope alone . Rodulfus Glaber records that King István encouraged pilgrims to Jerusalem to cross Hungary rather than travel by sea, making \"the road safe for everyone\" . \"Stephanus Ungrorum Rex\" founded the monastery of St Martin \"in monte supra Pannoniam sito\" by charter dated 1001 . His army attacked his supposed maternal uncle Gyula Prince in Transylvania in 1002 and incorporated Transylvania into his domains . \"Stephanus Hungarorum Rex\" donated property to the church of St Emeram \"in castro nostro Nitra\" by charter dated to 1006 . \"Stephanus Hungarorum Rex\" donated property to the church of St Michael, Veszprém by charter dated 1009 . \"Stephanus Hungarorum Rex\" founded the church of St Adrian, Zala by charter dated 1019, and donated further property by charter dated 1024 . His authority was challenged unsuccessfully in south-eastern Hungary by Ohtum [Ajtony], maybe a Khazar prince. King István confirmed the privileged 'freeman' status of the descendants of the original Magyar conquerors who, in return for providing military support, were exempt from taxes other than church tithes . He reformed the Magyar legal system, enacting many new laws particularly relating to ecclesiastical matters. The first Hungarian constitution is dated to 1030 . He was the author of a Book of Exhortations [Intelmek könyve] to his son, the first known Hungarian literary work, which emphasises the ecclesiastical basis for the king's authority . \"Stephanus Ungarorum Rex\" donated property to the church of St Maurice, Bakonbél by charter dated 1037 . The necrology of Tegernsee records the death \"XVIII Kal Sep\" of \"Stephanus rex Ungarorum\" . The Chronicon Posoniense records the death in 1038 of \"Stephanus rex\" . According to the Gesta Hungarorum, he died in the 46th year of his reign and was buried in \"Albæ [Székesfehérvár] in ecclesia Beatæ Virginis\" . He was canonised in 1083 by the Catholic church (Szent István), his feast-day being 4 Nov.\n\nm (996) GISELA of Bavaria, daughter of HEINRICH II \"der Zänker\" Duke of Bavaria and Carinthia [Germany] & his wife Gisela of Burgundy ([985]-Passau 7 May 1065, bur Passau Kloster Niedernburg). Herimannus names \"Gisela, huius soror [=Heinricus imperator]\" as wife of \"Stephano regi Ungariorum\" . The Annalista Saxo states that \"mater ipsius [Stephanus Ungariorum rex] Gisla\" was sister of \"Heinrici inperatoris Babenbergensis\", when recording her husband's death , but clearly the text misstates \"mater\" for \"uxor\". This marriage was agreed by Gisela's brother Duke Heinrich IV and István's father to confirm the Hungarian/Bavarian alliance . According to the legends of St Stephen, she founded Veszprém Cathedral and the convent of Veszprémvölgy . The Gesta Hungarorum records that \"Kysla regina\" sent \"comitem Sebus\" to blind Vazúl, whom her husband wished to appoint as his successor after the death of their son Imre, and have moulten lead poured into his ears . Bak suggests that Queen Gisela was blamed because of anti-German feeling in the Hungarian court . According to another Hungarian chronicle, Queen Gisela took council from \"an evil man named Buda\" concerning her husband's plan to name his nephew Vazúl as his heir and sent Buda's son Egiruth to do the deed . After her husband died, she was robbed of her possessions by her husband's successor and left Hungary, becoming abbess of Niedernburg.\n\nKing István & his wife had [five] children:\n\n1. [OTTO (-young). Daniel Cornides quotes the theologian Pelbartus, writing in the second half of the 15th century, who names \"Otto\" as one of the sons of King István I in a sermon recounting the king´s life . Cornides comments that \"filiorum natu maximum fuisse Ottonem, probabile est\", adding that he would have been named after Emperor Otto III. It is not known what earlier primary sources might have been available to Pelbartus, which have since disappeared. However, no primary source has been found which names Otto and, only on the basis of Pelbartus, the evidence for his existence is slight.]\n\n2. IMRE [Heinrich] ([1007]-killed Bihar 2 Nov 1031) . The Gesta Hungarorum records that \"rex Stephanus\" had several sons of whom \"Emricum\" stood out . The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines names \"Hemericum\" as the only son of \"sanctus rex de Ungaria Stephanus primus\", specifying that he died before his father . The Annales Hildesheimenses name \"Heinricus, Stephani regis filius, dux Ruizorum\" when recording his death . The Gesta Hungarorum records that \"rege Stephano\" wished to renounce his crown in favour of \"Emrico duci suo filio\" but was prevented from doing so by the latter's early death . He was killed by a wild boar while hunting. The Chronicon Posoniense records the death in 1031 of \"Henricus filius Stephani regis\" . The Altahense Annales record the death in 1033 of \"Heinricus filius Stephani Regis Ungarie\" . He was canonised together with his father (Szent Imre). [m --- (-after 1031). Sources are contradictory regarding the possible marriage of Imre. According to Europäische Stammtafeln , she was --- Argyre, daughter of Emperor Romanos III. Kosztolnyik refers to (unnamed) Byzantine sources which record the Byzantine marriage of Imre , suggesting that \"the terminology of the Greek text of the founding charter of the monastery for women at Veszprém\" supports the position . It is not clear whether these sources specify that she was a member of the Argyre family, but this appears unlikely to be correct. If Prince Imre did marry a Byzantine princess, the marriage may have been arranged by Emperor Basileios II. Although Romanos Argyros (later Emperor Romanos III) held office during the later years of the emperor's reign (he was city prefect of Constantinople), the absence of detailed information in Greek primary sources about the Argyros family suggests that it was not at that time especially prominent among the noble families of the empire. If that is correct, a member of the Argyros family would seem a surprising choice as bride for the heir to the Hungarian throne. This difficulty would not arise if the marriage took place after the accession of Emperor Romanos in 1028. If this Byzantine marriage is correct, it is possible that her father-in-law founded the Greek monastery in Veszprém valley for his son's wife . An alternative possibility is that Imre's wife was --- of Poland, daughter of Mieszko II Lambert King of Poland & his wife Richeza [Ezzonen], as the Annales Sanctæ Crucis Polonici record that \"Stephanus rex filium Emrich\" married \"Meszkone rege Polonie filiam\" . However, this report in the Annales may have been due to confusion with the marriage of another of King Miesko's daughters, reported in the Gesta Hungarorum as having married the future Béla I King of Hungary while he was in exile in Poland . It does not appear likely that King István's political relations with Poland would have been sufficiently close for him to have arranged a Polish marriage for his heir. The king's main political alliance was with Germany, whose relations with Poland were tense during the reigns of Emperor Heinrich II and Emperor Konrad II. A third possibility is provided by the Chronicle of Joannes Archidiaconus Goricensis which suggests that Imre was not married at all when he died, recording that \"sancto Stephano\" betrothed \"Emerici ducis Sclavoniæ\" to \"filia Cresimiri\" but that the future bridegroom died the following year . His betrothed would have been --- of Croatia, daughter of Kreimir III King of Croatia & his wife ---.]\n\n3. [BERNÁT . Daniel Cornides quotes the 16th century scholar Pierre Pithou´s edition of a work entitled \"Annalium et Historiæ Francorum ab anno Christi 708 ad annum 990\" which names \"Bernardum\" as the son of \"Giselam uxorem Stephani regis Hungrorum\", but adds that he was the father of \"Idam Nammucensem, et reginam Francorum, et uxorem Angilberti Marchionis, et Gertrudem comitissam Flandriensem, et reginam Nacorum\" . This is pure fantasy, and it is assumed that the \"Annalium et Historiæ Francorum\" was spurious, maybe a production of the same Pithou. If this is the only evidence for the existence of Bernhard, son of King István I, he can be dismissed completely.]\n\n4. [HEDVIG . According to the early 12th century Vita Eberhardi , the mother of Eberhard Graf von Nellenburg (son of Eberhard IV Graf im Zürichgau) was a daughter of István I King of Hungary, although it is somewhat surprising that such a prominent figure as King István, in far off Hungary, would have married his daughter to an obscure Swiss count. The Annales Scafhusenses record the marriage in 1009 of \"Ebbo comes de Nellenburc\" and \"consobrinam Heinrici regis Hedewigam de curie regis\" . If \"consobrinam\" is here used in its precise sense, Hedwig would have been the daughter of one of the sisters of Gisela, daughter of Conrad I King of Upper Burgundy. Hedvig founded Kloster Pfaffenschwabenheim as a widow . If she was the daughter of King István, there is a remote possibility that she was the same daughter who supposedly married Edmund ætheling (see below), although if this is correct she would have been much older than her second husband. This supposed Hungarian origin appears unlikely, given Hedwigs property holding in Rheingau mentioned in the following document: Comes Eberhardus cum domina Hadewiga matre sua founded Kloster Pfaffen-Schwabenheim bei Kreuznach with his mothers property im Rheingau by charter dated 1034 . m (1009) EBERHARD [IV] Graf im Zürichgau, son of [MANGOLD [I] Graf im Zürichgau & his wife ---] (-[1030/34]).]\n\n5. [daughter . Daniel Cornides quotes Belæ Regis Notarius, writing in the late 12th/early 13th century, who names \"Sunad, filius Dobuka, nepos regis [Sancti Regis Stephani]\" when recording that he killed \"Ohtum in castro suo juxta Morisium\" . Cornides, in his commentary, assumes that \"Dobuka\" was the daughter of King István I, on the basis that \"nepos\" in this passage should be translated as grandson. A fuller extract of the passage in question, in English translation, records that \"Ajtony [Ohtum]\", a descendant of one of the original Magyar chiefs, was killed \"at the time of the holy King Stephen\" by \"Csanád [Sunad], son of Doboka [Dobuca] and nephew of the king in his castle beside the Maros because he was rebellious to the king in all his doings\" , showing that the events reported took place during the lifetime of King István. From a chronological point of view, it is unlikely that a grandson of King István would have been adult and active while the king was still alive. It is therefore assumed that \"nepos\" indicates a more remote relationship, probably even more remote than \"nephew\". In any case, it is far from clear that \"Dobuka\" was a feminine name and was the mother of Csanád. It would be highly unusual in a source of this type for a protagonist to be identified by the name of his mother rather than his father. In addition, it can be seen from the names of the early Magyar leaders (see above) that a terminal \"a\" does not necessarily signify a feminine name. It therefore appears more likely that \"Dobuka/Doboka\" was the name of the father of Csanád, which of course means that it is even less likely that he was King István´s grandson given that the king was succeeded by his nephew. This whole discussion of course assumes that the passage in question is factually correct. This is far from certain, given the nature of the Gesta Hungarorum written by the anonymous notary of King Béla, which Macartney described as \"the most famous, the most obscure, the most exasperating and most misleading of all the early Hungarian texts\" . m DOBOKA, son of ---.]\n\nPossible relative of the kings of Hungary, precise relationship not known:\n\n1. [HEDVIG of Hungary. Ailred Abbot of Rievaulx records that \"Edmundo\", son of \"regem Edmundum\" [King Edmund \"Ironsides\"], married \"Hungariorum regem filiam suam\" . Geoffrey Gaimar recounts that \"Edgar\" (older of the two children of King Edmund whom he names incorrectly in an earlier passage) made \"la fille al rei [de Hungrie]\" pregnant, was married to her and appointed heir by her father, but adding confusingly that they were parents of \"Margarete\" who married \"rei Malcolom\" . The basis for this story, and whether there is any element of truth hidden in it somewhere, is unknown. Edmund's wife is named Hedwig in Burke's Guide to the Royal Family , although the primary source on which this is based has not been identified. In the absence of further information, the accuracy of these reports must be considered dubious as none of the Hungarian kings during the first half of the 11th century provides an obvious match. In the case of King István, it is likely that all his daughters predeceased their father in view of the accession of his nephew, King Péter, when he died. In any case, his daughters would have been beyond child-bearing age when the ætheling Edmund arrived in Hungary, assuming this arrival took place in [1046] as is probable. As the ætheling brothers were closely linked to King András I, it is unlikely that Edmund would have married a daughter of either of his disgraced predecessors King Péter or King Samuel Aba, and any daughters of the former at least would have been too young for such a marriage. Finally, any daughters of King András himself would certainly have been too young for the marriage. There is therefore considerable doubt about the historical authenticity of this Hungarian princess or her marriage to Edmund. m EDMUND of England, son of EDMUND \"Ironsides\" King of England & his wife Ældgyth --- (1016-before 1054).]\n\n--- of Hungary, daughter of GÉZA Prince of Hungary & his second wife Adelajda of Poland ([989]-1026) . Her parentage is confirmed by Herimannus who names \"Petrum, sororis suæ [=Stephanus Ungariorum rex] filium, de Venetia natum\" when recording his accession in 1038 . Chronology suggests that she was the daughter of Prince Géza's second marriage but the primary source which confirms this has not so far been identified. Her marriage is confirmed by the Gesta Hungarorum which names \"Petrum Venetum filium sororis suæ cuius pater dux fuerat Venetorum\" as successor to King István . As Pietro Orseolo was Doge from 1009 to the early 1020s, he is the only possible Venetian ruler to whom this can relate. Andrea Dandulo´s Chronicon Venetum records the marriage \"Otto Ursiolo dux\" and \"filiam Geyzæ regis Hungarorum et sororem Stephani\", dated to 1009 from the context .\n\nm (1009) PIETRO OTTONE Orseolo, son of PIETRO Orseolo II Doge of Venice & his wife Maria --- ([989]-Constantinople 1031). Named \"OTTONE\" at his confirmation at Verona 996, after his sponsor Emperor Otto III. His father associated him with the Dogeship after the death of his older brother Giovanni. He was elected Doge of Venice in 1009 in succession to his father. Unpopular in Venice for aggrandizing his family, he was forced to flee the city for Istria in [1022/23], but was recalled by the Venetians after the sacking of Grado by Poppo von Treffen Patriarch of Aquileia. Following further scandals over church appointments, he was deposed as Doge in 1026 and sent to Constantinople.\n\nPietro Orseolo & his wife had two children:\n\n1. PIETRO Orseolo ([Venice] [1010/15]- Székesfehérvár [30 Aug] [1060], bur Pécs, St Peter's Cathedral) . Herimannus names \"Petrum, sororis suæ [=Stephanus Ungariorum rex] filium, de Venetia natum\" when recording his accession in 1038 . His maternal uncle declared him as heir to the throne of Hungary in 1037. He succeeded in 1038 as PÉTER King of Hungary. According to the Gesta Hungarorum, \"regina Kysla consilio iniquorum\" installed \"Petrum Venetum filium sororis suæ cuius pater dux fuerat Venetorum\" as king after her husband's death . The Gesta states that King Péter treated \"the nobles with contempt and [devoured] the wealth of the land with a proud eye and an insatiable heart and behaved with shameful and unbridled lust and that he was deposed in the third year of his reign\" in favour of \"comitem Aba, sororium sancti regis Stephani\" . The Chronicon Posoniense records that \"Petrus rex\" was expelled in 1041 and replaced by \"Abba\" . The Annalium Hildesheimensium records that King Péter was expelled and fled to Heinrich III King of Germany, while the Hungarians chose \"Ovonem\" as king . King Péter was restored in 1044 with the help of the German king, whose troops invaded Hungary and defeated King Sámuel at Ménfö near Györ. The Gesta records that the Germans invaded Hungary and defeated King Aba at Ménfő, after which the latter fled towards the river Tisza and was strangled \"in an old storeroom\" . The Chronicon Posoniense records that \"Abba rex\" was killed in 1044 and that \"Petrus rex\" was restored . King Peter was obliged to swear allegiance to King Heinrich in 1045 which, combined with the arrival of increasing numbers of foreign advisers, did nothing to improve his popularity. The Gesta Hungarorum records a national revolt against King Péter after the return to Hungary of his cousins András and Levante, the slaughter of \"Teutonicos et Latinos præpositi et abates\" (implying that the revolt may have been pagan inspired), King Péter's flight to Moson, his arrest at a village near Székesfehérvár, his having survived being blinded, and his burial at Pécs . The Chronicon Posoniense records that \"Petrus rex\" was blinded in 1047 and succeeded by \"Andreas rex\" . The Annales Altahenses record the rebellion against King Péter and his being blinded . According to the Hildesheim Annals, he was expelled from the country after he was blinded . The Annales Magdeburgenses also record the expulsion of \"Petrus Ungarariorum rex\" after being captured and blinded . The Annales Capituli Cracoviensis record the death of \"Petrus rex Hungarie\" in 1060 . The necrology of Regensburg St Emmeran records the death \"III Kal Sep\" of \"Petrus Ungariorum rex\" but does not mention the year . It is hard to be certain about the year of King Péter's death. It does not appear, from the sources cited above, that he succumbed when he was blinded, although the Annales Altahenses are silent on the point. Apart from the report of his death in the Annales Cracoviensis, the only subsequent reference to ex-king Péter is the Annalista Saxo's record of his second marriage (see below) which, if correct, must have taken place after Jan 1055. The difficulty is the record of his burial in Hungary contained in the Gesta. Burial in his home country is consistent with his death soon after being blinded. It is difficult to imagine the authorities having arranged his body's repatriation for burial in Hungary after years of ignominious exile. m [firstly] TUTA [von Formbach, daughter of HEINRICH [Hesso] I Graf & his wife Himiltrud ---] (-14 Mar [after 1070]). \"Tuta von Formbach\" is shown as the wife of Péter King of Hungary in Europäische Stammtafeln . No primary source has been identified which indicates either the marriage of King Péter to \"Tuta\" or Tuta's parentage. As shown below, there are late references to a \"Queen Tuta\" having founded the monastery of Suben (near Schärding in Upper Austria), one of which states that she was \"queen of Hungary\". No primary source has been found which links \"Queen Tuta\" with Tuta, joint founder of Vornbach monastery together with her sister Himiltrud, whose father \"Hesso\" is assessed by Wegener to have been the same person as Heinrich [I] [von Formbach]. Wegener says that \"Queen Tuta\" was the second wife of Béla I King of Hungary, the marriage having taken place after the death of his first wife which he dates to \"after 1052\" (Europäische Stammtafeln suggests that King Béla's first wife died \"after 1059\" ). He bases his argument on connections with the monastery of Suben founded in 1040. He explains that Archbishop Eberhard (von Sulzbach) names \"Tuta\" (in a document dated 1153, more than a century after the events) as \"die Gründerin von Suben, Königin\", and that in an even later document from the monastery she is called \"Königin von Ungarn\", although it cannot be concluded from these documents that she was queen at the date she founded the monastery. He then highlights a connection between possible descendants of King Béla's daughter Sophia (by her first husband Ulrich Marchese of Istria) and the same monastery which, he suggests, indicates that Sophia was the daughter of \"Queen Tuta\". The chronology of his argument is shaky as Sophia must have been born before [1050], when King Béla's known Polish wife appears still to have been alive. Who, then, was \"Queen Tuta\" and who was her husband? The existence of a \"Queen Tuta\" is confirmed by the necrology of Regensburg Monastery which records the death \"IV Non Feb\" of \"Tuta regina\" , although this gives no indication of the country involved or the date of her death. Assuming that Tuta was queen of Hungary, and that she lived during the mid-11th century, her possible husbands are King Péter, King Sámuel Aba, King András I and King Béla I. The last-named is unlikely, as shown above. His brother and predecessor, King András, is recorded as having married a Russian princess. This leaves King Sámuel and King Péter. Nothing is known of the wife of the former, but considering his probable date of birth it is likely that he was married before his accession in 1041, in which case his wife was most likely a Hungarian noblewoman. This leaves King Péter, a possibility which Wegener apparently ignores. There appears no factual basis for the speculation that \"Queen Tuta\" was the wife of King Péter, although the necrology of Regensburg St Emmeran which records her death also includes a reference to the death \"III Kal Sep\" of \"Petrus Ungariorum rex\" . An alternative explanation for the Suben connection would be that Sophia was the daughter of King Péter and Tuta. However, contemporary political realities suggest that a prominent marriage for a daughter of the disgraced King Péter is unlikely. Until more information comes to light, it is safer to assume that Sophia was the daughter of King Béla and [Ryksa] of Poland, that another (so far unidentified) factor explains the apparent connection between Tuta and Sophia through Suben monastery, and that Tuta was the wife of King Péter. This last conclusion suggests that it is even less likely that Tuta's parentage was as suggested in Europäische Stammtafeln. If the marriage took place before Péter's accession, it is difficult to explain why the son of an ex-Doge of Venice (his father had been deposed in 1026) would marry the daughter of an obscure Bavarian noble. If the marriage occurred after Péter became king, it seems likely that his supporters would have been able to arrange a more prominent marriage for their new ruler, particular as his sister was married to the Markgraf of Austria soon after his accession. In any case, as explained in the document BAVARIAN NOBILITY, proof that Heinrich [I] [von Formbach] had a daughter named Tuta seems shaky. It depends on the interpretation of two documents, the first of which is the Codex Traditionum of Formbach monastery which records a donation by \"domna Himildrudis filia Hessonis\" , and the second the same source which records a dispute with Suben monastery and names \"due sorores Touta et Himildrud nobilissimis\" . The basis for assuming that \"Hesso\" is the same person as \"Heinrich [I]\" is unclear. No primary source has been identified which throws light on the year of Tuta's death. Assuming that her husband's second marriage as shown below is correct, Tuta must have died many years before the \"after 1070\" which is suggested by Europäische Stammtafeln . m [secondly] (Apr 1055) as her second husband, JUDITH von Schweinfurt, widow of BŘETISLAV I Duke of the Bohemians, daughter of HEINRICH von Schweinfurt Markgraf auf dem Nordgau & his wife Gerberga [von Gleisberg] ([1010/15]-2 Aug 1058, bur Prague St Veit). According to the Annalista Saxo, Judith was expelled from Bohemia by her son Duke Spytihnĕv after his father's death and married \"Petri regi Ungariorum\" to spite her son . The marriage is not mentioned in Wegener, although he refers cryptically to \"Lui von Frizberg, I. Tuta Regina. II. Judith von Schweinfurt\" .\n\n2. FROIZZA [Frowila] Orseolo ([1015]-17 Feb 1071, bur Melk) . Herimannus refers to \"sororis suæ [=Peterum regem]\" as wife of \"marchionem nostrum Adalbertum\" when recording her marriage in 1041 . She is named in three imperial charters, although these are not consistent about the spelling of her name. \"Heinricus Romanorum imperator augustus\" granted property \"in circuitu duorum fluminum Zaiouua\" to \"marchioni Adalberto et coniugi suæ (Froiza)\" by charter dated 21 Apr 1048 . \"Heinricus Romanorum imperator augustus\" granted property to \"Adelberti marchionis [et] uxorique sue Froize\" dated 12 Nov 1051\" . \"Heinricus rex\" granted property \"in locis Ortvvinesdorf et Pirchehe in marcha Osterriche et in comitatu Ernestes marchionis\" to \"Frovvilæ Adeberti marhchionis viduæ\" by charter dated 1 Oct 1058 . The necrology of Melk records the death \"XIII Kal Mar\" of \"Frouza marchionissa\" . The necrology of Kloster Neuburg records the death \"XIII Kal Mar\" of \"Fruoza marchionissa\" . m (shortly before 1041) as his second wife, ADALBERT \"der Siegreiche\" Markgraf der Ostmark [of Austria], son of LUITPOLD I Markgraf der bayerischen Ostmark, Graf im Traungau, Sundergau und Donaugau & his wife Richwara im Sualafeldgau (-26 May 1055, bur Stift Melk).\n\nVÁSZOLY [Vazúl], son of MIHÁLY of Hungary Duke between March and Gran & his wife Adelajda of Poland ([976/78]-early 1037) . The Gesta Hungarorum names \"Wazul et Zar Ladislaum\" as the sons of \"Mihal frater Geichæ\" . The Chronicon Varadiense names \"ducem Vazul et ducem Ladislaum calvum\" as the two sons of \"Michael dux\" . The Kronika Węgiersko-Polska names \"Stephanum, Mychl et Vanzul\" as the three sons of \"Geyza\", adding that \"Vanzul\" was killed by \"effosionem oculorem\" by \"reginam Gesla, consortem regis sancti Stephani\" . Duke between March and Gran. Representing the more conservative, traditional element of Hungarian society, he rebelled against King István I and his Catholic pro-western policies . The Gesta Hungarorum records that, after the death of his son Imre, \"rege Stephano\" sent messengers to bring \"Wazul filium sui patruelis\" from his prison at \"Nistriæ\" to have him declared successor to the kingdom but that \"Kysla regina\" sent \"comitem Sebus\" to blind Vazúl and have moulten lead poured into his ears, after which Vazúl fled to Bohemia from where he was brought back to Hungary . Bak dates this event to 1037, although this appears late if the events happened soon after Imre's death in 1031 .\n\nm (before [1012]) --- [of Bulgaria], daughter of [SAMUIL Tsar of the Bulgarians & his wife Agatha Chryselie].
