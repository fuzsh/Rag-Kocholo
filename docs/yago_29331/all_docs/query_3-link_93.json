        "text": "Boleslaus II the Pious (c. 940 – February 7, 999), a member of the Přemyslid Dynasty, was Duke of Bohemia from 972 until his death.\n\nLife and reign\n\nBoleslaus was an elder son of Duke Boleslaus I the Cruel (brother of Duke Wenceslaus I) and brother of the three other children of his father who survived to adulthood: Strachkvas, Doubravka (the wife of Duke Mieszko I of Poland) and the abbess Mlada. His mother may have been Biagota, a mysterious figure known only from her coins. According to some historians, she was the wife of Boleslaus I.\n\nBoleslaus II took over the rule of the Duchy of Bohemia as kníže (a title that may be translated either as duke or prince) on his father’s death in 972. Like his father, Boleslaus II initially quarrelled with the Ottonian Kings of East Francia. In 974, he and Duke Mieszko I of Poland supported the rebellious Duke Heinrich II of Bavaria in his civil war against the rule of Emperor Otto II.\n\nIn 976, Heinrich II of Bavaria was defeated and fled to Boleslaus’ court at Prague Castle, after which Emperor Otto II’s forces campaigned in the Bohemian lands. Finally in 978, Boleslaus solemnly pledged allegiance to the emperor at the Easter festivities in Quedlinburg.\n\nIn turn, relations with Poland deteriorated from about 980 onwards. When Emperor Otto II died in 983 and was succeeded by his minor son Emperor Otto III, the Bohemian alliance with Poland was discarded, as Boleslaus again allied with the insurgent Bavarian Duke Heinrich II, while Mieszko I took the side of the young king.\n\nMoreover, when Boleslaus occupied the Saxon Margravate of Meissen, he thwarted the plans of Mieszko’s son Bolesław, who had married a daughter of Margrave Ricdag. In 987, Boleslaus had to retire from Meissen, and from about 990, he sparked a long-lasting conflict with Poland around the lands of Silesia and Lesser Poland (the Polish-Bohemian War). In 992, he approached Emperor Otto III and participated in an unsuccessful campaign against the Lutici tribes in the wake of the Great Slav Rising of 983.\n\nUnification of the Bohemian lands\n\nBohemian lands during the reign of Boleslaus I and Boleslaus II\n\nBoleslaus’s reign is most notable for the foundation of the Diocese of Prague in 973, which earned him the epithet “The Pious” by the medieval chronicler Cosmas of Prague. Nevertheless, the Bohemian diocese was placed at that time within the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Mainz, and Emperor Otto II enforced the appointment of the Saxon monk Thietmar (Dětmar) as first bishop.\n\nMeanwhile, the struggle with the rival Slavník dynasty flared up again from 981 onwards, when Prince Soběslav of the Slavník dynasty began to forge alliances with the Polish and Saxons. Upon Bishop Dětmar’s death in 982, Soběslav’s brother Adalbert (later known as Saint Adalbert of Prague) was appointed his successor until he abandoned his primacy to lead a mission to the Old Prussians in 994.\n\nOn September 28, 995, Boleslaus’ forces and the confederate Vršovci clan stormed Libice Castle in southern Bohemia and massacred the members of the Slavník dynasty that were found there. Boleslaus’s brutal triumph ensured the unity of Bohemia under a single ruler.\n\nMarriages and issue\n\nBoleslaus’s first wife Adiva may have been a daughter of the English king Edward the Elder (the daughter known to English historians as “Ælfgifu” who married a prince “near the Alps”), though the evidence for this is weak.\n\nHis second wife was Emma of Mělník. It is certain that Boleslaus’s oldest son was born by Adiva, but the mother of the others cannot be established with certainty.\n\nBefore I address the title “King of the Romans”, I will do a brief and simple summary of the information thus far.\n\nIn 800CE Charlemagne, King of the Franks, was crowned “Emperor of the Romans” by Pope Leo III on Christmas Day. This Empire, which was to be a restart of the old Roman Empire, is known as the Carolingian Empire. When Emperor Charlemagne died in 814 he left this Empire fully intact to his son Louis the Pious.\n\nHowever, upon Louis’s death in 840CE he divided the empire amongst his three surviving sons. After a brief Civil War and the signing of the Treaty of Verdun in 843, the third son of Louis the Pious, known as Louis the German’ inherited the eastern portion of the Empire, logically known as the Kingdom of East Francia.\n\nAfter the Carolingian Dynasty died out the Kingdom of East Francia, an elective monarchy, became the possession of the Dukes of Saxony. When King Otto I of East Francia who was also crowned Emperor of the Romans by Pope John XII 962 we see a transition from a Frankish Kingdom into a Germanic Kingdom and from there the title of the Kingdom transition to King of the Germans or also called Kingdom of Germany.\n\nThe transition from a Kingdom of the Franks to a Kingdom of the Germans was not immediate and it took time. Any firm distinction between the kingdoms of Eastern Francia and the Kingdom of Germany is to some extent the product of later retrospection and historiography.\n\nIt is impossible to base this distinction on primary sources, as the name Eastern Francia for the kingdom remained in use long after the name Kingdom of Germany came into use.\n\nThe actual title of the monarch did vary over time. During the Ottonian period, it was King of the Franks (Rex Francorum), from the late Salian period it was King of the Romans (Rex Romanorum).\n\nThe last of the Ottonian Kings of East Francia to use a different title began with the reign of Emperor Heinrich II (1002–1024) onward. Before assuming the throne Heinrich II was known as Heinrich III, Duke of Bavaria.\n\nIn 1001, Emperor Otto III experienced a revolt against his reign in Italy. The Emperor sent word for Heinrich III, Duke of Bavaria to join him with reinforcements from Germany, but then died unexpectedly in January 1002. Otto was only 21 at the time of his death and had left no children and no instructions for the Imperial succession. In the Ottonian dynasty, succession to the throne had belonged to the Saxon branch, not the Bavarian line of which Heinrch III was a member.\n\nAs the funeral procession of Emperor Otto III moved through the Duchy of Bavaria in February 1002, Heinrich met the procession to legitimize his claims, and Heinrich demanded Archbishop Heribert of Cologne give him the Imperial Regalia. The Archbishop refused. Heinrich imprisoned the Archbishop and his brother the Bishop of Würzburg.\n\nWith neither the symbols of imperial authority, the crown jewels, nor the cooperation of Heribert, Heinrich was unable to convince the nobles attending Otto III’s funeral procession to elect him as king. A few weeks later, at Otto III’s funeral in Aachen Cathedral, Henry again attempted to gain the support of the kingdom’s nobles and was again rejected.\n\nSo it was without the support of the kingdom’s nobility that Heinrich took the radical action of having himself anointed and crowned “King of Germany” or to be more accurate “Rex Romanorum” (King of the Romans) by Willigis, Archbishop of Mainz on July 9, 1002 at Mainz.\n\nHeinrich’s action marked the first time a German king was not crowned in Aachen Cathedral since Emperor Otto I began the tradition in 936 and the first time a German king assumed the throne without election by the German nobility. Under the regal name of “King Heinrich II”, he appeared before the Saxons in mid-July in full regal apparel. There, Henry convinced Bernard I, Duke of Saxony, to support his claims to the throne.\n\nNotice Heinrich II, as King, took the title “Rex Romanorum” (King of the Romans) rather than “Rex Teutonicum” (King of Germany). This begins the tradition of taking the title King of the Romans until he could secure his Papal coronation as Emperor.\n\nTherefore, the title King of the Romans was from that point forward used by the King of Germany following his election by the princes from within the Empire, until he was crowned Emperor by the Pope.\n\nKing Heinrich II would have to wait 12 years for that to occur.\n\nThere was a great upheaval within the Roman Catholic Church as rival Popes fought for supremacy. I will not go into detail about this at this point.\n\nFleeing across the Alps to Germany, Pope Benedict VIII appealed to King Heinrich II for protection. Heinrich II agreed to restore Benedict VIII to his papal throne in return for his coronation as Emperor.\n\nHeinrich II arrived in Rome in early 1014, restoring Benedict VIII as pope. On February 14, 1014, Pope Benedict VIII crowned King Heinrich II as Holy Roman Emperor (“Romanorum Imperator”) in St. Peter’s Basilica.\n\nMore on the title King of the Romans in my next entry."
