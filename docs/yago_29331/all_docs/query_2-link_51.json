Also Odon apparently hoped to enlarge his domains, perhaps even so far as to obtain the Duchy of Greater Poland by force. His uncle Casimir II the Just, offered him only Poznan. Odon pursued the war against his father until 1178, when Mieszko III was forced to abdicate and flee.\n\nIn 1181 Miesko III returned to the country and with the aid of the Pomeranians, regained the control over Greater Poland and Poznan from his son Odon. One year later, was made an agreement between father and son: Odon received a little portion of Greater Poland south of the river Obra (however, some historians believed that he remained in the Greater Poland capital until his own death). After Odons younger brother Mieszko the Younger died on 2 August 1193, Odon obtained the Duchy of Kalisz, with the consent of his father.\n\nLittle is known about Odon's government over Kalisz. However, he founded a mint, and coins have been found bearing the inscription \"Odon Dux\" (\"Duke Odon\"), suggesting a high degree of autonomy.\n\nOdon died on 20 August 1194 and was buried in the Cathedral of Poznan.\n\n[edit] Marriage and issue\n\nAbout 1184[1] Odon married with Viacheslava (d. aft. 1200), daughter of Yaroslav Vladimirovich \"Osmomysl\", Prince of Halych.[2][3][4][5] They had four children:\n\n1.
