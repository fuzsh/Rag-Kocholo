        "text": "And that British politician I was talking about:\n\nDavid Miliband, Warsaw, 23 June 2009.\n\n\"Any British Foreign Secretary visiting Poland is deeply conscious of the history between our two countries.\n\nIt goes back a long way. Canute the half Polish King of Denmark who, in 1015, invaded England, bringing with him Polish soldiers and his mother, Princess Swietoslawa, who was buried in Winchester castle.\n\nThe Polish King, Casimir the Great, who in medieval times offered sanctuary to English Jews being persecuted in London and York.\n\nThe English and Scottish Protestants who sought and received refuge here in the 16th century and the Scottish Catholics who settled in Chelmno in the 17th century.\n\nYesterday, I flew here from Northolt, an RAF airbase on the outskirts of London. There, I passed the memorial to the Poles who fought for the Allies. Two hundred thousand Polish soldiers, air men and naval personnel fought on the Allied side in the Second World War. Amongst them the men who opened the door to Rome in May 1944 when they captured Monte Cassino; the crew of the Polish destroyer Blyskawica who helped defend Southampton from air raids; and the pilots who fought in the Battle of Britain. And the Polish mathematicians who broke the Enigma codes, unlocking the intelligence which gave the Allies the decisive advantage in many crucial battles.....\"\n\nThank you for this info.\n\nI still miss the original source – the quote from Lawson's book, which wiki mention, is not in the newest version of the book.\n\nI can't read Polish, but in the German summary I see, that he writes, that Gunhild (Svietoslava) went back to Poland and came to Denmark near the end of her life. And how did that happen? According to Danish/Scandinavian historians she was taken back to Denmark by Cnut (Knud) and his Brother Harold (Harald) &#8211; they went to Poland to get their mother ...\n\nShe escaped to Poland (Eric expelled her IIRC) and then she was taken back to Denmark near the end of her life, by her sons (Cnut and Harald).\n\nThat's what he writes in the Polish text.\n\nSo essentially the same as in German summary - but in summary with less details (he did not mention Cnut and Harald in summary).\n\n=========================\n\nOpen the PDF document, click CTRL + F and paste \"Wyrtgeorn\" - maybe he mentions this name somewhere?\n\nThere's obviously something wrong with his version of history.\n\nI can't read Polish, but in the German summary I see, that he writes, that Gunhild (Svietoslava) went back to Poland and came to Denmark near the end of her life. And how did that happen? According to Danish/Scandinavian historians she was taken back to Denmark by Cnut (Knud) and his Brother Harold (Harald) – they went to Poland to get their mother ...\n\nCnut's sister was married to (Burizleif) Wyrtgeorn rex Winidorium) in other words Boleslaw I Chrobry of Poland.\n\nObviously Rafal Prinke doesn't know, that Boleslaw is Wyrtgeorn?\n\nThe problem is that saga's seems to make one Polish ruler of two. I mean that Burizleif is both Mieszko I and his son Bolesław the Brave. It happend probably because Saga's were written in far Iceland, 200-300 years later.\n\nbut as far as I know, there have only be found viking weapons in Ostrow Lednicki (?)\n\nIt was already discussed in this thread.\n\nAxes found in Ostrów Lednicki (in total 159) were of local production and with use of local iron.\n\nSpears found in Ostrów Lednicki (in total 60), were of local production and with use of local iron.\n\nSwords found in Ostrów Lednicki (in total 7) were mostly from Rheinland - one of them was produced by swordmaker Ulfberht.\n\nNo evidence for Scandinavian weapons, apart from swords which could go from Rheinland to Scandinavia and then from there to Ostrów.\n\n=================================\n\nA documentary video about Ostrów Lednicki (in Polish):\n\nhttp://vod.tvp.pl/dokumenty/historia/wyspa-wladcow/wideo/wyspa-wladcow/8610807\n\nAround 00:32:10 of the video, starts the part about the weapon production centre, discovered in the suburbs of the stronghold.\n\nWeapons produced in that production centre, were produced with use locally extracted deposits of morass ore:\n\nCheck my post #50:\n\nhttp://historum.com/european-histor...tions-vikings-5.html#post1552852?postcount=50\n\nIt was already discussed in this thread.\n\nAxes found in Ostrów Lednicki (159 of them) were of local production - vast majority of them.\n\nSwords found in Ostrów Lednicki (in total 7) were mostly from Rheinland.\n\nSpears found in Ostrów Lednicki (in total 60), were of local production - vast majority of them.\n\nNo evidence for Scandinavian weapons, apart from swords which could go from Rheinland to Scandinavia and then from there to Ostrów.\n\n=================================\n\nA documentary video about Ostrów Lednicki (in Polish):\n\nvod.tvp.pl - Telewizja Polska S.A.\n\nAround 00:32:10 of the video, starts the part about the weapon production centre, discovered in the suburbs of the stronghold.\n\nIs it the same as this grave? near the village of Bodzia, roughly 90 miles (150 kilometers) northwest of Warsaw.\n\nhttp://news.nationalgeographic.com/...arrior-graves-polish-viking-treasure-science/"
