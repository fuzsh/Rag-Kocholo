It's a good question! If his/her bloodline endured, he/she can have millions of them!\n\nAnd if this person was extremely rich and powerful? There is a great chance that descendants were also rich and powerful. Genealogical researches proved that to this day Piast bloodline still exists. There are probably millions of their descendants, but they simply do not know about their royal ancestors!\n\nHow is it possible that you can be \"royal baby\"? It's simple - through all these years different people's blood was mixing, and the royal blood had been forgotten. Do you think that in your family somebody remember that your 28 x greatgrandparents were Mieszko I and Dobrava?\n\nGenealogists states that even 90% of nowadays Polish population has descent from Polish Kings. But these are only estimates and of course no one know for sure how many royal descendants lives in our times.\n\nYou can be one of them! We can help you find out! You just have to fill the form and in box with a question about Descent from Polish Kings you should write: YES.\n\nUNCOVER SECRET OF YOUR ROYAL ROOTS! (click here!)\n\nSHORT HISTORY OF PIAST FAMILY\n\nPiasts were family that first came to reign in Poland. First historical ruler was Mieszko I Piast. Some historians insist that his name is taken from legendary protoplast of this family Piast Kołodziej (Piast the Wheelwright).\n\nPiast Kołodziej’s father was, by the Gallus Anonymus, Chościsko.\n\nChościsko is old-slavic name that presumably derives from “chwost/chost” – a tail.\n\nPiast Kołodziej’s wife was Rzepicha. Piast’s son was Ziemowit (Siemowit). He had son named Lestek (Leszek). And Lestek’s son was Siemomysł (Ziemomysł).\n\nAnd here we come from semi-legendary rulers of Poland to concrete facts.\n\nSiemomysł’s son was Mieszko, duke of Poland. In 966 Mieszko was baptized and it put Poland in world of Western Christianity, because before it Poles were pagans.\n\nHe also married Princess Dobrava (Dubrava). She was from Czech dynasty of Přemyslid. Mieszko was great ruler, and he in fact started great prosperity of dynasty and Poland in history. Historians claim that he was a great politician and commander. He won in Battle of Cedynia in 972. He also allied with Czech. He is also famous for document DAGOME JUDEX, in which he deposits Poland under protection of Pope.\n\nMieszko’s son was Bolesław (Boleslaus) the Brave (CHROBRY), first crowned King of Poland.\n\nBolesław was crowned in 1025. He is famous for arrangement of St. Wojciech’s mission in pagan countries near Poland. After martyr’s Wojciech’s death in Prussia, Bolesław buried him in Cathedral in Poznań. In 1000 year Bolesław on famous Congress of Gniezno have as guest Emperor Otto III. Bolesław was Emperor’s friend and ally. Bolesław also organized military expedition to Kijów (Kiev) and he took Grody Czerwieńskie in 1017.\n\nBolesław’s successor was Mieszko II Lambert. He tried to continue his father’s political work, but he failed because of his brother, Bezprym. Bezdprym organized army and defeated Mieszko II. He reigned shortly, because Mieszko II returned to power, but he had to resign and he gave reign to his son Casimir (Kazimierz) the Restorer. Mieszko’s reign was unfortunate, because Poland lost a lot of lands and prestige in Europe builded by Mieszko’s ancestors. Mieszko’s wife was Richeza of Lotharingia.\n\n(See also: Bolesław II Forgotten – semi-legendar ruler between Mieszko II and Casimir the Restorer)\n\nCasimir’s nickname tells us all. His life wasn’t easy. His path to power was hard. He was put away to monastery where he was to become a monk, but after his father’s death he came out of it and started political actions. He gained reign with Emperor Henryk III’s help. And then he made alliance with Ruthenian Prince Yaroslav the Wise. His wife was Maria Dobroniega of Kiev. Casimir was talented politician and man of great wisdom, he united many lands that once was Polish. He is also known for moving capital to Kraków (Krakau).\n\nCasimir had son – Bolesław (Boleslaus) the Bold also known as Cruel. He loved wars – he fought with Czech and Ruthenia. He lost his power over Western Pomerania. He sentenced death to bishop Stanislaus, what was widely discussed in Europe. This act was reason for rebellion of nobility against Bolesław’s actions. Because of this he had to leave country and hand over reign.\n\nAfter Bolesław the Bold reigned his brother – Władysław I Herman. He came to power after rebellion and was very dependent upon Sieciech, very wealthy and powerful magnate. He married Judith of Czech to put in order relations between Poland and Czech. Władysław tried to regain Pomerania, but his efforts were in vain. Władysław had two sons: Bolesław III Wrymouth (Krzywousty) and Zbigniew. They, in cooperation, regained power and defeated Sieciech. He finally had to leave Poland.\n\nBrothers ruled Poland together, but Bolesław sought to gain Pomerania which caused an armed conflict between brothers, and forced Zbigniew to flee the country and seek military help from Germany. Bolesław stopped the intervention of the Emperor Henry V in 1109 and punished Zbigniew by blinding him. This action caused great turmoil even in countries of western Europe.\n\nBolesław Wrymouth was very cruel, but intelligent and powerful. Under his reign Poland regained power and made good alliances (especially with Hungary). Bolesław also christianized Pomerania. Bolesław is famous for his last will. It started very long period of Fragmentation of the Kingdom that lasted for 182 years. In this will Bolesław divided Kingdom into parts – each for one son. He thought it’ll be wise decision, because brothers won’t fight with each other. In fact it started a period of constant wars and conflicts between Bolesław’s sons.\n\nBolesław died in 1138 and then Fragmentation began.\n\nFragmentation was a period when there was no king, but dukes who ruled regions (Pomerania, Lesser Poland, Greater Poland, etc.)\n\nThere was one attempt to reunion these lands – made by Przemysł Piast – but he failed. Genealogy of this time is very complicated, because of many different lines of Piasts family reigning in many different places and because of constant changes, alliances and conflicts. This genealogy will be presented in other article.\n\nAfter 182 years Poland regained its shape after reunion that was done by Władysław Łokietek. He was crowned in 1320 in Kraków and this act ended Fragmentation of Kingdom. Władysław was son of Casimir of Kujawy and Eufrozine of Opole. He was very lucky, he reunited Poland because of deaths of his many relatives that reigned different Polish lands. We can say that he accomplished his great aim – to become King of Poland. He died in 1333 in Wawel, Kraków. His only son was Casimir the Great. He was wise and powerful, but unfortunately was also the last king from this dynasty. Although this family passed away in XVI century.\n\nCasimir the Gret was the last King of Poland from Piast dynasty. After him came Jagiellonian dynasty.\n\nHenryk Sienkiewicz's descent from Polish Kings"
