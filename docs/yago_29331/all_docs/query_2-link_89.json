        "text": "Background\n\nShe was the second daughter and fourth child of Mieszko III the Old, Duke of Greater Poland and since 1173 High Duke of Poland, by his first wife Elisabeth, daughter of King Béla II of Hungary.\n\nCareer\n\nAround 1167, Wierzchoslawa Ludmilla married with Frederick, Lord of Bitsch, second son of Duke Matthias I of Lorraine. Wierzchosława Ludmilla became the contact between the French and Polish artistic representatives. One of the theories about the building of the famous Gniezno Doors states that thanks to her efforts, around 1180 the Doors came to her father\"s court.\n\nThen Frederick became the Duke of Lorraine and Wierzchosława Ludmilla his duchess consort.\n\nHowever, their reign was short-lived: one year later, in 1206, Duke Frederick I died."
