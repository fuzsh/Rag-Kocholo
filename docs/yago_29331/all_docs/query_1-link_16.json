        "text": "Judith of Hungary (C. 1143 - 1201) was the eldest child of Ladislaus II of Hungary and Blanche of France. She was born in Hungary in 1143 as a Hungarian Princess, and she was named for her paternal great-great-grand-mother Judith of Carinthia. She was betrothed to the High-Duke of Poland when Judith was only 6, but after the High-Duke defeated the other Polish overlords, he declared himself King of Poland, when Judith turned 12, her mother sent Judith from Hungary, through Slovakia to Poland were Judith was married to the King of Poland (Bolesław IV of Poland) and crowned Queen, Bolesław was a faithful husband to his Queen, but he would from time to time would flirt with Judith's ladies in waiting. Judith bore Bolesław 3 daughters and 2 sons, the eldest son would be the son to succeed Bolesław, when Judith was in her late 30's, her husband died after a nobleman he demoted poisoned him, Judith's son Mieszko succeeded Bolesław and executed the noble who poisoned Bolesław. Judith's son became known as Mieszko \"The Old\" for his long reign, Judith died in Kraków in the company of her ladies-in-waiting. She was buried at Wawel Cathedral, next to her husband.\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nChildhood[]\n\nJudith of Hungary was born in Budapest as the eldest daughter of Ladislaus II of Hungary and Blanche of France. Blanche had one older brother when she was born named Géza of Hungary who was heir to the Hungarian empire, her birth was followed by a younger sister Maria of Hungary and then a younger brother named Andrew of Hungary. Judith was described by the German ambassador to Hungary as \"Tall, with dark hair that seems to look blue, though not the prettiest face you ever seen, she is graceful and pleasurable.\" Judith was educated by the French ambassador to Hungary and was educated in Art, History, dance, and archery, but also educated in the masculan skills of math, reading, writing and war.\n\nBetrothal[]\n\nJudith's father wanted to make an alliance with Poland, who was about to become a global superpower, the High Duke of Poland was 22 and still unmarried, mainly because the daughters of Poland's neighbors did not like men with beards, and the High Duke happened to have a beard, When Judith was 6 - 8 years old, Judith and her sister Maria were offered to the high Duke, the High Duke chose Judith over Maria who was later married to the King of Denmark, Judith and her future husband met in Venice where the Doge of Venice presented the couple with a feast, Judith learned Polish from the French ambassador, but she still feared she would mess up as future High-Duchess. When Judith was 10, her husband invaded all the neighboring Polish Micro-kingdom's and Duchies, and crowned himself King of Poland, when her parent's heard of the news, the started educated her on the way of a Queen Consort.\n\nMarriage[]\n\nWhen Judith was 11, the marriage was suppose to take place, but the Pope declared the 8th Crusade, and Judith of Hungary was old enough to fight in it even though she was a year under the age rate, but she got to fight because she was royal, but regular woman were expected to stay at home and there commoner husbands went on crusade. Judith wen't with her 14 year old brother and her parents to Hungary, she learned how to kill in battle and her brother took an oath to protect Judith, but Judith often complained he was to over protective because her brother Géza would not let her go to Jaffa which was the most dangerous place to go crusading. Judith and her brother left there parents to crusade in Antioch, and they traveled to Athens were Judith celebrated her 12th birthday, but her future husband happened to be there and married her in a private ceremony, when her parents heard this, they wanted to re-arrange the wedding, so Judith and her husband Bolesław would not have to be married in a battle field, Judith and her husband were remarried in Kraków, Poland.\n\nQueen of Poland[]\n\nFollowing her wedding in Kraków, Bolesław, she was crowned Queen of Poland, but 6 days after her coronation, there was still an 8th Crusade, so Judith and Bolesław wen't back on Crusade, 2 years into the 8th Crusade after Judith turned 14, she gave birth to a son on campagne to Jerusalem, her son Mieszko who was born in Antioch (being the first Polish King to be born there.) Was sent home with Judith while Bolesław wen't to Jerusalem. Judith was left regent of Poland though she was only 14, her father assisted her in ruling Poland as regent, when Judith was 16, her husband came back with some money he stole from weakened Turkish caphaites, he also came back to see his 3 year old son for the first time in 3 years. Judith gave birth a second time when she was 17, to Elisabeth of Poland who was the future Princess of Kiev. Judith was a popular Polish Queen for taking sides with Poland over her own home nation unlike many Queen's before. During the Polish-Hungarian debate over Slovakia, she sided with Poland stating \"Now I sou to be loyal to the land of Poland, I cannot betray by new country.\" At the end Poland and Hungary split Slovakia up, and they made a second alliance against the Turks.\n\n9th Crusade[]\n\nAfter the birth of Judith's 3rd child Catherine of Poland, the Pope declared the 9th Crusade during the council of Clermont, Judith and Bolesław prepared there armies in Warclów, Poland.

Judith and Bolesław wen't to Jaffa where they restored the Count of Jaffa and escaped Jerusalem for the Ottoman forces coming to Jaffa, with the help of Marie of Jerusalem, who was the youngest daughter of the late king Fulk II of Jerusalem. Judith wanted to crusade in Bulgaria, but Bulgaria was currently on fire at the time, and certainly Bolesław would not let his Queen go the a country on fire. Judith and Bolesław joined the famous and infamous \"Kings army\" which consisted of the King of France, Dublin, England, Hungary, Denmark, Armenia, Georgia, Jerusalem, Germany, Castile, Aragon, Léon, Portugal, Scotland, and Byzantine as an alliance against the expanding Ottoman Empire, Queen's were allowed, but they had to be accompanied by men in order to join the \"Kings army.\" Judith briefly met her older brother Géza and her father, but they wen't to Jerusalem, while Judith was going to Antioch with the rest of the King's army. The 9th crusade ended in a tie, with the Ottoman's taking over northern Cyprus, and the western forces being pushed back, it was a bad year for the crusaders of the 9th Crusade.\n\nThe King's Army[]\n\nDuring the 9th Crusade, Judith and her husband joined the \"Kings Army\" which was a fedoration of christian king's who joined forces against the expanding power of the Turks, Judith had the 7th seat in the king's army right after the King and Queen of Aragon, but before the King and Queen of Denmark, the seat's were organized from most powerful to least powerful, the most powerful sat in the front-middle of the room.

The Duke of Estonia offered 10,000 euros (Which is 7,000,000 euros today) for Litvus city along with an alliance between Estonia and Poland, but Judith and Bolesław were not about to give up Litvus city, after the birth of Judith 4th child Hedwig of Poland, Judith sent a letter to the Duke of Estonia declining the offer, the Duke of Estonia desprately wanted Litvus city to have a better trade rout to the Principality of Volhynia, so the Duke of Estonia declared war on Poland, a lot of kingdom's sided with Poland and aided the Polish king to defeat Estonia, the Kievan Rus' who were neighbor's to Poland sided with Poland and they made a marriage alliance with them, the Grand Prince's daughter Agnes of Kiev was betrothed to Mieszko of Poland (Who was heir to Poland.) when the 10th crusade was announced, Judith promised her husband that he could go on crusade while she fought in Estonia.

There waiting for you, don't make it easier for you My Lady!\" Judith insisted they go to Tallinn and marched without her top general sense he refused to march the army to Tallinn, other then executing him, she wanted to show Marck she was the better general, the Duke of Estonia's army was marching tword's Judith's army, as she closed her eyes while holding her horses harness, and ordered everyone to fire there arrows and swords, the Duke of Estonia ordered there army to fire at the Queen, a group of soldiers died protecting the Queen, Judith's father sent troops to Poland to serve in Judith's army.
