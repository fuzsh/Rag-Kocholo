        "text": "Pre History - Times of Legends and Dragons ( link to Legends Page )\n\nThis Page - Up To the World War l\n\nThe World Wars -\n\n966 - Mieszko l creates Kingdom of Poland adopting Catholicism as the state religion.\n\nMost of the peoples of these lands were pagan at this time - worsoping nature and the elements - trees , water, stones.\n\nEstablishment of the Polish Piast Dynasty - it's Kings ruled Poland until 1370 with the death of the Great King Kazimierz.\n\nMieszko is a diminutive of Mieczysław, a combination of two elements or lexemes: Miecz meaning sword and Sław meaning famous together meaning \"Sword of Fame\"\n\nThe early Kings of Poland were crowned in Gniezno near Poznan in the west.\n\n[The names of Polish Kings based on First Name and Numeric Sequence would often also include a characteristic desciption. Here are some examples\n\nBoleslaw l the Brave, Boleslaw ll the Bold, Boleslaw lll the Wrymouth, Boleslaw the Curly,\n\nHenryk the Bearded, Henryk the Pious, Henryk the White, Henryk Probus,\n\nKazimierz l the Restorer, Kazimierz the Just, Kazimierz the Great,\n\nWladyslaw the Exile, Wladyslaw Spindleshanks, Wladyslaw the Short.\n\nNot all Polish Kings had the full title of King Of Poland which went with a coronation ceremony, some lesser Kings had the title of Duke of Krakow]\n\n967 - 1025 Bolesław I the Brave or the Valiant (Polish: Bolesław I Chrobry )\n\nHe was the firstborn son of Mieszko I by his first wife, Dobrawa, daughter of Boleslav I the Cruel, Duke of Bohemia\n\nBolesław I was a remarkable politician, strategist and statesman. He was able to turn Poland into one of the largest and most powerful monarchies in eastern Europe.\n\nAt the time of his death Bolesław I left Poland larger than he inherited her, adding to its domains the long contested Germananic marches of Lusatia and Sorbian Meissen as well as Red Ruthenia and possibly Lesser Poland. Militarily, at the time, Poland was unquestioningly a considerable power as Bolesław I was able to fight successful campaigns against both Holy Roman Empire and the Kievan Russia.\n\nGiewont Mountain- Zakopane\n\nOrder of the Teutonic Knights of St. Mary's Hospital in Jerusalem \" Krzyzacy\"\n\nThey were the Germanic equivalent of the English and French \"Knights Templar\" formed during the crusades to aid Christians on their pilgrimages to the Holy Land and to establish hospitals to care for the sick and injured. Its members formed at the end of the 12th century in Acre, in the Orient, the medieval Order played an important role in Outremer (Holy Land), controlling the port tolls of Acre. After Christian forces were defeated in the Middle East, the Order moved to Transylvania in 1211 to help defend Hungary against the Cumans. They were expelled in 1225 after allegedly attempting to place themselves under Papal instead of Hungarian sovereignty and turned to Vienna.\n\nIn 1226 Konrad I of Masovia invited the Teutonic Knights to help him fight the masovian people and convert them to Catholicism and this extended to the pagans who lived in a territory adjacent to his lands; substantial border warfare was taking place and Konrad's province had suffered from Prussian invasions. The Teutonic Order quickly overstepped the authority and moved beyond the area granted them by Konrad (Chełmno Land or Kulmerland). In the following decades they conquered large areas along the Baltic Sea coast and established their own monastic state which would become identified as Prussia (Prusowie) When virtually all of the Western Baltic pagans became converted or exterminated (the Prussian conquests had been completed by 1283), the Knights turned their attention to conquering the rest of Poland and Lithuania, then the last major pagan state in Europe. Teutonic expansionist policy and wars with Poland and Lithuania continued for most of the 14th and 15th centuries. The Teutonic state in Prussia, populated by German settlers beginning in the 13th century, had been claimed as a fief and protected by the Popes and Holy Roman Emperors.\n\nYou will find on many pre WW2 maps of Poland a Prussian Germanic state in the heart of northern Poland all thanks to the invitation of the Baron Konrad 1. German rulers would continue to claim the right to occupy Polish lands from this point onwards.\n\nThe Great King Kazimierz is the only Polish king who both received and kept the title of Great in Polish history (Boleslaw I Chrobry is also called the Great, but his title Chrobry (Valiant) is now more common). When he received the crown, his hold on it was in danger, as even his neighbours did not recognise his title and instead called him \"king of Kraków\". The economy was ruined, and the country was depopulated and exhausted by war. Upon his death, he left a country doubled in size (mostly through the addition of land in today's Ukraine, then the Duchy of Halicz), prosperous, wealthy and with great prospects for the future. Although he is depicted as a peaceful king in children's books, he in fact waged many victorious wars and was readying for others just before he died.\n\nIn order to enlist the support of the nobility, especially the military help of pospolite ruszenie, Kazimierz was forced to give up important privileges to their caste, which made them finally clearly dominant over townsfolk (burghers or mieszczaństwo). This concession to the nobility ulitmately made the nobles more powerful than the monachy.\n\nKazimierz had no legal sons. Apparently he deemed his own descendants either unsuitable or too young to inherit. Thus In 1355 in Buda , and in order to provide a clear line of succession and avoid dynastic uncertainty, he arranged for his sister Elisabeth, Dowager Queen of Hungary, and her son Louis king of Hungary to be his successors in Poland.\n\nIn exchange to agreeing to this, the szlachta's tax burden was reduced and they would no longer be required to pay for military expeditions expenses outside Poland. Those important concessions would eventually lead to the ultimately crippling rise of the unique nobles' democracy in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.\n\nLouis was proclaimed king on Kazimierz's death in 1370, and Elisabeth held much of the real power until her death in 1380. Thus a regal connection with Hungary was established\n\n.\n\nSt. Jadwiga & Jagiello (1373 - 1424)\n\nstart of Jagiellon dynasty which would rule Poland for next 200 years\n\nPrinces Jadwiga was born in the year of Our Lord 1373, the third daughter of Louis of Hungary. King Louis was the nephew of the great King Casimir, and in 1370 he had claimed the rule of Poland as well, as Casimir's heir.\n\nWhen Louis died, in 1382, Jadwiga was only nine years old. Because the old king had no sons of his body, he directed that Hungary and Poland should each take one of his daughters and crown her 'king' of the country. Though originally Jadwiga had been destined for Hungary, the Hungarian nobles preferred her older sister, Maria, and the Polish nobles agreed to have Jadwiga as their ruler. (Under Polish customs, both boy and girl children inherit equally, and the king has the right to declare any of his relatives or descendants his heir-- as in the old days of the clans.) In this way, Poland remained separate from Hungary.\n\nQueen Jadwiga was crowned \"rex\", or King, of Poland in 1384. Alone in a strange country, Jadwiga soon found that she had many troubles to settle. The Teutonic Knights were attacking both Poland and Lithuania, hoping to recapture the lands they lost to Casimir; many of Casimir's other descendants were hoping to claim parts of Poland as well. And of course poor Poland was menaced as always from the West by the greedy Germanic states, from the East by the rulers of Muscovy, and from the South by the continuing threat of invasion by the savage Mongols and barbarian Cossack Tartars.\n\nIn these circumstances, the great Polish nobles told the little queen that she could not marry her betrothed, an Austrian prince, since they could not accept an Austrian on the throne. As an alternative, they offered the prince Jagiello, King of Lithuania. If she married Jagiello, he would convert to Christianity, and convert his nation. Not only would the joined might of Poland and Lithuania cow her enemies, but the Teutonic Knights would lose the support of the church for their attempts to conquer 'pagan' Lithuania, the excuse they used for invading Poland.\n\nThe Lithuanian King was baptized in February 1386, a few days before the marriage, and took the name \"Wladyslaw\". Wladyslaw and Jadwiga were married on February 18, and the Lithuanian was crowned king of Poland in March, in the city of Krakow.\n\nJadwiga ruled jointly with the king, traveling on diplomatic missions, negotiating with German, Muscovite, and Italian princes of the Church, helping to establish the church in Lithuania, and establishing seats of learning. In fact, though the nobles had elected Wladyslaw as their king, they looked to Jadwiga as their true king as long as she lived. The young queen sponsored the refounding of the university at Krakow, the oldest in eastern Europe, naming it the Jagiellonian University, and making it a beacon of learning in law and theology; she also founded a college for Lithuanians in Prague. Churchmen remember her efforts in the founding of the bishopric of Wilno.\n\nBut God willed that the beloved Queen was not to live a long life among her children; On June 22, 1399 aged 26 Jadwiga gave birth to a daughter, Elizabeth Bonifacia. Within a month, both the girl and her mother had died from birth complications. They were buried together in Wawel Cathedral. Jadwiga's death undermined Jogaila's position as King of Poland, but he managed to retain the throne until his death 35 years later. Though king Wladyslaw, now sole ruler of Poland and Lithuania, remarried and had a son to succeed him, it is said that he never forgot his young queen, and it is true that her people have never forgotten her. Her memory lives in the union of Poland and Lithuania, and the comparative peace enjoyed under the rule of the Jagiellonian kings.\n\nShe is known in Polish as Jadwiga, in English and German as Hedwig, in Lithuanian as Jadvyga, in Hungarian as Hedvig, and in Latin as Hedvigis. She is venerated by the Roman Catholic Church as Saint Hedwig. Jadwiga is the patron saint of queens, and of United Europe.\n\n(On June 8, 1979 Pope John Paul II prayed at her sarcophagus; and the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments officially affirmed her beatification on August 8, 1986. The Pope canonized Jadwiga in Kraków on June 8, 1997)\n\nOne interesting story about Jadwiga's benevolence demonstrates the connection between myth and history. It had long been told that Jadwiga had given away all of her wealth (including the crown jewels and her personal jewelry) to help establish the Academy of Cracow (which was later renamed the Jagiellonian University, in honor of her and Wladyslaw). Retold through the centuries, this story became legend, seemingly invented as an example of her good works. However, when her sarcophagus in the Wawel Cathedral was opened in 1887, her skeleton was discovered with the royal scepter and orb with which she had been buried. Shockingly, the scepter and orb were made of humble wood, without even a covering of gold leaf! Jadwiga died at at the young age of 25, so there had been no time for her to reacquire a suitably regal symbols of her sovereignty. The legend proved to be true after all, and today Jadwiga's wooden scepter and orb are on display next to her sarcophagus in the Wawel Cathedral!\n\nThe Commonwealth forces finally drove back the Swedes in 1657. (Jan Sobieski was among the Greater Polish regiments based in Poznan)\n\nThese heroic victories were regarded as the miracle of Black Madonna and Czestochowa's fame grew even more. It also made the grateful Polish King Jan Kazimierz to crown Black Madonn Queen and Patroness of Poland.\n\n( The legend concerning the two scars on the Black Madonna's right cheek dates back 220 years from this period, when the Protestant Hussites (Czechs) stormed the Pauline monastery in 1430, plundering the sanctuary. Among the items stolen was the icon. After putting it in their wagon, the Hussites tried to get away but their horses refused to move. They threw the portrait down to the ground and one of the plunderers drew his sword upon the image and inflicted two deep strikes. When the robber tried to inflict a third strike, he fell to the ground and squirmed in agony until his death. )\n\n1629 - 1696 Jan Sobieski (Greatest Polish King and Saviour of Vienna)\n\nAlthough Poland-Lithuania was at that time the largest and one of the most populous states of Europe, Sobieski became a king of a country (1676) devastated by almost half a century of constant war, which brought an end to Poland's economic well-being. The treasury was almost empty and the court had little to offer for the powerful magnates, who often allied themselves with foreign courts rather than the state they lived in. Sobieski decided to stabilise the situation of the country by forcing the Ottomans to accept a peace treaty to end the constant wars on the southern border. In the autumn of 1674 he recommenced the war against the Turks and managed to recapture the mighty fortresses of Kamieniec Podolski, Bar and Reszków, which re-established a strongly-fortified line defending Poland's southern border in the Ukraine.\n\nIn 1676 the Tatars started a counter-offensive and crossed the Dneper, but could not retake the strategic town of Żórawno and the peace treaty was signed soon afterwards. Although Kamieniec Podolski remained a part of Turkey, Poland levelled its significance by the construction of the Stronghold of the Holy Trinity and return of the town of Bila Tserkva. With signing of the treaty a period of peace started, much needed to repair the country and strengthen the royal authority. Although constantly harassed by the magnates and foreign courts of Brandenburg and Austria (Austria even tried to oust Sobieski and replace him with Charles of Lorraine), Sobieski completely reformed the Polish military. The military was reorganised into regiments, the infantry finally dropped pikes replacing them with battle-axes and the Polish cavalry adopted the formations of the famous Winged Hussars and dragoons. Also, Sobieski greatly increased the number of guns and developed a new tactics of artillery.\n\nBattle of Vienna 1683\n\nSobieski's greatest success came on September 12, 1683 with his victory at the Battle of Vienna, in joint command (with Leopold who actually fled the city to safety returning the day after the victory - and of course claiming credit) of Polish, Austrian and German troops, against the invading Turks under Kara Mustafa. The Muslim armies were threatening to overturn Christian Europe - this was a pivotal battle for the heart of europe and Christianity.\n\nUpon reaching Vienna, he joined with the Austrians and Germans. Sobieski had planned to attack on the 13th of September, but with Turkish undermining efforts being close to breach the walls and enter the city, he ordered full attack on September 12. At 04:00 a united army of about 81,000 men attacked a Turkish army that numbered about 130,000 men which were divided between attacking the town walls and fighting off the united army. At about five o'clock in the afternoon, after observing the infantry battle from the hilltop, Sobieski led Polish husaria cavalry along with Austrians and Germans into a massive charge down the hillside. Soon, the Turkish battle line was broken and the Ottoman forces scattered in confusion. At 17:30, Sobieski entered the deserted tent of Kara Mustafa and the battle of Vienna ended.\n\nThe Pope and other foreign dignitaries hailed Sobieski as the \"Savior of Vienna and Western European civilization.\" In a letter to his wife he wrote, \"All the common people kissed my hands, my feet, my clothes; others only touched me, saying: 'Ah, let us kiss so valiant a hand!'\"\n\nYou'd expect the Austrians to be grateful and at least recognise Sobieski's effort with a memorial in Vienna !..... But not everything is remembered. It's hard to find any trace of the victory of Jan Sobieski, who embarrassed Leopold by entering the city in triumph a day before the Emperor managed to return. Sobieski's memorial in the city's historical centre is a simple plaque, mounted 300 years after the events of 1683.\n\nKing Jan III Sobieski, nicknamed by the Turks the \"Lion of Lehistan\", and the last great king of Poland, died in Wilanów, Poland on June 17, 1696. His wife, Maria Kasimira, died in 1716 in Blois, France and her body was returned to Poland. They are interred together in Wawel Cathedral, Kraków, Poland.\n\nHe also founded the School of Chivalry (otherwise \"Corps of Cadets\"), which functioned 1765-1794 and whose alumni included Tadeusz Kościuszko; and the Commission of National Education (1773), the world's first national ministry of education.\n\nIt was only during the Four-Year Sejm of 1788-1792 that he threw in his lot with the reformers, centered in the Patriotic Party, and with them co-authored the Constitution of 3 May 1791.Poniatowski's eloquent speech before the Sejm on taking an oath to uphold the newly adopted Constitution moved his audience to tears.\n\nAfraid that the May Constitution of Poland (1791) might lead to a resurgence in the power of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and that the growing democratic movements inside the Commonwealth might become a threat to the European monarchies, Catherine decided to intervene in Poland. She provided support to a Polish anti-reform group known as the Targowica Confederation formed by Polish nobility led by Stanisław Szczęsny Potocki to overthrow the Constitution. The confederates aligned with Russia's Catherine the Great, and the Russian army entered Poland, starting the Polish-Russian War of 1792.\n\n[Targowica Confederation : Agreed in April 27th. in St Petersburg and on May 14, 1792 it was announced in a small town Targowica in Kirovohrad Oblast Ukraine by members of republican plot.\n\nIs this the same town that our folks came from ? No our Targovica is in the Volyn Oblast. However in Poland supporters of the confederation are referred to as \"targowiczanin\" or foolish traitor- !!]\n\nAfter a series of battles, Poniatowski, upon the advice of Hugo Kołłątaj and others, acceded to the Confederation. This undermined the operations of the Polish Army, which under Tadeusz Kościuszko and the King's own nephew, Prince Jozef Poniatowski, had been performing miracles on the battlefield.\n\nAfter defeating Polish loyalist forces in the Polish War in Defense of the Constitution (1792) and in the Kościuszko Uprising (1794), Russia completed the partitioning of Poland, dividing all of the remaining Commonwealth territory with Prussia and Austria (1795).\n\nAfter the final, Third Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Stanisław August was forced to abdicate (25 November 1795) and left for Saint Petersburg, Russia. There, a virtual prisoner, he subsisted on a pension granted to him by Empress Catherine the Great, and died deeply in debt. He was buried at the Catholic Church of St. Catherine in St. Petersburg.\n\nAnd so the ERA's of Polish Kings came to an end\n\nTadeusz Kościuszko (Son of Liberty) 1746 - 1817\n\nHe is a national hero in Poland, Belarus, Lithuania, and the United States. He led the 1794 Kościuszko Uprising against Imperial Russia and Kingdom of Prussia as Supreme Commander of the National Armed Force. He was the son of Polish noble Ludwik Tadeusz Kościuszko and Tekla, née Ratomska. He was the youngest child in a family whose lineages are traced to Lithuanian and Ruthenian nobility.\n\nHe joined the Knights Academy in 1765 and In 1769 Kościuszko and his colleague Orłowski were granted a royal scholarship in Paris. Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was forced to cut back its Army to 10,000 men, and when Kościuszko finally returned home in 1774, there was no place for him in the Army. he decided to travel back to Paris. There he was informed of the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, in which the British colonies in North America revolted against the crown and started the fight for independence.Thus he travelled to North America and joined the Continental Army. He was so moved after reading the Declaration of Independance much of which expressed his own opinions of freedoms that he was compelled to meet it's author Thomas Jefferson - becoming good friends in the process.\n\n1776, Congress commissioned him a Colonel of Engineers in the Continental Army. \"He was assigned a black slave named Agrippa Hull, whom he eventually freed.\n\nAfter seven years of service, on October 13, 1783, Kościuszko was promoted by Congress to the rank of brigadier general. He also received American citizenship and a grant of land and was admitted to the prestigious Society of the Cincinnati and to the American Philosophical Society. When he was leaving America, he wrote a last will, naming Thomas Jefferson the executor and leaving his property in America to be used to buy the freedom of black slaves\n\nIn July 1784 Kościuszko set off for Poland, where he arrived on August 12. He settled in his home village of Siechnowicze. The property, administered by his brother-in-law, brought a small but stable income, and Kościuszko decided to limit his serfs' corvée to two days a week, while completely exempting female serfs. This move was seen by local szlachta (nobility) as a sign of Kościuszko's dangerous liberalism. But liberal thought was spreading - a strong, if still informal, group of politicians advocated for reforms and for strengthening the state arguing for granting the serfs and burghers more rights and for strengthening the central authorities. These ideas were supported by a large part of the szlachta, who also wanted to curb foreign meddling in Poland's internal affairs.\n\nFinally the Great Sejm of 1788–92 opened the necessary reforms. One of its first acts was to approve the creation of a 100,000-man army to defend the Commonwealth's borders against its aggressive neighbors. Kościuszko applied to the army and on October 12, 1789, received a royal commission as a major general.\n\nThe Commonwealth's internal situation and the reforms initiated by the Constitution of May 3, 1791, the first constitution written in the modern era in Europe and second in the world after the American, were seen by the surrounding powers as a threat to their influence over Polish politics. On May 14, 1792, conservative magnates created the Targowica Confederation, which asked Russian Tsarina Catherine II for help in overthrowing the constitution. On May 18, 1792, a 100,000-man Russian army crossed the Polish border and headed for Warsaw, thus opening the Polish-Russian War of 1792.\n\nVictorious in the Battle of Zieleńce (June 18, 1792), Kościuszko was among the first to receive the newly-created Virtuti Militari medal, Poland's highest military decoration even today.\n\nIn the ensuing Battles of Włodzimierz (July 17, 1792) and Dubienka (July 18) Kościuszko repulsed the numerically superior enemy and came to be regarded as one of Poland's most brilliant military commanders of the time. On August 1, 1792, King Stanisław August promoted him to Lieutenant General. But before the nomination arrived at Kościuszko's camp in Sieciechów, the King had joined the ranks of the Targowica Confederation and surrendered to the Russians.\n\nThe King's capitulation was a hard blow for Kościuszko, who had not lost a single battle in the campaign. Together with many other notable Polish commanders and politicians he fled to Dresden and then to Leipzig, where the émigrées began preparing an uprising against Russian rule in Poland.\n\nOn January 13, 1793, Prussia and Russia signed the Second Partition of Poland, which was ratified by the Sejm of Grodno on June 17. Such an outcome was a giant blow for the members of Targowica Confederation who saw their actions as a defense of centuries-old privileges of the magnates, but now were regarded by the majority of the Polish population as traitors. After the partition Poland became a small country of roughly 200,000 square kilometres and a population of approximately 4 million. The economy was ruined and the support for the cause of an uprising grew significantly, especially since there was no serious opposition to the idea after the Targowica Confederation was discredited.\n\nThe situation in Poland was changing rapidly. The Russian and Prussian governments forced Poland to again disband the majority of her armed forces and the reduced units were to be drafted to the Russian army. Also, in March the tsarist agents discovered the group of revolutionaries in Warsaw and started arresting notable Polish politicians and military commanders with forced imprisonment and deportation to Siberia.\n\nPicture graphically portrays the poignant plight of the Sybiracy after Uprising against the Russian Empire and deported to Siberia.\n\nKościuszko was forced to execute his plan earlier than planned and on March 15, 1794 he set off for Kraków.\n\nKościuszko Uprising: During the Uprising, Kościuszko was made Naczelnik (Commander-in-Chief) of all Polish-Lithuanian forces fighting against Russian occupation, and on the 7th May 1794 issued the famous Proclamation of Połaniec.\n\nThis act partially abolished the serfdom in Poland, granting significant civil liberties to all peasants. The reasons behind the Połaniec proclamation were twofold: first, Kosciuszko, a liberal and a reformist, believed that the serfdom was an unfair system and should end; second, the uprising was in desperate need for recruits and freeing the peasants would prompt many of them to fight.The proclamation provided the peasants with the personal freedom right for assistance from the state against the abuses of the Polish nobility (szlachta) and gave them specific property rights to the land they cultivated\n\nKościuszko and his kosynierzy peasant infantry enjoyed initial successes following the Battle of Racławice, It was the first time in Polish history when the peasants were officially regarded as part of the nation . (Members of the Targovica Coferation if caught were tried and hung). However he was wounded in the Battle of Maciejowice Oct 1794 and taken prisoner by the Russians, who imprisoned him in Saint Petersburg—Kościuszko was held at Prince Orlov's Marble Palace. The uprising ended soon afterwards with the Siege of Warsaw. The Proclamation of Połaniec thus never came into being.\n\nHowever 127 years later and for the first time in Polish History emerged a similar law granting lands to Polish soldiers (our grandfather/greatgrandfather Stanislaw benefitted) who fought in the Polish Bolshevik war of 1919 - 1921.\n\nKościuszko was a man of the ordinary people of Poland and as such Polands greatest hero.\n\nIn 1796 Tsar Paul I of Russia pardoned Kościuszko and set him free. In exchange for his oath of loyalty, Paul I also freed some 20,000 Polish political prisoners held in Russian prisons and forcibly settled in Siberia.\n\nKościuszko emigrated to the United States, but the following year returned to Europe and in 1798 settled in Breville, near Paris. Still devoted to the Polish cause, he took part in creating the Polish Legions. Also, on October 17 and November 6, 1799 he met with Napoleon Bonaparte.However, he failed to reach any agreement with the French leader.\n\nHe spent some time in Vienna and moved to Solothurn, Switzerland, where his friend Franciszek Zeltner was mayor. Suffering from poor health and old wounds, on October 15 1817 Kościuszko died there of typhoid fever. Two years earlier, he had emancipated his serfs.\n\nKościuszko's body was embalmed and placed in a crypt at Solothurn's Jesuit Church. His viscera, removed in the process of embalming, were separately interred in a graveyard at Zuchwil, near Solothurn, except for the heart, for which an urn was fashioned. In 1818 Kościuszko's body was transferred to Kraków, Poland, and placed in a crypt at Wawel Cathedral, a pantheon of Polish kings and national heroes. Kościuszko's heart, which had been preserved at the Polish Museum in Rapperswil, Switzerland, was in 1927, along with the rest of the Museum's holdings, repatriated to Warsaw, where the heart now reposes in a chapel at the Royal Castle. Kościuszko's other viscera (innards) remain interred at Zuchwil, where a large memorial stone was erected in 1820 and can be visited today, next to a Polish memorial chapel.\n\nThus his heart is in Warsaw - his body in Krakow and his innards in Switzerland.\n\n1772 -1795 Three phases of Partitions divide Poland up amongst it's powerful neighbours..\n\nThis map shows how Poland was divided by Russia, Prussia and Austria in 3 partitions..\n\nThe Marczaks came from near Luck on this map - it was in the centre of Poland during the golden age.\n\nThe Partitions and occupation of the country resulted in a considerable increase in titles as collaborationist families were rewarded by the Partitioning powers. Thus to a greater extent there was no significant resistance to the partitioning - some noble families gained considerably - atleast in the early years of the partitions\n\nThe effect of the defeat of 1794 Uprising led to Poland being totally partitioned by it's neighbours - there was no Polish State any longer\n\n1806 The Duchy of Warsaw was officially created by the victorious Napoleon Bonaparte, as part of the Treaty of Tilsit with Prussia.\n\nThe area of the duchy had already been liberated by a popular uprising that had escalated from anti-conscription rioting in 1806. One of the first tasks for the new government included providing food to the French army fighting the Russians in East Prussia. Its creation met the support of both local republicans in partitioned Poland, and the large Polish diaspora in France, who openly supported Napoleon as the only man capable of restoring Polish sovereignty after the Partitions of Poland of late 18th century. The newly (re)created state was formally an independent duchy, allied to France who treated it as a source of resources - so the duchy of Warsaw was never fully independant. (reason why Kościuszko did not see eye to eye with Napoleon).\n\nHowever when Napoleon lost his battle with Russia in 1812 the Duchy was divided up once again by Prussia and Russia in 1813.\n\nThere were further uprisings\n\nThe November Uprising (1830–1831)—also known as the Cadet Revolution—was an armed rebellion against the rule of the Russian Empire in Poland and Lithuania. The uprising began on November 29, 1830 in Warsaw when a group of young non-commissioned officer conspirators from the Imperial Russian Army's military academy in Warsaw led by Piotr Wysocki revolted. They were soon joined by large parts of Polish society. Despite several local successes, the uprising was eventually crushed by a numerically superior Russian army under Ivan Paskevich.\n\nTo escape Germanification and Russification of the country many \"Polish Elites\" emigrated notably to France.\n\nThe Great Emigration (Polish: Wielka Emigracja) was an emigration of political elites from Poland from 1831–1870.\n\nThey included Polish nobility with anti Russian sympathies along with artist, authors, poets and composers who romanticised about the Polish state, all risked banishment to Central Russia or even deportation to Siberia.\n\nMost of the political émigrés were based in France. The most important wave of emigration came after the November Uprising of 1830–1831. Because of this emigration of political elites, much of the political and ideological activity of the Polish intelligentsia during the 18th and 19th centuries was done outside of the lands of partitioned Poland.\n\nSome of the emigrants included\n\nAdam Mickiewicz (Poet. 1798 - 1855)\n\nFrederick Chopin ( Polish composer and virtuoso pianist. 1810 - 1849)\n\nPrince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski (1770 - 1861) (Leader of Polish Government in Exile in Paris) ( Great Polish Noble family - it was Adam who aquired the Leanardo Da Vinci \"Lady with Ermine\" painting in 1798 for the collection at the family home at Pulawy near Lublin - The painting is now at the Czartoryski Museum in Krakow- Krakow is one of just six places in the world that can boast a painting by Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519), It's one of only three female portraits of which Krakow’s Lady with an Ermine is arguably the most beautiful)\n\nHe was born on December 5, 1867 at his family's manor in the village of Zalavas (Polish: Zułów)now in Lithuania.\n\nThe Piłsudski family, impoverished szlachta,cherished Polish patriotic traditions and has been characterized either as Polish or as Polonized-Lithuanian. His father, likewise named Józef, had fought in the January 1863 Uprising against Russian rule of Poland.\n\nThe family resented the Russian government's Russification policies. Young Józef profoundly disliked having to attend Russian Orthodox Church service and left school with an aversion not only for the Russian Tsar and the Russian Empire, but for the culture, which he knew well\n\nIn 1887 he was arrested and falseley charged with attempting to kill the Tsar. Józef received a sentence: five years' exile in Siberia, first at Kirensk on the Lena River, then at Tunka.While being transported in a prisoners' convoy to Siberia, Piłsudski was held for several weeks at a prison in Irkutsk. There he took part in what the authorities viewed as a revolt: after one of the inmates had insulted a guard and refused to apologize, he and other political prisoners were beaten by the guards for their defiance; Piłsudski lost two teeth and took part in a subsequent hunger strike until the authorities reinstated political prisoners' privileges that had been suspended after the incident.For his involvement, he was sentenced in 1888 to six months' imprisonment.He had to spend the first night of his incarceration in 40-degree-below-zero Siberian cold; this led to an illness that nearly killed him and to health problems that would plague him throughout life\n\nJuly 1914 WW1\n\nAnd so things remained like this until the 1st World War.\n\nTsarist Russia join Britian and France in an Entente to fight the central powers of Prussia and Austria Hungary- The Prussians give the Russians a bloody nose and take the Polish lands.
