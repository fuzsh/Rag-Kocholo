Mieszko III, ruler of Greater PolandAccording to his father's testament, Mieszko received the Greater Poland Province, composed by Western Greater Poland with Poznan as his main residence. His older half-brother, Wladyslaw II (the eldest son of the late Duke with his first Russian wife) was the High Duke and overlord of the country.\n\n[edit] The First Conflict with Wladyslaw IIThe first major conflict with the High Duke took place during 1140-1141, when the Junior Dukes and their mother Salomea, (without Wladyslaw's knowledge), divided between them the Leczyca province and decided to arrange the marriage of their younger sister, Agnes with one of the sons of the Grand Prince of Kiev, Vsevolod II Olgovich. Only because of the rapid intervention of Wladyslaw did the independence plans of the Junior Dukes fail. Grand Prince Vsevolod II, facing the choice between an alliance with the strong High Duke or the weak Junior Dukes and their mother, chose the former, which was reinforced with the betrothal of Wladyslaw's eldest son to Vsevolod's daughter.\n\n[edit] Death of Salomea of Berg. The Second Part of the conflict with Wladyslaw IIOn 27 July 1144, the Dowager Duchess Salomea died. Wladyslaw then incorporated the Leczyca province into the Seniorate. This was opposed by the Junior Duke Boleslaw and Mieszko, who wished to give this land to his brother Henry. Fighting took place in 1145. After an unexpected defeat, the High Duke was finally able to obtain the victory (Battle of Pilicy), thanks to his Kievan allies. An agreement was then made, under which Wladyslaw retained Leczyca. However, the High Duke continued with his intention of reuniting all Poland under his rule. This provoked the strong opposition of the voivode Piotr Wlostowic, who decided to support the Junior Dukes in order to maintain his power and position. Wladyslaw decided to eliminate Wlostowic for good. The voivode was captured in an ambush. The Duchess Agnes of Babenberg, Wladyslaw's wife, demanded Wlostowic's death, but the High Duke chose instead a terrible punishment: Wlostowic was blinded, muted and expelled from the country. Thus began Wladyslaw's fall.\n\n[edit] The Third Part of the conflict. Wladyslaw II is exiled from the country. Boleslaw IV, New High Duke of PolandThe war erupted again in early 1146. This time, Wladyslaw couldn't count with his Kievan allies, because they were busy in his own problems (which more the High Duke sent some of their forces, led by his eldest son Boleslaw, in order to support Great prince Vsevolod in Kiev). Wladyslaw was confident of his victory and initially it seemed that the success was on his side, because Boleslaw and Mieszko, fearing clashes in an open field, decided to escape to Poznan. At this time was when began the disaster to the High Duke. Wladyslaw's cause lose support when the Archbishop of Gniezno excommunicated him for his behavior against the voivode Wlostowic, and also his own subjects, who were against his tyrannical rule. The defeat of Wladyslaw was totally; by May of 1146 all Poland was in the hands of the Junior Dukes, and the former High Duke and his family were forced to escape firstly to Bohemia and later to Germany, under the protection of King Conrad III, half-brother of Duchess Agnes.\n\nAfter consolidated his rule over Poland, Boleslaw and Mieszko decided his new politics. Boleslaw took control over Silesia and take the title of High Duke. Mieszko, by the other hand, was really satisfied with his role of a close colleague of his older brother. Henry, the next brother, finally received his Duchy of Sandomierz. The youngest brother, Casimir, remained without lands.\n\n[edit] The Expedition of the German King Conrad III in defense of Wladyslaw IIKing Conrad III of Germany arrived in Poland in August 1146 on an expedition to restore his brother-in-law Wladyslaw to the throne. The German army was defeated as a result of spillages of the Oder River and the opposition of Wladyslaw's former subjects to German interference. Finally an agreement was reached, under which the King accepted the rule of Boleslaw; in return, he was declared a vassal of the Empire. The dispute between Wladyslaw and the Juniors Dukes remained unresolved, because King Conrad III was busy with the preparations of his journey to the Holy Land.\n\n[edit] Recognition of the Junior Duke's authority and relations with the European rulersIn the meanwhile, the Junior Dukes didn't wait passively for an arrangement who consolidated his power. In May 1147 received by the Pope Eugene III the confirmation of a foundation for a monastery in Trzemeszno, which was a clear recognition of their sovereignty.\n\nIn 1147, simultaneously with the arrival of Conrad III to the Holy Land, Mieszko joined to a crusade against the pagans Slavics, which was organized by Albert the Bear, Margrave of Brandenburg, and Margrave Conrad of Meissen. However, during this trip Mieszko sought to protect Polish interests of the Spree politically and militarily supporting some Slav tribes. This help to the pagans infuriated the Margrave of Brandenburg, who arrived in early 1148 to Kruszwica in order to improve their alliance. Finally, they made an agreement, who was confirmed by the marriage of the Junior Duke's sister Judith with Otto, eldest son of Albert the Bear.\n\n[edit] Expedition of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa to PolandThe Expedition of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa actually began in 1157. For unknown reasons, Boleslaw and Mieszko did not try to defend the traditional frontier of Oder River and instead, burned some old castles in GlogÃ³w and Bytom (Beuthen) and began their retreat into the depths of Greater Poland. After his defeat, the humiliated High Duke asked for forgiveness from the Emperor. The Junior Dukes also paid a great tribute to Barbarossa, and promised to send food to the Emperor's Italian expedition on Christmas Day in Magdeburg, where he was finally resolved the dispute with Wladyslaw's sons. As a guarantee of the fulfillment of the agreement, the Junior Dukes' younger brother, Casimir, was sent to Germany as a hostage. Only the involvement of the Emperor in the Italian affairs followed by the death of Wladyslaw on 30 May 1159, permitted the Junior Dukes to return his inheritance to Wladyslaw's issue. Three years later, in 1163, the High Duke finally returned Silesia to his nephews.\n\n[edit] Death of Henry of Sandomierz. Mieszko III and Casimir II the Just rebelled against Boleslaw IVIn October 1166, during the Prussian expedition, Duke Henry of Sandomierz was killed in battle. Before his departure, and in case of his death, he left his duchy to his youngest brother Casimir, who until remained without lands. However, the High Duke, against the his late brother's will, he occupied Sandomierz and annexed them to the Seniorate Province.\n\nThis decision originated the rebellion of Casimir the Just, which was supported by Mieszko, the magnate Jaksa of MiechÃ³w and Sviatoslav, son of Piotr Wlostowica, as well of Jan I, Archbishop of Gniezno and Gedko, Bishop of KrakÃ³w. In February 1168 the rebels gathered in JedrzejÃ³w, were Mieszko was elected as a High Duke and Casimir was invested with Sandomierz. The final defeat of Boleslaw IV didn't occur, because the High Duke accepted the demands of the rebels and divided Henry's Duchy in three parts: Wislica was taken by Casimir, Boleslaw took Sandomierz, and the rest was led to Mieszko.\n\n[edit] The situation in Silesia. Mieszko III went to Germany and paid homage to the EmperorIn 1172 were turbulent events in Silesia. Boleslaw the Tall's eldest son, Jaroslaw, forced to become a priest, return from his exile in Germany and claimed a share of the Silesian lands. Mieszko supported his grandnephew in his demands, and the civil war was reiniciated.\n\nIn order to prevent the Imperial intervention, the High Duke sent Mieszko to Magdeburg, with the sum of 8,000 pieces of silver as a tribute to the Emperor and promised to resolved this conflict soon. This time, the terms of the agreement have been strictly realized. Boleslaw retained his power over Wroclaw; however, he had to agree on the division of the Silesian lands between their princes.\n\n[edit] Death of Boleslaw IV. Mieszko III, High Duke of PolandAfter Boleslaw IV died on 3 April 1173, Mieszko was chosen as the new High Duke of Poland (dux Totius Poloniae). His policy focused on maintaining full power for himself, as the oldest surviving member of the dynasty. Despite his succession to the throne of KrakÃ³w, the new High Duke remained in Greater Poland. Lesser Poland was ruled by Henry Kietlicz, as a governor appointed by Mieszko.\n\nMieszko III had several foreign policy successes through his daughters' marriages. Through this dynastic arrangement, Mieszko renewed and reinforced Polish sovereignty over Western Pomerania.\n\n[edit] Rebellions against Mieszko III's authority. Casimir II the Just conquest the Duchy of KrakÃ³w, Miesko's eldest son Odon took the Greater PolandOdon, the eldest son of Mieszko by his first marriage, rebelled against his father. He was supported by Gedko, bishop of KrakÃ³w, his cousin Boleslaw I the Tall and his uncle Casimir II the Just. To Odon, the main reason of his rebellion was the favoritism of Mieszko to the offspring of his second marriage and the attempts of the High Duke to force him to became a priest, in order to eliminated from the succession. To the others, the harsh and dictatorial government of the High Duke.\n\nThe rebellion was a complete surprise to Mieszko; even during the Easter of 1177 he was totally convinced of the loyalty of his relatives, especially that when the Junior Dukes organized a meeting in Gniezno, were the High Duke was received by the crowds with cheers. Greater Poland, however, remained strongly in his hands, thanks to his governor Henry Kietlicz, the most important follower of Mieszko. At the same time, Casimir, the clear head of the rebellion, made a divisionary treaty with his supporters: all Silesia was granted to Boleslaw the Tall and the Greater Poland to Odon. This was a significant complication, because in Silesia Boleslaw ruled alongside with his brother Mieszko I Tanglefoot and his own son Jaroslaw ruled in Opole. After knew this agreement, both Mieszko and Jaroslaw sided with the High Duke and rebelled against Boleslaw, who, busy fighting with his brother and son, loss the opportunity to gain KrakÃ³w and obtain the Seniorate for himself; in his place, was Casimir the Just who took control over the Seniorate Province, and, with this, he became in the new High Duke of Poland. After seeing any possibility of continuing the resistance, Mieszko escape to RacibÃ³rz, under the protection of his nephew and namesake Miesko Tanglefoot. However, shortly afterwards the deposed High Duke decided to left Poland and seek the foreign support. Odon finally occupied all Greater Poland and was declared his Duke.\n\n[edit] Political Exile. Mieszko III return to Poland and reconciled with his son OdonBy 1179, Mieszko went to Bohemia (where his son-in-law Sobeslav II refused to help him), Germany (here Mieszko obtain the attention of the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, which offered his help in his restoration on the Polish throne after a payment of 10,000 pieces of silver, a sum that he can't reunited) and Western Pomerania, where his other son-in-law Bogislaw I accepted to help him. Thanks to his Pomeranian allies, Mieszko forged his links with their Polish followers, grouped around Zdzislaw, Archbishop of Gniezno; however, in 1181, he was able to take Eastern Greater Poland -provinces of Gniezno and Kalisz, who belong to the Seniorate- thanks to the aid of his forged Polish allies. At the same time, Mieszko also managed to recover the Western Greater Poland. Odon was pushed to the southern part of Obra River. In 1182 was made the formal reconciliation between father and son. During these events, and for unknown reasons, Casimir the Just remained in total passivity; thanks to this, Mieszko had the opportunity to recover all Greater Poland.\n\n[edit] Mieszko III tried to recover the full power over Poland. Annexation of KuyaviaIn 1184 Mieszko was interested in an alliance with the German King Henry VI (with the intention to recover the overlordship over Poland), offering him a large sum of money. Casimir the Just, however, knew his intentions and send to the King more money that the Duke of Greater Poland.\n\nAfter his failure with the King, Mieszko decided to take control over Masovia and Kuyavia, who was ruled by his nephew Leszek, the only surviving son of Boleslaw IV. Mieszko convinced Leszek to named him his successor if he died without issue. The rude and harsh proceedings of the Greater Poland Duke were maybe the reason that in 1185, one year before his death, Leszek changed his testament and appointed his younger uncle Casimir the Just as his successor. This time, Mieszko acted quickly and, after the death of Leszek in 1186 he took Kuyavia and annexed to his Duchy. Shortly after, he ceded this land to his son Boleslaw.\n\n[edit] Brief Restoration of Mieszko III in KrakÃ³wIn 1191 the foreign policy of Casimir the Just triggered dissatisfaction in the Lesser Poland nobility, led by Henry Kietlicz. With the help of this opposition, Mieszko could finally reconquest KrakÃ³w and resumed the title of High Duke. He decided to entrusted the government of KrakÃ³w to one of his sons, Boleslaw of Kuyavia or Mieszko the Younger; however, Casimir quickly regained KrakÃ³w and the overlordship and the Prince-Governor was captured; however, he soon was sent with his father. Probably after the failed expedition over KrakÃ³w, Mieszko give to his son and namesake the district of Kalisz as his own Duchy.\n\n[edit] Division of the Greater Poland between his grandson and his son Wladyslaw IIIOn 2 August 1193 Mieszko the Younger died. His Duchy of Kalisz was then reverted to Greater Poland, but shortly after, Mieszko granted the Duchy to his older son Odon, who died eight months later, on 20 April 1194. These two early deaths forced Mieszko to made a new divisionary treaty: Mieszko retained Kalisz for himself, while Southern Greater Poland was given to his son Wladyslaw III Spindleshanks, who also assumed the guardianship of the minor son of Odon, Wladyslaw Odonic.\n\n[edit] Death of Casimir II the Just. Mieszko III's renewed his pretentions over KrakÃ³w. Battle of Mozgawa and death of his son BoleslawCasimir the Just died on 5 May 1194, and Mieszko's pretentions over Lesser Poland reborn. Unfortunately, this time the local nobility prefer to see on the throne the minors sons of Casimir, Leszek and Konrad. His attempts to retake the power end in the bloody Battle of Mozgawa (13 September 1195), were Mieszko was seriously injured and his son Boleslaw of Kuyavia died.\n\nAfter the battle Mieszko withdraw to Kalisz without waiting for the Silesia troops who came to his aid, led by Mieszko Tanglefoot and Jaroslaw of Opole.\n\n[edit] Agreement with Helena of Znojmo. Mieszko recover the power over KrakÃ³w in exchange for Kuyavia. Settlements with the nobilityThe Battle of Mozgawa persuade Mieszko that to gain the throne with violence was extremely difficult, so he began the negotiations with the widow of Casimir the Just, Helena of Znojmo. In 1198 he finally was allowed to return to Lesser Poland, but he was compelled to ceded Kuyavia to Casimir's sons. In 1199, the voivode Mikolaj Gryfita and Pelka, Bishop of KrakÃ³w deposed Mieszko and restored Leszek as High Duke; however, three years later was made a new settlement and Mieszko was able to return. He retained the title of High Duke, but was forced to give up part of his powers. He died shortly afterwards; at that time, he survived all his siblings and four of his five sons.\n\n[edit] Marriages and IssueAround 1136, Mieszko married firstly with Elisabeth (b. ca. 1128 - d. ca. 1154), daughter of King BÃ©la II of Hungary.[1] They had five children:[2]\n\nOdon (b. ca. 1149 - d. 20 April 1194).\n\nStephen (b. ca. 1150 - d. 18 October 1166/77?).\n\nElisabeth (b. 1152 - d. 2 April 1209), married firstly ca. 1173 to Sobeslav II, Duke of Bohemia and secondly aft.
