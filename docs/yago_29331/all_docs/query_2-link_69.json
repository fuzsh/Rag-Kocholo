        "text": "This victory was, above all, successfully turned into a propaganda success for Sigismund the Old on the international stage. Descriptions of the battle (authored by, amongst others, the papal nuncio) were printed and distributed to the main European capitals. They portrayed the duplicity of Emperor Maximilian, who had concluded an alliance with Moscow after accusing Sigismund the Old of anti-Christian conduct towards the Teutonic Order.\n\nHowever, Sigismund the Old was aware that an armed conflict with the Habsburgs would not be the best idea. The Polish king resorted to peaceful means to address the threat. On the one hand, he had sought to strengthen relations with Hungary even before the emperor’s alliance with Moscow, so as to indirectly weaken Habsburg influence. He married Barbara Zápolya, a representative of the leaders of the national party in Hungary (opponents of the Habsburgs). On the other hand, he successfully tackled the problem of the Teutonic Order. On 10 April 1525, Sigismund the Old received tribute (known as the Prussian Homage) from the last Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, Albrecht Hohenzollern, on Cracow’s market square. It was an extremely important event that signified the secularisation of Teutonic Prussia (Ducal Prussia was then created), which became the Polish fief. Moreover, the Prince of Prussia (i.e. Albrecht) pledged to provide armed assistance to the Polish ruler whenever asked to do so. Sigismund the Old’s power thus extended to even more territories. He also eventually incorporated Mazovia, which became a full-fledged province, into his kingdom.\n\nThe king chose his ministers wisely and proved adept at managing Poland’s finances, urban development and customs matters. He also recovered numerous estates which, while forming part of the crown lands of Poland, had been held under pledge. By accumulating estates throughout the country and expanding the crown land, the monarch was emerging as an increasingly strong political player. In this respect, he was supported by his second wife, Bona Sforza. She was also keen to strengthen the monarch’s position by ensuring the succession to her son, Sigismund Augustus. A vivente rege election (one taking place during the lifetime of the reigning king) was then held, although the nobility made it clear that this was an exceptional case.\n\nThe threat of war with Turkey was also averted. As for Sweden, Ladislas engaged both in diplomatic efforts and in military preparations. Fortunately, the war did not happen and a truce (which was to last until 1661) was signed in 1635. While sometimes regarded as a sign of weakness on the part of the Commonwealth, the truce allowed the conflict to be avoided at this point. It was, however, inevitable that it would erupt sooner or later. For one thing, Ladislas still laid claim – like his father before him – to the Swedish crown. For another thing, Livonia, which was already divided between Poland and Sweden, was regarded by each of them as a prized acquisition target."
