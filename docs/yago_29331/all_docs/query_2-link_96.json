THis chapter details these topics.\n\nApproximately the polish population of Hungarian Republic is 10-12 thousand. So the number of polish minorities in Hungary is not two extensive but their influence and the influence of Poland in Hungary is main. Proof is the visit and speech of Polish Prime Minister, Mattheus Morawieczki in Budapest on March 15 2019 in Budapest.

They found refuge at each others or asked help from each others. THese facts influenced historical background and relationships of both Polish and Hungarian Nation.\n\nSecond wife Adelajda of Prince Géza.Adelajda is the daughter of Prince Semomysi. First wife of Valliant Boleslav was the daughter of Prince Géza. Her name was Judit. She was the daughter of István The Saint The First.Fruit of this marriage was Bezprym(968-1032) who exiled to Hungary. In Hungary King István The First his uncle has given him land at Balaton-Highland. According to a legend Veszprém brings his name.\n\nIn the Era following the death of István The Saint, Princes of Árpád Dynasty, András(Andrew), Béla and Levente exiled to Poland. THey have seeking refuge against Peter. Andrew The First(I.András) has dethroned Peter taking help from Poland. Andrew has been followed on the throne by his younger brother Béla THe First wife's daughter Rycheza, daughter of Mieszko THe Second. Bla fighted in Polish Army against staff of Pomerans of Baltic Region. That is the reason why he could marry Richeza, Mieszko's daughter. In this marriage were born three sons. Later on two of them Géza The First and László THe First have had become Kings of Hungary. Ladislaus THe Saint(Szent László) has won over the Hungarian and German Army of King Salomon with the help of Boleslav The Second(Audacious) KIng of Poland.\n\nLadislaus THe Saint was born in Poland. According to some sources his mother tongue was polish also. As consequence he became Patron Saint of Hungarian minorities in Poland. Boleslav THe Second(1058-1080), has had been excommunicated by Pope Gregory The Sixth. Boleslav The Second was brother-in-law of Béla The First After that event Boleslav The Second, accompanied by his son, have seeking exile in Hungary. They have been bravely welcomed by Ladislaus THe Saint.\n\nLet us evoque the marriage of Boleslav The Fifth and Kinga. It has happened in the Year of 1239. Boleslav was thirteen years old. Kinga was Hungarian Princess. Princess Kinga was two years older than Boleslav, fifteen years old. Year 1241 was also the Year of devastation of Poland. COuple of Princes, Kinga and Boleslav escaped to Podolin first. From Podolin they exiled to the Castle of Csorsztin at the left side of Dunajec. Prince Boleslav THe Pious of Kujavia married Happy Jolan older sister of Kinga. Both of two marriages influenced Polish-Hungarian relations positively. Both of Polish Princes helped their father-in-law Béla THe Fourth against Ottokár THe Second King of Tchequie in the war.\n\nIstván The Fifth has visited personally Boleslav in Krakowia and allied with him in obstinacy and protection. Károly Róbert(Charles Robert) King of Hungary and Ulászló King of Poland allied. Charles Robert King of Hungary helped Ulászló against Order of Knighthood of Germany. The Year is 1220 when Károly Róbert married Lokietek Erzsébet.(Elizabeth Lokietek). Elizabeth Lokietek was Ulászló's daughter.\n\n1335 is the Year when negotiations of Hungary between János(John) King of Tchequie and Kázmár The Third King of Poland have succeeded. The result of these negotiations have had been strenghtened in November at King Meeting in Visegrád.\n\nJános renounced from the Kingdom of Poland. King of Hungary and King of Poland as judges have had judged that Kujavia and other territories belong to Poland. As judgement of both Kings Pomeran Territories have belonged to Germany. Exactly Territories of Pomerania have belonged to German Knights. Tchequie and Poland could not agree concerning their debates on Silezia.\n\nBefore that political event an economic agreement was signed between Tchequie and Hungary in Trencsén. Aim of this agreement was to stop the right of Vienna of stopping commercial goods. Commercial route of Hungary and Germany must have had gone through Tcheque Territory. THat was the Year of 1339 when Kázmér pointed one of the sons of Károly(Charles) as hereditaire of THrone of Poland. In case if he would die without male hereditaire.\n\nIn the Era of Anjou Kings-Years of Polish-Hungarian Personal Union-cultural agreements between the two countries have had developed and flourished notably.\n\nGoldsmith's craft flourished in both of countries. Bases of flourishing craft art was that Masters have had arrived from Italy to the Royal Court of Károly Róbert.These Masters of craft art worked for the Royal Court of Krakowia also. THey teached new and unknown techniques in Royal Courts to local craftsmen. As consequence local craftsmen opened their workshops.As economical flourishing, at that Era, Hungarian Kingdom have been the richest Kingdom of gold and silver mine treasures.\n\nNagy Kázmér(Kázmér The Great) founded Krakow University. Consequently Hungarian students completed their studies in Krakowia. Monastery of Jasna Góra was founded by Hungarian Monks of Order Pálos in 1380.At that occasion sixteen Monks of Order Pálos travelled from BUda to Czestohowá. During centuries Order of Pálos perished. Consequently in 1934 from Czestohowá to Hungary 16 Monks have travelled to reinforce Order of Pálos.\n\nThere is a legend of three oceans in Hungarian Empire. THis legend comes from Era of Nagy Lajos(Louis The Great) and from Era of Personal Union(1379-1384). This legend is always a legend without any historical background. Hungarian Kingdom has had a gate to Adriatic Ocean. Moldavian Principality bordered Black-Sea. Moldavian Principality has had not been part of Hungarian Empire. After retiring of Golden Horde weakened to the Territories of Moldavia, Louis The First established feoffee with Roumanian Kenézség.\n\nFrontieers of Poland did not reach Baltic-Sea in Years of Personal Union.\n\nDue to fact that Louis THe Great(Nagy Lajos) have had not given sons hereditaires to the world he disposed to throne his oldest daughter Mária after his father death. Heredity have been forced by King and accepted by German Emperor, by Polish Emperors and Anjous. Mária was crowned by Hungarians at Székesfehérvár in 1382 death of Louis THe Great. Mária Governing Era were years of disturbation. She was 12 years old when crowned. She was the first woman to be crowned.\n\nAs Polish Powers did not accept Mária on the Throne, they crowned Hedvig the younger daughter of Louis The Great. Queen name of Hedvig was Jadviga during her kingdom from 1384 until 1399. Due to Jadviga young age(10-12 years old) Polish lords obliged Jadviga to marry Jagello Ulászló Prince of Lithuania. Marriage happened in 1386. As an antecedant Prince Jagello has had christianized. At time of marriage he was crowned and became King of Poland, Jagello Ulászló THe Second. So the Personal Union between Poland and Lithuania composed. As a matter of fact Kingdom of Poland has had become the biggest and powerful State of the region at that Era. When he began his Reign Ulászló The Second was thirty-five years old. He reigned until 1434.\n\nAnjou Hedvig, Jadviga, who reigned as Queen of Poland with his husband until her death. Her great merit was to help Lithuans christianization.SHe contributed to the developement of University of Krakowia also. In Polish mind she lives as a Sacred Personnality. SHe was the Protector Saint of Biecz Early Polsih-Hungarian King City. Biecz played main role in progress of Polish-Hungarian Economic Relationships.\n\nI.1.1. Stanislaw Worcell\n\nLet us mention Stanislaw Worcell also from who the above citation comes.\n\nHis entire name was Stanislaw Gabriel Worcell. His birth place was Stepan THe Region Wolyn. He was born in 26 of March 1799. He died in London at the 3rd of February 1857.Stanislaw Worcell became known as politican, political thinker and public writer, publicist. For Hungary he is important because of that fact of beeing KOssuth Lajos friend and compagne in his London emigration period.\n\nLife of Stanislaw Worcell\n\nBirth place can be found in the present region of Ukraine. He was born after the three distribution of Poland. He originated from Count Family. He studied at Lycee of Kremenyec. Kremenyec School has been founded by Tadeusz Czaczki and Hugo Kollataj. Before the Era of Big Szejm this school was the center hereditaire of civil teaching reforms.\n\nStanislaw Wrocell took interest to contemporary ideas of Europe already in his early years. Main interest was utopistic socialism. He was freemason also. He was member of a masonic lodge. During revolts against Russia in November he fighted in Wolyn in 1830. For his military activity he was rewarded getting the Highest Polish Military Reward, Order Wojenny Virtuti Military.

Stanislaw Worcell got the reward in 11th of August 1831. Stanislaw Worcell was elected to Sejm founded after the revolts.\n\nAfter failure of Revolt of November like members of Great Emigration(Wielka Emigracja) he exiled to France. From France he travelled and stayed in England.He participated in the work of Polish Immigrant Organizations. In the beginning of his emigration he have had influence and membership in the left wing Society of Poland Democratic(Towarzystwo Demokratyczne Polskie) founded on 17th of March 1832. He left this Society in 1835 and he became one of the founders of Lud Polski, Gromady LUdu Polskiego, organization of left wing side, radical. LUd Polski was composed mainly of soldiers. After he was founder of Union Emigrant(Zjednoczenia Emigracji) and finally he returned to Polish Democratic Union.\n\nOne of his friends was in London Giuseppe Mazzini politican Italian. Another frined was Kossuth Lajos with whom they influenced each other.\n\nUnder pseudoname Gryzomir Tukan he was also member of a freemason association.(Towarzystwo SZúbrawców). Towarzystwo Szúbrawcow critised backwardness,contact between nobles and peasants, drunkeness, gambling and antinationalism. He accused nobles of Poland because of problems of Poland. Aims of this Organization were liberation of villeins and reforming lands. Anyway because of too left-wing oriented, members have opposed to members of mainly nobles and isolated themselves.\n\nStanislaw brother was Mikolaj Worcell deported to Caucase in 1827. He has been liberated in 1848 and returned to Poland.\n\nWorcell and Hungary\n\nWorcell was also political thinker. Main idea of his career has been independence of Poland ahd Hungary. Based on his political thoughts, after disorganization of States three political systems will found. THis political region should include France of Western-South Pole, Spain and Italy. Central Region should include Germany and occasionally the Region of Scandinavia. Eastern Region should include Poland, Slavs, Hungary and Roumanians. He visioned a Central and Common State of East to counterbalance strong power of Germany and Russia.\n\nHe disagreed with the fact that that Slav Populations fightod against Hungary during the Revolution of 1848-49. THus they weekened the possibility of an alliance.He considered that both the Federal and Central State can unify populations and living together. Main thing is respect of each other and recognition, liberty.\n\nIn the beginning of years 1850 Kossuth and Worcell thought that Revolution is not yet lost.Eastern -Europe must be upraise.d Worcell became supporter of socaialist revolution. KOssuth recognition gone until recognizing and remedy social problems.Worcell and Kossuth, like Mazzini, wanted to upraise the fire of revolution organizing local conspirations and revolts. During the War of Krím between 1853-1856 they opposed to each other.\n\nKossuth proposed the organisation of Regions of Hungary and Poland. He proposed also to ally with Turkey, France, England and Piemont.\n\nWorcell and Polish people mistrusted Napoleon THe Third and English Prime Minister Palmerston. After fighting down Russia, they did not give help to Poland. Austria allied also to them. Although political debate, Kossuth Lajos stayed friend of Worcell but turned to Ludwik Mieroslawski.\n\nRememberance of Stanislaw Worcell\n\nRememberance of Stanislaw Worcell can be emphasized in his citation above which begins the topic about him. His idea is often recitated in Polish-Hungarian relations.\n\nThe statute remembering to Stanislaw Worcell was initiated in 2006. THe statute was initiated in Győr and the form is two oaks grown together.\n\nAs a gift from the 25 years old Polish Institute in BUdapest in 2014 a wallpainting was created on the wall of a building in Klauzál street in 7th district of the Capital. Form of painting are the two oaks and Worcell citation.\n\nsource:stanislaw worcell-wikipedia text\n\nEra of Zsigmond and Hunyadi\n\nEra of Jagello\n\nJagello Dynasty has been Dynasty of Lithuania. Jagello Dynasty was also a Polish-Lithuanian Dynasty. THis Dynasty played an important role in European and Hungarian history. Beginning of Jagello Era in history can be counted when Jagello Ulászló(Wladyslaw) Prince of Lithuania married Hedvig Queen of Poland. Hedvig was the smaller daughter of King Louis The Great.(Nagy Lajos király). Great merit of Jagello THe First was the victory over the Army of German Knights. For this victory he unified military corps of Poland, Lithuania, Tchequie, Russia, Rutenia, Havasalföld in July of 1410. Victory happened at Grünwald.THis military lost ruined Feodal State.\n\nTIme passing Jagello Dynasty and Hungary were in close relationship. Ulászló THe Second, son of Jagello Ulászló The Second and Anjou Hedvig was crowned by Hungarian Realms in 1440.(Ulászló THe First). He found death in the fights of Várna against Ottomans in 1444. His follower on throne was his younger brother Prince of Lithuania Kázmér The Fourth(Casimir THe Fourth).Casimir THe Fourth reigned from 1444 until 1492.His wife was Elisabeth, daughter of Habsburg Albert King of Hungary. The oldest son of Elisabeth and Casimir has been elected king by Tcheques in 1471. He was elected by HUngarians in 1490. THis king's name was Ulászló THe Second reigning from 1490 until 1516. His first wife was the widow of Hunyadi Mátyás THe First ,the well known King Matthias, Mátyás Király, Beatrix, Princess of Naples. He was followed on throne by the son from second wife,princess of France, Louis The Second(1516-1526). This King died in Fight of Mohács. Death of Louis THe Second Jagellos of Hungary died out. Before diing out the last Jagello was on the Polish Throne KIng Zsigmond The First(1507-1548). His daughter Izabella(Isabelle) has been married by Szapolyai János King of Hungary. Anna another daughter of Zsigmond was married by Báthory István Prince of Erdély.\n\nNext Era to analyze is THe Early Modern Age.\n\nPost Mohács Era\n\nSzapolyai János seeked refuge at Polish Dynasty. Sultan of Ottoman Empire supported him. Main reason of asile seeking of Szapolyai János can be explained of Zsigmond residence in BUda as Prince. During that residence wife, Jagelló Izabella with child János Zsigmond reigned in Transsylvania.(Erdély). In the Era of Reformation Transsylvania(Erdély) became the complex Region of Polish-Hungarian intellectual association. Erdély was the territory of asilum of people who denied THe Holy Trinity. THeir Hungarian name is Unitárius. Strenghtening of Erdély have had been the aim of Zsigmond Ágost King of Poland who reigned from 1548 until 1572. Earlier contacts have been relied on association between Kings of Poland and Princes of Erdély.(Transsylvania).\n\nEra of Báthory István and Rákóczi Dynasty\n\nYear of Reunion of King Election in Warsaw was 1573. THere were four candidates for the Throne of Poland. Báthory István has had no chance. French Henry Valois was elected but he escaped. Reason of his escape was the death of his brother.\n\nIn the newer reunion of election Báthory István got only one vote. Negotiations have began and Báthory promised to marry Jagelló Anna. So in 1576 he was crowned King.He negotiated between Polish groups of nobles. He could reconcile them.He continuosly mentioned the example of broken Hungary into three part. He solidified Republic of Nobles of Poland and inner equilibre worked. His efforts to strenghten power of Kingdom succeded also. All these efforts resulted victorious military expeditions and wealthy economy.He planned to establish an Association of Central-Europe against Ottoman Empire. THis Association would have been the pillar of these wars against Ottomans. After his death this central power destroyed. Final result was the falling apart of Poland.\n\nPrinces of Erdély organized Hungary liberation under Ottoman power asking help from Poland. They saw the example of Báthory István. THese plans aimed their realisations against Habsburgs THe Austrian Empire. THe misadventure of Rákoóczi György THe Second in 1657 shows these facts.\n\nTHököly Imre was helped by a Polish Second Army payed and recruited on French money. THis army counted 2-4000 soldiers. THis army was recruited in 1677 relied on Warsaw Pact.\n\nFrom chasing out of Ottomans until Enlightement\n\nOttoman Empire weakened at the end of 17th century. Breaking down of Ottoman Empire became reality.THis fact was real although Ottomans sieged Vienna in the Year of 1683. Sobieski János THe Third(John Sobieski)(1674-1696) allied with Austrian Empire, so THe Ligue Saint was formed. (Szent Liga)\n\nArmies and corps of SZent Liga chased out Ottomans from Hungary. These fights have been bloody and long fights.Polish Armies played an important role in 1683. THey liberated Párkány and sieged and occupied Castle of Esztergom.\n\nAfter chasing out Ottomans Hungary suffered Habsburg reign.Hungarian insurrectionists called Kuruc in Hungarian found refuge in Poland.Polish land was a reliable shelter for these Kuruc soldiers thanks to contacts between Sobieski and Thököly Imre.\n\nRákóczi Ferenc THe Second escaped from the Prison of Bécsújhely in November of 1701. He refuged to Poland. THere he lived in Warsaw and Krakow. He exiled.His compagne was Bercsényi Miklós.\n\nWhen he returned back to his home country, Polish help came to him. In 1703 he got help from Prince Stanislaw Leszniczki. Prince Stanislaw Leszniczki was the opponent of Rákóczi for the Throne of Poland. Peter THe First Czar of Russia supported Rákóczi.\n\nEpidemie of bubonic plague made Village Derenk extincted in 1711. Counts Eszterházy the possessors of this village settled Polish villains coming from the Region of SZepesség Gorál into Derenk.\n\nDynastic relations disappeared in 18th century. Decrease and the Three Division proceeded. Enlightment and French Revolution and their theses spreaded in both Poland and Hungary. At Eperjes was formed th First Freemacon Lodge. This Lodge was formed by Polish influence . Hungarian Jacobin intellectuals supported reforms of Great Sejm and Kosciusko and mourned lost of Battle of Marcijowice(1794).\n\n19th century\n\nLost of Polish Independence gave new perspectives to Hungarian-Polish relationships. At the begininning of 19th century Poland participated in Napoleon War because Polish people believed the return of the unity of Polish State from Napoleon. Hungarians fighted against Napoleon in Habsburg alliance. Hungarian desire was the \"rainy, silencious springtime and long war\". The Saint Alliance divided Poland at the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Western Parts of Poland having high-economy were annexed to Kingdom of Prussia under the name of Poznan Grand Duchy. Central and Eastern Regions were annexed to Russia under the name of Kingdom of Poland. Gallic Region was annexed to Austria. Ancient Polish Statement was represented by Republic of Krakowia.\n\nPolish people wanted to restore divided Polish State unity. Yeaar of revolt was 1830. At that occasion Counties of Hungary organized bals and donations to help Poland. General Assembly of County Bars asked King of Hungary Ferenc to support Poland in a written request. Young people wore Polish dresses. Lot of people escaped at the frontieer t o fight side by side with Polish revoltants. Opposition leaders Deák Ferenc, Kossuth Lajos, Kölcsey Frenec, Vörösmarty Mihály and Bajza József have taken solidarity with Polish people. Polish revoltants were defeated at Ostrojeka in 1831 by Russian corps. Russian corps occupied Warsowia and bloody repression followed. Polish historical writing science notes political refugees of that revolte as Great Emigration. Revoltants were mainly nobles and soldiers. Less were the intellectuals. Polish refugees got help everywhere. Police of Vienna investigated against subversives.House searches proceeded in lot of places. Later on these investigations stopped because of protests of counties. Consequence was liberty of subersives not arrested by police of Vienna.Such a few stayed in Hungary. THese few stayed mainly at Pest, Bratislava, and in main cities in Highland. Notable Highland city is Bártfa where a subversive niche formed.\n\nPolish Heroes of 1848-49\n\nBoth of Polish and Hungarian Nations brightest historical chapter is the Revolution of 1848-49. In this Revolution fighted Generals Bem József and Henryk Dembinski. Anyway thousands of Polish soldiers and officers partiipated in this Revolution.\n\nPolish populations of Hungary supported also Revolution of 1848-49 in March of 1848. Polish people of Pest organized torchlight procession welcoming representants of Polish Gals coming to Pest and searching relations with actual Governement of Hungary. Leaders of Revolt of Vienna and Poznan exiled to Hungary. Kossuth welcomed Polish soldiers in Hungarian Army. Bem, Dembinsky, Wysocki, BUlharin who amongst others fled to Hungary were well trained soldiers.From Emperor side there were also masses of soldiers fugiitives in Hungary. Such an exemple was Miecyslaw Woroniecki, Prince, who joined with his soldiers the wars of South-Region in Autumn of 1848.. Aim of Polish soldiers was the organization of a legion. General Bem thought Polish military participation within the army.\n\nMilitary corps of BUlharin and Woroniecki fighted in the Army of Damjanich and Görgei. Bem directed Amries of Transsylvania. In springtime of 1849 Kossuth Lajos delegated Dembinski for Commander-in-Chief post. Dembinsiki was fired from this post because of defeat at Chapelle.ALthough Polish armies fighted in important wars.\n\nat Szolnok in 5th March 1849 Ulans of Wadyslaw Poninski\n\nHorse riders of Jagmin of Hatvannai József\n\nUlans at Tápióbicske\n\nKossuth saluted Ulans taking off his hat at Gödöllő. Legion of Poland was founded at 6th of May 1849. Occupation and taking Buda back can be called the baptism of fire.Taking back of BUda was planned to four mililtary corps of Ulans, three walker bataillons,and six artillery battery. In the Army of Bem József in Transsylvania . another Legion has been also organized. It was main in arrest of Russian attack of 1849.Last bataillon of Revolution The Battaillon of Temesvár was lead by Dembinski first. After his blessing Bem took leadershiip.Reprimation of Revolution, Polish populations emigrated.\n\nPolish Martyrs of Hungarian Revolution: Myecislaw Woroniecki, Karol d'Abancourt de Pranqueville, Konrad Kazimiers Rulikowski.\n\nIn the soldiers Army servekd three military judges of Polish origin. THey were Nizsalovszky Andor, Antal and András.\n\nPolsih workers in Hungary\n\nIn Polish of Congress Revolt of January started in 1865. Hundreds of Hungarianas fighted here side by side with Pokish. Eg:Eszterházy Ottó colonel of horse armies, Major Nyáry Ferenc. Although we can cite Lieutenant Wallis Béla or common soldier Hermann Ottó.\n\nAfter the failure of Revolution circa four thousand refugees came in Hungary. Nearly all settlements in Hungary have had a Polish citizen.Millions of Polish people fled mainly Gallic Region. THey travelled mainly to Europe and United States searching work and better life.\n\nFirst waves of Polish immigrants searching work in Hungary reached Hungary in years of 1880. THese Polish found work in industry and construction areas. Polish communities, colonies formed in Budapest, Kassa, Miskolc, Pozsony. In summertimes circa 8-10.000 temporary workers came in.\n\nPolish Cultural Associations formed fast. Polish Associiation of Polish of BUdapest was formed in 1883. SYLA THe Association of Teaching of WOrkers fomred in 1895. Let us cite the Polish clubs and restaurants of that Era.\n\n20th century\n\nEra of Dualism until 1914\n\nMonarchy of Austria-Hungary founded in 1867 has been Bipolar State. Military affairs, foreign affairs, and financial affairs, financing them relied Hungary and Austria. All these departments were directed by delegations of 60-60 individuals. Except this official affairs Hungary owned independence.\n\nForm of State of Hungary has been established. It was Constitutional Monarchy. Emperor Frerenc József (Francois Joseph ) kept hsi powitions. He directed the Army of Monarchy. Settlement between the two counturies did not make the independence certain but gave compromise.\n\nCensus of 1900 recensed 50.182 Polish citizens in Hungary. During the First World War in 1916 their nuber was 36 524. Compared to other nationalities and population their number was very small. Real Plish village colony formed in Kőbánya. Polish workers of Kőbánya worked in factories, porcelaain manufactory, stone-mines, beer factory. In Kőbánya for Polish colonies Polish CHurch has been built.\n\nMiklós Ferndinánd Leó(1889-1968) founded Hungarian-Polish Association.First President of this Association was Baron Nyáry Albert(1871-1933) artist painter and historian. Hungarian-Plish Association founded in the beginning of First World War the Polish Military Comittee. Polish Military Comittee recruited circa thousnand of voluntary soldiers for Polish Legion. VOluntaires fighted side by side with Joseph Pilsudski for Idepenedence of Poland. They stayed in touch with Polish Legions and in 1939 they participated in Second World War also.\n\nDuring Monarchy exigences of Hungarian political leaders concerining territorial unity, Hungarian governing within Hungary, protection against Rusiian and German exigences, could not be supported giving some victims.\n\nEconomic Settlement realised also. Organization of common affairs happened by shares re-negotiated every 10 years. Based on shares of 1867 Hungary contributed to common affairs giving 30 percent of charges. Austria contributed giving 70 percent of charges. Common market of Empire formed, common currency has been introduced. Capital and work force flow was free within the Empire .Tax, Mesure, Mass-Media have been cooriddinatied.\n\nAll these dispositions secured the rapid economic developement of Hungary. THis developement favorised the agriculture, showing fundamentals of the country.\n\nDate of Settlement with Croatia is 1868. According to this Agreement Croatia owned autonomay of interior affairs and territorial affairs. Nation of Croatia was recognized as a Political Nation. Croat language became official language,szábor worked, Parliament of Crioatia delegated 42 representants to Hungarian Parliament. Autonomy of Croatia is an exemple of how to manage optimally and positivly European affairs of Nations. and Nationalities. Anyway Croates started to think or deal about trialism which means three poles of Empire. THese three poles would have been Vienna- BUdapest-Zagreb. Emperor rejected this political ambition like Tcheque ones. Croates rejected the fact that Fiume stayed Hungarian Territory.\n\nPolitics of Nationalities and Minorities in the Era of Dualism\n\nContent\n\nHungarian Politics of Nationalities\n\nHungarians and Nationalities\n\nEthnical minorities -jews and gypsies\n\nSoruces\n\nLife and work of Eötvös József (law of mother tongue for minoriities)\n\nHungarian Politics of Nationalities\n\nThe date is 1868 when Law of using mother tongues for minorities was creatied. THe Law of mother language using for minorities came from Eötvös József. Later on Hungarian govermenemnts deviated from that Law and forced Magyarisation. Main politican forcing Magyarisation was Bánffy Dezső who forcend the name changing of local names.He forced family names changing also. Concerning names of places, later on using Magyaarised names was obligatory and became official. Education was also forced, Hungarian language and Hungairan point of view in history teaching dominated.\n\nAccording to Lex Apponyi of 1907 this Law declared that teaching Hungarian language was obligatory at schools public or private. ones.\n\nHungarians and nationalities\n\nIn the Era of Dualism economic progress raised national ego of Hungarians.At that Era because of immigration of national entities and assimilation of these entities mainly to BUdapest the number of Hungarian population has grown. THis grwoth was without Croatia from 41.5% to 54.5% from 1850 to 1910.\n\nAside Hungarians Croatia has been recognized as a Soveregn Political Nation. THat is why tHe Settlement happened between Hungary and Croatia in 1868.Croatia has had own parliament, could delegate own representants,and became richer with Regions of Frontieer and Slavonia.Germans mostly recognized ans sympathised with Hungarians. Saxons of Transsylvania lost their privilegies so they thought their Gemran identity more important. Aside some smaller fights they cooperated with Hungarians.THis cooperation also targeted against Roumanians of Transylvania beeing in majority in this region.\n\nSituation was very sharpened with Roumanians. They did not support unification of Hungary and Transsylvania. Another Principalities have had unified. THese are Moldva and Havasalflföld. Roumanians of Transylvania desired to unify with these Regions. More lawsuits proceded at that period. Well known was Lawsuit Memorandum in 1892. Roumanians submitted their Memorandum to the Emperor. View the fact that this act meant intervening to Hungary interior affairs Emperor rejected and sent back to Hungarian Governemeent. Memoranum was published and opened to great public. Memorandum hurted nationalities rights..Because of pulblishing Memorandum some persons were arrested and sentenced. Dimitrie Sturdza considered or thought that cooperation between Roumania and Hungary should be necessery but Hungarians s should renounce their desire of magyarisation.\n\nCongress of Nationalities held in 10th of august 1895.Result of this Congress was a common point. Participants of Nationalities were Slovaks, Serbes, and Roumainians.Main point of this Program was the aim to establish autonom counties and language borders. They reclamed the deviation from the Law of 1868. One of the appearances was the citation concerning general, secrecy and d equal ballot. THis endeavour did not realised.\n\nEthnical minorities-Jews and Gypsies\n\nAt that Era because of migration number of Jewish citizens has grown.They gained their legal equal rights in 1867. 1895 was the date when Jewish Religion became equal. Thus jewish emancipation realised. Jewish people had strong religious identity and they identified with Hungarian national identitity. Because of their social situation antisemitism occured. Hungarian antisemitism did not and could not find support within govermenement. Eg:suit of Tiszaeszlár 1882\n\nGypsi population could be hardly defined. Census of this period asked and scanned mother tongues of minorities. Established life became more and more popular amonst romas.Gypsies worked as craftsmen.(eg:profession of smith).\n\nsource: hu.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?\n\ntitle=Nemzetiségi_politika_a_dualizmus_koraban\n\nLife and work of Eötvös József\n\nBaron vásárosnaményi Eötvös József Károly Bertalan Adalbert was born in Buda in September the 3rd on 1813.

His main protector was SZemere Bertalan. After coming home he wrote about necessity of ameliorating prisons.\n\nTHanks to his publications in Parliament of 1840 the affair of ameliorating jails took place. Parliament declared its comittee and Eötvös took place in it.In 1840 he was member of Upper House and parlamental opposition.

In 1841 he published his developed speech. .In his ispeeches he supported Lower House submittings. Sometimes he deviated from his party point of views but he was right. Exemple is religious affairs.\n\nThese affairs were finished based on his oppinion.\n\nThe date was 1841 when Count Széchenyi István attacked Pesti Hírlap the prestigious newspapaer of that era. Baron Eötvös supported Kossuth Lajos and wrote pamphlet \"People of East and Pesti Hírlap.\" He presented himself in Parliament of 1843.

In Békés County where he has had estates could not have chances to be elected. So he renounced. He stayed at home and travelled to Bratislava after the district rassembly of 3rd March of 1848. Thanks to Eötvös the idea of 1848 was a glory. The First Responslble Ministry formed. Eötvös got department of religion and public education.

Hungary suffered of Versailles Treaties. Two-third of Hungarian territores were annexed to neighboring countires so people of these territories became citizens of neighboring countires. Ethnical and political conflicts persist until now as consequences of Versailles Treatites.\n\nHungarian-Ploish frontieer of thousand years come to an end.Treaties of Versailles came with hard economic and international consequences to Hungary. Polish-Hungarian friendship and association weakened.\n\nAt that time social compound and problems of both countures are similar but ideas concerning foreign politics show difference.\n\nPoland centered his efforts to maintain obtained territories (status quo). Hungary endevaured to recapture lost territories. THe point of vue of Hungarian foreign affairs was to convince Plish collegaues about differentate Hungarian peace process and deroulement of other territory arrangements. It was out of condition at that time. Polish thought that peace processes are not independent because in jthis case the system breaks down.\n\nTHere happened some secret diplomatic contact establishements between Poland and Hungary in 1920's s in time of Prime Minister Bethlen István. Success was for Hungary to retain Poland to enter fo Small Antant. Concerning Poland it was neceesary to retain taugh friendship of Hungarian s towards Geramny and also to ease angry reeallationships amongst Hungary and Roumania and also Hungary and Yougoslavia.\n\nMain changes occured in Hungarian-Polish foreign cooperation when in years 1930 evidence occured concerning Hitler aims to parcel territories of Tchecoslovakia. So State of young Tchecoslovakia would have been finished. Relationship concerning State of Tchecoslovakia was the e main foundation of relations between Poland and Hungary. Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs Józef Beck relied on Hungary to establish Alliance \"from ocean to ocean\".Foreign politics of Eduard Benes politican Tchecoslovak has been supported mainly by France.Although leadrship endevouring of Tchecoslovakia stopped Poland plans in Eastern-Europe. THis situation was supported by the fact that economic situation of Poland was less favorable than situaton of Thcecoslovakia. At that Era Thchecoslovakia was an industrially developed country. Standing out of Polish foreign politics was heleped by a Polish-Hungarian \"gentlemen agreement\". This was a non written military-polititcal agreement, alliance. Meaning wanted showing \"succesful polititcal cooperation\".\n\nHungarian and Polish cooperation has been main before 1934 mainly in culture. Later on political visits started also. Such an exemple was the visit in 1934 of Gömbös Gyula and Kánya Kálmán to Warsaw. In 1936 Polish Prime Minister Marian LZyndram-Koscialkowski visited to Hungary. For theat occasion was edited the Polish-Hungary bilingual album. In 1938 Governor Horthy visied to Warsaw. Cultural politics of Klebesberg Kuno played main role in foundation of Polish-Hungarian Cultural Institut. To avoid German agression diplomatic corps of Poland and Hungary coordinated their strategies against Tchequeslovakia.An agreement born in Septemeber of 1938 on handing over of Szudéta Region. This Agreement came from Prime Ministers of England, France, Italy, and Germany. Because Germany needed Szudéta Region peace shoudl have been maintained. Pololand has not been invited to negegotiantions. Region over Olza and Teschen Regions were annexed to Poland.\n\nAccording to the First Decalaration of Vienna Hungarian Army occupied south part of Slovakia where Hungarian population is considerable. The date of occupation was 2nd of Noveember 1938. Military reattachment of Kárpátalja resulted the reassemblement of Polish-Hungarian freontieer.(15th of March 1939). According unspoken of German Governement occupation of these territories happened between the 15th and 18jth of March. Territorial question of Slovakia seemed main question. Good alliance of Beck, ,Prime Minister of Poland, with Slovakia gave reason to the Hungarian Governement of Teleki to prospect annexing Slovakia to Hungary. THis plan crossed Hitler endeavours. Hitler decided to support the Sovereign State of Slovakia. Warranties arrived to Poland about French and English support although Hitler decided to attack. Hitler signed The Fall Weiss Plan on 11th of April. He broke Friendship Contract with Poland that he signed in 1934.Although negotiantions stopped. In month of April German press raises progpaganda activities against Poland. Hungarian people accentued their aversion for German press.Demonstrations and orations highlighting friendship of Poland and Hungary suidted. A vernissage of art is followed in Warsaw attrackting masses. Declaration of Csáky István Minister of Foreign Affairs appeared also in press on 27th of April 1939.\n\nHe ordered Villani Frigyes Ambassador of Hungary in Rome to ripost in case Berlin should ask statement of Hungary.\n\nHungary is allied to German Empire. In case of armed conflict against Poland Hungary does not participate. Not directly nor indirectly. Indirectly means crossing by walk or vehicles the lterritories of Hungary to attack Poland will be rejected.In case Germans menace with agressions and armed attack, Hungarian answer will be armed attack.Alll those who enter to Hungary without premrission are ennemies.\n\nHungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs emphasized the fact that Hungary deoes not want to be part of a German-Polish war.\n\nMain n goal of visite of Prime Minister Teleki Pál and Csáky István Minister of Foreign Affairs was to consolidate Polish situation. Date was April 1939.\n\nRibbentrop outraged because of Plan Axis Rome-Belgrad-Budapest-Warsaw. This plan was edited in German language paper Pester Llyold publeshed in Budapest. Answer of Teleki was mediation between Plish and German. Ribbentrop thought this negotiation not useful. He believed German leading was overwhelming.In case of military demonstration England would betray Pland. Warsaw signed THe Commercial Act Between Poland and Hungary in 29th of April 1939. Consequences were economic losses.THis Act and related facts deepened uncertain political situation of Hungary and governement of Hungary. Germany showed hostility concerning association between Poland and Hungary. To avoid German hostility Budapest made some steps. International Associations manifested for the maintaining of Polish-Hungarian friendship at the Anniversary of Death of Pilsudski. Polish Institute of Budapest opened at Pázmány Péter Scientific University in 26th of May 1939.Openeing was initiated by Polish Governement and got Hungarian support. Hungariana Governemenet did not contract friendship association but he assured abotu it. When reelected Horthy told that law of real friendship relies us to Poland.After a break of century Poland re-became our neighbour.\n\nCsáky István attired the attention of Leon Orlowski Ambassador of Poland in Budapest to the fact of arriving of a crisis in German-Polish relationships.He did not believe that a war will follow. He expounded Hungaian point of view that Hungary would never provoke an armed conflict against Poland.In 24th of July Teleki wrote two letters to Hitler. Hitler dismayed concerning point of view of Hungairan forieng politics.In first letter Teleki accentued Hungary belonging to Axis powers.In second one he emphasized moral reasons. He could not begin war against Poland for moral reasons. Polsih-Hungarian sympahthy manifestations increased such a point that Ernst Woermann Vice-Foreign Secretaaire announced to Sztójay Döme Ambassasor of Hungary the stopping of supplying of some army materials until uncertain point of view of Hungairan Governement. he\n\nAttacks of Luftwavffe against Poland began in 1st of Septemeber 1939 at 4.40 at noon. Five minutes after the attack The War Boat Schleswig-Holstein fired also to Fortresse Westerpalette from Gdansk-Gulf where he stayed on visit of friendship. Mainlaland corps attacked Poland from North, South, , and West.\n\nOn 3rd of September England, Australia,New-Zealand, France, Canada , Norvege declared war to Germany.Governamenet of Poland got only empty promises. Poland stayed alone in war fightings.German Corps reached Warsaw on 8th of Septemeber and fenced the town. Polish citizens fighted with National Soldiers to maintain Warsaw. On 17th of Septemeber Soviet Red Army broke in to Warsaw ac ording to Secret Clause Molotov-Ribbentrop.\n\nSecond Front founded Polish Governement sent his Corps partly to Romania, partly to Hungary. Governement transferred his residence to allied Roumania. In hopeless situation Warsaw sureendered. Prime Minister of Roumania was interned and fled members of departements were also interned. General Headquarters were ordered to stop political activiteies. All this happened for French intention.Wladislaw Sikorski who resided in Paris was charged to create governement. Here established the Polish Geverneent of Emigration After falling of France in 1940 it was transferred to London.\n\nHosting of refugees and organisation of Polish opposition\n\nFollowing the attack of Poland Germany alsways tested friendship of Hungarian Governement towards Poland. On 7th of Septemeber Count Csáky István Minister of Foreign Affairs got denial concerning invasion of Roumania.Csáky renounced the transferring of some territories of Poland. He believed that Hitler planeed to cross Poland.Day was the Septemeber 9 when a phone demand named the railway Kassa-Homonna-Lupko for military corps transferring.Minister Csáky denied to permit. Later Ambassador of Germany in Budapest got a list of it. Hitler did not look at as an ultimatum but time passed he reproached it to Hungary.\n\nFirst Polish refugees crossed Hungarian border individually, in small groups, and in masses between 10-17th of Septemeber. Positive approache of Teleki Governement to civil and military refugees was main because Polish-Hungarian common frontieer and solidarity of Hungarian population wouldn not have been enough.Debates happen on the number of Polish refugees arrived to Hungary. Some estimations take this number to between 100-140 thousand. Other estimations take the number between 50-55 thousand. Different estimations have several reasons. THere are no valuable statistics from first monthes. Lot of people did not stay in Hungary, because oppenness of frontieers between Poland-Hungary and Yugoslavia-Hungary. Counting became more difficult because several person were registered on the same name in lists. THis process was needed because of situation against Germany. SOme point of views tell 70 thousand refugees arrived to Hungary.\n\nGovernement of emigration established in France began to constukrct political and military network to establish miltiary and civil contacts with Poland under military occupation. It was helped by neutralism of HUngary,Roumainia, Yougoslavia and Iraly to Poland.Aim was to establish a combart ready Polish army in France. Illegal military bases establishement began in Roumania, Lihthuania and Hungary.\n\nAbove the military bases of three countries the Hungarian bases survided until the end of war. Their covering names were \"W-set\",\"Romek\",\"Liszt\",\"Pestka\". THeir tasks were maintaining milititary contacts and organise military escape to France.\n\nPolish Refugee Organisations in Hungary had a role between Emigrant Governement and Home Resistance. The date of foundation of Underground Comabat Association Armed (ZWZ) was 13th of November 1939. Later name was Army of Home. Leader who was appointed by Prime Minister iSikorski Kaziemierz Sosnkowski.THis Army served as home froce of governement.\n\nRole of mediation of Esterházy János President of United Hungary Party of Tchecoslovaquia gave possitbility to General Sosnowski to arrive to Ungvár disguised. Targeted visit aimed meeting with Prime Minister Wladyslaw Sikorsiki.He negotiated in Budapest in autumn 1939.\n\nEsterházy János mother Polish Countesse Elzbieta Tarnowska and younger sister with family lived in Polandk. Esterhaházy János took main role in lodging and supplying of refugees of Poland in Hungary. He was member of Parlaoment of Slovakia and enjoying parlamentary privilege he transported Polish people in frontieer of Slovakia-Hungary. Although he helped in arrangement of safe deposit of Polish Treasures in Hungarian National Museum.He also helped of arranging banking deposits in Credit Bank of Hungary.\n\nCaptured or surrendered Polish soldiers to Germans got help from him beause he made use of his contacts with Slovak Authorities.\n\nTo arrange refugee question Polsih Governement cooperated with Teleki Governement from 17th of September 1939.Comittee came several times to Budapest. Members were Kobylansky Chief of Cabinet of Polish Foreign Minister.,President of National Bank of Poland Jerzy Nowak and some officers of governement.As result of negotiantions Polsih-Hungarian Committee of Affairs of Refugees founded.\n\nEvacuation of Polish soldiers and social networking system of Polish refugees\n\nAccording to Deparetement of Military Affairs to date 22nd of Septemeber 1939 fundamental principle was that military refugees from Poland were not considered prisoneers of war.\n\nThey were considered as interned foreigners.They lived as interned in Hungary.\n\nCsáky wrote as follows in his daily report about communication to Ambassador of Poland in Budapest.\n\n1.Transiting soldiers:according to war law we disarm them and take them to intern camps.\n\n2.Civil refugees:we differentiate a:those who supply themselves and b:those who need supply.\n\nCategory a people are treated as any froeigners coming to Hungary. Other categories are placed to refugee camp.\n\nMilitaires interned were taken to worst circumstances then civils.Hundred and forty -one military camps have been suddenly establsihed. Men of the rank and officers of lower grades were accomodated in schools, villages, usine buildings.Field officers were accomodated in separate camps for officers or they lived in sanatoriums, hotels, villas.Number of military camps diminished to twenty-one in half years. Most of soldiers traveled to organizing army in France.\n\nBack to late autumn 1939 evacuation became organized. Earlieer they traveled alone and Comitte of Refugees helped them with documuments and money. Politicans and officers of high-rank travelled. (eg:Kazimierz Sosnowski, Stanislaw Sosabowski future commander of First Independent Parachutiste Brigade).\n\nRepresentation of Polish soldiers functioned in Departement 21 of Ministry of Military Affairs. THis authority was wider than civil one. Second stage of evacuaton began from May 1940 to England because France has been occupied by nazi Germany. Affiars of military refugees were undertaken by colonels Baló Zoltán and later Utassy Zoltán.\n\nDue to fact that between civil refugees there were lot of children and women Teleki Governement implemented social decisions concerning them. Social decisions implemented were executed by IX. Suppling of Poors and General Aid and Social Departement.\n\nKeresztes- Fischer Ferenc Minister of Interior Affairs delegated Antall József Senior to direct the Deplartement.Antall József arranged Polish refugee affairs until nazi occupation of 1944 as attache of Governemenet. Affairs of civils did part of his work officially . In reality he had take care of military intern camps. First part of evacuation finished v civil refugees could take individual supply.\n\nTHey could have daily extra honorairries depending on number of their family members and baded on scolarity. They received aid after their families if they worked. Soldiers got their pay.Hungarian-Polish Comittee of Refugees,Polish-Hungarian Association of Assemblies and Hungarian Red Cross supported refugees from the beginnings Aid was only enough for daily life.Later Polish politicans got out off Hungarian-Polish Committee of Refugees and created Polish Civil Committee.This Committee represented affairs to Governemenmet of Hungary.\n\nSocial support meant not only aids.Main taks were establishment of educational and health systems.\n\nElementary and high-school education: Education had high importance at that period because of 200 high-school students and 300 elementary school lpupils who came to Hungary without parents. Elementary and skilled worker education got official recongnition because of German authorities.High-school and superiior education were not officially recognized. From the autumn of 1940 elementary and high-school are transferred to Balatonboglár and these institutions continue their work under the name Youth Camp. Leader of Youth Camp was Varga Béla parson, representant of Independant Smallholder Parry. THis school was the only Polish language and Polish syllabus school in Europe. Polish Institute kept close contacts with several schools(elementary schools in Kadarkút, Keszthely, Nagykanizsa, Eger, etc.).Education nof Jewish children of Poland and thir living were also resolved.An outstanding exemple was THe Home of Polish Orphelins Officers at Vác.\n\nSuperior Education:Process of Polish students to superior education have had been submittted. Circa 500 Polish students particapated in Hungarian education of colleges and universities.Finishing their studies after the war they returned to home country and have rebuilt intellectual professions.\n\nHealth care system: Medical supporting system was foundeded for Polish Polish refugees. Group of Polish Medical Doctors functioned through Hungarian Red Cross. Polish Military Hospital having 140 beds opened in 1940.\n\nOther hospital departements functioned at Mátraháza, Keszthely and Mátészalka.\n\nCulutural life:Organiuzing cultural life have had strength of curing in regard of refugees. A Polish Journal Wiesci Polskie was edited until German occupation. Aided by Hungarian Miekiewicz Association(founded in 1929) and Polish Institute cultural programs were organized.One of these programs were series of theatre programs.\n\nSecret negotiations-Consequences of German occupation\n\nPolish political and military organizations foundedied in Hungary not only served the aim of nurturing refugees but they constructed an important liaison between Polish emigrant governement and Polish resistance. They filled important mission betewen emigrant governement ztransferring to London and Poland in maintaing tasks. Liaison was resolved taking the help of a well organized messenger service between Budapesnt and Warsasaw and Bubudapest and London.Organization was successful because of help of Antall József Senior in regard of acquisition of passports and permits of living. Diplomatic Messenger Service of é Depeartaement of Foreign Affairs also gave help in transporting Polish reports to London. The Year was 1943 when Kállay Governement established contact with Emigrant Governementmt of Poland. Kállay delegated Varga Bla parson, representant of Independent Smallholder Party to reperesent Hungary symbolically to Polish Governement. In peace negotiations of Hungary, in first part of 1943 Polish Refugee Associations and Diplomatic Corps of neutral countries mediated at British Departement of Foreign Affairs.Turning point was brought by Szegedy-Maszák Aladár, chef of political departemement. He continously and secretely negotiated in Stockholm. Kövér Gusztáv representent of Hungarian Red Cross established contact nearby Polish Ambassy of Lissabon.\n\nKállay Governement thought with chefs of Polish Orgranizations that British-American Military Corps helped by Polish Corps reaching Istrian-Peninsula can advance Soviets and at Region of Balkan reach Hungarian Frontieer.Hungary could have open the gate to Polish Corps towards Poland. ALthough these plans crashed because of German occupation of Hungary in 19th of March 1944 and intervention of Stalin against the plan. Massive arrestations followed and all legal Polish organizations have been wind up.Civil refugees were pursued and refugees were interned to military camps.Lot of them have been transferred to concentration camps and executed. Horthy Miklós intervened at the Delegate based in Budapest of Hungarian Red Cross asking protection for Polish refugees.Although Germans carried off Polish citizens. Hungarian population helped and protected Polish in Hungary and helped them to survive last monthes of war. Lot of them exiled to partisans of Slovakia and Soviets captured them. Years passing they returned to Poland.\n\nAntall József Senior was arrested with Chef Committee of Civil Association Polish.Edmund Fietowicz was executed.During interrogations interrogated Ploish suspects did not give edidence against Antall József.

He served as diplomat and military officer. He was a close associate of Józef Pilsudski. Beck's most famous work is his foreign ministry period. in the 1930s.At that period he largely set Polish foreign policy.\n\nHis dream was to fulfill Pilsudski political vision of making Poland leader of of a regional coaliliton. For that aim he was widely disliked by other governements. Beck has been involved in territorial disputes with Czechoslovakia and Lithuania.Beck sometimes accomodated to Germany and Soviet Union, sometimes he defied these two main but hostile powers. His aim targeted to try to take advantage of their mutual antagonism. THese\n\nnegotiations proved unsuccessful so he formed alliance with Great-Britain and France.Despite mutual agreement these countries did not help Poland effectively.At the tiem of invasion of Poland in 1939 Beck and rest of Polish Governement evacuated to Roumania.\n\nContents\n\nEarly life\n\nForeign minister\n\nStrategic ideas\n\n1939:nazi invasion\n\nWorld War II.\n\nHonors\n\nNotes\n\nSources\n\nEsternal links\n\nEarly life\n\nBeck was born in a Calivnist (Protestant) family whose forbears were Flander emigrants to Poland. These Flander forbears travelled to Poland in 16th cetury during Stephen Báthory rule. At the start of First World War Beck was an engineering student in a College of Engineering. When First World Wer started Beck was member of a clandestine sPolish Military Organization(Polska Organizacja Wojskova POW).POW was founded in October 1914 by Polsudski. Beck joined in 1914 and served until 1917 as an aide of Pilsudksi in the First Brigade of Polish Legions. After internship of the Brigade Beck fledged. Afger Poland regained independence Beck was named Commander of an artillerie battery and assigned to General Staff. Between 1922 and 1923 Beck served as military attache to France. French dislied Beck and spread lies about him.One of these lies was that fBeck was Soviet Agent. He was a part of Coup d'Etat of May 1926 helping Pilsudski to de facto governemental power.\n\nIn between 1926 and 1930 Beck served in Poland Minister of Military Affairs as Chief of Staff. From 1930 until 1932 he was in service of Poland as Vice Prime Minister and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs. In 1932 he took the Office of Minister of Foreign Affairs. Groomed by Polsudski he implemented Poland's foreign policy.He took Minister of Foreign Affairs Office until outbreak of Second World War.\n\nForeign Minister\n\nBeck was known as as weak handedd.Accordidng to historian David G.williamson Poland had a large population fwith 35 million pople but thin industrial base. Poland had an army of 283.000 soldiers and was poorly-equipped, short of artilleery and poorly trained.Due to fact of missing mechanization it relied on its cavalry. Final problem that came in has been facing the two leading dictatorships of that Era:USSR of Stalin and Germany of Hitler. Let us us cite the oppinion of historian Richard Overy.\n\nPoland, according to Overy was the most disliked country and Beck the most distrusted Foreingn Minister. Poland's purisuit of independence left close freiends behind by the end of 1938.For Western countries Poland became a greedy revidionist, anti-Semitic,pro-German country. Minister Józef Beck was an arrogant and treacherous \"menace\".\n\nIn Poland foreign politics Beck maintained a fine balance between USSR and Germany. THis politic meant anyway the conclusion of non-agression pacts . Soviet Union and in January 1934 with Germany. (german-Polish Non-Agression Pact).\n\nBeck compalined because of respective Plish minorities in Germany and Soviet Union were not enough protected.Although Beck resented also because Germany took The Minorities Treaty to intrude to internal affairs of Poland and to pressurise.In Septemeber 1934 Józef Beck renouneced the Minorities Treaty after admission of Soviet Union to the League o\n\nWhen Pilsudski died in May 1935 a power-sharing agreement entered by. various factions near to Pilsudksi. Led by General(Marshal) Edward Rydz-Smigly,President Ignacy Moscicki and Józef Beck. These three politicans effectively dominated Sanacja(Sanation)and ruled Poland Poland until the beginning of Second World War. Beck got more or less free hand to ledad Poland foreign policy. THe stability of the ruling triad weekened. None of the three men of the state could assert his dominance in late 1930s. THis weird oligarchy betweewn 1935-1939 and political situation established by them is often described as \"dictarorship without a dictator\".\n\nStrategic ideas\n\nBeck showed hostility to the League of Nations and not believed in help. France forced soem arrangements with Poland but mistrutsted Beck.So Bek investigated into new possibilities. He explored Polsudlski concerpt of Myedzimorze (\"Between-seas\"). THis starategy meant the foudndation of a federation of Central and East-euroepaean countries. In first view this Federation would stetch from the Baltic to the Black Seas. In later variatnts from Arctic Ocean to Mediterranean. A coalition between Germany in the West and Soviet Union in the East might have been strong enough to avoid military invterviention. Anlthough Beck realized the unpossibility of buoilding such a Federation for the immeidate future.Therefore, he was prepared to settle for a diplomatic bloc refered to as \"Third Europe\". THis project would have been led by Poland and might become might the nucleus of Myedzimorze federation. Beck's '\"Third Europe\" diplomatic concept included Poland, Italy, Yugoslavia, Hungary and Romania.These efforts failed. THere are several reasons :\n\n-Italy and Hungary aligned themselves with Germany not with Poland\n\n-Dispute between Romania and Hungary decreased efforts to reassamble them in a bloc. Subject of dispute was Transsylvania.\n\n-The desire of Italy and Hungary to partition Yugoslavia between the two blocked any effort to include Rome, Budapest and Belgrade in an alliance.\n\n-None of the othir four states were interested to form the \"Third Europe\" with Poland.\n\nBetween 1935 and 1939 Beck supported German claims against Czekoslovakia.He cited purported mistereatement of Polish minorities in this country.The year was 1937 when he began his diplomatic offensive in favor of Slovak independence .He suupproted Hitler in regard of Munich Agreement in 1938. Within days Poland occupied and seized Teschen the industrial district of Czechoslovakia with many ethnic Poles.\n\n1939:Nazi invasion\n\nIn 1937 Hilter continously assured Beck that Germany had no claims on Danzig. Although in early 1939 Hitler changed his position and claimed on Danzig without military agression. Beck role was main in early 1939 wehen he staunchly refused Hitler's demands to subordinate Poland to Germany's puppet-state.Hitler demand aimed Poland entrance to Anti-Comintern Pact directed against Soviet Union. Bek rejected Hitler demands to annexe Polish Pomorze(Pomerania). This act would have cut off Polish access to the sea. It would have cut the main trade road also. In this case Poland would have been dependent on Germany.He also refused demands for an extraterritorial rail and highway corridor to run to East Prusiia and Free City of Danzig. In exchange vague promises assured Beck regarding trade and annexation of territories lived by Ukranans and Beloriusiians after a future war. Hitler planned to annex Poland for several year, s hed decided to realisze his war lplans by early September 1939.\n\nBeck was surprised on Britain reatcion to defend Poland from German attack . Britain communicated his annonce by the end of March 1939. France also offered his support.There was very little help to offer in case of German attack.\n\nIn April 1939 Beck negotiataed in London terms of British-Polish aid treaty. Beck orated his his refusal of German demands in his speech of 5 May 1939:\n\nHe told that peace is precious and desirable. Theri generation who lived and bloodied in wars will deserce peace. According to Beck peace has its high and mesurable price. Polish do not know the concept of peace at any price. Only one thing is is without lprice in lives of men, nations and countries. That thing is honor.\n\nAlthough Beck also refused Soviet forces to enter Poland. During talks the Polish side did not take part.In case Ploand would be endagered British aid proposal came.It formulaed a support to Polish Governemenet.At that time Beck accepted that lproposal.According to to Joseph E.Davies, the Polish Governement underestimated military power and danger of Germany.\n\nIn August 1939 the well known Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact secured the alliance between Adolf Hiltler and Vissarionoitch Dsugasvili Stalin. It secured Soviet support in a war,a heavy flow of Soviet oil and food. It also highlighted an atreement to partition Poland and the split up of Baltic States. By this stage imminent war between Germany and Poland came to evidence.\n\nWOrld War II\n\nWhen Germany invaded Poland on 1st of Septemenber 1939 Poland and Beck called France and Britain to secure Poland.In spite of help they refused to give direct help. Both of them declared war two days after German invasion against Poland. Soviet attack came from East on 17th of Septemeber 1939.Beck withdrew to Romania with ther rest of Polish governement.\n\nRomanian authorities interned Beck in a hotel in Brasov. There he wrote his memoirs Ostatni raport(Flinal Report).\n\nPopular Polish journalist Melchior Wankowicz interviewed Józef Beck in autumn of 1939 during his internement in Romania.\n\nBeck was locked in a golden cage of a luxurious hotel in Brasov. He and his team occupied oen floor. He got strong guard.When he went out to to the street German and Romainan agents followed him. During the interview Beck emphasized his achievements of last month. A military treaty with England, refusal of Hungary to let German German troops traversing Hungarian land, droit der residence, droit de pasasge granted to him by Governement of Romania. Beck believed in a solid coalition and that Poland would negotiate while Czechoslovakia would remain out. He did not take care of Lloyd George statement that Poland as a reactionary country did not deserve help. Lord Halifax aimed to recreate Curzon Line although this fact did not frustrate Beck.He highlighted that when King of Great-Britain gave gave a radio speech only English, French, and Polish anthems were played.\n\nHe negotiated with Hitler several times. According to Beck Hitler was influenced by von Ribbentrop. H\n\nJózef Beck died in Singureni Romania on 5 June 1944.He caught tuberculosis. His son Andrzej Beck survidved him. Andrzej Beck played an active active role in the Polish community in United States until his death of 2011.\n\nBeck's remains were repatrieated to Poland and interred at Warsaw Powazki Military Cemetery in May 19k91.\n\nSource:Wikipedia Józef Beck\n\nTeleki Pál (politican)\n\nSzéki gróf Teleki Pál (count) full name Teleki Pál János Ede was born in Budapest Austria--Hungarry in 1st of November 1879.Hed died in Budapest Hungarian Kingdom on 3rd of of April 1941.\n\nHe was born into Noble Tlekeki Family.
