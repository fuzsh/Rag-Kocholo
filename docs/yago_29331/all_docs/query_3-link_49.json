The aim of the paper is to present Mieszko III not so much as a politician, a ruler, but as the head of the family, also in a broader sense, as a nestor of the Piast family. What is important is that all of Mieszko’s children have happily survived their childhood, which is a peculiar phenomenon, taking into account the high mortality rate of children in the Middle Ages. Six of them died while their father was still alive. The paper will attempt, difficult due to the specificity of the preserved source material, to present the everyday life of the prince’s family, will present the meanders of dynastic politics, realized with the help of arranged marriages, and will finally touch upon the issues of material and court culture.",
