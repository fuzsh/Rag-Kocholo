Also Odon apparently hoped to enlarge his domains, perhaps even so far as to obtain the Duchy of Greater Poland by force. His uncle Casimir II the Just, offered him only Poznan. Odon pursued the war against his father until 1178, when Mieszko III was forced to abdicate and flee.\n\nIn 1181 Miesko III returned to the country and with the aid of the Pomeranians, regained the control over Greater Poland and Poznan from his son Odon. One year later, was made an agreement between father and son: Odon received a little portion of Greater Poland south of the river Obra (however, some historians believed that he remained in the Greater Poland capital until his own death). After Odonâs younger brother Mieszko the Younger died on 2 August 1193, Odon obtained the Duchy of Kalisz, with the consent of his father.\n\nLittle is known about Odon's government over Kalisz. However, he founded a mint, and coins have been found bearing the inscription \"Odon Dux\" (\"Duke Odon\"), suggesting a high degree of autonomy.\n\nOdon died on 20 August 1194 and was buried in the Cathedral of Poznan.\n\n[edit] Marriage and issueAbout 1184[1] Odon married with Viacheslava (d. aft. 1200), daughter of Yaroslav Vladimirovich \"Osmomysl\", Prince of Halych.[2][3][4][5] They had four children:\n\n1.Wladyslaw Odonic (b. ca. 1190 - d. 5 June 1239).\n\n2.Ryksa (b. ca. 1191 - d. 18 November aft. 1238).\n\n3.Euphrosyne (b. ca. 1192/94 - d. 23 August 1235), married ca. 1225 to with Duke Swantopolk II of Pomerania.[6]\n\nSince Odon's son Wladyslaw was too young to reign, Odon bestowed the regency of his duchy in the south of Greater Poland upon his half-brother Wladyslaw III Spindleshanks, while Miesko III reclaimed the Duchy of Kalisz.\n\nNote on Wife: Viacheslava\n\nViacheslava of Novgorod (Polish: Wierzchoslawa Nowogrodzka; b. ca. 1125 - d. 15 March by 1162?), was a Kievan Rus' princess member of the House of Rurik and by marriage Duchess of Masovia and Kuyavia and High Duchess of Poland since 1146.\n\nShe was the daughter of St. Vsevolod, Prince of Novgorod and Pskov by his wife, a daughter of Svyatoslav Davidovich, Prince of Chernigov.[1][2]\n\nNothing is known about Viacheslava's first years; she was one of the children of her parents and their only daughter. She had two brothers, Ivan and Vladimir (who was confused in several sources as husband of Princess Richeza of Poland). Both died unmarried and apparently childless.\n\nAround 1137 she was married with Boleslaw, son of the Polish Duke Boleslaw III Wrymouth. The wedding was probably orchestrated by Boleslaw's mother Salomea of Berg, who wanted to secure a Russian alliance against her stepson, the later Wladyslaw II the Exile. On 11 February 1138 Prince Vsevolod died and on 28 October of that year Duke Boleslaw III also died, leaving in his will his domains divided between his sons. Prince Boleslaw received the Masovian state as Boleslaw IV, Duke of Masovia and Kuyavia, and Viacheslava became in the Duchess consort.\n\n[edit] Duchess of Masovia and Kuyavia, High Duchess of Poland. DeathIn 1141 Viacheslava accompanied her husband at the meeting of Leczyca, convened at the initiative of her mother-in-law Dowager Duchess Salomea. In 1146 Viacheslava became in the new High Duchess of Poland when her husband expelled his older half-brother Wladyslaw II and became in the ruler of KrakÃ³w and High Duke of Poland.\n\nViacheslava probably died during the 1160s, because by 31 December 1167 High Duke Boleslaw IV named his second wife Maria. She probably was buried beside her husband in the Plock Cathedral.\n\n[edit] Duchess Anastasia's Gospel BookAfter Viacheslava's death, her husband gave to the cisternian monastery a Gospel Book bound in silver on her memory, called the Duchess Anastasia's Gospel Book. Anastasia was probably the Latin or Greek equivalent of her name, according the message of chronicler Jan Dlugosz. Also, he named Viacheslava Princess of Halicz and placed her death in 1158 during childbirth. The wedding date of 1151 given by the chronicler is incorrect. The Gospel Book was probably made around 1160.\n\n[edit] IssueAccording to almost all the known sources, Viacheslava gave birth her first child around 1156, after almost twenty years of marriage. This child, a son, was named Boleslaw after his father and grandfather. Before 1160, she bore a second child, a daughter, later wife (1178) of Vasilko Iaropolkovich, Prince of Shumsk and later of Dorohychyn.\n\nEarlier literature stated that Boleslaw IV's second son Leszek was born from his second marriage with Maria; however, after the discovery of coins upon which Leszek called himself son of Anastasia, this theory proved to be inaccurate.[3]\n\nPrince Boleslaw died in 1172 aged sixteen, and reportedly his father was devastated by his early death. One year later (1173), High Duke Boleslaw IV died, leaving his Masovian-Kujavian principality to his second and only surviving son Leszek, at the age of eleven or less. As overlord and holder of KrakÃ³w and Gniezno, he however was succeeded by his next brother Mieszko III the Old, Duke of Greater Poland."
