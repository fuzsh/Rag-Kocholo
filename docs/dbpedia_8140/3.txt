T. L. Eliotâ€™s The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrockis popularly known as a modernist poem with experimental diction, style and versification. This paper analyses metaphysical conceits and antithesis in the title and in its contents. This poem is not a love song or romance any way, but psychoanalytical details of suppressed desires in stream of consciousness form. It is a mock heroic poem, imitating the style of heroic literature in order to satirize an unheroic character of Alfred Prufrock.
