The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock, dramatic monologue by T.S. Eliot, published in Poetry magazine in 1915 and in book form in Prufrock and Other Observations in 1917. The poem consists of the musings of Prufrock, a weary middle-aged man haunted by the feeling that he has lost both youth and happiness: “I have measured out my life with coffee spoons.”

“Prufrock” was both Eliot’s first major publication and the first masterpiece of modernism in English. Eliot’s experiment with poetic form, metre, rhyme, and voice was a radical departure from the restrictions of established forms and diction.
