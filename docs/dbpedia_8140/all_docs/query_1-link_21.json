This trip shows us the beautiful and complex stories that different times in history—like the Victorian era, Modernist period, and Postmodernist times—have told us, each with their own special way of looking at the world and the people in it. By reading works like \"Break, Break, Break\" by Alfred Lord Tennyson, \"The Mark on the Wall\" by Virginia Woolf, and \"If I Was President\" by Alice Walker, we get a wide view of how writing has changed over time, and how it mirrors the spirit of its age.\n\nDuring the Victorian era, Alfred Lord Tennyson's poem \"Break, Break, Break\" captures the spirit of this time beautifully. It's a sad poem that talks about losing someone and reflects on how nature and life keep going, no matter what. Tennyson wrote this poem as the Industrial Revolution was changing everything, making it a touching piece about personal loss against the big changes happening in the world. The image of waves constantly crashing against rocks is used to show how time keeps moving forward, capturing the Victorian love for nature's beauty and everlasting truths. As Poet Laureate, Tennyson mixed personal feelings with bigger, universal ideas, showing the depth of emotion and careful thought that marked writing from this era.\n\nSome verses from \"Break, Break, Break\" highlight the poet's yearning to express the ineffable thoughts stirred by the sight and sound of the sea, contrasting the ongoing activities of the fisherman's boy and the sailor lad with his own sense of loss and longing for the past. Tennyson captures the essence of human sorrow and the longing for a connection that has been severed by death, encapsulated in the lines longing for \"the touch of a vanished hand, And the sound of a voice that is still.\"\n\nAfter World War I, which caused a lot of destruction, Modernism started to change how stories were told. It began to show life's chaos through broken, mixed-up storytelling. Virginia Woolf's story \"The Mark on the Wall\" is a perfect example of this. Instead of telling a story the usual way, it follows the writer's thoughts as they flow and change, all starting from a small mark on the wall. This leads to deep thoughts about time, memory, and what it means to exist. Woolf explores how we think and what we know, fitting with Modernism's focus on personal inner experiences and how confusing the world can be. Woolf's writing was a big change from the more orderly and clear writing of the Victorian era, showing a new way to talk about the complicated and sometimes conflicting thoughts and feelings we all have.\n\n\"Oh! dear me, the mystery of life; The inaccuracy of thought! The ignorance of humanity! To show how very little control of our possessions we have—what an accidental affair this living is after all our civilization—\"\n\nThis quote illustrates the narrator's profound contemplation on the nature of existence, sparked by the seemingly trivial observation of a mark on the wall. It encapsulates the Modernist emphasis on the subjective experience of reality and the complexity of human consciousness. Through this reflection, Woolf delves into the themes of life's transitory nature and our limited understanding of it, highlighting how the minutiae of everyday life can lead to expansive philosophical inquiries.\n\nPostmodernism is all about celebrating differences and asking big questions, and it doesn't always believe in one single story that explains everything. Alice Walker's poem \"If I Was President\" perfectly shows what Postmodernism is all about. It mixes reality and imagination through a pretend chat with famous people, challenging what we think is normal and questioning who holds power. Walker talks about wanting change and how writing can help make that change happen. This is different from earlier writers like Tennyson and Woolf, who mostly looked inside themselves. Walker's poem is like a loud call to get up and do something, showing how Postmodernism encourages us to think about who we are, the power we have, and how stories and poems can play a big role in changing society.\n\nThe quote from Alice Walker's \"If I Was President\" — \"And why? Because knowing the country that I'm in, as you are destined to learn it too, I know wrong when I see it\" — encapsulates the speaker's moral conviction and proactive stance against societal injustices. By asserting the ability to recognize and confront \"wrong,\" the poem highlights the importance of moral leadership in addressing and rectifying societal issues. This call for awareness and action challenges the status quo and urges a reevaluation of accepted norms, making it a powerful statement on the responsibilities of leadership in effecting change.\n\nGoing from Tennyson's sad poems, through Woolf's deep stories, to Walker's lively comments shows how the way people write and think about things has changed over time. Each writer was deeply connected to the society, culture, and big ideas of their own time and wrote about what mattered then. Tennyson talks about dealing with loss and how nature keeps going no matter what, Woolf takes us through the complex paths of her thoughts, and Walker stands up to the big rules and ideas that society is built on. Their writings take us on a journey from personal feelings and thoughts to bigger discussions about society and politics.\n\nLooking at these stories shows us not just how each time period was different, but also what they all share—like how stories always try to dig deep into what it means to be human, question the way things are, and describe the complex world we live in.

As we keep reading and writing, the legacy of these authors encourages us to think deeply, question bravely, and imagine a better world. This passage encapsulates the transformative power of literature across different epochs, illustrating how it continuously reflects societal values and challenges, and molds individual and collective consciousness. Through the varied lenses of these authors' works, we gain not only historical insight but also inspiration to use narrative as a means of understanding and influencing the human condition.\n\non Apr 08 2024 11:04 PM PST edit\n\nRead more →\n\nDeleted: Guardianoflove99 - \"The Yellow Wallpaper\" by Charlotte Perkins Gilman: The story follows a woman who is prescribed a \"rest cure\" by her physician husband for her supposed nervous condition. Confined to a room with yellow wallpaper, the protagonist becomes increasingly obsessed with the pattern and begins to hallucinate a woman trapped behind the wallpaper, eventually descending into madness.\n\n\"The Mark on the Wall\" by Virginia Woolf: The narrative consists of a stream of consciousness monologue in which the narrator reflects on the significance of a mark on the wall of their room. As the narrator's thoughts meander through various topics, they contemplate the nature of reality, perception, and the passage of time.\n\n\"If I Was President\" by Alice Walker: The poem presents a hypothetical scenario in which the narrator imagines themselves as president and envisions the actions they would take to advocate for social justice and liberation, particularly for political prisoners.\n\nExemplification of Literary Periods:\n\n\"The Yellow Wallpaper\" (Late 19th-century American Literature/Realism):\n\nThemes: The theme of mental illness and the repression of women's autonomy and agency within patriarchal society are central to the story.\n\nSymbol: The yellow wallpaper symbolizes the protagonist's mental and emotional confinement, as well as the oppressive constraints of her societal role as a wife and mother.\n\nPoint of View: The story is narrated from a first-person perspective, allowing readers to directly experience the protagonist's descent into madness and the oppressive nature of her confinement.\n\n\"The Mark on the Wall\" (Modernist Literature):\n\nThemes: Themes of perception, reality, and the passage of time are explored through the narrator's introspective musings.\n\nMotif: The mark on the wall serves as a recurring motif that prompts the narrator's philosophical reflections and symbolizes the mysteries and uncertainties of life.\n\nPoint of View: The story is narrated from a first-person perspective, with a stream of consciousness style that immerses readers in the narrator's internal thoughts and perceptions.\n\n\"If I Was President\" (Contemporary Literature/Postmodernism):\n\nThemes: The poem addresses themes of social justice, activism, and the fight against systemic oppression, particularly within the context of incarceration and political imprisonment.\n\nMotif: Motifs of solidarity, resistance, and unity are prevalent throughout the poem, emphasizing the importance of collective action in advocating for change.\n\nPoint of View: The poem is narrated from a first-person perspective, with the protagonist imagining themselves as president and envisioning the actions they would take to address social injustices.\n\nComparison and Contrast:\n\nThemes: While each text addresses themes of confinement and oppression, \"The Yellow Wallpaper\" focuses on the confinement of women within patriarchal society, \"The Mark on the Wall\" delves into the confinement of the mind and perception, and \"If I Was President\" explores the confinement of political prisoners and the fight for social justice.\n\nSymbolism: The yellow wallpaper in Gilman's story symbolizes mental and emotional confinement, the mark on the wall in Woolf's narrative symbolizes the mysteries of life and perception, and the presidency in Walker's poem symbolizes power and agency in advocating for social change.\n\nPoint of View: All three texts employ a first-person perspective, but while \"The Yellow Wallpaper\" and \"The Mark on the Wall\" utilize it to immerse readers in the protagonists' subjective experiences, \"If I Was President\" uses it to present the protagonist's imagined actions and aspirations.\n\nIn summary, while all three texts share themes of confinement and oppression, they differ in their specific focus and treatment of these themes. \"The Yellow Wallpaper\" and \"The Mark on the Wall\" exemplify characteristics of realism and modernism, respectively, through their exploration of individual psychology and societal norms. Meanwhile, \"If I Was President\" embodies postmodernism through its focus on social justice activism and its blending of personal and political narratives.\n\non Mar 26 2024 12:04 AM PST edit\n\nRead more →"
