        "text": "In his poem \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\", Eliot shows the sordid and aimless modern life. He shows the inner conflict, duality, disintegration and irresolution of the modern man. Eliot seems to say that modern life has been devoid of purpose and there is no spiritual direction. Thus although the title of the poem indicates a romantic love situation, it is used ironically by the Poet. Eliot does not sing any romantic love song in this poem. Rather his notion is quite anti-romantic. The ridiculous name Prufrock' is not entirely whimsical, it is said to have been derived from the name of a furniture dealer in St. Louis. Prufrock would like to speak of love to a woman, but he does not dare. A critical examination of the poem would reveal that it records Prufrock's recoil from love rather than his engagement in love.\n\nThe opening of the poem reveals the irony of title. Here Prufrock says,\n\n\"Let us go then, you and I,\n\nWhen the evening is spread out against the sky\n\nLike a patient etherised upon a table;"
