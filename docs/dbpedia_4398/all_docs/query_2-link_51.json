        "text": "In this area of radio dessert, I found your column. It seems the world is tuned into TV, but I love the radio. I listen to Art Bell late at night when I can't sleep, and I have spent many pleasant hours listening to Clark Howard and his good sense as I travel around the community. But HE's GONE! I get this stock program (and after the blow I took, I hate the market), \"Phil's Gang.\" And to top things off, I can't find a phone listing for station WQSR or 1220. WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO CLARK? Help! -- Sincerely, D.R.\n\nDear D.R., Radio Babe isn't among the TV-tuned, and is glad you found her, too.\n\nHowever, she hardly considers our area's radio menu to be a \"dessert\".\n\nIn fact, she barely thinks it is a satisfactory hors d'oeuvre most of the time, what with repetitious songplay between the similar-sounding stations, idiotic attempts at \"humor\" mistaken for edgy coolness by mediocre on-air hosts, and an over-abundance of hate-and anger-spewing AM talkers, which are among R.B.'s airwave disappointments.\n\nYes, after trolling Southwest Florida's often-barren radio \"desert\" (what she assumes you meant), R.B. is parched.\n\nPer your 1220 AM dilemma: Its call letters have been \"WIBQ\" (www.1220WIBQ.com) since March 2002, which may explain your difficulty finding a telephone listing.\n\nNova Broadcasting Co. runs the station remotely from its Colorado operations center, and can be reached locally by calling WIBQ at 330-8626.\n\nIt features several brokered talk programs similar to the \"Phil's Gang Stock Talk\" program you reference (among national talk selections), which airs 3-5 p.m. weekdays during a portion of consumer advocate Clark Howard's (www.ClarkHoward.com) live broadcasts (1-4 p.m. weekdays).\n\nThat explains Howard's seeming disappearance. However, the financial/consumer-minded host does dispense his cost-cutting advice and solutions on WIBQ following the S.T. gang, 5-7 p.m. weekdays.\n\nWIBQ's out-of-state operation is only temporary. It is entering a new ownership and licensing agreement at the end of January with Suncoast Broadcasting.\n\nStay tuned for details of local programming and the new Main Street Sarasota studio location, where pedestrians can watch the live broadcasts.\n\nBEAT BITS -- The new 95.7 FM \"The Beat\" R&B/hip-hop station, formerly WSSR, has taken the call letters WBTP.\n\nJomama Johnson's \"Quiet Storm\" slow R&B show is aired from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. Sundays to Thursdays, gone from WFLZ 93.3 FM -- and Johnson is The Beat's new program director. (See www.957theBeat.com.)\n\nThanks go out to WFLZ's weekend jock Brian Holmes, who pointed out Johnson was program director and afternoon voice at Fort Myers stations WBTT 105.5 FM (also called \"The Beat\") as well as smooth jazz WDRR 98.5 FM.\n\nCIAO FROM CLEAR CHANNEL -- Active rocker WXTB 98.7 FM (98ROCK) night guy Fletch has left the building for good. Although he also was voicetracking nights at Salt Lake City's alternative station KCPX, he's hunting for a new job, unexpectedly.\n\nDirect queries and comments to Radio Babe c/o the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, P.O. Drawer 1719, Sarasota, FL 34230, or e-mail dawnzig@hotmail.com. Answers will appear in this forum only. Radio station listings appear in the Herald-Tribune's Sunday Click TVGuide publication."
