        "text": "Dear Radio Babe,\n\nThis FM station (89.7) used to call itself Dove Radio. At 7:30 each morning, host Frank Benny posed a trivia question. The winner used to get two free breakfasts at Mel's Diner. I won 26 times! Humorous news commentary was provided by Grant Hudson and traffic was reported by a pleasant-sounding Jewel. All of a sudden, without a word of explanation, this station became the \"More Music\" station. Dove was gone, Benny, Hudson and Jewel were gone, as was Mel's Diner. Please research this and tell us what happened in your column. Thanks. -- F.M.S., Ph.D.\n\nDear F.M.S., Ph.D., The 89.7 frequency you mention has long been occupied by WUSF, Tampa's 41-year-old, nonprofit, non-commercial University of South Florida public station, which airs classical and jazz programming.\n\nRadio Babe suspects you are referring to WDDV (92.1 FM), formerly known as \"The Dove,\" now called \"Today's Easy Favorites.\"\n\nIt added more contemporary artists such as Celine Dion, Phil Collins, Lionel Ritchie, Sheryl Crow, Eric Clapton and the like, in addition to the inclusion of \"All New More Music Mornings,\" with program director Dave Harrell hosting weekdays.\n\nHowever, R.B. is utterly baffled that you can't find Mel's Diner -- especially after at least 26 meals there! -- since it's still in Sarasota at 3740 Bee Ridge Road (923-6070); Bradenton, 1313 Cortez Road (752-5833); Venice, 1763 S. Tamiami Trail (408-8157); Port Charlotte, 1789 S. Tamiami Trail, (743-0055); Fort Myers, 4820 Cleveland Ave. (239-275-7850); Bonita Springs, 28601 Trails Edge Blvd. (239-949-3080); Naples, 3650 Tamiami Trail (239-643-9898) and 12035 Collier Blvd. (239-255-4242); and in Tampa, 2101 E. Fowler Ave. (813-977-5777).\n\nDear Radio Babe, Wanted to let you know I will be hosting \"Doug Miles' Big Band Files and All That Jazz\" on WIBQ (1220 AM) Sundays from 7-9 p.m.\n\nIt features big band music (Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw, Tommy Dorsey, etc.) and American Popular Standards (Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald) as well as new jazz artists (Diana Krall, John Pizarelli). We'll also have live performances by local jazz musicians.\n\nI also co-host the Suncoast Morning Magazine (www.suncoastmagazine.com) heard M-F 7-10 a.m.\n\nThanks. -- Doug Miles\n\nDear Doug, It's almost as if you'd read Radio Babe's mail in planning the \"Doug Miles' Big Band Files and All That Jazz\" since at least half of R.B.'s readers clamor for these music styles on a regular basis.\n\nThey'll be delighted.\n\nAlso of note are the Suncoast Morning Magazine's other co-hosts, Bradenton's Jessica Skyy, the show's producer; and former 1220 head honcho (the Rev.) Bob Bierman.\n\nThe live, call-in show also features local politicians and celebrities together with news, weather, sports (by Ted Fleming), arts, and entertainment and comedic intervals, in addition to area guest hypnotherapist Keith O'Neill daily, beginning at 7 a.m.\n\nE-RADIO WEEKLY -- Former WFLZ (93.3 FM) DJ Brian Holmes writes, \"Wanted to drop you a line to remind you to check out www.ThePowerPig.com, an online tribute to legendary CHR WFLZ.\n\nThe May 12 launch of the new site received national coverage on radio.about.com (story is at: http://radio.about.com/cs/1/a/aa051604a.htm) and allaccess.com.\n\nThe site got 1,900 hits in the first 36 hours and more than 200 e-mails the first week. And we quickly became a partner site with Radio-Info.com. You'll see us listed right there on the main homepage.\n\nAlso interesting to note: Sept. 25 of this year marks the 15th anniversary of Power 93, the Power Pig's debut and the debut of the CHR format on WFLZ.\n\nJust 71 days later, an all-time ratings record, the Power Pig had already beaten its direct competition Q105 and had taken over the No. 1 spot.\n\nTake a look, I think you'll be shocked by how in-depth the site is. (I swear I wouldn't push this hard if I didn't think it was worth your time and coverage).\"\n\nR.B. agrees the site is an impressive undertaking, and also recalls listening the Power Pig long before she lived here, while on vacations -- the station made that much of an impression!\n\nShe remembers comical jocks and fresh music mixing dance-y rap tunes along with hair metal (because those were popular genres at the time). One never knew what was coming next.\n\nThanks for the memories.\n\nDirect queries and comments to Radio Babe c/o the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, P.O. Drawer 1719, Sarasota 34230, or e-mail dawnzig@hotmail.com. Answers will appear in this forum only. Radio station listings appear in the Herald-Tribune's Sunday Click TV Guide publication."
