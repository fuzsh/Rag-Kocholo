        "text": "Getting skip on FM radio on and off right now (skip (not tropo) affects FM radio, right?). I was just listening to WMMR from Philly when I hear it fade out and another station come in. I kept on listening and heard them ID as \"Tampa Bay's Number 1 Hit Music Station, WFLZ\". It was extremely strong. Anyone else getting the same?\n\nI remember two days back in 1985, we couldn't talk more than 7 - 8 blocks base station to base station on the CB here in Indiana. At the same time all the local FM stations were replaced with staions from Billings MT and Casper WY.\n\nMore skip today. Getting WXXZ \"KQ95\" on 95.3 MHz from Grand Marais, Minnesota.\n\nEDIT: Also getting KQDS-FM on 94.9 MHz from Duluth, Minnesota.\n\nEDIT 2: Just logged KKZY-FM from Bemidji, Minnesota on 95.5 MHz.\n\nEDIT 3: I'm getting a station on 93.1 MHz making references to the \"Rainy River District\", \"Fort Frances\", and the \"Great Canadian Main Street\". Any ideas?"
