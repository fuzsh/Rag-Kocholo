        "text": "Premiere Networks announced today the launch of The Kane Show into national syndication. The No.1 ranked morning show will continue to originate from WIHT-FM/Hot 99.5 in Washington, D.C. and will be available to CHR/Top 40 stations Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. ET, beginning December 29, 2014. (Nielsen Audio, SEP’14, PPM, MF 6a10a, AQH Rank, A&W18-34)\n\nThe Kane Show is hosted by Kane, along with co-hosts Danni Starr and Intern John, sidekick Rose, and producers Erick and Scott. The high-energy program features music, conversations on the latest news and hot topics, Hollywood gossip, contests, call-in interaction with listeners, plus interviews with the biggest celebrities in music and pop culture.\n\nIn addition to airing on WIHT-FM in D.C., the program can also be heard on 93.3 FLZ/WFLZ-FM in Tampa, Fla., Z104.3/WZFT-FM in Baltimore, Md., KISS 107/WKFS-FM in Cincinnati, Ohio, 101.9 KISS FM/KWNW in Memphis, Tenn., Radio Now 98.9/WNRW-FM in Louisville, Ky.; and 99.3 KISS FM/WHKF-FM in Harrisburg, Pa., as well as The Kane Show channel on iHeartRadio, iHeartMedia’s industry-leading digital radio platform.\n\n“On a scale of 1 to 10, I’m at about a 14 on excitement for this opportunity!” shared Kane. “We’ve worked hard every morning for the past eight years to entertain, inform, and build lasting bonds with our listeners. Now, the chance to do that on an even larger stage with Premiere is a dream come true for me and the show. I’d like to thank Thea Mitchem, Mark Medina, Tom Poleman, Clay Hunnicutt, Hartley Adkins, Julie Talbott, Jennifer Leimgruber and everyone within the iHeartMedia family who helped make this a reality for us. Here we go!”\n\nPremiere Networks President Julie Talbott stated, “We’re excited to expand our partnership with a talented personality like Kane. Adding D.C.’s top morning show to our national lineup will provide listeners, affiliates and partners with access to one of the most fun, fast-paced and entertaining morning radio programs available.”\n\nKane will continue to host Club Kane, a Sunday night music radio program which launched in March 2010 with Premiere Networks and airs nationwide on nearly 100 Top 40 stations from 7 p.m. to midnight local time. Each week, Kane plays chart-topping songs, debuts new music and takes requests as he welcomes listeners to his on-air party. Broadcasting live from Washington, D.C., he also discusses pop culture, music and entertainment, and features candid conversations with music artists and celebrities."
