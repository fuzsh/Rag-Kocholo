        "text": "What was on the radio this week…back then. This is a weekly visit back to radio audio from this week in past years for those that enjoy radio history or those working in radio looking for promotional ideas, etc. If you enjoy these weekly audio rewinds, they take a lot of time to put together, so please do me a favor, subscribe, and share and pass it on. Thank you!\n\n19 weeks into this project and we have yet to visit Tampa or Detroit. So, this week includes our first trip there. I also included an aircheck that has puzzled me since I recorded it — KTLT Wichita Falls’ flirt with top 40 that doesn’t seem to have existed all that long and doesn’t appear in any archives, but yet, here it is on tape.\n\nTop 40 WFLZ-FM 93.3 “93-3FLZ” Tampa Bay, June 1 1999\n\nModern AC WSSR 95.7 “Star 95.7” Tampa Bay, June 1 1999\n\nTop 40-rock WDFX 99.5 “99.5 the Fox” Detroit, May 30 1989\n\nTop 40 KTLT 106.3 “FM106” Wichita Falls TX, May 27 1991\n\nCountry KYYI 104.7 “Y104” Wichita Falls TX, May 27 1991\n\nWFLZ-FM is now three and half decades into its CHR run. This aircheck is from 1999, a decade into its initial flip to top 40 and four years after it rebranded from “Power 93” to “93-3FLZ.” Overall, it sounds good, particular with some of the clever contesting…\n\nStation Contest and Promotions: 93-3FLZ had cooked up some pretty cool events. One was a “survival of the fittest” promotion where 5 listeners will be picked to ride the new Gwazi wooden rollercoaster at Busch Gardens. The catch is the have to ride it 93 times in a row…whoever remains on the coaster after the 93 laps splits $5,000. The promo at the beginning of the aircheck is pretty funny. The other contest was leveraging the news and hype on Y2K…the first of the newborn of registered couples who arrives on or after January 1 2000 gets $25,000.\n\nAudio playback is not supported on your browser.

This WSSR aircheck was recorded first and the tape flipped over for the above WFLZ aircheck. This aircheck was about a year and a half into WSSR’s run as a modern AC. WSSR would last about 6 years before flipping to R&B WBTP “95.7 the Beat,” which continues rolling along today. WBTP is actually the longest-running format and calls on 95.7 since it signed on in 1963.\n\nAudio playback is not supported on your browser.

At this point, WDFX was a top 40/rock hybrid. There are a lot of hair bands plus some pretty decent tracks from Richard Marx, Eddie Money, Living Colour, Cheap Trick, Henry Lee Summer, Cyndi Lauper, and Love And Rockets. Each time I hear this audio, I imagine DJ Terry Young had 4 or 5 cans of Jolt cola before this shift…he is amped up and gives the format a lot of energy.\n\nStation Contest and Promotions: WDFX had just given away a trip to see Bon Jovi play in Russia and was promoting another concert trip to see them play in Los Angeles. The Detroit Pistons and Chicago Bulls were playing in the 1989 NBA Eastern Conference Finals. Morning show Andy Savage and Steve Courtney had a different spin on the typical sports bet bit between media outlets in different markets: If Chicago loses, they would have to shave their heads and beg for money at one of Chicago’s airports. Fortunately for them, the Pistons would end up winning the series 4-2 and go on to sweep the Lakers to win the NBA Finals.\n\nAudio playback is not supported on your browser.

I recorded this driving through on Memorial Day 1991. I hadn’t planned to record it since KTLT had been soft AC “K-Lite,” and that wasn’t my music taste. I was surprised to find the “K-Lite” brand was gone and in was new jingles and imaging and the music switched towards top 40. As this was several years before the World Wide Web, there was no station website at the time. There was never a mention in the trade magazines. I can’t find any reference to a change in the archives of the local newspaper. There is not much history about KTLT at all out there. Even the station’s Wikipedia page (as of May 26 2024) is all of four sentences in length and it has an incorrect first air date. But, never the less, here it is… It could not have lasted long as KTLT picked up one of 24/7 satellite format provider Unistar’s soft AC formats later in 1991….and brought back the “K-Lite” brand with it.\n\nStation Contest: The holiday weekend contest was two passes to the movie “Soapdish” that was opening nationwide the following weekend.\n\nAudio playback is not supported on your browser.

So, it is from the same afternoon on Memorial Day 1991. KYYI was about two years old from its first sign on date.\n\nKYYI would end up being managed and then bought by cross-town rival country KLUR 99.9. In a bit of unusual programming for a country FM, in early 1997, Y104 picked up carrying Dr Laura’s advice talk show and ran it each afternoon from 1-4. It ended up flipping to classic rock “104 the Bear” at the end of 1997, which it remains its current format.\n\nStation Contest: The contest of the day was a chance to win tickets to Billy Bob’s, the world’s largest honkey tonk, in Fort Worth.\n\nAudio playback is not supported on your browser.
