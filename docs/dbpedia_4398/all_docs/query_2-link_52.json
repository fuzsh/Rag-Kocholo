        "text": "I remember it like it was yesterday.\n\nOne of the older neighborhood kids named Travis Jones, was in high school and did mobile DJ work at area school dances. I was in 7th grade and he was getting ready to start 10th grade. We become friends, and he mentioned he wanted to be on the radio one day. I was like, yeah right. He’s said, “no I’ve got all my equipment set up in my room, you should check this out.”\n\nHe had 2 turn tables and microphone, and he would do shifts like he was on the air. No joke! It was the first time I had ever heard myself on a microphone. I was hooked. For the next several years I built my little mock studio in my room and practiced every single day for hours.\n\nTalking up songs, coping what I heard on the radio. I would mix sweepers I had recorded off local stations in between the songs, all of it.\n\nBy the time I was hitting 10th grade, I was doing school dances all over the city and dreaming of being on the radio.\n\nTravis, ended up getting hired at our local station Q102 for overnights, he was around 20 or so at the time.\n\nWe’ll, he got his hands on a major market aircheck, those are samples of shows that jocks send out as demos to get jobs.\n\nGod, I’ll never forget hearing what real radio personality’s sounded like! Air talent from New York, L.A., Atlanta all over. I heard Kid Kelly at Z100 and Domino at Power 99 in Atlanta and I thought, damn, I want to be this good some day.\n\nNobody where I lived sounded like these guy’s! I played the tape for my dad and told him, this is what I was going to do for a living.\n\nOf course he was against it at first until…. I put together a tape at the studio of a local station in the production room with my really good friend Doc, who was part time. It was Kee 100 Fm in Huntington WV, several hours drive from where I lived but it was worth it, and it worked!\n\nI sent the tape to Jim Jammer Davis at a local station WEYQ in Marrieta Ohio. Jim called me and was blown away that I’d never been on the air before, let alone I was only 16.\n\nI owe that guy so much for that shot. He’s still a great friend to this day! I started part time and within a year or so was the full time 7-12 pm night guy.\n\nFor the next 4 years I sucked and ripped off everything I could from all the big boys in major cities. I basically patterned myself after Kid Kelly at Z100 New York.\n\nWhen I was 19 soon to be 20, Q102 in Marrieta folded and I was out of job. I sent demos out all over, everywhere.\n\nI got a call from Ted Kelly at KQIZ in Amarillo TX to do 7-12pm. My dad didn’t want me to move that far away, but I was dead set on making it.\n\nI was so obsessed, it’s all I thought about. You know Amarillo’s where I met my wife Stefanie, yep been married 20 years! I fell in love with TX, and learned so much from Ted, I’ll always be thankful to him!\n\nFrom there I went to Hot 97 in Wilkes-Barre Scranton Pennsylvania to work for my hero Kid Kelly. Kid had just left NYC to start his programming career.\n\nFor me to be chosen as Kid Kelly’s night jock, was a dream. That’s when my life started to change. Kid taught me everything. God, I was learning from the best!!\n\nStef was by my side at every turn. We we’re there a year to the day. Then it was off to KZHT Salt Lake City.\n\nMark Summer’s, thank you for pushing me to be myself and giving me the freedom to find my voice.\n\nI was there 1 year to the day, and that’s when Rob Morris called from KDWB in Minneapolis Minnesota. Rob, I can’t thank you enough! He was a big brother to me, and we played a lot of golf together. Plus, he taught me so much! That was the life changer gig right there.\n\nMore money than Stef and I had ever seen. In other words, we could pay our bills finally. I have to thank Tone E. Fly for getting me that job and giving me his stamp of approval. I love you Tony! 3 years 6-10 at night, then off to 106.1 Kiss FM in Dallas for nights.\n\nAfter a year in Dallas, KDWB in Minnisota brought me back to do afternoon drive for the next 4 years. From there, I was at a crossroads.\n\nI wanted to try doing mornings, be the “morning guy” and see if I could do it honestly. I got a call from Radio Now 100.9 in Indianapolis, and took the gig.\n\nThat was so special, with my dear friends McKinzie and Shy by my side, we really had a great show! Shouts to Tim Rayne who took a chance on me. Love you bro!\n\nAfter I decided to quit that job after 4 years. Long story, industry BS. That’s when Tommy Chuck called from 933 FLZ and said, “you want to do afternoon’s on the beach?” I’ve been here and called Tampa Bay home ever sense. Ten years this year. I’m on US-1035 Country, afternoon’s 3-7, and 98 Rock 10am- 1pm daily.\n\nWhoa, not bad for a kid from Parkersburg W.V.! Thank you to everyone who lended a hand to me living my dream over the years. I’ve never forgotten everything you did for me!\n\nI really do owe the biggest thank you to the love of my life, Stefanie. I love you and appreciate you for guiding me and putting up with my bullshit all these years. You are true blessing!!"
