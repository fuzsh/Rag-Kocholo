        "text": "KFUL-FM (95.5 FM) is a radio station licensed to Lone Oak, Texas and serving the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. Owned by Interstate Broadcasting, Inc., it broadcasts a classic alternative format branded as \"95X\", broadcasting alternative songs from a time period of the late-70s to the mid-2000s.\n\nKFUL-FM's studios are located in Highland Park, it's transmitter is located atop Energy Plaza in downtown Dallas.\n\nHistory[]\n\nOn December 4, 1998, the Educational Media Foundation sold KLDT-FM to Interstate Broadcasting, Inc. for $1 million as part of a trade in which the EMF received the current Dallas K-Love station, KLDT (1210 AM). KLDT-FM simulcast KLDT for a few months into early 1999 while Interstate looked for a format to flip the station to.\n\nOn May 1, 1999, the station re-launched as KFUL-FM \"Fuel 95\", a Top 40/CHR station described to advertisers as \"Top 40 with attitude.\" The shock jock duo of Ben Centnerszwer and Joshua \"The Man\" Montenegro moved from San Diego to Dallas to host afternoon drive. KFUL-FM attempted to compete with KHKS by taking heavy pot shots at the station (a tactic inspired by WFLZ-FM in Tampa, Florida, of which the PD for \"Fuel 95\" was a former employee of during it's \"Power Pig\" era), putting up billboards and selling T-shirts with the phrase \"Kiss My A**\". Despite this, \"Fuel 95\" was a failure, registering a mere 1.9 in the Arbitron ratings."
