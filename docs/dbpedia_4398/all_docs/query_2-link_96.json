        "text": "The best top 40 radio stations are the ultimate resource for music lovers in search of fantastic hit songs from their favorite artists. Rather than focusing on a specific genre, American top 40 stations prioritize playing the biggest chart toppers in the music industry.\n\nOriginally rising to fame in the 1950s, “top 40” programming helped to introduce listeners to a host of new sounds from different genres, often dependent on the personality of the disc jockey, and industry knowledge of big hits.\n\nThese stations have always appealed to younger generations and are often the number one pick for many public spaces, like retail stores and supermarkets.\n\nAside from top 40 hits, fans of these stations can often expect to hear a variety of talk shows as part of the programming, designed to get listeners engaged with the station. You might also encounter a range of contests and call-in segments too.\n\nLet’s discover some of the best top 40 radio stations in the US.\n\nAmerican top 40 radio stations\n\nBefore the 1950s in America, radio programming was a world apart from what we know today. Most stations were known for broadcasting chunks of programming, from 30-minute soap operas, to chunks of music, and news.\n\nMost of the time, the content shared on these stations was produced outside of the local radio stations and delivered to multiple places around the country.\n\nIn the early 1950s, a new approach to programming music began, the radio broadcaster, Todd Storz was credited with inventing a new format: The Top 40.\n\nPurchasing a radio station known as KOWH with his father, Todd started creating music-focused radio broadcasts which played the most popular songs on repeat. This approach quickly caught on.\n\nAs rock and roll became the most popular music genre in the late 50s throughout America, the top 40 radio station thrived. Stations started using jingles to promote their format, and legendary names like WHB, WTIK, and KLIF emerged.\n\nNow, the top 40 station continues to be among the most popular options for radio stations across the US.\n\nLet’s take a look at some of the leader in modern-day pop music.\n\n1. KMVQ\n\nAvailable: Online, 99.7 FM (San Francisco, California)\n\nLicensed to San Francisco, California, KMVQ-FM is a top 40/ CHR radio station owned by the Bonneville International company. The frequency was originally owned by the NBC group, and broadcast an all-around news format until around 1978.\n\nAt this point, NBC began taking advantage of the growing success of FM radio, and programmers created a new format “hot adult contemporary”.\n\nThe station became “KYUU” and broadcast its hot adult contemporary music for a decent amount of time, before gradually migrating towards a more “Top 40 radio” format. Now known as 99.7 NOW, the KMVQ station evolved to the format we have today in around 2010.\n\nAside from broadcasting top hits over the FM broadcasting channels, KMVQ also offers a set of HD radio options offering both top 40 and dance music.\n\n2. WKCI-FM\n\nAvailable: Online and 101.3 FM (Hamden, Connecticut)\n\nAdvertised as Connecticut’s number one hit music station, QKCI FM is a popular station with a host of amazing shows for listeners to enjoy. During the 1980s, the station became an affiliate of the Rick Dees weekly top 40 show, and in 2004, the station switched to broadcasting radio in HD format.\n\nToday, aside from its central top 40 channel, WKCI also has a number of HD subchannels, playing news and talk programs, as well as “mainstream urban” music via “The Beat 100.9”. Currently, WKCI-FM belongs to the iHeartMedia Company.\n\nInterestingly, iHeartMedia also owns another talk station in Virginia which shares the same call sign of WKCI, at a 970 AM frequency.\n\n3. KYLD\n\nAvailable: Online or 94.9 FM (San Francisco, California)\n\nAnother extremely popular top 40 music radio station in the San Francisco area, KYLD is owned by iHeartMedia. Following the mainstream top 40 style, the station has evolved over the years to broadcast everything from country music, to classical.\n\nThe company became a full top 40 and pop station in 1997.\n\nInterestingly, KYLD was involved in some controversy during the 90s, when a story was circulating that Bill Clinton had tied up traffic on LA runways for over an hour when he was getting a haircut.\n\nThe KYLD DJ for morning shows, Mancow Muller, staged a parody of the incident during rush hour, and Muller was fired from the station.\n\nMuller also ended up facing prosecution and was charged to three years’ probation and a fine by the municipal court in San Francisco.\n\n4. KQMV\n\nAvailable: Online or 92.5 FM (Bellevue, Washington)\n\nOften referred to as “Movin 92.5”, this top 40 station in Washington is owned by the Hubbard Broadcasting company and airs a comprehensive top 40 format.\n\nThe station is the flagship station home to the Brooke and Jeffrey morning show, hosted by Jeffrey Dubow and Brooke Fox, which is now distributed around the US.\n\nKMQV took on the top 40 and CHR music styles in 2010, and within three years, it became the highest-rated CHR station on the market, as well as one of the top radio stations overall.\n\nThe success KQMV had within the radio market caused a number of changes within the radio landscape, with many other stations updating their own broadcasting strategy.\n\nThe station now has its own website, as well as an avid following on social media, where people can get in touch and request songs.\n\n5. Today’s Hits Radio\n\nAvailable: Online\n\nToday’s Hits Radio is a dedicated online radio station, committed to playing the top hits in a top 40 broadcasting format, 24/7.

WKSC FM\n\nAvailable: Online and 103.5 FM (Chicago, Illinois)\n\nOwned by the famous iHeartMedia Company, WKSC FM, or “103.5 Kiss FM) is a station licensed in Chicago Illinois and broadcasting the top 40 CHR format. The station started life way back in 1957 and began with a light classical music format.\n\nIn the years following, WKSC experimented with various different musical options, including a significant amount of rock.\n\nFor a period, WKSC became the “Beat”, and played a host of rock music albums and songs, without any radio host. In January 2001, the station took on its top 40 radio format, and started to re-introduce various hosts and programming.\n\nThe syndicated program Rick Dees Weekly Top 40 and American Top 40 became popular too.\n\nDreX was morning host for WKSC from 2003 to 2010, and other jocks included Nina Charlotte, Silly Jilly, and David L, among others.\n\n7. KIIS-FM\n\nAvailable: Online and 102.7 FM (LA, California)\n\nIt’s impossible to write any list about the best top 40 radio stations in the US without mentioning KIIS-FM. This radio station in LA is owned by iHeartMedia, and it’s the flagship station for the world-renowned show “On Air with Ryan Seacrest”.\n\nThe station offers a standard analog transmission, as well as two HD subchannels.\n\nKIIS FM has achieved a host of accolades over the years for its popular shows and talk sessions, as well as its dedication to top 40s music.\n\nThe station was the second-highest revenue billing station in the US during 2008, and it was honored by the National Association for Broadcasters with the Marconi Award in 2010.\n\nKIIS-FM is even available on the Sirius XM radio system, on channel 11. Seacrest became the co-host of the syndicated talk show in New York in 2017, Live with Kelly, and Seacrest began hosting “On Air” from a studio at WABC-TV instead.\n\nIt’s hard to find anyone who hasn’t heard of KIIS today.\n\n8. KNDE\n\nAvailable: Online and 95.1 FM (Texas)\n\nKNDE is a unique mention on our list of the top 40 radio stations, because it moves away from the standard commercial format.\n\nOtherwise known as “Candy 95.1”, KNDE is a college station in Texas, known for its excellent music selection, as well as a handful of popular shows, like Morning Candy with Frito and Katy.\n\nThe station has had a host of popular DJ presences throughout the years and is currently owned by the Bryan Broadcasting Company.

WKSL has been home to a number of personalities in the radio landscape over the years, including MJ in the Morning, and Skip Kelly.\n\n13.
