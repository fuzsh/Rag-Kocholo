Crime comedy films employ conventions such as trivializing violence and death through humor, using witty dialogue during illegal or dangerous activities, and including properties related to crime. Violence is played for laughs through clever comments or the context of the scene. Character deaths are also made humorous by how or when they occur. Witty quips and comedic dialogue are used even during fights or dangerous situations. Knowledge gaps create ironic close calls and tension between characters.
