The British do costumed dramas and slapstick comedy quite well, but they also know their way around a gritty crime movie. Over the decades, there have been many British crime films, either being made by British actors and directors or at least set in Britain. There are heist movies, gangster flicks, and so much more. We’ve collected a list of our favorite British crime films. Now, “crime” is a pretty wide genre. We are focusing more on movies that are built around crime, as opposed to detective stories or mystery films involving a crime. That is to say, don’t expect Sherlock Holmes to show up.

“A Fish Called Wanda” (1988)

MGM

“A Fish Called Wanda” is known more for the comedy than the crime, but it’s definitely a British crime film. Yes, even though Jamie Lee Curtis and Kevin Kline are two of the costars, and Kline even won an Oscar for his performance. Two of the other main characters are Monty Python’s John Cleese and Michael Palin, and the action all takes place in England. Also, the inciting incident is a crime, and most of the main characters are in on it.

“Croupier” (1998)

Image Entertainment

Mike Hodges made his directorial debut with the original “Get Carter,” and for his penultimate film he gave us “Croupier.” It was not a big hit and got a small release, but it was quite critically acclaimed in the United States. A lot of that love went to the film’s star, an actor on the rise who was still waiting for his big break. That would be none other than Clive Owen. If you want to see Owen’s first big role, give “Croupier” a shot.
