Nobody does scripted crime comedy TV series quite like the British. The genre skillfully combines the drama and thrills of crime TV shows, but with an added dose of comedy. Some of the best British crime comedies include Agatha Raisin, Landscapers, and New Tricks.

British crime shows often take place in quaint, scenic little towns, like the fictional Wildemarsh from Queens of Mystery, or Great Slaughter from Sister Boniface Mysteries (which is a spinoff of another British classic, Father Brown). The Outlaws, Witless, and The Curse bring together ragtag crews who may not have crossed paths before, and drop them into crime underworlds. Some of the series on this list are long-running classics, while others offer more modern fare, like Year of the Rabbit. Black Ops is another fun option that follows officers who get sucked into trouble thanks to an undercover operation.
