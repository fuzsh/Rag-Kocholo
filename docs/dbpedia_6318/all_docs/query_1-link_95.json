        "text": "1. Crime Genre Analysis and Timeline By Nabil Schultschik\n\n2. Definition of the Crime Genre Crime fiction is the genre of fiction that deals with crimes, their detection, criminals, and their motives. Most crime novels share a common structure. First there is the crime, usually a murder; then there is the investigation; and finally the outcome or judgment, often in the shape of the criminal's arrest or death.\n\n3. Crime Sub Genres • Crime Comedy – A hybrid of crime and comedy films. Humor comes from the incompetence of the criminals from films such as Lock, Stock and two smoking barrels. • Crime Drama – A combination of crime and dramatic films. Examples include such films as Straight Time. • Crime Thriller – A thriller in which the central characters are involved in crime, either in its investigation, as the perpetrator. • Film noir – A genre popular in the 1940s often fall into the crime and mystery genres. • Heist Film – This film deals with a group of criminals attempting to perform a theft or robbery, as well as the possible consequences that follow. Heist films that are lighter in tone are called \"Caper films”.\n\n4. Crime Sub Genres • Hood film – Film dealing with African-American urban issues and culture. They do not always evolve around crime, but often criminal activity features heavily in the storyline. Examples include Boyz in the Hood. • Legal Drama – Not usually concerned with the actual crime so much as the trial in the aftermath. A typical plot would involve a lawyer trying to prove the innocence of his or her client. Examples include A time to kill. • Mob film - Film which focuses on characters who are involved seriously with the Mafia or organized crime. Notable mob films include The Godfather. • Mystery Film - Film which focuses on the efforts of the detective, private investigator or amateur sleuth to solve the mysterious circumstances of a crime by means of clues, investigation, and clever deduction\n\n5. First Crime film: Bluebeard (1901) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg_nWW-TgFg\n\n6. First Crime film: Bluebeard (1901) In this silent film, Bluebeard seeks a wife. Later on into the film, a man gives her daughters hand in marriage to Bluebeard since he has a large fortune. Shortly after, Bluebeard leaves giving warning to her new wife not to enter a room. She does enter this room to find several ladies hanging. The devil in the room taunts her in the room and frightens her to leave. Bluebeard arrived soon after, learning that she entered the room to find the hanging ladies. Townspeople the break into Bluebeards courtyard and stab him learning about the handing ladies.\n\n7. Comparison between Bluebeard and todays Crime films\n\n8. Comparison between Bluebeard and todays Crime films Bluebeard heavily relied on its crime/thriller suspense through the means of mise-en-scene such as the hanging ladies in the film. However, in todays crime films, special effects are heavily used to bring about its action involved in a crime film to satisfy its audience. Another very clear difference is the cinematography of the films. Bluebeard was recorded in black and white while films like Oceans 11 was recorded in colour. This clearly shows how the crime genre and films in general have evolved from no colour to special effects.\n\n9. Crime Movies from 1950 - 1969 • The Blue Lamp (1950) • The Big Combo (1955) • The Killing (1956) • Touch of Evil (1958) • Afraid to Die (1960) • Underworld U.S.A. (1961) • The Eye of Evil (1962) • The Brain (1969)\n\n10. The Killing (1956) After getting out of prison, Johnny Clay masterminds a complex race-track heist, but his scheme is complicated by the intervention of the wife of a teller (George Peatty) in on the scheme, the boyfriend of the wife, airport regulations, and a small dog.\n\n11. Crime Movies from 1970 - 2000 • Bloody Mama (1970) • Cop (1976) • The American Friend (1977) • The Godfather (1972)"
