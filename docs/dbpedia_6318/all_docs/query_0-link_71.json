TechRadar's entertainment experts have put in the hard yards to compile a list of the 44 best movies to watch on Netflix, including a number of the streamer's original offerings and plenty of licensed ones. The streamer has a seemingly immeasurable number of films to choose from these days, so we're sure you'll be glad of our help.\n\nIf you want even more recommendations, you should read our everything new on Netflix in August 2024 guide and if you want to catch some movies before they bid farewell to the streamer this month, then have a look at everything leaving Netflix in August 2024. It's packed with numerous new movies that have made their way onto the streamer over the past month, including older classics too. However, if you're in the mood to binge watch a TV show or rather focus on something shorter, then check out our best Netflix TV shows to watch in August 2024.\n\nFrom animated flicks to war epics, Netflix's movie library has something for everyone and we've made it easier for you to decide what to watch by picking out the best from each genre, so read on to get the lowdown on the best Netflix films available to you.\n\nBest action movies on Netflix\n\nBaby Driver\n\nAge rating: R\n\nRuntime: 113 minutes\n\nMain cast: Ansel Elgort, Lily James, Jon Hamm, Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx, Eiza González and Jon Bernthal\n\nDirector: Edgar Wright\n\nRT score: 92%\n\nRecommended by\n\nRecommended by\n\nMatt Bolton\n\nFamed British filmmaker Edgar Wright (Scott Pilgrim vs the World, Shaun of the Dead) put pedal to the metal with this barnstorming high-octane action-thriller, and I've loved it since I saw it in the theater. Elgort plays 'Baby', a getaway driver who relies on the beat of his personal soundtrack to get his crew of goons out of a jam whenever he's needed. However, when he falls for Debora (James), the woman of his dreams, 'Baby' sees a way out of his crime-based life for good – but naturally, he's forced into one final job, which threatens the freedom and clean slate he desperately craves. I think it's one of the most slick and stylish flicks we've had in years, and Wright's signature kinetic style elevates it beyond other simple action fare. I also love the soundtrack, which is woven right into the action, like the action version of a musical. Baby Driver is a pulsating, thrills-a-minute ride that deserves more recognition.\n\n• Watch Baby Driver on Netflix now\n\n• Watch Baby Driver's trailer on YouTube\n\nThe Woman King\n\nAge rating: PG-13\n\nRuntime: 135 minutes\n\nMain cast: Viola Davis, Lashana Lynch, Thuso Mbedu, Sheila Atim, and John Boyega\n\nDirector: Gina Prince-Bythewood\n\nRT score: 94%\n\nRecommended by\n\nRecommended by\n\nTom Power\n\nSet in the 1820s, this Viola Davis-fronted historical epic tells the tale of General Nanisca (Davis) and the wider Adojie tribe, the all-female warrior unit that protected the West African kingdom of Dahomey across a 200-year period. Starring a number of other terrific Black actors including Lashana Lynch, John Boyega, Thuso Mbedu, and Sheila Stim, The Woman King is a weighty, crowd-pleasing spectacle that many have likened to Braveheart in its action, tonality, and themes surrounding defiance in the face of invading forces. A splashy popcorn flick, sure, but one filled with substance, as well as deeper societal and historical subject matter.\n\n• Watch The Woman King on Netflix now\n\n• WatchThe Woman King's YouTube trailer\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front\n\nAge rating: R\n\nRuntime: 148 minutes\n\nMain cast: Felix Kammerer, Albrecht Schuch, Aaron Hilmer, and Moritz Klaus Director: Edward Berger\n\nRT score: 90%\n\nRecommended by\n\nRecommended by\n\nTom Power\n\nIt’s been a good few years since Dunkirk and 1917 reminded audiences of the horrors of war, but Netflix assumed that responsibility with shocking but beautifully-made WWI epic, All Quiet on the Western Front. Based on Erich Maria Remarque’s landmark novel of the same name (which was first adapted into a feature film in 1930), this award-winning German-language movie tells the story of a young German soldier (Felix Kammerer) whose naive expectations of fighting for his country are shattered by war’s harrowing reality. As you'd expect, All Quiet on the Western Front is brutal, vivid and poignant – just don’t expect to reach its credits feeling particularly joyous.\n\n• Watch All Quiet on the Western Fronton Netflix now\n\n• Watch All Quiet on the Western Front's YouTube trailer\n\nThe Harder They Fall\n\nAge rating: R\n\nRuntime: 139 minutes\n\nMain cast: Idris Elba, Jonathan Majors, Zazie Beetz, Delroy Lindo, and LaKeith Stanfield\n\nDirector: Jeymes Samuel\n\nRT score: 88%\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\n\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\n\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nRecommended by\n\nRecommended by\n\nTom Power\n\nJeymes Samuel's feature film directorial debut wasn't expected to be this good. But The Harder They Fall, which stars the likes of Idris Elba, Zazie Beetz, and Regina King, is a superb Western that deserves your attention. Jonathan Majors, who was recently found guilty of domestic abuse and whose career is effectively over as a result, plays Nat Love, an outlaw who discover his mortal enemy Rufus Black (Elba) is being released from prison. Unsurprisingly, Love takes the law into his own hands and assembles his crack team of gunslingers to stop that from happening. A stylized, gun-toting action flick that's somewhat predictable in its makeup, The Harder They Fall will have you whooping and hollering at the screen regularly.\n\n• Watch The Harder They Fallon Netflix now\n\n• Watch The Harder They Fall's YouTube trailer\n\nBest animated movies on Netflix\n\nApollo 10 1/2: A Space Age Childhood\n\nAge rating: PG-13\n\nRuntime: 98 minutes\n\nMain cast: Jack Black, Bill Wise, Lee Eddy, Milo Coy, Zachary Levi, and Glen Powell Director: Richard Linklater\n\nRT score: 91%\n\nRecommended by\n\nRecommended by\n\nTom Power\n\nNetflix is home to lots of great animated flicks, so if you’re keen to mix up your movie-watching diet, films don't come much more unconventional than the streamer’s Apollo 10 1/2: A Space Age Childhood. Boyhood director Richard Linklater returns to filmmaking duties with this animated feature, which tells the story of the 1969 moon landing from multiple perspectives. The movie shares the visual style of Linklater’s previous animation, 2006's A Scanner Darkly, and features the voice talents of The Super Mario Bros. Movie's Jack Black, Shazam! Fury of the Gods' Zachary Levi, and Top Gun: Maverick star Glen Powell.

With Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio, the streamer breathes new life into Carlo Collodi's beloved 1883 fairytale about a wooden puppet who longs to become a real boy. Shot entirely using stop-motion (in a manner akin to Netflix series The House), del Toro’s darker adaptation is set in 1930s Italy during Mussolini’s fascist regime and features a star-studded voice cast that includes Ewan McGregor, David Bradley, Tilda Swinton, Christoph Waltz and Cate Blanchett.

Halfway through this fraught journey, an AI takes revenge on its billionaire creator and the world is suddenly under duress from smart robots. A lot of Spider-Verse's visual touches cross over into this film, with 2D annotations and drawings on the already-pretty 3D visuals.

Star Wars alumnus Riz Ahmed voices Ballister Blackheart, a futuristic knight who's framed for a crime he didn't commit. The only witness who can save him from a lengthy jail term is Nimona (The Peipheral's Chloe Grace Moretz), a shapeshifter who Blackheart is sworn to seek out and destroy. Cue a wild buddy cop-style adventure that teaches kids to have an open mind about people who are different to them in more ways than one.

Don't argue with us. At first glance, everyone's favorite, marmalade sandwich-eating Peruvian bear didn't seem like he'd be the star of a truly terrific family-friendly film. As it turns out, though, Paddington (voiced with a deftness, warmth, and stacks of humor by Ben Whishaw) is a bonafide movie star – and his first CGI-cum-live-action movie proves it. You'll laugh yourself silly at its slapstick moments, you'll cry at its heart-wrenching (and heart-warming!) scenes, and shout \"I didn't know they were in it!\" at every big-name actor who appears.

Charming, action-packed, and beautifully-rendered, The Sea Beast was praised by audiences and critics alike upon release, and serves as further proof that Netflix should think twice about scaling back its animation department.

With its witty, subversive take on fairy tales, stellar performances from its voice cast, CG animation that holds up over 20 years later, iconic licensed soundtrack, and plenty of adult-based humor to go alongside its child-friendly comedy, Shrek is an undisputed classic. For anyone who hasn’t seen it (and why wouldn’t you have?), Shrek stars Myers as the titular ogre, who finds his swamp overrun by fairy tale creatures after the nefarious Lord Farquaad (Lithgow) kicks them out of their homes. Alongside annoying new best friend Donkey (Murphy), Shrek makes a pact with Farquaad to rescue Princess Fiona (Diaz) to get his swamp (and peace and quiet) back.

If you're a fan of Monty Python, you'll likely have seen this one countless times over. First-time viewers, though, will cackle and guffaw their way through the film's rivetingly silly scenarios. The Black Knight scene, Knights of the Roundtable dance number, deadly Rabbit of Caerbannog sequence, and Knights Who Say \"Ni!\" moment are just four instantaneously classic moments waiting to be viewed.

Glen Powell stars as Gary Johnson, an undercover agent who poses as a fake hitman to help a woman in need and soon finds himself falling for her.

Brown plays the titular character (and younger sister of Cavill's Sherlock), who travels to London to locate her missing mother. Unsurprisingly, she gets side-tracked, and finds herself teaming up with a runaway lord to get to the bottom of a particularly thrilling case that threatens the UK.

But there's no denying the appeal of seeing Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Al Pacino in the same movie together for likely the last time, and this life-spanning, mostly rewarding crime epic is a suitable tribute to their collective talents. The Irishman is an unmissable crime movie that follows Frank Sheeran (De Niro) as he recounts his long association with the Bufalino crime family and infamous union leader Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino). It's a languid film – and not a patch on Goodfellas – but absolutely among the best Netflix movies the streaming service has financed to date.

As well as referring to the infamous goal scored by Argentine footballer (and Napoli legend) Diego Maradona at the 1986 World Cup, the film's title alludes to a tragic and life-affirming event that forces its protagonist to grow up quicker than he'd otherwise like. To say more risks spoiling The Hand of God's most tender moments, though the movie's beautiful locations, hypnotic camerawork, and larger-than-life characters ensure it ranks among Sorrentino's best work.\n\n• Watch The Hand of Godon Netflix now\n\n• Watch The Hand of God's YouTube trailer\n\nMa Rainey's Black Bottom\n\nAge rating: R\n\nRuntime: 94 minutes\n\nMain cast: Viola Davis, Chadwick Boseman, Glynn Turman, and Colman Domingo\n\nDirector: George C.

Viola Davis stars as legendary 'Mother of Blues' Ma Rainey, with the film focusing on one fraught recording session with Ma and her band, and the tension between the musician and her white producers and management. The late Chadwick Boseman (Black Panther) stars as Levee, an innovative trumpet player who struggles to find his place in the music scene, amid bandmates who don't always take him seriously. It's a sad but insightful movie that explores how culture is worth protecting and valuing, in a world where it's easily taken and monetized, and the film truly comes to life in its amazing musical sequences.\n\n• Watch Ma Rainey's Black Bottomon Netflix now\n\n• Watch Ma Rainey's Black Bottom's YouTube trailer\n\nBeasts of No Nation\n\nAge rating: R\n\nRuntime: 137 minutes\n\nMain cast: Idris Elba, Abraham Atta, and Kurt Egyiawan\n\nDirector: Cary Fukunaga\n\nRT score: 91%\n\nRecommended by\n\nRecommended by\n\nTom Power\n\nWe won't beat about the bush – Beasts of No Nation is a tough watch.

An adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala's novel of the same name, Beasts of No Nation is a masterfully-shot story documenting the human cost of conflict, and places the uncomfortable realities of war front and centre.

The Oscar winner is another success story for director Gibson following the likes of his previous projects Braveheart, The Passion of the Christ and Apocalypto, which all became a cultural phenomenon. Hacksaw Ridge had my heart-pounding. It's a cinematic masterpiece that shines a light on the barbaric nature of war with scenes more horrifying than Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan.

Widely praised for its slow-burning psychological drama, it follows the story of a menacing rancher (Benedict Cumberbatch) who doesn’t take kindly to the arrival of his brother’s new wife (Kirsten Dunst) and her son (Kodi Smit-McPhee). Cumberbatch arguably gives a career-best performance as the volatile Phil Burbank here, which undoubtedly made interesting prep for Doctor Strange 2.

This one tells the story of a dressmaker (Daniel Day-Lewis) in 1950s London who falls for a young waitress (Vicky Krieps). That might sound like a potentially boring narrative, but Phantom Thread is actually masterfully-shot. It's also a poignant exploration of what it means to be an artist, combining Oscar-winning costume design with a stunning soundtrack (from Radiohead and frequent Anderson collaborator Johnny Greenwood) to rank among its director's finest work.

On paper, it's is not the easiest sell – a subtitled black and white film about a live-in housekeeper spoken almost entirely in Spanish and the indigenous Mixtec language. But Cuarón's 2018 critical hit is nonetheless riveting from a cinematic standpoint.

There's a reason why it holds a perfect 100% RT critical score – it's because it's a darn good film.\n\n• Watch His House on Netflix now\n\n• Watch His House's YouTube trailer\n\nIt Follows\n\nAge rating: R\n\nRuntime: 100 minutes\n\nMain cast: Maika Monroe, Keir Gilchrist, Daniel Zovatto, Jake Weary, and Olivia Luccardi\n\nDirector: David Robert Mitchell\n\nRT score: 95%\n\nRecommended by\n\nRecommended by\n\nTom Power\n\nThis Mitchell-directed film shouldn't be slept on – which, in some ways, is ironic, given the lengths its lead character Jay goes to in order to stay awake. Why? Because, in It Follows, the titular character is pursued by a supernatural entity after it's passed onto her through a sexual encounter with her at-the-time boyfriend Hugh. The entity in question will constantly (albeit) slowly track the currently infected individual until it catches them, upon which time it'll kill them – and then work its way back up the chain to murder every other person who was infected. It's a bit on the nose with its thematic exploration of sexually transmitted diseases, but It Follows is an otherwise terrifically terrifying and seriously underrated film that deserves more acclaim. A long overdue sequel is in the works, too, so best catch this one while you can.\n\n• Watch It Follows on Netflix now\n\n• Watch It Follows' YouTube trailer\n\nBest romance movies on Netflix\n\nCall Me by Your Name\n\nAge rating: R\n\nRuntime: 132 minutes\n\nMain cast: Timothée Chalamet, Armie Hammer, Michael Stuhlbarg, Esther Garral, André Aciman and Victoire Du Bois\n\nDirector: Luca Guadagnino\n\nRT score: 94%\n\nRecommended by\n\nRecommended by\n\nAmelia Schwanke\n\nPrior to his global success Challengers, director Luca Guadagnino created the romantic masterpiece that is Call Me by Your Name. The coming-of-age story stars Timothée Chalamet as 17-year-old Elio, who falls for his father's handsome assistant Oliver (Armie Hammer).

Based on Jenny Han's book trilogy, To All the Boys I've Loved Before follows teenager Lara Jean Covey (Lana Condor) whose unassuming life is upended when her secret love letters are mailed out to every boy she's ever loved. The hit love story refreshed the rom-com genre and developed a cult following with its realistic depiction of teenage life and high school relationships. To All the Boys I've Loved Before is a top tier feel good movie and is one of the best Netflix teen movies with its lovable and relatable characters.\n\n• Watch To All the Boys I've Loved Beforeon Netflix now\n\n• Watch To All the Boys I've Loved Before's YouTube trailer\n\nBest sci-fi movies on Netflix\n\nUpgrade\n\nAge rating: R\n\nRuntime: 100 minutes\n\nMain cast: Logan Marshall-Green, Harrison Gilbertson, Betty Gabriel, Melanie Vallejo and Benedict Hardie\n\nDirector: Leigh Whannell\n\nRT score: 88%\n\nRecommended by\n\nRecommended by\n\nMatt Bolton\n\nUpgrade is something that was desperately needed to refresh streaming action movies. I sorely miss genre-based action thrillers in the mainstream cinema landscape that are visually interesting and build on underlying themes, but Upgrade soon answered my prayers. Saw and Insidious writer Leigh Whannel's polished and tense direction makes this movie inventive yet still manages to tie into the memorable plot. In Upgrade, Grey Trace (Logan Marshall-Green) is left paralyzed in hospital after a deadly mugging which killed his wife. He's offered the chance to walk again by implanting an artificial intelligence chip called STEM and he soon develops superhuman strength. As he seeks revenge on the attackers who ruined his life, he becomes a brutal killing machine with the help of STEM. The cyberpunk action flick is still etched into my mind with its stylish cinematography, dark twists and jaw-dropping action sequences, which makes it definitely worth watching.\n\n• Watch Upgrade on Netflix now\n\n• Watch Upgrade's trailer on YouTube\n\nGodzilla Minus One\n\nAge rating: PG-13\n\nRuntime: 125 minutes\n\nMain cast: Ryûnosuke Kamiki, Minami Hamabe, Munetaka Aoki, Hidetaka Yoshioka, and Yuki Yamada\n\nDirector: Takashi Yamazaki\n\nRT score: 98%\n\nRecommended by\n\nRecommended by\n\nTom Power\n\nFew movies have recently spawned as many “where can I stream it?” questions as Godzilla Minus One. Finally, though, months after the unexpectedly successful film’s theatrical release, Netflix has not only secured its streaming rights, but it also surprisingly dropped the sci-fi horror epic on its platform in early June.\n\nA new Japanese entry in Godzilla’s packed back catalogue, Minus One returns to the iconic kaiju’s roots with a destruction-filled and trauma-inducing tale set in post-war Japan. In it, the island nation desperately wrestles with the titanic monster’s emergence from the deep and subsequently terrifying rampage across the Asian country.\n\nEasily one of 2023’s best movies, Godzilla Minus One is a thematically rich, harrowing, and occasionally jaw-dropping spectacle.

Reeves plays Thomas Anderson, a lowly, miserably, and introverted computer programmer who is heralded as a messianic figure (named Neo and/or The One) who can help humanity win a brutal, years-long war against intelligent machines that have trapped the human race in a simulation to hide the fact that said machines feed off human energy sources in a dystopian future. Things get way more complicated from then on out. Still, it's an absolute masterpiece and set a seemingly impossible standard that its three sequels (and many other sci-fi films since) have failed to live up to.\n\n• Watch The Matrix on Netflix now\n\n• Watch The Matrix's YouTube trailer\n\nThey Cloned Tyrone\n\nAge rating: R\n\nRuntime: 119 minutes\n\nMain cast: John Boyega, Jamie Foxx, and Teyonah Parris\n\nDirector: Juel Taylor\n\nRT score: 95%\n\nRecommended by\n\nRecommended by\n\nTom Power\n\nThey Cloned Tyrone is an absolutely brilliant movie. To discuss its plot at length is to spoil its biggest surprises, but here's a brief synopsis to give you a flavor of what to expect: \"A series of eerie events thrusts an unlikely trio (Jamie Foxx, John Boyega, and Teyonah Parris) onto the trail of a nefarious government conspiracy in this pulpy mystery caper.\" We thoroughly enjoyed what it has to offer on multiple levels and our exclusive chat with John Boyega is well worth reading for a peak behind the curtain on its production.

Two women are at the center of intrigue in Paul Feig’s mystery thriller when single mother Stephanie (Anna Kendrick) becomes friends with the mysterious Emily (Blake Lively) who suddenly disappears without a trace. When Stephanie goes on a mission to track her down, she stumbles upon something far more sinister than she could ever imagine. Lively is delicious as the scene-stealing femme fatale of Emily whose razor-sharp remarks and brilliantly bizarre behavior is topped off with jaw-dropping outfits and a 1960s French pop soundtrack.\n\n• Watch A Simple Favoron Netflix now\n\n• Watch A Simple Favor's YouTube trailer\n\nEmily the Criminal\n\nAge rating: R\n\nRuntime: 97 minutes\n\nMain cast: Aubrey Plaza, Theo Rossi, Gina Gershon, Brandon Sklenar, Megalyn Echikunwoke and Jonathan Avigdori\n\nDirector: John Patton Ford\n\nRT score: 94%\n\nRecommended by\n\nRecommended by\n\nMatt Bolton\n\nEmily the Criminal sees Aubrey Plaza take on the role of Emily, a college graduate who is struggling to find work due to her criminal record. In a desperate bid to make money, she becomes involved in a credit card fraud scheme which swiftly goes off the rails when she becomes romantically involved with the organizer. Plaza expertly embodies the despair that forces Emily to the lowest level of crime and is a gripping story of someone escaping constant turmoil. If you love a crime thriller, Emily the Criminal is a short, sharp movie that will have you hooked for the entire 97 minutes running time with gripping criminal activities.\n\n• Watch Emily the Criminal on Netflix now\n\n• Watch Emily the Criminal's YouTube trailer\n\nCaptain Phillips\n\nAge rating: PG-13\n\nRuntime: 134 minutes\n\nMain cast: Tom Hanks, Barkhad Abdi, Faysal Ahmed, Mahat M.

Phillips and his crew are defenceless against the brutality of pirate captain Abduwali Muse (Barkhad Abdi) and his group as Phillips must work out a way to ensure everyone's safety.

The first of those – Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery – is another elaborate and highly entertaining whodunnit from director Rian Johnson. Buoyed by its excellent ensemble cast and a confidence carried over from its predecessor’s success, Glass Onion is even showier and bolder than Knives Out – though the film proved exceptionally divisive among fans of Benoit Blanc's debut outing upon release.\n\n• Watch Glass Onion on Netflix now\n\n• Watch Glass Onion's YouTube trailer\n\nHow we choose the best Netflix movies\n\nTo land a place on our list of best Netflix movies, each title doesn't have to be a huge hit on the world's best streaming service (i.e. one of the most-streamed movies in the platform's entire history). Instead, the movie needs to pass two tests: hold an 80% critics score on Rotten Tomatoes (RT) and be personally recommended by one of the members of the TechRadar streaming team.\n\nOur team of writers include Matthew Bolton, Amelia Schwanke, Tom Power, Lucy Buglass and Grace Morris, who all write and watch movies every day. We have varying views of what makes a good movie, which means our personal tastes cover a wide-range of genres and even sub-genres like psychological thrillers, action adventures, superhero spectacles, supernatural horrors and romantic dramas.\n\nTogether, we use this criteria and our cinephile expertise to help inform which films we pick to be the best Netflix movies. There are thousands of movies to stream on Netflix and this changes every month with new arrivals and removals, so this is by no means an exhaustive list. Instead, make sure to check back in with us every month to see which new entries we add.\n\nFor more Netflix coverage, read our best Netflix documentaries and best Netflix shows guides.
