        "text": "It's that time of year again - St. Patrick's day - so we're looking at some patriotic picks on Netflix.\n\nThe streaming service has an impressive selection of Irish films and series at the moment.\n\nFirst off, here's our picks for the best TV dramas and comedies.\n\nDerry Girls\n\nIf you liked Irish star Nicola Coughlan's performance as Penelope Featherington in 'Bridgerton, you're going to love her as Clare Devlin in the 90s Northern Ireland-set comedy series 'Derry Girls'. During the Troubles, Clare, Erin, Erin's cousin Orla, their friend Michelle, and Michelle's English cousin James, navigate their teen years at a Catholic girls' secondary school.\n\nHardy Bucks\n\nThe comedy style is irreverent and often very bold, but 'Hardy Bucks' is great for a laugh. Following four lads from Mayo in their pursuit of a good time, the show was originally a series of webisodes before becoming a series with four seasons commissioned in 2010, 2011, 2015 and 2018. The show also inspired a hit movie in 2013 which follows the Hardy Bucks as they travel to Poland to support Ireland during UEFA Euro 2012.\n\nCan't Cope Won't Cope\n\nOne that you might have missed during its initial release is 'Can't Cope, Won't Cope'. Following the coming-of-age stories of two young friends living in Dublin (Seána Kerslake and the late Danika McGuigan), the honest and though-provoking series offers up a glimpse of the kind of struggles young people in Ireland go through as they navigate their twenties.\n\nJack Taylor\n\nThere are two characters that Iain Glen will be forever associated with. One is Jorah Mormont on 'Game of Thrones'. The other is Jack Taylor. Set in Galway, our hero is a former member of the Garda Síochána who becomes a \"finder\", or private investigator, after retiring. Produced between 2010 and 2016, it received a mixed reception from critics, being a bit much at times, but the series has garnered a lot of fans over the years.\n\nDominion's Creek, aka An Klondike\n\nKnown internationally as 'Dominion's Creek', 'An Klondike' was created by Dathaí Keane. If follows the Connolly Brothers, three Irish emigrants, who travel from Montana to the Yukon during the Klondike gold rush of the 1890s. Each has a different desire, and all come into conflict with the town of Dominion Creek's dangerous individuals.\n\nHere's our pick of Irish films...\n\nHunger\n\nMichael Fassbender's performances are often marked by serious commitment and a real embodiment of who he's playing. Playing Bobby Sands, one of the IRA prisoners who began a hunger strike at the Maze, Fassbender's performance was matched only by Liam Cunningham as the priest who tries to dissuade him from the protest. Directed by Steve McQueen, who would later direct Fassbender in 'Shame' and '12 Years A Slave', it's as disturbing and pointed as anything McQueen has done since then.\n\nMichael Inside\n\nWhen 'Michael Inside' hit cinemas, we gave the film five stars. We're sticking by our word that it is one of the best Irish films of recent years. It follows an 18 year old who is sentenced to 3 months in prison after being caught holding drugs for his friend's older brother. Never mind Hollywood - this is the most authentic representation of life in prison you'll ever see.\n\nBobby Sands: 66 Days\n\nThis critically acclaimed documentary is about the life of Bobby Sands and the 1981 Irish hunger strike from Northern Ireland. The movie hit cinemas 35 years on from his ultimate sacrifice. It draws much from his hunger strike diary, offering a unique insight into the man and his beliefs.\n\nCalm With Horses\n\nGrimly effective to the point of being almost gothic in parts, 'Calm With Horses' may tread over familiar grounds in Irish films. But it's done with grace and care. Cosmo Jarvis channels Marlon Brando for his role. Barry Keoghan continues his impressive streak of roles with a frightening, visceral performance.\n\nCardboard Gangsters\n\n'Love/Hate' star John Connors takes the lead in this contemporary Irish take on the gangster genre. It follows a 24 year old, Jason Connelly, as he and his friends attempt to take control of the Darndale drug trade. Things begin to unravel quickly as not everyone is willing to let these Cardboard Gangsters achieve the notoriety they crave without a fight.\n\nThe Hole in the Ground\n\n'The Hole in the Ground' stars Irish actress on the rise, Seana Kerslake. Her character is a young mother who has recently moved into a house on the fringes of a rural town with her son. Strange things start to occur, particularly disturbing changes in her little boy. As you can probably tell from the picture in the trailer below, not one for arachnophobes...\n\nHandsome Devil\n\nSome have described 'Handsome Devil' as inspired by 'Dead Poets Society', but really it's a film all its own. The movie follows the friendship that forms between loner Ned and star rugby player Conor when they are forced to share a bedroom at their boarding school. Andrew Scott ('Sherlock', 'Fleabag') plays their English teacher.\n\nKatie\n\nThe wonderful documentary 'Katie' is one the top Irish films on Netflix. Directed by Ross Whitaker ('Unbreakable: The Mark Pollock Story'), it showcases the incredible journey of Olympic champion boxer Katie Taylor. It's one of the best Irish sports docs out there and offers incredible insight into the legend that is Katie.\n\nExtra Ordinary\n\nThe best Irish comedy of 2019 and probably the best comedy of the year overall was 'Extra Ordinary'. It's a bit like 'Ghostbusters' if it was set in the west of Ireland. Maeve Higgins plays Rose, a lonely driving instructor whose special talent to communicate with ghosts is enlisted by a widower named Martin (Will Forte). Meanwhile one-hit wonder Christian Winter (Will Forte) hopes to regain fame by making a deal with the Devil.\n\nBroken Law"
