Whether they're anthology films made up of one sketch after another or movies that attempt to thread the style of popular sketch comedians' work into a continuous narrative, lovers of sketch comedy should find lots to appreciate here.",

A spoof of the controversial 1962 documentary \"Mondo Cane\", the film is largely plotless- a series of vignettes linked together by interstitial pieces featuring Mr. Mike discussing how upsetting and odd the sequences are.

The film is loosely structured as a series of comic sketches about the various stages of life, from the miracle of birth through to death and the afterlife.

The characters discuss things such as caffeine popsicles, Paris in the 1920s, and the use of nicotine as an insecticide – all while drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes. The film features actors like Robert Benigni, Steven Wright, Steve Buscemi and Steve Coogan, as well as musicians Tom Waits, Iggy Pop, and Jack and Meg White of the White Stripes playing themselves.

The plot serves as a springboard for various comedy sketches featuring The Onion's biting humor.
