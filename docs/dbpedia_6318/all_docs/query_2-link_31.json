Whether they're anthology films made up of one sketch after another or movies that attempt to thread the style of popular sketch comedians' work into a continuous narrative, lovers of sketch comedy should find lots to appreciate here.",

A spoof of the controversial 1962 documentary \"Mondo Cane\", the film is largely plotless- a series of vignettes linked together by interstitial pieces featuring Mr. Mike discussing how upsetting and odd the sequences are.

The film is loosely structured as a series of comic sketches about the various stages of life, from the miracle of birth through to death and the afterlife. It is the last film to feature all six Python members before Graham Chapman died in 1989.
