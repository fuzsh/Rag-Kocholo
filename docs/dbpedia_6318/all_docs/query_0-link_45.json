        "text": "Welcome to the WatchList, the ultimate what to watch guide. Each week our TV and movie experts curate a list of the best things to watch on the small - and sometimes big - screen.\n\nThis is the place to find what you should be streaming at the weekend and beyond.\n\nEach week our esteemed group of TV and movie reviewers impart their expert knowledge of all things streaming and boil it down to a handful of things you really need to be watching, going through hours of episodes to hep you make the most important decision of the week: what to watch in your down time.\n\nAs you will read, we look at all the new shows that have landed on Netflix, Prime Video, NOW, Apple TV Plus, Disney Plus and Paramount Plus and more, then give our verdict.\n\nIn short: if it's in the WatchList, then you know it is going to be good.\n\nAfter our recommendations of the week, we have links to all of our essential streaming guides - the rankings of which are voted by our readers, so if you haven't done so already then give them a click and have your say.\n\nAnd if you are still stuck with what to watch, then we have kept all of our previous recommendations so you can have a read.\n\nHappy viewing!\n\nEmily in Paris season 4\n\nThe first half of Emily in Paris season 4 is here. Gabriel is in love with Emily, and it’s set to cause all kinds of havoc, especially with Gabriel’s ex Camille just out of frame. This first half of the season is comprised of five episodes, with the other five due on 12 September. Some reviews have begun to tire of the Emily in Paris formula, but others say it’s just a joy to slip back into Emily’s somewhat unhinged world.\n\nStream now at Netflix\n\nBad Monkey\n\nA comedy series starring Vince Vaughn sounds like a magnet for mediocre reviews but Bad Monkey is a real critical hit. He’s no wedding crasher here, starring as a detective who has become a restaurant inspector after being demoted. However, he finds a severed arm while on duty, pulling him into a mystery. Also stars Rob Delaney and Michelle Monaghan. But the charm of Vaughn’s performance is the lead draw here.\n\nStream now at Apple TV Plus\n\nThe Tyrant\n\nIf there’s a non English language country whose productions you should pay attention to, it’s South Korea. The Tyrant is about a virus developed by the country, one designed to give people enhanced abilities. It’s intended to give the country an edge, but the US finds out about it, after the virus is stolen. And it causes an international incident. This show is written and directed by Park Hoon-jung, who wrote I Saw the Devil. Unusually, there are just four episodes in this series. You can plough through them in a weekend.\n\nStream now at Disney Plus\n\nThe Union\n\nThis Netflix movie stars Mark Wahlberg and Halle Berry. Wahlberg is Mike, who has an ordinary job. He’s a construction worker, but is pulled into a world of espionage and danger by his old high school girlfriend, Roxanne. She’s played by Berry. It lasts under two hours. Plenty of action. Silly premise. Sounds like the perfect movie for weekend streaming to us.\n\nStream now at Netflix\n\nHomicide Life On The Streets\n\nWe usually highlight brand new movies and TV shows in our What to Watch round-up, but this one is special. Homicide Life on the Streets is a 1990s police procedural show led by the brilliant Andrew Braugher. There are seven seasons, and this is one of the best shows you’ve probably never seen. It’s also even remastered in 4K and HDR. What a treat.\n\nStream now at Peacock (From August 19)\n\nOn the big screen…\n\nAlien: Romulus\n\nCould this be the best Alien film since Aliens? That’s what some think. It takes elements from all the previous mainline instalments, and amps up the horror to max out the impact of the alien’s presence. We absolutely recommend going to see it. But we also recommend going in not expecting the headline some — including us just now — have given it. That this is the best Alien flick since 1986. It’s too much weight for what is really just a pleasantly brutal time at the movies.\n\nOut now in cinemas\n\nWe have spent A LONG time watching things on all these streaming services. So, if you want more of an in-depth look at the shows and movies you can stream the please head to the following guides.\n\nThe best Apple TV Plus shows, revealed\n\nThe best Netflix shows and best movies on Netflix\n\nThe best Amazon Prime Series and best movies on Amazon Prime Video\n\nThe best Disney Plus shows and best Disney Plus movies\n\nThe best NOW TV shows and best movies on NOW TV\n\nThe best Paramount Plus shows\n\nPreviously on The WatchList...\n\nA Good Girl's Guide to Murder\n\nNetflix’s latest big hit is A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder, based on a book by Holly Jackson. Pip Fitz-Amobi is a 17-year-old who begins to think a local murder may not have gone as everyone else thinks it did. Five years before, Andie was murdered. It was concluded her boyfriend did it. But he took his own life after the crime. But perhaps the truth isn't that simple. An engaging 6-part series.\n\nStream now at Netflix (US)\n\nStream now at BBC iPlayer (UK)\n\nUmbrella Academy season 4\n\nThe fourth and final season of The Umbrella Academy is here, finishing off the show after five years. There are just six episodes. And this is by far the least well-received of the seasons so far. But, hey, it's good to once see a fan-favourite show get a proper send-off rather than a classic brutal Netflix cancellation. The Hargreeves crew are back to tackle a world-ending event, and have to collapse a bunch of alternative timelines in order to restore the universe.\n\nStream now at Netflix\n\nThe Instigators\n\nDamon and Affleck in a heist comedy? This would once have been the stuff of big box office earnings. But this is 2024, and we're talking Casey Affleck, not Ben, whose career has been on the rocks since 2010 when he was accused of sexual harassment. The Insitigators is still a major project, though, an Apple TV+ movie from Doug Liman, who also directed the brilliant Edge of Tomorrow, the fun American Made and Amazon's Road House. It’s not Liman’s best, but we’ve seen far worse streamer original movies\n\nStream now at Apple TV+\n\nCowboy Cartel\n\nThis documentary series from Apple TV is about how a violent Mexican drug cartel used horse racing to launder millions and millions of dollars. Or, more to the point, it's really about how a team of agents at the FBI managed to bring them to justice. Without getting killed in the process. It’s a 4-episode series, and all four are thankfully available to watch now.\n\nStream now at Apple TV+\n\nLove is Blind: UK\n\nLove it or hate it, trashy reality TV is big news on streaming. And Love is Blind is contemporary trash royalty. We’ve had six US seasons since 2020. Now it's the UK's turn. Missed this show so far? The premise is pretty wild. Couples go on dates and get engaged without ever actually seeing each other, while the men and women live in Love Island style tribes to keep the chat flowing. It's not for everyone, but is binge gold for the right viewer. Presented by Matt and Emma Willis.\n\nStream now at Netflix\n\nThe Influencer\n\nNow here’s an odd one. A real curio. The Influencer is a South Korean show, a reality TV competition in which real influencers across TikTok, YouTube, Instagram duke it out. They compete for the attention of the public, in real influencer-style tasks, and wear neck bands that show their follower numbers. The Influencer has been compared to The Hunger Games. And, yep, there are some real dystopia vibes here. But can we really say our influencer culture is that much better?\n\nStream now at Netflix\n\nJoe Rogan: Burn the Boats\n\nLove him or hate him, Joe Rogan has become a major cultural figure. This is his third Netflix special, and features the kind of incendiary topics you might expect from the world-famous podcast host. The reviews say, as most of us know, Rogan isn't exactly as world-class a comic as his cultural stature might suggest. But, hey, whether you’re a fan or merely curious, you may want to dip into Burn the Boats.\n\nStream now at Netflix\n\nWomen in Blue\n\nThis show is about the first female police force in Mexico City. It’s set in the early 1970s, making it ripe for representations of sexism an order of magnitude worse than what we see today. And this female squad ends up on the hunt of a serial killer. It’s based on real-life events, in a typically very loose way. However, it really works as a thriller, and is tinged with horror in parts.\n\nStream now at Apple TV+\n\nFuturama season 12\n\n25 years in, Futurama is on its 12th season. This latest bunch consists of 10 episodes, but with one released a week on stream, it’s just like watching back in 1999. We’ve had a chance to see the first couple of episodes, and they feature Futurama-themed skewerings of NFTs and Squid Game. It’s fun comfort viewing.\n\nStream now at Disney+\n\nSaving Bikini Bottom: The Sandy Cheeks Movie\n\n25 years (again) after the first SpongeBob Squarepants episodes, the brand is apparently sill so strong it can power a spin-off. Sandy Cheeks gets her own Netflix movie. Bikini Bottom is scooped right out of the ocean, and the gang needs to head to Texas in order to get it back. So, yeah, while this may be a Sandy Cheeks movie, it still absolutely features everyone’s favourite sea sponge.\n\nStream now at Netflix\n\nBatman: Caped Crusader\n\nWe’re in a golden era of animation, particularly if you loved the 90s shows that proved formative for so many millennials. Batman: Caped Crusader revives the spirit of the 1990s cartoons, pitching the superhero as a noir detective. If you need more proof it’s worth a watch, just check out its perfect 100% Rotten Tomatoes rating (at the time of writing, anyway).\n\nStream now at Prime Video\n\nFantasmas\n\nThis unusual comedy show came to the US in June but has just arrived in the UK courtesy of Sky’s NOW. It comes from a former SNL writer and has received mixed reviews, in the best kind of way, with write-ups ranging from perfect scores to stinkers. Which side will you fall on? Well, how of you feel about talking puppets? This is part sketch show, part full narrative, and is packed with creativity. There are just six episodes, 30 minutes a piece, with cameos from Paul Dano, Emma Stone, Steve Buscemi and more.\n\nThe Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare\n\nWhat’s wrong with a good old-fashioned action movie? The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare takes us back to a time when even stories based on serious history could be almost entirely irreverent. This movie is directed by Guy Ritchie and stars Henry Cavill as part of a team charged with taking out the German U-boat fleet during World War II. It’s silly, fun, and action-packed. But not not one for the up-tight history sticklers.\n\nStream now at Prime Video\n\nThe Decameron\n\nThe Black Death isn’t the most obvious fodder for comedy, but that’s The Decameron’s deal. A bunch of rich folks escape the city of Florence as the plague breaks out, and it all gets a bit debauched. While this show is very roughly based on a series of 14th century short stories by Giovanni Boccaccio, The Decameron’s feel is absolutely up-to-date.\n\nStream now at Netflix\n\nTime Bandits\n\nTrying to adapt one of Terry Gilliam’s most beloved works is a tall order, thanks to the auteur’s specific style and sense of comedy. The original was a film. This is a 10-episode series headed up by Jermaine Clement, Taika Waititi and Inbetweeners writer Iain Morris. An 11-year-old boy teams up with a bunch of young thieves in a time-travelling troupe led by Lisa Kudrow’s Penelope. Reviewers are split on whether it stacks up to the original, but the more positive ones love it.\n\nStream now at Apple TV+\n\nDoom Scroll: Andrew Tate and the Dark Side of the Internet\n\nAndrew Tate has become a figurehead of the negative forces impacting younger generations of men and boys, and with good reason. He’s a bad egg. But it’s not just the message that has entranced so many people. The ways people are stewarded towards his content though social media algorithms are to blame too. This documentary looks at both sides of this.\n\nStream now at NOW\n\nElsbeth\n\n2009’s The Good Wife really did have legs. Despite ending in 2016, its legacy lives on. First we had The Good Fight, a spin off that ran from 2017. And now we have Elsbeth. Its creators say this isn’t a strict The Good Wife spin off, but it does feature a character from the original show’s universe. It’s a detective series starring Carrie Preston, from the original series.\n\nStream now at NOW\n\nDirty Pop: The Boy Band Scam\n\nToday we know NYSNC and the Backstreet Boys as some of the most successful US boybands of all time. But did you know there was a scam behind them? It was the work of Lou Perlman, who generated a Ponzi scheme out of their success. This is the disturbing story of that era. The documentary itself is controversial, through the use of AI techniques to alter the presentation of some of the talking heads. But the story itself is interesting and alarming.\n\nStream now at Netflix\n\nAnd on the big screen...\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine\n\nAre you ready for the big one? Deadpool & Wolverine is finally here, a last attempt to bridge the gap between eras of the MCU. In case you’ve been avoiding the hype, the film sees two superhero luminaries team up for an all-the-fall comedy-action adventure. Reviews are mixed. It’s either seen as a blast or a cynical corporate exercise. Go in with an open mind and see how you feel.\n\nIn cinemas now\n\nLady in the Lake\n\nNatalie Portman stars in this seven-part adaptation of a novel by Laura Lippman. She’s a bored housewife who becomes a crime investigator, looking into a murder in 1960s America. Ambitious and sumptuous, this is a classic Apple TV production. Reviews range from impeccable to irritated, but the best are positively luminescent. This also happens to be Portman’s TV debut.\n\nStream now at Apple TV Plus\n\nCobra Kai season 6\n\nThe last season of Cobra Kai, based on The Karate Kid, has arrived on Netflix. It starts on a light note, but we can already sense the tension starting to mount in this sixth season. Netflix is trying an unusual release schedule for this one too, to really max out on the beloved show’s swan song. It’s coming in three parts. The first five episodes are out now. The second five are due in November. The last aren’t out until 2025. So while we’re on the final season, it’s almost as if there are two more coming. Each part consists of five episodes.\n\nStream now at Netflix\n\nFor Those About To Die\n\nLooking forward to Gladiator 2? You won’t want to miss this show. It’s a brutal and violent look at the lives of gladiators back in the Roman Empire days. Anthony Hopkins stars as emperor Vespasian, chewing up the scenery, while Ian Rheon is Tenax. He is a crime boss who has his eyes on power. It’s pulpy rather than truly realistic, but good fun.\n\nStream now at Prime Video\n\nLaliga: All Access\n\nWhat timing. Fresh off a Euros win for Spain, Netflix has release Laliga: All Access. It’s a behind-the-scenes documentary series about the inner workings of the Spanish football league. We get to follow the events of the 2023/2024 season, with a partial focus on Barcelona.\n\nStream now at Netflix\n\nMr Bigstuff\n\nDanny Dyer has become an unlikely UK national treasure in recent years. But in Mr Bigstuff he goes full comedy. It’s a show about two chalk-and-cheese brothers. Dyer plays one, an alpha drug addict. Ryan Sampson plays the other, the anxiety ridden Glen, who is just trying to live a normal life.\n\nStream now at Sky\n\nIron Claw\n\nCould this be Zac Efron’s best performance of his career? Iron Claw sees Efron play Kevin, one of the Von Erich brothers. They were a real professional wrestling family, who performed in the 1970s. This powerful film charts the brothers’ lives through three decades, and is an affecting biopic worth checking out. And, yep, an interest in wrestling is absolutely not required.\n\nStream now at Prime Video\n\nVikings: Valhalla season 3\n\nIt’s the end of the road for a show long-running enough to be a minor institution. Valhalla is a spin-off to the original Vikings, first broadcast in 2013. Its third and last season has been released, bringing the story to a close. Some of the loose ends get tied up in a slightly rushed fashion, but we’ll take that over a swift cancellation and a cliffhanger ending any day.\n\nStream now at Netflix\n\nMastermind: To Think Like a Killer\n\nThis documentary series looks into the minds of some of the most infamous killers. It centres around Ann Burgess, who was one of the leading figures in criminal profiling. She worked in the FBI as a profiler and researcher from the late 1970s. It’s a three-part series that looks into her career. And, in doing so, we get a look on the changing view on serial killers and dangerous criminals.\n\nStream now at Disney Plus\n\nVikings: Valhalla Season 3\n\nVikings: Valhalla puts up its axe with season three, which has just landed on Netflix. This is not just the end of an offshoot series, but the whole Vikings saga, which began more than a decade ago. The vikings are diminishing, and it’s time to tie off some of these long-running storylines.\n\nStream now at Netflix\n\nReceiver\n\nNetflix has a history of producing great documentary series that let you get behind the scenes of some of the most popular sports. F1: Drive to Survive, anyone? Receiver does the same for the NFL. It’s also the sequel to Quarterback, the well-regarded 2023 series. As the name suggests, though, we’re looking at folks who play in different positions this time. Players featured include George Kittle, Davante Adams and Deb Samuel.\n\nStream now at Netflix\n\nSausage Party: Foodtopia\n\nThe original Sausage Party was an unlikely 2016 hit. An R-rated comedy that looks like the black sheep offspring of Pixar and Dreamworks? Well, it did work, picking up great reviews and even solid box office numbers. They’ve done it again, with a TV show sequel that, mostly, still slaps. Well, as long as you can handle the sheer crassness and rough-n-ready production values. Seth Rogen and Kristen Wiig return to lead the cast too.\n\nStream now at Netflix\n\nSpent\n\nMia is a model whose career is coming to an end. She is out of cash and low on opportunities. Spent is a smart comedy that looks into how this character squares the first half of her life with… whatever’s coming next. It’s written by and stars Michelle de Swarte, who based the show on her own experiences as a model.\n\nStream now at BBC iPlayer\n\nSunny\n\nRashida Joenes is Suzie, an American woman in Kyoto whose family disappears in a plane crash. She is granted a domestic AI robot to fill the void. But as she gets to know the thing, she starts to uncover details on what really happened to her husband and son. This high-concept thriller comedy could have gone either way. But it’s actually great, bringing a more thoughtful edge to a typically light 30-minute format. What else do you expect from A24, the studio famous for its brilliant arthouse movies?\n\nStream now at Apple TV Plus\n\nExploding Kittens\n\nTV and movies gets made using all kinds of inspirations. But a card game? That’s an unusual source. Exploding Kittens is roughly based on the card party game, which is a bit like Russian Roulette. This is one to approach with morbid curiosity rather than excitement, as it has picked up some pretty dreadful reviews. The Guardian called it “infuriating and life-sapping,” although others enjoyed Tom Ellis as the cat that considers itself to be god.\n\nStream now at Netflix\n\nBeverly Hills Cop - Alex F\n\n40 years on from the original movie, Eddie Murphy is back as Axel Foley in a brand new Beverly Hills Cop film. His daughter’s life is in danger, which sees him return to his old stalking ground. He also teams up with both old associate Billy (Judge Reinhold) and a new partner, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt.\n\nStream now at Netflix\n\nThe Mole season 2\n\nPeople can’t get enough of games of deception these days. The Mole sees a team of players head out to Malaysia to complete tasks and build up their prize money. But one of the players, The Mole, is charged with messing up the whole enterprise. You may enjoy this show if you are a fan of The Traitors.\n\nStream now at Netflix\n\nSupacell\n\nThis TV show gives the tired superhero genre a shot in the arm. A bunch of ordinary black people from South London suddenly develop superpowers. There’s nothing particular that links them, but they’ll have to get together in order to make a difference. This one has picked up great reviews, and has a totally different feel to the kinda to superhero shows you’d see on Disney Plus.\n\nStream now at Netflix\n\nThe Bear Season 3\n\nOne of the best-reviewed TV shows of a generation. But is season 3 as good? Is has received by far the most mixed reviews we’ve seen for The Bear to date. But even those say that, at its heights, this is one of the best TV shows on broadcast right now. However, it goes without saying that if you’ve loved the first two seasons you need to bite into this one when you build up the confidence/appetite.\n\nStream now at Disney Plus\n\nMy Lady Jane\n\nA period drama of a different kind. My Lady Jane is based on the story of Lady Jane Gray, but loosely. She is known for lasting on the throne for just nine days before being executed. This adapation of a YA novel reworks the facts, and injects supernatural animal transformations, and adds more ass-kicking and sass. It’s a good-time watch.\n\nStream now at Prime Video\n\nThe Man with 1000 Kids\n\nA documentary that breaks out of the true crime mould, The Man with 1000 Kids is about a serial spern donator in the Netherlands. Lax enforcement means he manages to radically go beyond the limits of a sperm donor. To the extent there are worries about involuntary incest. Yikes. It’s a three-episode series that, well, is kinda horrifying.\n\nStream now at Netflix\n\nHouse of the Dragon season 2\n\nThe Game of Thrones spin-off is back for season 2. And the quality level hasn’t dropped. It enters on the verge of civil war, as House Targaryen is riven in two. Dramatic stuff. There are only eight episodes in this season, compared to 10 in the first, and they are being drip-fed onto streaming\n\nStream now at NOW\n\nCult Massacre: One Day in Jonestown\n\nThis three-part documentary series looks into the Jonestown massacre. In the late 70s, hundreds of cult members drunk a mixture of cyanide and grape juice, ending their lives. This is where the “drink the Kool-aid” saying comes from. The doc uses archival footage to tell the story of the days surrounding the deaths of 918 people. If you don’t know much about cult leader Jim Jones, once part of the pop culture vernacular, this series is worth watching.\n\nStream now at Disney Plus\n\nTrigger Warning\n\nEver wondered why you have’\\t seen Jessica Alba in a while? She’s back in Trigger Warning, a revenge thriller action movie. Is it any good? Not really. But these largely unoriginal action movies seem to go down a treat on streaming. Alba is a commando who takes down a gang menacing her hometown after she takes over her father’s bar.\n\nStream now at Netflix\n\nFive Nights at Freddy’s\n\nA horror movie based on a mobile game? This one got absolutely slammed at review, but Five Nights at Freddy’s is a gaming phenomenon some kids won’t want to miss on streaming. It’s rated PG-13, making this far fore suitable for a slightly younger audience than the average horror movie. This is definitely one for fans of the games rather than a general audience. But it’s nice to see Josh Hutcherson on our screens again. It’s been a while since he played Peeta in the Hunger Games movies.\n\nStream now at NOW\n\nThe Boys season 4\n\nOne of Prime Video’s most beloved shows is back for what we now know to be the penultimate season. This fourth run shines a light on the current political scene in the US, in characteristic The Boys fashion. That means there’s plenty of violence, satire and gore. Oh, and those corrupt superheroes you know and love. And kinda hate.\n\nStream now at Prime Video\n\nHit Man\n\nHit Man stars Glen Powell as a man who poses as a hired killer in order to bust people for the New Orleans police department. But the plan goes off piste when he is hired by Madison (Adria Arjona) who asks him to kill her husband. This Richard Linklater-directed movie is written by Linklater and star Glen Powel. It combines real thriller chops with comedy to great effect, and is flat-out enjoyable.\n\nStream now at Netflix\n\nRemembering Gene Wilder\n\nTo the onlooker, Gene Wilder was a wild and unsettling ball of energy, a screen presence like no other. This documentary provides a closer look at the real character of the man, who died back in 2016. It’s a gentle watch, a documentary filled with love for its subject rather than one looking to dig into whatever darker recesses there may have been. But perhaps that’s a good fit for this movie-making icon.\n\nStream now at Netflix\n\nThe First Omen\n\nHorror sequels have a bad reputation, one formed from decades of rubbish follow-ups. The First Omen is surprisingly great. It’s a prequel to the original Omen movie from 1976, telling the tale of the beginnings of this demonic conspiracy. This is also easily the best movie in the now six-film franchise, bar the original. Tense, gory and with surprising weight and texture, you should check this one out.\n\nStream now at Disney Plus\n\nPresumed Innocent\n\nIn 1990 a film of Scott Turow’s 1986 novel Presumed Innocent was released. It starred Harrison Ford, and was pretty good. There’s now a TV adaptation, starring Jake Gyllenhaal in his first major TV role. He plays Rusty Sabich, a prosecutor sent to investigate the murder of his co-worker, who was also his secret lover. This TV version hasn’t quite eclipsed the movie, but is a solid watch and, like most Apple TV+ shows, looks great.\n\nStream now at Apple TV+\n\nBridgerton\n\nThe second half of the third season of Bridgerton is out, letting us discover what happens to Colin and Penelope. But there’s also a major story switcheroo ahead for Francesca. The critics can’t agree whether this second half of the season marks a tightening up of things from the first, or it going a wee bit off the rails. So why not give it a watch and make up your own mind?\n\nStream now at Netflix\n\nUnder Paris\n\nHorror, gore and sharks fans take note. Under Paris is a movie you should not miss. It’s a classic shark movie, set in Paris. A mutated shark is terrorising the waters of the Seine, and a triathlon is about to begin. It’s up to a grieving scientist, played by Bérénice Bejo, to avert tragedy. This one doesn’t let up. It’s in French, but don’t fear the subtitles. Fear the shark.\n\nStream now at Netflix\n\nGodzilla Minus One\n\nNot seen Godzilla Minus One? After 70 years of Godzilla movies, this one dukes it out with the very first for the title of the best of the lot. It’s that good. Our protagonist was a kamikaze pilot during World War II, and he is one of the first people to witness Godzilla, before it emerges from the ocean to wreak havoc upon Japan. This is a more human story than that of the average monster movie, and looks fantastic despite, in Hollywood terms, costing pennies.\n\nStream now at Netflix\n\nSweet Tooth season 3\n\nCritically lauded fantasy series Sweet Tooth comes to an end with season 3, an eight-episode run. While not without its rough spots, this is a fitting end to a brilliant series. Also, if you’re the kind of person who only digs into a series when you know it’s not going to get cancelled, leaving you on a cliffhanger, it’s time to start Sweet Tooth season one.\n\nStream now at Netflix\n\nThe Acolyte\n\nDisney Plus has another slice of Star Wars pie for the faithful. The Acolyte is set long before the events of the main line Star Wars films. Jedis are going missing, and it’s up to a Padawan and her Jedi Master to get to the root of the mystery. In doing so, they find the conspiracy that goes deeper than they ever imagined. It’s no Andor, but is better than some of the recent Star Wars efforts.\n\nStream now at Disney Plus\n\nThe Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live\n\nThis spin-off of The Walking Dead sees a return to one of the series’s classic storylines. Andrew Lincoln and Danai Gurira star as Rick and Michonne, reprising the love story that was a key feature of the show before Lincoln left the main The Walking Dead series in 2021. If you miss having Andrew Lincoln in the show, this is a sweet coda for his character.\n\nStream now at NOW\n\nEric\n\nThis one has been on our radar for a while. Benedict Cumberbatch is Vincent, a puppeteer in the show’s equivalent of Sesame Street. His son, aged just nine years old, goes missing. To find him, Vincent will need the help of an imaginary seven-foot-tall blue monster, Eric. But it’s no fun puppet adventure. Eric is dark, about a father drive almost mad by guilt and grief.\n\nStream now at Netflix\n\nGeek Girl\n\nHarriet is the geek of this latest slice of Netflix YA TV. She’s awkward, feels out of place in normal life. But then she's picked out by a talent scout to become a fashion model, whirling her away into a world of high fashion. House of the Dragon’s Emily Carey stars as Harriet, and does a cracking job of keeping this fun, well-meaning show bouncing along. And it's not just froth, with a look into neurodivergence and bullying.\n\nStream now at Netflix\n\nJim Henson: Idea Man\n\nJim Henson was the master of puppets, the creative mind behind the Muppets, The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth. This documentary looks back into his life and career, using archive footage and interviews to shed light on a figure almost universally loved, but about whom you may not know a great deal. It's also directed by another legend of cinema, Ron Howard. A charming watch.\n\nStream now at Disney Plus\n\nDancing for the Devil\n\nA true crime show about TikTok? No, this one is not about Chinese state intervention, but a management company that might just be a cult. That group is 7M, which signs up dancers to take them to social media success. At the top of 7M, though, is Robert Shinn, a pastor of the Shekinah Church. He’s your classic cult leader, who gradually separates 7M sign-ups from their families, and their money, and abuses them. Three parts. 45 minutes a piece.\n\nStream now at Netflix\n\nJurassic World Chaos Theory\n\nWant to get your kids into Jurassic Park but don't want to give them nightmares with the still-brilliant original? Stick on Chaos Theory. It's a 7+/PG-rated animated show in which the survivors of Jurassic World's story come together after six years. They are being hunted, and have to find out why. It's a darker follow-on to Camp Cretaceous, and a great watch for older kids.\n\nStream now at Netflix\n\nThe Beach Boys\n\nWere The Beach Boys the quintessential American boy band? This new documentary from Disney+ seems to think so. It charts the band’s glory days of the 1960s, their hit albums and those timeless songs. This isn’t a particularly searching doc, and isn’t one to dig into the band’s darker side and later less successful years. But it's still worth a watch.\n\nStream now at Disney Plus\n\nThe Blue Angels\n\nThe ultimate way to watch this documentary about the US Navy’s flight team would be in an IMAX cinema. But the living room will have to do. It’s still a real visual spectacle that makes you appreciate the sheer skill of some of these pilots. And the stakes involved when flying at those speeds, in those planes.\n\nStream now at Prime Video\n\nAcma:Game\n\nAcma:Game was originally a manga first published just over a decade ago in 2013. Now it’s a live action thriller. But the plot is still pure manga madness. Players of Acma:Game must collect 99 devil's keys, which will grant their wishes. There are seven episodes of the first season.\n\nStream now at Prime Video\n\nThe Blue Beetle\n\nThe MCU gets a bad rap these days. It mostly deserves it. But The Blue Beetle is actually a good film, even if it was a total flop at the box office in 2023. It probably doesn’t help that most of us have never heard of this superhero. A law student becomes The Blue Beetle when he dons the bio-robot suit, which becomes part of him. There’s much more heart to this film than other Marvel fare of late.\n\nStream now at NOW\n\nAtlas\n\nAtlas has the makings of one of Netflix's most successful movies ever. Strong female lead with a veteran of the field? A high-concept plot? And mediocre reviews? We’re onto a winner folks. Jennifer Lopez stars as Atlas Shepherd, a scientist with a deep mistrust of AI. But when rogue AI threatens humanity, it's to another AI “being” she has to turn to in order to save the day.\n\nStream now at Netflix\n\nInsomnia\n\nA drama starring Vicky McClure? We're in. However, Insomnia is not the average McClure vehicle. It’s not a crime investigation procedural, but a thriller in which her character, Emma, starts to think she may be suffering from the same mental health problems that plagued her mother. The bad news: only two eps have dropped as we write this, the other four releasing one a week into June.\n\nStream now at Paramount Plus\n\nOn the big screen...\n\nFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga\n\nGeorge Miller went with the “more is more” approach. We get more story, more set pieces, more character development and a longer run time. It’s a very different film, but still manages to evoke the sun-baked ferocity than made Fury Road so distinctive. Best experienced on a very big screen with a large, loud sound system attached.\n\nin cinemas now\n\nBridgerton season 3\n\nPeriod piece fluff Bridgerton is back for a third season. Part 1 sees Nicola Coughlan’s Penelope go from a lonely singleton to receiving multiple marriage proposals. There’s plenty of sauciness and sex scenes in this 4-episode pack. The other four episodes of Bridgerton season 3 will arrive on June 13. Some say the show has gone off the boil, but it’s the freshest of the three seasons at Rotten Tomatoes at the time of writing.\n\nStream now at Netflix\n\nMaxton Hall\n\nFan of YA content? Check out Maxton Hall. It’s a TV show based on a novel that was a smash hit in Germany. And, yes, this one is a German-language series. Ruby is a scholarship student at the ultra-posh Maxton Hall school, and finds herself caught up with privileged millionaire James Beaufort, despite hating much of what he stands for.\n\nStream now at Prime Video\n\nAshley Madison: Sex, Lies & Scandal\n\nIn 2015 a dating platform was hacked, leading to tens of millions of users’ data being posted online. To make matters worse, it was Ashley Madison, an app for people looking for extramarital affairs. This 3-part documentary looks into the history of the dating service, and how the hack affected those whose antics were revealed in the leak.\n\nStream now at Netflix\n\nMurder In Successville\n\nAmericans are highly skilled at making stuff worse. They certainly showed that off with the US Netflix remake of Murder in Successville. But now the original BBC version is available on Netflix too, and order has been restored. In each episode a celeb joins the cast, to solve a murder, blending improv and scripted comedy with hilarious results.\n\nStream now at Netflix\n\nBodkin\n\nA murder. A rural town. A pair of investigators. This sounds like the stuff of a dark and twisty TV show, right? Bodkin isn’t. It’s a comedy series starring Will Forte, Siobhán Cullen and Robyn Cara as a true crime podcast-making team who end up investigating the disappearance of three people on the Irish coast. Sure, you could see it as a send-up of crime shows and podcasts, but there’s also an actual mystery here. It’s comedy plus thriller."
