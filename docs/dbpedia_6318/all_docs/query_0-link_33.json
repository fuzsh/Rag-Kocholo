        "text": "Friday 16 August\n\nModern Movie Soundtracks At the Proms\n\nBBC Four, 8pm\n\nIt has become a tradition in recent years for the Proms to include a night or two themed around the most populist form of classical music: TV and film scores. Tonight’s eclectic celebration of movie soundtracks from the 2020s was recorded earlier this week at the Royal Albert Hall and is presented by Edith Bowman, and showcases some of contemporary cinema’s most compelling composers.\n\nVolker Bertelmann’s Oscar-winning work on 2022 war epic All Quiet on the Western Front, for instance, is just one of many pieces played here by The London Contemporary Orchestra, conducted by Robert Ames. Elsewhere, you can enjoy Jerskin Fendrix’s quirky score for Frankenstein riff Poor Things; Hildur Guðnadóttir’s eerie soundtrack for cancel-culture satire Tár and Jed Kurzel’s composition for bloody action-flick Monkey Man. There are some exceptions to the theme, with TV shows including Netflix hit Squid Game (whose score was composed by Jung Jae II) getting their time in the spotlight. The night concludes with Max Richter’s devastating On the Nature of Daylight, made famous by the terrific sci-fi film Arrival. SK\n\nOur Lives: Two Sisters, One Goal\n\nBBC One, 7.30pm\n\nThe slice-of-life docu-series returns with the story of Katy and Emma, two sisters from the Welsh village of Brynamman who have decided to arrange an all-star charity football match between Wales and England. They have to find a venue, persuade celebrities and find two big-name managers. The only problem? Neither of them know anything about football.\n\nA New Australian Adventure\n\nBBC Two, 9pm\n\nMiriam Margolyes concludes her Australian odyssey with a visit to Broken Hill, the outback town whose famous mines are dwindling, along with its population. It is an episode themed around reinvention, both for Broken Hill and Margolyes herself, who is adapting to life after a critical heart operation. “If you don’t grow,” she says wisely, “you diminish”.\n\nChampions: Full Gallop\n\nITV1, 9pm\n\nTonight we go behind the scenes of one of the most famous races in the calendar – the Grand National. The million-pound prize pot draws a field of 34 riders, although tonight’s big characters are ambitious trainers Dan Skelton and Willie Mullins.\n\nHostage\n\nMore4, 9pm & 10pm\n\nThis slick six-part Swedish thriller, based on the novel by Kristina Ohlsson, has a killer concept. A plane has been hijacked by terrorists demanding the release of a detained professor. The twist? The co-pilot of the plane is the estranged son of a police officer in charge of rescuing the hostages.\n\nRev\n\nBBC Two, 10pm\n\nIt has been 14 years since the first episode of Rev premiered, and the wry clerical comedy still feels as fresh as ever. The key, of course, is the masterful Tom Hollander, whose disgruntled London priest Adam subverts the idea of the cosy village vicar in favour of something grittier and soulful. A repeat well worth tucking into.\n\nThe Golden Cobra\n\nBBC Three, 10pm & 10.15pm\n\nThis crudely animated cartoon comedy has shades of 2003 cult favourite Monkey Dust, rendering it an acquired taste. It is set around a surreally hellish takeaway in the Welsh valleys, whose curries melt through the floor like acid. In the first of tonight’s two episodes (each 15 minutes long), owner Basil tries to murder a health inspector.\n\nThe Union (2024)\n\nNetflix\n\nMark Wahlberg has certainly had his practice playing agents or officers unafraid to get their hands dirty (or bloody): just cast your mind back to The Corruptor, Patriots Day or Mile 22. In this new action flick from Julian Farino (Giri/Haji), he plays a down-on-his-luck guy who runs into his ex-girlfriend (Halle Berry) at a high-school reunion. One small twist: she’s now a secret agent, and soon drags him into her world of guns and criminal gangs.\n\nDangerous Minds (1995) ★★★\n\n5STAR, 9pm\n\nCritics had mixed feelings towards this drama starring Michelle Pfeiffer: some found it moving, others thought it was full of stereotypes. The soundtrack, featuring Coolio’s Gangsta’s Paradise, however, was a sure-fire hit, topping the charts and certified platinum. Pfeiffer plays a former Marine who takes up a teaching gig at a tough high school near LA. The kids try to wear her down, but her training soon comes in clutch.\n\nBraveheart (1995) ★★★★\n\nBBC One, 10.40pm\n\nMel Gibson sports his woad, his sporran and one of the oddest accents committed to film to play William Wallace in this shouty, gory Highland epic chock full of memorable quotes (“The trouble with Scotland is that it’s full of Scots”). It’s great fun, though perhaps undeserving of its Best Picture Oscar (it won four more). Sophie Marceau, as a sultry love interest, cranks up the anachronism – in reality, Isabella of France was then only six years old.\n\nSpy (2015) ★★★\n\nITV1, 10.45pm\n\nBridesmaids director Paul Feig reunites with Melissa McCarthy for this espionage comedy. McCarthy plays CIA operative Susan, who gets the career break she’s been waiting for when she’s sent to Europe to follow Rose Byrne’s villainous Rayna. There’s plenty of f-bombs, toilet humour and fun action sequences, and Jason Statham and Miranda Hart offer solid support. Feig’s new film Jackpot is on Amazon Prime Video from Thursday.\n\nFilm of the Week: Moon (2009) ★★★★★\n\nBBC Two, 11.05pm\n\nHuman beings have long been obsessed with the planets that exist, far, far away, from our own here on Earth. But no distant object found in space captures our imagination quite like the Moon: from Moonfall to Gravity and First Man. This spectacular sci-fi film by Duncan Jones (née Zowie Bowie, son of David who introduced his son to the world of 8mm one-stop animation) is among the finest; its echoes of Stanley Kubrick’s masterpiece, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and its quiet beauty, make it hard to believe that it marked his directorial debut (he scooped the Bafta for Outstanding Debut by a British Writer). The film follows Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell, who went on to win an Oscar for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri), the only worker in a mining facility on the far side of the Moon, who discovers a chilling truth about his life as he nears the end of his three-year stint of solitude. The creeping sense that something has gone amiss lingers over the film like a blanket of dread, as Sam descends further into unease and starts experiencing mysterious visions; overshadowing any chance he has at a happy reunion with his wife (Dominique McElligott) and young daughter.\n\nTelevision previewers"
