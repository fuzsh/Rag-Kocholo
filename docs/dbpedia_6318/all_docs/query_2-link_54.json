        "text": "History[]\n\nSilent film era[]\n\nThe first comedy film was L'Arroseur Arrosé (1895), directed and produced by film pioneer Louis Lumière. Less than 60 seconds long, it shows a boy playing a prank on a gardener. The most noted comedy actors of the silent film era (1895-1927) were Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, and Buster Keaton.\n\nSub-types[]\n\nTemplate:Tone\n\nAnarchic comedy[]\n\nThe anarchic comedy film, as its name suggests, is a random or stream-of-consciousness type of humour which often lampoons a form of authority.[1] The genre dates from the silent era. Notable examples of this type of film are those produced by Monty Python.[2] Others include National Lampoon's Animal House (1978) and Marx Brothers films such as Duck Soup (1933).\n\nBathroom comedy (or gross out comedy)[]\n\nGross out films are a relatively recent development and rely heavily on vulgar, sexual, or \"toilet\" humor. They often contain a healthy dose of profanity.[3] Examples include: Porky's (1982), Dumb and Dumber (1994), There's Something About Mary (1998), and American Pie (1999).\n\nComedy of ideas[]\n\nThis sub-type uses comedy to explore serious ideas such as religion, sex, or politics. Often, the characters represent particular divergent world views and are forced to interact for comedic effect and social commentary.[4] Some examples include both Bob Roberts (1992) and MASH (1970).\n\nComedy of manners[]\n\nA comedy of manners satirizes the mores and affectations of a social class. The plot of a comedy of manners is often concerned with an illicit love affair or some other scandal. However, the plot is generally less important for its comedic effect than its witty dialogue. This form of comedy has a long ancestry which dates back at least as far as Much Ado about Nothing created by William Shakespeare, published in 1623.[5] Examples for comedy of manners films include Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961) and Under the Tuscan Sun (2003).\n\nBlack comedy[]\n\nThe black comedy film deals with taboo subjectsTemplate:--including death, murder, crime, suicide, and warTemplate:--in a satirical manner.[6] Examples include Arsenic and Old Lace (1944), Monsieur Verdoux (1947), Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949), The Ladykillers (1955), Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964), The Loved One (1965), MASH (1970), S.O.B. (1981), The King of Comedy (1983), Monty Python's The Meaning of Life (1983), Brazil (1985), After Hours (1985), The War of the Roses (1989), Heathers (1989), Wag the Dog (1997), Your Friends & Neighbors (1998), Dev.D (2009), Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998), Panchathanthiram (2002), Keeping Mum (2005), Thank You for Smoking (2005), Burn After Reading (2008), The Wolf of Wall Street (2013), Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017), The Favourite (2018), Parasite (2019), AK vs AK (2020), Doctor (2021), and The Palace (2022).\n\nFarce[]\n\nFarcical films exaggerate situations beyond the realm of possibilityTemplate:--thereby making them entertaining.[7] Film examples include In the Loop (2009) and Some Like It Hot (1959).\n\nMockumentary[]\n\nMockumentary comedies are fictional, but use a documentary style that includes interviews and \"documentary\" footage along regular scenes. Examples include The Gods Must Be Crazy (1980), This Is Spinal Tap (1984), Waiting for Guffman (1996), Best In Show (2000), and Reboot Camp (2020).\n\nObservational humor[]\n\nThese films find humor in the common practices of everyday life.[8] Some film examples of observational humor include Carnage (2011) and The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood (2002).\n\nParody (or spoof)[]\n\nA parody or spoof film satirizes other film genres or classic films. Such films employ sarcasm, stereotyping, mockery of scenes from other films, and the obviousness of meaning in a character's actions.[9] Examples of this form include Mud and Sand (1922), Blazing Saddles (1974), Airplane! (1980), Young Frankenstein (1974), Spaceballs (1987), and Scary Movie (2000).\n\nSex comedy[]\n\nThe humor in sex comedy is primarily derived from sexual situations and desire,[10] as in Choke (2008) and Knocked Up (2007).\n\nSituational comedy[]\n\nHumor that comes from knowing a stock group of characters (or character types) and then exposing them to different situations to create humorous and ironic juxtaposition;[11] case in point: Galaxy Quest (1999) and Madea's Big Happy Family (2011).\n\nStraight comedy[]\n\nThis broad sub-type applies to films that do not attempt a specific approach to comedy but, rather, used comedy for comedic sake.[12] Clueless (1995) and Mrs. Doubtfire (1993) are examples of straight comedy films.\n\nSlapstick films[]\n\nSlapstick films involve exaggerated, boisterous physical action to create impossible and humorous situations. Because it relies predominately on visual depictions of events, it does not require sound. Accordingly, the subgenre was ideal for silent movies and was prevalent during that era.[13] Popular silent stars of the slapstick genre include Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, Roscoe Arbuckle, and Harold Lloyd. Some of these stars, as well as acts such as Laurel and Hardy and the Three Stooges, also found success incorporating slapstick comedy into sound films. Modern examples of slapstick comedy include Mr. Bean's Holiday (2007) and The Three Stooges (2012).\n\nSurreal comedy[]\n\nAlthough not specifically linked to the history of surrealism, these comedies includes behavior and storytelling techniques that are illogicalTemplate:--including bizarre juxtapositions, absurd situations and unpredictable reactions to normal situations.[12] Some examples are Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975) and Swiss Army Man (2016).\n\nLot-types[]\n\nAnimated comedy[]\n\nAnimated comedy is a work set, used in the combine in animation and comedy.\n\nHistorical comedy-drama[]\n\nHistorical comedy-drama (also period comedy-drama) is a work set in a past time period, usually used in the combine in comedy-drama and Historical drama.\n\nHistorical comedy[]\n\nFor in the Historical comedy\n\nPeriod comedy[]\n\nFor in the Period comedy films\n\nMusical comedy[]\n\nMusical comedy film is a work set, used in the combine in musical and comedy.\n\nJukebox musical comedy[]\n\nSwashbuckler comedy[]\n\nA film is a combine to Swashbuckler and Comedy. In the under on Swashbuckler films.\n\nHybrid subgenres[]\n\nAccording to Williams' taxonomy, all film descriptions should contain their type (comedy or drama) combined with one (or more) subgenres.[14] This combination does not create a separate genre, but rather, provides a better understanding of the film.\n\nAction comedy[]\n\nFilms in this type blend comic antics and action where the stars combine one-liners with a thrilling plot and daring stunts. The genre became a specific draw in North America in the eighties when comedians such as Eddie Murphy started taking more action-oriented roles, such as in 48 Hrs. (1982) and Beverly Hills Cop (1984).\n\nSub-genres of the action comedy (labeled macro-genres by Williams) include:[14]\n\nMartial arts films[]\n\nSlapstick martial arts films became a mainstay of Hong Kong action cinema through the work of Jackie Chan among others, such as Who Am I? (1998). Kung Fu Panda is an action comedy that focuses on the martial art of kung fu.\n\nSuperhero films[]\n\nSome action films focus on superheroes; for example The Incredibles, Hancock, Kick-Ass, and Mystery Men.\n\nOther categories of the action comedy include:[14]\n\nBuddy films[]\n\nSee also: Buddy film\n\nFilms starring mismatched partners for comedic effect, such as in Midnight Run, Rush Hour, 21 Jump Street, Bad Boys, Starsky and Hutch, Booksmart and Ted.\n\nComedy thriller[]\n\nComedy thriller is a type that combines elements of humor and suspense.

Though the genre arguably peaked in the 1930s and 1940s, comedy-mystery films have been continually produced since.[15] Examples include the Pink Panther[16] and Scooby-Doo films.\n\nCrime comedy[]\n\nA hybrid mix of crime and comedy films, examples include Inspector Palmu's Mistake (1960), Oh Brother Where Art Thou? (2000), Take the Money and Run (1969) and Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988).\n\nFantasy comedy[]\n\nFantasy comedy films use magic, supernatural or mythological figures for comic purposes. Some fantasy comedy includes an element of parody, or satire, turning fantasy conventions on their head, such as the hero becoming a cowardly fool or the princess being a klutz. Examples of these films include Big, Being John Malkovich, Ernest Saves Christmas, Ernest Scared Stupid, Night at the Museum, Groundhog Day, Click, and Shrek.\n\nComedy horror[]\n\nComedy horror is a genre/type in which the usual dark themes and \"scare tactics\" attributed to horror films are treated with a humorous approach. These films either use goofy horror cliches, such as in Scream, Young Frankenstein, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Little Shop of Horrors, The Haunted Mansion, and Scary Movie where campy styles are favored. Some are much more subtle and don't parody horror, such as An American Werewolf in London. Another style of comedy horror can also rely on over-the-top violence and gore such as in The Evil Dead (1981), The Return of the Living Dead (1985), Braindead (1992), and Club Dread (2004) – such films are sometimes known as splatstick, a portmanteau of the words splatter and slapstick. It would be reasonable to put Ghostbusters in this category.\n\nDay-in-the-life comedy[]\n\nDay-in-the-life films takes small events in a person's life and raises their level of importance. The \"small things in life\" feel as important to the protagonist (and the audience) as the climactic battle in an action film, or the final shootout in a western.[14] Often, the protagonists deal with multiple, overlapping issues in the course of the film.[14] The day-in-the-life comedy often finds humor in commenting upon the absurdity or irony of daily life; for example The Terminal (2004) or Waitress (2007). Character humor is also used extensively in day-in-the-life comedies, as can be seen in American Splendor (2003).\n\nRomantic comedy[]\n\nRomantic comedies are humorous films with central themes that reinforce societal beliefs about love (e.g., themes such as \"love at first sight\", \"love conquers all\", or \"there is someone out there for everyone\"); the story typically revolves around characters falling into (and out of, and back into) love.[17] Amélie (2001), Annie Hall (1977), Charade (1963), City Lights (1931), Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994), It (1927), The Lobster (2015), My Wife, the Director General (1966), My Favorite Wife (1940), Pretty Woman (1990), Some Like It Hot (1959), There's Something About Mary (1998) and When Harry Met Sally... (1989) are examples of romantic comedies.\n\nScrewball comedy[]\n\nA subgenre of the romantic comedy, screwball comedies appear to focus on the story of a central male character until a strong female character takes center stage; at this point, the man's story becomes secondary to a new issue typically introduced by the woman; this story grows in significance and, as it does, the man's masculinity is challenged by the sharp-witted woman, who is often his love interest.[14] Typically it can include a romantic element, an interplay between people of different economic strata, quick and witty repartee, some form of role reversal, and a happy ending. Some examples of the screwball comedy are: It Happened One Night (1934), Bringing Up Baby (1938), The Philadelphia Story (1940), His Girl Friday (1940), Mr. & Mrs. Smith (1941), and more recently, What's Up, Doc? (1972).\n\nScience fiction comedy[]\n\nScience fiction comedy films often exaggerate the elements of traditional science fiction films to comic effect. Examples include Back to the Future, Spaceballs, Ghostbusters, Evolution, Galaxy Quest, Innerspace, Iron Sky, Mars Attacks!, Men in Black, and The World's End.\n\nSports comedy[]\n\nSports comedy combines the genre of comedy with that of the sports film genre. Thematically, the story is often one of \"Our Team\" versus \"Their Team\"; their team will always try to win, and our team will show the world that they deserve recognition or redemption; the story does not always have to involve a team.[18] The story could also be about an individual athlete or the story could focus on an individual playing on a team. The comedic aspect of this super-genre often comes from physical humor (Happy Gilmore - 1996), character humor (Caddyshack - 1980), or the juxtaposition of bad athletes succeeding against the odds (The Bad News Bears - 1976).\n\nWar comedy[]\n\nWar films typically tells the story of a small group of isolated individuals who – one by one – get killed (literally or metaphorically) by an outside force until there is a final fight to the death; the idea of the protagonists facing death is a central expectation in a war film.[19] War comedies infuse this idea of confronting death with a morbid sense of humor. In a war film even though the enemy may out-number, or out-power, the hero, we assume that the enemy can be defeated if only the hero can figure out how.[20] Often, this strategic sensibility provides humorous opportunities in a war comedy. Examples include Good Morning, Vietnam; M*A*S*H; the Francis the Talking Mule series; and others.\n\nWestern comedy[]"
