        "text": "Squid Game took the world by storm when it was released on Netflix. If you liked that, there are many more foreign TV shows to watch on the streaming platform!\n\nHollywood isn’t the only place making blockbuster movies and hit TV shows anymore. Now, hit TV shows are coming from countries all over the world! From South Korea to Germany, foreign TV shows and movies are dominating streaming. There are many great shows out there that weren’t made in the US besides Squid Game!\n\nForeign TV Shows To Watch On Netflix Outside Of ‘Squid Game‘\n\nIt can be fun to watch shows and content from different countries to see the little things we do differently here. Sometimes, they’re dubbed into English but I often find the dubbing to be too obvious and takes you out of the show. So, I’ll typically watch foreign TV shows with subtitles on in their original language to get the most out of them. However, not every foreign TV show needs to be dubbed or subtitled–they can be in English!\n\nThe United Kingdom is still considered foreign! Broadchurch, for example, is an amazing show out of the UK. It’s a thrilling whodunnit starring some recognizable faces with Olivia Colman and David Tennant. You’ll be guessing the entire series who committed the crime and every episode you’ll be left with a different guess. They executed it very well. If you’re looking for something made in the US, there was a US-remake called Gracepoint that’s essentially the same thing. I think the British version is a bit better but you can make your pick. Either way, it’s intense and emotional. Unfortunately, it’s not on Netflix (you can watch it right now on Peacock) so it’s not going to make the list.\n\nLike Broadchurch, there are great foreign-made TV shows on other streaming services outside of Netflix like Max, Hulu, and Peacock to name a few. Just like these shows can be found on several streaming services, they also come from all over the world. Although, it seems like South Korea has really been on a roll in recent years. They scored a global hit with Squid Game, an a Best Picture Win at The Oscars with Parasite a few years ago! That kicked off some major momentum for them putting out some impressive shows.\n\nThere are too many must-see foreign TV shows on Netflix to name them all and it was no easy task narrowing down only 5 to recommend. That means some great shows got left out including: Kleo, Lupin, and Dark didn’t make the list–but all have good ratings and positive reviews. I’m just not going to recommend a show that I haven’t watched. Ready? Let’s get to the list!\n\n5 Foreign TV Shows To Watch On Netflix Outside Of ‘Squid Game‘"
