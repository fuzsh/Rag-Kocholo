        "text": "Best Picture Genre Biases Major Genre Categories Description and Examples Title Screen Silent\n\nFilms\n\nThe first (and only) silent film to win 'Best Picture' was Wings (1927/28).\n\nThe second, a modern-day mostly-'silent' film (a co-French and US production) with a soundtrack, The Artist (2011, Fr./US), also won Best Picture.\n\nSilents Science-Fiction\n\nFilms\n\nScience-fiction films don't win the Best Picture award, although they have often dominated in the Visual and Special Effects and other technical categories in recent years, and often veer toward dramatic thrillers.\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once (2022) is considered the first bona fide science-fiction film to be awarded Best Picture.\n\nThere have only been a few nominated science-fiction films before 2009 - and none of them have won the top prize:\n\nA Clockwork Orange (1971)\n\nStar Wars (1977)\n\nE.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982)\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey (1968, UK) was not even nominated for Best Picture.\n\nThen, it was unheard of that two science-fiction films were nominated for Best Picture in 2009 (although there were 10 nominees):\n\nDistrict 9 (2009)\n\nAvatar (2009)\n\nSome would also include these pre-2009 films: hybrids of sci-fi films:\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003), an epic fantasy\n\nThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008), a dramatic fantasy\n\nOther sci-fi films nominated since 2009 have included these few, although some purists would not include all of them:\n\nInception (2010)\n\nGravity (2013)\n\nHer (2013)\n\nMad Max: Fury Road (2015)\n\nThe Martian (2015)\n\nArrival (2016)\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once (2022)\n\nSome have claimed that Best Picture-winner The Shape of Water (2017) was a sci-fi film, but it was really a romantic fantasy.\n\nRecently, so-called \"superhero\" films (often massive blockbusters) have rarely been Best Picture nominees (i.e., Black Panther (2018)), and have mostly been relegated to technical and Visual/Special Effects categories, where they have found some success and Oscar wins.\n\nSci-Fi Drama\n\nFilms\n\nThe most frequent Best Picture nominee and winner category has been the category of drama (many have also been social-issue films), with many 'pure' examples noted here:\n\nGrand Hotel (1931/32)\n\nCavalcade (1932/33)\n\nHow Green Was My Valley (1941)\n\nThe Lost Weekend (1945)\n\nThe Best Years of Our Lives (1946) - a wartime drama\n\nGentleman's Agreement (1947)\n\nHamlet (1948) - an historical drama\n\nAll the King's Men (1949)\n\nAll About Eve (1950)\n\nOn the Waterfront (1954)\n\nMarty (1955) - a romantic drama\n\nA Man For All Seasons (1966) - an historical drama\n\nMidnight Cowboy (1969)\n\nOne Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)\n\nKramer vs. Kramer (1979)\n\nOrdinary People (1980)\n\nChariots of Fire (1981, UK) - a sports drama\n\nTerms of Endearment (1983) - (drama/serio-comedy)\n\nRain Man (1988)\n\nDriving Miss Daisy (1989) - (drama/serio-comedy)\n\nForrest Gump (1994) - a romantic drama\n\nAmerican Beauty (1999) - (drama/serio-comedy)\n\nMillion Dollar Baby (2004) - a sports drama\n\nCrash (2005)\n\nArgo (2012)\n\n12 Years A Slave (2013)\n\nSpotlight (2015)\n\nMoonlight (2016)\n\nNomadland (2020)\n\nDramas Comedy\n\nFilms\n\nIt has been rare that light comedy films win the Best Picture Oscar. The following have been the only 'comedies' that have won Best Picture:\n\nIt Happened One Night (1934)\n\nYou Can't Take It With You (1938)\n\nGoing My Way (1944) - a musical comedy\n\nTom Jones (1963, UK) - an historical epic/comedy\n\nThe Sting (1973)\n\nAnnie Hall (1977)\n\nThe Artist (2011, Fr./US)\n\nThere are other borderline or hybrid-comedies (mixed with serious dramatic elements, known as serio-comedy) that have won Best Picture, including:\n\nThe Apartment (1960)\n\nTerms of Endearment (1983)\n\nDriving Miss Daisy (1989)\n\nShakespeare in Love (1998)\n\nAmerican Beauty (1999)\n\nBirdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) (2014) - a romantic comedy-drama\n\nGreen Book (2018) - a hybrid dramedy\n\nComedies Biopics\n\nFilms inspired by real-life individuals (especially when they face adversity) usually do very well in terms of nominations, and often win - especially if they are of epic proportion or are intense character studies.\n\nOften they are combined with other genre categories: there are musical biopics, historical or epic biopics, dramatic biopics, war biopics, etc.\n\nBiopic winners of the Best Picture Academy Award have included:\n\nThe Great Ziegfeld (1936) - a musical biopic\n\nThe Life of Emile Zola (1937) - the first true biopic winner\n\nLawrence of Arabia (1962)\n\nA Man for All Seasons (1966) - an historical-literary biopic\n\nPatton (1970) - a war biopic\n\nChariots of Fire (1981) - a sports-drama biopic\n\nGandhi (1982) - an historical-epic biopic\n\nAmadeus (1984) - a musical biopic\n\nOut of Africa (1985)\n\nThe Last Emperor (1987) - an historical-epic biopic\n\nBraveheart (1995) - an historical-epic biopic\n\nA Beautiful Mind (2001)\n\nThe King's Speech (2010)\n\nGreen Book (2018) - a biographical drama (or dramedy)\n\nBiopics Epics Films / Blockbusters\n\nLong (well over 120 minutes), historical epics with big budgets and grand, large-scale production values have often been chosen as Best Picture, including:\n\nMutiny on the Bounty (1935) - an adventure epic\n\nGone With the Wind (1939)\n\nThe Greatest Show on Earth (1952) - an adventure epic\n\nBen-Hur (1959)\n\nLawrence of Arabia (1962) - a biopic epic\n\nA Man for All Seasons (1966) - a literary epic\n\nThe Godfather (1972) - a crime epic\n\nThe Godfather Part II (1974) - a crime epic\n\nRecent winners among epics have included:\n\nGandhi (1982)\n\nOut of Africa (1985)\n\nThe Last Emperor (1987)\n\nSchindler's List (1993)\n\nForrest Gump (1994)\n\nBraveheart (1995)\n\nThe English Patient (1996)\n\nTitanic (1997)\n\nGladiator (2000)\n\nOppenheimer (2023)\n\nEpics War Films\n\nEpics\n\nWar films, either epics or intimate dramas related to war-time, have done very well in Academy history.\n\nThe Best Picture war-themed winners have included:\n\nWings (1927/28)\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front (1929/30)\n\nMrs. Miniver (1942) - a war drama\n\nCasablanca (1942/43)\n\nThe Best Years of Our Lives (1946) - a war drama\n\nFrom Here to Eternity (1953) - a war drama\n\nThe Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) - a war adventure\n\nPatton (1970) - a war biopic\n\nThe Deer Hunter (1978)\n\nPlatoon (1986)\n\nSchindler's List (1993)\n\nThe Hurt Locker (2009)\n\nWar Film - Biopic\n\nWar Film - Drama Musicals\n\nMusical Best Picture winners are semi-rare and have included only the following ten films (with the total number of Oscars in parentheses):\n\nThe Broadway Melody (1928/29) (1), and the first sound film to win Best Picture\n\nThe Great Ziegfeld (1936) (3)\n\nGoing My Way (1944) (7), a hybrid musical/comedy/drama\n\nAn American in Paris (1951) (6)\n\nGigi (1958) (9)\n\nWest Side Story (1961) (10), noted for having the most Academy Oscar wins of any movie musical\n\nMy Fair Lady (1964) (8)\n\nThe Sound of Music (1965) (5)\n\nOliver! (1968) (5)\n\nChicago (2002) (6), winning after a 34 year gap between musicals that have won Best Picture\n\nThere were five musical Best Picture winners between 1958 and 1968. Four of the ten Best Pictures in the 1960s were musicals (all based on previous Broadway hits).\n\nThe musical to receive the most nominations was La La Land (2016) at 14 nominations - with six wins (but not Best Picture), followed by 13 nominations for Chicago (2002) -- with six wins, including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actress.\n\nMusicals Action-Adventure\n\nFilms\n\nA very small number of pure adventure (or action) films have ever been voted as Best Picture, including:\n\nMutiny on the Bounty (1935) - an historical-adventure\n\nThe Greatest Show on Earth (1952)\n\nAround the World in 80 Days (1956)\n\nDances With Wolves (1990), a western-adventure film\n\nTitanic (1997), a multi-hybrid, an action-adventure epic, as well as a disaster film and historical romance\n\nConversely, lots of action-adventure nominees/losers in the Best Picture category have included:\n\nThe Adventures of Robin Hood (1938)\n\nThe Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948)\n\nAirport (1970)\n\nDeliverance (1972)\n\nThe Towering Inferno (1974)\n\nJaws (1975)\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark (1981)\n\nThe Right Stuff (1983)\n\nThe Mission (1986)\n\nThe Fugitive (1993)\n\nApollo 13 (1995)\n\nMaster and Commander: The Far Side of the World (2003)\n\nMad Max: Fury Road (2015)\n\nThe Revenant (2015)\n\nAdventure Horror/Thriller\n\nFilms\n\nAlthough it has mostly been classified as a thriller and crime-drama, Jonathan Demme's film may take the claim of being the only 'horror' movie to win Best Picture:\n\nThe Silence of the Lambs (1991)\n\nThe first true horror movie to be nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award was:\n\nThe Exorcist (1973)\n\nIt's amazing that a tremendous number of seminal horror-thriller films, including Frankenstein (1931), Bride of Frankenstein (1935), Cat People (1942), Psycho (1960), The Birds (1963), The Haunting (1963), Rosemary's Baby (1968), The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), Carrie (1976), The Omen (1976), Halloween (1978), Alien (1979), The Shining (1980), Poltergeist (1982), A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), The Fly (1986), and Misery (1990) - among others, were NOT nominated for Best Picture. [Note: Some of the above did receive nominations in other Oscar categories, with some winners among them.]\n\nIn terms of the thriller genre category, there were no pure thrillers that were awarded Best Picture.\n\nHitchcock's first US film and Best Picture winner Rebecca (1940) may be counted as the only winning suspense-thriller, although it has also been mostly classified as a romantic-drama plus mystery film.\n\nNo Country For Old Men (2007) was a winning dramatic western crime-thriller.\n\nBen Affleck's Argo (2012) was a suspenseful, historical docu-drama political thriller.\n\nAnd Best Picture-winning Parasite (2019, S. Korea) was a psychological thriller, twisting drama and dark comedy.\n\nBest Picture nominees in the suspense-thriller (and/or horror) genre have included:\n\nSuspicion (1941)\n\nGaslight (1944)\n\nSpellbound (1945)\n\nThe Exorcist (1973)\n\nJaws (1975)\n\nFatal Attraction (1987)\n\nThe Sixth Sense (1999)\n\nBlack Swan (2010) (a possibility)\n\nGet Out (2017)\n\nHorror\n\nSuspense-Thrillers Crime\n\nFilms\n\nThere have been only a few crime films (all hybrids) that have won Best Picture:\n\nIn the Heat of the Night (1967) - a crime/mystery (detective) drama\n\nThe French Connection (1971) - both a crime film and action-thriller\n\nThe Godfather (1972) and The Godfather, Part II (1974) - the two Francis Ford Coppola crime/drama gangster sagas/epics\n\nThe Departed (2006), a violent crime-drama-thriller\n\nNotable Best Picture-nominated crime films (often considered dramas) have included:\n\nThe Racket (1928)\n\nAlibi (1928/29)\n\nI Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang (1932/33)\n\nDead End (1937)\n\nThe Maltese Falcon (1941)\n\nBonnie And Clyde (1967)\n\nChinatown (1974)\n\nDog Day Afternoon (1975)\n\nMidnight Express (1978)\n\nAtlantic City (1981)\n\nPrizzi's Honor (1985)\n\nMississippi Burning (1988)\n\nThe Godfather: Part III (1990)\n\nGoodFellas (1990)\n\nBugsy (1991)\n\nThe Crying Game (1992)\n\nThe Fugitive (1993)\n\nPulp Fiction (1994)\n\nFargo (1996)\n\nL.A. Confidential (1997)\n\nTraffic (2000)\n\nMystic River (2003)\n\nCrime Epics Mystery and\n\nFilm Noir Films\n\nMysteries, and especially the nihilistic subgenre of film noir, do not win Best Picture. Only one murder-mystery film has ever won Best Picture, although it was really a hybrid crime-drama-thriller and civil-rights social issue film:\n\nIn the Heat of the Night (1967)\n\nTwo of Hitchcock's suspenseful Best Picture-nominated, noirish, romantic mystery thrillers were:\n\nSuspicion (1941)\n\nSpellbound (1945)\n\nMany other film noirish mysteries, thrillers and dramas have been nominated for Best Picture, although a number of them are composite hybrids, including:\n\nThe Thin Man (1934) - a crime-mystery comedy\n\nCitizen Kane (1941) - a mystery drama\n\nThe Maltese Falcon (1941) - a film noir detective mystery\n\nDouble Indemnity (1944) - a noirish crime drama\n\nGaslight (1944) - a film-noirish mystery-crime thriller\n\nWitness for the Prosecution (1957) - a courtroom mystery-crime drama\n\nAnatomy of a Murder (1959) - a courtroom mystery-crime drama\n\nZ (1969, Fr./Alg.) - an historical mystery-crime-thriller drama\n\nChinatown (1974) - a neo-noirish detective crime mystery\n\nJFK (1991) - an historical mystery-thriller and drama\n\nL.A. Confidential (1997) - a dramatic mystery-crime-thriller\n\nThe Sixth Sense (1999) - a mystery-thriller and drama\n\nGosford Park (2001) - a dramatic comedy mystery\n\nMystic River (2003) - a dramatic mystery-crime-thriller\n\nMichael Clayton (2007) - a dramatic mystery-crime-thriller\n\nCrime-mysteries and film noirs often tend to do exceedingly well in the artistic performance categories (acting, writing, and directing) despite not earning Best Picture nominations. Seven prime examples have included:\n\nLaura (1944)\n\nThe Third Man (1949)\n\nRear Window (1954)\n\nMurder on the Orient Express (1974)\n\nThe Usual Suspects (1995)\n\nMemento (2000)\n\nThe Constant Gardener (2005)\n\nMystery Western\n\nFilms\n\nOnly four Westerns have won the highest honor:\n\nCimarron (1930/31)\n\nDances With Wolves (1990)\n\nUnforgiven (1992)\n\nNo Country For Old Men (2007) - a dramatic western crime-thriller\n\nThere have only been nineteen other nominated Westerns (in addition to the winners) for Best Picture, although many were hybrids.

Often, they are nominated (or win) for various music-related categories..\n\nThey are rarely taken seriously, and therefore not often nominated for Best Picture, with the following exceptions:\n\nSkippy (1930/31)\n\nThe Wizard of Oz (1939)\n\nThe Yearling (1946)\n\nMiracle on 34th Street (1947)\n\nMary Poppins (1964)\n\nDoctor Dolittle (1967)\n\nE.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982)\n\nBabe (1995)\n\nChildren's Sports\n\nFilms\n\nOnly a small number of sports/drama films have even received a nomination for Best Picture, let alone a Best Picture Oscar.\n\nOnly three sports films (all dramas as well) have won Best Picture in Oscar history:\n\nRocky (1976)\n\nChariots of Fire (1981, UK)\n\nMillion Dollar Baby (2004)\n\nOthers that have received Best Picture nominations have included:\n\nThe Champ (1931/32)\n\nThe Pride of the Yankees (1942)\n\nThe Hustler (1961)\n\nHeaven Can Wait (1978)\n\nBreaking Away (1979)\n\nRaging Bull (1980)\n\nField of Dreams (1989)\n\nJerry Maguire (1996)\n\nSeabiscuit (2003)\n\nThe Fighter (2010)\n\nMoneyball (2011)\n\nSports Romance\n\nFilms\n\nPure love stories (not including musicals) which often have strong romantic subplots are popular Best Picture winners and nominees during escapist periods in American history, such as the Depression Era and World War II, the 50's, and at the turn of the modern century. There are many examples of both romances and romantic comedies that have been nominated for Best Picture.\n\nRomance films (often hybrids with dramas or other categories) that have won Best Picture have included:\n\nGone With the Wind (1939)\n\nRebecca (1940) - a Gothic romance\n\nMrs. Miniver (1942)\n\nCasablanca (1942/43)\n\nMarty (1955) - a romantic drama\n\nOut of Africa (1985)\n\nForrest Gump (1994) - a romantic drama\n\nThe English Patient (1996)\n\nTitanic (1997)\n\nShakespeare in Love (1998)\n\nSlumdog Millionaire (2008)\n\nLight romantic comedies that have won Best Picture have included:\n\nIt Happened One Night (1934)\n\nAnnie Hall (1977)\n\nRomances Chick Flicks\n\n\"Chick Flicks\" (or 'womens' pictures') have been around since the earliest days of cinema. The term generally refers to a sub-category of films that generally fall in the genres of Drama, Melodrama, or Romance (see above), although they can appear in many other genre categories as well.\n\nMany so-called 'womens' pictures' have won the Best Picture Academy Award, including these examples:\n\nGrand Hotel (1932)\n\nIt Happened One Night (1934)\n\nGone With the Wind (1939)\n\nRebecca (1940)\n\nHow Green Was My Valley (1941)\n\nMrs. Miniver (1942)\n\nCasablanca (1942/43)\n\nAll About Eve (1950)\n\nGigi (1958)\n\nWest Side Story (1961)\n\nMy Fair Lady (1964)\n\nThe Sound of Music (1965)\n\nAnnie Hall (1977)\n\nKramer vs. Kramer (1979)\n\nOrdinary People (1980)\n\nTerms of Endearment (1983)\n\nOut of Africa (1985)\n\nDriving Miss Daisy (1989)\n\nThe English Patient (1996)\n\nShakespeare in Love (1998)\n\nChicago (2002)\n\nChick Flicks\n\nR-rated\n\nFilms\n\nThe first R-rated film to win Best Picture was The French Connection (1971) since the institution of the MPAA ratings system.\n\nThere were six consecutive R-rated Best Picture winners beginning in 2005:\n\nCrash (2005)\n\nThe Departed (2006)\n\nNo Country for Old Men (2007)\n\nSlumdog Millionaire (2008)\n\nThe Hurt Locker (2009)\n\nThe King's Speech (2010)\n\nAnother recent streak of six consecutive R-rated Best Picture winners include:\n\nArgo (2012)\n\n12 Years A Slave (2013)\n\nBirdman (2014)\n\nSpotlight (2015)\n\nMoonlight (2016)\n\nThe Shape of Water (2017) - (for sexual content, graphic nudity, violence and language)\n\nOther recent R-rated Best Picture winners were:\n\nParasite (2019)\n\nNomadland (2020)\n\nX-rated\n\nFilms\n\nThe only X-rated film (later reduced to R in the following decade) to win Best Picture was:\n\nMidnight Cowboy (1969).\n\nA Clockwork Orange (1971) was the only other X-rated film (since re-rated) nominated for Best Picture.\n\nActor Marlon Brando and director Bernard Bertolucci were also Oscar nominees for an X-rated film (not re-rated since its release), but it did not have a Best Picture nomination:\n\nLast Tango in Paris (1972)\n\nBritish (UK)\n\nFilms\n\nFilms with a British perspective, or with British/US production cooperation have done fairly well in the Best Picture category.\n\nFollowing is a list of the Best Picture-winning UK films (often co-produced with the US):\n\nHamlet (1948)\n\nThe Bridge on the River Kwai (1957)\n\nLawrence of Arabia (1962)\n\nTom Jones (1963)\n\nOliver! (1968)\n\nChariots of Fire (1981)\n\nGandhi (1982)\n\nThe Last Emperor (1987)\n\nShakespeare in Love (1998)\n\nSlumdog Millionaire (2008)\n\nThe King's Speech (2010)\n\nHamlet (1948) was both the first British production and the first non-American or non-Hollywood (foreign-made) film to be presented with the industry's top honor."
