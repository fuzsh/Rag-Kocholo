        "text": "John Lithgow\n\nAmerican actor\n\nJohn Lithgow (born October 19, 1945, Rochester, New York, U.S.) is an American stage and screen character actor known for his extreme versatility, earning acclaim in roles ranging from mild-mannered everymen to cold-blooded killers.\n\nEarly life\n\nLithgow was born into a theatrical family; his mother was an actress, and his father was a theatre producer. When he was a child, Lithgow’s family moved to Ohio, where his father produced local Shakespeare festivals. It was at one such festival that Lithgow made his childhood acting debut, and he subsequently appeared in many of his father’s productions. Despite his early experience with theatre, Lithgow focused his attention on painting and later enrolled at Harvard University to study graphic arts. While at Harvard he participated extensively in student theatre—acting, directing, and stage designing—and eventually decided to pursue acting as a career. After graduating in 1967, Lithgow spent two academic years at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art on a Fulbright scholarship.\n\nStage career\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nClassic Children’s Books Quiz\n\nAfter returning to the United States, Lithgow began directing and performing in plays in Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, and in 1972 he appeared in his first film, the drug-themed comedy Dealing; or, The Berkeley-to-Boston Forty-Brick Lost-Bag Blues. The following year he made his Broadway debut in The Changing Room, playing a dim British rugby player. For his performance, Lithgow received a Tony Award for best supporting dramatic actor. The honour proved to be a catalyst to his career, and Lithgow continued to appear on Broadway regularly for nearly a decade. Among his memorable performances were those in Bedroom Farce (1979), written by Alan Ayckbourn, and Beyond Therapy (1982). In 1985 he was nominated for another Tony, for his carefully crafted portrayal of a washed-up boxer in Requiem for a Heavyweight.\n\nThe World According to Garp, Terms of Endearment, and Footloose\n\nAlongside his stage appearances, Lithgow continued to pursue big-screen roles. He was especially notable as a Broadway director and choreographer in Bob Fosse’s autobiographical All That Jazz (1979) and as a sadistic assassin in Blow Out (1981). Lithgow’s breakthrough, however, was his turn as a transsexual former football star in The World According to Garp (1982), for which he earned an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actor. The following year he garnered further acclaim—and, later, a second Oscar nomination—for his role as a bashful banker who has an affair with a married woman in Terms of Endearment. He also gave a memorable performance as an airline passenger who seems to be hallucinating a monster in the “Nightmare at 20,000 Feet” segment of Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983). Lithgow continued to prove his ever-expanding acting range on the big screen with adept personifications of a swaggering supervillain in The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension! (1984), a puritanical preacher in Footloose (1984), and a British criminal mastermind in Cliffhanger (1993), among others.\n\n3rd Rock from the Sun and return to the stage\n\nDuring this time Lithgow appeared on television sporadically, and in 1986 he won an Emmy Award for a guest appearance on Amazing Stories. It was not until the mid-1990s, however, that he was finally convinced to take a starring role in a TV series—as Dick Solomon, an alien masquerading as a college professor, in 3rd Rock from the Sun (1996–2001). The show, which followed the exploits of a “family” of extraterrestrials learning about human behaviour, was relatively well received, running for six seasons. For his performance as Solomon, Lithgow was nominated for six Emmys, of which he won three (1996, 1997, and 1999). In 2009 he guest-starred on the popular television crime drama Dexter, and his chilling portrayal of serial killer Arthur Mitchell earned him another Emmy. He reprised the role for the miniseries Dexter: New Blood (2021).\n\nAfter 3rd Rock ended, Lithgow returned his focus to the stage. In 2002 he won his second Tony Award, for his role as a manipulative gossip columnist in the musical Sweet Smell of Success (based on the film of the same name), and in 2008 he debuted an autobiographical solo stage show, John Lithgow: Stories by Heart, which transferred to Broadway in 2018. He also starred as Joseph Alsop in David Auburn’s play The Columnist (2012). Lithgow later trod the boards in a revival of the farcical The Magistrate (2012–13) at the Royal National Theatre in London and in a staging (2014–15) of Edward Albee’s A Delicate Balance on Broadway. In Hillary and Clinton, which premiered on Broadway in 2019, he portrayed Bill Clinton.\n\nOther credits, including The Crown\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

In Love Is Strange (2014) he portrayed a painter whose life is upended when his husband is fired from the Catholic school where he teaches following the revelation of their marriage. He took supporting roles as the father-in-law of a spaceship pilot (played by Matthew McConaughey) in director Christopher Nolan’s atmospheric drama Interstellar (2014) and as a preacher in Tommy Lee Jones’s bleak western The Homesman (2014).\n\nIn 2017 Lithgow appeared as an overly enthusiastic grandfather in the comedy Daddy’s Home 2 and as a boorish real-estate mogul in the comedy Beatriz at Dinner. His other notable credits from this period included the Netflix TV series The Crown, in which he portrayed Winston Churchill. For his performance, Lithgow won his sixth Emmy Award. Among his films from 2019 were Pet Sematary, an adaptation of the Stephen King novel, and Bombshell, in which he played media executive Roger Ailes, who resigned from the Fox News Channel amid allegations of sexual misconduct. Lithgow also had roles in The Tomorrow Man and Late Night (both 2019). He later appeared in the TV series Perry Mason (2020– ) and The Old Man (2022– ).\n\nIn addition to his extensive stage and screen work, Lithgow authored several books for children, including Marsupial Sue (2001) and I Got Two Dogs (2008), and released several albums of music for children. A vocal critic of Pres. Donald Trump, he also wrote the satirical poetry collections Dumpty: The Age of Trump in Verse (2019), Trumpty Dumpty Wanted a Crown: Verses of a Despotic Age (2020), and A Confederacy of Dumptys: Portraits of American Scoundrels in Verse (2021). In 2011 Lithgow published a memoir, Drama: An Actor’s Education.\n\nAlison Eldridge The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica"
