        "text": "(Photo by Lionsgate courtesy Everett Collection)\n\nAll Jason Statham Movies, Ranked By Tomatometer\n\nOnce, during a long-ago era called The ’80s, Hollywood action heroes roamed the Earth with bulging biceps and names like Sly, Arnold, and Bruce. With a limitless supply of weapons and wisecracks, they saved the world countless times, only to be exiled to the land of Direct-to-Video for their trouble, where they wandered lost throughout the ’90s and much of the aughts. But they’re fighting their way back from extinction, thanks in large part to the tenacious efforts of steely-eyed roughnecks like Jason Statham, the veteran of latter-day genre classics like Crank, The Bank Job, and recent Fast and Furious sequels and spinoffs, who rose to stardom on the strength of his appearances in Guy Ritchie‘s Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch. To celebrate his bravery in the face of indie dramas and romantic comedies, we’ve rounded up all of his major roles to offer a comprehensive look back at all Jason Statham movies, sorted by Tomatometer.\n\n#1\n\nSpy (2015) 95%\n\n#1\n\nAdjusted Score: 107638%\n\nCritics Consensus: Simultaneously broad and progressive, Spy offers further proof that Melissa McCarthy and writer-director Paul Feig bring out the best in one another -- and delivers scores of belly laughs along the way.\n\nSynopsis: Despite having solid field training, CIA analyst Susan Cooper (Melissa McCarthy) has spent her entire career as a desk jockey,...

[More]\n\nDirected By: James Wan\n\n#3\n\nThe Bank Job (2008) 80%\n\n#3\n\nAdjusted Score: 85620%\n\nCritics Consensus: Well cast and crisply directed, The Bank Job is a thoroughly entertaining British heist thriller.\n\nSynopsis: Self-reformed petty criminal Terry Leather (Jason Statham) has become a financially struggling car dealer and settled into a pedestrian London... [More]\n\nDirected By: Roger Donaldson\n\n#4\n\n#4\n\nAdjusted Score: 78687%\n\nCritics Consensus: Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels is a grimy, twisted, and funny twist on the Tarantino hip gangster formula.\n\nSynopsis: Eddy (Nick Moran) convinces three friends to pool funds for a high-stakes poker game against local crime boss Hatchet Harry... [More]\n\nDirected By: Guy Ritchie\n\n#5\n\nSnatch (2000) 74%\n\n#5\n\nAdjusted Score: 79577%\n\nCritics Consensus: Though perhaps a case of style over substance, Guy Ritchie's second crime caper is full of snappy dialogue, dark comedy, and interesting characters.\n\nSynopsis: Illegal boxing promoter Turkish (Jason Statham) convinces gangster Brick Top (Alan Ford) to offer bets on bare-knuckle boxer Mickey (Brad...
