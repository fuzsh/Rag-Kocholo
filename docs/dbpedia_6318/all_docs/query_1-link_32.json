        "text": "It holds a rare 100 per cent positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and was voted the 13th greatest British film of all time in a BFI poll of leading industry figures.\n\nAlmost 70 years since its release and the Oscar-nominated, BAFTA-winning black comedy The Ladykillers still lives up to its reputation.\n\nStarring the likes of Sir Alec Guinness, Cecil Parker, Herbert Lom and Peter Sellers, the Ealing Studios crime film saw a lonely widow rent out rooms to a gang of criminals.\n\nHowever, it’s not long before the old woman realised they had stolen money in a heist.\n\nAs a result, the crooks reluctantly plan to kill her only for everything to go badly wrong for them.\n\nThe Ladykillers was remade by the Coen Brothers 20 years ago starring Tom Hanks, but never managed to reach the genius heights of the original written by William Rose.\n\nThe 1955 The Ladykillers is available to stream on two platforms, Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV+. On both services, the classic film is available to in 4K to rent for £3.49 or buy for £6.99."
