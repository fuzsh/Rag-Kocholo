        "text": "I love a good Criminal Minds episode as much as the next person, but as anyone who has watched true-crime TV shows knows, there’s just something special about British crime dramas—specifically British detective series. Maybe it’s the accents or the famously gloomy England weather. Regardless, one thing’s for certain: the Brits know how to make a good mystery.\n\nIt’s not all that surprising that British detective series are so good. We are talking about the culture that birthed the most iconic detective in pop culture history, Sherlock Holmes, after all. But, in case you still have your doubts, the best British detective series on Netflix should set the record straight. Full disclosure before you start your binge-watch: Not all of these shows are strictly detective shows. Some are spy thrillers, others twisted mysteries. We've even thrown in some true crime documentaries for good measure. But they are all British crime shows, and they all share a certain je ne sais quoi. Whether you prefer soapy thrillers, detective series, or murder mysteries, you’ll find what you’re looking for below.\n\n1. Killing Eve\n\nSandra Oh and Jodie Comer play a chilling game of cat and mouse in Killing Eve, a BBC series created by Phoebe Waller-Bridge about a serial killer (Comer) and the detective desperate to catch her (Oh). The show was huge all over the world for a reason: its addictive twists and turns will have you glued to the screen for hours on end.\n\nStream It\n\n2. Treason\n\nLoyalties are tested in this British spy drama about an MI6 agent, Adam Lawrence (Charlie Cox), whose past relationship with a Russian spy (Olga Kurylenko) puts him in a complicated situation both at work and at home.\n\nStream It\n\n3. Fool Me Once\n\nIn this soapy mystery-meets detective show, a recently widowed woman, Maya (Michelle Keegan), gets the shock of her life after seeing her supposedly murdered husband, Joe (Richard Armitage), on a nanny camera in their daughter’s room. Suspicious of her husband’s death, she begins an investigation, which puts her in the crosshairs of detectives looking into Joe’s murder.\n\nStream It\n\n4. Bodies\n\nThis new British crime drama on Netflix is twisty AF and gaining new fans by the minute. It's about London detectives in multiple time periods who all discover and investigate the death of the same man. How is that even possible? Guess you gotta watch to find out.\n\nStream It\n\n5. Dracula\n\nMurder on a show called Dracula? I'm gonna take a wild guess and say the vampire did it. The series was developed by Mark Gatiss and Stephen Moffat, who you might recognize as the co-creators of a little show called Sherlock. This show is less of a detective series and more of a supernatural crime thriller, but fans of the whodunit should be satisfied.\n\nStream It\n\n6. Who is Erin Carter?\n\nHave you ever wondered if one of your ordinary teachers had a secret life? Well, according to Who is Erin Carter?, you really never know. The show is about a British teacher who moves to Spain and causes chaos when she goes all Jason Bourne during a robbery, causing a flurry of unwanted attention and a renewed spotlight on a past she'd rather stay hidden.\n\nStream It\n\n7. Requiem\n\nThis six-part series has it all: crime, supernatural thrills, and that top-notch BBC production quality. The story goes like this: when the mother of an accomplished cellist dies by suicide, her daughter finds an unusual link between the death and the disappearance of a young girl more than 20 years ago.\n\nStream It\n\n8. The End of the F***ing World\n\nThis one goes out to all the dark comedy lovers out there. In this show, 17-year-olds Alyssa and James set out to find Alyssa's estranged father. James (a self-diagnosed psychopath) has already killed animals and thinks he needs to move onto something bigger...and he's got something (er, someone) in mind... I think you can see where this is going.\n\nStream It\n\n9. Get Even\n\nA group of girls at an elite private school form a club with the purpose of getting back at their bullies, and they call it DGM (short for Don't Get Mad). But when one of their targets is murdered and found holding a note that says DGM, they realize someone's REALLY got it out for them, to the point of trying to frame them for murder.\n\nStream It\n\n10. Kiss Me First\n\nThe show jumps between the real world and an animated VR world, so it never gets boring. It follows the story of Leila, who comes across a secret paradise hidden in one of her favorite games. But as these things seem to go, Leila realizes it may not be so perfect when her friend from the game goes missing. Dun dun dunnnnnn.\n\nStream It\n\n11. Bodyguard\n\nThis much-loved sexy thriller features Richard Madden as protection officer David Budd, a war veteran who is assigned to a security detail for a conservative parliament member (Keeley Hawes). Prepare for a lot of twists, jaw-dropping action, and Madden saying, \"Mum\" (that's \"Ma'am\" with an accent).\n\nStream It\n\n12. Stay Close\n\nA picture-perfect soccer mom (Cush Jumbo) has a bunch of dark secrets, and they all come out when a man goes missing, prompting a detective from her past to go looking for answers. Based on the book by Harlan Coben, Stay Close is a twisty detective series that'll have you on the edge of your seat.\n\nStream It\n\n13. The Stranger\n\nAnother British crime drama based on a Harlan Coben novel, The Stranger begins when a total stranger (Hannah John-Kamen) confronts Adam Price (Richard Armitage) and reveals a secret about his wife, sending him spiraling down a rabbit hole as he tries to uncover the truth.\n\nStream It\n\n14. The One\n\nIf you love your British crime with a side of sci-fi (or even if you don’t), this show is a must-watch. When a DNA researcher believes she’s found a way to genetically match you with your perfect partner, she sets up a matchmaking service to help pair people off with their soul mates. Everything seems super exciting and great, until someone turns up dead.\n\nStream It\n\n15. The Irregulars\n\nAny fans of Sherlock Holmes (aka the British detective) will love this show since it's a totally new take on the classic Sherlock tales. It's about a ragtag group of teens in Victorian England who come together to help a sinister Dr. Watson and his mysterious partner, Sherlock Holmes, solve supernatural crimes.\n\nStream It\n\n16. Top Boy\n\nOut in London’s East End, the drug trade isn’t exactly hidden. And Ra’Nell, whose mother was just admitted to a mental hospital and whose father died after Ra’Nell killed him, is figuring out how to navigate it all.\n\nStream It\n\n17. Criminal\n\nCriminal is a Netflix original detective series that hyper-focuses on police interrogations, with seasons set in a different country: France, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The seasons are short—just three episodes long—but give you the chance to experience the investigation from three different perspectives: inside the police interrogation room, what happens behind the one-way mirror and, finally, the area outside the two rooms. Fair warning: This one will utterly mind-f*ck you.\n\nStream It\n\n18. Safe\n\nA heartbreaking drama-slash-thriller about a dad whose daughter disappears in what is supposed to be a gated, secure neighborhood. As he desperately searches for her, he begins to realize that what he thought was safe is far from it. Be warned: this is the kind of show that’ll make you question whether your roommate is actually your friend or some unhinged person trying to get close to you so they can kill your entire family.\n\nStream It\n\n19. Peaky Blinders\n\nI know what you're thinking, so I'll just come right out and say yes, this show 100 percent lives up to all the hype (and falls under \"crime,\" even if said crime is old-timey). If you haven't heard of Peaky Blinders—either the show or the viral haircut trend—then please leave your bunker and start watching it ASAP.\n\nStream It\n\n20. White Lines\n\nOkay, so this show is both completely wild and completely thrilling. An English woman heads down to Ibiza to investigate the mysterious disappearance of her brother. White Lines is for anyone who likes murder mixed with sex, drugs, and partying—or for anyone who just wants to escape real life for a while.\n\nStream It\n\n21. Giri/Haji\n\nGiri/Haji follows a Tokyo policeman who travels to London to find a wanted murderer who also happens to be his brother. The Japanese-English series is a cross-cultural story that combines cops and family drama in a seriously thrilling show.\n\nStream It\n\n22. Marcella\n\nIf you plow through this list in order and loved The Fall, you’ll have no problem getting addicted to Marcella Backland and company. It’s another cat-and-mouse formula only with more baggage and blackouts that make it hard to separate reality from what’s going on inside Marcella’s head.\n\nStream It\n\n23. Paranoid\n\nFans of Ellaria Sand in Game of Thrones can breathe a sigh of relief: There is life beyond Dorne, and that life exists in the fictional town of Woodmere. Actress Indira Varma plays Detective Sergeant Nina Suresh, who is tasked with solving the murder of a physician found stabbed in a playground.\n\nStream It\n\n24. Collateral\n\nClear your schedule (who even has better plans anyway?) and binge Collateral: a four-part series centering on the murder of a pizza delivery driver in London. Mulligan is Kip Glaspie, an Olympic pole vaulter-turned-detective (yep, you read that right) who is desperate to get to the truth.\n\nStream It\n\n25. Inside Man\n\nAlthough only four episodes, Inside Man will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Not only do you get to absolutely fan girl over Stanley Tucci, but it lets you see how life can easily be turned upside down with just one interaction. See how a prisoner on death row and a woman trapped in a cellar under an English vicarage cross paths in the most unexpected of ways.\n\nStream It\n\n26. Anatomy of a Scandal\n\nThis British miniseries is less detective series and more courtroom drama about the wife of a British Member of Parliament (Sienna Miller) whose husband is arrested and tried for sexual assault. But was it a crime or an affair? It's a case of he said, she said, the press said. Plus, Michelle Dockery, who you might recognize as Lady Mary from Downton Abbey, plays the prosecutor, so the cast is A+.\n\nStream It\n\n27. Behind Her Eyes\n\nIf you prefer your British crime shows with a psychological thriller and supernatural elements thrown in, then Behind Her Eyes is probably right up your alley.
