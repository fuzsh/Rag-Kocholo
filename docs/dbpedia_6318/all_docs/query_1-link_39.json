        "text": "Many years ago now, Neil Marshall made the best British horror film of this century – in fact, arguably the best British genre piece of any description. That was The Descent (2005), a breath-catchingly claustrophobic caving nightmare that could hardly have been better crafted.\n\nThen began the downward slide. Marshall reaches rock bottom in Duchess, a punishing, braindead slice of gangland brutality that suggests what might be spawned if Guy Ritchie and Nick Love (The Firm, The Business) ever got in bed together. No one wants to see that, and no one, believe me, will want to see Duchess.\n\nThis is the third Marshall film running that stars his wife Charlotte Kirk, following The Reckoning (2020) and The Lair (2022). A significant chunk of UK arts funding should probably be diverted to subsidising their break-up. It’s a grisly contract, creatively speaking: Kirk makes Marshall look like a horrible director, and he fulfils his part of the equation by making her look useless at acting.\n\nKirk plays, heaven help us, Scarlett, a small-time London pickpocket who manages to embroil herself in the dog-eat-dog world of diamond smuggling. Dubbed “Duchess” by impressed confederates when she gets the hang of guns, she falls in with a partner called Robert (Philip Winchester) after discovering he has a cool head, and is great in the sack.\n\nAlmost everything these two say to one other is so wince-worthy you want to crawl under your seat, scuttle along the whole row if possible, and make for the nearest fire exit.\n\nWhen they’re targeted by a rival syndicate in Tenerife, headed by a tragically wooden Colin Egglesfield, the script decides the way forward is torture scenes, and lots of them. An iron is used to cook someone’s trouser equipment. Stephanie Beacham, of all people, is a sadistic bigwig who gives some other goon a “Colombian necktie” (look it up, or perhaps don’t) while acidly swearing.\n\nThe sub-sub-Scarface bursts of bullet-ridden action just about keep this thing from grinding to a halt, but it’s leering, cruddy and retrograde to the bitter end. Even Sean Pertwee, a Marshall regular who can usually be relied upon to inject a certain weary gravitas, seems 100 per cent stumped by his dim role as a middle-management crook.\n\nWe have MeToo to thank for this utterly cynical angle of “feminist” payback, as an excuse to resurrect the sleazy British gangster movie from its death throes. They weren’t supposed to be making the likes of Duchess any more. We may have prematurely celebrated.\n\n15 cert, 114 min; in cinemas August 9"
