        "text": "Scholars and comics throw around theories for the origins of the sandpaper-dry, yet subtle, sarcasm that defines British humor (or rather, humour.)\n\nDanish Ambassador to the U.K., Claus Grube, credits the Vikings with transporting dark humor as salvation to the British. The Vikings, remembered fondly as brutal and ruthless warriors, developed caustic comedy and shipped it here to England. He cites civilizations with bleak outlooks as the inventors of dry sarcasm.\n\nBritish humor is often exemplified by self-deprecation, and a reach for irony and sarcasm peppered throughout everyday speech. Many Americans feel the need to follow up a sarcastic insult with a safety notice, like “just kidding!” Brits balance their servings of dishing out with an equally hearty dose of self-insult. Self-deprecation earns a person tokens to use the same dry offenses on others.\n\nWriting and creation in the United States usually requires characters to be likeable, while Brits can find humor in a terrible person. The Americanized version of David Brent, Michael Scott, is essentially David Brent with charming naiveté and rose-tinted glasses. American audiences clearly needed to be able to like a character underneath the shenanigans.\n\nBritish humor also more quickly tackles taboo topics. Curse words and what the Americans would call the “C” word are simply not enough for shock value. Brits tackle humor straight on and are less afraid to tackle the guilt of privilege or the frustration of class hierarchies. While Americans sell the myth that anybody with enough willpower can climb to the top of society. Brits cope with their own class issues through dark humor, unafraid to show realistic working class sets and financial problems.\n\nBritish humor frankly makes me feel less unique, but also less crazy. I often find myself with British tendencies, and then fear that my joke will not be well received, and usually feel the need to disclaim that I am joking around new people. I absolutely adore deadpan humor, and utilize it on many a stage (uninvited wedding toast.) Dry toast Brits have inspired me to embrace deadpan sarcasm and let other people not understand. I also embrace my writing aesthetic to not necessarily strive for likability, but for authenticity. Authenticity can be charm within itself, and the Brits lack of need for rosy endings is refreshing. The idea makes me more hopeful about my potentially not-so-rosy future, in that I may at least laugh through the end.\n\nSources and More Information\n\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/10677904/Vikings-brought-sarcastic-sense-of-humour-to-Britain.html\n\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-4325872/British-comedy-lewd-puerile-lavatorial-lacking-flair.html"
