        "text": "50. Joseph ''Blue'' Pulaski, Old School (2003)\n\nSidekick to: The guys of Lambda Epsilon Omega\n\nCharacter actor Pat Cranshaw finally found a breakout role in 2003 as Old School's 89-year-old fratboy Joseph ''Blue'' Pulaski. His rheumy eyes and grizzled presence make him an ace foil for his lugnut ''brothers,'' even as he embodies the fake fraternity's schlumpy loser ethos. Sadly, Blue passes away halfway through the movie (while wrestling in a kiddie pool full of K-Y Jelly, no less) — but not before stealing every scene he's in. We feel Frank the Tank's pain when he wails to an uncaring God: ''You're my boy, Blue!'' —Michael Endelman\n\n49. Randy Hickey, My Name Is Earl (2005–09)\n\nSidekick to: Earl J. Hickey\n\nMy Name Is Earl's title character has made a lot of mistakes, but keeping his brother by his side isn't one of them. With childlike innocence and almost touching simplicity, Randy (Ethan Suplee) follows Earl (Jason Lee) on his quest for karmic redemption like a loyal bulldog. He'll even give Earl a swirly if it means his brother can cross something off his list. And who can blame Randy if he's sometimes sidelined by a paralyzing fear of chickens? They do seem like nasty birds. —Tim Stack\n\n48. Fred ''Rerun'' Stubbs, What's Happening!! (1976–79)\n\nSidekick to: Roger ''Raj'' Thomas\n\nHe wasn't What's Happening!!'s funniest character. That would have to be Dee, who spoke in that devastatingly hilarious monotone. Shirley the waitress and dim-bulb Dwayne (''Nuh-huh'') were both funnier too. But Rerun (Fred Berry) played the essential role of the clown — the one usually on the receiving end of a withering putdown — with a hearty grace and a rubbery physicality (he was the show's best dancer). Besides, how can you not trust a friend who has the courage to wear a fire engine red beret? —Wook Kim\n\n47. Sallah, Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023)\n\nSidekick to: Indiana Jones\n\n''Asps. Very dangerous.'' Peering down into a darkened ancient chamber known as the Well of Souls, Sallah turns to a famously snake-phobic archeologist and gravely intones, ''You go first.'' Ask anybody who's seen Raiders of the Lost Ark and they'll tell you that these are not the words of a coward, but, rather, of a faithful (and perfectly honest) companion. That said, this Egyptian digger hardly needs to prove himself, having already saved Indy from death (''Bad dates'') and despair (''They're digging in the wrong place!''). Steven Spielberg cast John Rhys-Davies in the big, burly role specifically for his Falstaff-like features — Sallah has no problem keeping up with this Jones. —Wook Kim\n\n46. Bender, Futurama (1999–2003, 2008–13, 2023–present)\n\nSidekick to: Fry\n\nSure, a selfish, larcenous, beer-swilling robot whose catchphrase is ''Bite my shiny metal ass'' might not seem the optimal friend in need. But for Futurama's über-slacker Fry, trapped 1,000 years in the future, Bender provided a timelessly valuable service: indulging all of Fry's dangerously ill-thought-out impulses. But Bender wasn't entirely without an empathy chip. As he touchingly said of his buddy, ''Fry, of all the friends I've had...you're the first.'' —Josh Wolk\n\n45. Igor, Young Frankenstein (1974)\n\nSidekick to: Dr. Frankenstein\n\nIt's difficult to imagine how Dr. F. got by before he met Igor (who made his film debut in 1939's Son of Frankenstein). Who else fuels his boss' God complex? Who else digs up the fresh corpses? Most importantly, who else flips the giant switch? Marty Feldman's bug-eyed hunchback-in-denial brought new life to the mischievous character in Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein. His loyalty and quick one-liners were nothing short of \"abby-normal\"...in a good way. —Jeff Labrecque\n\n44. Duckie, Pretty in Pink (1986)\n\nSidekick to: Andie\n\nHe pesters, he jesters, he lip-syncs to Otis Redding's ''Try a Little Tenderness'' — all in the name of unrequited devotion to social outcast Andie. Never mind that the whiny-but-lovable New Waver receives one of cinema's cruelest heave-hos. Something tells us that when slick Blane eventually dumps Andie (oh, you know it'll happen), Duckie (Jon Cryer) will be right there with an Aqua Net-flecked shoulder to cry on. —Nicholas Fonseca\n\n43. Jimmy Olsen, Superman franchise (1938–present)\n\nSidekick to: Clark Kent/Superman\n\nOn the big screen, Daily Planet photographer and cub reporter Jimmy Olsen is relegated to playing Clark's (and Superman's) gee-whiz cheerleader. From 1954 to 1974, though, Olsen not only merited his own spinoff comic, he often took on temporary superpowers (Elastic Lad! Giant Turtle Boy!) so he could fight alongside the Man of Steel. And then there was the time Superman, as a witch doctor, married Jimmy to ''the female King Kong.'' Is that a sidekick sacrifice or what? —Adam B. Vary\n\n42. Jeff Green, Curb Your Enthusiasm (2000–24)\n\nSidekick to: Larry David\n\nWould Curb Your Enthusiasm's Larry be able to make a complete mess of any awkward situation without his manager/best buddy? Whether helping his nebbishy client swipe a doll's head from his own daughter or pilfering a 5-wood from a casket, Jeff (Jeff Garlin) doesn't just indulge Larry's delusions and scams — he enables the latter's entire misanthropic worldview. That is, when he's not allowing Larry's wife Cheryl to ''pop in'' on his fantasies. —Charles Curtis\n\n41. Piglet, Winnie-the-Pooh franchise (1926–present)\n\nSidekick to: Winnie-the-Pooh\n\nPiglet is timid, skittish, and self-conscious; Pooh is oblivious, adventurous, and rumbly-in-my-tumbly goofy. They were practically made for each other. As the final piece of Pooh's inner trinity (along with Christopher Robin), little Piglet is not afraid to pooh-pooh Winnie for being a \"silly old bear.\" Still, at the end of the day it's Pooh that Piglet looks to for support:\n\n''Pooh!'' he whispered.\n\n''Yes, Piglet?''\n\n''Nothing,'' said Piglet, taking Pooh's paw. ''I just wanted to be sure of you.'' —Allyssa Lee\n\n40. Larry Dallas, Three's Company (1977–84)\n\nSidekick to: Jack Tripper\n\nThree's Company's Jack Tripper (John Ritter) had to sublimate his heterosexuality to keep Mr. Roper happy, but his good buddy Larry (Richard Kline) boasted enough libido for the both of them. Though the tall, dark, and hairy used-car salesman had trouble finding a woman who couldn't resist his copious chest pelt — which was usually aglint with some kind of gaudy gold — Larry never failed to smooth over Jack's myriad misunderstandings with his oily lothario charm. This Regal Beagle horndog was truly man's best friend. —Kristen Baldwin\n\n39. Silent Bob, Kevin Smith films (1994–present)\n\nSidekick to: Jay\n\nIs it the weed or divine patience that keeps this man of few words mellow enough to stand by the lanky, foul-mouthed, and frequently offensive Jay (Jason Mewes)? With heroic dedication and resolve, Bob (Kevin Smith) endures Jay's verbal abuse (nicknames like ''fatty,'' ''lunchbox,'' and ''tons of fun'') and selflessly/wordlessly dispenses advice with a meaningful nod. Whether dispatching demons or explaining an esoteric film title, Bob can be counted on to save the day. —Erin Richter\n\n38. Lane Kim, Gilmore Girls (2000–07)\n\nSidekick to: Rory Gilmore\n\nLane (Keiko Agena) rocks the sidekick role in a distinctly Gilmore Girls fashion: She brings the wit and pop culture references as fast and sure as the titular Gilmores, but never outshines Rory's (Alexis Bledel) true No. 1, Mama Lorelai (Lauren Graham). Lane's own mother, the fearsome antiques maven Mrs. Kim (Emily Kuroda), is a whole different story, which makes her rock & roll rebellion the perfect counterbalance to Rory's bookish tendencies. And while she's got her own thing going on (the drumming career, the intraband marriage), she'd never try to steal the spotlight, unlike Rory's rival-turned-roomie, Paris. —Tim Gunatilaka\n\n37. Paul Shaffer, Late Night With David Letterman and Late Show With David Letterman (1982–2015)\n\nSidekick to: David Letterman\n\nFor more than three decades, this Canadian was David Letterman's trusted music man, but the perpetually-shaded Paul Shaffer remains somewhat of a mystery. How else can you describe the guy who co-wrote ''It's Raining Men'' and is enshrined at the National Black Sports and Entertainment Hall of Fame? Paul may be an enigma outside of the Late Show, but his even-keeled demeanor and easy, plentiful laughter neatly complement Letterman's cantankerous wit. —Tim Stack\n\n36. Ford Prefect, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (1979)\n\nSidekick to: Arthur Dent\n\nAs practical as a towel and as dependable as the automobile he accidentally named himself after, Ford Prefect — Arthur Dent's boozing, Betelgeusian buddy from Douglas Adams' kooky, universe-spanning epic The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy — is perhaps the best traveling companion any ape-descendant could have. He saves Arthur from certain destruction countless times while chaperoning him to unknown worlds, and such is the strength of Ford's character that he is able to survive the tale's many iterations — from radio to novels to TV to film — without ever losing his cosmic cool. —Neil Drumming\n\n35. Flo, Alice (1976–85)\n\nSidekick to: Alice\n\nWithout Flo, Alice's whole heart-and-soul-of-Mel's Diner routine would be one big yawn. Polly Holiday's Southern belle was the much-needed spice in that Arizona greasy spoon known for its chili. Alice's chemistry never recovered when Flo left for her own ill-fated spinoff, despite the subsequent drawling bombshells who tried to take her place. Replace Flo? Her catchphrase (the mark of the most elite class of sidekicks) says it all: \"Kiss my grits!\" —Jennifer Armstrong\n\n34. Barney Rubble, The Flintstones franchise (1960–present)\n\nSidekick to: Fred Flintstone\n\nThe Flintstones was conceived as the prehistoric Honeymooners, which makes Barney the Norton (see No. 8) to Fred Flintstone's Ralph — an easygoing goofball always willing to go along with whatever half-baked scheme Fred dreamed up. Barney (voiced by the great Mel Blanc, the genius behind Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck) is squat and has enormous feet, and you know what they say about big feet. —Ken Tucker\n\n33. Leonard ''Lenny'' Kosnowski and Andrew ''Squiggy'' Squiggman, Laverne & Shirley (1976–83)\n\nSidekicks to: Laverne de Fazio and Shirley Feeney\n\nAn episode of Laverne & Shirley usually went something like this: Sitting in their Milwaukee apartment, Laverne (Penny Marshall) and Shirley (Cindy Williams) find themselves in a sticky situation that can only be resolved through a harebrained plan. ''But where are we gonna find two idiots to help us?'' one of them wonders. Cut to the front door swinging open, followed by a nasally ''Hell-ohh!'' They were the original dumb and dumber — greasier than a garage floor. But while best pals Lenny (Michael McKean) and Squiggy (David Lander) may lack social and hygienic skills, they do genuinely care for the girls. Which is why, in many an episode, they find themselves stuck in the middle of a harebrained plan, sometimes involving cross-dressing. —Wook Kim\n\n32. John Oates, Hall & Oates\n\nSidekick to: Daryl Hall\n\nJohn Oates brought far more to white-soul hit machine Hall & Oates than just Tom Selleck's spare mustache and an uncanny ability to make Daryl Hall look tall. The guitarist has fared worse on his own (The Onion dubbed his 2002 solo release Phunk Shui the year's ''least essential'' album), but could Hall have scored eight No. 1 hits without his guitar-playing partner in rhyme? No can do! —Clark Collis\n\n31. Garth Algar, Saturday Night Live and Wayne's World movies (1989–present)\n\nSidekick to: Wayne Campbell\n\nGarth (Dana Carvey) is the geeky naïf-jester in the cable-access court of his best friend (and Illinois' prince of rock) Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers). His serious fear of women relegates him to second-air-guitar status, but underneath that meek exterior beats the heart of a loyal wingman (impersonating a cop to spy on Wayne's latest crush), a crafty partner in crime (expertly repositioning broadcast satellites to a record exec's limo), and a brave confidant (admitting an attraction to Bugs Bunny in drag). May you party on, most noble Garth! —Erin Richter\n\n30. Keith Richards, The Rolling Stones\n\nSidekick to: Mick Jagger\n\nThe Stones needed Sir Keith of the Blackened Teeth. Admit it: Mick Jagger's autocratic airs would be wholly unbearable without Keef's shambolic bluster to offset them. Besides, the grizzled ax-slinger has always known that backing up a flamboyant frontman has three prerequisites: (1) a never-ending dedication to finding the next killer riff, (2) the ability to play brilliantly when medicated, and (3) the willingness to tell your lead singer that his latest idea is a load of bollocks. —Tom Sinclair\n\n29. Walter Sobchak, The Big Lebowski (1998)\n\nSidekick to: Jeffrey ''The Dude'' Lebowski\n\nThe Big Lebowski character may be a little unstable and have questionable taste in fashion, but if you're a Dude in need of a beefy bowling partner or someone to help kick some nihilist ass, then look no further than Mr. Sobchak (John Goodman). He's definitely the guy you want in your corner when involved in a case of mistaken identity. Plus, he's capable of delivering one hell of a heartwarming eulogy (''Donny was a good bowler...and a good man''). —Tim Stack\n\n28. Falstaff, William Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part 1 and Henry IV, Part 2 (1597–present)\n\nSidekick to: Prince Hal\n\nThere's no shortage of fools, clowns, and jesters in Shakespeare's canon, but none are more renowned than Falstaff, who held an honored place in Prince Hal's ragtag entourage while enduring some rather blunt descriptions. (He's been called, among other things, a ''fat-kidneyed rascal'' and ''huge hill of flesh''). Even Queen Elizabeth I was a Falstaff fan — so much so that in The Merry Wives of Windsor, the Bard elevated the sack-loving rogue from sidekick to star. —Melissa Rose Bernardo\n\n27. Hank Kingsley, The Larry Sanders Show (1992–98)\n\nSidekick to: Larry Sanders\n\nOn The Larry Sanders Show, he was never more than a couch's length away, with his catchphrase ''Hey now!'' always cocked and ready to let fly, usually at an inappropriate moment. Clueless about comedy, wildly misinformed about his own showbiz importance, Hank (Jeffrey Tambor) was an Ed McMahon without the charm or self-awareness. But all these debits for the boobish, boorish Hank added up to one irreplaceable credit to Larry Sanders (Garry Shandling), giving the insecure host exactly what he needed — an on-air scapegoat. —Josh Wolk\n\n26. The Supremes, Diana Ross & the Supremes\n\nSidekicks to: Diana Ross\n\nPeanut butter and jelly. Ham and cheese. Spaghetti and meatballs. All of these things can be enjoyed separately, but are better taken together — like Diana Ross and her Supremes. There was something indeed magical in the pairing of a young diva-in-the-making with two other complementary chanteuses, Mary Wilson and Florence Ballard (the latter was replaced by Cindy Birdsong in 1967, remember?). After Ross left to pursue solo stardom in 1970, both she and her backup singers would score further hits. Still, it was never the same, was it? —Tom Sinclair\n\n25. Art Garfunkel, Simon & Garfunkel\n\nSidekick to: Paul Simon\n\nGranted, Paul Simon wrote the majority of the songs, played lead guitar, and received all the accolades, but his childhood friend Art Garfunkel provided the duo's soul by groovin' on the tambourine (and sporting a truly spectacular hairdo). More importantly, Garfunkel cemented his status as the ''and'' in the band with his soaring vocals on the 1970 classic \"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\" forever fulfilling that promise of ''sailing right behind.'' —Paul Katz\n\n24. Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw, Top Gun (1986)\n\nSidekick to: Pete ''Maverick'' Mitchell\n\nHe's smart and honest and has a wit that travels at Mach 1. But it's only after his final ride into the danger zone that we realize just how special Top Gun's Goose (Anthony Edwards) truly is. Without him, Maverick (Tom Cruise) has nobody to navigate his F-14 while giving bogeys the bird, nobody to harmonize with on ''You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin','' nobody to set up studly volleyball spikes, and — most significantly — nobody to high-five when he feels ''the need, the need for speed.'' Goose had such an impact that his best friend still felt his presence 36 years later in Top Gun: Maverick. —Joshua Rich\n\n23. Rhoda Morgenstern, The Mary Tyler Moore Show (1970–77)\n\nSidekick to: Mary Richards\n\nRhoda (Valerie Harper) didn't start out as sidekick material. Indeed, her first words to Mary (Mary Tyler Moore) were ''Get out of my apartment.'' But the neurotic Bronx native soon became indispensable, always there to help out The Mary Tyler Moore Show's lead character with dating and dinner parties. Rhoda was the sass to Mary's spunk, the head scarf to Mary's beret. She was so beloved that she transcended sidekick status and scored a show of her own. —Jessica Shaw\n\n22. Pedro Sanchez, Napoleon Dynamite (2004)\n\nSidekick to: Napoleon Dynamite\n\nAn odd man out in an Idaho high school, Pedro (Efren Ramirez) is the cool yin to Napoleon's (Jon Heder) tempestuous yang. With his mellow manner, the blank-faced Pedro doesn't exactly light up the screen in Napoleon Dynamite. Instead, the peach-fuzzed candidate for class president quietly inspires his even weirder buddy to take center stage — literally, with a kick-ass dance routine. The result? A landslide victory for ''Vote for Pedro'' T-shirts. —Michael Endelman\n\n21. Gromit, Wallace and Gromit franchise (1989–present)\n\nSidekick to: Wallace\n\nLoyal doesn't even begin to describe the depth of Gromit's canine devotion. For the sake of his daffy British owner — the incessantly inventing, calamitously clueless Wallace — Gromit has battled a jewel-thieving fugitive penguin (The Wrong Trousers), tussled with a sheep-rustling robot dog (A Close Shave), and wrangled a veggie-wolfing Were-Rabbit (The Curse of the Were-Rabbit). And though the pooch must always undo his owner's blunders to save the day, he never utters a single complaint, a testament to his remarkable stoicism (and the fact that he doesn't technically have a mouth). —Adam B. Vary\n\n20. Salvatore \"Turtle\" Assante, Entourage (2004–11)\n\nSidekick to: Vincent Chase\n\nWherever Entourage A-lister Vincent (Adrian Grenier) goes, mad money, hot babes, and his Queens posse follow. But while Eric (Kevin Connolly) is the manager, and half-brother Drama (Kevin Dillon) has the family ties, wisecracker Turtle (Jerry Ferrara) is the gang's most superfluous, and thus most essentially Hollywood, member. He's hanging on for dear life, smoking pot, and offering (im)moral support. Sure, his rapper Saigon almost blew up, but even with his own gig, Turtle will always be our Best Supporting Slacker. —Dan Snierson\n\n19. Barney Fife, The Andy Griffith Show (1960–68)\n\nSidekick to: Andy Taylor\n\nAs deputy of Mayberry, N.C., in The Andy Griffith Show, the soda-straw-thin and easily rattled Barney Fife (Don Knotts) is so incompetent that Sheriff Taylor (Andy Griffith) allows him to carry just one bullet — in his pocket. Barney, whose buffoonery only serves to highlight Andy's wisdom, is a cheerfully deluded man — blustery and prone to panic attacks during any emergency, yet loving and loved by Andy, Opie (Ron Howard), and every resident of the bucolic Eden he swore to protect. —Ken Tucker\n\n18. Andy Richter, Late Night With Conan O'Brien, The Tonight Show With Conan O'Brien, and Conan (1993–2021)\n\nSidekick to: Conan O'Brien\n\nAndy Richter, Conan O'Brien's longtime second chair, spoke softly but carried a big shtick, adept at playing both the imp (e.g., crooning in a boy band comprised of four different Andys) and the meathead (wandering nude onto the Today show set). —Paul Katz\n\n17. Willow Rosenberg, Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997–2003)\n\nSidekick to: Buffy Summers\n\nThe once-mousy No. 2 behind Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar)'s superhero, Willow (a nerd-cool pioneer) tempers the vampire slayer's quip-spouting, melodramatic ways with patience, reason, and a readiness to roam the nether regions of the demon world. Eventually, Willow (Alyson Hannigan) develops her own super-identity — without ever upstaging her stake-wielding pal — by dating a werewolf, becoming a scary-good witch, and gracefully coming out. —Nisha Gopalan\n\n16. Waylon Smithers, The Simpsons (1989–present)\n\nSidekick to: C. Montgomery Burns\n\nThe dutiful electron to Mr. Burns' evil proton, The Simpsons' Smithers takes devotion to new subatomic lows — whether it's disciplining a lazy workforce, moistening a pair of eyeballs, or removing the dead skin off his cadaverous employer. But as devoted a personal assistant as he may be, Smithers' chest tattoo of Burns' scraggly mug and the words ''Boss of My Heart'' belies an unrequited dream of a more amorous kind of fusion. —Timothy Gunatilaka\n\n15. Andrew Ridgeley, Wham!\n\nSidekick to: George Michael\n\nTo the untrained ear, Andrew Ridgeley seemed to contribute so little to Wham! that ''Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go'' might as well have been his request to George Michael while working in the studio. But the guitarist who helped launch Michael's solo career is having the last laugh: Thanks to a co-writing credit on ''Careless Whisper,'' Ridgeley may well earn more during an afternoon nap than you do in a month. Who's the punchline now? —Clark Collis\n\n14. Sancho Panza, Don Quixote (1605–present)\n\nSidekick to: Don Quixote de la Mancha\n\nDon Quixote may be the star of Miguel de Cervantes' deeply ironic, surprisingly modern satire of macho heroism, but Sancho is the earthy everyman. Grubby, even criminal, tasks come easily to the unabashedly ungallant Sancho. He also serves as the voice of truth — those fearsome giants are only windmills, and Quixote's shiny helmet is a barber's basin. Ultimately, Sancho's most important duty may be to rescue the Man of La Mancha from his worst foe: himself. —Ben Spier\n\n13. Robin Quivers, The Howard Stern Show (1981–present)\n\nSidekick to: Howard Stern\n\nA supportive and ego-boosting sidekick in the vein of Ed McMahon, Robin Quivers has stood by Howard's side for decades. Through the King of All Media's various firings and fines — not to mention visits from countless strippers and other entertainers so sketchy you're glad it's radio — it is Robin who has remained a fixture in his court. Her calming voice, infectious laugh, and comforting presence are a welcome balance to Howard's neurotic, rage-filled id. —Michael Endelman\n\n12. Donkey, Shrek franchise (2001–present)\n\nSidekick to: Shrek\n\nDonkey has more than his share of divisive qualities. He talks too much, is (unsurprisingly) stubborn, and has the habit of breaking out into song. But when you're a green ogre, there's a lot to be said about someone willing to accept you at face value. Donkey is the friend who loves Shrek enough to make the monster love himself. For that, we heart him — even though he can sometimes be an ass. —Gilbert Cruz\n\n11. Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, Harry Potter franchise (books: 1997–2007; films: 2001–11)\n\nSidekicks to: Harry Potter\n\nWhen you're a teenage wizard pursued by an evil warlock who killed your parents, it helps to have friends like these. Without Hermione's brains, Harry would never know which herb or incantation to use. And Ron? Well, he and the Weasley clan provide Harry with the one thing he needs the most: family. —Gilbert Cruz\n\n10. Dwight Schrute, The Office (2005–13)\n\nSidekick to: Michael Scott\n\nPart sycophant, part disciplinarian, all royal pain, The Office's Dwight (Rainn Wilson) is so eager to serve his boss that once, while racing to Michael's (Steve Carell) aid, he crashed his Trans-Am into a pole (and vomited all over the car). His creepy devotion is best described by the man-child himself: ''He's like Mozart, and I'm like Mozart's friend. No, I'm like Butch Cassidy, and Michael is like Mozart. You try and hurt Mozart, you're gonna get a bullet in your head, courtesy of Butch Cassidy.'' —Dan Snierson\n\n9. Tattoo, Fantasy Island (1978–83)\n\nSidekick to: Mr. Roarke\n\nWe never understood the relationship between Mr. Roarke (Ricardo Montalbán) and Tattoo (Hervé Villechaize). Yes, they obviously share the same amazing tailor, but there's something vaguely menacing about the way Roarke refers to his diminutive companion as ''my little friend.'' Whatever his role, Tattoo gave Fantasy Island yet another layer of mystery. Still, is that excitement — or the longing for a better life—we hear in his voice when he exclaims, ''Da plane! Da plane!''? —Wook Kim\n\n8. Ed Norton, Cavalcade of Stars and The Honeymooners (1951–56)\n\nSidekick to: Ralph Kramden\n\nThe Honeymooners' happy-go-lucky sewer worker serves as the omega to his irascible alpha-dog neighbor, and a co-conspirator in his crackpot schemes. Ed (Art Carney)'s loose-limbed antics also make him the target of his buddy's sputtering effusions to ''G-e-e-e-e-t OUT!'' And while Norton occasionally one-ups Ralph (Jackie Gleason) with a sly zinger (''When you come down the street, there ain't no other side''), he never loses his space-cadet charm. —Ben Spier\n\n7. Samwise Gamgee, J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings series (1954–present)\n\nSidekick to: Frodo Baggins\n\nWhy is good ol' Sam (Sean Astin) so indispensable? Because Mr. Frodo's (Elijah Wood) hairy hobbit heinie wasn't going to get to Mordor all by itself, was it? As Frodo's stouthearted servant, Sam of the Shire is the archetypal companion. He's devoted (see J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy and Peter Jackson's 681-and-counting minutes of film), selfless (two words: ''Bye-bye, Bill''), and honest (suddenly consumed with a desire to rule the world? Sam will call you on it). Despite constantly rising to the orc-chasing, giant-spider-battling, Middle-earth-saving occasion, Sam still ends up the second fiddle. And the humble halfling gardener wouldn't have it any other way. —Mandi Bierly\n\n6. Dr. Watson, Sherlock Holmes franchise (1887–present)\n\nSidekick to: Sherlock Holmes\n\nWho can ignore the good doctor's contributions to the sidekick community? Would Holmes' thunderclap insights resonate without that sturdy Watsonian sounding board? More to the point: Who'd tell the story in the first place? Watson is more than Holmes's friend: He (she, in the case of the CBS series Elementary) is his humanity. The great detective is a bit of a calculating machine; Watson's his link to our species. Holmes may deduce the who, what, when, and where, but Watson gives us the why. —Scott Brown\n\n5. Ethel Mertz, I Love Lucy and The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour (1951–60)\n\nSidekick to: Lucy Ricardo\n\nWithout Ethel to bail her out each week on I Love Lucy, original desperate housewife Lucy (Lucille Ball) would have been in real trouble. But as cannily played by Vivian Vance, Mrs. Mertz — whose spats with hubby Fred (William Frawley) hinted at dysfunction when TV rarely even acknowledged marital discord — makes for a perfectly exasperated partner in crime: happy to play along, even happier to put the kibosh on her pickle-prone friend's worst impulses. —Nicholas Fonseca\n\n4. Chewbacca, Star Wars franchise (1977–present)\n\nSidekick to: Han Solo\n\nChewbacca's gentle growl questioning Han's (Harrison Ford) decision to abandon the Rebels in Episode IV speaks volumes about loyalty. In rescuing Yoda from clone assassins in Episode III, this ''walking carpet'' did more to save the galaxy than anyone's ever given him credit for. Protector of princesses, crack hyperdrive repairman, and unranked amateur dejarik player, Chewie's biggest role may be that of the Millennium Falcon's furry conscience. —Whitney Pastorek\n\n3. George Costanza, Seinfeld (1990–98)\n\nSidekick to: Jerry Seinfeld\n\nLoyal. Dependable. Generous. These words describe the finest sidekicks. They do not describe George Costanza (Jason Alexander). Jerry's pal is known to lie, cheat, and steal (not really, though he once smuggled a book into a restroom). So what is it that keeps him on Jerry's speed dial? The comic's understanding that his own complicated, annoyance-ridden existence is that much better when compared with his short, bald buddy's. That's better than nothing. —Wook Kim\n\n2. Robin, Batman franchise (1940–present)\n\nSidekick to: Batman\n\nThe Boy Wonder (né Dick Grayson) is the most iconic comic book No. 2 of all time—and the source of all cape-and-tights homoeroticism. Armchair analysis aside, he's a perfect No. 2 template: helping No. 1 thwack! pow! the bad guys, getting captured (or killed) when it suits No. 1's story line, and, most importantly, letting No. 1 get all the glory. —Scott Brow\n\n1. Ed McMahon, The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962–92)\n\nSidekick to: Johnny Carson\n\nTo say it's fitting that a former carnival barker would become the guy who hawked Johnny Carson and his guests at the top of The Tonight Show is to underestimate McMahon's unique television skills. ''Here's Johnny!'' became a catchphrase entirely because McMahon had a jazz musician's timing, sensing exactly how long to stretch the ''Heeeeeere's'' until it met the abrupt slash of the ''Johnny!'' If you watched him closely, you saw that McMahon was a master at keeping the conversational ball rolling, a subtle straight man. He saved a lot of middling material with an ad-lib or a prodding guffaw, highlighting Johnny's great jokes by rolling out rich, genuine, infectious laughter. That's what friends — and sidekicks — are for. —Ken Tucker"
