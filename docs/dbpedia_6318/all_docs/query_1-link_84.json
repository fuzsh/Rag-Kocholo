That’s because you’re only seeing popular titles and recommendations based on your previous selections.\n\nI’ll list Netflix’s secret codes by genre so they’re easier to recognize and use. From anime to Sci-Fi to sports movies, you can find a code for it and game the algorithm.\n\nEach category includes many sub-categories. If you’ve got niche preferences, like political drama or zombie horror movies, just enter that sub-category code to access your favorite movie genre. Be warned Netflix has a lot of content to go through. You won’t find all these codes in a TikTok video, so make sure to check the list below for specifics.\n\nPro-Tip: Use the main genre code and scroll through the sub-categories to figure out what you’d like to watch, if you’re not sure what to look for.\n\n90-Minute Movies (81466194)\n\nDon’t let the story drag on with these short movies!\n\n30-Minute Laughs – 81602050\n\n90-Minute Comedies – 81466224\n\n90-Minute Family Movies – 81466229\n\n90-Minute Horror – 81466239\n\n90-Minute Rom-Coms – 81466228\n\n90-Minute Thrillers – 81466222\n\nShort-Ass Movies – 81603903\n\nWatch in One Night – 3178549\n\nWatch in One Weekend – 3182735\n\nAction & Adventure (1365)\n\nGet your adrenaline pumping with Netflix’s best action movies.\n\nAction Comedies – 43040\n\nAction Thrillers – 43048\n\nAdventures – 7442\n\nClassic Action & Adventure – 46576\n\nComic Book and Superhero Movies – 10118\n\nCrime Action & Adventure – 9584\n\nMartial Arts Movies – 8985\n\nMilitary Action & Adventure – 2125\n\nWesterns – 7700\n\nSpy Action & Adventure – 10702\n\nAnime (7424)\n\nDiscover the best Japanese animation for kids and adults!\n\nAdult Animation – 11881\n\nAnime Action – 2653\n\nAnime Comedies – 9302\n\nAnime Dramas – 452\n\nAnime Fantasy – 11146\n\nAnime Features – 3063\n\nAnime Horror – 10695\n\nAnime Sci-Fi – 2729\n\nAnime Series – 6721\n\nChildren & Family (783)\n\nNothing says quality family time like a family movie night.\n\nAnimal Tales – 5507\n\nDisney – 67673\n\nEducation for Kids – 10659\n\nFamily Features – 51056\n\nKids’ Music – 52843\n\nKids’ TV – 27346\n\nMovies based on children’s books – 10056\n\nTV Cartoons – 11177\n\nClassics (31574)\n\nCheck out all the old but gold movies available.\n\nClassic Comedies – 31694\n\nClassic Dramas – 29809\n\nClassic Sci-Fi & Fantasy – 47147\n\nClassic Thrillers – 46588\n\nClassic War Movies – 48744\n\nClassic Westerns – 47465\n\nEpics – 52858\n\nFilm Noir – 7687\n\nSilent Movies – 53310\n\nComedies (6548)\n\nTickle your funny bone with the best comedies on Netflix.\n\nDark Comedies – 869\n\nLate Night Comedies – 1402\n\nMockumentaries – 26\n\nPolitical Comedies – 2700\n\nRomantic Comedies – 5475\n\nSatires – 4922\n\nScrewball Comedies – 9702\n\nSlapstick Comedies – 10256\n\nSports Comedies – 5286\n\nStand-up Comedy – 11559\n\nTeen Comedies – 3519\n\nCult Flicks (7627)\n\nDon’t let passionate fandoms dictate what’s worth watching.

If you’re having issues searching on the Netflix app, switch to your browser and add whatever catches your eye to My list. It’s the easiest way to access the shows on all devices.\n\nExtra Netflix Secrets\n\nYou have to admit, that’s quite a generous list!\n\nThat said, if you haven’t found the movie or show you’re looking for, you can suggest it on Netflix’s dedicated webpage, and they might add it in the future. You can submit up to three recommendations at once. If three isn’t enough, send a new request as often as you’d like and wait for Netflix to get back to you.\n\nIf you live in a student dorm or use a Wi-Fi network that restricts access to streaming sites, you may not be able to watch all of Netflix’s movies and shows. Unblock Netflix on your school or work network with CyberGhost VPN.\n\nHow to Find Similar Content on Netflix\n\nNetflix codes are a nice feature but they can be overwhelming. You don’t always want to scroll through hundreds of movies and read all the plot summaries. Sometimes, you just want to watch something with the same feel as the movie you just finished.\n\nIf you enjoyed a movie or series, you can find similar content without relying on the You might like section. You simply need the show’s ID number.\n\nHere’s how it works.\n\nCheck the URL of the show you’ve just seen.\n\nCopy the number after the last slash — that’s the title ID.\n\nAdd the title ID at the end of www.netflix.com/browse/similars/\n\nEnjoy streaming!\n\nDo the Netflix Secret Codes Work on PS4 & Xbox?\n\nNetflix used to have some issues on older consoles. For example, on the PS3 it used to be difficult to change your Netflix profile. That’s why Netflix implemented their own version of the Konami code to reset the app. For that, you would have to hit up-up-down-down-left-right-left-right-up-up-up-up on your controller while the Netflix app was open.\n\nNowadays, the Netflix app is optimized to work consistently across multiple devices. Newer generation consoles, like the PS4 and Xbox One didn’t have this issue. Of course, PS5 and Xbox Series S & X also work just fine with Netflix.\n\nStream on Any Network with a Fast VPN\n\nIf you’re traveling to or living somewhere with a restrictive Wi-Fi, like a hotel or student dorm, you might not be able to use the Netflix secret codes. This is because the network administrators will block Netflix’s domain to prevent network congestion and overcrowding.\n\nCyberGhost VPN is perfect to let you keep watching the best Netflix shows and movies. If you connect to one of our servers, the VPN will encrypt your connection, preventing others from interfering with your internet traffic. We have 10Gbps servers which translates into fast VPN speeds and smooth streaming for you. Our streaming-optimized servers are a quick one-click connect away from your Netflix catalog binge-session.\n\nWe don’t enforce any bandwidth restrictions or data caps, so you can check out as many Netflix shows as you want. Use the Netflix secret codes to pull together a hefty to-watch list! Is your student dorm or ISP throttling your late-night movie marathon? Use CyberGhost VPN to bypass all content-based throttling. Enjoy a buffer-free and UHD movie night seamlessly.\n\nTry us out with our 45-day money-back guarantee!\n\nFAQ"
