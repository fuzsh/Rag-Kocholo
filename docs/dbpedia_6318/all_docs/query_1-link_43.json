        "text": "London Crime Films for Streaming and DVD’S\n\nHere we concentrate on British gangster films that are mainly based in London, Bare Knuckle Boxing, heists, madmen, history, criminals, villains, Football hooligans, gangs and violence. Watching a good film at the cinema is great, especially you want to treat the family to see the latest new releases and blockbuster movies, that’s absolutely fine! But most cinema’s film listings are very limited, especially if you’re after the best UK Gangster movies.\n\nWe have personally watched each and every one of the films in the list below. The UK film industry has released some real classic British gangster films over the years, scroll through the list and you will see a range of films from top UK releases that have done really well at the cinema, through to smaller independent films with lower budgets. Try to allow for this when watching these films, as some of the low budget films have a great storyline and, although maybe not as “refined” as compared to the high budget films, they are definitely worth watching. If You want the best gangster films, then look no further! you’re in the right place.\n\nThe latest new films at the cinema are not necessarily the ones that you want to watch, as a lot of the best films don’t get released for the cinema, and instead they go straight to blu-ray and dvd (or can be streamed through various outlets like Amazon and Netflix) Also, there are some of the best classic gangster movies below, proper classic films that are always worth a watch!\n\nWe love London based British gangster films at Londoncrime, so if you’ve seen a film that you think should be added to this list, please mention this by contacting us through our social media channels, we’ll take a look and add them if they are relevant.\n\nAs you scroll through the list, you will see some great films that were released in the 1960’s and 1970’s.. these make some great entertainment as you can see clips with the old cars of the time, and also see some of the changing landscape of London since these were filmed. This can make for a fascinating look at London’s past!\n\nGET THE BEST BRITISH GANGSTER FILMS FOR HOME VIEWING!\n\nFor an entertaining evening at home, get some snacks and drinks, invite your mates around, settle in and have a butcher’s at this ever-growing fantastic list of the best British gangster movies ever!
