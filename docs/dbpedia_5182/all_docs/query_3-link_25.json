        "text": "Robson Ranch Denton HOA\n\nSituated on a beautiful stretch of wide-open land, within a few miles of historic downtown Denton, Texas, Robson Ranch is offering a lifestyle as big as Texas. It is an ideal location away from the big city life yet within easy reach of family, friends, jobs and favorite haunts in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex. Here you will find the values and roots of a small town combined with the sizzle of the big city. It is the best of both worlds.\n\nLocated within a half hour of the Dallas/Fort Worth Airport, Robson Ranch is the best-selling active adult community in North Texas. It is attracting people who appreciate tradition, fun, relaxation and friendships; people who want more from life, not less. In fact, it was voted one of the nations's best retirement places by Where to Retire magazine. From neighborhood barbecues to dining at the Grill, new friendships are easily formed because your neighbors are just like you.\n\nDo more. Learn more. Be more. It's all here. Imagine waking up and going for a brisk walk or bike ride through the community, head to the Grill for a tasty lunch with friends and wrap up the day with a sunset libation in the Lounge. Other days you're hitting the tennis courts in the a.m. or a golf game scheduled for the afternoon. Or maybe you'll try your hand at basketball in the multi-purpose gymnasium."
