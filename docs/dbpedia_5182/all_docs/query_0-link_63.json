        "text": "The I-35E Phase 2 project will reconstruct and widen a 6.39-mile southern section of I-35E in Dallas County from I-635 to Denton County Line. The project will consist of widening the section from 6 to 8 lanes and improving intersections and frontage roads to decrease congestion and improve safety for motorists. This project has been identified through the Texas Clear Lanes Initiative, a statewide strategic plan, as an area in need of updates in order to relieve traffic congestion and increase economic development.\n\nDuring the open houses in May, the I-35E Phase 2 Project Team shared about project goals, which areas will be impacted, and the construction timeline.\n\nThe project is a full reconstruction of approximately 6.39 miles along I-35E and is part of Texas Clear Lanes which focuses on reducing congestion on major highways in Texas.\n\nWatch the meeting recordings using the links below.\n\nResources\n\nTo learn more about I-35E visit KeepItMovingDallas.\n\nLearn more about the historical context of this build and I-35E Environmental review and Schematics.\n\nReference Information\n\nEnvironmental Review and Schematics\n\nLearn more about the project by visiting our Frequently asked questions page."
