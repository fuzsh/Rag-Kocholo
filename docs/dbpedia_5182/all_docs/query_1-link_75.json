The Town is located in the southwest corner of Denton County, along Interstate 35W and State Highway 114.\n\nNorthlake Location\n\nWhile Northlake is primarily characterized by wide open spaces of undeveloped ranch land with rolling topography, the Town also benefits from the major highways which pass through providing easy access to points throughout North Texas but most notably the neighboring Texas Motor Speedway and Alliance Corridor. Northlake truly provides the best of both worlds with the rural Texas lifestyle and easy access to all the amenities of the 4th largest metropolitan area in the United States."
