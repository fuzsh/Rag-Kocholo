        "text": "What is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)?\n\nOSA is the most diagnosed form of sleep apnea. It causes breathing to stop during sleep as a result of the collapse of soft oral tissues and the throat onto the airway. When this occurs, a blockage happens, leading to sudden gasping for air and waking. Depending on the severity of the condition, these episodes can happen just once or hundreds of times each night!\n\nHow is sleep apnea treated?\n\nFortunately, there are multiple sleep apnea treatment options to choose from:\n\nCPAP Therapy â CPAP machines (continuous positive airway pressure machine) push air into a mask thatâs worn over the face to force the airway open as you sleep, reducing the number of episodes throughout the night. While these devices have come far over the last decade, some patients find it uncomfortable to sleep with a mask on their face.\n\nOral appliance therapy â Oral appliance therapy utilizes a customized device that fits in the mouth to gently shift the jaw and keep the airway open during sleep. These devices are easy to use, comfortable since theyâre customized for your unique oral structure, and easy to travel with.\n\nWhat causes snoring?\n\nSnoring occurs when there is an obstruction in the airway, like a blocked nasal or throat cavity that makes it harder to breathe freely. When the muscles in these areas become relaxed, they vibrate and create the snoring sound we all dread to hear!\n\nHow do oral devices treat sleep apnea and/or snoring?\n\nOral devices used to treat sleep apnea and help with snoring work by shifting the jaw slightly forward to open the airway and keep the throat muscles and soft oral tissues from collapsing. This allows for the free flow of air into the lungs as you sleep, reducing snoring and other sleep apnea symptoms.\n\nWhat are some common types of sleep disorders?\n\nThere are more sleep disorders than many of our patients imagine, including insomnia, nocturia, restless leg syndrome, and shift-work disorder. Each can impact your quality of sleep, but fortunately, our sleep experts are familiar with all of these, along with more, to provide you with the specialized, custom-tailored treatment you need to improve your quality of rest and life.\n\nWhat should I expect for my first visit?\n\nEach of our patients completes a thorough consultation that includes an overview of your medical history as well as your family health history. Weâll also capture images and scans of your oral and facial anatomy to give us an idea of whatâs happening within your body. Weâll then speak with you about the symptoms youâre experiencing, giving us an even better look into what disorder you may be battling with. Finally, weâll make a diagnosis and discuss each of your treatment options with you so we can make a custom-tailored plan to address your complaints and improve your quality of rest and health."
