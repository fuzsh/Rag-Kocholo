        "text": "In 1926, Kib Hundley built his first boat and gave rides on the newly constructed Lake Dallas. Hundley also repaired and constructed sailboats, canoes, rowboats, and power boats for what is now Texas Woman’s University. By 1936, Hundley became a dealer for Chris Craft wooden power boats. By the 1960s, Hundley Boat Company was the Southwest’s largest Chris Craft dealer and a prominent feature of the North Texas community. Hundley Boat Co. operated two marinas on Lake Lewisville.\n\nBeginning in 1930, Texas State College for Women (now TWU) utilized Lake Dallas for recreational use. The lake was popular for camping, swimming, sailing, canoeing, rowing and picnics. The twenty-acre campsite had three cabins for day and night use. The college owned four canoes that were crafted and maintained by Hundley Boat Company.\n\nThe Lake Dallas camp closed in 1953 due to a severe drought and the pending expansion of Lake Dallas into Lake Lewisville. The same drought had a major impact on Hundley Boat Company.\n\nThe lake dried out each summer because there was not an upstream of water to maintain lake levels. Hundley’s marinas suffered as boat owners were forced to moved to other lakes. In the 1950’s, Kib recognized the struggle that the family-owned boat company was facing and new that it would one day close because of the inconsistent water levels of the lake.\n\nLike Kib predicted, the lake levels did play a major role in the eventual closure of Hundley Boat Co. Although the marinas no longer stand, the grandson of Kib Hundley shares and reflects on the heritage of the company on their Facebook page.\n\nInformation and images from Denton County Courthouse-on-the-Square Museum archives and Hundley Boat Company Facebook page.\n\nWritten by Madison S.\n\nThe history of how Lewisville Lake got its name is surprisingly convoluted. One would assume the lake received the name due to its proximity to the city of Lewisville. However, it’s a bit more complicated than that. Back in the 1920’s, Dallas was in need of another water supply to meet the needs of its rather large population. To do this, an area north of the city was selected to become a reservoir. In 1924, construction of the dam began and the area where the reservoir would be began to be cleared. To make working on the dam more convenient, tents were erected near the site for the workers. People of the nearby small town of Garza also benefitted from their proximity to the construction. Garza bordered the reservoir giving its residents business from the construction workers, work opportunities in the construction itself, and new lake-front property. In 1927, the dam and reservoir were completed and the new body of water was named Lake Dallas. Shortly after the completion of the the reservoir, in 1929, the city of Garza changed its name to Lake Dallas to reflect its proximity to the new lake.\n\nNearly two decades after the completion of Lake Dallas, in 1946, it was decided that four more dams would be constructed on the Trinity River. Two of the four dams were constructed in Denton County. One of these two would span both Denton and Tarrant County and become Grapevine Reservoir and Dam. The other dam in Denton County was the largest of the four and built next to Lake Dallas. This dam and reservoir came to be known as the Garza-Little Elm Reservoir and Dam due to its proximity to the cities of Lake Dallas, formerly Garza, and Little Elm. Construction of the Garza-Little Elm Reservoir and Dam began in 1948 and completed in 1955. On August 9, 1955, a bill introduced by congressman Frank Ikard was passed to change the name of the Garza-Little Elm Dam to Lewisville Dam. The reservoir, however, was to remain the Garza-Little Elm Reservoir.\n\nIn the meantime, after the construction of Lake Dallas, the city of Dallas continued to grow. By the 1950’s the city was in need of an even greater water supply. In 1957, the dam separating Lake Dallas and Garza-Little Elm Reservoir was breached. This commingling of the two bodies of water is where the naming begins to get muddled. Officially, the new body of water formed from the joining of these two reservoirs retained the name Garza-Little Elm Reservoir. However, many still referred to the body of water as Lake Dallas. The lake would keep the Garza-Little Elm name until 1971 when a Corps of Engineers policy set on February 11th determined that the word ‘lake’ be used in place of ‘dam’. So, instead of calling the body of water the Garza-Little Elm Reservoir and Dam, the body of water would take on the name of the dam followed by the word ‘lake’. Remember that the dam was renamed Lewisville Dam in 1955, but the body of water was still called Garza-Little Elm Reservoir. The Corps of Engineers policy stated that the body of water take the name of the dam, in this case Lewisville Dam, and replace the ‘dam’ with ‘lake’ thus resulting in the current name: Lewisville Lake.\n\nTo make matters even more confusing for the residents of the area, signage was less than stellar when it came to keeping up with the official name of the lake. Changing the signs was an expensive process and policy dictated that signs be replaced only when necessary and funds were available. So, even though the official name, as of 1971, was Lewisville Lake, it wasn’t until 1976 that funds were made available to update the signage. As a result, confusion regarding the official naming of the lake was so pervasive that local news still referred to the lake as Lake Dallas despite that not being the official name since 1957. To address the confusion, the Lake Dallas City Council ordered the City Administrator to investigate the history of the lake to determine both the official name of the lake as well as how and when the lake got its name. In 1976, Lake Dallas City Administrator Joe Yalenty began his investigation with the help of Lewisville Lake engineer, Hassel L. Holder, and uncovered this complex history of Lewisville Lake.\n\nInformation used in this blog post was pulled from The Colony Public Library Website, the City of Lewisville website, and a Denton Record-Chronicle article housed in the Denton County Archives located at the Courthouse-on-the-Square Museum.\n\nAnonymous.

This week’s blog features the history of Denton County’s three main bodies of water: Lake Lewisville, Lake Ray Roberts, and Lake Grapevine.\n\nBefore the lakes were dammed, the main water sources in Denton County were tributaries of the Elm Fork branch of the Trinity River: Denton Creek, Hickory Creek, and Clear Creek. However, settlers of the area in the late 1800’s were hit with rotating seasons of flooding and famine. Spring rains caused the cities and farms to overflow, while summer brought severe drought. These constant weather changes made it clear that the region needed a more consistent source of water.\n\nBy the 1920’s, it was decided that the problem needed to be solved. A plan was made to dam a tributary of the Elm Fork, and in February of 1928 construction began on the Lake Dallas reservoir. The lake was built by the W. E. Callahan Construction Company at a cost of just over $3 million, covering over 10,000 acres. The lake’s 80 foot high, 11,000 foot long dam stood near Garza, a town that was renamed Lake Dallas in 1929.\n\nLake Dallas served as the primary water source for the City of Dallas for 30 years, and there was quite the debate about over the use of the lake. The City of Dallas wanted to restrict recreation on the lake because they feared the Denton County residents would spoil their drinking water. Denton County had been promised use of the lake for recreation, and would not prosecute anyone found swimming in the lake. Denton County won the debate, and Lake Dallas became a popular recreation spot. Eventually, Lake Dallas joined with the Garza-Little Elm reservoir to form Lake Lewisville.\n\nLake Lewisville\n\nLake Lewisville is located 15 miles southeast of Denton, and is operated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Its purpose is to control potential flood waters in the Elm Fork drainage basin, in addition, the lake assists in soil conservation, serves as a recreational area, and provides water for local municipalities.\n\nThe Lake Lewisville dam was built in 1957, creating a new reservoir twice as large as the original Lake Dallas. Once completed, Lake Lewisville attracted visitors and tourists to Denton County. It also provided a steady water supply that allowed for more growth in the area.\n\nWhen the Corps of Engineers closed the dam in 1986 and opened Lake Ray Roberts, the water level in Lake Lewisville became more constant. This made its shorelines an attractive residential area, and the population continued to grow.\n\nLake Lewisville now spans 29,000 acres and has 233 miles of shoreline, surrounded by 9,000 protected acres of nature. With an average depth of 25 feet, the lake is large enough to host an array of recreational activities, from fishing and boating to hiking and biking. Geology students and scientists from across the country have also taken notice of Lake Lewisville, as several dinosaur and extinct animal remains have been found on site.\n\nThe southern shore of the lake is home Lewisville Lake Park, a 622-acre park managed by the City of Lewisville. The park is a spot for picnics and camping, and hosts pavilions, fishing barges, swimming beaches, and athletic facilities.\n\nLake Grapevine\n\nIn the southern portion of Denton County, Denton Creek is a source of water for Lake Grapevine. The lake lies partially in Denton County and partially in Tarrant County, near the towns of Flower Mound, Trophy Club, Roanoke, and Southlake.\n\nConstruction began on Lake Grapevine as part of the Grapevine Dam and Reservoir project in 1948, and was completed in 1952. It became a prime location for boating, fishing, camping, and other recreational activities, and by the 1990’s, a residential area developed along the shoreline.\n\nNow, the lake’s surface area covers more than 7,300 acres, and continues to be enjoyed by visitors and residents. Like Lake Lewisville, Lake Grapevine’s primary purpose is flood control. It too is owned by the United States government and operated by the Fort Worth district of the United States Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nLake Ray Roberts\n\nThe Elm Fork of the Trinity River was dammed to form Lake Ray Roberts in the 1980’s in northern Denton County. Isle Du Bois Creek had once flowed through the area, for 17 miles across Grayson County, Cooke County and northern Denton County for seventeen miles.\n\nLake Ray Roberts is a beautiful lake destination located between Sanger, Texas and Pilot Point Texas, about 10 miles north of Denton. The Army Corps of Engineers started work in September 1981. They originally called it the Aubrey Reservoir, but renamed the lake before construction. It was named after water conservationist Herbert Ray Roberts from McKinney, TX.\n\nThe lake provides water to Dallas and Denton, but that’s not all. It helps contain floods, stores water, provides fish and wildlife habitat, and offers fishing, swimming and boating. lake now has bike and hiking trails, places to picnic, playgrounds, camping, etc.\n\nAll information in this blog was pulled from the Office of History & Culture’s records and from the Texas State Historical Association’s website.\n\nRelated"
