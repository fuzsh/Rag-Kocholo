        "text": "Property Description:\n\nArrive through the gated entrance along a tree-lined driveway to a recently remodeled custom-built home and turnkey equestrian facility, offering tranquility far removed from the rapid growth of Far North Dallas. Located only 9 miles west of the North Dallas Tollway (Frisco Star and Plano’s Shops of Legacy) and 40-45 minutes north of Downtown Dallas and Fort Worth, this 111-acre equestrian estate is a unique oasis of trees, ponds, and wildlife.\n\nKey Features: Expansive Property:\n\n111 acres with equestrian facilities and easy access to major roads and highways.\n\nEquestrian Facilities: Covered arena, 54 stalls, 15 fenced paddocks, polo field, 4 tack rooms, wash racks, hay barn, and equipment barn.\n\nMain Residence: 6,000 +/- SF home with a large pool/spa.\n\nOffice/Studio: 1,600 +/- SF with a full kitchen and bathroom.\n\nAdditional Amenities: helicopter hangar and helipad, staff housing with 6 apartments.\n\nAccess: Paved road access and gated entries on multiple entrances.\n\nProximity: Close to Lake Lewisville (numerous boat ramps and marinas), restaurants, shops, large and small towns.\n\nProperty History:\n\nPolo History: Lobo Polo & Cattle first created the polo field and barn in the mid 1980s. The property was transformed when William (Bill) Steding built a full polo facility and the house, used as his own, until he sold it in 2016.\n\nThe polo played in North Texas in the late 1980s and 1990s is the type called high-goal — polo played at the highest level and by the best players in the world — with large crowds at the Willow Bend Polo Club in Plano, where The Shops at Willow Bend mall now sits. (The Willow Bend Polo Club is in Little Elm, today.) Steding was one of the major patrons at the time and played high-goal polo at Willow Bend.\n\nMost of the polo players used polo fields and farms in the Cross Roads/Oak Point area, where they kept their horses and trained and bred them. Ken Mayer, of Mayer Ranch Polo, even played a match on Steding’s field in 1993.\n\nKen Mayer/Mayer Ranch Polo acquired the facility from Steding (in 2016) and started further development and expansion of the property, turning it into the premier polo facility in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The United States Polo Association (USPA) has used the indoor arena for several interscholastic and Intercollegiate polo competitions, and is hosting the Texas College Polo Championship in November 2023 there, with plans to do so again in 2024.\n\nMayer Ranch Polo is one of the cornerstones of the DFW Polo Association and Ken Mayer is its current president. By the end of 2023, there will have been 12 USPA tournaments run by this association, with most of the finals being played on the Mayer Ranch polo field.\n\nImprovements:\n\nEquestrian Improvements:\n\nThe gated entrance at 3800 Historic Lane leads to the equestrian facilities, including a covered arena, regulation polo field, 54 stalls between 4 barns, additional storage barns, and staff housing.\n\n15 paddocks with loafing sheds and 80+/- acres of the ranch have an agricultural exemption. The hay fields have been organically managed and chemical free the last 4 years.\n\nThe property is currently home to the SMU polo team and is ideally located for equestrian enthusiasts, near numerous horse farms, trainers, and show venues for all disciplines.\n\nResidential Improvements:\n\nThe gated entrance at 1600 Historic Lane leads along a 900-foot drive through a canopy of trees, past a forest, picturesque pond, and horse pasture to the 6,000-square-foot custom-built home.\n\nThe house features an open floor plan ideal for entertaining with multiple living areas, tall ceilings, and large windows overlooking the grounds, pool, and patio.\n\nThe spacious main suite includes dual bathrooms and closets, a private sitting area, and an office.\n\nAdditional guest bedrooms are located on the first floor, while the second floor features a three-room apartment with a small kitchen, private deck, and separate entrance.\n\nThe lawn and gardens, enclosed by pipe-and-cable fencing, are fully irrigated with cost-effective well water."
