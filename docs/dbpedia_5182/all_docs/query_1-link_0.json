        "text": "County in Texas, US\n\nCounty in Texas\n\nDenton County is located in the U.S. state of Texas. As of the 2020 census, its population was 906,422, making it the seventh-most populous county in Texas.[1] The county seat is Denton.[2] The county, which was named for John B. Denton, was established in 1846. Denton County constitutes part of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. In 2007, it was one of the fastest-growing counties in the United States.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nBefore the arrival of settlers, various Native American peoples, including the Kichai and the Lenape, infrequently populated the area. The area was settled by Peters Colony landowners in the early 1840s. Until the annexation of Texas, the area was considered part of Fannin County. On April 11, 1846, the First Texas Legislature established Denton County. The county was named for John B. Denton, who was killed while raiding a Native American village in Tarrant County in 1841. Originally, the county seat was set at Pinckneyville. This was later changed to Alton, where the Old Alton Bridge currently stands, and then moved finally to Denton.\n\nBy 1860, the population of the county had increased to 5,031. On March 4, 1861, residents of the county narrowly voted for secession from the Union, with 331 votes cast for and 264 against. The Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad reached Lewisville, located in the southern portion of the county, by the early 1880s. The Denton County Courthouse-on-the-Square was built in 1896, and currently houses various government offices, as well as a museum.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 953 square miles (2,470 km2), of which 878 square miles (2,270 km2) are land and 75 square miles (190 km2) (7.8%) are covered by water.[13] Denton County is located in the northern part of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, about 35 miles south of the border between Texas and Oklahoma. It is drained by two forks of the Trinity River.[15] The largest body of water in Denton County is Lewisville Lake, which was formed in 1954 when the Garza–Little Elm Reservoir was merged with Lake Dallas. The county is on the western edge of the eastern Cross Timbers and also encompasses parts of the Grand Prairie portion of the Texas blackland prairies. Portions of Denton County sit atop the Barnett Shale, a geological formation believed to contain large quantities of natural shale gas. Between 1995 and 2007, the number of natural gas wells in the county increased from 156 to 1,820, which has led to some controversy over the pollution associated with hydraulic fracturing.\n\nLakes\n\n[edit]\n\nLewisville Lake\n\nLake Ray Roberts\n\nAdjacent counties\n\n[edit]\n\nCooke County (north)\n\nGrayson County (northeast)\n\nCollin County (east)\n\nDallas County (southeast)\n\nTarrant County (south)\n\nWise County (west)\n\nCommunities\n\n[edit]\n\nCities\n\n[edit]\n\nMultiple counties\n\n[edit]\n\nCarrollton (partly in Dallas County and a small part in Collin County)\n\nCelina (mostly in Collin County)\n\nCoppell (mostly in Dallas County)\n\nDallas (mostly in Dallas County with small parts in Collin, Kaufman, Rockwall and Denton counties)\n\nFort Worth (mostly in Tarrant County with small parts in Johnson, Parker, Wise, and Denton counties)\n\nFrisco (mostly in Collin County)\n\nGrapevine (mostly in Tarrant County and a small part in Dallas and Denton counties)\n\nHaslet (mostly in Tarrant County)\n\nLewisville (small part in Dallas County)\n\nPlano (mostly in Collin County)\n\nSouthlake (mostly in Tarrant County)\n\nDenton County only\n\n[edit]\n\nTowns\n\n[edit]\n\nMultiple counties\n\n[edit]\n\nFlower Mound (small part in Tarrant County)\n\nHebron (small part in Collin County)\n\nProsper (mostly in Collin County)\n\nTrophy Club (small part in Tarrant County)\n\nWestlake (mostly in Tarrant County)\n\nDenton County only\n\n[edit]\n\nCensus-designated places\n\n[edit]\n\nLantana\n\nPaloma Creek\n\nPaloma Creek South\n\nSavannah\n\nUnincorporated communities\n\n[edit]\n\nAlliance (partly in Tarrant County)\n\nBolivar\n\nNavo\n\nGhost towns\n\n[edit]\n\nAlton\n\nCamey Spur\n\nCooper Creek\n\nDrop\n\nElizabethtown\n\nGreen Valley\n\nMarshall Creek\n\nMayhill\n\nMingo\n\nMustang\n\nParvin\n\nPlainview\n\nStony\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 1850641—18605,031684.9%18707,25144.1%188018,143150.2%189021,28917.3%190028,31833.0%191031,25810.4%192035,35513.1%193032,822−7.2%194033,6582.5%195041,36522.9%196047,43214.7%197075,63359.5%1980143,12689.2%1990273,52591.1%2000432,97658.3%2010662,61453.0%2020906,42236.8%2023 (est.)1,007,703[17]11.2%\n\nDenton County, Texas – Racial and ethnic composition\n\nNote: the US Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnic category.

The population density was 754.3 people per square mile (291.2 people/km2). By the 2020 census, its population increased to 906,422,[26] representing continued population growth among suburban communities outside of the principal metropolitan cities of Dallas and Fort Worth. Denton County ranked 29th on the U.S. Census Bureau's list of fastest-growing counties between 2000 and 2007, with a 41.4% increase in population.\n\nIn 2010, the racial makeup of the county was 75% White, 8.4% African American, 0.7% Native American, 6.6% Asian, and 3.0% from two or more races. About 18.2% of the population was Hispanic or Latino of any race. The 2020 census determined the racial and ethnic makeup was 53.58% non-Hispanic white, 10.52% Black or African American, 0.40% Native American, 10.23% Asian, 0.07% Pacific Islander, 0.43% some other race, 4.60% multiracial, and 20.16% Hispanic or Latino American of any race,[26] reflecting state and national demographic trends of greater diversification.[29][30]\n\nA Williams Institute analysis of 2010 census data found about 5.2 same-sex couples per 1,000 households in the county.[31]\n\nGovernment and politics\n\n[edit]\n\nGovernment\n\n[edit]\n\nDenton County, like all counties in Texas, is governed by a commissioner's court, which consists of the county judge (the chairperson of the court), who is elected county-wide, and four commissioners who are elected by the voters in each of four districts.\n\nJustices of the peace are county officials with jurisdiction over landlord/tenant issues, small civil claims, certain misdemeanors involving fines only (no jail time), and other matters.[32]\n\nCounty judge and commissioners\n\n[edit]\n\nOffice Name Party County judge Andy Eads Republican Commissioner, Precinct 1 Ryan Williams Republican Commissioner, Precinct 2 Kevin Falconer Republican Commissioner, Precinct 3 Bobbie Mitchell Republican Commissioner, Precinct 4 Dianne Edmondson Republican\n\nCounty officials\n\n[edit]\n\nOffice Name Party District attorney Paul Johnson Republican County clerk Juli Luke Republican District clerk David Trantham Republican Sheriff Tracy Murphree Republican Tax assessor Michelle French Republican Treasurer Cindy Yeatts Brown Republican\n\nJustices of the peace\n\n[edit]\n\nOffice Name Party Precinct 1 Alan Wheeler Republican Precinct 2 James R. DePiazza Republican Precinct 3 James Kerbow Republican Precinct 4 Harris Hughey Republican Precinct 5 Mike Oglesby Republican Precinct 6 Blanca Oliver Republican\n\nLaw enforcement\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Denton Sheriff's Office employs more than 600 people, for the Denton County Sheriff's Office, most in the Detention Bureau.[33] The office operates a county jail that houses up to 1,400 prisoners. The office is co-located with the jail at 127 North Woodrow Lane in the city of Denton.[34]\n\nAs of 2021, the current sheriff is Tracy Murphree, who was first elected in 2016.[35] That election was particularly contentious, with previous sheriff William B. Travis dogged by scandal,[36] and new candidate Murphree making headlines for threatening violence against transgender people.[37]\n\nPolitics\n\n[edit]\n\nDenton County, like most suburban counties in Texas, is reliably Republican in statewide and national elections, although becoming less so since the 2018 election, when Beto O'Rourke earned 45.52% of the county's votes and two Democrats were elected.[38] The last Democratic presidential candidate to win the county was native Texan Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964,[39] the only time since 1952 that the county has been carried by a Democrat. Denton swung rapidly into the Republican column at the federal level in the 1950s and 1960s as Dallas and Fort Worth's suburbs spilled into the county.\n\nIn 2018, former State Representative Michelle Beckley became the first Democrat elected to the state legislature from Denton County since 1984.[40] Her district at the time, the former 65th, was located entirely within Denton County, and included significant portions of Carrollton, Highland Village and Lewisville. Beckley stepped down from the seat in 2022 to run for Lieutenant Governor, and ultimately it was won back by the Republican nominee.

Many other suburban Texas counties, including its immediate neighbors in Collin County and Tarrant County as well as those around Houston and Austin, showed similar swings since 2016.[citation needed]\n\nUnited States presidential election results for Denton County, Texas[42] Year Republican Democratic Third party No. % No. % No. % 2020 222,480 53.23% 188,695 45.15% 6,789 1.62% 2016 170,603 57.13% 110,890 37.13% 17,152 5.74% 2012 157,579 64.91% 80,978 33.35% 4,224 1.74% 2008 149,935 61.63% 91,160 37.47% 2,168 0.89% 2004 140,891 69.95% 59,346 29.47% 1,173 0.58% 2000 102,171 69.60% 40,144 27.35% 4,475 3.05% 1996 65,313 58.53% 36,138 32.38% 10,145 9.09% 1992 48,492 41.60% 27,891 23.93% 40,193 34.48% 1988 57,444 68.22% 26,204 31.12% 562 0.67% 1984 52,865 75.74% 16,772 24.03% 159 0.23% 1980 29,908 59.93% 17,381 34.83% 2,619 5.25% 1976 20,440 51.50% 18,887 47.58% 365 0.92% 1972 19,138 66.18% 9,720 33.61% 62 0.21% 1968 8,222 43.59% 7,463 39.56% 3,178 16.85% 1964 4,335 32.13% 9,137 67.71% 22 0.16% 1960 5,724 51.48% 5,366 48.26% 29 0.26% 1956 5,350 51.71% 4,972 48.06% 24 0.23% 1952 5,840 52.44% 5,289 47.49% 8 0.07% 1948 1,531 22.02% 4,549 65.42% 873 12.56% 1944 771 10.84% 5,584 78.54% 755 10.62% 1940 899 12.33% 6,386 87.58% 7 0.10% 1936 476 8.62% 5,021 90.91% 26 0.47% 1932 520 9.16% 5,115 90.10% 42 0.74% 1928 2,587 51.89% 2,384 47.81% 15 0.30% 1924 712 12.27% 4,708 81.10% 385 6.63% 1920 900 34.62% 1,257 48.35% 443 17.04% 1916 451 13.03% 2,844 82.15% 167 4.82% 1912 189 7.25% 2,287 87.76% 130 4.99%\n\nDenton County vote by party in Class I Senate elections[43] Year Democratic Republican Other 2018 45.52% 134,649 53.67% 158,744 0.81% 2,409 2012 32.17% 77,314 64.17% 154,208 3,66% 8,805 2006 28.05% 30,198 69.64% 74,977 2.32% 2,495\n\nDenton County vote by party in Class II Senate elections[43] Year Democratic Republican Other 2020 41.38% 170,984 55.91% 231,025 2.71% 11,202 2014 27.68% 39,488 67.68% 96,561 4.65% 6,634 2008 34.31% 81,939 62.97% 150,389 2.73% 6,511 2002 29.07% 11,523 69.88% 27,697 1.04% 413\n\nDenton County vote by party in gubernatorial elections[43] Year Democratic Republican Other 2022 42.92% 136,389 55.70% 177,017 1.37% 4,375 2018 38.65% 113,808 59.25% 174,472 2.10% 6,194 2014 32.80% 47,238 65.05% 93,683 2.15% 3,089 2010 32.84% 43,073 63.84% 83,726 3.31% 4,344 2006 23.18% 25,156 46.90% 50,888 29.91% 32,469 2002 25.73% 10,167 72.34% 28,591 1.92% 763\n\nUnited States Representatives\n\n[edit]\n\nDistrict Name Party Residence 4th Congressional District Pat Fallon Republican Sherman 13th Congressional District Ronny Jackson Republican Amarillo 26th Congressional District Michael C.
