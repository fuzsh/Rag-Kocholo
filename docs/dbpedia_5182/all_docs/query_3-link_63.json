        "text": "Houston, Texas will be immediately welcoming a very affluent new resident as news has now broken that Chevron will be relocating from the bay area of California to Space City, with an expectation that all of the top brass will have moved by the end of this year.\n\nRead: Texas Issues New Warning To Illinois\n\nAlong with news that Texas will be welcoming the 15th largest company (top 10 on the Fortune 500 list just a year ago) in America before the end of the year comes news that all operations and employees must be fully relocated within five years. That likely means some pretty desirable corporate positions will be available in the Bayou City because it is not likely the entire workforce will want to move to the Lone Star State.\n\nAdditionally, having another massive American company now making Houston and Texas their home will only continue to improve the attraction level of top tier talent seeking out Texas as their future home.\n\nTexas, Massive Fortune 500 Company Now Moving Here From California\n\nRight now it is estimated about 2,000 employees are currently working at the soon to be abandoned California headquarters according to this KRON article. I would also imagine the employees that are going to relocate to Texas will do so as quickly as possible to take advantage of our cheaper cost of living, home prices, and zero state income tax.\n\nRead More: 15 Texas Cities With The Most Growth Right Now\n\nIt is not known exactly what the new headquarters' address will be, but Chevron already has about 7,000 employees in the Houston area. They could try to jam in the new offices, or we may see a new campus or skyscraper soon."
