        "text": "Biographical Info\n\nAbout DART\n\nDART is far more than just “the thing you ride.” It is your “trusted guide” to discovering all that North Texas has to offer.\n\nDallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) gets you around Dallas, Texas, and 12 surrounding cities with modern public transit services and customer facilities tailored to make your trip fast, comfortable and economical. Our extensive network of DART Light Rail, Trinity Railway Express commuter rail, bus routes and paratransit services moves more than 220,000 passengers per day across our 700-square-mile service area.\n\nDiscover DARTable Destinations\n\nWith DART you can easily explore North Texas and go someplace you’ve never been. From arts and culture, to sports, recreation, dining, and special events, DART can get you to more places than you can imagine. From hidden gems in every neighborhood to the trendiest spots in town, every trip can be a new adventure. Discover what excitement awaits you at DARTable.DART.org.\n\nNot without your GoPass®\n\nDART’s GoPass app makes discovering everything DARTable a breeze. Whether you are traveling by rail, bus or both, you’ve got a great travel tool literally at your fingertips. You can purchase DART passes on the app, and learn when the next bus or train will arrive or leave from any station. The app also features a trip planner to help you get to your destination, and even offers a section highlighting local events accessible by transit.\n\nYou also can adventure beyond the DART Service Area – a GoPass regional ticket is good on the Trinity Railway Express (TRE) to Fort Worth, Trinity Metro in Fort Worth, and the Denton County Transportation Authority (DCTA) system, which includes the A-train between DART’s Green Line and downtown Denton.\n\nDownload the GoPass app from the App Store or the Google Play store.\n\nEnjoy the best in bus services\n\nDART operates local and express bus routes serving Addison, Carrollton, Cockrell Hill, Dallas, Farmers Branch, Garland, Glenn Heights, Highland Park, Irving, Richardson, Rowlett, Plano and University Park. To get going, use your GoPass app or call DART Customer Information at 214-979-1111 with your origin, destination and desired time of travel. Helpful operators will recommend the most convenient route and departure time, quote the one-way fare, and advise you of any necessary transfers along the way.

Coming from Fort Worth or the Mid-Cities? The TRE is the ticket Monday through Saturday. Visit DART.org/Victory for details.\n\nFly us to DFW Airport or Dallas Love Field\n\nDART Rail connects North Texas commuters to the world via the DFW Airport Station and Inwood/Love Field Station.\n\nTRE passengers traveling from CentrePort/DFW Airport Station to airline terminals board TRE Link buses on the northwest end of the rail station platform. Buses depart the station approximately every 30 minutes weekdays and Saturdays. At DFW Remote South, passengers connect to buses serving either Terminals A, B and C or Terminals D and E.\n\nVisit DART.org/DFWAirport for details.\n\nDART’s Love Link, Bus Route 524, operates between Dallas Love Field and Inwood/Love Field Station, providing a link between DART Rail Green Line and Orange Line and Love Field terminal. Visit DART.org/LoveField for details.\n\nExperience exciting Fort Worth via the TRE\n\nDowntown Fort Worth is about an hour’s ride from Union Station in downtown Dallas via the TRE. Business commuters love the convenience – and if you’re looking for a Saturday adventure. From Fort Worth’s Central Station or T&P Station, it’s a short ride on Trinity Metro’s buses to the bustling Sundance Square dining and entertainment district in the heart of the city, the historic Fort Worth Stockyards Old West district, or the famed museums in the city’s Cultural District. TRE information is available at http://www.TrinityRailwayExpress.org.\n\nSave big with our low fares\n\nDART offers a basic fare — $3.00 Local for an AM or PM pass good for travel on all DART buses and trains (including GoLink and FLEX service) and Trinity Railway Express trains between Union Station and CentrePort/DFW Airport Station.\n\nA midday pass — $2.00 for Local — is also available and allows unlimited travel between 9:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. seven days a week.\n\nFor those passengers using DART round trip, needing a regional fare or for trips that go past noon, a day pass — $6.00 for Local and $12.00 for Regional — is recommended. Day passes are good for unlimited rides (including your return trip) until 3 a.m. the next day.\n\nMoney-saving passes are available.
