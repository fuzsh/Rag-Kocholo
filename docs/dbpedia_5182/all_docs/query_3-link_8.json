        "text": "Written by: Tim Ballard, Museum Education Assistant\n\nFlower Mound is a beautiful member of our county. Many parts are upper class and artistic in appearance and lifestyle, with large brick homes, specialty stores, and social centers. It’s also home to more than a few historical locations such as the Bethel School Site and the landmark Presbyterian Church that has existed since before the Civil War. We’ve talked about these locations in detail before, but one peculiar and surprisingly glossed-over historic detail of Flower Mound is where the town got its namesake and the effort that is put into maintaining this landmark still today.\n\nIt was near an actual large Flower-covered hill that the town began to spring up around during the 19th century. Historian A.C. Green believed in the mid-20th century that the hill and subsequent town were named so because of the unusual abundance of wildflowers that grew naturally atop it due to the hill being a part of prairie land that was neither kept nor groomed, allowing for life to flourish even as cattlemen and settlers trailed through and established in the area in 1840. This area was part of the great American Black Land Prairie that ran from Canada to the Rio Grande and from the Rockies to the Mississippi. Only 1,000 acres remain of the original 20 million known as the Tall Grass Prairie, according to The Town of Flower Mound’s government. The spot in which the Flower Mound itself is located was also part of a sacred worshipping site to a confederation of Southern Plains Native American tribes, the Kitikiti’sh or “Wichita Tribes”, making it’s natural preservation even more important in modern times.\n\nWhile this piece of land might be unassuming at first glance, it is a distinguishable location that stands a full fifty feet above ground level and is an ecosystem of over 175 species of wildflowers, condensed into a beautiful array of colors and environmental influencers that reach far beyond the hill they sit atop. This means that The Flower Mound is not just a pretty spot in nature, but also an impactful part of wildlife for bees, pollinators, and field dwelling life that has made it their home, and needs protection for both its environmental and historical significance. There are also a variety of informational panels and non-intrusive attractions along small trails at The Flower Mound to inform visiting guests on the flora and fauna of the region.\n\nThe protection of the land falls to the Flower Mound Foundation, which was founded in 1983 and was granted just over 12 acres of land around the original mound site. It is governed by 9 trustees who are obligated to look after the upkeep and preservation of both the history and ecological information surrounding the site and to encourage visitors and residents to become involved in the story and scientific contribution the protected land can contribute to Denton County and the township.\n\nVisitors are welcome to view this attraction and learn more about its local history and how they can contribute to its preservation through the Flower Mounds website or The Flower Mound Foundation homepage, but we at the Denton County Office of History and Culture encourage any environmental historians and nature lovers to not pass up a chance to check out this hill that begot the start of its town.\n\nPictures and information from Flower Mound and the Flower Mound Foundation: https://www.flowermound.gov/\n\nPortal to Texas History, Channel 5 Broadcast about The Flower Mound Foundation in 1986: https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1159699/m1/?q=The%20Flower%20Mound\n\nPhotos sourced from the Texas Indians Informational Site: http://www.texasindians.com/wichita.htm\n\nPhotos Sourced from Native American Seed site: https://seedsource.com/the-flower-mound/\n\nWritten by: Tim Ballard, Museum Education Assistant\n\nIf you leave Denton and head towards Sherman, one of the most direct routes to get there is to head up Highway 377. As you get closer to the county line, you’ll skirt along the edge of what can only be described as how idealistic small-town Texas might look in a Hollywood movie. Pilot Point, with just shy of 5,000 people in 2022, is a very short distance from Lake Ray Roberts and boasts several colorful attractions despite its size. We’ve covered some of the historical highlights within Pilot Point before, but the history of the town itself begs to tell its story about how a small town makes its mark.\n\nPilot Point found its beginning in 1853, about 8 years before the start of the American Civil War. Before the creation of official town plans, settlers had established many frontier professions in hunters, cattle ranchers, and waggoneers who traversed the area across the Shoenee trail that ran through it. This is also how the town got its name. Before its founding in 1853, the wagon supply trains traversing the trail would use marked hills as high points for the wagon train pilots to climb up and plan how to move forward, thus conceptualizing the idea of a “Pilot’s Point”. By the end of the 19th century, Pilot Point had established over 1000 residents, making it a large and well-visited spot on the trail map for Denton County.\n\nThe town has slowly grown over the 20th century as well, and between deep community ties and higher than average quality of life for many families living in Pilot Point, it has become a popular and populated member of the county. The plethora of culture and history within its limits doesn’t hurt its popularity and character either. Pilot Point has become a popular spot for capturing small-town southern life in the movies, and has had its fair share of adventures, misadventures, and iconic happenings littering its well-preserved historical structures.\n\nIt started as a 27-building plat in historic downtown Pilot Point, which has a fantastic walking tour that identifies the stories behind the original structures. This includes Main Street, Jefferson, Washington, and Liberty building sites, each of which contain their own rich, and sometimes strange history. Although this little haven of culture is tucked away from the hustle and bustle around Denton, it’s worth checking out for the rich history and Texas spirit.\n\nSources:\n\nVisit Pilot Point: https://visitpilotpoint.org/pilot-point-downtown-historic-walking-tour/\n\nPilot Point Page: https://www.pilotpointtx.gov/217/About\n\nDenton County History: https://www.dentoncounty.gov/352/Denton-County-History\n\nPhots Courtesy of:\n\nDevelop Pilot Point: https://developpilotpoint.com/facts/\n\nPortal To Texas History: https://texashistory.unt.edu/\n\nDenton County Office of History and Culture Collections\n\nWritten by: Tim Ballard, Museum Education Assistant\n\nThe Cold War embodies a period in American history unique from almost every other political conflict we have faced since the founding of our nation in 1776. Most of America’s wars have been fought far away from where we live our daily lives as civilians. Even during the Civil War, the War for Independence, the War for 1812, and so forth, the battles on American soil were conventionally foreseeable, with destruction and loss being localized and people being able to escape the fear and threat in the chaos of war. Not the Cold War though. Never before in the history of the world had Americans, or mankind faced the potential for such sudden and world-shattering destruction. With the “Red Scare” and tensions with the Soviet Union and United States built to a breaking point, fueled by Communist Regime Incursions and US intervention from the Iron Curtain Push to the Cuban Missile Crisis, nuclear war seemed like a genuine threat in America for the first time. It threatened people’s lives, affected how they went about their days, and was, well… Terrifying.\n\nTexas, specifically our neck of the woods in North Texas, also saw this threat and began to contribute to the preparations to defend against nuclear annihilation. Denton County boasts many properties that house old fallout shelters and private disaster bunkers, which are still useful today if such an event occurs, but more often are used as tornado or emergency shelters in weather disaster events.\n\nNear where Loop 288 meets US 380 sits one of the largest Cold War-era nuclear bunkers in the United States. During the late 20th century it was a Nuclear Civil Defense Headquarters. Nowadays, we drive by it and see the big Region Six FEMA Headquarters sign in front of it. What better way to repurpose a facility meant to manage a USSR nuclear strike than to make it one of the main hubs for the Federal Emergency Management Agency? I’m sure we all have some ideas, but they both served the same purpose: to protect lives in North Texas.\n\nThis bunker was originally built in 1964, complete with air scrubbers and ventilation, blast doors, and two deeply fortified underground floors to survive a one-megaton nuclear blast and protect civil defense workers so that they might be able to respond to the crisis after a nuclear attack. Its electrical and plumbing systems were shock-mounted to prevent damage, and it was lined with thick-coated walls to protect from radioactive fallout.\n\nIn a news interview with KSAT in 2018, Earl Armstrong who was the Public Information Representative for FEMA stated, “The facility came about because in the 1950s, the Eisenhower administration realized that we needed a place for federal employees to seek shelter from a nuclear attack and this was one of five facilities outside of the Washington D.C., area. It had to be a certain distance away from a major metropolitan area and it had to be close to a Nike missile battery, and at the time, there was one just about three or four miles from here.”\n\nWhat kind of workers were housed and would be sheltered here in the event of a nuclear attack? It’s not too dissimilar to what FEMA is composed of today, including first responders, rescue and infrastructural workers, and members of government that will help to manage crises when the normal governmental offices and procedures are unavailable. In 1971, Ft. Worth’s Television Station WBAP even did a segment on it stating it would house 90 workers that would organize and support efforts following an attack, some of whom took shifts living on-site.\n\nMost of the nuclear defense functions have been replaced to meet the needs of FEMA and their response equipment, meaning that much of the facility is now modernized to meet modern needs. Still, looking at the facility’s thick walls and utilitarian features is a stark reminder of the anxieties that Cold War Dentonites had about life as we know it changing forever in a single bright flash of light.\n\nPhotographs Courtesy of:\n\nThe Portal To Texas History: https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth12430/\n\nCivil Defense Museum: http://www.civildefensemuseum.com/denton/index.html\n\nDuck and Cover Drill Photos: https://study.com/academy/lesson/duck-cover-history-strategies-drills.html\n\nInformational Sources:\n\nKSAT FEMA District 6 Headquarters Interview: https://www.ksat.com/news/2018/05/03/cold-war-era-underground-government-facility-in-denton-built-to-survive-nuclear-attack/\n\nTexas Historical Commission Cold War Information: https://thc.texas.gov/learn/military-history/texas-cold-war\n\nCivil Defense Museum Bunker Information: http://www.civildefensemuseum.com/denton/index.html\n\nPortal To Texas History 1971 News Broadcast: https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1430860/?q=Denton%20Civil%20Defense\n\nUNT Library Database: https://library.unt.edu/\n\nWritten by: Tim Ballard, Museum Education Assistant\n\nThe Courthouse-On-The-Square stands tall and majestic… except the courthouse isn’t there. There is no sidewalk beneath your feet, no streets for cars, or even dirt roads for horses. The famous landmark buildings on the square like the Old Opera House or North Central Texas College flat haven’t been built yet. You are the first human in the planet’s history to stand in this spot, and you won’t belong here for millions more years. You’re surrounded by dense towering conifer trees and other flowering plants known as angiosperms. The ground is moist and the air is so thick with oxygen that your lungs struggle to take it in. You might even be knee or waist-deep in murky swamp waters, and the noise of bugs and small burrowing creatures buzz and rustle beneath high ferns and brush. Then, all at once the noises stop, and you feel and hear the earth beneath your feet rumble. You turn around to find yourself face-to-face with an Acrocanthosaurus, looming above you with a high ridged spine and razor-sharp teeth designed for rending its meaty food, almost as large as a Tyrannosaurus Rex and just as mean. He opens up his massive jaws and lets out a mighty and terrifying roar…\n\nStarting in the Cretaceous period, Texas began to accumulate and boast a variety of interesting sea-based fossil records left behind from its history of being mostly submerged, but it also had its time as swampy forests and fields. In North Texas, especially around counties like Tarrant and Somervell, all the way to Denton County, we host a ranged variety of land and sea fossils. Glen Rose, a short way south of Fort Worth, is the “Dinosaur City of Texas”. With such a diverse collection of ancient paleontological history near and within our county, dinosaur lovers are truly spoiled by our fossil collections.\n\nDenton County has been part of some great discoveries too. In an article from the Dallas Morning News, “In 2020, a small fossil of a jawbone was discovered at a rock formation near Lake Grapevine, where paleontologists with the (Perot) museum have been collecting fossils for years. Initially, scientists thought the 2-inch long jaw fossil belonged to a small crocodile, but they soon discovered they were wrong”. This discovery would be known as one of the tiniest dinosaurs ever discovered with a jaw just 2 inches long, uncovered by a paleontologist named Ron Tykoski and excavation volunteer Murray Cohen, and named after Cohen as the “Ampelognathus coheni, roughly translating to Cohen’s Grapevine jaw”.\n\nA rare fossil find was made in the backyard of Paul Jones and his daughter Maggie’s Aubrey home in 2012. The fossil was that of a prehistoric fish from over 100 million years ago, whom Maggie nicknamed “Bobby”. This fossil was later put on exhibit at the University of North Texas where it can be seen today. Similarly, a series of aquatic discoveries near Razor Ranch were made in the form of ancient ammonite skeletal shells from the Cretaceous Grayson Marl Formation. Formations are defined as layers of rock used to separate periods of time and varieties of sediment that covered fossils, allowing researchers to better record and understand when and where they came from. Denton County has several formations stretching through its city limits and across its county lines and boasts several discoveries of aquatic, botanic, and zoological nature.\n\nDenton has had its share of discoveries as well. Denton has a robust scientific and historical research community from alumni and students out of our two renowned universities, as well as transplants who have taken an interest in discovering what Denton’s past has to offer. We’ve held quite a few educational programs to encourage those who are curious about the time immemorable to do a little digging themselves. There have been exhibits from area paleontological educators like Beau McDaniel, who use their knowledge of displaying local discoveries as proof that there is always more to learn about the past.\n\nSo what exactly is the big picture of how life looked in a prehistoric Denton? That’s a big question that stretches over a span of tens of millions of years, and even further if you keep digging. 100 million years of life is hard to grasp. If you break it down, modern humans have been around based on fossil and historical records for between 30,000 and 60,000 years. If you tried to fit that into the scale of 100,000,000 years, you’re looking at the entirety of modern human existence about 1600 times over. That’s Massive! In 100 million years, the landscape and wildlife can change dramatically, and so Denton County was entirely immersed by the ocean at one point and was home to a range of strange sea creatures. It was also home to a variety of hadrosaurid, duck-billed, and web-footed dinosaurs as the oceans receded giving way to rains and wetlands that were prime for these water-dinos. Trees sprang up through the wetlands, and drank the rain waters as well as nourished new forms of life. Many of the land features made by the ocean and massive water currents were much more apparent, and North Texas canyons and hills started to define themselves as the tectonic plates shifted. Mass extinction, weather phenomena, and adaptation of plants and wildlife also redefined much of the Texas landscape into the modern plains, lakes, rivers, and forests that we see today, however if you know where to look, you can still see the little stories left behind in the land of what North Texas and our home in Denton County looked like throughout 100 million years of change, struggle, and growth.\n\nGrayson Marl Photos and Information: https://www.txfossils.com/nautiloids-denton-county\n\nDenton County Family Discovers Rare Fossil, Sara Story, 2012: https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/denton-county-family-discovers-rare-fossil\n\nNew ‘little bitty’ dinosaur discovered in North Texas near Grapevine rock formation, Noor Aditia, 2023: https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2023/10/27/new-little-bitty-dinosaur-discovered-in-north-texas-near-grapevine-rock-formation/\n\nGlen Rose and Acrocanthosaurus Information: https://authentictexas.com/the-history-of-the-dinosaurs-of-glen-rose\n\nNorth Texas Prehistoric Land Information: https://www.dallaspaleo.org/Surfac\n\nInformation on Beau McDaniel: https://www.dinobodfw.com/about/\n\nHadrosaurid and Flora Information: https://www.britannica.com/animal/hadrosaur\n\nUniversity of North Texas Exhibit and Information: https://digital.library.unt.edu/\n\nWritten By: Tim Ballard, Museum Education Assistant\n\nThere’s a verse in the opening of the song “Sultans of Swing” by 1970’s and 80’s Rock Band Dire Straights, “You get a shiver in the dark, It’s a raining in the park but meantime-; South of the river you stop and you hold everything; A band is blowing Dixie, double four time; You feel alright when you hear the music ring”.\n\nThis verse, and this song, does a good job of telling a story about where music finds it’s home. Local bands and the sound of music playing in the distance, these are likely things that bring up memories for anyone who has walked around the square in downtown Denton or on one of our university campuses. A person could walk past a busker at the Courthouse-On-The-Square lawn, or any one of the bars surrounding it and hear a live band or loud jukebox playing local favorites and big band covers alike. It’s been this way in Denton for more than 100 years.\n\nA good jam isn’t uncommon in a college town but Music is a specialty of Denton, with it’s melodic history rooted all the way back to the early 20th century with a Music Professor from North Texas State College named Floyd ‘The Fessor’ Graham and his stage band, the Aces of Collegeland, who wanted to share music with the community, ultimately helping to open the door of opportunity for local bands and aspiring musicians to take part in sharing their sound. Over the decades, Denton has established itself in many ways as a posterchild for great music. University of North Texas claims, “The College of Music is the largest public university music program in the United States and is one of the most globally respected”. Denton is also a storied home of the jazz scene and where many famous bands such as the Eli Young band, Bowling For Soup, and Midlake found their footing. World-renowned names such as Pat Boone and Roy Orbison, who both attended the University of North Texas, also had a voice here. Even many of Denton’s themes revolve around it’s music culture and history, as it embraces its local talent.\n\nOne way our city recognizes and carries on it’s musical heritage is through Denton’s “Make Music” Day, which is held on June 21st. Most days, and especially on weekends in Denton, its easy to find where the rhythm is happening in town, but on “Make Music” Day, both local singers and big names have made an appearance to celebrate one of the specialties Denton is known best for in the form of live music and fun. Last year in 2023, we were also able to celebrate the music by way of our “Making a Scene” exhibit at the Denton County Courthouse-On-The-Square Museum. We had a small concert within the exhibit and were able to showcase decades of Denton talent and vintage examples of school and professional bands from around the county.\n\nThis year, we encourage you to visit the Denton Square and check out what’s going on with the live music scene.

I had recently heard from a North Texas native that this series of storms was one of the worst they had ever experienced, with trees ripped clean out of the ground, tornados tearing through parts of the county, and so much rainwater that Denton County no doubt will have a few new lakes. I can also remember some massive weather anomalies in North Texas over the last several years, from long summer droughts that put us on a water ration, to the big freeze we had back in 2021 that shut down much of the county’s power and water. Being on the edge of Oklahoma and Tornado Alley, I’m proud to say that we Denton County folk and our North Texas kin are no strangers to weathering out the worst of storms.\n\nWe’ve seen some rough ones over the years, but all this weather had me curious: What was the worst storm in Denton County’s known history? We did some research here at the Denton County Office of History and Culture and it turns out that you could write a book on the number of weather anomalies… and catastrophes we’ve endured. Here are a few that are of note.\n\nOne of the earliest reliable records was detailed in the Denton County News on June 8th, 1892. On a dark night in early June, small rural farming communities and towns of 19th-century Denton County were assailed by gale-force winds, tornados, and a deluge of rain that had never before been recorded. The storm lasted days, unrelenting and disastrous as houses were ripped from their foundations, massive pecan and oak trees were snapped like twigs, and worse, one resident, Gutherie O.T., and eye-witness, reported to Denton County News, “Hail the size of hen’s eggs broke windows, destroyed fields, and killed livestock. The town of Carney was almost completely wiped out, the houses were all small frame structures…”. Miraculously nobody was killed, although there were a few serious injuries from debris and collapsing structures.\n\nThe end of the 1800s and the beginning of the 1900s were marked throughout with a multitude of storms ranging from mild to severe, including a few exceptionally rough ones in the late 1920s. It was 1946 however when the Denton Record-Chronicle and associated press reviewed the damage of one of the most massive Texas storms of the century. From Sanger to Flower Mound, rain pelted those unlucky enough to be caught outside so hard that it left welts and flooded low-grade sections of land putting small structures completely underwater, carrying away vehicles and buildings with it. A tornado moved north to south starting in Sanger, and at the climax of it all, hail the size of grapefruit fell from the sky. Unlike the storm of 1892, this one unfortunately had a high casualty count from many of the above damages, illustrating just how dangerous it can be when there’s nowhere to find sturdy shelter.\n\nOn the subject of costly storms, at the beginning of the 21st century, many people thought that in 2012, the Mayan long calendar coming to an end heralded the end of the world, creating a terrifying phenomenon worldwide. Fortunately, the world didn’t end, but we did have some apocalyptic weather in North Texas of a record-breaking magnitude that dismantled parts of Denton County and the Dallas-Ft. Worth area. The Moore Law Firm, which specializes in weather-related insurance reported, “Four supercells produced a record-setting hail event and one tornado across parts of North Texas. Two of the four supercells tracked through Dallas County causing over (at the time) $890 million in hail damage. The hail in Dallas County ranged in size up to 3 in diameter. In many areas, the hail lasted for at least 30 minutes. Tens of thousands of cars were damaged by the hail, windows were shattered, roofs were damaged, and trees were shredded of their leaves”. Denton County was no exception, with several injuries reported and infrastructural buildings damaged, it was a storm that not only left its mark on history but one that people are still recovering from today.\n\nWe are always encouraging people to remember and be excited about being a part of history in the making because one day someone might look back and read about our current events and wonder what it must have been like. In the case of the notorious and hazardous North Texas weather we experience here in historic Denton County, however, I think we can all agree that part of history is one we would sit out on!\n\n19th and 20th century information and pictures courtesy of “The Portal To Texas History” Newspaper Archives by University of North Texas. 21st Century Insurance Article Information courtesy of Moore Law-Firm.\n\nhttps://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth502577/m1/1/zoom/?q=Denton%20County%20storm&resolution=1.5&lat=3242.0829925542216&lon=918.137315211858\n\nhttps://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth1335957/m1/1/zoom/?q=Denton%20County%20Record%20storm&resolution=2&lat=1461.296027199951&lon=3177.279655174263\n\nhttps://moore-firm.com/blog/top-10-worst-hailstorms-in-texas-history/\n\nWritten by: Tim Ballard, Museum Education Assistant\n\nLiving in Texas, we’ve all seen them. Maybe you’ve been driving through the countryside past the vast and beautiful fields that sweep through the rural parts of Denton County and other parts of North Texas. You’ll see a state-of-the-art harvesting combine churning away during the harvest, or you might see an old rusty tractor or steel plow that has turned into a field ornament and hasn’t moved from its spot in fifty years. Maybe you’re lucky and spent enough time on a farm to see one of these old tractors in action, or if nothing else, used to take your kids for a fun afternoon joyride and make some memories.\n\nThe Denton County Antique Tractor, Farm Equipment, and Primitive Club embraces the love of new and old tractors as well, and that even extends to the variety of farm tools from the past and present that make the fields you drive past possible today. Each year, they showcase their collection made up of fascinating and functional farm equipment to the public at parades and expos and bring more than just farming novelties to the show. They also demonstrate the technological evolution of farming that made modern agriculture possible.\n\nTommy Calvert, a member and collector of the club, was kind enough to answer some questions about what the Denton County Antique Tractor Club gets up to and how they are involved with the community.\n\nWhen asked what the club’s main function was, Tommy gave insight by stating “We hope to make everyone, adults and children, aware of our heritage of farm equipment from several decades. We try to have displays of our tractors and other farm equipment to show the importance of the equipment to their lives on the farm.”\n\nTommy went on to say that the club was started in 2008, doing shows in Texas and Oklahoma, as well as parades and activities such as tractor rides and demonstrations with hit-and-miss engines for antique tractors.\n\nNot everyone gets a chance to get up close and see this equipment in action, especially functional antique and vintage styles. So those demonstrations and displays give communities a chance to see and be educated on something they would otherwise not have access to.\n\nFor a fun final question in our Q&A, I asked Tommy which tractor was his favorite, and he told me “We have fun with each other about which tractor is the best. John Deere, International, Ford, Allis Chalmers, Ferguson, or Oliver. But we think they are all the best because of the importance they have served in agriculture and are still serving today!”\n\nWe get to have a close-up look at some of these machines and hear a bit about their stories, but let’s take a closer look at the history behind how we went from using beasts of burden like mules and horses to pull plows, to using churning engines of metal, steam, and smoke that allowed farmers to cultivate and harvest at speeds unheard of in their time.\n\nAlthough the steam engine had been mechanizing everything from trains to farming equipment for over one hundred years already, there hadn’t been a true “tractor” seen in the field yet, at least not as a mainstream and standard form of machine-powered labor. Many farmers still opted for plow horse teams and other analog and manual means of managing their fields, and the ones that had mechanical means to do so were often wealthier and rarer to come by.\n\nIn 1892, in a small village in Northeast Iowa, the age of true tractors began. John Froelich (1849-1933), troubled by the bulkiness and shortcomings of steam engines, developed the first tractor design that was significantly smaller and gasoline-powered. He and his crew built it and mounted it on the old running gear for his steam engine, and that fall they threshed a massive 72,000 bushels of small grain!\n\nAlthough this success was enough for John to launch a company called the Waterloo Gasoline Engine Company, it wasn’t until the start of World War I when the need for mass cultivation from farms caused an even greater need for a new and improved kind of cultivating tool, and new models of the companies tractor began to be produced at a rapid rate. In 1918, John Deere purchased the Waterloo Company and in the following decades, we saw various upgrades and implementations to modernize the original design, although many of the original principles of tractor design are still used today by a variety of tractor equipment manufacturing companies.\n\nHistory has a way of showing us how resource necessity fuels industrialization, in this case, literally. We can still see many of these remains in the form of rusted hulks abandoned deep in the woods, resting on the edge of a family farm’s land, or even in museums and on display like the ones featured above. One day, people might look back at the tractors we use today and wonder what they must have been like in their heyday.\n\nThe Denton County Antique Tractor, Farm Equipment, and Primitive Club will be joining us on Saturday, June 8, 2024 for the annual Farm Heritage Day at the Denton County Historical Park. This is a fun opportunity to see some of these old steel workhorses and other great examples of North Texas farming cultural heritage that played a big impact in the growth of our state!\n\nPhotos credited to the Denton County Antique Tractor, Farm Equipment, and Primitive Club, as well as the Froelich Tractor Museum, Pexel, and the Denton County Office of History and Culture.\n\nhttps://www.froelichtractor.com/the-tractor.html\n\nhttp://texasplowboys.com/\n\nhttps://www.dentoncounty.gov/289/History-Culture\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/technology/steam-engine\n\nWritten by: Tim Ballard\n\nNorth Texas is known for a lot of things, from its ever-expanding technology industry to its converging cultural hubs. Some of these aspects are new and others have been around for a while. That being said, one theme that Texas seems to conjure in the minds of people worldwide is its legacy to the old southwest and the image of the cattle-driving, ten-gallon hat-wearing cowboys that roamed it.\n\nA man named Alan L. Powdermaker brought his family to North Texas to breathe life into that idea of a southwestern experience at a venue that catered to a variety of gatherings. They started small, with their first event housing only 28 guests on September 20th, 1973, and with that the Circle R Ranch and their motto “We promise a lot, we give more” grew into the event center that it is today, hosting more than 100,000 guests a year. Being in Flower Mound and part of our own Denton County, it has also been the host for the annual County Picnic, complete with great food, adventurous activities, and fun games for the whole family. As it has grown, it has become host to weddings, conventions, corporate events, and parties for local community members and visitors near and far.\n\nEnjoying the Denton County Picnic at Circle R Ranch, 2023\n\nAlthough it was started by Mr. Powdermaker and his family, the success of Circle R Ranch has been a team effort over the decades. It has been managed by husband-and-wife team Steven and Wendy Foster, and later built upon by Jason and Hillary Roberts who founded Genuine Texas Hospitality, LLC to manage the enormous community involvement of Circle R Ranch.\n\nThis year, the ranch will be celebrating 51 years of bringing friends, families, and colleagues in the community together, having earned recognition by Denton County as a Heritage Business for over 50 years of service and impact as of 2024. When a business is recognized for this, they become part of the Denton County Heritage Business Program, receiving recognition by the Denton County Commissioners Court for their impact and significance in the contribution and presence they have had in Denton County over a period of 50 years or more.\n\nSince May is National Historic Preservation Month and they are one of our newest additions to be recognized as a Denton County Heritage Business, we would like to extend our congratulations and appreciation to Circle R Ranch during this time of historical recognition for catering to the community in such an upstanding and long-serving capacity.\n\nPictures of the County Picnic are courtesy of Denton County.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.circlerranch.org/about-us\n\nhttps://www.dentoncounty.gov/289/History-Culture\n\nWritten by: Joy Siler\n\nThough the city of Denton may not be in the direct path of totality for the solar eclipse occurring on April 8th, 2024, much of the southern portion of the greater county will be able to experience the full shadow. (Please be cautionary and observe with the proper recommended eye protection when doing so!) Other total solar eclipses have passed over the U.S. in recent times, but this year is the first since 1878 that the path will cross over a large portion of the Texas heartland.\n\nA Party in the West\n\nTo observe this phenomenon in 1878, several astronomers from across the country traveled to Texas and congregated at the S.W. Lomax Farm outside of Fort Worth. The following gentlemen made the trek out in the summer of 1878 to record their findings: Mr. Leonard Waldo, of Harvard College Observatory; Mr. R. W. Willson, of Harvard College.; Professor J. K. Rees, of Washington University, St Louis; Mr. W. H. Pulsifer, of St Louis; and Mr. F. E. Seagrave, of Providence, R.I. According to an original copy of the Report of the Observations of the Total Solar Eclipse July 29, 1878, Made at Fort Worth, Texas that was written later and held by the Texas State Library and Archives Commission, this group of five astronomers formed the “Fort Worth Eclipse Party.” They set up their telescopes and photography plates so that they might capture images and observations to “aid in establishing the correct theory regarding the corona which is seen surrounding the sun during the moments of a total solar eclipse.”\n\nReporting In\n\nLater observations about the eclipse event were collected from several Texas cities and towns and sent in to the Galveston News by telegram. A report from the scientists in Fort Worth about their successful endeavor was quoted as saying that “the party feel highly pleased with their efforts and consider some of the observations taken of great scientific value.” They went on to mention some of the other observed phenomena and describe the moment that the area went dark.\n\n“The darkness was not so great as to prevent reading, but objects 200 yards off could not be distinguished easily. Fowls roosted on the ground where they were feeding when the darkness came on rapidly. At the moment of totality continued shouts went up in town a mile off from Mr. Lomax’s, the place of observation. The totality lasted a period of two minutes and forty-two seconds…The scene during the observation was one that would remind an old veteran of a decisive moment in battle, when all are trained to duty at respective posts. Between the time of the first and last contact no noise or word was heard, save the slow measured dictates of the observers to their recorders. Lightning in the south during totality added to the grand scene of an event which goes into scientific history.”\n\n—How the Scientists Scooped Ol Sol in Pantherville, Things Over the State, Galveston News on July 30, 1878\n\nTexans Experience the Eclipse\n\nIn the same edition of the Galveston News, many other cities and small towns shared their views of the moments surrounding the moon’s obscuring of the sun. At this time, one of the safer methods for being able to watch the full event included using “smoked glass” which was created by the dark soot and smoke residue from the burn-off of a flame. Another method was to use green glass or goggles which reduce the full glare of sunlight and still maintain a high level of color contrast.\n\nCorsicana— “A rather unsatisfactory observation of the eclipse was obtained here today, owing to a heavy rain storm…The most remarkable phenomenon that was seen during the eclipse was the red flames, so much spoken of by astronomers, which appeared on the southwest limb of the sun, occupying about 60 degrees of the arc; and immediately preceding its reappearance the corona was very indistinct, but manifested its peculiar irregular shape, and was altogether too undefined to admit of proper sketches being made of it, which was so desired. The rough and rugged outlines of the moon’s surface was plainly discernible just before the disappearance from view of the sun.”\n\nWaco— “Large crowds were out with their smoked glass and green goggles. The weather was beautiful.”\n\nBrenham–“Stars were visible. Chickens went to roost. A large cloud obscured the view for several minutes; an old [man] quit work, believing it was sunset. Smoked glass was to be seen everywhere.”\n\nSan Antonio–“The eclipse passed off quietly. The moon was first noticed on the northern edge of the sun at 9 minutes past 3. The whole show was over at 15 minutes past 4. No corona was visible, owing to clouds. The thermometer fell 5 degrees. About nine-tenths of the surface of the sun was obscured. A remarkable appearance was presented be a large cloud near the sun, which assumed all the colors of the rainbow, resembling mother of pearl.”\n\nAllen–“The scene was most magnificent. The duration of totality here was 1 m. 45s.”\n\nAustin–“The eclipse here was nearly total.”\n\nHouston–“In this city smoked glass was in the hands of nearly every one to-day. At 4:21 only a small half circle could be seen, and shadows almost disappeared; at 4:30 a black cloud obscured both orbs, and lamps were lighted for a few moments. When the darkness was greatest a star was shining brightly in the east, and many expressed the belief that a cloud obscured a sight of the sun completely eclipsed.”\n\nBrownsville–“The smoked-glass brigade was out in the force to-day to observe the eclipse.”\n\nOrange–“The eclipse at this place was truly grand and beautiful; during the first part the sun was occasionally obscured by clouds, but 5 minutes before it became total the clouds moved away and the sun was in a clear, blue sky, and while the eclipse was total the sight was magnificent. Stars were plainly visible and a most beautiful twilight covered the earth at this place.”\n\nDallas–“The grandeur of the eclipse as a spectacle is indescribable. It began in the western edge of the sun at 4h. 33m. 6 5 10. The moon gradually ate into the sun toward the east until 5h. 38m. 32 3-10s., when the line of totality was reached. The obscuration lasted until 5h. 40m. 57 9-10s. During the totality the moon’s disc was surrounded by a halo, sending out circular rays of light in every direction. The corona consisted of some 20 smooth but well defined prominences of various heights, shading off by gradation until 6 40.25 6-10, when the external line of contact was reached. Several of the brighter stars and planets were visible, but no planetoid or group of planetoids was visible between Mercury and the sun. Prof. D. P. Todd, of the naval observatory at Washington, took observations at this point, and made a thorough but fruitless search for an intra-Mercurial planet. The observations were generally successful, although the skies were somewhat clouded to the end.”\n\nDayton–“At 4:10 it began to appear as though the sun was about half an hour high. It gradually became darker till 4:26, when the sun was in total eclipse, which lasted four or five minutes. A person could not see to read a newspaper inside of a house. A cloud covered the sun from our view at 27 minutes past 4, consequently it was darker than it was expected it would be. Stars were plainly seen; lightning bugs were visible. Cows started home. Chickens gathered around their favorite roosting places, and from appearances it looked as though we were going to have an extra night.”\n\nMarlin–“The total eclipse commenced at 18 minutes past 4 o’clock. It could be seen penetrating the lower right side of the sun at half-past 3. Many were surprised and some really frightened…[Others] thought judgment was at hand.”\n\nAs you all go out to see the eclipse, make your own historic observations and connect with Texans that witnessed a similar event over 146 years ago!\n\nSources:\n\n“Things Over the State”.
