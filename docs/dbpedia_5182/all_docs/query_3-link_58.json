        "text": "Denton, Dallas’s way more relaxed cousin to the North, is the home of the University of North Texas, Texas Women’s University, and an awful lot of quality restaurants. Some of them are spots for broke college students and others are more suited to the alumni and parents who’ve settled in little D. You don’t have to leave town to find upscale cuisine or just a great burger.\n\nAhead are some of the best places in town, whichever end of the spectrum one falls on.\n\nRead More\n\nEater maps are curated by editors and aim to reflect a diversity of neighborhoods, cuisines, and prices. Learn more about our editorial process. If you buy something or book a reservation from an Eater link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics policy.\n\nAny hankerings for pad thai or noodle soup in town can be satiated at Thai Ocha. It’s yellow curry and tom kha soup earn raves, as do the Thai dumplings made with ground pork and shrimp. It is BYOB, so grab a bottle of wine and go.\n\nThis family-owned Italian restaurant, which is inside a remodeled home, serves house-made food, including it’s freshly made pasta, focaccia, and gelato. The menu changes daily, with a focus on what’s fresh, local, and in-season. It’s not unlike the way Italians in small towns run their family restaurants — hidden gems full of farm fresh and handmade bites.\n\nThose seeking brunch or a good charcuterie board to pair with an excellent selection of beers are well advised to visit this gastropub. The burger earns raves, and the fun of building your own meat and cheese board cannot be overrated. Finish it all off with a cookie board.\n\nComfort and bar food get a stylized edge at this rustic-meets-maximalism spot off the Square. There’s nary a beer on tap — it’s all cocktails. Drop in for brunch and try the Memphis French toast with banana, peanut butter, and bacon, or during lunch and dinner try one of the many flatbreads. The pimento cheese dip sandwich is also a must-try.\n\nBreakfast, lunch, or an early dinner? Cartwright’s is the answer. This is the place to go in Denton for chicken fried steak, but the fried catfish meal and fried chicken with mac and cheese are gratifying comfort food orders as well. Looking for a fab plate of pancakes? This is the spot.\n\nThis Asian fusion restaurant is Denton’s go-to for sushi and ramen. The combination of Asian and Latin flavors shows up all over — in the Loco Eggroll (chorizo, pineapple, kimchi, and cream cheese), the Southern Smoke ramen (smoked pork combined with adobo chili broth), and Killa Kimchi tostadas. Sushi can be straightforward, great cuts of fish or fusion speciality rolls, including the beef fajita and Cow-A-Bunga. It’s funky, and it’s just the right fit for this town.\n\nChef Tim Love puts his stamp on Denton at this steakhouse, which specializes in surf and turf. It’s signature is Texas-raised beef, and lots of Love’s signature game dishes are here too, including elk and foie gras sliders, rabbit and rattlesnake sausage, and chicken fried quail. For the late night crowd, it also serves doughnuts in Back Dough starting at 10 p.m.\n\nIncredible Mexican street tacos are the speciality at this joint. Go for carne asada, birria, carnitas, even nopales. There’s also a “not tacos” menu with cool fusion options including birria ramen, chicken tinga tostadas, and a giant burrito.\n\nGet a taste of this college town at Hoochie’s — it’s Cajun and Creole-forward seafood in a funky, unpolished atmosphere. Looking for plate of oysters (raw or fried) and a beer to pass the afternoon? Go here. And while one can get almost any kind of fried seafood and French fries plate that can be imagined, the shrimp cocktail and ceviche are excellent and worth trying.\n\nPicone is an eccentric Italian place with strong Denton vibes. The eye-catching specials are always inventive, the chicken parm is the stuff of legends, and it’s an Italian joint revered for its smashburger — yes, seriously.\n\nThis family owned and operated Mexican restaurant is a delight in the Golden Triangle Mall Food Court. It’s house-made corn tortillas are all over the menu, including the tacos, birria, huarache. And the Mexican comfort foods, from carne asada loaded fries to a mega-torta, will do an insatiable appetite right.\n\nKnowing where to find a good burger is a must. In South Denton, this burger joint serves ‘em up on red and white checkered paper in a basket — and the burgers get a little wild. Just the standard issue cheese burger is massive — at a half pound of meat, they all are. But the options here also include Tex-Mex Chili, the Paris burger (with bleu cheese and grilled onions), a Greek burger, and a cheesy cheese burger that has truly all the cheese anyone could handle.\n\nIf pizza is what the heart wants, then it wants to order from Pizza Capri’s. It slings New York style pies, with hand tossed thin crusts that makes for oversized slices. This spot sticks to the classics, with a few modern pizzas thrown in — and if those don’t do it, there is an option to build from the full menu of options. The fried cheese is worth adding to an order.\n\nAny hankerings for pad thai or noodle soup in town can be satiated at Thai Ocha.
