Most of North Dallas is in Dallas County but a small section extends into Denton and Collin counties.\n\nWhat Is Considered North Dallas?\n\nThe definition and boundaries of North Dallas Texas have changed over the years. It may refer only to the area of Dallas north of Northwest Highway to I-635.

Sometimes North Dallas Texas even refers to the Park Cities and the North Dallas cities of Addison, Richardson, Farmers Branch, and Carrollton.\n\nMap of North Dallas\n\nNorth Dallas Population & Demographics\n\nThe population of North Dallas Texas depends on how the area is defined.
