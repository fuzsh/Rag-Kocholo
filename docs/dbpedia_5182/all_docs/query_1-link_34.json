        "text": "Northlake is a growing community located in the southwest corner of Denton County, Texas, along Interstate Highway 35W and State Highway 114, between Fort Worth and Denton, and just 15 miles from the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW). Northlake benefits from its location in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex, the 4th largest metropolitan area in the United States.\n\nThe Town of Northlake was incorporated on December 28, 1960. At that time Northlake consisted of only a number of ranches and very few other uses. In fact, after existing nearly 10 years as a town, the 1970 census recorded the population of Northlake as being only 20 people. The motivation to incorporate was to keep nearby cities from annexing the land. Although the town has grown considerably since its inception and more growth is sure to come, Northlake continues to value its rural heritage as it grows as a part of one of the fastest growing regions in the United States."
