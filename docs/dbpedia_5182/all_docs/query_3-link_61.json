        "text": "Below, Coach Jeff Cornell, Athletic Director and Head Volleyball Coach at CDA Flower Mound, shares his view of what it means to be an athlete at our Classical Christian school.\n\n\"As a Classical school our emphasis is on developing the whole person; the body, soul, mind, and spirit. A student athlete brings their entire being into the competition space, not just their talents. Therefore, as coaches we are to mentor and train up every area of that student-athlete to be the best version of themselves that Christ has for them. We want them to love the Lord with all their heart and love their neighbor well. We train them in overcoming adversity, building resilience, learning how to be a good teammate, and how to persevere in all aspects of their being. To train the body is an essential element of Classical learning and competition. We must strive to reach new heights, run faster, jump higher, lift more as we challenge our body to become all that God created it to be. Spiritually it is essential to connect Godâ€™s word and heart within the structure of athletics. This manifests itself through prayer, devotion, practical teaching, and offering good godly counsel when situations arise."
