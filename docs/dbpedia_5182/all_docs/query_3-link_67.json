That's what I'm talking about!”\n\nThey offer some of the best yoga and fitness classes in the industry led by the best teachers in the industry. The community that comes to Movement is strong and connected. Thank you for all you do!!!”\n\nI want to comment on the quality of the fitness classes. I'm very impressed by most of the instructors. They have all been open to feedback, are passionate about teaching technique and many hang out after class to answer all your individual questions about injury issues, routines, progressions. It's a killer deal to have access to that knowledge on top of the class instruction.”"
