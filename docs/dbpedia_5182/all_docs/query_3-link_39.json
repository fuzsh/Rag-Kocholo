        "text": "DETAILS\n\nHello friends! I'm the perfect pal for anyone who loves a mix of adventure and cuddling. I'm always happy to go on walks or visit pet-friendly places and I love to go on car rides! I will also be your snuggle buddy when you are ready to wind down and watch television. I am already well house trained and know how to use a dog door!\n\nI have even had a DNA test so we know that I am half German Shepherd and Belgian Malinois! That's a bonus you don't find just anywhere.\n\nFOSTER TESTIMONIAL: \"Tara was an Angel. Of course she pulled on her leash with the initial excitement. However about 5 minutes in she relaxed and walked wonderful on a leash! Once we finished enjoying the outdoors we stopped at Jennie's Ice-cream! She LOVED her vanilla ice cream and waffle cone. I hated to return her to shelter. If I was not moving I would have loved to be her foster mom. Sweet cuddle bug.\"\n\n\" She rode well in the car, gave me kisses while buckling her into her seat, and did well on our 4 mile walk--this girl loves to go! She didn't pull too much either--some to start but then settled in to lead me down the trail, sometimes looking back and me with a huge smile on her face, her eyes sparkling. She ignored bicycles that passed us, and smiled and wanted to greet every runner and walker, although never actually stopped to meet someone. After our walk, we enjoyed ice cream together--peanut butter dog ice cream bone-shaped snacks for Tera! She was so gentle in taking the treats and gave more kisses and hugs after our snack. She's a great dog--such a happy girl full of smiles and love. \"\n\nI've found that I get along with many dogs but if you bring yours to meet me before adoption, we can make certain that we will be best of friends.\n\nCome meet Tera at 2400 Lone Star Drive any day 12 pm - 6 pm. She'll probably hear you coming a mile away (did you see how huge her ears are?)\n\nDETAILS\n\nABOUT ME: My name is Daisy and I'm a demure older lady! While I can be shy at first, my bright personality is sure to bloom in a loving home! I enjoy being in the sunshine, just like a real daisy! I also like meeting new people and have been told I'm super polite! I'm even good with older kids and cats! Would you like to come meet me?\n\nFOSTER TESTIMONIAL: \"Daisy's forever family should be one where someone stays home most of the day and with another confident/friendly animCome meet me! We are open 12-6 everyday!al. Although Daisy can be shy sometimes, she is actually very active and playful. She loves going outside unless it's raining, so a family who can spend time with her both inside the house and outdoor would be perfect. I also think she would do really well with kids.\"\n\n\"Daisy has discovered the joy of working out some of her energy and excitement on toys\"\n\nAPPOINTMENT TYPE: I am in a foster home so fill out an application to meet me!\n\nWe also have Seniors for Seniors - If you are 65 or older and adopt a dog or cat over the age of 7 years, the adoption is free!\n\nDETAILS\n\nMy cartoon counterpart may be all about money, but I'm all about love! I'll be your BFF in no time if you show me the treats. My friends here say one of my special talents is my happy tip-tap dance I do when I see them. If you're looking for a loving companion who can make you smile, I'm right here! All I ask in return is love, treats, and toys (I'm a big fan of those too).\n\nFOSTER TESTIMONIAL: \"Mr. Krabs is a very sweet dog who loves the comfy things in life. He does great with all of my resident dogs (ranging from 15 to 100 pounds) and is very tolerant of their nonsense. He has learned about playing with toys and likes plushies when he is inside but enjoys balls when he is outside. He will chase a ball but hasn't quite gotten the hang of bringing it back yet. He likes to watch the squirrels but only chases them if the other dogs do; if it's just him he doesn't seem inclined to chase. He is housetrained if you have a routine. If you stay up \"too late\" he will take himself to bed which is very cute. Since this is his first time being in a home he does have some behaviors you would usually associate with a puppy, like having to figure out which things are or are not toys; however, he doesn't mind having things taken from him and is usually content if you give him an appropriate replacement item. He LOVES food and mealtimes are his favorite time of day as best I can tell. He does his tip-tap dance and will give you a few AWOO's while you prep food. \"\n\nAPPOINTMENT TYPE: Scheduled - I am in a foster home so fill out an application to meet me!\n\nI'm also available for Foster-to-Adopt if you want to take me home before committing to fur-ever!\n\nDETAILS\n\nHi, I'm Lillian! I'm a bit of a classic beauty with my glossy fur and bright, curious eyes that are always ready for a new adventure or a cozy cuddle. I'm the kind of cat who enjoys curling up on a soft blanket and purring contentedly, or watching the world go by from a comfy perch. If you're looking for a furry friend who will bring a lot of love and joy into your life, I'd be thrilled to meet you and show you just how special I am!\n\nI have FELV and was exposed to the Feline Calicivirus, so I would need to be the only kitty in the house or with a cat that has FELV and Calicivirus as well.\n\nI have never been around children so it would be best for me to meet them first.\n\nAppointment type: Scheduled - I am currently in a foster home so please email fostermed@spca.org to meet me!\n\nDETAILS\n\nABOUT ME: I'm Oompa but my foster family call me Rocket! I'm a super sweet boy who can be ready to cuddle in your lap all day! Who says big dogs can't be lap dogs? I'm great with other dogs too and know when to be calm or playful!\n\nFOSTER TESTIMONIAL: \"He's the sweetest boy. happy all the time and very quick to adapt. He's a special one.\"\n\n\"Rocket wants to be a lapdog in the house, but LOVES being outside, exploring, being with other people and dogs. He likes chasing rabbits and squirrels. He does like to play rough. I would suggest he be placed with another dog that likes wrestling.\"\n\nAPPOINTMENT TYPE: I am in a foster home so fill out an application to meet me!\n\nDETAILS\n\nHello! I am Patty! I am looking for my forever home! I am all medium sized and don't take up too much space. I am over 7 but I haven't slowed down much. I do take my naps and chill time seriously. I mean who doesn't love a nap! I would absolutely love to find my forever snuggler, with these ears, I think I can hear my perfectly family on their way! Is it you?\n\nFOSTER TESTIMONIAL: \"Patty seemed to adjust quickly, and looked like she was right at home. She's just a sweet girl. She has lots of love to give. You can tell she hasn't had a great life and she seemed to be so happy to be loved for a couple days.\"\n\n\"Patty has been doing great!\n\nIt only took her about an hour and a half to warm up to the house and get comfy on a chair.\n\nShe had two accidents upon arrival but immediately learned to wait to go outside.\n\nToday I left to work and left her in a comfy crate. She did well the whole 8 hours I was away with zero accidents! She has also done well with the stray cats and doesn't seem interested or bothered by them at all which is a relief. She is truly a well behaved girl!\"\n\nAppointment Type: I am in a foster home right now, so fill out an application to meet me!\n\nWe also have Seniors for Seniors - If you are 65 or older and adopt a dog or cat over the age of 7 years, the adoption is free!"
