This area offers an attractive and thriving real estate market to investors interested in Denton County property management.

In 2007, Denton County was named one of the fastest-growing counties in the United States, and it continues to enjoy a healthy population growth.\n\nHistory of Denton County, TX\n\nPrior to the 1840s, Denton County was sparsely inhabited. Native American tribes, including the Kichai and the Lenape, infrequently populated the county, but it wasn’t until Peters Colony landowners settled there in the early 1840s that Denton County grew in population.\n\nPrior to the annexation of Texas, Denton County was considered part of Fannin County. It was established as Denton County in April 1846 by the First Texas Legislature.\n\nBoth Denton County and the city of Denton, which is the county seat, were named after John B. Denton, a local lawyer and preacher that was killed while raiding a nearby Native American village in 1841.\n\nBy 1860, the population had grown considerably in size to over 5,000 residents. The Denton County Courthouse-on-the-square, which was built in 1896, still stands today and houses numerous government offices and a museum dedicated to Denton County history.\n\nPopulation\n\nAs of 2015, Denton County, TX has a population of 780,612, which is up considerably from its population of 662,615 in 2010.
