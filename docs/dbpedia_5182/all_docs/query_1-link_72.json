        "text": "One case of measles has been confirmed in Denton County, raising the statewide total to seven, according to health officials.\n\nDenton County Public Health confirmed the case Wednesday and is working to identify and contact other people who may have been exposed.\n\nThe case has not been linked to any other cases, the health department said. The department did not release any information about the person who contracted measles, citing patient confidentiality.\n\nThe case is the seventh in Texas in recent days. Three were confirmed in Harris County and one each in Galveston, Montgomery and Bell counties. Five of the cases involve children.\n\nThough the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not declared the Texas cases an outbreak, Texas Department of State Health Services spokesman Chris Van Deusen said there are no hard and fast rules about when the state agency will label a series as such.\n\n\"Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent measles,\" Denton County public health director Matt Richardson said in a written statement. \"Unfortunately, people think that measles is just a rash and fever but measles can cause serious health concerns, especially in young children, and is highly contagious. Vaccination is incredibly effective at protecting those we love from this infection.\"\n\nIn at least two of the Texas pediatric cases, the children had received one round of the vaccination, Van Deusen said.\n\nThe CDC recommends children get two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine — one between 12 and 15 months and the second between ages 4 and 6 — to be fully protected against measles.\n\nThere were nine confirmed cases of measles in Texas last year, six of which were in Ellis County.\n\nAcross the country, nine other states reported cases of the measles in January, according to the CDC. In Washington, 50 cases have been confirmed this year.\n\nSigns and symptoms\n\nIt typically takes about two weeks from the time of exposure to the virus for a rash to develop, but it can take up to three weeks. People are contagious from four days before they get the rash to four days after it appears and should seek medical treatment and isolate themselves at home.\n\nThe rash begins on the face as flat, red spots and spreads down the neck and trunk to the rest of the body.\n\nOther symptoms include a fever higher than 101 degrees, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes.\n\nAnyone with these symptoms who thinks they may have been exposed to the virus should call their health provider in advance of a visit so precautions can be taken to prevent exposure to staff and other patients.\n\nAbout one out of four people who get measles will be hospitalized and one out of every 1,000 will develop brain swelling because of infection, which may lead to brain damage. One or two out of every 1,000 people with measles will die, even with the \"best care,\" according to the CDC."
