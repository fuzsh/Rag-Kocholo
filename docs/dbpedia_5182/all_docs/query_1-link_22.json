        "text": "Have you ever wondered what life would be like in a small Texas town? Tucked into the far north side of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, you’ll find the cozy college town of Denton, Texas. With a welcoming, family-friendly atmosphere, a lively arts and culture scene, and plenty of personality, Denton has become one of the most desirable places for people looking to call the Lone Star State home.\n\nOften referred to as “Little Austin” and “Little D” – because of its many similarities with the bustling big cities of Texas – Denton is a fabulous place to live with so much to offer. For those seeking an experience outside of big city life — but still close enough to enjoy many of the benefits — Denton offers a remarkable opportunity for exploration and discovery.\n\nWhere is Denton?\n\nLocated about 40 minutes north of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, Denton is the county seat of Denton County, TX.
