        "text": "Northwest Independent School District (Northwest ISD) is a rapidly growing public school district in North Texas with its headquarters in the city of Justin. The school district is named for its location in the northwestern area of the Dallas – Fort Worth Metroplex. The school district lies in three North Texas counties: Denton County, Tarrant County and Wise County. The district serves the cities of Justin, Roanoke, Trophy Club, Northlake, Marshall Creek, Corral City, and small portions of Flower Mound and Southlake in Denton County. The Wise County towns of Aurora, Rhome, Pecan Acres, Newark, and portions of New Fairview also lie within the district. The Tarrant County portion of the district includes Haslet, Avondale, parts of Westlake, Keller, and Fort Worth. The district encompasses nearly 235 square miles.\n\nIn 2018, Estes McClure and Associates and the Northwest ISD Construction, Facilities, and Maintenance staff interviewed companies to respond to an RFP for BACnet Web-based Energy Management Control Systems for the new bond program. Enviromatic Systems was chosen from a group of 4 candidates to perform HVAC controls and building automation work in the upcoming group of projects. Since then, we have installed Reliable Controls in the New Lance Thompson Elementary School (also known as Elementary #19), the new Athletic Multipurpose Building and Storm Shelter at Byron Nelson High School, the new Northwest ISD Aquatic Center, and the New Berkshire Elementary School.\n\nWe currently control both Lennox Packaged Rooftop Unit’s (RTU’s) with dehumidification via the Lennox Prodigy II control modules. We also control numerous Aaon Packaged Rooftop Units with single zone VAV, digital scroll compressors, dehumidification, and economizer (outdoor air damper) control based on space carbon dioxide levels to perform demand control ventilation to ensure proper fresh air in each classroom and other learning spaces.\n\nTo ensure redundancy at the IT level when the district centralized IT servers are down for maintenance or are undergoing renovation, each campus can be accessed individually with an in-building dedicated automation server – the Reliable MachProWebCom. This redundancy has solved a lot of problems and created a lot of convenience for the maintenance and energy management personal at Northwest ISD."
