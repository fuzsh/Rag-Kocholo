V-safe is a smartphone-based tool that uses text messaging and web surveys to provide personalized health check-ins after you receive a COVID-19 vaccination.\n\nVaccine Candidate Updates\n\nPfizer, the first COVID-19 vaccine granted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in the US, has begun a clinical trial for children aged 12-15 years, and has begun planning for a trial for children aged 5-11 years later this year. Additionally, Moderna has begun a clinical trial for children ages 12-17. Moderna has also begun testing a booster vaccine for potential use against COVID-19 variant strains.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (J&J) has filed for their Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the FDA. They have released new reports that their vaccine in a single dose regimen is 85% effective against severe illness, and 66% effective at preventing moderate and severe illness. The manufacturer is also researching a two-dose regimen of this vaccine, for potential increased efficacy against the spread of COVID-19.\n\nNovavax has also released data on their COVID-19 vaccine candidate, showing 89% efficacy against moderate and severe COVID-19 disease. They are also manufacturing an additional potential booster or supplement dose for variant strains of COVID-19. Novavax has applied for approval in the UK, and is working with the FDA to submit for an EUA.\n\nAstraZeneca’s vaccine has been approved for emergency use in the European Union, but has not yet been approved in the United States. Thus far, the vaccine has shown 82% efficacy after two doses, however, many countries are advising that this vaccine is not given to individuals over the age of 65, due to a lack of data surrounding this age group."
