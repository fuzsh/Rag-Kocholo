Then tap ‘Delete my account’ at the bottom of the page. If you would like to request your data be deleted, you can email Via's support team at support@ridewithvia.com.\n\nHow do I pay for my rides?\n\nWhen creating an account, you’ll be prompted to add your credit or debit card information in the app. Other payment methods may be available and they are listed in the 'Easy ways to pay' section above. If you are paying by card, you will be charged after the ride has completed.\n\nWhy do I see a pending charge?\n\nThere are a few instances where you might see a pre-authorization charge on your account. Any time a new credit card is added to the app, a $1 hold is placed on the card to ensure it is valid and has at least $1.\n\nAdditionally, when a ride is booked, a hold will be placed on the payment method for the entire amount of the initial ride if it is expected to be more than $15 to ensure the charge goes through at the end of the ride. However, a hold is not a charge. This charge will remain pending and should disappear from your account or statement within 3-5 business days depending on the policies of the rider's bank/financial institution.\n\nHow can I dispute a no-show charge?\n\nYou may be charged for a no-show if you were not at your pickup point on time and the driver waited for two additional minutes but you did not board the vehicle or contact them. If you believe you were inaccurately charged, please send an email to our support team at the email listed above explaining the situation.\n\nAre there any discounts available?\n\nCertain services offer concessions for seniors, students and/or riders that require additional assistance. You can update your concessions by navigating to the menu in the top left corner of the app, tapping your name and then ‘Fare/Service Types’ or ‘Special setting.’ You can then toggle the requested concessions. Please carry appropriate ID with you (such as a student ID), if applicable. If you have a question regarding a particular concession, you can send an email to our support team at the email listed above.\n\nHow do I apply a promo code?\n\nTo apply a promo code, click on the menu in the top left corner of the app and select ‘Promo Codes’. You can then enter your promo code. Please note that certain promotions are time limited or restricted. If you get an error when trying to apply a promo code, it is likely no longer valid. If you have any questions about a specific promotion, you can send an email to our support team at the email listed above.\n\nWhy do I have to walk to meet my ride?\n\nThis shared ride microtransit service operates corner to corner instead of door to door. This means you might have to walk a short distance to your pickup point. To keep things running smoothly and efficiently, our system assigns you to a 'virtual bus stop' - which are pickup and dropoff points that are usually at a nearby corner. This is how we’re able to pick up multiple passengers without adding a significant amount of time to each rider’s journey.\n\nCan I bring a service animal or pet with me?\n\nService animals are always welcome to ride without restriction. Driver Partners have a legal obligation to provide service to riders with service animals. If you are a rider traveling with a service animal and wish to report any issue you experience related to your service animal, please send an email to our support team at the email listed above explaining the situation.\n\nPets that are not service animals are also allowed, but pets should be kept in an airline-approved carrier to use the service.\n\nCan I book rides without a smartphone?\n\nThe easiest way to use the service is by downloading the app with the links above. However, if you do not have a smartphone, or need additional assistance, you can call our support team at the number listed above and we’ll help you over the phone.\n\nZero tolerance policy\n\nThis service is powered by Via. Via has a strict Zero Tolerance policy. Driver partners are prohibited from driving on the Via Platform while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and riders are prohibited from consuming alcohol or drugs inside the vehicle. We do not tolerate inappropriate, threatening or violent behavior by anyone using the Via Platform or towards any riders or driver partners. If you are a rider and observe or believe any of the following, please ask the driver to terminate the trip immediately: your driver may be under the influence of drugs or alcohol, your driver is behaving in a manner that you consider inappropriate or that makes you feel uncomfortable or unsafe, or your driver engages in conduct which could be considered unlawful or illegal.\n\nIf you feel that you are in imminent danger, please contact the police directly by calling 911. After the ride has concluded, please provide feedback/report the issue using the app, email us at the support email address or call us at the Live Support number listed above.\n\nAnti-discrimination policy\n\nVia does not tolerate discrimination of any kind against our riders or driver partners. This includes discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, religious belief or affiliation, gender, sex, sexual identity or orientation, age, veteran status, physical, mental or other disability (actual or perceived), rider’s points of departure and destination, or any other characteristic protected under applicable federal or state law. Additionally, Via does not tolerate discrimination of any kind against service animals. Riders or driver partners found to have violated Via’s anti-discrimination policy will lose access to the Via Platform. If you believe that you have been subject to discrimination by a rider or driver partner, please provide feedback in the review function of the app or email us at the support email listed above.\n\nEating & drinking policy\n\nWe know that you are on the go, but please help us keep our vehicles clean and fresh and avoid bringing food and drink in our cars, when possible. Please also be mindful that smelly food can be distracting and unpleasant for your fellow passengers. All drinks should have lids and drinking alcohol or carrying open containers of alcohol in our vehicles is not allowed.\n\nAge policy\n\nRiders must be 13 years of age or older. Children under the age of 13 can ride when accompanied by a parent or guardian. We will not supply car seats, but riders traveling with children who require them may bring their own. Riders are responsible for securing any such car seat and for ensuring that it fits all legal requirements.\n\nWhy can’t I request a ride?\n\nSometimes, if we are experiencing high demand in your area, there may not be any vehicles or drivers currently available to service your ride. If your travel plans are flexible, you can try requesting the ride again after a few minutes. Please note, calling will not increase your ability to book a ride as our agents have the same ability as you do booking in the app.\n\nHow do I know where and when to meet my driver?\n\nOnce a ride is confirmed, you will see the estimated time of arrival (ETA) of your driver in the app. You can follow your driver’s progress in real-time so you know where they are. The app will give you directions to your “virtual bus stop” which may be a short walk away. Just follow the dotted line to get to your exact pickup spot!\n\nWhat should I do if my driver leaves without me?\n\nRe-book your ride directly in your app, and then please send an email to our support team at the email listed above explaining the situation. Rest assured, you will not be charged for rides you did not take.\n\nHow do I cancel my ride?\n\nYou can cancel your ride directly from the app or by calling our support team at the number listed above. Remember, canceling at the last minute can negatively impact other riders, so please cancel as soon you know that you don’t need a ride.\n\nIf you cancel a ride after a driver has been assigned, you may be charged a cancellation fee unless your ETA is 5 or more minutes longer than initially stated. If you need to dispute a cancellation fee, please send an email to our support team at the email listed above or in the app explaining the situation.\n\nHow do I report an item I left behind in the vehicle?\n\nPlease send an email to our support team at the email listed above with a description of the missing item. We will do our best to track down the missing item and if found, will let you know where you can come pick it up."
