        "text": "For our #PeopleofDentonCounty, we proudly salute our Women Veterans. This incredible group, many of whom are current or former employees of Denton County, have honorably served in various military branches, including the Army, Navy, Air Force, and the Reserves.ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ The Denton County Commissioners Court recently had the privilege of honoring the courageous women who have served in our armed forces. We celebrated their dedication and sacrifice with a special breakfast and proclamation ceremony. During Commissioners Court, each veteran was presented with a unique quilt from Quilts of Valor Texas. The mission of Quilts of Valor is to bestow a universal symbol and token of thanks, solace, and remembrance on those who served in harmâ€™s way to protect and defend our lives and freedoms. These beautiful quilts are lovingly made by the hands of countless volunteers who wish to express their gratitude and honor the service and sacrifice of our veterans. Thank you to all the women veterans for your unwavering commitment to protecting our freedom. Your service and dedication inspire us all.\n\nThis morning, the Denton County Sheriff's Office hosted its annual Law Enforcement Fallen Officers Memorial at the Denton County Administrative Courthouse Amphitheater. We gathered to honor the brave men and women who sacrificed their lives in the line of duty. The ceremony included the Presentation of Colors, a proclamation reading by Denton County Judge Andy Eads, a rendition of the national anthem by the Denton High School Choir, and heartfelt speeches from guest speakers. The Roll Call of Officers, followed by a 3-Volley Rifle Salute, was particularly impactful. As each name was read, an officer placed a flower in the memorial wreath, symbolizing the unity of our entire county. May we always remember and honor the fallen who served their fellow citizens, especially those from Denton County.\n\nWe are growing to better support Denton County.
