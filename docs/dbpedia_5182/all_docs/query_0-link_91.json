The town received its charter in 1841 from the Republic of Texas. At the time the predominate population was native tribes living along the creeks in the area. Little Elm remained sparsely populated until the late 1990s when growth in Plano and Frisco exposed Little Elm’s spacious shorelines as an opportunity for valuable housing communities. The population has since exploded over 600%.

The original city map was described as children’s blocks connected by strings. It incorporated initially to preserve the rural space from annexation from other cities, particularly Denton and Fort Worth. The city began by incorporating several ranches and the roads that connected the ranches of the original citizens. As the city grew it filled in many of the areas to form a more solid city map. The town now includes residential and business space.\n\nLewisville, Texas\n\nLewisville, Texas is a mid-sized city in Denton County, Texas.

It is the namesake of Lewisville Lake and shares a border with it.\n\nLewisville, Texas and its History with Dallas-Fort Worth\n\nThe town’s history is similar to its neighbors in Denton County, beginning in the 1840s. The area that is now Lewisville was first settled by Anglo-American settlers in the 1840s. Named Holford’s Prairie after one of the settlers, in 1853 it changed after Basdeal Lewis bought out Holford’s property. The small community developed around farming. Denton County’s first cotton gin was built in Lewisville in 1867. In 1881 rail service came to the town. The town incorporated in 1925 and public services, particularly paved streets, became a focus of city government. Lewisville continued as a primarily rural community through the construction of Lewisville Lake in the 1950s.\n\nConstruction of DFW Airport in the 1970s to the south brought a boom to the local economy due to its proximity to the airport.

Today it continues to grow with both commercial and residential development.\n\nJustin, Texas\n\nJustin, Texas is a small town in southwest Denton County, Texas with a small portion in Wise County. It is part of the Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan area and the larger North Texas region. The town is near the northernmost portions of Fort Worth near the Texas Motor Speedway.\n\nJustin’s history begins in the mid-nineteenth century. In 1848 the area now within the town was settled by French utopian settlers; however, the settlement failed. Other settlers from American states and other parts of Texas settled in the area. In 1887 residents asked postal authorities to create a post office and name it Justin after an engineer on the local rail line.\n\nThe town remained a small farming community for most of its history. In the twentieth century the town had salvage businesses. In the 1970s the largest salvage yard liquidated assets to produce western clothing. The other two major salvage yards closed shortly after. Today the town has a growing population due to suburban sprawl and proximity to the Texas Motor Speedway.\n\nRoanoke, Texas in Denton County\n\nRoanoke, Texas is a town in south Denton County with a small portion in Tarrant County, Texas. It is part of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex and the larger North Texas region surrounded by Justin, Argyle, Lantana, Haslet, Trophy Club, Fort Worth, Keller and Westlake. Due to its collection of independent restaurants it has obtained the nickname “Unique Dining Capital of Texas”.\n\nRoanoke’s history dates back to 1847 when Anglo-American settlers arrived in the area. They initially settled north of present-day Roanoke in a settlement named Garden Valley. Flooding from Denton Creek made the community undesirable. Settlers began moving south to the present location of the town. In 1881 rail lines developed through the area. The surveyor named the area after his home in Virginia. The town was largely a cattle center for its early history. By the mid-twentieth century it became a manufacturing center which continues through today. Roanoke is experiencing an expanding population due to suburban growth into the northern suburbs of Fort Worth.\n\nHighland Village, Texas\n\nHighland Village, Texas is a small city in Denton County on the southwest shores of Lewisville Lake (or Lake Lewisville) near Lewisville and Flower Mound in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. It is primarily a residential community although some commercial development is taking place, expanding the tax base and desire to move into the area. Highland Village is known for its annual hot air balloon festival sponsored by the Lions Club.\n\nHighland Village incorporated in 1963 on the decision of local residents to create a permanent community. The area was primarily vacation homes for local professionals but also included one ranch. Through the 1970s Highland Village grew quickly to accommodate its population’s desire for a more relaxed feel for Dallas lifestyle. The city’s growth since its incorporation has primarily included residential communities and businesses supporting the local population. The city’s maximum population should fill the city at 18,000 and is already over 15,000.\n\nCorinth, Texas\n\nCorinth, Texas is a city on the west side of Lewisville Lake in Denton County, Texas. It is part of the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex in the larger North Texas area. It is a suburb of Denton, Texas. The city is surrounded by the cities of Denton, Hickory Creek and Lake Dallas. Corinth’s history dates back to some of the early settlements in the area that now sits on the western shores of Lewisville Lake. The first settlement in the area dates back to 1843 (Bridges Settlement); but sources suggest the area that is now Corinth did not form as a town until 1880 when a railway came through the area. The town remained a rural community for most of its history and did not incorporate until 1960. It is now largely a middle class suburb feeding employers in the Dallas and northern suburb areas.\n\nArgyle, Texas\n\nArgyle, Texas is a small town in Denton County in between Denton and Fort Worth. It is on the outskirts of the Dallas/Fort Worth region and part of the larger North Texas region. The master planned community of Lantana receives services through Argyle. The town began settlement by American settlers in the 1850s. The community grew slowly and went through several names. In 1881 the T&P railroad was built through the community with a stop. The community remained a small rural town and suffered through the Great Depression. It incorporated in 1960. Today the town has a growing population due to suburban sprawl and the desire for some DFW residents to live in a more rural small town.\n\nThe Colony, Texas\n\nThe Colony, Texas is a city in southeast Denton County, Texas. It is part of the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex and the larger North Texas region. The Colony is surrounded by Lewisville Lake, Lewisville, Plano, Frisco and Carrollton. The city has a large suburban housing base with a growing commercial base as well, particularly along Texas Highway 121.\n\nThe Colony is a relatively new city in the DFW area. It has been settled by American settlers since the time of the Republic of Texas but did not become a city in its own right until the mid-twentieth century. In 1969 housing developers Fox and Jacobs began developing plans to develop land within what is now The Colony with housing developments. Their goal for this farmland was to create housing developments grouped into colonies with the overall community modeled on Dallas.\n\nBy 1973 they had purchased the land and began building. In 1976 one of the original home owner associations within the area petitioned Frisco to remove the housing developments from its extra-jurisdictional control.\n\nIn 1977 the area incorporated into a city. Residents desired the name Colony but because another town retains the name in Texas they elected The Colony. In 1987 the adjacent city of Eastvale merged with The Colony. Today the city continues to grow both as a residential community and a commercial region.\n\nCarrollton, Texas in Denton County\n\nCarrollton, Texas is a large suburb in the northern suburbs of Dallas, Texas. It is within Dallas County, Denton County and Collin County. It is part of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex and the larger North Texas region. Carrollton often suffers from misspellings such as Carollton and Carrolton.\n\nCarrollton, Texas History near Dallas, Texas\n\nCarrollton’s history is similar to many of its neighbors in Dallas, Denton and Collin counties. Anglo-American settlers reached the area in the 1840s and began settling in several farming communities in what is today Carrollton. Settlers from Illinois built a settlement on the north side of the present-day town in Denton County. Historians believe their home city had the same name in that state. The area was well-farmed but gently populated until rail lines were built to the area, spurring more growth. In 1913 the town incorporated. Around the same time gravel businesses arrived and it became a “grain and gravel” city through the 1940s.\n\nAfter World War 2 growth accelerated as suburban growth from Dallas expanded past the Dallas city limits into nearby suburbs like Carrollton. Growth continued at a rapid pace through the 1970s and 1980s as commercial growth in the DFW region expanded with construction of DFW Airport and commercial expansion along the Stemmons corridor. Today it is one of the largest suburbs in the Dallas-Fort Worth area but retains its own commercial sector.\n\nBridgeport, Texas\n\nBridgeport, Texas is the second largest town in Wise County, Texas. It is part of the North Texas region, sitting northwest of Fort Worth and west of Denton.\n\nBridgeport’s history began as part of a mail route in the 1850s between St. Louis and San Francisco. This particular route passed through North Texas in which the mail carrier had to cross the west fork of the Trinity River. In 1860 the government chartered the construction of a toll bridge over the Trinity River near present day Bridgeport. In 1873 the town replaced the original wood bridge with an iron bridge and built a post office. This was the beginning of a town in the area. The Rock Island Railway laid tracks one mile east of the small town. The railway decided to move the town next to the railway to take advantage of easy access to transportation.\n\nIn 1931 a dam was constructed over the river to form Lake Bridgeport. The city has traditionally been supported by the mining and drilling industries with coal, oil, gas and limestone in the area. Today the town economy continues to the support of oil, gas and limestone industries.\n\nDecatur, Texas\n\nDecatur, Texas is the county seat of Wise County, Texas. It resides northwest of Fort Worth and is part of the outer northwest boundary of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. It is part of the greater North Texas region.\n\nDecatur became an important town when in 1856 the Texas Legislature created Wise County. It allowed Absolam Bishop to establish the location of the county seat at or near the center of the county. He selected the location of present-day Decatur. Bishop preferred the town layout of McKinney and opted to model the town on it. The original name for the town at the location was Taylorsville; but the name changed in 1858 to Decatur after navel hero Stephen Decatur. The town suffered from native raids through the mid and late nineteenth century.\n\nToday it is a small town compared to Fort Worth or Dallas but provides a nice mixture of county lifestyle and modern convenience. The community is directly connected to the northern parts of Fort Worth by state highway 114 which runs directly into the heart of Dallas."
