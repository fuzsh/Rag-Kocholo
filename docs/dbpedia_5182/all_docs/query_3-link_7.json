        "text": "The Project Team for the Northeast Denton Area Plan has drafted a revised project timeline. Those who have been following the project can expect the following in the upcoming months:\n\nThe Joint Meeting of the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council, which was scheduled for October 17, 2023, has been canceled. In lieu of a Joint Meeting, each body will have a work session discussion on the draft Recommended Strategies and Implementation Plan for the Northeast Denton Area Plan. The Planning and Zoning Commission will have this discussion at a Special Called Meeting on November 1, 2023, and there will be a work session discussion at City Council that will take place on November 14, 2023, at which time the Council will receive the same information. Both discussion items are part of public meetings, which will be open for the public to attend and watch as well as being live-streamed and recorded.\n\nFollowing these work session discussions, staff will be interviewing internal and external stakeholders regarding the implementation strategies that were discussed and going over each entity’s responsibilities that would be attached to the recommended strategies.\n\nThe remainder of the calendar year will be spent continuing to draft recommendations for the Northeast Denton Area Plan and attaching implementation action items to the recommended strategies. Shortly after the start of 2024, a Community Open House will be hosted to receive community feedback on the proposed Area Plan. It is anticipated this Open House will take place mid-January 2024. There will also be an online survey for those who prefer a virtual option.\n\nOnce data is compiled from the open house and online survey, the Steering Committee will meet to discuss recommended strategies, implementation actions, and community input. This meeting is intended to take place in early February 2024.\n\nThe Project Team will make modifications to the proposed plan following community input, as well as that of the Steering Committee, before bringing a Draft Area Plan to the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council for public hearing and consideration. It is expected these meeting will take place in the Spring of 2024.\n\nWhy is the City doing a Northeast (NE) Denton Area Plan when there is already an adopted comprehensive plan that covers this area?\n\nThe Denton 2040 Comprehensive Plan is a high-level, visionary document that does not consider specific conditions of this area or of individual properties within the area. The Comprehensive Plan recognizes that NE Denton is a special area in the City with an overall vision of preserving green environment and environmentally sensitive land. The Comprehensive Plan recommended that NE Denton be studied in further detail to work out the specifics on how to achieve the overall vision in a manner that meets consensus, especially among the property owners and stakeholders in the area.\n\nWhat are the limitations of this NE Denton Area Plan?\n\nThe NE Denton study area is 8,546.29 acres, with 3,981.85 acres (46.6%) in the City of Denton city limits and 4,564.44 acres (53.4 %) in the City’s extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ). Therefore, the City can only influence development in 46.6% of the study area to meet the vision established through this planning process. The other 53.4% of the study area will be influenced by the County.\n\nWhat are the roles of the project team (City staff and consultants) in creating the NE Denton Area Plan?\n\nThe project team is made up of urban planners, open space experts, economists, and engineers. The project team’s role is to be facilitators. They will work to collect extensive input from a large and inclusive group of property owners and stakeholders related to what the community wants the area to be and the ways in which the community wants to achieve this vision.\n\nTo assist the community in making these decisions and develop the plan for the NE Denton study area, the project team will provide the community with research and data related to existing conditions in the area and surrounding region, and development trends in the City of Denton. The project team will also use their knowledge and expertise in urban planning and development to provide the community with possible solutions, strategies, and action steps to achieve the community’s vision.\n\nThe project team will use thought-provoking questions and deep-dive discussions to understand what the NE Denton community wants and the ways in which they might want to achieve their vision. The project team will do this both in-person and online. These questions and discussions will focus on understanding the desires of the community. Through this process, the team will provide multiple ways for the community to provide input on what the community wants to see in the NE Denton area in the future.\n\nAt the end of the planning process, the project team will package the community’s desired vision, community-chosen solutions, and proposed action steps into a plan document that will assist the City and the County in guiding the property owners and developers in the types of development that is desired in the area. The plan will differentiate between land that is in the City limits and land in the County. The NE Denton Area Plan document will help the City and the County to plan for the types of infrastructure and services that will be needed in the area based on the community’s vision.\n\nIt seems like there is huge interest and development pressure this area. Why?\n\nNew transportation-related improvements, such as widening US 380, service roads and realignment of Loop 288, improvements to FM 428, and the alignment of the new Outer Loop along Sherman Road, are expected to improve accessibility to and from the metroplex to NE Denton.\n\nThe NE Denton area has easy access to the University of North Texas and Texas Woman’s University, as well as to downtown Denton and its amenities.\n\nThere are large parcels of vacant land under single ownership in the area, which is more desirable for development compared to consolidating multiple smaller parcels under different ownerships.\n\nAccording to the Dallas Regional Chamber of Commerce, the Dallas region has grown by more than one million new residents every 10 years since 1980, putting intense pressure on the region’s housing stock.\n\nWhy does the City consider zoning change requests for projects that do not match the existing zoning?\n\nIf a property owner applies for a zoning change, the City is required by State law to take the application through the process and allow the property owner to make their case to the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council.\n\nWhy does the City consider recommendations that seem contrary to the Future Land Use Map (FLUM) in the City’s Comprehensive Plan?\n\nIn such cases, the City takes into consideration the following reasoning:\n\nA comprehensive plan is a conceptual and visionary document that does not consider specific conditions at a smaller subarea or individual property level.\n\nA comprehensive plan is a living document that must be constantly updated to reflect current conditions and social, economic, and physical changes in an area.\n\nWhat can the City regulate in the ETJ?\n\nThe City only has platting authority in the ETJ. Platting is ministerial, which means that regardless of use or density, if a property meets basic service requirements such as access to water, wastewater, and roads, the City is required to approve the plat. The City can specify minimum lot size only if a property needs a septic system. If a property in the ETJ is serviced through municipal or regional water/wastewater system, the City has no authority to regulate lot size or setbacks in the ETJ.\n\nWhat can the City do to preserve open space?\n\nBuy property and designate it as park space.\n\nUse zoning power in an area to:\n\nSpecify lower-density uses\n\nEstablish large lot requirements and require larger setbacks from the property line\n\nSpecify cluster development resulting in open space conservation\n\nHowever, a city can only do this within the city limits while following state law regarding property rights.\n\nWhy can’t the City buy property for parks in the area?\n\nThe City has a limited budget and must balance providing services to all parts of the City equally.\n\nSome larger property owners are not willing to sell land to the City.\n\nWhat is cluster development?\n\nCluster development – also called open-space development or conservation development – is an attempt to achieve balance between growth and preservation of open space in rural and suburban settings. It is done by clustering homes on a smaller proportion of land. The additional land, which would normally be allocated to individual lots across the entire subdivision, becomes protected as common space. Depending on the site, the common space may protect wetlands, floodways, steep-grade slopes, farmland, wildlife habitat, woodlands, archaeological resources, historic or cultural resources, or groundwater resources.\n\nThe example below shows three different scenarios on a 100-acre wooded site: before development, developed with 2-acre lots, and developed using cluster development.\n\n1https://www.mass.gov/\n\nBeyond achieving site-specific goals of open-space preservation, cluster development attempts to connect open spaces from one development to the next, creating an interconnected network of farmland and conservation land. Conventional development patterns fragment open space into disconnected parcels, severely limiting the amount of suitable wildlife habitat and doing little to create a visual sense of contiguous open space.\n\nBy contrast, cluster development places dwellings in areas hidden from existing roads in order to preserve view corridors and rural aesthetics. In many cluster developments, municipal trail networks are included with the goal of one day connecting to each other to form a regional trail system.\n\nAt the Open Houses held on Thursday, March 23, 2023 and on Saturday, March 25, 2023 community members participated in input activities to understand opportunities and constraints from the community's point of view in the study area. The input activities included the following:\n\nINPUT ACTIVITIES\n\n1) One Thing to Keep and One Thing to Remove Activity Tables\n\nThis activity helped determine the most important desires of the community by asking: “If you could keep only one aspect of the northeast Denton area, what would it be? And if you could remove one aspect of the northeast Denton area, what would it be?” Participants wrote their thoughts on a sticky note.\n\n2) Front Page Headlines Activity Table\n\nThis activity asked community members to write on a sticky note a newspaper headline about Northeast Denton in 2050.\n\n3) Vision Boards Activity Table\n\nThis activity helped the community members picture the future vision for the area. Participants used red and green dots to indicate the images they can envision or cannot envision in the Northeast area.\n\n4) Opportunities and Constraints Activity Table\n\nParticipants used markers to show opportunities and constraints – areas that should be areas of focus for change. These could include dangerous intersections, proposed park space, new trails, good locations for shopping, historical areas to be preserved, informal gathering areas, vacant property that could be better used, wider (or smaller) streets needed, etc.\n\n5) Six Word Story Activity Table\n\nThe Six-Word Story encouraged participants to be creative while providing telling information about the core sentiment of their experience of a place. The Six-Word Story attempts to distill a person’s experience or narrative into a short, evocative story. This is an exercise in brevity while conveying meaning and substance. Example: “For sale: baby shoes, never worn.” Participants write their six-word story on sticky notes and add them to the wall.\n\n6) Discussion Table\n\nThis table provided participants an avenue for additional discussions with more detail and a broader range of topics. Questions from the online survey prompted discussion with community members\n\n7) Children’s Area\n\nThis activity encouraged children to be part of the conversation shaping Northeast Denton’s future. The creative activity asked children to envision the future they want.\n\nOPEN HOUSE SUMMARY\n\nAt the first Community Visioning Open House there were 168 participants that attended the event. At the second Open House there were 97 participants that attended. Below is a summary of what we heard from the community:\n\nNewspaper headline in 2050\n\nRural Country Living Character\n\nOutdoor Recreational Greenspaces\n\nPreserve Hartlee Field\n\nLow Density Residential\n\nProtect/ Conserve Natural Systems\n\nNo More Apartments\n\nControl Developments\n\nRoad resurfacing – Cooper Creek Road\n\nChange back to pre 2000 vision\n\nCompromise through input that all parties are content with\n\nOne thing to KEEP in NE Denton\n\nOpen space, trees, greenbelts\n\nKeep zoning “as is”\n\nLow density rural development\n\nKeep Hartlee Field Road a rural cross section\n\nFarms & cattle\n\nHartlee Field Airstrip & hangars\n\nOne thing to REMOVE from NE Denton\n\nApartments\n\nTraffic\n\nMixed use development/density\n\nPD zoning/ tract homes\n\nTraffic safety measures\n\nFuture growth\n\nHomeless\n\nPlanning & Zoning Commission\n\nJunk yards not in use\n\nWoodhaven Mobile Homes\n\nFor more summary details refer to Phase 1 | Public Engagement Feedback Summary PowerPoint under Important Documents."
