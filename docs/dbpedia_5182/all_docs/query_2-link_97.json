        "text": "A Denton County family found a rare fossil in their backyard that is more than 100 million years old.\n\nThe fossil found by Paul Jones and his 12-year-old daughter, Maggie, is now on exhibition at the University of North Texas.\n\nMaggie said it's the biggest show-and-tell of her life. She is telling everyone about the rare fossil she discovered near a creek in her Aubrey backyard.\n\n\"I call it Bobby,\" she said.\n\n\"Bobby\" is worth bragging about. The discovery of the prehistoric fish fossil was accidental. Maggie and her father were roasting marshmallows at home when they took a walk near the creek.\n\n\"I noticed these rocks out of place, and I turned them over and looked at them, and they had bones running through them,\" her father said.\n\nGeorge Maxey, a UNT geography professor, said he was stunned at the discovery.\n\n\"To have something come in that is that nice, that well-defined -- literally, the entire skull was embedded in the rock -- that was just exceptional,\" he said."
