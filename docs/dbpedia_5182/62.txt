History[]

Season 6[]

In the episode "Returning Japanese", Peggy at the Arlen Bystander tries to trick the editor into giving her a free trip to Hawaii to avoid a traditional (but dreadful to Peggy) Hill family vacation trip to Denton, but it fails when the editor sees right through the trick.

Season 7[]

In the episode "I Never Promised You an Organic Garden", Dale Gribble purchases a bat from the Denton Flea Market in hopes of getting bat guano straight from the source. However, after feeding the bat bugs and prunes, and massaging its colon for two days, the bat yields only a minuscule amount of guano. Realizing that they'll need more bats, Dale, Bill and Boomhauer enter the East Bridge Service Entrance at Bat Bridge and begin collecting bat guano before they are suddenly swarmed by bats and forced to flee in a panic. Dale, Bill and Boomhauer are later seen at the Denton Flea Market as a vendor, attempting to sell their bat guano which they've scooped into jars. Those nearby are repulsed and uninterested.
