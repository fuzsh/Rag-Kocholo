Magazine, “Design Matters with Debbie Millman” is an opinionated internet talk radio show with over 150,000 listeners. Previous guests have included Milton Glaser, Stefan Sagmeister, and Ellen Lupton.\n\nThe show is produced in the Empire State Building in NYC.\n\n[tags]design, webdesign, talkradio, podcast, debbiemillman, zeldman, jeffreyzeldman, internet, internettalkradio[/tags]\n\nLike Loading...\n\nLast year, a month or two before SXSW, I went on a movie star diet, all tiny portions of unseasoned unsucculent nothingness. I lost five pounds and wanted to murder the world.\n\nThis year I decided to skip desserts instead of dieting.\n\nIt’s amazing how many sweets you’re exposed to as the parent of a young child. Even if you don’t stuff your own larders with sugary treats, every weekend it’s some kid’s birthday party, where the cakes and ice cream flow like apple juice. In an environment where all that sugar and flour is normal, you partake without thinking.\n\nSo I started thinking.\n\nRejecting dessert soon became second nature. No birthday cake at little Johnny’s birthday bash. No fabulous pear thing when Grandma visited. No red velvet cake at the place in our neighborhood where it’s to die for. No exquisite little French pastries at the business lunch bistro. No little tin bowl of mango raisin coconut whatever at the best little vegetarian Indian place in Curry Hill. None for me, thanks. Not having any. It looks delicious, but no.\n\nMan is a fallen creature and the devil weaves endless snares. I stuck to my no-dessert program through an onslaught of spectacular temptations. And then, like a fool, I succumbed.\n\nYesterday, the mother of the tot celebrating his third birthday came around with cupcakes baked into ice cream cones. Sugary vanilla frosting, M&M crumble topping, ordinary packaged cake batter, stock stubby cone—not even a sugar cone.\n\n“No thanks,” I said, waving her away, but smiling to show that I appreciated the offer and did not judge anyone.\n\nA minute later she came back, revolving them a few inches from my lips. “I made extras,” she said perkily.\n\n“No thanks—well, okay,” I said, grabbing one of the things.\n\nI wolfed it down. It was entirely as expected: an initial burst of pleasure followed by disappointment and regret. An absolutely ordinary child’s treat. Nothing special. No depth. Dutifully, no longer enjoying, I finished it all, even the dry, frostingless part deep in the little cone’s bottom.\n\nIt was like throwing away a marriage over a one-night stand with someone you met at a bus station.\n\n[tags]sxsw, sxswi, parenting, dieting, food, treats[/tags]\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelentless winter rain was turning last night’s snow to slush as I with my head cold and A— with her wooly hat left the lobby of our apartment building, headed for the nearby crosstown bus.\n\nFrom home to preschool is a mile uphill, and we always walk it. But today was no day for pedestrianism. Even the dog could barely be persuaded to lift his leg.\n\nAnd taking the bus was a form of bribery. A— did not want to go to school today, but she loves to ride the bus.\n\n“We’ll ride the bus to school!” we proposed, and this enticement sufficed to get the girl dressed and downstairs—where we spied the bus, half a block away, accepting passengers and about to leave.\n\nWe ran through the slush, holding hands, my office bag bouncing off my left shoulder, the diaper bag bouncing off my right, the stroller sliding ahead of us, guided by my free hand.\n\nYou must fold a stroller before boarding a New York City bus. At the bus doors, I had trouble folding. The stroller would not collapse. The driver and the wet passengers inside stared down at me like bison on a nature show, blinking impassively while contemplating my destruction.\n\nA woman in front of me took A—’s hand, to help the little girl onto the bus while her father wrestled with a child carrying appliance.\n\nI saw myself stuck in the slush. I saw the bus doors closing. I saw a strange lady taking my daughter away.\n\nI grabbed A—’s hand, pulled her away from the stranger.\n\n“I’m sorry, thank you, I appreciate it, but my daughter has to stay with me,” I said. At which point, blessedly, the stroller collapsed. I scooped daughter, stroller, diaper bag and office bag into my arms, ascended the bus steps, and placed my Metro card into the card reader.\n\nThe bus driver looked at me and said something incomprehensible. The bus beeped; the card reader blinked red and ejected my card.\n\nI reinserted the card, smiling, already soaked, my daughter and possessions balanced against my chest. Again the red, the beeping, the ejection.\n\nThis time I understood what the bus driver was saying.\n\n“Your card’s empty.”\n\n“Oh,” I said, the whole bus watching me and my daughter, every face wondering what refugee camp we had escaped from, and whether the bus driver would show mercy and let us ride on this most miserable of cold wet rainy days.\n\nThe bus driver blinked at me.\n\n“Um,” I said.\n\n“Pay or get off” the bus driver said.\n\nBuses accept Metrocards and coins only. You need $2 in coins. I don’t carry $2 in coins.\n\n“Can I give you two dollars in bills?” I said.\n\n“No,” the bus driver said.\n\nSo the girl and I plunged back into the slush and began the mile uphill walk in the rain.\n\n“Why can’t we ride the bus?” my three-year-old asked through trembling lips.\n\nHer whole world was now about the bus ride she’d been promised, and the promise I was inexplicably breaking.\n\n“I’ll let you walk,” I said, since walking, instead of riding in the stroller, is also a perk.\n\nI took out her Dora the Explorer umbrella, which we bought two weeks ago at a premium price.\n\nIt was broken, I discovered. The umbrella offered no protection whatever from the rain. On the plus side, you could still read the Dora the Explorer logo, so the licensee was getting his money’s worth.\n\nUmbrellaless, toddling along, we made it to a major avenue where the deep, melting ice and snow came halfway up to A—’s knees, and women stared at the idiot father letting his beautiful innocent child flounder about in wetness.\n\n“There’s too much ice, now; you’ve got to get in the stroller,” I said.\n\n“No!” she said.\n\nThere was nothing else for it. “I’ll give you candy,” I said.\n\nIn the Duane Reade on Third Avenue, I let her pick the candy—she selected something pink and disgusting—while I unpacked the stroller to get at a plastic sheet at the bottom. The plastic sheet is supposed to snap over the top of the stroller, protecting children from rain, snow, and oxygen. I could not get it to snap or stay or even cover the stroller. Strike three.\n\nSo we walked the rest of the way uphill, uncovered, rain-battered, she with her candy and I with silent curses.\n\nWe reached the school and climbed the steps in the usual way—the girl refusing to climb the steps, me carrying her in one hand and the stroller in the other.\n\nWe were both soaked through and I realized I was the worst father walking the earth. All the other kids came in wearing rain boots. My kid was wearing pretty little black Maryjanes. The other kids were damp. My kid looked like she had been swimming in the East River.\n\nWhat saved me was this:\n\nIn the library at the top of the stairs, preparing to read a Curious George book before school began, the girl sat by the radiator and said, “Look, Dad. This hot stuff will get me dry.”\n\n[tags]zeldman, myglamorouslife, parenting, nyc, preschool[/tags]\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe sights, sounds, and sense of An Event Apart Chicago 2007.

This imbalance bothers me as much as it bothers Kottke. I am glad Kottke raised the issue in his recent post, although I think it is a mistake to hold conferences accountable for deeper problems in the industry they serve. But that doesn’t for a minute get conference planners off the hook.\n\nThe problem is visible at the top because it exists at the bottom. There are barriers to entering the field and barriers to doing well in it. Some of these barriers are economic: not everyone has access to needed tools and training. We are interested in systematic and permanent change in the field, not merely the appearance of change as represented in a conference speaker lineup. Soon we will announce real steps to put these concerns into action.\n\nLike Loading...\n\nCategories\n\nGoodbye\n\nWhen the phone rang, around 10:00 pm, my heart stopped.

I can’t believe we got him. I’m still awed that he said yes.\n\nIf not for Steve Krug, I wouldn’t so much as speak the word “usability” in the privacy of my home, let alone bandy it about in mixed company. Curt Cloninger memorably expressed what many of us felt when he wrote “Usability experts are from Mars, graphic designers are from Venus” in the July 28, 2000 issue of A List Apart.\n\nStop and smell the brimstone\n\nLike many design professionals, I rejected usability when I first encountered it. That’s mainly because I first encountered it as a series of rules, put forward by business-oriented, lab-coat-wearing experts who were hostile to the aesthetic component of user experience. Later, the rules would soften. “Only use blue, underlined links” would give way to gentler and more flexible guidelines.\n\nAnd even before this softening, there was much in the early, fire-and-brimstone approach to usability that was actually of value to web designers. I should have been open-minded enough to benefit from the helpful bits and wink at the rest. But I was too busy defending my creative turf (not to mention reliving old battles with badly run focus groups and cocky account execs) to look closer and see that usability mainly means designing for the people who use my site.\n\nAnd then along came Mary\n\nDon’t Make Me Think. Starting with his book’s very title, Steve Krug made me see. Advancing from one low-key, guilt-free, common-sense premise to the next, Don’t Make Me Think made me think. And think. Above all, it made me rethink.\n\nConsider an archived Happy Cog portfolio page. Ignore the problem of orange-on-orange, which falls more under accessibility than usability. Focus on the page’s unusual means of presenting written content. When you click an icon, relevant text emerges. Click again, and it disappears. For instance, when you gently tap Cate Blanchett, you get text about the Charlotte Gray website we designed for Warner Bros.\n\nIt’s nifty stuff—at least for a non-Flash, pre-Ajax site. Or is it? I had fun designing it; other designers had fun reverse-engineering it and adding the same show and hide effects to their pages. I even shared the code in the first edition of Designing With Web Standards, mainly to prove how easy it was to use CSS, JavaScript, and the DOM to create playful interfaces that roughly mimicked the behavior of applications and kiosk-based presentations.\n\nBut the page’s usability is awful. How could a visitor possibly know that she is supposed to click an icon to reveal pertinent hidden text? She couldn’t. Hence the explanatory text at the top of the page. If you have to explain how your interface works, maybe you need to rethink the whole thing.\n\nSteve Krug didn’t drop by my house to tell me my design was overwrought and under-thought. And he wouldn’t have put it that way, anyway. He’s way too nice a guy, not to mention way too experienced a consultant, to base his tutelage on insults. But his book woke my conscience and reshaped how I approach my craft.\n\nHis book, which you can read during a business flight, makes a convincing case for studying your audience, learning their needs, creating pathways of experience that you hope will meet those needs, and then testing, testing, testing.\n\nKrug convinces because he is witty, and charming, and humble, and mostly because his ideas make sense and ring true. Boiled down, the essence of usability is the same as the essence of all good design: Think more so your users don’t have to think at all.\n\nDesign, after all, is about solving problems. Start with your user’s.\n\nPlease come to Boston\n\nMy Event Apart co-host Eric Meyer and I don’t know exactly what Steve Krug will talk about on March 26 or 27 on our stage at Marriott Copley Place. We only know we will be privileged to be among his listeners. Registration for An Event Apart Boston 2007 will open in January, 2007. (A lot) more information about the show will be available very soon.\n\nIn coming weeks, in these pages, I’ll share what each of our exciting speakers means to me. Meanwhile, enough about me and Steve Krug. What does Steve Krug mean to you?\n\n[tags]aneventapart, Steve Krug, usability, design, webdesign, boston, conferences[/tags]\n\nLike Loading...\n\nOur letterhead isn’t finished. Our aging website doesn’t provide a clue. Ordinarily an announcement like this one would wait until a site redesign was complete, new business cards were slipped into wallets, and expertly prepared press materials had been carefully seeded in the fields of journalism and the lonely rooms of the blogosphere. But for reasons which will become apparent soon, we can’t wait to relate the news that Happy Cog™ is expanding.\n\nIn addition to its original New York flavor, Happy Cog now also comes in a delicious new Philadelphia blend, under the leadership of Happy Cog Philadelphia president Greg Hoy. Both offices provide high-level design and user experience consulting services. They share a vision. They share methods. They even share team members (some Cog personnel divide their time between New York and Philly).\n\nMore detailed and more meaningful announcements—not to mention an expanded and redesigned site—will come soon. Meanwhile, welcome, Jason, Rob, Daniel, Heather, Jon, Mark, and Robert Roberts-Jolly.\n\n[tags]happycog, design, philadelphia, nyc, newyork[/tags]\n\nLike Loading...\n\nPike Place Market, Sep 17, 2006.\n\n[tags]aneventapart, seattle, pikeplacemarket, flickr, design, webdesign[/tags]\n\nLike Loading..."
