        "text": "The microelectronics revolution in the twentieth century and the evolution of the profile of Information Technologies and Communication require a teacher able to adapt to a changing world. The simple proposition of using technology in school, with the goal of making teaching innovative, is naive. Teachers need to be trained competently in order to open paths in the construction of their own knowledge and creativity. Therefore, researching the fundamentals of distance education to build a path that allows the university community to access the achievements of this type of education in the initial and continuing training of teachers from the State University of Maringá (UEM) is the challenge before us. For this, we proposed systematic study along with institutional projects to identify activities developed in distance education that make it possible to analyze the proposed teacher education projects developed, identifying actions that enable the initial and continuing training of the teacher within development of the course in the modality of Distance Education (DE).\n\nThe study focusses on the relevance of the teacher education programmes through distance mode which are facing various challenges due to globalization and technological advancements in the field of education. With the explosion of knowledge, education is going through new transformations and, therefore, it will have to evolve in the direction of the new globalised knowledge society. The alarming challenge before the distance teacher education programme is to be equipped with 21st century knowledge and skills and learn how to integrate them into their classroom practice to realize its goal of successfully meeting the challenges of this society so that the coming generation can meet the demands of a global society. This paper focuses on the need of distance teacher education programme to find innovative teaching and learning methodology and access the potential for new forms of communication using emerging technologies. In the 21st century, teachers need to be life-long learners, adap...\n\nDistance training environments (DTEs) are considered as the next generation ways and means for teacher training in Morocco. They present a valuable solution to sustain the increasing need for preservice and in-service training of a very large number of teachers, especially those in remote areas. In this paper, we will describe Morocco’s first experience towards establishing DTEs in teacher training programs. We will outline the successes and challenges of developing distance teacher training. The project first targeted teacher trainers from twelve regional training centers for jobs in education and training (CRMEF) who translated their savoir-faire to application in their respective institutions. The beneficiaries profited from a one year hands-on training on DTEs through a blended e-learning program that focused on three major areas: educational engineering, instructional technology, and online tutoring. The qualitative evaluation of the first phase of the project revealed a high satisfaction rate among all beneficiaries and has confirmed the importance of e-learning and blended learning in the particular context of teacher training. The project also resulted in the establishment of distance training platforms in each CRMEF. The second phase of the project focuses on implementing and piloting distance training modules in each center. This project is part of a dedicated joint program for Improving Training for Quality Advancement in National Education (ITQANE) led by Creative Associate Internationals in partnership with the central unit of professional training at the Moroccan Ministry of National Education, the National Center for Innovative Pedagogy, and the Al Akhawayn University in Ifrane. ITQANE is supported by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Keywords: DTEs, e-learning, blended learning, educational engineering, instructional technology, instructional design, online tutoring.\n\nThe article demonstrates the expediency and ways of organizing distance training of future primary school teachers: forming theoretical knowledge and skills basis in students for the mastery and effective use of computer devices and information and communication technologies in professional activities and the fundamentals of information culture, information and communication competence; establishing a foundation for further mastery of teaching curriculum and technologies of distance learning in the area of primary education; as well as implementing the electronic learning courses Modern Information Technologies of Learning and The Fundamentals of Distance Learning in Primary School (developed at LMS Moodle). It is noted that the distance training of a future primary school teacher is an interdisciplinary pedagogic category that characterizes the degree of individualization, intensity and controllability, is subjected to the goals of the professional development of independent cognit..."
