        "text": "Stage 1: Research & Development\n\nThe first stage is usually when the company is being conceptually formulated, partnerships are established, and funding is sought.\n\nThere are usually few employees in a small office. Insurance needs are somewhat minimal, and typically driven by lease requirements or required by law.\n\n• General Liability for office space (possibly an Umbrella depending on lease requirements)\n\n• Property Coverage for Physical Assets\n\n• Business Interruption coverage including loss of R&D materials\n\n• Workers Compensation & Disability as required by law\n\nStage 2: Growth Phase\n\nTypically this stage will be when outside funding is received, products are launched to market, employees are hired, and there is possibly some international expansion.\n\nInsurance issues take on a bit more complexity. Client contracts often trigger the placement of these coverages.\n\n• Errors & Omissions for intellectual property, privacy, and Internet services negligence which causes financial or other no-tangible loss to a third party\n\n• Directors and Officers liability to protect the management team and Board of Directors from shareholder and employment related suits\n\n• Crime coverage for employee theft, forgery, computer fraud, ERISA requirements\n\n• Global Companion Policy to expand all coverages to a worldwide basis\n\n• Employee Benefits including medical, dental, life and disability coverages\n\n• Key Man Life insurance for founders or other key employees (often a VC requirement)\n\nStage 3: IPO\n\nThe biggest change in a company’s insurance program at this stage is the enhanced protection required to fend off shareholder/class action suits. This takes the form of a restructured D&O policy, and negotiating the correct coverage is a very specialized practice.\n\nAdditionally, most liability coverages should be increased, since the higher profile of the company might mean it's more susceptible to lawsuits.\n\n• Restructured Directors and Officers Liability insurance, which may include several carriers to achieve an appropriate coverage amount\n\n• Separate Employment Practices Liability coverage\n\n• Employed Lawyers coverage for in-house counsel\n\n• First Party “loss of revenue” protection for denial of service, loss of data, breach notification costs, and other web specific losses\n\n• Loss Control services such as website assessments and monitoring, employee ergonomic evaluation\n\n• Patent infringement coverage\n\nStage 4: Mature Company\n\nAt this point a solid risk management foundation should be in place, and monitoring the company’s growth and diversification becomes the biggest concern. Acquisitions can cause material changes to the company’s business risks.\n\nAs the company now has more cash, it also has the ability to sustain smaller losses without a devastating result. This allows for some new ways to set up the insurance which will help contain costs.\n\n• Increased Deductibles and Self Funding considerations\n\n• Merger and Acquisition policies to protect against acquired and assumed liabilities\n\n• Participating Workers Compensation Policies (which can return a high percentage of the premium to you if you have no or few claims)\n\n• Local policies placed in foreign countries for subsidiaries and owned locations\n\n• Loss Mitigation policies. Most companies will have claims/suits at some point. With this type of policy, you work with the insurer to \"buy out\" your claim at the amount that you choose, and anything above that is the insurer's responsibility."
