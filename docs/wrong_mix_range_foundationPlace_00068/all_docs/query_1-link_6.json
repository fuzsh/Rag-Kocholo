He is busy integrating the platforms, staffs and customers into a global operation with hundreds of employees worldwide.\n\nIn this interview with Beet.TV, Blum says that the new company provides far more services than pure plays OVP (online video platform) companies. He says it “leapfrogs” ahead the competitive set.\n\nKIT Digital is publicly traded on the NASDAQ as KITD. It has a market capitalization of $311 million.\n\nKIT CEO Kaleil Isaza Tuzman was a co-founder of GovWorks.com which was subject of a 2001 documentary Startup.com — a classic about the dotcom boom.\n\nBelow is our interview with him from last April.\n\nAndy Plesser"
