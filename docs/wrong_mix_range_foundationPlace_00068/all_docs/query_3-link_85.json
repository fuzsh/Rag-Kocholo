NO. The roofer is correct on this one.\n\nsecond area the shingles are not mechanically fastened and just stuck to a pile of tar under the eve. they said they did not find any “raised shingles per my report” Those shingles do not look properly installed. Cant really tell, but from the picture it looks like they are raised up and should be concern for leaking.\n\nfinal picture is the drip edge does not \"finish at the edge of the wall, and the plywood substrate is exposed. It is under an eve but still I would think it should be finished properly.\n\nroofer stated that this metal was installed at the time of build ? not making any repairs. **Well, if the roofer said so, then it must be true, right? **\n\nOhh and the lovely job of fascia installation with exposed endgrain butt joints, roofer states was installed per existing. Tell them to paint the fascia and move on?\n\nAnyone think I should fight this?"
