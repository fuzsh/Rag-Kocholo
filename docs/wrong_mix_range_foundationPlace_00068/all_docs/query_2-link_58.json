From mega-launches with massive marketing budgets to lean new IP projects, from multiple-million selling games to mobile/social apps with a million daily active users, my experience spans many platforms, genres, & target demographics, and I have won multiple awards for delivering high-quality results. I hold a marketing & technology MBA from the Kellogg School of Management. As a B2C Product Mentor at multiple startup accelerators including Google, I regularly give 'office hours', where I sit with the various companies and advise them on their most pressing product issues. That's exactly what I'm offering via Clarity.\n\nFor the last 17 years I have been employed as Business development Director/CEO at a small number of game development/publishing businesses. Primarily facilitating the commercial means to support and sustain creative and technical excellence in the development of world class products according to the game development mantra – “on time, within budget and to an exceptionally high standard”. I have negotiated and secured countless development, distribution and publishing deals and contracts, routinely deal with legal advisors and have raised £m’s in in grant and equity funding. I am a confident presenter, an effective communicator and a strong team player. Business development and blue chip key account management is my forte. 12 years ago, I secured $10m equity investment and established a Cambridge HQ for Midas Interactive. I employed the management team, secured the product development strategy and put an effective global sales and distribution structure in place. 10 years ago I acquired, via Gameware Europe Ltd., all of the assets and IP in world renowned Cambridge studio Creature Labs Ltd. and now own the historic ‘Creatures’ and ‘James Pond’ IP which are commercially exploited via ongoing publishing partnerships(Creatures online via Bigben, James Pond – Robocod via System 3, digital via Merge Games). Gameware have recently delivered the iOS/Android app “Man United Tricks” together with a proprietary ad server for Zoombugs Ltd with the intention to build upon the MU app via social engagement – developing interactive products that effectively engage and build the fan/community user base. Gameware also delivered 4 series of the BAFTA nominated TV gameshow Bamzooki – empowering users to create 3D creatures online and interact with their user generated digital creations in real time. Connected TV, mobile, PC ++ screens provide a direct to user global communication channel and therefore a huge opportunity for talented, nimble and well funded digital creatives to develop and iterate digital products for global audiences whilst maximising D2C revenues.\n\nDigital Product Manager and Entrepreneur. I enjoy solving problems with products and services. I have cofounded and codirected an internet startup (Wemories). I've also worked designing, prototyping, developing and pitching entertainment products for iOS, web, Wii, DS, PS3, XBOX 360 and PSP. I believe in: 1. Putting ideas in front of users and customers as soon as possible. 2. Listening and observing the people who is using the product to understand: what's working, what's not working and why. 3. Improving the product in quick iterations, always having the business goals in mind. 4. Focusing on marketing only when people want the product.\n\nI'm a serial entrepreneur and software engineer; sold three companies and built apps and games on iOS and Facebook reaching close to 100 million users. Having always been passionate about education I am now building products that help people learn on mobile devices. Got my start co-founding an online restaurant business in college and developed skills in sales, running large distributed workforces, and building systems to collect and manage large complex data sets. Since then I discovered I'm pretty good at creating contexts where people want to do things online. Specialties include social games, iOS games, viral mechanics, virtual currency based systems and micro transactions. Occasionally I enjoy investing in and advising early stage startups. I find purpose in empowering people to realize their potential, making the world more efficient and human beings better able to manipulate their environment."
