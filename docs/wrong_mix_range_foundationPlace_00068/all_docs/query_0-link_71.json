However, FBI agents pursuing the case never asked for assistance from any staff members at Hennepin County (Minn.) Library, where the suspect allegedly sought information on how to make more effective bombs....\n\nAmerican Libraries Online, Sept. 12\n\nShuttered Hartford branches get second reprieve\n\nThe Hartford, Connecticut, city council broke into cheers September 9 at the announcement that two state legislators had persuaded the leaders of the state house and senate to give the city library one-time donations of $100,000 apiece from their respective $2-million contingency funds to reopen the Blue Hills and Mark Twain branches as of September 15. A September 4 library board meeting also brought trustees the news that Louise Blalock (above) would retire as director at the end of 2008 after 15 years at the library’s helm....\n\nAmerican Libraries Online, Sept. 12\n\nALA News\n\nRettig to discuss creating connections\n\nJoin ALA President Jim Rettig at the ALA Connections Salon, an online event scheduled for 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. Eastern Time, Friday, September 26.

Most recently, she used the public library as a resource when she remodeled her house in Los Angeles. “To me, the library is important because I have a lot of intellectual curiosity, and there’s a lot of fun in that,” she says. “And the library is the place to explore that.”...\n\nVisibility @ your library, Sept. 16\n\nOnline ALA meeting spaces available\n\nALA now has four virtual rooms—two 25-seat rooms, one 50-seat room, and one 100-seat room—available for use by any ALA or ALA-affiliated group at any time. This service is run through OPAL (Online Programming for All Libraries), but rooms must be booked by ALA staff.

The library brought in nearly 200 entries for this year’s Step Up to the Plate @ your library program, which concluded September 1.

Middle School Librarian Kathy Batykefer nominated Harrington for the honor “because she has given me the funds and encouragement to really make an extraordinary library.”...\n\nPittsburgh Post-Gazette, Sept. 7\n\nSeen Online\n\nIn the digital age, government information gets lost\n\nCountless federal records are being lost to posterity because federal employees, grappling with a staggering growth in electronic records, do not regularly preserve the documents they create on government computers, send by email, and post on the Web. Federal agencies have rushed to embrace the internet and new information technology, but their record-keeping efforts lag far behind. Moreover, federal investigators have found widespread violations of federal record-keeping requirements....\n\nNew York Times, Sept. 12\n\nUN agency eyes curbs on internet anonymity\n\nThe International Telecommunication Union, a United Nations agency, is quietly drafting technical standards, proposed by the Chinese government, to define methods of tracing the original source of internet communications and potentially curbing the ability of users to remain anonymous. The U.S. National Security Agency is also participating in the “IP Traceback” drafting group, named Q6/17, which is meeting this week in Geneva to work on the traceback proposal. Members of Q6/17 have declined to release key documents, and meetings are closed to the public....\n\nCNET news, Sept. 12\n\nHighsmith relocating, not closing\n\nContrary to a report in the Madison (Wis.) Capital Times, the library supply company Highsmith, of Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin, will not be closing. It will, however, be relocating in November to Janesville, where its new owner, Lab Safety Supply, is headquartered. The majority of Highsmith employees will be moving to the new location, according to LSS. Highsmith customers may continue to reach the company at the current phone, fax number, and website....\n\nWatertown (Wis.) Daily Times, Sept. 10; Highsmith\n\nLawmaker to sponsor Oregon school library bill\n\nFund Our Future Oregon, a campaign to save school libraries across the state, recently obtained word that state Rep. Peter Buckley (D-Ashland) will sponsor a bill to support their efforts. Nancy Sullivan, media specialist at James Madison High School in Portland, says she and FOFO cofounder Suzie Kabeiseman hope to meet with Buckley in coming weeks to help draft a bill....\n\nSchool Library Journal, Sept. 8\n\nPublic hearing on Joy of Gay Sex in Helena\n\nMike Cronin testified that the public library has an obligation to provide all material to clients and does not have any obligation to serve as parents. He was one of about 20 people who spoke at a public hearing September 16 in support of keeping The Joy of Gay Sex at the Lewis and Clark Public Library in Helena, Montana. More than a dozen people testified for removal of the book. The request to remove the book came from Paul Cohen, of Helena, who found the book on one of his frequent visits to the library in February....\n\nHelena (Mont.) Independent Record, Sept. 17\n\nHackley Library discovers a rare book\n\nPhilanthropist Charles H. Hackley continues to give to Muskegon, Michigan, this time through a chance purchase 110 years ago of a 50-year-old book that apparently had interested him. It turns out that book—long stored and virtually forgotten at the public library Hackley built—is a rare first-edition Book of Mormon, which library leaders believe will fetch more than $70,000 that will be used to benefit library users....\n\nMuskegon (Mich.) Chronicle, Sept. 15\n\nMaine librarian appears on Jeopardy\n\nHalf a dozen staff members ambled into the Deerfield (Ill.) Public Library meeting room September 12 and took their seats. They clapped and cheered when the game show Jeopardy introduced one of their own, Cindy Schilling (right), who worked in the children’s department until she took a job as assistant library director for youth services at the Wells (Maine) Public Library in 2006. She made an impressive showing in the first round, but in the end, Schilling was done in when a math teacher from Gurnee, Illinois, got all three daily double questions. Finishing second, she earned $2,000....\n\nDeerfield (Ill.) Review, Sept. 15; Portsmouth (N.H.) Herald, Sept. 16\n\nWhy home libraries are back in style\n\nReading rates are down and Americans say they love casual living. And yet, one of the most popular rooms in big new houses is a library. Rather than being about books, their appeal is often about creating a certain ambiance. In the latest annual National Association of Home Builders consumer survey, 63% of home buyers said they wanted a library or considered one essential, a percentage that has been edging up for the past few years. Many mass-market home builders are including libraries in their house plans, sometimes with retro touches like rolling ladders and circular stairs....\n\nWall Street Journal, Sept. 12\n\nFour Trenton branches to close\n\nAll four Trenton (N.J.) Public Library branches will close later this year and workers there will be laid off due to budget cuts, according to the city library board. The board decided September 10 to shutter the branches after city officials informed the library that its $3.5 million in funding would be cut by 10%. The closures of the Briggs, Cadwalader, East Trenton, and Skelton branches were decried by residents, city council members, and members of the library board....\n\nTrenton (N.J.) Times, Sept. 12\n\nFewer library hours for Hawaiians?\n\nWith deeper, more severe budget cuts possibly on the horizon, the Hawaii State Public Library System may have to again cut services after nearly five years of attempting to restore previous cuts to library hours and staff. “We just barely recovered from the 2003 reductions,” State Librarian Richard Burns said. The library’s budget is down to $28.3 million, a 6.9% reduction compared with 2007–2008....\n\nHonolulu Advertiser, Sept. 15\n\nNYPL Broadway photos stuck in a copyright tangle\n\nA 1957 photo (right) promoting West Side Story, as well as thousands of other famous images by photographer Leo Friedman, are in limbo, largely uncataloged, caught in a dispute between Friedman and the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center, where he had the pictures sent in 1971. At stake is an extraordinary theater archive: about 4,580 prints and 2,655 contact sheets representing 168 stage productions from the 1950s and 1960s, the golden age of the Broadway musical....\n\nNew York Times, Sept. 12\n\nFind out what’s shaking at the library\n\nThe new Portola Valley branch of the San Mateo County (Calif.) Library sports a seismograph that allows patrons to measure earthquakes affecting the tectonic plates that underlie the Bay Area. Built by local engineers for less than $2,000, the instrument takes readings of earth movements and displays them on a digital screen in real time. The new green facility opened September 15....\n\nSan Mateo County (Calif.) Times, Sept. 12\n\nHappy birthday, Enoch Pratt\n\nAs a pianist played “200 Candles,” a roomful of Enoch Pratt Free Library fans in Baltimore toasted the bicentennial September 10 of the benefactor who gave away his millions, as he put it, “for all, rich and poor, without distinction of race or color.” The event was cast as the start of a citywide celebration of philanthropist Enoch Pratt (1808–1896). Duff Goldman, owner of Charm City Cakes, donated a flour-and-sugar rendition of a book stack (right) that included H. L. Mencken’s The American Language, Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Black Cat,” Anne Tyler’s Breathing Lessons, and Laura Lippman’s Every Secret Thing....\n\nBaltimore Sun, Sept. 11\n\nGulfport council delays library demolition\n\nThe Gulfport, Mississippi, city council did its part September 16 to spare the former Gulfport Library building from demolition, for now at least. The council voted 4–3 to stop the demolition, despite this admission from the head librarian: “Our first choice was to never return to that building; we don’t want to go back there,” said Celia Barrett, who spent more than a decade as the head librarian in Gulfport. The library, which was heavily damaged by Hurricane Katrina, has been a hot-button issue between the county and the city for about a year....\n\nBiloxi (Miss.) Sun-Herald, Sept. 17\n\nYale’s Mudd library closes\n\nOn September 12, the Seeley G. Mudd Library—a two-million volume, high-density, storage library—officially closed to the public. There was no fanfare and little certainty for the library’s future. For 12 to 18 months, Yale University officials say, the library staff will complete the cataloging of more than a million of Mudd’s volumes. The library will then either be renovated or demolished to make room for Yale’s two new residential colleges and a new Social Science Library....\n\nYale Daily News, Sept. 15\n\nThree arrested in Hayes Library book theft\n\nA Columbus, Ohio, couple and a Marysville man were arrested this week in connection with the thefts of two rare books from the Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Library in Fremont, Ohio, on June 27 and August 25. One of the books, Laws of the Territory of the United States North-West of the Ohio (the Maxwell Code, 1796, right), is thought to be the first book printed in the territory that became Ohio. Valued at more than $100,000, it was recovered shortly after the couple’s arrest. An apparent accomplice took a related volume, Laws of the Territory of the United States North West of the River Ohio (the Freeman Code, 1798), on the later date. The FBI has located that volume overseas, but it may be difficult to seize and return it....\n\nColumbus (Ohio) Dispatch, Sept. 13; Toledo Blade, Sept. 12, 17\n\nUIUC professor: Library theft not unusual\n\nAn expert on the theft of rare books says he is not surprised James Brubaker of Great Falls, Montana, was able to steal documents from libraries in broad daylight. “I don’t find it odd at all,” said Travis McDade, assistant professor of library administration at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. “This stuff is surprisingly common.” McDade said Brubaker appeared smarter than many thieves by selling less expensive items that would attract less attention. Brubaker was sentenced to 2-1/2 years September 15 for stealing rare and valuable documents from libraries across the West....\n\nGreat Falls (Mont.) Tribune, Sept. 16\n\nProject tracks books stolen by Nazis in Berlin libraries\n\nUp to 150,000 of the books on the shelves of Berlin’s Central and Regional Library headquarters are thought to have been stolen by Nazis from Jews, freemasons, social democrats, and other minorities persecuted between 1933 and 1945. Because previous ownership traces have been removed and victims’ descendants are scattered across the globe, the job of returning them to their rightful owners will be difficult....\n\nDie Welt, Sept. 14\n\nTech Talk\n\n10 platforms for creating online communities\n\nDion Hinchcliffe writes: “Creating online communities of customers and workers has been one of the hotter topics in business and technology this year. Whether you’re on the business side, in IT, or are just trying to build virtual teams around shared goals, online communities are rapidly becoming a popular way to organize people and accomplish work in a highly collaborative manner. These communities aren’t just for socializing but for getting things done.”...\n\nEnterprise Web 2.0, Sept. 4\n\nScreen size does matter\n\nJennifer DeLeo writes: “The computer monitor or HDTV you pick says a lot about you. If you’re a web designer, you’ll need plenty of screen real estate to do your job, so a 22-inch or larger LCD monitor is a necessity. There is one universal truth, though: The standard 17-inch LCD monitors and 22-inch flat-panel TVs just don’t cut it anymore; everyone—no matter their needs—wants to upgrade to a bigger screen. With that in mind, we’ve rounded up the 17 best LCD monitors and HDTV sets for your computing or viewing pleasure.”...\n\nPC Magazine, Sept. 16\n\n7 things you should know about geolocation\n\nGeolocation, also called geotagging, is the practice of associating a digital resource with a physical location. A photographer, for example, might include the longitude and latitude coordinates for where a picture was taken, allowing others to pinpoint that location on a map. Increasingly, geolocation is being applied to infrastructure components and end-user devices for the purpose of knowing where people are. This additional layer of location data can make resources much more useful to a broad range of users....\n\nEducause Learning Initiative, Aug. 27\n\nWorldCat for iPhone\n\nAlice Sneary writes: “I don’t have an iPhone yet, but I just found (another) reason to want one: There is now a WorldCat app developed for it, available for download at the Apple apps section (for free). If you have an iPhone, download it and let us know how it performs for you. In fact, we might even send you a free WorldCat t-shirt in exchange.”...\n\nWorldCat Blog, Sept. 16\n\nThe state of cloud computing apps\n\nAccording to a new Pew Internet and American Life Project survey (PDF file), some 69% of online Americans use webmail services, store data online, or use software programs such as word processing applications whose functionality is located on the Web. Online users who take advantage of cloud applications say they like the convenience of having access to data and applications from any web-connected device. However, their message to providers of such services is: Let’s keep the data between us....\n\nPew Internet and American Life Project, Sept. 12\n\nBabar and the French colonial imagination\n\nAn upcoming exhibition at the Morgan Library in New York of Jean de Brunhoff’s working drafts and watercolors for Histoire de Babar, le petit éléphant (1931) has reignited a controversy over the meaning of the Babar books, said by some critics to represent European colonialism. Writer Adam Gopnik analyzes the series and concludes: “Far more than an allegory of colonialism, the Babar books are a fable of the difficulties of a bourgeois life.”...\n\nNew Yorker, Sept. 22\n\nFirst the movie, then the book\n\nMarjorie Kehe writes: “It used to be that you read the book and then, a couple of years later, you saw the movie. But recently, it’s been happening the other way around. Especially interesting is the fact that sometimes the book starts as a figment of the filmmaker’s imagination. The forthcoming Christian movie Fireproof features an imaginary book, The Love Dare, as a plot point. But the codirectors of the movie sat down and penned such a book in the space of a few weeks. It hasn’t hit bookstores yet, but has already sold 300,000 copies and may become the bestselling Christian book of 2008.”...\n\nChristian Science Monitor, Sept. 16\n\nThe roots of science fiction\n\nLauren Davis writes: “Science fiction came of age in the 19th century under the talents of writers like Mary Shelley, Jules Verne, and H. G. Wells. But before these authors stands a long history of proto-science fiction tales, replete with voyages to the moon, socially and technologically advanced civilizations, and visions of the future.

The collection is skewed towards local interests; there is a lot of Christian fiction, as well as volumes on truck repair. The central library runs book clubs for home-schooled children and teenagers, which are well-attended.

The interesting truth is that it is excellent precisely because of it....\n\nThe Economist, Sept. 11\n\nTeen gaming is universal, diverse, and constructive\n\nThe first national survey of its kind (PDF file) finds that virtually all American teens play computer, console, or cell-phone games and that the gaming experience is rich and varied, with a significant amount of social interaction and potential for civic engagement.

Is it your job to talk to people who would probably throw you out of their offices if you said the word ‘Twitter?’ Are you trying to reach audiences who’ve never visited a social networking website because they’ve heard those sites are used by no one but virus peddlers, sex fiends, and 14-year-old losers? Here are five strategies for using social media to reach people who don’t use social media, with specific tools you can use to do it.”...\n\nReadWriteWeb, Sept. 11\n\nPsst!

The individual holes are created in such a way that they can be set up and taken down quickly, and they can be folded down for easy storage. LMG plans to work with college design-school students to create the unique 20% of the course, which might include replicas of local buildings or other items of interest to the community. For example, it’s easy to imagine a Chicago version with a mini Sears Tower and Hancock Building.”...\n\nThe Shifted Librarian, Sept. 15\n\nCataloging tools from LC\n\nCarla writes: “LC’s Cataloging and Acquisitions homepage contains a myriad of cataloging resources.
