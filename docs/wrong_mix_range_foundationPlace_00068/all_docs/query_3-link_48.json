Here are great new free* online services you can start taking advantage of right now:\n\nSocial networking: Social networking remains a largely “free” environment for users who want to interact online. Not only can your association join existing networks like Facebook and ActiveRain for free but you can launch your own social network free of charge as well, for members to interact with one another exclusively. Use social networking platform Ning.com to create new online networks for specific groups, such as young members, committees, or leadership. Another free platform is KickApps.com, which enables you to integrate social networking applications into your association’s Web site.\n\nMeeting and scheduling: Instead of wasting valuable time and paper to get the word out about your association meetings, check out MeetingWizard.com, which allows you to arrange and schedule events in a simple online format. Send invitations, review responses, and issue confirmations and reminders using just a browser and e-mail account. Another scheduling tool, Doodle.com, includes polling and voting options that allow your association to gauge membership interest in important issues. And then there’s TimeBridge (with free and paid features), which claims as its mission “to ensure that your attendees arrive prepared, stay focused, and leave with a common purpose and clear to-dos”—who wouldn’t want that?\n\nOffice productivity: Free for personal use, Zoho.com offers productivity and collaboration applications that range from e-mail to accounting spreadsheets to online presentation tools. ThinkFree Office (www.thinkfree .com) is a Web-based office suite (i.e., an alternative to buying expensive Microsoft Office) that allows users to create, edit, and share word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation materials. Also try Google Apps, offering word processing, e-mail, storage, and much more “in the cloud.”\n\nWeb hosting and creation: If your association is looking for a free, easy way to upgrade an existing Web site or create a new online home, check out Yola.com, which prides itself on being able to “take what’s in your head and turn it into Web pages in front of your eyes,” without imposing banner ads or pop-up ad windows. Another option is Weebly.com, which offers a “drag and drop” site builder, editing function, and free hosting.\n\nWeb security: Your organization’s computers—and the sensitive data stored within—need to be protected. ZoneAlarm.com offers a free option that features firewall protection from hackers and other external threats.\n\nWeb site analytics: Associations looking to measure the effectiveness of their Web sites can use free Web analytics tools like Statcounter.com to analyze and monitor all the visitors to your Web site in real time. The information can then be used to tweak your organization’s online presence, making it more useful for members and visitors.\n\nBlogging: If your association doesn’t have a blog up and running yet, try Blogger.com or Wordpress.com, both of which offer free blog publishing tools. Get members and site visitors engaged in association activities and updated on association information through text, photos, and videos—all of which can be uploaded to and embedded in your blog within minutes with either of these utilities.\n\nPhone and fax: Check out the business version of Skype, deployable on multiple machines, that includes free Skype-to-Skype video calls plus some paid features including screen sharing. FaxZero.com allows users to send faxes for free, and without using a traditional fax machine. Plus there’s a promising new service from Google, called GoogleVoice, which gives you a single phone number that will ring any or all of your phones—home, mobile, and work. With MongoFax, free to associations, members can use their fax machines to e-mail documents.\n\nWeb presentations: The next time you’re conducting an online meeting with board members, check out SlideShare.com, which enables you to upload your PowerPoint, OpenOffice, and Keynote presentations, tag them, embed them into your blog or Web site, browse others’ presentations, and comment on individual slides—all at no charge. Also great for embedding training presentations into your association’s Web site.\n\nThe most important things I’ve learned as an AE\n\nYou must have trust and faith in your leadership. If you don’t, you need to figure out why, then work to obtain it.\n\nMake sure your leadership clearly understands their role: providing direction, leadership, and support.\n\nBe respectful of your leadership’s time and priorities. Always remind them that they are volunteers.\n\nMake sure your leadership enjoys their role. Let them have fun, be recognized, and feel they are making a difference.\n\nIf you lose your enthusiasm and energy to be an effective AE, find another position. Life is too short.\n\nBe considerate, fair, and honest in all that you do. Many people look up to you and, as an AE, part of your job is to set a good example.\n\nDon’t take yourself, your position, or the association too seriously. It’s just a trade association.\n\n— Robert E. Golden, RCE, CAE, CEO, Colorado Association of REALTORS®\n\nMLSs bet on consumer Web sites\n\n“Just slightly more than two-thirds of survey respondents offer an MLS consumer Web site or will be launching one in the next 6 to 12 months. It appears that the industry has now recognized it can provide value to its members by delivering leads from a public-facing Web site.”\n\n—2011 CMLS MLS Operations Benchmarking Survey, Council of MLS, www.councilofMLS.com.\n\nTrend: designations add dough\n\nThe median income of REALTORS® without a designation is $29,700.\n\nThe median income of those with at least one designation is $51,500.\n\nNAR has 16 official designations:\n\nAccredited Buyer’s Representative\n\nGeneral Accredited Appraiser\n\nAccredited Land Consultant\n\nGraduate, REALTOR® Institute\n\nCertified Commercial Investment Member\n\nNAR’s Green Designation\n\nCertified International Property Specialist\n\nPerformance Management Network\n\nCertified Property Manager®\n\nREALTOR® Association Certified Executive\n\nCertified Real Estate Brokerage Manager\n\nResidential Accredited Appraiser\n\nCertified Residential Specialist\n\nSeniors Real Estate Specialist®\n\nCounselor of Real Estate\n\nSociety of Industrial and Office REALTORS®\n\n— Source: 2010 NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS® Member Profile\n\nWhat keeps MLS operators up at night:\n\nThe concern over their inability to control the distribution and unauthorized use of data\n\nThe need to improve the quality of their technology offerings and customer service to maintain their subscribers\n\nThe search for a way to offer more personalized service levels for their members\n\nThe need to cut costs and generate non-dues revenue\n\nThe search for ways to create a suite of new products that are seamlessly integrated with one another as well as auto-populated by MLS data\n\n— Based on a the 2011 CMLS MLS Operations Benchmarking Survey, Council of MLS, www.councilofMLS.com\n\n9 new MLS green fields\n\nThe Greater Las Vegas Association of REALTORS®’ MLS has joined a growing cadre of MLSs that anticipate a property’s environmental features will become increasingly important to home buyers in the future. In fact, a recent survey of MLS operators indicates that 13 percent have some level of searchable green fields in their system. In June, GLVAR added these fields to its MLS:\n\nGreen details: This field will show if an energy audit of the home is available, if the home has low-flow faucets, solar electricity systems, and more.\n\nHot water: This will show if the home has recirculating hot water, solar water heating panels, or a tankless water heater.\n\nGreen certification: This will list the certifying organization, year the home was certified, and its green certification rating.\n\nEnergy Star appliances: This field will show which appliances have met the Energy Star standard.\n\nParking: This field will show if the home has a hookup for an electric car.\n\nEco Baths: This field notes dual-flush toilets or low-flow showers.\n\nEco heating/cooling systems: This field shows if a home has high-efficiency HVAC systems, programmable thermostats, and similar features.\n\nEnergy-saving: This field notes insulated doors, windows and more.\n\nUtility information: This section lists features such as solar panels and screens.\n\n— Survey conducted in late 2010 by GRC and NeighborWorks\n\n4 social media productivity tips for associations\n\nEstablish a social media strategy and policies to guide your outreach for today and tomorrow.\n\nMaintaining a fresh, relevant, and useful presence on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc., takes time. Commit staff and resources to make it work.\n\nUse automated tools (such as Seesmic, HootSuite, and Postling) to post news or announcements to multiple social media platforms at once.\n\nAsk your social media followers to suggest your site to friends and share its content. Also ask board members and volunteers to regularly give thumbs-up and to post comments.\n\nAssociation technology equipment wish list\n\niPads for everyone! Wouldn’t it be great to make sure your board of directors and staff had access to the latest and coolest technology to facilitate meetings, collaborate on projects, organize committees, and communicate instantly?\n\nPortable presentation projectors. The so-called palmtop projectors, such as the BenQ Joybee GP1 and Samsung P410, are powerful and bright but still lightweight enough to pack in a bag for mobile multi-media presentations at members’ offices.\n\nVideo cameras, such as the Canon Vixia HF M3x series, are essential for making association webinars, YouTube videos, virtual orientations, or Internet TV broadcasts via ustream.tv.\n\nEvery office needs a multifunction wireless printer, such as the Dell 1125, that laser prints in color, faxes, scans, and photocopies. Some even let you e-mail what you’ve just scanned right from the machine.\n\nTouch-screen -monitors have become more commonplace as their price has steadily dropped over the past decade. They are great for creating an easy touch-screen information station in your association office lobby.\n\n6 things I’ve learned in my career as an AE\n\nLead by example.\n\nListen more than you talk.\n\nAssume the best; prepare for the worst.\n\nNo good deed goes unpunished!\n\nUnexpected good deeds to your staff pay the biggest dividends.\n\nThank-you notes should always be handwritten.\n\n— Duncan R. MacKenzie, CEO, New York State Association of REALTORS®\n\nTools for new AEs\n\nNew AE orientation is a day-long event in Chicago for first-time AEs, both local and state. Held twice a year.\n\nTrack for new AEs at the AE Institute includes special programming for new AEs that focuses on basics of dues policies, NRDS, e-commerce, membership policies, governing documents, and more.\n\nNetworking sessions for new AEs are held at the AE Institute and the annual REALTORS® Conference & Expo.\n\nRoadmap for New REALTOR® Association Executives is an in-depth online resource and orientation tool for new AEs.

(This site is being revamped and expanded in 2011 to include other AE transitions.)\n\nMonthly new AE e-mail reminds AEs of upcoming events, deadlines, and new developments.\n\nFacebook page for new AEs to share and network online.
