        "text": "THE TRUTH: Fundraising is a competitive sport... There is an estimated capital gap of £100Bn per year, there simply isn't enough funding to go round.. First, you need to understand where the money comes from. -> In the average fundraising round the average ticket size is £25k. Less than 20% of tickets are for £100k or more. 🏦 Institutional Investors (VC) - They see 3,000 businesses enter per year and only 6-10 leave with funding. Around 80% of the deals go to former colleagues, direct introductions or partner referrals. This leaves 20% for \"normal\" people like us. This is highly competitive. Really consider if you are right for VC and if VC is right for you before you sink 6-9 months into the process. 👼 Angel investors -“not really investing for money more to help the ecosystem” - Angel investors are very random, they come and go in short spurts, when they are ready to invest, it is highly competitive against their own personal network, who they can finance and win influence from. Every other entrepreneur is vying for attention and their inboxes are saturated. This is a highly competitive funnel. Oh, don't forget the VC's are also trying to get cash from them. I have personally ran investor outreach for VC funds to target small ticket Angels! ⏩ Accelerators - Basically a giant pitch competition. Competitive 🏟 Crowdfunding - Literally 30 pitches on a page. Competitive. ♻ Syndicates - 10+ Angels Investors all wanting to fund their own deals/introductions - Competitive. But why is this relevant? Too many founders are sitting in a burning building waiting for a hand full of introductions.. Deal flow pipelines for investors are bursting they are so full. No investor is sitting around waiting for you to turn up so they can finally invest, the capital market never sleeps. Understanding that you are being judged against other businesses is a critical part of being investable. It is YOU vs THE WORLD. Are you ready to take it on? #founder #funding #business #VC #pitchdeck #investing #venturecapital #entrepreneur #startup\n\nI am thrilled to announce that I have successfully acquired my former partner's shares in Inverse Funding... As we embrace this significant milestone, we unveil our new identity: IGL (Inverse Group LTD). Founded in 2020, our journey started with a strong foundation, having collaborated with over 200 companies to fuel growth and innovation. Now, as IGL (Inverse Group LTD), we're setting our sights even higher. Our rebranding marks a strategic pivot as we aim to serve not only emerging startups but also mature enterprises and global corporations. IGL is evolving into a comprehensive and well-rounded consultancy firm, ready to make a greater impact on a larger scale. A big thank you to my former business partner Ivan Hoo, Inverse was a big part of his life for the past 4 years and I'm excited to see what comes next. His commitment and professionalism has been first-class since the moment we started working together many moons ago. I am very excited about this new chapter and the opportunities to bring more comprehensive and impactful solutions to our clients worldwide. Here's to new beginnings and continued success at IGL—where we innovate, empower, and achieve together! #IGL #BusinessGrowth #StrategicConsulting #Rebranding #NewBeginnings\n\nMonday - Friday 9 till 5 is a MYTH... I'm coming up to 15 years of having a payroll, other people who depend on me and that carries weight on your soul. It means you \"never switch off\". When others depend on you to pay their own bills, you have to turn up every day, with no excuses. I think the biggest misconception when starting your own business is that once you become your own boss, life gets easier. I think it's the opposite. That's not to say I don't enjoy it... There is something beautifully peaceful about working on a Saturday morning, no calls, no pressure, just time for creative work and free thinking. I find the same working after 10pm at night. Those quiet moments are where I can unlock a superhuman level of output. To all those out there taking advantage of every bit of time you can get, I see you and it all adds up in the end. This isnt \"hustle p*rn\", its just the reality of being a business owner. Luck plays a big part in business, but you have to be there to take advantage when it strikes. #Business #Founder #Mindset #VC #AngelInvestor #Entrepreneur\n\nI shouldn't be where I am today... Did you know in 2021, London Business School Alumni raised a total $4BN, which was more than Portugal and Switzerland combined? Did you know that studies by Morgan Stanley show that a majority of VC funding often flows to founders who are within the existing network of investors, which includes former colleagues, friends, and partners? Well my story is a little bit different to this.. -> Grew up in Newcastle -> Struggled with bullying at school -> Mum was a hairdresser, Dad sold shampoo -> No A-levels, No Uni Degree, No Corporate Job -> Parents started a Sandwich Shop and then a Buffet Restaurant I was hooked on business. We would go every day after school and sit for hours. I was obsessed, I still am, but most importantly it taught me the power of... -> Turning up every day -> Presenting your best self -> Delivering a consistent product -> Providing value to those who buy from you And to be honest, that's all you need to know in business. You can forget your degrees, your fancy title, and your privilege because business is THE great leveller. All founders are equal. We all have that same nut to crack. It requires unbelievable effort, determination, passion, consistency, quality and more luck than anyone wants to give credit to. I'm living proof that no matter the starting point of your journey, your destination can be anything you are brave enough to desire. #Founder #mindset #startup #entreprenur #Vc #AngelInvestor #business\n\n10 things you should know about fundraising in 2024... Since 2018, I have now worked on 200+ funding rounds, I stopped counting at £60M raised but every week, month, year.. the landscape is changing. So here are some observations from the last £3M I have supported at the early stages in Q2 2024. ↗ Cold LinkedIn Outreach Works -- But, its getting harder. Anyone, anywhere, regardless of quality can show up in your ideal investors inbox. This leaves them saturated and soggy. To stand out you have to be precise, concise, genuine, relevant and exciting. ↗ VC Is Creeping Back To Life -- Ticket sizes feel smaller, risk appetite feels lower and very little flex on what they can or can't do. The usual players Fuel, Ascension etc are firing on all cylinders and worth applying to if you are a match. ↙ Email Is Dead -- A mixture of many things but getting positive responses from email campaigns is now extremely few and far between. You need to be pumping out thousands and even then its a low reward strategy. ↗ \"Jump On A Call\" -- Is a weak call to action. Getting an investors attention is one thing, but what do you actually do with it? Sending to a generic pitch page doesn't work, virtual coffee doesn't work. You need a page on your own website. Own the traffic, own the investor journey. ↙ Crowdfunding Is Dead -- For the early stages, I don't think its worth considering as part of your fundraising strategy anymore. Unless you have a mailing list of 20k+, 70% raised and knockout traction, it just isn't for you. ↗ Board/Bored Advisors -- Top heavy companies are off-putting for angel investors. Walking into a business with 8 bored board advisors can be daunting. To excite new investors, keep your corporate structure light. ↗ Knowledge Transfer -- This is the hardest part, the more efficiently you can do this, the more funding you generally raise. Having a well-managed \"intelligence centre\" is essential. Notion, Google Docs etc all work well. ↙ Valuations Matter -- We are very much in a \"buyers market\" and with that in mind, the price is more important than ever. 80%+ of my rejections are coming from valuation. Providing solid rationale and an openness to negotiate is key to drop the cash. ↗ Follow Up Strategy -- Being top of the inbox lasts only a second in this world. I've recently had an investor come back to me from last October! The best founders are able to maintain the traction and momentum well enough without becoming a pain. Well-crafted updates, clear timelines and transparency on round traction help a lot. ↗ Don't Forget The Story -- One thing that never changes, investors get hooked on your story, your vision, your mission, your ambition and the opportunity. If it isn't exciting, and they cant see how THEY win, it's never going to happen. Double down on this. #Fundraising #Startup #Pitchdeck #AngelInvestor #VC\n\nMore than 47,000 UK businesses are on the brink of collapse... We are told, \"All good things come to an end,\" but the reality is ALL things come to an end—good or bad, nothing is eternal. Recent reports highlight a troubling trend with a 25% jump in distressed companies during the final three months of 2023. I talk to 100+ founders a month, many are in a state of pure panic. All I can encourage you to do is think about the basics... 📍 Communication - I often discuss and practice \"doomsday\" scenarios. Being prepared and comfortable with potential crises can make all the difference. Start telling it how it is, own your truth. It is liberating. 📍 Expertise - Who is actually around you? Surround yourself with people who thrive in challenging situations. Their experience can be invaluable. 📍 Finance Systems - The common mindset is, \"there is no money to manage, so what's the point?\" This is flawed. Up-to-date and accurate cash flow forecasts are crucial. If you don't take your company's finances seriously, who will? 📍 Revenue Generation - Many businesses hesitate to generate revenue, especially in early stages. Even if your product is still in development, if the problem you're solving is significant, there should be a market willing to pay for a manual or preliminary solution. 📍 Cash Management - Are you \"robbing Peter to pay Paul\"? Balancing your cash flow is critical. Avoid making deals that burden your future self. Taking these steps won't change your business overnight. However, they can help you avoid tumbling into a spiral of financial distress. Julie Palmer from Begbies Traynor Group describes the current economic climate as a “perfect storm” for UK businesses, driven by high interest rates, rampant inflation, weak consumer confidence, and rising costs. The Bank of England’s rate hikes have increased borrowing costs, leaving many businesses struggling. Top 10 sectors with firms facing ‘critical’ financial distress: ➡ Construction (7,849) ➡ Support services (7,096) ➡ Real estate & property services (6,228) ➡ Professional services (4,347) ➡ General retailers (3,133) ➡ Telecoms & IT (2,830) ➡ Health & education (2,719) ➡ Media (1,828) ➡ Financial services (1,373) ➡ Food & drug retailers (1,343) Stay vigilant, prepare for the worst, and make good strategic decisions. This will be key to navigating these challenging times. #Founder #business #fundraising #cashflow #finance ↔ Want to help fix the future of fundraising? Join our founder Lotto.
