        "text": "After I wrote the “Neutron Randy” post about Randy Falco’s abrupt management and strategy changes at AOL, I was called by several AOL execs saying I was missing the logic behind his moves.\n\nIn essence, AOL’s new team decided that the strategy they inherited—building up AOL.com as a portal—was not going to achieve its goal of building a mass advertising business that could replace the dying Internet access business.\n\nIn a world of search, social networks and other forms of browsing, portals don’t serve the same function they once did. (See this quick take on Google’s approach to portals.) If you look at the breakdown of the traffic on Yahoo or AOL, you’ll see that by far the largest number of page views is on their e-mail services. The various content sections, news, movies and so on, are still huge but they are losing share of mind to smaller sites.\n\nFor advertisers, that want to bring their messages to the broadest possible audience, the home pages of portals have been the best option. In a fragmented world, however, Mr. Falco & Co. realize that to offer advertisers reach, they need to add a network of smaller sites to AOL’s own properties. And so they are putting the company’s existing advertising business—built on its Advertising.com unit and other acquisitions—in the spotlight. (I still wonder whether they are undercutting AOL’s successful efforts to build new specialized sites like Engadget or TMZ.)\n\nSince AOL’s management, and Time Warner, still harbor dreams of selling a partial stake in the company to the public, the fact that advertising networks are far more fashionable on Wall Street than portals is also relevant.\n\nBut the fashion has logic. Big content sites as well as portals are facing slower growth than they had expected in ad sales as users and advertisers move to ad networks and social networking sites. There is increasing talk of publishers extending their own sales efforts to make vertical ad networks. A big auto site, for example, might try to represent not only its own properties but related blogs as well. Glam Media is a model for this. Its attempt to build its own fashion site didn’t take off, but it has had great success with a fashion oriented blog ad network.\n\nThe question for this strategy is whether there will be dozens of specialized ad networks or whether Google and maybe a handful of others will create general purpose networks that will dominate the business.\n\nThis rapidly shifting ground also shakes the foundations of Yahoo, which has lots of pieces of both the old and the new worlds. It runs the world’s largest portal, with very successful sections like Yahoo News and Yahoo Finance. It has a variety of social media offerings, a few of which have become popular. Its text ad network is second only to Google, and it is starting to build a banner network.\n\nWhether Yahoo’s parts can turn into a coherent growing business, or whether the company will eventually look like AOL does now—always running to catch the next wave—is not clear."
