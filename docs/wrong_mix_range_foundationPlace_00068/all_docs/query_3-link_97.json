        "text": "The thing about competing with Kaleil Isaza Tuzman was it never quite made sense. Even as his company was struggling, they always seemed to have a way to buy competitors and grow. When I was running Magnify.net, there wasn’t a day that went by that a competitor was rumored to be for sale to Kit Digital - Tuzman’s company. And even as they grew in the video space, it didn’t take but a quick search to read about his checkered past. Or, even simpler, you could go and rent the movie. Really.\n\nIf you can call the lead character in a documentary about a spectacular dot.com meltdown a \"star.\" then Tuzman was a superstar.\n\nThe year was 2001. The Internet was just taking off, and a young filmmaker named Jehane Noujaim got the idea to watch the startup world from the inside. She found Tuzman and began following the fundraising and launch of govWorks, Inc. The film was called Startup.com, and it turned out to be a powerful cautionary tale. Tuzman and his nerdy high school friend, Tom Herman, were riding high on VC cash and inflated promises of world domination.\n\ngovWorks.com promised to be a bold new website designed to link people up to local municipalities. The company more than doubled in size from 120 employees in January of 2000, to 250 employees just four months later. With ‘A’ list board members; Chase Manhattan Bank, Mayfield Fund, and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. The company burned through a staggering $70 million in venture capital in just three years. But paying parking tickets online just wasn't that sexy. Tuzman said the losses were due to what he told the Wall Street Journal were \"my boneheaded management mistakes.” The film Startup.com was released by Artisan in May 2001, and won the Sundance Film Festival Grand Prize that year.\n\nOk, so govWorks crashed and burned. Startups fail, entrepreneurs take risks, it’s part of the journey to build new things and see around corners. So you can almost give Tuzman a pass. Almost.\n\nJust six years later, Tuzman was back, this time shifting from the local government space to the video space. Now he was operating in my world. In 2007 Tuzman purchased the ROO Group and was named CEO and Chairman. The company was renamed Kit Digital and went on a multi-media buying spree.\n\nIn 2008 they acquired eight companies including Sputnik Agency, Visual Connection, Kamera, Morpheum, Narrowstep, Nunet, The FeedRoom and Juzou. In 2009 KIT digital was listed on NASDAQ and moved its headquarters from Dubai, UAE to Prague, Czech Republic. And the purchases kept on coming. In 2010 they bought Multicast Media Technologies, Benchmark Broadcast Systems, Megahertz Broadcast Systems, Accela Communications and Brickbox Digital Media. By October of 2010 KIT digital controlled 25% of the $500 million dollar internet video platform business. By 2011 KIT was buying every competitor, with deals that were a mix of stock and cash. The companies included Kewego, KickApps, Kyte, TXT Polymedai and ioko.\n\nThen it all came crashing down.\n\nOn November 21, 2012, KIT Digital said it would restate prior financial statements for 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 and cash burn grew dramatically. They canceled their 2012 shareholders meeting, and on December 11, 2012, NASDAQ halted trading. Tuzman left the company in April of 2012, and by April of 2013 the company had filed for bankruptcy.\n\nThree years later - on September 7th, 2015 - Tuzman was arrested along with this former CFO. New York federal prosecutors charge that Tuzman and the former CFO, Robin Smyth, \"conspired to mislead investors and regulators about the company’s financial health.” The company is now known as Piksel. Tuzman is named in the indictment as conspiring with an unnamed hedge fund operator to using match trades to inflate the share price so KIT could purchase its own stock surreptitiously. If convicted on the most serious charges, Tuzman could be looking at 20 years in prison.\n\nIn hindsight, it makes sense. Tuzman didn’t learn any lessons from seeing his failed startup projected up on the big screen at Sundance. But the film, and the Kit Digital meltdown, provides a healthy cautionary tale in this world of overinflated startups and massive valuations.\n\nThe irony is that the video space is red hot and had Tuzman focused on building a business rather than using accounting and inflated valuations to lure in unwitting victims, he might well be the smartest guy in the room. The shame is that a long list of hardworking entrepreneurs were drawn in, and had their promising startup journeys cut short by Kit Digital’s promise of big exits and stock-driven growth. If I’ve learned anything from following this drama from the outside it’s this: there’s no shortcut to startup success. Instead, it’s hard work and focus on providing value.\n\nIn the end, it comes down to building businesses that provide real value to customers, and staying focused on the enterprise, not the endless adrenaline of roll-ups and transactions."
