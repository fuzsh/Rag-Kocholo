        "text": "In 2015, SAP developed a novel CSR project called the KickApp Cup. The project uses football to engage disadvantaged youth and SAP employees in tech-powered social initiatives. Driven by the belief that mobile technologies can be a true game-changer in the way football-based development programmes operate, SAP has teamed up with streetfootballworld to take the KickApp Cup global.\n\nSao Leopoldo, Brazil marked the first stop in this global journey. Here, around 60 SAP staff and young participants from the streetfootballworld network split into smaller teams to take part in a design thinking session aimed at creating ideas for the development of socially-conscious football apps.\n\nTeam Gol da Vida ultimately created the winning prototype with their 'Hope' application. This app represents a technological solution to support organisations in the field of football for good. It enables social workers, teachers and football coaches to efficiently manage the profiles, participation rates, performance and social development of youth that need our support. Though it was a close contest, the jury unanimously voted for Hope as the winning concept. This means team Gol da Vida has now qualified for the KickApp Cup Final next summer in Lyon during the EURO 2016!\n\nAs part of the final, the team will also visit SAPÂ´s Head Office in Walldorf, Germany, where they will be joined by the winning teams from all other KickApp Cup events working together in a final app solution supporting football for good programmes all over the world.\n\nVisit the streetfootballworld website for more information\n\n[This article has been edited by the Operating Team]"
