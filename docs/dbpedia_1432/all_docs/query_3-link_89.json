        "text": "Maintaining the attention span of a toddler should be an Olympic sport. These little tikes are old enough to make their boredom known, but they’re not great at articulating what they actually want. That's why being able to entertain them is key, and Entertainment Weekly is here to help with a list of the 30 best movies for toddlers streaming right now.\n\nWe considered many factors when compiling this list: appropriateness for toddlers, moral lessons, and how well parents can tolerate the movie on its 20th (or 50th) rewatch. That's a lot to balance, but plenty of great kids’ movies manage to pull it off — including the ultimate classic, The Wizard of Oz, and newer favorites like Encanto and Trolls. Check out the best movies for toddlers and where to stream them below.\n\nDisney+\n\nEncanto (2021)\n\nEW’s critic described Encanto as \"a multi-generational magical epic\" that encompasses what’s great about Disney — namely the vibrant colors and incredible music (we absolutely want to talk about Bruno!). It's not a princess-in-distress narrative, though, and instead centers on Mirabel (Stephanie Beatriz), the middle, non-powered child of a magical family. Encanto has a great message about inner strength and recognizing your gifts even when they aren't the most obvious to everyone else. And the songs are so good, you won't actually mind seeing the film a few hundred times.\n\nWhere to watch Encanto: Disney+\n\nMoana (2016)\n\nIf you’re ranking Disney movies by soundtracks, don’t sleep on Moana. Not enough people appreciate that \"How Far I'll Go\" is an absolute banger. EW’s critic considers Moana to be a \"pitch-perfect addition to the animated Disney canon,” seeing the titular character (Auli'i Cravalho) traverse the sea to save her island while promoting feel-good messages about overcoming self-doubt. Get your toddler on the Moana train now so they'll be properly pumped for the sequel, which sets sail in November.\n\nWhere to watch Moana: Disney+\n\nFrozen (2013)\n\nLet it go? Your toddler absolutely won't be able to once they see Frozen for the first time. The 2013 hit reinvigorated Disney for a new generation, starring Broadway legend Idina Menzel as ice princess Elsa and Kristen Bell as her bubbly younger sister Anna. When Elsa decides that running away is best for the kingdom and her loved ones, Anna has to step up to save her. It's a story about sisterhood with great songs and excellent side characters, including the beloved snowman Olaf (Josh Gad) and Sven, the charming reindeer pet of Anna's love interest Kristoff (Jonathan Groff).\n\nWhere to watch Frozen: Disney+\n\nThe Little Mermaid (1989)\n\nThere are several classic animated Disney films that could have made this list, so consider The Little Mermaid a stand-in for those. Is the tale of Ariel (Jodi Benson) learning the true value of her voice relatable? Definitely, but it's also driven home by the legendary score and music from Alan Menken. Slip on those fins and show your toddler how cool it is to be \"Part of Your World.\"\n\nWhere to watch: The Little Mermaid: Disney+\n\nRatatouille (2007)\n\n2024 has been declared the year of the rat boy, but before Josh O'Connor and Mike Faist represented these trending heartthrobs, Remy (Patton Oswalt) from Ratatouille led the rodent renaissance. If you live anywhere near a Disney park or have been on TikTok in the last six months, then you know this modern classic is having a moment, don't let your toddler be behind the times. Introduce them to Remy, a Parisian rodent who dreams of becoming a Michelin star chef. This is a movie about chasing your dreams and sticking it to the haters, and it’s also one of the best Pixar films of the century.\n\nWhere to watch Ratatouille: Disney+\n\nCoco (2017)\n\nLike trying to avoid explaining how babies are made, Coco helps parents sidestep the nitty-gritty details of what happens when we die. It follows Miguel (Anthony Gonzalez), a young boy with a passion for music who accidentally finds himself in the Land of the Dead. Miguel finds a guide and sidekick in Hector (Gael Garcia Bernal), a charming trickster trying to return to the land of the living. The two embark on a dazzlingly colorful adventure that reveals the real story of Miguel's family and teaches everyone to hold on to the ones they love.\n\nWhere to watch Coco: Disney+\n\nNetflix\n\nMinions (2015)\n\nMinions aren't just characters, they’re a phenomenon. This self-titled spinoff movie doesn't get the same love as its Despicable Me predecessors, but let’s appreciate the degree of difficulty here: making protagonists out of a bunch of sidekicks who speak in gibberish. Minions doesn’t shy away from that challenge, using them as a slapstick comedy troupe who guide us through the history of villains and conquerors from the beginning of time to 1960s London. The movie is less complicated than Despicable Me and ups the silly stuff, making it perfect watching for a toddler without forcing parents to explain things like moral ambiguity.\n\nWhere to watch Minions: Netflix\n\nThe Boss Baby (2017)\n\nThis \"surprisingly complicated\" film, according to EW’s critic, will keep your kid laughing at funny babies in suits and suitcases, but it also has jokes that parents will enjoy. The Boss Baby is not a prestige animation, but there aren't a lot of movies on this list that can effectively entertain young kids and the adults in charge of them. This is one the whole family can enjoy.\n\nWhere to watch The Boss Baby: Netflix\n\nTrolls (2016)\n\nLong before the world tour was ruined, Trolls became an unexpected hit that has since launched multiple films and an extended TV universe. Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake voice odd-couple trolls Poppy and Branch, who are forced to work together to save their friends when the troll-eating Bergens return, determined to have a troll feast. According to EW’s critic, the movie is \"a child-safe orgy of body glitter, Day-Glo dance parties, and group hugs\" that teaches kids how to accept differences in others and collaborate.\n\nWhere to watch Trolls: Netflix\n\nMy Little Pony: A New Generation (2021)\n\nThe one is for the horse girls… or the soon-to-be horse girls. A new generation of colorful ponies go on an adventure when friendship is replaced by fear in Equestria at the beginning of My Little Pony: A New Generation. Disney alums Vanessa Hudgens and Sofia Carson lend their voices alongside Ken Jeong and James Marsden in this sparking tale of kinship and found family.\n\nWhere to watch: My Little Pony: A New Generation: Netflix\n\nPinkFong & Baby Shark's Space Adventure (2019)\n\nThis may be a movie you dread being on repeat, but it's a huge hit with the toddler crowd. The infamous Baby Shark takes the hijinx to space with her best friend PinkFong in this cute romp. There are many Baby Shark adventure films set under the sea, but this one could help you inspire an astronaut baby early on.\n\nWhere to watch PinkFong & Baby Shark's Space Adventure: Netflix\n\nThe Land Before Time (1988)\n\nSome may say that showing your toddler The Land Before Time is perpetuating generational trauma, but maybe being heartbroken by this movie is simply a rite of passage. Will the image of Littlefoot trying to nudge his mother awake create an indelible memory for every youngster who watches? Yes, but The Land Before Time will also create an everlasting fondness for dinosaurs through a story about friendship and determination.\n\nWhere to watch The Land Before Time: Netflix\n\nAmazon Prime Video\n\nMinions: The Rise of Gru (2022)\n\nDid you think that one Minions movie was enough? Think again! This entry gives us the inside take on how Gru (Steve Carell) became the villain turned doting father we know and love from the Despicable Me franchise. It goes a bit deeper than Minions, making it more enjoyable for parents while still giving toddlers something entertaining and fun. If your child latches onto Minions, it's good to have multiple movies in the rotation to scratch that itch so you're not watching the same one on repeat.\n\nWhere to watch Minions: The Rise of Gru: Prime Video\n\nDaniel Tiger's Neighborhood: Tiger Family Trip (2012)\n\nDaniel Tiger is a new toddler generation favorite, but he will not grate the nerves like Cocomelon or Caillou. In this extended adventure, the Tiger family takes a trip to Grandma Tiger's house. It is a blissfully brisk 51 minutes long, as Daniel Tiger helps illustrate how big the world is around us and how fun it can be to explore it with your loved ones.\n\nWhere to watch Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood: Tiger Family Trip: Amazon Prime Video\n\nThomas and the Magic Railroad (2000)\n\nObviously, if we are going to include choices for aspiring horse girls, then we are also going to take care of the toddler train enthusiasts. Could a list of little kid movies really be complete without the most famous talking tank engine of all time? There are plenty of Thomas movies out there, but Thomas and the Magic Railroad strikes the balance of the nostalgic look of the train but with modern finishes. EW’s critic praised its \"winsomely ingenious design\" that will draw in toddlers and parents alike.\n\nWhere to watch Thomas and the Magic Railroad: Amazon Prime Video\n\nStellaluna (2002)\n\nChances are your toddler is already familiar with the charming fruit bat Stellaluna thanks to the classic children's book featured in almost every public and pre-school library. It was adapted into a movie that follows the eponymous bat as she's separated from her mother and adopted by a group of birds before finding her way back home. It's an adorable adventure about the importance of family, making friends, and appreciating the feeling of home.\n\nWhere to watch Stellaluna: Amazon Prime Video\n\nParamount+\n\nPAW Patrol: The Movie (2021)\n\nIf you haven't heard of Paw Patrol, then we have to wonder if you even have a toddler in your life. In their first cinematic adventure, Ryder (Will Brisibin) and his heroic friends must band together to save Adventure City from the havoc-wreaking Humdinger. The Paw Patrol crew is beloved among toddlers, and parents can also appreciate how the movie tackles ideas of courage, vulnerability, teamwork, and problem-solving.\n\nWhere to watch PAW Patrol: The Movie: Paramount+\n\nBlue's Big City Adventure (2022)\n\nIn this feature film, the world's favorite mystery-solving puppy heads to the Big Apple to pursue her Broadway dreams. There's lots of singing in this adventure, plus cameos from Blue BFFs of the past, including the OG Steve Burns. Blue's Big City Adventure will likely be nostalgic for many parents while also being a fun watch for the toddler in your household.\n\nWhere to Watch Blue's Big City Adventure: Paramount+\n\nThe Rugrats Movie (1998)\n\nEvery '90s kid probably already has this on their list because there’s nothing that screams toddler to a millennial more than Rugrats. The first feature film about Tommy Pickles introduces a new Rugrat into the mix: Tommy's little brother Dylan \"Dil\" Pickles. Tommy doesn't do too well with Dil's arrival, but an accidental adventure forces the two to bond. Eventually, Tommy steps up to be the great older brother we knew he could be.\n\nWhere to watch The Rugrats Movie: Paramount+\n\nDora: Say Hola to Adventure (2023)\n\nIf your toddler loves Daniel Tiger and wants more appropriate adventure programming, you should introduce them to one of the greatest baby explorers since Tommy Pickles: Dora. In Say Hola to Adventure, Dora and Boots are back, looking for missing items and exploring the jungle with new animation and tricks. The movie special is a kick-off to the revamped Dora TV show, which launched earlier this spring. That means there are more episodes of Dora to accompany the movie once your toddler is hooked.\n\nWhere to watch Dora: Say Hola to Adventure: Paramount+\n\nPeppa Pig: Adventures Around the World (2024)\n\nPeppa Pig and PAW Patrol are popular in the same circles, which means streaming them in tandem could help avoid a total toddler meltdown. Adventures Around the World is a new extended special featuring the playful pig. In the hour-long film, Peppa and her family take viewers around the globe to Hollywood, the Eiffel Tower, and the Great Barrier Reef, introducing kids to incredible worldly sights while playing games and inviting fan-favorite characters from the TV show to join in the fun.\n\nWhere to watch Peppa Pig: Adventures Around the World: Paramount+\n\nPeacock\n\nThe Secret Life of Pets (2016)\n\nThe Secret Life of Pets is another kids’ movie about cute dogs and their animal friends, but with a voice cast that includes Kevin Hart, Jenny Slate, and Eric Stonestreet, you can also count on plenty of jokes made for parents. It follows Max (Louis C.K.), who thinks he's living the best life until his owner adopts another dog, Duke (Stonestreet). When the pair get into a scrap with a group of derelict alley cats, they wind up in a truck heading for the pound. Now, these pals must make new friends and put aside their differences to return to their plushy New York City apartment.\n\nWhere to watch The Secret Life of Pets: Peacock\n\nThe Lorax (2012)\n\nIt’s never too early to introduce a child to the multitalented Taylor Swift. With The Lorax, you can endear your toddler to Swift and Dr. Seuss while teaching them about pollution. This is an expanded adaptation of the classic Seuss book about a man, the Once-ler (Ed Helms), who nearly destroys his town by deforesting the Truffula trees to make popular “thneed” garments. Ted (Zac Efron) recounts the story of The Lorax to help the environment rebound and win over the girl of his dreams, Audrey (Swift).\n\nWhere to watch The Lorax: Peacock\n\nSpirit: Stallion of the Cimarron (2002)\n\nThis is another one for the horse girls. Many will say that this is the pick for the horse girls, and it’s hard to deny it. Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron is up there with Black Beauty when it comes to converting little kids into equestrian fanatics. It’s a little more grown-up than My Little Pony, but still appropriate for young kids to watch. The supposedly untamable Spirit is determined not to be broken after he encounters mankind for the first time. He's intent on becoming a hero of the Old West as he explores the American frontier, managing to find new friends and love along the way.\n\nWhere to watch Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron: Netflix\n\nBob the Builder: The Legend of the Golden Hammer (2009)\n\nIf mystery-solving dogs aren't your thing, try construction workers and machines. In this feature film starring the popular fix-it-man Bob the Builder, he joins Spud the Scarecrow and Scrambler the ATV to hunt for Pirate Brickbear's golden hammer. It's a problem-solving movie that will bring out the inner sleuth in any tiny tot you're trying to entertain.\n\nWhere to watch Bob the Builder: The Legend of the Golden Hammer: Peacock\n\nMax\n\nThe SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (2004)\n\nEveryone’s favorite sponge got his first movie in the early 2000s, which saw SpongeBob and Patrick Star thrown on a chaotic adventure under the sea that reminds them what it means to be best friends. It's the same nautical fun you remember from the TV show — so great for toddlers — but also packed with big celebrity cameos like Jeffrey Tambor, Scarlett Johansson, and Alec Baldwin.\n\nWhere to watch The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie: Max\n\nPonyo (2008)\n\nThis selection is for the prestige toddlers out there. Ponyo is not widely regarded as the best Studio Ghibli film, but it’s arguably the most accessible for younger audiences, making it the perfect entry point. Described by EW’s critic as \"emotionally profound and visually thrilling,\" Ponyo is about a young goldfish princess who dreams of becoming human after she befriends a human boy named Sosuke.\n\nWhile it’s usually sacrilege to recommend the dubbed version of films over subtitles, it’s probably a necessity for the toddler audience. It won't be painful, though, because Studio Ghibli recruited heavy hitters Liam Neeson, Tina Fey, Cate Blanchett, Lily Tomlin, and Matt Damon for the English voice cast.\n\nWhere to watch Ponyo: Max\n\nThe Wizard of Oz (1939)\n\nWhen informally polling toddler parents for this list, one movie consistently popped up: The Wizard of Oz. The story of Dorothy (Judy Garland), who is suddenly not in Kansas anymore after riding a tornado to the land of Oz, has been enjoyed by little kids for nearly 100 years. The songs are almost as iconic as the journey conducted by Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Cowardly Lion, and the Tin Man to corner the coveted Wizard of Oz. Pro-tip: If your toddler is prone to nightmares, fast-forward to the color part of the movie because Margaret Hamilton's Toto-stealing Almira Gulch is still terrifying.\n\nWhere to watch The Wizard of Oz: Max\n\nThe Peanuts Movie (2015)\n\nThis movie can’t replicate the nostalgia of the original Charlie Brown specials, but it is a solid introduction to Charlie Brown and the Peanuts gang for a new generation. Adults may find the polished animation jarring, but it's just what toddlers today are used to, making it easier for them to engage with the forever underdog that is Charlie Brown (here voiced by Noah Schnapp).\n\nWhere to watch The Peanuts Movie: Max\n\nThe LEGO Batman Movie (2017)\n\nIn the center of the venn diagram of the best kids’ movies and best Batman movies sits The LEGO Batman Movie. The LEGO characters are cute and quippy, the mature jokes cater to adults, and your toddler can enjoy a superhero adventure without excessive violence. It's also a surprisingly emotional dig into what makes the Dark Knight the cynical hero he is — until the story forces him to open his heart to create his Justice League and save the day."
