        "text": "Raymond and Elizabeth Becket : Raymond Becket was a former slave who came to our area prior to the Civil War with the assistance of the Underground Railroad. The 1860 Census lists Raymond, a day laborer, born in Virginia in 1818, and his wife Elizabeth, a washerwoman, who was born in Pennsylvania in 1820. The household also included a son, George Becket, Louisa Williams (age 17), and Sarah A. Brown of North Carolina (age 100). Sarah was also likely to have been a former slave. The family bought a log cabin, which was originally built as a fishermen’s shack, on the riverbank. The location was undeveloped at the time, between where Edgewood and Oakford Avenues are today. Years later, William Taubel built two stone mansions near this location. About 1857, Becket apparently sold the structure, which was then moved to 215 Holly Street below Third Street. The structure was enlarged several times by successive owners. It was owned by Theresa Murphy in 1976, and is still in wonderful shape, largely due to renovations by current owner (in 2006) Bob Scheetz.\n\nJohn Bishop (1778- ?): Born in Lumberton on June 17, 1778, a few days before the Battle of Monmouth, to Robert and Jane Bishop. John was descended on his mother’s side from a full-blooded Indian girl of the Lenni Lenape tribe who had assumed the English name of Mary Carlisle. She married Richard Haines, one of three Haines brothers who had emigrated from Northamptonshire, England, and were the original settlers of Burlington County. In 1784 the family moved to the north side of the Rancocas Creek where it empties into the Delaware, ground on which Delanco was later built. John was an avid swimmer and skater, and trapper of foxes, muskrat and mink. It was said he frequently swam to the island that came to be known as Hawk Island to bring geese home to his mother. John raised chickens and sheep. He was ten when his father died. John was educated in a log schoolhouse in the pine woods. At age 16 he taught school for a year on what was later called the Moorestown – Camden Turnpike. He went to live and farm with his brother, then moved to Philadelphia and clerked for Harry Moliere, who had a ropewalk in Kensington. About this time he made the acquaintance of banker and philanthropist Steven Girard, founder of Girard College. Then Bishop went into partnership in the plumbing business with a Mr. Couslan, assuming control of the business when Couslan died. Bishop later teamed with a Mr. Sparks to establish Bishop & Sparks Plumbing located on Delaware Avenue in Philadelphia. Just prior to the War of 1812 the firm went from plumbing to the manufacture of shot, and a 150 foot shot tower was built in 1808 on Montrose Street in Southwark. The firm manufactured shot for the Mexican War. John sold his interest in the company in 1813 and bought the Ogston farm outside Columbus, New Jersey. He lived there for the rest of his days. John married (first) Mary, daughter of Joseph and Hannah Ridgway of Mullica Hill and (second) Ann Black. This account comes from The Memorial & Genealogical Cyclopedia of New Jersey (1910); pp 627-629.\n\nJoseph W. “Joe” Burk (1915-2008) : Joseph William Burk was born in 1915, brother of James Burk. Joe, a one-time farm boy, was a single sculls champion of the 1930s who became a leading figure in American rowing and a highly decorated PT boat skipper in World War II. The Burk brothers grew up on a family farm in Delanco near the Bridgeboro Bridge, land that later became Holiday Lakes. Joe and Jim became fascinated with rowing while watching the collegiate championships on the Hudson River in 1930. They developed powerful arms by training with weights at gyms and climbing down ladders at the family farm with 50-pound baskets of apples. They rowed year-round, sometimes amid floating ice. “Many’s the time I practiced on Rancocas Creek in New Jersey when the spray would freeze on my sweatshirt,” Joe once told The New York Times. After rowing on the University of Pennsylvania varsity eight, Joe turned to the single scull in the mid-1930s while competing for the Penn Athletic Club. The Amateur Athletic Union presented him with the Sullivan Trophy as the nation’s leading amateur sportsman in 1939 and cited him as “natural, unaffected and unspoiled” and “a fine example of young American manhood.” Joe Burk won both the United States and the Canadian single sculls championships every year from 1937 to 1940. Competing for the Penn Athletic Club of Philadelphia after having been captain of the Penn crew, he was a two-time winner of the Diamond Sculls at the Henley Royal Regatta on the Thames in England. His time of 8 minutes 2 seconds at Henley in 1938 eclipsed the longstanding record time there by 8 seconds. When he returned to Philadelphia, he was cheered by thousands of fans who lined the banks of the Schuylkill to watch him take a celebratory row. Mayor S. Davis Wilson presented him with a wreath. A parade was held in his honor in Riverside, attended by an estimated 30,000 people from the surrounding towns. When Burk won the Diamond Sculls again in 1939, his trophy went on display at the World’s Fair in New York. Burk was known as the robot rower for his ability to maintain a steady pace of some 40 strokes a minute, using a relatively uncommon upright stance. At one point he won 37 consecutive races. Burk was expected to win an Olympic gold medal in 1940, but the outbreak of World War II brought the cancellation of the Games, which were scheduled for Helsinki, Finland. Photos of Joe are in the Delanco archive. During WWII, Joe commanded a Navy PT boat in the Pacific, staging raids that sank 26 Japanese supply barges between November 1943 and January 1944 off New Guinea and New Britain. He was awarded the Navy Cross, his service’s highest award for valor after the Medal of Honor, for raids in the face of enemy bombings and shore-battery attacks, and for two “secret missions far behind the enemy lines.” He also received the Silver Star and the Bronze Star. Joe’s brother, Jim also commanded a PT boat, but was killed in a “friendly fire” incident. Joe married after the war. His wife, Kay was the sister of the second in command on his PT boat. Their children included Kathryn (McCaffrey) of Scottsdale, Arizona, and Roger, of Troy, Montana. He had two grandchildren. He was an innovative rowing coach at Penn from 1950 to 1969, taking his crew to victory in the 1955 Grand Challenge Cup at Henley and to three consecutive varsity eight Intercollegiate Rowing Association championships in the late 1960s. He helped pioneer weight training for rowers and the use of electronics to measure the contributions of individual oarsmen on a boat. Kay died in 2001. Joe died Jan. 13, 2008 in Scottsdale, at the home of his daughter Kathryn, with whom he had been living. He was 93.\n\nAlbert and Edna Carr : Albert Edwin Carr who was born in Wilmington, Del., about 1900. Edna Olivier Meeds was born in 1901 in Ingleside, Md. to Frank O. and Maggie Anderson Meeds. The Meeds owned a grocery store in Price, Md., where they were active in establishing a new Methodist Church. Albert married Edna in 1922. They originally settled in South Amboy, N.J., where Albert worked for Dupont Chemical. They had seven children: Marilynn Elaine (married Daniel H. Cannon) was born in South Amboy. The family moved to Philadelphia where Albert founded Carr Chemical Company in a row of garages behind their home. Children, Alberta Edwina (Brunner), Judith Edith (Marlin), Mary Elizabeth (Pippitt), Margaret Eloise (Hall), and Albert Edwin Jr., were all born in Philadelphia. The family moved to Beverly to a home on 71 Church Street where William Ellsworth was born. Albert established Carr Chemical on Manor Road. In 1941 the family moved to the grand three-story Victorian at 721 Delaware Avenue in Delanco, where they remained until 1973. The estate included a tool shop, chicken coop, and a picturesque stone pump house at the back of the property on the north side of Second Street. On the south side of Second Street they built a two-story carriage house and established an extensive garden. Mary and her husband Al Pippitt built a small house in the garden (now 210 Holly Street), where they lived for several years before moving to Medford Lakes. Albert served on the Juvenile Board in Delanco. In later years, Albert sold the chemical company to one of his employees. The family purchased the Spray Beach Hotel on Long Beach Island and the family ran it for several years. The hotel burned after Albert retired, but was it was later rebuilt and expanded. Albert died in 1973. Edna sold the mansion and moved to 1405 Second Street, were she lived for many years. She died in 2000 at age 99 in New Albany, Ind., at the home of daughter Marilynn Carr Cannon. Albert and Edna are buried in Evergreen Cemetery, Moorestown.\n\nJoseph B. and Sallie Carter, Sr. : They were married in 1878. Parents of: William, Charles, and Joseph B. Carter, Jr. The Carters owned a farm between Burlington Avenue and the railroad where the M. Joan Pearson Elementary School is today. Carter built a grocery store and home on the corner of Poplar and Vine. He had five large coal bins and a barn on the property. Their son attended Minnie Flack’s private school at Walnut and Hickory, and the Carter’s donated the chairs at the school. Carter owned three horses, one to deliver groceries and two to deliver coal. He also rented the horses to the township for roadwork. Carter was very active in township administration. He kept vital statistics for the town and issued birth certificates, marriage licenses, and death certificates. He served on Township Committee in 1879 through 1882. He also served as president of the Library Association in 1882 serving until at least 1893. Joseph was a charter member of the Delanco Town Hall Association in 1884. Joseph was appointed postmaster on May 9, 1889 and served until 1893. He was reappointed in August 7, 1897 and served until 1897. In 1890 he was one of the organizers of Delanco Building and Loan, serving as its first president. He served on the board until his death in 1924. The Carters were listed in the business directories for 1895 and 1897. He served as township assessor and township treasurer from 1919-1924. Mr. and Mrs. Carter were listed in Boyd’s Philadelphia Blue Book for 1891-1892. Joseph died in 1924.\n\nAndrew “Andy” Collum (1846-1940): Andrew Collum was born in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, to one of the earliest families to settle in the Commonwealth. At age 12 he launched a theatrical career in Vaudeville. At age 14 Collum enlisted in the Union Army as a drummer boy and saw the conflict through to its conclusion. He was an eyewitness to Lee’s surrender at Appomattox in 1865, and was the last surviving participant to have done so. After the war, he returned to the Vaudeville stage. Collum was known as a leading banjoist and had a comedy act with the famous John Drew of Philadelphia. He went on to manage a New York theatrical house and engaged for the first time, as amateurs, the famous team of Weber and Fields. Collum started Lew Dockstader as a black-face comedian, thus launching an era of blackface minstrels. He was a close friend of Jerry Cohan, father of George M. Cohan. He also left a legacy of popular music to the American musical scene. His many pieces included “Life Is But a Deck of Cards,” “Kick Me Again,” “The Widow,” and “Get Thee Gone, Jane.” When he retired from the stage, Collum operated a bowling alley in Delanco on Walnut Street between Laurel and Mulberry Streets, and a small pool hall around the corner. The bowling alley was later renovated into four row houses, which remain to this day. Collum was a representative of the Grand Army of the Republic at countless Memorial Day Parades in Riverside. His first wife, Ida Madigan was a circus bareback rider. His second wife Mary Jane died in 1937 shortly after their 50th wedding anniversary. Children surviving his death were: Mamie Fenimore and Annie Collum, children of his first marriage; and Wilbur “Hap” Collum, John, David, Mrs. Francis Stack, Mrs. Hazel Yearly, and Mrs. Anita Ballinger, children of his second marriage. Andrew also had a son, also named Andrew, who drowned at age 9. When Collum died after a stroke in 1940, a headline billed him as “The greatest banjo player in the United States.” He was also the oldest member of the Elks, having joined the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks in 1873. His daughter, “Aunt Neddie” Ballinger was living in the family home in 1976.\n\nWilliam and Elizabeth Fenimore Cooper : William Cooper (1754-1809) was born in a log house the Quaker community of Smithfield, now Somerton, now part of Northeast Philadelphia. He moved to Byberry to work as a wheelwright. In 1774 he married Elizabeth Fenimore, the daughter of a wealthy and landed Wellingborough Quaker family, in Burlington County. Elizabeth was unschooled and signed documents with a mark. They wed young, and it is significant that they were wed in a civil ceremony. Her father gave the new couple substantial lands near the Great Road (now Route 130). The Coopers established a store -- some say a tavern -- and a small community known as Cooper Town about 1787. The area is now part of Edgewater Park Township and remembered mostly from the 1806 Cooper Town Meeting House which remains on Cooper Street. In 1789, the Coopers moved to Burlington City where their son, future author James Fenimore Cooper, was born in 1789. In 1790, William moved the family to Otsego County in upstate New York, where they established a second village called Coopertown at the foot of Lake Otsego. In 1795, William was elected to the Fourth U.S. Congress which was, at that time, seated in Philadelphia. The family returned to Burlington County and William constructed a grand waterfront estate as befitting a Congressman. He commuted to Philadelphia by boat in fair weather. Tradition places the estate on the Delaware riverbank in Delanco just west of present-day Union Avenue. He lost the 1797 election, but returned to the Sixth U.S. Congress. The family lived in Delanco from 1895-1897 and 1799–1801, after which the estate was sold and the family returned to Coopertown New York. William was later appointed a judge in Otsego County. William traveled extensively and was away from home for long periods. Elizabeth did not care for the cruel winters in upstate New York. Probably for these two reasons, Elizabeth insisted on wintering in the relative comfort of Burlington City, where the family rented property on High Street. William died in 1809.\n\nThomas J. and Theresa Proscia Daddino : Tom Daddino (1915-2007) was born in Beverly in 1914 and graduated from Burlington City High School in 1934. In high school he led the basketball team to the Burlington County Championship and earned 1st Team All-Star Honors. He also played varsity baseball, which offered him an opportunity to dream about a professional baseball career. He had several tryouts with Connie Mack’s Philadelphia Athletics. He ultimately played and managed Class “D” baseball with Pokomoke City Red Sox in the Eastern Shore League. He also played professionally with the Blue Ridge and Shenandoah Leagues and holds a record in the Professional Baseball Hall of Fame. He served in the U.S. Army and played for the U.S. Army Greys while stationed in Europe, and played before the Royal Family in London, England. After WWII, he returned to the US in 1948 he married Terry Proscia (1923-2006) of New York. Tom and Terry lived in Delanco for many years. Children are: Lorraine (and Craig) Robinson; Thomas (and Marianne); David (and Sandie); and Daniel. Tom remained active as an umpire and youth manager with several local programs and was inducted in the Burlington City Athletic Hall of Fame. Tom worked for the U.S.Postal Service from 1952 to 1982. Terry was employed by Riverton Country Club and Mount Laurel Hilton. Tom enjoyed golf and bowling in his retirement. The couple was active in St. Peter’s Parish. Terry was a member of Catholic Daughters of America and Tom was active in the St. John Neumann Knights of Columbus Counsel 1436. He was a member of the Lambert T. Lambert VFW Post 3020. In 1977, the family resided in the historic home at 401 Ash Street. In later years they lived in Riverside. When Terry died in 2006 at age 83, the couple had been married for 58 years. Tom died in 2007 at age 92. He is buried in the Veteran’s Memorial Cemetery in Arneytown.\n\nEd Diggs (1867?- ?): Ed Diggs claimed to have been born in Spotts, Virginia in 1867, although he never had a birth certificate to prove it. He moved to New Jersey with his mother in 1898 and lived in Charleston (now Willingboro). He moved to Delanco in 1905 to work as Dr. Weiler’s handyman and chauffer, and worked for him for 17 years. When he began the job, this entailed hitching and driving a coach and horses. In later years he drove some of the first Cadillacs and Oldsmobiles to be seen in town. In 1912 and 1914 he traveled to Puerto Rico with Dr. Weiler and drove for him there, Dr. Weiler having brought his motorcar with him by steamship. After the death of his employer, Mr. Diggs worked for the Keystone Watch Case Company for five years, then for the Krusens on the riverbank for nine years. During the Depression he worked for the WPA. After the Depression Diggs became the local “fish man,” peddling fish he bought in Philadelphia. During World War II he worked at Fort Dix. After the war, he used his truck to collect and salvage junk, and remained a junkman until his retirement. In 1975, Ed Diggs was the oldest resident of Delanco, at a reported age of 108. Ed married his wife Bettina when he was 83 (though he told her he was 67). He attended church regularly until he became crippled with arthritis in later years. He was honored by township officials as Senior Citizen of the Year 1973. Edward Diggs lived at 519 Buttonwood, a home that was over 100 years old in 1975.\n\nMicajah and Mary Brock Dobbins : Micajah Dobbins (1809-1886), a descendant of immigrants from Belfast, Ireland, was an important moving force in Delanco beginning about 1850 and remained so for the rest of his active life. He was born in 1809 to Joab and Elizabeth Dobbins; Brother to Zebodee and Samuel who lived in the far west. He married Mary Ann Brock (1810-1892), the daughter of Oddy and Amelia (Lydia) Hammell Brock in 1830. They had three sons: George, Wesley, and John. Micajah operated a market and produce stall on Race Street in Philadelphia until about 1840. In 1850, he bought a home and established a general store at 400 Poplar (corner of Franklin Street) in Delanco. Micajah served as Delanco’s first postmaster when a post office was established in 1857 and served until 1860. He was appointed surveyor of highways in 1859, serving with Charles R. Fenimore. He served on the township committee from 1864-1872, and served as Justice of the Peace in 1867. He was a founder of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Delanco. In 1855 he served as leader of the Methodist Society’s first class meeting, forerunner of the United Methodist Church, which was incorporated in 1858, and remained active in the church his entire life. Micajah and Mary served in the first class of trustees, and Micajah served as Sunday school superintendent. Micajah enjoyed the occasional opportunity to preach in substitution for his son, George, just as George substituted for his father. In 1909 the Delanco Methodist Church was renamed Dobbins Memorial Methodist Episcopal Church in his honor. The 1860 Delaranco map shows their home and store at 400 Poplar Street (Lot #107 on Wilmerton’s Delaranco Map). It lists Micajah as Postmaster and dealer in general merchandise. The 1860 Census lists Micajah as a store operator. It also lists children George (age 22) telegraph operator, and Wesley (age 17) clerk. Third son, John is not listed. Sermon in Glass notes the Dobbins moved into a new home in Delanco in 1866. The 1870 Census lists him as an insurance agent with real estate valued at $12,000. He was ordained Deacon in the same year. The 1876 Delanco Business Directory lists M. Dobbins as a pickle merchant. It is presumed he operated his pickle factory on the site of the former Wilmerton Sawmill on Poplar and Franklin. Micajah deeded the homestead farm to his son Wesley in 1873, and they sold their house, storehouse, and other buildings to George W. Perkins. Micajah died at the home of his son Wesley in Camden in 1886 at age 78. Mary Ann died in 1892.\n\nThomas “Tommy” and Kathryn Fitzpatrick: Renowned decoy carver Tommy Fitzpatrick (1887-1958) was born in 1887 to Henry J. and Emma Fitzpatrick. He spent his early childhood on Pennsylvania Avenue in Delanco. He loved the outdoors and life along the river. It was here that friends introduced him to hunting, fishing, and boating. He later worked as a shoemaker in Philadelphia. His family was very musical. His father was a violin teacher in town. Tom had a wonderful ear for music and learned to play piano and accordion. During the war he worked at a shipyard in Philadelphia where he became a craftsman. He is believed to have carved his first decoy about 1910. Kathryn (Katie) Rogers Whitsell was the adopted daughter of Amos and Martha Whitsell and worked in the Ridgway Shoe factory as a young girl. In 1916, Tom married Kate and they moved into an unusual home. It was a houseboat that he built and dry-docked on property leased from the Stocktons on the River at Delaware Avenue between Cedar and Willow Streets. At that time there was no specific address for the property; Mail was simply addressed to them at Delanco, N.J. Their granddaughter recalls their home was like a dollhouse, a small but tidy place without running water. Kate was a meticulous housekeeper and wonderful cook. In the 1926 and 1929 Delanco directories, Tom was listed simply as a fisherman living at 428 Delaware Avenue, but he was much more than that. They lived off the land in their cabin on the water, building, repairing and renting rowboats and boat slips, selling bait, trapping and hunting ducks, fish and turtles for the market. Tommy’s true love, however, was carving decoys from whatever wood he could find. Tommy was well liked by everyone he met. He would cross the Rancocas Creek to the Riverside Inn, play his accordion, sell miniature carvings, and take orders for his working decoys. Influenced by the lifelike carvings of John English, Tom carved over 2000 decoys in his lifetime. Children recall sitting in his shanty, listening to stories he would tell as he worked. Tom was a small, quiet spoken man who never raised his voice or said a harsh word to anyone. His decoys have become real collector's items, currently fetching $10,000 to $15,000 at auction. Examples can be found in maritime museums in the Northeastern States. The Fitzpatricks raised their only son Tom Henry Fitzpatrick here on the riverbank and Kate was living at that location as late as 1975. After Tom’s death in 1958, his wife finally sold the houseboat to a man who worked for a dredging company. The new owner simply floated the unit at high tide and towed it away on the river. Granddaughter, Kate Fitzpatrick, has served as Delanco’s mayor, but proudly considers herself a “river rat,” like her grandparents.\n\nGeorge Q. and Annie M. Hammell: Rev. George Q. Hammell (1859-1933) was born in Philadelphia. He was a local preacher, wholesale seed grower, commission merchant, and lumber dealer in Delanco. In 1894, Rev. Hammell established George Q. Hammell Co. on Coopertown Road where Stylex Manufacturing Company now stands. He was also a wholesale seed grower operating as George Q. Hammell Seed Farms, Inc. Mr. & Mrs. Hamill (sic) were listed in Boyd’s Philadelphia Blue Book for 1891-1892. George was listed in the Delanco business directories for 1895 and 1897. In 1898, S.S. Pancoast became manager and treasurer of the Hammell firm, assuming entire control of its affairs. He changed the name to Delanco Farm & Lumber Co. George married Annie about 1880. Annie was born in 1856. Rev. and Mrs. Hammell were received by Dobbins Methodist Church in 1890. Mrs. Annie Hammell joined the Epworth League, an organization of the young people of the Methodist Episcopal church, and was elected 4th Departmental Vice President on the original slate of officers under Rev. Grovatt in 1890. George served as President of the Epworth League in 1895. In 1898, George became one of the founders and served as the first treasurer of Fletcher’s Grove Camp Meeting Association. Annie died in 1949. Both are interred in Lakeview Cemetery. The Hammells lived at 231 Union Avenue at the corner of Third Street, the home occupied as of 2008 by Tom and Dina Lewandowski. The Hammells built a second, smaller home for George’s mother behind the house at what is now 516 Third Street, the home in 2008 occupied by Dennis and Susan Bryski. This structure was once part of a dormitory at Fletcher’s Grove Camp Meeting. The building was cut in half and moved to the Third Street location. The late Dr. Hammell Shipps was named in honor of Rev. Hammell. The 1929 directory lists George and Annie at 416 Third Street. Annie died in 1949. George and Annie are buried in Lakeview Cemetery in Cinnaminson.\n\nMargaret “Peg” Norcross Fenimore Hunter (1904-): *Born Margaret Norcross in Philadelphia. Peg recalls that as a young girl she frequently passed Delanco as she traveled by steamboat from Philadelphia to Trenton (for 25 cents). She said it reminded her of a beautiful lovers’ land. Peg married William Fenimore and moved to Delanco in 1927. She became active at Dobbins Memorial Church in 1943.

She was also a charter member of the Riverfront Historical Society, A signatory of their incorporation papers in 1982. Her address was 610 Union Avenue. She was frequently referred to as Delanco’s historian. Peg was referred to as Delanco’s own Historian and one-man chamber of commerce in a Philadelphia Inquirer article in 1984. She was 80 years old when interviewed for a Burlington County Times article in 1984, and 82 in a BCT article written in 1986, by which time she had moved to the Masonic Home in Burlington. She was still listed as a member of the Local Assistance Board in 1990. She gave another extensive interview to the BCT in 1990 as a follow-up to a testimonial dinner given in her honor at Washington Fire Company. She was 86; the mother of four, grandmother of seven, and great-grandmother of 14. Peg Resided in Delanco for 63 years.\n\nFranklin “Frank” P. Jones, Sr. (1846-1934): Frank was the son of Paul and Deborah Jones (see below). The 1860 Delanco Census lists him (age 13) living with his parents. Frank married Jemima “Mima” Fortnum in 1872, at which time they constructed a roomy Victorian home at 1827 Burlington Avenue. The lot was likely a gift from his parents. On the 1876 map of Beverly in the J.D. Scott Atlas, a residence belonging to F.P. Jones is shown at the end of a long lane near the Delaware River northwest of Burlington Avenue. The home would be near the riverfront end of present day Peachtree Avenue at Second Street. The original home is still standing. Their children were: Clarence E. (1873-1936), who remained single and was a newspaper reporter and sales agent for an advertising company; Laura S. (1877-1903), a school teacher; Gertrude (1882-1935), a school teacher who married Henry Neely ; Cora May (-1866); Frank P. Jones, Jr. (1885-1961). Frank served on the township committee and served as Township Clerk from 1889 to 1893. He was also a member of the Library Association.

Henry and Rebecca were listed in the 1850 Census living in Kensington 5th Ward in Philadelphia with children, John and George; also Conrad Miller, a rope maker. Henry was considered a master wharf builder. It is possible Henry Kreiner & Sons first came to Delanco to construct the cribbing and rubble steamboat wharf at the foot of Union Avenue in 1850. The wharf stood until 1969. The family moved to Delanco about 1852. About 1855 Henry Kreiner & Sons built the Delanco Hotel & Tavern on Rancocas Avenue behind the original train station and train bridge over the Rancocas. The hotel served as a convenient spot to wait on a cold night for the arrival of a train. The hotel appears on the Delanco map of 1859 (spelled Briner).

Family reports that he did not receive much formal education. He was interested in early flying machines. In 1910 a New York Times newspaper article identified Henry Neely as chairman of the Exhibition Committee of the Aero Club of Philadelphia. His organization offered a $1,000 inducement to exhibit the aircraft that won the Chicago to New York air race. Henry was a talented writer. He was sports editor for the Philadelphia Evening Ledger, then one of the best newspapers in the country. According to Riverside, New Jersey: 150 years of Progress, Neely was listed as a newspaper executive there, when, in 1912, he made a pitch for the Boy Scouts, a new organization then forming across America. Neely was on the Court of Honor of the Philadelphia Boy Scouts of America. As part of his efforts to “sell the Boy Scout movement,” Neely would invite young men onto his yacht for a trip down the Delaware and a sales pitch on the merits of Scouting. As a result, the group decided to organize a troop of Scouts in Riverside, registered in 1913 as Troop 1. According to The Delanco Story: Its Past and Present, from 1922-1926, Henry Neely was authorized to operate special land radio station 3XP from Delanco, communicating by Morse code with the tugboats traveling up and down the Delaware River. The station was located on the Rancocas Creek at the foot of Buttonwood Street where Crane and Hartley earlier had their boat yards. He continued writing for thePhiladelphia Evening Ledger, contributing a regular movie column. He also published a magazine called E-Z Radio. Henry married (1st) a singer from New York named Agnes. The couple frequently entertained visitors from the New York arts scene. It is reported that she did not enjoy small town life. The 1926 Directory listed Henry and his wife Agnes on Rancocas Avenue at Buttonwood Street. Neely was listed as Manager of the Radio Home Experimental Station. They also had a houseboat and kept a yacht on the Rancocas at the old shipyard. According A Sermon in Glass, in 1926, Neely entered into a partnership in the flower business with Gertrude Jones (1882-1935), the daughter of Franklin and Jemima “Mima” Jones of Delanco. Gertrude studied psychology and earned a teaching degree from the University of Pennsylvania. She taught classes on mental disorders in the area and, later, in Havana, Cuba. They purchased 30 acres of the old Fenimore farm near the “Halfway House” on Burlington Avenue. They built greenhouses and a retail outlet and operated it as Rancocas Valley Flower Farm. Henry was later shown in residence there. Through Gertrude’s family, Henry was provided connections into local business and social circles. Shortly thereafter, Henry Neely found fame as the “Philco’s Old Stager” of New York radio. In 1927 he served as host of the Philco Hour on NBC Radio, carried initially on 26 stations. In 1928 he wrote the lyrics to Mem’ries (Golden Memory Days) and That’s the Song of Songs for Me. In 1929 Henry married (2nd) his business partner, Gertrude Jones. A contemporary news item says the romance had simmered for 16 years. At the time of the wedding, he was 50 and she was 47. They met when Henry, a speedboat enthusiast, camped on the riverbank near the Jones homestead. The fabulous wedding took place at the Presbyterian Church of Beverly. A special rail car brought Henry’s friends in from New York. Playwright, Innis G. Osbourne was best man. Both of his theme songs were performed at the wedding by Jessica Dragonette, the Philco Chorus, and the New Yorkers Quartet under the direction of Ed Smalle. Wedding notices described Neely as a newspaperman, radio pioneer, aviation promoter, and magazine writer. Gertrude died at home in Delanco in 1935 after a lengthy illness. Henry moved to New York City. He hosted the Manhattan Merry-Go-Round radio show in 1936. According to Ted Codding of Beverly, The Philco Hour and Manhattan Merry-Go-Round were forerunners of the Lucky Strike Hit Parade. But Neely’s career took yet another unexpected turn. In spite of his lack of formal education, Henry M. Neely became an astronomer, long-time lecturer, and teacher at the venerable Hayden Planetarium in New York. He became known as “the Dean of New York Stargazers”. He wrote several books on astronomy, including A Primer for Stargazers (1946), which went to multiple printings, and Stars by Clock and Fist (1956). Family reports Henry married a third time. He died at home in New York in 1963 at age 83.\n\nIsaac Newton (1800–1867): It is known that Isaac Newton was born on March 31, 1800 and lived for a time in what is now Delanco Township, Burlington County, where his family had roots. He was the son of William Newton, Grandson of Daniel Newton, and great-grandson of Samuel Newton. He received a common-school education, and after his marriage, moved to Springfield, Delaware County, Pennsylvania, where he established his first dairy farm. Here he soon became known for the neatness, order, and productivity of his land, and he eventually ranked among the model farmers of the Commonwealth. By his mid-20s he was managing two farms in Springfield that were so successfully that he opened a confectionery shop and sold ice-cream made from his dairy surplus. Newton also developed a select butter enterprise which led to unusual consequences later. Isaac quickly became a member of his local agricultural association and was frequently sent as a delegate to the meetings of the United States Agricultural Society. He introduced into the organization a resolution urging Congress to establish a national Department of Agriculture. He also brought the plan to the attention successively of Presidents Harrison, Taylor, Filmore, Buchanan, and Lincoln, whose personal acquaintance he enjoyed. He shared his special dairy products with the White House, arranging weekly shipments of select butter to the Lincolns. Lincoln finally arranged for adoption of his scheme. In 1861 President Lincoln appointed him supervisor of the agricultural division of the Patent Office. When the agricultural bureau had been authorized by Congress in 1862, Lincoln naturally offered the commissionership to Mr. Newton (The position was not made a cabinet position until 1889). Isaac and his family maintained a close relationship with the Lincolns, and he became a personal confidante of Mary Todd Lincoln. Newton continued to serve in this position under President Andrew Johnson, holding the office until his death. In his annual reports, he emphasized the importance of weather and climate to agriculture. Isaac Newton died of the effects of sunstroke while working in the Department of Agriculture’s experimental fields in Washington, D.C. on June 19, 1867.\n\nStacy Stratton Pancoast (1860-): Stacy was born in Chester Township, Burlington county, March 5, 1860. He was a seventh generation descendant of Rev. Samuel Panckhurst (Pancoast) who came to West Jersey from England in 1676. Rev. Panckhurst was a signer (along with William Penn) of the Concessions & Agreements of the Proprietors of the Province of West Jersey. Stacy was the third child and only son of Edward Hackney and Rebecca A. (Bishop) Pancoast, and lived in Delanco. He was educated in the schools of Riverton, Farnum Preparatory School at Beverly, and graduated from Crittenden Commercial College in Philadelphia in 1878. He worked in Philadelphia as a clerk and bookkeeper for several years, after which he went into the office of W. Frederick Snyder for three years. In November, 1884, Stacy married Mabel D. Garnes, daughter of Henry D. and Matilda M. Garnes, of Camden. One child: Harry G. Pancoast, was born in 1885 and died in infancy. In 1885 he opened an office for himself in Philadelphia, where he conducted a real estate and conveyance business, until 1888, when he went to Alabama on account of his health. In 1892 he went to West Virginia, where he built a mill and carried on the lumber business for three years. When his mill was destroyed by fire in 1895, he returned east and settled in Delanco, taking a position as assistant manager to The George Q. Hammell Co. The firm was established on Coopertown Road in 1894 as a large lumber, coal, farm supply, millwork, paint, and hardware operation. Pancoast changed its name to Delanco Farm & Lumber Co. when he assumed control, and more than doubled the volume of business. He added several large sheds and an additional two-story warehouse. In 1898 he was made manager and treasurer of the company. In 1907 they completed a large railroad trestle and siding. The firm was sold to John Jenkins in 1916 and burned to the ground in a spectacular fire in 1918. The firm was later sold to Ralph Carlton, who moved the operation to Wood Lane at the railroad in Edgewater Park. Pancoast was a Republican, and a member of the Masonic order, of Merchantville Lodge, No. 33, of the Boudinot Royal Arch Chapter, No. 3, of Burlington county, of the Helena Commandery, Knights Templar, No. 3, of Burlington, and a member of the Improved Order of Red Men., the Tacoma Tribe of Delanco Redmen; Washington Camp, No. 35, Patriotic Order Sons of America, of Delanco.\n\nM.

Joan’s first year of teaching was at Broad Street Girls School in Coventry. In 1948 she immigrated to the United States with her parents. She taught for one year at the Woods School in Langhorne Pennsylvania, one year at Moorestown Friends School and four years at the Pen Ryn Episcopal School located in Andalusia, just across the Delaware from Delanco in Pennsylvania. By this time she acquired enough college credits for her New Jersey Teaching certificate and had earned her U.S. Citizenship. She came to the Delanco schools in 1954. For the first few years she taught 5th and 6th grade while she completed her master’s degree in reading at Temple University. She became the district’s reading specialist K-9 for most of her tenure in Delanco. She continued her graduate studies at Temple and attained accreditation in Learning Disabilities, Classroom Supervision, and Principal. In January 1979 she assumed the role of Principal of Burlington Avenue School. In addition to her duties as principal, she still performed the role of reading specialist as well as basic skills coordinator and affirmative action officer. Though her professional attributes were many, her fellow staff members and generations of students remember her for her warm, caring, and compassionate manner of living and working. Joan was killed in a plane crash during a trip out of the country in November 1987. Delanco honored her memory by renaming Burlington Avenue School the M. Joan Pearson Elementary School in 1987.\n\nFrank B. and Violet Pennington: Frank Pennington (1904-1994) was the son of William B. Pennington. He attended local schools and continued the family farming tradition. His father purchased 133-acre family farm from the Hunter Family right after WWI, about 1919. Frank married Violet about 1931. Frank inherited the farm from his father. The Penningtons grew vegetables, tomatoes, cantaloupes, soybeans, watermelons, and corn. They employed many of the local teenagers and many Polish women from Riverside when the crops were ready for harvest. He was a landowner and farmer was active until shortly before his death at age 90. The historic farmhouse that was located off Creek Road was one of the oldest in Delanco, over 100 years old in 1975. Frank left the farm to his two twin daughters, Joan Timlin and Jean Snyder. In 1999 the farm was purchased from Joan and Jean by Burlington County to preserve it as open space, part of the Rancocas Greenway project. It was subsequently converted into a county park. The Pennington farmhouse was demolished. After some environmental cleanup and recreational development, the park opened to the public on April 19, 2006. The site of the Pennington farmstead is commemorated with a creekside overlook that is open to the public.\n\nAgnes Margaret Bohnberger Perkins (1903-1993): Agnes was born in Philadelphia to Frederick and Elizabeth Biggard Bohnberger. Agnes’ twin sister Margaret and brother Raymond died in the diphtheria epidemic of 1906. Agnes contracted the disease, but was given the diphtheria antitoxin and survived. Other siblings were Edna, William, and Walter. Fred worked for Caleb Clothier in Philadelphia and first came to Delanco on business trips. The Bohnberger family moved to Delanco permanently in 1913 and lived and operated a boarding house for a time in the three-story Victorian at 229 Willow Street. In 1918 Agnes joined the Epworth League at Dobbins Memorial Methodist Church and was elected Secretary. She also served as Superintendent of the Junior League. She taught music at Farnum School in 1926 until she married George Wesley Perkins III in 1927. Their sons are George Wesley IV (1928-1991), and Dr. Franklin Elwood Perkins (1929-). Agnes began service as organist choir director for Dobbins United Methodist Church on Easter Sunday in 1926, and served for 62 years. Her early musical studies were in Philadelphia. She later studied with Mrs. Fred Fisher, the organist at Delanco Presbyterian Church. Agnes served as accompanist for the Male Chorus and pianist for the Mitchell Concert Orchestra. She also sang with the mixed quartet. Generations of Delanco children studied piano with Ms. Perkins at her home at 300 Union Avenue at the corner of Third Street. Agnes later taught in Cinnaminson Elementary School, then joined Mildred Magowan and taught math in Edgewater Park. She eventually became supervisor, then Principal in Edgewater Park. All told, she taught for 27 years. Agnes served as President of the PTA in 1937. She served as treasurer for the Delanco Camp Meeting Association for 34 years. Agnes served on the Delanco Bicentennial Book Committee in 1975-1976. Agnes wrote a memoir, Remembrances, published in 1988. She died in 1993 at age 90.\n\nClifford R. Powell, Esq. (1893-1973): Clifford Ross Powell was born in 1893 in Lumberton. He earned his law degree and was listed as a lawyer with a Mount Holly firm. One source indicates he lived in Mount Holly for a time. Powell served gallantly in two world wars. He served in WWI. He organized and commanded the 50th armored division of the New Jersey National Guard, the New Jersey Blues, attaining the rank of General, and went on active duty during World War II. He commanded them through many battles in North France and became a highly-decorated war veteran. He rose to the rank of Major General, and earned the French Croix de Guerre. It is not yet clear when the Powells moved to Delanco. They were not listed in the 1926 Delanco Directory, but the 1929 directory lists Clifford and his wife Irene living on Delaware Avenue east of Lilac Lane. Other sources indicate the family lived in one of the Taubel mansions, 915 Delaware Avenue. He became a director of First National Bank of Riverside. He served for a time as Delanco Township Solicitor. He served in the state legislature in the 1920's and 1930's. He represented Burlington County in the New Jersey Assembly from 1920–1927 and served as Speaker of the New Jersey Assembly in 1925. He served in the New Jersey Senate from 1928–1939, and as Senate President 1934-1935. He was the Senate President on January 3, 1935, when Governor A. Harry Mooreresigned to take his seat in the United States Senate. Powell became Acting Governor that day and served for five days; the Senate reorganized on January 8th and Horace Prall became Senate President and completed the remaining week of Moore's term. Harold Hoffman had already been elected Governor in the 1934 election and succeeded Prall on January 15th, but history still regards the 41-year-old Powell as a former Governor. He also spent many years as the Burlington County Republican Chairman, and served as the Chief of Staff of the New Jersey National Guard during the post-War administration of Governor Alfred Driscoll. In a move that became the major political scandal of the time, Powell perpetrated one of the greatest swindles in the history of New Jersey. And he did it all in one day, October 22, 1948. Powell and a few of his friends started the morning by purchasing the privately-owned Tacony-Palmyra and Burlington-Bristol bridges for $6 million. Later the same morning he convened a meeting of the Burlington County Board of Freeholders (which he seemingly controlled) and had it create the Burlington County Bridge Commission. Immediately after creating the Commission, Powell (through the Freeholders) appointed the members of the Commission. After lunch, the Commission held their first meeting and voted to float a $12 million bond issue. By the end of the day, the Commission had sold their bonds and used the money to purchase the two bridges from Powell and his friends. In one day, Powell’s consortium made a $6 million profit. Ultimately the deal became the subject of an investigation; Powell was forced to resign from Driscoll's cabinet and return his profit to the Commission. But the state Supreme Court ruled that since the bonds had already been sold, it would be unfair to the bond holders if they were to shut down the Commission. Powell is a mere footnote of New Jersey political history, but the Burlington County Bridge Commission continues to run the two bridges it purchased from Powell. Clifford Powell died in 1973. His portrait appears on page 110 of The Delanco Story.\n\nAlexander Rhodes (1842-1934): Alexander Rhodes was a crew member of the USS Alligator who lived for a time in Delanco. He was born in Bordeaux, France in 1842 and immigrated to America in 1859. He immediately became involved with the de Villeroi infernal machine (submarine) Alligator and stayed with the project until the government took it over in 1860. When it was doing trials in the Rancocas, he stayed at the Delanco Hotel. From 1860 to 1863 he had charge of the submarine until it reached Fort Monroe. In 1860 he is found living at the Chandler Hotel in Marcus Hook at the same hotel as inventor Brutus de Villeroi and other engineers from the submarine project. He was hired as an operative in November 1861. According to May 18, 1861 articles in the Bulletin and Philadelphia Inquirer, Alexander Rhodes and Henry Kreiner were arrested by Philadelphia port security while attempting to transport the de Villeroi infernal machine (submarine) from Delanco to the Philadelphia Navy Yard. He later served on the USGB Wissahickon, the Vermont, and the Princeton. He was discharged in June 1864. After his discharge he lived at Buck’s Delanco Hotel for two or three years, recuperating from injury sustained aboard the Wissahickon. He mostly worked at odd jobs in Riverside. He married Rose Rower (1846-1934) in Riverside in 1865. They had five children. He died in the Dayton, Ohio Civil War Soldiers Home in 1920. Rose died in 1934.\n\nAndress J. Ridgway (1832–1924): Andress was born in Pennsylvania and came to Delanco prior to 1860. Andress married Marianne (or Meriam) Wilmerton about 1855. Marianne was born in New Jersey in 1833 to Abraham Wilmerton (1794-1871) and Mary Marter (1797-1878). Children who lived to adulthood were Lourel (sic) or Laura Virginia (1857-1945), Andress Crittenden. (A.C.) (1861-1926), and Annie Eliza (1864-1957) who married Harry Cook. Five other children died in infancy. Andress and Meriam (sic) were listed as members of the 1858 Methodist Sunday School class under Micajah Dobbins, and Andress Ridgway was named to the first Board of Trustees of Delanco Methodist Episcopal Church in 1859. The 1860 Delaranco map shows their home on Poplar Street (about 432). He served for a time as postmaster of Delanco Post Office beginning in 1871. He also served on the township committee and on the county board of freeholders. In 1872 Andress Ridgway was named Superintendent of the Methodist Sunday School, a position he held for the next 37 years. In 1881 he established a shoe factory in a garage behind his home on Ash at the corner of Rancocas. He began with three employees. Three or four years later his son, Andress C. Ridgway (A.C.) became a partner. A. J. Ridgway & Son manufactured shoes for children and infants. The business prospered and expanded. They erected a frame factory building in 1885 next to his home on the Rancocas Creek at the foot of Ash. It was later expanded. Mr. & Mrs. Ridgway and daughters Laurel and Annie were listed in Boyd’s Philadelphia Blue Book for 1891-1892. Ridgeway was listed as manufacturer of infant shoes in the 1895 and 1897 Delanco business directories. AJ and AC Ridgway both became stockholders of Fletcher’s Grove Camp Meeting Association in 1898. By 1907 the plant was shipping about 350,000 pairs of shoes per year and employed 90 skilled workers. In 1912 the firm augmented the wooden structure with a three-story brick building (still standing). At its peak it employed 145 workers. There was a serious fire in 1924 which damaged the frame factory structure; the same year that A.J. died. The shoe business closed in the late 1920s after his death. The Ridgways still had descendants among Delanco’s citizenry in 1976.\n\nRev. George Whitfield Ridout (1870-1954): Pastor of Dobbins Memorial Methodist Episcopal Church from 1897 to 1900. Rev. Ridout was born in Bourne Bay, St. Johns, Nova Scotia in 1870 to Capt. Fred and Elizabeth Ridout. They had eight children. Fred Ridout, a sea captain, was lost at sea in 1873 or 1874, leaving his wife with six surviving children. Family legend suggests he may have been captured by pirates. George followed his fiancée, Mary Smith from St. John’s where he attended Methodist Seminary, to Boston, and later continued his education at Temple University. He married Mary in 1893. The couple moved to Delanco in 1897 where Rev. Ridout served his second appointment. In 1898, Rev. Ridout gathered a group of church faithful to establish the Fletcher Grove camp Meeting Association. The group consisted of A.C. Ridgway, George Q. Hammell, Edward S. Hunter, and Charles E. Fletcher. After leaving Delanco in 1900, Rev.

Ed was an avid sailor, winning two Thistle National Championships (1961 and 1963) and numerous regional and local championships in his Thistle #818Dan E. Boy, with his family as crew. Ed was incredibly intelligent and was quite ahead of his time in terms of sail and boat design. There are not too many people out there that have the understanding of design and have the ability to apply it like Ed. Ed was quite capable of doing everything to make his boat perform and win races. This included cutting and designing his own sails, building his own blocks and cleats. He also became a small plane aviator for business and pleasure. In his later years Ed traveled all over North America in his RV, developing diverse interests including golf, golf club making, and jewelry making. When Ed died February 9, 2007 he had ten grandchildren and one great-grand child. Ed was buried at Odd Fellows Cemetery in Burlington Township.\n\nHarry K. Weiler, MD (1856-1921): In the early days, Dr. Weiler was the only doctor in town and he practiced dentistry as well as serving as a physician. At one time his fee for office visits was 50 cents. Dr. Weiler married Anna E. Wells, the daughter of Isaiah and Elmira (King) Wells of Bridgeboro and sister-in-law of Hiram D. Torrey. Dr. & Mrs. Weiler were listed in Boyd’s Philadelphia Blue Book for 1891-1892. Dr. Weiler practiced in Riverside and Delanco as late as 1915. Dr. Weiler ran a pharmacy on Scott Street in Riverside. He also served for many years as Justice of the Peace and was active in Riverside politics. His residence and office were at 400 Buttonwood (corner Franklin). Ed Diggs was employed as Dr. Weiler’s handyman and chauffer for 17 years . The Weilers frequently traveled, even overseas, and took their limousine and driver with them. Diggs told stories of these trips.\n\nRichard Fenimore Wilmerton (1811-1891): Richard was born in Willingboro in 1811; son of Fenimore Wilmerton (1878-1823) and Penilla Van Kirk (1797-1865); grandson of Paul F. Wilmerton (1753-1827) and Rebecca Fenimore Wilmerton (-1829); who married in 1778. This seems to be the first and the only Wilmerton marriage recorded in Burlington County prior to 1800. Richard was surveyor by trade and a prominent landowner whose holdings ran along the Rancocas River from the Delaware River to the railroad. His first wife Elizabeth Heisler was born in Pennsylvania in 1820. It is assumed they married about 1838. In 1845 Richard surveyed and laid out the Borough of Beverly, and the town that would come to be known as Delanco. He drew plans for a village and procured a charter for it, calling it Delaranco. Under the direction of Morris and Pettit, he surveyed and built the Mount Holly and Beverly Plank Road. In 1848 Wilmerton sold a large tract of land bordering the Rancocas Creek to Thomas S. Fletcher. This sale was considered the first property conveyed by deed under the government of the State of New Jersey. In 1852 he erected a large steam powered sawmill on the Rancocas Creek at the foot of Ash Street. The location of the sawmill was convenient since logs could be floated down the Rancocas, converted into lumber here, and shipped out by rail or river. About 1852 Richard developed the remaining farmland as “Wilmerton’s Delaranco Lots.” This tract lay bounded by Burlington Avenue, the Camden & Amboy Railroad, Rancocas Creek and Walnut Alley, plus a strip of land along the Rancocas Creek west of Burlington Avenue. He set aside land on Union Avenue between Hickory and Chestnut Streets as a public square and town hall. Richard and Elizabeth were members of the very first Sunday school class in 1855 led by Micajah Dobbins, and are considered among thefounders of the Methodist Church. He was named to the first Board of Trustees in 1858. On the Delanco maps of 1859 there is a structure labeled R.F. Wilmerton on the north side of Rancocas Avenue just east of Burlington which appears to be his personal home. The 1860 Delaranco map shows R.F. Wilmerton owned properties at 406 Poplar and on Hickory north of Walnut. In the 1860 Census he listed himself as a farmer. Besides Richard and Elizabeth, the household in 1860 contained four children: Richard (20) a horticulturist, Rachel (18) a needlewoman, Charles (13), and Richard B. (age 1). All the children were born in New Jersey. Also listed are Ellen Pedrick (age 59) needlewoman, and Josephine Roadhouse (age 8). The Wilmerton family history lists an older son, Israel Putnam Heisler Wilmerton, who would have been 21 at the time of the 1860 Census. The home on Rancocas appears at the same location on the map of 1875, but under the ownership of J.D. Watson. A brother of Elizabeth lived in Charlestown, Maryland. When the sawmill failed about 1883, Mr. Wilmerton took his family to Charlestown to live. The sawmill property was turned into a pickle factory, presumably operated by Micajah Dobbins. It eventually burned down. Richard’s son, Charles, returned to Delanco and remained here. Richard married (2nd) Emeline Hancock of Burlington. A local notice, dated December 26th, 1891 reads, “Richard F. Wilmerton, an old and respected citizen died in Burlington on Sunday evening, in his 80th year.”\n\nGeraldine Diehl Wilson (1904-2001): A descendant of John H. Diehl and E.S. Diehl. Geraldine attended Wharton School of Business of the University of Pennsylvania. She began her career as a paralegal in Philadelphia, but later became a real estate developer, and blossomed into a philanthropist. Geraldine was in her 50s when she married William Wilson. Geraldine was an only child and had no children of her own. In 1984 she established the Geraldine Diehl Wilson Foundation and the annual Geraldine Diehl Wilson Scholarship for students of Delanco and Riverside who planned to attend University of Pennsylvania. Geraldine lived all her life in a cozy riverfront home at 410 Delaware Avenue at the foot of Cedar Street, she called Windswept. The home was built originally a farmhouse built by Abraham Perkins in 1748 and is considered to be one of the earliest in Delanco. It was acquired in 1838 by James W. Wallace, a partner in the Delanco Land Company. Wallace expanded the home in 1848, but incorporated the farmhouse into the plan. John H. Diehl, Geraldine’s grandfather, purchased the property in 1856 and it has been in the Diehl family ever since. In 1925 Geraldine’s father John Diehl told her that portions of the home were at that time nearly 200 years old. The structure appears on the Delanco maps of 1859 and on the map of 1875 as owned by the Estate of E.S. Diehl. Geraldine died in 2001 at the age of 97 and was buried in Monument Cemetery. Wilson Way, a street in Newton’s Landing, was named in memory of William and Geraldine Diehl Wilson.\n\nTheophilus Zurbrugg (1861-1912): Theophilus Zurbrugg was born in Switzerland in 1861; He immigrated to America and settled in Mount Holly. In 1880 he moved to Philadelphia and founded the Keystone Watch Case Company there. He transferred his manufacturing operation to Riverside in 1892, building an imposing plant next to the Pavilion Avenue Hotel. He married Lizette Mueller, a former Red Cross Nurse of Riverside, and constructed a home at Franklin and Taylor Streets behind the factory in Riverside. He suffered a debilitating stroke in the early 1900s. In 1898 Zurbrugg founded Riverside Metal Works behind the Watch Case factory. About 1910, Zurbrugg acquired several adjoining properties on Delaware Avenue running through to Second Street, bounded by Union and Willow Streets. Zurbrugg worked closely with noted architect Frank Furness of Philadelphia to design an imposing riverfront mansion. It was constructed by Hugh B. Miller of Edgewater Park and completed about 1912. Shortly after moving into his new Delanco home, Zurbrugg suffered a second stroke and died from complications. At his death in 1912, Zurbrugg donated his original Riverside home to establish a new community hospital for the residents of Riverside. His estate endowed the hospital, which opened in 1915 as Zurbrugg Memorial Hospital. His wife Lizette remained in the Delaware Avenue home until her death in 1923. The mansion then sold to Mr. and Mrs. E.G. Schwinn.\n\nNon-Human Celebrities\n\nNelly: Nelly the horse figures into the legend of a haunting in Delanco. Back in the days of the Revolutionary War, it is said that a military messenger passing through Delanco on horseback drowned with his horse in a small pond. His horse's name was Nelly, who gave her life and her name to Nelly's Pond. Even though the pond in 2006 is about half the size of the pond in the 1770s, it is believed that even today, while wandering in the woods near the pond at night, you can still hear the drowning horse crying out.\n\n-- Peter Fritz"
