Augustine fell to the ground and died in the middle of the street. Friends of Augustine had been involved in a run-in with gang members earlier that evening.

Around that same time, a 1973 tan/gold Mercury Montego was seen driving down the street at high speed.

The house was open, and when the neighbor entered he found both Margaret and Keith bound and badly beaten to death. The Conables' vehicle had been stolen, and radios from inside the home were also taken.
