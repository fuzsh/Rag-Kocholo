        "text": "Exemptions into THE PLAYERS Championship and all four majors in 2025 were among the bonuses for the winner of the gold medal at the men’s Olympic golf competition, but Scottie Scheffler already was all set, thank you.\n\nBecause it can be really easy to take his dominance for granted – because he’s making it look really easy most of the time – it’s worth the reinforcement to state that you’re not reading old news. Indeed, Scheffler won again, this time gold at the Games. With a blistering, bogey-free, 9-under 62, he prevailed by one stroke over Tommy Fleetwood of England.\n\nScheffler now has seven victories in 17 starts in 2024. Although Sunday’s win at Le Golf National isn’t official as it concerns PGA TOUR career totals, that bevy of benefits went with it. A spot in The Sentry also was on the line provided that the gold medalist was a PGA TOUR member at the time, but you don’t need confirmation that Scheffler has qualified for the 2025 season-opening stop at Kapalua Resort six times previously.\n\nIn addition to the updated headline at the top, you’ll find the current qualifiers for all four majors and THE PLAYERS in 2025 familiarly sorted alphabetically below. Beneath them is remaining qualifying criteria that’s more robust at this time of year than the previous two. This is because of the trustable trend experienced in the game in the interim.\n\nAs always, criteria are subject to change – thus the disclaimers atop this page and remaining qualifying criteria – but most of the modifications in time will be in the form of additions such as the dates, sites and details of every stop in the Open Qualifying Series for The Open Championship. All references of “TBD” also will be replaced when possible, but educated estimates were made to retain chronological order. And it’s never out of the realm of possibility that at least one governing body will introduce something new.\n\nArguably the biggest “TBD” refers to the schedule of Signature Events for which the 50 qualifiers for the BMW Championship and who remain eligible will anchor those fields in 2025. That portion will be updated when the 2025 PGA TOUR schedule is released. Of course, you don’t need to think twice; Scheffler will qualify for all of those tournaments, too.\n\nIf you’re new here, thank you for checking it out. This page is updated weekly on Sunday night or Monday morning, and more often when the occasion calls for it. There isn’t an archive, so it refreshes with every weekly update. Therefore, consider bookmarking and adding it to your weekly pages to review.\n\nNOTE: Until all methods of entry are released by the governing bodies, traditional criteria are used to determine qualifiers. Refer to remaining qualifying criteria at the bottom of the page for details.\n\nSE – none\n\nTPC – As noted in the alphabetical list below\n\nMAS – As noted in the alphabetical list below\n\nPGA – As noted in the alphabetical list below\n\nUS – As noted in the alphabetical list below\n\nOPEN – As noted in the alphabetical list below"
