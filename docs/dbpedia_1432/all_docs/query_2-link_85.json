        "text": "Post-Presidency\n\n08.02.2024 In an interview at The National Association of Black Journalists conference he falsely questioned Vice President Kamala Harris‘ racial identity, claiming she “happened to turn Black” a few years ago and suggesting she previously only promoted her Indian heritage. The lie echos his previous racist remarks, such as the “birther” conspiracy theories he promoted against former President Barack Obama.\n\n07.18.2024 During 90-minute nomination acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, he repeats baseless disinformation about transgender women and girls participating in sports. GLAAD’s Voter Poll shows a majority of voters in all parties oppose “a political candidate [who] speaks frequently about restricting access to health care and participation in sports for transgender youth.”\n\n07.10.2024 Campaign website includes formal policy plans called “Agenda 47” that includes a pledge titled “President Trump’s Plan to Protect Children From Left-Wing Gender Insanity.” The Advocate reports, “Trump promised to outlaw gender-affirming care for minors at the federal level, and ‘cease all programs that promote the concept of sex and gender transition at any age.’ He also promised to ban transgender athletes from competing on teams that match their gender identity.… Trump stated that he ‘will ask Congress to pass a bill establishing that the only genders recognized by the United States government are male and female — and they are assigned at birth.’ He then claimed that being transgender was ‘invented’ by the ‘radical left,’ though he did not use the term ‘transgender’ once throughout Agenda 47.”\n\n06.21.24 Announced that if elected for a second term, he would cut federal funding for inclusive schools: “On day one, I will sign a new executive order to cut Federal funding of any school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content onto the lives of our children.” He also announced his intent to target transgender people in sports.\n\n05.17.2024 Recommitted to criminalizing abortion, telling Time that he would not intervene in decisions to monitor or prosecute pregnant people. He refused to say whether his second administration would enforce the Comstock Act, an 1873 “zombie law” that bans the mailing of “obscene” materials, including birth control and “instruments” used for abortions. The act has been unenforceable for the past 50 or so years, largely because it was rendered unconstitutional by Roe v. Wade, which Trump has repeatedly taken credit for overturning.\n\n05.14.2024 Vowed to roll back Title IX protections for transgender student enacted in April 2024 by the U.S. Department of Education “on day one,” if he’s reelected. Trump said: “We’re going to end it on day one. Don’t forget, that was done as an order from the president. That came down as an executive order. And we’re going to change it—on day one it’s going to be changed…. It’ll be terminated.”\n\n04.08.2024 Stated his current position on abortion on his social media platform in a video saying, “My view is now that we have abortion where everyone wanted it from a legal standpoint, the states will determine by vote or legislation, or perhaps both. And whatever they decide must be the law of the land. In this case, the law of the state.” In the same video he made the baseless claim that Democrats want to legalize the “execution” of babies that were already born, which is not true. Trump’s position on abortion rights has changed many times from saying he is “very pro-choice” in 1999, to personally taking credit for overturning Roe vs. Wade in 2022, to saying Florida’s six-week abortion ban is “a terrible mistake” in 2023, to saying he would “be open” to a 15 week ban in 2024.\n\n04.04.2024 Announced he would declare November 5 to be “Christian Visibility Day” after a baseless complaint about Transgender Day of Visibility coinciding with Easter in 2024. Previously Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt issued a statement calling it “appalling and insulting” that Biden “formally proclaimed Easter Sunday as ‘Trans Day of Visibility.’ ”\n\n03.16.2024 Defended Ohio Senate primary candidate Bernie Moreno, whose email address was used to create an account on Adult Friend Finder in 2008 seeking “men for 1-on-1 sex.” Moreno’s campaign said the account was created by an intern as a prank. Trump defended Moreno and claimed “Democratic fake treatment” for the story Moreno’s campaign had confirmed: “We all know this man. He’s a hero, he’s a winner and we’re not going to let these people — these people are sick.”\n\n03.16.2024 Appeared at a campaign rally for Ohio Senate primary candidate Bernie Moreno, sponsored by the pro-Moreno Buckeye Values PAC. The PAC released an ad targeting a Moreno rival as “a champion for trans equality.” The PAC also reportedly sent campaign mail asking “What Team Does Frank LaRose Play For?” and “Is he with us … Or is he with they/them?”\n\n03.04.2024 Endorsed North Carolina Lt. Governor Mark Robinson for governor, despite Robinson’s history of anti-LGBTQ disinformation and rhetoric, including calling gay people “filth” and “maggots.” Trump repeated his past claims that Robinson is “better than Martin Luther King” and “Martin Luther King on steroids.”\n\n02.02.2024 Used vulgar slang to refer to LGBTQ legal icon Roberta Kaplan, who represented E. Jean Carroll against Trump. Trump was found liable for sexually abusing Carroll in the 1990s and for defaming her by mocking her claims after he left the White House. A jury awarded Carroll with $83 million in damages. Kaplan recalled leading the deposition of Trump, saying that at the end Trump’s lawyers asked to go “off the record,” meaning what he said would not be included on the court deposition transcript. Kaplan said Trump then said to her: “See you next Tuesday,” a slang term referring to a word for female genitalia used as an insult for women.\n\n02.20.2024 Supported by the anti-LGBTQ national organization Heritage Foundation with a 180-page document detailing regulations and executive orders to be taken in first days in office, including: “deleting [from federal agencies and federal rule] the terms sexual orientation and gender identity (“SOGI”), diversity, equity, and inclusion., gender, gender equality, gender equity, gender awareness, gender-sensitive, abortion, reproductive health, reproductive rights;” limiting abortion access with executive orders using the Comstock Act — a long-inactive 19th century law that banned birth control and abortion medication by mail. Semafor reported: While Project 2025 bills itself as being “candidate agnostic,” [project director Paul] Dans noted that at this point in the primary, they expect “and hope” that Donald Trump will ultimately end up in office again. NBC News reported that Project 2025 includes representatives from anti-LGBTQ, anti-equality and anti-democracy groups “led by veterans of the Trump administration, such as America First Legal, the Center for Renewing America and the Conservative Partnership Institute, the Claremont Institute, the Family Research Council and the Independent Women’s Forum.” (Links to groups added by GLAAD).\n\n01.10.2024 Boasted of his role in the Supreme Court decision ending the right to abortion by nominating three of the justices who joined the decision: “If it weren’t for me, with Roe v. Wade, you wouldn’t even be talking about this stuff. For 54 years they were trying to get Roe v. Wade terminated, and I did it and I’m proud to have done it,” Trump said. Abortion is an LGBTQ issue: LGBTQ people can and do get pregnant, lesbian young women are two to ten times more likely to become pregnant than heterosexual youth, lesbian and bisexual women are often at higher risk of sexual assault due in part to their sexual orientation, which may also result in an unplanned pregnancy.\n\n12.30.2023 Criticized Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine for vetoing state bill banning essential health care for transgender youth and banning trans youth from school sports, spread disinformation about the care and school sports. DeWine had said his veto was based on conversations he had with parents, patients and providers who told him how the care saves lives. Trump said in a Truth Social post: “DeWine has fallen to the Radical Left… What was he thinking. The bill would have stopped child mutilation, and prevented men from playing in women’s sports. Legislature will hopefully overturn. Do it FAST!!!” Ohio hospitals and providers, along with hundreds of others, had testified that they do not perform surgeries on youth, and Ohio’s school sports association has long had policies to ensure inclusive participation of transgender students.\n\n12.17.2023 Announced on social media, “On Day One [of a second term if he were reelected President], I will sign a new executive order to cut federal funding for any school pushing Critical Race Theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children…”\n\n11.03.2023 Mimicked a Canadian weightlifter in an extended campaign event skit to mock and misgender transgender women in sports, claiming he will “end this on day one” if he’s re-elected.\n\n05.17.2023 Proudly stated, “I was able to kill Roe v. Wade,” taking credit for the Supreme Court overturning the national right to an abortion in the Dobbs decision. The Dobbs decision suggested that the right to same-sex marriage should be reconsidered by the Court as well.\n\n06.11.2023 Said of transgender athletes at a rally, “Who would even think that you can allow this? Who would say that this is okay? These people are sick. They are deranged…. It’s astonishing how passionately people react to that. When you talk about tax cuts, they remain calm. But when you mention transgender issues, everyone goes wild. Who would have imagined five years ago that they wouldn’t even know what ‘it’ meant?”\n\n04.14.2023 Said that if re-elected, he would use the government to investigate and potentially halt transgender health care during a National Rifle Association (NRA) speech. “Upon my inauguration, I will direct the FDA to convene an independent outside panel to investigate whether transgender hormone treatments and ideology increase the risk of extreme depression, aggression and even violence,” said Trump. He also accused Democrats of “pushing the transgender cult” on children.\n\n03.26.2023 Vowed to crack down on “transgender insanity” and pledged to “revoke every Biden policy promoting the disfigurement of our youth” at the first rally of his 2024 presidential campaign. He said that he would “keep men out of women’s sports” if re-elected president, after he last year misgendered transgender athlete Lia Thomas. He added: “I will immediately sign an executive order to cut federal funding for any school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other racial, sexual or political content on our children.”\n\n01.31.2023 Made multiple false claims about gender affirming care, tweeting a so-called “Plan to Protect Children from Left-Wing Gender Insanity.“ Every major medical association and world health authority supports gender affirming care; statements here including from the American Academy of Pediatrics: “There is strong consensus among the most prominent medical organizations worldwide that evidence-based, gender-affirming care for transgender children and adolescents is medically necessary and appropriate. It can even be lifesaving. The decision of whether and when to start gender-affirming treatment, which does not necessarily lead to hormone therapy or surgery, is personal and involves careful consideration by each patient and their family.”\n\n01.29.2023 At a campaign event, falsely claimed and without evidence or fact: “We’re going to stop the left-wing radical racists and perverts who are trying to indoctrinate our youth, and we’re going to get their Marxist hands off our children…We’re going to defeat the cult of gender ideology and reaffirm that God created two genders: men and women. We’re not going to allow men to play women’s sports.”\n\n01.26.2023 Released so-called education policy that cuts federal funding for any school or program that includes “critical race theory, gender ideology, or other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content onto our children.”\n\n11.15.2022 In speech announcing third run for president, baselessly targeted schools for “radical civics and gender insanity” (without defining what those are) and stated inaccurate and inflammatory promises such as “We will not let men, as an example, participate in women’s sports.” Recommitted to his 2017 tweeted ban against transgender Americans serving in the military: “As commander-in-chief, I will get Biden’s radical left ideology out of our military.” President Biden reversed the tweeted order in 2021 in one of his first acts as President. 70% of Americans support allowing transgender Americans to serve in the U.S. armed forces. 66% of active-duty soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines support serving alongside transgender personnel.\n\n08.06.22 Invited activist Riley Gaines on stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) as he baselessly claimed that “left-wing lunatics” encourage unfair competition in sports. Gaines has profited by spreading disinformation about transgender people and athletes after tying for 5th place with a transgender swimmer at the NCAA championships. Gaines went on to endorse Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for president over Trump.\n\n03.01.22 Told a gay supporter they did not “look gay” during a fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago. “Where’s Gays for Trump?” Trump asked a crowd of supporters at the event which was raising funds for congressional candidate John Gibbs. Someone replied, “We’re over here.” Trump pointed at them and said, “You don’t look gay,” which elicited laughs from the audience.\n\n02.24.22 Praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying at a Florida fundraiser, he is “pretty smart… He’s taken over a country for $2 worth of sanctions… taking over a country—really a vast, vast location, a great piece of land with a lot of people—and just walking right in.” In fact the sanctions include: freezing the global banking assets of Putin, various government officials, and some oligarchs; immobilizing the assets of the Russian Central Bank and cutting off Russian banks from business with the U.S.; removing Russia from SWIFT which handles about 70% of Russian banking transactions; barring any new oil and gas deals with Russia; and other sanctions. The effect has been to shrink the Russian economy 35% in the second quarter of 2022 and 7% for the entire year. Despite being outsized and out resourced, Ukraine has stymied or slowed much of the Russian invasion effort. The autocrat Trump praised as “pretty smart,” Russian President Vladimir Putin, signed legislation on 2013 to ban the “promotion of nontraditional sexual relations to minors,” which, writes Human Rights Watch, is “a reference universally understood to mean a ban on providing children access to information about LGBT people’s lives… The law has been used to shut down websites that provide valuable information and services to teens across Russia and to bar LGBT support groups from working with youth. But the law’s effects have been much broader: Individual mental health professionals have curtailed what they say and what support they give to students, and the law gives the strong imprimatur of the Russian state to the false and discriminatory view that LGBT people are a threat to tradition and the family… Its passage coincided with an uptick in often-gruesome vigilante violence against LGBT people in Russia—frequently carried out in the name of protecting Russian values and Russia’s children.” Putin signed legislation in 2021 to constitutionally ban same-sex marriage in Russia.\n\n02.28.21 Told a crowd of supporters that he did not believe transgender women and girls should compete on sports teams consistent with their gender identity, referring to trans female athletes as “biological males,” a term often used by anti-trans activists to suggest transgender people are not who they say they are.\n\nPresidency\n\n01.08.21 The day after Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in a deadly rampage, HHS went public with a final rule to rescind regulations barring discrimination against LGBTQ Americans seeking to adopt or be adopted, or health services including HIV prevention.\n\n12.07.20 Labor Department, led by Secretary Eugene Scalia, announces rule-change implementation to allow federal contractors to discriminate against LGBTQ workers via religious exemption. The rule change takes effect Jan. 8, with 12 days remaining in the Trump administration, and will require a full rule-change process for the new administration to revise.\n\n10.24.20 Report shows U.S. State Department has been omitting information about human rights abuses against LGBTQ and intersex people, as well as information about violence against women and girls. The Asylum Research Center report from the UK says there’s concern the omissions will result in the erasure of abuses used to make asylum claims and decisions, with LGBTQI+ people being returned to dangerous home countries.\n\n10.17.20 Department of Education pressures New Hampshire’s Franklin Pierce University to drop its trans-inclusive policy in athletics. The university agreed to rescind its policy permitting transgender athletes to compete consistent with their gender identity to avoid an investigation by the DOE’s Office of Civil Rights. A civil rights complaint triggering the threat of an investigation was filed by “Concerned Women for America,” a noted anti-LGBTQ hate group.\n\n10.17.20 Tiffany Trump appears at campaign event, falsely claims her father supports the LGBTQ community, ignoring his and his administration’s record of hundreds of attacks against the community. She also omits the “T” when saying “LGBTQ.” The “T” stands for Transgender. LGBTQ advocates see Tiffany Trump’s omission as another example of President Trump and his supporters failure to recognize and support trans people and their very existence.\n\n10.10.20 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, warned by his advance team that an event with the anti-gay Florida Family Policy Council had homophobic advertisements/flyers at the site and that the group promoted dangerous, debunked conversion therapy, appears at October 3 event anyway. State Dept. aides were reportedly appalled at the speaking event and that Pompeo touted it afterward, in a department-wide memo.\n\n10.05.20 On the first day of the Supreme Court’s new term, Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito “take a legal baseball bat” to the court’s 2015 decision legalizing marriage equality, claiming the decision “enables courts and governments to brand religious adherents who believe marriage equality is between one man and one woman as bigots.” Justice Thomas writes that Kim Davis, the public official who had refused to issue marriage licenses based on her religious belief, is a “victim” of a so-called “cavalier treatment of religion.”\n\n09.29.20 President Trump’s son Eric claims that LGBTQ people “come out in full force” to support his father. GLAAD releases a scientific poll of LGBTQ voters showing 76% support VP Joe Biden.\n\n09.26.20 Legal scholars conclude Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett’s resume could make her the most conservative new justice since Clarence Thomas. On gun rights—would probably strike down “red flag” laws to temporarily take firearms away from dangerous people. She has “voiced skepticism about the Affordable Care Act. A “dream candidate” for conservatives focused on overturning abortion rights.\n\n09.26.20 President Trump nominates Amy Coney Barrett to the United States Supreme Court. In her speech, Barrett says she adheres to the same judicial philosophy as the late justice Antonin Scalia. Scalia, who dissented in cases advancing LGBTQ rights, called the Obergefell decision “a threat to American democracy,” and Barrett has similarly stated views against marriage equality, defended dissenters of Obergefell, and delivered speeches paid for by anti-LGBTQ groups. She was vetted for the Trump administration by The Federalist Society, which has argued against every major LGBTQ policy proposal including extending Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to include LGBTQ workers, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, hate crimes legislation, “don’t ask, don’t tell,” and transgender accommodations. At least 11 people at the White House event announcing Barrett later test positive for COVID-19, including President Trump, his wife, former senior adviser, press secretary, the president of Notre Dame University, and two members of the Judiciary Committee who say they will quarantine for ten days, then attend Barrett’s confirmation hearing.\n\n09.18.20 Within an hour of the announcement of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announces “President Trump’s nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate.”\n\n09.18.20 Education Secretary Betsy DeVos vows to withhold federal funds from Connecticut school districts that participate in athletic conference allowing transgender athletes to compete consistent with their gender identity.The move to withhold about $18 million intended to help schools desegregate could have national implications for both transgender athletes and students of color.\n\n09.16.20 Trump administration deploys legal strategy to avoid enforcing The U.S. Supreme Court Bostock ruling extending protections for LGBTQ workers, pushing rules that allow shelters and schools to insist access be based only on gender assigned at birth.\n\n09.10.20 President Trump reveals additions to his list of potential Supreme Court appointees, which include Republican senators who have campaigned against marriage equality, a Trump-appointed federal judge with ties to an anti-LGBTQ organization identified as a hate group, and Trump’s former Solicitor General who has filed briefs and argued before the Court to allow organizations to discriminate against LGBTQ people. Axios reports the list was partly motivated by the Court’s ruling in June 2020 to expand LGBTQ protections in the workplace.\n\n09.08.20 The Trump administration files 36-page brief with Indiana Supreme Court to support a school’s alleged right to fire a teacher for being gay.\n\n08.31.20 White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany falsely characterizes a State Department policy denying citizenship to children of same-sex couples born via surrogacy overseas. McEnany claimed the policy denied citizenship based solely on surrogacy when in fact only LGBTQ surrogacy families had been rejected. McEnany then read what she called the administration’s LGBTQ “achievements,” a list she has previously read and which has been debunked as anti-LGBTQ.\n\n08.28.20 The Trump State Department says it’s reviewing a federal judge’s ruling with the Department of Justice, ordering State to issue a U.S. passport for the daughter of a married gay couple from Georgia and ruling her a citizen since birth. The judge had ruled the State Department policy requiring a biological connection raised serious constitutional questions for same-sex couples.\n\n08.24.20 The Washington Post gives Trump advisor Richard Grenell four Pinnochios for, “The absurd claim that Trump is the ‘most pro-gay president in American history.’” The claims are deemed “whoppers,” and every claim Grenell makes is discredited.\n\n08.21.20 The State Department is fighting a ruling to recognize citizenship of a young girl with gay parents. She was born in Canada via surrogate, and although her parents are legally married and U.S. citizens, the State Dept. argued in federal court she was “born out of wedlock” and therefore not entitled to birthright citizenship. A judge deemed the controversial State policy unconstitutional in June.\n\n08.20.20 The lead U.S. foreign aid agency proposes a new policy on gender and women’s empowerment that eliminates any mention of transgender people or contraceptives, running counter to its own long-standing practices in deciding what programs to support. The draft policy released by the U.S. Agency for International Development doesn’t use the acronym LGBT or the words “lesbian,” “gay,” “bisexual,” “transgender” or “identity” at all. Gender experts and advocates said the new policy falls far short of providing the expertise the agency needs to address gender issues in development.\n\n08.19.20 The Department of Health and Human Services has been systematically discriminating against LGBTQ+ families in federally supported foster care programs, according to a new report from the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee. The committee found that federally-funded agencies were granted a waiver to allow discrimination based on religion and sexual orientation, intentionally harming LGBTQ children, adults, and families.\n\n08.10.20 Jenna Ellis, Trump campaign senior legal adviser and the president’s personal lawyer misgenders Pennsylvania’s Health Secretary. Ellis, who has no apparent medical degree, uses Twitter to mock other efforts to control the pandemic that has killed 163,000 people on President Trump’s watch. Ellis also condemns same-sex marriage and transgender identity, and has tweeted to promote conversion therapy.\n\n07.29.20 Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos visit a private school in Raleigh, NC, lauding its reopening for in-person education despite the coronavirus epidemic. Thales Academy founder Bob Luddy is one of the biggest Republican donors in North Carolina. Luddy also founded Franklin Academy, a Wake Forest charter school that changed its school handbook after criticism of rules prohibiting LGBT discussion or affirmation. Students protested Pence’s visit with signs promoting LGBT rights and remote schooling. Within a week of Pence and DeVos’ visit, students at a nearby sister school had to quarantine after a student tested positive for COVID-19.\n\n07.28.20 Three years after President Trump tweeted out a ban on transgender people in the military “in any capacity,” the White House says he’s sticking with the policy. Each of the military service chiefs testified before Congress in 2018 they had seen no evidence of transgender service disrupting unit cohesion during the period of open service and a Dept. of Defense poll found about two-thirds of active-duty soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines support serving alongside transgender personnel.\n\n07.28.20 The Trump Administration plans to limit work permits for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children from two years to one year. The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in June that the administration could not carry out its plans to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program because it did not provide legal justification for terminating it. Of the 640,000 “Dreamers,” 81,000 identify as LGBT and 39,000 have participated in DACA.\n\n07.27.20 After his administration supported the losing side at the Supreme Court on LGBTQ job protections, President Trump promises to choose from a new list of conservative jurists in his next court appointments. One potential candidate is Kyle Duncan, appointed by President Trump to the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Duncan’s anti-LGBT record includes arguing against trans student Gavin Grimm’s request to use the restroom consistent with his gender identity and arguing against national marriage equality and calling the Supreme Court ruling in favor of it an “abject failure” that “imperils civic peace.”\n\n07.27.20 President Trump’s niece, Mary Trump, says it’s “absurd” that her uncle believes he has support in the LGBTQ community, that he’s uncomfortable with gay people and trans people, because “he’s uncomfortable with anyone that’s different… differently-abled, different color of skin, and different beliefs… He’s not [an] ally of the gay community, or really any community for that matter. Donald doesn’t have any concern or beliefs beyond his own self-interest.”\n\n07.23.20 Trump administration revokes HUD regulation designed to eliminate racial disparities in the suburbs. Housing advocates say Trump’s claims about the rule are inaccurate and racist. Only 30% of Black LGBT Americans own a home compared to 64.3% of the overall population.\n\n07.23.20 Former leader of now-defunct conversion therapy ministry, Exodus International, reveals previous lobbying work he did with members of the Trump administration. Randy Thomas has since denounced conversion therapy and announced his engagement to Dan Scobey. “Given my experience,” Thomas said, “I believe Mike Pence is still supportive of ex-gay ministry and he supports the efforts to try to convert people from gay to straight.” Thomas also references working with Kellyanne Conway and other former Republican leaders, lobbying against marriage equality and hate crime legislation.\n\n07.22.20 Jenna Ellis, senior legal advisor to Donald Trump, retweets an article that promotes conversion therapy. Psychologists worldwide confirm LGBTQ people cannot change their gender identity or sexual orientation through conversion therapy. The American Psychiatric Association condemns such treatment and describes any attempts to change a person’s sexual orientation as unethical. Ellis has a long record of racist and homophobic rhetoric, including criticizing her own Republican party for any attempt to embrace LGBTQ rights after the Pulse massacre killed 49 people, many of whom were LGBTQ.\n\n07.17.20 Defense Department confirms that new guidance to prohibit the display of Confederate flags on military institutions also includes bans on LGBTQ Pride flags. The Modern Military Association of America says the Pentagon is twisting the Confederate flag ban to achieve an anti-LGBTQ goal.\n\n07.17.20 New details emerge from proposed Housing and Urban Development rule limiting access for transgender people in single-sex homeless shelters. According to text from a leaked document obtained by Vox, the rule would allow federally-funded shelters to judge a person’s physical characteristics, such as height and facial hair, in determining access to the shelter. Factors to be considered include “the presence (but not the absence) of facial hair, the presence of an Adam’s apple, and other physical characteristics which, when considered together, are indicative of a person’s biological sex.”\n\n07.17.20 The D.C.

Religious leaders describe the actions as hypocritical and obscene.\n\n05.28.20 Trump administration threatens to withhold funding from states that allow athletes to compete under the gender with which they identify.

A few others claimed it was the first to fly over federal property on a permanent basis. We never made this claim. The media interest in this supposed precedent is what prompted our interest in whether either statement was factually accurate. NPS never pulled our support. The permit was never in question.
