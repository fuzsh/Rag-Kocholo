Films not produced by a country are not considered from that country even if it has been filmed there or if its story is held there (non Turkish \"Istanbul United\" (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3672026/), non Bolivian \"Even the rain\" (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1422032), non Indian \"Slumdog Millionaire\" (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1010048/), non Paraguayan \"Cuchillo de Palo\" (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1641619/), non Afghan The Breadwinner (www.imdb.com/title/tt3901826), non Philippine \"1898, Our Last Men in the Philippines\", non Belizean \"The three kings of Belize\" (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1412670/), and neither Palestine nor Israeli \"Promises\" (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0282864/), for example). Although I love \"Soy Cuba\" (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058604), I also decided not to include it, as it is much more a Soviet film than a Cuban one, but also it is spoken in Spanish and shot in Cuba with Cuban actors; therefore it is a co-production that does not fit very well neither as a Soviet movie nor as a Cuban one. I did not include short films (therefore, 26-minute TV movie \"Mandrake the magician\" (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046619/) cannot represent Bermuda, and short film \"Berta vive\" (www.imdb.com/title/tt7070686) cannot represent Honduras) or TV series either.\n\nSee also my lists of Asian films (http://www.imdb.com/list/ls056850470/), Latin American movies (http://www.imdb.com/list/ls056414005/), Eastern European films (http://www.imdb.com/list/ls058662514/), and movies about Africa (http://www.imdb.com/list/ls056498703/).",
