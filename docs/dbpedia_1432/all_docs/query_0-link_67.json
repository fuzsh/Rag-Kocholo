        "text": "A clothing retailer with 165 stores across the country has come under fire for what some social media users are calling a pullback from their plus-size clothing options.\n\nStruggling Retail Chain Saved From Bankruptcy\n\nForever 21, like many stores that once dominated shopping malls, has seen its share of struggles in recent years. The chain filed for bankruptcy in 2019 only to be bought out of bankruptcy in 2020.\n\nThe group that saved the brand was a combination of a firm called Authentic Brands Group and two real estate companies that NPR reported as being \"America's largest mall operators.\"\n\nThe new owners would go on to partner with online fashion retailer Shein with hopes of revitalizing and expanding Forever 21.\n\nModern Retail reported just two years ago the group hoped to open an additional 14 stores, with a new focus.\n\n\"Part of Forever 21's comeback strategy involves opening smaller, but better-curated stores â€“ a stark contrast to the sprawling Forever 21 locations of the 2000s and 2010s,\" Modern Retail said in its report.\n\nWhy People Are Mad At Forever 21\n\nBacklash against the clothing retailer has mounted in recent weeks following social media posts from frustrated shoppers claiming Forever 21 was pulling back on its plus-size offerings.\n\n\"Forever 21 does not care about plus sizes,\" TikTok user Samyra tells viewers. \"And how do I know this? I went to five different locations here in Los Angeles, and guess how many of them had their plus sizes in store?\"\n\nREAD MORE: Walmart Terminates Discount Opportunity For Some Customers According to Reports\n\nShe then shows herself asking store employees where she can find their plus-size clothing. Many of them point toward a different location.\n\nOther videos noted that Forever 21 recently shutdown it's Instagram dedicated to it's plus-size clothing customers.\n\nForever 21, however, says the move has nothing to do with getting out of the plus-size clothing market. Instead, the chain wanted to combine all of its social media accounts into one Forever 21 account.\n\n\"Our goal is to create an inclusive space where everyone feels at home, regardless of size, gender or race,\" Forever 21 shared on Instagram earlier this week. \"We haven't eliminated Plus or any other product category; in fact, we have actually expanded our offering into categories like Lingerie, Sleepwear, Active and Swim.\""
