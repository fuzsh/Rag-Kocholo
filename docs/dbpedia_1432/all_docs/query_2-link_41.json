Qualifying for Paris was the ‘Hail Mary’ long shot from the get-go.\n\n“I was trying to represent that skateboarding is fun. No matter what age you are – this is the coolest, most fun, inclusive thing you can do.”\n\nMills’ war of words\n\nGeorge Mills admitted he was “probably not allowed” to repeat what he said to France’s Hugo Hay after he was involved in a four-man fall during his 5,000 metres heat.\n\nAfter crossing the finish line, Mills and Hay were seen arguing and making physical contact with the British athlete pointing furiously at the Frenchman.\n\nMills claimed he had been disadvantaged and officials agreed as they advanced the Briton to Saturday’s final following a review.\n\nTweet of the day\n\nPicture of the day"
