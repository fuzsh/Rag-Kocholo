        "text": "Named for the Zulu and Xhosa word for \"power,\" Amandla was born in Los Angeles, California, to Karen Brailsford, a writer, and Tom Stenberg, a businessman. Her mother is African-American and her father is Danish (and of part Inuit-Greenlandic ancestry).\n\nIn the summer and fall of 2010, she shot her first feature, Colombiana (2011), an action-thriller starring Zoe Saldana whose character, the avenging assassin Cataleya Restrepo, Amandla plays as a child. In April 2011, Lionsgate announced that Amandla had landed the role of Rue in the screen adaptation of Suzanne Collins' popular young adult series, Die Tribute von Panem - The Hunger Games (2012). For her heart-breaking performance, Amandla earned an NAACP Image Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture. She also won (with Jennifer Lawrence) a Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Chemistry.\n\nAmandla starred in the recurring role of Macey, the daughter of Captain Frank Irving (Orlando Jones), on season one of Fox's Sleepy Hollow (2013). In the summer of 2015, Amandla played series regular Halle Foster on Mr. Robinson (2015) opposite Craig Robinson. She made her Sundance Film Festival debut with the teen angst drama As You Are (2016) which won a Special Jury prize. Amandla appears in several sequences in the visual album Beyoncé: Lemonade (2016). In March 2016 Fox 2000 won a heated bidding war for Angela Thomas' debut novel, The Hate U Give (2018) with Amandla attached to star. The actor also nabbed lead roles in the YA adaptation Du neben mir (2017); the Amma Asante World War II drama, Where Hands Touch (2018); and in the film adaptation of The Darkest Minds - Die Überlebenden (2018) series by Alexandra Bracken.\n\nIn May 2019 it was announced that Amandla would appear in the Netflix series The Eddy (2020) opposite André Holland (Moonlight (2016)). Damien Chazelle serves as executive producer of the Paris-set show.\n\nIn addition to on-camera jobs, Amandla put her sensitive ear to work in voice-over gigs for both film and television. She lent her voice to Rio 2 - Dschungelfieber (2014) in the role of Bia, a high-flying feathery spawn of Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) and Jewel (Anne Hathaway). A gifted musician, Amandla plays the violin, drums and guitar. In 2013 she began performing on the violin and singing harmonies at LA venues with singer/songwriter Zander Hawley. The folk-rock duo, known as Honeywater, released their first EP in August 2015 and a second in November 2016. Amandla's cover of Mac DeMarco's \"Let My Baby Stay\" is featured on the Everything, Everything soundtrack and in the closing credits. She appears in and directed the accompanying video. For the soundtrack of The Hate U Give (2018) Amandla wrote and sings \"Always.\"\n\nWhen she's not making music, Amandla is making noise on social media. She was declared \"one of the most incendiary voices of her generation\" by Dazed magazine, which featured Amandla on the cover of its Autumn 2015 issue. Amandla helped catapult the topic of cultural appropriation into public discourse when she posted her school project video, \"Don't Cash Crop My Cornrows,\" onto her Tumblr in 2014. Oprah Winfrey took note of her activism and invited Amandla to give a talk (\"My Authenticity Is My Activism\") for SuperSoul Sessions Series 2 at UCLA's Royce Hall in April 2016. Highlights were featured on Super Soul Sunday (2011). \"Black Girls Rock!\" (2016)_ Inc honored Amandla with the Young, Gifted and Black award and she is also the winner of the \"BET Awards 2016\" (2016)_ YoungStars award. The Ms. Foundation for Women named Amandla, along with Rowan Blanchard \"Feminist Celebrity of the Year\" in 2016.\n\nIn 2016, the young actor-activist came out as non-binary on her Tumblr blog.\n\nThe actor-activist landed a spot on Time magazine's list of the 30 Most Influential Teens in 2015 and 2016; was declared one of W Magazine's Royals in 2017; and was the featured call-out in Forbes 30 Under 30, also in 2017. Amandla made her American magazine cover debut with Teen Vogue's February 2016 issue for which she co-directed a trio of videos about black women. For her second Teen Vogue cover - the Icons issue in September 2017 - Amandla wrote and directed a meditation video. Time magazine put her on its cover in 2018, making her a Next Generation Leader honoree.\n\nWith Stranger Comics' Sebastian Jones, Amandla wrote the comic books \"Niobe: She is Life\" and \"Niobe: She is Death.\" An ambassador for No Kid Hungry, Amandla also supports the Ubuntu Education Fund, which nurtures children \"from cradle to career\" in Port Elizabeth, South Africa.\n\nThe stars must've been aligned just right when Nick van de Wall (better known as Afrojack) saw his first ray of light. Music was his first love since his early youth. He started playing piano when he was only five. Being a very creative student, Afrojack spent most of his time listening to all kinds of music while studying. It was no surprise that it didn't take him long to turn the tables and start making music instead of just listening to it.\n\nAt the age of 11, Afrojack gets hold of a program called Fruity loops. At this point in time his talent and passion for creating music truly surfaces. Rapidly acquainting himself with and appreciating Fruity Loops, it becomes his program of choice, which he uses to this day. Afrojack finishes school and decides to proceed with his musical career. Not being able to make a living out of it yet, he starts to work part-time in bars and catering. Now he has more than enough time to discover the club scene in Rotterdam, starting with his first night out in the old club Las Palmas when he was only 16 years old. After this, many club nights, side-jobs, small DJ-gigs for the fun of deejaying and a lot of studio time followed.\n\nIn 2006 he sets off to Crete (Greece) deejaying for five full months straight in every club that would have him, learning the craft and making his first 'flight hours'. It was also in Crete where he landed his first small hit. When returning home to the Netherlands, he was fired up and started producing more and more tracks, determined to get his productions released on a label. With a little help from Sidney Samson and Laidback Luke, Digidance decides to give it a shot, and it worked; 'Afrojack - In Your Face' scored #60 in the Dutch Top 100 and #3 in the Dutch dance Top 30. Not too bad for the first release of an 18 year old kid.\n\nIn 2007 Nick starts performing under the name Afrojack, determined to try to make it to the top as a DJ and producer. Track after track and remix after remix follows and he even starts his own label 'Wall Recordings'. Afrojack is rarely seen outside of his studio. When he's not deejaying, he is producing and it starts to pay off. His tracks start being supported by international DJ's like Josh Wink, Dave Clarke, Laidback Luke, Fedde Le Grand, Marco V and Benny Rodrigues.\n\nIn 2008 he hits the clubs with 'Math' and 'Do My Dance' and both tracks get picked up by every big name in the industry. Afrojack hooks up with the Partysquad to add vocals to \"Do My Dance\"and a couple of weeks later, the 'Drop Down (Do My Dance)' co-op mix is born. This track hits the Dutch top 20 and gets crowned \"Tune of the Week\" by the biggest Dutch radio stations. Afrojack starts appearing at many important festivals, like Mystery Land, Tomorrowland (Belgium), Extrema Outdoor and Sensation.\n\nThe world heard more and more from Afrojack in 2009 and it didn't take a long time for David Guetta to notice Afrojack's talent. They decided to meet up in the studio, which resulted in 'Toyfriend', a collaboration between the two.\n\nBefitting his position as the leading figure of the Dutch new wave, his success stretches far beyond his home turf; 2010 has seen him become one of the most in demand DJ/producers of any nationality.\n\nWith a peerless reputation as a producer , his signature style is bringing him the kind of remix requests that most dance artists will only ever dream of. (for example Lady Gaga's 'Alejandro' and Madonna's 'Revolver')\n\nGig-wise, he's rocked the world's biggest floors including Pacha Ibiza, Miami Ultra Music Festival and Electric Daisy Carnival in LA.\n\nAfrojack's rise to fame as a producer has brought him a roll call of A-list champions - from Pete Tong to David Guetta, and Josh Wink to Fedde Le Grand, along the way collaborating with some of the world's most respected producers and artists like David Guetta, Steve Aoki, Diplo, Kid Cudi, Pitbull and Black Eyed Peas.\n\nIn 2011 Afrojack was rewarded with the respectable Grammy award for the remix of Madonna's 'Revolver' in collaboration with David Guetta.\n\nRespected by his colleague DJ's for his production skills and loved by clubbers for his dancefloor bombs and energetic performances, Afrojack is setting new standards in the industry.\n\nIntroduced to most of the world in 2005 with the smash single \"1 Thing,\" triple-threat actress / dancer / singer-songwriter-producer Ameriie continues to evolve.\n\nAmerie was born in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, to Mi Suk, a Korean-born artist, and Charles Rogers, an African-American military man. As a young girl, she lived in a variety of places, including South Korea, Germany, Texas and Alaska due to her father's US military career. Having to constantly adapt to new environments, she developed a very strong sense of self early on. She excelled in school, but also found a creative outlet in writing fiction and music.\n\nAmeriie went on to Georgetown University, where she earned a bachelors degree in English and Fine Arts/Design. After securing a record deal shortly after graduation, she released her debut album \"All I Have\" and, together with Richard A. Harrison, helped steer contemporary R&B away from synthetic sounds through the use of live, aggressive instrumentation and vocalization. Three years later she turned out \"Touch\", which solidified her as one of music's most exciting artists, thanks to the overwhelming success of the go-go-inspired track \"1 Thing.\" In 2007 she released \"Because I Love It\", which featured the hip-hop electro sound that is still prevalent in pop music today.\n\nAfter releasing three critically acclaimed albums, Ameriie decided it was time to reposition herself. In 2008 she parted ways with Sony and co-founded entertainment company Feeniix Rising Entertainment with business partner Lennie Nicholson. \"In Love & War\", an aggressive mix of trunk rattling hip-hop, raw soul reminiscent of James Brown and classic Led Zeppelin-era rock-'n-roll, quickly followed. The singer managed to turn the tumultuous times of past relationships into a moving collection of songs which resonate with anyone who has ever been on the wrong side of love.\n\nAmeriie is in the process of recording her latest project, \"Cymatika\", which she describes as an album that speaks to \"the things that drive us.\" Always fusing different musical elements, this time she picks up where 2007's \"Because I Love It\" left off, and adds a heavier dose of New Wave, trance and electronica. Ameriie is also working on three books: her first fiction novel, a guide book for young girls and teens, and a wedding planning book with celebrity wedding planner Tiffany Nieves-Cook, with whom she's been planning her wedding for the past year.\n\nMalika Andrews is a distinguished journalist celebrated for her captivating NBA coverage and charismatic presence as an ESPN host.

He is of mixed ethnicity, with his mother Nicola, originating from Plymouth, Devon, England and his father Kofi, originally from Ghana, west Africa. Joey grew up and spent the first 10 years of his life in Streatham, South London, attending private school first at Oakfield School and then at Dulwich College Prep. During these early years in London, his interest and enjoyment for acting and performance became evident, as he took part in all of the stage performances that were on offer. The almost obsessive interest in martial arts and action cinema began very young. As early as Joey can recount, he has memories of his father renting Action and martial arts films from the local video shop which he would avidly watch. Arnold, Stallone, Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan and Van Damme became instinctive idols and sources of inspiration which remain to this day. Joey's family then emigrated to Accra, Ghana. This was initially a culture shock to say the least for a young Joey, who had up to this point spent most of his life in the almost exclusively white, upper-middle class environment of the English public-school system. In Accra, Joey attended Ghana's top International school for almost 5 years. During this period he was able to truly get in touch with African culture, and obtain a balanced understanding, love and pride for both halves of his heritage. Acting and stage performance continued here for a time as well. It was in Ghana that Joey's love for martial arts, dancing and stunts really took off. He joined the local Tae Kwon Do class which he trained at for 4 years. He became embroiled in the Hip Hop dance craze that was present at the school in Ghana. He also fell in love with motorbikes and began riding with friends - including the sons of an Australian former motocross champion.\n\nA few months before his 15th birthday, Joey moved back to England (this time to Plymouth) with his mother and 1-year old sister, Tanoa. He attended Devonport High school for boys where he completed his secondary education. During this time Joey also began obsessively training for the rare Martial art of Ninjutsu with military personnel in Plymouth. After a brief stint high diving, Joey became very interested in acrobatics and tumbling, and began to develop this aspect of Ninjutsu to a very high level. After passing his A-levels, Joey moved to Oxford where he did a 3 year degree in Human biology at Oxford Brookes University. Whilst continuing to practice Ninjutsu and Acrobatics, he also took up the Brazilian martial art of Capoeira in which he has trained ever since. It was during these 3 years in Oxford that Joey began his professional work in show-business, getting work and experience wherever he could. In the first couple of years at University, Joey did his fair share of extras and walk-on parts and he saw this as a valuable opportunity to spend lots of time on varied film, TV and commercial sets, learning the film making process and more importantly watching and intently studying established actors at work. Rather than frowning upon doing extras work as many do, he viewed this as an invaluable learning period. Joey also worked as a model, both on the catwalk and in TV and print campaigns. His work in stunts also occurred at this time, working on Batman Begins as a stuntman, in addition to working as trainer and fight choreographer on the Sci-Fi series Starhyke (2006). He has used his Dance, martial arts and acrobatic abilities for various music videos and Live international shows.\n\nStraight after graduating from University, Joey moved back to London and landed a major role in the award winning UK indie film, Lovestruck (2005). Following that he got an acting agent and his full time acting career began. Over the last 2 years he has been working consistently in a varied range of TV and film projects. With notable TV appearances as the terrorist Abbud in the hit TV show Spooks (2005) (aka MI5 in the USA), Roman emperor Geta in the prime time BBC docuseries Timewatch (2006). In 2006 Joey landed a major role in the upcoming, ground breaking UK action Feature 'Underground'.\n\nHis big Hollywood break came in the form of him being cast in the upcoming Bourne Ultimatum (2007) by award-winning director, Paul Greengrass, in which he plays 'Desh', a Blackbriar super assassin working for the CIA who goes up against Jason Bourne (Matt Damon). The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) is released in the US and UK Aug 3rd.\n\nZawe Ashton is an actor, writer and director.\n\nHer role as Vod in Channel 4's \"Fresh Meat\" won her a cult following, and the diversity of her work across television, film, and stage has attracted numerous accolades and awards.\n\nMost recently, Zawe starred on Broadway in the critically acclaimed revival of Harold Pinter's BETRAYAL directed by Jamie Lloyd, opposite Tom Hiddleston and Charlie Cox.
