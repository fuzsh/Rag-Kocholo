        "text": "FC Cincinnati midfielder Luciano âLuchoâ Acosta has been named to the MLS Team of the Matchday for Matchday 10, the league announced Monday.Â\n\nMondayâs recognition marks the fourth time this season Acosta has been named to the MLS Team of the Matchday, the 26th time in his career with FC Cincinnati.\n\nFC Cincinnati earned a 2-1 win over Atlanta United FC Saturday night at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, and it was the Orange and Blueâs captain Lucho Acosta who put in another signature MVP-caliber performance for FCC. After Cincinnati fell behind 1-0 in the 59th minute, Acosta provided both a goal and assist in the next five minutes to send FCC ahead for good by the 64th minute.\n\nFirst in the 62nd, Acosta sniffed out a short corner kick for Atlanta to send Cincinnati on a counter. The Argentine dished out an inch-perfect assist to countryman Luca Orellano for his first FCC goal. Two minutes later, Acostaâs superb touch in the box on DeAndre Yedlinâs cross allowed No. 10 to score his seventh-career game-winning goal for the club.\n\nAcosta netted his second game of the season with multiple goal contributions and extended his club record in games with multiple goal contributions (2+ goals or assists) to 24 across all competitions, 21 in regular season play.Â\n\nAcosta also matched Brandon Vazquez for the most goals across all competitions for FC Cincinnati (43) and scored his ninth-career goal against Atlanta, four more than any other player in league history against the Five-Stripes (Lewis Morgan & Hany Mukhtar, 5).\n\nAcostaâs performance was the eighth recognition of an FC Cincinnati player or coach on the weekly team this season. A full list of 2024 FC Cincinnati matchday honors:Â\n\nÂ\n\n2024 FC Cincinnati MLS Team of the Matchday Player RecognitionsÂ\n\n- Luciano Acosta (3, 5, 6-Bench, 10)\n\n- Miles Robinson (3, 5-Bench)\n\n- Matt Miazga (6)\n\n- DeAndre Yedlin (7-Bench)\n\nThe full team for Matchday 10 is listed below.
