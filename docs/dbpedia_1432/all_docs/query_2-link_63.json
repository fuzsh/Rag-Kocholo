        "text": "TORONTO — After 10 minutes sitting alone, I panicked. I was meeting Ralph Fiennes for dinner and suddenly realized I was in the wrong restaurant.\n\nThe 59-year-old actor is a confessed compulsive, always overly prepared, not the sort who would be late or appreciate lateness in others. So I began frantically running around Canada, a stranger in a strange land.\n\nI was dreading that famous icy blue stare, the one that seems lit with darkness; the merciless glare that was so blood-chilling when Mr. Fiennes played a depraved Nazi commandant in “Schindler’s List,” a reptilian Lord Voldemort in “Harry Potter,” and a psychopathic chef in his stylish new black comedy, “The Menu.”\n\nWhen I finally careered into the right place, 30 minutes late, he was sitting alone, looking sharp in a Timothy Everest navy wool suit, eating an appetizer, which he called “a chickpea thing” and drinking a glass of Sancerre. He did not give me a brooding Heathcliff look (though he perfected it in 1992’s “Wuthering Heights”).\n\nInstead, Mr. Fiennes was charming, indulging my fan-girl questions about Shakespeare — his 1995 Broadway performance in “Hamlet,” for which he won a Tony, and his blazing 2011 film version of “Coriolanus.”\n\nAfter eating “duck three ways,” at Richmond Station, he suggested we start over the next morning because he was due on the red carpet at the Toronto International Film Festival for the premiere of “The Menu.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
