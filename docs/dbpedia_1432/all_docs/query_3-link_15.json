        "text": "KANSAS CITY, Kan. â The San Jose Earthquakes fell 2-1 to Sporting Kansas City on Saturday night at Childrenâs Mercy Park in front of 18,219 spectators.\n\nSan Jose took the early lead in the 11th minute when a Cristian Espinoza corner kick found VÃ­tor Costa, who promptly swept the ball through traffic into the back of the net. However, SKC returned the favor seven minutes later when Dany Rosero scored on a corner kick. The Quakes continued to create chances, but Alan Pulido netted in the 29th minute to give the hosts the lead to end the first-half scoring.\n\nAfter intermission, San Jose continued to apply pressure until the final whistle, but an 83rd-minute equalizer from Rodrigues off a set piece came off the board when the VAR booth ruled a handball had occurred before the goal.\n\nThe Quakes will return home to take on Seattle Sounders FC on Saturday, March 23. Kickoff from PayPal Park is set for 7:30 p.m. PT and will be broadcast globally on MLS Season Pass on Apple TV, as well as on local radio via AM 810 The Spread (English) and AM 1370 La Kaliente (Spanish).\n\nGAME NOTES\n\nThe Quakes now hold a 26-31-10 record against Sporting Kansas City in MLS regular-season play, including an 8-24-2 record on the road.\n\nVÃ­tor Costa scored his first goal with San Jose; the newly signed outside back was also making his second start for the Quakes since joining the squad.\n\nCristian Espinoza notched his first assist of the season and fourth overall against SKC in regular-season play. The career assist leader in Quakes history, Espinozaâs total now stands at 58.\n\nFor the third straight game, the Quakes out-shot their opponent (13-5) but were unlucky in front of net once again. Combined, San Jose has out-shot their last three foes, 35-19.\n\nMATCH INFORMATION\n\nSporting Kansas City 2 â 1 San Jose Earthquakes\n\nSaturday, March 16, 2024 â Childrenâs Mercy Park; Kansas City, Kan.\n\nAttendance: 18,219\n\nScoring Summary:\n\nSJ â VÃ­tor Costa (Cristian Espinoza) 11â\n\nSKC â Dany Rosero (Memo RodrÃ­guez) 18â\n\nSKC â Alan Pulido (Johnny Russell) 30â\n\nMisconduct Summary:\n\nSKC â Dany Rosero (caution) 35â\n\nSJ â Ousseni Bouda (caution) 66â\n\nSJ â Cristian Espinoza (caution) 80â\n\nSKC â Daniel Salloi (caution) 82â\n\nSKC â Erik Thommy (caution) 90+1â\n\nSJ â Luchi Gonzalez (caution) 90+3â\n\nSPORTING KANSAS CITY: Tim Melia; Robert Voloder, Dany Rosero, Tim Leibold, Jake Davis; Nemanja Radoja, Memo RodrÃ­guez (Remi Walter 46â), Erik Thommy; Johnny Russell (C) (Stephen Afrifa 54â), Daniel Salloi (Alenis Vargas 88â), Alan Pulido (Willy Agada 88â).\n\nSubstitutes not used: John Pulskamp (GK),, Zorhan Bassong, Robert Castellanos, Felipe Hernandez, Kayden Pierre.\n\nPOSSESSION: 51.4%; SHOTS: 5; SHOTS ON GOAL:3; CORNERS: 3; SAVES: 5; FOULS: 11; XG: 0.9\n\nSAN JOSE EARTHQUAKES: Daniel; Paul Marie (Tommy Thompson 85â), Bruno Wilson, Rodrigues, Vitor Costa; Cristian Espinoza, Jackson Yueill (C), Carlos Gruezo (Alfredo Morales 72â), Amahl Pellegrino (Jack Skahan 64â); Preston Judd (Ousseni Bouda 64â), Jeremy Ebobisse (Benji KikanoviÄ 64).\n\nSubstitutes not used: William Yarbrough (GK), Michael Baldisimo, Tanner Beason, Daniel Munie.\n\nPOSSESSION: 48.6%; SHOTS: 13; SHOTS ON GOAL: 6; CORNERS: 5; SAVES: 1; FOULS: 15; XG: 1.3\n\nSAN JOSE EARTHQUAKES HEAD COACH LUCHI GONZALEZ\n\nOn tonightâs match:\n\nâIâm proud of the group to push the game and push xG, push shots, push crosses, push intensity, and push the game in a place thatâs not easy, in Kansas Cityâ¦ There are key moments where it cost us the gameâ¦ We did score our own set piece. We were eager to be aggressive in our own. We started the lineup with physicality and bodies that we thought could do that. We were aggressive. We also won a lot of balls in their half that led to our offensive transition and led the chances that we created.â\n\nOn the teamâs effort this season:\n\nâIâm proud of the guysâ effort. Iâm proud of the guys that came in second half that pushed the game and didnât give upâ¦We are pushing to turn things around. Letâs regroup. Letâs grab the things that we did well tonight. Weâve been in this spot before, this club has, and these fans have. This organizationâs been in this spot, and itâs about continuing to believe to turn things around and taking it one step at a time. Now weâve got to regroup and focus on Seattle.â"
