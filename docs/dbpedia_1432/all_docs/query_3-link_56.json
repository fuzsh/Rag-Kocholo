        "text": "Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti today announced their friendly wager on the NHL’s Western Conference Finals between the defending Stanley Cup Champion Chicago Blackhawks and the Los Angeles Kings.\n\nAs both cities work to provide productive summer activities for children, the Mayors are betting the modeling and programming skills of their respective cities’ youth to build a civic landmark using a 3-D printer that will be sent to winning city. Possible examples include the Willis Tower or Picasso Statue from Chicago and the Hollywood Sign or City Hall in Los Angeles.\n\n“Chicago launched its Summer of Learning last year with more than 200,000 kids participating. This summer, Los Angeles is launching a similar program for their young people. Both cities have extraordinary and talented young people and hockey players, but my money is on Chicago,” said Mayor Emanuel. “While the Kings are a good team, I am confident in the Hawks will show them how real hockey royalty plays. Regardless of the outcome, children in both cities will have an opportunity to enjoy summer.”\n\n\"After dining on the Ducks, the Kings are primed to feast on the Blackhawks. We're excited to launch our Summer of Learning by schooling Chicago in Hockey 101,\" Mayor Garcetti said.\n\nIn addition to the Summer of Learning wager, each mayor is betting a selection of culinary delights. Mayor Emanuel is betting;\n\nEli’s Cheesecake\n\nPastrami from Manny’s Cafeteria and Delicatessen\n\nA six pack of Chicago’s own Half Acre Brewing Company\n\nThe famous Chicago mix of Garrett’s Popcorn\n\nMayor Garcetti's wager also consists of a few selections of L.A.'s best:\n\nTommy's Chili\n\nCopy of End of Watch\n\nWine from the San Antonio Winery\n\nRaymond Chandler\n\nRoy Choi's \"L.A. Son: My Life, My City, My Food\""
