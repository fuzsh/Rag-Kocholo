        "text": "Itâs safe to say that Matchday 10 was a successful one for Minnesota United. Not only did the Loons hand Charlotte their first regular-season loss at Bank of America Stadium in almost a year, but they also rediscovered the kind of creativity and clinical touch that saw them start the year so well.\n\nAs one would expect, this dominant performance turned heads, earning three Loons a spot on the Team of the Matchday: Robin Lod, Devin Padelford, and the skipper himself, Eric Ramsay.\n\nFor Lod, Sunday was a showcase of everything that makes the Finn so special. His quality on the ball, ability to pick a pass, and keen sense of positioning set him apart from the rest, allowing him to unlock Charlotteâs defense at will. He ended the night with a goal and two assists, earning the title of MNUFCâs all-time leading goalscorer in the process. His assists came courtesy of his visionary through ball to set up Tani Oluwaseyiâs go-ahead goal in the first half and a fantastic corner kick in the second. Another top-tier performance from one of Major League Soccerâs most underrated players.\n\nOn the TOTM bench, Devin Padelford makes his first appearance in the leagueâs weekly honors. The young defender has grown into his role in the back line admirably over the last few weeks, demonstrating skill, versatility, and maturity beyond his years in the process. While the entire back line played well this weekend, Padelfordâs continued presence at center back was worthy of extra recognition, especially given the tactical adjustments he was able to handle without batting an eye.\n\nFinally, Eric Ramsay earned his spot with some gutsy decisions. Between a few changes in personnel and several subtle, effective changes in the tactical approach to the game, the young manager made Charlotte look like the visiting team in their own fortress. Every idea he brought to this match seemed to work like a charm, ultimately proving that his team is more than capable of picking apart an opponent.\n\nThe entire team deserves recognition for their efforts this weekend, but these three Loons certainly stood out with impressive performances. Well done, lads; letâs keep the good times rolling against SKC this weekend!\n\nF: Denis Bouanga (LAFC), Cristian Arango (RSL), Lionel Messi (MIA)\n\nM: Gabriel Pec (LA), Luciano Acosta (CIN), Santiago RodrÃ­guez (NYC), Robin Lod (MIN)\n\nD: Alex Katranis (RSL), Steven Moreira (CLB), Tomas Totland (STL)\n\nGK: Sean Johnson (TOR)\n\nCoach: Eric Ramsay (MIN)"
