        "text": "He also spearheaded the overhaul of the teamâs logo and uniform, forging a new identity for the club to fit his vision. Under his watch, industry insiders have consistently identified the Stars as a team âon the riseâ for both the business and hockey operations side of the organization. During the 2014-15 season, Gaglardi purchased the Texas Stars of the American Hockey League (AHL) and acquired the operating rights to H-E-B Center at Cedar Park in Cedar Park, Texas. The move reinforced his commitment to sustaining and growing the sport of hockey in the state of Texas and creating a seamless organizational process to develop and train NHL-caliber players, coaches and front office staff.\n\n&nbsp\n\nA passionate and knowledgeable leader who is deeply involved in all aspects of the family's business, Gaglardi began his career in the hospitality industry at age 13 as a busboy and has worked in virtually every area of his business since that time. He spent considerable time in construction, hotel and restaurant operations, real estate development and finance. At age 23, he was promoted to president of the Sandman Hotel Group, and at 26 he became president of Northland Properties Corporation, the Gaglardi family's umbrella company.\n\n&nbsp\n\nA passionate and knowledgeable leader who is deeply involved in all aspects of the familyâs business, Gaglardi began his career in the hospitality industry at age 13 as a busboy and has worked in virtually every area of his business since that time. He spent considerable time in construction, hotel and restaurant operations, real estate development and finance. At age 23, he was promoted to president of the Sandman Hotel Group, and at 26 he became president of Northland Properties Corporation, the Gaglardi familyâs umbrella company.\n\n&nbsp\n\nUnder his direction, Northland has grown to be the largest family-owned hospitality company in Canada including a large portfolio of hotels with the Sandman Hotel Group and the Sutton Place Hotels & Resorts, several restaurant chains including Dennyâs Restaurants of Canada, Moxieâs Grill & Bar, Chop Steakhouse & Bar and Shark Club Bar & Grill. In 2009, Gaglardi began expanding his brand of hospitality to the United Kingdom and more recently began operating in the United States, with the first Moxieâs Grill & Bar opening in Dallas in November 2016, and the first Sandman Hotel opening in Plano in February 2019. The family also owns and operates a large real estate portfolio and the world-renowned Revelstoke Mountain Resort. In addition to his role with the Stars, Gaglardi is a co-owner of the Kamloops Blazers Hockey Club of the Western Hockey League and serves as its governor.\n\n&nbsp\n\nAn active member of the community, Gaglardi founded the Sandman Harvest Foundation, which has raised over $1 million for disadvantaged and medically challenged children living in the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia. He also serves as trustee for the PA and JM Gaglardi Senior Citizens Society, a non-profit society providing housing for seniors in Kamloops, B. C. and serves on the board of St. Georgeâs School in Vancouver. He founded the Josh Dyck Foundation to assist Josh with his recovery from an auto accident in October 2006, which left him paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair.\n\nGaglardi and his wife Brittney have three sons, Charlie, Bennett and Wilson, all of whom play competitive hockey. In addition to his own participation on his hockey team, Gaglardi enjoys playing golf and spending time with his family at their cottage on the shores of Kamloops Lake near Savona, B.C.\n\nAlberts, who was named team President on March 2, 2018 and took on the role of Chief Executive Officer on July 10, 2020, oversees all aspects of the Stars business operations. Previously leading all sales and marketing, heâs also in charge of all aspects of the organization's finance and administration, box office, human resources and information technology, as well as the communications department, which has won two Dick Dillman Awards as the NHLâs Western Conference top public relations staff under his leadership.\n\n&nbsp\n\nAlberts' career includes nearly two decades of professional sports experience selling tickets, suites, premium seating and sponsorships. From 1996-2009, Alberts worked for the Dallas Stars and Texas Rangers in various sales management roles in tickets, suites and corporate sponsorships. From 2006-09, Alberts served as the Executive Vice President of the Hicks Sports Marketing Group, the in-house sponsorship sales group for the Stars, Texas Rangers and Liverpool Football Club. In 2009, Alberts took over as the Vice President of Sponsorship and Sales at Legends/CSL, overseeing events at numerous venues around the country, most notably the Circuit of The Americas, a Formula One racing track in Austin, Texas.\n\n&nbsp\n\nSince rejoining the team in 2011, Alberts has played an integral role in the resurgence of the Stars in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, helping lead the organization to tremendous growth in brand visibility, attendance and sponsorship sales. Alberts and his leadership team were instrumental in the sweeping rebrand of the team, retiring the numbers of Mike Modano, Jere Lehtinen and Sergei Zubov and creating tremendous sponsorship value for the team and its partners. Under his leadership and direction, the organization hosted the 2020 Winter Classic at Cotton Bowl Stadium against the Nashville Predators. The event sold out within hours of tickets going on sale and was hailed as one of the most successful NHL events of all time, becoming the second-highest attended game in league history with a capacity crowd of 85,630.\n\n&nbsp\n\nAlberts received his bachelor's degree from Ripon College in 1992 where he was a four-year lettermen and co-captain of the basketball team, earning an induction into the Ripon College Athletic Hall of Fame in 2002. He received a master's degree in sports administration from University of Northern Colorado in 1995. Alberts is an avid golfer and fitness enthusiast. Alberts serves as a member of the American Cancer Society CEO Board, the Dallas Sports Commission Board and is actively involved in other non-profit causes in the Metroplex.\n\n&nbsp\n\nHe resides in Dallas with his wife Kate and their daughter Grace."
