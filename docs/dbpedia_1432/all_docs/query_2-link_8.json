        "text": "Why Music?\n\nTime and again, music has been shown to catalyze brain development, social and emotional capabilities and countless other skills and abilities. Music brings students together and gives them a sense of belonging, an outcome that has been reported by the families of YONA students since the program’s inception. YONA is unique among both after-school programs and music programs in that it aims to provide wholistic care for all students.\n\nStudents receive group instrument lessons, singing and general music instruction from qualified teachers. First-year students entering the program begin on either a cardboard replica of a string instrument or a miniature pool noodle acting as a wind instrument. Students learn proper care and handling and become familiar with each part of their instrument and how it will make sound. Once the class has mastered their starter instruments, YONA celebrates with an Instrument Graduation Ceremony, during which each student receives their own REAL instrument to play for the remainder of the year.\n\nOver their years attending the program, students explore a range of orchestral instruments and musical experiences that open their minds to endless possibilities for their futures. Frequent activities include expressive arts time, roots of music classes, movement classes and visits from ESO musician ambassadors or other special guests, such as Tommy Banks, Natalie MacMaster, Meaghan Smith, Orford String Quartet and Cris Derksen.\n\nStudents also receive multiple performance opportunities each year, which builds their skill musically but also builds confidence and creates memorable experiences as they bring joy and pride to their communities. Events include school Christmas concerts, Light Up the Winspear, YONA’s Winter Concert, and YONA’s year-end celebration called Road To Joy, among other special events. YONA has also been invited to perform with various local musicians from time to time, including members of the ESO.\n\nYONA provides social curriculum that scaffolds the students in their lives beyond music, contributing to the personal growth of each individual. The curriculum evolves year over year and includes topics such as self care, making choices, teamwork, leadership, identity, community care, getting along with others and identifying growth. Students are given the opportunity to share their own ideas and are encouraged to consider the ideas presented by others, and they learn ways they could approach areas in which they may feel challenged.\n\nYONA supports students and their families through a snack program, which seeks to look after the nutritional well-being of the students. On this front, YONA is incredibly grateful for the support of Cameron Corporation for YONA’s Nutrition Program. YONA also occasionally provides food baskets to families experiencing food insecurity."
