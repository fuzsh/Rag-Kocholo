        "text": "The start of the 2024 Wyndham Championship has been pushed back to Friday, Aug. 9, due to Tropical Storm Debby. Thursday's start time was initially delayed until 3 p.m. ET at Sedgefield Country Club, but the PGA Tour decided to postpone the start until Friday in hopes of better weather. The postponement could affect a variety of players who are trying to play their way into the top 70 in the FedEx Cup standings and the first playoff event, which takes place next week in Memphis.\n\nJordan Spieth, a 13-time winner on the PGA Tour, enters this week's event ranked No. 63 in the FedEx Cup standings, and he'll need a strong showing at Sedgefield Country Club if he wants to cement his place in the postseason. Spieth is a 33-1 longshot to finish on top of the leaderboard according to the latest 2024 Wyndham Championship odds. Sungjae Im is the 16-1 favorite, followed by Billy Horschel (25-1), Shane Lowry (25-1) and Si Woo Kim (25-1). Before locking in your 2024 Wyndham Championship picks, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.\n\nSportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up nearly $9,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.\n\nThis same model has also nailed a whopping 13 majors entering the weekend, including the 2024 Masters -- its third Masters in a row -- and this year's PGA Championship and U.S. Open. Anyone who has followed it has seen massive returns.\n\nNow with the 2024 Wyndham Championship field locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard.\n\nTop 2024 Wyndham Championship predictions\n\nOne major surprise the model is calling for at the 2024 Wyndham Championship: Horschel (25-1), an eight-time winner on the PGA Tour and one of the top favorites, stumbles this week and barely cracks the top 10. Horschel is coming off an impressive T-2 finish at the Open Championship, his best-ever showing in a major championship.\n\nHowever, Horschel had been struggling mightily prior to that outing, finishing T-41 or worse in three consecutive starts, which included a missed cut at the Genesis Scottish Open. Horschel's iron play has been wildly inconsistent all season and he enters the Wyndham Championship ranked 102nd in greens in regulation percentage (65.65%) and 120th in strokes gained: approach to green (-0.113), which doesn't bode well for his chances to finish on top of the leaderboard this week. See who else to fade here.\n\nAnother surprise: Davis Thompson, a 35-1 longshot, makes a strong run at the title. He has a much better chance to win it all than his odds imply, so he's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday.\n\nThompson has been playing some exceptional golf in recent weeks. He secured his first PGA Tour victory at the John Deere Classic and finished T-2 at the Rocket Mortgage Classic following his T-9 showing at the U.S. Open in June. Thompson has been able to secure those impressive results thanks to his all-around game. The 25-year-old enters this week's event ranked inside the top 25 in several important statistical categories, including scoring average (69.41), birdie average (4.19), strokes gained: total (1.193) and putting average (1.728). His recent form, plus his long odds, make Thompson a valuable longshot to include in your Wyndham Championship bets. See who else to back here.\n\nHow to make 2024 Wyndham Championship picks\n\nThe model is also targeting four other golfers with odds of 35-1 or longer who will make a strong run at the title. Anyone who backs these longshots could hit it big. You can only see the model's picks here.\n\nWho will win the 2024 Wyndham Championship, and which longshots will stun the golfing world? Check out the Wyndham Championship 2024 odds below and then visit SportsLine to see the projected Wyndham Championship leaderboard, all from the model that's nailed 13 golf majors, including the last three Masters and three majors this year.\n\n2024 Wyndham Championship odds, top contenders\n\nGet full 2024 Wyndham Championship picks, best bets and predictions here."
