        "text": "Tour riders are often some of the most interesting parts of any artist or band’s tour. They often offer an inside look into just how high-maintenance some artists can be. This is often exemplified by how specific their requests might be.\n\nSome rock stars require specific kinds of food and drink, while others clearly want a dressing room that sets a certain mood. Some tour riders feature requests so outrageous they must be a joke. Other tour riders — like one infamous one at the very end of our list — feature details that are actually requests to see if you read the rider at all.\n\nAnd then there are rock stars like Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme, who likes to see just what he can get away with. He shared in a recent interview, ” … As the years have gone on, and we had access to more and more outrageous requests being honored, it starts to make you ask for strange things.” Homme also claims that asking for strange things is a sign of having a good sense of humor, which he says, “other than injections,” keeps you young.\n\nSo, what strange things have Homme asked for on his rider? Apparently, it has included chocolate-covered ants and a map of Ireland on his dressing room wall.\n\nHomme said, “People would ask me, ‘Josh, why do you have chocolate-covered ants and a framed map of Ireland?’ and I would say, ‘Wouldn’t you like to know, mind your damn business.'”\n\nOur list below highlights eight tour riders. The first from Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band made headlines back in 2023. (Make no mistake: When a tour rider is leaked, it almost always makes headlines. There are at least a few items on it that leave you asking, “Umm…really?!”)\n\nWithout further ado, keep scrolling and find out which of your favorite rock stars have interesting requests on their tour riders."
