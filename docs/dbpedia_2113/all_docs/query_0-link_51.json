        "text": "Hi, I'm Kyle. While surfing the web for brewing equipment in 2009, I was disappointed to discover that I wasn't able to find a single high quality homebrew system that I could actually afford. So, instead of buying a system, I decided to make it from scratch. Now more than 10 years later I sell one of the highest quality, easiest to use, all grain, electric brewing systems on the web.\n\nHi, I'm Emmet. I've been with Clawhammer Supply since Spring of 2013. I'm extremely interested in the process of brewing and love developing products as much as I do researching the many uses for them.\n\nI'm the Chief Operating Officer at Clawhammer. I manage our inventory, update our website with new information, oversee all of our third party product listings (Amazon, etc.), coordinate the efforts of our affiliate team members, and I also answer all of the phone call and emails. If you happen to call us or drop a line VIA email, I'm the one who will respond to you.\n\nI love managing the details of our business and helping all the good people who come to us looking for reasonably priced, high quality brewing and distilling equipment!\n\nHi, I'm Derek. I've been with Clawhammer since the summer of 2012. I spend my time building and tinkering with electronics (like quad copters) and designing and playing my own computer games. I'm also interested in photography and videography.\n\nI manage Clawhammer's warehouse and oversee everything from production to shipping & receiving. If you ordered a product from Clawhammer, it wouldn't have made its way to you without me. I coordinated its delivery from our manufacturers, stocked it, then packed it, put a label on it, and made sure it made its way out the door. I love managing details and improving processes. When it comes to making and shipping products, I make sure the right items go to the right places and that it happens as efficiently as possible.\n\nHi, I'm Chad. I've been with Clawhammer since Fall of 2013. I'm an outdoorsy kind of guy. I hike, climb, and camp all summer long.\n\nBy day I'm a carpenter, but I'm also partial owner of 2 businesses. One of them is called \"My Handle Bar,\" which is actually a pedal powered bar on wheels! When i'm not busy building things, or recreating, I work part-time in the Clawhammer Supply warehouse, where I help manufacture and ship orders."
