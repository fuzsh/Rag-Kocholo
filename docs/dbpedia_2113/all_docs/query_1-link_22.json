        "text": "🌟 Check out this metallic stand up pouch we printed for #Hangcure !! 🌟 🙌🏽 If you are a brand or business with multiple SKUs then it makes sense to utilise #digital #label and #pouch #printing. 🖨 🌈 To create metallic self-adhesive pouches, we use a metallic substrate such as Silver PP and print the designs using CMYK plus white ink. 🟦 🟪 🟨 ⬛️ ⬜️ Cyan, magenta and yellow are all translucent inks, so when printed on the metallic substrate, the shiny silver material shines through and makes a metallic colour, for example a yellow printed on a silver material will simulate a gold colour. 🥇 Black and white are both opaque inks, so when laid down onto a metallic substrate creates a matt non shiny effect. 📞 ☎️ www.harkwell.co.uk\n\nDid you know that we offer packaging made of fallen leaves? 🍃 It’s the first day of Spring, and while fresh leaves are blooming, the fallen ones turn into packaging. Releaf® uses leaves found on pavements, lawns and pathways to turn them into fibres with a combination of mechanical, thermal and chemical treatment. As a results, green mass transforms into raw materials with paper-forming properties which are later used to make bags, boxes, wrapping paper and more. Wondering how exactly it works? 1️⃣ The leaves are collected from the cities, parks, sidewalks etc. 2️⃣ The leaves are cleaned, dried and compressed, which allows for storing them all year around. 3️⃣ With the use of special industrial equipment and mechanical, thermal and/or chemical treatment, the leaves are turned into paper-forming materials. 4️⃣ The production of the paper, and the final products, begin. Packhelp offers a Releaf® Paper Bag with the possibility of customisation. This way the bag is not only eco-friendly, but also reflects your branding and style.
