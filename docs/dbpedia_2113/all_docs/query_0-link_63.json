        "text": "Kyle Petersen is a commercial litigator concentrating on copyright, trademark and other intellectual property disputes. His trademark practice involves both large-scale trademark protection and enforcement campaigns against multiple entities within an industry and isolated trademark disputes being litigated in federal court. Kyle has handled copyright and contract-based claims involving music licensing and the performance rights organizations, as well as claims relating to film and video content distributed via the internet and new media applications. Kyle also has experience litigating complex business disputes involving issues of corporate governance, partnership and LLC dissolutions, and fiduciary duties.\n\nIn addition, Kyle regularly counsels and represents the firm’s entertainment clients regarding labor issues, including compensation and contribution disputes with the entertainment industry guilds and pension and healthcare plans, as well as labor issues involving minors rendering services to entertainment projects. Acting in an advisory role, Kyle has assisted clients with rights clearance reviews of film properties involving copyright, trademark and right of publicity/right of privacy law, and he has counseled clients on the DMCA and Communications Decency Act in relation to streaming video platforms and other advanced technology initiatives.\n\nWhile in law school, Kyle interned at the Office of the General Counsel of the U.S. Copyright Office, where he contributed to the Copyright Office’s extensive music licensing study on the statutory framework and marketplace for music licensing in the context of evolving technology. Prior to law school, he worked in the music industry in various capacities, including in music publishing and artist management, and as a business owner of a small record label and licensing company. He leverages this experience and perspective in assisting clients and helping them address their unique needs and concerns."
