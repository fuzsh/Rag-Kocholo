Academy for Eating Disorders Electronic Media Committee\n\nResearch Interests:\n\nEating Behaviors Laboratory\n\nI have broad interests in eating and related behaviors insofar as they inform understanding of eating disorders. In my lab, we generally take a biobehavioral approach to formulating research questions, though we often employ cognitive theories as well. We recruit and conduct studies with general and student populations in addition to specific clinical populations, often working with our valued collaborators to access the latter. My personal active line of research concerns manipulating the circadian expression of stress regulation systems to reduce binge eating, but work in my lab is always much more varied. I have secondary interests in psychometrics and research design, particularly single-case experimental designs and time series data analysis. Please see samples of recent publications to get a sense of the breadth of the research in my lab.\n\nTeaching:\n\nPSYC 1000 General Psychology\n\nPSYC 3250 Health Psychology\n\nPSYC 5380 Theories and Techniques of Psychotherapy\n\nPSYC 5450/5460 Clinical Practicum/Advanced Clinical Practicum\n\nPSYC 5520 Advanced Research Methods\n\nRecent and Representative Publications:\n\n*Student mentees indicates with asterisks*\n\n*Kambanis, P.
