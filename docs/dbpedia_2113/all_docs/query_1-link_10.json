        "text": "Indeed... Sh*t Just Got Real But what does it actually mean when a giant like Universal Music, currently holding 30% of all Contracts, pulls music from a huge platform like TikTok? Nobody said it better than Rick in his video: this is probably a short-lived power move since both companies really need each other at the moment. I hope, though, that this may have positive effects for artists in the not-too-far future. More social media platforms have to accept the fact that a huge part of their popularity, revenue and far-reaching influence stems from the usage of creative content. It is only fair if the platforms pass some of their revenues on to the artists who actually gave them the basis for creating the content. This is the old GEMA vs. YouTube story all over again but with different players and in a different territory on a MUCH bigger scale. I am curious to see, how this one plays out. https://lnkd.in/ettTzU9q\n\nYouTube playlists are simply collections of videos that play orderly and are related to a common subject. You have the freedom to create a playlist with your videos, curate other creators’ videos, or combine both options. You can manage all your playlists on YouTube Studio and even share them with your viewers, and team members using multiple social media channels. You have the option to create, edit, and delete your playlist whenever you want to. Some of the most common playlists around YouTube are tutorials, music playlists, how tos, among others. 1.

Music fans and creators should check his channel out. He has 3.9 million subscribers for many reasons 📺 🎼 Background: [NYT excerpt] The music giant, home to stars like Taylor Swift and Drake, had threatened to withdraw licenses for its tracks to the social media juggernaut if they failed to come to a new agreement. Videos on TikTok began to go silent early Thursday, after combative licensing negotiations broke down this week between the popular social media platform and Universal Music Group, the giant company that releases music by artists like Taylor Swift, Drake, U2 and Ariana Grande. On Tuesday, a day before its licensing contract with TikTok was set to expire, Universal — the largest of the three major record companies — published a fiery open letter accusing TikTok of offering unsatisfactory payment for music, and of allowing its platform to be “flooded with #Ai-generated recordings” that diluted the royalty pool for real, human musicians. TikTok confirmed early Thursday that it had removed music from Universal, and videos on the app began to show the effects of the broken partnership. Recordings by Universal artists were deleted from TikTok’s library, and existing videos that used music from Universal’s artists had their audio muted entirely. Universal songs were also unavailable for users to add to new videos. NYT source: https://lnkd.in/eh3wg4tQ 💵 🎶 TikTok has stated: “It is sad and disappointing that Universal Music Group has put their own greed above the interests of their artists and songwriters. Despite Universal's false #narrative and rhetoric, the fact is they have chosen to walk away from the powerful support of a platform with well over a billion #users that serves as a free promotional and discovery vehicle for their talent. TikTok has been able to reach 'artist-first' agreements with every other label and publisher. Clearly, Universal's self-serving actions are not in the best interests of artists, songwriters and fans.” 📱👁️ Where is this going? Rick states: “They both need each other. Until the record labels figure out how to #promote their artists without using #socialmedia platforms or until YouTube figures how shorts can promote music better or how instigram can promote music as effectively as TikTok, there’s going to be this thing between TikTok and the three records labels.” https://lnkd.in/e3MGCwtg"
