This is Hiebertâs second career call-up to Team Canada and will arrive to camp following CITY SCâs road match at Inter Miami on June 1.\n\nCanada is set to play the Netherlands on Thursday 6 June at 14:45 ET / 11:45 PT and France on Sunday 9 June at 15:15 ET / 12:15 PT. The Canadian team will gather in Rotterdam on 3 June in preparation for the friendlies.

The Canadian center back had a strong first MLS season, starting in 24 of the 27 matches he played. He recorded two goals and one assist as a defender and helped anchor St. Louis in the backline to a 5-0-0 start to 2023.\n\nHiebert is one of 10 MLS players and one of three MLS center backs to be selected to the 26-man roster.\n\nBoth friendly matches will air LIVE and exclusively on OneSoccer, available on the fuboTV Canada platform, as a linear channel on TELUS's Optik TV (Channel 980), as well as online"
