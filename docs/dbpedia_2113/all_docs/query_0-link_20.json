        "text": "The spillovers from public R&D grants are large and reach far across geographic and technological space, and focusing only on firms that directly receive grants causes you to miss a lot of what's going on.\n\nAbstract: We quantify the magnitude of R&D spillovers created by grants to small firms from the US Department of Energy. Our empirical strategy leverages variation due to state-specific matching policies, and we develop a new approach to measuring both geographic and technological spillovers that does not rely on an observable paper trail. Our estimates suggest that for every patent produced by grant recipients, three more are produced by others who benefit from spillovers. Sixty percent of these spillovers occur within the United States, and many of them occur in technological areas substantially different from those targeted by the grants.\n\nThe adjustment costs of science -- getting scientists to study what you want them to -- are very large.\n\nAbstact: This paper identifies the degree to which scientists are willing to change the direction of their work in exchange for resources. Data from the National Institutes of Health are used to estimate how scientists respond to targeted funding opportunities. Inducing a scientist to change their direction by a small amount—to work on marginally different topics—requires a substantial amount of funding in expectation. The switching costs of science are large. The productivity of grants is also estimated, and it appears the additional costs of targeted research may be more than offset by more productive scientists pursuing these grants.\n\nWhen people want more new drugs, firms are happy to invest in ideas that cost more. And as they run out of \"low hanging fruit\" while demand keeps growing, R&D costs will naturally grow.\n\nAbstract: We examine trends in the productivity of the pharmaceutical sector over the past three decades. Motivated by Ricardo’s insight regarding demand-driven productivity in settings of scarce resources, we examine the industry’s aggregate R&D production function. Using exogenous demand shocks to instrument investments, we find that demand growth can explain a large portion of R&D growth, and the industry’s returns to scale have been stable whereas total factor productivity has declined significantly. Predictions based on these results are in line with Ricardo’s conclusion that productivity and rents are endogenous to demand.\n\nAbstract: COVID-19 has not affected all scientists equally. A survey of principal investigators indicates that female scientists, those in the ‘bench sciences’ and, especially, scientists with young children experienced a substantial decline in time devoted to research. This could have important short- and longer-term effects on their careers, which institution leaders and funders need to address carefully.\n\nProfessor Myers studies the economics of what determines the rate and direction of innovation. He has examined the reallocation of scientists through the use of targeted research grants at the National Institutes of Health, and is working to further understand how scientists choose their pursuits, and how policies and organizations can influence this. Professor Myers has also researched the dramatic growth in R&D in the pharmaceutical industry, drawing on traditional economic theories of scarce resources to explain productivity declines during periods of demand growth. He is also currently investigating how industry-physician interactions influence physicians’ treatment choices and the type of research they conduct. Though his current research is based in the health care sector, Professor Myers is interested in exploring the economics of innovation in many different high-technology industries."
