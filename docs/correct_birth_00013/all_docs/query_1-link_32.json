        "text": "Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter,[4] simply known as Beyoncé (/biˈjɒnseɪ/ bee-yon-say; born September 4, 1981), is an American singer, songwriter and actress. Born and raised inHouston, Texas, she performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child, and rose to fame in the late 1990s as lead singer of R&B girl-group Destiny's Child. Managed by her father Mathew Knowles, the group became one of the world's best-selling girl groups of all time. Their hiatus saw the release of Knowles' debut album Dangerously in Love (2003), which established her as a viable solo artist worldwide; it sold 11 million copies, earned five Grammy Awards and featured the Billboard number one singles \"Crazy in Love\" and \"Baby Boy\".\n\nFollowing the disbandment of Destiny's Child in 2005, she released her second solo album B'Day (2006), which contained hits \"Irreplaceable\" and \"Beautiful Liar\". Knowles also ventured into acting, with a Golden Globe nominated performance in Dreamgirls (2006), and starring roles in The Pink Panther (2006) and Obsessed (2009). Her marriage to rapper Jay-Z and portrayal ofEtta James in Cadillac Records (2008) influenced her third album I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008), which saw the birth of her alter-ego Sasha Fierce and earned a record-setting six Grammy Awards in 2010, including Song of the Year for \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\". Knowles took a hiatus from music in 2010, took over management of her career and explored 1970s R&B, rock and roll, and African and funk styles. As a result, her fourth album, 4 (2011), deviated towards a more traditional R&B sound.\n\nA self-described \"modern-day feminist\",[5] Knowles' songs are often characterized by themes of love, relationships and monogamy, as well as female sexuality and empowerment. On stage, her dynamic, highly-choreographed performances have led to critics hailing her as one of the best entertainers in contemporary popular music. Throughout a career spanning 15 years, she has won 17 Grammy Awards and sold over 118 million records as a solo artist[6] and 60 million with Destiny's Child,[7] making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time.[8][9] TheRecording Industry Association of America recognized Knowles as the top certified artist in America during the 2000s decade.[10][11] In 2009, Billboard named her the Top Radio Songs Artist of the Decade,[12] the Top Female Artist of the 2000s and their Artist of the Millennium.[13][14] In 2013, she was also included in Time magazine's list of the 100 most influential people in the world.\n\nEarly life[]\n\nKnowles was born in Houston, Texas, the daughter of Mathew Knowles, a Xerox sales manager and Tina Knowles (née Beyincé), a hairdresser and salon owner.[15][16] Mathew is an African American; Tina, an African AmericanLouisiana Creole, has African, European, and Native American ancestry.[17][18] Beyoncé's name is a tribute to her mother's maiden name.[17] She is the elder sister of Solange Knowles, also a singer, songwriter, and actress.[19]\n\nKnowles was educated at St. Mary's Elementary School in Fredericksburg, Texas, where she enrolled in dance classes.[20] Her singing talent was discovered when dance instructor Darlette Johnson began humming a song and she finished it, hitting the high-pitched notes.[20] Knowles' interest in music and performing continued after winning a school talent show aged seven, singing John Lennon's \"Imagine\" to beat 15 and 16-year-olds.[21][22] In fall of 1990, Knowles enrolled in Parker Elementary School, a music magnet school in Houston, where she would perform with the school's choir. She also attended the High School for the Performing and Visual Arts[24] and later Alief Elsik High School.[17][25] Knowles was also a member of the choir at St. John's United Methodist Church as a soloist for two years.[26]\n\nAged eight, Knowles and childhood friend Kelly Rowland met LaTavia Roberson while in an audition for an all-girl entertainment group.[27] They were placed into a group with three other girls as Girl's Tyme, and rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston.[22][28] After seeing the group, R&B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time.[29] Girl's Tyme failed to win, with Knowles later saying the song they performed was not good.[29][30] In 1995 Knowles' father resigned from his job to manage the group.[31] The move reduced Knowles' family's income by half, and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments.[17] Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&B girl groups.[27] The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company.[17] This put further strain on the family, and Knowles' parents separated.[21] On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group.[21] In 1996, the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music, the Knowles family reunited, and shortly after, the group got a contract with Columbia Records.[21]\n\nCareer[]\n\n1997–2001: Destiny's Child[]\n\nMain article: Destiny's Child[1][2]Destiny's Child performing \"Say My Name\", a single that garnered critical and commercial success, along with two Grammy Awards\n\nThe group changed their name to Destiny's Child in 1993, based on a passage in the Book of Isaiah.[27][32] In 1997, Destiny's Child released their major label debut song \"Killing Time\" on the soundtrack to the 1997 film, Men in Black.[27][30] The following year, the group released their self-titled debut album,[29] scoring their first major hit \"No, No, No\". The album established the group as a viable act in the music industry, with moderate sales and winning the group three Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards for Best R&B/Soul Album of the Year, Best R&B/Soul or Rap New Artist, and Best R&B/Soul Single for \"No, No, No\".[27] The group released their multi-platinum second album The Writing's on the Wall in 1999. The record features some of the group's most widely known songs such as \"Bills, Bills, Bills,\" the group's first number-one single, \"Jumpin' Jumpin'\" and \"Say My Name\", which became their most successful song at the time, and would remain one of their signature songs. \"Say My Name\" won the Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and the Best R&B Song at the 43rd Grammy Awards.[27] The Writing's on the Wall sold more than eight million copies worldwide.[29] During this time, Knowles recorded a duet with Marc Nelson, an original member of Boyz II Men, on the song \"After All Is Said and Done\" for the soundtrack to the 1999 film, The Best Man.[33]\n\nLeToya Luckett and Roberson became unhappy with Mathew's managing of the band and eventually were replaced by Farrah Franklin and Michelle Williams.[27] Knowles experienced depression following the split with Luckett and Roberson after being publicly blamed by the media, critics, and blogs for its cause.[34] Her long-standing boyfriend left her at this time.[35][36] The depression was so severe it lasted for a couple of years, during which she occasionally kept herself in her bedroom for days and refused to eat anything.[35] Knowles stated that she struggled to speak about her depression because Destiny's Child had just won their first Grammy Award and she feared no one would take her seriously.[37] Knowles would later speak of her mother as the person who helped her fight it.[35] Franklin was dismissed, leaving just Knowles, Rowland, and Williams.\n\nThe remaining band members recorded \"Independent Women Part I\", which appeared on the soundtrack to the 2000 film, Charlie's Angels.[27] It became their best-charting single, topping the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart for eleven consecutive weeks.[27] In early 2001, while Destiny's Child was completing their third album, Knowles landed a major role in the MTV made-for-television film, Carmen: A Hip Hopera, starring alongside American actor Mekhi Phifer.[39] Set in Philadelphia, the film is a modern interpretation of the 19th century opera Carmen by French composer Georges Bizet.[39] When the third album Survivor was released in May 2001, Luckett and Roberson filed a lawsuit claiming that the songs were aimed at them.[27] The album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 663,000 copies sold.[40] The album spawned other number-one hits, \"Bootylicious\" and the title track, \"Survivor\", the latter of which earned the group a Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.[41] After releasing their holiday album 8 Days of Christmas in October 2001, the group announced a hiatus to further pursue solo careers.[27]\n\n2002–07: Dangerously in Love, B'Day, and Dreamgirls[]\n\n[3][4]Knowles performing \"Baby Boy\", which spent nine consecutive weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart[42]\n\nIn July 2002, Knowles continued her acting career playing Foxxy Cleopatra alongside Mike Myers in the comedy film, Austin Powers in Goldmember,[43] which spent its first weekend atop the US box office and grossed $73 million.[44] Knowles released \"Work It Out\" as the lead single from its soundtrack album which entered the top ten in the UK, Norway, and Belgium.[45] In 2003, Knowles starred opposite Cuba Gooding, Jr., in the musical comedy The Fighting Temptations as Lilly, a single mother whom Gooding's character falls in love with.[46] The film received mixed reviews from critics but grossed $30 million in US.[47][48] Knowles released \"Fighting Temptation\" as the lead single from the film's soundtrack album, with Missy Elliott, MC Lyte, and Freewhich was also used to promote the film.[49] Another of Knowles' contributions to the soundtrack, \"Summertime\", fared better on the US charts.[50]\n\nKnowles' first solo recording was a feature on Jay-Z's \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\" that was released in October 2002, peaking at number four on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart.[51] Her first solo album Dangerously in Love was released on June 24, 2003, after Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland had released their solo efforts.[52] The album sold 317,000 copies in its first week and debuted atop the Billboard 200.[53] As of 2012 it remains Knowles' best-selling album, with 11 million copies sold worldwide.[54] Knowles was the first artist in twenty years and first female artist in chart history to have both an album and single debut on top of the UK and US charts at the same time.[55][56] The album's lead single, \"Crazy in Love\", featuring Jay-Z, became Knowles' first number-one single as a solo artist in the US.[57] The single \"Baby Boy\" also reached number one,[42] and singles, \"Me, Myself and I\" and \"Naughty Girl\", both reached the top-five.[58] The album earned Knowles a then record-tying five awards at the 46th Grammy Awards;

The music video for \"Single Ladies\" has been parodied and imitated around the world, spawning the \"first major dance craze\" of the Internet age according to the Toronto Star.

Smith.[184] Knowles' father had an 18-month affair with Scrubs actress Alexsandra White, who gave birth to their son, Nixon, in February 2010.[19] Her parents' divorce was granted in November 2011 after 31 years of marriage, with Knowles severing professional ties with her father shortly after, although she maintains they are not estranged.[19]\n\nKnowles is believed to have first started a relationship with Jay-Z after a collaboration on \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\", which appeared on his seventh album The Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse.[185] Knowles appeared as Jay-Z's girlfriend in the music video for the song, which would further fuel speculation of their relationship.[186] On April 4, 2008, Knowles and Jay-Z were married secretly in New York City.[90] The couple are known for being private about their relationship, although they have appeared to become more relaxed in recent years.[187] Knowles suffered a miscarriage some time around 2010 or 2011, describing it as \"the saddest thing\" she had ever been through.[188] Knowles returned to the studio and wrote music in order to cope with the loss.[189] In April 2011, Knowles and Carter travelled to Paris in order to shoot the album cover for Knowles' 4; she would fall unexpectedly pregnant here.[190]\n\nIn August, the couple attended the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, in which Knowles performed \"Love on Top\" and started the performance saying \"Tonight I want you to stand up on your feet, I want you to feel the love that's growing inside of me\".[191] At the end of the performance, Knowles dropped her microphone, unbuttoned her blazer and rubbed her stomach, confirming her pregnancy that she had alluded to earlier in the evening.[191] Her pregnancy announcement earned a Guinness World Record for \"most tweets per second recorded for a single event\" on Twitter,[192] receiving 8,868 tweets per second[193] and \"Beyonce pregnant\" was the most Googled term the week of August 29, 2011.[194]\n\nOn January 7, 2012, Knowles gave birth to a daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York under heavy security.[195] Two days later, Jay-Z released \"Glory\", a song dedicated to their child, on his website Lifeandtimes.com. The song detailed the couple's pregnancy struggles, including a miscarriage Knowles suffered before becoming pregnant.[196]Blue Ivy's cries are included at the end of the song, and she was officially credited as B.I.C. on it. At two days old, she became the youngest person ever to appear on a Billboard chart when \"Glory\" debuted on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.[197] The couple unsuccessfully attempted to trademark the name Blue Ivy to start a line of merchandise.[198][199]\n\nPolitics[]\n\nKnowles and husband Jay-Z are friends with President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama. Knowles performed \"America the Beautiful\" at the 2009 presidential inauguration, as well as \"At Last\" during the first inaugural dance at the Neighborhood Ball two days later.[200] Knowles and Jay-Z held a fundraiser at the latter's 40/40 Club in Manhattan for Obama's 2012 presidential campaign[201] which raised $4 million.[202] Knowles uploaded pictures of her paper ballot on Tumblr, confirming she had voted in support for the Democratic Party and to encourage others to do so.[203] She also performed the American national anthem at his second inauguration, singing along with a pre-recorded track.[149] She publicly endorsed same sex marriage on March 26, 2013, after the Supreme Court debate on California's Proposition 8.[204] In July 2013, Knowles and Jay-Z attended a rally in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman of the shooting of Trayvon Martin.[205]\n\nWealth[]\n\nForbes magazine began reporting on Knowles' earnings in 2008, calculating that the $80 million earned between June 2007 to June 2008, for her music, tour, films and clothing line made her the world's best-paid music personality at the time, above Madonna and Celine Dion.[206][207] They placed her fourth on the Celebrity 100 list in 2009[208] and ninth on the \"Most Powerful Women in the World\" list in 2010.[209] The following year, Forbes placed her eighth on the \"Best-Paid Celebrities Under 30\" list, having earned $35 million in the past year for her clothing line and endorsement deals.[210] In 2012, Forbes placed Knowles at number 16 on the Celebrity 100 list, twelve places lower than three years ago yet still having earned $40 million in the past year for her album 4, clothing line and endorsement deals.[211][212] and placed her and Jay-Z at number one on the \"World's Highest-Paid Celebrity Couples\", for collectively earning $78 million in the past year.[213] The couple made it into the previous year's Guinness Book of Records as the \"highest-earning power couple\" for collectively earning $122 million in 2009.[214] For the years 2009 to 2011, Knowles earned an average of $70 million per year, and earned $40 million in 2012.[215] In 2013, Knowles' endorsements of Pepsi and H&M made her and Jay-Z the world's first billion dollar couple in the music industry.[216] That year, Knowles was published as the fourth most-powerful celebrity in the Forbes rankings.[217] As of October 2013, Knowles' net-worth is $450 million, an increase of approximately $100 million from the previous year, making Knowles the sixth highest paid musician in history. Her net-worth is expected to increase again in December upon the completion of her The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour.\n\nArtistry[]\n\nVoice and songwriting[]\n\nWith 'Single Ladies,' clearly I'd just gotten married, and people want to get married every day - then there was the whole Justin Timberlake thing [recreating the video] on \"Saturday Night Live,\" and it was also the year YouTube blew up. With 'Irreplaceable,' the aggressive lyrics, the acoustic guitar, and the 808 drum machine - those things don't typically go together, and it sounded fresh. 'Crazy in Love' was another one of those classic moments in pop culture that none of us expected. I asked Jay to get on the song the night before I had to turn my album in - thank God he did. It still never gets old, no matter how many times I sing it.\n\n“”— Beyoncé Knowles\n\n[218]\n\nKnowles possesses a mezzo-soprano[219] vocal range that spans 3.6 octaves.[220] She has been identified as the centerpiece of Destiny's Child.[221] The Daily Mailcalls Knowles' voice \"versatile\", capable of exploring power ballads, soul, rock belting, operatic flourishes, and hip hop.[222] Jon Pareles of The New York Timescommented that her voice is \"velvety yet tart, with an insistent flutter and reserves of soul belting\".[223] Other critics praise her range and power, with Jody Rosen ofEntertainment Weekly describing her as \"a storm system disguised as a singer\"[224] and Chris Richards of The Washington Post saying she was \"capable of punctuating any beat with goose-bump-inducing whispers or full-bore diva-roars.\"[225]\n\n\"Trust in Me\"\n\nMENU 0:00 While predominantly R&B, Knowles' music explores various styles.

To record these, Knowles was coached phonetically by American record producer Rudy Perez.[228]\n\nShe has received co-writing credits for most of the songs recorded with Destiny's Child and her solo efforts.[27] Her early songs were personally driven and female-empowerment themed compositions like \"Independent Women\" and \"Survivor\", but after the start of her relationship with Jay-Z she transitioned to more man-tending anthems such as \"Cater 2 U\".[229] Knowles has also received co-producing credits for most of the records in which she has been involved, especially during her solo efforts. However, she does not formulate beats herself, but typically comes up with melodies and ideas during production, sharing them with producers.[230]\n\nIn 2001 she become the first African-American female and second female songwriter to win the Pop Songwriter of the Year award at the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers Pop Music Awards.[17][231] Knowles was the third woman to have writing credits on three number one songs (\"Irreplaceable\", \"Grillz\" and \"Check on It\") in the same year, after Carole King in 1971 and Mariah Carey in 1991. She is tied with American songwriter Diane Warren at third with nine songwriting credits on number-one singles.[232] (The latter wrote her 9/11-motivated song \"I Was Here\" for 4.[233]) In May 2011, Billboard magazine listed Knowles at number 17 on their list of the \"Top 20 Hot 100 Songwriters\", for having co-written eight singles that hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. She was one of only three women on that list.[234]\n\nInfluences[]\n\nKnowles names Michael Jackson as her major musical influence and idol.[235] She admires Diana Ross as an \"all-around entertainer\"[236] and Whitney Houston whom she said \"inspired me to get up there and do what she did.\"[237] Knowles credits Mariah Carey's singing and her song \"Vision of Love\" as influencing her to begin practicing vocal runs as a child, as well as helping her pursue a career as a musician.[238] Her other musical influences include Cher,[239] Prince,[240] Lauryn Hill,[236] Sade,[241] Aaliyah,[242] Donna Summer,[243] Mary J. Blige,[244] Janet Jackson,[245] Anita Baker and Rachelle Ferrell.[236]\n\nThe feminism and female empowerment themes on Knowles' second solo album B'Day were inspired by her role in Dreamgirls[246] and by singer Josephine Baker.[247] Knowles' paid homage to Baker by performing \"Déjà Vu\" at the 2006 Fashion Rocks concert wearing Baker's trademark mini-hula skirt embellished with fake bananas.[248] Knowles' third solo album I Am... Sasha Fierce was inspired by Jay-Z and especially by Etta James, whose \"boldness\" inspired Knowles to explore other musical genres and styles.[249] Her fourth solo album 4 was inspired by Fela Kuti, 1990s R&B, Earth, Wind & Fire, DeBarge, Lionel Richie, Teena Marie with additional influences by The Jackson 5, New Edition, Adele, Florence and the Machine, and Prince.[218]\n\nKnowles has stated that she is personally inspired by US First Lady Michelle Obama, saying \"She proves you can do it all\"[250] and she has described Oprah Winfrey as \"the definition of inspiration and a strong woman.\"[236] She also has discussed how Jay-Z is a continuing inspiration to her, both with what she describes as his lyrical genius and in the obstacles he has overcome in his life.[251] Knowles has expressed admiration for the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, posting in a letter \"what I find in the work of Jean-Michel Basquiat, I search for in every day in music...he is lyrical and raw\".[252][253] Furthermore, Beyoncé has revealed that Madonna inspired her to take control of her own career. She commented: \"I think about Madonna and how she took all of the great things she achieved and started the label and developed other artists. But there are not enough of those women.\"[254]\n\nStage and alter ego[]\n\n[17][18]Knowles performing \"Run the World (Girls)\" on the 2011 Good Morning AmericaSummer Concert Series\n\nIn 2006, Knowles introduced her all-female tour band Suga Mama (also the name of a song in B'Day) which includes bassists, drummers, guitarists, horn players, keyboardists and percussionists.[255] Her background singers, The Mamas, consist of Montina Cooper-Donnell, Crystal Collins and Tiffany Moniqué Riddick. They made their debut appearance at the 2006 BET Awards and re-appeared in the music videos for \"Irreplaceable\" and \"Green Light\".[228] The band have supported Knowles in most subsequent live performances, including her 2007 concert tour The Beyoncé Experience, 2009 I Am... World Tour and the 4 promotional tour.\n\nKnowles has received praise for her stage presence and voice during live performances. Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post placed Knowles at number one on her list of the Five Best Singer/Dancers.[256] According to Barbara Ellen of The Guardian Beyoncé is the most in-charge female artist she's seen onstage,[257] while Alice Jones of The Independent wrote she \"takes her role as entertainer so seriously she's almost too good.\"[258] Tamara Hardingham-Gill of the Daily Mail wrote that \"many industry experts have been tipping Beyoncé as the next Michael Jackson\".[259] The ex-President of Def Jam L.A. Reid has described Knowles as the greatest entertainer alive.[260] Jim Farber of the Daily News and Stephanie Classen of Star Phoenix both praised her strong voice and her stage presence.[261][262]\n\nDescribed as being \"sexy, seductive and provocative\" when performing on stage, Knowles has said that she originally created the alter ego \"Sasha Fierce\" to keep that stage persona separate from who she really is.[35] She described Sasha as being \"too aggressive, too strong, too sassy [and] too sexy\", stating, \"I'm not like her in real life at all.\"[35] Sasha was conceived during the making of \"Crazy in Love\", and Knowles introduced her with the release of her 2008 album I Am... Sasha Fierce. In February 2010, Knowles announced in an interview with Allure magazine that she was comfortable enough with herself to no longer need Sasha Fierce.[263] However, Knowles announced in May 2012 that she would bring her back for her Revel Presents: Beyoncé Live shows later that month.[264]\n\nPublic image[]\n\n[19][20]Knowles at the premiere for her 2006 film, Dreamgirls\n\nKnowles has been described as a having a wide-ranging sex appeal, with music journalist Touré writing that since the release of Dangerously in Love, she has \"become a crossover sex symbol\"[265] Off stage Knowles says that while she likes to dress sexily her onstage dress \"is absolutely for the stage.\"[266] Due to her curves and the term's catchiness, in the 2000s the media often used the term \"Bootylicious\" (a portmanteau of the words booty and delicious) to describe Knowles,[267][268] the term popularized by Destiny's Child in the single of the same name. In 2006, it was added to theOxford English Dictionary.[269]\n\nExternal images\n\nIn September 2010, Knowles made her runway modelling debut at Tom Ford's Spring/Summer 2011 fashion show.[270] She was named \"World's Most Beautiful Woman\" by People[271] and the \"Hottest Female Singer of All Time\" by Complex in 2012.[272] In January 2013, GQ placed her on its cover, featuring her atop its \"100 Sexiest Women of the 21st Century\" list.[273][274] VH1 listed her at number 1 on its 100 Sexiest Artists list.[275] Several wax figures of Knowles are found atMadame Tussauds Wax Museums in major cities around the world, including New York,[276] Washington, D.C.,[277] Amsterdam,[278] Bangkok,[279] Hollywood[280]and Sydney.[281]\n\nAccording to Italian fashion designer Roberto Cavalli, Knowles uses different fashion styles to work with her music while performing.[282] Knowles' mother co-wrote a book, published in 2002, titled Destiny's Style[283] an account of how fashion had an impact on the trio's success.[284] The B'Day Anthology Video Album showed many instances of fashion-oriented footage, depicting classic to contemporary wardrobe styles.[285] In 2007, Knowles was featured on the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, becoming the second African American woman after Tyra Banks,[286] and People magazine recognized Knowles as the best-dressed celebrity.[287]\n\nIn 2006, the animal rights organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), criticized Knowles for wearing and using fur in her clothing line House of Deréon.[288] In 2007, Knowles appeared on billboards and newspapers across the United States showing her holding an antique cigarette holder. Taken from the back cover of B'Day, the image provoked response from an anti-smoking group, stating that she did not need to add the cigarette holder \"to make herself appear more sophisticated\".[289] In 2011, she appeared on the cover of French fashion magazine L'Officiel, in blackface and tribal makeup that drew criticism from the media. A statement released from a spokesperson for the magazine said that Knowles' look was \"far from the glamorous Sasha Fierce\" and that it was \"a return to her African roots\".[290]\n\nKnowles' lighter skin color and costuming has drawn criticism from some in the African-American community.[291] Emmett Price, a professor of music at Northeastern University, wrote in 2007, that he thinks race plays a role in many of these criticisms, saying white celebrities who dress similarly do not attract as many comments.[291] In 2008, L'Oreal was accused of whitening her skin in their Feria hair color advertisements, responding that \"it is categorically untrue\",[292][293] and in 2013, Knowles herself criticized H&M for their proposed \"retouching\" of promotional images of her, and according to Vogue requested that only \"natural pictures be used\".[294]\n\nLegacy[]\n\nSee also: List of artists influenced by Beyoncé Knowles[21][22]Knowles performing during her I Am...

When Beyoncé does an album, when Beyoncé sings a song, when Beyoncé does anything, it's an event, and it's broadly influential. Right now, she is the heir-­apparent diva of the USA — the reigning national voice.\"[296] When The Guardian named her Artist of the Decade, Llewyn-Smith wrote \"Why Beyoncé?...Because she made not one but two of the decade's greatest singles, with Crazy in Love and Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It), not to mention her hits with Destiny's Child; and this was the decade when singles—particularly R&B singles—regained their status as pop's favourite medium...she and not any superannuated rock star was arguably the greatest live performer of the past 10 years.\"[297]\n\nKnowles' work has influenced numerous artists including Adele,[298] Rihanna,Kelly Rowland,[300][301] Leona Lewis,[302] Misha B,[303] Nicole Scherzinger,[304] Rita Ora,[305] Jessie J,[306] andAzealia Banks.[307] American indie rock band White Rabbits also cited her an inspiration for their third album Milk Famous (2012),[308] friend Gwyneth Paltrow[309] studied Knowles at her live concerts while learning to become a musical performer for the 2010 film Country Strong.[310] Nicki Minaj has stated that seeing Knowles' Pepsi commercial influenced her decision to appear in the company's 2012 global campaign.[311]\n\nHer debut single, \"Crazy in Love\" was named VH1's \"Greatest Song of the 2000s\",[312] NME's \"Best Track of the 00s\"[313] and \"Pop Song of the Century\",[314] considered by Rolling Stone to be one ofthe 500 greatest songs of all time, earned two Grammy Awards and is one of the best-selling singles of all time at around 8 million copies. The music video for \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\", which achieved fame for its intricate choreography[315] and its deployment of jazz hands,[316] was credited by the Toronto Star as having started the \"first major dance craze of both the new millennium and the Internet\",[99] triggering a number of parodies of the dance choreography[317][318] and a legion of amateur imitators on YouTube.[315][317] In 2013, Drake released a single titled \"Girls Love Beyoncé\", which featured an interpolation from Destiny Child's \"Say My Name\" and discussed his relationship with women.[319] In January 2012, research scientist Bryan Lessard named Scaptia beyonceae, a species of horse fly found in Northern Queensland, Australia after Knowles due to the fly's unique golden hairs on its abdomen.[320] Later that month, a course around Knowles's meaning in culture called \"Politicizing Beyoncé\" was introduced at Rutgers University in New Jersey.[321] The course allows students to explore the \"social and cultural significance\" of Knowles' music and image, including her alter ego Sasha Fierce and whether her \"racy performances\" are of female sexual empowerment or \"merely complying with western gender stereotypes\".[321]\n\nHonors and awards[]\n\nSee also: List of awards and nominations received by Beyoncé Knowles\n\nKnowles has earned numerous awards and honors.
