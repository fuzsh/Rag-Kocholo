        "text": "Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter, also known simply as Beyoncé (/biˈjɒnseɪ/ bee-YON-say; born September 4, 1981), is an American singer, songwriter and actress. Born and raised in Houston, Texas and performing in singing and dancing competitions, she began her music career aged sixteen as lead singer of R&B girl-group Destiny's Child. Managed by her father Mathew Knowles, the group became one of the world's best-selling girl groups of all time. Their hiatus saw the release of Knowles' debut album Dangerously in Love (2003), which established the singer as a viable solo artist worldwide, selling 11 million copies, earned five Grammy Awards and featured the Billboard number one singles \"Crazy in Love\" and \"Baby Boy\".\n\nFollowing the disbandment of Destiny's Child in 2005, she released her second solo album B'Day (2006), which contained hits \"Irreplaceable\" and \"Beautiful Liar\". Knowles also ventured into acting, with a Golden Globe nominated performance in Dreamgirls (2006), and starring roles in The Pink Panther (2006) and Obsessed (2009). Her marriage to rapper Jay-Z and portrayal of Etta James in Cadillac Records (2008) influenced her third album I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008), which saw the birth of her alter-ego Sasha Fierce and earned her a record-setting six Grammy Awards in 2010, including Song of the Year for \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\". Knowles took a hiatus from music in 2010, took over management of her career and explored 1970s R&B, rock and roll, and African and funk styles. As a result, her fourth album, 4 (2011), deviated towards a more traditional R&B sound.\n\nA self-described \"modern-day feminist\", Knowles' songs are often characterized by themes of love, relationships and monogamy, as well as female sexuality and empowerment. On stage, she has attracted comparisons to entertainers Tina Turner, Prince and Michael Jackson for her dynamic, highly-choreographed performances. Throughout a career spanning 15 years, she has won 17 Grammy Awards, and has sold over 75 million records as a solo artist and 60 million with Destiny's Child, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time. The Recording Industry Association of America recognized Knowles as the Top Certified Artist of the 2000s. In 2009, Billboard named her the Top Radio Songs Artist of the Decade."
