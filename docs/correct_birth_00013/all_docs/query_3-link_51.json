This biography tells the story of a young, talented woman's meteoric rise in the entertainment industry.\n\nAlthough Beyonce Knowles is not yet 30, the sensual superstar has already succeeded on many levels: as a dancer, singer, composer, model, music producer, video director and actress. Like rap star/entrepreneur Jay-Z, with whom Beyonce recently married, she has evolved into a businesswoman, who with her designer-mother, Tina Knowles, markets Beyonce's personal fashion line, House of Dereon. The multi-talented, global entertainer lends her name and image to many commercial and philanthropic ventures. She is the spokeswoman for L'Oreal and appears in ads for Pepsi and Ford. This biography tells the story of a young, talented woman's meteoric rise in the entertainment industry. From a shy, demure Catholic schoolgirl growing up in Houston, Texas, Beyonce Knowles eventually morphed into the first African-American woman to win the Songwriter of the Year Award from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers Pop Music Awards. The once-shy suburban schoolgirl has gone far beyond her original dream of becoming a first-rate musician and vocalist. With the assistance of her manager-father--former Xerox executive Mathew Knowles--and as lead singer of the R&B girl group Destiny's Child (the world's all-time bestselling female group), Beyonce has won 10 Grammy Awards and two Golden Globe nominations. Her albums have reached more than 20 million people worldwide, and she has become a cultural icon to music lovers everywhere as well as a role model for young women. Author Janice Arenofski gives students and general readers alike an insightful look at a music and fashion icon who has a unique niche in popular culture today. Complete with photos, a timeline, and a thorough bibliography."
