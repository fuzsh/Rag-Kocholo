Rumors have been spread and I can't tell anyone if this is for sure yet, but the fans are saying that Jay Z cheated on Beyonce and that is what her album is all about. It's all over the world and people are saying it is true. Beyonce's album was a big hit and as soon as some of her songs came out, people started questioning. We won't find out until either one of Beyonce or Jay Z says something. They waiting begins for the truth. All of this has not gotten in Beyonce's way. She has stayed strong and kept going. That is why I love her. Instead of letting it get to her she just decided to take it out with what she loves and writing songs about it. Other people can relate to her or just listen to it because they just love her music. Either way it is great for her because she let it out, but also her fans loved the album. I chose Beyonce for this paragraph because she is an inspiration to me and all other people around the world. She is truly Queen Bee and definitely runs\n\nWhen Beyoncé was a little girl she loved to sing,dance,and having fun with her family. Beyoncé was little when she started her career. Her mom and dad notices she was always singing. So her mom found a good place for her to practice, Her school talent show. When her mom told Beyonce about it, she wanted to try it. She was singing on stage and dancing. Beyoncé was scared at first, but when it was all over she wanted to do it over and over again. This is when her mom saw that she was that good at singing. After all of that Beyoncé had a lot of fun and\n\nBeyoncé Knowles, a well-known singer, songwriter uses two of her songs: “Freedom” and “Formation” to tell the story of herself. “Freedom” is the beginning of her story where she is searching for freedom and equality showing that there is still much inequality and injustice for African Americans in America today. The song slowly transitions to a more positive tone when she seems to have made something beneficial out of her difficult situation. “Formation,” however, has a completely different tone. While she does address negative situations from the past at the beginning of the song, she quickly transitions to a more positive tone full of pride in where she came from, who she has become, and what she has overcome. Together, the two songs\n\nWhitney Houston is considered as one of the greatest singers of our generation. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, she holds the record of being the most rewarded female artist of all time. I chose her as my topic, because she represents resiliency and tenacity, despite her troubled experiences with drugs and her personal life. Whitney Houston comes from a family with an amazing, musical pedigree; her mother, Cissy Houston, was a successful back-up singer for Aretha Franklin and Elvis Presley. Dionne Warwick is her first cousin and Aretha Franklin is her godmother. In 1983, Houston was signed to Arista Records and music executive, Clive Davis, became her mentor and helped launch her successful career. Whitney Houston was\n\nBeyoncé Knowles is an American Singer, Dancer and Actress. She began her career in the R&B Girl group Destiny’s Child as the lead vocalist spanning over 11 years. They released songs such as ‘Say my Name’, ‘Independent woman part 1’ and ‘Lose my Breath’ in 2004 when they returned from their 2-year hiatus; to name just a few of the top 10 hits. Beyoncé went on to become a solo artist and released her debut ‘Dangerously in Love’ in 2003 which stayed at number one for five consecutive weeks. Since then Beyoncé has released five more albums, appeared in the eight movies one of which gave her an Oscar nomination; Dream girls. While being known for her vast accomplishments, Beyoncé has used her craft to highlight the achievements and struggles of the African- American Community.\n\nBeyonce is an African American female artist making incorporating empowering messages for women around the world. She is creating work that speaks to an audience that might not receive authentic mainstream. Beyonce ultimate goal is to visually and sonically entice wisdom through her music. Recently in a shocking video release, Beyonce debuted a new song “Formation” as well as a politically charged music video. This song was an uproar in the music industry worldwide. Millions of people around the world negatively viewed this song as a controversy. The music video and song caused many people to debate and cause a worldwide conflict.\n\nThroughout history, women have contributed so much to society. Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter, born September 4, 1981 is one of these women, who has inspired millions of people through her music. Not only is Beyoncé an inspirational hip-hop artist, but she is strong, independent and determined to succeed. Born and raised in Houston, Texas, Beyoncé dreamed of becoming more than just a performer, she dreamed about becoming a superstar. At age seven she began her career as a singer and actor, and her hard work and determination helped her thrive and achieve her dream of becoming one.\n\nAs a firm believer to the idea that celebrities influence our lifestyles, Beyoncé personally, has significantly influenced me. Growing up, Beyoncé has been a role model since I was very young and still continues to live up to that standard today. She is considered to be a VERY mainstream artist and entertainer. What inspires me about her is the genuine quality in her work, which she produces.

All these characteristics about Beyoncé influence my behavior because they drive me to give 110 percent in my life.

Seemingly injected with an air of sophistication since birth, many people are simply fascinated by the duality of her ipseity; she is aesthetically attractive and an activist for the women empowerment movement--more so evocative through her art rather than through her \"off camera\" life. But Beyonce possesses a rare magic every artist of color wishes they had which is her race is rarely a factor in people's decision to listen to her or not. In fact, not so long ago I found myself at a gathering with friends and a Beyonce song came on. Of course, commentary buzzed around the room, and I heard something that stuck out to me--someone said they forgot she was \"black.\"\n\nWe all know who she is. When she introduces herself in Britains Got Talent [2], a Britain TV show, the judges and the audience disdain her only by her looks. But she doesn’t care what people think about her. When she starts to sing the song, the judges’ reactions are full of respect. And now, she is one of the most famous singers in the world.\n\nIn today’s world, celebrities are often misunderstood, especially singer/songwriter Robin Rihanna Fenty, referred to as Rihanna. Rihanna’s sexual behaviors in her videos have been talked about in negative ways for some time now, but what [eople do not understand is that it is all for fame. Celebrities will do anything to keep their career going strong. If one really took the time out to take a deep look at Rihanna, they will notice how humble she really is. After going through the abusive relationship with Chris Brown, Rihanna has struggled with gaining that strong confidence with who she is.
