        "text": "For other uses, see Beyoncé (disambiguation).\n\nBeyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter ( bee-ON-say;[6] born September 4, 1981)[7] is an American singer, songwriter, and businesswoman. Nicknamed \"Queen Bey\", she is regarded as a prominent cultural figure of the 21st century and has been recognized for her artistry and performances, with Rolling Stone naming her one of the greatest vocalists of all time.\n\nQuick Facts Born, Other names ...\n\nClose\n\nAs a child, Beyoncé started performing in various singing and dancing competitions. She rose to fame in the late 1990s as a member of the R&B girl group Destiny's Child, one of the best-selling girl groups of all time. Their hiatus saw the release of Beyoncé's debut album, Dangerously in Love (2003). She then followed with the US number-one solo albums B'Day (2006), I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008), and 4 (2011). After creating her own management company Parkwood Entertainment, Beyoncé achieved critical acclaim for the experimental visual albums Beyoncé (2013) and Lemonade (2016), which explored themes such as feminism and womanism. With her Black queer-inspired dance album Renaissance (2022) and country album Cowboy Carter (2024) from her trilogy project, she became the only female artist to have all of her first eight solo studio albums debut at number one on the Billboard 200.\n\nBeyoncé's most successful songs on the Billboard Hot 100 include \"Crazy in Love\", \"Baby Boy\", \"Check On It\", \"Irreplaceable\", \"If I Were a Boy\", \"Halo\", \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\", \"Drunk in Love\", \"Break My Soul\", \"Cuff It\" and \"Texas Hold 'Em\". She is the only woman in history to achieve at least 20 top 10 songs as a solo artist and 10 as a member of a group.[8] Her collaborative music ventures include Everything Is Love (2018), an album with her husband and rapper Jay-Z, released as the Carters, and the musical film Black Is King (2020), inspired by the music of the film soundtrack The Lion King: The Gift (2019). Self-directed concert films, including Homecoming: A Film by Beyoncé (2019) and Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé (2023), document some of her most acclaimed onstage performances. Outside of music, she has starred as an actress in films such as Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002), The Pink Panther (2006), Dreamgirls (2006), Cadillac Records (2008), Obsessed (2009), and The Lion King (2019)."
