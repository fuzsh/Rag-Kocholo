        "text": "Beyoncé Knowles (born Sept. 4, 1981) is an American pop singer and performer. Throughout her career, she has sold over 200 million records and scored eight No. 1 solo hits. She rose to fame in the 1990s R&B girl group Destiny’s Child, alongside Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams, with hits including “Say My Name,” “Survivor” and “Bills, Bills, Bills.” That group sold over 60 million records and hit No. 1 four times. When the group announced a hiatus in 2001 (they officially disbanded in 2006), Beyoncé launched her solo career with the 2003 debut album “Dangerously in Love,” which features the No. 1 songs “Crazy in Love” and “Baby Boy.” She followed that album up with 2006’s “B’Day” and 2008’s “I Am… Sasha Fierce.”\n\nBeyoncé expanded her artistry with “4” and the visual concept album, titled “Beyoncé” and released in 2013. That year, she headlined the Super Bowl Halftime Show, returning again in 2016 as a special guest with Coldplay. Beyoncé’s 2016 album “Lemonade” incorporated her typical R&B and pop sound alongside other genres including reggae, blues, rock, gospel, country and electronic. She captured her 2018 Coachella performance, widely regarded one of the festival’s greatest showcases, for the 2019 Netflix documentary “Homecoming.” With 2022’s “Renaissance,” inspired by club-era dance music, she became the first solo artist to debut at No. 1 with their first seven studio albums. Scoring 32 wins and 87 nominations, Beyoncé also set a record in 2023 by winning more Grammy awards than any other artist in history. She has three children with husband Jay-Z."
