        "text": "Beyonce Knowles is an American singer, songwriter, and performer, who was born in Houston, Texas in 1981. She is one of the biggest female stars on the American music scene today. Knowles began her singing career in her hometown of Houston as a child. She was encouraged by her parents to cultivate her musical talents, and her parents are still a big part of her life. Her father serves as her personal manager, while her mother designs many of the costumes she wears on her concert tours, and in her music videos.\n\nShe first found fame as a member of the R&B group Destiny's Child, which was one of the most popular girl groups in the history of American music. Beyonce began her solo career during her time with Destiny's Child. After their break-up in 2005, the artist went completely solo. She found instant success in the music industry because of her unbridled enthusiasm for her work. She is a tireless worker, and a talented musician. Knowles is also one of the most beautiful women in the music industry.\n\nBeyonce won her first award at the age of seven while in elementary school. By the age of eight, Beyonce, along with two childhood friends, auditioned for an all-girls group. The group won the competition, and was featured on \"Star Search\", a popular, American talent search show of the time. Although the group did not win the Star Search competition, Beyonce and the original members of Destiny's Child had their start."
