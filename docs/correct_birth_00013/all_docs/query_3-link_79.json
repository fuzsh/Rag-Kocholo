        "text": "Beyoncé and Jay-Z tend to keep the inner workings of their family life largely out of the spotlight, but the superstar singer’s mom just offered some rare insight into life with the famous couple’s two youngest.\n\nIn a recent interview with E! News, Tina Knowles opened up about the personality differences between six-year-old twins Rumi and Sir.\n\n“Rumi is amazing—an amazing artist, painter, and creator,” the matriarch said. “How could they be anything else, growing up in that environment? All we talk about is creativity and fashion.”\n\nKnowles noted that Sir isn’t as outgoing as his twin or 12-year-old sister Blue Ivy, but that he is “very, very smart.”\n\n“Sir is very quiet,” she said. “He does all of the numbers stuff, so he’s not into fashion as much.”\n\nJay-Z with daughters Rumi and Blue at the Super Bowl LVIII pregame\n\nWhile Beyoncé and Jay typically protect their children’s privacy, they are also beginning to share more of their platform with their kids, as two of the world’s biggest musical artists.\n\nFor instance, Rumi recently made history as the youngest female artist to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, after being featured on Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter track “Protector.” The record had previously been held by Blue, who featured on the 2019 single “Brown Skin Girl” when she was seven.\n\nAnd when Jay accepted the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award at the Grammys this past February, he brought Blue with him onstage."
