        "text": "Beyoncé shocked the world when she released two country singles and made history as the first Black woman to reach the No. 1 spot on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart. But her recent plunge into the genre is certainly not the singer's first rodeo in the country music scene.\n\nThe Houston native grew up embedded in cowboy culture and has performed at events like the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, which has a massive impact on H-Town's food, culture and music.\n\nAs the annual event kicks off, here's a closer look at the Texas classic and the superstar's connection with it.\n\nAbout the Houston Rodeo\n\nThe livestock show and rodeo was first held in 1932. Since its inception, the event has set out to promote agriculture by cultivating a family-friendly live entertainment experience that \"educates the public, supports Texas youth, and showcases Western heritage,\" according to the rodeo's website.\n\nThe event attracts over 2.5 million people and includes livestock auctions, rodeo action in a 70,000-seat stadium, competitions, a carnival, barbecue and nightly concert lineups that have seen the likes of George Strait, Bon Jovi, Selena, Taylor Swift, Janet Jackson and more.\n\nThis year, the nearly three-week event takes place Feb. 27 through March 17. The rodeo officially kicks off Tuesday with artists such as Blake Shelton, Carly Pearce, 50 Cent, Jelly Toll, Luke Bryan and Lainey Wilson set to grace the stage each night.\n\nBeyoncé and the Houston Rodeo\n\nAs a Houston native, Beyoncé is no stranger to the Southern event. She performed at the Houston Rodeo four times between 2001 and 2007.\n\nIn 2001 she hit the stage with her fellow Destiny's Child members. The girl group also performed at the rodeo the following year, with Beyoncé telling the Houston Chronicle she was \"coming back home.\"\n\nIn March 2004, Beyoncé performed material from her debut solo album \"Dangerously In Love\" after riding into the stadium on horseback. And she graced the stage again in 2007, previewing her \"The Beyoncé Experience\" solo tour.\n\nBeyoncé's history with country music\n\nOn the music front, Beyoncé has dabbled in the country genre before. In 2016, she released her hit \"Daddy Lessons\" on her highly acclaimed album \"Lemonade.\"\n\nThe same year she performed a collaborative version of the song with the Chicks at the Country Music Association Awards in Nashville, Tennessee, otherwise known as the heart of country music.\n\nOf course, Beyoncé dropped two new country songs, \"Texas Hold 'Em\" and \"16 Carriages,\" and announced a full \"Act II\" album earlier this month, during a Super Bowl commercial.\n\n\"Texas Hold 'Em\" became an instant hit amongst fans and hit Billboard's Country Airplay chart within a week. Due to the song's success, Beyoncé has become a first in many regards including the first Black woman to top Billboard's county, sales-based chart.\n\nMost recently, country music icon Dolly Parton sang Beyoncé's praises saying she was very excited about Beyoncé creating country music.\n\nBeyoncé's full \"Act II\" album will be released March 29."
