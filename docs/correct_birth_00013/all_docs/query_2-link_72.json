        "text": "Beyoncé (born Beyoncé Giselle Knowles 04.09.1981) is an American singer/songwriter and Grammy Award winner who rose to prominence as a member of Destiny's Child, before establishing a strong solo career.\n\nNet Worth: According to Celebrity Net Worth in 2014, Beyoncé has a net worth of 450 million USD.\n\nChildhood: Beyoncé was born in Houston, Texas, to Tina and Matthew Knowles; a record manager and a costume designer & hair stylish, respectively. Her younger sister, Solange, went on to become a singer/songwriter and actress. Beyoncé studied at St Mary's Elementary School in Fredericksburg, Texas, and won a talent contest there at the age of seven for a rendition of John Lennon's 'Imagine'. In 1990, Beyoncé moved to Houston music school, Parker Elementary, before moving on to attend the High School For the Performing and Visual Arts.\n\nCareer: Beyoncé was eight years old when she auditioned for the girl-group Gyrl's Time with her cousin, Kelly Rowland, and met LaTavia Robertson at said audition. The group were entered into a television talent show, however they did not win. Beyoncé's father quit his day job in order to work as a manager for Gyrl's Time, yet this led to financial pressure on the family which caused Beyoncé's parents to split up. In 1993, LeToya Luckett joined the band and they were picked up by Elektra Records, yet they were dropped before any material was released. In the same year, they changed their name to Destiny's Child.\n\nIn 1997, Destiny's Child were signed to Columbia Records and released 'Killing Time' for the soundtrack of 'Men In Black'. Destiny's Child released their self-titled debut studio album on 17th February 1998 to strong reviews but poor chart performance. The following year on 27th July, the band released 'The Writing's on the Wall', which received similar reviews, and reached the second spot on Billboard's 200 list. On 1st May 2001, Destiny's Child released their third studio album, 'Survivor', to similarly favourable reviews and topped Billboard's 200 list. In the same year, they released the Christmas album, '8 Days of Christmas', which received only moderate reviews but did fairly well in the charts. A remix of their previous work was released on 12th May 2002, entitled 'This Is the Remix' to strong reviews and reasonable chart success.\n\nBeyoncé made her first musical appearance outside of Destiny's Child with an appearance alongside Jay-Z, in ''03 Bonnie & Clyde' from 10th October 2002. On 18th May 2003, Beyoncé enlisted Jay-Z for her own debut studio album, 'Crazy in Love' which topped Billboard's Hottest 100. The single also featured as the first track on 'Dangerously in Love' - Beyoncé's debut studio album. The album received moderate reviews and topped the Billboard's 200 list. On 26th April 2004, she released a live album entitled 'Live at Wembley' to decent sales. Destiny's Child's fourth studio album, 'Destiny Fulfilled' was released on 10th November 2004 to mixed reviews, but strong chart success. 'Destiny Fulfilled' was thought to be the final album by Destiny's Child, however they released the compilation album '#1's' and the live album 'Destiny's Child: Live in Atlanta' in 2005.\n\nOn 4th September 2006, Beyoncé released her second solo album, 'B'Day', to strong reviews and topping the Billboard 200 charts. She then released her first EP, 'Irreemplazable', on 28th August 2007, although it failed to receive chart success. On 15th November 2008, her third studio album, 'I Am... Sasha Fierce' was released to moderate critical response yet it still topped the Billboard 200 list. After multiple remix and live albums, Beyoncé released her fourth studio album, '4', on 24th June 2011. The album received strong reviews and once again topped the Billboard charts. Beyoncé's self-titled fifth studio album was released on 13th December 2013 without any announcement or promotion, yet it still debuted at the top of Billboard's 200 and earned rave reviews. With this chart-topping success, Beyoncé became the first female artist to have five consecutive top-charting albums.\n\nBeyoncé released her sixth studio album Lemonade on 23rd April, 2016, this album comes as her second visual album and features multiple genres including R&B, pop, hip hop, blues, rock and soul to name a few. A host of different names including James Blake, Kendrick Lamar, The Weeknd and Jack White appear on particular tracks. The lead single is titled Formation and it was written by Beyonce, Rae Sremmurd, Mike Will Made It, Jordan Frost and Asheton Hogan. In the 6th February 2016 the singer embarked on the Formation World Tour to promote the album. Lemonade sold 485,000 copies in its first week and debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 and on the UK album chart.\n\nPersonal Life: After their appearance together in 2002, Beyoncé and Jay-Z were rumoured to be in a relationship, although no conformation was given. On 4th April 2008, Beyoncé and Jay-Z were married without any publicity. On 7th January 2012, Beyoncé gave birth to their daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, following a tragic miscarriage in 2010.\n\nBiography by Contactmusic.com"
