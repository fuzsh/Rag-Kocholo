Her singing talent was discovered when dance instructor Darlette Johnson began humming a song and she finished it, hitting the high-pitched notes. Beyoncé’s interest in music and performing continued after winning a school talent show at age seven, singing John Lennon’s ‘Imagine’ to beat 15 and 16-year-olds. In fall of 1990, Beyoncé enrolled in Parker Elementary School, a music magnet school in Houston, where she would perform with the school’s choir. She also attended the High School for the performing and visual arts and later Alief Elisk High School. Beyoncé was also a member of the choir at St. John’s United Methodist Church as a soloist for two years."
