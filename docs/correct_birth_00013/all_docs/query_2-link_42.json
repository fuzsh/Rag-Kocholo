        "text": "Who is Beyoncé?\n\nBeyoncé Knowles is a singer, songwriter, actress and fashion designer born on September 4, 1981 in Texas to Matthew Knowles, a former salesman, and his salon owner wife Tina.\n\nBeyonce's Career\n\nFormerly, she was a member of the iconic girl band Destiny's Child - one of the best selling girl groups of all time - along with Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams . The band officially disbanded in 2006, but they have reunited on plenty of occasions including the 2013 Super Bowl and Coachella in 2018. The band has sold more than 60 million records worldwide.\n\nIn 2001 Beyonce won ASCAP Pop Songwriter Of The Year Award, becoming the first African-American woman - and the second woman ever - to receive that honour. She launched her long-awaited solo album Dangerously In Love in 2003, which has sold over 11 million copies.\n\nShe's had numerous number one albums since, including B Day, I am... Sasha Fierce, and 4. And since the release of her album Renaissance in 2022, she has become the first solo artist to have their first seven studio albums debut at number one in the U.S.\n\nShe's also had several film roles, including the protagonist in Oscar-winning film Dreamgirls, The Pink Panther, and a critically acclaimed turn as Etta James in micro biopic Cadillac Records.\n\nBeyonce's personal life\n\nIn 2002, she began dating hip hop star Jay Z. Six years later, the couple discreetly tied the knot on April 22, 2008. Though neither party spoke about the marriage in public, she finally debuted her wedding ring five months later. The union cemented their status as the king and queen of music. Within their home filled to the brim with musical accolades, Beyoncé has a whopping 29 Grammys, while her husband has 23. In 2014, the singer was named the world's most powerful celebrity, with Jay coming in fifth.\n\nOn January 7, 2012 the couple became parents when Queen Bey gave birth to their little princess Blue Ivy Carter. Their twins, Rumi and Sir Carter were born on June 13, 2017."
