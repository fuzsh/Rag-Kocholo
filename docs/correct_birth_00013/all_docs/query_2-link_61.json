        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nDespite her fame and massive social-media following, Beyoncé is known for staying pretty private.\n\nAfter losing on \"Star Search\" as a child, she has gone on to break records in the music industry.\n\nShe adopted an alter ego, Sasha Fierce, to overcome stage fright.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2020, Beyoncé Knowles-Carter became the only solo artist besides Mariah Carey to have hit No. 1 in four different decades.\n\nAfter soaring through the ranks of the Billboard Hot 100 throughout the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s, she scored her first No. 1 of the 2020 decade with her feature on Megan Thee Stallion's \"Savage\" remix.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe competed on the competition series \"Star Search\" in 1993.\n\nAt 12 years old, Beyoncé appeared on the series as part of the singing and dancing troupe Girls Tyme.\n\nThe group earned three stars from the judges for their performance but were eliminated after losing to another group, Skeleton Crew.\n\nBeyoncé has since called the experience a \"defining moment\" in her childhood, and even included a soundbite from the show in her song \"Flawless.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe's named after her mother.\n\nAccording to People magazine, Beyoncé's mother, Tina Knowles-Lawson, was born Celestine Beyoncé.\n\nAfter she married Beyoncé's father, she worried about losing the legacy of her maiden name — her brother's last name is \"Beyincé\" due to a clerical error. As a result, the matriarch named her daughter after her own surname.\n\nBey's uncle, Roland Beyincé, shared the story during the 2013 premiere of her documentary \"Life Is But a Dream.\"\n\nHe said, \"My sister Tina [Knowles] didn't think we had enough boys in the family to keep the name going, so she gave Beyoncé our last name as the first name.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFour is her favorite number.\n\nBeyoncé has said that the number is special to her because it represents many important dates in her life, including her own birthday (September 4), her husband's birthday (December 4), her mother's birthday (January 4), and her wedding anniversary (April 4, which falls on the fourth month of the year).\n\nIt's also the name of her fourth studio album.\n\nIn fact, she loves the number so much she and her husband, Jay-Z, have the Roman numeral of it, IV, tattooed on their ring fingers.\n\nSome fans have suggested the Roman numeral, which stands for four, inspired the second part of the couple's daughter's name, Blue Ivy. The name Ivy is pronounced the same way the letters \"I\" and \"V\" would be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt 7 years old, she won a talent show against competitors over twice her age.\n\nShe apparently even earned a standing ovation for singing John Lennon's \"Imagine.\"\n\nAccording to Rolling Stone, the win prompted Beyoncé's father, Mathew Knowles, to enter the singer in more local talent shows, in which she won 35 competitions in a row.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs she got older, she started performing in front of customers at her mother's salon.\n\nIt seems she has always been a natural performer.\n\nIn her documentary \"Life Is But a Dream,\" she explained, \"I grew up in a house with my mother, who was a hairstylist … My mom would let me sweep up the hair, and if people would listen, [my friends and I] would perform for [the customers] in the hair salon.\"\n\n\"Most of them were like … 'I do not wanna hear this.' But we made them listen … and then we insisted on money,\" she added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA major part of her vocal training included running a mile while singing.\n\nAccording to Rolling Stone, her father insisted that this training would help her develop the ability to sing and dance at the same time.\n\nEven years later, she has used that technique to build stamina — her personal trainer told Insider in 2017 that he once had Beyoncé sing through an entire album \"in the Georgia heat.\"\n\nShe adopted an alter ego, Sasha Fierce, to overcome stage fright.\n\nThe singer told the Herald Sun in 2008, \"There's a certain confidence I gain from her … If Beyoncé was onstage for two hours, I don't know whether it would be as interesting. I think people come to the show to be entertained. There are certain things I'd never say in my normal life; there are certain things I wouldn't wear.\"\n\nThe persona became a part of her image, so much so that she named her 2008 album \"I am...Sasha Fierce,\" stylized in all capital letters.\n\nAlthough it's unclear what specific moment marked the end of Miss Fierce, Bey publicly announced that she had outgrown the persona when she declared, \"Sasha Fierce is done.
