The album was a huge success and hit #1 in markets such as Canada, the UK, and the US. One of the many singles, \"Crazy in Love\" had a guest appearance from a rapper named Jay-Z. Beyonce and Jay-Z have been dating since. Beyonce added to her Grammy awards in 2004, with a record-tying five Grammy awards, and in 2006 Beyonce once again added another Grammy award for a duet with Stevie Wonder.\n\nBeyonce has also branched off from her singing career into acting. She got her first real acting gig on an MTV made for TV movie \"Carmen: A Hip Hopera\". In 2002 she co-starred with Mike Myers in the huge summer blockbuster \"Austin Powers in Goldmember\". She went on to star in the 2003 film \"The Fighting Temptations\" opposite to Cuba Gooding Jr. Beyonce continued her acting success with the 2006 film \"The Pink Panther\" which was released on Feburary 10th and was #1 at the box office opening weekend.
