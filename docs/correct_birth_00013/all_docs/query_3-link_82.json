        "text": "Beyoncé is at the top of the Billboard album chart.\n\nIn promotional art for her new release, \"Cowboy Carter,\" she also can be found atop a proud white horse. One version of the album's cover depicts the pop star riding sidesaddle in a red-white-and-blue cowgirl outfit while brandishing the American flag.\n\nMeanwhile, on Wednesday, Beyoncé's mother, Tina Knowles, was perched less precariously on a pink-cushioned chair on a small stage inside the Great Hall & Conference Center on South Germantown Road. She wore a streamlined black suit embellished with black fabric roses along its seams. She was sans horse, but she earned a standing ovation.\n\n\"I'm good at raising girls,\" she said. The line earned a knowing laugh from a rapt and sympathetic audience that did not need to be reminded that Tina Knowles is the mother of not just Beyoncé but also Solange Knowles (also a popular singer). In addition, she is essentially the adoptive mother of singer Kelly Rowland, who sang alongside Beyoncé in the group Destiny's Child, which pre-dated Beyoncé's solo fame.\n\nTina Knowles, 70, was in town as the guest speaker at a sold-out benefit luncheon for Habitat for Humanity of Greater Memphis. The theme of the fundraiser was \"Women Build,\" which \"is not just a great title, it's a statement of action,\" according to Adrienne Goolsby, U.S. and Canada senior vice president for Habitat for Humanity International. The theme was a reminder that Habitat uses mostly volunteer labor to build homes — quality, affordable houses that are purchased by qualifying first-time homebuyers via Memphis Habitat mortgages that have zero added interest.\n\n\"The work here is so important,\" said Knowles, who said she has helped build Habitat homes in her hometown of Houston. \"It sounds like a cliche, it sounds corny, but your life is so much better\" when you do what you can for people who need a boost, she said.\n\nAfter her talk, which was formatted as an onstage conversation between her and WREG-TV personality Kontji Anthony, Knowles posed for pictures with some of the 300 attendees (including longtime city official and activist Gale Jones Carson, identified by Anthony as Knowles' \"twin\"). She said she planned to visit the National Civil Rights Museum in the afternoon, and to eat some barbecue (\"I like dry rub,\" she said).\n\nLatoria Taylor, local Habitat vice president of philanthropy, said the Knowles luncheon was expected to raise close to $60,000 to support the work of Habitat for Humanity of Greater Memphis.\n\nHABITAT FOR HUMANITY OF GREATER MEMPHIS: 'A life they deserve:' Habitat for Humanity continues to change lives, 40 years on\n\nA fashion designer, philanthropist and author (her book of \"Bootylicious Fashion, Beauty, and Lifestyle Secrets\" is titled, inevitably, \"Destiny's Style\"), Knowles grew up \"really poor in Galveston, Texas,\" with \"great parents\" whose dreams for their daughter were \"limited by their own experience... You can't really dream of things you haven't seen.\"\n\nAn older brother's girlfriend became a mentor. \"She drove up in a little Miata convertible with an asymmetrical haircut and I thought, 'Oh my God, this woman is a movie star.'\" Encouraged to pursue her interest in fashion, makeup, art and music rather than a safe civil service-type career, Knowles became a successful salon owner and costume designer while also helping to guide her daughters' burgeoning careers.\n\nHer success enabled her to pursue large-scale philanthropy, launching such initiatives as the Knowles-Rowland Center for Youth, in downtown Houston. \"Philanthropy is amazing, but it takes money,\" she said, encouraging the audience to contribute to such efforts as Habitat for Humanity but also reminding listeners that \"it doesn't have to be big... start doing philanthropy in your own space.\"\n\nWith Valero Energy (and the Valero Memphis Refinery) as presenting sponsor, the luncheon represented the launch of a five-year plan to construct another 150 Habitat for Humanity homes in Shelby and Fayette counties, and to rehab another 1,200 to enable seniors to \"age in place\" — to remain in their homes, after fixes to increase accessibility for older owners with mobility issues, said Lori Humber, chief operating officer for Memphis Habitat.\n\nSince 1983, Memphis Habitat has helped 600 homebuyers secure affordable mortgages, and completed repair projects in partnership with more than 1,100 local homeowners. \"Habitat's vision is a world where everyone has a safe and decent place to live,\" Humber said.\n\nEDUCATION NEWS: Cheerleaders, hard hats and a birthday: Inside Marie Feagins' first week as MSCS superintendent\n\nIf a celebrity can help spread that message, why not? Jessica Hord, vice president of brand strategy for the local Habitat for Humanity, said Tina Knowles was probably the most famous person to participate in a Memphis Habitat event since Jimmy Carter, the former president, who in 2016 labored on some Memphis-area Habitat homes with his wife, Rosalynn, and country singers Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood.\n\nBut, of course, non-celebrities are the backbone of the Habitat labor force. Hord said those who want to participate — especially women — will get a chance on the next two Saturdays: Both April 13 and April 20 are \"Women Build\" days."
