        "text": "Life before stardom\n\nBorn in Houston, Texas, U.S.A. on 4 September 1981, Beyoncé Giselle Knowles began performing at the tender age of seven.\n\nIn her youth, she was very shy and introverted, so her parents signed her up for dance classes to allow her to connect with others.\n\nThe first time her parents saw her perform, they knew she had hidden potential.\n\nBeyoncé enrolled in Parker Elementary School, a music-oriented school in Houston, Texas, US, where she performed in the school choir.\n\nBecoming Queen Bey\n\nIn 2002, Beyoncé was the featured vocalist on the single \"'03 Bonnie and Clyde\" by Jay-Z.\n\nBut it was in 2003 that Beyoncé went on to establish a hugely successful solo career when she released her debut album Dangerously in Love, becoming one of the world’s top-selling artists with sold-out tours and a slew of awards, including five Grammy Awards.\n\nThe album, which featured hip-hop stars Missy Elliott and Sean Paul, featured many genres of music, and showed off Beyoncé’s incredible musical variety. Shortly after its debut it hit number one in the US and UK, eventually selling over four million copies in the United States alone and eight million worldwide.\n\nThe Carters\n\nOn 2008 April 4, Beyoncé married long-time beau, Shawn Corey Carter, better known as Jay-Z, after years of dating.\n\nThe pair has been known to mix a little work and fun as they have a consistent list of songs and music videos featuring one another.\n\nTogether, the dynamic duo has earned record titles for the most Grammy awards won by a married couple, the highest earning couple in Hollywood ever, and the highest-grossing music tour by a duo (current year).\n\nTo date, their relationship has remained mostly private, as they remain tight-lipped about speaking about one another.\n\nIn fact, their wedding took place on the roof of Jay's elaborate New York penthouse, and months flew by before the power couple officially announced their union.\n\nBeyoncé's hit single, Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It) was one of the few occasions the artist made referencing their marriage and became a global sensation.\n\nThe couple shares three children: Blue Ivy Carter who they welcomed in 2012, and twins Rumi Carter and Sir Carter who the pair welcomed in 2017.\n\nA self-made legacy\n\nDubbed “the first lady of music”, Beyoncé has created a legacy that is unparalleled.\n\nHer many accolades and achievements in almost every field of human endeavor show why Beyoncé is admired by “Beyhivers” across the globe.\n\nQueen Bey’s music consistently challenges and pushes boundaries, even incorporating influences from blues through new wave and electropop.\n\nBeyoncé also consistently supports female empowerment through groundbreaking methods like using an all-female band while touring.\n\nHer songs are emblematic of freedom, independence, and femininity and empower women by celebrating their divine femininity through the power of her lyrics.\n\nBeyoncé is also an advocate for the advancement of the black community in America.\n\nThe platform she built with her countless wins and appearances is used rightfully as a way for her to spread her messages of equality and strength.\n\nAs she continues to grace the stage for years to come, Bey’s legacy will keep shining through her unforgettable performances, soulful tracks, and of course, her powerhouse vocals."
