        "text": "DETROIT - There was a lot to love and a number of things we weren’t crazy in love with as the “Queen Bey” herself, Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter, brought her “Renaissance” world tour to the home of the Detroit Lions on Wednesday, July 26th.\n\n60,000 fans couldn’t wait to be in the presence of sheer greatness as they waited and waited... and waited some more for one of the biggest superstars in music history to take the stage.\n\nIt had been stressed all over Ford Field’s social media channels for days that Beyoncé did not have an opener, to get there early as the show would start around 8:00 p.m. Of course, that usually means 8:30-ish. The clock kept ticking and ticking with no Beyoncé in sight.\n\nThere was no DJ, and no music played (other than a slow, almost hypnotic, boring instrumental which felt like it was on repeat for hours) until finally, the “BeyHive” rejoiced as she took the stage at 9:30 p.m.\n\nBeyoncé performed more than 30 songs in 2 and a half hours, ending at the stroke of midnight. While the concert consisted of stunning visuals consistently throughout, the audio was not on-point for much of the night with overpowering bass and the band drowning out her voice at times.\n\nBeyoncé's stage featured a huge screen which stretched across nearly the entire width of the stadium floor. In the middle was a large oval which opened to reveal the band. The stage had a catwalk which came out into the crowd from the middle and on the sides. The screen’s visuals were clear, bright and colorful. Her outfits stunning.\n\nThe show started off great as Beyoncé kicked things off almost like she was opening for herself as she performed a casual set of six songs. Her vocals sounded great as things were toned down a bit compared to what was to come.\n\nThen came the first lull of the evening. We’re talking a good five minutes between songs for her first of nearly half a dozen wardrobe changes. At a concert, a few minutes between songs can seem like an eternity when fans are feeling high as a kite, have to cool down and then starting flying high again.\n\nThe next set introduced us to Beyoncé's dancers, who were an outstanding compliment to the star of the show. And Beyoncé does not hold back as she is right in the middle of the choreography with them.\n\nThe dancing, the huge screen and the band in the oval provided for a feast of visuals for the eyes the rest of the night. If only the audio were half as good as the bass pulsated through your body during many songs if you were sitting on the floor, while also taking away from her vocals, as did the higher than needed audio from the band.\n\nA few memorable moments included when Beyoncé used one-armed robots during a couple of songs as part of the choreography. We can’t remember ever seeing that at another concert.\n\nWe also watched in awe as a couple of her dancers went high into the air on long pools, swaying as if they were in a “Cirque du Soleil” production. And then at the end, Beyoncé soaring above the crowd during the final song was a sight to see.\n\nAll-in-all, fans got what they were seeking from this show. Beyoncé performed a large amount of songs (albeit shortened versions) with plenty of energy. The concert was fun to watch and anytime you get to be within just feet of one of the biggest music artists on the planet, it just doesn’t get any better for the “BeyHive,” despite a few flaws.\n\nSetlist:\n\n1. “Dangerously in Love”\n\n2. “Flaws and All”\n\n3. “1+1”\n\n4. “I’m Going Down”\n\n5. “I Care”\n\n6. “River Deep, Mountain High” (Tribute to Tina Turner)\n\n7. “I’m That Girl”\n\n8. “Cozy”\n\n9. “Alien Superstar”\n\n10. “Lift Off”\n\n11. “Cuff It”\n\n12. “Energy”\n\n13. “Break My Soul”\n\n14. “Formation”\n\n15. “Diva”\n\n16. “Run the World (Girls)”\n\n17. “My Power”\n\n18. “Black Parade”\n\n19. “Savage”\n\n20. “Partition”\n\n21. “Church Girl”\n\n22. “Get Me Bodied”\n\n23. “Before I Let Go”\n\n24. “Rather Die Young”\n\n25. “Love on Top”\n\n26. “Crazy in Love”\n\n27. “Plastic Off the Sofa”\n\n28. “Virgo’s Groove”\n\n29. “Naughty Girl”\n\n30. “Move”\n\n31. “Heated”\n\n32. “America Has A Problem”\n\n33. “Pure/Honey”\n\n34. “Summer Renaissance”"
