        "text": "Dressed in jeans, a low-cut filmy top, big hoop earrings, and strappy high-heeled sandals, Beyoncé is sitting on a sofa in her assistant (and cousin) Angela’s Manhattan high-rise apartment. On a sunny May afternoon, wearing very little makeup, she looks even younger than her then 23 years. Downstairs, a convoy of S.U.V.’s are lined up to take her to a West Side recording studio where she’ll work on the songs for her second solo album. Upstairs, we’re waiting for a pizza and talking about shoes. Specifically, a shoe crisis that occurred in the middle of this past year’s Oscar telecast. If you saw the 2004 Oscars, you saw Beyoncé; she sang three nominated songs, and it seemed as if she had more airtime than host Chris Rock. But now she’s telling me what the millions who tuned in didn’t see.\n\n“When I did the Andrew Lloyd Webber song from Phantom, my shoe wasn’t snapped,” Beyoncé says. “And when I walked down those stairs, not only was my shoe not on, my ear monitor wasn’t on. So, the song started, and I’m thinking, Oh my God, my shoe’s not done, my monitor’s not on, and this is going to be embarrassing. . . . I’m going to fall down the stairs. There was a two-second delay; I don’t know if I’m in time or not—and when I get down to the bottom of the stairs, my shoe is off, and it’s stuck in the tulle of the bottom of the dress. I’m singing on one tiptoe, and I’m trying to balance it. . . . It was a mess.”\n\nI tell her it didn’t look like a mess. She thanks me. (The first thing I noticed about Beyoncé are her impeccable manners—so unusual in a big star.) The pizza arrives. I groan. “One little piece won’t kill you,” she says, and I recall being at a Grammy party last February when a plate of cakes and cookies was brought to our table and Beyoncé took a knife and cut a teensy slice of a two-inch-square brownie. “If you cut little slices,” she told me at the time, “it’s not so bad.”\n\nHere’s the thing about Beyoncé Knowles: whether it’s a flawless performance in front of millions balanced on one foot, or privately limiting herself to a tiny slice of carbohydrates, this supremely talented singer, dancer, songwriter, producer, and actress—who started performing at the age of seven—has, in just 17 years in show business, absorbed a lifetime’s worth of focus, determination, and discipline.\n\nBeyoncé (rhymes with “fiancé”) Knowles was born on September 4, 1981, into a middle-class family in Houston. Her mother, Tina, owned a successful hair salon, and her father, Mathew, was a sales executive with Xerox. When she was seven, Beyoncé started to enter, and win, talent contests. By the time she was nine, she was in a girl group called Girls Tyme that had a devastating loss on Star Search, but by then she was obsessed: practicing dance routines at home, singing pop hits with a karaoke machine, writing songs, wearing costumes designed by her mother, and getting “media training” from her father—who would eventually quit his job to manage full-time the group that became known as Destiny’s Child. Beyoncé co-wrote the group’s first hit when she was 17; a succession of hits followed, and Destiny’s Child went on to sell 40 million albums of catchy, sophisticated pop. Beyoncé’s 2003 solo debut, Dangerously in Love, sold more than seven million albums, earned her five Grammy Awards—to add to the three she already had with Destiny’s Child—star appearances on the Grammys and the Oscars, four movie roles (including the forthcoming Pink Panther, with Steve Martin), and assured her current status as the biggest star to emerge from the biggest-selling female group in the world.\n\nOn the way, she endured everything from microphones that stopped working mid-performance to dancing in shoes made for two left feet, to falling down onstage wearing platforms: “She got on her knees and did this thing and jumped back up like it was all a part of the routine,” says Tina Knowles. While success did not come without struggle—there were I.R.S. problems after her father quit his job to manage the group, the family had to move, and her parents split up for six months—Beyoncé says, “I didn’t grow up poor. I went to private school; we had a very nice house, cars, a housekeeper. I wasn’t doing this because I didn’t have a choice, or to support the family, or because I had to get out of a bad situation. I just was determined; this is what I wanted to do so bad.”\n\n‘Beyoncé was very shy around children, and one of the reasons we put her in dance classes was so she’d have some little kid friends,” says Tina Knowles, talking about her daughter in a private dining room on the 35th floor of the Sony Building in New York City. “When she was seven, her dance teacher, Miss Darlette, told me she was special, and you know, everyone thinks their child is special, so I just said ‘O.K.’ But then Beyoncé entered this contest—she was going to sing John Lennon’s ‘Imagine’—and her dad started working with her three days before, telling her what the song was about. When she got onstage she was just a different kid; she was so confident and she looked so happy, and we were like, ‘Who is that?’ After that, there was no stopping her—she was obsessed.”\n\nThe first incarnation of Destiny’s Child was composed of Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland, and two other girls, LeToya Luckett and Latavia Roberson, who left the group and then filed a lawsuit that claimed manager Mathew Knowles favored his daughter. When her friends left the group, in December 1999, “I was so depressed,” Beyoncé says. “I didn’t leave my room for weeks. I learned from it, but at the time, I was sick. This was my dream, and it wasn’t just the career. Those were my friends. It was like a breakup, like breaking up with your boyfriend. But Kelly and I decided to try and get two more girls and still do the video for ‘Say My Name.’”\n\nThey found two new members, Farrah Franklin and Michelle Williams; Farrah didn’t stick around too long, but Michelle joined Kelly and Beyoncé to complete the trio that has ruled the pop charts for the past decade. And Beyoncé’s parents were always there to give total support. “My mother is the balance,” says Beyoncé. “She’s very strong and will say whatever she feels and protects me always, but she always kept me a normal kid; she made sure I had slumber parties, made sure we hung out with our friends—even after eighth grade, when we started being home-schooled. My father was more focused. He wanted it for me and did everything because he’s my father and wanted me to be happy, but he’s a workaholic.”\n\n“It’s not an easy thing, working with your father,” she says. “We bump heads, we have arguments. People expect me to be a certain way, like a Diana Ross—and they expect my father to be like Joe Jackson, because that’s been the pattern when parents manage children. People think that he just controls everything and does everything, but I actually control everything. People think I have the same story as the Jackson 5, and I have a completely different story. I had a very healthy, happy childhood—my mother made sure of it and I love her for it.” Did you have boyfriends? “I had a boyfriend from 9th grade until 12th grade, the same guy. I met him in church, and I went to his prom, but I preferred to be at home singing in front of a stereo—recording, making songs, listening to the music I grew up with. My mom loved Anita Baker and Donny Hathaway, and my dad got us this Motown series, and that was just the most fascinating thing—especially the Supremes. They were so glamorous and beautiful and poised. All I wanted to do was watch videos and write songs and perform.”\n\n“I remember the first album Beyoncé wrote on,” says Tina. “She gave so much to that producer. I’d go to the studio and she’d be so excited. She’d say, ‘Mom, they let me produce, they let me write, they let me produce all the vocals.’ She was in there doing all this work and I’d say, ‘Where’s the producer?,’ and he’s out there on the cell phone. And she’s like, ‘He’s so nice to me.’ And I’m like, ‘Yeah . . . he is, and the next record you do, you won’t need as much “help.”’ Because she learns. She’s like a sponge.”\n\nFor the past four years, Beyoncé has been romantically involved with rapper, record executive, and entrepreneur Jay-Z, who is currently the coolest man in music. Actually, though, they may not have been together for four years. They may have been together longer, because, in a refreshing change of pace from today’s blabbermouth celebrities, they do not publicly discuss their relationship. Here’s what you have never seen with these two: A reality show where they eat with their hands and discuss bodily functions. Beyoncé kissing Madonna on TV. Beyoncé throwing plates in a hotel in the midst of a drunken crack-up, or having a drunken crack-up. Beyoncé racing into her boyfriend’s arms as he’s released from jail, or having a boyfriend in jail. Beyoncé and Jay-Z fleeing the police after a shoot-out in a nightclub. There are no drug rumors. No quickie Las Vegas marriage or annulment. No PIMPS UP, HO’S DOWN jackets worn at a wedding-rehearsal dinner. No jumping on sofas during Oprah. Beyoncé—she of the “bootylicious,” sexy dances—still manages to wear her success well while maintaining a sense of decorum in a world gone absolutely mad. Beyoncé Knowles is very much a lady. And when was the last time anyone used that word to describe a superstar?\n\nIt’s possible that Beyoncé and Jay may have already been dating when they both participated in the cover shoot for *Vanity Fair’*s Music Issue in July 2001—they just laugh when asked about it. Two years ago, whenever I would talk to Jay about Beyoncé, I took elaborate care to refer to her only as “that girl you know.” However, for the past two years, a glut of paparazzi photos attest to their togetherness. They’re hugging on boats on vacation in the South of France. They’re wearing Santa hats and bringing toys to the kids in the Marcy projects in Brooklyn, where Jay (né Shawn Carter) grew up. They’re courtside at Knicks and Nets games. They’re at Jay’s 40/40 Club in Manhattan. They’re at the MTV Video Music Awards, the Oscars, the Vanity Fair Oscar party.\n\nLast February, at Clive Davis’s pre-Grammy party at the Beverly Hills Hotel, Beyoncé sang along when Carlos Santana performed “Oye Come Va.” The next night, at Universal Music Group C.E.O. Doug Morris’s Grammy TV-viewing party, she quietly sang along as her friend Bono and an all-star lineup performed the Beatles’ “Across the Universe.” I asked Jay how she knew all the words to these songs from the 1960s. “It’s crazy,” he said. “She’s a student of the game. She’s a student of all types of music. The sounds she can hear in music and memorize off of one listen are amazing. She has a wonderful ear for music—knows if people are flat, on pitch, on tone—she has the whole thing down pat.”\n\nTheir musical collaboration began when Jay asked Beyoncé to sing on his 2002 song “03 Bonnie and Clyde,” because, he said with a laugh, “I wanted a singer on the song, and I knew one who was exceptional.” He returned the favor on her ubiquitous 2003 mega-smash single, the Grammy-winning “Crazy in Love.” I asked Jay what he thought they brought to each other musically. “We exchanged audiences,” he said. “Her records are huge Top 40 records, and she helped ‘Bonnie and Clyde’ go to Number 1. What I gave her was a street credibility, a different edge.”\n\nAccording to Beyoncé, “‘Crazy in Love’ was really hard to write, because there was so much going on. I let Columbia hear it with the rest of my album, and people liked it, but they didn’t go crazy for it. I was so stressed, because I thought, I don’t have a single. I mean, I had written—what?—seven, eight Number 1 songs with Destiny’s Child, in a row. But I guess if you haven’t written a Number 1 song in three months, you have to prove yourself again. I knew the song wasn’t complete, because the horns were so old-school, and I thought if a rapper was on it people would give it more of a chance—because rappers can flow over old-school beats and people accept it. So Jay came into the studio, and it could have been 10 minutes, it could have been 2 minutes—he listened to it and recorded this rap without writing anything down. He just sits there and his mouth starts moving silently, and all of a sudden he does this rap. I have seen him do this many times, but this was like three in the morning. He had to be exhausted, I was exhausted. I don’t know how he did this. . . . He rapped on the song and he added a lot to the energy of it. It really completed the song.”\n\n‘Sasha” is the name Beyoncé has given to her alter ego, that “other person” she becomes when she’s onstage. But, she says, “I always held back in Destiny’s Child, because I was comfortable in a group and felt that I didn’t have to do anything 100 percent, because there were other people onstage with me. I would not lose myself or go all the way.” When do you think you first went all the way? “The first step to that was Dangerously in Love. I just wanted people to really hear me, hear my voice and my tastes. For the first time, I wasn’t afraid, I didn’t feel limited. I wanted people to hear my range, because I can sing like a rapper, I can flow, I can sing soul songs, I can do rock, and I wanted people to hear that. All the Destiny’s Child songs like ‘Independent Woman’ and ‘Survivor’ were all so strong. I wanted people to hear the more vulnerable side.” To come out with “Crazy in Love,” with the sexy lyrics and video with Jay, you must have been in love. “Yes, it was very real. And when we did that video, everybody was like, ‘Who is that?’ Because for the first time I danced all the way. I let go.” What about your famed ass-shaking dance in the video? “I told the choreographer that when I sang the ‘Uh-oh’ part of the song I wanted to do something like a signature dance that people would do when they hear it. I wanted it to be kind of simple and repetitive, visually the same as the vocal.” It looks hard to do. “It’s not—you could do it.” No, I couldn’t. “Yes, you can. It was the last thing we did in the video. We had 15 minutes before daylight, and I told my mom to make sure I had long pants on, because I thought if I had shorts on it would be too much. Now it’s shocking how every single person—including Oprah—wants me to teach them how to do the dance. So it worked.” Do you see any conflict between being so religious and your sexy image? “No, it’s a way of life for me. What’s more important to me is the way I treat people, what I think, what I give to other people. When I go back to Houston and go to church and see those people, I feel like the same country girl.” (After Hurricane Katrina, the Knowles family and Kelly Rowland worked with the city government in Houston to get 100 families out of the Astrodome and to set up the transitional “Destiny Village.” They began with the purchase of mobile homes, with the goal to create cost-free housing for those families by Christmas.) Are you still shy? “I’m not shy anymore, but I’m still private. I’ll sit in a room in a corner and watch people. I don’t have to be the person walking around with people looking at me. I’ve always been that way. I like to go to parties every once in a while and see friends, but I don’t dance in public.” I read that you and Jay were salsa-dancing somewhere. “We went salsa-dancing, I’ll do that, but at a party I’m not going to go out on the dance floor. People expect me to go do that, but that’s for the stage.” You’ve never run wild. There’s not going to be a Behind the Music about you? “Well, I hope not. I’m still only 23, and I know enough to think, Never say never, but I very much doubt that happening. I respect my mother so much. She would kill me if any of that ever happened.” Are you growing away from your parents a bit? “My mother and I are friends. We go out to dinner together. I can tell her anything. The older I get, the more we become friends.” And your father? “It’s harder for my father to let go than my mom.” Do you talk about business with Jay? Does he give you advice? “We give each other advice, but we respect each other’s business, and we don’t really get involved with that. When I’m not working, I don’t want to talk about business. I don’t want to think about it. I want to turn my phone off.”\n\nIt’s difficult to imagine that Beyoncé often gets to turn her phone off. This summer she was on tour with Destiny’s Child in Europe with just 10 days off for a vacation with Jay, sailing around the South of France. She came right back for two months of Destiny’s Child concerts in the U.S. While that was going on, she was scheduled to write and record a song for the Pink Panther soundtrack, write songs for her sophomore solo album, and work with her mother on the designs for the House of Deréon, their clothing line named for Beyoncé’s maternal grandmother. When we meet again in August, she has slept about six hours in two days, with appearances on Good Morning America and at a Manhattan Ronald McDonald House sandwiched in between concerts at Madison Square Garden and the Nassau Coliseum. And, having announced the amicable Destiny’s Child “breakup” several weeks earlier onstage in Barcelona, she found herself having to address what some people considered “shocking” news.\n\n“We’d been saying the entire time that this last album was going to be the final album,” Beyoncé said. “That’s why we called it Destiny Fulfilled. I didn’t think it was like breaking news. I was on vacation right after we said it, and when I got back Kelly and Michelle said, ‘Oh my God, it was on CNN.’”\n\nYou’ve said you’re ‘not single.’ Are you married? “No.” You know there’s a rumor that you and Jay are secretly married. “No, I didn’t.” There’s also a rumor that you’re engaged. “I’m not. But I’m engaged and married at the same time?” (Laughs.) Two different rumors. Do you want kids? “Yes.” Soon? “Well, after I just babysat my nephew [her sister Solange’s 11-month-old son, Daniel] yesterday . . . no. I mean, he’s a good baby, and he’s the cutest thing I’ve ever seen in my life—I love him to death. But yesterday I got up at four in the morning, I did the [TV] show, and I thought, Since he’s leaving tomorrow, I have to see him. So the time I should have been asleep, I was watching him. I played, I had the stroller . . . and I was like, I don’t know how my sister does it.” You wouldn’t have a nanny? “I think having a nanny is great to help, but I want to be there for my kids. My mom was there for me.” Destiny’s Child did quite a lascivious “lap dance” performance of “Cater 2 U” on the BET Awards in June—actor Terrence Howard is still talking about it. “Oh God. . . . It was fun . . . but we didn’t expect for people to still be talking about it now. I saw the tape. . . . Oh God. . . . [Dissolves into laughter.] It was very sexy, but I’m very embarrassed about it. I’m not overtly sexy, even though ‘Sasha’ is. Onstage I just go for it.” You started out writing “Independent Woman” and “Survivor” and wound up with “Cater 2 U”—about bringing your man his slippers, drawing his bath. What happened? “I grew up. I feel it’s still very strong, because in order to be a strong woman, you have to have a strong man. There’s nothing wrong with women doing that for their man if their man deserves it and he does the same for you.” Did you ever worry that you wouldn’t find somebody? “Absolutely. Yes. Because I don’t go out, I’m not exposed to people that much.” Did you once say that you go for the “weird” ones? “I might have. I like people who make me think—that’s what I meant. People who are interesting and not the typical person that has nothing to offer me.” Why do you do so many commercial endorsements? “With L’Oréal, I was so excited to get a sponsorship because I was 17 and I wore their makeup. Then with Pepsi, I thought, Michael Jackson did a Pepsi commercial—this is iconic, this is amazing. With True Star, I was one of the only black women to have a perfume, and I thought that was quite an accomplishment. McDonald’s is all about children; these Ronald McDonald Houses help kids with cancer and other diseases, and it was important for me and the other ladies to do something that meant something.” Did Destiny’s Child get $7 million to perform at a Bar Mitzvah? “No. We did do a Bar Mitzvah, in one of my favorite places in the world, in Monaco.” Did you get millions of dollars for it? (Silence.) “We didn’t get $7 million for it.” (Laughs.) Do you think it’s vulgar to talk about money? “I don’t think it’s appropriate. I don’t think it’s anyone’s business.”\n\nHere’s what else the Knowles family doesn’t think is anyone’s business: all the rumors they’ve had to deal with for years. “It’s been going on since the group started,” says Tina Knowles. “We just tune it out. If you don’t, you’ll be crazy. We have had some of the craziest rumors. One time they said I was gay and was going with Michelle, and that’s why Michelle got to sing lead on a song. It was so stupid. . . . I’m a mother. I don’t care what they say about me, but when it’s about our kids, I’m ready to get them. It was on the Internet that my grandchild had a clubfoot and my daughter Solange put him in a bariatric chamber to bleach him.” What did the bleaching have to do with the clubfoot? “First he had a clubfoot. And then she was bleaching him. I was furious because my child was crying, and they said it was in our hometown paper, the Houston Chronicle. So I had our attorney call the Chronicle, and they said they would never do anything like that, but it was all over the Internet and it was terrible. So after all this stuff, what can you get upset about?” What about the rumors that Beyonccé is firing her father, and you and he are splitting up, and Jay is going to manage her? “Jay doesn’t want to manage her, and all the rumors about how I’m getting a divorce and I’m going to manage her or Jay is going to manage her . . . it’s just crazy.”\n\n‘There’s no way I can know every person in the world, and people just know you from what they read,” Beyoncé says. “When people meet me, they say they think I’m so normal. . . . If someone says I’m married or engaged and I’m not, I don’t pay attention to it. But when someone says something about my family, I don’t like that.” What about when they talk about Destiny’s Child and they say, “Beyoncé, what’s-her-name, and the other one?” “That is very, very, very, very hurtful. Actually, if one of them is hurt, I’m even more hurt, because they’re my sisters. The girls are very talented, they work very hard, and it’s just disrespectful. People just have no couth.”\n\nBeyoncé says she’s determined to take the entire month of October off. “I’m not doing one thing,” she says. “I just bought a place [in Manhattan], and I want to just stay at home and watch TV and do whatever I want to do.” The Pink Panther won’t come out until February, but in December she’ll start shooting the leading role in the movie of the Broadway musical Dreamgirls, with Eddie Murphy and Jamie Foxx. “When I watched the movie Chicago, I wanted to cry—I wanted to be in it so bad. It was the first musical I saw since the old musicals, and I was just so excited. I was like, They’re coming back! I love to sing and dance and I love acting—even though I haven’t really lost myself acting. What has to happen is like a tingling, something that happens where I can do anything, and I’m not scared—I’m just lost in the moment. I haven’t done that with acting yet, but I know I can.” How do you know you can? “I don’t know. I just know I can.”"
