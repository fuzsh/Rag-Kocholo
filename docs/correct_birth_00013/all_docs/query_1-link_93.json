And she was the exact same age as Beyonce.”\n\n“[Then] you had Usher, who was the same age, they were all 14 or 15 years old, living in Atlanta.”\n\nDespite Knowles implying his daughter is only a few years older, and despite being one of the biggest pop stars on the planet, selling millions of albums and having an incredible set of pipes on her, Beyonce’s age has become the subject of numerous conspiracy theories.\n\nTMZ ran a story in 2006 claiming she was seven years older than she claimed - citing a document from the Texas Department of Health.\n\nThere was also confusion when actress Gabrielle Union, who worked with Beyonce on the 2008 film Cadillac Records, claimed the two had been friends when they were “teenagers” even though she was born nine years before Beyonce.\n\nThis would make Beyonce just ten years old when Union was nineteen.\n\nThe more bizarre corners of the internet even support a theory that Beyonce’s sister, Solange, is actually her daughter, which was covered up by Matthew and Tina Knowles.\n\nUn-Bey-Lievable: Ridiculous things Beyonce has done\n\nShow all 15\n\nKnowles’ comments were nestled among a 36-minute interview about launching Destiny’s Child. It’s entirely possible he just got his ages mixed up - his difficult relationship with Beyonce is well-documented after she fired him as her manager - or it could be intentionally stirring something.\n\nHe insisted that he was still “very close” to both his daughters, despite routinely being left out of photos with the family.\n\n“My role is to be a manager, to be behind, not in front,” he said. “Now I do it more, now I’m promoting a book.”\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
