        "text": "Beyonce Giselle Knowles-Carter, a singer more popularly known just as Beyonce, is a R&B artist who rose to fame as the lead singer of the all-girls group Destiny’s Child which also had the likes of Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams in the line-up. After a highly successful stint with the group which became one of the world’s best selling girl groups of all time, Beyonce embarked on a career as a solo artist. Her solo career began with a bang—her debut album won five Grammy Awards and sold over 11 million copies worldwide. Even as a child she had displayed a keen interest in music and dancing from an early age and regularly participated in local talent shows. She surprised her school authorities when she won a school talent show when she was just seven by beating the other contestants who were well into their teenage. She formed a girls’ group while she was still very young with some of her friends. Her father recognized the potential his daughter had and decided to become her manager. Her group, which later became famous as Destiny’s Child, went on to become a highly popular music group following which Beyonce ventured into an even more successful solo career as a singer and actress."
