        "text": "Beyoncé and her mom, Tina Knowles, are so close that they share the same designer looks.\n\nTina Knowles recently attended a Las Vegas event where all eyes were on her because the entrepreneur arrived wearing an outfit that members of the BeyHive immediately recognized.\n\nAt the opening of “Love & Laughter” at The Cosmopolitan casino April 27 — a new show featuring Cedric The Entertainer and Toni Braxton — Tina Knowles wowed on the red carpet in a jumpsuit that resembled denim. The luxurious one-piece also included matching, attached boots.\n\nShe shared photos from the event on her Instagram and complimented the comedian and Braxton's collaboration in the caption.\n\n“The show was soo great!!!!!!” she wrote, in part, and added three red hearts.\n\nFans in the comments quickly pointed out that Tina Knowles appeared to wear the same look that Beyoncé donned on stage during her Louisville, Kentucky “Renaissance World Tour” show on July 17, 2023. The “Texas Hold ‘Em” singer posted photos from her performance at the time on Instagram. She also sported matching gloves with her look.\n\nEagle-eyed Beyoncé fans were impressed that Tina Knowles appeared to borrow her daughter's outfit.\n\n“Okay mama tina i see with beyoncé tour outfit on,” one commented.\n\n“You in Beyoncés closet,” a fan asked.\n\nAnother joked, “Ate that bee lady up in her own outfit” and added a fire emoji.\n\nAccording to W Magazine, the bodysuit the mother and daughter wore is a custom Diesel look featuring gray crystals and a print that mirrors denim.\n\nTheir mother-daughter relationship was highlighted in concert movie “Renaissance: A Film By Beyoncé,” as was Mathew Knowles, Beyoncé’s father and Tina Knowles’ former husband.\n\nIn behind the scenes footage and documentary-style interviews, Tina Knowles sits in the background, subtly supporting her daughter. She became more vocal on social media after the movie premiered, celebrating Beyoncé's wins and defending her against criticism.\n\nRead on to learn more about the parents of one of the most iconic performers of all time.\n\nBeyoncé's parents were married from 1980 to 2011\n\nTina and Mathew Knowles tied the knot in 1980 and were married for nearly 30 years. Tina Knowles filed for divorce in 2009, and the couple issued a joint statement to the Associated Press.\n\n“The decision to end our marriage is an amicable one. We remain friends, parents and business partners,” they said at the time. “If anyone is expecting an ugly messy fight, they will be sadly disappointed. We ask for your respect of our privacy as we handle this matter.”\n\nThe former couple finalized their divorce in 2011.\n\nBoth remarried following their divorce\n\nTina Knowles tied the knot with the actor Richard Lawson in 2015. She filed for divorce in July 2023, citing \"irreconcilable differences\" as the reason for the split.\n\nMeanwhile, Mathew Knowles said “I do” to model Gena Avery Knowles in 2013.\n\nThey share two children and four grandchildren\n\nTina and Mathew Knowles welcomed their first daughter, Beyoncé, on Sept. 4, 1981 (yes, she's a Virgo). Their second daughter, Solange, was born June 24, 1986. Both went on to have successful careers in the music industry.\n\nTina and Mathew Knowles also have four grandchildren: Solange's son with ex-husband Daniel Smith, Daniel Julez, 19, and Beyoncé's children with husband Jay-Z: Blue Ivy, 11, and twins Sir and Rumi, 6.\n\nKelly Rowland was an honorary daughter\n\nBeyoncé's father was the manager of Destiny's Child, the girl group that helped catapult her and bandmates to fame.\n\nWhen Destiny's Child bandmate Kelly Rowland was 11 years old, she moved in with the Knowles family, Tina Knowles said in a 2015 essay for TIME.\n\n\"You came to live with us when you were only 11 years old. You were the sweetest, most kind person I had ever met and you still are. You are also a true survivor. You never give up. Your discipline and drive always inspires me,\" Tina Knowles wrote.\n\nBeyoncé got her name from Tina\n\nWhen it came time to name her first born child, Tina Knowles took inspiration from her own maiden name, as reported by ET.\n\n“A lot of people don’t know that Beyoncé is my last name. It’s my maiden name,” she said in 2020 while appearing on the \"In My Heart With Heather Thomson\" podcast.\n\n“My name was Celestine Beyoncé, which at that time was not a cool thing to have that weird name. I wanted my name to be Linda Smith because those were the cool names,” she said.\n\nMathew Knowles managed his daughter's career until 2011\n\nMathew Knowles played an active role in building Beyoncé’s successful career and served as her manager until 2011. In a 2011 statement, the singer announced that they were parting ways professionally.\n\n“I am grateful for everything he has taught me,” she said at the time. “I grew up watching both he and my mother manage and own their own businesses. They were hardworking entrepreneurs and I will continue to follow in their footsteps.”\n\nIn his own statement, Mathew Knowles called the decision \"mutual,\" as reported by Billboard.\n\n\"We did great things together, and I know that she will continue to conquer new territories in music and entertainment,\" he said.\n\n“Business is business and family is family,” he continued. “I love my daughter and am very proud of who she is and all that she has achieved. I look forward to her continued great success.”\n\nMathew Knowles managed Destiny's Child and would love to see them reunite one day\n\nKnowles told ET in 2023 that he'd love it if Beyoncé, Rowland and Michelle Williams reunited. “It’s a decision that the ladies would have to make,” he said. \"And I would certainly, certainly support that decision as I still manage Destiny’s Child. I would love to see that as well.\"\n\nKnowles' time as a manager was criticized. Former band members LaTavia Roberson and LeToya Luckett both brought multiple lawsuits against Beyoncé, Rowland and their manager and Knowles’ father, Mathew Knowles, as well as the group’s label, Sony Music, all of which were settled out of court.\n\nTina Knowles helped create her daughter's ‘Austin Powers’ character\n\nBeyoncé made her screen debut in 2002 playing Foxxy Cleopatra in \"Goldmember.\"\n\nProducer John Lyons told Vulture in 2022 that Knowles-Lawson was present for her audition.\n\n“It was clear that (Beyoncé) was so nervous at that audition, and Tina came with her, both as moral support and, I’m sure, to size us up and see if we were going to be respectful of her daughter and if we deserved her,” producer John Lyons told the publication.\n\nOnce on set, Knowles-Lawson helped the character come to life.\n\n“Her mom was very much into blaxploitation movies,” director Jay Roach told Vulture. “She could tell that was the DNA for Foxxy. Her mom was so cool and so helpful and instantly had ideas for us.”\n\nBeyoncé gets her sense of style from her mom\n\nTina Knowles' fashion prowess, which was shouted out in \"Renaissance,\" has been part of Beyoncé's entire career.\n\nShe was Destiny's Child's official stylist and handmade some of their costumes. She reflected on that time in her career in an interview with The Washington Post.\n\nTheir wardrobe was inspired by Motown groups — which, she said, became a \"problem\" for other people connected to the group, who pressured her to make the band members look more like Christina Aguilera or Britney Spears.\n\n\"(The costumes) were just a little too flashy, a little too Motown, but what they really meant was that they were a little too Black,” she recalled.\n\nMathew Knowles survived breast cancer\n\nMathew Knowles announced that he had been diagnosed with breast cancer in 2019. In a statement to TODAY.com, he explained why he shared the private news publicly.\n\n“We need men to speak out! Men want to keep it hidden, because we feel embarrassed — and there’s no reason for that. I want to continue the dialogue on awareness and early detection — male or female. The key to this is early detection,” he said.\n\nTina Knowles is not afraid to stand up for herself\n\nIn January 2024, Tina Knowles said she learned an important lesson after she was criticized for liking a post that took issue with Janet Jackson’s upcoming tour prices.\n\n“I am saddened by this,” she wrote on Instagram Jan. 24, captioning her video addressing the backlash of the perceived Jackson diss.\n\n“Janet Jackson is an icon and I would never question another artist. I took Destiny’s Child to see Janet when they were 15 years old,” she explained, noting the pop star’s influence on her daughter and the group.\n\n“They always looked up to her and she opened doors for Beyoncé,” her captioned continued. “Why would I hate on her?”\n\nIn the video, Knowles said she received a phone call that she’s “trending for liking a post about ticket prices of an artist.”\n\n“Being on the other side of it, I know better than anyone what a great production cost and that it’s expensive,” she said. “And I would never criticize another artist, let alone Janet Jackson who is the queen of production and her family. They’re the first family of music. Always have been and always will be and I love and respect them.”\n\nReflecting on her experience, Knowles said she learned a valuable lesson: “Stay way from negativity.”\n\n“If you follow me, then you know that I am not involved in mess,” she said. “What I am guilty of is liking post, going through when I’m in a big hurry and I don’t have time to really and liking things because I trust that these are people that I follow. That was a big mistake. I will never do it again.”\n\nTina Knowles is her daughter's biggest fan\n\nDon't mess with Mama Tina! Knowles regularly comes to Beyoncé's defense when necessary. Most recently, she slammed critics who suggested that Beyoncé bleached her skin for the premiere of her concert film, \"Renaissance.\"\n\n“How sad is it that some of her own people continue the stupid narrative with hate and jealousy. Duh, she wore silver hair to match her silver dress as a fashion statement...” she wrote on Instagram.\n\n“Every time she does something that she works her a-- off for and is a statement of her work ethic, talent and resilience,” she continued. “Here you sad little haters come out the woodwork. Jealousy and racism, sexism, double standards, you perpetuate those things. Instead of celebrating a sister or just ignoring if you don’t like her.”\n\n“I am sick of you losers,” she finished. “I know that she is going to be pissed at me for doing this, but I am fed up! This girl minds her own business. She helps people whenever she can. She lifts up & promotes black women and underdogs at all times.”\n\nKnowles also defended her daughter when critics slammed Beyoncé for wanting to do country music for her new album.\n\nIn response to the naysayers, Knowles posted a photo montage on Instagram, which included many throwback photos of her daughter in cowboy attire.\n\n“I just came across this video on my IG feed! We have always celebrated Cowboy Culture growing up in Texas,” Knowles wrote.\n\n“When people ask why is Beyonce wearing cowboy hats? It’s really funny, I actually laugh because it’s been there since she was a kid ,we went to rodeos every year and my whole family dressed in western fashion,” she added. “Solange did a whole brilliant Album and Project based on Black Cowboy Culture. . It definitely was a part of our culture growing up.\""
