        "text": "The Queen is returning to her hive this weekend.\n\nOn Saturday, Sept 23 and Sunday, Sept. 24, Beyoncé will headline at her hometown Houston’s NRG Stadium for two huge nights as part of her ongoing ‘Renaissance Tour.’\n\nAnd she’s got a trick up her sleeve, too.\n\nWord on the street is Megan Thee Stallion will be making an appearance on at least one night according to Page Six.\n\nThere’s only one problem.\n\nIf you want to attend, last-minute tickets are going to cost you a pretty penny.\n\nAt the time of publication, the lowest price we could find was $414 before fees on Vivid Seats.\n\nWhile that may seem expensive, when you factor in that fans were regularly paying over $1000 to see Taylor Swift live earlier this year, they suddenly don’t seem quite so bad.\n\nPlus, given that Queen Bey typically performs over 30 tracks each and every night, it’s clear that she puts on a show that must be experienced live.\n\nWant to see Beyoncé before it’s too late this year?\n\nHere’s everything you need to know and more about the two Houston shows on the 2023 ‘Renaissance Tour.’\n\nAll prices listed above are subject to fluctuation.\n\nBeyoncé 2023 tour schedule\n\nA complete breakdown of all the best prices on tickets for each of Beyoncé’s Houston concerts can be found below.\n\n(Note: The New York Post confirmed all above prices at the publication time. All prices are subject to fluctuation and include additional fees at checkout.)\n\nVivid Seats is a verified secondary market ticketing platform, and prices may be higher or lower than face value, depending on demand.\n\nThey offer a 100% buyer guarantee that states your transaction will be safe and secure and your tickets will be delivered prior to the event.\n\nBeyoncé ‘Renaissance Tour’ review\n\nCertified Bey superfan Georgie Exinord went to a ‘Renaissance Tour’ show before Mrs. Knowles-Carter came stateside.\n\nIf you’re planning on seeing Beyoncé live this year, here’s everything you need to know.\n\nHuge stars on tour in 2023\n\nMany of the biggest stars around are touring all over the U.S. these next few months.\n\nHere are just five of our favorite artists you won’t want to miss live when they come to a city near you.\n\n• SZA\n\n• Janelle Monáe\n\n• Lauryn Hill and the Fugees\n\n• Doja Cat with Ice Spice\n\n• Diana Ross"
