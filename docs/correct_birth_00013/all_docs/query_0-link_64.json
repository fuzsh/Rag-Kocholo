        "text": "In 1755, the British laid siege to the fort of Beauséjour (near present-day Sackville, New Brunswick). Though the French surrendered, Broussard and his men still tried to attack the soldiers that were guarding it and even capturing a British officer. He was commended for his bravery by the French commander. At this time, the British started deporting Acadians from their homes, which likely led Broussard and his family to flee into the woods. For the next five years or so, Broussard and his sons continued to fight the British and tried to hamper their efforts. Even after the fall of Québec and Louisbourg (on Cape Breton) in 1761, a few Acadians were still fighting back. British colonel William Forster wrote of these Acadians: “These people are Spirited up in their obstinacy by one BeauSoleil . . . and one or two others who have already rendered themselves so obnoxious to the English that they are conscious of the treatment they deserve at our hands.” By November, a starving and destitute Broussard surrendered. He and his family were imprisoned for the next two years until the Treaty of Paris was signed. Legend has it that Broussard then sailed to Saint-Domingue, Hispaniola (present-day Haiti) with a group of Acadians. Finding it difficult to adjust to the hot and humid climate, the Acadians left Hispaniola in 1765 and sailed for Louisiana instead. Broussard was appointed militia captain of the Acadians in the region of the Attakapas, which included the parishes of Saint-Landry, Saint-Martin and Lafayette. He died in October of that year and was buried at Beausoleil, near present-day Broussard.\n\nDid you know that famed Franco-American singer-songwriter and poet Zachary Richard wrote a poem about Broussard? It is called the Ballad of Beausoleil. Read it here."
