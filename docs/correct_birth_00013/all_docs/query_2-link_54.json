She was depressed for two years.\n\nHer mother used to design her costumes when she was part of the band ‘Destiny Child’.\n\nBeyonce and Jay Z hold the Guinness World Record for being the Highest Power Earning Couple because they earned $122 million in the year 2010.\n\nBeyonce also holds a record of maximum tweets per second for announcing her pregnancy. It’s not just any record but a Guinness World Record.\n\nHer daughter Blue Ivy is the youngest person alive to appear on the Billboard. Jay Z recorded her crying in his song ‘Glory’.\n\nHer voice-type is mezzo-soprano.\n\nSasha Fierce was her alter ego that she needed to shed off the shyness.\n\nShe was named as the most beautiful woman of 2010 by People Magazine.\n\nBeyonce has a very different relationship with music. She said, “I see music. It’s more than just what I hear (…) When I’m connected to something, I immediately see a visual or a series of images that are tied to a feeling or an emotion-a memory from my childhood, thoughts about life, my dreams or my fantasies. And they’re all connected to the music.”\n\nShe was the first person who was from a non-sports background and still was on the cover of Sports Illustrated’s swimsuit issue in 2007.\n\nShe won six Grammys in a one Grammy Awards Show night creating history and an all time record at the time.\n\nBeyonce’s father used to make all the girls of Destiny’s Child sing while jogging, so that have good stamina and lung power.\n\nShe was teased for her big ears in school and the kids teased her saying that they are bigger than her head.\n\nTo sing in front of her parent’s friends, she used to charge them $5 to entertain. No wonder, She is a good entrepreneur.\n\nShe suffered depression after her band mate sued Beyonce’s father for mismanagement.\n\nShe said if she met her alter ego Sasha Fierce backstage, she wouldn’t like it. In 2010, she said that she can handle it now and can merge both of her personalities and would like for people to see her for what she is.\n\nIn February 2023, Beyoncé, with 32 Grammy awards, broke Hungarian-British conductor Georg Solti’s record for most Grammy awards in the ceremony’s history. She also tied with her husband Jay-Z as the most nominated artist in Grammy history.\n\nIn May 2024, her name was featured on the “Blockout 2024 list” for her alleged silence on the situation in Gaza. Blockout 2024 is a movement on social media, where users are asked to block/unfollow celebrities who have remained silent on Israel’s attacks on Gaza."
