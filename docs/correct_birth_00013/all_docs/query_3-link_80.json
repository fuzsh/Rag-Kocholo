That would add up to - which amounts to $22,000 a year if she wore a pair every day.\n\nBeyoncé is a client of Jacob the Jeweler, which sells watches and jewelry worth $200,000 to $1 million – and has been known to wear several pieces by designer Lorraine Schwartz valued at $7.5 million.\n\nOn one holiday alone, the performer was said to have packed clothes worth $25,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNBA games to the finest restaurants.\n\nBeyoncé and her family are regulars at NBA games, where the average cost of a courtside ticket is about $2,000, according to Sportskeeda.\n\nThe couple have been spotted at Le Cirque, one of New York's most exclusive restuarants and in 2013 reportedly spent almost $100,000 on drinks for VIP guests at an Atlanta nightclub.\n\nAt home Beyoncé is said to employ a $7,500 a month live-in chef and a $4,000 a month dietician, but while on the Renaissance tour she hired a vegan chef and three personal chefs for herself and her inner circle, The New York Times reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo expenses spared with gifts.\n\nFor her first birthday Blue Ivy was given an $80,000 diamond-encrusted Barbie doll, on top of a $100,000 birthday party and a $600,000 gold rocking horse.\n\nBefore the twins Rumi and Sir were born, the couple splurged on matching gold cribs costing $75,000.\n\nAll three children have been decked out in designer clothes from the likes of Gucci.
