Stratified Epithelium

Stratified Squamous Epithelium

This epithelium consists of rounded cells that push their daughter cells up and away from the underlying blood supply. As they get pushed up, the cells become flattened and die. The surface layer consists of dead cells. On dry surfaces, like the skin, the cells are formed into a hard, dry substance called keratin.

Stratified Cuboidal and Columnar Epithelia

These types of epithelia are rare in the body.

Transitional Epithelium

This epithelium covers surfaces in the urinary tract that are subject to periodic stretching. The cells are capable of moving over each other to allow repeated stretching and relaxation.
