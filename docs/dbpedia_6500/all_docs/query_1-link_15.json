        "text": "Mechanism\n\nEpithelialization\n\nThe process of epithelialization has been studied primarily in the context of skin reepithelialization during wound healing. Skin is composed of three main layers, from superficial to deep: epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue. The epidermis is created by stratified squamous epithelium and can further be broken down into multiple layers, again from superficial to deep: stratum corneum, stratum lucidum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, and stratum basale.[9]\n\nKeratinocytes are the primary component of the epidermis and play a key role in wound healing and maintaining the outer skin barrier. Keratinocytes proliferate in the basal layer, differentiate as they rise through the granular layer, lose their nucleus and flatten to become the superficial layer of skin, the stratum corneum. Deficits in this process can result in delayed wound healing.[3]\n\nKeratinocytes proliferate in the basal layer and are composed of keratin intermediate filaments K5 and K14. As the keratinocytes rise into the suprabasal layers, they characteristically differentiate into K1 and K10. The lamellar granules produce lipids and proteins in the granular layer and fill in the crevices between the keratinocytes in the stratum corneum. High molecular weight polymers form via the crossing of cornified envelope proteins (loricrin, involucrin, filaggrin). The cornified envelope is formed through the process of terminal differentiation, where the keratinocyte becomes dehydrated and flattens into a polyhedron referred to as terminal corneocyte. The lipid layer fills in between the corneocytes, functioning as the \"mortar\" and corneocytes as \"bricks.\" This lipid layer is essential for keeping water in the body.[3]\n\nThe cells change from dividing to non-dividing cells during keratinocyte differentiation as they migrate to the surface through the granular layer. Three major MAP kinase pathways regulate this process. These pathways are activated by calcium influx, epidermal growth factor, and tumor necrosis factor. The process also uses protein kinase C isoforms. Once keratinocytes turn profilaggrin into filaggrin, they undergo changes into late terminal differentiation and are irreversibly committed to the process of differentiation. Differentiation ends when proteolytic and nucleolytic activity destroys the cellular organelles and DNA. Increased intracellular calcium forms the cornified envelope by activating transglutaminase, which covalently crosslinks structural proteins such as loricrin, involucrin, and filaggrin. Finally, insoluble lipids attach, and the outermost layer of the epidermis is complete.[3]\n\nThe epidermal barrier is maintained by skin calmodulin-related factor (Scarf), which senses calcium and regulates the protein function in the skin barrier. Keratinocytes constantly renew to maintain this barrier. The renewing capabilities of the skin are driven by the population of epidermal stem cells (ESC). ESCs are found in three distinct niches: the bulge of hair follicles, the base of sebaceous glands, and the basal layer of the interfollicular epidermis. Each ESC niche replenishes its compartment; therefore, the depth of a wound and damage to these structures affects the skin’s ability to re-epithelialize.[3]\n\nReepithelialization in Wound Healing\n\nThere are four distinct but overlapping phases of wound healing: hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling (maturation).[2] Tissue injury triggers hemostasis and the inflammatory phase, dominated by the release of inflammatory mediators, neutrophils, and macrophages traveling to the wound site to phagocytize bacteria and initiate the proliferative phase. The proliferative phase refers to the formation of new granulation tissue filling the wound, followed by the remodeling phase, where collagen fibers become more organized and strengthen the wound.[3]\n\nThe hemostasis and inflammatory phase of wound healing are closely linked and begin with the release of cytokines and vasoactive substances, such as histamine and serotonin, causing increased vessel permeability. This increased permeability allows for the recruitment of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages to the wound site. Blood constituents also leak into the area and activate the clotting cascade. These blood clots serve as a matrix for cells to adhere and migrate into the wound and become a source of growth factors for fibroblasts and inflammatory cells. The first 48 hours following a tissue injury are predominated by the inflammatory phase, with neutrophils cleaning the wound and phagocytosing bacteria.[3] Important cytokines for wound repair are also released, which initiate the proliferative phase, such as IL-1, IL-6, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and TGF-beta.[10]\n\nAs the inflammatory phase of wound healing ends, the proliferative phase begins, and granulation tissue forms. The onset of the proliferative phase is marked by the proliferation of fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Fibroblasts form structural proteins that make collagen and increase the strength of the wound. Angiogenesis also occurs to provide oxygen and nutrients to the new granulated tissue. Once the bed of granulation tissue is laid, reepithelialization can take place.[3]\n\nWithin hours of skin trauma, keratinocytes along the edges of the wound, around hair follicles, and surrounding sebaceous glands are activated by monocytes and neutrophils to migrate and proliferate to re-epithelialize the area with skin cells.[10] Basal cell keratinocytes release their attachment to the underlying dermis and migrate across the wound to cover its surface, going through rapid mitotic division as the cells move across each other in a \"leapfrog\" fashion, advancing in a sheet across the wound.[3]\n\nKeratinocytes must undergo a structural transformation at the cellular layer to migrate across the wound. The cells lengthen, flatten, and develop actin filaments and pseudopodia, which serve as temporary protrusions for movement.[11] The keratinocytes then lose their hemidesmosome attachment to the surrounding cells. Integrins (proteins for attachment) are released and relocated to actin filaments that pull the keratinocytes into the wound. The keratinocytes migrate into and adhere to the newly formed wound matrix. These changes in the keratinocyte cytoskeleton allow for increased cell flexibility and migration of keratinocytes and are classically marked by changes in the expression of keratin-6 and keratin-16.[1]\n\nActivated keratinocytes and fibroblasts in the dermis release growth factors such as keratinocyte growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor that help to regulate this process. Keratinocytes continue proliferating at the wound edges and migrating to cover the wound until they meet in the middle. Some sources report that well-approximated wounds can re-epithelialize within 48 hours; others report the process of epithelialization generally takes 2 to 3 weeks.[10] The faster this process occurs, the less scarring there is. Thick scabs over a wound can inhibit the ability of the keratinocytes to migrate across the wound and, in turn, increase healing time."
