        "text": "Structure\n\nEpithelial cells are the building blocks of epithelial tissue. Like every other cell, they are surrounded by cellular membranes. Epithelial cell membranes have three regions (domains) different in structure and function; apical, lateral and basal. This feature is called membrane polarity.\n\nPolarity\n\nEach membrane pole exhibits various features. These can include receptors and channels for transportation of substances that the epithelial cell needs to internalize or expel, or membrane specializations.\n\nApical poles project towards the external surface or the lumen of an organ which epithelia cover, which is why they’re also called free surfaces or free domains. This pole may also show apical membrane specializations which alter the shape of this surface. Lateral surfaces are the sites where adjacent cells interconnect, forming tightly packed contiguous cells. Basal surfaces are in contact with the underlying basement membrane. As both lateral and basal surfaces are adjusted to interact with surrounding structures, they’re often mentioned together as a basolateral surface.\n\nApical specializations\n\nApical specializations are different types of fingerlike cytoplasmic extensions of the apical surface. They differ in their length, motility and function. There are three types of specializations;\n\nMicrovilli - are microscopic protrusions of the cell membrane which mainly function to increase the apical surface area for absorption. Large quantities of microvilli are said to form a 'brush border', due to their appearance in histological preparation. The enterocytes of the small intestine has such specializations to facilitate absorption of food in the gut.\n\nStereocilia - a type of microvilli, but these are immotile and longer than microvilli. Their functions are absorption (epididymis and ductus deferens) and mechano-sensory reception (inner ear)\n\nCilia - fingerlike structures present on almost every epithelial cell. There are three types of cilia; motile, non-motile (primary) and nodal. Their respective functions are; removing foreign particles from the epithelial surface, transportation of signals from the ECM to the intracellular space, and fetal development.\n\nJunctions\n\nIntercellular junctions are protein complexes on the basolateral cell membranes of epithelial cells. Their functions are to establish membrane polarity, connect adjacent cells and anchor the epithelial tissue to the connective tissue underneath it. There are five main types of junctions:\n\nTight junctions (occluding junctions) – a complex intercellular junction that blocks the intercellular space between adjacent cells making it impassable.\n\nAdhering junctions and desmosomes – connect the cytoskeletons of adjacent cells.\n\nCommunicating (gap) junctions – passageways between adjacent cells that allow the transfer of small molecules between adjacent cells.\n\nAnchoring junctions (hemidesmosomes) – a cell matrix junction that anchors the cell to the basement membrane.\n\nExtracellular matrix\n\nEpithelial cells are aligned into one or more rows, separated by thin layers of extracellular matrix. The deepest row (basal domain) produces a layer of specialized extracellular matrix called the basement membrane. This membrane demarcates the epithelial tissue from the underlying connective tissue. Remember hemidesmosomes? These and other cell-to-extracellular matrix junctions anchor epithelial cells to the underlying basement membrane.\n\nA layer of connective tissue called the lamina propria, attaches to the basal surface of the basement membrane. Lamina propria holds the epithelial tissue glued to the deep tissues and contains blood vessels that supply the epithelial tissue.\n\nTissue\n\nLet’s round this all up to understand how epithelial cells make the epithelial tissue. So, epithelial cells are tightly packed into one or more layers, held together by a variety of intercellular junctions. The deepest layer sits on a basement membrane, while the surface layer is free. Epithelial tissue is avascular but innervated. Nutrients are supplied by diffusion from blood vessels of the lamina propria. Epithelia contain stem cells in their basement membranes which enable continuous epithelial renewal. Some epithelia renew very fast (skin), while others do it at a slower pace.\n\nGet started with histology of tissues here.\n\nTypes of epithelial tissue\n\nEpithelial tissue is classified based on the cell shape and the number of cell layers.\n\nCell shape: squamous, cuboidal, columnar\n\nCell layers: simple (one layer), stratified (multiple layers).\n\nWhen there are multiple layers, it is the most superficial surface cell layer (apical domain) that defines the shape classification. There are additional subclasses of epithelial classification for cells that have specializations (e.g. ciliated epithelium).\n\nSquamous epithelial cells appear squashed or flattened, like flakes or fish scales. The cells are wider than they are tall, with an oval shaped nucleus. Cuboidal epithelial cells are square shaped cells, they have a similar width to height ratio. The nucleus is large, round and centrally located, and the cytoplasm is rich with organelles.\n\nColumnar epithelial cells have a rectangular or column shape, meaning that they are taller than they are wide. The nucleus is also elongated, having a long oval shape. They have an organelle rich cytoplasm. These cells may have apical projections, such as microvilli or cilia. Columnar epithelial cells can be modified to produce mucous or other secretions, or form specialized sensory receptors.\n\nSimple\n\nSimple epithelium consists of one layer of epithelial cells lying on a basement membrane. Cells can be squamous, cuboidal and columnar.\n\nSimple squamous epithelium – a single layer of thin flattened cells. This type of epithelium forms thin delicate sheets of cells through which molecules can easily pass (diffusion, filtration). Contiguous squamous epithelial cells also provide a smooth flat surface over which fluids and other tissues can move with low friction. This type does not offer great protection, in fact in some environments the cells can be shed (desquamate). Simple squamous epithelium can be found lining capillaries, inside of blood vessels (endothelium), alveoli of the lungs, glomeruli of the kidneys, the heart (endocardium) and serous membranes (mesothelium).\n\nSimple cuboidal epithelium – a single layer of cube-shaped cells. This type of epithelium offers greater protection than simple squamous due to its increased thickness. It also has secretory, absorptive and excretory functions because of its organelle rich cytoplasm. Simple cuboidal epithelium is found in organs with these functions, such as the ducts of the salivary glands, liver, pancreas and other exocrine glands. It forms thyroid follicles, kidney tubules, seminiferous tubules of male testis, and covers the surface of the ovaries (germinal epithelium).\n\nTest what you've learned about the simple epithelium with the following quiz.\n\nSimple columnar epithelium – a single layer of column shaped cells. Similar to cuboidal, it can have protection, secretion, absorption and excretion functions owing to its thickness and organelle rich cytoplasm. This epithelium often includes apical specializations (i.e. microvilli, cilia) which enhance its absorptive function or offer motility. Simple columnar epithelium can be found in the walls of the stomach, intestines and gallbladder.\n\nLearn more about simple epithelium here.\n\nPseudostratified\n\nPseudostratified epithelium is a type of simple columnar epithelium. It is termed “pseudo” because, although single, it appears to have multiple layers. All the cells are attached to the basement membrane but not all of them reach the free surface, thus forming a sheet of cells with different heights and irregularly located nuclei.\n\nThere are types of pseudostratified columnar epithelium with cilia (upper respiratory pathways, uterine tubes), with stereocilia (epididymis) and without any apical specializations (ductus deferens).\n\nStratified\n\nStratified epithelium consists of two or more cell layers. Based on the shape of their most apical cell layer, they are further classified into squamous, cuboidal and columnar. There are also two types of specialized stratified epithelium: keratinized and transitional.\n\nStratified squamous epithelium – multiple layers of flat squamous epithelia which provide protection against abrasion and water loss. This type is further divided into keratinized and non-keratinized. Non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium does not desquamate. It lines the oral cavity, esophagus, larynx, vagina and anal canal, and the outer layer of the cornea.\n\nStratified cuboidal epithelium - also functions as a protective tissue layer. It lines the excretory ducts of the sweat glands, large ducts of excretory glands, the anorectal junction and surrounds ovarian follicles.\n\nStratified columnar epithelium - less common than the other stratified types. It has the secretion and protective functions of all columnar epithelia. Examples of where this epithelial type can be found includes; covering the conjunctiva of the eye and in the largest ducts of exocrine glands. A special type of this epithelium forms sensory epithelium. Here, the columnar cells have various apical specializations modified to detect the various types of stimuli received by human sensory organs. Thus they are found in the retina of the eye (microvilli), taste buds on the tongue (microvilli), organ of Corti (stereocilia) and ampullae in the inner ear (microvilli, stereocilia and cilia).\n\nWhy not test your knowledge of the stratified epithelium with some quiz questions?\n\nKeratinized epithelium - is a specialized stratified squamous epithelium in which the most apical (superficial) cells are dead and cyclically desquamate. The cells lose their nucleus and cytoplasm, and instead contain a tough protein called keratin which has waterproof properties. It is found in the epidermis of the skin.\n\nFind out more about stratified epithelium here.\n\nTransitional\n\nTransitional epithelium is a type of stratified epithelium found in organs able to distend. It is called transitional as its superficial cells can change their shape (for example, from cuboidal to squamous) when the organ stretches. It is featured only in some parts of the urinary tract; renal calyces, ureters and urinary bladder, which is why it can also be termed the urothelium.\n\nStruggling with epithelial tissues?
