        "text": "b. Simple cuboidal epithelial cells are involved in the filtering of blood in the kidney.\n\nSimple cuboidal epithelial cells line tubules in the mammalian kidney, where they are involved in filtering the blood. Hence, option (b) is true and is the incorrect answer.\n\nc. Pseudostratisfied columnar epithilia occur in a single layer, but the arrangement of nuclei makes it appear that more than one layer is present.\n\nColumnar epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract appear to be stratified. However, each cell is attached to the base membrane of the tissue and, therefore, they are simple tissues. The nuclei are arranged at different levels in the layer of cells, making it appear as though there is more than one layer. This is called pseudostratified, columnar epithelia. hence, option (c) is true and is the incorrect answer.\n\nd. Transitional epithelia change in thickness depending on how full the bladder is.\n\nTransitional or uroepithelial cells appear only in the urinary system, primarily in the bladder and ureter. These cells are arranged in a stratified layer, but they have the capability of appearing to pile up on top of each other in a relaxed, empty bladder. As the urinary bladder fills, the epithelial layer unfolds and expands to hold the volume of urine introduced into it. As the bladder fills, it expands and the lining becomes thinner. In other words, the tissue transitions from thick to thin. Hence, option (d) is true and is the incorrect answer."
