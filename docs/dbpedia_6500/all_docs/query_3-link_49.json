        "text": "Layers in the Epidermis\n\nThis diagram shows schematically, the four different layers found in the epidermis of most skin (thin skin).\n\nThis epidermis of skin is a keratinized, stratified, squamous epithelium.\n\nCells divide in the basal layer, and move up through the layers above, changing their appearance as they move from one layer to the next. It takes around 2-4 weeks for this to happen. This continuous replacement of cells in the epidermal layer of skin is important. The epidermal layer of the skin (and digestive tract) are the two tissues that are directly exposed to the outside world, and therefore are most vulnerable to its damaging effects. In both, there is constant proliferation of cells in the bottom layer (stratum basale) which constantly move up to the top where they are lost. This means damaged cells are continually shed, and replaced with new cells."
