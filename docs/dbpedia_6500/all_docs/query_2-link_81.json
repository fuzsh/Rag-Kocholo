        "text": "Module 1: Tissues I – Epithelial and Connective\n\nTerms to Know\n\nThe Building BLocks\n\n*This content will be reviewed and built upon in lecture.\n\nBefore you begin to study the different structures and functions of the human body, it is helpful to consider its basic architecture; that is, how its smallest parts are assembled into larger structures ((Figure)). Though this organization begins at the atomic and chemical levels, in this course we will only discuss structures as small as the cellular level, and only in the context of the cells that make up specific tissues. You will learn more about the cellular, molecular, and chemical levels of organization in other courses.\n\nA cell is the smallest independently functioning unit of a living organism.\n\nTissues are composed of many cells that work together to perform a specific function.\n\nAn organ is an anatomically distinct structure of the body composed of two or more tissue types. Each organ performs one or more specific physiological functions.\n\nAn organ system is a group of organs that work together to perform major functions or meet physiological needs of the body.\n\nThere are four categories of tissues: epithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Epithelial tissue, also referred to as epithelium, refers to the sheets of cells that line all surfaces of the body. Connective tissue binds together, protects, and supports structures of the body. We will cover epithelial tissue and connective tissue in this module. Muscle tissue and nervous tissue will be covered in the next module. Muscle tissue contracts to cause movement, while nervous tissue sends electrical signals to allow communication throughout the body.\n\nThis tissue is highly cellular, with little or no extracellular material present between cells.\n\nEpithelial tissues are avascular, meaning they do not contain blood vessels. Instead, they receive nutrients by diffusion or absorption from the underlying tissues or occasionally from substances on the surface.\n\nMany epithelial tissues are capable of regeneration, or rapidly replacing damaged and dead cells. Sloughing off of damaged or dead cells is a characteristic of surface epithelium and allows our airways and digestive tracts to rapidly replace damaged cells with new cells.\n\nThe epithelial cells exhibit polarity, with differences in structure and function between the exposed or apical surface of the cell, the free surface away from underlying tissue, and the basal surface attached to the underlying tissue.\n\nThe basement membrane sits just below the basal surface of epithelial cells and anchors the cells to the underlying tissue. It is formed of two layers: the basal lamina, which attaches to the basal aspect of the cells, and the reticular lamina, which is attached to the underlying connective tissue.\n\nApical Features\n\nTwo microscopic extensions can be found on the apical surface of some cells.\n\nCilia: extensions from the apical surface of the cell that beat in unison to move fluids as well as trapped particles across the surface of the epithelium (surface parallel transport).\n\nMicrovilli: extensions that serve to increase the surface area of the apical aspect of the cell for absorption. More surface area means more space for substances to contact the apical surface and be absorbed into the cell.\n\nIntercellular Junctions\n\nEpithelial cells are closely connected and are not separated by intracellular material. These cells are held together or interact with each other via junctions, or connections between the cells. Three of these junctions hold the cells together, while one allows for cell-to-cell communication.\n\nTight junction: Holds cells together so there is no extracellular space between them. Tight junctions prevent substances from moving between the cells, instead forcing them to go through the cells. This enables the epithelia to act as a selective barrier.\n\nAdhering junction (adherens): Acts like a belt holding the epithelial cells together for support and stability of the tissue.\n\nDesmosome: Holds cells together like a push button on a jacket to provide support and stability of the tissue.\n\nGap junction: Forms an intercellular passageway between the membranes of adjacent cells to facilitate the movement of small molecules and ions between the cytoplasm of adjacent cells. These junctions allow electrical and metabolic coupling of adjacent cells, which coordinates function in large groups of cells.\n\nThinner epithelium allows for faster and easier transport of substances across the surface, so it functions to allow transcellular (through the cell) transport via simple diffusion. The thicker the epithelium is (cuboidal to columnar), the more space there is for intracellular machinery needed to produce substances for secretion or process substances that have been absorbed before releasing it into the underlying tissue. Stratified epithelium has multiple layers, meaning there are more layers to lose before damaging the underlying tissue. Therefore, stratified epithelium always has a protective function.\n\nThere are several different kinds of epithelium based on different combinations of the shape and number of layers of cells. Note that the name of stratified epithelium is determined by the shape of the cell at the most superficial layer, furthest from the underlying connective tissue. You are responsible for knowing the information in the following table:\n\nType of Epithelium Structure Function Location\n\nSimple Squamous\n\nA single layer of flat, thin cells. Allows materials to pass through quickly via simple diffusion or filtration. Located in places where we need substances to pass quickly and relatively easily through the epithelium. Example: The alveoli, or air sacs, in our lungs.\n\nSimple Cuboidal\n\nA single layer of cuboidal-shaped cells, as wide as they are tall. May have microvilli on the surface in some locations. Secretion & absorption The cuboidal shape allows for some space for intracellular processing of absorbed substances or production of substances to be secreted without being overly-thick. It is located in regions that benefit from this structure-function relationship. Example: Certain glands, kidney tubules\n\nSimple Columnar\n\nA single layer of cells that are taller than they are wide. These epithelial cells sometimes have microvilli. Absorption & secretion The columnar shape allows ample space for intracellular processing of absorbed substances or production of substances to be secreted. It is located in areas that benefit from this structure-function relationship. Example: Digestive tract\n\nPseudostratified Columnar\n\nA single layer of cells of different shapes and sizes, with only some of the cells reaching the free surface of the tissue. This gives it a stratified appearance despite actually being a single layer of cells. It contains cilia on the apical surface. Surface parallel transport (moving substances across the free surface of the epithelium). Also secretion of mucous The cilia function to move substances along the surface of the epithelium primarily in locations without smooth muscle to move the substances through a tract. Example: Trachea\n\nStratified Squamous\n\nMultiple layers of flat, thin cells. Cells at the basal surface may be thicker, more cuboidal in shape, but they flatten as they reach the apical surface. Protection More layers means more layers to lose before damage reaches the underlying tissue. Therefore, it is found in places exposed to physical and chemical wear and tear. Example: Skin (keratinized epithelium, keratin is found in the cells in the superficial layers), esophagus (non-keratinized)\n\nStratified Cuboidal\n\nMultiple layers of cells with the most superficial cells being cuboidal in shape. ***This epithelium is rare, and we will not ask you about it on an exam. Protection Example: Found in some glands\n\nStratified Columnar\n\nMultiple layers of cells with the most superficial cells being columnar in shape. ***This epithelium is rare, and we will not as you about it on an exam. Protection & secretion Example: Male urethra, some glands\n\nTransitional\n\nSpecial epithelium with layers of epithelial cells that stretch when the organ is distended. Allows urinary organs to expand and stretch, such as when the bladder fills with urine. Example: Bladder, ureters, urethra\n\n–"
