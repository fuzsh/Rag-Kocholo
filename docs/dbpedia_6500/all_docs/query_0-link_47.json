        "text": "Tumors of the Urinary Bladder in Domesticated Animals\n\nGeorge T. Bryan, Samuel M. Cohen in The Pathology of Bladder Cancer, 2017\n\nAdenomas are composed of a large number of glandular structures separated from one another by a variable amount of connective tissue. The epithelium forming the glands consists of a single layer of columnar cells. The amount of mucin in the epithelial cells varies. In some there is only a small amount situated in the cell substance nearest the lumen, whereas in others there is an amount large enough to produce goblet-type cells. Frequently the glands are distended into thin-walled cystic spaces filled with mucin and desquamated cells. The arrangement of the cells lining the glands is orderly and mitotic figures are exceedingly rare. Adenomas do not invade the muscular layers of the bladder wall. They develop either from the preexisting glands in the mucosa or from the transitional cell epithelium through metaplastic changes. The most common adenomas in cattle and dogs are those of metaplastic origin. Endometrial or nephrogenic adenomas have not been reported in animals.\n\nHistogenesis of Irreversible Changes in the Female Genital Tract After Perinatal Exposure to Hormones and Related Substances\n\nTakao Mori, Hiroshi Nagasawa in Toxicity of Hormones in Perinatal Life, 2020\n\nBased on results from several different types of studies, researchers concluded that the pseudostratified columnar epithelium in the mouse Mullerian vagina undergoes a transformation into a squamous epithelium.2 Parallel with this transformation is a high mitotic activity. Cells arising in the columnar epithelium migrate basally, forming a basal epithelial zone of small cuboidal cells which are the origin of the adult squamous epithelium. Superficially in the epithelium, there is a zone of remaining columnar cells. Under estrogen stimulation, the cells in the basal zone proliferate and cornify with shedding of the superficial columnar cells. The transformation progresses into the CCC until it reaches the level of the squamo-columnar junction, situated in the uppermost part of the CCC of the NMRI mouse strain used in our laboratory. Vaginal morphogenesis is similar in the mouse and the rat but initial stages occurring in the mouse after birth appear in the rat shortly before birth.\n\nThe Many Faces of Neoplasia\n\nJeremy R. Jass in Understanding Pathology, 2020\n\nColumnar epithelium lines the gastrointestinal tract (stomach, small intestine and large intestine) as well as the lung. The gut serves to absorb nutrients but also secretes mucus and digestive enzymes. Tissues that secrete are described as glandular and a simple gland is shaped like a microscopic flask or test tube and is lined by columnar or cuboidal epithelium. The secretions pass into the central space or lumen of the gland and then pour into the gut cavity. Carcinomas arising in such glandular tissues are called adenocarcinomas, and are recognised by the presence of gland-like structures which secrete mucus. Cystic spaces with mucoid contents may be apparent on gross inspection of the cut surface. Adenocarcinomas also arise from solid (as opposed to tube-like) organs that are essentially glandular in structure. Examples are the prostate, pancreas, breast and endocrine glands. Adenocarcinomas are graded as well, moderately and poorly differentiated on the basis of gland formation (Fig. 28)."
