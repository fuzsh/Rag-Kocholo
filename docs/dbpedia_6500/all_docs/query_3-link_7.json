        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nEpithelia have a characteristic cellular architecture composed of distinct protein expression profiles within different strata of cells.1 For example, the major cell types of the pseudostratified epithelium of the central airways have been well characterized.2 Unlike the normal central airway epithelium, the human true vocal fold epithelium contains regions of stratified squamous epithelium. The expression of various cellular markers has been observed in different cells of this epithelium; however, to date these cells have not been correlated to one another, and the topological arrangement of these cells has not been comprehensively scrutinized.3,4 Such a foundation has proven essential in classifying disorders of the epidermis.\n\nWe hypothesize that the true vocal fold epithelium has a cellular architecture and organization similar to the stratified squamous epithelia found in the skin,5 cornea,6 oral mucosa, and esophagus,7 where molecular markers and cellular function of distinct layers of the epithelium have been defined. For example, the cells that directly attach to the basement membrane, basal cells, have been shown to function as stem cells in multiple squamous epithelia.5,8,9 These basal stem cells are thought to produce daughter cells, which move toward the lumen and then differentiate, forming distinct epithelial layers. This classic paradigm for the organization of a stratified epithelium is evident in the early histologic descriptions of the layered cells of the epidermis.10\n\nThis report defines distinct layers within the true vocal fold epithelium. Recent attempts to bioengineer laryngeal tissue11,12 and increasing interest in characterizing the early stages of laryngeal cancer13 require a precise definition of distinct layers in the normal state in order to assess whether bioengineered tissues mimic the endogenous organ or similarly to assess how premalignant cells are ordered differently than normal ones. This study defines a molecular nomenclature of the cells of the true vocal fold and thus lays a foundation for the characterization of the physiological and pathological changes that occur within the epithelium during regeneration and disease.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn this study, we aimed to present a molecular signature of newly identified distinct cell layers within the adult human stratified squamous epithelium of the true vocal fold. We first defined the region of stratified true vocal fold epithelium as an epithelium expressing CK13 in order to distinguish it from CK8-expressing ciliated epithelium. This definition eliminates the possibility that we assess laryngeal intermediate epithelium, which has features of both squamous and ciliated epithelium and which frequently expresses both CK8 and CK13.15,16 Intermediate epithelia, at various stages between columnar and squamous epithelium, have been described in the nasopharynx, the epiglottis, and in other parts of the larynx.17,18 Interestingly, in addition to its expression in normal stratified squamous epithelia, CK13 is also expressed in tissue undergoing squamous metaplasia, whereas reduced CK13 expression is associated with dysplasia and squamous cell cancer.19\n\nBecause several studies have examined the expression patterns of CKs by immunofluorescence and by polymerase chain reaction in normal and precancerous laryngeal tissues,3,4,20,21 and have correlated changes in CK expression with malignant progression, we characterized a battery of CK antibodies to define strata in normal laryngeal tissue. Indeed, we find that CK13 and CK14 together reliably and reproducibly mark every one of the cells of the epithelium, but they overlap considerably. Within the CK13+ cell layers, however, the involucrin+ subset of layers occurs at the luminal surface of the epithelium and likely represents the most mature differentiated squamous cells.22,23 Indeed, involucrin is known to be expressed at the surface of stratified squamous epithelia of the epidermis, hard palate, and buccal mucosa.24 Of note, an association between involucrin expression and well-differentiated tumors has been demonstrated in several studies.25,26\n\nBasal cells, on the other hand, are morphologically defined as those cells closest to the basement membrane and are often thought to represent the germinative stem cells of their respective tissues. Basal cells are generally known to express NGFR, CK14, and p63, in addition to other markers.13 After testing a battery of known basal cell markers within the true vocal fold stratified epithelium, we found that NGFR is the only reliable antibody that marks basal cells exclusively. Surprisingly, markers associated with the basal cells of other tissues (including p63) are normally detected in parabasal cells.\n\nSeveral studies of various epithelia have identified stem cells within the basal cell population, suggesting that the basal cell layer contains the least mature germinative cells of the epithelium.2,8,13 However, no definitive proof of a stem cell can be proffered without lineage tracing, and this has yet to be performed within the vocal fold epithelium. In many respiratory and epidermal epithelia, basal stem cells are the replicating workhorses of the epithelium. In contrast, we find that the vast majority of Ki67+ cells lie within the NGFR-CK13+CK14+ parabasal layer of cells. Because basal cells are often thought to represent stem cells, we speculate that the stem cells of the vocal fold epithelium are quiescent in analogy to the stem cells of the hematopoietic system.27 Instead, we suggest that the vocal fold epithelium maintains itself largely through a transit-amplifying set of parabasal progenitor cells. Perhaps the stem cell compartment is necessary to regenerate the epithelium after injury or infection, but normally it may represent a reserve population of protected cells. Because we find only very rare Ki67+ cells within the uppermost involucrin+ layers, this lends credence to the notion that involucrin defines the most mature differentiated cells within the epithelium of the true vocal fold, which presumably subsume an epithelial barrier function and provide physical integrity to the epithelial surface.\n\nIn all, we have attempted to provide a molecular roadmap for distinct populations of cells that exist within strata within the adult stratified squamous epithelium of the human true vocal fold. The distribution of markers suggests a functional segregation of different cell types, as well as a gradient of differentiation from basal stem cells to the most mature differentiated luminal squamous cells ( ). Additional studies on pure distinct cell populations will be required to test their cellular and molecular function. Interestingly, the most replicative cells are often considered as cellular sources of malignancy. In this case, those cells are not putative basal stem cells, but are most likely transit-amplifying parabasal progenitors. We note, for example, that in the case of leukemia, although mutations can arise in stem cells, the leukemogenic action of many oncogenes and tumor suppressors occurs at the level of transit-amplifying progenitors. Indeed, in a murine model, Leydon et. al demonstrated BrdU label-retaining cells that turn over slowly are largely quiescent stem/cell progenitors,28 whereas parabasal cells are rapidly replicating, which suggests that they act as transit-amplifying progenitor cells. However, determining which cell is the true cell of origin of laryngeal cancer requires some form of lineage tracing, or a computational reconstruction of the clonal evolution of cells within a cancer based on single-cell genomic or transcriptional data.29 That said, our newly presented molecular architecture offers a preliminary method for characterizing the cells types and their geometric aberrations in disorders of the laryngeal epithelium ranging from metaplasia to premalignancy to frank laryngeal cancer."
