CHARACTERISTICS OF EPITHELIAL TISSUE • Epithelium consists of tightly packed cells- very cellular with little intercellular space 20um • Usually avascular- They lack a blood supply, instead they receive nutrients by diffusion from capillaries in ct • Epithelium readily divide, so they are continually replaced = rapid healing- high capability to regenerate 5/28/2019 5\n\n6. • Cells rest on basement membrane • Cells shows polarity • Cells may display surface modification • Supplied by nerves • Secretory portion of glands and cells lining the ducts are epithelial in nature (glands are epithelial in origin)5/28/2019 6\n\n7. FUNCTIONS • Protection - skin , body cavities • Absorption – kidney, intestine • Secretion – gastric, intestinal glands • Exchange – renal tubules • Barrier- skin, urinary bladder • Excretion – nephron of kidney • Combine with nervous tissue- special organs 5/28/2019 7\n\n8. CLASSIFICATION 1. Simple (squamous / cuboidal / columnar) 2. Stratified (St. squamous / St. cuboidal / St. columnar) 3. Pseudostratified 4.

SIMPLE COLUMNAR• Location: stomach & large intestine, Brush border- gall bladder, ciliated columnar epithelium-respiratory tract, uterus, central canal of spinal cord, ventricles of brain • Function: secretion, absorption Goblet cells 5/28/2019 17\n\n18. STRATIFIED EPITHELIUM STRATIFIED SQUAMOUS (NON-KERATINIZED) • Many layers • Basal layer- cuboidal/round, intermediate- polyhedral, superficial layer- flattened • Location- lining oral cavity, tongue, part of epiglottis, oesophagus , vagina • Function- protection of STRATIFIED SQUAMOUS (KERATINIZED) • Dead, dehydrated, non- nucleated like scales • Location- skin • Function- protection, prevents absorption of water, prevents dehydration of underlying tissues 5/28/2019 18\n\n19. KERATINIZED STRATIFIED SQUAMOUS EPITHELIUM OF EPIDERMIS NON KERATINIZED STRATIFIED SQUAMOUS EPITHELIUM 5/28/2019 19\n\n21. STRATIFIED CUBOIDAL • Many layers • Ducts of sweat glands • Provides passage to the secretion and act as a barrier STRATIFIED COLUMNAR • Many layers • Epithelium lining large ducts of glands • Fornix of conjunctiva, urethra • Provides passage to the secretion and acts as barrier 5/28/2019 21\n\n22. PSEUDOSTRATIFIED EPITHELIUM • Not a true stratified epithelium • Appears to be stratified • All cells are attached to the basement membrane but are of different heights • hence not all reach the apical surface • Nuclei at different levels • Ciliated/non-ciliated , goblet cells 5/28/2019 22\n\n23. Location : • Non- ciliated – auditory tube, ductus deferens, male urethra • Ciliated –trachea & large bronchi • Pseu stra col epi with sterocilia- epididymis Function: • Tall columnary- Secretory • Short, basal cells are stem cells- replace tall cells • Cilia help in clearance of mucous • Stereocilia help in absorption 5/28/2019 23\n\n24. • Pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium lining the human trachea 5/28/2019 24\n\n27. TRANSITIONAL EPITHELIUM • Mutilayered 4-6 cells thick • Differs from stratified squamous epithelium , surface cells are not squamous • Deepest cells- columnar/ cuboidal • Middle layer-polyhedral/pear-shaped • Surface layer- umbrella shaped • Can be stretched without losing heir integrity- becomes thinner and flattened 5/28/2019 27\n\n28. • Location : Renal pelvis, calyces, ureter, urinary bladder, part of urethra Urothelium • Function : The presence of occluding junctions and intramembranous plaques forms an effective barrier, prevents absorption of toxic substances of urine Distention 5/28/2019 28\n\n30. BASEMENT MEMBRANE • thin supporting layer placed between basal surface of epithelium and under line connective tissue • Epithelium cells rest on the basement membrane • Under EM – appears by layers , basal lamina and reticular lamina Functions: provides adhesion on one side to epithelial cells , other side connective tissue , • Act as barrier of diffusion • Influence regeneration of peripheral nerves 5/28/2019 30\n\n31.

Microvilli b. Stereocilia c. Cilia 5/28/2019 32\n\n33. Cilia : • Hair like projections • Free part of the each cilia- shaft • Region of attachment of shaft to cell- base • Outer covering- extension of cell membrane, inner core- microtubules • Functions : wave-like movements on the surface of tracheal and bronchial epithelium help to move the mucous in one direction , movement of ova in oviduct • 5/28/2019 33\n\n34. Micro villi: • Fine vertical striations / finger like projections • Closely packed • 1-2 um , 75-90 um • Plasma membrane/ cytoplasmic core/ microfilaments/ actin filaments • Brush border • Function : non-motile process, increase the surface area, active absorption • Location : intestine, proximal convoluted tubule of kidney5/28/2019 34\n\n35. Stereocilia: • Long cytoplasmic process, 5-10um • Non motile • Increase SA • Location :lining epithelium of epididymis, sensory cells of ear 5/28/2019 35\n\n37. • Glands – specialized secretory cells • Epithelial in origin • Unicellular or multicellular • Exocrine glands : epithelial layer invaginates in deeper tissue to form a diverticulum. The proximal end of this forms duct while distal end forms secretory units. These type of glands remain in contact with surface epithelium by the duct and pour their secretions on its surface5/28/2019 37\n\n38. • Endocrine glands: some glands lose contact with the epithelial surface. They pour their secretions directly in the blood. (internally secreting glands/ duct less glands) • Paracrine : similar to endocrine, but secretion diffuses directly into target cells eg : bronchus 5/28/2019 38\n\n39. EXOCRINE GLANDS Classification Branching ducts • Simple gland – unbranched eg: gastric , sweat glands • Compound gland – branched eg: parotid gland Shape of the secretory unit • Tubular- tubular shape eg; gastric glands • Acinar- oval shape eg; salivary glands • Alveolar- flask shaped eg: sebaceous glands • Saccular – sac shaped eg: mammary glands 5/28/2019 39\n\n40. Nature of secretion : • Mucous • Serous • Mixed 5/28/2019 40"
