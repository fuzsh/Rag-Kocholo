        "text": "Epithelia are formed of cells that line the cavities in the body and also cover flat surfaces. Of the four major tissue types found in the human body (Figure 1), epithelial cells are by far the most prolific.\n\nThe diversity of epithelial cells makes for an interesting field of study. Our lab is dedicated to studying various aspects of rat alveolar type II (L2) lung under a variety of conditions in order to answer specific research questions. The following provides a general overview of of the six types of epithelial cells, how structure relates to function, and why research in this field is important and relevant.\n\nEpithelial cells are bound together in sheets of tissue called epithelia. These sheets are held together through several types of interactions, including tight junctions, adherens, desmosomes, and gap junctions (Figure 2).One type of junction found only in epithelium is the tight junction, which is considered by most scientists as the closest junction in the world. Tight junctions act as the delineation between the apical (upper) and basal (lower) regions of an epithelial cell in conjunction with polarization between the two regions. Epithelium is supported on the basal side by a basement membrane called the basal lamina. Below the basal lamina lies the capillary bed, which provides epithelia with required nutrients and disposal of waste products. In addition, the nucleus in the epithelial cell is usually found closer to the basal surface than the apical surface.\n\nEpithelial cells cover the inner and outer linings of body cavities, such as the stomach and the urinary tract (Figure 3). As the barrier between the outside worldâs contaminants and the body, these cells replicate often to replace damaged or dead cells. Many layers provide better protection, meaning if one layer is lost, the underlying tissue is still protected. Tight junctions, are very difficult to alter or break and create a semi-permeable seal that few macromolecules or microbes can penetrate.\n\nSome epithelial cells, such as the ones found on the intestinal lining, aid in the transportation of filtered material through the use active-transport systems located on the apical side of their plasma membranes. For example, the glucose-Na+ symports located within certain domains of the plasma membrane of epithelial cells lining the intestine enable the cells to generate Na+ concentration gradients across their plasma membranes, which provides the energy needed to uptake glucose, from the lumen of the intestine. The glucose is then released into the underlying connective tissues and is transported into the blood supply through facilitated diffusion down its concentration gradient (Figure 5).\n\nThe ability of certain epithelial cells to use active-transport systems, as discussed above, enables them to absorb filtered material, such as glucose from the lumen of the intestine, which can then be circulated to the rest of the body. Cells are also able to endocytose other materials that are necessary for cell growth and signaling. For more information, see transcytosis.\n\nSome epithelial cells, such as the goblet cells, secrete fluids that are necessary for other processes such as digestion, protection, excretion of waste products, lubrication, reproduction, and the regulation of metabolic processes of the body. As part of its excretory role, certain epithelial cells secrete mucus, which lubricate the body cavities (i.e. peritoneum, pericardium, pleura, and tunica vaginalis) and passageways that they line. In the trachea, goblet epithelial cells secrete mucous which provides the lubrication to aid ciliated epithelial cells in sweeping bacteria and dust away from the lungs (Figure 6). In addition, type II alveolar cells excrete pulmonary surfactant, which decreases surface tension, allowing for normal lung function. Figure 6 shows an example of secretory cells in the fallopian tubes."
