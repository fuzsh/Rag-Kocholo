        "text": "Location of Epithelium\n\nFunctions of Epithelium\n\nHistology of Epithelium\n\nClassification of Epithelium\n\nEpithelial Modifications\n\nGlands\n\nEpitheliod Tissue\n\nLocation of Epithelium\n\nEpithelum is found throughout the body. Epithelium covers body surfaces, lines body cavities, and lines hollow organs.\n\nTop of Page\n\nFunctions of Epithelium\n\nProtection, absorption, secretion, excretion, filtration, and diffusion are all functions of epithelium.\n\nHistology of Epithelium\n\nWhen looking at the histology of epithelium, it can be seen that the cells in epithelial tissue are tightly packed. There is very little intercellular space between the cells in epithelial tissue.\n\nSince epithelium forms surface coverings and linings, there is one free surface that is not in contact with other cells. On the other side of the free surface, there is a basement membrane. The basement membrane is non-cellular. It is composed of carbohydrates and proteins which are secreted by the epithelial cells and connective tissue cells.\n\nHistology hint from Sarah Bellham: The \"free surface\" on epithelum can be used as an aid in idenfying epithelium on a histology slide.\n\nTop of Page\n\nClassification of Epithelium\n\nEpithelium is classified by the shape of the cells and the number of cell layers.\n\nEpithelial cells may be flat, cuboidal, or columnar. If the cells are flat, the epithelium is classified as squamous. If the cells are as tall as they are wide, it is called cuboidal. If the cells are taller than they are wide, the epithelium is classified as columnar.\n\nEpithelial cells may be arranged in a single layer or stacked upon one another in a multiple layers. Epithelium that is one cell thick is classified as simple. Epithelium that is more than one cell layer thick is classified as stratified.\n\nHistology of Simple Squamous Epithelium\n\nSimple squamous epithelium is a single layer of flat cells.\n\nSimple squamous epithelium is \"simple\" because it is one cell thick. \"Squamous\" refers to the fact that the cells are flat.\n\nEndothelium is a type of simple squamous epithelium which lines blood vessels. Mesothelium is a type of simple squamous epithelium which lines the body cavities.\n\nHistology of Simple Cuboidal Epithelium\n\nSimple cuboidal epithelium has cells which are as tall as they are deep and wide. Simple cuboidal epithelium is \"simple\" because it is one cell thick. \"Cuboidal\" refers to the shape of the cells.\n\nThe lining of most ducts is simple cuboidal epithelium. The kidney tubules are simple cuboidal epithelium.\n\nHistology of Simple Columnar Epithelium\n\nIn simple columnar epithelium, the height of the cell is greater than the width and depth of the cell. Simple columnar epithelium is \"simple\" because it is one cell thick. \"Columnar\" cells are taller than they are wide and have an oval nucleus.\n\nThe lining of the gastrointestinal tract is simple columnar epithelium. Goblet cells are associated with simple columnar epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nThe mucosa of the gallbladder is made of simple columnar epithelium.\n\nHistology hint from Sarah Bellham: the simple columnar epithelium of the gallbladder is very tall!\n\nHistology of Stratified Squamous Epithelium\n\nStratified squamous epithelium is \"stratified\" because it is more than one cell layer thick. \"Squamous\" refers to the fact that the surface cells of the stratified squamous layer are flat.\n\nHistology hint from Sarah Bellham: In stratified squamous epithelium, the cells at the basal layer are cuboidal or even columnar. However, the epithelium is still classified as \"squamous\" based on the cells of the surface layer.\n\nThe epidermis of the skin is stratified squamous epithelium. The lining of the esophagus is stratified squamous epithelium. The cornea is covered by a non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium.\n\nHistology of Pseudostratified Columnar Epithelium\n\nPseudostratified columnar epithelium is a single layer of cells which looks like it is stratified. Pseudostratified squamous epithelium is \"pseudostratified\" because it is only one cell layer thick, yet it appears to be stratified. In reality, every cell touches the basement membrane.\n\nHistology hint from Sarah Bellham: The prefix \"pseudo\" is of Greek origin and it means false or counterfeit. For example: pseudonym, pseudo-science or pseudostratified.\n\nPseudostratified columnar epithelium lines the trachea and respiratory tract as well as some of the male reproductive tract.\n\nHistology of Transitional Epithelium\n\nTransitional epithelium has domed shape cells on the apical surface. It can be distended or stretched.\n\nTransitional epithelium is found in the bladder and urinary tract.\n\nTop of Page\n\nEpithelial Modifications\n\nKeratinization\n\nKeratinization is seen in the epidermis. Cells in the stratum corneum are essentially just bags of keratin.\n\nMicrovilli\n\nMicrovilli are finger like projections seen on the surface of some cells. Microvilli form the brush border (striated border).\n\nStereocilia\n\nStereocilia are very long microvilli. Stereocilia are seen in the epididymis and the hair cells of the ear.\n\nCilia\n\nCilia is the hair like surface modification seen on some epithelia. Cilia are made of microtubules.\n\nTop of Page\n\nGlands\n\nA simple gland has an unbranched duct. A compound gland has a branched duct.\n\nIf the secretory portion of a gland is shaped like a tube, it is called \"tubular\". If the secretory portion of a gland is shaped like a flask, it is called \"alveolar\" or \"acinar\". If the secretory portion of a gland is shape like a tube but at the end it is shaped like a flask, it is called \"tubuloalveolar\".\n\nTop of Page\n\nEpitheliod Tissue\n\nIf a tissue is composed of tightly packed epithelial-like cells, but it does not have a free surface, the tissue is called epithelioid tissue. An example of epithelioid tissue is the parenchyma of the adrenal gland.\n\nTop of Page\n\nSources:\n\nHistology: A Text and Atlas\n\nMichael H. Ross/Edward J. Reith"
