        "text": "squamous\n\n(adjective)\n\nFlattened and scale-like.\n\nExamples of squamous in the following topics:\n\nSkin Cancer\n\nThe three main types of skin cancer are basal cell carcinoma (the most common of all cancers), squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma.\n\nSquamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is commonly a red, scaling, thickened patch on sun-exposed skin.\n\nThe mortality rate of basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma is around 0.3%, causing two thousand deaths per year in the U.S.\n\nCranial Bones\n\nThe temporal consist of four regions the squamous, mastoid, petrous and tympanic regions.\n\nThe squamous region is the largest and most superior region.\n\nInferior to the squamous is the mastoid region, fused between the squamous and mastoid regions is the petrous.\n\nThe frontal bone forms the front of the skull and is divided into three parts the squamous, orbital and nasal parts.\n\nThe squamous part is large and flat and forms the main region of the forehead, the orbital part lies inferiorly and forms the superior border of the orbit.\n\nTypes of Epithelial Tissue\n\nFor example, simple squamous epithelial tissue describes a single layer of cells that are flat and scale-like in shape.\n\nThe four major classes of simple epithelium are: 1) simple squamous; 2) simple cuboidal; 3) simple columnar; and 4) pseudostratified.\n\nSimple squamous epithelium cells are flat in shape and arranged in a single layer.\n\nStratified epithelia can be columnar, cuboidal, or squamous type.\n\nSquamous epithelium has cells that are wider than they are tall.\n\nCervical Cancer\n\nMost cervical cancers are squamous cell carcinomas, arising in the squamous (flattened) epithelial cells that line the cervix.\n\nThis large squamous carcinoma (bottom of picture) has obliterated the cervix and invaded the lower uterine segment.\n\nGlomerular Filtration\n\nThe Bowman's capsule (also called the glomerular capsule) surrounds the glomerulus and is composed of visceral (simple squamous epithelial cells) (inner) and parietal (simple squamous epithelial cells) (outer) layers.\n\nVenules\n\nVenule walls have three layers: an inner endothelium composed of squamous endothelial cells that act as a membrane, a middle layer of muscle and elastic tissue, and an outer layer of fibrous connective tissue.\n\nTonsils\n\nFor example, the adenoids and tubal tonsils are covered with the ciliated psuedostratified columnar epithelium of the nasopharynx, while the palatine and lingual tonsils are made up of the non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium of the oropharynx.\n\nSquamous cell carcinomas (epithelial tumor) and lymphomas (lymphocyte tumor) can also develop in the tonsillar tissue, and removal is a very important treatment.\n\nEpithelial Membranes\n\nMost mucous membranes contain stratified squamous or simple columnar epithelial tissue.\n\nLung Cancer\n\nThere are three main sub-types: squamous cell lung carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma.\n\nAccounting for 25% of lung cancers, squamous cell lung carcinoma usually starts near a central bronchus.\n\nWell-differentiated squamous cell lung cancers often grow more slowly than other cancer types.\n\nPharynx\n\nThe nasopharynx contains psuedo-stratified squamous cell epithelia tissue that is ciliated (covered in tiny hairs that move mucus).\n\nThe oropharynx is lined by non-keratinized squamous stratified epithelium, which is thicker than the epithelium found in other parts of the respiratory tract in order to prevent damage from food, but not as thick as skin as it lacks keratin.\n\nThe laryngopharynx naturally continues into the esophagus tissue and is made up of a similar type of stratified squamous epithelium tissue."
