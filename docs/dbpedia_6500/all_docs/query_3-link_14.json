The terms, keywords, and images used on this page may not be suitable for some users, but they are regular terms for the human system and organs used only for educational purposes as a part of study information.\n\nThe stratified squamous epithelium consists of several layers of cells, where the cells in the apical layer and several layers present deep to it are squamous, but the cells in deeper layers vary from cuboidal to columnar.\n\nAs the most important difference between the simple epithelium and the stratified epithelium is the number of the layer of cells, the functions of these layers also differ in the same respect whereas the structure is more or less similar. As a result of the continual cell division in the lower (basal) layers, the cells in the superficial layers are pushed towards the surface, where they are shed.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nToggle\n\nInteresting Science Videos\n\nStructure of the stratified squamous epithelium\n\nThe stratified squamous epithelium has two or more layers of cells. The cells in the apical layer and several layers deep to it are squamous while the cells in deeper layers vary from cuboidal to columnar.\n\nIn the stratified squamous epithelium, only one layer is directly attached to the basement membrane, and the rest of the layers are connected to one another to maintain the structural integrity.\n\nAs basal cells divide, daughter cells arising from cell divisions push older cells upward toward the apical surface.\n\nThe cells in the epithelium are attached firmly with very few intracellular spaces.\n\nUnlike in simple epithelium, in the stratified epithelium, only the outermost layer of the tissue is exposed towards the lumen at the apical surface. All the other sides of the cells are attached to other cells through cell junctions and adhesions.\n\nThese cells have many desmosomes and other adhesins and become more irregular in shape and then flatten as they move towards the surface.\n\nAs they move toward the surface and away from blood supply in underlying connective tissue, they become dehydrated and less metabolically active.\n\nTough proteins predominate as cytoplasm is reduced, and cells become sturdy, hard structures that eventually die.\n\nAt the apical layer, after dead cells lose cell junctions, they are sloughed off, but they are continuously replaced as new cells emerge from basal cells.\n\nJust like all other epithelial tissue, the stratified squamous epithelium also doesn’t have a direct blood supply but has a distinct nerve supply.\n\nBased on the accumulation of keratin by the cells towards the surface, the stratified squamous epithelium is of two types:\n\n1. Keratinized stratified squamous epithelium\n\nKeratinized stratified squamous epithelium is a type of stratified squamous epithelium in which the cells have a tough layer of keratin in the apical segment of cells and several layers deep to it.\n\nKeratin is a tough, fibrous intracellular protein that helps protect skin and underlying tissues from heat, microbes, and chemicals.\n\nAs the cells move upwards, they accumulate keratin in the process of keratinization, where they become thin, metabolically inactive pockets (squames) of keratin lacking nuclei.\n\nThe relative amount of keratin increases in cells as they move away from the nutritive blood supply and the organelles eventually die.\n\nAs a result of the keratinization, the cells on the top layer loses all its function and is only involved in providing protection against dehydration and other mechanical stress.\n\n2. Non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium\n\nNon-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium is the epithelium in which the cells do not have a lot of keratin deposits within them, but rather are moisturized by mucus from the salivary or the mucus glands.\n\nIn this case, the flattened cells of the surface layer retain their nuclei and most metabolic functions.\n\nBecause non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium doesn’t have as much keratin deposits, this epithelium is usually found in areas that need to be kept hydrated or are affected by dryness.\n\nThis epithelium does have some amount of keratin which, in turn, depends on the age of the layer of the tissue and the mechanical wear and tear it has been subjected to.\n\nSome cells of this epithelium might even produce trace amounts of mucus and other lubricating agents to keep the surface from drying out.\n\nFunctions of the stratified squamous epithelium\n\nThe most important and crucial function of stratified squamous epithelium is protection.\n\n1. Protection\n\nThe stratified squamous epithelium provides protection against mechanical stress, chemical abrasions, and even radiation.\n\nThe keratinized epithelium present on the surface of the skin blocks out the harmful radiation and prevents the exposure of internal tissues and organs to the radiation.\n\nSimilarly, it also prevents water loss due to heat and damage to the internal organs by any physical distress.\n\nWhen damaged, this epithelium replaces the outermost layer, which also aids the effectiveness against any stress or invasion.\n\nThe non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium prevents the entry of foreign invaders as the surface is kept consistently moist.\n\nBoth the types of the stratified squamous epithelium act as the first line of defense against microbial invasion or any physical harm.\n\n2. Secretion\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the non keratinized stratified squamous epithelium consists of cells that produce some amount of mucus to keep the surface moist.\n\nThe mucus also helps to balance the pH of the surrounding, as in the case of the vaginal epithelium.\n\nIn addition, it also acts as a lubricating agent in a region frequently subjected to friction like the buccal cavity.\n\nLocation and Examples of Stratified squamous epithelium\n\nThe keratinized epithelium lines the region exposed to the external environment and continuously subjected to stress like the superficial layer of the skin.\n\nIt also forms the epidermis of the palm of the hand and the sole of the foot.\n\nThe non keratinized epithelium forms the lining of the internal surfaces and cavities, which commonly endure friction and physical wear and tear.\n\nIn the digestive system, the stratified squamous epithelium lines the surface of the tongue, the hard upper palate of the mouth, the esophagus, and the anus.\n\nSimilarly, it is also found in the female reproductive parts like the vagina, cervix, and the labia majora.\n\nThe upper respiratory tract that might come in contact with food is also lined with stratified epithelium.\n\nThe stratified epithelium covers the cornea of the eye in order to protect the delicate tissues present in the eye.\n\nThe epidermis of the urethra in the urinary system is also made up of stratified squamous epithelium.\n\nReferences and Sources\n\nMescher AL (2016).
