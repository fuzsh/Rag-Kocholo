        "text": "Every cell in our body is specialised to perform a certain function. Similar kinds of cells constitute a tissue, which is classified based on the structure and functions performed by them. The human body has four main types of tissue; epithelial, connective, neural and muscular.\n\nTable of Contents:\n\nWhat Is Epithelial Tissue?\n\nEpithelial tissue or epithelium forms the outer covering of the skin and also lines the body cavity. It forms the lining of respiratory, digestive, reproductive and excretory tracts. They perform various functions such as absorption, protection, sensation and secretion.\n\nStructure of Epithelial Tissue\n\nEpithelial tissue is formed from a tightly fitted continuous layer of cells. One surface of the epithelial tissue is exposed to either the external environment or the body fluid. The other surface is attached to tissue by a membrane, which consists of fibres and polysaccharides secreted by epithelial cells.\n\nThere is little intercellular material present between cells. There are specialised junctions present between the cells of the epithelium that link individual cells.\n\nTight junctions- prevent leakage across tissues\n\nAdhering junctions- keep the neighbouring tissues well cemented together\n\nGap junctions- facilitate the movement of ions and molecules across the tissue\n\nEpithelial cells form membranes. The epithelial membrane consists of a layer of epithelial tissue and has underlying connective tissue. There are two types of epithelial membranes, mucous membrane and serous membrane.\n\nMucous membrane: It is also known as mucosa. There are goblet cells present, which secrete mucus. The mucus helps in lubrication, protection and easy movement of materials. It prevents tissues from drying. It lines the body cavities such as respiratory and digestive tracts, which open outside the body.\n\nSerous membrane: The serous membrane lines the body cavities, which do not open outside the body, such as the lining of the pleural cavity, pericardial membranes. These membranes secrete the fluid inside the cavity and are made up of simple squamous epithelium.\n\nGlands are made up of epithelial cells. There are two types of glands, exocrine and endocrine. Exocrine glands secrete their product into a duct, e.g. goblet cells, sweat glands. Endocrine glands are called ductless glands and they release their product directly into the blood or intestinal fluid, e.g. hormones.\n\nRecommended Video:\n\nEpithelial Tissue Functions\n\nProtection: As it covers the entire body surface, it is the first line of defence against any kind of mechanical injury, chemical exposure, excessive fluid loss and infections. Ciliary projections present in the nose or upper respiratory tract, trap the dust particles and prevent it from entering the body\n\nAbsorption: The epithelial lining of the digestive tract absorbs water and nutrients\n\nExchange of substances: Epithelial tissue regulates the exchange of substances between body and external environment as well as the internal exchange between different parts of the body. Everything that enters the body or enters the bloodstream by absorption has to cross the epithelial barrier\n\nSensation: Sensory receptors are present in the epithelial tissue of the nose, eyes and ears, taste bud, etc. that help in transmitting signals from the external stimuli to the brain\n\nSecretion: Various glands made up of epithelial cells secrete hormones, enzymes, saliva, mucus, sweat, etc.\n\nExplore:\n\nTypes of Epithelial Tissue\n\nThere are three types of epithelial cells, which differ in their shape and function.\n\nSquamous Epithelium – They are thin and flat cells\n\nCuboidal Epithelium – They are short cylindrical cells, which appear hexagonal in cross-section\n\nColumnar Epithelium – They are long or column-like cylindrical cells, which have nucleus present at the base.\n\nAlso check:\n\nSquamous Mucosa\n\nRange of Epithelial Cells\n\nOn the basis of the number of layers present, epithelial tissue is divided into the simple epithelium and stratified or compound epithelium\n\nSimple Epithelium- it is composed of one layer of a cell and mostly has a secretory or an absorptive function\n\nCompound (Stratified) Epithelium- it is made up of two or more than two layers of cells and mostly has a protective function.\n\nThe glandular epithelium is made up of cuboidal or columnar cells. They are specialised for secretion.\n\nUnicellular- isolated glandular cells, e.g. goblet cells\n\nMulticellular- a cluster of cells, e.g. salivary glands\n\nThe columnar or cuboidal epithelium may bear cilia and are referred to as ciliated epithelium. They help in the movement of mucus in a specified direction, e.g. fallopian tubes and bronchioles.\n\nTypes of Epithelial Tissue Location Structure Function Simple squamous Blood vessel lining, air sac lining of lungs A single layer of flat cells having irregular boundaries Transport by diffusion and where minimal protection is required Simple Cuboidal Epithelium The tubular lining of kidneys, glandular ducts A single layer of short cylindrical cells. It may have microvilli as in proximal convoluted tubules Absorption and secretion Simple Columnar Epithelium Digestive tract and upper respiratory tract lining A single layer of columnar cells (tall and slender) and often ciliated Protection, absorption, mucus secretion and movement in a specific direction Stratified Squamous Epithelium The lining of the mouth and vagina Made up of several layers of cells, continuously sloughed off and regenerated. The older layer of cells is pushed upwards and becomes flat. The lower layer is columnar and metabolically active Protection Stratified Cuboidal Mammary glands, sweat gland and salivary glands The upper layer is cuboid and other layers may be cuboidal or other types Protection of ducts of various glands Stratified Columnar Male urethra and lobar ducts of salivary glands There is a layer of columnar cells present on squamous, columnar or cuboidal epithelial cells Protection and secretion Pseudostratified Columnar Respiratory passage and ducts of many glands Similar to columnar epithelium but all the cells are not of similar height Protection, secretion and movement of mucous Transitional epithelia or urothelium Urinary bladder, urethra, ureter Stratified epithelium, which can contract or expand as per the requirement. Cells are cuboidal when not stretched, but when the organ stretches, then tissue gets compressed and cells appear irregular and squamous-shaped Stretch readily to accommodate the different volume of liquids\n\nAct as a barrier and have tight junctions to prevent reabsorption of toxic substances\n\nKeratinised The outer or apical layer of the cell Mostly dead and devoid of nucleus and cytoplasm. The cytoplasm gets replaced by keratin, which makes the layer waterproof Protection against abrasion\n\nImportant Concepts of Biology for NEET Neural Communication Tetany Causes What is Cretinism?
