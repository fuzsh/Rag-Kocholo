It is composed of an inner endometrium which supports the placenta during pregnancy. The glandular endometrium undergoes monthly cycles in response to endocrine influence. It undergoes proliferation and then a secretory phase when it is capable of supporting a fertilized ovum. It is subsequently shed during menstruation. The endometrial here is proliferative. If you look carefully you can see mitotic figures in the endometrial glands. Note the regular spacing and orderly array of the endometrial glands.

His blood pressure was 160/110. He was treated with diuretics (Lasix), but he continued to gain weight. Two days after the onset of the chest pain he had a cardiac arrest and died.\n\nImage Gallery:\n\n(Summary of Gross Findings - click here)\n\nThe heart was slightly enlarged weighing 460gms. There was severe atherosclerosis of all the major coronary arteries with a recent thrombotic occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery. A recent transmural infarct was present in the left ventricle that involved the interventricular septum and the papillary muscle.\n\n(Summary of Microscopic Findings - click here)\n\nThe slide includes a transmural section of the left ventricle. Nearly the entire section is involved by infarct. However, there is a thin rim (5 to 10 cell layers) of endocardial myocytes which have survived because of diffusion of oxygen and nutrients from the ventricular cavity. Other viable myocytes can be found around larger blood vessels within the section. The intense hypereosinophilia of the necrotic myocytes can best be appreciated by comparing the thin rim of lighter staining subendocardial myocytes with the deeper cells. Note also the karyolysis that is characteristic of coagulation necrosis. In some areas there is little inflammatory response. This observation is explained by microvascular necrosis which does not allow access of circulating leukocytes to these areas. In other areas, especially in the epicardial half of the infarct, there is an intense acute inflammatory response. Many intact neutrophils can be seen. In addition, there are many nuclear fragments from lysed neutrophils. Macrophage activity is not evident. These features of the inflammatory response indicate that the infarct was approximately three to four days old. Note also that the inflammation extends to the epicardial surface and that there are deposits of fibrin on the epicardium. This is called fibrinous pericarditis. The granular grey material seen within some blood vessels is barium sulfate, which was injected to permit post-mortem study of the coronaries by radiography.\n\n(Review Normal Histology - click here)\n\nNorm No. 13 Heart\n\n[ImageScope] [WebScope]\n\nNormal heart tissue sections demonstrate no evidence of fibrosis or hemorrhage.

A small amount of urine obtained on the first day after taking the pills was positive for occult blood. Despite vomiting, treatment with chelating agents, fluids, and colonic irrigations she became anuric and died 10 days later.\n\nImage Gallery:\n\n(Summary of Gross Findings - click here)\n\nThe kidneys were both slightly enlarged but grossly normal.\n\n(Summary of Microscopic Findings - click here)\n\nThe tubular damage here is so severe that it is hard to identify the segment involved. However, it may be noted that most of the necrosis is in the cortex, whereas the collecting tubules in the medulla, although their lumina contain many casts, are lined by relatively intact cells. HgCl2 presumably damages mainly proximal convoluted tubules because it is concentrated in this segment. Many involved tubules show marked coagulative necrosis, with sloughing of cells into the lumen. Some tubules that look more nearly normal actually have already have undergone marked necrosis and all that is left is a layer of flattened basilar cells which serve to regenerate the tubule. Regenerative changes can be recognized, including occasional mitoses in epithelial cells. The basement membrane around a few necrotic tubules is broken, and the interstitial tissue contains collections of inflammatory cells and edema fluid.\n\n(Review Normal Histology - click here)\n\nNorm No. 2 Kidney\n\n[ImageScope] [WebScope]\n\nThe kidney excretes soluble waste from the body and controls electrolyte balance. It consists of the cortex and the medulla. Within the outer cortex, glomeruli with delicate capillary loops are seen. The basement membrane is thin and without inflammation or thickening.

The septal capillaries are engorged with blood. An incidental finding consists of anthracotic pigment near the pleural space.\n\n(Review Normal Histology - click here)\n\nNorm No. 24 Lung\n\n[ImageScope] [WebScope]\n\nThe primary function of the lung is gas exchange. Therefore, alveoli have thin walls lined by thin flat pneumocytes and endothelial cells. There is no thickening or fibrosis of the interstitium. The bronchioli are lined with basally oriented ciliated columnar epithelium. The bronchi are lined by similar epithelium. There are mucous glands within the submucosa. The bronchial smooth muscle is not hypertrophied. The pulmonary vessels are patent with no evidence of intimal thickening or muscular hyperplasia.\n\nWhat is the MOST LIKELY diagnosis?\n\nANSWER\n\n40-1. Causes of pulmonary edema include:\n\nLeft heart failure\n\nTricuspid stenosis\n\nRight heart failure\n\nPulmonary thromboembolism\n\nNONE of the above\n\nANSWER\n\n40-2. With regard to edema formation,\n\nankle swelling is a sign of left heart failure\n\nsacral edema is a sign of right heart failure\n\npulmonary edema is a sign of right heart failure\n\nperiorbital edema is a sign of left heart failure\n\nANSWER\n\nCASE NUMBER 85\n\n[ImageScope] [WebScope]\n\nClinical History: This 64-year-old white female was morbidly obese.\n\nImage Gallery:\n\n(Summary of Gross Findings - click here)\n\nThe liver weighed 1980 grams. It had a pale, greasy appearance.\n\n(Summary of Microscopic Findings - click here)\n\nThe areas of fatty change are readily visible with use of scanning power. They are zonal. Note the peri-portal areas are severely involved and the areas of fatty change extend from one portal area to another. The more severely involved cells have eccentric nuclei and the entire cytoplasm is replaced by a fat globule.\n\n(Review Normal Histology - click here)\n\nNorm No. 3 Liver\n\n[ImageScope] [WebScope]\n\nThe liver is the organ that metabolizes nutrients received from the digestive tract. These nutrients and processed by tissue hepatocytes which are large polygonal cells. The hepatocyes are separated by portal triads. The triads consist of an artery, a vein and a bile duct. The bile duct is lined by cuboidal epithelium. The artery has a muscular wall and a flat endothelial lining. The sinuses are well defined and contain a small amount of blood.\n\n85-1. What is the MOST LIKELY diagnosis?\n\nMetastatic carcinoma\n\nCirrhosis\n\nFatty liver\n\nIntrahepatic bile stasis\n\nANSWER\n\n85-2. What of the following is the LEAST likely to cause this condition?\n\nExcessive alcohol consumption\n\nMalnutrition\n\nCatabolic state from cancer\n\nChronic right heart failure\n\nANSWER\n\n85-3. If a thin CEO were to develop this disease, you would MOST LIKELY suspect:\n\nExcessive alcohol consumption\n\nMalnutrition\n\nCatabolic state from cancer\n\nChronic right heart failure\n\nANSWER\n\nCASE NUMBER 93\n\n[ImageScope] [WebScope]\n\nClinical History:A 50-year-old female had recurrent bouts of severe abdominal pain accompanied by elevated serum amylase. After one of these episodes, she developed refractory shock, peritonitis and expired.\n\nImage Gallery:\n\n(Summary of Gross Findings - click here)\n\nFibrosis obscured some areas of pancreas architecture. Saponification of peripancreatic fat was seen in small foci.\n\n(Summary of Microscopic Findings - click here)\n\nSeveral areas of fat necrosis with adjacent neutrophil infiltrate are seen, evidence of acute pancreatitis. In addition, some lobules of the pancreas show fibrosis and loss acini, evidence of chronic pancreatitis. In these areas, islets of Langerhans appear larger and more abundant. This is partly because they are resistant to injury and persist when acini are destroyed and partly because they undergo reactive hyperplasia.\n\n(Review Normal Histology - click here)\n\nNorm No. 7 Pancreas\n\n[ImageScope] [WebScope]\n\nThe pancreas is comprised of glandular tissue with endocrine and exocrine function. The exocrine pancreas contains lobular arrays of acini. The acinar secretions of the exocrine pancreas are collected by the pancreatic ducts. The ducts are surrounded by a small amount of connective tissue without inflammation or fibrosis (scarring).The endocrine pancreas resides in the islets which are regularly arranged and present within the pancreatic lobules.\n\nWhat is the MOST LIKELY diagnosis?\n\nANSWER\n\nCASE NUMBER 143\n\n[ImageScope] [WebScope]\n\nClinical History: This 21-year-old woman desired breast enhancement. Silicone implants were placed. One of the implants ruptured causing severe inflammation and had to be removed.\n\nImage Gallery\n\n(Summary of Gross Findings - click here)\n\nThe cyst cavity that that surrounded the implant in the body and an example of a commonly used silicone breast implant is shown. The intact implant causes a proliferation of connective tissue that surrounds it. If the implant ruptures or leaks, the silicone causes a foreign body reaction.\n\n(Summary of Microscopic Findings - click here)\n\nThe irregular fragments of foreign material are surrounded or engulfed by multinucleated foreign body giant cells. The rest of the section is made up of fibrous connective tissue and collections of lymphocytes and histiocytes (macrophages).\n\n(Review Normal Histology - click here)\n\nNorm No. 19 Female breast\n\n[ImageScope] [WebScope]\n\nThe female breast is a secretory organ that produces milk during lactation. Breast tissue that is not stimulated to lactate consists of resting apocrine cells arranged in nests and small ductules which are lined by cuboidal epithelium. The secretory units are separated from one another by loose connective tissue.\n\nWhat is the MOST LIKELY diagnosis?\n\nANSWER\n\n143-1. What type of inflammation is this?\n\nAcute inflammation\n\nChronic inflammation\n\nGranulomatous inflammation\n\nAllergic inflammation\n\nThis not an infection, therefore this is not inflammation\n\nANSWER\n\nReview Items\n\nCELL INJURY\n\nKey Vocabulary Terms\n\nanthracosis hemosiderosis ischemia aplasia heterophagy karyolysis apoptosis homeostasis karyorrhexis atrophy hyaline lipofuscin autolysis hydropic change melanin autophagy hyperplasia metaplasia bilirubin hypertrophy necrosis dysplasia hypoplasia neoplasia gangrene hypoxia pyknosis heat-shock protein infarct steatosis hemosiderin\n\nCELL INJURY LEARNING OBJECTIVES\n\nAbsolutely critical information you must know to practice medicine is in bold font.\n\nImportant information that will be needed for routine patient care is in regular font.\n\nInformation about less common diseases that you may encounter in clinical practice and that will probably appear on examinations is in italics."
