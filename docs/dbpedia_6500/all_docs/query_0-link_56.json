        "text": "Epithelial tissue is the body's first line of defense, covering surfaces and lining organs. It's tightly packed, regenerates quickly, and performs crucial functions like protection, absorption, and secretion. Understanding its features is key to grasping how our bodies maintain barriers and regulate exchanges.\n\nSimple and stratified epithelia have distinct structures and roles. Simple epithelia, with a single cell layer, handle diffusion and filtration. Stratified epithelia, with multiple layers, provide protection. Specialized junctions between cells ensure tissue integrity and allow communication.\n\nEpithelial Tissue\n\nFeatures of epithelial tissue\n\nCovers body surfaces, lines hollow organs and body cavities, and forms glands\n\nAlways has one free () surface exposed to the outside or lumen of an organ\n\nLacks blood vessels but innervated in some regions\n\nTightly packed with little intercellular material\n\nRegenerates quickly when damaged due to high mitotic activity\n\nFunctions:\n\nProtects from abrasion, dehydration, and pathogen invasion\n\nAbsorbs substances (nutrients, gases)\n\nSecretes substances (mucus, enzymes, hormones)\n\nFilters to regulate exchange between compartments (blood and interstitial fluid)\n\nSenses stimuli in some locations (taste buds, olfactory epithelium)\n\nSimple vs stratified epithelia\n\nSimple epithelia consist of a single layer of cells\n\nhas thin, flat cells involved in diffusion and filtration (capillary walls, pericardium, pleura)\n\nhas cube-shaped cells involved in secretion and absorption (small ducts, kidney tubules)\n\nhas tall, rectangular cells involved in secretion and absorption (stomach and intestinal lining)\n\nSome have microvilli (brush border) to increase surface area for absorption\n\nSome are specialized for mucus secretion (goblet cells in respiratory and digestive tracts)\n\nPseudostratified epithelium appears layered but all cells contact the (respiratory tract)\n\nStratified epithelia consist of multiple layers of cells\n\nStratified squamous epithelium has flattened top layers that protect against abrasion and water loss\n\nKeratinized type has dead surface cells filled with keratin for waterproofing (epidermis of skin)\n\nNon-keratinized type has living, moist surface cells (esophageal and vaginal lining)\n\nStratified cuboidal and columnar epithelia are rare, found in some glands and ducts (large ducts of salivary glands, male urethra)\n\ncan stretch and change shape (urinary bladder)\n\nJunctions in epithelial tissue\n\nTight junctions (zonula occludens) are sealing junctions that prevent leakage between cells\n\nComposed of transmembrane proteins that fuse membranes of adjacent cells\n\nRegulate paracellular transport and maintain cell polarity\n\nAnchoring junctions mechanically attach cells to each other or the basement membrane\n\nDesmosomes (macula adherens) are spot-like junctions that link intermediate filaments and provide tensile strength\n\nAdherens junctions (zonula adherens) are belt-like junctions that link actin filaments and allow coordinated cell movement\n\nHemidesmosomes attach basal cells to the basement membrane\n\nGap junctions (nexus) are channels that allow direct communication between cells\n\nComposed of connexin proteins that form tunnels between cells\n\nPermit passage of ions, nutrients, and signaling molecules to coordinate cellular activities and maintain homeostasis\n\nEpithelial tissue organization and interactions\n\nBasement membrane separates epithelium from underlying connective tissue\n\nProvides structural support and attachment for epithelial cells\n\nRegulates molecular exchange between epithelium and connective tissue\n\nCell adhesion molecules maintain epithelial integrity and organization\n\nCadherins mediate cell-cell adhesion in adherens junctions and desmosomes\n\nIntegrins connect cells to extracellular matrix components in the basement membrane\n\nEpithelial-mesenchymal transition allows epithelial cells to acquire mesenchymal properties\n\nImportant in embryonic development, wound healing, and cancer metastasis\n\nEndocrine vs exocrine glands"
