        "text": "A couple of months ago, in this blog, there was a post about the 100 greatest novels, and how many of them had been read by the average reader. In order to improve my score, I said I would read Song of Solomon, by Toni Morrison. I’m very glad I volunteered: it’s a wonderful novel.\n\nToni Morrison\n\nWikipedia says this about Toni Morrison: “(born Chloe Ardelia Wofford; February 18, 1931) is an American novelist, editor, teacher, and Professor Emeritus at Princeton University. Morrison won the Pulitzer Prize and the American Book Award in 1988 for Beloved. The novel was adapted into a film of the same name (starring Oprah Winfrey and Danny Glover) in 1998. Morrison was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1993. In 1996, the National Endowment for the Humanities selected her for the Jefferson Lecture, the U.S. federal government’s highest honor for achievement in the humanities. She was honored with the 1996 National Book Foundation’s Medal of Distinguished Contribution to American Letters. Morrison wrote the libretto for a new opera, Margaret Garner, first performed in 2005. On May 29, 2012, President Barack Obama presented Morrison with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In 2016 she received the PEN/Saul Bellow Award for Achievement in American Fiction.”\n\nThe paragraph in Wikipedia on the early years in Toni Morrison’s life helps me understand her great facility as a black writer: “Morrison’s parents instilled in her a sense of heritage and language through telling traditional African American folktales and ghost stories and singing songs.” Song of Solomon is full of children’s songs, traditional folktales, ghosts, and – in today’s terms – unthinkable racism. All the principle characters have names one would never think of: Milkman, Guitar, Pilate, First Corinthians, Hagar and eccentric, engaging personalities. The novel is set in a small, poor black community in Michigan, beginning in the 1930’s; it progresses through Pennsylvania into Virginia, but always in black territory. It is the story of the development of Milkman against the background of a family whose origins are slaves and Native Americans, and whose strange history make them what they are. There are numerous tensions within the family with various historic causes; and external tensions of being well off vs having nothing; sexual tensions; and tensions arising from differing circumstances and values. Milkman’s development as a person is facilitated by his dissatisfaction with his comfortable, but pointless situation, and by his search for identity in the personalities of his fore bearers. He must learn, figuratively and mythologically, to fly.\n\nFor me, Song of Solomon was the best kind of reading experience. One learns, or perhaps in my case re-learns, the savage history of racism in America, set against a background of ‘real’ people who are flawed but nonetheless our friends. One admires their unique coping skills: songs, love, stories and tradition. One is carried from one set of circumstances, expecting the outcome, to a new, more interesting situation. The author’s inventiveness is breath-taking, and enjoyable. The writing is voluble or terse as the situation demands, and the language is appropriately unique but always descriptive. Most of all, I admire Toni Morrison as a great story-teller.\n\nThere was an article in the June 2 issue of The Daily Telegraph regarding a study by the National Literacy Trust which found that black and Asian children enjoy reading more than white children.\n\nAccording to the NLT, 25% of white children involved in the survey of 42,406 pupils aged eight to eighteen said that they enjoyed reading ‘very much’. This is compared to 27.8% of black respondents and 28.2% of Asian children.\n\nAt the other end of the scale 9% of white children said that they liked books ‘not at all’, compared with 6.7% of black children and 5.3% of Asian children.\n\nThe annual survey also showed that the number of primary school children who enjoy reading a book has reached record levels. Nearly 78% of youngsters aged eight to eleven said they enjoy reading while 55.4% of pupils aged eleven to fourteen also enjoy doing so.\n\nHowever, the study shows a continuing gender gap with boys less likely to enjoy reading than girls.\n\nJonathan Douglas, of the Literacy Trust, said: “When children enjoy reading and have books of their own, they do better at school and later in life, so we must do everything we can to inspire children to fall in love with reading for a lifetime.”\n\nI certainly agree with Mr Douglas: motivating children to read is very important to the development of a child, but also becomes a lifelong pleasure that can be passed on to their children.\n\nFor me the statistics of black and Asian vs. white children are not sufficiently significantly different to be a cause of concern. What is worrying for me is the apparent decline in reading for enjoyment among older children. I can accept that older children have busier lives and perhaps less time to read for enjoyment, but I would hope that their enjoyment of reading does not lessen.\n\nThe article in the Telegraph did not publish statistics on the ‘gender gap’, but I’m not surprised that there is one. Unfortunately, for many boys, reading is not enough of an ‘action activity’.\n\nA friend was telling me about a book she was having trouble reading and enjoying. She (a well-educated woman) said the “writing is over the top; I have to stop now and then to look up word. Why can’t authors simplify their writing? Why do they have to make it so complicated?” He husband added, “There seems to be a trend for authors to try to position themselves above their readers, and to win the admiration of critics.” I agreed with both points, and I said that, “It seems to me that writers who are aiming for big prizes use extraordinary language to express themselves: not only in vocabulary, but in sentence structure, grammar and imagery. Prose is becoming poetry for the benefit of the critics.”\n\nAs evidence of this trend, there are three passages below. The first is from Salman Rushdie’s The Satanic Verses. The second is how I think I would have tried to write the same passage, and the third is in ordinary English.\n\nSalman Rushdie\n\nSalman Rushdie\n\nAfter the news of his death in the plane crash reached her, she had tormented herself by inventing him: by speculating, that is to say, about her lost lover. He had been the first man she had slept with in more than five years: no small figure in her life. She had turned away from her sexuality, her instincts having warned her that to do otherwise might be to be absorbed by it; that it was for her, would always be, a big subject, a whole dark continent to map and she wasn’t prepared to go that way, be that explorer, chart those shores: not any more, or, maybe, not yet. But she’d never shaken off the feeling of being damaged by her ignorance of love, of what it might be like to be wholly possessed by that archetypal, capitalised jinn, the yearning towards, the blurring of the boundaries of the self, the unbuttoning, until you were open from your adam’s apple to your crotch: just words, because she didn’t know the thing. Suppose he had come to me, she dreamed. I could have learned him, step by step, climbed him to the very summit. Denied mountains by my weak-boned feet, I’d have looked for the mountain in him: establishing base camp, sussing out routes, negotiating ice-falls, crevasses, overhangs. I’d have assaulted the peak and seen the angels dance. O, but he’s dead and at the bottom of the sea.\n\nWilliam Peace\n\nWhen she learned of his death in the plane crash, she agonised over day dreams of her perished lover. As the first man she had slept with in over five years, he represented a kind of icon. In his absence, she had repressed her sexuality out of a fear that to live and examine it would somehow frighten and diminish her. Her ignorance of the bright spectrum of love, was a source of insecurity, and sometimes she longed to know the feeling – whatever it was – of merging one’s consciousness with that of a lover. But, if her lover had been there she would have eschewed any leap into the heavens of love; rather she would establish a safe and slow process to advance into the heights until, in her glory, she saw the angels dance. But, alas, her lover lay at the bottom of the sea, dead.\n\nPlain English\n\nEver since the news of his death reached her, she thought of him, the first man – remarkably – she had slept with in five years. She set aside her interest in sex out of fear of stepping into the unknown. Nonetheless, her ignorance of love bothered her, and she wondered what it would be like to experience true and selfless love. If her lover had been present, she would not have thrown herself into an unlimited relationship; she would have approached the situation gradually, learning and advancing slowly so that eventually she would have found true bliss. But, of course, her lover was dead.\n\nI’m not, by any means, suggesting that my text is in any way better that Rushdie’s. I rather like his use of off-the-wall phrases like ‘archetypal, capitalised jinn’, but I would never think of it; and I like some of his images, which border on the poetic. However, one has to be pretty well educated to read Rushdie. So who is he writing for? Critics and academics, or Mrs Smith, book reader?"
