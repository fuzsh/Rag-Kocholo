        "text": "Between 2005 - 2015, the Man Booker International Prize recognised one writer for their achievement in fiction.\n\nWorth £60,000, the prize was awarded every two years to a living author who had published fiction either originally in English or whose work is generally available in translation in the English language.\n\nThe winner was chosen solely at the discretion of the judging panel and there were no submissions from publishers.\n\nThe Man Booker International Prize was different from the annual Man Booker Prize for Fiction in that it highlighted one writer’s overall contribution to fiction on the world stage. In focusing on overall literary excellence, the judges considered a writer’s body of work rather than a single novel."
