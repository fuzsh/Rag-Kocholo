        "text": "Quebec-born writer and Nobel laureate Saul Bellow has died at age 89.\n\nBellow was born in Lachine, and brought up in Montreal. When he was nine, his family moved from Montreal to Chicago.\n\nBellow's close friend and lawyer, Walter Pozen, said the writer had been in declining health, but was \"wonderfully sharp to the end.\"\n\nBellow was the most acclaimed of a generation of Jewish writers who emerged after the Second World War. Among them were Bernard Malamud, Philip Roth and Cynthia Ozick.\n\nA master of comic melancholy, he both celebrated and mourned the soul's fate in the modern world in novels such as Herzog and Humboldt's Gift.\n\n\"The backbone of 20th-century American literature has been provided by two novelists Â— William Faulkner and Saul Bellow,\" Philip Roth said Tuesday. \"Together they are the Melville, Hawthorne, and Twain of the 20th century.\"\n\nBellow was the first writer to win the National Book Award three times, for The Adventures of Augie March, published in 1954, for Herzog, in 1965, and for Mr. Sammler's Planet in 1971.\n\nIn 1976, he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Humboldt's Gift, and took the Nobel Prize in literature. The Nobel jury cited him for his \"human understanding and subtle analysis of contemporary culture.\"\n\nHe kept writing well into his eighties. The Actual, a sentimental novella, was published in 1997 and Ravelstein, a novel based on the life of his late friend, Allan Bloom, was published in 2000.\n\nJames Atlas wrote an acclaimed biography of Bellow, whose personal life was colourful and often messy.\n\nHe had five wives, three sons and, at age 84, a daughter. He feuded with writers, including Truman Capote and Norman Mailer, and helped out others, notably William Kennedy, lobbying to get his work published.\n\nAtlas accused Bellow of favouring \"subservient women in order to serve his own shaky self-image.\"\n\nThe son of Russian immigrants, he was born Solomon Bellows on July 10, 1915. He dropped the final \"s\" from his last name and changed his first name to Saul when he began publishing in the 1940s.\n\nHebrew was Bellow's first language. His family life was marked by his father's violence, and the sentimentality and humour of both parents. Both of these characteristics emerged in his writing.\n\nThe classic Bellow narrator was a self-absorbed intellectual with ideals formed during the Depression. Bellow said he remembered the fear of those times but also found them an exciting and even liberating time.\n\nAfter teaching for many years at the University of Chicago, Bellow left the city in 1993 for a position at Boston University, where he taught a freshman-level class on \"young men on the make\" in literature.\n\nHe died at his home in Brookline, Mass., in the company of his wife and daughter."
