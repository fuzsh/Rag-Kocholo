A mid-career award went to Nilo Cruz, whose works include Anna in the Tropics, Beauty of the Father, Lorca in a Green Dress and A Park in Our House.\n\nThe Phyllis Naylor Working Writer Fellowship ($5,000) to Carol Lynch Williams, author of the forthcoming A Glimpse Is All I Can Stand.\n\nThe PEN Translation Prize ($3,000) to Natasha Wimmer for her translation from the Spanish of Roberto Bolano's 2666.\n\nThe PEN Award for Poetry in Translation ($3,000) to Marilyn Hacker for her translation from the French of King of a Hundred Horsemen by Marie Ã‰tienne.\n\nPEN also recognizes excellence in short fiction with the O.
