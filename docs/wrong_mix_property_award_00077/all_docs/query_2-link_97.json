        "text": "Biography of Saul Bellow\n\nSaul Bellow was born on June 10, 1915, in Lachine, Quebec, Canada. He lived with his parents who had immigrated to Canada from St. Petersburg. He had one older sister and two older brothers. Bellow was often sick as a child, struggling with respiratory problems. Bellow moved with his family to Chicago when he was 9 years old. Chicago would later greatly influence many of the settings in his novels.\n\nBellow's family was religious, but Bellow found it suffocating. However, he did enjoy reading the Torah, a Jewish religious text. It was during this period that he began to write. Bellow was influenced by Russian literature, Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852), and Shakespeare.\n\nWhile attending the University of Chicago and later Northwestern University, Bellows studied anthropology and sociology after he felt unwelcome by the literature department due to his religion. However, Bellow's anthropological background helped inform many of his later works. Bellow began working at the Works Progress Administration Chicago Branch in the 1930s and became involved with the Trotskyists.\n\nThe Works Progress Administration (WPA) was a program devised by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935 to help with employment and infrastructure during the Great Depression—a time of high unemployment, poverty, and hunger.\n\nTrotskyism was a branch of Marxism, a political ideology and party, that supported the revolutionary Leon Trotsky who was against Capitalism and the exploitation of workers. He believed in a permanent revolution against capitalism in support of socialism. Bellow met Leon Trotsky on a trip to Mexico.\n\nAfter becoming a naturalized citizen in 1941, Bellow joined the Merchant Marines during the Second World War. It was during this time he completed his first novel inspired by the war draft called Dangling Man (1944). After the war, while teaching at the University of Minnesota, Bellows wrote another novel The Victim (1947). After receiving a Guggenheim fellowship in 1948, Bellows went to Paris and wrote The Adventures of Augie March (1953) which solidified his position as a recognized author. He returned to Minnesota in 1958.\n\nIn 1961, he moved to Rio Piedra, Puerto Rico to teach at the University of Puerto Rico. By 1962, he was back in Chicago to teach at the University of Chicago. He taught on the Committee on Social Thought alongside his close friend Allan Bloom, an American philosopher and classicist. In 1964, Bellow wrote his first bestseller, Herzog (1964) which was focused on mental instability in a college professor. Mental instability would become a central theme in many of his novels.\n\nIn 1976, Bellow won the Nobel Prize in literature for his novel Humboldt's Gift (1976). Bellow also was selected for the Jefferson Lecture, the highest honor for achievement in the humanities granted by the United States. Between 1981 and 1982, Bellows was the Writer-in-Residence at the University of Victoria. In 1993, Bellow moved to Boston to co-teach at Boston University. He lived there until he died in 2005 at the age of 89.\n\nQuotes by Saul Bellow\n\nBelow are a few quotes from the works of Saul Bellow:\n\nIn an age of madness, to expect to be untouched by madness is a form of madness. But the pursuit of sanity can be a form of madness, too\" (Henderson the Rain King, Chapter 3).\n\nBellow wrote frequently on the mental state of modern humans. According to this quote from Bellows's 1959 novel, Henderson the Rain King, all humans are slightly mad but it is how we deal with the madness that truly impacts one's life path.\n\nAssociate with the noblest people you can find; read the best books; live with the mighty, but learn to be happy alone\" (Ravelstein, p. 140).\n\nIn Saul Bellow's final novel Ravelstein (2000), he reflects on a common theme found in his work. All humans are greatly influenced by external factors such as people, education, environment, etc. but it is up to the individual to realize their self-worth and potential.\n\nA great deal of intelligence can be invested in ignorance when the need for illusion is deep\" (To Jerusalem and Back, p. 100).\n\nIn Jerusalem and Back (1976), Bellow explains that in the face of denying a truth, humans tend to focus greatly on ignoring problems and uncomfortable feelings. This causes intelligent people to become ignorant rather than face reality.\n\nSaul Bellow - Key takeaways\n\nSaul Bellows was born in Canada in 1915, but he spent the majority of his life in Chicago. Throughout his life, he taught in and traveled to many countries.\n\nHe wrote his first novel A Dangling Man while serving as a Merchant Marine during World War 2.\n\nHe is most famous for his novels The Adventures of Augie March, Herzog, and Humboldt's Gift which awarded him a Nobel Prize for literature in 1976.\n\nSaul Bellows wrote many short stories, nonfiction pieces, plays, and novellas along with his many books.\n\nHe focused on themes that explored the potential hero and how humans achieve greatness in the face of obstacles. He also explored the nature of mental instability in modern man."
