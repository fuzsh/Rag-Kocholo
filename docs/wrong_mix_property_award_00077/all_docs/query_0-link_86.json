        "text": "Winner of the Pulitzer Prize Picador is producing a beautiful new hardback edition of a book that is viewed by many as the most extraordinarily written book of the last ten years, and whose author is consistently touted to win the Nobel Prize. Publication will follow the release of what will be a hugely acclaimed film starring Viggo Mortensen (Lord of the Rings) and Academy Award winner Charlize Theron. A father and his son walk alone through burned America, heading through the ravaged landscape to the coast. This is the profoundly moving story of their journey. 'An American classic which, at a stroke, makes McCarthy a contender for the Nobel Prize for Literature ...An absolutely wonderful book that people will be reading for generations' Andrew O'Hagan 'So good that it will devour you, in parts. It is incandescent' Niall Griffiths, Daily Telegraph 'You will read on, absolutely convinced, thrilled, mesmerised. All the modern novel can do is done here' Alan Warner, Guardian"
