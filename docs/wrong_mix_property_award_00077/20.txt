Saul Bellow

Saul Bellow was awarded a National Book Award for the novel The Adventures of Augie March in 1954, winning again for Herzog in 1965 and for Mr. Sammler’s Planet in 1971. He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1976. In a 1996 letter to Martin Amis, he observed that “losing a parent is something like driving through a plate-glass window. You didn’t know it was there until it shattered, and then for years to come you’re picking up the pieces—down to the last glassy splinter.”
