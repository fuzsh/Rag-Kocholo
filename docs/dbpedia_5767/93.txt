Winehouse studied musical theatre at the school in 2001 for one year before leaving to focus on writing her first album “Frank”.

The 27-year-old’s teacher Adrian Packer said Winehouse would “live long in our memories”.

He said: “Amy was fun to teach. She was robust and forthright in her manner, had an inquisitive mind and a creative spirit.

“Her artistry was intuitive and her passion for jazz music infectious.”

Mr Packer said Winehouse was popular with other students and particularly enjoyed acting classes.

He recalled when the Grammy-winning singer returned to sing at the school in 2008.

He said: “Her charisma was overwhelming.

“Although she was experiencing some well documented problems in her personal life, she was able to conjure a performance of great composure and maturity.

“At the height of her success, Amy brought a formidable swagger to the stage which will live long in our memories.”

The beehive-sporting star has been credited with inspiring many other Brit school students who have gone onto to stardom, including Jessie J and Adele.

Mr Packer added: “In Amy’s application to the BRIT School, she envisaged a future for herself which was “bright”.

“We were proud to see Amy’s aspiration to come to fruition and are now saddened that her terrific talent has come to an abrupt and regrettably early end.

“We offer our condolences to her family and fondly acknowledge her contribution to our School.”

Winehouse was found dead in her house in Camden, north London, on Saturday at about 4pm.

A post-mortem examination has yet to take place to determine a cause of death.

Winehouse shot to worldwide fame with her second album Back to Black but had a well-documented problem with drugs and alcohol.
