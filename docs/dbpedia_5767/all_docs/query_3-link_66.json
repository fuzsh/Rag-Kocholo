        "text": "BPMI Live is proud to have worked with the following artists during the 2021–2022 academic year:\n\nCHARLEY\n\nCHARLEY brings back the spirit of the 1970s through her unique style and rock-country-disco sound, which falls somewhere in between Amy Winehouse and Led Zeppelin. Her music features powerful vocal melodies and meaningful lyrics reflecting on her personal experiences. With every song she writes and every stage she stands on, she seeks to create an environment where her audience can freely be their unique selves. Her personal mantra is: “to forget yourself is to free yourself is to find yourself.”\n\nGrowing up in New Haven, Connecticut, CHARLEY found her passion for the performing arts at the age of 6 in the theater. As a child, she auditioned for many off- and on-Broadway productions and booked roles including Helen Keller (The Miracle Worker) and Elle (Legally Blonde). Her powerful voice led her to win several regional singing competitions, perform at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, New York, and take the stage as one of Berklee’s top vocalists.\n\nCHARLEY can usually be found dressed as a disco-cowgirl diva, singing at venues across Boston and New England.\n\nAmong the Stars\n\nBlending elements of metal and prog rock, Among the Stars creates cosmic, heavy music. Founded by guitarist Matt Baker in 2017, the band recently added powerhouse vocalist Thalia Tymowski to a lineup that includes James O’Connor, Tanner Lively, and Nick Thorpe. The band's latest release, Gravitational Collapse, showcases challenging riffs, complex rhythms, and thought-provoking ideas. Their upcoming material features Tymowski's dynamic vocals, adding a new layer to the band's imaginative sound and performance style.\n\nAiida\n\nAiida is a pop/R&B artist and singer-songwriter from Oslo, Norway, inspired by Aretha Franklin, Dagny, Robyn, and Dua Lipa. With a powerhouse voice and performances filled with energetic arrangements, Aiida knows how to rev up a crowd and leave them wanting more. Her single “Talk (About What?),” released last June, has received airplay on Norwegian radio and several Spotify placements.\n\nG Luné\n\nG Luné, a Colombian-American indie-pop artist, creates her own world through a multitude of sounds deriving from her deep musical background and varying influences like Remi Wolf, Spill Tab, and Amy Winehouse.\n\nA former junior Olympian and accomplished athlete, G Luné shifted her focus from athletics to music in her high school years. After studying classical and jazz in West Palm Beach, Florida, G Luné developed a playful world of sound and color while furthering her education at Berklee. Her active lifestyle is represented through her lively and energetic stage presence. She strives to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for her audience to truly be themselves and have fun. She combines heartfelt, powerful lyrics with high-energy production and a colorful brand. Her fan-favorite single, “BLOCKED,” was written to give power back to all victims of abusive relationships.\n\nG Luné’s music can be found on all streaming platforms and has been featured on official Apple Music and Spotify playlists. When she’s not in the studio recording her upcoming EP, SHUT UP AND LISTEN, she can be found playing in clubs across Boston and New York.\n\nMatilda Marigolds\n\nMatilda Marigolds has been called New York City's number one cowgirl, with a refreshing yet nostalgic sound that falls in the space between Phoebe Bridgers and Fiona Apple, with a sprinkle of Maren Morris. She first fell in love with music as a young child, falling asleep in the back of bars or backstage at her father's performances. As the daughter of a New York City–based drummer, it was almost inevitable that Matilda would soon start to forge her own musical path. She is a self-taught multi-instrumentalist (piano, bass, guitar, and drums), producer, and engineer. Prior to releasing her debut EP, Union (2021), Matilda was invited to perform on RWQuarantunes, sharing a virtual stage with Charlie Puth and Rick Astley. She’s also shared the stage with the pop-rock band Laundry Day.\n\nMatilda’s music attracts listeners with her vulnerable storytelling and raw vocal delivery. When asked who she creates music for, she said, “I started creating music as a therapeutic endeavor, one that was rooted in my own self-care. I want my music to heal others as it has healed me. But more specifically, I want it to foster a productive and growth-oriented inner-dialogue within my listeners that initiates a new kind of personal understanding and healing.” When she's not in the studio or performing, Matilda enjoys giving hugs, eating twice her weight in strawberries, falling in love, and DJing. She is currently working on her sophomore album, which she looks forward to releasing in 2022. Her music can be found on all streaming platforms.\n\nBrandon Harris\n\nHailing from Chicago, soul-inspired pop/R&B artist Brandon Harris found his voice in the church at age 10 and has been writing music ever since. Meshing intricate vocal layering with dreamy synths and classic hip-hop beats, his debut album, SALT, has a song for every mood. Influenced by Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Beyoncé, and Frank Ocean, he combines old-school R&B and modern pop while showcasing his immense vocal talent.\n\nA dynamic performer and skilled instrumentalist and arranger, Harris has shared the stage with acclaimed keyboardist Greg Phillinganes (Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Toto) and toured the world with the award-winning a cappella group Upper Structure as soloist and music director. Under his leadership as music director, Upper Structure placed first at the Los Angeles A Cappella Festival. The recent Berklee graduate recently dropped a new EP, TWENTYONE, and a deluxe edition of Salt, both of which are available on all streaming platforms."
