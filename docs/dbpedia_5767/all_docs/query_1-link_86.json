Because Winehouse is facing legal woes in the UK stemming from recent charges she allegedly attacked a fan last fall in London, getting the songstress to the States would be no easy feat: \"Being charged with a crime often makes it difficult for people to get U.S. visas.\" She faced similar trouble last year when her visa request to attend the Grammys was declined, then reversed too late for her to make the event. Winehouse was scheduled to headline the second of three nights of the annual fest in Indio, along with The Killers, Thievery Corporation, and TV on the Radio in a day boasting another nearly three dozen musical acts. Coachella's reaction is succinct: \"Yes it's true. Amy Winehouse has canceled her appearance at Coachella.\""
