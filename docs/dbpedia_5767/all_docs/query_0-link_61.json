        "text": "This is a brilliant song – and is also a great example of how knowing the back story and every detail being available online can really harm your appreciation of music. I first heard this, sight unseen, and assumed it was some incredible new band that had somehow acquired, by osmosis, the spirit of The Specials/Fun Boy Three with a bit of that skronking Sax-led Jazz punk of Pere Ubu, The Cravats, Blurt and The Ex.\n\nI then find out yr Man King Krule went to the bloody Brit School. That’s the Pop Academy that churned out Adele, Jessie J, Leona Lewis, The Kooks, Felicity F, &=@@{}, Rainy Milo, Jungle Jones, Katie Melua, Tristram T, Josh Allen Key and all manner of tasteful Mercury Nominated/Guardian Friendly popstrels (some of whom I have made up) ..you know those people that get interviewed by Steve Lamacq about recording their new album on a barge, and experimenting with Gamelan?. That hissing sound you hear is my enthusiasm for this artist leaking away.\n\nWhen I were a lad, Rock stars went to the School of Hard Gigging, the University of taking bad drugs in a squat listening to The Stooges – or maybe they went Art School where they studiously avoided Art, and indeed school and formed a band. Whatever it was that the great musicians, singers and bands of the last 50 years had – they didn’t learn it at Stage School or Rock School. You can’t teach this stuff – and the people that shaped music over the last 50 years weren’t the types to sit down and be told how to do it. Anyway- hopefully King Krule can unlearn all he’s been taught at The Brit School as this is a mighty fine tune."
