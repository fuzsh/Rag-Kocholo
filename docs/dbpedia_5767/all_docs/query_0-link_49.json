        "text": "A new BRIT School for the next generation of rising stars in stage and screen is set to open in Bradford, West Yorkshire, the government has announced.\n\nThe new free school will be based on the award-winning performing arts BRIT School in south London.\n\nCollectively, alumni from the school have sold more than 250 million albums and won 15 BRIT Awards, with many more working behind the scenes in creative industries.\n\nThe Croydon-based educational establishment has helped launch the careers of some of Britain's best known artists and actors including Adele, Amy Winehouse, Tom Holland and Jessie J.\n\nSupported by industry leaders such as Sony Music Entertainment UK, Universal Music UK and Warner Music UK, the new free school will be open to more than 500 16-to-19-year-olds.\n\nThe lucky students will have the opportunity to study a specialised creative curriculum, including dance, music, theatre, and production arts.\n\nThe free-to-attend BRIT School North will form part of the BPI Education Academy Trust (BEAT), supported by the BRIT School, Day One Trust, and East London Arts and Music.\n\nThe school is projected to open in 2026/2027 with the final site yet to be decided but it will be in a central location in Bradford.\n\nEducation Secretary Gillian Keegan said: \"My home city of Liverpool is famously the home of the Beatles, Mersey Beat and many more stars. Whether on stage, on screen, or behind the scenes, the North is full of creative talent.\n\n\"This announcement will mean more young people will be able to reach their potential and follow in their footsteps, at the new BRIT School in the North.\n\n\"We are broadening opportunities so more of our children can access this springboard to success in the UK's growing creative industries.\"\n\nDr Jo Twist OBE, chief executive of the British Phonographic Industry, said: \"We are delighted with this decision, and it is a positive signal that government recognises the critical importance of creative and specialist creative arts education.\n\n\"This school will not only focus on producing our next generation of performers, but crucially, train young people with the important technical qualities needed for our industries to thrive and provide them with opportunities that they otherwise might not be able to access.\"\n\nCulture Secretary Lucy Frazer said: \"For more than 30 years, the BRIT School has been nurturing the next generation of creative talent - producing some of the most influential and successful performers and artists of our time.\n\n\"The new school in Bradford will give even more young people the opportunity to develop their skills and maximise their potential, while creating a pipeline of talent for our thriving creative industries.\""
