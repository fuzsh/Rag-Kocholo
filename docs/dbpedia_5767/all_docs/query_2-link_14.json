        "text": "Virgin Radio\n\n24 Oct 2018, 17:03\n\nBack to Black was the biggest selling album of 2007 worldwide selling over 5.5 million copies\n\nAmy Winehouse was a five-time Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter.\n\nThe album won both the Q Award and the MTV Europe Music Award for the 2007 Album of the Year.\n\nBack to Black was a huge success in the UK being the third biggest seller of the 2000s containing songs ‘Rehab’, ‘Back to Black’ and ‘Tears Dry On Their Own’.\n\nMost of the songs on the album were heavily inspired by the relationship and split with her on-off boyfriend Blake Fielder-Civil. Blake was the subject of many of her best tracks, \"I go back to things I maybe shouldn't,\" Amy said in 2004.\n\nWith such a successful career we take a look back at a beautiful icon…\n\nHer full name is Amy Jade Winehouse and she was born on 4 September 1983\n\nPhoto by YouTube\n\nShe grew up in the Southgate area of Enfield, Winehouse went to Southgate School and then Ashmole School.\n\nIn 1992 Amy began to attend Susi Earnshaw Theatre School where she was able to get a vocal education. At 14 she bought a guitar and began to write music.\n\n1. Photo by INS 2. Photo by Snopes\n\nAmy was then a pupil at the Sylvia Young theatre school in Central London.\n\nShe used to be in a rap duo called Sweet ‘n Sour – a Jewish version of Salt-N-Pepa – with her childhood best friend Juliette Ashby when she was 10\n\nPhoto by Consequence of Sound\n\nAmy Winehouse had 14 known tattoos, including 'Daddy's Girl' on her left arm for her father, and the name 'Cynthia' on her right arm in tribute of her Jewish grandmother.\n\nHer first job was as a celebrity reporter at World Entertainment.\n\nPhoto by Evening Standard\n\nBut Amy wasn’t interested in a career in music at this point - instead, she dreamed of being a roller-skating waitress like in 1973 coming of age film American Graffiti.\n\nShe then attended the Brit School alongside fellow singers Adele, Jessie J and Leona Lewis.\n\nAwards\n\n2004 - Best Contemporary Song for ‘Stronger than Me’\n\n2007 - Best Contemporary Song for ‘Rehab\n\n2008 - Best Musically and Lyrically for ‘Love Is a Losing Game’\n\nPhoto by Daily Express\n\nBack to Black led to five 2008 Grammy Awards, tying the then record for the most wins by a female artist in a single night, making her the first British woman to win five Grammys.\n\nIncluding three of the General Field “Big Four” Grammy Awards: Best New Artist, Record of the Year and Song of the Year.\n\nPhoto by Happy Mag\n\nCarole King’s wistful 1971 piano staple ‘So Far Away’ was Winehouse’s favourite song – so much so that her funeral service ended with friends and family singing the track in her honour.\n\nAmy had previously covered King’s ‘Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow’ but ‘So Far Away’ remained her favourite.\n\n“She was one of those magical people who burn more brightly than the rest of us,” wrote Mark Ronson after Amy’s death.\n\nPhoto by Empics\n\nPete Mitchell tells the Story of one of the most tragic singers of the 21st Century"
