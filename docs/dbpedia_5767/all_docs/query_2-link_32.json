        "text": "Amy Winehouse's father has revealed plans for a scholarship to attend the school where his daughter's musical ability was discovered.\n\nMitch Winehouse said the Amy Winehouse Foundation, which was started up after her death in 2011, will pay for a student to be taught at the Sylvia Young Theatre School.\n\n\"This is where her talent was recognised and nurtured.\n\n\"As most people would know, Amy was a pupil at Sylvia Young Theatre School.\"\n\nThe Back to Black singer died at the age of 27.\n\nA verdict of misadventure was recorded after the inquest heard the singer had 416mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood.\n\nMitch added: \"The Amy Winehouse Foundation would like to give a child, who otherwise couldn't afford the same opportunity, the chance to realise their talents.\"\n\nAmy attended the school in the mid-90s and was auditioned by the school's founder, Sylvia Young.\n\n\"We loved Amy,\" says Sylvia Young. \"We are thrilled and honoured that the Amy Winehouse Foundation is setting up this scholarship in her name to help a child who cannot afford the training to develop their talent.\n\n\"It would be wonderful to find another Amy, but there was only one Amy.\n\n\"We would be happy to find a singer, dancer or actor who has a special talent.\"\n\nSo far the foundation has donated money to a children's hospice in Essex.\n\nFoundation organisers also revealed plans to help people struggling with addictions."
