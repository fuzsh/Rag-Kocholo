        "text": "Mitch Winehouse looked out over an auditorium filled with Dreyfoos School of the Arts students and sighed.\n\n“Looking out at you is like looking at my kid,” said the father of Amy Winehouse, the celebrated British jazz/pop singer who briefly attended a performing arts school in London before leaving to start her career.\n\n“She was where you are 10, 15 years ago,” her father told students on Tuesday morning. .\n\nWinehouse was visiting the West Palm Beach high school to announce the Amy Winehouse Foundation he runs will make a donation to the Dreyfoos School of the Arts Foundation, the school’s fundraising arm.\n\n“We’d like to establish a permanent presence here at the Dreyfoos School,” he told students.\n\nHis daughter battled drug and alcohol addiction before dying of alcohol poisoning in 2011 at age 27. Her family established a foundation in her name which funds school substance abuse programs in the United Kingdom, as well as school music programs.\n\nThe Foundation’s U.S. branch donated $25,000 to the Brooklyn Conservatory of Music in 2013 and the New Orleans Youth Jazz Orchestra in 2012, according to its website.\n\nThe Winehouse family learned of the public performing and visual arts high school through Paul Rubin, a London friend whose parents have a home in Boca Raton. Rubin, himself an addict in recovery, has plans to open a rehab center in Palm Beach County to be called “The Amy Winehouse Project” but wouldn’t reveal details.\n\n“I haven’t signed a lease, yet, ” he said.\n\nMitch Winehouse sharply disagreed with his portrayal in “Amy,” a 2015 documentary about his daughter that’s been nominated for an Oscar.\n\nIn the film, he is depicted as a manipulative father who persuaded his daughter against entering rehab while using her fame to star in a TV show and start his own singing career. Amy is shown struggling with bulimia as well as addiction to heroin, crack cocaine and alcohol.\n\n“The film had an agenda to make Amy look lonely and miserable which she wasn’t and to vilify me,” said Winehouse. “The last three years of Amy’s life she was clean of drugs. She was on the path to sobriety (from alcohol), too.”\n\nExactly how much money will be donated to the Dreyfoos School and what the money will be used for is still being discussed, said Kris Lidinsky, executive director of the school’s foundation. She expects to use the donation to help students who can’t afford music lessons or the cost of traveling to competitions.\n\n“I do think they’re putting together something that’s very positive,” she said.\n\nRubin said the first check, will be cut from donations given during a free but private fundraiser Friday night underwritten by the Neiman Marcus store in Boca Raton."
