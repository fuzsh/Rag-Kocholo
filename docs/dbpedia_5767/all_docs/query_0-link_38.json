        "text": "There can't be many schools in the world that have as many famous former pupils as the BRIT School.\n\nIn the 25 years since it opened in 1991 the likes of Amy Winehouse, Adele and Jessie J have honed their talents in the Selhurst school's classrooms.\n\nOther notable students include members of the indie band The Kooks, singers Kate Nash, Leona Lewis and Katie Melua and actors Blake Harrison and Emily Head, who play Neil and Carly in sitcom The Inbetweeneers.\n\nThe school has even taught Spider-Man - as actor Tom Holland is also a former student.\n\nSo what is the school's secret? And what is a school day like for the 1,200 14 to 18-year-olds who study there, some of whom, given the school's track record, are almost certain to become household names in the years ahead?\n\nWe were invited along to the school, on The Crescent, to find out.\n\nIn plenty of schools pupils would expect to be told off for making too much noise in the corridors.\n\nBut here they are filled with the sound of students rehearsing scripts and perfecting songs.\n\nAlthough at times during our visit we came across students who seemed like they would fit perfectly into an episode of Glee, the pupils are clearly far more grounded. They also aren't afraid of hard graft - putting in hours and hours of extra practice before and after school.\n\nDuring our visit, two boys were singing on their way through the gates with one of them chastising the other for not singing in the right key. Aiming for that sort of perfection could make them stars.\n\nBut Stuart Worden, who has been the head teacher for four years, is keen on proving there is more to the BRIT School than fame-hungry singers.\n\nThe principal, who has a disco ball in his office, says that the school has high expectations of all its pupils and works tirelessly to ensure they leave the school \"industry ready\" whether they want to become a famous singer or work behind the scenes in the music or film industries.\n\nHe hopes that those pupils who do achieve their dreams won't ever let the fame and fortune go to their heads.\n\nHe said: \"People say, 'oh you know that Fame school from Croydon' … and, of course, a lot of our students have become famous but ultimately they are really grounded.\"\n\nThe school is free to attend, although Mr Worden admits that plenty of people assume you have to pay high fees for your children to go there.\n\nIt is funded like a normal comprehensive by the Government, although it does receive a grant from the BRIT Trust.\n\nFront of house manager Dan Clark emphasised that there is much more to the school than simply churning out famous singers.\n\nHe said: \"There is so much talent here and not just the singers. The students are not all the same and it does really upset me when the school is branded as one [particular] thing or a music factory.\"\n\nThe school offers courses alongside the usual GCSEs and A levels which include singing, dancing, technical theatre, games design and musical theatre.\n\nThere is also a special community arts practice course which has 25 pupils per year group and is designed for students who want to learn skills to help nurture the talent of people who have little access to performing arts.\n\nMr Worden added: \"A lot of people don't know we do that course and it is genuinely life-changing.\n\n\"They work in the Alzheimer's Society, they work with a disability dance group, with Age Concern and they also did a full sign language performance of David Bowie's Starman for hundreds of people who are hard of hearing.\"\n\nSupporting the local community is clearly important to the school, as pupils also put on literacy plays for toddlers, arrange secret cinema screenings for families, teach primary school pupils how to DJ and invite charities onto the school radio station, BRIT FM, to promote their causes.\n\nOriginally from Chichester, Mr Worden was introduced to the performing arts at a young age by his parents, who were both teachers, as they would take him to their local theatre.\n\nHe moved to Croydon 21 years ago to take up a position teaching musical theatre at the BRIT School.\n\nMr Worden says the school's recipe for success is its pupils \"being unique, being yourself, being grown up enough to take responsibility and not being held back by a lack of ambition\".\n\nHe also praised the staff who go \"above and beyond\" what is expected of most teachers and students who take on roles behind the scenes.\n\nHe said: \"The technical theatre students, they are so necessary. If you're an acting student and you don't have a lighting designer it doesn't matter if what you are doing is amazing, as you can't be seen.\"\n\nClare Stringer and Kunaal Shah, both 18 and from Croydon, are both pupils on the technical theatre course.\n\nWhen we visited, as part of their course they were setting up the stage for a music show.\n\nClare had designed the light displays and Kunaal was managing the event and the sound set-up.\n\nKunaal, who wants to be a sound engineer, said: \"The BRIT School students are successful because we work to a professional level which is recognised by the industry.\n\n\"They teach us the skills we need and the technical knowledge to get to the top. There is no intention to make everyone famous.\"\n\nClare, a former Norbury Manor Primary School pupil, added: \"I came here with the intention of doing costume design because I studied textiles at school, but I tried lighting and ended up doing a 360 to focus more on the technical set-up.\n\n\"The teachers push you to do well and help you to achieve things and if you have an idea you can ask Stuart. As long as it's not offensive he just says 'yes' to whatever he can.\"\n\nJasmine Rob, from Tottenham, is new to the school and is on the technical theatre course.\n\nShe specialises in costume design and admits she had preconceived ideas about the BRIT School.\n\n\"I thought that it was going to be elitist but it really isn't,\" she said.\n\nThe 16-year-old wants to design costumes for films and saw the new Star Wars film six times in order to get a costume of the character Rey perfect for a comic convention she was attending.\n\nShe added: \"There is a really warm atmosphere here and the teachers are very human.\"\n\nIt clearly come across how much the students enjoy studying at the school, which is reflected in the fact that about 15 per cent of the staff are former BRIT School pupils.\n\nAnd it is definitely much more than a music factory.\n\nPitch perfect\n\nFront of house manager Dan Clark was a musical theatre student at the school more than 15 years ago.\n\nThe 35-year-old has worked at the school for more than 10 years and said he would only leave if he was offered a role in a Star Wars film.\n\nHe said: \"There is a real buzz about the place that makes you want to get up in the morning. It gets to the point where I want to stay longer and get in earlier.\"\n\nOver the years, Mr Clark has got to know a lot of pupils, some of whom have gone on to reach dizzying levels of success.\n\n\"I used to have the greatest banter with Adele and Jessie J because we are all Tottenham supporters,\" he said.\n\n\"How can you be that famous and choose to support Tottenham?\"\n\nRooftop drama\n\nMr Clark has also seen his fair share of drama.\n\n\"We once did a live walk-through monologue piece with the acting students,\" he said.\n\n\"Some of them did their monologues from in the toilets or under the stairs, giving off the feeling of being trapped, that sort of thing.\n\n\"One boy decided he wanted to perform a piece from the point of view of a crash-landed parachutist, and relive how he had got there.\n\n\"So we harnessed him to the building with a parachute but no one had mentioned it to the neighbours so they rang the police and told them that someone had crash landed on top of the school!\""
