        "text": "We want every child to have access to a great education on their doorstep. That is why we are creating 15 new free schools in the most disadvantaged areas of the country, creating 12,000 additional school places for young people.\n\nBut what are free schools and how are they improving opportunities for young people? Here is everything you need to know.\n\nWhat is a free school?\n\nFree schools are funded by the government but are not run by the local authority. They are usually run by academy trusts, but they can also be run by universities, charities, businesses and faith groups. In fact anybody can apply to set up a free school if they have the necessary capacity and capability.\n\nFree schools are not-for-profit settings that are open to pupils of all abilities and have more freedom over things like the school curriculum and the length of the school day. They can also set teacher pay.\n\nHow are free schools improving access to quality education?\n\nThere are over 650 free schools in England with more than 350,000 pupils. They provide parents with more choice and offer high standards of education.\n\nSecondary free schools are among the highest performing state-funded schools in the country. Primary, secondary and 16-19 free schools all out-perform the national average in Good or Outstanding Ofsted ratings.\n\nIn this year’s A level results, free schools outperformed other types of non-selective state schools. Around 35 per cent of A levels taken by pupils in free schools achieved a grade A or A* compared to 22 per cent studied by pupils in local authority schools.\n\nThat is why we are opening 15 more free schools in areas with the lowest educational outcomes – creating more school places where there is the greatest need. This means more children will have access to a great education in their local area.\n\nWhere will the new free schools be?\n\nFree schools in this wave have been approved where there is the greatest need for good new places, prioritising parts of the country with lowest education outcomes.\n\nThe full list of new free schools that have been approved and are expected to open in three or four years include:\n\nEton Star, a 16-19 school in Dudley\n\nEton Star, a 16-19 school in Teesside\n\nEton Star, a 16-19 school in Oldham\n\nBRIT School North, a 16-19 school in Bradford\n\nGreat Stall East Academy, an all through school from ages four to 16 in Swindon\n\nLotmead Primary School in Swindon\n\nDixons Victoria Academy, a secondary school in Manchester\n\nDixons Wythenshawe Sixth Form, a 16-19 school in Manchester\n\nEden Girls' Leadership Academy, a secondary school in Liverpool\n\nBolsover Sixth Form, a 16-19 school in Derbyshire\n\nCabot Sixth Form, a 16-19 school in Bristol\n\nNew College Keighley, a 16-19 school in Bradford\n\nThorpe Park College, a 16-19 school in Leeds\n\nUTC Southampton\n\nDoncaster UTC - Health Sciences and Green Technologies\n\nWhat is a BRIT School?\n\nThe BRIT School North will create opportunities for rising stars in the north of the country to break into the performing arts industry. It is based on the award-winning performing arts school in South London which helped to launch the careers of Adele, Amy Winehouse and Jessie J."
