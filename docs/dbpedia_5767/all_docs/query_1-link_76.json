This special edition is a reflection of their ideas and creativity, featuring their chosen articles, images and social media content (keep an eye out on our TikTok for more!), all centred around the vibrant central London area loved by visitors and locals alike… Experience the world of Soho through their distinctive perspectives.\n\nJazz After Dark: Preserving the Timeless Legacy of Amy Winehouse\n\nWords and images by Rafael Bonito Cheira Xavier De Pina\n\nAs this iconic venue faces financial struggles and the looming threat of gentrification, a preservation effort is underway. Rafael Bonito Cheira Xavier De Pina speaks to Jazz After Dark’s owner Sam Shaker on upholding the timeless legacy of Amy Winehouse.\n\nHidden in plain sight, Jazz After Dark detains an unassuming charm that belies its historical significance. Nestled in the heart of Soho, this venue continues to survive the relentless march of time and the gentrification wave standing as a living testament to the birthplace of a musical legend: Amy Winehouse.\n\nBold LED lights illuminate the exterior, casting a warm glow on the street. A medium-sized screen plays Amy’s concert footage, refusing to let the legacy fade away. Inside, the venue morphs into what artist/owner Sam Shaker affectionately calls “Amy’s shrine”.\n\nAs you step into the dimly lit space, the ambience envelops you with a nostalgic charm. Bright red neon signs crown a well-lit bar, while candles made from champagne bottles flicker softly. The walls adorned with priced portraits and personal snapshots capture Amy’s essence, creating an intimate and sacred atmosphere.\n\nJazz After Dark opened its doors 35 years ago, a dream realized by the young artist from Cairo, Sam Shaker, who had migrated to London with an arts scholarship. The city’s fast-paced life fuelled his entrepreneurial spirit. The venue’s history dates back to Bob Marley’s family but was shut down by the police due to “misconduct,” an opportunity Sam seized with enthusiasm. After a brief stint as a French restaurant fell short, he transformed it into a jazz bar, blending his worlds of art and business.\n\nAt the age of 12, Sam embarked on his artistic journey, initially painting furniture for his father and uncle in Cairo, skilfully applying linseed oil. His artistic pursuits took him to Italy, where he captured the beauty of Italian landscapes on Egyptian scrolls during his formal education. Later, in the vibrant streets of Paris, he underwent a radical reinvention, drawing on naked bodies to captivate audiences. However, nothing could parallel the profound artistic transformation in Sam’s work than when Amy entered his life.\n\n“She came here for the first time when she was 16 years old, started working behind the bar, one day asked me if she could sing. I could tell she was drunk, but she started singing ‘I Will Survive’ by Gloria Gaynor. She was one hundred times better than the professionals I was hiring. From that day on, she never stopped.”\n\nAmy became a second daughter to Sam, ushering in a new artistic chapter in his life – Celebrity portraits – Getting commissions from guests Amy brought in such as Kate Moss, Lady Gaga and Robin Thicke, hidden in the small and red VIP room at the back of the venue, a sanctuary behind a curtain, away from the paparazzi’s eyes, the place that witnessed the creation of Amy’s iconic record, “Back to Black.”\n\n“She came here at about 3 am on a Saturday, in very bad shape after a big fight with her boyfriend Blake. She kept crying, and I was just trying to comfort her. I offered her a bottle of vodka and some chips and chicken wings, her favourites. She stayed here when writing the song from dawn on Saturday to Sunday around 7 or 8 pm.”\n\nDespite her fame, Amy continued to perform at Jazz After Dark right until her very last moments: “This picture was two days before she died. She came on the 20th of July because my birthday is on the 22nd. She was in a very bad situation, severely ill, we would normally celebrate my birthday together, have a drink, but that day she hugged me and said, ‘Sam, I cannot come… sorry, I’m not feeling well at all.’ On the 23rd, it came the news that she died”\n\nSam immortalizes Amy in his work, with one of his published books named ‘Losing Amy: An inspiration for my Art’ and turning Jazz After Dark to a “Life gallery” – telling the tale of an indelible bond between the two through the paintings she once commissioned him as well as personal photo-albums attached in every corner.\n\nHe recalls the moments they shared, including preparing Amy’s favourite food – meatballs with tomato salsa – a dish that now permanently graces the menu in her honour. Amy’s aversion to cutlery, embodied in her habit of greeting people with salsa on her lips, has become a distinctive trademark of the venue as well as the times he patiently guided her in learning to play the drums.\n\nSeated beneath a softly illuminated frame – a self-portrait of the singer – in his usual spot, he recollects the collaborative effort they put into painting it together. “She added golden glitters in the end, yup, that’s Amy.” These are just a few memories Sam still relives today when walking through the confines of Jazz After Dark the space that ties together the bond shared between the two artists.\n\nToday, the once-legendary VIP room is unfortunately reduced to a spot where carefree spills and antics prevail. Financial struggles threaten its existence, with escalating rent and the wave of gentrification posing a dark shadow over the venue’s future.\n\nA GoFundMe campaign has been initiated to save this Soho music landmark and Sam’s legacy. The vision extends beyond mere survival, aiming to breathe new life into the space through renovation and revitalization. The goal is to carry forward its legacy, providing a stage for emerging talent and maintaining its role as a cherished haven for musicians and artists alike.\n\nSupport ‘Refurbish Amy’s VIP Room at Jazz After Dark’ – donate here!\n\nJazz After Dark 9 Greek St, London W1D 4DQ\n\nRead the LCC takeover edition online here\n\nLCC Takeover edition contributors:\n\nAda Kohli | Natália Maria de Oliveira Magalhães | Erin Mussett | Mary Jane (MJ) Viado | Rafael Bonito Cheira Xavier De Pina | Jess Watts | Zhouhang Li | Isha Sankala | Tamaa Almashama | Noïra Ndakwala-Boketi | Marsho Dzanchuraeva\n\nArticles from this edition will be published online weekly – stay tuned for more!\n\nShare your thoughts in the comment box below!\n\nMore from the blog:"
