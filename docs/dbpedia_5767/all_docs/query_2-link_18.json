        "text": "With her gravelly voice and eclectic style, Amy Winehouse, 27, who has been found dead in London, won comparison with some of the great female singers such as Sarah Vaughan and Nina Simone.\n\nBut like another great singer, Janis Joplin, she had a talent for self destruction, and fought a long battle against substance abuse.\n\nAmy Jade Winehouse was born on 14 September 1983 in the well-to-do area of Southgate, north London.\n\nHer taxi driver father, Mitchell, was a jazz enthusiast and often sang songs to his daughter as she grew up.\n\nShe trained at the Susi Earnshaw Theatre School from the age of eight and, by the time she was 10, had formed a rap group with one of her best friends.\n\nWinehouse later attended the prestigious Sylvia Young Theatre School.\n\nShe began writing music at the age of 14 and a former boyfriend sent a tape of her singing with a jazz band to an A&R man.\n\nIt led to a contract with the Island/Universal record label and a publishing deal with EMI.\n\nHer debut album Frank, released in 2003, was described by The Times newspaper as \"earthy, warm, lived-in and astonishingly versatile\".\n\nShe co-wrote all but two of the songs and won praise for what one reviewer described as \"the cool, critical gaze\" in the lyrics.\n\nFrank was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize for album of the year in 2004, and Winehouse won the Ivor Novello songwriting award for best contemporary song with Stronger Than Me.\n\nBut it was the critical praise that followed the release of her follow-up album in October 2006 that propelled her to international stardom.\n\nRehab, the first track released from Back to Black, reached number seven in the UK singles chart.\n\nThe song, about her refusal to attend an alcohol rehabilitation centre, generated huge publicity, with Winehouse frequently being photographed drinking on stage and in pubs.\n\nIn February 2007, she scooped the title for best British female at the Brit Awards and, four months later, she picked up song of the year at the Mojo Awards.\n\nWinehouse was again nominated for the Mercury Prize and went on to be named artist of the year at the MTV Europe Music Awards in November.\n\nBut as her popularity soared, her health began to suffer and her behaviour became more erratic.\n\nShe appeared to be drunk on Channel 4's The Charlotte Church Show in 2006, and took part in Never Mind The Buzzcocks in a similar state.\n\nHer weight plummeted during an exhausting schedule of promotional appearances and concerts in the UK and US.\n\nShe admitted punching a female fan at a gig in London and attacking her boyfriend when he tried to calm her down.\n\nShe confessed to self-harming and spoke of battles with eating disorders. And she shocked a journalist from US magazine Spin when she carved the name of then-boyfriend Blake Fielder-Civil into her stomach with a shard of mirror during an interview.\n\nIt was a break-up with Fielder-Civil that inspired much of Back To Black.\n\nBut she surprised fans, and her own family, when she secretly married him during a trip to Florida in May 2007.\n\nIn November of that year, there was further turmoil when Fielder-Civil was arrested and accused of inflicting grievous bodily harm and attempting to pervert the course of justice.\n\nWinehouse herself was arrested and released on bail in December 2007 but no charges were brought against her.\n\nA month later she went into a rehab facility following the publication, by a tabloid newspaper, of pictures of a woman they claimed was Winehouse, allegedly smoking crack cocaine.\n\nShe played a number of gigs in 2008 but it became increasingly apparent that the turmoil of her private life was having a severe effect on her ability to perform.\n\nBut her performance at Glastonbury a few days later was described by one critic as \"dismal\" and tabloid interest centred on an incident where she appeared to punch a fan.\n\nAmy Winehouse took some time off after a slew of festival appearances in 2008.\n\nIn 2009, she was found not guilty of assaulting a burlesque dancer at a charity ball in central London.\n\nShe made a low-key return to the stage in a surprise performance at her local pub in London in October 2010.\n\nEarlier this year, Winehouse was admitted for treatment at the Priory clinic in south-west London.\n\nLast month, she pulled out of her European tour after she was jeered at the first gig in Serbia for appearing to be too drunk to perform.\n\nFor 90 minutes, she mumbled through parts of songs and at times left the stage - leaving her band to fill in.\n\nIn her short career Winehouse gave us just a glimpse of what might have been, before she was undone by her own personal demons.\n\nBut the songs she recorded, and the string of awards they brought her, served to underline what a talent she was."
