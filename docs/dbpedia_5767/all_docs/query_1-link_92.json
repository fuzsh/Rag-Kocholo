        "text": "The Coroner for Inner North London has resigned following an inquiry into his decision to appoint his wife without thoroughly checking her qualifications.\n\nDr Andrew Scott Reid appointed Suzanne Greenaway as the assistant deputy coroner in July 2009. She oversaw singer Amy Winehouse's inquest.\n\nMs Greenaway resigned in November last year because she had not been a lawyer in the UK for the required five years.\n\nThe Lord Chancellor and Lord Chief Justice suggested Dr Reid be removed.\n\nBut Dr Reid stepped down from judicial office on 7 December before the disciplinary process by the Office for Judicial Complaints was formally concluded.\n\nA spokesperson for the Office for Judicial Complaints said: \"The Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice had indicated their intention to remove Dr Reid from judicial office.\n\n\"Dr Reid was entitled to ask for a review body panel to review the Lord Chancellor and Lord Chief Justice's provisional decision. The review body panel recommended Dr Reid should be removed from office.\n\n\"However, Dr Reid resigned from his post as a coroner and also as a tribunal judge in the Health Education and Social Care Chamber, before the disciplinary process was formally concluded.\""
