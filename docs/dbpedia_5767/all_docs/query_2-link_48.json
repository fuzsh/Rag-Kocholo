        "text": "Enter the literary realm of the incomparable Amy Winehouse as her personal book collection, filled with intimate and revealing traces of her life and artistry.\n\nAmy Winehouse‘s personal book collection, which is set to hit the auction block at Catawiki, is causing a stir among literary and music enthusiasts alike. With experts estimating the priceless collection to be worth between €80,000 to €90,000, this unique lot of almost 230 books offers a captivating glimpse into the life and career of the legendary singer and songwriter through her personal reading choices.\n\nFrom her school days to her rise to fame and career, Winehouse’s library reflects her fierce and passionate personality, with many books bearing the marks of her love, including coffee and tea stains, lipstick marks, unfinished song letters, doodles, and extensive personal notes.\n\nAmong the treasures in Winehouse’s collection are well-read favourites like Jackie Collins, “Hollywood Wives” to the dark noir of James Ellroy’s “LA Confidential,” poetic memoirs of Maya Angelou to the rebellious prose of Charles Bukowski’s “Ham on Rye,” Winehouse’s library is a captivating mix of genres and styles. With titles like “The Butcher, the Baker, the Candlestick Maker: An Erotic Memoir” by Suzanne Portnoy and “Biker Bible: Bible for the Nations,” her collection is a fascinating testament to her eclectic tastes.\n\nIn addition to books from schools she attended, some with her own annotations, Winehouse’s collection also includes books inscribed to her, including one from her ex-husband Blake Fielder Civil, and books about or by other musicians who struggled with addiction, such as Jimi Hendrix, Boy George, and Anthony Kiedis. These books not only provide a biographical insight into Winehouse’s life, but also shed light on how her reading influenced her songwriting.\n\nBeyond the literary value, Winehouse’s collection also offers a poignant and intimate look into her personal life. From her grandmother’s email penned on a bookmark to the guest list for a party written on the last page of a book, these books are imbued with traces of her daily life and experiences. Some books even bear ownership stamps from hospitals where Winehouse was once admitted, showcasing the raw and unfiltered reality of her struggles with addiction.\n\nMark Harrison, book expert at Catawiki, expressed excitement about the auction, stating, “This personal library manifests much more than Amy’s treasured love for books and literature, but many fragments of her daily life that not many got to witness.” Winehouse’s collection is a testament to her multifaceted personality, showcasing her fierce and passionate nature that resonated through her music and art.\n\nThis is the first time the singer songwriters entire collection has been up for auction as a whole, and at least for the last 12 months far, it has managed to stay that way, with the auction house Type Punch Matrix who was originally responsible for bringing the collection together, saying they had a fight on their hands to keep it that way, as they initially came up for sale in separate lots. Co-founder of Type Punch Matrix, Rebecca Romney commented last year “This was a collection that deserved, as much as possible, to stay together. Not only because they spoke biographically about Winehouse’s life, but also because they spoke to her work as an artist and as a writer.” Heres hoping it stays that way.\n\nAs fans and collectors eagerly await the auction, Winehouse’s book collection stands as a powerful reminder of her enduring legacy as one of the most indelible musical artists of the early 21st century. It offers up a rare glimpse into the intersection of her public, private, and creative lives, providing a deeper understanding of the woman behind the music and her insatiable love for literature.\n\nCheck out the complete list of Amy Winehouse’s Book Collection below (yep all 230 of them):\n\nAmy Winehouse’s ART & DESIGN collection\n\n– Crumb, R. : Book of Genesis.

She developed bulimia in her late teens and the eating disorder dogged her for the rest of her life. Alex remembers her at the age of 17 hanging out with a group of girls who ‘were all doing it. They’d put loads of rich sauces on their food, scarf it down and throw it up. They stopped doing it, but Amy never really did… We all knew she was doing it, but it’s almost impossible [to tackle] especially if you’re not talking about it. It’s a real dark, dark issue.’” In a separate interview her brother elaborated: “She suffered from bulimia very badly. That’s not, like, a revelation — you knew just by looking at her […] She would have died eventually, the way she was going, but what really killed her was the bulimia.\n\n– Stover, Laren: The Bombshell Manual of Style.

Commentary: Winehouse doodling (hearts were a favorite) in her copy of a Jackie Collins novel (see next case). She seems to be making plans to see a movie, likely “RETURN OF THE [KING].” The Warner and Odeon are both London movie theaters.\n\n– Collins, Jackie: Lovers and Gamblers. London Pan Books, Late 1990s. Paperback. Reading copy. Considerable edgewear and some splits at corners of spine. Commentary: “Amy gave off a feeling of being slightly ashamed about how intelligent she really was. She’d have tons of Jackie Collins novels lying around the flat, but would hide her Dostoyevsky collection in a cupboard.” — her brother, Alex Winehouse, from “Amy Winehouse: A Family Portrait,” a 2015 exhibition at the Jewish Museum of London.\n\n– Collins, Jackie: Chances.

Rochester NY Scranton, Wetmore & Co. 1881. The only portion of the binding that remains is about 2/3 of the cloth spine. Otherwise, text block only, likely missing pages. 1907 Marriage license for Mr. William Smith and Ms. Alice Moore (of Bath NY) tipped in at title page. No apparent connection to AW’s family. Commentary: The oldest book in the collection, it is arguably also the one in the worst condition. Despite these anomolies, however, its meaning to Winehouse is unclear. Perhaps it belonged at one time to her grandmother. Perhaps it was a gift when Winehouse was married. Perhaps she simply like it.\n\n– Ginsberg, Allen: Howl, Kaddish, and Other Poems. London Penguin, Late 2000s. Paperback. Dampstaining throughout. On second page of WCW’s intro, AW has notes, working out lyrics. First page of “Howl” includes her rhyming list, also a phone number and other notes. Page 3 of “Howl,” handwritten address, same pen as previous. Underlining on page 4 and a couple of marginal notes (in two different inks) on page 5. Commentary: This copy of Allen Ginsberg’s HOWL contains several pages of Winehouse’s notes, lines, and a list of rhyming words — all apparently for a never-realized song. Winehouse probably read this book on her 2008/09 trip to St. Lucia with friend and photographer Blake Wood. Wood mentions having the title with them in the photobook dedicated to Winehouse published in 2018 by Taschen.\n\n– Gold, Glen David: Carter Beats the Devil. London Sceptre/Hodder & Stoughton, ca 2000s. Paperback. Reading copy. Commentary: In a 2007 interview with THE GUARDIAN, Winehouse said, “I never travel without a good book.

Cynthia Gordon Winehouse would pass away in 2006; afterwards, Winehouse would get one of her most iconic tattoos, a classic pin-up inspired by her grandmother. Winehouse was buried with her grandmother in 2011\n\n– Gregory, Philipa: The Other Boelyn Girl. London Harper Collins, Early 2000s. Paperback. Reading copy.\n\n– Hiaasen, Carl: Strip Tease.

London Penguin, ca 2000s. Paperback. Reading copy. Commentary: Winehouse clearly loved popular novels. Harlan Coben, Tom Wolfe, Candice Bushnell, James Ellroy, Sidney Sheldon, Carl Hiaasen, and Elmore Leonard are all\n\nrepresented in the collection. However, BE COOL, Leonard’s followup to GET SHORTY and set in the music industry, would likely have been of particular\n\ninterest.\n\n– Leonard, Elmore: Cuba Libre. London Penguin, ca 2000s.

Gift inscription to AW: “27.7.02 / To Amy Bunny, / On the occasion of / becoming an honorary / Northerner. / Much love, / Chris xx.” Commentary: This inscription is probably from Winehouse’s “first serious boyfriend” Chris Taylor, whom she was dating at the time of the inscription when Amy had just moved into a new apartment in the northern London neighborhood of Finchley. Chris was reportedly the subject of Winehouse’s hit “Stronger Than Me” from her debut album. “Bunny” was a nickname of Winehouse’s, one she often used online.\n\n– Bosworth, Patricia. Marlon Brando.

Commentary: Both Boy George and Blur’s Alex James, who each battled their own addictions, publicly reached out to Winehouse during her life.

Phil Griffin directed three of these. A fourth directed by Griffin was planned (“Love Is A Losing Game”), but Winehouse failed to show for the scheduled shooting and two alternate videos were released instead, using live performance footage and photographs. The final video, for “Tears Dry On Their Own,” was directed by famed photographer Dave LaChapelle, who inscribed his 2006 photobook (right) to the singer and her then-husband, Blake Fielder-Civil.\n\n– James, Alex: Bit of a Blur.

Commentary: TO LIVE, originally released in 2005, but not published in the UK until 2006, the same year as BACK TO BLACK, follows the writer as he travels across the US visiting “the most famous rock-n-roll death sites.” Winehouse’s copy appears not only well read, but contains an unmistakable red lipstick SWAK on page 71.\n\n– Lee, Peggy: Miss Peggy Lee: An Autobiography.

Some edgewear, bit of scuffing to rear panel of dj. Large read price sticker on front panel. Commentary: British tabloids often speculated about whether Amy was a football fan — and if so of which club.
