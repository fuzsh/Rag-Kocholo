        "text": "The first woman to graduate as part of the inaugural class of the RJAM (Roots, Jazz, and American Music) program at San Francisco Conservatory co-created with SFJAZZ, Anna studied with conservatory faculty, members of the SFJAZZ Collective including David Sánchez and Edward Simon, and jazz greats Julian Lage and Randy Weston. Her time with the program made so much of an impact on Anna that she returned to the Conservatory as Assistant Director of the RJAM program and has established a career as a performer whose omnivorous tastes have informed her singular aesthetic, blending influences and genres freely and with an enthusiastic passion.\n\nThe second and final studio album by the late English singer and songwriter, Back to Black won 2008 GRAMMYs for Record of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Album, and Song of the Year for the album’s first single, “Rehab,” and Winehouse herself won Best New Artist honors on the strength of the release. Recorded during Winehouse’s separation from her then-ex-boyfriend and future husband, the album explores themes of Infidelity, heartbreak, and resiliency."
