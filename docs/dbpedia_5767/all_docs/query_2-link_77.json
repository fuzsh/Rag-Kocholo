        "text": "After years of waiting, the Amy Winehouse biopic is officially en route. Taking the lead role is Industry star Marisa Abela, whose transformation into the singer was revealed in a first look in early 2023, with another image arriving just a few weeks ago – complete with iconic beehive, piercings and heavy winged eyeliner. StudioCanal and Focus Features, who are behind the film, have also confirmed a release date for 12 April 2024 in the UK.\n\nA poster for the film, showing Abela as Winehouse on stage, was released in early January, along with a teaser trailer, which gives a sneak peek of what the film will cover: the beginning of Winehouse's career; meeting her future husband, Blake Fielder-Civil; and the paparazzi intrusion that dogged her life. \"I don’t write songs to be famous. I write songs because I don’t know what I’d do if I didn’t. I want people to hear my voice, and just forget their troubles,\" says Abela, as Winehouse.\n\nBut what else do we know about the film – and about the controversial and tragic life of its eponymous star?\n\nWhat do we know about the film so far?\n\nWhen Asif Kapadia’s Oscar-winning documentary Amy debuted in 2015, there was speculation as to when – or even if – a biopic of Amy Winehouse would arrive (there was even talk of Hollywood star Noomi Rapace signing on to play her that same year). The singer, who heartbreakingly died aged 27 in 2011, certainly led a life full of enough incident, drama and tragedy to pack a feature film, but many, including her fans, said that her legacy should remain untouched – especially due to the controversy around her later years, much of which was discussed in Kapadia’s documentary.\n\nBut now, a biopic is officially underway, with the support of Winehouse's estate (so you can expect lots of her musical back catalogue to feature in the film). The biopic is titled Back to Black, after Winehouse’s most iconic album, which posthumously briefly became the bestselling album of the 21st century. And whatever disquiet might have been raised about the making of such a film, the team behind it is certainly impressive: Back to Black is directed by acclaimed, BAFTA-nominated artist and filmmaker Sam Taylor-Johnson. She's joined by writer Matt Greenhalgh, whose previous credits include Control (about Joy Division's Ian Curtis) and Nowhere Boy, an account of John Lennon’s teenage years.\n\nMarisa Abela as Amy Winehouse and Eddie Marsan as Mitch Winehouse, filming in London\n\nWho's starring in it?\n\nFinding the right actress to portray Amy Winehouse is no mean feat, and Back to Black’s choice in Marisa Abela will mark the first major lead for the young British actress. Her star turn in BBC’s Industry, as the ambitious intern Yasmin, made her one of the most exciting young British stars to watch, and an appearance in Greta Gerwig's Barbie – unquestionably the hit film of 2023 – cemented her place as one of our favourite new stars.\n\nLike Winehouse, Abela is of Jewish descent and also has musical experience. The RADA graduate and Londoner announced the news on her Instagram in early 2023, with a photo of her posing in front of an Amy Winehouse mural in Camden, saying, \"And for London. This is for London. Cause Camden Town ain’t burnin down,\" a reference to Winehouse’s acceptance speech at the 2008 Grammy’s.\n\nJack O'Connell – best known for his roles in Skins, Godless and, most recently, Lady Chatterley's Lover – stars opposite Abela as Winehouse's husband Blake Fielder-Civil, and has already been seen on set shooting scenes in central London. The actor Eddie Marsan plays the singer's father, Mitch Winehouse, while The Crown star Lesley Manville is joining the cast as Winehouse's grandmother, Cynthia Winehouse.\n\nMarisa Abela as Amy Winehouse in the upcoming biopic\n\nWhen will it be released?\n\nThe film is scheduled to be released theatrically by StudioCanal in the United Kingdom on 12 April 2024, and by Focus Features in the United States on 10 May 2024.\n\nWhat will the film cover?\n\nAccording to a statement from the production companies, Back to Black will focus on \"Amy’s extraordinary genius, creativity and honesty that infused everything she did. A journey that took her from the craziness and colour of '90s Camden High Street to global adoration, and back again, Back to Black crashes through the looking glass of celebrity to watch this journey from behind the mirror, to see what Amy saw, to feel what she felt.\"\n\nIt is expected that Back to Black will therefore cover Amy’s beginnings in Camden, her rise through London’s jazz club scene, her early success with first album Frank and the stratospheric heights she reached with her second, Back To Black – from record-breaking Grammy wins to devastating media harassment. It will also reflect on the addictions which plagued her later years: her declining health, her rocky relationship with husband Blake Fielder-Civil and her tragically early death from alcohol poisoning.\n\nWinehouse performing in 2007\n\nIt was immediately obvious she wasn’t just 'talent'… she was genius\n\nThe subject matter is evidently close to Sam Taylor Johnson’s heart, and her statement on the film pledges a fidelity and respect to Amy’s story. \"My connection to Amy began when I left college and was hanging out in the creatively diverse London borough of Camden,\" she said. \"I got a job at the legendary KOKO Club, and I can still breathe every market stall, vintage shop and street. I first saw her perform at a talent show at Ronnie Scott’s Jazz Club in Soho and it was immediately obvious she wasn’t just 'talent'… she was genius. As a filmmaker you can’t really ask for more.\n\n\"I feel excited and humbled to have this opportunity to realise Amy’s beautifully unique and tragic story to cinema accompanied by the most important part of her legacy – her music. I am fully aware of the responsibility, and with my writing collaborator – Matt Greenhalgh – I will create a movie that we will all love and cherish forever. Just like we do Amy.\"\n\nAmy with her father Mitch Winehouse in October 2010\n\nAnd what might it leave out?\n\nBack to Black has the full backing of the Amy Winehouse estate, and therefore it seems unlikely that the film will tackle many of the controversies surrounding Amy’s father, which were raised by Kapadia’s 2015 documentary. Questions were asked around the time of her death (and highlighted extensively in the 2015 film) about Mitch Winehouse’s responsibility for his daughter’s welfare, and how culpable he was for forcing her on stage when she should have received medical assistance. It is with a sad irony that one of Winehouse’s most famous and popular songs, Rehab, is about this very dilemma: if my daddy thinks I’m fine…\n\nMitch Winehouse was immensely critical of the 2015 documentary. \"They are trying to portray me in the worst possible light,\" he told The Guardian at the time, about the film’s unflinching portrayal of his insistence that Amy keep performing, and his belief that she didn’t need to go to rehab. He never sought legal action against the film, and admitted that, although the documentary made him appear money grabbing and uncaring, his crime was most probably just an inability to deal with, and properly understand, Amy’s addictions. He now runs The Amy Winehouse Foundation, which helps young people with addiction.\n\nEight years on from Kapadia’s film, and the first maelstrom of accusations against Mitch, it remains to be seen how Sam Taylor Johnson will tackle his role in Amy’s life. It may once again prove the sticking point of Amy’s story – by the nature of its inclusion or omission.\n\nWinehouse performing in 2007\n\nWhat's the true story behind the biopic?\n\nAmy Winehouse was born in 1983 in North London to parents Mitch and Janis Winehouse. Growing up, she was heavily influenced by jazz. Most of her maternal uncles were professional jazz musicians and her paternal grandmother, a singer, had once dated the legendary English jazz artist Ronnie Scott, founder of the eponymous club in Soho. As a teenager, she attended the Sylvia Young Theatre School and, in 2002, aged 19, she was signed to 19 Management, run by Simon Fuller, the man famous for managing the Spice Girls.\n\nIn 2003, her first album Frank, was a critical, if not globally commercial, success. It was nominated for the Brit Awards, her song Stronger than Me won the 2004 Ivor Novello Award, and the album was shortlisted for the Mercury Music Prize. Despite these elite plaudits, it would be her 2006 second album, Back to Black, which would make her an international superstar. It became the bestselling UK album of 2007 and won Winehouse five Grammys – the most ever received by a British female act.\n\nWinehouse on stage in 2008\n\nIt was the unprecedented fame which her second album brought her that made all the difference. It coincided with the heyday of tabloid and gossip magazines in the mid Noughties, and the paparazzi hounded Winehouse as she was in the throes of addiction and a stormy relationship with her husband Blake Fielder-Civil, who was quoted as saying that he introduced his wife to crack-cocaine and heroin. During this time, images of Winehouse in dirty clothes and blood-stained ballet pumps outside Camden pubs became a staple of the tabloids. The harassment was so intense that the singer successfully applied for an injunction against a leading paparazzi agency."
