Jane Winehouse, Managing Trustee of the Amy Winehouse Foundation said “we are delighted to continue our long-standing support for music therapy at CPotential. This is life-changing work and a charity that we are proud to be associated with. And to now have the music room named in Amy’s honour is a beautiful tribute. We know that Amy would be so happy that her legacy brings so much joy to so many children.”",

This is life-changing work and a charity that we are proud to be associated with. And to now have the music room named in Amy’s honour is a beautiful tribute. We know that Amy would be so happy that her legacy brings so much joy to so many children.”\n\nClick here to read the Ham & High press article\n\nThe event was a huge success, with the Mayor of Haringey, Councillor Gina Adamou joining the community celebrations along with Councillor Zena Brabazon – Cabinet Member for Children, Schools and Families. This was a great opportunity to be updated on the charity’s extensive developments of integrated therapy services and support for children with cerebral palsy, global developmental delay and acquired brain injury.\n\nBrett Parker, CEO at CPotential said “we are overwhelmed by the continued support from the Foundation and Amy’s family, so naming our music therapy room in Amy’s honour is the least we can do for their generosity.”\n\nSpecial thanks also go to Pegusus, American street artist Chris Turner – a friend of Amy’s, who generously painted and donated three new canvases for pride of place in the music therapy room.\n\nMitch Winehouse gave an extremely moving speech, followed by speeches from Chris Gilbert, CPotential Chair of Trustees and Brett Parker, CEO.\n\nGuests were also treated to a wonderful musical tribute from members of Girton College, Cambridge A Cappella, with thanks to Felix Elliot, Izzy Benson, Isabella Chan and Dan Sandell.

This showed an example of how children interact and take part in structured musical activities with Ruth Hunston, Highly Specialised Music Therapist.\n\nMusic Therapy makes a significant impact on children’s physical, cognitive and emotional development, and gives children their own voice through musical interaction. When some children are unable to communicate verbally due to their disabilities, music helps them connect to the world around them.\n\nMore information about CPotential’s funded Music Therapy programme and integrated therapy services.\n\nEnfield Independent press article\n\nClick here to read the Jewish Chronicle article\n\nEnjoy some photos from this lovely event…"
