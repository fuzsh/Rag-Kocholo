        "text": "Do you ever wonder what it would be like to know a big celebrity?\n\nUnless you're born to famous parents, everyone starts somewhere. Most of the celebrities we know today were once just people like you and I, going to school or work and going about their daily lives.\n\nAnyone who went to the BRIT school in Croydon, will have studied alongside some massive A-list celebrities, even if they didn't know what the future would hold for these people at the time.\n\nThe likes of Adele, Amy Winehouse and Jessie J, all incredible singers, went to the school, which is selective in its intake.\n\nLocated in the Selhurst area of Croydon, the school provides education and vocational training for performing arts, media, art and design and technology for performance.\n\nIt's one of only three performing arts and technology schools in the country that are free to go to.\n\nEducator and entrepreneur, Mark Featherstone-Witty decided he wanted to open a secondary school specialising in performing arts, apparently after being inspired by the 1980s film Fame. He approached Sir Richard Branson to help him with the project, which is how the BRIT school first came about.\n\nAdele, born in Tottenham in North London, moved to West Norwood in Lambeth at the age of 11 after a short spell living in Brighton. It was while living there that she attended the BRIT school alongside Leona Lewis, who won the X Factor in 2006 and pop star Jessie J.\n\nDo It Like A Dude singer Jessie J was born and raised in Redbridge in East London and acted in Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End show Whistle Down the Wind at the young age of 11. At 16 she started studying at the BRIT school.\n\nAmy Winehouse grew up in Southgate in North London and after attending the BRIT school went on to have a hugely successful career, with her debut album, Frank, achieving platinum status.\n\nAs many know, Amy tragically died by alcohol intoxication in July 2011. Subsequently the Amy Winehouse Foundation was set up to help prevent the effects of drug and alcohol misuse on young people and generally help inspire and support young, disadvantaged people to reach their full potential.\n\nThe BRIT school has also seen a number of other famous people attend.\n\nSingers Katie Melua and Kate Nash also went to the school before launching successful music careers, while Spiderman actor Tom Holland also attended the school before beginning his career on the stage in Billy Elliot the Musical in the West End.\n\nWant more news?
