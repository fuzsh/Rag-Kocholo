        "text": "Winehouse grew up in Southgate, in North London, a blue-collar Jewish kid raised on classic pop standards by Frank Sinatra and Dinah Washington. Her parents, Mitch, a cab driver, and Janis, a pharmacist, married in their early twenties and split when Amy was nine. Though she and older brother Alex mostly lived with Janis, Amy considered herself a daddy’s girl — a tattoo on her left shoulder even bore the phrase. While we were in Toronto in 2007, Mitch was in town for a couple of days, and Amy clearly loved doting on him, making him a turkey-and-cucumber sandwich that he said reminded him of a matzo-banana combo she used to fix for him. “I was a very silly, very hyper kid,” she said at the time.\n\nBy age 10, Winehouse had formed a Salt-n-Pepa-inspired rap duo called Sweet ‘n Sour with her best friend, and started messing around with Alex’s guitar a couple of years later. “When I got a little bit of money, I got my own, so I could play whenever I wanted,” she said. “I always wrote poetry and stuff like that, so putting songs together wasn’t that spectacular.” She showed early promise at the Sylvia Young Theatre School and studied briefly at the esteemed BRIT School for performing arts — the same school Adele later attended — and a few others. She pierced her nose, began smoking pot and skipping class, and dropped out of school when she was 15.\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nWinehouse started singing with a jazz band when she was 16, and playing solo gigs — just her and her guitar — a few years later. It wasn’t long before a friend offered her free studio time to track some demos, but Winehouse was perplexed: “I didn’t think it was special to be able to sing,” she said. “And I didn’t understand that I could go in a studio and pay nothing, and write whatever I wanted to write. I just didn’t understand why.”\n\nIn 2002, she signed a management deal with American Idol creator Simon Fuller’s 19 Entertainment, a publishing deal with EMI and a label deal with Island UK. Later that year, she went to Miami to record her first album with Salaam Remi, who had produced music for Nas and the Fugees. “She came over and sat down and I was like, ‘So what do you do?'” recalls Remi, who continued working with Winehouse until her death. “She picked up an acoustic guitar, started singing ‘Girl From Ipanema,’ and pretty much just lit up the whole room.” Her jazzy 2003 debut, Frank, earned critical raves and awards at home, including a nomination for the Mercury Music Prize and the Ivor Novello Award for songwriting.\n\nBut as strong as her debut album was, it barely hinted at the greatness of the record that would follow. On Back to Black, Winehouse underwent a remarkable transformation — from a conventionally pretty, promising performer to a tattooed, beehived diva belting songs about desperate love. She started dating Fielder-Civil in 2005, and the pair would hang around her local Camden bar spinning classic girl-group and Motown tunes on the jukebox, playing pool and, especially, drinking. She attributed the shift from her early jazz sound to the Sixties R&B of Back to Black to her transition from being a stoner to a drinker. “I used to smoke a lot of weed,” she told Rolling Stone. “I suppose if you have an addictive personality, then you go from one poison to the other. The whole weed mentality is very hip-hop, and when I made my first record, all I was listening to was hip-hop and jazz. The weed mentality is very defensive, very much like, ‘Fuck you, you don’t know me.’ Whereas the drinking mentality is very ‘Woe is me, oh, I love you, I’m gonna lie in the road for you, I don’t even care if you never even look my way, I’m always gonna love you.'”\n\nShe re-teamed with Remi for some of Back to Black, but the stroke of genius was pairing her with producer Mark Ronson, who had built his reputation as a DJ but had begun producing songs for Lily Allen, Sean Paul and Christina Aguilera. Ronson recruited the eight-man Brooklyn funk-and-soul crew the Dap-Kings to back Winehouse on tracks including “You Know I’m No Good” and “Rehab,” imparting an authentic retro-cool vibe perfectly suited to Winehouse’s aesthetic. “It was obvious that she knew the difference between what sounded good and what sounded bad,” says Dap-Kings guitarist Binky Griptite, who toured with the singer in 2007 and remained her friend. “She had good taste. That’s increasingly rare. There are so many artists whose record collections only go back five years. You gotta know some history, and she knew some history. That’s why we’re sitting here talking about her.”\n\nRelated\n\nRonson recognized the huge-voiced singer with a bad-girl look as part of a tradition stretching back to the Sixties. “The Shangri-Las had that kind of attitude: young girls from Queens in motorcycle jackets,” he told Rolling Stone at the time. “Amy looks fucking cool, and she’s brutally honest in her songs. It’s been so long since anybody in the pop world has come out and admitted their flaws, because everyone’s trying so hard to project perfection. But Amy will say, like, ‘Yeah, I got drunk and fell down. So what?’ She’s not into self-infatuation and she doesn’t chase fame. She’s lucky that she’s that good, because she doesn’t have to.”\n\n(Upon learning of Winehouse’s death, Ronson expressed heartbroken shock, tweeting, “She was my musical soulmate and like a sister to me. This is one of the saddest days of my life.”)\n\nThe exposure brought on by Winehouse’s ballooning fame — and the demand to tour behind the album — accelerated her decline. “She was always questioning her own ability,” says Dougie Charles-Ridler, a longtime friend and the owner of the Hawley Arms, a favorite hometown pub. “She’d have a shot of tequila or a glass of wine just to settle her nerves. She needed more of that to settle her nerves as time went on, and it got kind of out of control.” And her vulnerability was obvious to the people close to her. “There was one time on the Back to Black tour when the tour manager was looking for Amy, and she was two hours late,” adds Charles-Ridler. “Suddenly there’s someone banging on my door, and I open it, and it’s Amy. She ran and jumped in my bed and hid under the duvet. And it just showed. She was just so scared.”\n\nWinehouse briefly went to rehab in early 2008 after U.K. tabloid The Sun published a video of her smoking crack, but subsequently told Rolling Stone‘s Claire Hoffman that she was on drugs the whole time she was there. Almost as soon as Winehouse won her five Grammys in February, accepting them via satellite due to a visa issue, the focus began to shift from anticipating her next album to anticipating her next public meltdown.\n\nDuring her separation from Fielder-Civil after his incarceration, things got worse. In one bizarre incident, a video surfaced on YouTube of a wasted Winehouse and notorious ex-Libertines singer Pete Doherty playing with newborn white mice, their fingernails caked with what appeared to be black resin. But Winehouse remained remarkably unguarded, despite the army of paparazzi camped out in front of her house (and whom she occasionally would send on errands). “To be honest, my husband’s away, I’m bored, I’m young,” Winehouse told Rolling Stone. “I felt like there was nothing to live for. It’s just been a low ebb.”"
