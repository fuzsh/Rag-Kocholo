        "text": "A new performing arts school sponsored by the music industry has been given the go-ahead by the Government as part of a new wave of free schools.\n\nGillian Keegan told The Telegraph that ministers have accepted a bid to create a BRIT School North, following the success of an initial BRIT school in south London, where alumni included Adele, Amy Winehouse, Tom Holland and Jessie J.\n\nThe free school, supported by firms such as Sony Music Entertainment UK, Universal Music UK and Warner Music UK, will be in Bradford and offer subjects such as dance, music, theatre and production arts to more than five hundred 16 to 19-year-olds.\n\nMrs Keegan said: “Free schools are one of the great innovations of this Conservative government, and if you want to look at what a blueprint for education should look like in the 21st century it is what we have created with the focus on school standards. Free schools are one element of that, academy structures are another.”\n\nShe added: The BRIT School for the North is basically something that came out of the Levelling Up White Paper where we said we need to put more of this in the North.\n\n“A lot of people have worked closely with the British Phonographic Industry to come together to put this bid in. And it’s a successful bid. So it’s one of the new free schools that we’re going to be announcing.”"
