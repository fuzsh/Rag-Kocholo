        "text": "— An autopsy on singer Amy Winehouse Monday failed to determine what killed the 27-year-old star, leaving fans and family with a weeks-long wait for the results of toxicology tests. Her funeral will be held Tuesday.\n\nA family spokesman said the private funeral “for family and close friends” would be held at an undisclosed time and place.\n\nWinehouse’s parents visited mourners outside her north London home to thank them for their support.\n\nThe singer, who had struggled with drug and alcohol abuse for years, was found dead Saturday at home by a member of her security team, who called an ambulance. It arrived too late to save her.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police said Monday that a forensic post mortem “did not establish a formal cause of death and we await the results of further toxicology tests.” Those are expected to take two to four weeks.\n\nAn inquest into the singer’s death was opened and adjourned at London’s St. Pancras Coroner’s Court. During the two-minute hearing, an official read out the name, birth date and address of Winehouse, described as “a divorced lady living at Camden Square NW1.”\n\n“She was a singer songwriter at the time of her death and was identified by her family here at St. Pancras this morning,” said coroner’s officer Sharon Duff.\n\nDuff said the scene of Winehouse’s death “was investigated by police and determined non-suspicious.”\n\nLast month, Winehouse canceled her European comeback tour after she swayed and slurred her way through barely recognizable songs in her first show in the Serbian capital, Belgrade. Booed and jeered off stage, she flew home and her management said she would take time off to recover.\n\nHer last public appearance came three days before her death, when she briefly joined her goddaughter, singer Dionne Bromfield, on stage at The Roundhouse in Camden, near her home.\n\nWinehouse released only two albums in her lifetime — 2003’s “Frank” and the chart-topping “Back to Black” in 2006. Both shot up the music charts as fans bought them to remember her by."
