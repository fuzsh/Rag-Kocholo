        "text": "For its lack of talking heads and other tired non-fiction conventions, Asif Kapadia’s Amy Winehouse documentary “Amy” automatically jumps to salutatorian status in the Class of 2015.\n\nConsistent with the director’s stunning 2010 film “Senna,” which gave similar in-depth attention to Formula One champion Ayrton Senna — another interesting public figure who lived fast and died young — his follow-up feature is impressively composed almost entirely of pre-existing footage.\n\nAdding only a few new scenery shots — all of which appear to have been achieved through well-orchestrated drone photography — and limiting his original interviews with Winehouse’s friends, family and colleagues to audio, Kapadia weaves an informative, entertaining tapestry that holds viewers’ attentions for over two hours and should prove valuable for super fans and novices alike.\n\nInsights from Winehouse’s father Mitch, her ex-husband Blake Fielder, music producers Salaam Remi and Mark Ronson and collaborators Tony Bennett and yasiin bey (the artist formerly known as Mos Def) are valuable in their own regard, but the undisputed star of “Amy” is the singer and her music.\n\nOffering tunes from Winehouse’s teenage years through her days as a global superstar, Kapadia smartly features many of her lyrics as onscreen text, a decision that makes encountering her music more of a complete experience, especially as her words reflect recent life events with courageous honesty.\n\nA reliance on home video further gives “Amy” an exclusive factor, but the footage’s jittery quality makes the overall film a lesser work than another recent music doc on a fellow “27 Club” member — “Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck.”\n\nThough conventional in many regards and likewise full of amateur clips, Brett Morgen’s film provides some of the best talking heads outside of “Jodorowsky’s Dune” and goes above and beyond genre expectations by animating both the words of the Nirvana frontman’s journals and providing illustrated moving images that bring to life his home sound recordings.\n\nTranscendent moments like those are few in “Amy” — nothing tops her innocence and vulnerability upon receiving the 2008 Record of the Year Grammy via satellite — and while Kapadia presents her tragic, drug-hampered trajectory in a manner that mirrors Cobain’s, there’s comparably only so much suspense in the inevitability of her premature demise.\n\nThe results are nonetheless sure to leave audiences melancholic and educated, but many may leave wondering why more traditional approaches weren’t used to help smooth out the film’s rougher patches.\n\nGrade: B. Rated R. Starts July 10 at the Carolina Cinemas and Fine Arts Theatre."
