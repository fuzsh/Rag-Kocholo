The curriculum meets PA standards for health and English language arts.\n\nAccording to the Office of National Drug Control Policy, a media literacy approach can support substance abuse prevention goals. Media literacy can empower youth to be positive forces of social change, which benefits drug prevention efforts by teaching youth:\n\nTo recognize how media messages influence them. Students can internalize the skills they need to protect themselves against messages about drugs or unhealthy lifestyle choices.\n\nTo develop critical thinking. When youth learn to analyze media, they can uncover the values messages about drugs embedded in media and decide whether to accept or reject those messages.\n\nTo foster healthy self-esteem. Students skilled and knowledgeable about the media and their techniques can use media to creatively produce messages of their own. Encouraging healthy self-esteem is one of the “anti-drugs” that reduce children’s vulnerability to drug use.\n\nACTIVITIES FOR A PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TRAINING:\n\n1.
