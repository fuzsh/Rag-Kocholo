        "text": "(AP, ABC7) - An autopsy on singer Amy Winehouse Monday failed to determine what killed the 27-year-old star, leaving fans and family with a weeks-long wait for the results of toxicology tests. Her funeral will be held Tuesday.\n\nA family spokesman said the private funeral \"for family and close friends\" would be held at an undisclosed time and place.\n\nWinehouse's devastated parents visited mourners outside her north London home to thank them for their support.\n\nThe singer, who had struggled with drug and alcohol abuse for years, was found dead Saturday at home by a member of her security team, who called an ambulance. It arrived too late to save her.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police said Monday that a forensic post mortem \"did not establish a formal cause of death and we await the results of further toxicology tests.\" Those are expected to take two to four weeks.\n\nAn inquest into the singer's death was opened and adjourned at London's St. Pancras Coroner's Court. During the two-minute hearing, an official read out the name, birth date and address of Winehouse, described as \"a divorced lady living at Camden Square NW1.\"\n\n\"She was a singer songwriter at the time of her death and was identified by her family here at St. Pancras this morning,\" said coroner's officer Sharon Duff.\n\nDuff said the scene of Winehouse's death \"was investigated by police and determined non-suspicious.\"\n\nIn Britain, inquests are held to establish the facts whenever someone dies violently or in unexplained circumstances. Assistant Deputy Coroner Suzanne Greenaway said Winehouse's inquest would resume on Oct. 26.\n\nThe singer's father, mother and brother visited her home on Monday, stopping to inspect the mounds of bouquets, candles and handwritten notes across the road from the Victorian house.\n\nHer father, Mitch Winehouse, thanked mourners for their tributes.\n\n\"I can't tell you what this means to us - it really is making this a lot easier for us,\" he said. \"We're devastated and I'm speechless but thanks for coming.\"\n\nThe singer's mother, Janis, was in tears as she examined the flowers, candles, vodka bottles, flags, drawings and handwritten cards left by neighbors, fans and well-wishers. Many of the offerings expressed the same sentiment: \"What a waste.\"\n\n\"I'll remember her as a troubled soul,\" said fan Ethna Rouse, who brought her 4-year-old son to leave a bouquet. \"Like many artists in the world - they are tortured souls, and that's where the talent comes from.\"\n\nThe singer had battled her demons in public, too often making headlines for erratic behavior, destructive relationships and abortive performances.\n\nDr. Paulo Negro, a psychiatrist with Kolmac Clinic, one of the largest outpatient addiction treatment programs in Maryland, said drugs are lie weapons of mass destruction.\n\n“We are all weak creatures the more that you leave to your willpower the more likely you are not likely to succeed,” he said.\n\nSuccess, he says, can mean intense counseling, support, meetings, a sponsor and changing your lifestyle and the people around you.\n\nBut she was remembered fondly by her neighbors in Camden, the creative but gritty neighborhood where she lived on and off for years.\n\n\"She was too young to die and too talented, and too beautiful,\" said Peggy Conlon, landlady of the Dublin Castle pub, where Winehouse occasionally stopped for a drink. \"She's sorely missed by everyone, not one person had a bad word to say about that kid.\"\n\nActor Russell Brand, a former drug addict, wrote a lengthy tribute in which he urged the media and public to change the way addiction is perceived - \"not as a crime or a romantic affectation but as a disease that will kill.\n\n\"Winehouse and I shared an affliction, the disease of addiction,\" he wrote. \"Addiction is a serious disease; it will end with jail, mental institutions or death.\""
