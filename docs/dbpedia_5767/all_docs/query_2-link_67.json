The late star's family have been able to use £340,000 to help disadvantaged youngsters, including £20,000 to help people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and £38,000 has gone to homeless charity Centrepoint.\n\nThe foundation has also funded scholarships to London's Sylvia Young Theatre School, a stage school Amy attended until she was 15 years old. Amy's old home in Camden Town, north London, is currently housing around 60 young homeless people, who are given a hot meal each day, and a road nearby looks set to be named after her.\n\nMitch recently called on Beyonce to donate to The Amy Winehouse Foundation after he appeared far from impressed with the singing sensation teaming up with Andre 3000 on a cover of the late star's hit 'Back to Black' for new movie 'The Great Gatsby'. Last month, he wrote on Twitter: ''First I have heard about Beyonce and Back to Black. Sounds like some of you don't like the idea. ''I don't know this but what if Beyonce gave £100,000 to foundation.\n\nDo you know how many kids that would help? Just putting it out there! ''Let me repeat. This is the first I have heard of Beyonce doing Amys song. (sic)''"
