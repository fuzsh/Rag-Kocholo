She tragically died from accidental alcohol poisoning in her London home on July 23, 2011, at the age of 27.\n\nAs Back to Black soared in popularity, reaching number seven on the American charts—the highest debut position for a British woman at that time—her appearance in the tabloids began to shift dramatically.\n\nHer relationship and subsequent marriage to Blake Fielder-Civil in May 2007 attracted considerable media attention. During this period, Winehouse, who struggled with bulimia, experienced extreme weight loss and began to behave erratically. She canceled shows and faced scrutiny due to her alcohol and drug addiction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough she entered rehab for treatment, her stays were brief, and reports of substance use continued. In July 2009, she and Fielder-Civil divorced. Two years later, Winehouse attempted a comeback tour, but it was canceled after she appeared in a drunken state at the opening concert. She died from alcohol poisoning the following month.\n\nSinger Tyler James who was late Amy Winehouse's best friend talked about her\n\nLate singer Amy Winehouse’s best friend, Tyler James, who wrote a book about her titled My Amy: The Life We Shared, spoke to The Times in 2021 about her struggles. He noted that she was a girl in her twenties battling addiction, and everyone around her was affected.\n\n“Everybody was watching it. When you go to rehab, you have to be the strongest you've ever been in your life, even when you are the weakest,” he said. He urged viewers and fans to understand her rather than judge her as a \"doomed person.\"\n\nAdvertisement"
