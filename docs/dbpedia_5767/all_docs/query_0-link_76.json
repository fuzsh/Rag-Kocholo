Since then, she has appeared on prime time UK Television shows such as Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Your Country Needs You, the ITV shows Pop Stars The Rivals, and Stars in Their Eyes.\n\nShe was invited to join Channel 5’s Sunday night summer show Don’t Stop Believing presented by Spice Girl Emma Bunton, performing for 6 weeks to the British public as a member of Channel 5’s very own supergroup.\n\nNicola presents a dynamic vocal-powerhouse type of show, and when she sings, she sings from her soul exuding class, quality, and a genuine character every time she steps out on stage. Her infectious girl next door personality is relatable and endearing, making her one of the most charming performers out there today.\n\nWhilst Nicola is a rock chick at heart, She’s able to capture something for everyone, delivering a diverse genre of artists through the decades from pop, soul, rhythm and blues, classical, and musical theatre. Nicola believes what makes a show, is for those 45 minutes… you forget where you are and it’s over before you know it! It’s as if you are part of the show from beginning to end!"
