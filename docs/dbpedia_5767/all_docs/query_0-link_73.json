        "text": "A new chapter looks set to be written with the news that the British Phonographic Institute which represents the major record labels has applied to the Department of Education to open a specialist arts school in Bradford aimed at 16 to 19 year olds that would be free to attend.\n\nTentatively titled Brit School North the school would concentrate on performing arts and digital design with the funding for the project coming from Universal, Warner and Sony music who would provide any extra funding as well as industry expertise and useful contacts.\n\nSpeaking about the decision to submit a proposal, Chair of the BPI, YolanDa Brown OBE DL said:\n\n“We are incredibly proud of our track record in promoting and funding specialist creative education and this application reflects our ambition to extend this even further across the UK. The creative industries are a powerful force for social mobility, providing opportunities based on ability and talent. We look forward to building upon the proven success of this model to give a greater number of young people from across the North of England an opportunity to pursue a career in the creative industries – both on stage and behind the scenes.\n\n“Bradford already has a wonderfully vibrant cultural and creative scene. We are very excited about the benefits of this partnership and how we can contribute to Bradford’s ambitions, but also how this school can continue our work to diversify our talent pipeline by ‘levelling-up’ opportunity, both geographically and socio-economically.”\n\nMayor of West Yorkshire, Tracy Brabin said:\n\n“West Yorkshire is the place to be when it comes to culture and creativity – now so more than ever as we draw closer to Bradford’s year in the spotlight as the UK’s City of Culture 2025.\n\n“With vibrant musical venues in abundance, and even more in the pipeline, our region is well and truly cementing its place on the world stage as a creative and cultural hotspot. With EMI North recently making the decision to invest in West Yorkshire, it goes to show that we’re already punching well above our cultural weight.\n\n“So, while it’s no surprise, I’m thrilled that Bradford has been selected as the preferred location for this new school – what an incredible opportunity it would provide for the talented young people of our region and beyond!”\n\nLisa Mallaghan, Director, Bradford Producing Hub said:\n\n“As one of the leading talent development organisations in Bradford, and cultural capacity partner to Bradford City of Culture, Bradford Producing Hub are delighted to hear the news that a new specialist creative school modelled on the BRIT School might be opening in Bradford.\n\n“It would bring a huge boost to the local creative education offer and provide access to top quality training opportunities for our talented young performing artists and creatives.\n\n“We hope to work alongside them to showcase talent and fast-track the careers of our young people!”\n\nThe former pupils of the Brit School in south London have included Adele, Amy Winehouse, Katie Melua and Leona Lewis amongst others.\n\nWith Bradford being the UK City of Culture in 2025 and the anticipated opening of the former Odeon building as Bradford Live later this year the news of the Brit School North announcement gives the city a chance to blow it’s own trumpet.\n\nThe final decision to approve the project is anticipated later this year with the school opening in 2026."
