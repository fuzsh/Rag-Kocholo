        "text": "Research Interest\n\nDr. Matthew Breay Bolton is professor of political science and co-director of the International Disarmament Institute at Pace University, New York City. He was part of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) team awarded the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize. Bolton has also worked for 20 years with UN and NGO efforts addressing the humanitarian impact of landmines, cluster munitions, military robotics and the arms trade. His field research has highlighted the concerns of communities affected by nuclear weapons, in the Marshall Islands, Kiribati, French Polynesia, Fiji and Cook Islands, as well as NYC. Earlier work investigated the political economy of landmine and cluster munition clearance in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Cambodia, Laos, South Sudan and Vietnam. His emerging research considers politics in a more-than-human world, from the role of islands in international relations to bear-human conflict in the Adirondack mountains. In 2023, Bolton was appointed by NYC Council Speaker Adrienne Adams to the city’s Nuclear Weapons Free Zone Advisory Committee and he represents Pace University in the NYC Climate Exchange’s On-Island Research Program Team. Bolton has published six books, including Political Minefields and Imagining Disarmament. His work has featured in BBC News, Newsweek, PBS Newshour, The Guardian, The Daily Mail, The Boston Globe, Gothamist, The Hill, Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, Arms Control Today, El Pais, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Jane’s Foreign Report, Radio New Zealand, The Japan Times, The Fiji Times and Marshall Islands Journal. Bolton has a PhD and Master’s from the London School of Economics and is currently enrolled in a Master’s at SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry.\n\nPublications\n\nDo Humanitarian Disarmament Norms Offer Survivors Justice or Charity?: A Case Study of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons’ Victim Assistance and Environmental Remediation Provisions\n\nBolton, M. & Welty, E.
