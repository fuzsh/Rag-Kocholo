        "text": "Raye is eager to find out whether she's made it onto 'The Wall'.\n\n'The wall', you ask? Well, at the BRIT school - the performing arts secondary school based in Croydon which is partially funded by the BRIT Awards - there's a wall featuring photos of its world-famous, successful and incredible alumni. Amy Winehouse is up there, so is Adele and Jessie J, of course.\n\n\"I remember leaving the school like ‘I have to make it onto this wall,\" singer Raye, real name Rachel Keen, who attended from the ages of 14 to 16 tells Cosmopolitan UK during a quick London Fashion Week break. \"So, I can’t wait to go back one day and hopefully see my face on there too.\n\nI remember leaving the school like ‘I have to make it onto this wall'\n\n\"I need to email the headteacher and find out if I’m on that wall yet,\" she jokes.\n\nCosmopolitan is speaking to Raye because she recently surprised a group of present-day BRIT school students, along with the Brit awards and its sponsor Mastercard, to re-record a version of her hit song 'You Don't Know Me' with Jax Jones.\n\n\"It was a special moment being a BRIT [alumna] myself,\" she tells us. \"When I went, we had a lot of amazing guests and speakers come in and talk to us and share their success stories. I always wanted to achieve that myself. It felt like a real moment.\"\n\nRaye recalls Jessie J coming round to the school to give a talk, Gary Barlow popping in to take a songwriting masterclass and, essentially, \"loads of amazing guests and speakers coming in and talking to us and sharing their stories.\"\n\nRaye with BRIT school students\n\nSince leaving the BRIT school at the age of 16, Raye's gone on to have numerous chart successes. Apart from the aforementioned Jax Jones hit, there's her collaboration 'By Your Side' with Jonas Blue, 'Cigarette' with Mabel and Stefflon Don and 'Decline' with Mr Eazi. In 2017, she was placed third, behind Ray BLK and Rag'n'Bone Man, on the BBC's 'Sound of...' list.\n\nThe 21-year-old grew up in Croydon and attended a regular, non-performing arts school before auditioning for BRIT school. She'd heard about the school on the playground aged 10, after learning it's where X Factor winner Leona Lewis, and singer of ultimate ballad 'Bleeding Love', studied.\n\nWe had a lot of amazing guests and speakers come in and share their success stories. I always wanted to achieve that myself\n\nThough it was established in 1991, the BRIT school started to gain a reputation around a decade ago when more and more of its incredible alumni started to find huge success. As well as Adele, Amy and Jessie, it was home to Katy B, Ella Eyre, Gemma Cairney, Imogen Heap, Tom Holland, The Kooks, Kate Nash and more. What also sets it apart is that unlike every other stage school in the UK, its completely free. This means it is more accessible to pupils from communities and backgrounds often excluded from expensive, prestigious drama schools which is a very good thing but also, obviously, makes it super competitive.\n\nRaye and her dad \"proper nerded out\" researching exactly what she needed to do to get in. Though she'd won her school talent show aged 11 and regularly sang at church and charity fetes, she was going to need more, so took her piano grade five exam, studied musical theory and completed her singing grades.\n\nAnd, yep, the audition process was pretty intense, as you can imagine. Raye recounts an interview, written test and theory test followed by an audition in front of all other hopeful students as well as the teachers.\n\nAt the BRIT awards, 2018\n\n\"It was very overwhelming,\" she reflects. \"Especially, at the age of 14. But it does prepare you for the brutality of the industry. The industry is tough, just like that.\"\n\nSo, what was it like when she got to the school? We're imagining Fame-style a capella vocal warm-ups in the corridors, clarinets being played on school buses and people jeté-ing across the playground rehearsing their contemporary dance routines.\n\n\"To an extent it was like that,\" Raye confirms. \"You have loads of talented, creative kids boxed in to one school. There’s the guy that whips out his guitar in the canteen and stuff like that. It’s definitely fun. I saw an embarrassing video of me not too long ago in a Batman shirt, bright orange hair singing outside really loudly on my first day. I was just really excited to have got in.\"\n\nDespite the unique environment compared to your typical secondary school, pupils there still have to do regular lessons. Though her curriculum was more swayed towards music than the average, Raye still had to take her GCSEs including Maths, English, Science, Spanish and Sociology.\n\n\"The school does prepare you for the brutality of the industry\"\n\nAs us, non-theatre school folk know, secondary school can be stressful enough. There's the constant backdrop of peer pressure, a whole load of change going on with your body, the struggles to keep up with work and lessons you really don't understand (*cough* physics) all while trying to figure out your own identity and what you want to do with your life.\n\nSo, we can only imagine that this complicated time is exacerbated when faced with a school full of talented people all trying to make it in the same, extremely competitive, industry.\n\nRaye says the BRIT school was an \"interesting environment\" and she did struggle at times to make or maintain friendships due to its competitive nature.\n\n\"It's not like when you start regular high school at 11 and you’re a kid and grow up with your friends,\" she explains. \"I was 14 when I started and when you meet loads of young people for the first time at that age it’s very interesting, there’s a lot of competitiveness naturally in environments like that so it’s quite hard for friendship groups to meld together.\n\n\"I did have a bit of trouble sometimes with the friendship aspect, mostly because I was quite a big character and wasn’t really aware of, or wanting to, suppress myself so maybe I rubbed a few people up the wrong way. I had a really loud voice and I wasn’t afraid to use it, you know, I’m very opinionated and I really believed in a lot of things.\"\n\nRaye says though she always had friends she did spend some lunchtimes by herself. However, on the plus side, the situation also taught her a lot.\n\n\"I learned how to work with other people really well. We would get put into groups and would have to work out what people’s strengths are, when it would be time for me to suggest an idea or simply just go off and learn my part really well. I learned how to work in a team with loads of young, competitive, talented people. It was a really interesting and amazing experience.\"\n\n\"Doing two years at the BRIT made me realise exactly what I wanted to do with my life\"\n\nAfter finishing her GCSEs, Raye dropped out of the school at 16. She'd already signed to a manager and was attending songwriting and singing sessions from the moment school would finish on a Friday all through the weekend until Monday. After going on a couple of trips to LA and making headway with her music outside of school, the scheduling of school and work started to conflict with each other. So, she decided to leave and focus on her burgeoning career.\n\n\"Doing two years at the BRIT made me realise exactly what I wanted to do with my life,\" Raye says. \"I had got to the point where I had the opportunities and resources available to to focus 100% of my time onto my career.\"\n\nSince then, her career has accelerated. While she's not attending the BRITs this year, she was there last year working the red carpet and performing at the official after parties.\n\nNext up, she's working on plenty of exciting songwriting projects with other artists including Fifth Harmony's Normani and making her own music, collaborating with the likes of DJ David Guetta."
