        "text": "\"I do my gigs, turn up for things and try to remain oblivious,\" she says as the car jerks and jolts in the heavy traffic. \"But now, I've got a No. 1 album so I just have to soak it up. It's surreal suddenly becoming something you see on TV.\"\n\nPart of this ease in the spotlight may well come from the groomed-for-stardom training at the Brit Academy, the performing arts school whose graduates include Winehouse, Kate \"the new Lily Allen\" Nash and Adkins's friend, the rising star and recent visitor to Australia, Jack Penate. Part of it would be the seemingly contradictory lack of a lifelong urge to be famous.\n\n\"I was at college, then I was supposed to go to university in Liverpool to do music. I didn't want to go but it was an excuse not to work in a shop,\" Adkins explains. \"Then I got on MySpace and I got emails from XL [an independent record label and home to heavyweights such as the White Stripes and Radiohead].\n\n\"I went in for a meeting trying to blag an A&R job, hoping to be a scout because I'm around the [hard-edged domestic hip-hop] grime scene in London and I thought, 'Yeah, that would be perfect', and they were like, 'We want to sign you.' Oh, OK.\n\n\"At the time I had three songs [including what would be the opening and closing tracks on her debut album, Daydreamer, and Hometown Glory] and I couldn't write any songs for ages afterwards. It was really unconscious but I went from writing songs because I wanted to, to writing songs when it had suddenly become my job.\"\n\nAnd what helped to break through this impasse?\n\n\"I met my future ex-boyfriend. And then I had plenty to write about,\" she says casually. \"I've been writing since I was 16 but I wrote nine songs in three weeks for this record.\" It's a shame the \"future ex-boyfriend\" wasn't wearing a sign identifying him as such when the romance started.\n\n\"He kinda was,\" she giggles. \"I knew he would be bad trouble but I needed a bit of drama to draw out something inside of me.\"\n\nBad men are useful, then?\n\n\"Yes, they are. I used him better than he used me. I'm No. 1,\" she giggles again.\n\nA little later, Adele is sitting on the steps of an East London building confessing something else: she's scared of flying.\n\nI suggest she could travel to Australia on a cruise ship, earning her passage by singing some standards in the show room. But unlike Jamie Cullum, who cut his teeth on cruise ships, Adele has never done the covers shows.\n\n\"No, I find it really difficult doing covers,\" she says. \"I feel like a hypocrite saying that because [Bob Dylan's] Make You Feel My Love is on the album but when I'm singing other people's songs, apart from Make You Feel My Love, I don't sing it with a passion or sincerity. I don't think I'm believable and my favourite singers, like Etta James, Roberta Flack, Anne Peebles and Karen Dalton, they are the most believable singers ever. I believe every single word and breath that's on their records. I don't see how you can relate to something if you don't believe what I'm saying.\"\n\nAs it turns out, hearing Flack two years ago was crucial. One criticism of Adele is that she sounds smooth and, suspiciously for some, too ready but it's also true that she doesn't greedily binge on the notes.\n\n\"When I wrote my first song, Hometown Glory, when I was 16 my voice just changed,\" she says. \"Before that I was trying to do Beyonce, all those [she lets fly some of that melismatic warbling] and Roberta made me realise you could have soul without doing that.\n\n\"It became obvious when I started writing my own songs and I couldn't fit in all that stuff because it was written from the heart and became very personal. With Hometown Glory, my voice took on its own.\"\n\nMEANWHILE, Duffy, the officially designated Voice of 2008, already has the kind of mythology building around her that will come to rest as fact on the internet for years.\n\nIt's not enough that her voice is a blend of Lulu's velvet power and Ronnie Spector's teenage throb. Or that it's allied with old-school soul songs that play with all the drama of string-laden '60s pop, such as the tearjerking Hanging On To Love, or the Motown stroll of Serious. Or even that her first single, the rhythm-heavy, swinging Mercy, went to No. 1 in Britain without beginning its journey on MySpace, You Tube or Facebook.\n\nNo, there's the \"fact\" that she dropped her first name, Aimee, so as not to be further lumped in with the officially designated Voice of 2007, Amy Whitehouse. Not true, she says, adding that she has always been called Duffy by friends.\n\nThen known as Aimee Duffy, she was runner-up on the Welsh version of the show, but her career didn't take off until the former musician and co-founder of the Rough Trade label, Jeanette Lee, discovered her. She took Duffy to London and set her to work with former Suede guitarist and producer Bernard Butler and songwriter Eg White.\n\nMaybe the most outlandish \"fact\" of all is that she grew up in a north Wales seaside village called Nefyn on the Llyn Peninsula in Gwynedd - a town so small and insular that the nearest record store was in another town kilometres away, leaving her with her parents' small vinyl collection and no knowledge of any other singers.\n\n\"I can vouch for that,\" Duffy says, a voluminous blue shirt hanging loosely on her small, slim frame as she sits perched on an unsteady chair in the London offices of Rough Trade. \"We didn't know anything else, so it was normal. I have friends who are there who only own one record and don't care. And why should they? They're happy, they go to the pub every weekend, everyone they've ever known is around them, music is in the background of their lives on the radio and they are really content with that. I wasn't culturally deprived or socially withdrawn from the world. It was very beautiful, quite positive.\"\n\nShe wasn't deprived but she did want more. Even if she wasn't sure what more would be. She went to college in the smallish city of Chester, worked in a fishery, sang in jazz clubs and dreamed.\n\n\"I knew I wanted to make a record but I didn't know what would make me happy,\" she says. \"Did I want to make music and stay in Wales, married with two kids? Would that have served my purpose? But I realised you have to go, you have to make sacrifices, you have to be hungry and callous and focused.\"\n\nFour years of writing, rewriting and recording have paid off but it's clear that Duffy hasn't been in a studio gulag the whole time. The night before the interview she had performed downstairs in a Piccadilly club called Pigalle, the final night of a month-long residency that had long sold out.\n\nHer long blonde hair swinging, she had pushed her standout song, the small-town drama Rockferry, from an intimate beginning to a barnstorming climax and plumbed the depths of the swaying, soulful Warwick Avenue. Occasionally a little awkward, she clearly grew in confidence as the room responded to songs such as the bluesy Syrup And Honey, which has echoes of Etta James. Not that you can assume Duffy has even heard Etta James.\n\n\"I only recently discovered Joy Division and I'm still yet to really discover [probably the most famous Rough Trade band] the Smiths,\" Duffy says with the kind of wonder that makes her sound half her 23 years. \"I would never have wanted to do some things I've done if I'd heard these things before because I wouldn't want to be plagiarising. There is a Jimi Hendrix song, Stepping Stone, and I would never have written [my own] Stepping Stone if I'd known that it already existed.\"\n\nAnd there's the Monkees' Steppin' Stone, I tell her.\n\n\"Really?\" she gasps, quite genuinely. \"I didn't know that until this exact moment. And Glen Campbell's By The Time I Get To Phoenix, the way he's describing the journey every step of the way, that's what I did with Warwick Avenue but I genuinely didn't know this amazing song.\"\n\nIt must have been odd then when people were throwing names at her like Dusty Springfield (who, to be honest, she doesn't sound much like) or Aretha Franklin (who she definitely doesn't sound like). Was she thinking, \"Really? Who are they?\"\n\n\"Yes, it was very much like that,\" Duffy says with a characteristic seriousness. \"To me it's not about my voice, it's really about my songs now. So when people talk about my voice and how it reminds them of this, that and the other, I find it really hard to go back to that frame of mind because I'm no longer a singer, I'm a lady who made a record.\"\n\nDuffy's album Rockferry will be released on April 5 through Universal. The single Mercy is released today.\n\nAdele's 19 is out now through XL/Remote Control.\n\nWho's who among the current crop of soul sisters\n\nAustralian teenager with an old voice, signed directly to a British label with a view to being another Amy Winehouse. But her soul is matched by a fondness for more contemporary pop.\n\nLaura Marling\n\nYet another teenager, but her style owes more to Joni Mitchell, folk music and the wry insight of the smarter-than-average observer of life."
