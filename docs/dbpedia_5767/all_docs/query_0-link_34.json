        "text": "The Trip: A Glimpse into Transformation 😁 Before the trip, there was Glee, a bundle of nerves, tears streaming down her face, reluctant to leave the cocoon of her parents' embrace. But after just one night and two days, Glee returned with a spark in her eyes, brimming with stories of courage and camaraderie. She extended a heartfelt thank you to her teacher, grateful for an experience that nudged her to face her fears and step beyond the comfort of a home where doting parents and attentive servants were always at her beck and call. In this brief journey, Glee found a friend in Mia, a girl often misunderstood for her aggression. Yet, in this shared adventure, Mia emerged as a pillar of strength for Glee, showcasing empathy and care she didn’t display or perhaps went unseen in the corridors of school. This excursion might well be the turning point for Glee, a significant stride towards blossoming into a confident young girl, less dependent on constant adult approval and assistance. And Mia? She returned to a world that now looks at her with renewed respect and understanding, both from peers and teachers. Her actions have rewritten the narrative that once defined her. This is the essence of education. It's about these profound yet subtle moments that leave indelible marks on children's lives. It’s a reminder for us, the adults, to set aside our preconceived labels and approach each child with an open mind and heart. Such experiences reaffirm the transformative power of schooling – it's not just in the lessons we teach, but in the life-changing journeys we facilitate. #Education #Transformation #Growth #StudentExperience #LifeLessons\n\nDid you know only 9% of Americans keep their New Years Resolutions? A whopping 23% quit by the end of the first week in January and 43% quit by the end of the month (according to Fisher College of Business). What makes a resolution so hard to commit 💪🏼 to? Do we over think 🧠 it? Are our expectations too high 😱? Do we make resolutions about things that do not necessarily matter 🤷♀️? If we fall off the path, is it too hard to get back on? If you think about it resolutions are the perfect way to talk about goal ⏰ setting, establish simple steps for achieving a goal (it doesn't have to be huge!), and an overall commitment to whatever your resolution is about whether it be towards health🌡, home🏠 or happiness🤩! Goal setting is a life skill as we work collaboratively to build active minds 💭, healthy bodies 🍎, and happy hearts ❤️. Check out this week's blog on how to make the usually daunting task of goal setting fun, engaging, and one in which the whole family can participate in! #primroseproud #newyears #resolutions #newyears2024 #family #preschool #toddler #goals #primroseproud #primrosehudl #primroselincoln #leadershipmatters #leadership\n\nThis week I've made some exciting progress cold calling schools to introduce the Murals in Schools project. It's been a significant breakthrough for me as I transition from the world of thoughts and judgments to the world of performance and action. Distinguishing between the worlds of performance and morality has been eye-opening. In the world of performance, it's all about the facts - what I did or didn't do. On the other hand, the world of morality revolves around identity and value judgments - whether something is good or bad. Separating performance from morality is empowering. Instead of getting caught up in emotions and self-criticism, I'm focusing on taking more action and moving forward. If a school isn't interested, I call another one! #MuralsinSchools #ColdCalling #landmarkforum\n\nLeaping into a new school year as a very #proud #elementaryschoolprincipal. I have officially named this “the year of #connection and #kindness.” Connection to our #students, our #families, our #community, each other, and ourselves. Connection doesn’t happen by accident. It’s something we need to create. Just because we’re wired for it doesn’t mean we’re competent at it. We need to teach it and we need to live it. Kindness, genuine kindness. Not that confetti kindness. The kindness that is proactive to nice’s reactive. The kindness that takes #hardwork, #energy, and #thoughtfulness. The type of kindness that leaves somebody better than the way we found them. Throughout the last week of Staff #In-Service, I made sure my #teachers and #staff heard me tell them “I Need You.”, “You are here for a reason.”, and, “You make a difference even larger than you may ever know.” All of which couldn’t be more true, and all of which, I know I’ll never be able to tell them enough this school year. I #challenge everyone here to think about what you are doing to #lead with #kindness and #connection. Please leave a note on this post to share a little bit about your work around this. Now, let’s all begin to create our To Be Lists in addition to those daily To Do Lists. Wishing everyone a #schoolyear filled with #joy, #growth, and #purpose. 💙\n\n“Thought of the Day”!!!! “Make Something Happen”!!!! When I was blessed with the opportunity to work with parents of elementary and middle school children, I needed a way to introduce myself in a warm and welcoming way. So what did I do???? I dug in the crates LOL 😂!!!! I pulled out my old reliable gift basket making trinkets and created a fun icebreaker. Yep, the parents loved it and I found a way to start a conversation about how I’m here to help not intrude. So when you are faced with a new endeavor full of unknowns, turn to your creative side and “MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN “!!!!!!!#workforcetraining"
