        "text": "I may be a little late to have discovered this unbelievable musical phenomenon, but Angelina Jordan continues to impress and inspire me daily. The more I found out about her, the more I wanted to hear her sing and uncover more of her story. This would account for the length and breadth of this new post. There’s enough here to keep you informed, inspired, and entertained at your own pace.\n\nI want to sing for the whole world. Singing is as important as breathing to me. I just love to sing. — Angelina Jordan\n\nI recently discovered and am thoroughly enjoying listening to an amazingly talented young artist—Angelina Jordan Astar from Oslo, Norway. Born January 10, 2006, this musical child prodigy started singing very early in life.\n\nThanks to her maternal grandmother, Mery Zamani, Angelina began listening to classic American jazz artists when she was a very young child. She started singing around 18 months and by 3 knew that’s what she wanted to do with her life—become an international singing superstar. (The full clip was later posted on TikTok.)\n\nLuckily, her family has supported her in that direction. As a young child, Angelina attended the Oslo Waldorf School and participated in the Oslo School of Music and Performing Arts after-school program where she received vocal training.\n\nIn addition to singing, she also learned how to play 4 instruments—piano, violin, guitar, and flute—and she paints! She also writes regularly in her journal, part of which was later turned into a book. More on that below. She speaks several languages. For years she has been covering other artists and is now starting to record her own songs.\n\nEnters Norway’s Got Talent at 7 years old and wins\n\nIn these earlier videos, it is totally incongruous to see such a small young child performing old American jazz standards on Norway’s Got Talent. For her audition she sang Billie Holiday’s version of Gloomy Sunday. The judges could not believe what they were hearing. Some were at a loss for words; others were teary-eyed. After Angelina finished singing, the audience and judges rose to their feet applauding wildly. As they sat down and the judges started interviewing Angelina, we hear music playing softly in the background. It’s the beautiful song, How Long Will I Love You?. That’s the moment Norway, and, when the video went viral, the rest of the world, fell in love with Angelina and her amazing voice.\n\nAfter Angelina auditioned for NGT, one of the judges concluded her remarks with this statement: You ARE music! The other female judge said: I think that you are born to sing, and added in front of everyone that “we have a superstar.” Afterwards the judges said they were blown away, that Angelina was the best they’d seen.\n\nWatch the final full show where she sings Summertime and goes on to win NGT with 46% of the vote at 7 years of age! See Angelina Jordan All Performances On Norways Got Talent.\n\nShe puts a spell on you\n\nHere is a major jaw-dropping, mind-blowing experience. It’s how I first discovered this child prodigy during the Covid pandemic staying home watching Netflix and YouTube videos. Listen to Angelina, now 9, belt out I Put A Spell On You in a studio with musicians, and later, live on Germany’s Little Big Stars.\n\nOften covered in the past, this 1956 song was written and composed by Jalacy “Screamin’ Jay” Hawkins. His own recording of it was selected as one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame’s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. You have to wonder how she discovered such historically significant artists. Watch him sing it and you’ll understand how she honors him (he’s on the candle she first holds up to the camera) by staying true to the original, yet creating her own version of it (see the conductor nodding at the written directions of her arrangement).\n\nAngelina has recorded over 130 covers from 80 different artists that she’s posted on Facebook and YouTube over the years. She arranges her own versions of popular songs and directs musicians how to play them. This video ranks as one of the most outrageous mind-blowers, with hundreds of reactor videos and millions of views! I love to see reactors try to respond in disbelief when they hear her sing this song. It’s a double enjoyment for me—reacting to their reactions, as well as my own, again!! For example: Soul Reacts, a songwriter who cannot comprehend what he is hearing; and joethemaster‘s over-the-top reaction.\n\nPontus Österlin at PO Talks put together a brilliantly edited 8-minute compilation of a range of many reactors’ reactions as Angelina belts out I Put A Spell On You. During the credits listing them, he included footage of Jay Hawkins screaming out his song, with parallel clips of Angelina. This is definitely worth watching!\n\n(Later inserted) The following year I replied to a question on Twitter as to which black and white film I thought was the best and most watched in 2001 and I said this one directed by Per Heimly adding his Twitter address. He liked it and we started a DM. I was thrilled and surprised and told him the world owed him a great debt for what he did for Angelina and her family, especially her grandma Mery Zamani. He messaged back: It’s a Family Of Great Genius . 🤘❤️🙏\n\nBIBISI also posted this ANGELINA JORDAN BEST 23 VOCAL COACHES ANALYSIS REACTION MASHUP & COMPILATION (I Put A Spell on You).\n\nI also enjoyed One Stop Reactions Latest 2022 Special Reactions for Angelina Jordan – I Put A Spell On You | compilation reaction!!\n\nAnother song that’s up there is Feeling Good. She was 10 years old when she performed it at Allsang På Grensen – TV2, and later LIVE on The Stream Gir Tilbake.\n\nShe also gave an amazing performance of Dinah Washington‘s version of What A Difference A Day Makes. English subtitles were later added to the opening interview where she says she’ll be traveling to the USA for some singing engagements. She did sing Fly Me To The Moon on The View in 2014 when she was 8 years old.\n\nAt 12, Angelina Jordan came out with her first album of jazz and pop cover songs, It’s Magic. She is backed by The Staff Band of the Norwegian Armed Forces. The CD also includes 2 of her own songs, Oslo and What Is Life. You can hear it on YouTube. See her powerful 2018 performance of “It’s a Man’s World” with the military band.\n\nThat year Angelina was invited by Quincy Jones to sing Fly Me to the Moon with his orchestra at his 85th birthday concert in the London O2 Arena (27.06.2018). She opened the show with the same arrangement Quincy had written for Frank Sinatra. When she first sang privately for him, he said her talent reminded him of a young Michael Jackson.\n\nAmerica’s Got Talent Golden Buzzer\n\nAngelina appeared on America’s Got Talent: The Champions 2020 when she was 13 years old. She told Heidi Klum that she had waited 10 years to sing for Simon Cowell. And it was on the biggest stage in the world! This was her moment. She auditioned with her own spellbinding version of Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody, which won her a Golden Buzzer from Heidi, who could hardly contain herself. After the show had aired, Angelina posted a tweet thanking them all for having her and for the Golden Buzzer, which is included there.\n\nReflecting on that moment, Angelina said: “When Heidi stood up it felt like time stood still. I can’t believe it. The confetti felt like millions of gold stars were falling on me. It was really the best moment of my life.”\n\nAs the judges and audience members were on their feet applauding wildly, I heard an excerpt of Eva Cassidy singing Over The Rainbow playing in the background and thought, how appropriate! One amazing angelic voice honoring another as her dream finally, really did come true!\n\nTalent Recap posted Angelina Jordan: ALL Performances on America’s Got Talent Champions, which includes the introduction. Kaleidoscope RMX posted 3 videos: Part 1, the AUDITION INTRO; Part 2, the AUDITION; and Part 3, the FULL GOLDEN BUZZER MOMENT, which started with the 3 judges’ reactions and concluded with an overwhelmed Heidi Klum who stood up and hit the Golden Buzzer, then went on stage to hug and kiss Angelina on both cheeks. The other judges joined them, a first to have all four congratulate a contestant on stage at the same time. Simon also hugged her and said: “I don’t think you know how good you are. Really!” The camera segued to Angelina’s family: her thankful uncle Michael, sister Juliette’s happy tears, mother Sara and grandma Mery hugging.\n\nAngelina later returned for The Champions Season 2 2020 final round to sing her unique take on Elton John’s Goodbye Yellow Brick Road. She blew the judges away again, and the crowd went nuts in joyful disbelief.\n\nAngelina was later joined by amazing sand artist Kseniya Simonova and talented young violinist Tyler Butler-Figueroa for an exciting group performance of Someone You Loved in the AGT Champions Finale.\n\nBoris Palenovski later edited all 3 performances together in higher res: Angelina Jordan (13) – All performances – America’s Got Talent: the Champions Season 2 – 4K video. In the 2nd performance, at 3:52-55, you can see 13-year-old Angelina wearing a T-shirt with her 7-year-old face on it from when she performed on Norway’s Got Talent.\n\nThe girl with a thousand voices\n\nAngelina later recorded Bohemian Rhapsody, with Queen’s blessing, for her official channel. She also sings many cover songs by today’s great artists, like Adele’s All I Ask and her cover of Bob Dylan’s Make You Feel My Love. She even sounds like Amy Winehouse in Back To Black. Her performance of Whitney Houston’s I Have Nothing is filled with emotive power and heartfelt feelings as seen in this screensaver from a video of her singing the song.\n\nVariety Media later created a must hear compilation of Angelina Jordan’s 6 Different Stunning Magical Voices! Angelina may emulate these artists, vocally and emotionally as she inhabits their songs, but she interprets them in her own unique stylistic way, oftentimes better than the original! Like any great jazz artist, she is developing her own sound, finding her own voice, and now performing her own music. We are all in for many surprising treats.\n\nWhen she was 10 years old Angelina was asked to record a song by Brandon Lowry, aka Sterling Fox or Baby FuzZ. Angelina’s version was a demo, not meant to be released. She said she would never record it again because it deals with suicide. Nothing happened with his song, which he had written and recorded with some Norwegian friends. Someone later “leaked” the audio. Rusty Shackleford provides an explanation in this comment. He includes Baby Fuzz’s comment—an attempt to clear the air about it after he had heard it. Angelina’s version of I’m Still Holding out for You could easily have become a Top 10 hit.\n\nWorldwide online reactions\n\nBesides her impressive vocal skills, what gives listeners goosebumps and moves them to tears are the powerful soulful feelings she puts into each song. How can someone that young, who has not yet experienced life’s ups and downs, express such emotions and understanding? It boggles the mind! There is no doubt that Angelina is an old soul in a young body—something the judges at NGT and AGT said, as well as others who have commented on her performances.\n\nShe has 2 billion Facebook views and over half a billion on YouTube. There are many compilation channels of her music and 100’s of reaction videos of people responding to some of the many songs she’s posted. Most of them are visibly moved, jaw-dropped at a loss for words.\n\nOne of the more qualified reactors is Spanish-speaking vocal coach Ceci Dover. She explains things in detail, sharing valuable advice. See this one she posted of Angelina covering Lana Del Ray’s Born To Die.\n\nIn this enjoyable video (select English subtitles), Ceci uses excerpts of Angela singing between ages 7-13 to give us an informed overview of the evolution of her amazingly talented voice.\n\nSee Angelina Jordan’s rise to stardom! 🚀 – “When You Believe” ⏳ 🎼 🏆 Along with Angelina’s cover of this iconic song is a visual montage created by Kaleidoscope RMX. It shows her commitment to and belief in herself using excerpts from NGT to AGT and a sweet surprise ending. Very emotional and inspiring!!\n\nCreatively collaborating with Stargate, signing with Republic Records\n\nAfter turning down many requests to sign Angelina, the family eventually settled on what they felt was the right record company that would allow her to create her own style of music, and not mold her into something artificial for commercial gain. When she was 14, they signed with UMG’s, (United Music Group) Republic Records.\n\nAngelina released her first singles on the Republic Records label: “Million Miles” in November 2020 and “7th Heaven” in March 2021. Both songs are co-credited to the multiple Grammy-award-winning Los Angeles-based Norwegian production duo, Tor Erik Hermansen and Mikkel Storleer Eriksen, aka Stargate. Read how this creative collaboration came about in these postings by this Angelina Jordan Fan Club – The Shield on the WIKI: Angelina Jordan and Stargate.\n\nRepublic released 4 videos—2 Live in Studio and 2 Official Lyric Videos: Million Miles (Live in Studio) and (Official Lyric Video), a very personal song about losing her grandfather; and a more upbeat 7th Heaven (Live in Studio) and (Official Lyric Video) about her philosophy of life. The live in-studio videos were filmed in a sparse lounge-like setting. The official lyric videos contain the words to the songs with paintings by her grandmother Mery Zamani, some of which were printed onto the outfit Angelina wore on AGT. A third, more personal, Angelina Jordan – Million Miles (Official Music Video) was later released in Jan 27, 2021.\n\nPartnering with Stargate and Republic officially launched the career of this young teenage artist. She is now getting to create and produce her own material. There is no question this original artist will evolve into the international superstar she dreamed of becoming ever since she was 3!\n\nRECENTLY ADDED: Republic Records later produced and Angelina Jordan Official posted on July 15, 2021 a new video of Angelina Jordan singing 7th Heaven in a club setting with an audience. The story line includes a waitress listening to Angelina and the band rehearse, working in the kitchen dreaming of what her life could be, then at the live performance. It includes footage of her and Angelina horsing around in the kitchen. Very funny and cute.\n\nThe Barefoot Princess / Jazz Queen\n\nYou may have noticed that Angelina sings barefoot. There is a reason for that. While living abroad with her family in the Middle East she came upon a poor young girl, her own age at the time, around 6 years old. She was weighing people to earn money to feed her orphaned brothers and sisters. Angelina discovered this when she spoke to her. She also noticed that the girl was barefoot and had scars on her feet.\n\nAngelina asked her what she wanted to become. She replied, a doctor, but didn’t think it could happen. Angelina strongly told her to never give up her dreams. She took off her favorite green shoes and gave them to her. The girl resisted at first, then thanked her, and said she would pray every day for her to fulfill her dream to become a superstar and sing for the whole world. Angelina told the story in this Variety Media interview.\n\nSo, in honor of and inspired by that girl, Angelina always performs barefoot and still thinks of her, and the many homeless and shoeless children everywhere. Angelina actually went on to raise millions of Euros for children and families in need. Talk about putting yourself in other people’s shoes, or in this case, giving your shoes to someone in need! Angelina’s empathy and compassionate heart are expressed through her actions as well as her amazing voice!\n\nAngelina’s empathy and compassionate heart are expressed through her actions as well as her amazing voice!\n\nPublishes “Between Two Hearts“\n\nAt 9 years of age, Angelina became Norway’s youngest author when she published a book about this story. Between Two Hearts is illustrated by her grandmother Mery Zamani, herself a child prodigy who became a famous poet and painter at a very early age. Mery exposed Angelina to jazz before she could read or write, and is responsible for her desire to become a jazz singer. They create art together, and design and make her own clothing. Mery tapes the many videos of Angelina singing. She also paints the backdrops for some of them, including images in the animated sequence for the lyric version of Million Miles. Some of her images were made into clothing that Angelina wears, like the colorful pant suit she wore in her first appearance on AGT, when she sang Bohemian Rhapsody. See this short Angelina Jordan book release video.\n\nIn a Book Talk podcast posted by Angelina Jordan’s publisher, Cappelen Damm, in 2015, Erling Kittelsen, a Norwegian author and poet, and friend of the family, talks with Angelina about her book. When he was first shown her diary containing that episode with the barefoot girl, he said it should be made into a book. English subtitles have now been provided by her fan club. In between we hear excerpts of Angelina singing and small extracts from “Mellom to hjerter” (Between Two Hearts). It is very moving and gives us a glimpse into who Angelina really is. For her, “Love is very … Love means everything.” Angelina’s book has been translated into English and is available for purchase as an eBook on her website: https://www.angelinajordanofficial.com/book.\n\n(See a footnote below that I added after ordering and reading the eBook.)\n\nThe week her book came out, Angelina Jordan was interviewed by Anne Lindmo on the NRK TV show “Lindmo” (Nov 14, 2015). Ms. Lindmo asked Angelina to share the story of why she sings barefoot and to tell the story of how she met a poor barefoot girl when she was 6 years old. She then brings out Angelina’s actual diary for her to read what she wrote after that encounter with the girl. That Norwegian interview has now been translated with English subtitles. Click on the CC to watch it here. After the interview, Angelina sings Unchained Melody.\n\nThe whole family nourishes and supports Angelina in her career. In fact, her uncle is her manager, her mother handles publicity, and her grandmother is her stylist. They have been very protective of Angelina, wanting her to still enjoy her childhood and complete her education as she pursues her dream to become an international star. Throughout it all Angelina remains unpretentious and is happily focused on manifesting her musical destiny. In a reactor video, GEB Endeavors comments on how Angelina’s uncle became her manager and eventually paved the way for the family to move to LA to pursue her career in music. It’s happening!\n\nIt is interesting to note that instead of bowing when an audience applauds her, she curtsies. She always comes across as dignified yet humble, respectful and loving. A rare talent and a very special soul.\n\nRevealing insights into Angelina’s inner world\n\nWhen Angelina performs, she is in her element. She is calm and fearless. It is natural for her to powerfully project the emotional content of a song. She appears extroverted on stage, yet is in her own world. But ask her questions in an interview, and she gives short answers. She seems shy, introverted. She’s not comfortable expressing herself personally. However, it seems to be easier for her the older she gets.\n\nI think she may be an introvert by nature and inhabits a rich inner world. She comes from a deep place. We get a glimpse of that world when she sings, and are transformed by it. Here are a few hints I’ve noticed in some interviews.\n\nIn this 2016 Norway TV News Feature, Angelina tells the interviewer: “I want to sing for the whole world. Singing is as important as breathing to me. I just love to sing.” That says it all.\n\nI want to sing for the whole world. Singing is as important as breathing to me. I just love to sing. — Angelina Jordan\n\nAngelina is quite young in this interview when she said: “I close my eyes and go in a different world.” Her mother Sara said: “I came home one day when my mother looked after her. She was well eighteen months, and sang a Whitney Houston song in bed. I was almost shocked. It was so beautiful! We quickly realized that she had very great interest in music. It is she who is first and foremost musical in the family. Neither my husband nor I are particularly musical.” This video, Angelina Jordan – The Evolution, includes that clip of Angelina singing as a baby.\n\nI close my eyes and go in a different world.\n\nA young Angelina to an interviewer asking her about her singing.\n\nAngelina was 1 of 10 finalists in America’s Got Talent: The Champions 2020, and the winner was going to be announced that night. In this Short Interview from LA in Norwegian TV2 Monday Feb 17, 2020, the interviewer asks Angelina about the public’s response to her singing. She told the interviewer that “it’s absolutely incredible that there are so many people who send so many millions of messages,” and quoted a few.\n\nQ: How do you prevent this from getting to your head?\n\nA: I take it all in…and use it to spread love to everyone all over the world.\n\nI take it all in…and use it to spread love to everyone all over the world.\n\nAngelina Jordan’s response to a Norwegian reporter in LA asking her how she prevents all this attention from going to her head.\n\nOn Scandinavian TV, (Singer Angelina Jordan: – I don’t feel like a 12-year-old | SVT/TV 2/Skavlan) Skavlan asks Angelina some deep questions. Her answers are revealing!\n\nAt the start of the interview in Norwegian, Skavlan asks Angelina, “What do you find easiest: singing or speaking?”\n\nShe doesn’t hesitate to answer, “Singing and writing,” which is what you’d expect from an introvert. He confirms her answer by asking, “Singing and writing is easiest? Not speaking?” Smiling and chuckling, she shyly nods her head in agreement.\n\nThey then switch to speaking in English.\n\nQ: My first question is, when I see you on stage, I wonder, who do you feel that you become?\n\nA: When I sing I go to another world. In the world, it’s like, endless. It’s amazing. (smiles and laughs)\n\nQ: What do you mean by endless?\n\nA: Like, full of happiness, and, I love… It’s amazing!\n\nQ: Many people say that you don’t sound like a 12-year-old. Do you feel like a 12-year-old?\n\nA: I feel like a 12-year-old when I look at my passport.\n\nWhen I sing I go to another world. In the world, it’s like, endless. It’s amazing. … Like, full of happiness, and, I love … It’s amazing!\n\nAngelina Jordan answers Skavlan’s questions about what happens to her when she sings on stage.\n\nHe mentions a song that she’s written and will soon perform, and asks her what it’s about. She explains, “It’s about someone you love, wherever you are, it’s a strong love, protects you.”\n\nThe song sounds like a religious prayer, which could also serve as the theme song for a Bond movie. Skavlan said it reminded him of the Bond films and asks her if she’s familiar with them. She tells him that she got the inspiration for her song from the Bond films. He asks if she would sing a little bit of her favorite Bond song, and she does, acapela, Diamonds Are Forever.\n\nListen to her sing her song Shield with the band. It is powerful! Skavlan posted it Nov 12, 2018. There’s a video of her performing this song with a band in an open air concert the following year in Norway, Jul 12, 2019, when she was 13.\n\nDescribing her destiny\n\nIn this Feb 4, 2021 People (Magazine) article, Alyssa Johnson asks her: Where do you hope to see yourself in five years from now?\n\nA: I’ll have an important name in the music industry and to make timeless music that can live forever. Also to give the best music experience to people and for them to enjoy and feel emotional or dance or make memories with the music I make.\n\nI’ll have an important name in the music industry and to make timeless music that can live forever. Also to give the best music experience to people and for them to enjoy and feel emotional or dance or make memories with the music I make.\n\nAngelina Jordan’s answer to a People (Magazine) reporter asking her where she hopes to see herself in 5 years.\n\nAngelina is definitely following her bliss and manifesting her purpose in life! True to her name, Angelina Jordan Astar is an angel and a star sent here to fulfill her destiny and awaken a range of emotions in our hearts and touch our souls with her incredible voice!\n\nReacting to Angelina singing Cry Me A River, vocal coach Ceci Dover exclaimed in disbelief: “She can sing like this? This is impossible. Oh my gosh! She’s music. She’s jazz. She’s soul. Oh my gosh, I don’t know what to say. She’s amazing! That’s what I want to say.”\n\nIndeed! That about sums it up.\n\nAngelina Jordan’s social media, fan clubs, and overviews\n\nVisit her official site: Angelina Jordan, and her various social media accounts: YouTube and CoverChannel to see selected videos of her performing well-known songs, including some of her own; and follow her on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok.

In Rusty’s complimentary response to voice coach Julia Nilon‘s in-depth technical reaction to Angelina’s performance of “I Put A Spell On You” he gives her a comprehensive review of the young singer’s history that’s worth reading. In 2021 Rusty posted in alphabetically order The Complete Works of Angelina Jordan – All 132 Songs! (Every song as of Nov 2020)\n\nYouTuber, pa1189j, created a library of individual and mashup quality videos of Angelina Jordan.\n\nMy Time also created a great compilation of Angie’s Music +.\n\nYozhik v Tumane created Angelina Jordan – A Decade of Dedication (86 song medley) [1:04:47].\n\nAndy Schnell, another knowledgable fan, usually informs new reactors to Angelina’s music with a brief comprehensive history of her accomplishments.

Gary Rogers posted a long list of Angelina Jordan interviews, clips and everything else about her.\n\nIn this November 4, 2023 reaction video, Angelina Jordan Matures, Alan Papier posted a comment: I could not make a video like this without the help of this site listing virtually every AJ performance. A wonderful reference tool for AJ fans www.dimlylit.net/aja.\n\nFor news, visit Facebook Angelina Jordan Fan Club International.\n\nThis YouTube channel posts many personal videos usually from Grandma Mery’s TikTok: H S @HS-ol4zl.\n\nAdded footnote: I just bought and finished reading the eBook of Between Two Hearts. I was just as moved by her story and the way she tells it of why she sings barefoot as I am when I hear her sing, even more so. What an evolved soul for such a young girl! Through the eyes of a child, Angelina innocently makes us see and understand the suffering of a homeless little girl, and why she was moved to do something about it in her own small way. This was definitely a life-transforming experience for Angelina that continues today. (And probably for that homeless girl as well.) I understand why she went on to raise money for homeless families. If they publish a hardback copy in English, I would buy it again. Her grandmother’s childlike artwork adds a lot to the book.\n\nMore updates: On July 31, 2021, Angelina posted an original slowed-down, jazzed-up cover version of Michael Jackson’s Billie Jean. Check out the colorful sets. An amazing production! On August 26, 2021, she followed that up with a similar treatment of The Beatles song, Yesterday.\n\nOn October 14, 2021, after a 6-year absence, Adele posted her new song, Easy On Me. The next day, Angelina’s Fanclub posted a TikTok clip of her singing the song. The day after that Angelina premiered her amazing cover of the song: Angelina Jordan – Easy On Me (Adele Cover) Live From Studio! Republic Records produced the in-studio black and white video of Angelina at the mic with just her piano accompanist. Angelina pours her heart and soul into this song. Her voice continues to mature as well as her vocal dexterity. Surprisingly, she sounds even better! I posted a comment on the quality of the silence I felt at the end of the song. There have already been many videos posted on YouTube reacting to Angelina’s cover of Adele’s song. See this most effusive reaction from Adam Straughan.\n\nFriday, Dec 10, 2021, The Hating Game premiered in the USA. Republic Records released the original motion picture soundtrack and featured Angelina’s cover version of “Mercy” by Duffy to promote the film! You can listen on these music services: https://thehatinggame.lnk.to/OST.\n\nThursday, Dec 23, 2021, 3pm CST: Angelina Jordan Online Christmas Concert live from Los Angeles. Angelina closed out her concert with a stunning cover of You Say, a 2018 song by American contemporary Christian music singer and songwriter Lauren Daigle. Kaleidoscope RMX later published a beautiful virtual duet of Lauren Daigle featuring Angelina Jordan singing “You Say”.\n\nOn May 1, 2023, Ron Crans posted Angelina Jordan singing You Say for her fans to thank them for their support. Don’t know how long it will be up, but you can see it here. On June 8, 2023, Angelina Jordan Archives posted this song without the introduction.\n\nAngelina Jordan Archives later (Aug 10, 2023) posted Angelina Jordan – Bohemian Rhapsody (Christmas Concert Dec 23, 2021). On Dec 12, 2023, Joey Farr created a Christmas present for us. He animated and posted the first 5 songs from Angie’s 2021 Christmas concert. He then included the full concert to the end of the video with all the breaks removed. Angelina Jordan (joeyfarr1 Christmas Album) (UNEDITED) A Christmas present for everyone at the end. Scroll down to December 8, 2023 for Angelina’s new Christmas album and more songs from the concert posted there.\n\nAngelina Jordan turns 16\n\nJan 10, 2022: In honor of Angelina’s 16th birthday Pontus Österlin posted 16 Reactors 1st Time Hearing Angelina Jordan. Very amusing. Another great compilation from PO Talks in Sweden worth watching! BigAngieFan Chris Walker from Hawaii posted a wonderful compilation in the form of a quiz: Happy Birthday to Angelina Jordan! Can You Guess How Old She Is? I really enjoyed this musical mix by Kaleidoscope RMX: 🥳🥳🥳HAPPY BIRTHDAY ANGELINA JORDAN 🥳🥳🥳 👨‍👧\n\nValentine’s Day: Angelina posts the best version of My Funny Valentine! Remember when she sang it at 10 years old?\n\nApril 11, 2022: Written by Willie Nelson and popularized by Patsy Cline, listen to Angelina Jordan sing “Crazy” and you’ll go crazy for loving her!\n\nHonoring Elvis Presley\n\nJune 22, 2022: Angelina Jordan honors Elvis Presley a day before the release of Baz Luhrmann’s film, Elvis, singing a slow melancholy version of Suspicious Minds. The song was written by Memphis singer Mark James, an old friend of Elvis. When he heard the demo, Elvis told Mark he wanted the song and the female background vocalists. It went to #1 and relaunched his career.\n\nIn this video, Angelina wore a beehive hairdo like Priscilla, dressed in a black leather jumpsuit carrying a red guitar over her shoulder like Elvis in his televised ’68 Comeback Special. Rob Christie arranged the music and accompanied Angelina on piano. Rob’s red jumpsuit matches the guitar color and is what Elvis’ musicians wore in that ’68 Special.\n\nHer uncle and manager, Michael Astar, arranged everything. His two young daughters and Angelina’s sister Juliette make brief appearances in the video. Grandma Mery Zamani was the executive producer. Cole McCarthy directed the video in the same location that Angelina sang My Funny Valentine—an LA antique furniture and chandelier shop. This is an amazing performance and production!\n\nSummer Concerts in Norway\n\nJune 22, 2022, Allsang på Grensen\n\nAngelina will be performing at various venues in Norway this summer. At her first appearance she paid tribute to Freddie Mercury and Whitney Houston. She sang Bohemian Rhapsody in a vibrant red pant suit and I Have Nothing in a stunning ice blue gown, both televised by TV2 Norway. Angelina Jordan Vlogs captured part of Bohemian Rhapsody, and I Have Nothing twice from the actual event. They also posted excerpts from the other upcoming concerts. Phillip (pa1189j) later provided with the best audio version so far with a clean music intro.\n\nJuly 1, 2022, Kurbadhagen\n\nAngelina gave her own full concert at Kurbadhagen. Andy Schnell posted the playlist (14 songs + 3 encores). She looks so happy and relaxed in front of a live audience again. And her band swings. Instead of singing in one spot, she moves freely about the stage, and interacts with the audience in between songs—a new development for her, and us. The lucky fans are thrilled, and she’s loving it!\n\nBefore singing Amy Winehouse’s song, Tears Dry on Their Own, Angelina delivers her quintessential message: “I’m probably repeating myself but, the most important thing is just to be yourself, be kind to each other, and just be happy. That’s all that matters.” (Applause)\n\nAn audience member shouts out, “You make us happy.”\n\nVisibly moved, Angelina replies: “Oh, that means so much.”\n\nThe most important thing is just to be yourself, be kind to each other, and just be happy. That’s all that matters.\n\nAngelina Jordan to her concert audience at Kurbadhagen\n\nKathrine Angeltveit shared these songs, which were later blocked. But I saved this beautiful and succinct comment about Angelina Jordan posted by Shodan Rich after hearing her sing “Suspicious Minds”, the 3rd and final encore of the show.\n\nThis young woman continues to impress with her class, artistic talent, attention to detail, dedication and most important, her HUMILITY. NO top-rated singer that I have seen in my 66 years exudes the humility of this girl. Watch her at the end of all of her performances. Her eyes and facial expressions consistently say, “thank you for allowing me to be here and do what I love for you”. Watch her at the end of the AGT Champions performance of her stellar arrangement of Bohemian Rhapsody, in front of a roaring crowd, applause the likes of which I can’t remember ever hearing. Feet together, soft smile, hands folded in front of her. Her curtsy after this and her younger live performances. Her tribute to the divas of old, that literally raised her with their music, with her style hair, dress. No one, and I mean no one, embodies artistic passion like this emotionally empathic gift to the entertainment world. God bless you, Angelina. He has already blessed us with you.\n\nTheTomtomtom posted Bohemian Rhapsody and Yellow Brick Road, House of the Rising Sun, Mercy, Killing Me Softly and I’m Not the Only One.\n\nElin Men posted Bang Bang, Love on the Brain, Bad Romance, 7th Heaven, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, Suspicious Minds.\n\nMike Richards posted a video of concert photos taken by NiceShot.no.\n\nRusty Shackleford posted a video of House of the Rising Sun from Hege of “The Shield” fan group. He later posted a multi-cam video of Suspicious Minds that he created from footage provided by many members of the “The Shield” fan group.\n\nJuly 7, 2022, Kongsberg Jazz Festival\n\nRusty later posted a clip from Øyvind Skogstad of The Shield Fan Group of Angelina opening the concert with an amazing new cover of Labrinth’s Mount Everest. Rusty Shackleford later audio-corrected and video-edited Chris Walker’s 4K footage of Angelina surprising everyone with her version of Mount Everest, especially her falsetto riffing with the guitarist.\n\nKathrine posted a TV interview by NRK Dagsrevyen from that concert with Angelina singing a jazzy version of her song 7th Heaven. When asked how life is in the USA and if she is fully committed to the music, she replied: Yes, I am fully committed to music. Music is my life.\n\nI am fully committed to music. Music is my life.\n\nAngelina Jordan answering a NRK interviewer\n\nA month later, Kathrine posted Angelina Jordan on “Festivalsommer” at NRK TV the 6th of August, 2022. Her section of the Kongsberg Jazz Festival (7:45–17:20) opens with an interview followed by Angelina singing her original songs, 7th Heaven and Million Miles. Boris Palenovski later enhanced the audio-visual quality of this NRK TV feature to 4K.\n\nChris Walker, aka BigAngieFan, posted this sweet clip of Angelina interacting with her audience before singing Valerie telling them how happy she is to be back in Norway (after 3 years) to sing for them again. A month later Chris posted Angelina Jordan Live at Kongsberg 2022: “All of Me” and “Valerie” on The Hawaii Walkers Channel. And these too: “House of the Rising Sun” and “Killing Me Softly”. The closeup picture and sound are broadcast quality! Chris continues to add more songs, like “You Don’t Own Me”, and “Crazy” and “Mercy” with improved sound, and “Bang Bang”, followed by “Bohemian Rhapsody” & “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road”. He later added a translated Introduction, a Musical Intro, a brief talk by Angelina, and her singing “Mount Everest”, a song most were not familiar with. It blew them away! Angelina also performed the Amy Winehouse song “Tears Dry On Their Own”. Chris created a hybrid version of “7th Heaven” using NRK TV and fan footage. “I recorded about 25% of the video and sound myself, and the other 75% is from NRK TV.”\n\nAlan Papier posted The Kongsberg Concert Interviews with fans that came from around the world to listen to Angelina Jordan sing. He wrote: “Thousands of Angelina Jordan’s fans around the world wish they could have attended her recent concerts in Norway. In today’s video, we try and recreate the atmosphere from her concert at the Kongsberg Jazz Festival for those who could not attend.”\n\nJuly 10, 2022, Kurbadhagen, Sandefjord\n\nThere are several posts from this concert. Steinar Hatlen’s closeup recording of Angelina’s powerful rendition of her song, Million Miles was posted by The Shield. Angelina introduced the song saying it is very meaningful to her (about her grandpa) and wanted to share a special message about losing someone you loved: “I don’t want anyone of you to think that, you know, that they left you. They’re always going to be with you no matter where you are. So you’re never alone,” a reference to the repeated line, “I’m never alone,” in her song.\n\nKathrine posted the complete new cover version of Mount Everest, which opened the show, Killing Me Softly, Fly Me to the Moon, Mercy, You Don’t Own Me, Suspicious Minds, Bohemian Rhapsody, Yellow Brick Road, House of the Rising Sun, Tears Dry on Their Own, 7th Heaven, Love on the Brain, All of Me, Valerie, Crazy, Bang Bang, and a better quality video of Million Miles. From 4:40–4:50, Angelina’s voice kept soaring like never before. It surprised the audience, including the musicians. Thrilled, everyone applauded. Angelina gave them a little smile and kept on singing. I asked Kathrine what it must have felt like. Steve answered that he was only 10 feet away when she sang this – it was spine chilling. Geir Stian Aaslund described it as “a triple Angelina” moment and wrote: I almost fainted when I heard that part at the concert.\n\nKathrine posted I Have Nothing, which included Angelina’s introduction. “I want to dedicate this song to a very special person—my grandma. (Applause) She couldn’t personally come this time because as you guys know, she’s been sick, but she will be better soon. And I…I miss her so much. I miss every single second that I’m not with her. And…you guys enjoy.” That powerful song concluded the concert.\n\nMattias Axelsson recorded the Kurbadhagen concert in 4K. In his first video, he posted sound checks for At last and I Have Nothing, ending with visuals of people lined up to get in. He then posted all 18 songs in the order they were performed, starting with Mount Everest and ending with I Have Nothing. This seems to be a complete quality compilation.\n\nVidar Enerud also uploaded the Full Playlist of 15 songs plus 3 encores, including a poster listing them.\n\nThe Foot Crew posted the show in one video (1:05:51): Angelina Jordan consert Kurbadhagen in Sandefjord in Norway!! (It was insane). It’s further from the stage, but the sound from the large speaker array system is clearer.\n\nTomas Odebrant posted 5 rehearsals: (1) At last, (2-4) I Have Nothing, (5) Bang Bang. Hallvard Ulsaker filmed a closeup of Angelina singing I Have Nothing and Million Miles. Trond Andersen posted 11 songs so far. Geir Stian Aaslund posted Suspicious Minds, Bang Bang, Mercy, Valerie, Fly Me to the Moon, Yellow Brick Road, an excerpt of Million Miles including someone reacting to AJ’s unexpected high riff, and I Have Nothing, starting with her dedication to Grandma Mery.\n\nThe words to the song—I have nothing, nothing, nothing, if I don’t have you—are true on two levels—her grandma and her audience. Without Mery Zamani introducing Angelina to jazz at a very early age and lovingly supporting and recording her God-given talent—she, and we, would have nothing. And without devoted fans, a singer has nothing.\n\nAngelina’s career is all based on giving and receiving love. She even gave the heart sign twice while singing All of Me. The love and appreciation the audience showed Angelina moved her to tears, just as her love and singing did for them, and us.\n\nAs you could see from the videos, everyone on and off the stage was very happy. It was a huge lovefest.\n\nJuly 11, 2022: An Angelina Jordan Bonus Podcast Episode of Wrapped in a Warm Blanket with co-hosts Alan Papier and Pontus Österlin from Kurbadhagen in Sandefjord, Norway. Alan and Pontus finally met there in person and shared their reflections on Angelina’s concert. They also met Sara Astar, Angelina’s mother. Nice to see such dedicated AJ reactors and podcasters looking fulfilled after seeing and hearing Angelina sing in person. She created a magical atmosphere beyond their expectations.\n\nJuly 20, 2022: Angelina Jordan Kurbadhagen – The Sandefjord Concert Interviews.

Angelina just premiered this cover song in black and white, filmed at the same LA antique furniture and chandelier store where she sang My Funny Valentine and Suspicious Minds. This is 3 years after she had recorded her Whitney Houston tribute mentioned above. As great as that recording was back then, the depth and dexterity of her maturing voice now is absolutely phenomenal! And she is only 16 years old!\n\nAugust 18, 2022: Chris Walker later created a multi-camera edit of Angelina Jordan’s emotional performance of Elvis Presley’s song “Suspicious Minds” at Kurbadhagen, Norway, on July 10, 2022. The edit uses video shot by fans from five different angles.\n\nAugust 25, 2022: Rusty Shackleford later cleaned up and edited together footage from 4 fans’ cameras of Angelina’s powerful emotional version Million Miles at Kurbadhagen on July 10, 2022.\n\nSeptember 16, 2022: Boris Palenovski posted the September 13th visit of Jonathan “Sugarfoot” Moffett, Michael Jackson’s drummer since 1979, to a Republic Records studio especially to hear Angelina Jordan sing. Sitting cross-legged on the edge of a small stage, Angelina sang all of Whitney Houston’s “I Have Nothing”, (on Boris’ YouTube), and part of “Billie Jean” for him (on his and Angelina’s TikTok). He wrote: “You are SENSATIONAL!!!! ⭐️” and also answered someone’s comment with: “Why compare to Michael? This is her own version and tribute. And she sounds FANTASTIC!” He also told Angelina: “I can feel that it touched Michael’s spirit. You delivered, you delivered.” It touched her heart.\n\nOctober 22, 2022: Griseldis posted her 2nd portrait of Angelina Jordan. It is stunning! Done with black and white pencils and soft pastels on toned tan paper. Click the image to enlarge it and see how beautiful it is.

At the end of the video, Joey posted a composite photo of two selfies he had taken at different times—one with Sarah and one with Angelina.

We had a long animated conversation, and it was later edited down for Season Two, Episode 4: It’s All Mind – Meditating on Angelina Jordan with Ken Chawkin.

I want to make them happy and I want to sing for them.” When asked when she is hoping to do this, she replies: “Forever.” As we know, Angelina went on to do just that—sing to raise millions for such charities! In addition to her beautiful soul-stirring voice, she also has the heart of an angel, a saint!!\n\nFebruary 14, 2023: Released today. What a perfect Valentine’s Day gift!

Republic Records and Sony Music Nashville are among labels focusing on the teen set, as THR talks to the emerging artists in music’s next wave, from Ramón Vega to Luh Tyler to Angelina Jordan and more.\n\nJuly 10, 2023: The U.S. Sun: Entertainment: TV INTERNATIONAL STAR\n\nWho is former America’s Got Talent contestant Angelina Jordan? This is an overview by Jennifer Roback bringing readers up to date on what Angelina has been doing since her record-breaking appearance on AGT, dubbed ‘the greatest audition of all time’. Advance publicity for her soon-to-be-released EP of all new original songs.\n\nJuly 20, 2023: Angelina Jordan – Now I’m The Fool (Official Video)\n\nTonight Angelina was on her Angelina Jordan Official YouTube channel interacting with her Angels before releasing Now I’m The Fool. It was soon followed by the Lyric Video. Other songs on the EP, Old Enough, include Love Don’t Let Me Go (previously released), Fire And Rain, All My Fault, Good In Goodbyes, and Diamond. Angelina texted in the live chat: “​Much love, enjoy everyone! On Tuesday I will have a channel where we all can have a listen to the whole EP.” When Super Fan Andy Schnell submitted a question, “About how many songs have you written?” she replied that she chose the 5 songs on the EP from more than 100 she has written!\n\nJuly 21, 2023: This Friday her EP, Old Enough, is released.\n\nThe six-song EP, Old Enough, is available onSpotify, on YouTube where the first 2 songs include videos, and other online platforms listed at https://angelinajordan.lnk.to/oldenough. Everyone of these songs is a stunner and could easily be a Billboard Hot 100 hit! Whether based on reality or not—since Angelina is such a great storyteller—there seems to be an evolution in the sequential presentation of the songs pertaining to matters of the heart—from an abstract desire for love, to being a heart-broken hapless victim, to growing self-knowledge and self-love, to ultimate self-empowerment. Her attention to the light over the darkness is also unique and inspiring. It would be thrilling to see her sweep the Grammys with best new artist, best song, EP, and album (if released in time to qualify)!\n\nAugust 2, 2023: Live with Angelina Jordan ‘Old Enough’ Listening Party 7:00PM EST https://www.stationhead.com/angelinajordan. Apparently, due to copyright rules, she wasn’t able to stream the whole EP from the Republic Recording studio with her sister Juliette. Angelina Jordan fanverse posted two excerpts from the earlier livestream: Angelina Jordan IG Live Stream Parts 1 & 2. Maineology posted the full video in three parts 1, 2, 3.\n\nAugust 30, 2023: Angelina posted this video clip and comment on her Instagram: When your jamming with the legend behind this masterpiece @dianewarren ❤️ (Only Love Can Hurt Like This) I can’t believe this is happening❤️🥺🙏🏻.\n\nSeptember 14 & 15, 2023: Grandma Mery posted this earlier amazing video on TikTok (9/14) and Kaleidoscope RMX added the lyrics (9/15): 2020 – Angelina Jordan – “Dusk Till Dawn” (ZAYN ft Sia) -Piano version🎹 – 🎇Magic from a couch🥰.

Here are a few while they last: I Have Nothing, and part of Killing Me Softly with His Song.\n\nThe kicker from that concert was her take on Elvis Presley’s version of Unchained Melody, his favorite song, the last one he sang before his death. It was originally made famous by Bobby Hatfield of The Righteous Brothers, and became Britain’s Favourite Love Song.\n\nSpellbinding, her slowed down version put me into an immovable deep zone of marveled attention. That alone was worth the price of admission. Chris Walker (BigAngieFan) later posted a complete final version with new footage of Angelina Jordan’s stellar performance of “Unchained Melody”.\n\nAngelina has come a long way with this song. Here she is at 8 years old rehearsing Unchained Melody with Egil on guitar. As mentioned above, when Angelina was 9, she was interviewed by Anne Lindmo on NRK TV to talk about her book, Between Two Hearts. She was then invited to sing Unchained Melody. Listen to an improved 12-year-old Angelina Jordan singing Unchained Melody with sound remastered by Boris Palenovski.

On Oct 24, 2023, this video appeared on TikTok and YouTube: Angelina Jordan: “Unchained Melody” (recorded by Grandma Mery) at what appears to have been a private event. I posted a comment about it. On Dec 11, 2023, Angelina sang her moving rendition of Unchained Melody at 20:28 into the 1-hour Nobel Prize program, which was live-streamed to 350 million people in 100 countries. Boris Palenovski isolated the footage and posted it on his YouTube channel: Angelina Jordan (17) – KORK – Unchained Melody – Nobel Peace Prize – Narges Mohammadi tribute, NRK1.\n\nSee Chris Walker’s (BigAngieFan) Review: Angelina Jordan | First U.S. Concert, 9/22/23. I agree with his reasonable assessment of this American debut concert, including clear suggestions for improvement.\n\nSeptember 26, 2023: Steve Ackerman shared a beautiful story of Meeting Angelina Jordan. He and a small group of fans/angels waited around outside The Music Hall hoping to catch a glimpse of Angelina. He also shared a story from one of them, Patricia, who had flown in from Peru for the concert. She met Angelina and her family on the plane to LA. They recognized her and sent her treats from first class. Sara actually went to the back of the plane where she was sitting to talk with her!\n\nOctober 26, 2023: Republic Records, a division of United Music Group, (UMG) release Our Time. It reminds me of Angelina’s cover of Mercy for The Hating Game in December 10, 2021. Sounds like they’re wanting to attract a younger demographic with these more upbeat pop songs. Thanks to Steve Ackerman and Joey Farr for adding subtitles. Elsewhere, Made Laca commented that it “was used for a SoFi (Social Financial Inc.) commercial and their SoFi Stadium (70,000 seats!!) in Inglewood, CA.”\n\nOctober 30, 2023: Enjoy this beautiful pictorial montage Mike Richards put together with chronological musical selections of Angelina Jordan ~ ” Her Inspirations ” ~ (The re edited version).\n\nNovember 9, 2023: Angelina sang for and posted a photo with legendary director Steven Spielberg.

She begins about one minute in after a short introduction. Grandma Mery posted it on TikTok and later on YouTube Dec 17, 2023.

He was sitting in the front row center seat of the center section, which offered him a unique perspective. He decided to take out his phone and film it from his lap! He added, “I slowly angled it up at Angelina, who was already at an elevated position relative to my seat – the video that resulted is like no other.” See his later remix posted December 10, 2023.\n\nJames reacted to my comment on his video and then discovered my blogpost on Angelina which now included his wonderful video. In his reply he mentioned a video he had premiered the previous month, Oct 20, 2023: Angelina Jordan ‘SONG FOR A’ by Nico Cartosio with LYRICS w ‘MELTING’ Intro & Orchestral video. It’s a beautiful video and includes background information on how, when and where the recording came about. Classical composer Nico Cartosio had created this song specifically for Angelina Jordan. Song for A is based on a poem by Robert Burns, and is the only vocal on his instrumental debut album, Melting. Definitely worth listening to!\n\nNovember 22, 2023: Madame Le Figaro: Angelina Jordan, the “new Amy Winehouse” who will enchant the 2023 Debutante Ball.

Her twin son and daughter, who have been living in Paris with their father, came to Oslo to receive their mother’s Nobel Peace Prize and speak on her behalf. They were interviewed, along with their father, as part of the program.\n\nAngelina’s grandma Mery Zamani is from Iran and Angelina grew up in Oslo, home of the Nobel Prize. She won Norway’s Got Talent at 8 years old and sang to 17-year old Malala Yousafzai, the world’s youngest Nobel Peace Prize recipient in 2014! Now 17 herself, an international star, Angelina returned to Oslo to sing her moving rendition of Unchained Melody with the KORK orchestra. Appropriate for the occasion, this famous song is about a prisoner longing to be reunited with his love. It was first introduced in the 1955 prison film, Unchained.\n\nAngelina is introduced at 20:28 into the 1-hour Nobel Peace Prize program, which was live-streamed from NRK1 to 350 million people in 100 countries. I don’t know of any other artist who was invited twice to perform at a Nobel Peace Prize event.\n\nBoris Palenovski isolated the footage and posted Angelina Jordan (17) – KORK – Unchained Melody – Nobel Peace Prize – Narges Mohammadi tribute, NRK1. Listen closely to the violins between 1:59-2:22 and you’ll notice musical allusions to Pachelbel’s Canon in D.

He “applied some stabilization because the camera was pretty shaky and also adjusted the contrast, brightness, vibrancy and sharpness.” I had referenced this powerful performance earlier on, but it’s worth repeating here. Hard to believe Angelina was only 12 years old at the time. She is relaxed and happy on stage, but belts out the song like a seasoned pro!\n\nFebruary 13, 2024: Chris Walker, aka, BigAngieFan, created this short video to introduce Angelina Jordan to people who have no idea who she is or have just discovered her and what to know more.

Others posted many songs and later compiled them into playlists: AJ Playlists – by most2dot0, Knut Hegland, Merrilee Gaines, MegaBoogiemann, AngelinaJordanVegasFans, Hopediamonddeezy, and Joey Farr, which includes her thanking everyone for supporting her before concluding with Whitney Houston’s Somewhere in Time. Chris Walker (BigAngieFan) and a few others collaborated with James Thiel who is committed to producing the highest quality video recordings from the concerts. They were there and captured most of it together. James feels strongly that this is how Angelina deserves to be seen and heard to be fully appreciated, other than being there in person. I agree, and will list them in the order James posts them, not sung. He started with Angelina’s covers of Mariah Carey’s HERO, Adele’s WHEN WE WERE YOUNG, Duffy’s MERCY, Shirley Bassey’s Bond song DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER, Nancy Sinatra’s cover of Cher’s BANG BANG, then Angelina’s own arrangement of Elvis Presley’s version of SUSPICIOUS MINDS, Nina Simone’s FEELING GOOD, Adele’s ALL I ASK & (15 & 18 DUET LAS VEGAS & Official Video: 3yr Anniversary), Whitney Houston’s ONE MOMENT IN TIME (Notice the editing @4:13 in the video!), Elvis Presley’s CAN’T HELP FALLING IN LOVE. James later posted the debut of PRINCESS OF RUINS from the first show, followed by ONE MOMENT IN TIME from the second show. He later also posted a two-camera and audio production with the help of Wayne Denning of WHEN WE WERE YOUNG. They “were about 3 seats away from Center Stage in the Front Row, so we had nearly Equal (but opposite) viewing Angles; that is why the two images seem to be mirror images. Wayne’s video is static – no zoom. My video is mostly Zoomed 2x or more, so the two videos complement each other nicely.” James edited NOW I’M THE FOOL using his video plus three audio-visual files from Ken Gehl, Damien Poulain (megaboogieman), and Kenneth Macphee.\n\nJames later created a playlist of all 20 songs from LAS VEGAS, Feb 29, 2024 that he and Chris Walker produced under their partnership arrangement. James did 12, listed above, and Chris did 8 listed below.\n\nPrincess of Ruins (New song based on “Between Two Hearts”)\n\nAngelina also shared a new unreleased song she wrote, Princess of Ruins, based on the story of the orphaned girl she met when she was 6 and gave her shoes to, which she wrote about in her diary and later published in a book when she was 9, Between Two Hearts. Alan Papier combined them both into a video highlighting the story and song with images from the book painted by her grandma Mery Zamani.
