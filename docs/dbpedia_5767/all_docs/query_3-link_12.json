        "text": "Education around relationships, sex and health is now compulsory in primary, secondary and state funded schools across the UK. ​. The Department of Education has published statutory guidance to help schools as they make plans to incorporate these subjects.\n\nThe guidance includes specific instructions around mental health, and drug and alcohol education. Like us, the Government’s aim is that every pupil has a full and factual understanding of these issues, so that where possible they can make informed choices as they grow older.\n\nThe Government also recognises that providing effective education on such issues isn’t particularly simple and straightforward, and so schools are encouraged to bring in reputable organisations with specialist knowledge to enhance delivery.\n\nAfter working closely with the Amy Winehouse Foundation, 85% of teachers stated they were more confident in discussing alcohol and drug issues with their pupils. 82% felt they could identify vulnerable students and 77% felt able to refer students on to specialist support.\n\nIt’s why our Resilience Programme is exceptionally well placed to help you meet the DfE’s requirements. It can help you to effectively support your students, in a way that also supports you."
