        "text": "Amy Winehouse’s father, Mitch, has confirmed that plans are in motion for the late singer’s life story to be turned into a West End musical, featuring her own hit singles.\n\nThe production will celebrate Amy’s life and secure her legacy, with the singer passing away from alcohol poisoning in 2011 at the age of 27.\n\nSpeaking at the Amy Winehouse Foundation Gala last week, Mitch told The Sun: “A musical celebrating her life and music is being talked about for the near future.\n\n“It would be for the West End. We want to do something that remembers Amy for what she was, there’s so much more to her than just the drugs and the alcohol.\n\n“We want to do something positive about how she developed her music.”\n\nMitch added to the publication that he has given the production his go-ahead and that he’d “really like” to see it happen.\n\nAs well as Amy’s tumultuous personal life, which saw her battle with drink and drugs addiction as well as a difficult two-year marriage to Blake Fielder-Civil, the musical will no doubt focus on Amy’s incredible music career, which saw her win six Grammys, a Brit Award, and three Ivor Novellos.\n\nAlso at the Foundation’s gala dinner, Mitch told People magazine that he thinks about his late daughter “every minute of the day”, adding: “I don’t know why but this year her birthday hit me very hard.”\n\nThe star’s parents launched the Amy Winehouse Foundation after their daughter’s death six years ago, hoping to educate young people about the harmful effects of drugs and alcohol.\n\nLast October, the Foundation opened ‘Amy’s Place’ in East London, which provides female addicts with a safe space to transition into life after rehab.\n\nMitch previously said: “She was a really charitable girl, so we are really just continuing what she would have done.\n\n“Amy used to take people off the streets and feed them. Some of the paps used to chase her through the street and then she’d get into her house and she’d go ‘Dad I feel sorry for them’ because it would be freezing cold outside.\n\n“So she would make them all tea and sandwiches and go out and play football with them. Amy was just a very caring person.”"
