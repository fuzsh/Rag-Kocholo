        "text": "A photo showing Amy Winehouse as a young child at school has gone viral on social media, almost 13 years after the singer's death.\n\nThe British-born musician passed away in 2011 from accidental alcohol poisoning at the tragically young age of 27 years old. In the years since, fans have often shared their memories and favorite moments of the star.\n\nAn account on X, formerly Twitter, called @timecaptales responded to a viral video that showed Winehouse performing by sharing a snapshot of the star as a child.\n\nIn the photo, Winehouse was shown smiling broadly as she posed with her raven locks in two bunches. She was dressed in school uniform that consisted of a blue cardigan, white blouse and striped tie. According to the account, the photo was taken in 1991. At the time, Winehouse would have been around seven or eight years old.\n\nThe post, which as of press time had been viewed more than 360,000 times, attracted an influx of comments.\n\n\"OMG, she looked so joyful,\" wrote one X user.\n\n\"Love the smile,\" a fan commented, while another just said: \"Great photo!\"\n\nWinehouse attended Osidge Primary School in Southgate, north London. Winehouse's lifelong friend Juliette Ashby told Newsweek in 2021 that she instantly knew the future singer had something special about her when they met as four-year-old classmates.\n\n\"School was amazing for us. We loved every minute of it,\" recalled Ashby, who added that she saw star quality in Winehouse \"from the day I met her.\"\n\nWith Ashby also possessing singing and songwriting talents, the pair would form the rap duo Sweet & Sour as children.\n\nTheir interests while growing up together led to a shared home as the pair moved into an apartment in the suburbs of north London when they turned 18â€”soon after Winehouse landed her publishing deal.\n\n\"[Those were the] best days of our lives,\" said Ashby. \"Between us both cooking, writing and playing music day and night with our other best friend Lauren [Gilbert] and my sister, Jessica [Ashby].\n\n\"That flat...was probably the best times for us. Amy was writing her first album, Frank. I was recording and just getting my first writing job for a TV show in London. Life was good. We were very happy and loving our lives.\"\n\nAshby's interview with Newsweek was one of the few times she has publicly spoken about Winehouse since her death. She and her friend, Lauren Gilbert, were contributors to the 2015 documentary Amy, which scooped the 2016 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.\n\nAfter initial ambivalence about participating in the Asif Kapadia-directed film, Ashby said that she saw an opportunity to present her friend in a way that past headlines hadn't.\n\n\"For myself and Lauren we just wanted to contribute all the good videos and things about Amy from our lives for people to see,\" said Ashby. \"There are so many wonderful things about her and her personality that we wanted to share.\n\n\"For us it was about showing as much about who she really is to the world who may only know her for her talents and what they read/see in the media and TV.\"\n\nKnown for her jazz and soul-inspired sound, Winehouse attended the esteemed BRIT School for the performing arts in south London before launching her singing career in her late teens.\n\nShe shot to stardom in 2006 following the release of her second album, Back to Black. But as her fame soared, Winehouse began exhibiting unpredictable behavior. She was hounded by the paparazzi, becoming as well-known for her struggles with drugs and alcohol as for her voice."
