She would do abstract stuff, and I really loved it.\"\n\nDuring the episode, co-host Lennie Ware asked if Amy could act, to which Billie replied, \"Yeah, she could do everything. Super clever, super bright, (she was) unlike any other girl at that school.\"\n\nThe Scoop actress went on to share that the singer didn't have the \"easiest ride\" at school and was \"bullied\" for being different from her peers.\n\n\"She got bullied quite a lot at school because she was doing her own thing, and she liked to push buttons, and do weird stuff,\" Billie recalled. \"And I had a lot of space for that, but not many of the girls did. It wasn't the easiest ride.\"\n\nAmy earned critical and commercial acclaim for her Grammy Award-winning album Back to Black in 2006.\n\nAfter a battle with substance abuse and addiction, she died of alcohol poisoning in July 2011, aged 27."
