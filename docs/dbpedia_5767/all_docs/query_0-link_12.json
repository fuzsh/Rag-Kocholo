        "text": "The BRIT school in Bradford will help to create the stars of tomorrow with backing from industry leaders such as Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music and Warner Music.\n\nEducation Secretary Gillian Keegan said: “Whether on stage, on screen, or behind the scenes, the north is full of creative talent.”\n\nThe first BRIT school opened in Croydon in 1991, funded by the Government with backing from the British Record Industry Trust.\n\nIt was inspired by the movie Fame, which told the story of students at the High School of Performing Arts in New York.\n\nFormer pupil Adele has the best-selling album of the 21st century so far with 21, while Holland is one of the world’s most famous actors as the star of the Spider-Man films.\n\nOne of its latest stellar talents is Burns, a double BRIT award nominee this year. Other alumni include X-Factor winner Leona Lewis, pop star Jessie J and singer Katie Melua.\n\nIn total, former students have sold more than 250 million albums and won 15 BRIT Awards, with many more working behind the scenes in creative industries.\n\nAt the Bradford school, some 500 pupils aged 16 to 19 will study a curriculum including dance, music, theatre and production arts.\n\nIt is a free school, which means it is Government-funded but managed by an independent body, and ministers will this week set out plans for a new wave of free schools in some of the most disadvantaged areas in the country."
