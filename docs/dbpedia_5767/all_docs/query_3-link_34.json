Hughes and vocal starlet Savannah Brady in a one-night tribute to the one-night collaboration between Tony Bennett and Amy Winehouse. From London to New York, the paths of these iconic singers crossed for a historic recording session of American Songbook classics. Dr. Pete Carney directs this show, which promises a profound homage and a big band beating heart that was “left in San Francisco.”\n\nVisit scf.edu/music and check out SCF Music on Facebook."
