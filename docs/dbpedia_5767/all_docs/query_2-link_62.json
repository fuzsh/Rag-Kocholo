        "text": "Who was Amy Winehouse ?\n\nOral de Brevet\n\nMaunier Brihanna 3e5\n\nS U M M A R Y\n\nBiography\n\nThe beginning of her career\n\nA tragic end\n\nConclusion\n\nAmy Jade Winehouse\n\nAmy Jade Winehouse was born on September 14th,1983 in Southgate at London.In her family, everyone is fan of jazz, her grandmother Cynthia Winehouse was a cabaret singer.When Amy was 8 years old she start to take singing lessons.Unfortunately for her, her parents divorced because her mother discovered that her dad was leading a double life. After that, Amy will rebel against her mother.After that at the age of 15 years old, Amy is suffering of bulimia\n\nAmy went to the Sylvia Young Theatre School at the age of 12 years old.Amy was not a girl who follows the rules since she was a little girl,so when she went to this school, all the things that matters to her was writting and singing.She was coming late for lessons,her clothes were not adapted for school,etc... There's a rumor who said that Amy was drilling herself in class with thumbtacks.\n\nAnd as you can imagine, Amy got kicked out of the school.After that, she will go from school to school until she is 16 years old.At 16 years old,Amy decided to completely stop school.\n\nOnce upon a voice...\n\nOne night, Amy was in front of a bar named 'Jazz after dark'. She ask the barman ( Sam Shaker ) if she could enter because she didn't got money and he accepted.Amy was sitting in a table listening to the group playing,and after that she ask to Sam if she could sing in the scene.And he ask her if she know how to sing and Amy respond \"I sing for living\"So Sam accepted her request,and after Amy's performance he was amazed by her voice.And after that Amy was singing every night in the bar.\n\nAmy's finally singing like she wanted and have her first boyfriend.In 2002, with her bestfriend Tyler James, they will send a record to a label called \"Island Record\".When the label receive their record, they immediatly wanted to sign with her and she said yes.Her first song was 'Stronger than me'.In this song she talks about her first boyfriend.Her album 'Frank' was released in 2003,she choose 'Frank' because it was the favorite singer of her dad,Mitchell.In every song she writes, she's talking about every moments of her life.'Stronger Than Me' will win an Ivor Award\n\nPlay\n\nAfter that she get an appartment at Camden. One night Amy goes out to the Hawley Arms,and she met a guy named 'Blake Fielder Civil'. They fall in love with each other,they're always together as if they know each other forever. They even get a tatoo of each other's name\n\nAmy never though that she could feel this kind of love for someone.But the problem was Blake himself,because he's a toxicoman.And as you can imagine, he will initiate Amy to drugs and alcohol.After 6 months of relationship, Blake decide to breakup with Amy.Amy did'nt understand what was happening to her.She was in depression, she was drinking a lot of alcohol and was eating a lot of food.( remember that she was suffering of bulimia ).Her friends were worried so they suggest her to go to rehab. Amy tell them that she's fine,she doesn't need to go there,that she's just sad. That's how,later she will released 'Rehab' This sadness will create a lot of songs who will literally change her life...\n\nWatch\n\n'Back to Black' - 0:49-1:20\n\nBack to Black is the most famous song of Amy Winehouse.The song talks about Blake, her breakup with him, how she felt about it.That's how she will released her second album 'Back to Black' in 2006.The album will become a hit.And because of that, Blake come back to Amy and ask her if she wants to marry him, and obviously she said yes.\n\nAmy's now famous and married, will do interviews and concerts and now that Blake is back , she takes more and more drugs. But one day in August 2007 she will do an overdose of ; heroin,ectasy,cocaine,ketamine and alcohol.\n\nA Tragic End\n\nAmy goes to the hospital and Blake comes to visits her and gives her cocaine\n\nBlake will be arrested for an agression and Amy is very sad because she's alone...again.\n\nThe label tell her that if she doesn't get clean they will stop her career\n\nShe will replace drugs and alcohol with food.\n\nAmy is nominated for the Grammy Awards and she won 5 Grammys.But she was not happy of that because she was missing Blake and drugs.\n\nWatch\n\nin 2009, Blake is free, and ask the divorce.The problem is that they see each other secretly and she starts to take drugs again.But then she find a \"solution\" and she replace drugs with alcohol.Her concerts were catastrophic,she was forgetting lyrics and was aggressing the public.Her very last concert was in Belgrad.During 3 weeks, she will stop to drink.But then she restart to drink for 3 days in a row.On the 3rd day she dies of an alcohol overdose the 23rd July 2011.\n\nI think that her story is very sad because her career was begining very good and since she met Blake, he destroyed her . And the fact that she wanted to have a simple life is sad because she always wanted to be a mother...\n\nConclusion\n\nAmy was a very talented woman who just has the wrong person for her first love.But it's not only Blake's fault; we can blame the media for not just letting her in peace when she really needed help.\n\nR.I.P 23/07/2011"
