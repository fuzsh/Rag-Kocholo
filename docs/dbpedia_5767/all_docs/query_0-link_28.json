        "text": "BRIT School North will nurture the next generation of creative talent and provide exciting new opportunities for rising stars of the stage and screen, the Government has announced.\n\nThe new free school will be based on the award-winning performing arts BRIT School in South London, which has helped to launch the careers of some of Britain’s best-known artists and actors.\n\nCollectively, alumni from the school have sold more than 250 million albums and won 15 BRIT Awards, with many more working behind the scenes in creative industries.\n\nSupported by industry leaders such as Sony Music Entertainment UK, Universal Music UK and Warner Music UK, the new free school will be open to more than 500 16 to 19-year-olds who will have the opportunity to study a specialised creative curriculum, including subjects such as dance, music, theatre, and production arts.\n\nThe school is projected to open in 2026/2027.\n\nThe final site is still to be decided but it will be in a central location in Bradford.\n\nWest Yorkshire Mayor Tracy Brabin said: “This is a fantastic win for the north and supports our ambition to ensure opportunities for all, no matter where you’re from or where you live.\n\n“The build-up to Bradford UK City of Culture 2025 has already started to inspire the next generation of artists.\n\n“And now, with West Yorkshire becoming the home of BRIT School North, more young people can follow in the footsteps of our world-class homegrown artists, from the likes of Mel B and Corrine Bailey Rae to the Kaiser Chiefs.”\n\nBRIT School North will form part of the BPI Education Academy Trust (BEAT), supported by the BRIT School, Day One Trust, and East London Arts and Music.\n\nBradford was considered an ideal location for the new school and was selected after extensive work to identify somewhere that both delivered on ambitions to level up creative opportunities for underserved young people - and provided the right conditions for the specialist proposal in the wider creative ecosystem.\n\nBradford Council leader Susan Hinchcliffe said: “This is brilliant news for the Bradford district and will help cement our place as a creative powerhouse.\n\n\"There is a huge creative and cultural buzz around Bradford right now.\n\n\"We are preparing to be the UK’s City of Culture in 2025 and will soon celebrate the opening of Bradford Live, a new 4000-capacity live music venue in the old Odeon cinema.\n\n“I am delighted that the BPI has decided Bradford would be the perfect location for their new school.\n\n\"There is enormous talent in our young, energetic, diverse population and this can bring them life-changing opportunities.\n\n“It’s exciting to think about the future stars of music, art, film, TV and dance from our region. This school will help them to fulfil their dreams.”\n\nEducation Secretary Gillian Keegan said: “This announcement will mean more young people will be able to reach their potential and follow in their footsteps, at the new BRIT School in the north.\n\n“We are broadening opportunities so more of our children can access this springboard to success in the UK’s growing creative industries.”\n\nDr Jo Twist OBE, chief executive of BPI, added: “The UK is a world leader in music and across the creative industries and if we want this to continue, we must invest in talent and the highly transferable skills needed for a competitive economy.\n\n\"This school will not only focus on producing our next generation of performers, but crucially, train young people with the important technical qualities needed for our industries to thrive and provide them with opportunities that they otherwise might not be able to access.”\n\nCulture Secretary Lucy Frazer said: “For more than thirty years, the BRIT School has been nurturing the next generation of creative talent - producing some of the most influential and successful performers and artists of our time.\n\n\"The new school in Bradford will give even more young people the opportunity to develop their skills and maximise their potential, while creating a pipeline of talent for our thriving creative industries.”"
