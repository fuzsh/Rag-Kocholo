        "text": "NEW YORK — The parents of late singer Amy Winehouse officially launched the U.S. branch of a foundation named for their daughter at New York’s Joe’s Pub, where the embattled pop star made her American debut five years ago.\n\nThe Amy Winehouse Foundation – aimed at assisting disadvantaged youth – raised $1 million dollars in the United Kingdom, Mitch Winehouse said at Wednesday night’s event.\n\nHe says in the United States the organization will focus on children “without access to music education and music therapy.” The family announced a donation of $10,000 to the New Orleans Jazz Orchestra.\n\nMitch Winehouse said he spoke to his daughter through a psychic Tuesday, saying that she “is fully behind everything that we’re doing and she’s up in heaven waving her magic wand.”\n\nMitch Winehouse was joined by Amy’s mother, Janis, and her younger brother, Alex. He performed four songs with a jazz band, at one point kissing his cellphone which had a photo of his daughter on it.\n\nHe’ll release a book about his relationship with his daughter, who died of accidental alcohol poisoning on July 23 at her London home. It’s titled “Amy, My Daughter” and will be released on June 26. All proceeds will benefit the foundation, he said.\n\nThe organization also announced the Amy Winehouse Inspiration Awards and Gala, to be held on Sept. 10 in New York.\n\n—-\n\nOnline:\n\nhttps://www.amywinehousefoundation.org/\n\n—-\n\nMesfin Fekadu covers entertainment for The Associated Press.
