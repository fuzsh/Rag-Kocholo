        "text": "Amy Winehouse, an English singer and songwriter, was a notable personality in the music industry. She left an indelible mark with her distinct voice and soulful compositions. Winehouse was born on September 14, 1983, in London. She was introduced to jazz music at a young age by her uncles, both of whom were professional jazz musicians. This early exposure played a significant role in shaping her musical style and preference for jazz. Winehouse attended the Sylvia Young Theatre School and later the BRIT School, where she honed her talent and laid the groundwork for her future career. Winehouse's debut album, Frank, released in 2003, immediately established her as a rising star in the UK music scene. The album was critically acclaimed, fusing elements of jazz, pop, soul, and hip-hop that showcased her unique vocal style and songwriting prowess. Her breakthrough, however, came with her second album, Back to Black, in 2006. This album, featuring hits such as Rehab and You Know I'm No Good, resonated with audiences worldwide and catapulted her to international fame. Back to Black earned her five Grammy Awards in 2008, making Winehouse the first British woman to win five Grammys in one night. Despite her meteoric rise to stardom, Winehouse battled personal issues throughout her career, most notably struggles with substance abuse and mental health. Her life and career were cut tragically short when she died on July 23, 2011, at the age of 27.

The album spawned the UK and New Zealand number-one single \"What Took You So Long?\", as well as the top five singles \"What I Am\" and \"Take My Breath Away\" and the top 20 single \"We're Not Gonna Sleep Tonight\". Bunton's second studio album, Free Me, was released in February 2004 through 19 Entertainment. Four singles were taken from it: \"Free Me\", \"Maybe\", \"I'll Be There\" and \"Crickets Sing for Anamaria\".
