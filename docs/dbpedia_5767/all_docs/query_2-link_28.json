        "text": "It has an incredible reputation for turning talented pupils into stars but did you realise just how many famous names were taught at Croydon's famous BRIT School?\n\nToday we look at some of the most famous pupils to have benefitted from learning their trades at the school.\n\n1. Adele\n\nArguably the most famous name to come out of the BRIT School. The singer/songwriter's first album,19, earned rave reviews but her second album, 21, took things to a whole new level, as it is the fourth best selling album in UK history and earned her a record-tying six Grammy awards in 2012.\n\nThe singer, whose real name is Adele Laurie Blue Adkins (we bet you didn't know that), then released her third album, 25, which became the fastest selling album in UK history with over 800,000 copies sold in its first week while it has since sold 20 million copies.\n\n2. Amy Winehouse\n\nThe singer was known for her distinctive voice and her second Album, Back To Black, won her five Grammy awards in 2008 with singles like Rehab and You Know I'm No Good.\n\nShe tragically died of alcohol poisoning in 2011 aged just 27, which led the album to become, for a while, the best selling album of the 21st century.\n\n3. Jessie J\n\nThe 28-year-old BRIT school graduate rose to fame in 2011 with her first single Do It Like A Dude. Her next track was also a huge success as Price Tag topped the charts in 19 different countries.\n\nShe has collaborated with artists like Nicki Minaj, Mary J. Blige and David Guetta and has also been a judge on BBC One singing talent show The Voice.\n\n4. Leona Lewis\n\nThe British singer won the third series of The X Factor and won a record contract with Simon Cowell's record label Syco music.\n\nShe released her debut album Spirit in 2007 and saw the single Bleeding Love go to number one in over 30 countries.\n\n5. Tom Holland\n\nActor Tom only left the BRIT School in the last five years but has already starred in 2012 film The Impossible as well as playing Spider-Man in Captain America: Civil War.\n\nThe actor, who has also starred in Billy Elliot the Musical, is set to take up the role of Spider-Man again in the 2017 film Spider-Man: Homecoming.\n\n6. Katy B\n\nThe singer/songwriter, whose full name is Kathleen Anne Brien, has teamed up with some of the biggest names in the business, such as Tinie Tempah and Mark Ronson.\n\nThe musician, who released her latest album Honey in April, thought about becoming a teacher before making her name in the music industry.\n\nLast October she recorded her first number one single, provided the lyrics for the hit Turn The Music Louder (Rumble).\n\n7. Blake Harrison and Emily Head\n\nThe pair are best known for playing Neil Sutherland and Carli D'Amato in sitcom The Inbetweeneers. The show that made the nation laugh was on our TV screens between 2008 and 2010 and has been followed up by two films following the end of series three.\n\nBlake has also appeared in the remake of Dad's Army while Emily currently plays Rebecca White in ITV show Emmerdale.\n\n8. Rizzle Kicks\n\nHarley Sylvester and Jordan Stephens both attended the BRIT School and became a duo in 2008.\n\nThey have entered the UK charts with singles like Down With The Trumpets, Mama Do The Hump and You Need Me, I Don't Need You.\n\n9. The Kooks\n\nFounding members Paul Garred, Luke Pritchard and Hugh Harris all attended the BRIT School and the three later met fellow band member Max Rafferty.\n\nThe rock band released their debut album Inside In/Inside Out in 2006 and they were named Best UK & Ireland Act at the MTV Europe Music Awards in the same year.\n\nThey have since released three more albums, with the latest being Listen in 2014 which debuted at number 16 in the UK Albums Chart.\n\n10. Bashy\n\nThe musician and actor's songs Black Boys and Kidulthood To Adulthood caught the eye of those in the industry and he was named Most Inspirational Artist at the 2008 Urban Music Awards.\n\nHis real name is Ashley Thomas, and he has also featured in films Adulthood, Shank and, most recently, Brotherhood.\n\n11. Ella Eyre\n\nIn 2013, Ella worked with drum and base band Rudimental, rapper Wiz Khalifa and singer Tinie Tempah.\n\nIn 2015 the singer, whose real name is Ella McMahon, was named Best Female at the MOBO Awards after songs like Gravity, Together and Good Time entered the UK charts."
