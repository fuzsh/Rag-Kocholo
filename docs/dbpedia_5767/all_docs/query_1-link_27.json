        "text": "Hidden in the basement of a Pizza Express on the Kings Road, you will find ‘The Pheasantry’, a swanky jazz club where stars such as Lou Reed and Amy Winehouse have performed. I was lucky enough to be invited to such a venue by Margot Antignac, a recent UCL graduate, and her band The Swing of Delight for an evening of jazz classics and a preview of upcoming singles from Margot’s debut album, as well as co-compositions by Simon Pires (musical director and bassist). Having graduated in 2022 with a degree in Comparative Literature, Margot was eager to share how she had come to choose such a vocation and how her experience at UCL, inadvertently or not, had helped her navigate her incredibly compelling career in the arts.\n\nAs I descended the stairs of the pizzeria, I was welcomed by the vibrance of red velvet carpets and the warm glow of cabaret lamps. The stage was first christened by three women, also known as The Velvets, who were clad in various glittery garments. The trio set the tone for the evening with a rendition of \"I'm In Heaven,\" and I myself was convinced. After briefly being led to the afterlife by The Velvets, it was time for Margot and The Swing of Delight to take centre stage…\n\nDescending the stairs in a sequin dress and cowboy boots, lead singer Margot, with a look of quiet confidence, had the air of having been in the jazz business for decades, not a mere 2 years! Commencing with jazz classics such as “Cheek To Cheek”, it wasn’t long before Margot soon tried out some new material with her eager audience. These songs confronted themes such as personal growth and self-discovery, which were perfectly complemented by Margot’s incredibly mature and rounded vocals. The Swing of Delight band, riffing when the song allowed and restraining their groove when necessary, equally complemented Margot’s melodic tone, leaving the audience wanting more. Yet, before the show was quite over, The Velvets snuck on stage to join the band in singing Margot \"Happy Birthday.\" The Marilyn Monroe-esque performance was a sultry end to an evening of musical delights. However, Margot was kind enough to speak to me after the performance and reveal some details about her journey in the industry and time at university.\n\nPerhaps what remained most striking was Margot’s unconventional introduction to the scene. After a spirited evening spent in Soho at a random jazz club, Margot joked with the club's owner about performing a song, and to her amazement, he agreed. Despite trying out for Jazz and Musical Theatre Society at UCL, it was a serendipitous evening in Soho that led to Margot’s professional pursuit of jazz. In response to questions surrounding her navigation of the industry, Margot made it clear “to surround yourself with those greater than you,” expressing that it was the only way she progressed. While it may be tempting to stick with those around you, Margot highlighted the need to progress individually. Simon Pires, the bassist and musical director, has been in the industry for years and was one of the “greats'' that Margot was previously referring to. Having performed in a plethora of clubs over the years, directing his band The Swing of Delight, and assisting with the arrangements of Margot's upcoming songs, it is fair to say that Pires is a maestro when it comes to the music.\n\nWhat both artists demonstrated and made clear was that their intrinsic passion for the industry inevitably led to opportunities. While Margot’s formal education would usually lead to a career in linguistics or teaching, for example, her interest in music and jazz ensured that she did not settle. And, if her performance was anything to go by, I’m sure she will have a fruitful career ahead of her. I, for one, will be returning to The Pheasantry!"
