        "text": "If you're judging based on vocal ability then obviously there is no doubt that any winehouse is better.\n\nIf you're judging based on creativity, then there are hundreds and thousands of musicians doing the same thing as Taylor Swift. So her music is boring. If you hear the same song over and over again your ears eventually get tired. All her songs and the songs of the hundreds of others like her had made her style of music really boring.\n\nThere are not many like amy winehouse. It sounds different and that's what's fun about listening to her. Sure there are other jazz/R&B musicians that may have a similar style but Amy winehouses music still sounds different from there's because she uses her voice creatively.\n\nThat being said, i don't think the defense is necessary because it seems like a tr0ll thread and everyone defending Taylor Swift is clearly tr0lling. I have yet to hear people confidently claim that Taylor Swift is more talented without feeling the need to justify it further."
