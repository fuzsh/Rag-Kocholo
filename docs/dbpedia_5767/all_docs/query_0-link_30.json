        "text": "The government has approved major plans to create a northern campus of London’s acclaimed BRIT School in Bradford.\n\nThe next Amy Winehouse, Loyle Carner or Adele could soon be honing their craft in West Yorkshire as plans for a northern base of Croydon’s world-renowned BRIT School have been backed by the government. It’s now all stations go on the project, which will bring the specialist creative and performing arts college in Bradford in 2026-27. Once open, it will welcome 500 students aged 16 to 19 to study performance, production and digital subjects in an immersive environment.\n\nThe new school has been proposed and will be run by the British Phonographic Industry, the trade body for the recorded music industry in the UK known as BPI. It aims to provide a platform for talented young musicians and performers from the north to realise their dreams with access to this free-to-attend school. They’ve chosen Bradford because of its commitment to providing creative opportunities for young people and because of its ability to help open up the pathways into creative industries for its students.\n\nThe announcement comes at an exciting time for culture in Bradford. The city’s cultural economy is growing year after year, and will continue to do so – the multi-million-pound transformation of the former Odeon cinema into a live music venue for over 3,000 punters will be completed next year. The plans for Bradford’s year as the UK City of Culture in 2025 are also in full swing and the school will be a major part of its legacy commitment and the city’s 10-year cultural strategy.\n\nThe Brit School North is a project with the full support of Mayor of West Yorkshire, Tracy Brabin, “This is a fantastic win for the North and supports our ambition to ensure opportunities for all, no matter where you’re from or where you live.” She told us, “the build up to Bradford UK City of Culture 2025 has already started to inspire the next generation of artists. And now, with West Yorkshire becoming the home of BRIT School North, more young people can follow in the footsteps of our world-class homegrown artists, from the likes of Mel B and Corinne Bailey Rae to the Kaiser Chiefs.”\n\nThe world-renowned BRIT School opened in 1991 as an innovative education pathway for talented musicians, actors, dancers and performers. Its success stories can be seen all over the entertainment industry. The institution has helped nurture a wide array of talent, including Spiderman actor Tom Holland, chart-topping singer Raye and renowned jazz artist Katie Melua, in addition to global superstars like Amy Winehouse and Adele.\n\nBut the BRIT School North won’t just create stars of the screen and stage, it will help train students to who want to work behind the scenes too and give them opportunities they wouldn’t normally come across. Alongside Performing Arts courses, the London BRIT School currently teaches a broad curriculum that includes Creative Arts subjects as diverse as Film & Media Production, Interactive Digital Design, Production Arts, Visual Arts & Design.\n\nThe school is a collaboration between the BPI and record labels Sony Music Entertainment UK, Universal Music UK and Warner Music UK, alongside the BRIT School, East London Arts & Music and the Day One Trust. The three record companies involved have committed to provide additional funding to purchase state-of-the-art equipment, while other collaborations will be announced that will give students direct links into the industry.\n\nZayn Malik, the Bradford-born former One Direction singer, has backed the project, “I am passionate and excited about the potential of the planned BRIT school. Growing up in Bradford without many resources, I know first-hand the struggle and what a life changing difference this would directly make for these young people. There is immense talent in Bradford and the surrounding areas, so to have an accessible resource like this school will change the lives of these emerging creative artists.”\n\nThe final location for the BRIT School North in Bradford will be confirmed in the coming months, but one thing’s for sure, it’s another big step in helping to redress the balance in arts and creative opportunities between the north and south, much like the recent arrival of EMI North, a new subsidiary label of EMI based in Leeds to find northern artists. Oh, and don’t bet against the stars of tomorrow calling Bradford home in the near future and maybe even singing, “They tried to make me go to Bradford, I said, ‘yes, yes, yes’…”\n\nThe BRIT School North will open in central Bradford in 2026 or 2027."
