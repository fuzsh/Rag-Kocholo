The Iranian government, it seems. Recent years have seen a dramatic rise in the number of Iranian girls enrolling in universities and other institutions of higher education. While many governments would see this as a blessing worth boasting about,&nbsp;that's not the case in Iran.\n\nIn a report to the administration of President Mahmud Ahmadinejad, Iran’s Research Center of the Majlis (parliament) recently called the trend of more girls going to universities \"alarming\" and urged the government to stop it.\n\n\"With the door of opportunity closed to most young girls, with all the control their families and others exert over them, young women are mostly going after knowledge and science to gain freedom and human dignity.\"\n\n'Worrisome' Trend\n\nThe research center documented what it called a worrisome rise in the number of females to enroll in universities and other centers of higher education. The report said that over the last two decades there’s been a 23 percent increase in the number of girls taking university entrance exams, with the number of girls who passed the tests nearly doubling -- to 65 percent -- over the same period.\n\nThe influential research center -- which has decision-making powers in both parliament as well as in government agencies -- also warned that the rise in female students could eventually lead to \"social disparity and economic and cultural imbalances between men and women.\"\n\nBut others see society as the problem, not women's desire to seek higher education.\n\n\"If such concern [about more women going to universities] is being expressed, then it’s because our society is not ready to accept that a woman could be more educated than a man,\" said Elahe Hejazi, a university professor in Tehran. She tells RFE/RL’s Radio Farda that the report reflects both traditional gender discrimination as well as despair among young males about their prospects in life. She calls it a \"cultural problem.\"\n\n\"Our culture is preserved in its traditional form, but the more important problem in our society is that boys have no motivation for continuing their education,\" she said.\n\nDetrimental Or Good?\n\nThe report says the rise in female students has created other concerns, such as \"securing university dorms and maintaining their [girls] physical security in confronting possible social perils.\" Another problem, according to the report, is economic, \"such as the possibility that expenses will be underused for specialized skills, as well as a change in the gender of the workforce.\"\n\nThe center's report also warns about a detrimental affect on families and urges officials to swiftly find a solution to the \"disproportion between the number of men and women\" in Iran’s universities.\n\nShahla Shafigh, an Iranian-born women’s rights activist in Paris, tells Radio Farda that she believes the opposition to female students is ideological.\n\n\"With the door of opportunity closed to most young girls, with all the control their families and others exert over them, young women are mostly going after knowledge and science to gain freedom and human dignity,\" Shafigh says. \"And this is a good thing to happen in a country.\"\n\nBut what steps the government might take in regards to the situation is unclear.\n\nLast year, after reports that the government might limit female enrollment in entrance exams, women’s rights activists in Iran expressed concern. The government later denied that there had ever been any such plans.\n\nBut there are signs the government intends to act on the gender issue, including recent media reports suggesting there could be a change in textbooks based on \"gender differentiation.\"\n\nLast week, Zohre Tabibzadeh Nouri, who runs the government's office of Women’s Participation, told reporters in Tehran that \"gender discrimination\" will be implemented in certain sectors of the workforce. She added that the government must help women attain the kind of education and expertise suitable for them.\n\n(Fereidoun Zarnegar of Radio Farda contributed to this report.)\n\nRFE/RL Iran Report\n\nRFE/RL Iran Report\n\nSUBSCRIBE For regular news and analysis on Iran by e-mail, subscribe to \"RFE/RL Iran Report.\"\n\nThe Revolutionary Court of Isfahan has acquitted Toomaj Salehi, an Iranian rapper who was sentenced to death over his protest songs against the Islamic republic.\n\nSalehi’s lawyer said the court that heard his client's case in 2022 on the charge of \"corruption on Earth\" issued the ruling on August 14.\n\nAmir Raesian said on X that Branch 5 of the Revolutionary Court of Isfahan had issued a verdict of acquittal in the case.\n\nHe added that the court also \"issued a suspension of the prosecution order on other charges” and sent two charges of publishing computer lies and disturbing order to Criminal Court 2 with a “disqualification order.”\n\nSalehi was sentenced to death by the Revolutionary Court in May on the \"corruption on Earth” charge, but the Supreme Court overturned the punishment and referred the case to a parallel branch of the Revolutionary Court for reconsideration.\n\nSalehi was serving a six-year prison sentence for his involvement in the 2022 protests that rocked Iran when he was sentenced to death on the \"corruption on Earth” charge.\n\nSalehi was initially arrested in October 2022 after making public statements in support of the protests that followed the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who died while in police custody for allegedly wearing her head scarf improperly.\n\nSalehi gained prominence for lyrics that rail against corruption, widespread poverty, executions, and the killing of protesters in Iran. His songs also point to a widening gap between ordinary Iranians and the country's leadership, accusing the authorities of \"suffocating\" the people without regard for their well-being.\n\nAfter spending much of his pretrial detention in solitary confinement, he was sentenced to six years in prison but released in November 2023 on appeal after the Supreme Court found \"flaws in the original sentence.\" But he was arrested with \"beatings\" only 12 days later after a video describing his torture in prison was published.\n\nIn a letter published in late May, Amnesty International said Salehi had been tortured and beaten repeatedly during his detention.\n\nIran has kept the world on edge since it promised to strike Israel more than two weeks ago -- a move experts say could plunge the region into an all-out war.\n\nThe promised attack by Islamic republic is meant as retaliation for the July 31 killing in Tehran of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of the U.S.- and EU-designated Palestinian terrorist group Hamas.\n\nSupreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said after the assassination that Iran was \"duty-bound\" to avenge its \"guest.\"\n\nAn Iranian attack has been \"imminent\" for the past two weeks, and this anticipation has led to frequent bouts of hysteria on social media predicting an attack by Iran and its allies -- including Lebanese militant group Hizballah -- within hours.\n\n\"I think they really enjoy that: watching Israel stuck in this waiting period, paying a heavy economic and psychological price,\" said Raz Zimmt, a senior researcher at

stress to the home front, the military mobilization, and even the economic consequences, will not be limited to Israel, but also affect Iran and Lebanon,\" warned Michael Horowitz, head of intelligence at the Bahrain-based Le Beck International consultancy.\n\nWhy The Wait?\n\nAnalysts said the idea Iran is delaying its retaliation because it is relishing the psychological impact it is having is more of an excuse than a proper strategy.\n\nThey agreed intense domestic debates, the complexity of coordinating with proxies, and assessing the risks associated with an attack have all contributed to Iran's hesitation.\n\nZimmt said Iran is \"facing a major dilemma\" because while Khamenei and the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) want to restore Iran's deterrence vis-a-vis Israel, there are elements in Iran that worry a large-scale attack could drag Iran into a war with Israel and maybe even the United States.\n\nEven if a decision on how to respond to Haniyeh's killing has been made, coordinating with Hizballah and other members of the so-called axis of resistance -- Tehran's loosely knit network of regional state and nonstate allies and proxies -- is a time-consuming process.\n\nAnother factor likely affecting Iran's decision-making is the United States beefing up its military presence in the region more than it did in April ahead of Iran's unprecedented drone and missile attack against Israel.\n\n\"We're seeing a bigger response [from the United States] than in April, which is probably meant to match the scope of the threat, as Iran may carry out a larger response than the one in April,\" Horowitz said.\n\n\"The message [from the United States] in sending both defensive assets -- but also potentially offensive ones -- is one of deterrence and perhaps the only kind of message that does truly matter at this stage.\"\n\nCan Diplomacy Prevail?\n\nTehran has rebuffed calls by Western nations to show restraint, insisting it has a legitimate right to respond to Israel's killing of Haniyeh on Iranian territory.\n\nStill, the flurry of phone calls made to new President Masud Pezeshkian and acting Foreign Minister Ali Baqeri-Kani have raised speculation that attempts at diplomacy have helped delay an attack and could potentially stave it off.\n\n\"I am skeptical that diplomacy, on its own, is enough to truly change the Iranian calculus,\" Horowitz said. \"Iran will do what it feels is in its best interest, regardless of the calls and statements urging restraint.\"\n\nBut Iran has suggested a different kind of diplomacy could convince it to at least \"delay\" its promised attack: a permanent cease-fire in Gaza between Israel and Hamas.\n\nFarzan Sabet, senior research associate at the Geneva Graduate Institute, speculated Iran \"may be looking for off-ramps\" to justify a toned-down response, and some kind of Gaza cease-fire could be just the \"diplomatic victory\" it needs to do that.\n\nZimmt said a Gaza cease-fire may not be important to Iran but it does provide Tehran with \"an excuse or an explanation to legitimize this delay, both internally and mostly externally.\"\n\nHe said a cease-fire could lead to Iran either reducing the scale of its attack or choosing a different method of retaliation altogether that does not involve a direct strike on Israel.\n\nNo Good Options\n\nIt remains a mystery when and how Iran is going to respond, but as things stand Tehran does not seem to have any good options.\n\n\"Decision-makers in Tehran may have vacillated in finding a 'Goldilocks' option,\" Sabet said.\n\nThat, he explained, is Iran's conundrum to deliver \"a retaliatory strike that is not so weak as to have little symbolic or deterrent value, but not so strong as to cause an uncontrolled cycle of escalation that leads to a larger war.\"\n\nTehran is effectively left with either a weak response or one that crosses the threshold of war.\n\nBoth options \"entail significant risks,\" Horowitz said, \"either for Iran's regional projection power or the risks Iran could take if it crosses a line and is hit back in return.\"\n\nIran on August 13 rejected Western calls to renounce its threat to retaliate against Israel following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of the EU- and U.S.-designated Palestinian terrorist group Hamas.\n\nHaniyeh was killed along with his personal bodyguard in Tehran on July 31 as he visited the Iranian capital for the swearing-in of President Masud Pezeshkian.\n\nIsrael hasn't confirmed or denied carrying out the attack.\n\nIran, Hamas's main backer, blames Israel for the killing of Haniyeh and has vowed revenge, raising fears of a wider war in the region.\n\nIranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani said in a statement that \"such a request lacks political logic, flies in the face of the principles and rules of international law, and constitutes public and practical support\" for Israel.\n\nReuters quoted on August 13 three senior Iranian officials as saying that only a cease-fire deal in Gaza stemming from talks expected to take place in the coming days would hold Iran back from direct retaliation against Israel.\n\nIsrael started an air and ground offensive in Gaza after Hamas fighters surged across the border into southern Israel on October 7, killing some 1,200 people and taking more than 250 people hostage. Israel’s action has killed more than 38,900 people in the Gaza Strip, according to health officials from Hamas.\n\nAccording to one of the officials who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, Iran, along with allies such as Hizballah, would launch a direct attack if the Gaza talks, which are due to begin on August 15 in either Egypt or Qatar, fail or if it perceives Israel is dragging out negotiations. A cease-fire in Gaza, on the other hand, would give Iran cover for a smaller \"symbolic\" response, one of Reuters' sources said.\n\nHis statement came after the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy called on Iran on August 12 to \"stand down its ongoing threats of a military attack against Israel.\"\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also held phone calls with Pezeshkian the same day.\n\nStarmer asked Pezeshkian to refrain from attacking Israel and said that war was not in anyone's interest, his office said. Starmer told Pezeshkian he was deeply concerned by the situation in the Middle East and called on all parties to de-escalate to avoid further regional confrontation.\n\n\"There was a serious risk of miscalculation and now was the time for calm and careful consideration,\" Starmer was quoted as saying, adding that he had underlined his commitment to an immediate cease-fire, the release of all hostages, and increasing humanitarian aid to Gaza.\n\nFollowing the call with Starmer, the Iranian president was quoted by the official IRNA news agency as saying that war anywhere in the world was in no one's interest but that states had the right to \"punitive responses against an aggressor.\"\n\nScholz also called on Pezeshkian to prevent further military escalation in the Middle East. \"The spiral of violence in the Middle East must now be broken,\" Scholz told Pezeshkian, according to a German government statement.\n\nThe United States on August 12 said it agreed with intelligence assessments that Iran and/or its proxies in the Middle East could \"attack Israel as early as this week.\" U.S. national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters that President Joe Biden had spoken to leaders of key Western allies to discuss the situation.\n\nWestern diplomats have scrambled to avert a major conflagration in the Middle East, where tensions were already high due to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nIsrael's air and ground offensive has killed more than 38,900 people in the Gaza Strip, according to health officials from Hamas.\n\nIsrael launched its action after Hamas fighters surged across the border into southern Israel on October 7, killing some 1,200 people and taking more than 250 people hostage.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters, AFP, and dpa\n\nYahya Sinwar, the alleged architect of the deadly October 7 attack on Israel and surprise appointment as the new leader of the U.S.- and EU-designated terror group Hamas, is known to have close ties to Iran.\n\nHis appointment on August 6 as the head of the Palestinian group's political bureau followed the assassination of his predecessor, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran on July 31, an act that Iran and Hamas blame on Israel.\n\nFollowing the death of Haniyeh, who had strong relations with Iranian officials, the most prominent names to be considered as his successor were Khaled Meshaal, a former politburo chief of Hamas, and Khalil al-Hayya, a prominent figure within the bureau with close ties to Haniyeh.\n\nThe appointment of Sinwar, who has been the Hamas chief in Gaza since 2017, came as a big surprise because many did not take into account the Iran factor, analysts say.\n\n\"None of us experts on Palestinian affairs -- especially here in Israel -- thought about Sinwar as the person who would replace Haniyeh,\" said Yohanan Tzoreff, a senior researcher at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies who specializes in Israeli-Palestinian relations.\n\n\"One [major] reason why Sinwar is the [new] leader is Iran,\" he added.\n\nSinwar was appointed after two days of deliberations in Qatar by the Shura Council -- a consultative body that elects the group's politburo and has members in Gaza, the West Bank, Israeli prisons, and the Palestinian diaspora.\n\nTzoreff said Meshaal's criticism during the 2011 Arab Spring of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad -- a close ally of Tehran -- made him a deeply unpopular figure among Iran's top brass.\n\nTzoreff argued that Mashaal's return to power could have jeopardized the Palestinian group's relations with the Islamic republic and \"[the Iranians] may have stopped giving Hamas everything it needs [to fight Israeli forces].\"\n\nBut Sinwar is reportedly stuck in Gaza, where he has been in hiding since the start of the war with Israel in October 2023. The constraints on his movement and restricted ability to communicate with the world mean Sinwar is very limited in what he can do.\n\n\"I don’t expect him or Hamas to become closer to Iran. At this point, the relationship will likely stay the same,\" said Joost Hiltermann, the Middle East and North Africa Program director at the Belgium-based International Crisis Group.\n\nMolded By Israeli Prisons\n\nAlso known by his supporters as Abu Ibrahim, the 61-year-old Sinwar was born in the Khan Younis refugee camp in Gaza. His parents, like Haniyeh's, fled the coastal town of Ashkelon during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War that resulted in the establishment of the state of Israel -- or what Palestinians call the \"nakba\" (catastrophe).\n\nSinwar joined Hamas shortly after it was formed in 1987 and set up its feared internal security organization, Al-Majd, whose main purpose was to find Israeli spies within the group. He gained a reputation for violence and was nicknamed the \"Butcher of Khan Younis.\"\n\nSinwar was captured by Israeli forces and sentenced to multiple life terms for a variety of offenses -- including the killing of two Israeli soldiers -- and spent more than two decades in prison.\n\n\"He is a guy who was hardened in Israeli prisons, like many longtime Palestinian ex-prisoners,\" Hiltermann said.\n\nHe said Sinwar learned Hebrew while in prison and, crucially, this helped him to learn how Israeli leaders think.\n\n\"Sinwar's really tough. He is ruthless. He is very much a leader in the mold of any Israeli leader,\" Hiltermann said.\n\nWhile in prison, Sinwar organized strikes to improve working conditions and emerged as a leader among incarcerated Palestinians.\n\nHis experience in prison \"prepared him very well for the leadership of Hamas\" and in planning the October 7 attack, Hiltermann said.\n\nNearly 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed when Hamas militants raided communities in south Israel in October and took hostages back to Gaza. The attack prompted Israel to launch a major offensive in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, which Palestinian sources say has killed more than 40,000 people.\n\nSinwar was released from prison in 2011 as part of an exchange that saw more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners freed in return for one Israeli soldier held by Hamas. Soon after his release, Sinwar accompanied Haniyeh on a trip to Tehran where he met Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nThe same day Sinwar was announced as Haniyeh's successor on August 6, Khamenei's account on X posted a short video of that visit showing Sinwar meeting with the Iranian leader in February 2012.\n\nHamas's Message\n\nTraditionally, Hamas's political bureau chief is based abroad so he can travel and maintain contact with regional allies, such as Iran and the Lebanese Islamic militant group Hizballah.\n\nBut Sinwar, who U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken once joked is \"buried 10 stories underground\" in Gaza, is unable to leave the enclave because of the war.\n\nTzoreff said that, by appointing a Gaza-based leader, Hamas was \"sending a very strong message\" to both Israel and Arab states that \"the resistance of Hamas has not collapsed.\"\n\n\"The main message is that nobody can push them out of the area,\" he added.\n\nSinwar himself may not be keen on leaving Gaza, because his legitimacy is based on his being in the enclave.\n\n\"If Sinwar were to leave Gaza, Palestinians would say he is abandoning them, like a captain leaving the ship,\" Hiltermann said.\n\nSinwar has been in Israel's sights since the beginning of the war, with army spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari describing him as a \"dead man\" following the October attack.\n\nKilling Sinwar remains a priority for the Israeli army.\n\nChief Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi vowed on August 7 that his troops would target Sinwar and force Hamas to \"replace the head of the political bureau again.\"\n\nThe United States on August 12 said it agrees with intelligence assessments that Iran and/or its proxies in the Middle East could “attack Israel as early as this week” and it urged Tehran to “stand down” with regard its ongoing threats.\n\nU.S. national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters that President Joe Biden had spoken to leaders of key Western allies to discuss the situation and said Washington takes seriously reports that Iran could soon attack Israel in retaliation for the killing of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of the EU- and U.S.-designated Palestinian terrorist group Hamas, in Tehran on July 31.\n\nIran blames Israel for the killing of Haniyeh and has vowed revenge, raising fears of a wider war in the region.\n\n“We have to be prepared for what could be a significant set of attacks, which is why, again, we have increased our force posture capabilities in the region even in just the last few days,” Kirby said.\n\n“We've got significant force capabilities in the region. We've changed some of that posture in just the last few days. The president is confident that we have the capability available to us to help defend Israel,” Kirby added.\n\nThe Pentagon has bolstered its forces in the Middle East amid the mounting tensions as Washington reiterated its support for long-standing ally Israel.\n\nIn a joint statement later with Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, the White House said: “We expressed our support for the defense of Israel against Iranian aggression and against attacks by Iran-backed terrorist groups.\"\n\n“We called on Iran to stand down its ongoing threats of a military attack against Israel and discussed the serious consequences for regional security should such an attack take place,” the statement added.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer urged Iranian President Masud Pezeshkian in separate phone calls to avoid escalation of military tensions in the region, their offices said. Washington does not have diplomatic relations with Tehran.\n\nFollowing the call with Scholz, the Iranian president was quoted by the official IRNA news agency as saying that, \"while Iran welcomes the expansion of interactions with all countries and stresses the need for resolving problems through negotiations, it will not give in to pressure, sanctions, bullying, and aggression.\"\n\n\"Rather,\" he added, \"it considers it a right to respond to aggressors based on international rules.\"\n\nThe Western allies' joint statement also said they “expressed our full support for ongoing efforts to de-escalate tensions and reach a cease-fire and hostage release deal in Gaza.\"\n\nIt said the group endorsed the joint call by Biden, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, and Amir Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani of Qatar “to renew talks later this week with an aim to concluding the deal as soon as possible, and stressed there is no further time to lose.”\n\n“All parties must live up to their responsibilities. In addition, unfettered delivery and distribution of aid is needed,” it said.\n\nIsrael's air and ground offensive has killed more than 38,900 people in the Gaza Strip, according to health officials from Hamas.\n\nIsrael launched its action after Hamas extremists surged across the border into southern Israel on October 7, killing some 1,200 people and taking more than 250 people hostage.\n\nWashington has warned Tehran of “swift and severe” consequences if reports that it is planning to send hundreds of ballistic missiles to Russia are confirmed.\n\nWe are prepared to deliver a swift and severe response if Iran were to move forward with the transfer of ballistic missiles, which would, in our view, represent a dramatic escalation in Iran's support for Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine,\" State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters on August 12.\n\nThe warning matches one issued by the United States earlier this year after Reuters -- citing six unidentified sources -- reported that Iran had shipped a “large number” of powerful surface-to-surface ballistic weapons to Russia.\n\nThe United States and the European Union have imposed sanctions on Iran's ballistic missile program over concerns Tehran could send such weapons to its Middle East allies and proxies and to Russia for use in Ukraine.\n\nRussia has suffered from weapons shortages as its full-scale invasion of Ukraine – launched in February 2022 – has dragged on with heavy losses of troops and military hardware, leaving it to look to allies such as Iran and North Korea to replenish its arms stock.\n\nOn February 22, the U.S. administration also warned Iran of a \"swift and severe\" response from the international community if Tehran provided ballistic missiles to Russia,\n\nNational-security spokesman John Kirby said at the time that Washington had yet to confirm the missiles had been transferred by Iran to Russia, but he said the move appeared likely.\n\n\"In this press reporting, the Iranians are clearly indicating that they will ship ballistic missiles to Russia, and we have no reason to believe they will not follow through,\" Kirby said.\n\nTehran has been providing Russia with unmanned aerial vehicles or drones, guided aerial bombs, and artillery ammunition, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials following widespread evidence of Iran-made Shahed drones causing damage and casualties in Ukraine, leading to additional Western sanctions.\n\n\"Iranian officials also continue to deny providing any UAVs [unmanned arial systems] to Russia when evidence is plain for the world to see that Russia has used these UAVs in relentless attacks against the civilian population in Ukraine, against civilian infrastructure,\" Patel told reporters.\n\nNewly elected Iranian President Masud Pezeshkian, considered by many to be a reformist leader, has spoken of hopes of improving relations with the West, but Patel expressed skepticism.\n\n\"This duplicity is only the latest reminder to the international community that the Iranian regime lacks in credibility,\" he said.\n\nIn January, the State Department issued a similar warning against North Korea in a joint statement with the European Union and dozens of others countries, including many in Asia.\n\n“The transfer of these weapons increases the suffering of the Ukrainian people, supports Russia’s war of aggression, and undermines the global non-proliferation regime,” it said on January 9.\n\nWith reporting by AFP and Reuters\n\nJailed Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi and other women inmates in Tehran's Evin prison were injured earlier this week in clashes that erupted after a spate of executions, Mohammadi’s family says.\n\nMohammadi’s husband, Taghi Rahmani, said Mohammadi suffered breathing problems and severe chest pain after being punched in the chest and was transferred to the prison's clinic.\n\nRahmani, who spoke by phone to RFE/RL from Paris, said several women came under attack by guards during the clashes on August 6. Mohammadi was hit in her chest, and her arm was bruised, he said.\n\nThe injured women were later taken to the prison clinic for treatment and were returned to their ward.\n\nRahmani said the news agency of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps claimed the clash was a riot, but he said it should be made clear that it was a protest in which the women in Evin prison chanted in the prison yard against the death penalty.\n\nHe added that he and the rest of Mohammadi’s family were worried about her health especially because she was hit in the chest. Mohammadi had surgery for blocked arteries in 2022.\n\nRahmani added that Mohammadi, who is renowned as a staunch advocate for the Women, Life, Freedom movement, cannot contact her sister in Iran and she hasn’t been allowed to contact her children for 2 1/2 years. She also has had no contact with her lawyer.\n\n\"These restrictions make all of us worried about her situation in that ward where other women are also facing difficult conditions,\" Rahmani told RFE/RL.\n\nBefore Rahmani spoke with RFE/RL, Mohammadi's family issued a statement about the clash on August 8. It said several women who stood in front of the security forces were severely beaten.\n\nIt said the women in Evin prison had been actively protesting against executions in Iran, and following the execution of Reza Rasaei, several prisoners gathered in the prison yard to voice their dissent, chanting slogans against the death penalty.\n\nOne woman suffered a nervous breakdown and passed out and another prisoner also fainted from the emotional strain, the statement said, adding that Mohammadi and several other prisoners protested against the locked doors that were preventing the critically ill inmates from being taken to the prison clinic.\n\nIranian authorities acknowledged a confrontation took place on August 6 but blamed Mohammadi for a \"provocation\" and denied any of the prisoners had been beaten.\n\nTwo prisoners \"had heart palpitations due to the stress,\" but medical examinations determined that their general condition \"is favorable,\" Iran's prison administration said in a statement, according to the Tasnim news agency.\n\nMohammadi, 52, has been campaigning for human rights in Iran for decades and has been in and out of prison for the last 20 years. She has been convicted five times since March 2021 and is currently serving a 12-year prison sentence for \"spreading propaganda\" against the Islamic republic.\n\nThe executions that took place this week drew outrage from rights groups. The Norway-based Iran Human Rights group said 29 people were executed at two prisons in the Tehran satellite city of Karaj on August 7 alone.\n\nRasaei, 34, was the 10th man executed by Iran in connection with the \"Women, Life, Freedom\" protests that erupted after the death of a woman in police custody. The Iranian judiciary said Rasaei was executed on August 6.\n\nWith reporting by AFP\n\nRussia and Iran have both seen their international standing diminish in recent years. And as each seeks a way to boost their military and diplomatic influence, Africa looks like a land of opportunity.\n\nThere are no signs that Moscow and Tehran, whose bilateral ties have become closer as they each try to counter punitive international sanctions, are working in lockstep in Africa.\n\nBut their aims in the continent often align, and experts say the two are each attempting to capitalize on similar situations, including political instability, war, and apathy toward the influence of Western powers.\n\n\"Both Iran and Russia, what they see in Africa is an opportunity to break their diplomatic isolation,\" said Cameron Hudson, fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \"They have been isolated by the West, financially, politically -- essentially branded as pariah states. And so, in Africa, they see 54 opportunities to break that status.\"\n\nRussia and Iran have stepped up their engagement with African states, some of which are wary of the West and open to finding alternative trade and investment partners. Tehran and Moscow are notably active in places of conflict, such as West Africa and the Sahel, where juntas have made clear that Western forces are not welcome.\n\nHudson said Moscow's and Tehran’s involvement in Africa also has the \"ancillary benefit of thumbing their nose\" at the Western states behind the crippling international sanctions imposed on them.\n\nThe sanctions -- imposed over Russia's war in Ukraine and Iran's controversial nuclear program, among other things -- have effectively cut both Russia and Iran off from the global financial system and harmed their lucrative trade in arms and oil.\n\nNew Avenues\n\nBy opening new avenues of trade and influence in Africa, Moscow and Tehran can show that the attempts to isolate and punish them \"is only marginally successful, and that they can build coalitions of states who support their interests,\" Hudson said.\n\nThe two countries see Africa as \"a battleground where they can supplant the West and better position themselves economically, politically, and even militarily for prolonged tension with the West,\" said Liam Karr, an analyst with the American Enterprise Institute's Critical Threats Project.\n\nKarr noted that Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger -- former French colonies in the central Sahel where anti-Western military juntas have taken power -- \"have increased cooperation with Iran and Russia as they distanced themselves from France.\"\n\nThe situation has already led to the expulsion of French troops from Niger and Mali. U.S. forces battling Islamist insurgents in the region have withdrawn from Niger's capital, Niamey, and will completely leave the country by September.\n\nThe rapidly changing landscape has led to some uncomfortable situations, such as when Russian troops backing Niger's junta were deployed in May to an air base housing U.S. soldiers.\n\nBoth Iran and Russia \"use military engagement to 'get their foot in the door' with unstable or other isolated countries to pursue greater economic and political cooperation,\" Karr explained. Such military engagement, he added, also \"allows them to use limited resources to threaten critical waterways, such as the Mediterranean and the Red Sea.\"\n\n'Opportunity In Chaos'\n\nMoscow's influence is marked by high-level political engagement, business dealings including arms sales, and the ubiquitous presence of pro-Kremlin mercenaries in conflict areas.\n\n\"Russia finds opportunity in chaos. And so, when there is political instability in a country, when there is a kind of organic rejection of the West, which we have seen in a lot of states in Africa that view the West as a kind of neocolonial actor, then that creates openings and opportunities for Russia to come in with its narrative,\" Hudson said.\n\nRussia's military footprint is also the most hazardous, as evidenced by the deaths of scores of Russian Wagner mercenaries in fighting against Tuareg separatists linked to the Al-Qaeda terrorist network in Mali last month.\n\nIran is playing catch-up to its Russian ally, working to expand its influence on the continent through trade ties, arms sales, and the use of proxies and militant partners as part of its \"axis of resistance\" against Israel and the West in general.\n\nIn West Africa, Iran has reached out to the trio of juntas in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. In Nigeria, Tehran has established a proxy group called the Islamic Movement of Nigeria, which functions like other proxies and partners.\n\nTehran has also used proxies to make its presence felt across the Sahel to the Horn of Africa, allowing it to put more pressure on regional adversaries, primarily Israel.\n\n'Aligned Interests'\n\nIran's and Russia's interest in Africa sometimes overlaps, as is the case in Niger and in Sudan, where both are playing a role in the yearlong civil war between the Sudanese military and rebel forces.\n\n\"Sudan is a clear area where they both have military interests. Iran and Russia have both offered military support to the Sudanese Armed Forces hoping to secure a military base on Sudan’s Red Sea coast that would enable them to improve their military posture in the area vis-à-vis the West,\" Karr said. \"Iran has offered drones, whereas Russia has offered 'unrestricted qualitative military aid.'\"\n\nJuntas that have taken power in Mali and Niger, meanwhile, are looking to Moscow and Tehran to fortify their positions.\n\n\"They certainly lack legitimacy in the West and among international institutions, and so building relations to Iran or to Russia helps them build legitimacy, because all of a sudden they look like state actors,\" Hudson said. \"They look like they're doing the trade and diplomacy that a legitimate government would do.\"\n\nBoth Karr and Hudson say there are no clear signs that Russia and Iran are coordinating their strategies in Africa.\n\nKarr said that \"similar aims and methods mean that most of their efforts mutually reinforce each other,\" while Hudson noted \"a set of aligned interests, but not interests that are being explicitly coordinated.\"\n\nAutocracies around the world have become increasingly mutually reinforcing in their competition with democratic societies, Pulitzer Prize winning U.S. journalist and historian Anne Applebaum said in an interview with Current Time.\n\n\"Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe, Azerbaijan, and Angola don't have a common ideology,\" Applebaum said. \"But they have places where they can cooperate and common interests. And some of their interests are financial.\"\n\n\"The Chinese invest in autocratic regimes all over the world and help prop them up,\" she added. \"The Russians do the same…. They offer mercenaries to dictators in Africa who are in trouble. They look for areas where they have something in common and where they can help one another.\"\n\n\"They don't need a common ideology to do that,\" Applebaum said.\n\nIn her new book, Autocracy, Inc.: The Dictators Who Want To Rule The World, Applebaum writes that such governments are undergirded by \"sophisticated networks composed of kleptocratic financial structures, surveillance technologies, and professional propagandists, all of which cooperate across multiple regimes,\" the book argues, according to the author's website.\n\nApplebaum told Current Time this is a fundamental difference from the geopolitical situation in the 20th century, \"when there was a thing called the communist bloc and they all used the same language…and they even had very similar political and social systems.\"\n\nDespite the lack of a centralizing ideology, the world's autocracies share a \"common enemy,\" she noted.\n\n\"The common enemy is…anybody who lives in the democratic world and anybody who uses the language of democracy…of human rights, transparency, accountability, the rule of law, justice,\" Applebaum said. \"That language is threatening to them and, of course, it is most threatening to them when it comes from their own opposition movements and their own internal critics and…dissidents.\"\n\nIn addition, freed from ideology, modern authoritarian regimes have much greater scope to influence political and social developments in open societies.\n\n\"Authoritarian propaganda can now reach people in the United States in a way that communist propaganda could not,\" Applebaum said. \"The money that autocratic states have gives them a kind of power that, again, the Soviet Union never had, whether it's to invest as investors, whether it's to buy influence among politicians or…the business community, whether its even in the form of dark money to fund political campaigns.\"\n\n\"All those things give them more tools to influence the internal debates and political conversations of democracies, as well as their economies, than they used to have,\" she added.\n\nMedia outlets like the Kremlin's RT network, Applebaum added, \"turned out to be good at…crafting an authoritarian narrative that described autocracies as safe and secure and stable, and democracies as divided, chaotic, and degenerate.\"\n\n\"And some version of that, in millions of forms, is now available on the Internet,\" she said. \"And that…chimed with a part of the American political spectrum that is…feeling disgruntled, that doesn't like social change, demographic change, economic change, and political change over the last couple of decades and is seeking to reverse it.\"\n\nAuthoritarian regimes did not cause the \"backlash against democracy\" in the United States and other democratic countries, \"but they helped give it language,\" she said. \"They make existing divisions deeper.\"\n\nNonetheless, these regimes understand that democratic values and language remain in demand. In Venezuela, for instance, people have taken to the streets to call for transparency, justice, and the rule of law despite the country's \"really ugly dictatorship.\"\n\n\"People want to live in a society where there's rule of law, where judges are real judges,\" Applebaum told Current Time, a Russian-language TV and digital network run by RFE/RL. \"I think you can see this in a lot of places. It's about the innate appeal of the idea of living in a more fair society where citizens have some influence.\"\n\n\"I think this one of the reasons why the autocratic world has, if you will, rearmed itself or has girded itself against the democratic world in a much more dramatic way than it did two decades ago,\" Applebaum said.\n\nWritten by RFE/RL's Robert Coalson based on reporting by Current Time correspondent Ksenia Sokolyanskaya.\n\nIran executed 36 people on August 6-7, including 26 in a group execution in one prison, a rights group said on August 7, a day after Tehran faced international condemnation for executing an Iranian activist arrested during the \"Women, Life, Freedom\" protests.\n\nThe Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR) group said 26 men, including two Afghan nationals, were executed in a group hanging in Ghezelhesar prison in Karaj outside Tehran.\n\nIHR said that a group execution on this scale in Iran was unprecedented, with the last comparable example dating back to 2009.\n\nThose executed had been convicted of murder as well as drug-related and rape charges, according to both IHR and the Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI).\n\nHuman rights groups have repeatedly accused Iran of making use of the death penalty to instill fear in society in the wake of the 2022 protests that swept the country after the death of Mahsa Amini in police custody.\n\n\"Without an immediate response from the international community, hundreds of individuals could become victims of the Islamic republic's killing machine in the coming months,\" IHR director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam said.\n\nIn addition to the 26 men executed at Ghezelhesar prison, three other men were executed in Karaj's city prison, one man was executed in Sabsevar in Khorasan Razavi Province, three were executed in Shiraz in Fars Province, and three were executed in Badar Abbas in Hormozgan Province, according to the CHRI.\n\n“These are only the known executions; there are often additional executions that take place without public knowledge,” the organization said in a news release.\n\nReza Rasaei, 34, was the 10th man executed by Iran in connection with the \"Women, Life, Freedom\" protests that erupted in September 2022 after the death of Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd who was arrested for an alleged breach of the country's strict dress code for women.\n\nRasaei, a member of the Kurdish ethnic minority and follower of the Yarsan faith, was convicted in connection with the death of an officer for the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) during unrest in the Kurdish city of Sahneh. He denied the charges.\n\nAmnesty International said he was executed in secret with neither his family nor his lawyer being given prior notice. It said his family was then forced to bury his body in a remote area far from his home.\n\n\"Iranian authorities have carried out the abhorrent arbitrary execution in secret of a young man who was subjected to torture and other ill-treatment in detention...and then sentenced to death after a sham trial,\" said Diana Eltahawy, Amnesty International's deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nShe said the execution was another instance of Iran using the death penalty as a \"tool of political repression to instill fear among the population.\"\n\nFrance's Foreign Ministry on August 7 condemned Rasaei's execution and reiterated its \"unchanging opposition to the death penalty in all places and circumstances,\" calling it an \"unfair and inhumane punishment.\"\n\nIHR said Iran has now executed at least 345 people this year and there has been no let-up in the use of the death penalty since reformist President Masud Pezeshkian was sworn in last week.\n\nWith reporting by AFP"
