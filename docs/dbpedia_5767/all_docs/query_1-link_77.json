        "text": "\"Bring in Austin Butler.\"\n\nDirector Sam Taylor-Johnson defended the upcoming Amy Winehouse biopic Back to Black after new waves of scrutiny.\n\nThe movie, starring Industry actor Marisa Abela as Amy throughout her fame and death, is set to hit cinemas on April 12. It's been controversial from the jump, with some fearing that the project would be exploitative or simply too soon after her 2011 death.\n\nLast week, a clip was released showing Back to Black's depiction of the process of Amy's first record deal and writing \"Stronger Than Me,\" the song that opens the 2003 album Frank.\n\nIt gives the first in-depth look at Marisa's Amy vocals, which, to put it bluntly, was not met well. An excerpt of the clip quickly went viral on TikTok, with some contrasting the \"forced\" vocals with Austin Butler's voice in Elvis.\n\nOthers further insinuated that the film was going into parody territory, a common trope during Amy's life.\n\n@missjantha\n\n#stitch with @Amy Jade Winehouse I'm so confused, Amy doesn't even sound that thatüò≠ it's like a bad tribute act\n\n‚ô¨ original sound - Amy Jade Winehouse\n\nFor context, here's the real Amy singing \"Stronger Than Me\" live:\n\nThis weekend, both Sam and Marisa spoke to the Sunday Times. Marisa said she felt \"an obligation to do right by Amy.\" The piece further said that she practiced with a vocal coach for three months beforehand, multiple times a week.\n\nWhen asked explicitly if the movie was controversial, Sam replied, \"No I don‚Äôt think so in any way. Noise will always be big about something like this, but nobody has really seen it yet and we‚Äôve made it through Amy‚Äôs words, music, her perspective. Anything else would, yes, have been exploitative, but this retelling lacks tragic hindsight. It is not an investigative piece ‚Äî it joyfully honors Amy.‚Äù\n\nSam further acknowledged the 2015 documentary Amy, adding, ‚ÄúAll my sense of her recently has been through the media and documentary. We have judged her through them, so I wanted to make something that people would watch and then go straight home and listen to her music.‚Äù\n\nThe writer further suggested that the movie \"exonerates\" Mitch, to which Sam emphasized that the family was not involved in what was shot. Sam explained, \"This is a totally different perspective of Mitch as a parent, through Amy‚Äôs eyes. It‚Äôs, ‚ÄòFor right or wrong, all the choices he makes, that‚Äôs just my dad.‚Äô‚Äù\n\nSo, what do you make of the clip?\n\nYou can read the full interview with Sam and Marisa here.\n\nShare This Article"
