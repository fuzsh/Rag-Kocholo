Amy Winehouse, an English singer and songwriter, was a notable personality in the music industry. She left an indelible mark with her distinct voice and soulful compositions. Winehouse was born on September 14, 1983, in London. She was introduced to jazz music at a young age by her uncles, both of whom were professional jazz musicians. This early exposure played a significant role in shaping her musical style and preference for jazz. Winehouse attended the Sylvia Young Theatre School and later the BRIT School, where she honed her talent and laid the groundwork for her future career. Winehouse's debut album, Frank, released in 2003, immediately established her as a rising star in the UK music scene. The album was critically acclaimed, fusing elements of jazz, pop, soul, and hip-hop that showcased her unique vocal style and songwriting prowess. Her breakthrough, however, came with her second album, Back to Black, in 2006. This album, featuring hits such as Rehab and You Know I'm No Good, resonated with audiences worldwide and catapulted her to international fame. Back to Black earned her five Grammy Awards in 2008, making Winehouse the first British woman to win five Grammys in one night. Despite her meteoric rise to stardom, Winehouse battled personal issues throughout her career, most notably struggles with substance abuse and mental health. Her life and career were cut tragically short when she died on July 23, 2011, at the age of 27. Yet, in her relatively short time in the spotlight, Amy Winehouse managed to leave a lasting impact on the world of music.

Adele, full name Adele Laurie Blue Adkins, is a globally renowned singer and songwriter hailing from Tottenham, London. Born on May 5th, 1988, she made her way into the music industry with an impressive debut album titled 19, released in 2008. The album was named after her age at its creation and was met with massive acclaim for its mature sound and resonating lyrics about heartbreak.

In 2011, Adele released her second studio album 21, again reflecting her age during composition.

Despite personal challenges along this journey — vocal cord surgery in late-2011 being one — Adele has consistently demonstrated resilience alongside unmatched vocal talent.

Imogen Jennifer Heap (; born 9 December 1977) is an English singer-songwriter, record producer and audio engineer. Born in the London Borough of Havering, Heap became classically trained in piano, cello and clarinet at a young age. She began writing songs at the age of 13 and, while attending boarding school, taught herself both guitar and drums, as well as music production on Atari computers.

Heap released two singles in late 2004, "Just for Now" and "Goodnight and Go", the latter of which is her highest charting single on the UK Singles Chart. Heap's second studio album, Speak for Yourself (2005), was released in the United Kingdom on her own label, Megaphonic Records. "Hide and Seek", her most commercially successful single to date, was certified gold by the RIAA and was heavily sampled in Jason Derulo's debut single, "Whatcha Say".
