        "text": "Prince Frederick Emil August of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg (23 August 1800 in Kiel – 2 July 1865 in Bayreuth, Germany), usually simply known by just his first name, Frederick, Prince of Noer, was a prince of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg and a cadet-line descendant of the Danish royal house.\n\nHe was the second and youngest son of Louise Auguste of Denmark and Frederik Christian II, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg. As such, he was close to succeed in the Danish throne. He was the brother-in-law of King Christian VIII and nephew of King Frederik VI. His elder brother, Christian August II, succeeded in 1814 as the Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg.\n\nAfter his second, morganatic union, he renounced the rights of succession to House of Augustenburg. He was created Prince of Noer or Nør by Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria afterwards."
