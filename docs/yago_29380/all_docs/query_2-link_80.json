        "text": "Princess Alice of the United Kingdom was the third child & second daughter of Queen Victoria & Prince Albert.\n\nShe became Her Royal Highness Princess Louis of Hesse and by Rhine (1 July 1862 – 13 June 1877) following her marriage to Prince Louis of Hesse. Then Her Royal Highness The Grand Duchess of Hesse and by Rhine (13 June 1877 – 14 December 1878) when his fathers brother Grand Duke Louis III died.\n\nBrief biography;\n\nPrincess Alice was born on 25 April 1843 at Buckingham Palace. She was christened \"Alice Maud Mary\" in the private chapel at Buckingham Palace by The Archbishop of Canterbury, William Howley, on 2 June 1843.\n\n\"Maud\", the Anglo-Saxon name for Matilda, was chosen in honour of one of Alice's godparents, Princess Sophia Matilda of Gloucester, a niece of King George III. \"Mary\" was chosen because Alice was born on the same day as her maternal great-aunt, the Duchess of Gloucester.\n\nAlice spent her early childhood in the company of her parents & siblings, travelling between the British royal residences. Her education was devised by Albert's close friend & adviser, Baron Stockmar, & included practical activities like needlework & woodwork & languages such as French & German.\n\nWhen her father, Prince Albert, became fatally ill in December 1861, Alice nursed him until his death. Following his death, Queen Victoria entered a period of intense mourning & Alice spent the next six months acting as her mother's unofficial secretary.\n\nOn 1 July 1862, while the court was still at the height of mourning, Alice married the minor German Prince Louis of Hesse, heir to the Grand Duchy of Hesse.\n\nEngagement & wedding;\n\nOn 30 April 1861 Princess Alice became engaged to Prince Louis of Hesse (b.12 September 1837 – d.13 March 1892), following the Queen Victoria's consent. The Queen persuaded the Prime Minister, Lord Palmerston, to vote Alice a dowry of £30,000 (£2.57 million as of 2018). Although the amount was considered generous at the time, Prince Albert remarked that \"she will not be able to do great things with it\" in the little realm of Hesse, compared to the riches that her sister Victoria would inherit as future Queen of Prussia & German Empress. Furthermore, the couple's future home in Darmstadt, the Grand Ducal seat, was uncertain. Although Queen Victoria expected that a new palace would be built, the people of Darmstadt did not want to meet that expense, & the resulting controversy caused resentment there. This meant that unfortunately Alice was unpopular in Darmstadt before she even arrived.\n\nBetween the engagement & the wedding, Alice's father Prince Albert died on 14 December 1861. Despite the Queen's grief, she made sure that the wedding should continue as planned.\n\nOn 1 July 1862, Alice & Louis were married privately in the dining room of Osborne House, on the Isle of Wight which was converted into a temporary chapel. The Queen was ushered in by her four sons, acting as a living screen blocking her from view, & took her place in an armchair near the altar.\n\nAlice was given away by her uncle, Albert's brother Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, & was flanked by four bridesmaids: her younger sisters, Princesses Helena, Louise & Beatrice, as well as Louis's sister Princess Anna.\n\nFor the ceremony, Alice wore a white dress with a veil of Honiton lace, but was required to wear black mourning clothes before & after the ceremony.\n\nThe Queen, sat in her armchair, struggled to hold back her tears, & was shielded from view by the Prince of Wales & Prince Alfred, her second son, who cried throughout the service.\n\nThe weather at Osborne was very dull, with winds blowing up from the Channel. The Queen wrote to her eldest daughter, Victoria, that the ceremony was \"more of a funeral than a wedding\", & remarked to Alfred, Lord Tennyson that it was \"the saddest day I can remember\"\n\nThe Queen gifted her daughter a gold, diamond & pearl bracelet, inscribed as a gift from both parents 'To dear Alice from her loving parents Albert & Victoria R who though visibly parted are ever united', April 25, 1863.\n\nThe ceremony was over by 4 pm, & the couple set off for their honeymoon at St Claire in Ryde, on the Isle of Wight. Alice's entourage consisted of Lady Churchill, General Seymour & Baron Westerweller (a Hessian courtier).\n\nThe wedding dress description;\n\nThe muted Royal occasion was reflected in the dress, which was noted as being a 'half-high dress with a deep flounce of Honiton lace, a veil of the same & a wreath of orange blossom and myrtle. It was a simple style & not embellished with a court train'.\n\nLife after the wedding;\n\nThe Princess's life in Darmstadt was unhappy as a result of impoverishment, family tragedy & worsening relations with her husband & mother.\n\nTragedy befell Alice on 29 May 1873, when her youngest & favourite son, Friedrich, called \"Frittie\", died after falling 20 feet from a window. He suffered from haemophilia, & although he regained consciousness, the internal bleeding could not be stopped. After Frittie's death, Alice attached herself more closely to her only surviving son, Ernest, & her newborn daughter Marie. In 1875 she resumed her public duties, including fund-raising, medical & social work, which had always held her interest. During this time, relations with her husband deteriorated. In late 1876, she travelled to England for treatment due to an internal complaint caused by a backward curvature of the womb, & remained at Balmoral while she recovered.\n\nDespite their marital problems, Alice remained a strong supporter of her husband, being highly critical when his abilities or talents were not fully recognised. On 20 March 1877, Louis' father Prince Charles died, making Louis heir apparent. On 13 June the same year, Charles' older brother Grand Duke Louis III died, & Louis & Alice became the Grand Duke & Duchess of Hesse.\n\nThe Princess was patron of women's causes & showed a keen interest in nursing, especially the work of Florence Nightingale. When Hesse became involved in the Austro-Prussian War, Darmstadt filled with the injured; the heavily pregnant Alice devoted a lot of her time to the management of field hospitals. One of her organisations, the Princess Alice Women's Guild, took over much of the day-to-day running of the state's military hospitals. As a result of this activity, Queen Victoria became concerned about Alice's directness about medical matters.\n\nIn November 1878, the Grand Ducal household fell ill with diphtheria. Alice's eldest daughter Victoria was the first to fall ill, complaining of a stiff neck in the evening of 5 November. Diphtheria was diagnosed the following morning, & the disease spread to Alice's children Alix, Marie, Irene, & Ernest. Her husband Louis became infected shortly thereafter. Elisabeth was the only child to not fall ill, having been sent away by Alice to the palace of the Princess Charles, her mother-in-law.\n\nMarie became seriously ill on 15 November, & Alice was called to her bedside, but by the time she arrived, Marie had choked to death. A distraught Alice wrote to Queen Victoria that the \"pain is beyond words\".\n\nAlice kept the news of Marie's death secret from her children for several weeks, but she finally told Ernest in early December. His reaction was even worse than she had anticipated; at first he refused to believe it. As he sat up crying, Alice broke her rule about physical contact with the ill & gave him a kiss. At first, however, Alice did not fall ill. She met her sister Victoria as the latter was passing through Darmstadt on the way to England, & wrote to her mother with \"a hint of resumed cheerfulness\" on the same day. However, by Saturday, 14 December, the anniversary of her father's death, she became seriously ill with the diphtheria caught from her son. Her last words were \"dear Papa\", & she fell unconscious at 2:30 am. Just after 8:30 am, she died. Alice was buried on 18 December 1878 at the Grand Ducal mausoleum at Rosenhöhe outside Darmstadt, with the Union Flag draped over her coffin.\n\nAlice was the first of Queen Victoria's nine children to die (14 December 1878 (aged 35), & one of three to be outlived by their mother, who died in 1901.\n\nAlice founded the Alice-Hospital in Darmstadt in 1869, to treat the city's sick & wounded. The organisation continued to flourish long after Alice's death, & in 1953, her grandson Louis, Earl Mountbatten of Burma gave a lecture on the hospital. He spoke highly of Alice, saying \"[for her] the point of departure always remained a human being who was ill & needed help, & his needs in war & peace. At his side stood the person willing to give help, wishing to ameliorate his needs & for this purpose could make use of an organisation which was becoming more & more streamlined.\" Among Alice's other establishments were the Alice Society for Women's Training & Industry, for the purpose of educating women, & the Princess Alice Women's Guild, an organisation devoted to training nurses.\n\nAlice's descendants went on to play significant roles in world history. Her fourth daughter, Alix, married Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, passing her mother's gene for haemophilia on to her only son, the Tsarevich Alexei.
