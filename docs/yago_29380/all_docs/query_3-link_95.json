        "text": "Footnotes\n\n'I KNOW SCHOOL BOYS EXPECT A LITTLE MONEY ON GOING BACK TO SCHOOL': Queen Victoria, the doting grandmother, writes fondly to a favourite grandson. Prince Christian Victor of Schleswig-Holstein, known in the family as \"Christle\", died of enteric fever in October 1900 whilst serving in the Boer War. He holds the honour of being the only member of the Royal family to have played first class cricket, turning out for the I Zingari club in 1897 against the Gentlemen of England captained by W.G. Grace. Our album includes a photograph of the Prince with what appears to be other members of the team and club co-founder John Lorraine Baldwin resplendent in his bath chair.\n\nTo have been given such personal items from the Prince's own possessions illustrates the great esteem in which George Wise was held by the royal family, as Princess Marie Louise writes in a letter of recommendation included here: \"George Wise was personal servant to the late Prince Christian Victor for 8 years... his devotion to my brother was decorated personally by H M the late Queen Victoria, he also received Queen Victoria's Jubilee Medal, with King Edward's & King George's coronation medals together with the South African and late Great War medals. After my brothers death, he became my Steward and Sec: in charge of all my household a/cs and my entire household. He was with me from 1900 to 1916... I can not recommend him too highly, & is absolutely fitted for any position of trust...\"."
