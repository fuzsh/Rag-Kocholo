        "text": "Operation Weserübung saw the attack of Denmark by Germany in 1940, officially breaking the peace pact established at the start of World War II. German occupation followed, but King Christian X remained on the throne. And so the Danish royal family became national emblems of resistance at a time of great uncertainty, violence and widespread oppression. But there was a defector in their midst in the form of one Princess Helena.\n\nAccording to Danish royal writer Trong Norén Isaksen, German-born Princess Helena was ‘banished’ upon Denmark’s liberation in 1945. The princess, wife of Prince Harald and sister-in-law to King Christian, was considered a de facto traitor, and was therefore removed from the country ‘with the king’s full approval,’ according to the Danish press at the time. But what exactly did she do to warrant the expulsion?\n\nThe marriage of Helena and Harald was seen as a great symbol of Danish unity, as it brought together the royal and ducal branches of the monarchy. But the effect was quite the opposite, it seems.\n\nHarald and Helena married in April 1909, at Glucksburg Castle outside Copenhagen, and proceeded to have five children together, all heirs to the Danish throne. Despite setting up an orphanage during the 1920s, Isakensen suggests that Helena was a strong and cruel mother.\n\nIt seems that Helena’s brutality at home was just the start of the deeply problematic views that lurked within. Despite a hopeful start to the marriage, with artist Charles Binger stating that the country met her with ‘laughter and kind words’, public perception of the princess shifted following the occupation, when she purportedly began to openly sympathise with Germany and therefore align herself with the Nazi party. The Danish resistance movement – a group who rebelled against the Nazi occupation -–have labelled Helena as the only member of the royal family who betrayed Denmark in her German allegiances. Not only did Helena reportedly host Germans in her home and at The Tourist Hotel during the war, she also attempted to convince her husband Harald to allow Nazi members into the Danish government."
