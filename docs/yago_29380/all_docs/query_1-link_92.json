        "text": "Royal Guests and Relatives gathered from around Europe to celebrate the Wedding of Prince Constantin von Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg and Countess Sophia von der Schulenburg at the Església de Sant Bartolomeu in Mallorca on June 1st.\n\nPrince Constantin von Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, the second son of the late Prince of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg and Princess Elisabeth of Lippe-Weissenfeld, married Countess Sophia von der Schulenburg, daughter of Count Fritz von der Schulenburg and Baroness Franziska von Knigge, in Mallorca. The Couple had a Civil Wedding Ceremony in March 2023, shortly before the birth of their son, Prince Tassilo. Prince Constantin said:\n\n“Our two families have known each other for ages, we met when we were 18 and have always stayed in touch. And at some point a close friendship turned into love.”\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/C7uHozHpn-d/\n\nThe bride and groom drove from the church square in Sóller to the reception in a small Mallorcan car. The Reception was held at the von der Schulenburg Estate in Sóller, nearby to the Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg Estate in Santa Maria.\n\nCountess Sophia von der Schulenburg wore the heirloom Schleswig-Holstein Diamond Bow Tiara, which originally belonged to Princess Alexandra of Edinburgh and Saxe-Coburg und Gotha, a granddaughter of Queen Victoria.\n\nCount Fritz and Countess Franziska von der Schulenburg with the Dowager Princess of Schleswig-Holstein\n\nPrince Tassilo of Schleswig-Holstein\n\nPrince Josef-Emanuel and Princess María Claudia of Liechtenstein\n\nCountess Tamara von Nayhauss\n\nCount Alexander and Countess Gabriella von Fugger-Babenhausen\n\nUltima Hora | Bild\n\nA striking Diamond Tiara of twisted Diamond Bows and Ribbons which dates from the 1890s or the early 1900s, this Tiara shares similarities to one created around the same time by Boucheron, and was likely acquired by Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna, Duchess of Saxe-Coburg und Gotha and Edinburgh for her daughter, Princess Alexandra, but was not among the gifts when she married the Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg in 1896.\n\nPrincess Alexandra was only photographed wearing the Diamond Bow Tiara one, for a series of portraits taken by E. Uhlenhuth in Coburg in the early 1900s, when the Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg served as the Regent to Prince Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n\nWhen Princess Marie Melita of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, the eldest daughter of Prince Ernst II and Princess Alexandra, married Hereditary Prince Wilhelm Friedrich of Schleswig-Holstein-Glücksburg in Coburg in 1916, the bride placed the Diamond Bow Tiara on top of her floral headdress.\n\nIn 1933, Hereditary Princess Marie Melita wore the Diamond Bow Tiara for the Wedding of Prince Knud and Princess Caroline-Mathilde of Denmark, a cousin of her husband, at Fredensborg Palace.\n\nThe couple became the Duke and Duchess of Schleswig-Holstein in 1934, after the death of her mother’s first cousin, a grandson of Queen Victoria, and the Duchess wore the Bow Tiara at the Wedding of Princess Alexandrine Louise of Denmark, daughter of a Princess of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, and Count Luitpold of Castell-Castell, at Christiansborg Palace in 1937.\n\nLater that year, the Duchess of Schleswig-Holstein wore the Diamond Bow Tiara for the Wedding of Prince Christian of Schaumburg-Lippe and Princess Feodora of Denmark at Fredensborg Palace in 1937.\n\nAt some point in the 1960s, possibly around the time of the Duchess’ death in 1967, the Diamond Bow Tiara was worn by her daughter, Princess Marie Alexandra of Schleswig-Holstein, at a Ball where she was pictured with Duke Philipp von Württemberg.\n\nMore recently, the Diamond Bow Tiara was worn by Princess Ingeborg of Schleswig-Holstein, sister of the then Prince of Schleswig-Holstein, a the Wedding of Hereditary Prince Bernhard of Baden at Schloss Salem in 2001. There have been no images of any of the recent family brides, but one might imagine that they wore this family heirloom. Lets hope we see it worn again soon!\n\nCountess Sophia von der Schulenburg wore the Schleswig-Holstein Diamond Bow Tiara for her Wedding to Prince Constantin von Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg in 2024.\n\nFringe Tiara\n\nOrigin: Wedding Gift from her mother, Tsarina Marie Alexandrovna in 1874\n\nNotable Appearances: The Coronation of her nephew, Tsar Nicholas II, in 1896 and the Coronation of her nephew, King George V, in 1911.\n\nFate: Left to Princess Beatrice, Duchess of Galliera, who sold it to her sister, Queen Marie of Romania, and was in turn inherited by her daughter, Queen Marie of Yugoslavia, who sold it at Auction in 1960.
