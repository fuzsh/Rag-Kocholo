The dress of pale vieux rose brocade, with effective design, was made with full-gathered skirt and a very long-pointed bodice, bordered with silver galon, studded with diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and pearls. The neck was enframed with the same galon, terminating in graceful curves at each side of the stomacher, and which was covered with diamond ornaments, chains of pearls, fell over the bust, and there were a tucker of old lace and white muslin sleeves slashed with the brocade and caught up by straps of the jeweled galon.\"[7]:p. 5, Col. 9b\n\n\"Princess Christian, in eighteenth century costume of pink and gold, had her hair looped with pearls.\"[8]:41, Col. 2a\n\nPrincess Helena of Schleswig-Holstein was dressed as Sophia Charlotte of Hanover (30 October 1668 – 1 February 1705), who was George I's only sister.[9] The London Evening Standard disagrees with the others about the color of her dress, saying it was old-torquoise instead of old-pink brocade.\n\nPrince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\nPrince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein sat at Table 6 in the first supper seating. He was dressed as the Earl of Lincoln in the court of Elizabeth:\n\n\"Prince Christian as Earl of Lincoln (Elizabethan period). Black velvet costume lined with ermine; fawn satin tunic and trunks, the latter, as well as the sleeves, slashed with white satin. Black velvet cap, with white feathers fastened in with a jewelled ornament.\"[10]\n\n\"Prince Christian, as the Earl of Lincoln, was splendidly attired in white velvet doublet, white satin breeches, the black velvet coat being caped and lined with ermine.\"[11]:p. 5, Col. 6a\n\n\"Duke Adolphus of Schleswig-Holstein Gottorp, who received the Garter in 1560 from Queen Elizabeth.\"[2]:p. 7, Col. 6c\n\nMr. W.

Prince Christian as Duke Adolphus of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp, A.D. 1560.\"[16]\n\nPrince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein was dressed as Adolf, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp (25 January 1526 – 1 October 1586), son of King Frederick I of Denmark and the first duke of Holstein-Gottorp.[17] The portrait (upper right) of Adolf, Duke of Holstein shows him in his last year of life, about 60 years old. Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein was 65 years old at the time of the ball. The Duke of Holstein-Gottorp is wearing armor in his portrait, so it is not likely to be the original, if one exists, of the costume worn by Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein. This portrait has been in the collection of the National Museum in Sweden since 1866.[18]\n\nPrincess Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\nPrincess Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein sat at Table 8 and is treated on her own page.\n\nNationality: hers, English\n\nFrederick Christian Charles Augustus, Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein (22 January 1831 – 28 October 1917)[19]\n\nPrincess Helena Augusta Victoria (25 May 1846 - 9 June 1923)[1][20]\n\nPrince Christian Victor (14 April 1867 – 29 October 1900)\n\nAlbert, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein (26 February 1869 – 27 April 1931)\n\nPrincess Victoria (Helena Victoria) of Schleswig-Holstein (3 May 1870 – 13 March 1948)\n\nMarie Louise, Princess Aribert of Anhalt (12 August 1872 – 8 December 1956)\n\nPrince Harald (12 May 1876 – 20 May 1876)\n\nUnnamed male baby (7 May 1877)\n\nMother, Queen Victoria (Helena was Victoria's 5th child, 3rd daughter)\n\nFather, Prince Albert"
