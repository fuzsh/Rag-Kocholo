        "text": "Princess Helena Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg (Victoria Louise Sophia Augusta Amelia Helena; May 3, 1870 – March 13, 1948) was a granddaughter of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. From 1917 her name was simply Princess Helena Victoria.\n\nPrincess Helena Victoria (always known to her family as Thora) was born at Frogmore House, near Windsor Castle. Her father was Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein, the third son of Christian August II, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg\n\nand Countess Louise af Danneskjold-Samsøe.\n\nHer mother was Princess Helena, the fifth child and third daughter of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Her parents resided in Britain from marriage.\n\nShe was baptised in the private chapel at Windsor Castle on June 20, 1870. Her godparents were Queen Victoria, the Duchess of Cambridge (former Princess Augusta of Hesse-Cassel), Princess Louise, Prince Arthur, Prince Leopold, Prince Valdemar of Denmark, Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar, Princess Louise Auguste of Schleswig-Holstein and Princess Caroline Amelie of Schleswig-Holstein (the latter two represented by the Duchess of Roxburghe).\n\nShe was a bridesmaid at the 1885 wedding of her maternal aunt Princess Beatrice to Prince Henry of Battenberg and also at the wedding of her cousins the Duke and Duchess of York (future George V and Queen Mary) in 1893.\n\nShe spent most of her childhood at Cumberland Lodge, her father’s residence as Ranger of Windsor Great Park. Known to her family as “Thora”, or sometimes “Snipe”, in reference to her sharp facial features, formally she used the names “Helena Victoria” from among her string of six given names.\n\nFirst World War\n\nAs a male-line granddaughter of the Duke of Schleswig-Holstein, Princess Helena Victoria would have been styled Serene Highness (Durchlaucht) in the German Empire.\n\nIn May 1866, Queen Victoria had conferred the higher style of Highness upon any children to be born of the marriage of Princess Helena and Prince Christian, although the children were to remain Prince or Princess of Schleswig-Holstein.\n\nIn June 1917, a notice appeared in the Court Circular that a Royal Warrant was to be prepared by George V dispensing with his cousins’ use of the “Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg” part of their titles.\n\nHowever no warrant was issued, nor were they formally granted the titles of Princesses of Great Britain and Ireland nor of the United Kingdom in their own right.\n\nIn July 1917, King George V changed the name of the British royal family to the House of Windsor. He also relinquished, on behalf of himself and his numerous cousins who were British subjects, the use of their German titles, styles, and surnames. Princess Helena Victoria and her younger sister, Princess Marie Louise, thereupon ceased to use the territorial designation “of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg.”\n\nInstead, they became known simply as “Her Highness Princess Helena Victoria” and “Her Highness Princess Marie Louise”. Although the two had borne German titles, their upbringing and domicile were entirely English.\n\nLater life\n\nPrincess Helena Victoria never married. She followed her mother’s example in working for various charitable organizations, most notably YMCA, Young Women’s Christian Association (YWCA) and Princess Christian’s Nursing Home at Windsor. During World War I, she founded the YWCA Women’s Auxiliary Force. As its president, she visited British troops in France and obtained the permission of the Secretary of State for War, Lord Kitchener, to arrange entertainments for them.\n\nBetween the world wars, she and her sister, Princess Marie Louise, were enthusiastic patrons of music at Schomberg House, their London residence. After a German air raid damaged the house in 1940, the two princesses moved to Fitzmaurice Place, Berkeley Square.\n\nIn ill health and a wheelchair user after World War II, Princess Helena Victoria made one of her last major appearances at the November 20, 1947 wedding of her first cousin twice removed Princess Elizabeth, to Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark.\n\nPrincess Helena Victoria died at Fitzmaurice Place, Berkeley Square. Her funeral took place at St. George’s Chapel, Windsor and she was buried at the Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore, Windsor Great Park. She died at the age of 77, the same age at which her mother, Princess Helena, had also died.\n\nIn 1917, in response to the wave of anti-German feeling that surrounded the war, George V changed the family name from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to Windsor. He also disposed of his family’s German titles and styles, so Helena and her daughters simply became Princess Christian, Princess Helena Victoria and Marie Louise with no territorial designation. Helena’s surviving son, Albert, fought on the side of the Prussians, though he made it clear that he would not fight against his mother’s country.\n\nIn the same year, Prince Christian died at Schomberg House, Pall Mall, on October 28, 1917, in his eighty-sixth year. He is buried in the Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore in Windsor Great Park.\n\nPrince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein\n\nHelena’s last years were spent arguing with Commissioners, who tried to turn her out of Schomberg House and Cumberland Lodge because of the expense of running her households. They failed, as clear evidence of her right to live in those residences for life was shown.\n\nDeath\n\nPrincess Helena, Princess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein, died at Schomberg House on June 9, 1923 at the age of 77. Her funeral, described as a “magnificently stage-managed scene” by her biographer Seweryn Chomet, was headed by King George V. The regiment of her favourite son, Prince Christian-Victor, lined the steps of St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle. Although originally interred in the Royal Vault at St George’s on June 15, 1923, her body was reburied at the Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore, a few miles from Windsor, after its consecration on October 23, 1928.\n\nPrincess Helena\n\nLegacy\n\nHelena was devoted to nursing, and took the lead at the charitable organisations she represented. She was also an active campaigner, and wrote letters to newspapers and magazines promoting the interests of nurse registration. Her royal status helped to promote the publicity and society interest that surrounded organisations such as the Royal British Nurses’ Association. The RBNA still survives today with Aubrey Rose as president.\n\nEmily Williamson founded the Gentlewomen’s Employment Association in Manchester; one of the projects which came out of this group was the Princess Christian Training College for Nurses, in Fallowfield, Manchester.\n\nIn appearance, Helena was described by John Van der Kiste as plump and dowdy; and in temperament, as placid, and business-like, with an authoritarian spirit. On one occasion, during a National Dock Strike, the Archbishop of Canterbury composed a prayer hoping for its prompt end. Helena arrived at the church, examined her service sheet, and in a voice described by her daughter as “the penetrating royal family whisper, which carried farther than any megaphone”, remarked: “That prayer won’t settle any strike.”\n\nHer appearance and personality was criticised in the letters and journals of Queen Victoria, and biographers followed her example. However, Helena’s daughter, Princess Marie-Louise, described her as:\n\nvery lovely, with wavy brown hair, a beautiful little straight nose, and lovely amber-coloured eyes … She was very talented: played the piano exquisitively, had a distinct gift for drawing and painting in water-colours … Her outstanding gift was loyalty to her friends … She was brilliantly clever, had a wonderful head for business. …\n\nMusic was one of her passions; in her youth she played the piano with Charles Hallé, and Jenny Lind and Clara Butt were among her personal friends. Her determination to carry out a wide range of public duties won her widespread popularity. She twice represented her mother at Drawing Rooms, which was considered equivalent to being presented to the Queen herself.\n\nHelena was closest to her brother, Prince Alfred, who considered her his favorite sister. Though described by contemporaries as fearfully devoted to the Queen, to the point that she did not have a mind of her own, she actively campaigned for women’s rights, a field the Queen abhorred. Nevertheless, both she and Beatrice remained closest to the Queen, and Helena remained close to her mother’s side until the latter’s death. Her name was the last to be written in the Queen’s seventy-year-old journal.\n\nPrincess Helena Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg (Victoria Louise Sophia Augusta Amelia Helena; May 3, 1870 – March 13, 1948) and Princess Marie Louise of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg (Franziska Josepha Louise Augusta Marie Christina Helena; August 12, 1872 – December 8 1956) were the daughters of Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg (third son of Christian August II, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg and Countess Louise af Danneskjold-Samsøe) and Princess Helena of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (the fifth child and third daughter of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha).\n\nTheir Parents Marriage\n\nIn 1863, the Queen Victoria looked for a husband for her daughter Princess Helena. However, as a middle child, the prospect of a powerful alliance with a European royal house was low. Her appearance was also a concern, as by the age of fifteen she was described by her biographer as chunky, dowdy and double-chinned. Despite her biographer saying she was chunky with a double chin, photos from that time period do not provide evidence of that.\n\nPrincess Helena\n\nFurthermore, Victoria insisted that Helena’s future husband had to be prepared to live near the Queen, thus keeping her daughter nearby. Her choice eventually fell on Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg, 15 years her senior.\n\nPrincess Helena and Prince Christian at their engagement 1865\n\nThe engagement was declared on December 5, 1865, and despite the Prince of Wales’s initial refusal to attend (because of the political issues raised over the twin duchies of Schleswig-Holstein) Alice intervened, and the wedding was a happy occasion. The Queen allowed the ceremony to take place at Windsor Castle, albeit in the Private Chapel rather than the grander St George’s Chapel on July 5 1866.\n\nThe couple had six children: Christian Victor in 1867, Albert in 1869, and Helena Victoria and Marie Louise in 1870 and 1872 respectively. Their last two sons died early; Harald died eight days after his birth in 1876, and an unnamed son was stillborn in 1877.\n\nPrincess Helena Victoria & Princess Marie Louise\n\nPrincess Helena Victoria (always known to her family as Thora) was born at Frogmore House, near Windsor Castle. Princess Marie Louise was born at Cumberland Lodge, in Windsor Great Park. She was known to her family as “Louie”.\n\nPrincess Helena Victoria\n\nOn July 6, 1891, Princess Marie Louise married Prince Aribert of Anhalt (June 18, 1866 – December 24, 1933) at St. George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle. Prince Aribert was the third son of Friedrich I, Duke of Anhalt, and his wife, Princess Antoinette of Saxe-Altenburg. The bride’s first cousin, the German Emperor Wilhelm II, had been instrumental in arranging the match.\n\nPrincess Marie Louise\n\nThough contemporary sources did not directly suggest it was a cause of his marriage dissolution, a number of contemporaries and subsequent historical accounts suggest Aribert was bisexual or homosexual, and some have suggested an indiscretion with a male attendant was the catalyst for the dissolution and that the marriage had never been consummated. The marriage was annulled on December 13, 1900 by his father. Princess Marie Louise, on an official visit to Canada at the time, immediately returned to Britain and was outraged. According to her memoirs, the marriage was unhappy and despite that, she regarded her marriage vows as binding, therefore she never remarried.\n\nPrincess Helena Victoria never married. She followed her mother’s example in working for various charitable organizations, most notably the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA), Young Women’s Christian Association (YWCA) and Princess Christian’s Nursing Home at Windsor. During World War I, she founded the YWCA Women’s Auxiliary Force. As its president, she visited British troops in France and obtained the permission of the Secretary of State for War, Lord Kitchener, to arrange entertainments for them. Between the world wars, she and her sister, Princess Marie Louise, were enthusiastic patrons of music at Schomberg House, their London residence. After a German air raid damaged the house in 1940, the two princesses moved to Fitzmaurice Place, Berkeley Square.\n\nTitles of the Princesses.\n\nAs male-line granddaughters of Christian August II, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg, Princess Helena Victoria and Princess Marie Louise we’re technically German Princesses and each were styled Her Serene Highness (Durchlaucht) within the German Empire. However, Under Royal Warrant (Letters Patent) of May 15 1866, Queen Victoria had conferred the higher style of Highness upon any children to be born of the marriage of Princess Helena and Prince Christian, although the children were to remain Prince or Princess of Schleswig-Holstein. This higher style was in effect only in the United Kingdom, while in Germany their styles would remain Serene Highness.\n\nIn July 1917, during World War I, King George V changed the name of the British Royal House from the very German Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to the British sounding House of Windsor. The King also relinquished, on behalf of himself and his numerous German cousins who were British subjects, the use of their German titles, styles, and surnames. Princess Helena Victoria and her younger sister, Princess Marie Louise, thereupon ceased to use the territorial designation “of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg”. Instead, they became known simply as “Her Highness Princess Helena Victoria” and “Her Highness Princess Marie Louise”. Although the two had borne German styles and titles, and belonged to the German Royal House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg, (a collateral branch of the Danish/German House of Oldenburg) they were born and raised in England and their upbringing and domicile were entirely English. The Princesses were considered members of the British Royal Family.\n\nPrincess Helena Victoria and Princess Marie Louise\n\nIn June 1917, a notice appeared in the Court Circular that a Royal Warrant was to be prepared by George V dispensing with his cousins’ use of the “Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg” part of their titles. However no warrant was ever issued, nor were never they formally granted the titles of Princesses of Great Britain and Ireland nor of the United Kingdom in their own right. Therefore they were simply styled Her Highness Princess Helena Victoria and Her Highness Princess Marie Louise without any reference to a territorial designation.\n\nThis approach differed from the one accepted by George V’s other relatives, who relinquished all princely titles, not just their German designations, and in turn received British titles of nobility from the King. Their titles of Princess were derived from their father, and they were not officially princesses of the United Kingdom. However, their unmarried status and their right to be styled Highness dating from Queen Victoria’s concession of 1867 rendered their situations awkward, so that it was easier to allow them to retain their status as princesses while avoiding the question of immediate family membership altogether.\n\nBetween the world wars, Helena Victoria and Princess Marie Louise, were enthusiastic patrons of music at Schomberg House, their London residence where they resided together. After a German air raid damaged the house in 1940, the two princesses moved to Fitzmaurice Place, Berkeley Square.\n\nHelena Victoria\n\nIn ill health and using a wheelchair after World War II, one of Princess Helena Victoria’s last major appearance was at the November 20, 1947 wedding of her first cousin twice removed Princess Elizabeth, (future Queen Elizabeth II) to Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark.\n\nPrincess Helena Victoria died at Fitzmaurice Place, Berkeley Square, on March 13, 1948? Her funeral took place at St. George’s Chapel, Windsor and she was buried at the Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore, Windsor Great Park. She died at the age of 77, the same age at which her mother, Princess Helena, had also died.\n\nMarie Louise\n\nPrincess Marie Louise attended four coronations in Westminster Abbey, those of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra in 1902; King George V and Queen Mary in 1911; King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in 1937; and Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. In 1956, she published her memoirs, My Memories of Six Reigns. She died at her London home, 10 Fitzmaurice Place, Berkeley Square, a few months later on December 8 1956 aged 84 and is buried at the Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore at Windsor Great Park."
