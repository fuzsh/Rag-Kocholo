        "text": "Princess Helena Augusta Victoria of the United Kingdom (1846-1923) is the middle child and daughter of Queen Victoria. She is also the mother of Chrystle, Alby, Thora and Louie.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nPrincess Helena has dark hair and like most of her siblings. She has been described as plump and some consider her the least attractive of Victoria's daughters. Her daughter recalls her amber eyes and lovely, auburn hair.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nShe is very talented: plays the piano exquisitely, has a distinct gift for drawing and painting in water-colours. She is brilliantly clever and has a wonderful head for business.\n\nHistory[]\n\nHelena was born the middle of Victoria and Albert's nine children. She was an active tomboy and loved the outside. She was very physical and often played outside with her best friend, her brother Affie.\n\nHelena, or \"Lenchen\", was often compared to her sister Louise, who was much more beautiful in their mother's opinion. Helena was an excellent piano player.\n\nShe was there when her father died in 1861 and Helena, an emotional teenager often cried alone. From 1859 to 1863 Helena had an affair with Carl Ruland, the german teacher of her brother Bertie, who was banished when the Queen discovered it.\n\nLater, the elderly Prince Christian was called to court. He at first assumed the Queen wished to marry him and was surprised at the option of marrying Helena.\n\nMarriage[]\n\nHelena and Christian courted one another and got along great. Still, the marriage between them was controversial. Partly because Helena had loved another, partly because of the age difference (Christian was 35, Helena only 20) and also because Christian's family was an enemy of Denmark, and Helena's sister-in-law (Bertie's wife Alexandra) despised the both of them. The two lived near the Queen, in Frogmore House. They had four children\n\nChristian Vicor Albert Louis Ernest Anton (1867)\n\nAlbert John Charles Frederick Alfred George (1868)\n\nVictoria Louise Sophia Augusta Amelia Helena (1870)\n\nMarie Louise Augusta Christina Helena (1872)\n\nIn short, their children were known as Chrystle, Alby, Thora and Louie. It is said Helena favoured her sons.\n\nTrivia[]"
