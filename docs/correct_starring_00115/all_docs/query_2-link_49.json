Jane Dornacker, Jane died tragically in the NBC Helicopter on October 22, 1986 while on-air with Joey Reynolds.\n\nYoutube\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpIHRNe45mA\n\nI shot this with Jane less than a month before on Sept. 27th ’86, she was a huge talent and good person greatly missed! Jon Hammond\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Dornacker\n\nJane Dornacker (October 1, 1947 – October 22, 1986) was an American rock musician, actress, and comedienne turned traffic reporter.\n\nIn 1986, while working for WNBC 660 AM Radio in New York City (which became WFAN in 1988), Dornacker was aboard during two unrelated crashes of the helicopters leased to WNBC. She survived the first crash, but was killed in the second crash into the Hudson River, which occurred as she was in the middle of a live traffic report. Her death came shortly after that of her husband, Bob Knickerbocker, orphaning their 16-year-old daughter. The NTSB investigation determined the cause of the fatal crash to have been use of improper parts and poor maintenance on the part of Spectrum Helicopters of Ridgefield Park, New Jersey.\n\nMusic and acting\n\nDornacker was the tall lead singer (Leila), keyboardist, and songwriter of the 1970s/1980s San Francisco “tack” rock group Leila and the Snakes. Pearl Gates and Pamela Wood provided supporting vocals. Their repertoire included “Rock and Roll Weirdos,” “Pyramid Power” and a spoof version of Peggy Lee’s “Is That All There Is?” Gates later left (and took the band with her) to form Pearl Harbor and the Explosions. Guitarist Miles Corbin went on to form the surf instrumental band the Aqua Velvets.\n\nDornacker provided lead vocals on “Christopher Columbus” (1978), a song by R. Crumb & His Cheap Suit Serenaders. With Ron Nagle, she co-wrote the humorous hit song “Don’t Touch Me There” for The Tubes. The song was sung by Re Styles and appeared on The Tubes’ second studio album, Young and Rich (1976), and was released as a 7″ single in the US, the UK, and Holland. The B-side was “Proud to Be an American”. Jane had also toured with The Tubes as a backing singer and dancer.\n\nDornacker was also an actress. She appeared in playwright Sam Shepard’s jazz opera Inacoma at San Francisco’s Magic Theatre (1977) and was featured in other works by the Overtone Theatre. She appeared in The Stand-Up, Anita Sperm and as the mysterious Nurse Murch in the film The Right Stuff.\n\n[edit]Stand up comedy and radio\n\nDornacker developed a successful career as a stand-up comic on the San Francisco circuit and did her first work as a traffic reporter in the early-mid-1980s for KFRC, a popular Top 40 radio station. She worked with Don Rose, who was that station’s morning disc jockey at the time. She was noted for her exceptionally fast speech, so fast it required concentration to understand her. As she did traffic, she would tell her daughter Naomi to get up and get to school. She moved to New York City to become a much-loved, raspy-voiced “trafficologist” and “Jane-in-a-plane.” After Dornacker died, Rose arranged several tributes to establish a college fund for Naomi.\n\nDornacker survived one helicopter crash only to die in a second helicopter crash in the same year. On April 18, 1986, Dornacker was reporting from a WNBC helicopter over the Hackensack River in New Jersey when the aircraft crashed into the river. She and the pilot survived and were able to swim to shore.\n\n[edit]Death\n\nOn October 22, 1986, at 4:44 PM, while Dornacker was giving one of the station’s N-Copter traffic reports during the Joey Reynolds Show on WNBC Radio in New York City, the Enstrom F-28 helicopter she was reporting from plunged into the Hudson River from an altitude of roughly 75 feet. On her final radio broadcast she was giving a report of an accident involving a tractor-trailer and a car as well as a car fire. She also stated that the outbound Holland Tunnel was heavy with traffic and that the Lincoln Tunnel was much better with traffic and a car fire. Dornacker was starting her report for incoming New Jersey traffic when the helicopter suffered mechanical failure in mid broadcast and crashed. Her last words were “Hit the water, hit the water, hit the water!”\n\nThe F-28 helicopter nose-dived, struck the top of a chain link fence at a river pier, crashed into the Hudson River very near to the Manhattan shore and sank in 15 to 20 feet of water. Both occupants were trapped for nearly 10–15 minutes before help arrived. Dornacker died on her way to Saint Vincent’s Hospital. She was 39 years old. Her pilot and the only other occupant, Bill Pate, was severely injured but survived.\n\nIn the subsequent investigation, the NTSB found that the sprag clutch that was installed in the helicopter, which was on lease to WNBC Radio by Spectrum Helicopters of Ridgefield Park, New Jersey, was a military surplus part which was not designed for use in a civilian aircraft, and that the part had not been adequately lubricated. It directly led to a mid-air seizure of the main rotor blades. The staff of WNBC were so appalled at the revelation of this malpractice at Spectrum Helicopters that at one point they threatened to resign en masse.[citation needed]\n\n[edit]Final crash transcript\n\nAircheck of the incident\n\n“ Joey Reynolds: “Okay, here’s Jane Dornacker now in the N-Copter”\n\n(NBC chimes)\n\nDornacker: “Thank you very much, Joey. There was indeed an accident southbound on the Major Deegan at the Mosholu Parkway, an accident, a serious accident involving a tractor trailer and a car. It has been pushed off to the shoulder, but now watch out there now, because another flatbed truck is going to have to come to clear it, so yield right-of-way. Northbound on the BQE, we’ve spotted that disabled vehicle in the right-hand lane before the Kosciuszko, not causing much of a backup, but further northbound there on the BQE, traffic is very heavy, past the Kosciuszko all the way over to the LIE. The outbound Holland Tunnel extra-heavy for you right now; earlier there was a car fire at Hudson and Canal Street. It has been cleared out, except heading to New Jersey, the outbound Lincoln Tunnel looks a lot better for you. In New Jersey…\n\n(helicopter engine overspeed)\n\nHit the water! Hit the water! Hit the water!\n\n(Brief static followed by five seconds of dead air)\n\nReynolds: Okay, we’re gonna play some, uh, some music here I think. Find out what’s going on with the helicopter. Something happened there. It’s, uh, quarter of 5; 16 ’til 5 on WNBC, on the Joey Reynolds show. We’re taking an N-Copter report from Jane Dornacker; let’s check in and see how they’re doing there, and then we’ll come right back at you.\n\n(Hip to Be Square plays)\n\nReynolds: I hope nothing happened with Jane. We had, uh, a helicopter report, from the N-Copter. Of course, you know, once before, we had this happen. A few months ago, she went down in the, uh, in the drink. Not she, I mean, she has a… pilot. Jane is, uh…\n\nOther voice: Well, until we find out what’s going on, we’ll just…\n\nReynolds: Jane was up there just now giving us a report, and sometimes it just gets cut off, too, you know. It’s just an electronic thing. But, uh, this time she said, uh, “hit the water,” or something like that. So we’re going to find out what’s going on there, so stay tuned. We hope nothing… say a little prayer, hope nothing’s, nothing’s wrong. That’s really a… (deep breath) that’s a hard, hard job.\n\n”\n\n[edit]Aftermath\n\nDornacker’s then 16-year-old daughter, Naomi, received $325,000 in a settlement with owner Spectrum Helicopters of Ridgefield Park, NJ, and the maker of the helicopter. Naomi’s father Bob Knickerbocker died shortly before her mother’s death.\n\nAll the New York stations grounded their traffic helicopters for a few days after that accident.\n\nA memorial concert in celebration of Jane took place at the Warfield Theatre in San Francisco on Saturday, November 22, 1986.\n\nThere is a memorial to her in Wayne, New Jersey, where Dornacker and her family lived.\n\nShortly after the incident several on-air interviews with WNBC Radio staff describe the incident and their feelings in detail, including how other news organizations “pumped news” into the WNBC Radio newsroom as they were all in shock. Joey Reynolds broke down on-air when talking about her now orphaned child. WNBC played other interviews with friends and recordings of her talking about the first helicopter crash earlier that same year. Her music was also played during these tribute shows including “Don’t Touch Me There” which she wrote for The Tubes. —\n\nNew York NY — Local 802 – R.I.P. Wade Barnes, passed away at only 57, never complained…very nice swingin’ cat! Jon Hammond\n\n*seen here in picture I took with Mike Camoia tenor and Bob Cunningham bass at Local 802 Monday Night Jazz Session\n\nDrummer, Educator Wade Barnes Dies at 57\n\nhttp://jazztimes.com/articles/29681-drummer-educator-wade-barnes-dies-at-57\n\nBy Jeff Tamarkin\n\nWade Barnes, a drummer, composer, producer, bandleader, arranger, educator and executive, passed away March 3 a age 57. The cause and place of death were not reported. Barnes was founder of the Brooklyn Four Plus One, Inc., a nonprofit whose stated mission, according to the organization’s website, is “to bring the highest quality of America’s classical music [jazz] to all ages, races, ethnic groups and socioeconomic levels.”\n\nOriginally, the site states, the Brooklyn Four Plus One, Inc. “was a band organized by drummer and educator Wade Barnes in the mid 1990s. The band was comprised of native Brooklynites deeply rooted in America’s musical culture. The ensemble conducted performances, clinics and symposia for a variety of audiences.” The group was later renamed the Brooklyn Repertory Ensemble (B.R.E.) and is now comprised of 17 members and plays for schools and arts organizations, particularly in under-served communities.\n\nBarnes, who received multiple music degrees from colleges and universities, is credited, according to his official biography, with “facilitating a holistic conception which incorporates the entire history of American music.” He led Wade Barnes and the Bottom Line (a 10-member ensemble) and Wade Barnes and Unit Structures. During his career he also performed with “Doc” Cheatham, Earle Warren, Dicky Wells, Howard McGhee; Jimmy Garrison, Bob Cranshaw, Archie Shepp, Sonny Fortune; Jon Faddis and others. In addition, Barnes created clinics, workshops and curricula for the New York City Public Schools.\n\nBarnes appeared on numerous recordings with several ensembles. — with Bob Cunningham at Associated Musicians of Greater New York, Local 802 AFM\n\nThe Latest Prank From TSA Airport Inspectors — Ha Hah Ha, very funny!\n\nI traveled yesterday with my instrument in a very special case made by Gator company that has the latest TSA approved lock which I do not use, I never lock my cases ever since 9/11. Often the TSA people do not close the latches properly – 4 latches on the case, I get it back from a flight and 1, 2, or even 3 have not been latched properly, so I have taken to putting green gaffers tape over the latches and I put a very friendly respectful letter inside the case to the TSA to ask them kindly to be careful to close the latches properly. Last night I got home with my case, the TSA Agent decided to lock the case up with his TSA Key, I am not carrying the key since I routinely do not lock the case. No other key will work and I have a lot of keys –\n\nNew York NY — God bless the B&H people for letting me use one of their TSA keys to unlock my flight case that the smart-aleck TSA agent locked up when he inspected it, so I didn’t have to break it open.
