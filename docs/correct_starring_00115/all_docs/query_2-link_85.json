        "text": "It seemed fitting to have the first themed batch on Cinecaps Digest “Version 2.0” that exploited the promise of bigger and beefier content be capsule reviews of the biggest and beefiest collection of movies yet. True, there have been longer posts before, but never one that had this sort of square footage. Or, to put it more plainly, not only have I never assembled one with this many (new) reviews before, but the total runtime of the movies being discussed is far and away the longest. That’s because these fifteen movies are all epics in the most generic definition possible. They all clock in at over three hours, with several passing four hours, and a couple even approaching six. These are movies to numb the rear end, and perhaps even the brain. They ain’t messing around. If you have a short attention span, begone. How long would it take to watch all fifteen of these movies in a row without stopping/sleeping? (Oh, yes, I did the math.) 3,449 minutes. Almost fifty-seven-and-a-half hours. Which is about as long as a few of these felt watching them, yeesh.\n\nThere’s very little else connecting these films to one another. There are war epics, sweeping romances, and multi-generational dramas; ones that span decades, and ones that span a few years or months, and one that takes place in only about a day’s time; some are intensely personal while some are overtly political; some are rather mundane in appearance while others knock the proverbial socks off with their scope and visuals; most are period pieces, from the ancient world to spots in time that many still living have experienced first-hand, but a couple are set in a contemporary age. And as for the variety of quality I try to achieve in most themed batches, there are, indeed, a few masterpieces here (and a few more near-greats) as well as a handful of movies that were ill-deserving of even one of their many, many hours. Roger Ebert had a saying (that I’m paraphrasing) where no good movie is too long and no bad movie can end soon enough. I don’t fully agree with that, but I understand what he meant. None of these films rate among the absolute worst that I’ve ever seen, but those endless runtimes sure didn’t do the crappy ones any favors. And it makes me hesitant to ever watch them again to verify my opinion—life’s too short, ya know?\n\nSo get cozy, pop the caffeine pills, strap on the feed bag, and insert the catheter. No intermissions/entr’actes permitted—plow through these fifteen films and come out on the other side victorious and exhausted. Some of these epic movies are meant to be experienced and savored, but some (even a couple of the modestly good ones) are meant to be defeated. Cue the overture fanfare and begin!\n\nNote: rather than present them in alphabetical order as I normally do, they’ll be listed in order of length from shortest (182 min.) to longest (344 min.). Also, as can be expected, several of these movies have alternate versions of varying runtimes. I almost always review the most commonly accepted/available version, and in at least two cases (Heaven’s Gate and Once Upon a Time in America), each of their wide releases in the US were shortened butchered drastically only to be restored to their proper lengths in the years afterward. I have never seen their shorter cuts, and have no intention of ever doing so.\n\nUpdate: a second, even bigger batch of epic-length movies can be found here.\n\nThe Sand Pebbles (1966)\n\nDirected by Robert Wise. Starring Steve McQueen, Richard Crenna, Richard Attenborough, Charles Robinson, Candice Bergen, Mako, Larry Gates, Simon Oakland, Marayat Andriane, Joe Turkel, Ford Rainey, Gavin MacLeod, Joseph Di Reda, Richard Loo, James Hong. [PG-13]\n\nA superior two-hour war picture needlessly stretched to three. Story centers on individualist Navy machinist McQueen and his experiences aboard a river gunboat patrolling China in the 1920s. Subplots offer little that’s new—McQueen clashes with the captain (Crenna), racist attitudes are exposed among both his shipmates and civilians, etc.—and it relies on quality production and above-average acting to fill out dead spots in its epic scope. McQueen gives one of his better performances (earning the only Oscar nod of his career), though his actorly refinement negates the unflappable cool (and movie star charisma) he was known for. Patience is taxed by uninvolving love stories among McQueen and missionary teacher Bergen, second mate Attenborough and local hostess Andriane. Quicker pace, less tolerant editing, and a firmer political stance might have made this one special, but it ends up being closer to routine on a grand scale.\n\n67/100\n\nRENT/BUY\n\nPearl Harbor (2001)\n\nDirected by Michael Bay. Starring Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, Kate Beckinsale, Alec Baldwin, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore, Cuba Gooding Jr., Ewen Bremner, William Lee Scott, Jaime King, Dan Aykroyd, Catherine Kellner, Jennifer Garner, Colm Feore, Mako, Leland Orser, Michael Shannon. [PG-13]\n\nThis war movie, “which will live in infamy,” tries to paint an old-fashioned soapy love story against the canvas of a large-scale tragedy à la Titanic; it’s a love triangle, in fact, involving two hotshot combat pilots (are they ever cautious and calculated flyboys in these kinds of pictures?) stationed at Pearl Harbor and a nurse (Beckinsale) who’s dolled up like a Hollywood starlet. They swoon unconvincingly for an hour or so while spewing stunningly bad dialogue (awful enough to make George Lucas’ romantic declarations from the Star Wars prequels sound like the work of Pablo Neruda)…but, wait, here comes Japan! Director Bay tries to make the centerpiece attack both exciting and harrowing, which only cheapens (if not insults) the historical event, and his stylistic touches of soft-focusing the horror and rapidly switching back and forth between “real” footage and handheld black & white camera shots are just distracting moments of showy excess. And then, after all the bombs have fallen and all the planes are grounded, the story dutifully marches on for almost another hour, showing the leads return their attentions to the tortured romance (while fires are still probably burning in and around the harbor), and then tacking on an anti-climactic recreation of the Doolittle Raid. Easy as it is to pile the blame onto the out-of-his-depth director and the charisma-deprived stars, the gold star of turkeydom goes to Randall Wallace’s script, which makes no attempt to discuss the global politics, or give the strategic miscalculations anything more than a cursory glance, and clearly believes that sincerity can overcome banality and mountains of clichés—no one could try to write something this bad; it can only arise from earnestly spectacular folly. Oscar winner for Sound Editing.\n\n26/100\n\nRENT/BUY\n\nMagnolia (1999)\n\nDirected by Paul Thomas Anderson. Starring Tom Cruise, Philip Seymour Hoffman, John C. Reilly, Philip Baker Hall, Melora Walters, William H. Macy, Julianne Moore, Jason Robards, Melinda Dillon, Jeremy Blackman, Ricky Jay, Michael Bowen, April Grace, Felicity Huffman, Henry Gibson, Emmanuel Johnson, Luis Guzmán, Cleo King. [R]\n\nLong but deeply engrossing mosaic of melancholy that, in the hands of writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson, becomes an exhilarating high-wire act balancing numerous intersecting storylines of damaged, grief-stricken souls in the San Fernando Valley. The amusing prologue (narrated by Jay) talks about amazing coincidences, but the film that unfolds afterward is anything but coincidental; instead, the myriad relationships and occurrences are defined by interconnectivity, decisions affected by the long accumulation of pain, the impalpable lessons learned through sorrow and regret, and an almost biblical sense of punishment and forgiveness. There are no slackers in this ensemble cast, some of whom get their big, showy moments (Moore’s breakdown at the pharmacy, Cruise’s misogynistic motivational speaker routines that teach sleazy pickup-artist techniques, Macy’s “I have lots of love to give” declaration), and some of whom get to be quietly sublime (nurse Hoffman’s altruism, Blackman telling his father he needs to be nicer to him). Yet despite all the misery on hand, Anderson doesn’t forget to inject a lot of sly humor into the mix to lighten the load (“And, Phil, I will drop-kick the f—ing dogs if they come near me”). The controversial climax won’t be for all tastes (it will have tremendous resonance for some, but be too far “out there” for others), and not all of Anderson’s artistic decisions completely work—the audacious “Wise Up” sing-along is a little too precious—but the film’s ambitions and emotional impact are staggering. Robards’ final film.\n\n89/100\n\nRENT/BUY\n\nJFK (1991)\n\nDirected by Oliver Stone. Starring Kevin Costner, Jay O. Sanders, Michael Rooker, Joe Pesci, Tommy Lee Jones, Sissy Spacek, Donald Sutherland, Laurie Metcalf, Kevin Bacon, Gary Oldman, Sally Kirkland, Wayne Knight, Lolita Davidovich, John Candy, Jack Lemmon, Brian Doyle-Murray, Ed Asner, Roy Barnitt, Bob Gunton. [R]\n\nCrackling, controversial film detailing the fallout of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, and the righteous crusade that New Orleans DA Jim Garrison (Costner) undertakes to seek out the truth and bring the men responsible to justice (or, at the very least, into the public eye). A hoard of information—speculative and factual—presented as a collage of debates, theories, and incidents in the package of a riveting drama, at a frenzied pace that makes the three-plus hours fly by in a whirlwind of indignation, discovery, paranoia and coercion. Brilliantly directed and assembled for clarity in the big picture, bewilderment in the specifics (as all conspiracy theories are shaped), benefiting immensely from the creation of a “Mr. X” character (Sutherland) who is on hand to organize, theorize, and deliver a knockout extended monologue, as well as the wise casting choice of earnest, all-American Costner to represent a nation’s doubts and outrages. Not a film that aspires to firmly declare exactly what happened and what parties were responsible, but one that articulates a bevy of suspicions and makes it clear that there was some sort of conspiracy involving numerous corrupt individuals and/or groups. Robert Richardson’s eclectic photography and Joe Hutshing and Pietro Scalia’s editing won Academy Awards. Extremely deep and talented cast also includes cameos from Walter Matthau, Vincent D’Onofrio, Frank Whaley, Martin Sheen (narration only), and the real Jim Garrison (briefly appearing as Earl Warren).\n\n93/100\n\nRENT/BUY\n\nThe Right Stuff (1983)\n\nDirected by Philip Kaufman. Starring Sam Shepard, Dennis Quaid, Ed Harris, Fred Ward, Scott Glenn, Pamela Reed, Barbara Hershey, Veronica Cartwright, Levon Helm, Scott Paulin, Charles Frank, Lance Henriksen, Harry Shearer, Jeff Goldblum, Mary Jo Deschanel, Kathy Baker, Kim Stanley, Jane Dornacker, Donald Moffat. [PG]\n\nSpectacular saga examining the mythology of America’s reach toward the future during the space race (breaking the sound barrier, manned spaceflight in NASA’s Program Mercury, etc.), and the pioneering test pilots that made it all happen. Based on the Tom Wolfe book, the scope that iconoclastic writer/director Kaufman strives for seems almost unfathomable for a feature film, supported by an exhilarating visual canvas and window-rattling sound mixing/editing for an immersive experience when those rockets roar and supersonic planes soar. But ambitions to parallel those of aeronautical history and scintillating visceral pleasures aren’t what put this one over the top; it’s the combined sheer accessibility and walloping entertainment value that does. No matter how much jargon or hardware gets tossed around, the pic never once becomes confusing or overwhelming or bogs down in dry technical detail. Nor does the awesome size of the film dwarf the humanity and personalities of the characters, as each of the main pilots—Chuck Yeager (Shepard), John Glenn (Harris), Alan Shepard (Glenn), etc.—gets drawn with finely-tuned characteristics, and the supporting players are given broad strokes to be supportive, eccentric, clownish, etc. Alternates among gripping, breathtaking, hysterical, and inspiring with tremendous ease, and manages to be the rare three-hour-plus epic that begs for even more. Blends thrills with poetry, jocular satire with grand romance, all while achieving a grandeur so rarely attempted—it’s a truly special film, despite those reasonable-but-grouchy reservations that it sometimes makes a mockery of black-and-white historical record. Won Academy Awards for the editing, sound, and sound effects teams, plus one for Bill Conti’s triumphant score. The real-life Yeager cameos; President Eisenhower’s voice is provided by an uncredited Kevin Pollak.\n\n97/100\n\nRENT/BUY\n\nFanny and Alexander (1982)\n\nDirected by Ingmar Bergman. Starring Ewa Fröling, Jan Malmsjö, Bertil Guve, Gunn Wållgren, Allan Edwall, Erland Josephson, Jarl Kulle, Mona Malm, Kerstin Tidelius, Pernilla Allwin, Stina Ekblad, Gunnar Björnstrand, Harriet Andersson, Mats Bergman. [R]\n\nSumptuous, sprawling family saga from writer/director Bergman (intended to be his final film) wields hope and darkness with a serpentine grace that creeps up quietly but forcibly. Indeed, first-timers may grow restless in the early-going that ambles through indistinct vignettes of a well-off Swedish family, as Bergman seems more interested in ribaldry than telling an actual story (even focusing most of the attention on characters that will have limited importance later on), but once the pieces start locking in place, the observations of young Alexander (Guve) sharpen on his remarried mother (Fröling) and the strict and imperious bishop (Malmsjö) who has become his stepfather. Weaves supernatural elements of magic, spirits, and layered realities into the fabric of the classic strained-family dynamic so smoothly that it never threatens to spill into the incredible or the overwrought. Sven Nykvist’s keenly-lit and richly-textured photography is masterful, as always, and Anna Asp’s set design/dressing and Marik Vos-Lundh’s costuming are first-rate (all three won Academy Awards); also won for Best Foreign Language Film from the same group, setting a record for most total Oscar wins for a foreign-language feature, tied twice since (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Parasite). Initially conceived and released in Bergman’s homeland as a five-hour-plus television miniseries, it was later edited down to around three-and-a-quarter hours for international cinematic release. Lena Olin and Peter Stormare have small roles.\n\n91/100\n\nRENT/BUY\n\nReds (1981)\n\nDirected by Warren Beatty. Starring Warren Beatty, Diane Keaton, Maureen Stapleton, Jerzy Kosinski, Jack Nicholson, Paul Sorvino, Edward Herrmann, Nicholas Coster, Gene Hackman, William Daniels, Ian Wolfe, Bessie Love, M. Emmet Walsh, George Plimpton, Max Wright. [PG]\n\nBeatty’s sprawling, passionate presentation of radical writer and journalist John Reed’s experiences chronicling the Russian Revolution and serving as a propagandist for the left wing socialist movement. A lot of time (too much, in fact) is spent on his romance with society gal Louise Bryant (Keaton)—including a love triangle with playwright Eugene O’Neil (Nicholson)—but since the personal perspective comes from the debate of rhetoric, this story is a revolution of ideas rather than actions, so three-plus hours of speeches, arguments, and article-writing would have grown tedious fast without it (it sometimes does with it, or at the very least, repetitive). Beatty won Best Director at the Academy Awards, his greatest feat being the conception of the framing sequences, which involve talking-head “witnesses” to the real Reed providing running commentary that informs, amuses, contradicts, and explains (their ranks include ACLU co-founder Roger Nash Baldwin, social activist Dora Russell, Congressman Hamilton Fish, and writer Henry Miller); he also produced and co-wrote. The second half plays out with more vigor, which is a rare feat for epics long enough to be separated by intermissions, but that vigor is at the service of more traditional storytelling, including sweeping shots of Reed running across a field while a skirmish rages around him and of Bryant traveling across a tundra to reunite with the man she loves; by that point, bring back the angry-bohos-in-a-coffee-house schtick. Also won Oscars for Maureen Stapleton (bringing much-needed warmth to the political grind as anarchist Emma Goldman) and Vittorio Storaro’s camerawork.\n\n72/100\n\nRENT/BUY\n\nRyan’s Daughter (1970)\n\nDirected by David Lean. Starring Sarah Miles, Robert Mitchum, Christopher Jones, Leo McKern, Trevor Howard, John Mills, Barry Foster, Gerald Smith, Evin Crowley, Marie Kean, Arthur O’Sullivan. [PG]\n\nFollowing up the likes of Doctor Zhivago and Lawrence of Arabia, director Lean was still in “epic” mode when he helmed this mammoth production without the plot or excitement to fill it. Robert Bolt’s screen story is little more than a lumbering love triangle—Irish lass Miles marries simple, quiet schoolteacher Mitchum, then begins an affair with haunted soldier Jones (and goodness knows why, considering how dull he is, from a performance that can best be described as “tortured oak”); all the other sub-plots and side characters are embroidery, and no one knows when to cut the threads already. While overlength and inexcusable proportions are a major issue, the weakness of its central interest is just as problematic, especially the particulars of the sudden, supposedly-passionate infidelity—Miles and Jones’ soggy forest lovemaking, replete with “symbolic” dandelion spores blown away to feather the surface of a pond, is only a couple degrees removed from sparkly vampire territory. An impressive storm sequence and Freddie Jones’ sweeping, Oscar-winning photography are among the few virtues. Playing a parish priest, Howard is the only member of the cast to do noteworthy work, even though Mills scored an Academy Award playing the village idiot (as a prime example of an Oscar bait role, it’s nothing to write home about). When it comes to romantic torment in Lean’s hands, stick to the much, much better and much, much shorter Brief Encounter.\n\n35/100\n\nRENT/BUY\n\nHeaven’s Gate (1980)\n\nDirected by Michael Cimino. Starring Kris Kristofferson, Christopher Walken, Isabelle Huppert, John Hurt, Sam Waterston, Jeff Bridges, Brad Dourif, Richard Masur, Geoffrey Lewis, Joseph Cotten, Paul Koslo, Terry O’Quinn, Ronnie Hawkins, Tom Noonan, Mickey Rourke. [R]\n\nThe rambling, ambitious Western epic of European immigrants in Wyoming defending themselves against the murderous oppression of a syndicate of rich and powerful cattle barons that became the laughing-stock cinematic turkey of its time. Not quite as bad as that initial reputation suggested—the period detail, location scenery, and photography from the masterful Vilmos Zsigmond all work in the film’s favor—but the story, characters, relationships, and motivations are all so murky and confused that the viewer is left to simply watch things happen without anything to carry them through each scene, some of which are staggeringly overextended (and even unnecessary), like the dizzying graduation waltz, the rollerskating/fiddling sequence, the baseball game, and so on. The whole thing finally comes to a head more than three hours later with a dust-clogged final battle that frequently turns to chaos without passionate rooting interest in the outcome or clearly-delineated lines between the clashing sides, and honestly, the battle against boredom that preceded it was more interesting. In fact, there’s so little of interest happening here that the story of the film’s failure and the consequences to come are more worthy of ink and analysis; like how giving out-of-control director Cimino carte blanche to craft his “personal” opus signaled the end of the director-driven New Hollywood, how its catastrophic box office resulted in the bankruptcy of a major studio (United Artists), how it was so disastrously received that it was pulled from release after a week and re-edited by removing about a third of the running time, how accusations of animal abuse and cruelty were so rampant that it directly led to the American Humane Association being contractually authorized to oversee all US media that made use of animals, and how it has been reappraised in some circles today as being a stealthy near-masterpiece all along (hey, “interesting” doesn’t always mean “convincing”).\n\n33/100\n\nRENT/BUY\n\nOnce Upon a Time in America (1984)\n\nDirected by Sergio Leone. Starring Robert De Niro, James Woods, Tuesday Weld, Elizabeth McGovern, Treat Williams, Scott Tiler, Rusty Jacobs, James Hayden, William Forsythe, Joe Pesci, Burt Young, Danny Aiello, Darlanne Fluegel, Jennifer Connelly, Larry Rapp, Amy Ryder, Richard Bright, Julie Cohen, Robert Harper, James Russo. [R]\n\nLeone’s final film is a complex and haunting crime epic tracing the rise and fall of four Jewish gangsters, friends since their days as hooligan youths in New York’s Lower East Side during the early part of the twentieth century. Long, moody and elegiac, but compelling from start to finish, full of promises and betrayals, the destructive influence of greed and the deterioration of honor, the triumphs of the viciously amoral and the lamentations of the ruefully introspective. Adapted from a Harry Grey novel (“The Hoods”), Leone tells the sprawling story as a melancholy reflection—some even argue for the interpretation that the lion’s share of the film is nothing more than an opium dream of a mobster imagining the childhood that was and the middle-age to be—laid out in a chronological disarray that’s likely to make the early passages hard to follow for the uninitiated; but it’s a unique spell that he casts, setting it apart from the lengthy catalogs of operatic gangster stories and examinations of the seamier side of America’s legacy. Beautifully detailed production spanning five decades, strikingly photographed by Tonino Delli Colli on both real New York locations and back-lot recreations in Rome, filled with Ennio Morricone’s majestically morose music. Hacked to pieces and rearranged for its initial US wide release; only on home video did Leone’s original nearly-four-hour cut see the light of day outside of Europe and the early sneak previews (an extended director’s cut restoring an additional twenty-plus minutes makes for perhaps an even richer and more rewarding experience). Connelly’s film debut.\n\n94/100\n\nRENT/BUY\n\nLove Exposure (2008)\n\nDirected by Sion Sono. Starring Takahiro Nishijima, Hikari Mitsushima, Sakura Andô, Atsuro Watabe, Makiko Watanabe, Tasuku Nagaoka, Hiroyuki Onoue, Yutaka Shimizu, Sô Hirosawa, Yûko Genkaku, Mami Nakamura.\n\nAn outrageous, long-winded, yet strangely profound film that constantly pulls off the unexpected (usually in a good way). The story—which cannot be adequately described in a sentence or two—focuses most of its boundless energy on a bizarre love triangle among gleefully sinning Catholic teenager Yû (Nishijima), his androphobic “Maria” that he instantly falls in love with (Mitsushima), and a psychotic cult member with a twisted past (Andô), but let’s not forget about all the rampant religious symbolism and fetishism, the interludes involving guerrilla upskirt photography and the skeeviest perverts in all the land, physics-defying fight scenes and blood spray aplenty, kidnapping and cross-dressing and brainwashing and castration and so on. Writer/director Sono’s flamboyant filmcraft, fearless imagery, and subversive attitudes all operate on translucent tiers, never feeling like just an empty exercise in bombast or heavy-handed pandering to its debauched message—at it’s heaviest, the filmmaking is charged with electricity, and at it’s most bizarre and excess-drenched, there’s purpose and payoff on the way. The fact that the plot and energy almost fill out all four hours is quite the achievement unto itself, and even when the melodrama inevitably tips too far into the realm of shock cinema from time to time, there’s no doubt that nearly every flaw and triumph in store for the viewer is going to stick around for a while afterward. If you’re wondering how a breakneck pace can be established for so much of the film’s extended running time, be aware that Sono and crew excised about two hours of material from the original cut just to get it down to the current length!\n\n83/100\n\nRENT/BUY\n\nCleopatra (1963)\n\nDirected by Joseph L. Mankiewicz & Rouben Mamoulian. Starring Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, Rex Harrison, Roddy McDowall, Hume Cronyn, Martin Landau, Andrew Keir, George Cole, Carroll O’Connor, Gwen Watford, Richard O’Sullivan, Robert Stephens, Kenneth Haigh, Cesare Danova, Pamela Brown, Grégoire Aslan.\n\nOne of the most expensive films of the 20th century (costing close to $300 million when adjusted for inflation) has no shortage of eye-filling spectacle, and nearly bankrupted a studio bringing it to the big screen, but whether viewed on a big screen or small, this inexcusably bloated epic is such a lumbering and idiotic extravaganza that it all gets suffocated by overkill. Starts reasonably well, with Harrison giving the only worthwhile performance in the film as Julius Caesar, but after an hour or so, all the intrigue and opulence starts wearing thin; an hour later and Caesar is dead and it looks like a good spot to wrap it up and roll the credits…but that’s just the intermission—there’s another two hours to go! The technical credits deserve acclaim (the sets, costumes, photography and visual effects all won Oscars), but the decadence is ill-served without restraint, and the intimate aspects of the characters and storylines are always distracted by the proverbial wallpaper. Taylor is lackluster in the title role, (a glaring case of miscasting; even ignoring the fact that she’s too old, she’s simply not right for the part), which is weakly written, focusing far too much on her seductive, power-hungry qualities rather than the far more intelligent and socially ambitious accomplishments of her life; she also barely even qualifies as the main character in her own story, with both halves of the film dominated by the two major men in her life. Instead, one walks (or limps) away from the movie only really remembering her for her sixty-plus costume changes; not much of a legacy in Hollywood’s hands. McDowall’s hammy performance as Octavian provides some camp value, but does anyone want to numb their backsides waiting to get to a few choice moments?\n\n36/100\n\nRENT/BUY\n\n1900 (1976)\n\nDirected by Bernardo Bertolucci. Starring Robert De Niro, Gérard Depardieu, Dominique Sanda, Donald Sutherland, Laura Betti, Sterling Hayden, Francesca Bertini, Romolo Valli, Burt Lancaster, Stefania Casini, Stefania Sandrelli, Paolo Pavesi, Roberto Maccanti, Anna Henkel-Grönemeyer, Ellen Schwiers, Alida Valli. [NC-17]\n\nThe tale “as old as time” of two lifelong friends/enemies from different social classes born on the same day and in the same region (a lowborn bastard and the wealthy padrone’s grandson) told over the decades-spanning backdrop of political upheaval in Italy during the first half of the twentieth century—peasants vs. landowners, communists vs. fascists. Bertolucci’s determined stab at crafting a sweeping epic falls short on the “sweeping” part, and makes the “epic” part feel downright oppressive at times; Vittorio Storaro’s camera captures sumptuous sights, but it records when it should involve, while the characters are too often vaguely defined and the political statements are ungainly. “Spiced up” with periodic perversions and cruelties for the sake of muddled shock value, suggesting that the filmmakers didn’t have confidence in the storytelling alone to hold attention and make its points. Sloppy choices abound in the selection of the international cast, which makes hardly any effort to sync their performances; De Niro’s New York accent distracts often, as does the voice dubbing throughout many of the supporting players. Delivers a handful of affecting vignettes, but not nearly enough to sustain itself for more than five hours. The coldly elegant radiance of Ennio Morricone’s score is among the few truly noteworthy aspects of this frustratingly uneven and overlong film. The original Italian title is Novocento, which is more fitting since the story takes place in the 1900s, and no scenes are set in the actual year 1900 (the main characters are born in 1901).\n\n52/100\n\nRENT/BUY\n\nNapoléon (1927)\n\nDirected by Abel Gance. Starring Albert Dieudonné, Edmond Van Daële, Alexandre Koubitzky, Antonin Artaud, Gina Manès, Marguerite Gance, Philippe Hériat, Abel Gance, Vladimir Roudenko, Annabella, Yvette Dieudonné, Nicolas Koline, Max Maxudian, Maurice Schutz, Suzy Vernon, Francine Mussey.\n\nImmense silent epic sees director Gance pull out all the stops in telling the story of the legendary French political and military leader, tracing his path from military school as a youth to his triumphant first campaign against Italy in 1797. The daunting length practically begs for breaks—being presented in four separate parts makes it easy to pick the moments—and it still drags during a few less fruitful intervals that pull focus too far from the central storyline (to say nothing for the artiste statements made through heavy-handed symbolism). But it’s still an astonishing achievement that employs a lot of advanced camera tricks, post-production compositing (particularly multiple exposure effects), and breathlessly-edited sequences that heighten the drama and break up the traditional wide-to-close shot transitions that made so many early cinematic sagas so static. Numerous highlights across its five-and-a-half hour runtime, with the juxtaposition between the swinging camera inside the assembly hall during a political uproar and a ship being tossed by waves on the stormy sea being one of the most visually electrifying sequences of its era, but the two most memorable scenes arguably come near the very beginning (the snowball fight, handheld camera pursuing its maneuvering combatants) and the end (the extended and pioneering Cinerama-esque widescreen triptych sequence). Gance had planned on making five (!) more films about Napoléon to cover the rest of the historical figure’s life, but they proved impossible to finance. Restored and re-released at varying lengths about two dozen times over the last 90+ years; this review refers to the long-awaited DVD/Blu-Ray release painstakingly assembled by film historian Kevin Brownlow, with a Carl Davis score.\n\n88/100\n\nRENT/BUY\n\nLittle Dorrit (1987)\n\nDirected by Christine Edzard. Starring Sarah Pickering, Derek Jacobi, Alec Guinness, Cyril Cusack, Miriam Margolyes, Patricia Hayes, Max Wall, Joan Greenwood, Roshan Seth, Amelda Brown, Robert Morley, Daniel Chatto, John McEnery, Bill Fraser, Pauline Quirke, Luke Duckett, Mollie Maureen. [G]\n\nNothing “little” about it; this mammoth adaptation of Charles Dickens’ equally mammoth novel, a sociopolitical satire of the caste system and imprisoned debtors, takes a questionable structural route and employs a large enough cast of Brits to almost make the Harry Potter franchise look quaint. The nearly six-hour film was initially split and released as two parts (under the subtitles Nobody’s Fault and Little Dorrit’s Story)—the recommended way to watch the picture—but essentially tells the same story in both halves, just from different perspectives; first, through the eyes of Jacobi’s Arthur Clennan, a well-meaning but overly meek pushover with a penchant for bad investments, and then from the point of view of Pickering’s “Little” Amy Dorrit, the waifish, almost saintly daughter of a debt-ridden egotist superbly played by Guinness. Pity that these replayed events don’t come with vigor, since the whole thing is a laggard, stodgy affair, begging for the sort of break from the static visual treatment and oft-gloomy lighting that might make this trumped-up “PBS teleplay” feel properly cinematic. Not without its vivid and fascinating moments, and fine performances from several cast members, but it’s likely to become an ordeal for anyone not enamored with the author and source material long before that previously-endorsed intermission. Pickering’s first and only screen performance.\n\n61/100\n\nRENT/BUY\n\nCheck back in a few days for the next update!"
