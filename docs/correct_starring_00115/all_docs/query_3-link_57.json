        "text": "For a Few Dollars More (1965, Italy)\n\nWith my viewing of For a Few Dollars More, I have now completed Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy and all four of his most important Spaghetti Westerns. After the sometimes-messy A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More felt like a true prelude to the final film of that trilogy: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Again starring Clint Eastwood as the Man With No Name and Lee Van Cleef and with an intelligently-spotted score by Ennio Morricone, Leone's sophomore effort is a few steps and a skip ahead of its predecessor. It is dirtier, wetter, more bloody, and far more violent than A Fistful of Dollars.\n\nThe tight-lipped Man with No Name (referred to as, \"Manco\" in this film) and Colonel Douglas Mortimer (Van Cleef) are pursuing a man named \"El Indio\" (Gian Maria Volonte) for different reasons. Manco is solely seeking the $10,000 on his head plus the additional legal tender that would also be secured with the capture or deaths of El Indio's followers. Mortimer is motivated by pure and simple revenge. I won't divulge the nature of his grievances, but they all center around the appearances of a musical pocketwatch - lending the film its more dramatic weight. How Morricone will go on to score the pocketwatch scenes and make a final combination with Manco's theme is ingenious and such a technique will appear again in his work for Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West.\n\nMortimer has been seen by one of El Indio's henchmen nicknamed The Humpback (famed German actor Klaus Kinski) and surmises that Manco should somehow insert himself within El Indio's band in order to figure out the man's next moves. Though this sounds a bit one-sided and is portrayed as a bit one-sided in the film, the outcome never really is in any doubt. Speaking of predictability, when Mortimer's reasons for revenge against El Indio are revealed, his actions become rather too foreseeable.\n\nUnlike a vast majority of American Westerns, a Leone Spaghetti Western is not plot-driven. So for those accustomed to plot continuity - linear and non-linear - Leone's four major Spaghetti Westerns may seem difficult to follow at first. That is because these films are situation-driven and For a Few Dollars More is no exception to that rule. It was never Leone's intention to make the Dollars trilogy a trilogy - especially considering the unrelatedness to each of the three plots. For a Few Dollars More doesn't see its plot get going until near the halfway point of the film as it shows Manco, Mortimer, and El Indio all performing unrelated activities - bounty hunting and murderous bank robbing - before they all converge. It almost feels coincidental and one would be lying if they said that doesn't work for this film or any of Leone's works.\n\nA passing mention should be made about the hat-shooting scene. That is one hell of a way to get the two of some of the most ludicrously accurate in the West to be acquainted with each other. But boy, does it add to the legend and boy... does it work.\n\nThis and A Fistful of Dollars seemed to more heavily rely on tropes within the Western genre to advance their situation-driven narratives. Both films would gladly play upon these cliches and would overcook them to help define what Spaghetti Westerns would be known for - borderline-nihilistic violence preceded by interminable standoffs accompanied by a forgivably anachronistic musical score (electric guitars in the Old West? Of course!).\n\nMorricone's music - when listened to independently of the film and without knowledge of each musical spot's context - seem so displaced, so extreme, and unplayable in a concert hall. Yet, due to the fact Spaghetti Westerns seem so displaced and extreme... the embellished score works. And because it works in context, it indeed could be concert hall material. Well, it's embellished to a point. If one listens to the haunting musical pocketwatch melody, listen to the simplicity of that music and note how well that is married to the images on film. That little, minor-key theme instantly found itself among the greatest uses of diegetic film music ever.\n\nWhenever he worked with Leone, most of Morricone's scores served the film first, music for music's sake second. Morricone - more than some film score composers - must work with his directors quite well considering the musical intelligence of so many of the films he has scored.\n\nPerhaps a reason why For a Few Dollars More outranks A Fistful of Dollars was because the latter was based on Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo and Sanjuro (The Man with No Name was based on the samurai with no name in both those films, played by Toshiro Mifune). Somehow jidaigeki films are disserviced when plagiarized into a Western setting. Leone released himself from that influence and began to truly embrace the spirit of the Revisionist Western.\n\nCinematographer Massimo Dallamano and Leone further perfect the widescreen landscape shots (apparently vast portions of Spain look quite a bit like the American West) and are more successful in those landscape shots' juxtaposition with Leone's famous extreme closeups. Those closeups broke cardinal rules in the rules of CinemaScope - an anamorphic lens which enabled widescreen formats for the first time\n\nIncredibly fun, yet incredibly aware of classic Western cliches, For a Few Dollars More is a tight, even more sprawling entry to the Dollars trilogy than its predecessor.\n\nIt's no discreet film, but the reasons it is such a great film could be.\n\nMy rating: 8.5/10"
