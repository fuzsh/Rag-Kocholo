        "text": "Why is it that a passenger airliner with 190 people onboard can crash into a corn field killing everyone and it is soon forgotten. Yet a small plane plummets to earth and kills the few people onboard and 30 years later songs are being written about it. The answer is simple. Just as in the way just about anything a celebrity can do or say will be reported in the news, its is often the case when they died, especially when it is unexpected, such as in a plane crash.\n\nBelow are some plane crashes that were unremarkable and would have soon been forgotten if not for the people who died onboard the plane. At the time, the crashes were investigated and documented, the nation (or fans) mourned the lost and the world went on. Nobody is missing and in most cases, the sites are well known. In doing the research for this we came across many more \"celebrities\" then we expected. So consider this the \"Short List.\"\n\n(Note to Newspaper Journalist: You are given permission to use information from this page as a sidebar for a story but please include a link to the site.)\n\nHere they are, listed by date.\n\nApril 19, 2006: Famed test pilot Albert Scott Crossfield 84, died when his single-engine Cessna 210A encountered heavy thunderstorms and crashed in a heavily forested gully about 10 miles from Ranger, Georgia.

When they refueled in Greenville, South Carolina on the 20th, they compounded this error by believing they had more fuel than they really did. The airplane was also experiencing some mechanical difficulties which required the pilots to operate the right engine in the \"auto-rich\" position which burned fuel at an excessive rate. The combination of these problems resulted in nearly complete fuel exhaustion. The pilots changed course and headed for an airport near McComb, Mississippi but the plane stalled near Gillsburg, Mississippi and crashed in swampy woods.\n\nAugust 1, 1977: Francis Gary Powers 48, the American pilot of a U-2 spy plane shot down over the Soviet Union in 1960, and his cameraman were killed when his Bell 206 Jetranger helicopter crashed in Balboa Park on the way back from covering a brush fire.

Reasons have been given for saying that other suggested causes were not really possible. Reasons have also been given for concluding that the approach was made by a visual descent procedure in which the aircraft was brought too low.
