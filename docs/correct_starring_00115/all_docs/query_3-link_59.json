        "text": "Joey rose to fame as a Top 40 disk jockey and radio personality during these decades. After Ohio came Wheeling, West Virginia and Miami, Florida where he worked with Larry King. Still in the early ‘60s, he shuffled back to Buffalo where WBNY program director Arnie Schorr gave Joey his “all-American” surname of Reynolds!\n\nDuring this era, Joey amassed huge audiences in Hartford, Buffalo, Cleveland, Detroit, and Philadelphia. He was recognized as Billboard Magazine’s DJ of the Year three times and twice named The Gavin Report’s Top 40 DJ of the Year. Often regarded as the originator of \"shock-jock radio,” he garnered widespread publicity for outlandish on-air and off-air stunts. He’s still remembered for locking himself into a WPOP studio and playing “Sherry” by the Four Seasons for hours on end. Police were called as a safety precaution due to the local hysteria.\n\nAs a thank you for promoting their music, Four Seasons’ producer Bob Krewe arranged for the group to re-record “Big Girls Don’t Cry” as a special radio jingle for Joey. He’s been a friend to Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons ever since and used the theme to introduce his radio show for decades.\n\nDuring his amazing ratings run at WKBW in Buffalo, Joey and fellow DJ Danny Neaverth recorded the novelty single \"Rats in My Room\" on the same US record label that released “She Loves You” by a then unknown group from Liverpool, England named the Beatles.\n\nIn a twist of fate, Reynolds and Neaverth, were offered the chance to bring the Beatles to Buffalo Memorial Auditorium on February 10, 1964, the day after the band’s debut on the Ed Sullivan Show for what would have been their first concert performance in North America. Unwilling to risk a $3,500 appearance fee for an unknown act on a Monday night in typically snow-laden weather with no guarantee of ticket sales - the two declined the offer. It wasn’t until after Beatlemania swept the nation that the mistake was acknowledged. In three years of touring North America, the Beatles never performed in Buffalo. In a counter twist, shortly after the incident, Joey became lifelong friends with legendary promoter Sid Bernstein, the man credited with bringing the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and other major British Invasion acts, to America.\n\nAfter Wayne Newton and a few years off the airwaves, the radio bug eventually bit again in a big way. To start the decade, there were “hired gun” week or month-long stints on LA radio stations that culminated in the syndicated Satellite Live – the first satellite radio show in the world. The weekly Sunday night broadcast, syndicated on over 60 stations nationally, featured major Hollywood stars. Concurrently, he was signed by KOA in Denver to host another radio first - All Night Live - the first radio and TV simulcast. The five-hour long, Monday through Friday, overnight show - syndicated nationally on more than 35 radio stations – was groundbreaking but proved to be ahead of its time and was shuttered after a year.\n\nFollowing a short hiatus, Joey began a series of “roadshow” appearances, contracted for short stints across the country (and Canada) by stations looking for a ratings bump or a programming shake up. One of those stints in 1984 led to his return to Philadelphia as the morning host on WFIL. While there, he famously kicked-off an impromptu 37-1/2 hour fund-raising marathon netting over $100,000 for famine-stricken Ethiopia. He was honored by being named one of Billboard Magazine’s “Personality of the Year” award winners that year.\n\nIn 1986, he returned to 66 WNBC but this time as the sole “afternoon drive” host — replacing Howard Stern in a line-up that included Don Imus and Soupy Sales. “W-Nnnnnn…BC” had moved towards a talk-intensive, full-service format, with music taking a backseat. The shows featured Reynolds as the ringleader with lots of A-List guests, playing a few adult contemporary hits and comedy skits from Joey and his talented ensemble. Notably, the show was on the air live when the station's traffic helicopter crashed into the Hudson River tragically killing actress/comedian/traffic reporter Jane Dornacker. Reynolds exited WNBC in March of 1987. That spring he was the focus of a two-part series on The Oprah Winfrey Show about talk radio personalities that included more than a dozen of Reynolds' media peers paying tribute. By late summer, he landed again, this time in Miami – 27 years after his first foray there.\n\nTo start the new millennium, Reynolds' published his career memoir - Let a Smile Be Your Umbrella, But Don’t Get a Mouthful of Rain - the title coming from his signature radio sign-off. A second book followed titled The Ultimate Cheesecake Cookbook - a result of his successful mail-order cheesecake business. Joey also signed a distribution deal with Bloomingdale's for the premium desserts!\n\nHe received two distinctly New York City honors in 2006. That November, he was recognized by NYU for his career of \"Entertaining and Enlightening, Discovering and Nurturing Young Talent, and Improving the Human Condition\" - a far cry from his days as the original \"shock jock.\" A month later, he was selected as Little Italy's Man of the Year!\n\nHe closed the decade with another prestigious music award. The Buffalo Music Hall of Fame honored Joey by inducting him in 2009 for his impact on the region.\n\nIn March 2010, WOR announced a programming shift that led to the cancellation of The Joey Reynolds Show after a fourteen-year run. The last show was humorously divided into the \"Final Gay Hour,\" the \"Final Jewish Hour\" and \"The Final Hour;\" it aired the morning of April 3, 2010.\n\nReynolds didn’t miss a beat and was back on the air by the following January. He began hosting a unique talk/variety TV program called All Night with Joey Reynolds on WNBC-DT2, the digital sub-channel of television station WNBC-TV billed as \"New York Nonstop.\" The two-hour nightly show was broadcast live from the ground floor of the NASDAQ building in Times Square at 43rd Street and Broadway. Reynolds was reunited with former WNBC radio sidekick, Jay Sorensen, as the program's announcer/sidekick. The weeknight series ended on April 25, 2011.\n\nThe summer of 2013 saw Joey featured in the film ‘Evocateur: The Morton Downey Jr. Movie’ about the life and times of his old friend who passed away in 2001. Mort was Joey's roommate when the pair worked together at WNDR Syracuse in the early sixties. They continued to collaborate on various projects over four decades.\n\nJoey Reynolds is one of America's most beloved radio personalities. Spinning records as a teenager in Buffalo, New York, Joey quickly became one of the trendsetters of early rock radio. From Miami to Philly, to Detroit to New York, wherever Joey went, his show as always at the top of the charts. After a detour to Hollywood and a long battle with the bottle, Joey's career went into a long, slow slide. Filled with humorous anecdotes and stories of the many celebrities and rock stars Joey has met, this is the story of a man whose rise, fall, and rise again was fueled by the power of laughter. After finding sobriety, Joey bounced back as always. He went on to have the number one rated overnight radio talk show in the country. His \"stream of consciousness\" style, and sense of humor, are winning new fans every day."
