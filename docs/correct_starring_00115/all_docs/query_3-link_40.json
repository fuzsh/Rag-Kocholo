        "text": "Vegas in Space\n\nDoris Fish, Miss X (screenwriters, starring)\n\nPhillip R. Ford (director, screenwriter)\n\nGinger Quest, Tippi, Ramona Fischer (starring)\n\nLos Angeles: Troma Inc., 1993. Vintage postcard announcement for an exclusive 1993 screening of the 1991 film at the Landmark Nuart Theatre in Los Angeles, Friday, August 27 through Thursday, September 2, 1993. Recto features a glossy, black-and-white photograph of the film's stars, theatrical drag troupe the Sluts a Go Go, including Doris Fish, Miss X, Tippi, Ginger Quest, Romona Fischer, and Lori Naslund.\n\nCampy and outrageous, and often proclaimed the \"Greatest Drag Movie ever made!,\" the plot features three male space travelers who must become women via sex reversal pills in order to pose as showgirls from earth to investigate a crime on the all female planet Clitoris.\n\nFormed in 1979 by legendary Australian drag queen Doris Fish (Philip Clargo Mills), the Sluts a Go Go were a theatrical drag troupe starring Fish and fellow drag queens Miss X (Dalton Bradley Chandler II) and Tippi, as well as an evolving variety of other prominent San Francisco drag queens (including Jane Dornacker, Ginger Quest, and Freda Lay), which performed under the moniker in various San Francisco clubs throughout the 1980s. Following their hit drag musicals \"Sluts a Go Go: A Play with Music\" (1980) and \"Blonde Sin\" (1980-1982), the troupe began working with director Phillip R. Ford on \"Vegas in Space\" in 1983, taking 18 months to complete principal photography. It took another eight years for Fish and Ford to gather enough funds to complete the movie, which was finally released in October, 1993, just a few months after both Fish and Tippi succumbed to complications from AIDS.\n\nA biography of Fish, \"Who does that bitch think she is? Doris Fish and the Rise of Drag,\" written by Craig Seligman, was published in 2023.\n\n6 x 4 inches on cardstock. Near Fine.\n\n[Book #161183]"
