At least one thespian death actually does match the legend (see if you can find it).\n\nSports figures are not included in this compilation, even though a great many of them have expired while doing their thing as the public watched.\n\nMoliere (died 21 February 1673)\n\nThis French playwright and actor-manager collapsed during the fourth performance of his newly penned Le Malade Imaginaire (The Hypochondriac).

Indeed, listeners reported that the writer, known for his incisive and sometimes stinging comments, seemed to have taken less than his usual part in the broadcast.\n\nJohnny Ace (died 25 December 1954)\n\nRhythm and blues recording star Johnny Ace died during a show he was giving in Houston, but did so offstage. During a five minute break, the singer was amusing himself with a game of Russian Roulette (one bullet in the chamber).

As they were topping up the cement, the level suddenly dropped eighteen inches. Fifteen minutes of excavating later, rescuers reached Burrus, but it was too late — he'd been crushed.\n\nRedd Foxx (died 11 October 1991)\n\nActor/comedian Redd Foxx underwent a heart attack on the set of The Royal Family, a new sitcom he was to appear in.

A blank fired from a .44 magnum revolver felled him. He died hours later in hospital. The metal tip of one of the dummy bullets had somehow pulled loose from its brass casing. When the dummies were unloaded and replaced with blanks, the metal tip remained behind in the gun's cylinder.
