        "text": "Lawrence Perlman ’60 • Distinguished Achievement\n\nMinnesota-based Control Data Corp., once at the vanguard of the computer industry, was slowly spinning into decline in the late 1980s as the market began shifting to microcomputers. It was near bankruptcy when Lawrence (Larry) Perlman ’60 was called upon to lead the troubled giant’s turnaround. After returning the company to profitability, he orchestrated separating Control Data into two separate entities: Ceridian Corporation, a leader in data services, and Control Data Systems, the successor to the computer business. Perlman took the helm of Ceridian. The restructuring led to a major increase in shareholder value for the former Control Data shareholders, and in recognition for his achievement Perlman was named by Corporate Report magazine as Minnesota’s CEO of the year for 1999.\n\nAs a strong and vocal advocate for women and minorities in the workplace, Perlman was a less-than-conventional businessman. He was the first CEO to testify to Congress in support of the Family Leave Act, which was opposed at the time by the leading business organizations. Responding to the criticism, he said “The way I see it, I’m clearly right if these groups think I am wrong.” He believed more women should hold top corporate positions and that all Americans should have access to jobs and economic security. To that end, he encouraged business to take the lead in the continuing education of the workforce. His commitment to these ideals helped earn him the NAACP Lifetime Achievement Award in 1999 and the first-ever award for Excellence in Corporate Diversity from Working Mother magazine in 2000.\n\nUnder the Clinton administration, Perlman chaired the 21st Century Workforce Commission, established in 1998 by Congress to address a critical shortage of workers in the disciplines of science, technology, engineering, and math. In 2008 he was among the first to be inducted into the Minnesota High Tech Association’s Science and Technology Hall of Fame. Jane Belau, a former Control Data Corp. vice president, noted, Larry “is that amazing combination of brains, energy and heart… a CEO whose vision included not just the success of his companies, but how [they] could contribute to … the important issues of mentorship, diversity, and fairness in the workplace.”\n\nPerlman continues to pursue his other passions: conservation, specifically in the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem; art (he is a longtime trustee of the Walker Art Center), and music (he also served on the board of the Minnesota Orchestra). As a Carleton trustee, 1986-1993 and 1998-2013, he tried to foster principles of governance that would strengthen and sustain Carleton’s future. He and his wife, Linda Peterson Perlman, received the William Carleton Medal in 2004 in recognition of their stewardship of the College.\n\n“Carleton transformed my life,” he said, “and I feel a responsibility to give back to it.” The Perlmans live in Jackson Hole, Wyoming and have two children, including Dr. David M. Perlman, ’89.\n\nFred Whiting ’60 • Distinguished Achievement\n\nFormer South Dakota legislator Fred Whiting has “spent much of his life looking out for others in the world, many of whom have no idea how much impact he has had on their lives,” says friend and former colleague Mark Barnett, a circuit court judge and former attorney general in Whiting’s home state.\n\nWhiting began his international odyssey by earning a graduate diploma in economics from the College of Europe in Bruges, Belgium. A year later he was teaching in a boarding school in a remote village in Nigeria as a member of the Peace Corps. Upon returning to the United States, he attended Yale Law School, graduating in 1966.\n\nWhiting’s international business career began in earnest as corporate development officer for Chromalloy Europe in the Netherlands, followed by a stint as general counsel for Sime Darby Berhad in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Within three years, he was asked to head Sime Darby International Tire Company in Manila (formerly B.F. Goodrich Philippines), growing rubber and manufacturing tires. Whiting was also president of the American Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines, steering the U.S. business community through the 1986 revolution that ended the Marcos regime.\n\nAfter Whiting’s return to South Dakota in1987, he turned to a life in politics and served in the state legislature for 10 years, serving as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee. But his effectiveness on the world stage was in demand; Whiting was sought by the U.S. State Department to serve as a business, economic, and political consultant. His international stewardship has continued through democracy–building training programs in 24 countries. His workshops from Afghanistan to Vietnam have strengthened local approaches to political governance, parliamentary reform, decentralization of government, international trade and tourism, business ethics, and private sector development.\n\nAlong with his international interests, Whiting has served on the boards of The Mount Rushmore Society, Rapid City Regional Hospital, The Nature Conservancy and The Journey Museum in Rapid City. His son David is a Foreign Service Officer with the U.S. State Department, currently serving in the Philippines.\n\nMichael Baum ’65 • Distinguished Achievement\n\nThere are certain qualities that mark an educator and scientist as exceptional. Among them: publication of peer-reviewed articles in respected journals, a strong history of outside funding for research, a reputation for training students who go on to achieve great success in the field, and a record of service to the academic institution. In the field of behavioral neuroendocrinology, Michael Baum ’65, a biology professor at Boston University since 1985, is such an individual.\n\nColleagues in his field—which examines how hormones regulate reproduction—describe Baum as the “pillar of the behavioral neuroendocrine scientific community” and “someone who has shown tremendous influence on the entire field.”\n\nBaum is modest about his accomplishments. His Carleton classmate and a co-chair of their 50th reunion, Sarah Hawthorne Jones, says, “When we were planning a meeting last summer, Mike mentioned he was unavailable during a certain week because he was going to Australia.” Only after pressing him further did he confide the purpose of his journey: to accept the prestigious Daniel S. Lehrman Lifetime Achievement Award from the Society for Behavioral Neuroendocrinology, one of the highest honors in the field.\n\nBaum’s research has important implications for human communication via pheromones, an underappreciated and sometimes controversial area of inquiry. More broadly, it is directly relevant to understanding human psychosexual differentiation and gender identity. “Mike’s work demonstrates how fundamental neuroanatomical, neuroendocrinological, and behavioral work, using animal model systems, can enhance our understanding of the human condition,” writes one nominator.\n\nA frequent lecturer and author of more than 200 articles and reviews, Baum is known for his focus, integrity, empathy, and warmth. Says another nominator, “Mike’s wisdom and judgment [have been] a guiding light for the field of behavioral neuroendocrinology for several decades; his excellence and demeanor have made him an exceptional mentor and role model for a generation of young scientists.”\n\nIn addition to his scientific accomplishments, Baum also enjoys performing with the Back Bay Chorale in Boston. He credits voice lessons during his student years for cultivating his lifelong interest in solo and choral singing.\n\nBaum and his wife, Catherine Snow, have one son.\n\nPenelope Brown ’65 • Distinguished Achievement\n\nAs a linguistic anthropologist, Dr. Penelope Brown has established herself as an international expert and leading researcher in cross-linguistic and cross-cultural studies of language, cognition, and human development. But it was her revolutionary theory of politeness, and the resulting book she co-authored and published in 1987 with her research collaborator and husband, Dr. Stephen Levinson, that served as a launching pad for new research in the field.\n\nHer studies of language in the Tzeltal Maya community in southern Mexico’s Chiapas region have spanned more than 40 years. As a former colleague explains it, Brown’s work has demonstrated “how preconceived notions of what is involved in language in general, and child language development in particular— based on research in Western, largely middle-class environments—need to be reconsidered and reevaluated.”\n\nMuch of her expertise was gained through painstaking field research in Chiapas. “The researcher has to be prepared to learn the language, spend a great deal of time in the community, then transcribe the speech, often with very little help, given the type of community in which this work often goes on. Finally, the data has to be glossed in terms of grammatical categories before the data can be analyzed,” notes a colleague. “Penny has done this for Tzeltal, and her work has provided a number of extremely important findings” in relation to syntactic and semantic development. In turn, that prompts questions about language universals and the language children start with and find easiest to learn.\n\nIn more recent years Brown began studying and comparing communicative development among children in the Mayan community with that of infants and children in the Rossel Island community of Papua New Guinea. Brown recently retired from her position at The Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in the Netherlands and now lives in England. She and her husband, Stephen, have one son. She also has two Carleton connections in her family: sister Amanda Brown Dill ’64 and nephew Kevin Dill ’92.\n\nDavid Goldstein ’65 • Distinguished Achievement\n\nThe importance of David Goldstein’s research, advocacy, and leadership in the field of diabetes care and understanding can’t be overstated. Most diabetics know their HbA1c number and use it to gauge how well they are controlling the disease. Goldstein’s more than 30 years of research makes this possible.\n\nIn the early 1980s Goldstein was an original investigator in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and was responsible for standardizing the tests for the multi-site study. “At about the same time he began working with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to utilize these standardization methods more widely in clinical laboratories in the United States. It is this latter effort that has expanded and made a huge impact around the world,” writes one nominator.\n\n“The beauty of this test . . . is that it can integrate glucose control over a period of weeks and months so that by testing every three to six months it can be used to determine how well patients are controlling their blood sugar. But in order to make sense of these values, it is necessary to establish standard procedures and norms—and this is the great contribution of David as the leader in the long, hard task of standardization,” another nominator writes. “The impact of his work on the lives of patients, health care, public health, and treatment development are continuing and expanding in the face of an epidemic of obesity and diabetes around the globe.” Since 1978 Goldstein has been at the University of Missouri–Columbia and the University of Missouri Health Sciences Center, where he is now a professor emeritus and continues medical student and resident physician teaching responsibilities. Goldstein has received numerous grants and won a number of awards for his research, and he has co-authored scores of articles on DCCT, pediatric endocrinology, and diabetes care and research.\n\nGoldstein and his wife, Jean Strandberg Goldstein ’66, live in Columbia, Missouri, and have two children and four grandchildren.\n\nHoward Tyner ’65 • Distinguished Achievement\n\nHoward Tyner’s 40-year career as a journalist started even before he came to Carleton: He was coeditor of his high school newspaper in Milwaukee. When he retired as vice president of news/editorial for Tribune Publishing in 2003, he had covered some of the most dramatic international stories of the 20th century and had also taken a giant step into the 21st century as a pioneer of media convergence.\n\nTyner earned a master’s degree at Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism in 1967 and landed a position with United Press International’s London bureau. Expecting to be there a year, he stayed for 10, covering Eastern and Central Europe following the 1968 Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia. After being hired in 1977 by the Chicago Tribune and working as a roving international correspondent for five years, he transferred to the Tribune’s Moscow bureau in 1982. By 1988, Jack Fuller, former publisher of the Tribune, writes that “Howard was the obvious choice to become the editor in charge of all the newspaper’s foreign and national coverage. . . . It is by no means always the case that a great correspondent becomes a great editor, but Howard made the transition almost instantaneously.”\n\nIn the early ’90s, Tyner recognized that newspapers would face tumultuous changes with the dawning of the Internet. “Long before most others on the editorial side of the industry, Howard recognized that the earth was shifting beneath our feet, that the newspaper as we had known it was an endangered entity and that those who cared about journalism and the American people’s right to know had to adjust to new ways of working,” writes one nominator. “Howard set about trying to find new approaches to doing journalism in a for-profit world.” Under his leadership, the Tribune was the first newspaper in the nation to go online, offering expansive coverage in many subject areas, high-tech design, and interactive user interfaces.\n\nThe Tribune received six Pulitzer Prizes, two Robert Kennedy awards, and numerous other citations under Tyner’s direction. In 2000 Tyner was named U.S. editor of the year by the National Press Foundation. He was a founding member of American Society of Newspaper Editors and served as president of World Press Institute.\n\nTyner and his wife, Jane, live in Evanston, Illinois.\n\nSusan Wadley ’65 • Distinguished Achievement\n\nA Carleton junior year abroad sent Susan Snow Wadley to India, and in some ways, she has not diverged from that path. Known as one of the premier anthropologists specializing in India, she is now the Ford Maxwell Professor of South Asian Studies at Syracuse University. She has published influential books and articles in her field and has been the recipient of numerous research grants.\n\nThat year in India shaped Wadley’s life. There she began researching girls’ education, and she has since continued to focus on women’s lives, their rituals, their religious stories, their creative expressions, and the ways in which transformations in Indian society have affected them. This has culminated in her recent work on female artists in the Mithila region of northern India.\n\n“As India has gained more prominence in the world over these past five decades, much of the work that might have once seemed remote has become increasingly important, and Professor Wadley’s expertise has been sought in many areas,” one nominator notes. “For a number of years she helped select Fulbright scholars to India; she continues to be a prominent speaker and panelist in national and international meetings.”\n\nAnother nominator takes a more esoteric look at Wadley’s work. “My personal assessment of Sue’s contribution has been in her ability to derive universal truth from lessons learned through the microscope of local cultures. By emphasizing the importance of local conditions in response to social change and conflict, her work has had an impact beyond academia. Her chosen issues of gender, individual freedom, and religious beliefs, combined with her eclectic inquisitiveness, intellectual rigor, and personal determination, have been an example and inspiration.”\n\nWadley currently chairs the board of directors for the South Asian Summer Language Institute and is chair of the publications committee of the American Institute of Indian Studies.\n\nWadley shares her Carleton connection with brother Calvin Wadley ’67. She and her partner of 25 years, Rick Olanoff, have four daughters.\n\nMelissa Young ’65 • Distinguished Achievement\n\nIt was 1965, the middle of a turbulent era in which civil rights, social justice, feminism, and environmental responsibility were seeping into America’s consciousness. Among the Carleton students embracing these\n\nefforts was future television documentary producer Melissa Young. “I know of no one who has so consistently been a voice for social justice and environmental responsibility as has Melissa Young,” says a nominator.\n\nYoung’s social activism took various paths, many leading through Central and South America, starting with a project building houses in Guatemala during her sophomore year. After graduation, she was a Fulbright Scholar in Peru and then volunteered in a coffeehouse in Colorado Springs—a refuge for service members opposed to the Vietnam War. She worked in a women-owned and -operated custom cabinetry co-op, and she organized a group of Seattle carpenters—half of them women—to build a school in an impoverished area of Nicaragua.\n\nWhile in Nicaragua, she began filming her experiences and through that project met fellow activist and filmmaker Mark Dworkin, who became her partner in work and in life. In 1987 they established Moving Images Video Project, a nonprofit that produces and distributes TV documentaries that encourage peace, human rights, global justice, and protection of the environment. The duo’s films have consistently garnered high praise for exhaustive research, technical and artistic excellence, and audience engagement. Their work is used educationally from kindergarten to university level; six films have aired nationally on public television, the latest in 2014.\n\nYoung’s work has been recognized with three Golden Eagle Awards, the Golden and Silver Apple Awards from the National Educational Media Network, two Bronze Awards from the Columbus Film Festival, a Production Excellence Award from Women In Film Seattle, a Labor Award from Media that Matters Festival, and the Silver Award at the Chicago International Film Festival.\n\nYoung and Dworkin have two daughters and two grandchildren. In her free time, Young enjoys gardening, hiking, and swimming.\n\nJon Blue ’70 • Distinguished Achievement\n\nConnecticut Superior Court Judge Jon Blue’s public service career began soon after his graduation from Stanford Law School in 1973. “Three years at a corporate tax firm convinced him he wanted to devote his professional abilities to a different goal,” wrote one nominator. For the next 13 years Blue worked as a legal assistance attorney and public defender arguing cases on behalf of indigent clients.\n\nOne of his cases, Little v. Streater, put him before the U.S. Supreme Court and in the pages of American Lawyer. His client, Walter Little, was being sued in a paternity case, but Little couldn’t afford to take the blood test to prove the claim was groundless. Blue won the case, arguing that a defendant in a paternity case couldn’t be denied a blood test on grounds of indigence.\n\nNoting “the national importance of his dogged pursuit of the rights of indigent defendants,” his 25 years as a judge, his appearances before the Supreme Court of Connecticut, and his continued contributions to his profession through lectures, publications, and professional associations, “Jon’s achievements and distinguished career are a credit to the legal and judicial professions and to Carleton,” says one nominator.\n\nAmong the civil and criminal trials over which Blue presided was a high-profile case in which the wife and two daughters of a Cheshire, Connecticut, doctor were viciously attacked and murdered during a home invasion. Despite the complexity of separate trials for the two co-defendants, a flurry of motions on each side, and a voracious press, Blue handled each situation “skillfully and thoughtfully,” one of his nominators writes.\n\nBlue maintains an interest in the history of law as well as its practice. Later this year, his book The Case of the Piglet’s Paternity will be released. Using original records, Blue chronicled legal life in the New Haven Colony from 1638 to 1665. “Only a trial judge could have written this book—and only a trial judge with a love of history,” writes one reviewer.\n\nBlue is married to Jean Elmblad Blue ’71,and is the father of Eleanor Blue and Miranda Blue ’06. He also notes that he is a “fortunate member of a close-knit group of Carleton friends that has shared adventures, happiness, and adversity for more than 45 years.”\n\nBeth Boosalis Davis ’70 • Exceptional Service\n\nBeth Davis is the kind of person people turn to when they need advice because they know they will get a thoughtful, honest reply. During her years of service to the college since her graduation in 1970, Davis has been called upon time and again—and has responded with wisdom, kindness, and tact.\n\nDavis majored in English at Carleton and graduated from the University of Chicago Law School in 1974. Davis has practiced law, served in elected office, managed a national nonprofit, written the book Mayor Helen Boosalis: My Mother’s Life in Politics, and served on numerous boards in the greater Chicago area and nationally.\n\nAs a Carleton volunteer, Davis has served in an array of roles: president of Alumni Council, working on reunion planning committees, supporting Alumni Annual Fund gift efforts, serving as the Chicago club chair, sitting on search committees and strategic planning groups, and her long tenure on Carleton’s Board of Trustees, beginning in 1994 as an alumni trustee and serving in numerous leadership roles on the Board from 2002 to 2014.\n\n“That’s what the written record says,” former president Steve Lewis says in his letter of recommendation, “but it was the character of Beth’s service that sets her apart from others who have some of the same ‘credentials.’ One of the reasons Carleton is as strong an institution as it is lies in the willingness of Carleton alumni to do both what is asked of them by the college and to go beyond those tasks in offering to undertake jobs, to proffer thoughtful advice, to be analytical in their approach to issues that the college faces (or ought to face), and to do so without expecting the college or its leadership to agree with them on everything. Beth is really exceptional in all those dimensions,” Lewis writes.\n\nAppreciated for her tact, creativity, kindness, intelligence, and willingness to roll up her sleeves, “Beth has a buoyant personality that has the effect of raising the morale of any group she works with,” one recommender notes. But what is intangible is the “impact her work has had, or the absolute faith and trust that leaders at the college and on the Board of Trustees have placed in Beth over time. While serving as a leader in so many ways, Beth has also been among our most humble and modest alums.”\n\nDavis also enjoys returning to her Carleton roots for leisure: She has been an enthusiastic participant in Carleton Alumni Adventure trips to Alaska, the American Southwest, the Columbia River, and the Black Sea.\n\nDavis and her husband, Max, live in Evanston, IL, and have two grown sons.\n\nKathleen Culhane‐Pera ’75 • Distinguished Achievement\n\nIndefatigable, compassionate, and dedicated are words colleagues and friends use to describe Kathleen Culhane-Pera. A family physician, anthropologist, researcher, author, and teacher, Culhane‑Pera has dedicated her career to studying and addressing the cultural barriers that immigrant populations face when receiving medical care in the United States. She is especially well known in the Hmong community and has spent years studying the culture, learning the language, and working with the Hmong population in Minnesota and Southeast Asia.\n\n“Kathie is a bridge between people on both sides of the cultural divide, helping Hmong patients and their community to increase trusting relationships and decrease patients’ fears of providers and procedures, and helping community health educators, primary care providers, and medical specialists incorporate cultural sensitivity and recognize the role of traditional Hmong healing in caring for and healing their patients,” a nominator writes.\n\nCulhane-Pera has published in various medical journals, as well as editing and contributing to the book Healing by Heart: Clinical and Ethical Case Stories of Hmong Families and Western Providers. She has received several awards, including the Minnesota Academy of Family Practice awards for researcher of the year and teacher of the year. She is active in the new field of community-based participatory action research, which includes community members as co-researchers and aims to improve community health as much as make discoveries.\n\nIn 2013–14 she traveled to northern Thailand on a Fulbright Scholarship to study and assist rural populations with breaking down barriers for women during pregnancy. As a volunteer, she has traveled twice to provide medical care in Haiti. She is known for being able to communicate in a way that opens doors to new understandings. A colleague who, through Culhane-Pera’s help, arranged a meeting between a shaman and a group of students, reports, “The students and I were amazed at how Kathie could find ways to bridge two ways of knowing. It was art and science at its best.”\n\nDr. Culhane-Pera is Associate Medical Director and Co-director of Community-based Research at West Side Community Health Services, a federally qualified health center in Saint Paul MN, where she has worked since 1994. She and her husband Tim Pera live in Saint Paul; they have two grown children.\n\nEmily Stevens ’85 • Distinguished Achievement\n\n“Our goal is to keep girls interested in science, technology, engineering, and math,” Emily Stevens told the Carleton Voice in 2013. That’s exactly what she does as managing producer of SciGirls, an Emmy Award-winning reality show for girls ages 8-12. Produced by Twin Cities Public Television (TPT) and shown nationally on PBS, the show received the Emmy for Outstanding New Approaches in Children’s Television in 2011, and was nominated again in 2013.\n\nStevens manages production for TPT’s Science Unit, recently recognized for another Emmy‑winning show, Transplant: A Gift for Life, which revealed the emotions and science involved in vital organ transplants through real-life stories. “Her unit is one of the most respected television science education units in the country—and Emily has played a critical role in shaping it and its success,” notes one nominator.\n\nStevens first worked at TPT in the early 1990s as a production manager on Hoop Dreams, Alive From Off Center, and The Dakota Conflict. “She pursues and has achieved excellence in developing and applying planning, management, and administrative skills that make the most of scarce resources, so high-quality public media products are made available to the nation,” says another nominator.\n\nAfter her first tenure at TPT, Stevens’s decade of production credits included documentaries, series, features, and special projects for a wide range of networks. As director of production at Independent Television Service for five years, Stevens worked with independent producers on more than 100 documentaries, narrative films, and series for PBS.\n\n“Emily has spent much of her professional life working to deliver and improve public media content in America,” one nominator writes. “Despite her proven marketability in a much higher-paying industry (Hollywood filmmaking), she returned to public television, drawn by her desire to do something that makes a positive difference in people’s lives.”\n\nStevens and her husband, Bix Skahill, live in Falcon Heights, Minnesota.\n\nTracie Washington ’85 • Distinguished Achievement\n\nTracie Washington is a passionate advocate of civil and human rights. She has a proven track record of building strong relationships and fostering engagement among a wide range of groups. The strength of her convictions has pushed state and local officials to make strides in community growth and change in Louisiana, particularly regarding housing issues and health care services.\n\nFor more than 20 years, Washington, a New Orleans native, has maintained a general civil practice concentrated in education law, civil rights, and labor and employment law. She received a master’s degree in public administration from Drake University and a law degree from the University of Texas Law School, and has served as general counsel to the Austin, Texas, transit system and to the New Orleans Public School system.\n\nWashington is a sought-after author, speaker, and adviser on civil rights and social justice issues. An expert in charter school board governance, having founded one herself, Washington now serves as vice president of Treme Charter School Association and is general counsel to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Charter School for Science and Technology.\n\nAfter Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, Washington’s practice focused on protecting the civil rights of individuals affected by those devastating storms. In 2006 Washington served the NAACP as director of the Gulf Coast Advocacy Center, and in 2007 she co-founded the Louisiana Justice Institute (LJI), a nonprofit civil rights legal advocacy organization devoted to fostering social justice campaigns across Louisiana, concentrating in the Gulf Coast region. LJI has worked to develop solutions concerning race and inequity in redevelopment, public education of special needs students, public housing residents, and, most recently, health care reform and economic development.\n\nWashington has received numerous civil rights awards and was named by MSNBC’s TheGrio as “one of its 100 History Makers in the Making” and by daily online magazine The Root as one of its “20 Leading Black Women Advocating Change.” In November 2012 Washington received the Torchbearer’s Award from the Greater New Orleans Chapter of the National Coalition of Black Women.\n\nSays one of her nominators, “Tracie’s list of accomplishments is long and impressive. What amazes me most is her ability to—in true Carleton style—do so many things well. Her dedication to her family, her church, and her community is tireless, and she still has time to make throws for her Mardi Gras krewe.”\n\nStuart Comer ’90 • Distinguished Achievement\n\nIn a letter nominating Stuart Comer, a classmate and fellow art history major said, “Stuart had a natural ease within the visual analysis and descriptive language of the field. More than that, he seemed to breathe art. . . . When imagining which of my fellow art history majors was going to make a mark in the world of art, it seemed clear that Stuart would be the one to watch.”\n\nSince 2013 Comer has been chief curator of the Department of Media and Performance Art at the Museum of Modern Art in New York (MoMA), the United States’s flagship institution of modern art. The field “is an emerging one of international importance” that recognizes that “film is now a medium beyond modern,” and in his work, which also spans video and performance as well as film, “Comer is unifying long–established film programs with contemporary artists’ use of film in their hybrid artistic practice,” notes one nominator.\n\nComer spent much of the 1990s in Los Angeles, working in the Museum of Contemporary Art’s bookshop and writing reviews for local art publications, but he also was developing connections that would serve him well later on. He earned a master’s degree in curatorial studies at the Royal College of Art in London, and in 2002 began work at Tate Modern in London as curator of public events. After expanding the film program at Tate, turning it into one of the major platforms in London’s busy artists’ film circuit, his position title changed to Curator: Film, Tate’s first permanent curatorial post for film and video.\n\nAt MoMA, Comer’s “energetic exploration of relationships between art and the moving image” will enable him to “make a significant contribution to [our] efforts to exhibit, collect, and interpret the art of our time,” predicts director Glenn D. Lowry. Just before his appointment at MoMA, Comer also was given the exceptional honor of being appointed one of three curators for the 2014 Whitney Biennial, a prestigious and trendsetting exhibition of contemporary American art, typically by young and lesser-known artists.\n\n“Overall, Stuart Comer is a force to reckon with in the art world, especially in relation to cutting edge forms of contemporary art involving film and the new media,” writes Carleton art history professor emerita Alison Kettering.\n\nJim McCorkell ’90 • Distinguished Achievement\n\nJim McCorkell is widely recognized as an innovator and leader of one of the nation’s most successful education-oriented nonprofits. McCorkell founded College Possible in 2000 based on his dream to help students from lower-income families prepare for and get into college and earn a degree.\n\nStarting with a handful of recent college graduates mentoring 35 low-income high school students, College Possible now annually serves more than 18,000 students in six states who receive more than 320 hours of coaching and mentorship in high school. The support continues during their transition into college and during their college experience. The results are remarkable: 98 percent of College Possible students are admitted to college. Participation in the program makes a student ten times more likely to graduate.\n\nMcCorkell’s passion for his cause has deeply personal roots. He came from a low-income family and neither of his parents attended college. “Jim was not just an idealist who wanted to give back; he shared the experiences of the students he served. His passion and commitment to his cause has been a motivating factor for me since the day I joined College Possible as a student,” writes one nominator and Carleton graduate. “As a person who grew up below poverty, and who was told that college was not for me, walking across the stage on the Bald Spot in the spring of 2009 was the greatest achievement I have ever had.”\n\nMcCorkell was elected as an Ashoka Fellow in 2006 and received Harvard Kennedy School’s alumni achievement award in 2012. College Possible has won major awards of excellence from leading associations in the field and last year was included in a report from President Obama, Increasing College Opportunities for Low‑Income Students: Promising Models and a Call to Action. This year, his organization won the U.S. Department of Education’s highly competitive i3 Grant to expand their efforts.\n\nMcCorkell maintains his Carleton connection by returning to make presentations on careers in social justice and social entrepreneurship, and he has hired recent Carleton graduates as AmeriCorps/VISTA volunteers, giving many alumni a start in the field. But he also has further ties to Carleton: His mother worked in the library for more than 30 years, his father worked in the shop as a maintenance painter, and his grandmother was a cook in Evans Dining Hall. “Though all have died, I know they would be very proud to know that I would be among the winners of this special recognition,” says McCorkell.\n\nHe and his wife, Christine Greenhow, have a son, Jack, and a dog, Milly.\n\nErica Mohan ’00 • In the Spirit of Carleton Award\n\nErica Mohan is a fighter for the homeless youth in the San Francisco Bay Area. She is the founder and executive director of Community Education Partnerships (CEP), a nonprofit organization that provides educational support through high-quality volunteer academic tutoring for homeless children in the pre-K through 12th-grade school system. Mohan has almost single-handedly run the program since its inception in 2010, providing tutors to more than 100 children in Oakland, Berkeley, and San Francisco.\n\nThe founding of CEP is, in some ways, “the culmination of a 15-year trajectory of volunteer service and advocacy that Erica began as an undergraduate at Carleton,” says one nominator who, along with Mohan, co-directed the volunteer ESL tutoring program for immigrant adults in Minnesota. While completing her PhD in education from the University of British Columbia, Mohan tutored homeless children in southern California, where she had temporarily relocated to be near her husband. During this time, she began to imagine how she might use her PhD to transform access to education in her own community.\n\nHer volunteer work tutoring children in Los Angeles went from one hour a week to three, to five, and finally, full time. When she returned to Oakland in 2009 she discovered that a free tutoring service for homeless children didn’t exist, despite the vast need for such services. She completed her doctorate and immediately began conceiving her plan for CEP. The organization has been thriving, and by 2020, she hopes to help increase the percentage of Oakland students reading at or above grade level by the end of third grade from 42 to 85 percent.\n\nIn Oakland, Mohan has also co‑directed a summer program for multiethnic and trans-racially adopted youth. She continues her scholarly activities through conference presentations, lectures, writing, and publishing, and since 2013 has served on the board of the Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation, which provides affordable homes for San Francisco’s poorest residents.\n\n“Erica personifies commitment to public service and civic engagement,” says another nominator. “[She] is a shining example of the intersection of entrepreneurship and selflessness.”\n\nMohan and her husband, Adrian Barnes, have two children and live in Oakland, California.\n\nNonoko Sato ’00 • In the Spirit of Carleton Award\n\nOnly eight percent of low-income students graduate from college, yet a college education can be a critical factor in breaking the cycle of poverty for families. Nonoko Sato knows this firsthand. As executive director of SMART (Schools, Mentoring and Resource Team) in San Francisco’s Bay Area, she wants to make sure that all deserving students, no matter their economic background, have the opportunity to pursue higher education.\n\nSMART offers an eight-year continuum of support to students in 5th through 12th grades, which includes after-school and summer programming combined with academic and social-emotional support through strong partnerships with the Bay Area’s most exceptional private schools.\n\nAccess to great education opened doors for Sato, whose background is similar to those of the students and families she serves through SMART. Sato joined the nonprofit in 2004 as a program director and was made executive director in 2008. In the six years she has been at the organization’s helm, she has extended SMART’s community reach from 55 students to 264 students. During that time, 100 percent of SMART scholars have graduated from high school and been accepted to college, and 94 percent attended college. Likewise, Sato expanded the financial goals to expand the nonprofit program, nearly doubling its annual revenue within two years.\n\n“She has left an indelible mark,” writes Scott Jordon, chairman of the SMART board, “not just on SMART, but on the entire San Francisco educational community and beyond. . . . She has been a huge contributor to transforming the discussion of socioeconomic equality and diversity in schools throughout San Francisco.”\n\n“I have known Nonoko since I was in the fifth grade, and I can personally attest to the fact that she genuinely cares about SMART beyond the program goals; she cares for the students and families on an individual level,” writes one nominator, a current Carleton student. “Nonoko has never simply been the director. For my peers and me, she was a mentor.”\n\nSato is married to Theo Johnson ’00. They have one son.\n\nMelia Garza ’05 • In the Spirit of Carleton Award\n\nOver the past 10 years, Melia Garza has relentlessly advocated for victims of sexual assault and violence in Minnesota. “In a field where supporter fatigue and burnout are high, Melia has found a way to expand her reach beyond victim support to large-scale systemic change. She has worked with victims, perpetrators, medical staff, law enforcement, prosecutors, nonprofits, and government agencies, finding ways to bring people together, helping them see the problem of sexual violence through new eyes,” says one nominator.\n\nDuring her senior year at Carleton, Garza volunteered as a victim advocate through the HOPE Center in Faribault. The center hired her as a sexual assault program coordinator and domestic violence advocate after graduation, and she helped more than 400 victims of sexual assault and domestic violence navigate the criminal justice system.\n\nIn 2008 she joined the Sexual Violence Justice Institute at the Minnesota Coalition Against Sexual Assault (MNCASA), helping counties organize and restructure their response to sexual violence. She also led projects related to the use of expert testimony in sexual assault cases and identifying challenges faced by law enforcement when responding to these cases. Garza completed a master’s degree in criminal justice while working full time, conducting her thesis research on prosecutor charging decisions in sexual assault cases. Last fall she took a job with the Minnesota Judicial Branch as a domestic and sexual violence analyst. She provides expertise on court processing of cases of sexual and domestic violence and identifies training opportunities for judges and court staff on these topics.\n\n“Melia has the ability to listen, analyze, and use information to help people see problems differently; to creatively synthesize ideas and come up with new ideas,” says a nominator. “She works well with people who have been traditionally entrenched in the system to change their views of how to approach sexual violence and help people to grow.”\n\nIn her free time, Garza and her partner, John Krenz, support a local farm with ethical labor practices and enjoy following a plant-based lifestyle.\n\nGeorge Nicholson ’59 • Distinguished Achievement\n\nGeorge M. Nicholson is a noted literary agent, editor, and publisher of children’s literature. He is cited as a seminal figure and legend in Minders of Make-Believe, the leading history of the field. Nicholson virtually created the children’s paperback book industry. As an editor, he developed many young authors, and through partnerships with libraries and schools has made children’s literature more accessible to generations of young people.\n\nA Carleton English major, Nicholson was hired by Golden Books after graduation. With a vision for bringing books of literary merit directly to young readers in paperback editions, Nicholson was hired by Dell in 1964. There he developed Delacorte Press Books and created the now-classic Dell Yearling imprint, the first quality paperback line of fiction for young readers. For Dell, he acquired E.B. White’s Charlotte’s Web and Stuart Little, gaining respect for the children’s paperback niche. After heading children’s book departments at Viking and Holt, Rinehart & Winston, he rejoined Dell in 1978 and served as publisher of Dell/Delacorte Books for Young Readers from 1988 until 1992. Nicholson has been senior agent at Sterling Lord Literistic since 1995.\n\nNicholson also helped expand the field of young adult fiction. He saw the rise of bookstore chains—B. Dalton, Barnes & Noble, WaldenBooks—as an ideal marketplace for books written for teens and young adults. His career flourished at a time when individual editors were able to identify outstanding authors and illustrators and assure their publication. Among those whose careers he launched were S. E. Hinton, Richard Peck, Beverly Cleary, Judy Blume, and many others.\n\nThrough connections with Carleton’s Career Center, he has helped students secure internships at several publishing houses. He is a frequent lecturer, author of articles about children’s literature, instructor at City College of New York, and trustee of the MacDowell Colony, the oldest artists’ colony in the U.S.\n\nKeith Libbey ’59 • Exceptional Service\n\nKeith Libbey’s dedication to Carleton is demonstrated on many levels, including his service on the Alumni Board (now Alumni Council), his work for the Alumni Annual Fund, and his positive and thoughtful presence on the Board of Trustees. The Class of 1959’s 55th Reunion Committee unanimously recommended Libbey’s nomination for this honor.\n\nLibbey served on the Carleton Board of Trustees from 1997 to 2012, under three presidents—Stephen R. Lewis Jr., Robert A. Oden Jr., and Steven G. Poskanzer. For 13 of his 15 years as a trustee, Libbey was a member of the trustees’ executive committee; he served as vice chair for six years. During his tenure on the board, he also chaired the investment and trustee affairs committees.\n\nPresident Emeritus Oden characterizes Libbey as possessing every characteristic and talent most welcome in a trustee, including keen intelligence and unremitting responsibility. “Keith brought his uncommonly acute mind to bear on any number of Carleton trustee deliberations,” Oden wrote, “often altering the entire focus of debate through a single, trenchant observation.”\n\nPresident Emeritus Lewis concurs. “A good trustee is one who thinks about the college between meetings,” Lewis wrote, “and Keith certainly filled that bill. He was unusual, even among a very good group of trustees during my years, in taking initiative to make the College’s case with potential donors or with the larger community, and he was very good indeed in pursuing issues that he thought could benefit Carleton.”\n\nIn addition to his significant contributions as a trustee, Libbey served as a class agent for more than a decade. He provided leadership on the Alumni Board (1974–1978) and has been involved with multiple reunion planning efforts, including his 50th. He has hosted alumni and career networking gatherings at his workplace and supported Carleton’s 2012 strategic planning efforts, working on the Administrative and Faculty Functions group.\n\nLibbey majored in government at Carleton and graduated from Harvard Law School in 1962. He is chair emeritus of Fredrikson & Byron, a law firm in Minneapolis with more than 200 attorneys.\n\nHe lives in Afton, Minnesota, with his wife, Patricia Libbey ’60. Two of their three children are Carleton alumni: Jonathan Libbey ’88 and Heather Libbey ’91.\n\nBill Gage ’64 • Distinguished Achievement\n\nAt the dawn of the computer age, Bill Gage recognized the tremendous potential of this new technology. As a life-long pioneer at the emerging edge of digital technology, he has made significant technical, scientific, and commercial contributions to a dizzying array of industries, including off-shore oil well drilling, nuclear reactor testing, real-time vote processing for broadcast television, robotic controls, acoustic emission analysis, the wine industry, and many more.\n\nGage considers himself to be Carleton’s first “computer geek,” a legacy that began in 1961 when the college received an IBM 1620 computer. Gage, a mathematics major, spent his free time in the computer lab. While still an undergraduate, he wrote an educational computer program that he presented at an IBM Conference and that was used at other colleges and universities. The work Gage did as a physics graduate student at the University of California–Berkeley “persists today in its influence of design of newer computers and their operating systems,” writes one nominator.\n\nGage left Berkeley in 1970 and, with friend Sam Penny, founded Penny Gage Associates, a software consulting partnership that in 1982 evolved into SBE, Inc., a software consulting and OEM hardware company. A few years earlier, in\n\n1978, Gage also co-founded Rosenblum Cellars winery. With both companies, Gage developed computer programs that solved many scientific and systems problems. At Rosenblum Cellars, for example, he developed a state-of-the-art business data processing system.\n\nGage served as CEO and board member of SBE until he retired from the company in 1996. He also continued hands-on work as a programmer and design contributor for the hardware products that had become SBE’s main business. For the last two decades, Gage has been an independent consultant, developing very-high-speed computer-to-computer communication software for One Stop, a company similar to SBE.\n\nGage’s accomplishments are testimony to his consistent application of the best of Carleton’s liberal arts principles, and he has contributed much to the continuation of excellence at Carleton through his service and generosity. Gage co-chaired his 50th Reunion gift committee, served as an alumni trustee from 2009 to 2013, and with his wife, Nancy Bauer, funded the Weitz Center for Creativity’s IdeaLab. He and Nancy are recipients of the William Carleton Medal in recognition of their transformational support of the College.\n\nPenny Hunt ’64 • Distinguished Achievement\n\nPenny Hunt is a leader and “unsung heroine” in the field of foundation and corporate philanthropy, transforming the philanthropic approaches at major foundations and ensuring that scores of innovative projects at local, national, and international levels received the support they needed to launch and make a difference in the world.\n\nSince 2009 Hunt has led the Minneapolis-based Robina Foundation, where she has been instrumental in developing a program in international institutional governance and a path-breaking program to increase minority involvement in U.S. foreign affairs. These initiatives have been influential in making steps toward increasing diversity in foreign policy and addressing transnational challenges like terrorism, climate change, and infectious disease.\n\nHunt demonstrates “extraordinary skill and achievement in a difficult role,” said nominator Susan Berresford, a Robina Foundation trustee and past president of the Ford Foundation. Because the foundation’s structure and mission are somewhat unique within the foundation world, the chair of the Robina board notes that “Penny’s depth of experience combined with her exceptional organizational and interpersonal skills have contributed greatly to our work.”\n\nPrior to joining Robina, Hunt served as vice president for community affairs and executive director of the Medtronic Foundation at Medtronic, Inc. for nearly 15 years. Among her major achievements was launching Medtronic’s expansion into international philanthropy. During her tenure, Medtronic Foundation grants grew from $2.4 million to more than $25 million per year.\n\nBefore Medtronic, Hunt was director of public affairs for the Department Store Division of Dayton Hudson Corporation. Prior to entering the foundation world, she spent 14 years working for law firms and in private practice. She also taught high school and college-level French.\n\nHunt’s extensive community involvement includes membership in the Minnesota Women’s Economic Roundtable and on the boards or corporate committees of MacPhail Center for Music, William Mitchell College of Law, Minnesota Council on Foundations, the Conference Board, Council on Foundations, WomenWinning, and United Way of Minneapolis.\n\nHunt majored in French at Carleton and was a Fulbright Scholar in Lyon, France. She holds a master’s degree in arts and teaching from Duke University and a JD from William Mitchell College of Law. She has two children and many Carleton connections, including three siblings, a brother-in-law, niece, and nephew who attended the College.\n\nJames Loewen ’64 • Distinguished Achievement\n\nSociologist James Loewen has made his mark as an educational innovator, developing new approaches to teaching history that emphasize social justice and racial equality. His 1995 book Lies My Teacher Told Me has sold more than 1.5 million copies and is the best-selling book by a living sociologist.\n\nLoewen’s lifelong commitment to racial equality began when he spent a term during his junior year at Carleton studying at Mississippi State University. After graduating cum laude with distinction in sociology from Carleton, Loewen obtained a doctoral degree in sociology from Harvard University in 1968, and then returned to Mississippi to become an assistant professor of sociology at Tougaloo College, a historically\n\nblack college.\n\nIn 1975 Loewen put together a team of Tougaloo students and professors who wrote Mississippi: Conflict and Change, a book intended for use by high school students that received the Lillian Smith Award for Best Southern Nonfiction in 1975. When the state found the book too frank in its treatment of race, Loewen became lead plaintiff in a 1980 federal lawsuit, Loewen v. Turnipseed. The American Library Association cites the case, which Loewen won, as one of nine cases undergirding the “right to read freely.” Over the past four decades, Loewen has participated as an expert witness in about 75 civil rights, voting rights, and employment rights cases across the country.\n\nDuring this period, he also has researched, written, and published works including Lies Across America: What our Historic Sites Get Wrong and Sundown Towns: A Hidden Dimension of American Racism.\n\nIn 1976 Loewen joined the faculty at the University of Vermont where, until 1996, he taught courses on the sociology of race relations. In 1981 he received a Fulbright to set up the first course in race relations at La Trobe University in Australia.\n\nIn 2012 Loewen received the Spirit of America Award from the National Council of Social Studies. The council recognized his “deep commitment to including multiple perspectives in social studies curricula.” That same year Loewen also received the Cox/Johnson/Frazier Award for academic excellence and improving society from the American Sociological Association.\n\nToday Loewen speaks and publishes on U.S. history, standardized testing, and race relations from his home in Washington, D.C., where he lives with his wife, Susan. He is the father of a son and a daughter.\n\nEve Meyer ’64 • Distinguished Achievement\n\nAs executive director of San Francisco Suicide Prevention, Eve Meyer has been at the forefront of suicide prevention efforts locally and nationally for more than 25 years. Meyer skillfully expanded a small grass-roots agency into an efficient, high-tech, state-of-the-art operation capable of managing more than 70,000 calls for help annually by phone, email, chat, and text.\n\nAfter graduating from Carleton, Meyer earned masters degrees in social services administration from the University of Chicago and in health care administration from the University of Michigan. She immediately applied her education through work in health care planning and marketing, and in 1987 began her career as executive director of San Francisco Suicide Prevention (SFSP), which continues to this day.\n\nDuring Meyer’s tenure, not a single person has committed suicide while communicating with SFSP volunteers, and San Francisco’s suicide rate has been cut in half since the founding of the agency. Reverend Don Fox, who for years headed San Francisco Night Ministry, writes that Meyer “has tirelessly devoted her time and energy over many years to one of the most important things any human being can do—helping others avoid succumbing to despair and saving them from killing themselves.”\n\nMeyer’s longtime advocacy on behalf of a suicide barrier on the world’s number-one suicide site, the Golden Gate Bridge, is equally noteworthy. After 60 years of negotiations, financing for a suicide barrier on the Golden Gate Bridge will be made available this year. One nominator who worked with Meyer on this effort wrote,\n\n“Eve immediately demonstrated not only a deep knowledge of suicide prevention—often both deeper and richer than the trained psychiatrists in the group—but was able to immediately focus the group on practical steps to advocate for resolving the bridge problem.”\n\nMeyer uses her natural sense of humor to inject levity into her talking points, one nominator wrote, making listeners comfortable around the sensitive topic of suicide. Meyer even does occasional stand-up comedy.\n\nShe and her husband, James A.K. Edlin, live in San Francisco and have one son.\n\nPaul Zitzewitz ’64 • Distinguished Achievement (posthumous)\n\nAs a scholar, researcher, mentor, and author, Paul Zitzewitz made major contributions in the field of atomic physics and had a marked impact on the way physics is taught in America.\n\nZitzewitz grew up in the Chicago area. At Carleton he discovered like-minded friends who shared his curiosity about the world and passion for contributing to its betterment. He earned a PhD in physics from Harvard, where he studied with Norman Ramsey (who later won a Nobel Prize), then joined the faculty at the University of Michigan–Dearborn in 1973. In 1979–80, he received a Humboldt Fellowship from the German government for a residency at the University of Bielefeld.\n\nAs a researcher Zitzewitz changed and enriched the world’s understanding of positron physics and conducted research that confirmed quantum electrodynamic (QED) theory and advanced methods of precisely measuring time. Though he began his career as an avid research physicist, Zitzewitz soon recognized that he had the potential to make a larger contribution by teaching\n\nothers, succeeding in changing how physics is taught at the secondary and undergraduate levels.\n\nAs an effective physics teacher and textbook author, Zitzewitz reached thousands of students and helped them understand physics. His high school textbook, Physics: Principles and Problems, allowed students to learn physics concepts without advanced math. For years the textbook had about a third of the market. He authored other textbooks and numerous professional articles on physics education.\n\nZitzewitz became one of two professors in Dearborn history to receive three distinguished faculty awards: for teaching, research, and service. He also took on administrative duties, serving as interim dean and associate dean, as well as chair of two departments. Nationally he was recognized as a fellow of the American Physical Society and American Association of Physics Teaching.\n\nDonald Bord, Zitzewitz’s colleague at Dearborn, wrote, “He was a truly remarkable human being and one of the most respected and admired faculty members to have graced our campus.” Bord described Zitzewitz’s mentoring style as enthusiastic, patient, wise, tolerant, and self-deprecating. “Paul had a capacity to draw people to him and nurture them in ways I have seldom seen.”\n\nZitzewitz died on April 30, 2013. He is survived by his wife and colleague, Barbara Shaw Zitzewitz, and two adult children.\n\nSteve Duermeyer ’64 • Exceptional Service\n\nSteve Duermeyer’s generosity as a volunteer to the College exemplifies going above and beyond the call of service. Perhaps most widely recognized as a leader in a class of leaders—1964 consistently has the highest participation rates in Carleton’s Alumni Annual Fund—Duermeyer also served on the Alumni Board (now Alumni Council) from 1994 to 1998 and helped transform the reunion giving program at Carleton. He has been instrumental in developing Carleton’s model for mini-reunions and frequently volunteers for Carleton’s regional clubs.\n\nIn addition to its reputation for giving, the Class of 1964’s exceptional cohesiveness and loyalty is well known within the Carleton community. Duermeyer is perhaps the classmate most responsible for those class characteristics; his personal communications style is credited with being the key to developing 1964’s level of engagement. “Steve’s profile of dedication and service to Carleton is extraordinary,” wrote lead nominator Marlou Garbisch Johnston ’64. “He does everything. He has been our ‘go-to’ guy for many years.”\n\nCommissioned as an officer in the U.S. Navy in 1965, Duermeyer rose to the rank of captain over a distinguished 30-year career. He served at sea on nine different ships and was commanding officer of four. After retiring from the Navy in 1995, he spent a year as special assistant to President Stephen R. Lewis Jr. to initiate a new model for reunion giving, attendance, and participation.\n\n“It seems pretty clear to me that the shift to focus on special efforts for reunion classes was critical in getting Carleton to the top” in alumni giving, observes President Emeritus Lewis. Duermeyer served as a key organizer and cheerleader for the initiative, and “is a model of what I have always valued in a Carleton volunteer.”\n\nDuermeyer hosted the Class of 1964’s inaugural class mini-reunion in the home he shares with his wife, Penny, in Coronado, California, in 2000. Since then, the class has annually celebrated at varied locations, strengthening class cohesion and connection to the College. Duermeyer also served as the Carleton representative at the unveiling of the permanent Larry Gould Exhibit in the Gould-Simpson Building on the University of Arizona campus in 1993.\n\nSteve’s imagination, determination, and his willingness to work either “on stage” or behind the scenes to accomplish great things for his class and the College truly distinguish his service. Fifty consecutive years of annual giving to Carleton, first in his class to join the Heywood Society, overall reunion committee chair or co-chair for four consecutive reunions, and key gift-raiser for 25th and 50th reunions further accentuate Duermeyer’s unswerving and energetic dedication\n\nto Carleton.\n\nAlison Keith ’64 • Exceptional Service\n\nAlison Keith is a steadfast Alumni Annual Fund co-agent, 50th reunion co-chair, and master fundraiser whose tireless energy and cheerleading has been instrumental in 1964’s leadership in giving participation. Keith has helped strengthen bonds across the 1964 classmate community, both through the AAF team’s consistency in staying in touch with classmates and by providing support to the hosts of the annual class mini-reunions.\n\nIn her 14 years as 1964’s co-class agent for the Alumni Annual Fund, Keith’s strategic approach and sheer determination led the class to levels of participation previously unimaginable. When Keith began in 2000, 1964 claimed a healthy 60 percent participation, and through her leadership the class jumped to 90 percent (or better) for the past seven years, reaching a high of 93 percent in 2013.\n\n“Her dedication and follow-through is the stuff of alumni legends, and I cannot think of the success of the Class of 1964 without calling Alison and her efforts and commitment to mind,” one nominator wrote.\n\nKeith believes her most important contribution to the AAF effort is keeping the team together and in good spirits. Similarly, she feels her most important contribution to her Carleton class is to have strengthened a network among classmates. To that end, she hosted a Class of 1964 mini-reunion at her home in Springdale, Utah, in 2005. Her dedication to creating community continues to be evident in her role as co-chair of her 50th Reunion committee—1964’s bio book has the highest number of contributions of any class in Carleton’s history, which reflects that sense of community.\n\nKeith majored in economics at Carleton and at the University of California-Berkeley, where she earned an MA in 1968 and a PhD in 1986. After Carleton, she taught English at the Women’s College, Aligarh Muslim University, India, on a Fulbright program (1964–65).\n\nKeith held various positions at the Federal Trade Commission’s Bureau of Economics from 1974 to 1990. She then moved to Pfizer, where she retired as director of economic and science policy analysis. Throughout her career, she has positively contributed to the public policy debate and to creating sound public policy, particularly in the arena of health care. Since retiring, she hikes in Zion National Park, explores monotype printmaking, and is a volunteer mediator with the juvenile court in southern Utah.\n\nBob Allen ’69 • Distinguished Achievement\n\nRobert C. Allen is an economic historian whose depth, breadth, and versatility have put him at the pinnacle of his profession. His research and writing on economic history and economic development, technological change, and public policy have earned him six major prizes, including the Ranki Prize and the Explorations Prize twice each. Nominator Patrick O’Brien, past director of the Institute for Historical Research at the University of London, notes, “there is hardly an area or narrative in the subject we both love that has not benefited from Bob’s erudition and research.”\n\nAllen has published almost 90 articles and book chapters and eight books; his ninth, The Industrial Revolution: A Very Short Introduction, is forthcoming. Allen’s 2009 book on the British Industrial Revolution made Books of the Year lists in two prestigious general-circulation periodicals, The Times Literary Supplement and The Economist.\n\nWhen study abroad at Carleton was expanding but still not commonplace, Allen was one of six students from the Class of 1969 to do an independent study abroad program. After a brief stint in the Peace Corps in Asia, he earned MA and PhD degrees in economics from Harvard University. He joined the economics department at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver in 1975, attaining the rank of full professor in 1985. He moved to Oxford University in 2000, retiring in 2013 as professor of economic history in Oxford’s Nuffield College. Allen’s academic career continues—in 2014 he became Global Distinguished Professor of Economic History at New York University’s Abu Dhabi campus.\n\nAllen’s other accomplishments include serving as president of the Economic History Association (2011–2013), election as a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1993 and of the British Academy in 2003, and serving as Nuffield College’s investment bursar (property), managing an eight-figure pool of assets and adding to it during a very challenging period\n\n(2006–2011).\n\nA native of Salem, Massachusetts, Allen is married to Dianne Frank. They have one son.\n\nDavid Loy ’69 • Distinguished Achievement\n\nZen teacher and scholar David Loy is one of the most influential and prolific Buddhist thinkers in the world today. He is well known as a Buddhist social theorist in the forefront of the modern Buddhist movement called Engaged Buddhism, which seeks both to articulate a Buddhist perspective on the social problems of today and to actively work to solve them. At Commencement this year Loy received the Doctor of Humane Letters, honoris causa, degree from Carleton, the highest honor bestowed by the College.\n\nLoy’s writings, both scholarly and popular, are wide-ranging and award-winning. One of his most influential works, The Great Awakening: A Buddhist Social Theory (2003), represents one of the first attempts—and probably the most successful—to formulate an overall theory through which Buddhists can confront the ills of the contemporary world, in particular climate change and other environmental crises, says Roger Jackson, Carleton’s John W. Nason Professor of Asian Studies and Religion.\n\nLoy graduated with a degree in philosophy from Carleton, which included a junior year abroad studying analytic philosophy at King’s College, University of London. He earned an MA from the University of Hawaii in Honolulu (1975) and a PhD from the National University of Singapore (1984). Most of Loy’s academic career has been spent in Asia, first as senior tutor at Singapore University (later the National University of Singapore) from 1978 to 1984. From 1990 to 2005 he was professor at Bunkyo University, Chigasaki, Japan. While there he received extensive training in the Sanbo Kyodan tradition of Zen Buddhism, of which he now is an authorized teacher.\n\nSince leaving Japan in 2006, Loy has held a number of visiting positions, including the Besl Chair Professor of Ethics, Religion, and Society at Xavier University in Cincinnati, with shorter stints at the University of Cape Town, the Hebrew University’s Institute for Advanced Study in Jerusalem, Tartu and Tallinn Universities in Estonia, and Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado, where he currently resides.\n\nLoy lectures nationally and internationally, and his essays and books have been widely translated. He is on the editorial or advisory boards of multiple journals and provides board leadership for Buddhist Global Relief, The Clear View Project, Zen Peacemakers, and The Ernest Becker Foundation.\n\nLoy is married to Linda Goodhew, a professor of English literature and language. They have one son.\n\nStarr Tomczak ’69 • Distinguished Achievement\n\nStarr Tomczak, a pioneer in the world of corporate law, began her career at a time when the field was predominately occupied by men. A “brilliant, innovative, and intellectually demanding lawyer,” Tomczak is a thought-leader who helped shape the regulatory framework for structured finance transactions through her organization and leadership of groups within the American Bar Association (ABA).\n\nA philosophy major at Carleton, Tomczak graduated from New York University School of Law in 1975. After clerking for a distinguished federal appellate judge in Richmond, Virginia, she became a corporate partner at leading law firms in New York City, where she represented clients involved in the emerging market for structured finance transactions.\n\nIn 1986, as the structured finance market’s growth accelerated, Tomczak suggested that the ABA help develop a regulatory framework and offered to lead those efforts. Tomczak brought together many of the lawyers working in the field by recruiting top practitioners and sponsoring programs on securitization developments. “As a result, the group was well-positioned to suggest changes to make federal securities regulations more effective for this new method of financing,” notes ABA president James Silkenat.\n\n“Literally, billions of dollars of transactions have been consummated based on regulations that Starr and her drafting committee helped shape,” said a nominator. “Groundbreaking work of national significance,” another nominator said of this work.\n\nTomczak balanced her stellar career with service. She was a trustee with the American College of Investment Counsel and served as a director of the James Lenox House for senior residents. She used her legal skills to successfully advocate in family court and school proceedings for a foster child’s residential treatment center.\n\nTomczak’s increasing focus on spiritual issues led to her earning a Master of Divinity degree in 2011 from Union Theological Seminary in New York City, where she received an award for best sermon and published an article in Yale Divinity School’s Glossolalia. She currently writes about the Bible and speaks on spiritual issues at church programs and other events.\n\nBradley Lewis ’69 • Exceptional Service\n\nBradley Lewis is not only a long-serving Alumni Annual Fund agent and reunion gift chair, but is also a recognized and valued go-to volunteer for Carleton. Lewis has been consistently tapped by Carleton leadership to lead change in the College’s giving programs, including its approach to reunion giving. Lewis, an economist and economic historian, has also generously assisted Carleton’s economics department, filling in to serve after the sudden death of a faculty member.\n\nLewis epitomizes the familiar saying, “If you want to get a job done, ask a busy person.” He has taught economics for 35 years at Union College in Schenectady, New York, becoming full professor in 1999. He has served as a visiting professor at several other colleges—including Carleton—and in college administration. He also writes newspaper columns on economic policy and presents seminars at academic and business conferences.\n\nIn addition to his academic work, Lewis has been deeply involved since 1999 in Schenectady civic affairs, ranging from running for city council to serving on the city planning commission. He began active involvement with the Reformed Church in America in 1986, holding leadership positions at the national, regional, and local level, culminating as president of the denomination’s highest governing body in 2006–07.\n\nDespite his extensive professional and civic commitments, Lewis has worked unceasingly and successfully for Carleton since graduation. He has served as his class’s AAF class agent for almost 19 years and was assistant class agent for two years before that. He has served on the Class of 1969’s gift committee for every reunion starting with the 25th and helped establish a new 25th gift model centered on the Alumni Annual Fund which “transformed alumni stewardship habits and still drives the fund today,” notes one nominator.\n\nIn addition to his leadership on the 25th, Lewis chaired or co-chaired the gift committee for 1969’s 30th, 35th, 40th, and 45th reunions. He also served on the reunion program committee for the 25th and 35th reunions and volunteered as the Carleton in Chicago representative while he was in graduate school in the 1970s.\n\nLewis holds PhD (1982) and MA degrees (1978) in economics from the University of Chicago. Prior to his academic career, he spent six years with General Electric. He is married to Catherine A. Lewis.\n\nPatricia Wrede ’74 • Distinguished Achievement\n\nA master of the genre of young adult fantasy fiction, Patricia Wrede has over the course of 30 years authored a significant body of nationally recognized work. Wrede has also contributed greatly to the field as a mentor to writers and is a founding creator of Scribblies, a writing group that has produced other important fantasy writers, including Pamela Dean Dyer-Bennett ’75. Teachers, librarians, and the public consistently praise the outstanding quality of her writing.\n\nWrede has written or co-written 24 novels, as well as numerous short stories. In a 2012 poll conducted by National Public Radio (NPR), Wrede’s Enchanted Forest Chronicles (four novels), was included in a list of the top 100 Best-Ever Teen Fiction, a list that includes Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, and Dune.\n\nWrede’s novels broke new ground in fantasy writing with twists on the literary genres of fantasy, fairytales, and Regency romance, and did much to establish the strong-minded female protagonists that are prevalent in fantasy and science fiction today. Jane Yolen, Wrede’s editor at Harcourt Brace for the Enchanted Forest Chronicles, says, “She was someone who could both work inside genre fiction and make gentle mock of it at the same time. Her prose sang. And her characters simply sparked with life.”\n\nWrede majored in biology at Carleton and earned an MBA from the University of Minnesota in 1977. She has been a\n\nfull-time writer since 1985. In addition to the Enchanted Forest Chronicles, her work includes the Lyra Fantasy series (five novels), the Sorcery and Cecelia series (three novels), three junior novelizations of the Star Wars prequel trilogy, several other novels, and a variety of short stories. Her most recent novels are part of a trilogy, Frontier Magic, which combines fantasy and historical fiction.\n\nWrede, who lives in Edina, Minnesota, has received many award nominations for her writing, including the Minnesota Book Award and American Library Association Notable Children’s Book Award. She is also in demand as a speaker at conferences of educators, librarians, and writers.\n\nDiane Harrison Ogawa ’84 • Exceptional Service\n\nA consistently dedicated Carleton volunteer throughout her adult life, Ogawa’s service to the College is notable in its variety and depth. Over the years, Ogawa has participated in nearly every opportunity for Carleton alumni volunteers, strengthening the College through her creativity and initiative in admissions, fundraising, governance, and alumni engagement.\n\nClassmate Nancy Pellowe Dennis writes, “Everything Diane does, not only for Carleton but likely for everyone who comes in contact with her at any time, is done with energy, passion, intelligence, and grace. Just as Carleton is a place where teaching students is the top priority, Diane is a volunteer for whom serving students is top priority.”\n\nOgawa cares deeply about admissions and ensuring that Carleton continues to draw the best and brightest students. Ogawa has been an Alumni Admissions Representative since graduating in 1984, served as an admissions team lead for four years, and continues to support recruitment through hosting regional events that draw alumni, students, and prospective students and their families.\n\nA detailed rundown of Ogawa’s service also includes her leadership on the Alumni Board (now the Alumni Council) from 1999 to 2003 (including one year as vice president), her work founding and chairing the New Mexico club, and her involvement planning 1984’s 15th through 30th class reunions. She has a long track record of support and leadership for the Alumni Annual Fund, serving across decades as assistant class agent and chairing her 25th Reunion gift committee. Ogawa joined Carleton’s Board of Trustees as a 25th Reunion Trustee from 2009 to 2012, serving on the enrollment and admissions and external relations committees.\n\nAfter graduating with a sociology and anthropology major at Carleton and earning a JD from Harvard Law School, Ogawa worked in corporate banking and real estate law before making a career shift to philanthropy. For the past 14 years she has led the corporate citizenship efforts of New Mexico’s largest utility, serving as executive director of the PNM Resources Foundation. She serves on numerous community boards and is a past chair of the United Way’s Women in Leadership initiative.\n\nHigher education and philanthropy have been part of Ogawa’s life since growing up in Luverne, Minnesota, as the daughter of a higher education fundraiser. Ogawa and her husband, Greg Ogawa ’85, are the parents of two daughters and live in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\nClara Jeffery ’89 • Distinguished Achievement\n\nUnder Clara Jeffery’s leadership, Mother Jones magazine has become widely recognized and respected as being on the forefront of American investigative journalism. Under her co-editorship, wrote one critic/observer, Jeffery has “pulled off one of journalism’s most difficult tasks: burnishing a venerable magazine’s reputation in the digital age.” The spectacular growth and innovation of the non-profit Mother Jones is even more notable against the backdrop of journalism’s overall contraction.\n\nJeffery’s accomplishments have been widely recognized. Among numerous other awards, Mother Jones has been nominated four times in recent years for the industry’s highest honor, the National Magazine Award for General Excellence, and has won the award twice, in 2008 and 2012. Mother Jones also won the 2012 Izzy Stone Award, presented by the Park Center for Independent Media Publishing. Most recently, in 2013 the PEN American Center awarded Jeffery and Mother Jones co-editor Monica Bauerlein the prestigious Nora Magdid Award for excellence in magazine editing.\n\nThe contributions of Jeffery and Mother Jones are not just measured through awards, however. Anyone who followed the 2012 presidential election will remember Republican candidate Mitt Romney’s infamous “47 percent” comments. It was Mother Jones’s Washington bureau, which Jeffery and her coeditor established, that pursued and broke this story, which played a major role in the campaign. In an era in which many other publications have reduced or eliminated their investigative presence in Washington, the “MoJo” Washington bureau now has 12 reporters and editors.\n\nEleven pieces Jeffery has personally edited have been finalists for National Magazine Awards. Jeffery’s work has also been chosen to appear in Best American Science Writing, Best American Essays, Best American Travel Writing, and Best American Sports Writing.\n\nAfter Carleton, Jeffery obtained a graduate degree from Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism. She began her journalistic career at Washington City Paper, then served as a senior editor of Harper’s. Jeffery lives in San Francisco with her partner, Chris Baum, and their five-year-old son.\n\nMark Applebaum ’89 • Distinguished Achievement\n\nIn the world of contemporary experimental music, composer and educator Mark Applebaum is well known for creating works that challenge the conventional boundaries of music. From his Carleton years to today he has impelled audiences to confront and think about music in radical new ways.\n\nApplebaum’s solo, chamber, choral, orchestral, operatic, and electro-acoustic compositions have been performed on six continents. The Merce Cunningham Dance Company and Vienna Modern Festival are among the many organizations that have commissioned his work. He engages in inter-media collaborations with filmmakers, florists, animators, architects, choreographers, and laptop DJs. Applebaum also is an accomplished jazz pianist whose music appears on multiple labels, and he designs and constructs original instruments that he calls sound-sculptures.\n\n“Mark’s compositions are impeccably crafted and imbued with earnestness and a kind of giddiness about creating music,” wrote Carleton professor Alex Freeman. “A force in the world of modern music,” says Carleton professor Andrew Flory. Applebaum’s 2012 TED talk, seen by almost one million viewers, describes his motivation for undertaking roles beyond that of the traditional composer—performance artist, carpenter, choreographer, dramaturge, and more.\n\nAt Carleton, Applebaum received the Larsen Award for Distinction in the Creative and Performing Arts. He earned a PhD in music composition at the University of California at San Diego. In addition to his artistic output, Applebaum is dedicated to teaching. He returned to Carleton as the Dayton-Hudson Visiting Scholar before assuming a tenure-track position at Mississippi State University in 1997.\n\nIn 2000 Applebaum joined the faculty of Stanford University, where he is currently associate professor of composition. He was named Hazy Family University Fellow and Edith and Leland Smith Faculty Scholar, and received the university’s highest distinction for excellence in teaching in 2003. In 2012 he convened the first-ever national conference to examine the state of music composition pedagogy in higher education.\n\nApplebaum is married to Joan Friedman, whom he met in high school during freshman algebra class. They have one daughter.\n\nJonathan Capehart ’89 • Distinguished Achievement\n\nJonathan Capehart ranks in the top echelons of Carleton alumni journalists. Capehart and the New York Daily News editorial board received a Pulitzer Prize for their series on Harlem’s Apollo Theatre that effectively rescued it from the financial mismanagement that threatened the landmark’s survival. Capehart is credited with leading this effort and playing a key role in the investigative journalism and editorial writing that led to the award.\n\nCapehart’s ongoing work for nationally recognized organizations in the highly competitive news markets of New York and Washington sets him apart and speaks to his influence in the field. “He is a new kind of opinion journalist: a blogger who doesn’t just sit back and tell readers what he thinks, but one who is consistently reporting,” says Washington Post editorial page editor Fred Hiatt. “He looks to persuade and enlarge understanding, not to belittle. In today’s media culture, that makes him a rare and valuable contributor.”\n\nCapehart’s commitment to excellence in journalism has been evident from his early work with the Carletonian, Carleton Observer, and KRLX. “Decency, critical inquiry, humor, lack of pretense, intellectual honesty, a devotion to public interest—these are things that are signatures of the Carleton community,” notes Politico founder John Harris ’85. “These values are amply reflected in Jonathan’s work.”\n\nRaised in New Jersey, Capehart was a post-graduate assistant to Carleton President Stephen R. Lewis Jr. in 1989–90. He then moved to New York City, where he worked for the WNYC Foundation and The Today Show. In 1993 Capehart moved to the Daily News where, as well as doing daily reporting, he became the youngest-ever member of the paper’s editorial board, serving until 2000.\n\nHe then joined Bloomberg News as national affairs columnist. Soon after, Capehart took a leave of absence to become the first person to join Michael Bloomberg’s campaign for mayor of New York, serving as a policy adviser. After the election Capehart served with Bloomberg’s transition staff and then returned to Bloomberg News. From 2002 to 2005, he served as deputy editorial page editor of the Daily News.\n\nIn 2007, Capehart joined the Washington Post editorial board, his current position, where he writes about politics and social issues for the PostPartisan blog. He is also a contributor to various programs on MSNBC and is a frequent guest on political television shows.\n\nCapehart was a 2011 Esteem honoree, which recognizes efforts for the African American and LGBT communities by those involved in entertainment, media, civil rights, business and art. He gave the keynote address for Carleton’s Opening Convocation in fall 2013.\n\nJay Rubenstein ’89 • Distinguished Achievement\n\nJay Rubenstein is a medieval historian whose articulation of a new, more complex understanding of the cultural, religious, and intellectual life of the 11th and 12th centuries is transforming the field. Rubenstein is “one of the most skilled, imaginative, and hard-working medieval historians currently in the profession,” one nominator wrote.\n\nAfter writing a widely acclaimed book on the 12th-century monk and scholar Guibert of Nogent, Rubenstein received three of the most prestigious awards given for scholarship in the humanities. In 2006–07 he received a Burkhardt Fellowship from the American Council of Learned Societies for research in Rome, followed by a year of additional research in Paris supported by a National Endowment for the Humanities fellowship. While in Paris he was named a MacArthur Fellow for the period from 2008 to 2012.\n\nHis recent work, Armies of Heaven: The First Crusade and the Quest for Apocalypse (Basic Books, 2011) received the Ralph Waldo Emerson Prize from Phi Beta Kappa’s national office. The book, a beautifully written and challengingly revisionist interpretation of the First Crusade based on a complete re-examination of all the relevant primary sources, “is a brilliant piece of work and would be the shining jewel to a historian’s shelf,” notes the San Francisco Book Review.\n\nJay Rubenstein received an MPhil (1992) from the University of Oxford, St. John’s College, and a PhD (1997) from the University of California–Berkeley. He was an assistant professor of history at the University of New Mexico (1999–2006) prior to joining the faculty at the University of Tennessee, where he is currently the Alvin and Sally Beman Professor of History. Rubenstein taught at Carleton as a Headley House Distinguished Visiting Professor in 2009.\n\nThomas E. Burman, Distinguished Professor of the Humanities at the University of Tennessee, says of Rubenstein, “In him Carleton has produced one of the great scholars of this new century.”\n\nRubenstein and his wife, Meredith McGroarty, have one son.\n\nMichael Rhodes ’99 • In the Spirit of Carleton\n\nMichael Rhodes’s exceptional service as a physician at home and abroad is helping to build innovative and self-sustaining models for medical systems in developing countries. He is one of the founding champions of the Tufundishane Collaborative, a medical exchange between Tanzania and the University of Minnesota (UMN) designed to enhance medical education and build lasting partnerships to improve patient outcomes and, ultimately, save lives.\n\nWhile attending medical school at UMN from 2001 to 2005, Rhodes founded a free clinic in Minneapolis, the Phillips Neighborhood Clinic. The clinic is focused on holistic care and is staffed by a multidisciplinary group of university health care students. In 2009, the year he formed Tufundishane Collaborative, Rhodes also volunteered as a physician at the American Refugee Committee displaced persons camp in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and became staff physician at Abbott Northwestern Hospital in Minneapolis.\n\nTufundishane Collaborative works at Arusha Lutheran Medical Center and Selian Hospital in Arusha, Tanzania. Tufundishane is a Swahili word meaning “to learn from one another.” University of Minnesota faculty physician and residents make rounds with local doctors, creating a constant exchange of learning and trust. After having established the collaborative model, Rhodes now works to explore what is the most effective and sustainable model for outside physicians to work internationally. The goal is intellectual capacity building, so Tanzanians have the skills and expertise to care for their own people.\n\n“Essentially, Mike took ‘medical tourism,’ something a lot of doctors do once, and turned it into a long-term learning relationship built on a philosophy of humble, open-minded learners on both sides,” wrote his nominators. “His work is helping to change health care in a meaningful and lasting way.”\n\nRhodes says his most significant accomplishment is his daily work with patients, families, and medical trainees on the wards every day in Minneapolis or Arusha: “There is no single accomplishment—rather, it’s the amazing opportunity to help people.”\n\nRyeon Corsi ’09 • In the Spirit of Carleton\n\nValuing service over salary, Ryeon Corsi has spent the five years since her graduation from Carleton championing environmental and educational issues in a wide range of positions and making a difference in each of the communities she has encountered. Corsi’s commitment to energetic, inquisitive, and innovative service embodies unique values cultivated through her Carleton education.\n\n“Ryeon’s desire to help others has no physical, ethnic, racial, or economic boundaries,” her nominators wrote. “No matter where she is or what problem she tackles, she intentionally leaves behind a lasting contribution to the community.”\n\nAs an AmeriCorps member, Corsi was instrumental in creating a community garden in Provincetown, Massachusetts; creating educational websites and video-documentaries in Arizona and California; and developing an after-school activities program for at-risk students at a California high school incorporating dance, African drumming, nutrition, sports, and a mentorship with UCSC undergraduates.\n\nCorsi now serves in the Peace Corps as a forestry extension volunteer in Zambia, where she is working on technological solutions to food security problems and promoting sustainable agriculture techniques. From processing sugar cane into syrups or cassava into marketable snack foods to melding HIV/AIDS prevention programs with tree planting, she challenges her communities to mobilize and to translate thoughts into actions, perhaps to fail, but then to reflect and persist. She was recently featured for her service in a three-part video series for the Peace Corps which will be aired on ZNBC, Zambia’s public television channel.\n\nAt Carleton, Corsi was an American studies major and a captain of the women’s hockey team. She was also a writing tutor at the Write Place and the Summer Writing Program and transcribed the life story of a post-World War II veteran into a published 100-page book. A 2008 Larson International Fellowship recipient, Corsi studied adoption in South Korea and earned a certificate in intercultural communications at Hallym University. She returned to Korea in 2012 on another scholarship from Korean Adoptee Ministries. Her experiences were selected to be visually represented by artist Eun-Kyung Suh, who exhibits her work in universities and galleries around the world.\n\n“Post-Carleton, I’ve found that what compels my travels and service the most is the desire not only to learn from the people I meet but to empower them where I can,” Corsi says. “When you are never fully a community member, the most sustainable activities you can do are to find people who are invested in their local surroundings, encourage their momentum, create tools together to empower others, and ultimately take the back seat to their leadership.”\n\nYvonne Connolly Martin ’58 • Distinguished Achievement\n\nAlready proving her willingness to stand out from the crowd as the only female chemistry/zoology major in the Carleton Class of ’58, Yvonne Connolly Martin went on to become a pioneer in computer assisted drug design.\n\nAided by a National Science Foundation graduate fellowship in chemistry, Martin earned a PhD in chemistry at Northwestern University in 1964. That same year she began working on drug discovery at Abbott Laboratories, interrupting her work briefly to become a visiting scientist in the chemistry department of Pomona College.\n\nUpon resuming her work at Abbott Laboratories, she began what she describes as the most exciting phase of her career, experimenting with using computing to develop mathematical models that could aid in the design of new drug molecules. Rather than focusing on the chemical structure, Martin worked to calculate the properties of molecules that might be relevant to biological activity. Her methods were applied to drug discovery programs on hypertension, Parkinson’s disease, ulcers, bacterial infections, arthritis, and angina.\n\nMartin’s significant contributions to her profession go beyond the lab. She has written 23 review articles and more than 100 research publications, edited six books, and registered eight patents. She published the widely used textbook Quantitative Drug Design, was a visiting professor for five years at the University of Virginia College of Pharmacy, served on the editorial advisory board for 11 scientific journals, and organized numerous conferences on computer-assisted drug design.\n\nThroughout her career Martin has supported study sections for the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation. In 1985 she was named a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and in 2000 a fellow of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). She is a lifetime member of the Molecular Modeling and Graphics Society, and from 2009–13 she was a titular member of the Division of Chemistry and Human Health for IUPAC.\n\nOther professional citations include the Accomplishment Award from the Society for Biomolecular Sciences and the Herman Skolnik Award from the American Chemical Society. For more than 20 years, Martin has been associated with the International Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship & Modeling Society, serving as both a board member and as its chair.\n\nAlthough she retired in 2006, as a Senior Research Fellow with Abbott Laboratories’ Volwiler Society, she continues her research as a contractor for Abbott Laboratories/AbbVie.\n\nMartin is married to William Brady Martin; the couple has two daughters and lives in Waukegan, Illinois.\n\nElaine Johnson Tatham ’58 • Distinguished Achievement\n\nElaine Johnson Tatham is a pioneer recognized for founding and growing a successful business in a time when, in the words of one nominator, “women simply didn’t do things like that.” Tatham built ETC Institute—a national public opinion polling company based in Olathe, Kansas—from the ground up and currently serves as president and owner.\n\nStarting with a mere $1,000 investment in 1982, Tatham’s company has grown into a nationally respected research firm that obtains input from people on issues affecting their communities.\n\nDuring the past five years, ETC Institute’s market research results have led to significant funding initiatives by state, municipal, and county governments as well as numerous educational and nonprofit organizations, with projects ranging from improvements to schools and health care institutions to neighborhood and downtown revitalization projects to the development of community centers, aquatics centers, and sports facilities.\n\nA Carleton mathematics major, Tatham earned an MA in mathematics in 1960 and an EdD in educational and psychological research in 1971, both at the University of Kansas (KU). From 1958 to 1971 she was a college mathematics instructor at several institutions.\n\nFrom 1971 to 1981 Tatham was the founding director of institutional research at Johnson County Community College in Overland Park, Kansas, and from 1981 to 1982 she was vice president of Padgett-Thompson. Tatham began a 10-year stint on the City of Olathe Planning Commission in 1982, serving as its chair in 1987–88. She was president of the Mathematics Section, State of Kansas, Mathematical Association of America (1979–80) and chair of the Citizens’ Advisory Committee to the Kansas City Power & Light Company from 1982 to 1990.\n\nSince 1984 Tatham has served on the board of the Olathe Health System, and from 1983 to 2001 she was an adjunct lecturer in the KU graduate engineering management program, with specialties\n\nTatham, have two children and five grandchildren. Her son, Christopher, works with her at ETC Institute. The Tathams live in Olathe, Kansas.\n\nMichael Tuck ’58 • Distinguished Achievement\n\nMichael Tuck is an internationally esteemed expert and researcher in the fields of diabetes and hypertension. Nominated for the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology in 2006, Dr. Tuck has enjoyed a remarkable career in the field of medicine, publishing more than 400 research and clinical trial articles and is one of the world’s experts on diabetes. A Carleton biology major, Dr. Tuck earned an MD degree at the University of Minnesota.
