Registration is open for “High Spots in a Low Dive – Doris Fish Home Movies 1981 to 1991,” a “stand up lecture with moving pictures” by @therealphilliprford , director of the cult film classic \"Vegas in Space\" (1991) and \"honorary straight man\" in the legendary San Francisco drag troupe Sluts A-Go-Go.\n\nFor a while now, the Tenderloin Museum has been obsessed with Ford’s extensive video documentation of Doris and the Sluts–his “home movies–and many of the “high spots” happened in the TL at the neighborhood’s premiere nightclub for the gritty and glamorous: Club 181. Ford first gave this presentation earlier this year at the National State Library in Sydney, Australia during its annual Mardi Gras LGBTQ celebration, at which Ms. Fish was an honoree. After a spectacular reading and panel discussion with Craig Seligman about his Doris Fish biography “Who Does That Bitch Think She Is?” last month, Ford has agreed to give “High Spots in a Low Dive” its American premiere at the Tenderloin Museum, taking audiences on a journey through an oft-overlooked yet essential period of drag theater history, ft. clips from \"Nightclub of the Living Dead,\" \"The Happy Hour Show,\" \"Bad Seed,\" \"Gay Cable Network\" and \"The Sluts A-Go-Go All Star Gang Bang.\"\n\nBring your Pride Weekend afterglow to the TL for a movie night with the maestro on Thursday, June 29th from 5:30-7:30pm. Registration is via Eventbrite and free or a $10 suggested donation.\".",
