Jane Dornacker

Jane Dornacker met Doris Fish after Doris joined the Tubes for a three week stint in 1976 after winning the Tubes talent contest. Jane was a member of the band and wrote their 1976 song “Don’t Touch Me There”. She formed the band Leila and the Snakes with Pearl E Gates, the co-winner of the talent contest. That band broke up in 1978 when Pearl went on the form Pearl Harbor and the Explosions and Jane went into stand-up comedy and acting.

Jane was managed for a time by Eddie Troia and in November 1980 he brought her onto the cast of Blonde Sin with the Sluts A Go-Go, adding much needed professionalism and star power to the production. She left the show later in the run and was replaced by Ginger Quest.

Her career in stand-up comedy and theater made her a local celebrity in San Francisco and her work with playwright Sam Shepard led her to be cast in a small role in the movie The Right Stuff.

After starting work as a helicopter news radio traffic reporter in San Francisco, she moved to New York City and worked for WNBC radio. She survived a helicopter crash in April 1986, but was killed in a second crash on October 22, 1986 when her chopper crashed in the Hudson River.

A memorial tribute concert was held in San Francisco for her at the Warfield Theater on November 22, 1986. The Sluts A Go-Go performed on a bill that included Jerry Garcia and The Tubes.
