When Miri wanted to help out in the quarry, she didn’t know why her pa didn’t want her to go. When the traders come, the people of Mount Eskel didn’t know that the chief delegate was going to come. He told them that they would be taking the girls away to an academy to decide whom the prince will marry. When the trading is over Miri doesn’t bring home everything that she wants to. The next morning soldiers arrive to take the girls away to the academy. While at the academy the girls get sent to the closet or get palm-lashings when they get punished, but when Miri was talking to all of the girls while leaving the classroom she ruins the chance for all of the girls to visit their families. When Tutor Olana shows the dress the academy princess gets to wear, the girls get more motivated.
