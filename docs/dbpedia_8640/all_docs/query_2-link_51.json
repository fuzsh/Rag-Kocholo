        "text": "When Lady Saren refuses to marry a man she doesn’t love, she and her maid are sentenced to seven years in a tower prison. Just when things are getting really bad, two potential love interests arrive.\n\nLike her brother Liefer before her, Enna has discovered the key to wielding fire as a weapon in battle. Will the power consume her? This fantasy tale is a companion to other Books of Bayern titles listed here.\n\nWhy has Rin become uneasy in her forest home and distrustful of her neighbors? And will a journey deeper into the Forest, toward the enemy, offer any solace? This fantasy tale is a companion to other Books of Bayern titles listed here.\n\nThis re-telling of the familiar fairy tale is set in the Wild West and features a spunky heroine who teams partners with Jack (of the Beanstalk) to fight injustice.\n\nWhen Razo, the victim of constant bullying, is selected for a special mission representing his country, he learns to appreciate himself and assumes an important role negotiating peace between warring countries. This fantasy tale is a companion to other Books of Bayern titles listed here.\n\nWhen the Crown Princess of Kildenree is passed over for the throne and sent to marry the prince of Bayern, she escapes and disguises herself as a goose until she is able to reclaim the throne that is rightfully hers. Based on the Grimm’s fairy tale, this story-the first in the Books of Bayern series-is filled with treachery and romance, and features a powerful female protagonist."
