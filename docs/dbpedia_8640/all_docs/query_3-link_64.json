        "text": "Utah author Shannon Hale is writing a third book in the Princess Academy series, she announced on her blog squeetus.com this week.\n\nThe first book in the series, “Princess Academy,” was published in 2005 and received a Newbery Honor. She wrote the second book, \"Palace of Stone,\" in secret. It was released last year.\n\nThe next installment in the Princess Academy series, which revolves around the stories of Miri, a young girl from the stone quarry village on Mount Eskel, and her friends, will likely be published in 2015, Hale wrote, adding that the current working title is “Dragonfly Sisters.”\n\nIn the first book, the prince will choose his princess from the girls on Mount Eskel and an academy is set up to teach Miri and the girls from her village. In “Palace of Stone,” they go to the capital for the prince’s wedding and encounter the rumblings of a revolution, testing both their love and loyalty.\n\n“While working (on) 'Palace of Stone,' another burning question haunted me,” Hale wrote. “And the only way to answer it was to write a third book in the series.”\n\nHale is also the author of several other books for middle readers, including the Books of Bayern series, and co-authored graphic novels “Calamity Jack” and “Rapunzel’s Revenge” with her husband.\n\nHer books for older audiences include “Austenland,” “Midnight in Austenland” and “The Actor and the Housewife.” A movie adaptation of \"Austenland\" was screened at Sundance earlier this year and will be opening in August in New York and Los Angeles, according to sonyclassics.com/austenland."
