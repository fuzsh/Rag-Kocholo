In this third book in New York Times bestselling, Newbery Honor-winning author Shannon Hale's Princess Academy series, Miri goes from student . . . to teacher! Miri has spent a year at the king's palace, learning all about being a proper princess. But instead of returning to her beloved Mount Eskel, Miri is ordered to journey to a distant swamp and start a princess academy for three sisters, cousins of the royal family. Unfortunately, Astrid, Felissa, and Sus are more interested in hunting and fishing than becoming princesses. As Miri spends more time with the sisters, she realizes the king and queen's interest in them hides a long-buried secret. She must rely on her own strength and intelligence to unravel the mystery, protect the girls, complete her assignment, and finally make her way home.\n\nGenre\n\nAudiobook"
