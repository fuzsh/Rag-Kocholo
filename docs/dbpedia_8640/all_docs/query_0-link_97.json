        "text": "Coming down from the mountain to a new life in the city is a thrill to Miri. She and her princess academy friends have been brought to Asland to help the future princess Britta prepare for her wedding.There, Miri also has a chance to attend school-at the Queen's Castle. But as Miri befriends students who seem sophisticated and exciting she also learns that they have some frightening plans. Torn between loyalty to the princess and her new friends' ideas, between an old love and a new crush, and between her small mountain home and the bustling city, Miri looks to find her own way in this new place.\n\nPicking up where Princess Academy left off, and celebrating the joys of friendship, romance and the fate of fairy tale kingdoms, this new book delivers the completely delightful new story that fans have been waiting for.\n\nSince the publication of her first book, The Goose Girl, in 2003, Shannon has become a beloved author to young readers as well as booksellers and educators. Her third novel, Princess Academy, earned her a Newbery Honor and is a New York Times, Book Sense, and Publishers Weekly bestseller. Shannon has also written three books for adults, Austenland (now in production to be a major motion picture starring Keri Russell), Midnight in Austenland, and The Actor and the Housewife. Shannon lives near Salt Lake City, Utah, with her husband, the author Dean Hale, and their four children.\n\nwww.shannonhale.com\n\n“Palace of Stone . . . proves once again that with quick wit and brave words, one person really can change the world.” ―School Library Journal\n\n“Powerful and deeply engaging. . . .
