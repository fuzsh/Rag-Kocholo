        "text": "PROVO — An original play adaptation of a New York Times bestselling novel can now be seen on stage at Brigham Young University.\n\nShannon Hale’s “Princess Academy” was directed by BYU associate theater professor Megan Sanborn Jones and adapted by Utah Valley University assistant theater professor Lisa Hall Hagen. BYU dramaturg specialist Janine Sobeck also worked on the production as the new play dramaturg.\n\n“Taken from her home to attend royal finishing school, Miri faces a harsh schoolmistress, fierce storms, and bandits, but soon discovers the power of friendship and a loving heart,” the play synopsis says.\n\nJones worked for a long time to secure the rights to adapt the book and proposed the idea to Hagen, who told KSL.com she was honored that Jones wanted to work with her and trusted her with the task.\n\n“I think one of the big things we had to do was take a look at the book and say, you know, for us as readers who admire the book and as theater majors, what is at the heart of the story?”\n\nFor Hagen, it was about how Miri saw herself. At the beginning of the show, Miri doesn’t think she has a lot of worth and doesn’t connect to many people around her, but she finds her voice both literally and figuratively throughout the course of the play, Hagen said.\n\n“All of the great, suspenseful things that happen, to me, are all in the service of watching Miri go on this journey and become someone who is more sure of herself and sure of where she wants to be and where she belongs,” Hagen said.\n\nJones said she wanted to adapt “Princess Academy” into a play because she’s always loved Shannon Hale’s work and thinks it’s appropriate for the Utah Valley audiences, because it’s about families, education and powerful young women.\n\nShannon Hale told KSL.com she plans to see the play June 13 and will participate with the director in a Q and A session.\n\nHale said it feels great to see her book adapted into a play and compared it to her book \"Austenland\" being adapted into a movie.\n\n“It is a really cool experience because, you know the book is inside my own head, I only ever see the images inside my own head and so to see them come out and see the characters come to life, it’s very exciting.”\n\nHale added that the author only does half the work in storytelling and the reader does the other half, and the reader brings their own experiences and ideas to build a different story.\n\n“I think seeing the play of my book or a movie of my book is like getting to seeing somebody else’s experience of what it’s like for them when they read it and it may not be exactly what I imagined, but it’s still a cool, unique story,” Hale said.\n\n“Princess Academy” is a BYU production but has been a collaborative effort between Utah Valley University and Brigham Young University, Jones said.\n\nThe world premiere of \"Princess Academy\" debuted May 29. Performances will continue at the Pardoe Theatre at the Harris Fine Arts Center June 4-6 and 10-13 at 7 p.m. Matinee performances will be June 4, 6, 12 and 13 at 2 p.m.\n\nFor more information about the show, visit the website.\n\n60-minute Lunch and Learn workshops are available for playgoers age 8 and older before matinee performances. BYU student \"Teaching Artists\" will conduct the workshops and provide sack lunches. Workshop attendees will “participate in learning activities building on and inspired by 'Princess Academy,' ” according to the website."
