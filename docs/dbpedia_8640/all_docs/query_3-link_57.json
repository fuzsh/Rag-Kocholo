        "text": "Rating: 5 out of 5 stars\n\nGenre: Fiction\n\nAge Recommendation: 12 and up\n\nThis book was great and I loved how the characters developed throughout the book. Many characters seemed to be placeholders in the beginning, but their importance became clearer as the story progressed.\n\n———————————————\n\nMiri is a mountain girl. For her whole life, she has lived on the mountains with her friends and family, taking care of livestock without a care in the world. She hangs out with her friends and enjoys her life.\n\nOne day, people from the city, lowlanders, come to visit with a message from the king. Any girl over the age of 12 and under the age of 18 will be sent to a Princess Academy. There, they will be tutored and taught the ways of the royal palace until their tutor deems them fit. After that, the prince will arrive and choose one of them to be his wife.\n\nMiri, along with several other girls, are taken away from their families and put in this academy with a horrid tutor. None of them have the chance to enjoy as there are too many rules and too few opportunities to be free like they were used to. When a competition for the first dance with the prince is announced, the girls’ animosity towards each other becomes clearer.\n\nWho will be his future wife?\n\n—\n\nIf you would like to read this book, you can purchase it here: Princess Academy\n\n—"
