        "text": "One of the best books ever written is Ella Enchanted by Gail Carson Levine. It is short, sweet and packs a punch. She was able to take a really interesting concept and combine it with a uniquely quiet yet resilient main character in a fantasy world that has a flavor of its own. In honor of this literary masterpiece I’ve put together a list of other books I have found that are similar. Enjoy!\n\nOther Books by Gail Carson Levine\n\nFairest: this one is set in the same world as Ella Enchanted and even has one of the same characters! It is about Areida’s sister and the country, Bast. Next to Ella Enchanted this is my favorite book by Gail Carson Levine.\n\nOgre Enchanted: This is a prequel to Ella Enchanted, and while it’s not nearly as good I still found it refreshing and entertaining! The characters were charming and the story was interesting.\n\nSimilar Books\n\nPrincess Academy (Princess Academy, #1): The main character Miri shares many characteristics with Ella, she is a bit of an outcast in her community yet is very resilient and forward-thinking. The story is set in a fantasy land in the mountains. The characters don’t travel a lot in the first book, but the love story is similar and there’s still plenty of action.\n\nThe Goose Girl (The Books of Bayern, #1): Another book about an outcast, I think the setting in this is more similar to Ella Enchanted.\n\nHowl’s Moving Castle (Howl’s Moving Castle, #1): The magic in here is a little more bizarre and less well thought out than in Ella Enchanted, but the romance between the two main characters is golden!\n\nSummers at Castle Auburn by Sharon Shinn is good! That’s more geared towards a YA audience I believe, but is good. Also the main character is a little more concerned with appearances and less intelligent and down to earth than Ella.\n\nI would also try Greensleeves by Eloise Jarvis McGraw, it has a really sweet romance, but it’s not magical. I think the main character reminds me of Ella Enchanted though.\n\nGoose Chase: is lighthearted and fun! The romance isn’t as well developed as Ella Enchanted, but it’s still good.\n\nThe Sherwood Ring: This one is historical fiction / fantasy. The main character is visited by her ancestors when she visits an old mansion and they tell her their stories. The main character has plenty of gumption, like Ella, and the fantasy aspect is similar in a way as well.\n\nThe Wide-Awake Princess: This one is a retelling of Sleeping Beauty, and is about Beauty’s sister, Annie, who doesn’t have any magical gifts. This turns out to be her greatest asset when she sets off to save her kingdom!\n\nThe Runaway Princess by Kate Coombs: while not as deep or profound as Ella Enchanted, this lighthearted fantasy is so much fun to read! The story is about Meg, who rebels against her father and escapes from the tower he put her in.\n\nRecommendations from other bloggers\n\nSeveral other bloggers have put together lists as well, be sure to check them out! I’ve ranked them by how accurate I think they are.\n\nElla Enchanted – Gail Carson Levine – What Should I Read: There’s a lot of good fantasy recommendations here, I think the list is pretty good, but not great.\n\nBooks like Ella Enchanted – TasteDive: This list is just okay.\n\nGoodRead’s List: This isn’t very good in my humble opinion, but still might be worth perusing. There are a lot of books on there that aren’t anything like Ella Enchanted, so I’m not sure how they got there, but hey!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
