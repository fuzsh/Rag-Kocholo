        "text": "Are we just talking only young family friendly stuff here. Seems limiting considering the Mouse's vast movie empire.\n\nHow about a decent, feature-length Dresden File? With a Jurassic Park-type budget, that could be killer. Although personally I would love to see someone tackle the Wheel of Time I've given that up as a lost cause.\n\nHopefully I'm already getting John Carter. And possibly Solomon Kane. But I'd love to see some REH or ERB characters like Sailor Steve Costigan, Billy Byrne (The Mucker) or Francis Xavier Gordon (El Borak) - I think the last would put even the first Indiana Jones to shame if done right.\n\nThen again, what about the Horselcans? TimeWars? On the heels of Avatar, maybe a decent Battletech (Exodus, 3039 or Clan Invasion).\n\nThough it's a bit depressing I would love to see an adaptation of one of my favorite books from my childhood which is The Little Prince.\n\nAlso as a child I had an obsession with The Snow Queen by the Great Hans Christian Andersen.\n\nWell not to quote myself but it looks like Disney has made The Snow Queen and I guess we will be seeing it this fall."
