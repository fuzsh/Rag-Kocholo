They feature over 150 itineraries that take passengers all around the globe, from the clear blue waters of the Caribbean to bucket-list destinations like Alaska. Their dedication to customer service and innovative amenities has made Princess Cruises a leader in not only the cruising industry, but the entire travel industry.\n\nHow can our travel agents learn more about Princess Cruises? One of the best ways to expand your knowledge is to enroll in supplier courses, like Princess Academy. Princess Academy guides agents as they rise through the educational levels from First Officer to Commodore. As you increase your familiarity with the brand’s ships, itineraries, and additional offerings, you’ll also be working toward incredible benefits which are achieved after reaching the Commodore level!\n\nPrincess Academy strives to teach agents to sell cruises more effectively. Courses include how to break into the luxury travel market and how to bring back clients for repeat cruises. These strategies allow agents to increase their commissions and build a loyal base of clients who will continue to use them to book travel and to recommend their agent’s services to family, friends, and coworkers.\n\nAgents receive specific information on the different ships within the Princess fleet and the itineraries that are offered for each of those ships. There is additional education offered for agents to become a Princess Alaska Expert. Many clients dream of seeing the wilderness of Alaska in person and cruising is one of the best opportunities to do so. With the variety of itineraries and shore excursions that highlight this gorgeous frontier, becoming a Princess Alaska Expert is an ideal way to find the best cruise for these in-demand and high-ticket cruises. This can help all agents, but especially those who specialize in cruising, by enabling then to accurately and expertly market to their clients.\n\nOnce an agent completes their Commodore level courses, they are eligible for exclusive marketing materials as part of the Commodore marketing kit. This includes logos, press releases, email tags, and other marketing support to use online and in printed communications to announce your achievement level with Princess Cruises and build your reputation as a travel agent.\n\nCompleting the Commodore level also earns an agent a free Graduation Cruise Course. This is the final step in the Princess Academy program and allows agents to experience Princess up close and in person.\n\nAs many agents know, a combination of firsthand experience and detailed knowledge provides the easiest and most sincere way to market and sell a travel product to clients.\n\nIf you are a KHM Travel Agent interested in learning more about Princess Cruises, join us at the 2019 Crystal Conference and Awards aboard the Ruby Princess!
