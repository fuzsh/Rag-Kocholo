        "text": "Book Summary:\n\nThis is the story of a group of girls from a remote mountain village sent to an academy to learn to behave like princesses. Some of them hope to be chosen to be the prince's choice and future queen, but they have been brought up to value hard work far more than genteel manners or sumptuous clothes. This book will appeal to any reader who knows what it's like to feel left out, as well as to readers who admire courage in ordinary people.\n\nBook Review:\n\nThis title isn't the best fit for this text, in my view. This isn't a stereotypical pretty clothes princess kind of a story - it's more cerebral, and the distinct language patterns and supernatural element are a bit odd for some readers. This is a text worth the effort; it's not a shallow excursion. It is a great story about a girl who discovers her own power."
