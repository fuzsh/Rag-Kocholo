        "text": "After the game on Sunday, I felt really annoyed, probably the first time at Villa Park this season. I’m a patient fan, often accused of being too loyal and positive regarding Aston Villa FC. I was pretty annoyed with aspects of the display and I must admit it is getting a bit tiresome paying for fuel from London to every home game to watch us lose or draw, never mind the season ticket money. However, it wasn’t these things that got on my nerves; it was some of our “supporters”. I use the term “supporters” loosely. I don’t…\n\nIt was my second year as a season ticket holder at Villa Park. I was ten years of age and and the 1995-96 season was special for a number of reasons: it was the season in which we won the League Cup with a 3-0 victory over Leeds, it was the season I fell in love with my all-time favourite Villa player Ian Taylor and it was the season we beat Manchester United 3-1 at Villa Park on the first day. That season remains special even today and will be until we break what I can only describe as a…\n\nOn Friday, it’s time for thirty-two nations to find out who they will be playing in the group stages of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. There will be a few interested viewers in our claret and blue camp. This week, I am going to take a look at the World Cup candidates who ply their trade in claret and blue. How many players will we have representing their countries in Brazil? Brad Guzan (USA) Our number 1 has 24 Caps for the USA at the time of writing. Unfortunately for Brad Guzan, Tim Howard has 96 and is in…\n\nAfter a weekend of pulsating Premier League football, the two sides from the midlands did their very best to put on a show as well. I imagine it was a fantastic game for the neutral – a real game of two halves – with Villa fans probably going home the happier. It was practically the same story as last season but this time round the Baggies threw away a two goal lead rather than the Villans. I know which game I preferred watching! Teams cannot afford to start a game like we did and expect to take anything from it.…\n\nAs Villa fans speculate over who will the next big thing to break into our first team from the academy, there is one man who appears to be almost forgotten – Gary Gardner. In recent years I don’t remember there being many youngsters at Villa Park who have warranted the hype that Gardner did a few years ago. Unfortunately, since then injuries have stalled his career and at the end of this current campaign Gary is out of contract. Gardner has not really kicked a ball for Villa for over a year. He is yet to be involved this season…\n\nIt has emerged that our first choice goalkeeper, Brad Guzan, has not been included in the USA squad due to a mystery injury. I’m hearing it is precautionary and I am sure he will be available for the West Brom game in two weeks’ time. Hats off to Brad: he was sure to get a run out in one of the friendlies so it’s pleasing that he seems to have put the club first and pulled out as a precaution. However, I think there is a debate surrounding our goalkeepers, whether Brad Guzan is fit or not. Currently, Guzan is…\n\nLessons have certainly been learnt from last campaign. The fact that the defence has been shored up supports that view. We no longer look a complete shambles when the ball comes into our penalty area and Brad Guzan is not quite as busy as he was last season. The last two away games have yielded two clean sheets. Unfortunately, the last four games have seen us fail to score against Hull, Spurs, Everton and West Ham. Not scoring is something of a new problem and something that my fellow writers on this site have covered in other articles. I would…\n\nOn September 21st something that didn’t happen at all during the previous season occurred when Matty Lowton was left out of the line up. The former Sheffield United man was not injured or even carrying a knock; Paul Lambert left him out because he was not showing the same high level of performace as in the previous campaign. Since Matty Lowton was dropped he has struggled to regain his place, only starting one match, which was the 0-4 hammering we took against Spurs in the Cup. That was a largely second string side and it’s fair to say Lowton didn’t make…\n\nAs Libor Kozak was substituted in the second half on Sunday, I awaited a few ironic cheers in the Upper Holte. They soon came and it appeared some had their new scapegoat. I’m not going to pretend that Libor Kozak has been dynamite since he joined but let’s have a little bit of perspective. The striker has started three games for us, off the back of scoring the winner against Norwich at Carrow Road when he came on as an early substitute. His biggest crime so far seems to be that he is not Christian Benteke yet who’s to say…\n\nAs we are in the midst of an international break, I found myself browsing our fixtures. I was unsure who we face after the next two home games. Immediately, my eyes were drawn to West Bromwich Albion (away) and a feeling of dread then came over me. What if we lose? I’m probably in the minority here but I don’t enjoy derby matches and I hope Birmingham City FC doesn’t return to the top tier for some time. I can’t handle the build-up or the fear and dread that come with derby day. Of course, some of my favourite moments in the…"
