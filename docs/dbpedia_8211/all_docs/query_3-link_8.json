        "text": "The \"football fates\" have decreed that Manchester City's encounters with Liverpool have -- in the main -- been an absolute disaster.\n\nAlthough it is abundantly clear to all that modern times have brought about a dramatic change in City's relationship with the other clubs in the Premier League, there are still one or two outstanding engagements that do not seem to want to go to plan. Visiting Arsenal is one of them, the other, most certainly, is matches against Liverpool, either at home or away.\n\nLiverpool have caused City supporters more heartache and embarrassment than any team around. At some point, the law of averages suggests that the tide will turn, but so far it shows little sign of doing so.\n\nHere are five examples of City's struggles against Liverpool over the years\n\n- In 1995-96, with certain relegation from the Premier League facing City unless they could beat a supine and lethargic Liverpool side, Kit Symons' levelled the scores with a late equalizer. Liverpool had gone ahead almost despite themselves with an own goal and a deflected shot from Ian Rush. Instead of an all-or-nothing onslaught to save their souls, City were instructed by manager Alan Ball to hold the ball up at the corner flag. The image of Steve Lomas protecting an utterly useless 2-2 draw will stay with those there that afternoon for the rest of their lives\n\n- That same 1995-96 season had also seen two humiliating games at Anfield within the space of four days. A 4-0 midweek defeat in the League Cup was bad enough, with City starting the game well, but falling apart in the middle 70 minutes. What followed at the weekend was even worse, with a humiliating 6-0 defeat when City returned to Anfield in the League. Ten goals in two games within four days of each other against the same opposition at the same venue. To make matters even worse, manager Alan Ball described watching the game from the touchline as a great pleasure. He was never again seen in the same light by the City faithful.\n\n- In the 80s, Liverpool's ace marksman Ian Rush, who would by the end of his career end up as the club's all-time top scorer, treated matches against City as shooting practice. In the early eighties Liverpool managed to score 14 goals against City in 3 consecutive games (5-0 at Maine Road in 1981-82, 5-2 at Anfield in 1982-83 and 4-0 at Maine Road in the return that season). Rush and his partner in crime Kenny Dalglish were responsible for a large number of the goals scored. The irony of watching Rush slot in time after time came as a result of the fact that ex-City manager Malcolm Allison had tried to buy the sharp shooter from Chester, but was beaten to it by his Liverpool counterpart Bob Paisley. An entire era of painful recollections for City fans could have been avoided if the lanky Welshman had played in sky blue instead of red.\n\n- A variety of cup ties have also been played between the sides in the modern era. Between 1988 and 2001 these seemed to end up with City's hopes dashed and the players lying face down in the winter mud. A 4-0 thrashing at the hands of Liverpool in a Maine Road morass in 1988 was followed by the afore-mentioned embarrassment in the 1995 League Cup game. A 4-2 defeat in 2001 preceded the last ever FA Cup match at Maine Road in 2003, which turned out to be a dreadful anti-climax to all the fantastic cup ties that the old ground had witnessed. Needless to say, despite it being a close and spiritless game, Liverpool still managed to carry off the spoils 1-0.\n\n- The last two cup ties between the two sides have perhaps given a tiny clue to the shifting sands of fortune that, at some stage, must begin to have their influence on this most historically one-sided of fixtures. In 2012-13 Liverpool and City met in the semifinals of the League Cup and, although Liverpool made it through to the final over two hard fought legs, there was a single goal and not much else between the teams by the end. Most recently of all, the two sides contested last season's League Cup final at Wembley, another tough, well-balanced tie that went into extra time and then penalties. With the fickle hand of fate once again hanging ominously over City, Fernandinho missed City's first penalty, but -- with the aid of a one-off display by Willy Caballero -- Liverpool were finally vanquished in the most dramatic fashion possible.\n\nWinning the League Cup represented a counter-balance to the seven goals City shipped in the two league fixtures last season, evidence that the hoodoo continues despite everything. For Pep Guardiola to turn it round at the weekend, he will need all of his tactical genius plus a complete change of mind from the football fates."
