At the top of the English football league system, it is the country's primary football competition. Besides English teams, Welsh teams can also qualify to play, including Swansea since 2011-12, and Cardiff from 2013-14. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the Football League. The Premier League is a corporation in which the 20 member clubs act as shareholders. Seasons run from August to May, with teams playing 38 matches each, totalling 380 matches in the season. Most games are played in the afternoons of Saturdays and Sundays, the other games during weekday evenings. It is currently sponsored by Barclays Bank and thus officially known as the Barclays Premier League. Outside England it is commonly referred to as the English Premier League.\n\nThe competition formed as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992 following the decision of clubs in the Football League First Division to break away from The Football League, which was originally founded in 1888, and take advantage of a lucrative television rights deal. This deal will be worth £3 billion as of 2013–14, with BSkyB and BT Group securing the rights to broadcast 116 and 38 games respectively. The Premier League is the most-watched football league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people. In the 2010–11 season the average Premier League match attendance was 35,363, the second highest of any professional football league other than the German Bundesliga, and stadium occupancy was 92.2% capacity. The Premier League ranked second in the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) coefficients of leagues based on performances in European competitions over the last five years.\n\nSince 1888, a total of 23 clubs have been crowned champions of the English football system. Of the 45 clubs to have competed since the inception of the Premier League in 1992, five have won the title: Manchester United (13), Arsenal (3), Chelsea (3), Blackburn Rovers (1) and Manchester City (1). The current champions are Manchester United, who won the title in the 2012–13 season.\n\nHistory\n\nOrigins\n\nDespite significant European success during the 1970s and early 1980s, the late '80s had marked a low point for English football. Stadia were crumbling, supporters endured poor facilities, hooliganism was rife, and English clubs were banned from European competition for five years following the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985. The Football League First Division, which had been the top level of English football since 1888, was well behind leagues such as Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga in attendances and revenues, and several top English players had moved abroad.\n\nHowever, by the turn of the 1990s the downward trend was starting to reverse; England had been successful in the 1990 FIFA World Cup, reaching the semi-finals. UEFA, European football's governing body, lifted the five-year ban on English clubs playing in European competitions in 1990 (resulting in Manchester United lifting the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1991) and the Taylor Report on stadium safety standards, which proposed expensive upgrades to create all-seater stadia in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster, was published in January of that year.\n\nTelevision money had also become much more important; the Football League received £6.3 million for a two-year agreement in 1986, but when that deal was renewed in 1988, the price rose to £44 million over four years. The 1988 negotiations were the first signs of a breakaway league; ten clubs threatened to leave and form a \"super league\", but were eventually persuaded to stay. As stadia improved and match attendance and revenues rose, the country's top teams again considered leaving the Football League in order to capitalise on the growing influx of money being pumped into the sport.\n\nSeason Champions Runners-up 1992–93 Manchester United Aston Villa 1993–94 Manchester United Blackburn Rovers 1994–95 Blackburn Rovers Manchester United 1995–96 Manchester United Newcastle United 1996–97 Manchester United Newcastle United 1997–98 Arsenal Manchester United 1998–99 Manchester United Arsenal 1999–2000 Manchester United Arsenal 2000–01 Manchester United Arsenal 2001–02 Arsenal Liverpool 2002–03 Manchester United Arsenal 2003–04 Arsenal Chelsea 2004–05 Chelsea Arsenal 2005–06 Chelsea Manchester United 2006–07 Manchester United Chelsea 2007–08 Manchester United Chelsea 2008–09 Manchester United Liverpool 2009–10 Chelsea Manchester United 2010–11 Manchester United Chelsea 2011–12 Manchester City Manchester United 2012–13 Manchester United Manchester City\n\nFoundation\n\nAt the close of the 1991 season, a proposal for the establishment of a new league was tabled that would bring more money into the game overall. The Founder Members Agreement, signed on 17 July 1991 by the game's top-flight clubs, established the basic principles for setting up the FA Premier League. The newly formed top division would have commercial independence from The Football Association and the Football League, giving the FA Premier League licence to negotiate its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements. The argument given at the time was that the extra income would allow English clubs to compete with teams across Europe.\n\nThe managing director of London Weekend Television (LWT), Greg Dyke, met with the representatives of the \"big five\" football clubs in England in 1990. The meeting was to pave the way for a break away from The Football League. Dyke believed that it would be more lucrative for LWT if only the larger clubs in the country were featured on national television and wanted to establish whether the clubs would be interested in a larger share of television rights money. The five clubs decided it was a good idea and decided to press ahead with it; however, the league would have no credibility without the backing of The Football Association and so David Dein of Arsenal held talks to see whether the FA were receptive to the idea. The FA did not enjoy an amicable relationship with the Football League at the time and considered it as a way to weaken the Football League's position.\n\nIn 1992, the First Division clubs resigned from the Football League en masse and on 27 May 1992 the FA Premier League was formed as a limited company working out of an office at the Football Association's then headquarters in Lancaster Gate. This meant a break-up of the 104-year-old Football League that had operated until then with four divisions; the Premier League would operate with a single division and the Football League with three. There was no change in competition format; the same number of teams competed in the top flight, and promotion and relegation between the Premier League and the new First Division remained the same as the old First and Second Divisions with three teams relegated from the league and three promoted.\n\nThe league held its first season in 1992–93 and was originally composed of 22 clubs. The first ever Premier League goal was scored by Brian Deane of Sheffield United in a 2–1 win against Manchester United. The 22 inaugural members of the new Premier League were Arsenal, Aston Villa, Blackburn Rovers, Chelsea, Coventry City, Crystal Palace, Everton, Ipswich Town, Leeds United, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Middlesbrough, Norwich City, Nottingham Forest, Oldham Athletic, Queens Park Rangers, Sheffield United, Sheffield Wednesday, Southampton, Tottenham Hotspur, and Wimbledon. Luton Town, Notts County and West Ham United were the three teams relegated from the old first division at the end of the 1991–92 season, and did not take part in the inaugural Premier League season.\n\nDevelopment\n\nDue to insistence by the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA), the international governing body of football, that domestic leagues reduce the number of games clubs played, the number of clubs was reduced to 20 in 1995 when four teams were relegated from the league and only two teams promoted. On 8 June 2006, FIFA requested that all major European leagues, including Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga be reduced to 18 teams by the start of the 2007–08 season. The Premier League responded by announcing their intention to resist such a reduction. Ultimately, the 2007–08 season kicked off again with 20 teams.\n\nThe league changed its name from the FA Premier League to simply the Premier League in 2007.\n\nWelsh club Swansea City was promoted to the Premier League for the 2011–12 season. They were the first non-English team to compete in the Premier League. On 20 August 2011, the first Premier League match to be played outside England was between Swansea City and Wigan Athletic at the Liberty Stadium in Swansea, Wales. Swansea were followed two years later by Cardiff City, who became the first Welsh team to be promoted to the Premier League as champions of the Football League.\n\nCorporate structure\n\nThe Premier League is operated as a corporation and is owned by the 20 member clubs. Each club is a shareholder, with one vote each on issues such as rule changes and contracts. The clubs elect a chairman, chief executive, and board of directors to oversee the daily operations of the league. The current chairman is Sir Dave Richards, who was appointed in April 1999, and the chief executive is Richard Scudamore, appointed in November 1999. The former chairman and chief executive, John Quinton and Peter Leaver, were forced to resign in March 1999 after awarding consultancy contracts to former Sky executives Sam Chisholm and David Chance. The Football Association is not directly involved in the day-to-day operations of the Premier League, but has veto power as a special shareholder during the election of the chairman and chief executive and when new rules are adopted by the league.\n\nThe Premier League sends representatives to UEFA's European Club Association, the number of clubs and the clubs themselves chosen according to UEFA coefficients. For the 2012–13 season the Premier League has 10 representatives in the Association: Arsenal, Aston Villa, Chelsea, Everton, Fulham, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur. The European Club Association is responsible for electing three members to UEFA's Club Competitions Committee, which is involved in the operations of UEFA competitions such as the Champions League and UEFA Europa League.\n\nCompetition format\n\nCompetition\n\nThere are 20 clubs in the Premier League. During the course of a season (from August to May) each club plays the others twice (a double round-robin system), once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents, for a total of 38 games. Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw. No points are awarded for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, then goal difference, and then goals scored. At the end of each season, the club with the most points is crowned champion. If points are equal, the goal difference and then goals scored determine the winner. If still equal, teams are deemed to occupy the same position. If there is a tie for the championship, for relegation, or for qualification to other competitions, a play-off match at a neutral venue decides rank. The three lowest placed teams are relegated into the Football League Championship, and the top two teams from the Championship, together with the winner of play-offs involving the third to sixth placed Championship clubs, are promoted in their place.\n\nQualification for European competitions\n\nAs of the 2009–10 season qualification for the UEFA Champions League changed, the top four teams in the Premier League qualify for the UEFA Champions League, with the top three teams directly entering the group stage. Previously only the top two teams qualified automatically. The fourth-placed team enters the Champions League at the play-off round for non-champions and must win a two-legged knockout tie in order to enter the group stage. The team placed fifth in the Premier League automatically qualifies for the UEFA Europa League, and the sixth and seventh-placed teams can also qualify, depending on the winners and runners-up of the two domestic cup competitions. Two Europa League places are reserved for the winner of each of the domestic cup competitions; if the winner of the FA Cup qualifies for the Champions League, then that place will go to the runner-up, and if the runner-up is also already qualified, then that place will go to the next-best placed finisher in the Premier League. If the winner of the League Cup has already qualified, that place goes to the next-best placed team in the league. A further place in the UEFA Europa League is also available via the Fair Play initiative. If the Premier League has one of the three highest Fair Play rankings in Europe, the highest ranked team in the Premier League Fair Play standings which has not already qualified for Europe will automatically qualify for the UEFA Europa League first qualifying round.\n\nAn exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after Liverpool won the Champions League the year before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers. UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that if the Champions League winner finished outside the top four in its domestic league, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team in the league. No association can have more than four entrants in the Champions League. This occurred in 2012, when Chelsea – who had won the Champions League the previous year, but finished sixth in the league – qualified for the Champions League in place of Tottenham Hotspur, who went into the Europa League.\n\nIn 2007, the Premier League became the highest ranking European League based on the performances of English teams in European competitions over a five-year period. This broke the eight-year dominance of the Spanish league, La Liga.\n\nThe Premier League has been sponsored since 1993. The sponsor has been able to determine the league's sponsorship name. There have been three sponsors since the league's formation.\n\n1992–1993: No Sponsor (English Premiership)\n\n1993–2001: Carling (FA Carling Premiership)\n\n2001–2004: Barclaycard (Barclaycard Premiership)\n\n2004–present: Barclays (Barclays Premiership (until 2007) then Barclays Premier League)\n\nAs well as sponsorship for the league itself, the Premier League has a number of official partners and suppliers. The official ball supplier for the league is Nike who have had the contract since the 2000–01 season when they took over from Mitre.\n\nFinances\n\nThe Premier League has the highest revenue of any football league in the world, with total club revenues of €2.479 billion in 2009–10, and is the second most profitable after the German Bundesliga. In 2010 the Premier League was awarded the Queen's Award for Enterprise in the International Trade category by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. The Premier League was recognised for its outstanding contribution to international trade and the value it brings to English football and the United Kingdom's broadcasting industry. The Premier League's gross revenue is regularly the fourth highest of any sports league worldwide, behind the annual revenues of the three most popular North American major sports leagues (the National Football League, Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association).\n\nIn terms of world football, the Premier League clubs are some of the richest in the world. Deloitte, who annually release figures on club revenues through its \" Football Money League\", listed seven Premier League clubs in the top 20 for the 2009–10 season. No other league has more than four clubs in this table. Premier League teams have dominated the list for many years, and even topped the list for almost a decade until the 2004–05 season. After the Premier League's new TV deal went into effect, the league-wide increase in revenues is expected to increase the Premier League clubs' standing in the list, and there is a possibility that a Premier League club will be top of the list.\n\nOn 18 December 2012, the Premier League clubs agreed in principle to radical new cost controls. The two proposals consist of a break-even rule and a cap on the amount clubs can increase their wage bill by each season. With the new television deals on the horizon, momentum has been growing to find ways of preventing the majority of the cash going straight to players and agents.\n\nCriticisms\n\n\"Big Four\" dominance (2003–04 to 2008–09)\n\nSeason A C L MU 1992–93 10 11 6 1 1993–94 4 14 8 1 1994–95 12 11 4 2 1995–96 5 11 3 1 1996–97 3 6 4 1 1997–98 1 4 3 2 1998–99 2 3 7 1 1999–2000 2 5 4 1 2000–01 2 6 3 1 2001–02 1 6 2 3 2002–03 2 4 5 1 2003–04 1 2 4 3 2004–05 2 1 5 3 2005–06 4 1 3 2 2006–07 4 2 3 1 2007–08 3 2 4 1 2008–09 4 3 2 1 2009–10 3 1 7 2 2010–11 4 2 6 1 2011–12 3 6 8 2 2012–13 7 1 Top four\n\nfinishes 17 12 12 21 out of 21 Key: Champions 2nd, 3rd or 4th place 5th or below\n\nA major criticism of the Premier League in the mid-2000s was the emergence of the so-called \"Big Four\" clubs: Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United. With the exception of Blackburn Rovers in 1994–95 and Manchester City in 2011–12, only three clubs have won the Premier League title – Manchester United (13 titles), Arsenal and Chelsea (three titles each). In addition, Manchester United have not finished outside the top three since the formation of the Premier League.\n\nSince the summer of 2002, top four places have ensured qualification for the UEFA Champions League. In the summer of 2003, Chelsea was bought by billionaire Roman Abramovich. This started the concept of a \"Big Four\". They dominated the top four spots, thus places in the UEFA Champions League, winning all but one of the top four places between 2003–04 and 2008–09. The only exception was Liverpool's 5th place behind Everton in 2004–05, though they still got into the Champions League for 2005–06 by winning it in 2004–05 (while Everton, unlike any of the Big 4 in this period, failed to make the lucrative group stage of the Champions League, after being knocked out in the final qualifying round). The Big 4 went on to fill all 24 spots available to them in the lucrative group stage of the ensuing 2004–05 to 2009–10 Champions League seasons (which no English team outside the Big 4 reached in those seasons), and then went on to fill 22 of the 24 Champions League Last 16 (Knockout Stage) spots available to them in those seasons (the exceptions being Manchester United in 2005–06 and Liverpool in 2009–10).\n\nQualification was one club for the first four seasons, increased to two clubs in 1997, three in 1999 and four since 2002. The benefits of qualification, especially increased revenue, are believed to have widened the gap between the \"Big Four\" clubs and the rest of the Premier League. Arsenal are second with 17 top four finishes, followed by Liverpool with 12 and Chelsea with 11.\n\nNewcastle United is the only team often appearing in the top four but not part of this \"Big Four\". In May 2008, their manager at the time Kevin Keegan said the \"Big Four\" dominance threatened the division, \"This league is in danger of becoming one of the most boring but great leagues in the world.\" Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore in defence \"There are a lot of different tussles that go on in the Premier League depending on whether you're at the top, in the middle or at the bottom that make it interesting.\"\n\nThe dominance of Chelsea and Manchester United has led some to believe that the \"Big Four\" has contracted to a \"Big Two\"; prior to 2012, no club other than these two had won the Premier League since 2005 and, as of May 2012, 21 of the last 28 major domestic trophies have gone to either Stamford Bridge or Old Trafford.\n\nThe years following 2009 marked a shift in the structure of the \"Big Four\" with two new clubs, Tottenham Hotspur and billionaire-funded Manchester City vying for place in top four. In the 2009–10 season, Tottenham pipped Manchester City to finish fourth and become the first team to break the top four since Everton in 2005, with both Manchester City and Aston Villa also finishing above Liverpool, formerly a \"Big Four\" team. In 2010–11, Manchester City finished third – the first time a team has broken into the top three since Newcastle did so in the 2002–03 season. This has continued into the 2011–12 season, with Manchester City winning the title for the first time since 1968, first since 1994–95, Tottenham again finishing 4th. Chelsea finished 6th, outside the top four for the first time since 2001–02 (though they retained their place in the Champions League at the expense of 4th-placed Tottenham Hotspur having won the trophy the previous season), while Liverpool finished 8th, outside the top four for the third season in a row.\n\nCriticism of the gap between an elite group of \"super clubs\" and the majority of the Premier League has continued, nevertheless, due to their increasing ability to spend more than the other Premier League clubs. Manchester City and Tottenham's ascendancy has meant some reference is now being made to a \"Big Six\".\n\nWidening gap with lower leagues\n\nOne of the main criticisms levelled at the Premier League is the increasing gulf between the Premier League and the Football League. Since its split with the Football League, many established clubs in the Premier League have managed to distance themselves from their counterparts in lower leagues. Owing in large part to the disparity in revenue from television rights between the leagues, many newly promoted teams have found it difficult to avoid relegation in their first season in the Premier League. In every season except 2001–02 ( Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers and Fulham) and 2011–12 ( Queens Park Rangers, Swansea City and Norwich City), at least one Premier League newcomer has been relegated back to the Football League. In 1997–98 all three promoted clubs were relegated at the end of the season.\n\nThe Premier League distributes a small portion of its television revenue to clubs that are relegated from the league in the form of \"parachute payments\". Starting with the 2006–07 season, these payments are in the amount of £6.5 million over the club's first two seasons in lower leagues, although this rose to £11.2 million per year for clubs relegated in 2007–2008. Designed to help teams adjust to the loss of television revenues (the average Premier League team receives £45 million while the average Football League Championship club receives £1 million), critics maintain that the payments actually widen the gap between teams that have reached the Premier League and those that have not, leading to the common occurrence of teams \" bouncing back\" soon after their relegation. For some clubs, including Blackpool, Burnley, Leeds United, Charlton Athletic, Coventry City, Derby County, Nottingham Forest, Oldham Athletic, Sheffield Wednesday, Bradford City, Leicester City, Queens Park Rangers, Southampton, Wimbledon, and Portsmouth who have failed to win immediate promotion back to the Premier League, financial problems, including in some cases administration or even liquidation have followed. Further relegations down the footballing ladder have ensued for several clubs unable to cope with the gap.\n\nClubs\n\nA total of 45 clubs have played in the Premier League from its inception in 1992, up to and including the 2012–13 season. Seven clubs have been members of the Premier League for every season since its inception: Arsenal, Aston Villa, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United, and Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nThe following 20 clubs are competing in the Premier League during the 2012–13 season.\n\nClub Position\n\nin 2011–12 First season in\n\ntop division Number of seasons\n\nin top division Number of seasons\n\nin the Premier League First season of\n\ncurrent spell in\n\ntop division Top division\n\ntitles Last top division title Arsenala, b 0033rd 1903–04 96 21 1919–20 13 2003–04 Aston Villaa, b, c 01616th 1888–89 102 21 1988–89 7 1980–81 Chelseaa, b 0066th 1907–08 78 21 1989–90 4 2009–10 Evertona, b, c 0077th 1888–89 110 21 1954–55 9 1986–87 Fulhamb 0099th 1949–50 24 12 2001–02 0 n/a Liverpoola, b 0088th 1894–95 98 21 1962–63 18 1989–90 Manchester Citya 0011st 1899–1900 84 16 2002–03 3 2011–12 Manchester Uniteda, b 0022nd 1892–93 88 21 1975–76 20 2012–13 Newcastle United 0055th 1898–99 82 19 2010–11 4 1926–27 Norwich Citya 01212th 1972–73 23 6 2011–12 0 n/a Queens Park Rangersa 01717th 1968–69 22 6 2011–12 0 n/a Reading 0181st in the Championship 2006–07 3 3 2012–13 0 n/a Southamptona 0192nd in the Championship 1966–67 36 14 2012–13 0 n/a Stoke Cityb, c 01414th 1888–89 57 5 2008–09 0 n/a Sunderland 01313th 1890–91 82 12 2007–08 6 1935–36 Swansea Cityb 01111th 1981–82 4 2 2011–12 0 n/a Tottenham Hotspura, b 0044th 1909–10 78 21 1978–79 2 1960–61 West Bromwich Albionc 01010th 1888–89 76 7 2010–11 1 1919–20 West Ham United 0203rd in the Championship 1923–24 55 17 2012–13 0 n/a Wigan Athleticb 01515th 2005–06 8 8 2005–06 0 n/a\n\nBlackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers and Wolverhampton Wanderers were relegated to the Championship for the 2012–13 season, while Reading, Southampton and West Ham United, as winners, runners-up and play-off final winners respectively, were promoted from the 2011–12 Championship season.\n\na: Founding member of the Premier League\n\nb: Never been relegated from Premier League\n\nc: One of the original 12 Football League teams\n\nStadia\n\nPremier League football has been played in 50 stadia since the formation of the Premier League in 1992. The Hillsborough disaster in 1989 and the subsequent Taylor Report saw a recommendation that standing terraces should be abolished; as a result all stadia in the Premier League are all-seater. Since the formation of the Premier League, football grounds in England have seen constant improvements to capacity and facilities, with some clubs moving to new-build stadia. Nine stadia that have seen Premier League football have now been demolished. The stadia for the 2010–11 season show a large disparity in capacity: Old Trafford, the home of Manchester United has a capacity of 75,957 with Bloomfield Road, the home of Blackpool, having a capacity of 16,220. The combined total capacity of the Premier League in the 2010–11 season is 770,477 with an average capacity of 38,523.\n\nStadium attendances are a significant source of regular income for Premier League clubs. For the 2009–10 season, average attendances across the league clubs were 34,215 for Premier League matches with a total aggregate attendance figure of 13,001,616. This represents an increase of 13,089 from the average attendance of 21,126 recorded in the league's first season (1992–93). However, during the 1992–93 season the capacities of most stadia were reduced as clubs replaced terraces with seats in order to meet the Taylor Report's 1994–95 deadline for all-seater stadia. The Premier League's record average attendance of 36,144 was set during the 2007–08 season.\n\nManagers\n\nManagers in the Premier League are involved in the day to day running of the team, including the training, team selection, and player acquisition. Their influence varies from club-to-club and is related to the ownership of the club and the relationship of the manager with fans. Managers are required to have a UEFA Pro Licence which is the final coaching qualification available, and follows the completion of the UEFA 'B' and 'A' Licences. The UEFA Pro Licence is required by every person who wishes to manage a club in the Premier League on a permanent basis (i. e. more than 12 weeks – the amount of time an unqualified caretaker manager is allowed to take control). Caretaker appointments are managers that fill the gap between a managerial departure and a new appointment. Several caretaker managers have gone on to secure a permanent managerial post after performing well as a caretaker; examples include Paul Hart at Portsmouth and David Pleat at Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nThe league's longest-serving manager was Alex Ferguson, who was in charge of Manchester United from November 1986 until his retirement at the end of the 2012–13 season, meaning that he was manager for all of the first 21 seasons of the Premier League. Arsène Wenger has been in charge of Arsenal in the Premier League since 1996, while David Moyes has been Everton's manager since 2002.\n\nNo English manager has won the Premier League; the six managers to have won the title comprise two Scots Alex Ferguson (Manchester United, 13 wins) and Kenny Dalglish (Blackburn Rovers, one win), a Frenchman ( Arsène Wenger, Arsenal, three wins), a Portuguese ( José Mourinho, Chelsea, two wins) and two Italians ( Carlo Ancelotti, Chelsea, and Roberto Mancini, Manchester City, one win each).\n\nThe current managers in the Premier League are:\n\nName Club Appointed Scotland !

He also has 13 Premier League champion's medals, more than any other player.\n\nForeign players and transfer regulations\n\nRank Player Appearances 1 Ryan Giggs 611 2 David James 572 3 Frank Lampard 550 4 Gary Speed 535 5 Emile Heskey 510 6 Jamie Carragher 507 7 Sol Campbell 504 8 Phil Neville 504 9 Mark Schwarzer 500 10 Paul Scholes 497 Italics denotes players still playing professional football.\n\nBold denotes players still playing in the Premier League.\n\nAt the inception of the Premier League in 1992–93, just eleven players named in the starting line-ups for the first round of matches hailed from outside of the United Kingdom or Republic of Ireland. By 2000–01, the number of foreign players participating in the Premier League was 36 per cent of the total. In the 2004–05 season the figure had increased to 45 per cent. On 26 December 1999, Chelsea became the first Premier League side to field an entirely foreign starting line-up, and on 14 February 2005 Arsenal were the first to name a completely foreign 16-man squad for a match. By 2009 the average Premier League team had an average of 13 foreign players in their side with under 40% of the players in the Premier League being English. The effect of foreign players on the England national football team has been the subject of a long-standing debate with some such as José Luis Astiazarán, president of Spain's La Liga, suggesting that the high number of young foreign players is the reason behind the national side's lack of success at international football tournaments. Vicente del Bosque, the manager of the Spanish national team, disagrees stating that he \"didn't think it's damaging for English football to have people from abroad.\"\n\nIn response to concerns that clubs were increasingly passing over young British players in favour of signing less-expensive foreign players, in 1999, the Home Office tightened its rules for granting work permits to players from countries outside of the European Union. Currently a non-EU player applying for the permit must have played for his country in at least 75 per cent of its competitive 'A' team matches for which he was available for selection during the previous two years, and his country must have averaged at least 70th place in the official FIFA world rankings over the previous two years. If a player does not meet those criteria, the club wishing to sign him may appeal if they believe that he is a special talent and \"able to contribute significantly to the development of the game at the top level in the UK.\" One area where the Premier League's player registration rules are more restrictive than those of some other football leagues, such as those of Belgium and Portugal, is that academy level non-EU players have little access to English football by law.\n\nPlayers can only be transferred during transfer windows that are set by the Football Association. The two current transfer windows run from the last day of the season to 31 August and from 31 December to 31 January. Player registrations cannot be exchanged outside these windows except under specific licence from the FA, usually on an emergency basis. As of the 2010–11 season, the Premier League introduced new rules mandating that each club must register a maximum 25-man squad of players aged over 21, with the squad list only allowed to be changed in transfer windows or in exceptional circumstances. This was to enable the 'home grown' rule to be enacted, whereby the League would also from 2010 require at least 8 of the named 25 man squad to be made up of 'home-grown players', defined as a player who:\n\nirrespective of his nationality or age, has been registered with any club affiliated to The Football Association or the Welsh Football Association for a period, continuous or not, of three entire seasons or 36 months prior to his 21st birthday (or the end of the season during which he turns 21)\n\nWages and transfer records\n\nThere is no team or individual salary cap in the Premier League. As a result of the increasingly lucrative television deals, player wages rose sharply following the formation of the Premier League. In the first Premier League season the average player wage was £75,000 per year, but subsequently rose by an average 20 per cent per year for a decade, £409,000 in 2000–01, £676,000 in 2003–04 season rising to £1.1 million for the 2008–09 season.\n\nThe record transfer fee for a Premier League has been broken several times over the lifetime of the competition. Prior to the start of the first Premier League season Alan Shearer became the first British player to command a transfer fee of more than £3 million. The record rose steadily in the Premier League's first few seasons, until Alan Shearer made a world record breaking £15 million move to Newcastle United in 1996. This stood as a British record for four years until it was eclipsed by the £18 million Leeds paid West Ham for Rio Ferdinand. Manchester United subsequently broke the record three times by signing Ruud van Nistelrooy, Juan Sebastián Verón and Rio Ferdinand. Chelsea broke the record in May 2006, when they signed Andriy Shevchenko, from Milan. The exact figure of the transfer fee was not disclosed, but was reported as being around £30 million. This was surpassed by Manchester City's transfer of Robinho from Real Madrid on 1 September 2008 for £32.5 million. This fee was then surpassed twice on deadline day of the January 2011 window, first by Andy Carroll's £35 million move from Newcastle United to Liverpool. This was then beaten when Fernando Torres moved from Liverpool to Chelsea for £50 million. The Torres deal remains the British transfer record paid for a player. The record transfer in the sport's history had a Premier League club on the selling end, with Manchester United accepting an £80 million bid from Real Madrid for Cristiano Ronaldo in 2009.\n\nTop scorers\n\nRank Nat Name Years Goals Apps Ratio 1 Alan Shearer 1992–2006 260 441 0.59 2 Andrew Cole 1992–2008 188 414 0.45 3 Thierry Henry 1999–2007 175 254 0.69 4 Frank Lampard 1995– 166 550 0.30 5 Robbie Fowler 1993–2009 162 378 0.43 6 Wayne Rooney 2002– 156 345 0.45 7 Michael Owen 1996– 150 325 0.46 8 Les Ferdinand 1992–2005 149 351 0.42 9 Teddy Sheringham 1992–2007 147 418 0.35 10 Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink 1997–2007 127 288 0.44\n\nItalics denotes players still playing professional football,\n\nBold denotes players still playing in the Premier League).\n\nPlayers in the Premier League compete for the Premier League Golden Boot, awarded to the top scorer at the end of each season, as well as for Golden Boot awards for the first person to score 10, 20 or 30 goals in a season. They can also compete for the informal competitions of Goal of the Month and Goal of the Season. Former Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United striker Alan Shearer holds the record for most Premier League goals with 260. Shearer finished among the top ten goal scorers in 10 out of his 14 seasons in the Premier League and won the top scorer title three times. During the 1995–96 season he became the first player to score 100 Premier League goals. Since then, 21 other players have reached the 100-goal mark.\n\nSince the first Premier League season in 1992–93, 14 different players from 10 different clubs have won or shared the top scorers title. Thierry Henry won his third consecutive and fourth overall scoring title by scoring 27 goals in the 2005–06 season. This surpassed Shearer's mark of three titles which he won consecutively from 1994–95 through 1996–97. Other multiple winners include Michael Owen, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Didier Drogba who have won two titles each. Andrew Cole and Alan Shearer hold the record for most goals in a season (34) – for Newcastle and Blackburn respectively. Cole's record came in the 1993–94 season, while Shearer's came in 1994–95, both of which were 42-game seasons. Shearer's mark of 31 goals from a 38-game season in 1995–96 was equalled in the 2007–08 season by Cristiano Ronaldo. Five goals is the record individual scoring total for a player in a single Premier League game held by four players; Andy Cole, Alan Shearer, Jermain Defoe and Dimitar Berbatov. Only Ryan Giggs of Manchester United has scored in all 21 seasons.\n\nManchester United became the first team to have scored 1,000 goals in the league after Cristiano Ronaldo scored in a 4–1 defeat by Middlesbrough in the 2005–06 season. Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur, Newcastle United and Everton are the only other teams to have reached the 1,000-goal mark, with Everton being the latest team to do so following Steven Pienaars goal against Tottenham on 6 December 2012.\n\nThe highest-scoring match to date in the Premier League occurred on 29 September 2007 when Portsmouth beat Reading 7–4.\n\nAwards\n\nTrophy\n\nThe current Premier League trophy was created by Royal Jewellers Asprey of London. It consists of a trophy with a golden crown and a malachite plinth base. The plinth weighs 33 lbs (15 kg) and the trophy weighs 22 lbs (10 kg). The trophy and plinth are 76 cm (30 in) tall, 43 cm (17 in) wide and 25 cm (9.8 in) deep.\n\nIts main body is solid sterling silver and silver gilt, while its plinth is made of malachite, a semi-precious stone. The plinth has a silver band around its circumference, upon which the names of the title-winning clubs are listed. Malachite's green colour is also representative of the green field of play. The design of the trophy is based on the heraldry of Three Lions that is associated with English football.
