        "text": "Probably fair to say that most Liverpool fans won’t mind seeing the back of what has been quite a turbulent season, and the light at the end of the tunnel is brought into focus with the reveal of the club’s new home shirt for the 23/24 campaign from Nike. Following on from the all-red home design from this season, next season will see the reintroduction of white trim, which appears on the rounded collar and cuffs.\n\nThat crew neck collar is a look that was prominent for the club back in the 60s and 70s, and it made an appearance again in 1998-00, but since then it hasn’t been used. Here, the design pays homage to the legendary Bill Shankly’s last season in charge of the Reds, 50 years ago. The 1973-74 season was Shankly’s 14th and final season as Reds boss, and he steered the team to FA Cup glory. A team which featured Ian Callaghan, Kevin Keegan, Ray Clemence, Roy Evans, Phil Thompson and John Toshack.\n\nThe current squad will debut this kit at the final home game of the season against Aston Villa, Anfield’s final game in front of 54,000 before 7,000 more seats are added once the Anfield Road expansion is complete.\n\nThe white collar and cuffs are joined by the club crest, branding and sponsor in white to complete what is a simple enough design, but one that is unmistakably Liverpool Football Club. The club’s name and number style for the back of shirt, takes inspiration from the city, with a contemporary take on Liverpool’s historic street signs.\n\nJordan Henderson said: “The new home shirt is a classic. Given the inspiration behind the design, it feels iconic and a nod to the history of this great club. We’re looking forward to wearing it at Anfield for the Aston Villa game.”\n\nWomen’s vice-captain Taylor Hinds added: “We’re always proud to wear the LFC jersey. It’s always exciting to see the new design and when it has a link to the history of this club it makes it even more special. We’re excited to wear next season.”"
