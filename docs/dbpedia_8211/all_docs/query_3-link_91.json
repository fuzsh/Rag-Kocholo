        "text": "Liverpool Football Club is a professional association football club in Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) competitions. Since 1964, they have won fourteen European and Worldwide trophies, more than any other British club. These consist of the UEFA Champions League (formerly known as the European Cup) six times, the UEFA Europa League (formerly the UEFA Cup) three times, the UEFA Super Cup four times and the FIFA Club World Cup once.\n\nQualification for European competitions is determined by a team's success in its domestic league and cup competitions from the previous season. Liverpool competed in European competitions for 21 consecutive seasons until the 1985 European Cup final, the occasion of the Heysel Stadium disaster, following which the club was banned from European competitions for six seasons. Since being readmitted in 1991, they have qualified for the UEFA Champions League (the successor to the European Cup) fifteen times, the UEFA Europa League (the successor to the UEFA Cup) twelve times, and the (now-defunct) UEFA Cup Winners' Cup twice.\n\nAs a result of their victory in the 2005 Champions League final, Liverpool won the European Champion Clubs' Cup trophy outright and were awarded a multiple winner badge. Only two teams have won more Champions League titles than Liverpool: Real Madrid and AC Milan with fifteen and seven, respectively. Liverpool's total of three UEFA Cup wins has been bettered only by Sevilla, who have won the competition seven times. They have also won the UEFA Super Cup on four occasions; only Barcelona, Milan and Real Madrid (five each) have won the competition more. Liverpool won the FIFA Club World Cup for the first time in 2019."
