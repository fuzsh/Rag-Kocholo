        "text": "United Manager Chris Hughton said:\n\n\"That is a wonderful achievement. We are realistic. We wont get too many days like that. To score six against the likes of Aston Villa, it doesnt come round too often. We have to get feet on the ground. It will be tough away from home next in the league. But we will spend the rest of today enjoying it.\n\n\"I watched Aston Villa last weekend and thought they were emphatic in everything they did - and we expected a tough game. But once we got the first goal it lifted any fears we might have had and after half-time we managed to keep it going.\n\n\"There was an intensity to our play but you have got to have goalscoring opportunities. We were able to go right through to the end and as it got more open it suited us more.\n\n\"Unfortunately despite scoring twice, Kevin Nolan is in the background. We kept a clean sheet which is just as important as scoring goals. It was part of a really good team performance, there wasn't a player out there who didn't play well.\n\nHe (Andy Carroll) is still developing but what he has is great desire and aptitude to improve. He's a bit of a throwback, a local lad and he took his goals very, very well. He's developed his game, added goals to his game. Whether it is too early for England is for the England staff.\"\n\nThe hat-trick hero commented:\n\n\"I just concentrate on myself. I know I can play football and score goals like I did, and that's what I go out there to do. Obviously, it's great for people to see what I can do and stuff, but I'm just happy with three points and all the lads playing like they did.\n\n\"It was a great game and a great performance by all the lads, and getting a hat-trick in the first game of the season at home was fantastic. There were no headers in it - they were all left-footed - but really it was all about the quality of the balls that went into the box for me to score the goals.\n\n\"Last season, we didn't lose here and before the game that's what we were all talking about. We just went out like we did last season and proved a point to anybody who was doubting us. We've got to keep working hard week in, week out. I thought we were pretty unlucky against Man United, and now we're showing what we can do.\"\n\nFormer number 9 & ex-manager Alan Shearer added:\n\n\"I was delighted that Andy had, if you like, the guts the take the No 9 shirt because we know that players over the years have shied away from it. It is a big responsibility because it is a huge shirt, plus there have been some big, big names that have worn the shirt and some great players at that. I am not talking about myself there. I am talking about the Milburns, the Macdonalds and the Ferdinands and other players like that.\n\n\"There were one or two positives to be taken from the Manchester United game. No one expected us to get anything but I thought that Andy Carroll played the lone strikers role very well against Manchester United. It is hard enough playing up front on your own up front anyway when playing in that role when you are a youngster and playing at Old Trafford is very, very difficult. Chris might have looked at that and thought if we can play the same way and get up and support him on occasions that might be successful.\n\n\"It is a completely different animal to last year. Chris (Hughton) knows that you are playing better opposition this year, more quality players and forwards and teams that if you attack them can punish you. He knows as well as everyone else does  and I dont want to disappoint too many Newcastle fans  but Newcastle have to stay in this division. That is the priority this year because it looks as though there will be no money to be spent.\n\n\"You will have to look at the opposition more this year than ever. The Premier League is full of quality. You are probably in most danger when you attack times because of the counter-attacking of many teams can damage you. The priority has to be to keep this club in the Premier League and then you can build from there.\n\n\"It looks as though there will be no money spent of made available to the manager so he has to do with what he has. He did a very good job last year and deserves a crack at it again this season.\"\n\nThey Said\n\nVilla's caretaker boss Kevin MacDonald commented:\n\n\"It was a very disappointing result. We started well and got the penalty but then Carew missed and it changed the momentum. We then got hammered. Even if we had scored it doesn't mean we would have held on and won the game but full credit to Newcastle. They took chances and played well, especially in the second half, but when you're 3-0 up it helps.\n\n\"It was probably not as high tempo as wed have liked. Maybe that was partly because I was a bit naive in my selection for the game. I might have taken out one or two of the young lads who sort of played three games in a week. Maybe it was too much for them. Ill accept responsibility because it was me that chose the team. The players went out there, they dont mean to play disappointingly, so Ill accept that."
