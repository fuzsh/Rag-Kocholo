        "text": "It's a big day and so many things can happen that it's almost impossible to predict, so I wont. I'll just share the necessary information, copy and paste from the BBC and let everything unfold as it is meant to unfold.\n\nI can't just leave it at that. It's such an important game because winning it keeps us in the race to finish above Spurs and Brighton and finishing above one of those two will mean we are playing European football next season.\n\nBut it's very important to write also that while it would be nice to be playing in Europe next season, all of us would have been happy to finish top half this season had you asked us at the start of this season.\n\nSo, winning keeps us in the race but Brighton and Spurs could also lose. And it wont be easy because Liverpool are also playing for top four. I'm nervous. I'm going to bed.\n\nMatch facts from the BBC\n\nHead-to-head\n\nLiverpool have won nine of the past 10 league meetings, with the exception being a 7-2 loss at Villa Park in October 2020.\n\nAston Villa have lost on four successive Premier League visits to Anfield since a 1-0 win in September 2014.\n\nLiverpool\n\nLiverpool's current run of seven straight Premier League victories is their longest since a 10-match streak between January and April last year.\n\nTheir only defeat in the past 41 home league fixtures was by 2-1 against Leeds last October (W31, D9).\n\nThe Reds have won their final home game in each of the past six seasons.\n\nThey have won 14 of their 15 most recent league matches played in May, only dropping points in a 1-1 home draw versus Spurs last year.\n\nLiverpool need two goals to reach 100 in all competitions for the fifth time in six seasons.\n\nThe Merseysiders have conceded 42 Premier League goals this season, equalling their worst defensive record in a full campaign under Jurgen Klopp.\n\nMohamed Salah has scored in nine consecutive home games in all competitions, a record for a Liverpool player.\n\nAston Villa"
