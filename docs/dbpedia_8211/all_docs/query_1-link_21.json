        "text": "So according to a few disciples, I have an agenda. I don`t, I have a consistent position, one I’ve held from the start and one that I am very sad hasn’t been proved totally wrong. Paul Lambert is out of his depth and despite the very poor guardianship from Randy Lerner, we should not be three seasons in and still this bad.\n\nYou only have to read facebook, GO TO GAMES (many who lecture don`t, some do I realise) and listen to other fans, read the site comments here, there and everywhere to see the tide has very much turned. Not an agenda, just a position based on a woeful record.\n\nMaybe these sites also have an agenda… Lets see:\n\nwww.fourfourtwo.com have labelled us the most boring Premier League team in history. They say they have the stats to back it up. Not totally sure by this because as pointed out in our forum\n\nIn the 23 years of the Premier League only the Derby team of 2007/8 had scored fewer goals after 21 league games than our 11. They had 10 goals at the same stage even though they were without doubt the worst team in Premier League history.\n\nSo Derby County were worse… look what happened to them!\n\nAnyway, in their article they go into the sad facts most of us know.\n\ncontributing to a dismal season average of just 1.65 per game. So FFT decided it was time to find out where Paul Lambert`s team stand in the pantheon of top-flight dullness.\n\nAnd the results are in: as things stand, this Aston Villa side of 2014/15 are indeed, statistically speaking, the dullest side in Premier League history – the West Midlands side’s games currently bemoan the lowest goals-per-game average since the Premier League`s inception in 1992.\n\nThey also add\n\nIt gets even worse for suffering Villa fans when you consider their miserly goal haul of just 11 this season. To put that total in context, West Ham have scored three more from headers (14) than Lambert’s men have altogether.\n\nOnly two teams have scored fewer goals after 20 games of a Premier League season (Manchester City and Derby, both 10, in 1995/96 and 2007/08 respectively) –\n\nAnd an acidic last line, although I would imagine our league position might not read so well after our upcoming fixtures as we have:\n\nLiverpool (home), Arsenal (away), Chelsea (home), Stoke (home) and Newcastle (away). Based on our problems beating the crud of the league…….. need I go on?\n\n442`s acidic line: Nevertheless, Lambert`s team currently sit 12th, five points clear of the relegation zone. So remember, folks: being boring pays. Apparently.\n\nI`d take boring our way to safety this season if it results in a) a takeover b) a Lambert exit…. the alternative at the moment looks like dropping a division to me.\n\nAnd onto CNN, again, not a news agency with any agenda or axe to grind one would think, so the apologists can forget that…!\n\nCNN warn viewers to steer clear of Aston Villa.\n\nNo understanding or time or patience for our history, heritage of massive potential, just a look at the here and now. Can you blame neutrals not tuning in to what a lot of the Villa faithful are now tuning out of ?\n\nIn the English Premier League, often described as the most entertaining in the world, the Birmingham-based team are a mundane anomaly. With over half of the current season gone, Villa are the Premier League’s lowest scorers with 11 goals in 20 games. That miserly total is the lowest of all the 92 clubs in England’s four-tier football pyramid, with only Germany’s Hamburg dipping below Villa’s scoring ratio of one goal every 1.8 games.\n\nThey go on with stats before concluding So if European football is the land of goalscoring gunslingers, Villa are very much the stumbling drunk crouching behind the saloon door.\n\nForum thread on these articles: Click Here\n\nAnd the saddest thing?\n\nOur CEO Tom Fox doesn`t have the clout, or maybe even the understanding to remove the manager. The owner? He doesn`t have the desire, interest or indeed the drive to rid us of this manager. The manager? He doesn`t have the dignity to recognise what a dire job he`s doing and resign.\n\nBest thing the fans can do is pray for safety for the 5th season in a row and pray even harder for a takeover come the summer. If not…………………….."
