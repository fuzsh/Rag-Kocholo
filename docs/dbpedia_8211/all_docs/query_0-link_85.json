I not sale what you to see on this site, I not owner thos things)\n\nIn a end season 1994-95 the design home shirt has changed. Liverpool used home shirt two seasons, 1994-95 & 1995-96. In season 1994-95, this shirt was used how second home shirt. Liverpool used home shirt how in all home, as and in more away matches.\n\nH 1.0 - Home shirt (patches Premier League & big Carlsberg logo & player number № 1) with home shorts & home socks.\n\nH 1.1 - Home shirt (without patches & smaller Carlsberg logo & player number № 2) with home shorts & home socks.\n\nH 1.2 - Home shirt (without patches & big Carlsberg logo & player number № 3) with home shorts & home socks.\n\nH 1.4 - Home shirt (without patches & without special embroidery FA Youth Cup Final & smaller Carlsberg & player number № 3) with home shorts & home socks (only for FA Youth Cup).\n\n* 1.- * - Unknown me now which player kits used in this matches.\n\nThis was not first in history club, when in one of match end season, Liverpool used kits next season. This was how in Friendly, as in official matches. For example, in matches:\n\nEuropean Cup Final, vs Juventus (Turin, Italy), 29.05.1985.\n\nFull list to see here.\n\nLiverpool Youth teams used shirt without a sponsor Carlsberg logo (only not for FA Youth Cup matches). In UEFA Cup matches, Reserves and Youth teams not have family name players in back side shirt.

The special embroidery as was absent in matches FA Youth Cup Final 1963, 1972, 1996 & 2006. In first special embroidery on Liverpool Youth shirt was in FA Youth Cup Final match versus Manchester United (16.04.2007).\n\nAlthough it was known that the Adidas kit contract only had a year to go, a new kit was introduced at the beginning of the season. For many it merely represented another money-making opportunity, but the new kit did at least remove some of the more obvious signs of non-Liverpool corporate identity. The Adidas stripes were reduced to a trim instead of being an integral part of the kit design, and the Carlsberg green was removed from the home strip altogether.\n\nA stripe ran through the shirt once more but in almost the same colour as the rest of the shirt, keeping the shirt looking all red from a distance but showing this faint stripe close up, this is something Liverpool kits of the mid to late 80s also had.\n\nThe shirt sported a rather wide white V-neck collar in a heavy material different to the shirt, This collar had a red stripe running through it near the top of the collar, The Liver bird badge changed considerably, The standard shield being displayed in a much larger shield of a different shape altogether although the details within the badge remaining the same, the shankly gates are shown along with the Hillsborough flames, Thus the over all size of the team badge greatly increasing since the good old days of the 70s and 80s.\n\nAt the bottom of this shirt it sported a label on the outside of the shirt, this said \"Official Liverpool Product\", Why it was put there is not really know but added to the feeling that you were buying an official product and thus helping the club financially in your own very small way. In next season, when Liverpool shirt manufacturer Reebok, on shirt also will patch \"Official Liverpool Product\", only other design. On home and away goalkeeper shirt's this label is absent.\n\nThe shirt once again had a stripe running through it, again in a very subtle fashion as with almost all Liverpool kits.\n\nThis last season deal with Adidas, with next season 1996-97, Liverpool will played in kits Reebok. Liverpool played in kits Adidas with 1985 to 1996 & 2006 to 2012.\n\nH 1.0 19.08.1995 home Sheffield Wednesday Premier League 21.08.1995 away Leeds United Premier League 26.08.1995 away Tottenham Hotspur Premier League 30.08.1995 home Queens Park Rangers Premier League 09.09.1995 away Wimbledon Premier League 16.09.1995 home Blackburn Rovers Premier League 20.09.1995 home Sunderland League Cup 23.09.1995 home Bolton Wanderers Premier League 14.10.1995 home Coventry City Premier League 25.10.1995 home Manchester City League Cup 28.10.1995 home Manchester City Premier League 04.11.1995 away Newcastle United Premier League 18.11.1995 home Everton Premier League 29.11.1995 home Newcastle United League Cup 02.12.1995 home Southampton Premier League 09.12.1995 away Bolton Wanderers Premier League 17.12.1995 home Manchester United Premier League 23.12.1995 home Arsenal Premier League 30.12.1995 away Chelsea Premier League 01.01.1996 home Nottingham Forest Premier League 06.01.1996 home Rochdale FA Cup 13.01.1996 away Sheffield Wednesday Premier League 20.01.1996 home Leeds United Premier League 03.02.1996 home Tottenham Hotspur Premier League 11.02.1996 away Queens Park Rangers Premier League 18.02.1996 away Shrewsbury FA Cup 24.02.1996 away Blackburn Rovers Premier League 28.02.1996 home Charlton Athletic FA Cup 03.03.1996 home Aston Villa Premier League 10.03.1996 away Leeds United FA Cup 13.03.1996 home Wimbledon Premier League 16.03.1996 home Chelsea Premier League 20.03.1996 home Leeds United FA Cup 03.04.1996 home Newcastle United Premier League 06.04.1996 away Coventry City Premier League 08.04.1996 home West Ham United Premier League 16.04.1996 away Everton Premier League 27.04.1996 home Middlesbrough Premier League 05.05.1996 away Manchester City Premier League H 1.1 26.09.1995 home Spartak Vladikavkaz UEFA Cup 17.10.1995 away Brondby UEFA Cup 31.10.1995 home Brondby UEFA Cup H 1.2 26.07.1995 away Birmingham City Friendly 29.07.1995 neutral Ajax Amsterdam Friendly 30.07.1995 neutral AC Fiorentina Friendly 10.08.1995 away Celtic Friendly 14.08.1995 away Linfield Belfast Friendly * 1.- * 02.08.1995 away Norway XI Friendly 07.08.1995 away Yeovil Town XI Testimonial 12.08.1995 away Shelbourne Friendly\n\n1st row (left to right): 1st image, embroidered club emblem. 2nd image, family name player and player number № 1 use on Liverpool shirt for matches Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup. 3nd image, without family name player and player number № 2 use on Liverpool shirt for matches UEFA Cup. 4th image, family name player and player number № 3 use on Liverpool shirt for matches Friendly main team, Reserves & Youth (only FA Youth Cup) teams (only player number in Youth team some it is more close to a collar). 5th image, without family name player and player number № 4 use on Liverpool shirt for matches Friendly main team (may be), Reserves & Youth teams. 6th image, without family name player and player number use on Liverpool shirt for matches Friendly.

For many it merely represented another money-making opportunity, but the new kit did at least remove some of the more obvious signs of non-Liverpool corporate identity. The Adidas stripes were reduced to a trim instead of being an integral part of the kit design, Although the Carlsberg green was not removed from the away strip as it had been from the home kit.\n\nThe away kit remained essentially green, although it was a dark, almost glossy black, green. The quartered shirt echoed Liverpool's very first kit from 1892. Presumably, a return to blue was deemed too radical to incorporate into a Liverpool strip, The Adidas logo and Liverbird badge were the same as on the home shirt all be it in different colours.\n\nAt the bottom of this shirt it sported a label on the outside of the shirt, this said \"Official Liverpool Product\", Why it was put there is not really know but added to the feeling that you were buying an official product and thus helping the club financially in your own very small way.

Liverpool played in kits Adidas with 1985 to 1996 & 2006 to 2012.\n\nDue to UEFA restrictive rules on size of kit sponsorship logo in European competitions, the Carlsberg sponsor rectangular box on the UEFA Cup player shirt (top) is much smaller than the Carlsberg sponsor on player shirts for domestic matches (middle).

Football strips had become fashion items and the move was undoubtedly a way of raising revenue. The new gold and black third kit was only worn by the team a handful of times during the two seasons it was in use, It was a garish design to say the least, reminiscent of some of the more daring shirt designs seen in the late 80s and early 90s.\n\nWhat you know, third kits not was in sale in club shop in season 1993-94, and can to buy third kits only with summer 1994.\n\nThe shirt was a gold/yellow colour, often referred to as either gold, yellow, orange, mustard!!, The collar changed to a new design not seen before, although the shirt was a button up collar once buttoned the shirt was very reminiscent of the previous kits V-neck collar, The shirt also sported to gold stripes through the black collar as well as 3 black stripes (Adidas corporate design again) upon the sleeves, The shirt also displayed the letters LFC upon the left handside of the collar.\n\nThe shirt also had the same corporate 3 white stripes as well as the Liver bird badge running through the whole shirt at an angle of 45 degrees in a lighter almost faded black colour, Both badges on the shirt, the Liverbird badge and the Adidas logo were stitched onto the shirt as opposed to the normal embossed material for the majority of Liverpool replica shirts.\n\nSince a season 1993-94 players of the teams which are taking part in Premier League, began to have constant numbers and as there were surnames of players on shirts (below right). Before, surnames of players of Liverpool on shirts were only in one match of the World Club Championship against Flamengo (Brazil), 3/13/1981 (below left).\n\nAttention! It is very difficult to distinguish the third player shirt from a replica shirt, the basic differences which were used in a home and away player shirts from replica shirts, here do not operate. So will read through caution below.\n\nNow can write, what third shirt with: 1- the registered mark \"circle-R\" on Adidas write, 2 - club crest has pure white flame from a white torches, 3 - fabric is incorporated with \"LIVERPOOL\" word watermarks. This third shirt with different, players shirt and hot have replicf shirt, if only they not fake.\n\nThe third difference is NOT noted by most collectors. Left image, in standard player shirt's club crest has pure white flame from a white torches, use on third shirt in season 1993-94. Right image, in standard player shirt's club crest has pure white flame from a black torches, use on third shirt in seasons 1994-95 & 1995-96.\n\nThe fourth difference is NOT noted by most collectors.\n\nTop image, in standard player shirt's fabric is incorporated with \"LIVERPOOL\" word watermarks; Note also that the midpoint of the Liverpool crest aligns with the Trifolium of the Carlsberg logo beneath it and have the registered mark \"circle-R\" on Adidas write, use on third shirt in season 1993-94.\n\nBottom image, in standard player shirt's fabric has no such watermarks. Note also that the midpoint of the Liverpool crest aligns with the letter \"g\" of the Carlsberg logo beneath it and without the registered mark \"circle-R\" on Adidas write, use on third shirt in seasons 1994-95 & 1995-96.\n\nUltra small Carlsberg sponsor as compared with standard player shirt.\n\n1994-96 Third Long Sleeved Player Shirt with SMALL Carlsberg. This shirt was supposed to be produced in Big Carlsberg only, regardless replicas or player shirts. This SMALL Carlsberg version was supposed to be tailor-produced for the 1995-96 UEFA Cup campaign, which placed restriction on the size of commercial sponsor logo on chest. Liverpool played Alania Vladikavkaz and Brondby respectively in first and second rounds. An early knock-out in the competition left no chance of using this third player shirt with SMALL Carlsberg. Museum style photo follows tonight as always.Many thanks Michael Yip for given to me images and text.\n\nHow to distinguish a third shirt of a season 1983-94 from a third shirt of a seasons 1994-95, & 1995-96 very difficultly, read text top.\n\nT 1.0 01.05.1996 away Arsenal Premier League T 1.1 04.10.1995 away Sunderland League Cup 22.10.1995 away Southampton Premier League\n\n1st row (left to right): 1st image, embroidered club emblem. 2nd image, family name player and player number (Adidas logo) № 1 use on Liverpool shirt for matches Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup in season 1993-94. 3rd image, family name player and player number (inscription Adidas) № 2 use on Liverpool shirt for matches Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup in season 1994-96. 4th image, without family name player and player number № 3 use on Liverpool shirt for matches Friendly main team, Reserves team. 5th image, without family name player and player number № 4 use on Liverpool shirt for matches Friendly main team, Reserves & Youth teams.\n\n2nd row image, patch Premier League use on sleeves Liverpool shirt for matches Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup (patches used on two sleeves).\n\nDifference between a player shirt and a replica shirt, and as other features of a player shirt to look here\n\nThird replica shirt Third shorts Third socks Away shorts With the description of the shirt, shorts, socks and features.

The special embroidery as was absent in matches FA Youth Cup Final 1963, 1972, 1996 & 2006. In first special embroidery on Liverpool Youth shirt was in FA Youth Cup Final match versus Manchester United (16.04.2007).\n\nAlthough it was known that the Adidas kit contract only had a year to go, a new kit was introduced at the beginning of the season. For many it merely represented another money-making opportunity, but the new kit did at least remove some of the more obvious signs of non-Liverpool corporate identity. The Adidas stripes were reduced to a trim instead of being an integral part of the kit design, and the Carlsberg green was removed from the home strip altogether.\n\nA stripe ran through the shirt once more but in almost the same colour as the rest of the shirt, keeping the shirt looking all red from a distance but showing this faint stripe close up, this is something Liverpool kits of the mid to late 80s also had.\n\nThe shirt sported a rather wide white V-neck collar in a heavy material different to the shirt, This collar had a red stripe running through it near the top of the collar, The Liver bird badge changed considerably, The standard shield being displayed in a much larger shield of a different shape altogether although the details within the badge remaining the same, the shankly gates are shown along with the Hillsborough flames, Thus the over all size of the team badge greatly increasing since the good old days of the 70s and 80s.\n\nAt the bottom of this shirt it sported a label on the outside of the shirt, this said \"Official Liverpool Product\", Why it was put there is not really know but added to the feeling that you were buying an official product and thus helping the club financially in your own very small way. In next season, when Liverpool shirt manufacturer Reebok, on shirt also will patch \"Official Liverpool Product\", only other design. On home and away goalkeeper shirt's this label is absent.\n\nThe shirt once again had a stripe running through it, again in a very subtle fashion as with almost all Liverpool kits.\n\nSponsor Carlsberg logo on goalkeepers shirt in season 1995-96, not only have different size, but and different color. Left image, black or white big Carlsberg logo, used on player shirt. Rigth image, black or white snall Carlsberg logo, used how on player shirt in UEFA Cup matches, as and replica goalkeeper shirt.

For goalkeepers shirt how I think was used some variant size Carlsberg logo (big small and smaller)!\n\nIn season 1995-96, for matches UEFA Cup was used home goalkeeper shirt with smallest Carlsberg logo.\n\nInteresting fact.
