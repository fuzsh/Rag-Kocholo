        "text": "WHEN highly paid footballers moan about their workload, most people roll their eyes, mutter about having a ‘real job’ then get on with their day.\n\nBut there is something about Michail Antonio’s concerning revelations about his mental health that strike a different chord.\n\nCharismatic, engaging, outwardly confident and built like a prize bull, surely nothing can touch such a successful athlete with a life most young men dream of?\n\nSo for West Ham’s 67-goal, all-time leading Premier League scorer, a veteran of more than 16 seasons in the game, to admit he has cracked, is a big deal.\n\nOne of the drivers behind the 34-year-old striker’s reluctant advance into therapy is the now relentless football calendar, coupled with the similarly incessant levels of scrutiny.\n\nTrying to put the ball in the net for a top-flight team is a minor part of the job.\n\nSimply wondering where your passport is, or feeling secure enough to turn on your phone without receiving 50 gigabytes of abuse, is taking over from the role you have been hired to do.\n\nAntonio revealed he is now divorced, and what’s behind it is his business.\n\nBut one of his old team-mates, Robert Snodgrass, once told me how he spent an entire season commuting from Essex to Aston Villa while on loan, forcing him to eat at motorway service stations en route.\n\nHis reward for trying to be a good husband and dad by being at home each night?\n\nTo be singled out for putting on weight by then Hammers manager Manuel Pellegrini.\n\nIt’s ironic that Jamaica international Antonio chose to air his deepest-held secrets on the High Performance podcast, because his struggle to cope with the “constant” of football has significantly harmed his game.\n\nYes, top footballers are paid vast amounts but are we getting to a situation where that is not really the point?\n\nThe latest cry for help from someone who should be enjoying every waking moment could not be better timed.\n\nJust 24 hours earlier, Fifa’s announcement that the spectre of the dreaded ‘39th game’ is being revived must send a shudder through every Premier League dressing room.\n\nTo read more from Andrew Dillon, click here.\n\nNottingham Forest\n\nDeducted four points during the 2023-24 season for breaching Premier League spending limit by £34.563m. Failed in their appeal with decision upheld.\n\nEverton\n\nInitial 10-point deduction for 2021-22 Premier League breaches reduced to six points on appeal. Were deducted a further two points later in the 2023-24 season. Appealed, but since withdrawn following Prem survival.\n\nSheffield United\n\nHit with a two-point deduction for their finances during the 2022-23 EFL season. Will begin the 2024-25 Championship season on -2 points following their relegation from the Prem.\n\nOTHERS WHO COULD FACE PUNISHMENT...\n\nManchester City\n\nEtihad club emphatically denies the 115 allegations laid against them in February 2023. The lengthy Commission case has been scheduled to start in October or November but a final decision is not expected until March or April 2025.\n\nChelsea\n\nBlues chiefs flagged up illicit payments made to agents and others during the Roman Abramovich era. Fined £8.6m by Uefa but still to be formally charged by the Prem despite an ongoing investigation.\n\nLeicester\n\nFoxes breached Prem PSR loss limits last season but did not have to report their 2022-23 accounts until this month because of their relegation. That puts the timetable back and means that they will probably face a Prem points deduction for the 2024-25 season following their return to the top flight.\n\nEverton (again)\n\nThe Toffees are again at risk of breaking PSR rules and are in a race against time to raise funds and balance the books. Not only could that lead to another charge but also administration. That would lead to an automatic nine-point deduction for the 2024/25 season."
