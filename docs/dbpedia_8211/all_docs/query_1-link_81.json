        "text": "From Sadio Mane’s magic at the Emirates last year, to Fernando Torres’ Sunderland stunner in 2008 and Stan Collymore’s dream debut in the mid-90s, the Reds have conjured up some moments to savour over the years.\n\nSo either sit back, relax and relive them in our free clip below, or scroll down for a recap of our 10 finest first-day successes...\n\n2016-17: Arsenal 3-4 Liverpool (August 14, 2016)\n\nJürgen Klopp’s first trip to Emirates Stadium as Liverpool manager turned out to be a Premier League classic on the opening day of the 2016-17 season. Simon Mignolet made an impressive penalty save from Theo Walcott in the first half, before the Arsenal forward opened the scoring from open play shortly after. Philippe Coutinho’s stunning free-kick brought the equaliser on the brink of half-time, before a frenetic second-half period saw the Reds surge into a commanding lead with goals from Adam Lallana, Coutinho again and Sadio Mane with an outstanding solo effort on his debut. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Calum Chambers pulled two back for the hosts, but Liverpool were able to hold on for a crucial three points in a frantic encounter in north London.\n\n2015-16: Stoke City 0-1 Liverpool (August 8, 2015)\n\nA notoriously difficult ground for visiting teams, Liverpool began the 2015-16 season with a trip to Stoke, featuring a new-look side including five debutants - with Joe Gomez, Nathaniel Clyne, James Milner, Roberto Firmino and Christian Benteke all making their first appearances for the club. After a tense and closely contested encounter, the score remained goalless heading into the final few minutes. It required a moment of individual inspiration to secure the victory, provided by Philippe Coutinho just four minutes from time. Picking up a pass from Gomez, the Brazilian spun his marker and rifled a 30-yard effort into the top corner in front of a jubilant travelling Kop to snatch a valuable away victory in style.\n\n2014-15: Liverpool 2-1 Southampton (August 17, 2014)\n\nOpening the season at Anfield against Southampton, Dejan Lovren made his debut against his former club after joining in the summer transfer window. Jordan Henderson’s defence-splitting pass set Raheem Sterling through on goal to open the scoring in the first half, before Nathaniel Clyne’s driven shot early in the second half brought the equaliser for the visitors. The Saints looked to be heading towards securing a valuable point away from home before Daniel Sturridge snatched the victory for Liverpool with a neat flick into the bottom corner after Sterling’s header into the six-yard box.\n\n2013-14: Liverpool 1-0 Stoke City (August 17, 2013)\n\nDaniel Sturridge’s driven shot from outside the box broke the deadlock in the first Premier League game of the 2013-14 season, giving Liverpool the lead in the 37th minute. Victory looked to be within touching distance until a Daniel Agger handball granted Stoke the opportunity to snatch an equaliser in the last minute of regular time. A heroic double save by Simon Mignolet from Jonathan Walters made it a most memorable of debuts for the Belgian, his decisive contribution ensuring the season began with three points and a clean sheet. It would ultimately set the tone for a remarkable campaign which unfolded thereafter.\n\n2008-09: Sunderland 0-1 Liverpool (August 16, 2008)\n\nLiverpool’s 2008-09 campaign was a memorable one and it began with a trip to the Stadium of Light, where the hosts proved stubborn opposition. A goalless draw appeared on the cards until late on, when patience ultimately paid dividends. Collecting Xabi Alonso’s first-time pass, Fernando Torres drove into space and fired an unstoppable 25-yard strike into the bottom corner to clinch the victory in the 83rd minute. Uncharacteristically quiet until that point, the Spaniard sprung into life at the vital moment to take all three points for Rafa Benitez’s side.\n\n2007-08: Aston Villa 1-2 Liverpool (August 11, 2007)\n\nA trip to Villa Park saw Liverpool take the lead after half an hour as Danish defender Martin Laursen knocked the ball into his own net after Dirk Kuyt’s pull-back, after Fernando Torres had been denied at point-blank range. The hosts drew level, however, with Gareth Barry successfully converting from the spot after Jamie Carragher’s handball had conceded an 86th-minute penalty. The three points appeared to have been snatched away with little time left to find a winner. However, just moments later, Steven Gerrard earned a free-kick 30 yards from goal, stepping up himself to dispatch a magnificent effort into the top corner before rushing to the away end in jubilation having rescued the win in dramatic style.\n\n2001-02: Liverpool 2-1 West Ham United (August 18, 2001)\n\nThe Hammers arrived at Anfield for Liverpool’s first game of the 2001-02 season, with Michael Owen making the breakthrough inside the opening 20 minutes with a cool finish after Gary McAllister’s clever flick created the opportunity. The lead didn’t last long, however, as Stephane Henchoz conceded a penalty with a foul on Svetoslav Todorov following a miscommunication with Jamie Carragher. Paolo Di Canio coolly chipped the ball down the middle, drawing the visitors level after half an hour. It took a moment of magic from Owen to create a yard of space and fire emphatically into the bottom corner, 12 minutes from time, to secure the victory in front of the Kop.\n\n1998-99: Southampton 1-2 Liverpool (August 16, 1998)\n\nA visit to the Dell Stadium saw Liverpool behind after 36 minutes as Norwegian striker Egil Ostenstad headed past Brad Friedel from close range. Just three minutes later, Karl-Heinz Riedle responded with an almost identical goal of his own, nodding in a Michael Owen cross to draw level before half-time. With less than 20 minutes to go before full-time, Owen completed the comeback, pouncing on a loose ball in the penalty area following a goalkeeping error from Paul Jones and smashing the ball into the empty net from close range to secure an opening-day victory.\n\n1995-96: Liverpool 1-0 Sheffield Wednesday (August 19, 1995)\n\nThe opening game of the 1995-96 season took place at Anfield with a visit from Sheffield Wednesday. Making his Liverpool debut following an English record fee at the time of £8.5million from Nottingham Forest, it was a game remembered for Stan Collymore’s remarkable second-half strike. With half an hour to play and the score still level at 0-0, Collymore picked up John Barnes’ pass before beating three opposition players with a superb piece of skill and curling an unstoppable strike into the corner of the net from long distance, marking his debut with an iconic winning goal.\n\n1994-95: Crystal Palace 1-6 Liverpool (August 20, 1994)\n\nJan Molby opened the scoring after just 12 minutes from the penalty spot after Rob Jones had been brought down in the box. A sumptuous solo effort by Steve McManaman doubled the lead just two minutes later. Robbie Fowler then pounced on a defensive error to surge through and give Liverpool a 3-0 lead heading into the break. Chris Armstrong’s header pulled one back for the hosts four minutes into the second half, but a brace from Ian Rush and another from McManaman completed a comprehensive 6-1 rout as Liverpool began the 1994-95 season in flying form."
