        "text": "Few players have divided opinion among the Villa faithful like the Serbian Savo Milosevic. For some he was a precociously talented striker, a match winner with a goal scoring track record, while for others he was a laboured, petulant character, unable to adapt to the rigours of the British game.\n\nWith two Yugoslavian League titles under his belt by the age of just 21, Villa boss Brian Little was persuaded to part with £3.5 million for the gifted youngster based on the strength of video evidence alone, in an effort to replace the Galatasaray bound Dean Saunders and form a strike partnership with Dwight Yorke.\n\nMilosevic made his debut in Villa's 3-1 opening day win over a young Manchester United team, a result that prompted pundit Alan Hansen to utter the now infamous phrase; 'You can't win anything with kids.'\n\nMilosevic scored his first goal in Claret & Blue in Villa's 1-1 draw at reigning champions Blackburn Rovers, and went on to complete his first hat-trick for the club in a 4-1 demolition of Midlands rivals Coventry City. Savo was on his way to achieving cult status on the Holte End as he fired in the opener from 20 yards, as Villa went on to lift the Coca-Cola Cup for the second time in three years, beating Leeds United 3-0 in the final. Villa also reached 4th in the Premiership in what was a highly successful season for the Midlands outfit, but it was Milosevic's blossoming partnership with Dwight Yorke that gave the fans encouragement that Villa would be lifting more than just the Coca-Cola Cup in the coming seasons.\n\nAfter the success of both his and Villa's 1995/96 season, much was expected of the Serbian in the new campaign, especially as strike partner Dwight Yorke had notched up 17 league goals during the previous season. While Milosevic scored a brace in front of the Villa fans in a 2-2 draw with Arsenal in the second game of the season, the Serb then failed to hit the league net again until late December, earning the striker the unfortunate nickname 'Savo Misa-lot-evic'.\n\nDespite the optimism of the previous season, Villa had to settle for a 5th place finish in the Premiership, one place worse off than the previous season, and were dumped out of the Uefa Cup in the first round stage by unfancied Swedish outfit, Helsingborgs. While Yorke continued his excellent scoring record, Milosevic's return of just 10 goals in his second season was not considered enough to deter manger Brian Little from signing Liverpool's Stan Collymore for a club record £7 million.\n\nThe start of the 1997-1998 season saw Milosevic benched in favour of the Yorke/Collymore strike partnership, but it was at the back where Villa were most vulnerable, losing their first 4 games to all but end any faint hopes of a title challenging season. While the Villans were making headway in the Uefa Cup, their league form had dipped alarmingly and it was the languid Milosevic who was targeted by the Villa faithful after a string of less than inspired performances. During a 5-0 drubbing at the hands of Blackburn Rovers in January '98, the clearly unsettled Serb was seen to spit in the direction of the travelling Villa fans, an incident which led to him being transfer listed and all but sealed his fate as the latest Villa Park Villan."
