        "text": "Liverpool signed Owen after he graduated from Lilleshall at 16, and joined the club on the Youth Training Scheme. The star of Liverpool's 1996 FA Youth Cup triumph, scoring in the final against a West Ham United team that included Frank Lampard and Rio Ferdinand, Owen scored prolifically as he rose rapidly through the Anfield ranks. After four months, he signed professional forms for the senior team just after his seventeenth birthday on 18 December 1996.\n\nHe made his debut for Liverpool against Wimbledon in May 1997, coming on as a substitute and scoring a goal. With an injury to Robbie Fowler, he was thrust immediately into action as a first team regular alongside the likes of newcomer Paul Ince and playmaker Steve McManaman in the following 1997–98 season. He scored his first European goal for the club against Celtic in the UEFA Cup and recorded his first professional hat-trick against Grimsby Town in the League Cup. His first Premier League hat-trick came later that season at Hillsborough against Sheffield Wednesday. Owen ended that season as a joint top scorer in the Premier League with Blackburn Rovers' Chris Sutton and Coventry City's Dion Dublin, scoring eighteen goals, and was voted the PFA Young Player of the Year by fellow professionals.\n\nThe 1998–99 season proved to be another good season for Owen as he scored 23 Goals in 40 games for Liverpool.. Owen managed to score 12 goals and helped Liverpool to qualify for the UEFA Cup.\n\nIn the 2000–01 season, he helped the club to their most successful season in several years. The team won the League Cup, FA Cup and UEFA Cup, with Owen scoring two goals in the last few minutes against Arsenal in the FA Cup final to turn what had appeared to be a 1–0 defeat into a 2–1 victory, the game has since been christened \"The Michael Owen Cup Final\".\n\nWinning the FA Cup and the UEFA Cup allowed Liverpool to play in the Charity Shield and the UEFA Super Cup at the beginning of the 2001–02 season. Liverpool won both matches with Owen scoring the second goal of the 2–1 win over Manchester United in the Charity Shield and the third goal in the 2001 UEFA Super Cup win over European champions Bayern Munich. Liverpool thus became the first English team to win five trophies in one calendar year.\n\nAt the end of the year 2001, Owen became the first English player in twenty years and the only Liverpool player ever to win the European Footballer of the Year award. He was also voted World Soccer player of the year in 2001; he is the only English player to win the award and was the first Premier League player to do so. He scored his 100th goal for Liverpool on 21 December 2001 against West Ham United. Liverpool finished second in the league in the 2001–2002 season and Owen played a key part in the success, scoring 28 goals.\n\nThe 2002–03 season saw Owen on top form again as he hit 28 goals. Liverpool were on top of the table and looked like genuine title contenders for the first time in several years, but a run of bad results saw them eventually finishing fifth in the table. Owen also scored at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff when Liverpool beat Manchester United 2–0 to win the League Cup and scored his 100th Premier League goal against West Bromwich Albion.\n\nIn an injury-hit 2003–04 season he still managed to score 19 goals, getting his 150th goal for the club on 15 February 2004 against Portsmouth, but otherwise it was a bleak season for both him and Liverpool.\n\nSince 1998 Owen had been Liverpool's top scorer every season until he left the club. Real Madrid signed him for a fee of £8 million on 13 August 2004, with midfielder Antonio Núñez moving in the other direction as a make-weight.\n\nRobbie Fowler can easily be considered as Liverpool’s first prolific goal scorer in the premier League era. His career began with Liverpool as a youth team player on leaving school in the summer of 1991, signing professional terms on his 17th birthday, 9 April 1992.\n\nFowler's first involvement with the Liverpool first team came on 13 January 1993, when he was an unused substitute in an FA Cup third round tie against Bolton Wanderers. In the following close season, Fowler helped the England under-18 team win the 1993 European Championship, before making a scoring first-team debut in Liverpool's 3–1 win in a first round League Cup tie at Fulham on 22 September 1993. Fowler scored all five goals in the second leg at Anfield two weeks later, making him the fourth player in Liverpool's history to score five in a senior fixture. He scored his first league hat-trick against Southampton in only his fifth league game.\n\nIn the 1994–95 season, Fowler was an ever-present for Liverpool, playing in all of their 57 competitive matches, including the victory in the 1995 League Cup final, and a match against Arsenal in which he scored the Premier league's fastest ever hat-trick- in four minutes and 33 seconds, a record that still stands. Fowler was voted the PFA Young Player of the Year in two consecutive years in 1995 and 1996, a feat equalled only by Ryan Giggs and Wayne Rooney.\n\nThroughout the mid and late 1990s, Fowler was widely considered to be the most natural finisher playing in England. Fowler sealed this reputation as he scored more than 30 goals for three consecutive seasons, up to 1997. Fowler's partnership with Steve McManaman was largely described as the reason why Liverpool had become the club known for being the most potent attacking force in England at the time, and Fowler was reknowned for scoring goals of all varieties, from every angle and distance.\n\nStan Collymore, Fowler's strike partner from 1995 to 1997, said in his autobiography that Fowler was the best player he has ever played alongside. Fowler and Collymore were among the most prolific goal-scoring strike partnerships in England during the 1995–96 season. In the same season he scored twice in a 4–3 victory over Newcastle United, a match voted the best of the decade in a Premier League poll. The match helped prevent Newcastle from winning the league, but it was not enough for Liverpool to clinch the title; they finished third while Manchester United were crowned champions.\n\nOn 14 December 1996, he scored four against Middlesbrough, including his hundredth for Liverpool. This meant he reached a century of goals one game quicker than his first strike partner, Ian Rush, in just 165 games.\n\nFowler’s actions on the pitch however ranged from exemplary to derogatory. He won the UEFA Fair Play award in 1996 but also had a few match bans and fines imposed on him for his controversial goal celebrations.\n\nBeing injury-hit and with problems surrounding the Liverpool FC coaching management, Robbie Fowler left Liverpool FC in 2001 to join Leeds United after having scored 120 goals for the club in 236 appearances.\n\nOn 27 January 2006, Fowler rejoined Liverpool from Manchester City on a free transfer, signing a contract until the end of the season. Fowler had remained a Liverpool fan after he left the club; he was in the Istanbul crowd when Liverpool won the Champions League in 2005.\n\nThe fans were overjoyed to learn that Fowler had returned; there were large banners in the game against Birmingham City which read 'God - number eleven, welcome back to heaven', with 'God' being Fowler's nickname while he was previously at Liverpool. He opened his account for the second time against Fulham, the same team against which he had begun scoring 13 years earlier for Liverpool FC.\n\nLater, in what transpired to be his last appearance for the club, against Charlton Athletic on 13 May, Fowler was given the captain's armband one final time. He was substituted two minutes from the final whistle and given a standing ovation. The crowd still chanted his name as the match finished and applauded him for his years of service. He finished his second run as a Liverpool player with a UEFA Champions League runners-up medal, although he was not named in either the starting eleven or the seven substitutes. He became a free agent on 1 July having scored 183 goals in 369 appearances during his two spells at the club.\n\nKevin Keegan was arguably one the better signings made by the legendary Bill Shankly.\n\nAfter Shankly snapped Keegan up from Scunthorpe United’s first team where despite his age—he scored 18 goals in 124 games for the club. Shankly was ready to hand him a £35,000 transfer fee took him to Liverpool in 1971 at the age of 20 . Keegan made his Liverpool debut against Nottingham Forest at Anfield, and scored after 12 minutes.\n\nAlthough originally signed as a midfielder, his attacking prowess and finishing ability soon prompted manager Bill Shankly to employ Keegan upfront as a partner for John Toshack.\n\nIn 1973, Keegan won his first domestic honours where playing alongside John Toshack, Keegan helped Liverpool win their first League championship in seven years as well as the UEFA Cup. Keegan scored twice in the first leg of the final as Liverpool overcame Borussia Mönchengladbach 3–2 on aggregate.\n\nIn the final,of 1974 FA Cup, Keegan scored two as Liverpool beat Newcastle United 3–0. It was the first brace in an FA Cup final since Mike Trebilcock scored twice for Everton in 1966, thus earning rave reviews in the process.\n\nIn 1977, Keegan helped Liverpool progress towards an unprecedented \"treble\" of League championship, FA Cup, and European Cup, though midway through the season he announced his intention to leave in the summer to play abroad.\n\nHowever, Keegan proved instrumental as Liverpool clinched the title and reached the finals of both Cup competitions.\n\nKeegan's last appearance in a Liverpool shirt on home soil, however, saw Liverpool lose the FA Cup final to bitter rivals Manchester United, ending the possibility of the \"treble\".\n\nThe European Cup final in Rome against Borussia Mönchengladbach was four days later. Keegan did not score, but he did make a late run which led to a foul inside the penalty area by Berti Vogts. This led to a penalty, which was successfully converted by Phil Neal, sealing a 3–1 win.\n\nAfter 323 appearances and exactly 100 goals, Keegan left Liverpool as promised. He had been made offers from clubs across Europe and chose to join Hamburg SV in the West German Bundesliga for £500,000. Liverpool replaced him with Kenny Dalglish.\n\nWhen Bill Shankly joined Liverpool FC as a manager, the club was comfortably placed in the middle of second division tier of English football and thus to pull it out from the shackles had to be a primary aim for the ex-Huddersfield Town manager.\n\nLiverpool at that time were facing a lot of problems with a crumbling stadium and other poor infrastructure facilities. The squad was also not upto the mark.\n\nShankly then went on to release 24 players from the squad in favor of better players whom he thought could pull off the leap to first division football again.\n\nIn what followed amongst other key signings was the extremely instrumental signing of Ian St. John from Motherwell in Scotland.\n\nPrior to his Anfield move, St. John scored one of the fastest hat-tricks on record when at Motherwell in two minutes and 30 seconds, against Hibernian in 1959.\n\nSt. John or “the saint” and co. paid dividends as Liverpool romped to the Second Division title by a clear eight points over Leyton Orient, with St. John playing 40 times scoring 18 goals.\n\nThey finished a respectable eighth in their first season back in the top flight, but surprised everyone by winning the League Championship the following season, overturning a 17 point deficit to win the title by four points over bitter rivals Manchester United and five over reigning champions Everton.\n\nSt. John played a major role in the title success, appearing 40 times and scoring 19 goals.\n\nHe went on to score many vital goals for Liverpool, which included the flying, whiplash header that he hammered past Leeds United's Gary Sprake to win the FA Cup in 1965 for the first time in the club's history.\n\nAnother League championship followed in the 1965/66 as the Anfield club finished six points clear of Leeds. Ian chipped in with 10 goals from 41 outings. St. John and the rest of Liverpool tasted defeat, however, as they were beaten in their first ever European final.\n\nBorussia Dortmund beat them 2-1 at Hampden Park in the Cup Winners Cup\n\nPrior to his Anfield move, St. John scored one of the fastest hat-tricks on record when at Motherwell in two minutes and 30 seconds, against Hibernian in 1959.\n\nSt. John or “the saint” and co. paid dividends as Liverpool romped to the Second Division title by a clear eight points over Leyton Orient, with St. John playing 40 times scoring 18 goals.\n\nThey finished a respectable eighth in their first season back in the top flight, but surprised everyone by winning the League Championship the following season, overturning a 17 point deficit to win the title by four points over bitter rivals Manchester United and five over reigning champions Everton.\n\nSt. John played a major role in the title success, appearing 40 times and scoring 19 goals.\n\nHe went on to score many vital goals for Liverpool, which included the flying, whiplash header that he hammered past Leeds United's Gary Sprake to win the FA Cup in 1965 for the first time in the club's history.\n\nAnother League championship followed in the 1965/66 as the Anfield club finished six points clear of Leeds. Ian chipped in with 10 goals from 41 outings. St. John and the rest of Liverpool tasted defeat, however, as they were beaten in their first ever European final.\n\nBorussia Dortmund beat them 2-1 at Hampden Park in the Cup Winners Cup\n\nLiverpool’s then manager Bob Paisley paid a record fee for a teenager of £300,000. It remains Chester's record sale almost 30 years on which just goes to show how highly the 18-year old was rated by Paisley. His Reds debut came on the 13 December that year in a First Division fixture at Portman Road against Ipswich Town.\n\nIronically, he was standing in for his future strike-partner Kenny Dalglish (at the time, one of the most highly-rated strikers in the world) and wore his No. 7 shirt. Midfielder Jimmy Case scored Liverpool's only goal in a 1–1 draw.\n\nAt this stage, Liverpool were defending the league title and the League Cup and also contending for the European Cup, while Ipswich were emerging as surprise title contenders.\n\nRush was used sporadically during his first season at the club, as Liverpool had a policy of bringing in young talent and playing them in the reserves to learn \"the Liverpool way\".\n\nThis learning period was hard and not at all \"Rush-like\", as the goals didn't flow, almost leading to the eager youngster leaving Anfield in the search of regular first-team football, but he decided to stay on and fight for a place after being motivated by Paisely.\n\nRush's first goal for the club took time to arrive, but it eventually came on 30 September 1981 during a European Cup first round second leg tie at Anfield against Oulun Palloseura.\n\nHe ended the season as the club's top scorer, netting 30 times in just 49 appearances in all competitions, a ratio of one goal every 1.6 games. 17 of these goals came in the League as he helped the Reds reclaim the League championship from holders Aston Villa.\n\nThe title triumph was all the more impressive by the fact that Liverpool had entered 1982 in 10th place, with the likes of Manchester United and minnows Swansea City leading the pack then, before a turnaround in Liverpool's fortunes saw the league championship trophy return to Anfield after two years away. He also scored a goal to help Liverpool win the 1982 Football League Cup Final against Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nHe was voted PFA Young Player of the Year in 1983 after inspiring Liverpool to a second successive First Division/League Cup double, though once again success eluded them in the European Cup. He scored 24 League goals as the Reds finished 11 points clear of runners-up Watford and were virtually uncontested in the title chase in the later part of the season.\n\nOn 6 November 1982, Rush scored four goals against Everton in a 5–0 victory, a post-war record for goals by a single player in a Merseyside derby.\n\nThe League Cup (Liverpool's third successive triumph in this competition) was added through a 2–1 win over bitter rivals Manchester United after extra time at Wembley. He was voted PFA Player of the Year and BBC Wales Sports Personality of the Year in 1984 as Liverpool retained both the League and the League Cup and won the European Cup to complete a unique treble that season.\n\nIt was no surprise that Rush also added the Football Writers Footballer of the Year to the PFA award he had already claimed—the same feat that his strike partner Kenny Dalglish had achieved a year earlier.\n\nHe scored 47 goals in 65 games (making him the highest goalscorer in all competitions for any professional club that season), a goal every 1.4 matches, as Liverpool finished three points clear of closest rivals Southampton in the League, beat derby rivals Everton 1–0 in the replayed final of the League Cup (after a 0–0 draw in the first ever all-Merseyside final), and won their fourth European Cup by defeating AS Roma 4–2 on penalties (Rush made it 3–2 before Bruce Grobbelaar's famous 'jelly legs' antics) following a 1–1 draw after extra time.\n\nIn 1985, the Rush and Dalglish pair proved lethal, especially against Merseyside rivals Everton in the FA Cup final as Liverpool went on to win 3–1 and completed the first (and so far only) League and FA Cup double in the club's history. Rush added the Man of the Match award to his winner's medal.\n\nIn 1992, he picked up a third FA Cup winners' medal, scoring Liverpool's second goal, in the 67th minute, in the 2–0 win against Second Division Sunderland at Wembley.\n\nIn March 1996, it was announced that Rush would be leaving Anfield on a free transfer when his contract expired on 1 June.\n\nRush ended his Liverpool career in two spells with a brief one year uncomfortable stint at Juventus. Rush scored 139 goals for the Reds 224 appearances which lasted from 1980-87. His second spell for the club saw him appear 245 times for the club and score 90 goals therein.(1988-96). Thus his total tally remains an impressive 229 goals for the club in 469 appearances maintaining a record of scoring a goal in every two appearances for the club (approximately).\n\nIan Rush is thus credited with the tag of being the highest goal scorer for the Reds to date."
