        "text": "In today’s climate, watching football is no longer an affordable hobby. Despite the elite clubs enjoying a constant revenue stream, ticket prices continue to rise and the ordinary working man is now priced out of watching the club they love. From the outside looking in, it appears football is no longer a working class game….\n\n…Or is it? In light of the rising costs of watching the sport, more and more supporters are voting with their feet and turning to the grassroots game in order to satisfy their need for a football fix.\n\nIf you’re planning to visit a non-league club in the near future, here’s a handy guide for you to follow in order to make sure you get maximum enjoyment from your grassroots adventure.\n\nDo…Embrace your local footballing community\n\nNine times out of ten, your local professional outfit is not the only club in your area, take Manchester for an example. As well as United and City, the area can boast a thriving grassroots scene featuring clubs such as Altrincham, Curzon Ashton, FC United of Manchester, Stalybridge Celtic, Ashton United and Maine Road FC. Even my local area (Grimsby and Cleethorpes) can boast non-league clubs in the shape of Cleethorpes Town (Evo-Stik NPLD1 South, step 4), Grimsby Borough (Northern Counties East League Division One, step 6) and Immingham Town (Lincolnshire League, step 7). My advice here is to look around you, your local football community doesn’t begin and end with the area’s professional side.\n\nDon’t…Freeload\n\nSo matchday has rolled around and the time has come for you to part with your cash and go through the turnstiles. Chances are you’ve paid less than a tenner to get in, which is fantastic but your entry shouldn’t be the last thing you pay for on the day. At the end of the day, one of the reasons you’ve chosen to sample some non-league football is to try and get more for your money so it makes sense use some of the cash you’ve saved to help boost the club’s coffers. Whilst non-league football clubs aren’t charity cases and nobody is expecting you to raid the merchandise table for a replica shirt, scarf, mug and official club garden gnome (they are a thing), the £1.50 you’ll spend on a programme or the 50p for a ticket for the half time raffle will probably be a lot more valuable than you think.\n\nDo…Immerse yourself in the club’s history\n\nLots of non-league clubs are steeped in hundreds of years of history, whilst they may not be years of domestic or continental dominance some clubs may have more to learn about them than meets the eye. Sheffield FC (Evo-Stik NPLD1 South, step 4) are probably one of the best examples of this as they were the world’s first football club and recently celebrated their 160th anniversary, their home ground, The Coach and Horses, is quite rightly an essential stop for any football historians willing to learn about how the game really began and grew into what we know and love today.\n\nSome clubs can even boast some star names both on and off the field in the past, Hallam FC (Northern Counties East League Division One, step 6) can count former Tottenham and England midfielder Chris Waddle as one of their former players whilst near neighbours Stocksbridge Park Steels (Evo-Stik NPLD1 South, step 4) can be credited with kick-starting the much publicised rise of Leicester City and England striker Jamie Vardy. Just because a non-league club doesn’t have a museum for you to look around, doesn’t mean there isn’t any history to learn about.\n\nDon’t…Be overly critical of what you see on the field\n\nPicture the scene, you’ve paid your admission fee, bought your programme and pre-match drink and taken your position to watch the game. Everything starts off well but then things unravel and the team you’ve chosen to visit have suddenly gone 3-0 down after half an hour.\n\nNow if you were at Old Trafford or the Emirates Stadium, you’d probably be well within your rights to vent your anger, however at non-league level, the players you see will have been at work throughout the week just like you and me, some may have been at work on the morning of the game or may even be working after the game has finished. These players take to the field on a rainy, muddy Saturday afternoon for the love of the game, not to line their pockets. Besides, chances are you’ll end up bumping into them in the clubhouse once the game has finished so it may be wise to keep your comments to yourself.\n\nDo…Get the kids involved\n\nAs the popular song goes, children are the future so teach them well and if you have kids (or grandchildren/nieces/nephews, delete as applicable) try and include them in your non-league voyage of discovery. It’s a commonly used phrase these days but football really isn’t a TV show and taking the kids to a non-league club is probably one of the best ways to back up this statement to them.\n\nUsually it won’t cost you more than £3 to take a child to a grassroots game (some clubs even admit young children in for free) and most clubs run football training sessions and have teams ready to cater for any youngsters eager to get into playing the game. Non-league can help open youngster’s eyes and show them that FIFA video games, Match Attax and Super Sundays aren’t the be all and end all of football in the modern day.\n\nDon’t….Complain about the facilities on offer\n\nAt Stamford Bridge or the Etihad you might be able to get into the ground quickly by scanning the barcode on your season ticket, you might be able to get a pie and a drink quickly and efficiently and you might even be able to connect to wi-fi to use your pbone and check how your accumulator might be doing but at non-league level be prepared to be stripped of all your football mod cons.\n\nThere’s a good chance that the people making sure you have a grassroots game to attend aren’t getting paid for their efforts. You might have to wait a little bit longer to get served at the bar at half time and your match programme might have one or two typos in it but just like the players on the field, those responsible for the running of the club and staging of the fixtures will have been working through the week and are giving up their time in order to help the team they love and remain involved in our great game. If you do find yourself waiting a little while longer for your half time pint, keep your mutterings and sighs to a minimum unless you’re willing to….\n\nDo…Climb aboard and get involved\n\nSo 4.45pm has rolled round and if you’re lucky, your first non-league experience has ended in a victory for your chosen team.\n\nChances are you’ll leave the ground thinking ‘What’s next?’ Really there are two options, you can lend your support on a more regular basis and keep attending matches or alternatively you could become a volunteer and become invaluable to the club.\n\nNobody is expecting you to give up your 40 hour a week full time job to ensure the club continues to run, by simply giving an hour a week by the turnstiles with the box of programmes or going round selling the raffle tickets or spaces on the name card for the half time prize giveaway you’ll become vital to the club and make a big difference. There’s a good chance you’ll find the experience incredibly rewarding and you might even make some lifelong friends and meet some fantastic people along the way.\n\nThat brings our non-league guide to an end, if you’re planning on attending a grassroots game in the near future then I hope you bear some of these points in mind.\n\nWhy not join the conversation on social media, I’m always happy to hear from people about their non-league experiences and I enjoy interacting with fans from other clubs. Come and say hello on Twitter, I can be found @Dan_Barker16.\n\nUntil next time, take care.\n\nWe all know the achievements of Sir Alex Ferguson’s glittering management career. The Govan native successfully managed to break the Old Firm monopoly with Aberdeen before taking The Dons on to the European stage, beating the mighty Real Madrid in the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup Final.\n\nAfter replacing ‘Big’ Ron Atkinson at the helm of Manchester United in 1986, Ferguson made it his purpose to knock Liverpool ‘off their f___ing perch’ and re-establish United as the top dog of English football. A slew of domestic honours as well as propelling United to two Champions League triumphs over the course of his 27 years at the club suggests he managed to fulfil his goal.\n\nWhilst the fruits of his labour from his managerial career are well documented, what did Ferguson’s playing days consist of, join us as we find out.\n\nTeenage Kicks\n\nOur story begins at in 1957 Queen’s Park, the famous amateur club based in Glasgow, where a fresh out of school Alexander Chapman Ferguson took his first steps to becoming a footballer.\n\nFerguson made his debut as a fresh faced sixteen year old. In his first autobiography ‘Managing My Life’, he described his bow as a ‘nightmare’ although could take some solace in notching The Spiders’ sole reply in the 2-1 defeat to Stranraer. One of the more infamous games of Fergie’s playing career was to occur on Boxing Day 1959 when Queen’s Park travelled to Queen of the South. Festive cheer was in short supply as the Dumfries side ran rampant, hammering Queen’s Park 7-1 with former Manchester City and England striker Ivor Broadis netting four goals, again Ferguson was able to score a consolation for The Spiders.\n\nDespite making use of his sporadic appearances in the first team for Queen’s Park, a return of 20 goals from 31 appearances wasn’t enough for the young striker to command a regular starting berth and in 1961 he moved to Perth and joined St Johnstone.\n\nFerguson’s time with The Saints proved to be a difficult and unhappy one, again he struggled to gain a regular first team place. His time with St Johnstone saw the striker fall out of favour leading to many requests to leave the club and at one point Scotland altogether as emigration to Canada was considered. The main highlight of his time in Perth coming in a match against his boyhood heroes, Rangers.\n\nDecember 1963 (Oh What A Night!)\n\nDespite starting life in the First Division reasonably well, the newly promoted St Johnstone had suffered a dip in form as the 1963/64 season rolled into the winter. Attempting to arrest the decline in form, Saints manager Bobby Brown tried to bring in some new blood to increase the threat of the forward line, when his pursuit of a new forward ended without any new acquisitions, Ferguson was selected for the clash with the reigning Champions.\n\nHis selection came just a few weeks after a transfer to Raith Rovers almost materialised although an injury in a reserve match at Airdrie curtailed the move to Kirkcaldy.\n\nThe victory at Ibrox reads almost like one of the many memorable performances Ferguson’ Manchester United side would become famous for. The striker netted ten minutes into the second half to make the scores 1-1 before reacting quickest after the Rangers keeper had failed to hold on to Bobby Kemp’s crashing 25 yard drive. The Gers equalised from the penalty spot but this did little to deter St Johnstone and Ferguson crowned both the team’s and his own personal performance by scoring the winning goal with just twelve minutes remaining.\n\nThe hat-trick delivered The Saints their first win at Ibrox since 1926 and most importantly garnered attention from potential suitors willing to sign Ferguson, Dunfermline eventually secured his services prior to the 1964/65 season. Fergie’s four year spell with The Saints brought a return of 19 goals in 37 games.\n\nFerguson’s time at East End Park would become his most prolific, he would go on to notch 66 goals in 89 matches, his first season with The Pars saw the club come incredibly close to winning both the Scottish First Division and the Scottish Cup. A poor performance in a league clash with former club St Johnstone saw Fergie dropped for the Cup Final which Dunfermline would lose 3-2 to Celtic. The league title also eluded The Pars as they ended up finishing third, a point behind eventual Champions Kilmarnock who won the title on goal average from second placed Heart of Midlothian.\n\nIn the following 1965/66 season, Ferguson netted 45 goals in 51 matches in all competitions as The Pars managed a fourth place finish in the First Division and reached the last eight of the Fairs Cup in Europe. On a personal level for Ferguson, his 31 league goals saw him share the accolade of Division One’s overall top goalscorer with Joe McBride of Celtic.\n\nHomeward Bound\n\nFerguson’s impressive goalscoring haul with Dunfermline attracted the attention of his favourite boyhood team and in 1967 he completed a £65,000 move back to Glasgow to join Rangers. The fee was at the time was a record for a transfer between two Scottish clubs.\n\nThe two years Ferguson spent at Ibrox returned 25 goals from 41 appearances but would end acrimoniously in the wake of Rangers’ defeat to arch-rivals Celtic in the 1969 Scottish Cup Final. Tasked with marking the great Celtic captain Billy McNeill, Ferguson was directly blamed for one of the goals that contributed to the 4-0 defeat.\n\nFergie was dropped from the first team and had to suffer the ignominy of being forced to train with Rangers’ reserve side, an experience that proved so damaging that he reportedly threw away his Scottish Cup runners-up medal and eventually contributed to his departure from the club.\n\nThe Final Curtain\n\nAs the Ibrox exit door neared, Nottingham Forest expressed an interest in bringing Ferguson south of the border although the move never came due to wife Cathy’s reluctance to move to England and he instead moved to Falkirk.\n\nIn his four years at Brockville Park, he managed to make a career best 95 appearances, notching 37 goals, his first season (1969/70) even saw him help Falkirk on their way to winning the Scottish Division Two title. As a result of his increased experience, Fergie made his first steps into coaching by joining the backroom staff at the club. The transition to player/coach was ended when John Prentice was appointed as Falkirk manager and revoked Ferguson’s coaching responsibilites. The decision cast a shadow over Fergie’s time at the club and he eventually requested a transfer. His transfer request was accepted and the now 32 year old Fergie joined Ayr United in 1973.\n\nSomerset Park would be the final destination of Ferguson’s playing days with the striker calling time on his almost twenty career at the end of a 1973-74 season which brought 9 goals from 24 league appearances.\n\nThroughout the duration of his playing career, Ferguson never received a cap for the full Scottish national team although he did manage to play representative football at certain intervals of his career. After a solitary scoring appearance for Scotland Amateurs in 1960, Ferguson was selected to play for a Scotland XI that toured Asia, Oceania and Canada in 1967. Seven goals on the tour helped the Scotland XI gain a perfect record of nine wins from nine matches, Fergie also represented the Scottish Football League in 1967, scoring once in two appearances.\n\nUpon his retirement in 1974, the next chapter of Ferguson’s career began as he was appointed manager of East Stirlingshire, but that’s another story.\n\nThat brings to an end our look back at Sir Alex’s playing days, I hope you’ve enjoyed the career retrospective.\n\nIf you have any memories of Fergie’s playing career why not get in touch and share them with me on Twitter, I can be found @Dan_Barker16.\n\nUntil next time, take care.\n\nHello and welcome to a new series in which we take a nostalgic look back at some classic editions of the FIFA World Cup, accompanied by the contemporary number one hits of the time.\n\nIn this first edition we’re going to turn the clock back twenty years to the summer of 1998 in France.\n\nIn terms of the home nations, England were still riding high on the crest of the Euro 96 wave of optimisim and managed to finish top of their qualifying group, sealing their place at the finals with a memorable 0-0 against Italy in Rome. Scotland joined their neighbours in France as a reward for finishing second behind Austria in qualifying Group 4, the campaign included an excellent 1-0 win over Sweden at Hampden as well as the famous ‘One Team In Tallinn’ match in which Estonia failed to take the field thus handing The Tartan Army a walkover win (although the tie was later ordered to be replayed).\n\nEngland found themselves drawn in Group G alongside Tunisia, Colombia and 1994 quarter-finalists Romania. Scotland were given a tough draw in Group A against Morocco, Norway and World Cup holders Brazil.\n\nBefore we get stuck into the tournament, let’s take a look at England and Scotland’s official World Cup anthems.\n\n‘(How Does It Feel?) To Be On Top Of The World’ by England United, a ‘supergroup’ consisting of The Spice Girls, Ian McCulloch of Echo and the Bunnymen, Tommy Scott of Space and Simon Fowler of Ocean Colour Scene was England’s official World Cup 98 song and was released on June 1st 1998. The track peaked at number 9 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/2T68AXsUAEI\n\n‘Just Don’t Come Home Too Soon’ by Del Amitri was Scotland’s official World Cup 98 anthem and was released on June 13th 1998. The track peaked at number 15 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nGroup Stage\n\nAfter all the pre-tournament hype and excitement, Brazil and Scotland finally got the tournament underway on June 10th. Cesar Sampaio gave the reigning champions the perfect start with a near post header past Jim Leighton after just five minutes, Scotland were not to be deterred and managed to net an equaliser with seven minutes of the first half remaining thanks to a John Collins penalty. Despite Scotland having chances in the second half, Tom Boyd netted an unfortunate and somewhat unwitting own goal to hand the defending champions a 2-1 win.\n\nJohn Collins equalises for Scotland against Brazil from the penalty spot in the opening game of the 1998 World Cup.\n\nBrazil would eventually progress as group winners, recording a resounding 3-0 win over Morocco to seal qualification for the second round although they would fall to a surprise 2-1 defeat to group runners-up Norway in the final fixture before the knockout round. Unfortunately for Scotland, their official anthem became something of a self-fulfilling prophecy as they once again failed to progress further than the first round after drawing 1-1 with Norway before succumbing to a 3-0 defeat at the hands of Morocco.\n\nThe host nation managed to negotiate their group with a minimum amount of fuss, racking up three wins from three matches and scoring nine goals, conceding just one.\n\nIran and the United States took to the field for arguably the most politcally charged match in World Cup history, the match was seen as a symbol of unity between the two nations for the first time since political tensions had risen following the Iranian revolution in 1979 and the players exchanged flowers and posed for a group photo prior to kick off.\n\nIran’s 2-1 win gave them a faint hope of qualification for the second round although they were quickly extinguished following a 2-0 reverse at the hands of eventual group winners and European Champions, Germany.\n\nEngland’s players celebrate Darren Anderton’s opening goal in their final group game against Colombia, the 2-0 win secured England’s passage into the second round.\n\nGoals from Paul Scholes and Alan Shearer gave England a 2-0 win over Tunisia to provide a great start to their campaign in Group G. Following a last minute 2-1 defeat against Romania, qualification hopes rested on their final group game against Colombia in Lens. Thankfully a Darren Anderton strike and David Beckham’s first international goal delivered a 2-0 win to book a last-sixteen showdown with old rivals Argentina.\n\n‘C’est La Vie’ by B-Witched was released on May 31st 1998 and debuted at Number One in the UK Singles Chart, holding the position for two weeks thus maintaining the Number One at the beginning of the World Cup.\n\nSecond Round\n\nChristian Vieri’s eighteenth minute goal was enough to give Italy a 1-0 win over Norway in the opening match of the last-sixteen whilst Brazil showed their class to overcome Chile in their all-South American clash, two apiece from Cesar Sampaio and Ronaldo helped deliver a 4-1 win for the Selecao.\n\nFrance needed extra time to see off Paraguay, Laurent Blanc’s 114th minute winner helped the hosts into the quarter final, 1992 European Champions Denmark joined Les Bleus in the last-eight after their 4-1 win over the surprise winners of Group D, Nigeria.\n\nDespite being one of the pre-tournament favourites, Germany survived a huge scare in their last-sixteen clash with Mexico. Die Mannschaft needed goals from Jurgen Klinsmann and Oliver Bierhoff to spare their blushes and cancel out Luis Hernandez’s 47th minute opener. Germany’s great rivals, Holland had Edgar Davids to thank after his stoppage time winner saw them through to the last-eight after securing a 2-1 win over Yugoslavia.\n\nJurgen Klinsmann equalises for Germany in their 2-1 win over Mexico in their last-sixteen match.\n\nIn an attempt at visible team unity, the Romanian players all dyed their hair blonde for their clash with Croatia, the impressive World Cup debutants managed to quell the Romanian’s enthusiasm with Davor Suker’s goal enough to see Croatia into the quarter-finals.\n\nEngland and Argentina battled it out in the final and arguably most entertaining second round fixture. Gabriel Batistuta and Alan Shearer both scored from the penalty spot as the two rivals traded early blows before Michael Owen announced himself fully on the international stage with a fine individual effort to give England the lead although Javier Zanetti’s equaliser ensured the game would be level at half time.\n\nThe game changing moment came early in the second half when David Beckham was given his marching orders by referee Kim Milton Nielsen for kicking out at Argentine midfielder Diego Simeone, England then had a Sol Campbell goal disallowed as the game went into extra time and ultimately penalties. Spot kicks would once again prove to be England’s downfall as Paul Ince and David Batty added their names to the list of players guilty of misses from twelve yards with the Argentines prevailing 4-3 on penalties.\n\n‘Three Lions ’98’ by Frank Skinner, David Baddiel and The Lightning Seeds was released on June 8th 1998 and reached Number One in the UK Singles Chart on June 20th, holding the position for three weeks. This re-released version of the 1996 hit became only the second song to reach Number One with different lyrics to it’s original song.\n\nQuarter Finals\n\nFrance were the first team to qualify for the semi finals although they needed a penalty shoot out to see off 1994 finalists Italy, misses from Demetrio Albertini and Luigi Di Biagio eventually cost the Azzuri their place in a third consecutive World Cup semi final.\n\nBrazil and Denmark played out an entertaining encounter in Nantes, Martin Jorgensen gave the Danes a surprise second minute lead before Bebeto equalised less than ten minutes later. Rivaldo added a brace to ensure of qualification to the last-four although Brian Laudrup had levelled affairs early in the second half.\n\nHolland made the semi finals at the expense of Argentina, disposing of the 1986 Champions 2-1 in Marseille, the game is probably best remembered for Dennis Bergkamp’s stunning stoppage time winner. The Arsenal midfielder received Frank De Boer’s raking long pass and used his first touch to bring the ball under control before turning away from Argentine defender Roberto Ayala and planting a fine effort with the outside of his right foot beyond the despairing Carlos Roa.\n\nDennis Bergkamp runs away in celebration following his stoppage time winning goal against Argentina in the quarter-final. The goal has since been regularly named as one of the top 10 goals of all time.\n\nCroatia came up with the biggest shock result of the tournament, dumping the heavily fancied Germans out of the competition, 3-0 in Lyon. The 1990 Champions struggled to find a reply to Robert Jarni’s first half goal and eventually succumbed to two goals in tbe last five minutes from Goran Vlaovic and another one from Davor Suker.\n\n‘Because We Want To’ by Billie Piper was released on June 29th 1998 and reached Number One on the UK Singles Chart on July 11th, holding the position for one week.\n\nSemi Finals\n\nBrazil secured their place in a second consecutive World Cup Final after defeating Holland 4-2 on penalties following a 1-1 draw after extra time.\n\nRonaldo gave the holders the lead in the first minute of the second half but were denied the win in normal time thanks to Patrick Kluivert’s 87th minute equaliser. Neither side could muster an extra time golden goal which led to the dreaded penalty lottery, the third of the tournament.\n\nBrazil’s safe passage was secured thanks to Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Emerson and Dunga converting their spot-kicks in addition to misses from Holland’s Phillip Cocu and Ronald De Boer.\n\nThe Selecao would be joined in the final by France after the host nation managed to overcome Croatia in the second semi-final by a score of 2-1 at the Stade De France.\n\nDavor Suker’s fifth goal of the tournament gave Croatia the lead in the 46th minute but their supremacy lasted less than a minute after Lillian Thuram scored a French leveller. The Parma centre back proved to be the unlikely hero as he netted what proved to be the winning goal with twenty minutes remaining.\n\nThe win for Les Bleus was marred however as Laurent Blanc was sent off and thus ruled out of the final following a skirmish with Croatia’s Slaven Bilic, television replays showed that the Everton defender had dived which contributed to Blanc’s dismissal.\n\nThird Place Play-Off\n\nCroatia capped their first ever World Cup appearance by recording a third place finish after defeating Holland 2-1 at Parc Des Princes. Robert Prosinecki and Davor Suker’s sixth goal of the tournament contributed to the victory. Suker’s goal also confirmed the Real Madrid striker as the recipient of the Golden Boot for the 1998 World Cup.\n\nDavor Suker celebrates after Croatia’s 2-1 win over Holland in the 1998 World Cup Third Place Play-Off. Suker’s 35th minute goal was his sixth of the tournament which confirmed him as the winner of the Golden Boot for the tournament.\n\n1998 FIFA World Cup Final\n\nFrance crowned their hosting of the tournament by crushing World Cup holders Brazil 3-0 to win the 1998 World Cup in front of a joyous 80,000+ crowd at the Stade De France.\n\nThe pre-match build up centred around Ronaldo, firstly his shock omission from Mario Zagallo’s starting line-up before his dramatic reinstatement just before the players went to partake in their warm-up. The reasons for the striker originally being left out of the side remain conflicted although it has become generally accepted that the Inter Milan forward had suffered from seizures and illness in the hours prior to the game leading to Zagallo selecting Edmundo to lead the line for Brazil. Rumours began to surface that kit suppliers Nike began to pressure Zagallo into changing his mind and choosing Ronaldo to start.\n\nRonaldo’s performance (or lack of) allowed Zinedine Zidane to take centre stage, the Juventus midfielder gave his side the lead in the 27th minute before doubling the French advantage in fjrst half stoppage time, both goals were identical headed efforts from corner kicks.\n\nMarcel Desailly was sent off with twenty minutes remaining after receiving his second booking of the match. Brazil were buoyed by their numerical advantage and began to apply a certain degree of pressure on their opponents. Their efforts proved futile and France were able to seal the victory in the last minute as Emmanuel Petit latched on to Arsenal team-mate Patrick Vieira’s pass to fire a low shot past Claudio Taffarel to strike the final blow to Brazil and give his side an unassailable 3-0 lead.\n\nFrance’s players celebrate with the trophy following their World Cup Final win over Brazil. Zinedine Zidane’s brace and Emmanuel Petit’s late winning goal were enough to secure a first ever World Cup win for ths hosts who had failed to qualify for the tournament in the United States four years earlier.\n\nThe jubilant French public packed on to the Champs Elysees to celebrate the victory and Zidane had his face projected on to the Arc D’Triomphe as captain Didier Deschamps received the trophy to secure France’s place in history and mark the beginning of a massively successful period for Les Bleus who would go on to add the European Championship in Holland two years later.\n\nThat brings to a close our nostalgic footballing and musical look back at the 1998 World Cup, I hope you have enjoyed our trip down memory lane. If we’ve stoked up some memories of the tournament then why not join the conversation and get in touch, I can be found on Twitter @Dan_Barker16.\n\nI’ll leave you with the official anthem of the tournament, ‘The Cup of Life’ by Ricky Martin.\n\nUntil next time, take care.\n\nFor more about the 1998 World Cup, head on over to iTunes or SoundCloud and subscribe to ‘Alive and Kicking: The 90s Football Podcast’ where you can find an entire episode dedicated to the tournament entitled ‘Coupe Du Monde’.\n\nManchester United’s famous ‘Class of 92’ were arguably the greatest group of footballing youth team products to ever lace up a pair of boots. Ryan Giggs, David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Gary Neville and Nicky Butt went on a swashbuckling journey that saw the group win countless trophies and become legends in their own right.\n\nNowadays it’s quite difficult to escape the group. Giggs, Neville and Scholes have turned their hand to television punditry, Beckham is still very much Britain’s favourite poster boy whilst Butt is now heavily involved with Manchester United’s youth department. In addition to these ventures Neville, Scholes, Giggs and Butt along with Phil Neville are the public faces spearheading the operation to propel Salford City from non-league obscurity to Football League stardom, a revolution that has been televised, originally on the BBC and more recently on Sky Sports.\n\n15th May 1992 was the night that put the ‘Class of 92’ on the map as they helped United defeat Crystal Palace by an aggregate score of 6-3 to deliver the FA Youth Cup to Old Trafford for the first time since the 1960s. Whilst Giggs, Beckham, Scholes, Neville and Butt went on to footballing fame and fortune, what happened to their colleagues from the team? Sit back as we take a look.\n\nKevin Pilkington\n\nThe Youth team goalkeeper signed a professional contract following the Youth Cup triumph but had to wait almost two and a half years to make his first team debut, coming on as a substitute for an injured Peter Schmeichel ironically against Crystal Palace in November 1994. Pilkington then made his first start in the 1995-96 season although it came in ignominy as United sunk to a humiliating 3-0 home defeat to York City in the League Cup.\n\nTwo loan spells to Rochdale and Rotherham United followed as Pilkington failed to dislodge Tony Coton and later Raimond Van Der Gouw as Schmeichel’s understudy. Two final first team appearances came over the Christmas period of the 1997-98 season, a 2-0 Boxing Day win over Everton before a surprise 3-2 defeat to Coventry City at Highfield Road. As the 97-98 campaign drew to a close, Pilkington travelled north of the border for another loan spell, this time to Celtic.\n\nA move to Port Vale in 1998 saw the start of a nomadic career which also took in spells with Aberyswyth Town, Wigan Athletic, a promotion winning campaign with Mansfield Town and surviving relegation with Notts County. After a sojourn into the Conference with Luton Town, Plikington returned to Nottingham as County’s goalkeeping coach whilst also making two further appearances for the club as emergency cover between the sticks in 2013 and 2014. As of September 2017 Kevin was working on the coaching staff at League Two outfit Cambridge United.\n\nJohn O’Kane\n\nDefender John O’Kane signed his first professional contract in 1993 as an 18-year-old but had to wait over two years to make his first team debut, the infamous 3-1 defeat away at Aston Villa on the opening day of the 1995-96 season. First team opportunities proved limited for the Nottingham native and eventually left United to join Everton in 1998 following loan spells with Wimbledon, Bury and Bradford City.\n\nO’Kane’s time on Merseyside didn’t bear much fruit with the defender only managing 14 appearances in two years before moving on to Bolton Wanderers where he helped Sam Allardyce’s men gain promotion to the Premier League. After two years on the West Coast with Blackpool, O’Kane went into non-league football where he plied his trade with Hyde until his retirement in 2006. Nowadays O’Kane runs a soccer school for children in the North West.\n\nGeorge Switzer\n\nOne of only two members of the Youth Cup winning squad to never play a first team game for Unuted, Switzer was released from his one year contract at the end of the 1992-93 season. A move to Darlington saw the left-back struggle to gain a regular first team role, leading to his stay in the North East becoming a brief one. Switzer returned to Manchester after leaving Darlington and combined regular full time work with a decent career at non-league level with clubs such as Hyde, Salford City and Irlam.\n\nChris Casper\n\nSon of Burnley legend Frank Casper, the centre half (alongside Gary Neville and Paul Scholes) won international honours whilst at United, adding the 1993 U18 European Championship to the Youth Cup triumph.\n\nCasper’s first team debut came over four years after the Youth Cup win, helping United defeat Swindon Town in the 1996-97 League Cup, two more starts came in the cup competitions of 96-97 along with substitute appearances in the Premier League and Champions League.\n\nLoan spells at Bournemouth. Swindon and Reading followed before Casper made his stay in Berkshire permanent, joining The Royals for £300,000 in 1998. Injury caused his career to come to an unfortunate end at the young age of 24 in 1999 when he failed to fully recover from a shocking double leg fracture suffered in a Boxing Day clash with Cardiff City.\n\nManagement was Casper’s next step, coaching Team Bath into the first round of The FA Cup in 2003 before joining Bury as reserve team manager, later becoming first team manager in 2005 becoming the youngest manager in the Football League aged 30.\n\nAfter leaving Bury in 2008, Casper took backroom roles at Bradford City and Grimsby Town and later worked in a support role for the Premier League. As of 2017, he can now be found re-united with his Class of 92 team-mates as Sporting Director of Salford City.\n\nSimon Davies\n\nMidfielder Davies became one of the first members of the squad to be capped internationally, turning out for Wales in 1996. This was in addition to making more than 20 first team appearances for United and scoring in the Champions League at Old Trafford against Galatasaray.\n\nFollowing loan periods with Exeter and Huddersfield, Davies joined Luton Town for £150,000 in 1997 although his spell in Bedfordshire would be a short one, leaving the club after one season to join Macclesfield.\n\nAfter a short spell with Rochdale, Davies eventually began to establish a career in the Welsh league with clubs such as TNS, Rhyl, Airbus and two spells at Bangor City.\n\nNowadays, Davies can be found on the other side of the Manchester footballing divide, coaching Manchester City’s under-23 team.\n\nColin McKee\n\nScottish forward McKee made his first team debut as a substitute in the final home game of the 1993-94 season against Coventry City and although he won the prestigious Denzil Haroun Reserve Player of the Year, found first team opportunites limited, eventually returning north of the border and joining Kilmarnock in 1994 as part of a joint deal with team-mate from the reserves, Neil Whitworth.\n\nMcKee’s career took in several Scottish clubs including Partick Thistle, Queen of the South and Queen’s Park before eventually finishing with Fauldhouse United.\n\nBen Thornley\n\nEngland under-21 midfielder Thornley saw his first team opportunites at United tempered by several injury problems, making only eight more appearances for United following his debut in February 1994 against West Ham United.\n\nThornley would eventually leave the club in 1998, joining Huddersfield Town on a permanent basis following a loan period under the guidance of former United captain Steve Bruce.\n\nRelegation to what is now League One saw Thornley leave West Yorkshire to make the move to Scotland, joining Aberdeen in 2001.\n\nAfter two years in the SPL, Thornley returned to the Football League with Blackpool and a short stint at Bury before taking up part time football with clubs such as Halifax Town, Bacup Borough, Salford City and playing alongside brother Rod (now a physiotherapist with Manchester United) at Witton Albion.\n\nRobbie Savage\n\nAlong with George Switzer, Welshman Savage was the only other member of the Youth Cup squad to never play in Manchester United’s first team.\n\nThe midfielder joined Crewe Alexandra in 1994 and helped Dario Gradi’s side win promotion to Division One in 1997 before Leicester City secured his services to play in the Premier League.\n\nHis five years at Leicester included a Wembley win in the 1999-2000 season, defeating Tranmere Rovers to win the League Cup.\n\nAfter The Foxes were relegated from the Premier League in 2002, Savage moved to Birmingham City before joining Blackburn for £3,000,000 in 2005.\n\nIn addition to 39 caps for Wales, Savage once had the unwanted distinction of receiving the most yellow cards in Premier League history, although the record has been overtaken since his retirement in 2011 with Derby County.\n\nAfter retiring Savage has become a well known media personality, working as a pundit for BBC television and radio as well as BT Sport.\n\nKeith Gillespie\n\nNorthern Irish winger Keith Gillespie made his first senior appearance for United a few months after the Youth Cup win, scoring on his first team bow in a 2-0 FA Cup win against Bury.\n\nSporadic first team opportunites came following a brief loan spell at Wigan Athletic but Andrei Kanchelskis proved difficult to oust as United’s first choice right winger. Gillespie eventually joined Newcastle United in 1995 as part of the deal that took Andy Cole to Old Trafford.\n\nGillespie’s three years on Tyneside saw two consecutive second place finishes in the Premier League and a Champions League victory over Barcelona before joining Blackburn Rovers in 1998.\n\nSpells at Leicester City, Bradford City, Darlington and across in Ireland with Glentoran and Longford Town followed before he was declared bankrupt in 2010 after years battling gambling addiction.\n\nMembers of the Class Of 92 and friends take to the field for a special friendly match against Salford City shortly after Gary Neville, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt, Ryan Giggs and Phil Neville completed their takeover of the Moor Lane club.\n\nThat brings to a close our look back at some of the lesser remembered members of the Class of 92, I hope you have enjoyed this piece.\n\nIf you did enjoy it, let me know on Twitter where I can be found @Dan_Barker16.\n\nWith Russell Osborne from The Three Lions Podcast\n\nHello, after a bit of an extended break away from the page, Barker On Football is back and once again we’re going down deep into the basement and opening the vault in the dreaded Football Room 101.\n\nMy guest on this edition is Russell Osborne, co-host of the excellent Three Lions Podcast, a regular show for fans of our glorious national team. Without further ado let’s get stuck in and see what Russell has chosen to consign to Room 101.\n\n‘Hi Russell, first of all I always like to start with a little bit about the guest so to kick off, who do you support and who is your favourite ever player?’\n\n‘I’ve been an Arsenal fan since 1987 when I went to see them beat Liverpool in the Littlewoods Cup Final that year. I would have been about 8 years old and went home and pretended to be Charlie Nicholas. As for my favourite ever player that is a tough one, Dennis Bergkamp was awesome although I must admit I could always appreciate Gazza’s quality, even if he did play for ‘them’!’\n\n‘Excellent, I must admit that although I’m a Manchester United fan I always have had a begrudging respect for Bergkamp, especially after his goal against Argentina at France 98. For those unaware then, give us a bit of an intro to the Three Lions Podcast.’\n\n‘The Three Lions Podcast is the only England football podcast recorded by supporters and was the brainchild of host Ryan Power. I’m a member of the England travel club and I’ve tagged along on the podcast since episode 4. We try to record every month and cover everything from the seniors and women’s team and down into the age groups, it’s been a rather interesting year for them. Our show is available on iTunes and on our website, threelionspodcast.com.’\n\n‘Sounds good, I listened to your most recent episode on the way to work the other day and have to admit it is a great show, you and Ryan should be proud of what you have produced. With all this mind, let’s get down to why you’re here. Please tell us your first induction into the Football Room 101.’\n\n‘My first choice is Friday Night Football.‘\n\n‘Football, the beautiful game goes back years and a lot longer than 1992. It has been played by men, women and children at all times of the day but in a professional capacity at 3pm on a Saturday, except occasionally on a Tuesday or Wednesday under floodlights. The Euros or World Cup may treat us to a game every day of the week but it feels special, like a one off.\n\nSky in their infinite wisdom launched Premier League Friday Night Football last season and even though it didn’t blow anyone away they kept it for this season with Arsenal vs Leicester City being the first game. This meant that by the time Arsenal played Norwich City in the Carabao Cup on October 24th they had played a game on every day of the week.\n\nI know football has been played on Friday nights for years in the Championship and lower leagues but it doesn’t seem right, football doesn’t need to be 7 days a week, let it have a day off. Midweek away games can be difficult on the working football fan and travelling to the arse end of the country for a game usually means taking half or even a full day off work, catching trains and then waiting round for late trains home only to be dragged round the supermarket by the other half on a Saturday.\n\nThe pubs probaby aren’t complaining as they will probably do alright out of it but back in the days when I went to the pub it was to have a laugh and a chat with my mates at the end of a long week whilst watching the scores come in.’\n\n‘That’s a great choice, I have to say I’m not the biggest fan of having games on a Friday night, it’s made worse by the fact that Saturday night matches may start to occur when the new Premier League TV deal is signed. What’s your second indction?’\n\n‘My second nomination for Room 101 is Panini stickers featuring England players.‘\n\n‘Despite being far too old to be collecting football stickers, everytime a tournament comes round I can’t resist. I say to myself I’ll stop when there is a player older than meand with Italy not qualifying and thus no Buffon there’s a good chance there’ll be no World Cup stickers for me, although someone has pointed out that Egypt have a goalkeeper aged 45!!\n\nI’ll only ever collect Panini stickers, I can’t bring myself to move across to Topps or Merlin although the FA did and took their branding with them leaving Panini in a bit of a predicament. It appeared to start with France 98, which didn’t feature the Three Lions crest, just a generic St. George’s Cross and a collage of heads whilst the individual players were wearing tracksuit tops. This evolved into the Euro 2000 collection which saw the England players have their heads badly photoshopped on to what looked like plain white Fruit of the Loom T-shirts and I can remember Ireland suffering a similar fate at the 2002 World Cup. Luckily enough for Euro 2016 England appeared wearing their Nike kit and suddenly all was well.’\n\n‘Finally someone else who echoes my view on the topic, as an avid sticker collector I can vouch for how annoying that was. Enlighten us then if you will with your third and final induction to Room 101.’\n\n‘My third and final choice is the Mexican Wave.‘\n\n‘Despite the name, the Mexican wave was apparently born in America in the early 80s at a baseball game, although it did make a few appearances at the 1986 World Cup. As a regular at Wembley for England games you’ll often hear a small chant and ripples erupt at around the 70 minute mark, usually as a consequence of the quality of football on show. Next thing you know, the whole stadium is involved in a massive wave including the upper tiers, I’ve seen grown men trying to start these things and it’s awfully embarrasing but amusing when it goes wrong.\n\nFortunately when I go away watching England I’m in similar company as when wave attempts reach the away section many middle fingers go up and it’s greeted with a chorus of boos, a bit like when a wave attempt reaches the prawn sandwich seats at Wembley.\n\nI must admit I would love to see two opposite waves start and see what happens when they meet, hopefully a small explosion or something although I think there is only one occasion a wave should occur, between family and friends at a Mexican airport.’\n\n‘I have to admit, I quite enjoyed not being part of a wave when one started at Old Trafford for the Manchester United legends game I attended recently.’\n\nThat brings to a close our trip into the archives as I slam the door closed on the Football Room 101, I would like to thank Russell for joining us and for venting his thoughts on what grinds his gears when it comes to football. We’ll take another trip to Room 101 soon.\n\nIn the meantime, why not join the conversation on Twitter, let me know what it is about the beautiful game that angers you using the hashtag #FootballRoom101. You can find me @Dan_Barker16.\n\nUntil next time, take care.\n\nThe Three Lions Podcast is the only podcast made for England supporters, by England supporters and is available to download and listen to on iTunes and also on their website which can be found at threelionspodcast.com. You can also follow the show on Twitter where they can be found @3LionsPodcast.\n\nWith Dave Black, author of ‘The World According to Championship Manager Season 01-02’\n\nWhat is it that really grinds your gears about football. Maybe it’s a certain player who gets your goat, it might be a specific match or perhaps a despised away kit from days gone by.\n\nIn the first of a new series, I’ve given author and Championship Manager superfan Dave Black the opportunity to vent his feelings on a number of football topics and consign them to the dreaded Room 101.\n\n‘Hi Dave, thanks for joining me for Football Room 101. Before we get started with your choices, talk us through the new book’\n\n‘I’m back again attempting to re-write England history, this time on the road to the 2002 World Cup. Championship Manaver 01-02 is my time machine as we relive the season as it’s played through the game whilst I try to better England’s quarter final performance at the World Cup. I’ve got to replicate England’s win in Germany first.’\n\n‘That sounds great, hopefully Father Christmas will be kind and put a copy under the tree. Now that we have covered the book, let’s get stuck into why we’re here then, what is your first choice to consign to Football Room 101?’\n\n‘My first choice is Stuart Pearce selecting Ryan Giggs for Team GB at the 2012 Olympics instead of David Beckham‘\n\n‘I really grew a hatred for Ryan Giggs a few years previously when he won Sports Personality of the Year when he had only made 20 starts over a calendar year, the media kept saying over and over how great it was as he was still playing after all those years. By the time of the Olympics, David Beckham had been heavily involved in both the bid and the build up to the Games so it made sense that he would take his place as part of Team GB. Goodness knows why but Pearce picked Giggs instead and Beckham’s involvement in the Olympics was left restricted to being on a speedboat with the Olympic torch.’\n\n‘I must admit as a Manchester United fan I was pleased to see Ryan finally play in a ‘major’ tournament, although I can understand people being aggrieved towards his selection, especially given David Beckham’s contribution in the lead up to the Olympics. Could I now please have your second choice?’\n\n‘My second choice is players holding on to the ball or kicking it away after a free kick has been given.‘\n\n(Robin Van Persie is sent off for kicking the ball away during Arsenal’s 2011 Champions League defeat to Barcelona)\n\n‘It really angers me as they are still delaying the game so it doesn’t matter if the ball is 2 or 200 yards away!’\n\n‘We’ve had two great selections so far, what is your third and final entry into Room 101?’\n\n‘My third choice is the fourth placed team in the Premier League qualifying for the Champions League instead of another Cup winner such as the FA Cup Winners.‘\n\n(Arsenal players celebrate in the dressing room after finishing fourth in the 2012-13 Premier League)\n\n‘The FA Cup has lost a lot of it’s charm over the years and I blame the Champions League and the fact it’s now more lucrative to finish fourth in the league than it is to actually win something. As a fan I find this really sad. Winning the FA Cup would at least mean you’re the Champions of something and would probably lead to increased interest and stronger team selections. It’s a shame it probably won’t happen though due to the potential of the Premier League suffering from supposed ‘brand damage’.’\n\n‘We’ve had some great choices Dave, thank you for joining me and setting the world to rights.’\n\n‘Glad I can help, thanks for having me.’\n\nThat brings to a close our first trip to Football Room 101, I would once again like to thank Dave for joining me and sharing his selections. Maybe you have something that annoys you about the game that you want to get off your chest, if you do then why not join the conversation on Twitter. Tweet me @Dan_Barker16 using the hashtag #FootballRoom101 with your rant.\n\nUntil next time, take care.\n\nDave Black’s new book ‘The World According to Championship Manager 01-02: Sven, 5-1 and the Golden Generation’ is available now to purchase from Amazon using the following link https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1979586586/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_hLybAb9VCVR3M&nbsp;\n\nFor more information on Dave’s books, blogs or general Championship Manager nostalgia you can find Dave on Twitter @cm9798.\n\n…Robson O’Reardon, Manager of McMillan FC\n\nIf you’ve ever played football for any sort of organised team then there’s a good chance that at some point during your ‘career’ you’ll have played in a charity match of some sort. Imagine if you can then playing football regularly with the main aim of raising funds and awareness for a chosen charity. This is exactly the objective of MacMillan FC, a team based in Luton who mainly aim to raise funds to aid the vital work undertaken by MacMillan Cancer Support.\n\nThis week I was lucky to be able to speak to MacMillan FC’s manager, Robson O’Reardon who took time out of his busy schedule to answer a few questions about his involvement and the club in general, hope you enjoy it.\n\nJust before we get into the main body of the interview with Robson, I just want to say a quick thank you to everyone who has been in touch with their nice comments and feedback regarding my recent article about the rise of Cleethorpes Town which features in the latest issue of the Non-League Magazine. Every single reply, like or share means everything to me and I’m incredibly grateful to you all and to the Non-League Magazine for the opportunity.\n\nIf you’re interested, my article begins on page 90 of issue 19 of the magazine and as a special treat you can have a read of it for free by using the following link https://issuu.com/svponline/docs/non_league_issue_19?e=14477809/54870429&nbsp;\n\n‘Hi Robson, thanks for taking the time to speak to me, first of all for those unaware, tell us a little bit about MacMillan FC’\n\n‘MacMillan FC was formed in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire in 2014 by a gentleman by the name of Justin ‘Crossy’ Cross with the aim of raising as much money as possible for MacMillan Cancer Support and between 2014 and 2017 the club raised over £20,000.\n\nIn 2017 the club was taken over by myself due to Justin having other commitments and the club moved to Luton. My aim is to raise the profile of the club and become everyone’s second favourite team by doing things the right way and for the right charity.’\n\n‘It’s always good to hear about people using football to help charities, especially such a worthy cause like MacMillan, does the club play in a local league within the Luton/South East area or occasional friendly fixtures?’\n\n‘At the moment MacMillan FC only play in friendly fixtures, mainly due to us newly reforming and still being on the lookout for players. We do have a lot in store for 2018 but I can’t reveal too much just yet.’\n\n‘That sounds intriguing. If you’re ever in my local area give me a call! You mentioned earlier the club’s background and history, how did your involvement with the club come about?’\n\n‘My involvement began around the same time of the club’s original formation. My step dad passed away in 2014 and I wanted to repay the charity that helped him through his final months. Having lost a couple of family members recently, I want to give back to those that help others in their time of need.\n\nI played for a Luton Town fans team called Hatters Talk who played against MacMillan FC in a yearly fixture. From there I got to know a few others who had the same idea of raising money for MacMillan.’\n\n‘It’s always nice to hear when people want to give something back to those who have helped them during times of need. What has the response been like from MacMillan and the local community as a whole?’\n\n‘MacMillan have been tremendously supportive, any way to raise money for the charity is always welcomed but I think they can see our potential and how big we can become’\n\n‘It’s great to hear the charity are supportive of the club. You mentioned earlier that the club have some big plans for 2018, where do you see MacMillan FC in a few years time?’\n\n‘I aim to make MacMillan FC known to thousands of people up and down the country. I want us to emulate the likes of Palmers FC and Hashtag United but without forgetting the main cause.\n\nI love meeting new people and on a slightly selfish note I’ve met so many people who I’ve grown up watching on TV and YouTube.\n\nI want them to get on board with the football club, sharing our story and promoting the club to get more people to donate to charity.’\n\n‘Excellent, it’s always good to hear about people’s ambitions. Finally just for a bit of fun, if you could have anyone turn out for MacMillan FC for just one game, who would it be?’\n\n‘Now that’s a difficult one. If I was basing it on people who follow me on Twitter I would probably say (YouTuber) WillNE.\n\nIf it had to be a celeb though I would probably say either Russell Howard, Jack Whitehall or Thierry Henry’\n\nThat brings my interview with Robson to a close. I would once again like to thank him for taking the time to speak to me and would also like to pass on my best wishes for the future and I hope they raise a lot of money and awareness for such a good cause.\n\nMy final thank you as always goes to yourself for taking the time to read the page, everyone’s support is greatly appreciated.

To be fair former internationals coming out of exile is nothing new (#CheapPlug: as detailed here https://barkeronfootball.wordpress.com/2017/10/19/throwbackthursday-when-samba-came-to-garforth/) but whilst Merson is turning out in the valleys to help out an old mate, sometimes ex-pros can be found dusting off their boots for more commercially minded ventures. This is the story of one such occasion.\n\nWhen you think of the FA Cup and it’s history and traditions, it is difficult to not think of Wembley, although it is quite likely you’d be thinking of the national stadium and self styled ‘venue of legends’ as opposed to a club in the Combined Counties League. With this in mind it can be forgiven if more than one or two eyebrows were raised in the lead up to the 2011-12 season when Budweiser (and their parent company Anheuser-Busch) announced they had linked up with minnows Wembley FC.\n\nWembley, or The Lions as they are known by their fans, ply their trade at the tiny Vale Farm Park in the North London borough of Brent and prior to the 11-12 season kicking off were most famous for playing host to England and their famed ‘Boys of 66’ as their home doubled up as the training headquarters for Alf Ramsey’s side as they geared up to conquer the world. All this appeared to change as, in a groundbreaking move, their FA Cup Extra Preliminary round tie away at Ascot United was shown live around the world, not on any major TV outlet but streamed on Budweiser’s official Facebook page. In front of a six figure internet audience and a record crowd of 1,149 at the Racecourse Ground, goals from Chris Korten and Roy Byron (Richard Whiteley-esque pun alert!!) proved that Wembley really were at the races (I’m so sorry) as they cantered into the next round.\n\nAlthough the FA Cup dream would not last any further than the Preliminary round, lightbulbs began to pop off in the marketing department at Budweiser as in March of 2012 the brewery announced they were to become Wembley FC’s main sponsors. In addition to a smart new set of Umbro home and away strips (complete with the company logo emblazoned on the front), a refurbished clubhouse at Vale Farm and a new minibus to ferry the players to and from matches, eyebrows were raised further when, a fortnight after the sponsorship deal was announced, the club appointed former England and FA Cup winning manager (with Tottenham in 1991, as well as a losing final appearance with QPR in 1982) Terry Venables as the club’s new ‘Techincal Advisor’, in terms of star appointments, this was merely the tip of the iceberg.\n\nJust as it appeared that the excitement of Venables’ appointment and the sponsorship deal had died down, yet another blaze of publicity was created in the pre-season of 2012 when several former star names signed on the dotted line to join The Lions.\n\nThe club suddenly became packed with FA Cup pedigree after clinching the signings of Graeme Le Saux (winner with Chelsea in 2000), Martin Keown (winner with Arsenal in 1998, 2002 and 2003) and ‘only’ Ray Parlour (winner with Arsenal in 1993, 1998, 2002 and 2003, scoring the opening goal in the 2002 Final win over Chelsea). Wembley were even blessed with a touch of World Cup quality as American international Brian McBride and team mate of a certain Diego Armando Maradona, Claudio Caniggia also signed up. The custodian of Arsenal’s FA Cup wins in 1993, 1998, 2002 and 2003 David Seaman was also recruited as the club’s new goalkeeping coach as the PR exercise went into full swing. The whole story was to be played out in an ‘exciting’ ESPN documentary which was also to be sponsored by Budweiser. In the lead up to the extra preliminary round, the brewery and the FA were both forced to make statements denying the sponsorship deal was a conflict of interest given Budweiser’s backing of the FA Cup itself.\n\nAugust 12th 2012 saw the long awaited launch date for the project as Wembley welcomed Spartan South Midlands League at Vale Farm. The experiment needed only 13 minutes to look as if it would bear fruit as the side containing McBride, Le Saux, Parlour and Caniggia (Martin Keown started on the bench) went into an early lead, the goal coming courtesy of the former Argentina international.\n\nAlthough Langford managed to grab an equaliser, one of Wembley’s regular players, Daryl Atkins netted a brace to help The Lions into the next round. After the victory it was confirmed that the former superstars would be available for the Preliminary Round tie away at Uxbridge.\n\nIn the run up to the Uxbridge game, another star name joined the Wembley ranks as the late Ugo Ehiogu (FA Cup finalist with Aston Villa in 2000) agreed to play in the tie which was to be televised live on ESPN.\n\nThe Preliminary Round clash proved to be the most entertaining of the run as Wembley threw away a 2-0 lead to allow Uxbridge back into the tie, drawing 2-2 and forcing a replay. Despite the star names on show, two of Wembley’s regulars found the net as Paul Shelton and Daryl Atkins (again) looked to have secured progression for The Lions. Uxbridge had other ideas as Kev Warner and Chris Moore managed to claw The Reds back into the tie, securing a replay to send the home section of the 754 strong crowd away still in the hat.\n\nUxbridge ensured that the experiment ended almost as spectacularly as it had begun as they dumped Wembley out of the Cup in the replay by an emphatic 5-0 scoreline. Of the star names who had previously turned out, only Caniggia made it on to the field for the game. The headlines actually belonged to Uxbridge striker Matty Woods who bagged himself a hat-trick.\n\nIt seemed ironic that the experiment was centred around a documentary called ‘Dream On’ as that was all Wembley were left able to do, their dreams of the National Stadium were well and truly shattered.\n\nThat brings to a close our look back at Wembley’s FA Cup endeavours, if you’re connected to the club or just have your own memories of the experiment, why not get in touch. I can be found on Twitter @Dan_Barker16.\n\nUntil next time, take care.\n\n….Andy Dixon, Sheffield FC historian and provider of live matchday updates through @SheffieldFC_com.\n\nWhat springs to mind when you think of your club. Pride? Passion? Belief? Or maybe it’s history.\n\nNo matter what history you think your club possesses that makes them stand clear of the rest, Sheffield FC can top the lot. The Evo-Stik Northern Premier Division One (South) outfit were the world’s first football club and today (October 24th) are celebrating their 160th anniversary.\n\nTo mark the occasion, I was lucky enough to speak to club historian and the man behind Sheffield’s live matchday Twitter account (@SheffieldFC_com), Andy Dixon.\n\nJoin us as we discuss his role within the club, the excitement that comes with such an anniversary and what the future may hold for Sheffield FC.\n\n‘Hi Andy, thanks for taking the time to speak to me during this busy period for the club, first of all, how did you become involved with the club?’\n\n‘I followed Sheffield Wednesday and my son James, who was 3 at tbe time wanted to get into football so I thought non-league would be best to take him to at that age. I went to Sheffield because of the history (and I didn’t realise how close I lived to Hallam’s ground either) and I fell in love with the club and non-league in general pretty quickly. I’m a bit of a numbers and data geek so I asked the club what history records they had. They didn’t have much and asked me if I fancied a challenge so my involvement really spiralled from there.’\n\n‘That’s great to hear, it’s always nice to hear people’s ways into non-league football. How aware of the club’s place in football history when you first joined?’\n\n‘It was always a ‘Sheffield secret’, word didn’t spread as quickly as it does these days but I was always aware the city had the world’s oldest club. I’d been to a game at the Owlerton Stadium in the 1990s but I didn’t really get into it until I started going in early 2009.’\n\n‘Admittedly my knowledge of the club was quite vague until the 150th anniversary celebrations and coverage of the Inter Milan game on local news. Moving away from the history side of the club for a moment, what does your role entail within the club on a regular basis?’\n\n‘I got involved with trying to collate a history archive pretty quickly and a few of us have put together a pretty good record over the years. Everyone at the club was really helpful as was fellow supporter Rich Stevenson, we spent many hours trawling the news archives at Sheffield library. Another supporter by the name of Ben Webster is a history graduate and he found us some amazing stuff from the club’s really early years. I’m now listed as the club’s historian and I write history pieces for the matchday programme and also ensure all the statistics are up to date. I also made the mistake of tweeting updates from matches I attended and that’s where the @SheffieldFC_com account came from and has barely missed a game over the past few seasons. Between myself and Stuart James (ood job man and media editor at the club) we try to keep the Twitter account about the non-league club and from the feedback we’ve had, people appear to enjoy our irreverent take on the joys of following Sheffield FC.’\n\n‘That’s brilliant, I really like the idea of swotting up on stats from days gone by and have spent many an hour doing it myself in the past. How does it feel to be part of a club steeped in such history?’\n\n‘It gives me a great sense of pride in the club and the city of Sheffield. It’s a story I think we can all be proud of and shout out to the world, which the club have done a great job of over the past 10-20 years. I still get a buzz from seeing my name listed in the programme as the historian of the world’s oldest football club and I’m sure not many people at non-league level get requests for interviews from places like America and France.’\n\n‘The club is very proud of it’s history and so it should be, modern football as we know it today wouldn’t exist without it. What exactly are the plans to celebrate the 160th anniversary of the club?’\n\n‘There is a game taking place on the day of the anniversary between a team of ex-Sheffield players (many of whom played against Inter Milan and Ajax as part of the club’s 150th anniversary celebrations) and a side representing our sponsors, Classic Football Shirts. They have helped us immensely this season in bringing our replica shirts out for less than £20 and have also designed a traditional red and black quartered shirt to celebrate the anniversary. Tonight’s game should be a fun occasion, played for enjoyment and in the right spirit. It should be competitive too as I know CFS have roped in a couple of ringers in former Manchester United players Clayton Blackmore and David May.’\n\n‘Sounds like it should make for an exciting occasion, I’m gutted I can’t make it although I plan on visiting the club at some point this season. Do the players and club officials feel under any pressure to make this season a memorable one given the anniversary?’\n\n‘I don’t think so really, we set a new record every year for being the world’s oldest club so we’re quite used to getting a bit of a push whenever October 24th comes around. I feel somewhat sorry for people who follow the Twitter account as they get swamped with retweets from some massive clubs and organisations wishing us a happy birthday. On the pitch we are hoping for a successful season (although we have made a slow start) but I feel everyone wants as much success as possible every season so I don’t think there is any extra pressure on.’\n\n‘I’m sure it’ll be memorable regardless of performance on the field, where do you think the club will be in ten years time when you’re preparing to celebrate the 170th anniversary?’\n\n‘The aim is to move the club back into the heart of Sheffield, at Olive Grove which is a site close to the club’s original home. While that would be amazing I would also miss the club’s current home, not least the fantastic Coach & Horses pub which is attached to it. I would expect us to be celebrating our 170th anniversary back in Sheffield and seeing the club continue to grow from strength to strength, hopefully for many years to come. We are at level 8 of the English game at the moment so it would be nice to progress at least one step higher and be in our new permanent home by the time we reach 170.’\n\n‘Future progression at non-league level is always something I love hearing about, Just before we finish then, what would you describe as your favourite moment from the club’s long history?’\n\n‘There are obviously many great stories from the whole history of the club, for the first 50 years Sheffield were very closely tied to the development of the game as a whole. They had a huge input into the laws of the game and were a leading club, reaching the Quarter Finals of the FA Cup three times in the 1870s and had players represent England in early international fixtures.\n\nAs many amateur clubs were lost to the game in the advent of professionalism, Sheffield fought against the rise and the story of Viv Simpson is a personal favourite, he was probably the last great amateur player and played for the Wednesday as they won leagues and cups in the early 1900s but he remained an amateur and Sheffield FC was his first love. He was a hero off the field as well and fought in World War I, winning the military cross in the process although he sadly died towards the end of the conflict.\n\nThe club’s greatest success was probably winning the FA Amateur Cup in 1904 and also reached the final of the FA Vase. I also love the story of our record goalscorer Geoff Robinson who netted 241 goals in 227 games during the 1950s, he was known to drink several pints before a game and used to carry his false teeth in a handkerchief wrapped round his hand while he played.\n\nOn a personal level, beating Hallam to win the Senior Cup in 2010 was a highlight as was the 2011-12 season when we played some amazing football and reached the play-offs (before sadly getting battered 7-0 at Ilkeston). One memory I’ll never forget though is a fan dumping a waste paper bin on a player’s head as he walked round the pitch after getting sent off in an FA Cup game!’\n\nWhat a great memory to end the interview on! I’d like to once again personally thank Andy for taking time out to speak to me during what is obviously a busy time for the club. If you’re in the local area and can get down to the Coach and Horses ground in Dronfield this evening, the special match between Sheffield FC XI and Classic Football Shirts kicks off at 7pm.\n\nAll that remains for me to say is that I hope Sheffield FC enjoy the rest of their special day and to wish them good luck for the remainder of the season.\n\nThanks for joining us and until next time, take care.\n\nFor more on Sheffield FC you can find them on Twitter @Sheffieldfc.
