        "text": "Prior to the 1995–96 season, Sir Alex Ferguson, conspicuously, raised a few eyebrows when he sold experienced players like Paul Ince, Mark Hughes and Andrei Kanchelskis, and opted not to sign any experienced players. Instead, he kept faith in his young fledglings – Nicky Butt, David Beckham, Paul Scholes and the Neville brothers, Gary and Phil.\n\nA young United lost the first match of the season 3-1 to Aston Villa on August 19, 1996 — 22 years back. The critics were promptly clamouring for Ferguson's blood and former Scottish footballer and commentator Alan Hansen took a dig at his countryman and said: \"You can't win anything with kids.\"\n\nUnited, however, bounced back to win its next match against West Ham at Old Trafford. The team went on to win 24 of its next 36 matches and capture the League crown with 82 points.\n\nUnited also won the FA Cup, beating Liverpool 1-0 in the final, completing a domestic double, becoming the first English side to do so."
