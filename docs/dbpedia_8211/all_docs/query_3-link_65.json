        "text": "Robbie Fowler was born on April 9th 1975 and was brought up on the Toxteth estate in Liverpool, England. As a youngster he supported Everton. While at Nugent Secondary school he was selected to play for Liverpool Schools Under-14's where he was spotted by Jim Aspinall, a scout from Liverpool Football Club. Two Years later he signed on as a YTS trainee and on April 9th 1992, on his 17th birthday, Fowler signed professional forms. Fowler helped England Under-18's win the European Championship in the summer of 1993.\n\nRobbie Fowler was given his professional debut for Liverpool by Greame Souness against Fulham in the League Cup in September 1993. Fowler scored in a 3-1 win and in the second leg two weeks later scored all five of Liverpool's goals in a 5-0 win, becoming only the fourth player in Liverpool's history to score five goals in a senior fixture. In only his fifth league game Fowler scored his first Premiership hat-trick against Southampton. 12 goals in his first 13 games for Liverpool led to Fowler making his England Under-21 debut against San Marino in November 1993, and he scored the opening goal after 3 minutes. By the end of the 1993/94 season Fowler had scored 18 goals in a brilliant debut season, finishing as Liverpool's leading goalscorer despite missing two months with a hairline fracture on his ankle.\n\nFowler started the following season in fine form scoring a hat-trick against Arsenal in 4 minutes 32 seconds, the fastest hat-trick in history. Fowler was sent-off for the first time in his career while playing for England Under-21's against Albania in November and on Boxing Day was hit with an FA disrepute charge and fined after an incident at Leicester City. Fowler finished the season with 31 goals in all competitions becoming the first Liverpool player in six years to score more than 30 goals in a season. He was also an ever-present in the Liverpool side and picked up a League Cup winners medal and the PFA Young Player of the Year Award. He also made his first appearance for the England 'B' side.\n\nIn the 1995/96 season Fowler amazingly surpassed his feats of the previous season by scoring 36 goals in all competitions. He also made his England debut against Croatia. In 1996/97 Fowler again hit more than 30 goals.\n\nIn February 1998 disaster struck. Having scored 13 goals during the 1997/98 season Fowler picked up an injury which would see him sidelined for many months and miss the 1998 World Cup in France.\n\nFowler returned in the 1998/99 season with 18 goals but his season was marred by a controversial celebration after scoring a penalty against Everton, when Fowler ran along the touch-line sniffing it like cocaine, which resulted in a six match ban.\n\nFrom then on Fowler struggled to hold down a place in the Liverpool side with manager Gerard Houllier prefering the partnership of Michael Owen and Emile Heskey, though Fowler did manage to score in Liverpool's League Cup final win over Birmingham and in their UEFA Cup final success over Alaves.\n\nAfter more than two seasons of playing a bit-part at Anfield Fowler decided to move on and joined Liverpool's rivals Leeds United for a fee believed to be ï¿½11 million. Since then he has been on fine form and looks certain to be included in Sven-Goran Eriksson's England squad for the World Cup."
