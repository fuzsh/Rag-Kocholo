        "text": "The Premier League has had a strange and random tendency to improve over the latter portions of a given decade. English teams racked up 95 Champions League points in 2006-07 (with Liverpool making the finals), 103 in 2007-08 (United over Chelsea) and 94 in 2008-09 (three semifinalists), then slowly fell into a slump before rallying in 2017-18 (94 total points) and 2018-19 (Liverpool beat Spurs in the final).\n\nMaximum points: 2006-07 (95 Champions League points, Liverpool UCL runners-up), 2007-08 (103 Champions League points, United beats Chelsea in UCL finals), 2008-09 (94 Champions League points, three UCL semi-finalists), 2010-11 (82 Champions League points, United UCL runners-up), 2017-18 (94 Champions League points, Liverpool UCL runners-up), 2018-19 (80 Champions League points, Liverpool beats Tottenham Hotspur in UCL finals, Chelsea beats Arsenal in Europa finals)\n\nMinimum points: 1992-93 (3 Champions League points), 1993-94 (8 Champions League points), 1994-95 (6 Champions League points), 1995-96 (4 Champions League points)\n\nVariety at the top (1-5 points)\n\nI don't think I'm alone in saying that it gets a little old when the same teams are in the top spots every year. This is a massive issue in college football, and despite the presence of quite a few clubs with elite levels of revenue, it's been a problem for the Premier League too. Only once in its 27-year history has the league produced a top five with four teams different than the year before, and it happened right at the start.\n\nIn 1991-92, the last season before the Premier League's formation, Leeds United, Manchester United, Sheffield Wednesday, Arsenal and Manchester City finished first through fifth. In the Premier League's inaugural race, only champion Manchester United remained in the top five, while Aston Villa, Norwich City, Blackburn and QPR (respectively) replaced the other four.\n\nSince then, there's been a turnover of three teams twice (1993-94 and 1995-96), and in five instances (1996-97, 2003-04, 2006-07, 2008-09 and 2010-11), the same five teams populated these five slots in consecutive seasons, albeit not in the same order.\n\nMaximum points: 1992-93\n\nMinimum points: 1996-97, 2003-04, 2006-07, 2008-09, 2010-11\n\nBonus points (up to 4 awarded)\n\nThe goal of this exercise was to provide as much objectivity as possible into what is always a subjective effort, but I still left room to award a few extra points based on context and random, amazing moments.\n\n1993-94: 1 point. Twitter would have gone absolutely overboard as the Everton and Sheffield United relegation matches were undergoing their late explosions. It would have been incredible.\n\n1994-95: 2 points. Not only do you have Blackburn winning a title, but you have them completely collapsing, going through total psychological panic on the final day, and then winning the title all the same.\n\n1998-99: 4 points. No, this Manchester United team wasn't anywhere close to Ferguson's best squads on paper. But the drama of May 1999 earns the maximum number of bonus points all the same.\n\n2003-04: 4 points. Like the 1972 Miami Dolphins in the NFL, the Premier League's only unbeaten team probably wasn't actually its best, but Arsenal's feat still deserves max bonus points.\n\n2004-05: 2 points. Chelsea finds a wealthy benefactor (Roman Abramovich), hires up-and-comer Jose Mourinho and wins its first top-division crown in 50 years. West Brom collapses but escapes the relegation zone by the skin of its teeth on the final day, then Liverpool erases a 3-0 deficit to beat AC Milan in penalties to take the Champions League title. That's a lot. Bonus points!\n\n2005-06: 1 point. A half-point for Middlesbrough (!) reaching the Europa League finals, and a half-point for the final Champions League spot being decided when (A) Arsenal beats Wigan in the final match ever at Highbury and (B) a bunch of Spurs players get food poisoning from bad lasagna and lose to West Ham.\n\n2010-11: 1 point. Four teams entered the final day in danger of relegation. Wolves beat Blackburn and Wigan beat Stoke to survive, while Blackpool lost to Manchester United and fell and Birmingham City -- League Cup champions and Europa League qualifiers! -- lost to Spurs and did the same. There's enough anxiety there to warrant an extra point.\n\n2011-12: 4 points. Maybe the greatest five minutes in the history of club soccer? Maximum bonus points.\n\n2012-13: 1 point. Arsenal once again steal Spurs' Champions League spot, this time with a win over Newcastle instead of a bad lasagna. Repetition = comedy and a bonus point.\n\n2015-16: 4 points. In a vacuum, the season seemed pretty dull. None of the league's Big Six financial powerhouses had its act together, and Leicester City rolled to the title despite the sixth-worst point total and worst goal differential of any Premier League champion. Plus, only one Premier League team each made the quarterfinals in either the Champions League or Europa League. (Jurgen Klopp's first Liverpool team did make the Europa League final, thanks in part to a thunderous comeback against his old club, Borussia Dortmund, but that was just about the only memorable thing of the European campaign.)\n\nAll of the above is true. But ... LEICESTER CITY WON THE DAMN PREMIER LEAGUE. IN THE SUPERPOWER ERA. That's maybe the most memorable single feat in the Premier League era, and I was tempted to violate my own rubric and award it 10 bonus points. But we'll stick with four.\n\nThe final tally\n\nAfter this long exercise, we get the following point totals when it comes to the best Premier League seasons. (Editor's Note: Not all data is shown but this is the top tier according to Bill's rankings.)\n\nBefore bonus points, three seasons stood out from the pack: 2007-08, 2011-12 and 2018-19. Because of \"AGUEERRRROOOOOOOO,\" 2011-12 takes the prize.\n\nEvaluating 2019-20: Where would this season fit?\n\nAs things stand, the 2019-20 season will get five points for the quality of its champion, four or five points for its runner-up, one point for a dud of a title race and three points for its variety, as it looks like there will be two new teams in the top five.\n\nThat leaves the relegation fight, European success and the potential for bonus points still to be determined.\n\nRelegation: This could be a doozy. While 20th-place Norwich City is in dire straits, the Nos. 16-19 teams (Watford, West Ham, AFC Bournemouth and Aston Villa) are within one point of each other, and their respective goal differentials are from minus-18 to minus-23. Two of the four are going to go down. A full three points is possible here.\n\nEurope: Liverpool's upset loss in the Champions League round of 16 hurts the cause for best season ever, and with Spurs already ousted and Chelsea all but eliminated, only Manchester City has a shot at the crown when the competition resumes in August. Still, if City win the UCL and either Manchester United or Wolves win the Europa League, that'll be a solid output of points.\n\nBonus points: After three decades strewn with close calls, the simple fact that Liverpool won the Premier League is worth at least one or two bonus points. If they set the points record -- and they need 15 points from their final seven matches to get the job done -- that's another bonus point.\n\nRight now, my bet is that the season finishes with around 21 points, but 22 is distinctly possible -- good for the second-best season of all time. Not bad for a year in which the title race was basically over in December."
