Thanks for your company – goodnight!\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 22.47 CET\n\nStill want more? Bet you do.\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nFull time: Aston Villa 1-3 Liverpool\n\nPeep peep! Liverpool move back up to sixth after winning a highly entertaining game at Villa Park. Mo Salah, Virgil van Dijk and the teenager Stefan Bajcetic got the goals, with Ollie Watkins replying for Villa.\n\nThe highlight was Trent Alexander-Arnold’s outrageous pass which led to the first goal, but both teams played some good stuff and created numerous chances.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 20.28 CET\n\n90 min Robertson’s corner is too close to Olsen. There will be four minutes of added time.\n\nShare\n\n89 min Doak nutmegs Digne with a gorgeous dummy, then runs at Mings to win a corner.\n\nShare\n\n87 min: Liverpool substitution The exciting Scottish teenager Ben Doak is coming on for his Premier League debut. He replaces the flawed but irrepressible Darwin Nunez, who played a big part in the third goal.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 20.21 CET\n\n87 min “Nunez does seem like a strange mix of chaotic, imposing, energetic, occasionally brilliant, and sometimes baffling,” says Peter Oh. “I see a dash of early Andy Cole, yes, plus a teaspoon of Wout Weghorst, a tablespoon of Marko Arnautovic, one cup Miroslav Klose and a pinch of Andy Carroll.”\n\nShare\n\n86 min: Triple substitution for Villa Danny Ings, Philippe Coutinho and Leander Dendoncker replace Kamara, Buendia and Bailey.\n\nShare\n\n84 min Young’s attempted clearance hits Robertson and rebounds towards goal, forcing Olsen to plunge to his right to make the save.\n\nShare\n\n82 min Nunez’s shot on the run is pushed away to his right by the diving Olsen. He is flawed, no doubt, but he’s absolutely relentless.\n\nShare\n\nThe relentless Nunez did superbly to chase his own heavy first touch and keep the ball in play near the byline. His cross was palmed away by Olsen to Bajcetic, who calmly dinked the ball over Olsen and rattled it through the legs of Mings on the line. He took that with such composure.\n\nShare\n\nGOAL! Aston Villa 1-3 Liverpool (Bajcetic 81)\n\nWhat a lovely goal from the teenager Stefan Bajcetic!\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 20.23 CET\n\n78 min: Double substitution for Liverpool Joe Gomez and Stefan Bajcetic replace Jordan Henderson and Trent Alexander-Arnold.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 20.12 CET\n\n77 min Digne’s deep cross just evades the diving Bailey, who is then accidentally caught on the side of the head by Robertson’s studs. There’s a break in play while he receives treatment.\n\nShare\n\n76 min “Nunez!!!!!” says Jeff Sachs. “Rob, this guy is a .....”\n\nI’m reserving judgement until this time next season. I think he’s got something about him.\n\nShare\n\n75 min: Nunez misses a great chance! Salah, deep in his own half, puts Nunez through on goal with a beautifully precise pass. Nunez runs half the length of the field, away from Konsa, but then shoots wide of the far post with his left foot.\n\nShare\n\n75 min Even if Villa lose, Unai Emery should be encouraged by a vibrant attacking performance, particularly in the second half. They’ve looked pretty, pretty good.\n\nShare\n\n74 min Watkins goes over in the area after a shoulder charge from Matip. The referee Paul Tierney decides it’s a fair challenge.\n\nShare\n\n73 min Alisson mistimes a punch past his own left-hand post, under pressure from Watkins. The referee gives a foul against Watkins. It looked a bit soft but was probably fair enough.\n\nShare\n\n70 min “Looking at Darwin’s shirt number,” begins Peter Oh, “I wonder how prolific Liverpool’s previous No27 Divock Origi would have been if had enjoyed similar amounts of playing time.”\n\nHad those minutes been as sub, he’d have scored 424 goals, all against Everton.\n\nShare\n\n69 min Liverpool were rocking for a while after Watkins’ goal but they’ve calmed things down a bit now. I’m surprised Villa haven’t brought on Danny Ings yet.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 20.01 CET\n\n67 min Elliott is playing on the left of the attack, which is a fairly unusual position for him.\n\nShare\n\n66 min: Double substitution for Liverpool Harvey Elliott and Naby Keita replace Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Thiago.\n\nShare\n\n64 min Lots of Villa pressure now, with Robertson and then Van Dijk making important interceptions in the space of 10 seconds.\n\nShare\n\n61 min Villa break four on four, and McGinn’s stinging shot from 20 yards is well blocked by Henderson.\n\nShare\n\nVilla deserve that for a much-improved performance in the second half. Douglas Luiz, 30 yards from goal in the inside-right channel, curled a beautiful cross to the far post, where Watkins pulled away from Matip and strained his neck muscles to plant an excellent header back across Alisson. That’s a really good goal.\n\nShare\n\nGOAL! Aston Villa 1-2 Liverpool (Watkins 59)\n\nNow then.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 20.03 CET\n\n58 min Digne’s cross is dummied by Watkins and then mishit by Bailey, unmarked 15 yards out. That’s the second time tonight that he hasn’t connected properly with a decent chance.\n\nShare\n\n56 min Buendia plays a good pass down the right to Bailey, who can’t decide whether to shoot or cross towards Watkins, and does neither.\n\nShare\n\n56 min “In Suarez’s first full season at Liverpool, he broke the record for the number of times he hit the post,” says Matt Dony. “It was the season after that he really took flight and flourished. So far this year, Nunez has hit the woodwork more than anyone else in the league. Next year, Norwich had better look out…”\n\nShare\n\n54 min Erm, Amazon Prime are now telling me the event (sic) is over, and all we’re seeing is a … oh never mind, the live pictures are back now, just in time to see Alisson make a comfortable save from Digne.\n\nShare\n\n53 min Fabinho, 25 yards out, shapes a nuce curling shot just wide.\n\nShare\n\n52 min “Careful what you say about Cole and Nunez!” says Daniel Sixsmith.\n\nHa. I was a huge fan of Cole (see below) and am only talking about his 1995-96 season really. It was partially a compliment, in that, like Nunez, he never hid, no matter how much he was struggling. And also, like Nunez, his movement was fantastic.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 20.10 CET\n\n51 min: Good save from Olsen! Liverpool break from a Villa free-kick, with Salah scurrying 70 yards into the Villa area. Eventually he hits an off-balance shot that is blocked by the legs of Olsen, with the ball then ricocheting off Douglas Luiz and just wide.\n\nShare\n\n49 min Moments later, Buendia sweeps a first-time shot into the side netting.\n\nShare\n\n48 min: Chance for Villa! McGinn sweeps a long pass out to Digne on the left and hares towards the area. Digne curls a deep cross that finds McGinn unmarked at the far post, but the ball bounces awkwardly and he can’t decide whether to go at it with his head or his left foot. In the end it hits his shoulder and runs through to Alisson.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 19.41 CET\n\n46 min: Watkins has a goal disallowed! Villa thought they had scored after 39 seconds of the second half. Watkins finished confidently after a through ball from Buendia (I think), but the flag went up and replays showed he was just offside.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 19.39 CET\n\n46 min Peep peep! Liverpool begin the second half, with no changes on either side.\n\nShare\n\n“Agree with you about Fowler vs. Villa,” says Edward Ricketts. “Perhaps the only other goals in that category are his brace at Old Trafford in ‘95 - the effortless thunderbolt with little backlift into the top corner, followed by barging Gary Neville out of the way and casually chipping one of the best keepers of all time. The sheer joy of young unfettered talent personified!”\n\nShare\n\n“It’s clear that the other five in Liverpool’s front six (with Robertson and Alexander-Arnold backing them up) are in tune,” says Andy Flintoff, “but Nunez, despite all his energy, is’t quite there yet. It’ll probably come with time, but it’s clear his current role is to be the furthest forward, creating the space for the others to work in.”\n\nShare\n\nHalf-time reading\n\nShare\n\n“I cannot figure out whether Nunez lacks skill or luck, but he has missed so much...” says Jeff Sachs.\n\nHe reminds of Andy Cole in his first few years at Manchester United – misses plenty of chances, and can look very clumsy, but constantly gets in good positions because of his movement and irrepressible attitude. Timo Werner was fairly similar at Chelsea. Either way, he’s great fun to watch because something is always happening.\n\nShare\n\nHalf time: Aston Villa 0-2 Liverpool\n\nLiverpool are on course for a third consecutive league victory after an eventful first half at Villa Park. Mo Salah scored the first after two brilliant passes from Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson, and Virgil van Dijk pinged in the second with the help of a deflection off Ezri Konsa.\n\nThe two-goal margin is about right, though the score could easily be 4-2 or 5-3 to Liverpool.\n\nShare\n\n45+2 min: Chance for Nunez! Alexander-Arnold curls a devastating free-kick from the right that bounces up towards the unmarked Nunez, eight yards out. He rides the bounce well but then hits a first-time shot straight at Olsen.\n\nShare\n\n45+1 min Three minutes of added time.\n\nShare\n\n45 min Looks like it’s Van Dijk’s goal.\n\nShare\n\n45 min Henderson pings a long-range volley straight at Olsen.\n\nShare\n\n44 min Villa created some good chances early on but Liverpool have been more comfortable defensively in the last 10-15 minutes.\n\nShare\n\n42 min We’ve just seen a couple of replays of the second goal, and I don’t think Van Dijk’s original shot was on target. That said, for the time being it has been given to him.\n\nShare\n\n40 min There’s a bit of swagger about Liverpool’s attacking play, and on this form you’d fancy them to comfortably finish in the top four.\n\nShare\n\nAlexander-Arnold’s outswinging corner ricocheted across the area to Salah, back to goal on the left edge of the six-yard box. He laid it off to van Dijk, who hooked a left-footed snapshot that deflected off Konsa (I think) and into the net. That might go down as an own goal in fact.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 19.11 CET\n\nGOAL! Aston Villa 0-2 Liverpool (Van Dijk 37)\n\nAnother right-wing corner, another Liverpool goal.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 19.21 CET\n\n36 min Oxlade-Chamberlain finds Nunez down the left. He cuts inside Konsa and hits a shot that deflects across the face of goal and is taken off the toes of Salah by Mings.\n\nShare\n\n34 min “While my jaw dropped seeing Trent’s outside-of-the-boot pass to Robertson, watching the replays showed that Robbo knew or just expected that pass to be made,” says Neil Mackie. “Like it was just an everyday thing. Trent got the ball and Robbo just hared into the space assuming he would be found. It constantly amazes me what top flight footballers just take for granted.”\n\nShare\n\n32 min “TAA’s playing like he’s trying to prove a point,” says Matt Dony. “Alisson is playing like the last month or so didn’t happen. And Nunez is playing like, well, like he’s been embodied by the concept of chaos personified. Football is great again!”\n\nShare\n\n31 min Henderson curls an excellent first-time pass over Digne to find Salah in the inside-right channel. He teases Mings but then drags a shot wide of the near post.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 19.04 CET\n\n29 min “What a crazy match!” says Joe Pearson. “Difficult to look away to compose a pithy email. Can’t imagine how hard it is to MBM!”\n\nIt could be worse.\n\nShare"
