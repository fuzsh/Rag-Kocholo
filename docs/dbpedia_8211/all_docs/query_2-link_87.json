Please Gamble Responsibly.\n\nThe much-awaited return of the Premier League season is over on August 16th and we‚Äôre in for another year of drama and excitement.\n\nLast season saw the exit of all three newly promoted sides ‚Äì Luton Town, Burnley and Sheffield United ‚Äì it was the first time since the 1997-98 season that all promoted sides were relegated back to the Championship after just one season, but this year‚Äôs pack of 20 teams does exert great strength, unlike what we‚Äôve seen in recent years.\n\nThe newest members of this season‚Äôs Premier League cohort are certainly no strangers to the top-flight, Leicester City and Southampton rejoin after only one season in the Championship, while Ipswich Town make their illustrious return to the league after departing in the 2001/02 season ‚Äì the season prior to their relegation, they actually finished in 5th, ahead of Claudio Ranieri‚Äôs Chelsea.\n\nAt the other end of the table, Mikel Arteta‚Äôs Arsenal faced another heartbreak at the hands of Manchester City, and there was plenty of chaos in and around the top six, including Aston Villa‚Äôs heroic fourth-place finish, Chelsea‚Äôs end of season turnaround and Manchester United‚Äôs worst finish in the Premier League era.\n\nSo, strap in for another eight months of football spectacles, but before then, take a look at our expert‚Äôs Premier League outright predictions which you can follow along with this season.\n\nOur experts have already begun their deep dives for the new season so be sure to check out our Premier League predictions ahead of the start of the season for new pre-season content, like our Premier League top goalscorer picks.\n\nThroughout the 24/25 action, our signature selection of Premier League accumulator tips will be available every week, as well as covering all the other European football action in our football betting tips & predictions, available on the site every day.\n\nIf you want to get yourself ready for the new Premier League season, we have over ¬£500 in free bets available to activate to use over on our free bets page. If it‚Äôs Premier League free bets you‚Äôre after, we‚Äôll be regularly updating you with the latest offers as they come in throughout the season.\n\nThe EFL kicks off a week earlier than the Premier League and we‚Äôve left no stone unturned in the build-up, whether it be: Championship outright predictions, League One outright betting tips, League Two outright tips, Championship Golden Boot tips, League One Top Goalscorer predictions or League Two Golden Boot tips, we‚Äôve got you covered.\n\nüèÜ Premier League Winners Without Man City ‚Äì Arsenal\n\nAfter winning a record-breaking fourth Premier League title in a row, Manchester City are unsurprisingly 2.10 favourites to reign supreme again this season. Pep Guardiola has overseen an unprecedented level of dominance at the Etihad, steering the Blues to six of the last seven top-flight titles.\n\nWhile City are worthy favourites to carry on in that vein, there is a cloud hanging over the club as they are alleged to have breached 115 Premier League charges between 2009 and 2018. A hearing is reportedly set to take place in November of this year, and if found guilty of any wrongdoing, City could face a huge points deduction. As such, backing Man City to win the title as short-priced favourites makes little appeal.\n\nInstead, Arsenal look like an attractive option at 1.80 on bet365 in the outright winner without Man City market. Mikel Arteta‚Äôs men pushed the champions all the way last season, taking the fight for the title to the final day of the season before ultimately finishing just two points behind the Cityzens.\n\nThe Gunners bounced back strongly from a similar setback two seasons ago and they look set to be Man City‚Äôs main challengers again this term. The addition of Riccardo Calafiori has improved an area of weakness and Arteta is also expected to bolster Arsenal‚Äôs attacking options before the summer transfer window shuts.\n\nThe capital club were comfortable second-placed finishers two seasons ago with 84 points and they topped that tally with their total of 89 last term ‚Äì their highest return since Arsene Wenger‚Äôs ‚ÄòInvincibles‚Äô in 2004. What‚Äôs more, with Liverpool set to enter a period of transition under new boss Arne Slot, Arsenal look well placed to top the table when excluding City for the third year running.\n\nüî¥ Arsenal to Win Without Man City\n\n6Ô∏è‚É£ Premier League Top 6 Finish ‚Äì Newcastle\n\nThe race for a coveted top four finish in the Premier League is expected to be as fiercely competitive as ever this season. With Man City and Arsenal expected to fill the top two positions, there could be as many as six other teams fighting it out for Champions League qualification.\n\nLiverpool and Chelsea are next in the betting but both sides will go into the season under new management. Arne Slot has the unenviable task of following in Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs footsteps, so it might be best to take a watching brief during the opening stretch of the season before getting involved with the Reds in the top-four race. As for Chelsea, their trigger-happy approach when it comes to changing managers makes them difficult to trust with any season-long wager.\n\nDespite finishing eighth last season, Manchester United are the 3.0 fifth favourites to finish in the top four. The Red Devils‚Äô FA Cup success saved Erik ten Hag‚Äôs job last season but a slow start to the campaign could spell the end of the Dutchman‚Äôs Old Trafford tenure.\n\nElsewhere, both Aston Villa and Tottenham could struggle to replicate last season‚Äôs respective top-four pushes given the demands that Champions League and Europa League football will place on the pair.\n\nNewcastle, on the other hand, won‚Äôt have to worry about juggling Premier League and European commitments this season, making them an appealing prospect for a top-six finish at 1.83 on Sky Bet. There‚Äôs a strong spine to Eddie Howe‚Äôs side and their domestic record at St James‚Äô Park in recent seasons makes for very impressive reading.\n\nThere was no fluke about the Toon Army‚Äôs top-four tilt two seasons ago and they appear to have more going for them than several of their competitors in the race for European football.\n\n6Ô∏è‚É£ Newcastle to Finish in The Top 6\n\n‚ùå Premier League Without The Big 7 ‚Äì Aston Villa\n\nUnder the astute guidance of Unai Emery, Aston Villa finished in the top four of the Premier League for the first time since 1995/96 last season. As such, the Villans will embark on a Champions League adventure for the first time in over 40 years later this autumn. Given that they will be dining at Europe‚Äôs top table this term, Villa have a big task on their hands repeating their top-four heroics this time around.\n\nWhile another fourth-placed finish could be a bridge too far, Villa do merit strong consideration at 2.0 on Sky Bet in the ‚Äòwithout the Big 7‚Äô market. Villa will relish their opportunity to participate in the new-look Champions League this season but Emery will be equally keen for his side to maintain their domestic progress.\n\nWhat‚Äôs more, the Villa boss is assembling a squad that looks to have enough quality to fight on all fronts. The signings of defender Ian Maatsen and playmaker Ross Barkley have gone a little under the radar, while midfielder Amadou Onana should be an ideal replacement for Douglas Luiz.\n\nConsequently, there is plenty of scope for Villa to develop further under Emery, making them an attractive proposition in the without the Big 7 betting. The likes of Brighton, Crystal Palace and West Ham are the sides deemed most likely to outperform Villa in this particular market, but none of the aforementioned trio look sufficiently equipped to place higher than the Villans.\n\nEmery‚Äôs side are a well oiled machine and they also boast a formidable home record in the Premier League under his tutorship. Another top-eight finish under Emery should be well within reach for Villa and that should be enough to see them take top honours when excluding the so-called big seven.\n\nü¶Å Aston Villa Without The Big 7\n\nüìà Premier League Top 10 Finish ‚Äì West Ham\n\nJulen Lopetegui‚Äôs appointment heralds a new era for West Ham United and the Spaniard arrives in East London with some big shoes to fill. While David Moyes divided opinion among the Hammers‚Äô supporters, he did deliver their first major trophy in 43 years. On top of that, the Scotsman also steered the club to three top half finishes across his final four season‚Äôs in charge.\n\nWest Ham are 1.80 on bet365 to secure another top-10 berth this season and that holds plenty of appeal. Lopetegui has inherited a relatively settled squad that contains several talented individuals.\n\nWhat‚Äôs more, West Ham have managed to hold on to all of their key players thus far, not to mention they have made some notable additions in the shape of Luis Guilherme, Crysencio Summerville and Max Kilman. New boss Lopetegui is a very astute operator and he is still actively looking to reinforce his squad\n\nWhile West Ham have thrived on their European adventures in recent years, their domestic form is likely to benefit from no continental commitments this term. Admittedly, the jury is still out on Lopetegui as far as managing in the Premier League is concerned, though he did impress during his brief spell at Wolves, guiding the Molineux club to a final position of 13th having taken over when they were rock-bottom.\n\nThe 57-year-old also carried out some stellar work at Sevilla, securing three successive top-four finishes as well as winning the Europa League. Lopetegui‚Äôs sides are renowned for being solid rather than spectacular but that could be just the tonic for a West Ham team that shipped goals at an alarming rate last season.\n\nIf they can tighten up defensively and continue to produce a regular goal threat, the Hammers look worth supporting for yet another top half finish.\n\n‚öíÔ∏è West Ham to Finish in The Top 10\n\n‚¨áÔ∏è Premier League Relegation ‚Äì Leicester City\n\nLeicester City are back in the top-flight after winning the English Championship at the first time of asking but they face a big task to stay up. Just weeks after guiding the Foxes back to the Premier League, manager Enzo Maresca departed the King Power to take the reins at Chelsea. To make matters worse, the Italian quickly raided his now former club for midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, who was the standout performer for Leicester during last season‚Äôs promotion-winning campaign.\n\nLeicester have since moved to appoint former Nottingham Forest boss Steve Cooper as their new manager on a three-year deal. While the Welshman will provide the Foxes with Premier League experience, it would be fair to say that he will have his work cut out steering them to safety.\n\nIt is looking increasingly likely that Leicester will be hit with a points deduction either before or during the forthcoming season for allegedly breaching financial regulations. On top of this, it has been widely reported that the Foxes could be facing a more severe points penalty than that of which both Everton and Nottingham Forest received last season.\n\nEven if they are to avoid a potential points deficit, the Foxes face a massive task to ensure they are not making a quickfire return to the second tier. Cooper‚Äôs hands are tied financially and beating the drop may prove beyond him and this current Leicester side without some serious surgery.\n\nFurthermore, former Forest boss Cooper is also faced with the challenge of getting the Foxes faithful onside, meaning things could turn toxic pretty quickly at the King Power. With all things considered, Leicester look good value to go down at 1.50 on Sky Bet.\n\nü¶ä Leicester City to be relegated\n\n* All odds displayed correct at the time of publishing *\n\n18+ please gamble responsibly."
