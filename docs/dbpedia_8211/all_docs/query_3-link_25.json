        "text": "Liverpool host Arsenal in the Premier League game of the season so far as the two teams battle to be top of the table on Christmas Day.\n\nThe Reds and the Gunners are separated by just a point at the summit and will each look to put down a marker during the festive period.\n\nBoth Jurgen Klopp and Mikel Arteta will be desperate to set a gap to Manchester City, whose Club World Cup commitments mean they won't be in action this weekend.\n\nLiverpool surrendered their advantage to Arsenal at the top by being held to a 0-0 draw with Manchester United last time out.\n\nHowever, the north Londoners famously have a torrid record at Anfield, having not beaten Liverpool on their own patch since 2012.\n\nLiverpool vs Arsenal: Trent vs Martinelli\n\nOne of the Premier League's best one-on-one duels will be revisited during this top-of-the-table clash.\n\nLiverpool's key creative force Trent Alexander-Arnold will face his biggest test of the season in Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli.\n\nThe Brazilian has scored more goals against Liverpool for Arsenal than he has any other opponent (4).\n\nMartinelli took full advantage of Liverpool and particularly Alexander-Arnold's struggles last season by scoring and assisting in both of the Gunners’ Premier League games against the Reds.\n\nMost read in Football\n\nHowever, their meeting at Anfield in April proved a catalyst for a dramatic shift in form for both players.\n\nWith Martinelli inspiring Arsenal into a 2-0 lead, Klopp decided to invert Alexander-Arnold into midfield for the first time.\n\nAnd the change was a dramatic one, as Alexander-Arnold notched an assist for Roberto Firmino's late equaliser that ultimately sparked a period of poor form that led to Arsenal's title collapse.\n\nThe cross was Alexander-Arnold's sixth Premier League assist against Arsenal - more than he does against any other opponent - as well as his fifth at Anfield.\n\nLiverpool have since not lost a Premier League game that Alexander-Arnold has started having played as an inverted right-back ever since.\n\nThe pair now come into this weekend's fixture with their form reversed, with Alexander-Arnold boasting as many goals and assists as Martinelli.\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold has six Premier League assists against Arsenal, more than he does against any other opponent, with five of those coming at Anfield. Indeed, only Steven Gerrard (7) has more assists against the Gunners in Premier League history.\n\nGabriel Martinelli has scored more goals against Liverpool for Arsenal than he has any other opponent (4). He both scored and assisted in both of the Gunners’ Premier League games against the Reds last season.\n\nLiverpool vs Arsenal: What has been said?\n\nAlexander-Arnold, speaking about his performance in the 2-2 draw, said: \"The goals have to come on one of the sides or through the middle, so that's the way football works.\n\n\"You're against a quality player, Martinelli, and their attacking line is quality all over – like the team, who are full of quality.\n\n\"They're bound to be threats and they've got the goal. But we stayed in the game and we tried to put pressure on, especially late on in the second half.\n\n\"We missed a pen as well – I forgot about that, that was a big moment – but we stayed in it and got it late. It's just the fight that we have really.\"\n\nIn his career in English football, Arsenal forward Gabriel Jesus has only been involved in more goals in all competitions against Watford (12) than he has against Liverpool (9 – 6 goals, 3 assists). He’s either scored (1) or assisted (2) on each of his last three visits to Anfield, netting Arsenal’s second goal in their 2-2 draw last season.\n\nLiverpool have had more shots (314) than any other Premier League side this season, while only Newcastle (35.2) have a higher xG than the Reds (35). However, Arsenal have faced the fewest shots on target (43) and have the lowest xG against (13) in the competition this term.\n\nArsenal have won 24 of their 39 Premier League matches in 2023 (D8 L7). They won 25 in 2022 and are looking to win 25+ league games in consecutive calendar years for the first time in their history.\n\nLiverpool vs Arsenal: Teams\n\nLiverpool: Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Konate, Van Dijk, Tsimikas, Endo, Szoboszlai, Jones, Salah, Diaz, Gakpo\n\nSubs: Kelleher, Gomez, Nunez, Elliott, Gravenberch, Clark, McConnell, Quansah, Bradley\n\nArsenal: Raya, White, Saliba, Gabriel, Zinchenko, Rice, Havertz, Odegaard, Saka, Jesus, Martinelli\n\nSubs: Ramsdale, Smith Rowe, Nketiah, Kiwior, Soares, Trossard, Nelson, Elneny, Jorginho\n\nLiverpool drew 0-0 with Manchester United last time out, despite having 34 shots in the match. This ended their run of scoring in 26 consecutive Premier League games, while they haven’t failed to score in consecutive home league games since February/March 2021 (a run of three).\n\nThis will be the seventh time Arsenal and Liverpool have met in their final Premier League game before Christmas, the most played such fixture in the competition’s history. The Reds won the first two such games (3-1 in 1995-96, 4-0 in 2000-01), the Gunners the next one (2-1 in 2001-02), with the last three all ending level (1-1 in 2008-09, 2-2 in 2014-15 and 3-3 in 2017-18).\n\nLiverpool vs Arsenal: How to follow\n\nThis Premier League clash will take place on Saturday, December 23.\n\nKick-off at Anfield is scheduled for 5:30pm.\n\nThe game will be broadcast live on Sky Sports Main Event and Sky Sports Premier League.\n\ntalkSPORT will also have live updates throughout the evening, while talkSPORT.com will have the best of the reaction as well.\n\nThis is Liverpool’s 100th home game against Arsenal in league competition, just the second side to visit the Reds as many times after Everton (105). Liverpool have only won more league games against Aston Villa (59) and Newcastle (58) than against the Gunners (55), though only Manchester United (25) have won more visits than Arsenal (24).\n\nArsenal haven’t kept a clean sheet in any of their last 15 Premier League matches against Liverpool, shipping 43 goals. Since the start of that run (a 0-0 draw in August 2015), that is the most goals they have shipped against an opponent."
