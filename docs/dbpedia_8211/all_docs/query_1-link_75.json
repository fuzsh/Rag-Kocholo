        "text": "Premier League thoroughbreds and deserved champions. Brilliantly managed by Antonio Conte in his first season at the club - addressed early failings with tactical acumen, repaired a broken squad and got Chelsea's best players playing again.\n\nMcNulty's pre-season prediction: 3rd\n\nWhat he said: \"This squad and team is so much better than it showed last season. Expect Conte, who will not suffer fools or any political manoeuvring in the dressing room, to flourish.\"\n\nManagerial mark: Antonio Conte - 9/10\n\nStat: Chelsea are the first side to win 30 games in a single Premier League season.\n\nRead more: How Conte turned Chelsea into champions\n\nNearly, but not quite after another season of progress for Mauricio Pochettino's emerging young team.\n\nSpurs have an outstanding core of young, English players.\n\nIf they can keep them together, add to the squad, and find a way to win at Wembley then a trophy will surely come soon. But they now need to win something.\n\nMcNulty's pre-season prediction: 5th\n\nWhat he said: \"Tough call this one as Pochettino's side were excellent last season and were right in the title shake-up for so long. In reality, you could throw a blanket over the likes of Chelsea, Spurs, Liverpool and Arsenal in the battle for top-four places.\"\n\nManagerial mark: Mauricio Pochettino - 7/10.\n\nStat: Tottenham scored more goals and conceded fewer than any other team in the Premier League, beating champions Chelsea's goal difference by eight.\n\nNo escaping the tinge of disappointment to Pep Guardiola's first season at Manchester City.\n\nNo trophies, out in the last 16 of the Champions League, and top four in the Premier League was the minimum requirement.\n\nNot found it as easy a transition as at Barcelona and Bayern Munich. Defensive and goalkeeping flaws to fix but Gabriel Jesus could be a superstar next season.\n\nMcNulty's pre-season prediction: 1st\n\nWhat he said: \"Now City have signed John Stones, responsibility will lie with him for curing defensive ills caused by poor form of Eliaquim Mangala and Nicolas Otamendi, as well as captain Vincent Kompany's injuries. I'm backing a Guardiola-inspired City to reclaim the title.\"\n\nManagerial mark: Pep Guardiola - 6/10.\n\nStat: Manchester City have finished in the top four for seven successive seasons, the longest active streak of any club in the Premier League after Arsenal's failure this season.\n\nThe return of Champions League football means Liverpool can count this season as progress and success - although manager Jurgen Klopp should not escape criticism for tame exits to Southampton in the Capital One Cup semi-final and at home to Championship strugglers Wolves with a weakened side in the FA Cup.\n\nNot as sparkling in the second half of the season and no trophies, but a sense of a club going in the right direction.\n\nMcNulty's pre-season prediction: 6th\n\nWhat he said: \"The biggest plus will be that Klopp now has the squad he wants. First title since 1990? No - but a good bet for a cup.\"\n\nManagerial mark: Jurgen Klopp - 7/10.\n\nStat: Liverpool have finished in the top four of the Premier League for only the second time in the past eight seasons.\n\nArsene Wenger's toughest season at Arsenal. Plenty of supporter unrest - and most significantly no Champions League football for the first time in 20 years. Seismic moment for the club after a poor season. Even if Wenger stays, something has to change - and that applies even if Arsenal win the FA Cup.\n\nMcNulty's pre-season prediction: 4th\n\nWhat he said: \"Fourth-place prediction... but with doubts and with fingers crossed.\"\n\nManagerial mark: Arsene Wenger - 5/10\n\nStat: Arsenal have finished the season outside of the top four for the first time since the 1995-96 campaign, when they finished fifth under Bruce Rioch.\n\nStodgy first season for Jose Mourinho at Old Trafford - but still the possibility of it being rated a real success if they win the Europa League and secure Champions League football on top of winning the EFL Cup.\n\nToo many draws at Old Trafford and too many cautious away displays at close rivals. Still very much a Mourinho work in progress and league form must improve next season.\n\nMcNulty's pre-season prediction: 2nd\n\nWhat he said: \"Where will Wayne Rooney fit into Mourinho's grand plan? And what about United's defence? How will Â£30m Eric Bailly from Villarreal adapt to the Premier League? Despite this, expect United to be back in the title shake-up.\"\n\nManagerial mark: Jose Mourinho - 6/10.\n\nStat: Manchester United never finished lower than third in the Premier League under Sir Alex Ferguson, but have now ended seventh, fourth, fifth and sixth in the past four seasons.\n\nGenuine season of progress under manager Ronald Koeman - European football is back at Everton and Goodison Park is a fortress once more. Doubts must be resolved over the future of Romelu Lukaku and Ross Barkley but talk of high ambition in the transfer market this summer is more cause for optimism.\n\nMcNulty's pre-season prediction: 9th\n\nWhat he said: \"Koeman is a shrewd and ruthless operator. It should also be remembered he inherited a debacle from predecessor Roberto Martinez.\"\n\nManagerial mark: Ronald Koeman - 7/10.\n\nStat: Everton won 43 points at Goodison Park in the Premier League this season, their most in a top-flight campaign at home since 1989-90 (45).\n\nSolid if unspectacular from the Saints, although deservedly reached Wembley and were on the rough end of poor decisions when losing to Manchester United in the EFL Cup final.\n\nManager Claude Puel was a low-key figure and occasionally unconvincing but forward Manolo Gabbiadini looks a good signing. Can they keep defender Virgil van Dijk? And will Puel even stay? Can they realistically expect to be doing better?\n\nMcNulty's pre-season prediction: 12th\n\nWhat he said: \"Expect another solid season but not another top six.\"\n\nManagerial mark: Claude Puel - 6/10\n\nStat: Southampton have the second-youngest starting XIs in the league behind Tottenham, with an average of 26 years 169 days old\n\nAnother excellent season under manager Eddie Howe. This is dreamland for the Cherries - not just in the Premier League but stabilised in it by playing attractive, attacking football. An outstanding achievement by Bournemouth.\n\nMcNulty's pre-season prediction: 16th\n\nWhat he said: \"The reality is that Premier League status is success in itself for Bournemouth.\"\n\nManagerial mark: Eddie Howe - 7/10\n\nStat: Eleven different English players have made 20 or more Premier League appearances for Bournemouth this season. The last Premier League team to do this were Aston Villa in 2000-01.\n\nThe Baggies may have tailed off towards the end of the season but this was still a good term with underrated manager Tony Pulis at the helm. Consolidated in the Premier League - so will the new Chinese owners show ambition to try to break the glass ceiling?\n\nMcNulty's pre-season prediction: 14th\n\nWhat he said: \"If stability and Premier League status is what is required then expect Pulis to deliver again, but there was not much to excite at The Hawthorns last season.\"\n\nManagerial mark: Tony Pulis - 6/10\n\nStat: West Brom scored 48.8% of their goals from set-pieces this season, the highest proportion of any team in the Premier League.\n\nPoor first season at London Stadium. Doesn't feel like home after Upton Park but an even bigger problem has been those playing in it. Yes, manager Slaven Bilic's plans were derailed by forward Dimitri Payet downing tools but recruitment was desperately poor. Has to improve this summer.\n\nMcNulty's pre-season prediction: 7th\n\nWhat he said: \"West Ham's biggest challenge may be settling into new surroundings at London Stadium. Yes, they will be watched by bigger crowds and the environment may be more luxurious, but Upton Park had an atmosphere that could win points.\"\n\nManagerial mark: Slaven Bilic - 5/10\n\nStat: West Ham, along with Bournemouth, lost 22 points from winning positions, the highest total in the Premier League.\n\nWhat a two-faced season for last season's champions - so poor under Claudio Ranieri that he was sacked just nine months after leading them to the title. But the Foxes were the Premier League's last men standing in the Champions League before losing to Atletico Madrid in the quarter-final. Transformed under Craig Shakespeare - but where exactly were these players for six months of the season?\n\nMcNulty's pre-season prediction: 8th\n\nWhat he said: \"I do not expect another run at the Premier League but there is good reason to believe momentum and confidence gained from one of the greatest sporting stories ever told will lead to another very good campaign.\"\n\nManagerial mark: Claudio Ranieri - 5/10; Craig Shakespeare - 7/10\n\nStat: Leicester completed 70.1% of passes, only Burnley managed less.\n\nSam Allardyce did what he does best - recovering from his humbling exit as England manager after only 67 days and one game to guide Crystal Palace to safety after taking over from the sacked Alan Pardew with the Eagles 17th, one point above the relegation zone and with only one win in 11 games.\n\nHe took a while to get going but big wins at Chelsea and Liverpool and at home to Arsenal showed 'Big Sam' still had the touch.\n\nMcNulty's pre-season prediction: 11th\n\nWhat he said: \"Do not expect any relegation fears but a comfortable mid-table finish.\"\n\nManagerial mark: Alan Pardew - 3/10; Sam Allardyce - 7/10\n\nStat: Crystal Palace took just six points from eight London derbies this season\n\nThree managers in one season is a recipe for trouble but it was third time lucky as the calm approach of Paul Clement guided them to safety with a game to spare after Francesco Guidolin's struggles and Bob Bradley's 85-day reign.\n\nA season full of anxiety, though, and leaned heavily on the goals and guile of two players who will be in demand this summer - striker Fernando Llorente and playmaker Gylfi Sigurdsson.\n\nMcNulty's pre-season prediction: 15th\n\nWhat he said: \"Expect a solid, if unspectacular, season.\"\n\nManagerial mark: Francesco Guidolin - 4/10; Bob Bradley - 3/10; Paul Clement - 7/10\n\nStat: Swansea conceded 70 goals. Only two teams have conceded more in a 38-game Premier League season and survived relegation - Wigan in 2009-10 (79) and West Brom in 2010-11 (71).\n\nBurnley's success is staying up and it has been job done for manager Sean Dyche. He was worked his resources superbly and a formidable home record - not to mention some real talent such as keeper Tom Heaton and defender Michael Keane - have been at the heart of their survival.\n\nMcNulty's pre-season prediction: 19th\n\nWhat he said: \"It will be a long hard season but perhaps, helped by the atmospheric surroundings of Turf Moor and the excellence of Dyche, Burnley can make this forecast go astray.\"\n\nManagerial mark: Sean Dyche - 7/10\n\nStat: Burnley beat Liverpool in August despite having only 19.6% of possession, the lowest by a winning side in the Premier League since 2006-07.\n\nAnother season. Another one-season manager in the departing Walter Mazzarri. Another Premier League survival. Not everybody's model of how to run a football club but it keeps Watford up and that is what matters. How long will it work?\n\nMcNulty's pre-season prediction: 18th\n\nWhat he said: \"It will be a dogfight near the bottom. Can the Hornets survive? I'm not sure they can.\"\n\nManagerial mark: Walter Mazzarri - 6/10\n\nStat: Jose Holebas was shown 14 yellow cards, equalling the Premier League record for a player in a single campaign.\n\nDoomed from the start as manager Mike Phelan was operating with barely a squad and his hands tied. Marco Silva's arrival galvanised the Tigers but he could not replicate excellent home form on Hull City's travels. So it is back to the Championship - in all probability without their excellent manager.\n\nMcNulty's pre-season prediction: 20th\n\nWhat he said: \"Long, hard season ahead and the signs do not look good.\"\n\nManagerial mark: Mike Phelan - 4/10; Marco Silva - 6/10\n\nStat: Because of their opening-day victory against Leicester City, Hull City spent one more day on top of the Premier League than Tottenham Hotspur did in 2016-17 (0).\n\nMiddlesbrough simply came and went without contributing much to the Premier League - not bold enough, not enough goals. It is a shame and they may well wonder if they could have had more of a go. Plus points? Squad looks in decent shape to come straight back up and they still have chairman Steve Gibson.\n\nMcNulty's pre-season prediction: 17th\n\nWhat he said: \"This season is about consolidation.\"\n\nManagerial mark: Aitor Karanka - 5/10; Steve Agnew - 4/10\n\nStat: Middlesbrough were 14th in the Premier League on Christmas Day, but were the 12th side to be that high in the Premier League table on 25 December and still be relegated that season.\n\nSunderland and manager David Moyes got exactly what they deserved after an appalling season. Moyes killed any optimism by announcing the Black Cats would be in a relegation fight after only his second game - one of the few things the beleaguered Scot got right this season.\n\nWill now lose best players Jordan Pickford and Jermain Defoe and no-one would be confident about them coming back up from the Championship.\n\nMcNulty's pre-season prediction: 13th\n\nWhat he said: \"Moyes will have the Black Cats well-drilled and hard to beat.\"\n\nManagerial mark: David Moyes - 3/10\n\nStat: Jermain Defoe scored 15 goals for Sunderland, 51.7% of their team total."
