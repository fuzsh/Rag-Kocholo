        "text": "The fresh strip for next season is a modern take on the 1995-96 away shirt, when Ian Rush was club captain and the supremely talented Robbie Fowler was top goalscorer.\n\nPre-order the 2023-24 away kit now at our online store (UK and internationally) and the LFC Store app for delivery from launch day on July 7\n\nThe jersey features the green and white quarter pattern with black collar and cuff, updated with a digital effect treatment layering tonal greens – green spark, poison green and pine green – for a modern twist.\n\nThe kit is finished with black shorts, black name and number, and white socks with a black and green trim.\n\nThe 97 emblem encased by the Eternal Flames sits proudly at the nape of the neck in memory of the children, women and men who were unlawfully killed as a result of the Hillsborough disaster.\n\nThe away launch campaign fast forwards two decades from the ’70s-inspired home kit to the ’90s for the new away kit.\n\nIt was a time when computers were starting to take over the workplace, mobile phones became widespread, and the internet arrived at people’s home. Images and the video reflect the changing technology of the time in another fun and energetic launch film also set in a photo booth, rewinding the current squads back to the 1990s.\n\nThe soundtrack is a ’90s-inspired house track The Get Down, by LFC supporter Jamie Unknown.\n\nA host of players from the men’s and women’s teams feature and there’s even an appearance from Jürgen Klopp and Fowler, who are both wearing the brand-new away anthem jacket.\n\nFowler said: “I have fond memories of the 1995-96 season because of the iconic white and green away strip and for scoring my most goals in one season. I’m a huge fan of the new fresh take on the white and green away kit.”\n\nPre-order the 2023-24 away kit now at our online store (UK and internationally) and the LFC Store app for delivery from launch day on July 7\n\nThe men’s team will debut this kit against Leicester City during the pre-season tour in Singapore, while the women’s team will also debut it during their pre-season matches in late August.\n\nBoth stadium and match jerseys have Nike’s Dri-FIT technology to help stay cool during intense games or training sessions.\n\nIn line with LFC’s The Red Way sustainability programme, the Nike kit is sustainably made, with on-pitch and replica jerseys constructed with 100 per cent recycled polyester fabric, which is made from recycled plastic bottles.\n\nPlastic bottles are collected, cleaned and melted down to produce a high-quality yarn for manufacturing and is part of Nike’s wider Move to Zero initiative, with football apparel leading the way in sustainability.\n\nThe club’s name and number style for the back of shirt takes inspiration from the city, with a contemporary take on Liverpool’s historic street signs. The product is printed with water-based inks as a more sustainable option and will be worn for cup competitions and friendlies.\n\nThe away kit will be available in men’s, women’s and junior sizes, and in a match and stadium version. Jerseys can also be personalised with the brand-new Premier League name and number. At launch, current squad lists will be used to print on the new away jersey during the pre-order and launch phase. The full 2023-24 squad lists will be confirmed ahead of the new season. Full T&Cs on shirt printing are available here.\n\nAs with previous seasons, the club is offering a 10 per cent discount off the price of the new kits to all LFC Official Members and season ticket holders. This is also available for UK key workers via Blue Light and Network and students via Student Beans. More information on eligibility and how to redeem the discount can be found here.\n\nThe club’s away pre-match jersey and anthem jacket are also available to pre-order from today, with the full mainline training and lifestyle collection on sale on July 7.\n\nPre-order the 2023-24 away kit now at our online store (UK and internationally) and the LFC Store app for delivery from launch day on July 7"
