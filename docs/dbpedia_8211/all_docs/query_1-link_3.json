The club was founded in 1874 and have played at their current home ground, Villa Park, since 1897. Aston Villa were founder members of The Football League in 1888. They were also founder members of the Premier League in 1992. The club was floated by the previous owner and chairman Doug Ellis, but in 2006 full control of the club was acquired by Randy Lerner. They are one of the oldest and most successful football clubs in England, having won the First Division Championship seven times and the FA Cup seven times. Villa also won the 1981â€“82 European Cup, one of only four English clubs to win what is now the UEFA Champions League. Aston Villa has the fourth highest total of major honours won by an English club. They have a fierce rivalry with local rivals Birmingham City. The Second City derby between Aston Villa and Birmingham City has been played since 1879. The club's traditional kit colours are claret shirts with sky blue sleeves, white shorts and sky blue socks. Their traditional crest is of a rampant gold lion on a light blue background with the club's motto \"Prepared\" underneath; a modified version of this was adopted in 2007.\n\nCurrent squads[]\n\nFirst Team Squad[]\n\nPlayers in on loan[]\n\nPlayers out on loan[]\n\nReserve Squad[]\n\nAcademy[]\n\nManagement and coaching staff[]\n\nCurrent coaching staff[]\n\nClub alumni[]\n\nFormer players[]\n\nManagers[]\n\nClub honours[]\n\nDomestic league[]\n\nDomestic cup[]\n\nEuropean competition[]\n\nReferances[]\n\n[]"
