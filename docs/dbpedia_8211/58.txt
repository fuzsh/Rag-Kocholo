At the spearhead of Roy Evans' swashbuckling Liverpool team of the mid-1990s, the striker nicknamed 'God' blasted 36 goals during the 1995-96 campaign - his personal best for a single season with the Reds.

Two of those strikes arrived in the opening eight minutes of a hugely impressive victory over Villa on March 3, 1996, with opposing defender and former Red Steve Staunton the victim of one particularly outrageous piece of Fowler skill.
