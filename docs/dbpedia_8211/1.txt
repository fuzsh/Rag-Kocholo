The club's first success in the prestigious youth competition came in the 1995-96 season when a team featuring Jamie Carragher and Michael Owen defeated West Ham United 4-1 on aggregate in the final.

Back-to-back successes then followed in 2006 and 2007, with the Reds beating Manchester City and Manchester United in two-legged showpieces.

After finishing runners-up in 2009, Liverpool would get their hands on the trophy again in the 2018-19 campaign.

A late Bobby Duncan goal at Manchester City sent the one-leg final to extra-time and then penalties, with Barry Lewtas' side emerging 5-3 victors in the shootout.

In 2021, the Reds, managed by Marc Bridge-Wilkinson, reached the competition's decider again but were beaten 2-1 by Aston Villa.
