        "text": "Pianist Paul Bley took the styles and techniques associated with Oscar Peterson, Wynton Kelly, and Bill Evans\n\nto new levels of creative experimentation, becoming an indispensable force in modern music by combining\n\nthe best elements in bop and early modern jazz with extended free improvisation and procedural dynamics\n\noften found in 20th-century chamber music. This approach places him in league with such diverse artists as\n\nRed Garland, Mal Waldron, Jaki Byard, Andrew Hill, Sun Ra, and Marilyn Crispell. Even a cursory overview of\n\nBley's life and work can be pleasantly overwhelming, for he is among the most heavily recorded of all jazz\n\npianists and his story is inextricably intertwined with the evolution of modern jazz during the second half of\n\nthe 20th century. His three dates with Jimmy Giuffre's trio, most notably 1961's Free Fall, were landmark\n\nstudies in vanguard modalism. With Barrage from 1965 and Mr. Joy from 1968, the pianist became familiar to\n\nmany American jazz fans. In the early '70s, Bley issued the piano solo offering Open, To Love -- it remains\n\nhis most prophetic and lyrical solo offering, laying out the juxtapositions for pointillism and space that would\n\nmark his career. He also resumed working with Giuffre during the late part of the decade and into the early\n\n'80s. Bley was prolific in the 1990s as a leader and as a collaborator. He took part in several historic dates,\n\nincluding Annette with Franz Koglmann and Gary Peacock, Memoirs with Charlie Haden and Paul Motian, a pair of ECM trio dates with Barre Phillips and Evan Parker (Time Will Tell and Sankt Gerold Variations), and Not Two, Not One with Peacock and Motian. Bley began the 21st century as active as he had left the 20th, working as a collaborator with Kenny Millions, Mario Pavone, and a young Jakob Bro. The final two recordings credited to Bley as a leader were solo offerings: the studio album About Time, in 2007, and Play Blue (Oslo Concert), recorded in 2008 but unissued until 2014.\n\nHyman Paul Bley was born in Montreal, Canada, on November 10, 1932. A violin prodigy at five, he began\n\nplaying piano at eight and studied at the McGill Conservatorium, earning his diploma at age 11. Before long,\n\nHy \"Buzzy\" Bley was sitting in with jazz bands and had formed his own group. Already a skilled pianist, he\n\nlanded a steady gig at the Alberta Lounge soon after Oscar Peterson left to begin working for Norman Granz\n\nin 1949. The following year, Bley continued his musical education at the Juilliard School in New York while\n\ngigging in the clubs with trumpeter Roy Eldridge, trombonist Bill Harris, and saxophonists Ben Webster,\n\nSonny Rollins, and Charlie Parker. While enrolled at Juilliard, he played in a group with trumpeter Donald\n\nByrd, saxophonist Jackie McLean, bassist Doug Watkins, and drummer Art Taylor. He also hung out at Lennie\n\nTristano's residential studio, absorbing ideas. During the 1980s, Bley was restless: he recorded for acclaimed\n\ndates for Soul Note, SteepleChase (including a duo-led set with Chet Baker entitled Diane), ECM, and Owl.\n\nThe 1990s marked Bley's most prolific period as a recording artist. He toured constantly, recorded often, and\n\ntook part in several historic recordings including Annette, with Franz Koglmann and Peacock, and Time Will\n\nTell, with Barre Phillips and Evan Parker. The latter grouping toured extensively and in 2000 issued Sankt\n\nGerold Variations on ECM. While he didn't issue nearly as much (comparatively, at least) under his own name\n\nfor the remainder of his life, Bley was an active collaborator and sideman, working with everyone from Mario\n\nPavone and Andreas Willers to Benjamin Koppel and Jakob Bro, while his discography as both leader and\n\nsideman saw many titles reissued.\n\nPaul Bley's earliest known recordings survive as soundtracks from Canadian television; the first was in 1950\n\nwith tenor saxophonist Brew Moore and the second in February 1953 with Charlie Parker, special invited guest\n\nof the Montreal Jazz Workshop, an artist-run organization Bley helped to establish. His first studio recording\n\ndate took place in November 1953 with bassist Charles Mingus and drummer Art Blakey. The young pianist's\n\nconstant interaction with archetypal and influential musicians was phenomenal; he also sat in with trumpeter\n\nChet Baker and saxophonist Lester Young. In 1954 he led three different recording sessions with bassists\n\nPeter Ind and Percy Heath, and drummer Al Levitt. At this stage of his career, Paul Bley was an inspired,\n\nextremely adept bop pianist whose first decisively innovative period was just about to commence.\n\nThe plot thickened when Bley moved to California in 1957 and began holding down a steady engagement at\n\nthe Hillcrest Club in Los Angeles, where he was recorded in 1958 with saxophonist Ornette Coleman,\n\ntrumpeter Don Cherry, bassist Charlie Haden, and drummer Billy Higgins. He also performed with Canadian\n\ntrumpeter Herb Spanier and recorded an album with vibraphonist Dave Pike, featuring liner notes and one\n\ncomposition by Karen Borg, a brilliant musician who married the pianist in 1957 and changed her name to\n\nCarla Bley. In 1959, the Bleys moved to New York City, where they continued to interact with musicians who\n\nwere operating on the cutting edge of modern jazz, including multi-instrumentalist Roland Kirk, saxophonist\n\nand composer Oliver Nelson; composer and bandleader George Russell; composer, bassist, and bandleader\n\nCharles Mingus; trumpeter and bandleader Don Ellis; bassists Gary Peacock and Steve Swallow; drummer\n\nPete LaRoca; and multi-reedman Jimmy Giuffre. In 1961, Paul Bley made his first visit to Europe.\n\nIn 1963, Bley toured Japan with Sonny Rollins and participated in the tenor saxophonist's historic jousting\n\nsession with Coleman Hawkins. The following year, Paul and Carla Bley accepted trumpeter Bill Dixon's\n\ninvitation to join the Jazz Composer's Guild. This brought them into direct contact with Austrian-American\n\ncomposer and trumpeter Michael Mantler; trombonists Bennie Green and Roswell Rudd; saxophonists Archie\n\nShepp and John Tchicai; and pianist Cecil Taylor. Bley, who also worked with saxophonist Albert Ayler, taped a\n\nsession with tenor saxophonist John Gilmore, bassist Gary Peacock, and drummer Paul Motian, and then\n\nbegan recording for the independent ESP-Disk label.\n\nBarrage featured a quintet with bassist Eddie Gomez, drummer Milford Graves, and two musicians who, like\n\nGilmore, were closely affiliated with Sun Ra: trumpeter Dewey Johnson and altoist Marshall Allen. All of the\n\npieces were composed by Carla Bley. Recorded in 1965 and released as Closer, the first of many albums\n\ninvolving drummer Barry Altschul featured works by Carla Bley, Ornette Coleman, and Gary Peacock's wife,\n\nAnnette Peacock. Several trio projects materialized in Scandinavia during the years 1965-1966; from this\n\npoint on, Bley would spend increasing amounts of time performing and recording in Europe.\n\nSoon after he was divorced from Carla Bley in 1967, Paul Bley married composer and vocalist Annette\n\nPeacock. As was the case with Carla, the influence of this woman upon Paul Bley was profound and lasting,\n\nas he combined his own continuously evolving improvisational methodology with her intriguing tonal\n\nformations. She sometimes sang with Bley's groups as he began to experiment with electronic\n\ninstrumentation including ARP and Moog synthesizers. Recorded in December 1970 and January 1971, an\n\nalbum called the Paul Bley Synthesizer Show spotlighted the futuristic instrument backed by multiple players\n\nincluding drummers Bobby Moses and Han Bennink. In 1972, the Bley/Annette Peacock partnership was\n\ndissolved.\n\nTwo years later, Bley and his new companion, video artist Carol Goss, founded the Improvising Artists record\n\nlabel. Soon they set precedents for the gradually emerging format of music videos. During two back-to-back\n\nsessions in 1974, Bley introduced to the scene a pair of promising young musicians: guitarist Pat Metheny\n\nand bassist Jaco Pastorius. Bley and Goss were married in 1980 and soon moved the Improvising Artists\n\noperation out of New York City to Cherry Valley in central New York State. The '80s saw Bley reaffirming his\n\nlinks with the Canadian music scene while engaging in recording projects with saxophonist John Surman;\n\nguitarists John Abercrombie, John Scofield, and Bill Frisell; bassists Jesper Lundgaard, Red Mitchell, Ron\n\nMcClure, and Bob Cranshaw; and drummers George Cross McDonald, Aage Tanggaard, Keith Copeland, and\n\nBilly Hart.\n\nThroughout the '90s, Paul Bley's creative activities became ever more diverse and international in scope. This\n\nhealthy tendency was epitomized by a hat ART album bearing the title 12 (+6) In a Row, recorded in Boswil,\n\nSwitzerland, during May 1990 with flügelhornist Franz Koglmann and clarinetist/saxophonist Hans Koch.\n\nOther collaborations from this period involved vibraphonist Gary Burton, bassist Niels-Henning Ørsted\n\nPedersen, and vocalist Tiziana Ghiglioni. In 1993, Bley, now a faculty member of the New England\n\nConservatory of Music, released an album of piano solos with overdubbed synthesizers called Synth Thesis.\n\nHis seemingly inexhaustible appetite for creative interaction with modern improvisers led him to record with\n\ntrumpeter Kenny Wheeler; saxophonists Lee Konitz, Evan Parker, and Ralph Simon; guitarist Sonny\n\nGreenwich; bassists Jay Anderson, Dave Young, and Barre Phillips; drummers Stich Wynston, Adam\n\nNussbaum, and Bruce Ditmas; pianists Satoko Fuji, Stéphan Oliva, and Hans Ludemann; and violinist Jean\n\nLuc Ponty, as well as poet and vocalist Paul Haines. In 1997, Bley was heard with an ensemble led by bassist\n\nand composer Maarten Altena.\n\nDuring the first decade of the 21st century, Bley recorded with saxophonists Keshavan Maslak, François\n\nCarrier, and Yuri Honing; guitarist Andreas Willers; bassist Mario Pavone; and vocalist Jeannette Lambert. He\n\nalso released several solo albums, including 2004's Nothing to Declare, 2008's About Time, and 2014's Play\n\nBlue: Oslo Concert, which documented his 2008 performance at the Oslo Jazz Festival. Bley was also named\n\na member of the Order of Canada in 2008, in honor of his contributions to jazz.\n\nBley died of natural causes on January 3, 2016, at his Florida home. He was 83 years old. In 2019, ECM\n\nissued the archival When Will the Blues Leave, a trio concert with Peacock and Motian captured in Switzerland\n\nin 1999.\n\n—Arwulf Arwulf (All Music Guide)\n\nRead less"
