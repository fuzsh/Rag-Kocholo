        "text": "Niels-Henning Oersted Pedersen, one of Denmark's best known jazz musicians, who performed with legends such as Miles Davis, Dexter Gordon and Dizzy Gillespie, has died at age 58.\n\nOersted Pedersen, the bass player widely known by his initials NHOP and nicknamed The Great Dane,\" died Tuesday in Copenhagen, leading jazz experts and Danish media said. The cause of death was not immediately known.\n\nHis career as a bass player took off in 1962 when, at age 16, he played in Copenhagen's famed Montmartre jazz club, where American greats including Count Basie, Gordon and pianist Bud Powell performed.\n\nHowever, his international breakthrough came in 1973, when he joined the Oscar Peterson trio produced by Norman Granz.\n\nIn reality, he was Denmark's best known musician regardless of the genre,\" said Cim Meyer, the editor of Jazz Special, a Danish music magazine.\n\nMeyer said Oersted Pedersen was lucky to be a jazz musician in Denmark when famous U.S. musicians settled in the country believing they found refuge from racism, police harassment and musical obscurity in the United States.\n\nOersted Pedersen appeared on hundreds of records and played with Toots Thielemans, Chet Baker, Lee Konitz and Martial Solal, among others.\n\nClaus Vittus, a leading jazz expert with Denmark's public radio, dubbed Oersted Pedersen one of the world's greatest\" jazz bassists.\n\nFrom 1964 to 1982, he was a member of the reputed Danish Radio's Big Band and also has performed with trumpeter Palle Mikkelborg and keyboard player Kenneth Knudsen, both Danes.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Solveig Pedersen.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nFor more information contact All About Jazz."
