Originally recorded for the German Saba label and made available in the U.S. on this Pausa LP, Ponty is heard performing in a quartet also including pianist Wolfgang Dauner, bassist Niels Pedersen and drummer Daniel Humair. The music, much more straight-ahead than Ponty's output of the 1970s, is quite advanced, looking toward John Coltrane at times. In addition to \"You've Changed\" (one of the few standards ever recorded by the violinist), the band performs Denny Zeitlin's \"Carole's Gordon\" and three group compositions, including Ponty's \"Suite for Claudia.\" Already at this time, Jean-Luc Ponty was a highly original and brilliant player.” AllMusic Review by Scott Yanow\n\nRatings :\n\nAllMusic : 4 / 5 , Discogs : ,27 / 5"
