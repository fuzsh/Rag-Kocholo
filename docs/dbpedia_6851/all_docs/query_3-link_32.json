        "text": "Philip Catherine (born 27 October 1942) is a Belgian jazz guitarist.\n\n[]\n\n[]\n\nHe was born in London to an English mother and Belgian father.\n\nHe began playing in the 1960s with Lou Bennett, Dexter Gordon and Stéphane Grappelli. He was then a member of the Jean-Luc Ponty quintet, right after he recorded his first album, Stream, produced by Frenchman Sacha Distel. The album was recorded in 1970, in Paris, and released in 1971 on Warner Bros. Records. A year later, he met John Scofield, Ran Blake, George Benson and more musicians in Boston.\n\nIn early 1976 Catherine replaced Jan Akkerman in the Dutch rock group Focus and appeared on one album with the band, Focus con Proby, which also featured American singer P. J. Proby.\n\nIn the 1980s Catherine played extensively with the Chet Baker Trio and is featured on several of Baker's albums. He also played with Charlie Mingus who named Catherine Young Django.\n\nAllAboutJazz critique Ed Kopp in his review of Catherine's album Guitar Groove said:\n\n\"Guitar Groove is an astoundingly lyrical effort from a guitarist in his prime. It should appeal equally to fans of mainstream jazz and fusion, and to anyone who appreciates superior jazz musicianship.\"[1]\n\nAnother AllAboutJazz critique John Kelman in his review of Cathrine's 2008 album Guitars Two said:\n\n\"Sometimes it's not a good thing to get branded too early in your career. Called 'the young Django' by Charles Mingus and operating in the same fusion sphere as John McLaughlin and Larry Coryell, Belgian Philip Catherine was pegged in the '70s as a firebrand guitarist, albeit an unabashedly lyrical one. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but Catherine's career, now nearing its sixth decade, has always been about a lot more than powerhouse fusion chops, something Guitars Two demonstrates in spades. Catherine's ability to reference traditional markers from Reinhardt to Wes Montgomery, while sounding like nobody but himself, makes Guitars Two the kind of career high point that ought to dispel the guitarist's early branding. The qualities that established his reputation remain, but are subsumed in a broader approach that makes Guitars Two deserving of a place alongside Pat Metheny's New Chautauqua (ECM, 1979), Bill Frisell's Ghost Town (Nonesuch, 2000) and Joe Pass' '70s Virtuoso series on Pablo', as a pinnacle of what can be done by one man and a handful of guitars.\"[2]\n\nHe is considered the grandfather of Belgian jazz as he continues to play on the now very active Belgian jazz scene. He won the first Belgian Golden Django (in 1995) as best French-speaking artist.\n\nDiscography[]\n\nStream (1971)\n\nSeptember man (1975)\n\nGuitars (1975)\n\nNairam (1976)\n\nBabel (1980)\n\nEnd of August (1982)\n\nTransparence (1986)\n\nSeptember sky (1988)\n\nOscar (1988)\n\nI remember you (1990)\n\nMoods, Vol.I (1992)\n\nMoods, Vol.II (1992)\n\nPhilip Catherine \"live\" (1997)\n\nGuitar groove (1998)\n\nBlue prince (2001)\n\nSummer night (2002)\n\nGuitars two (2008)\n\nPlays Cole Porter (2011)\n\nCôté jardin (2012)\n\nWith Other Artists[]\n\nWith Aziza Mustafa Zadeh:\n\nJazziza (1996) Columbia 487897 2\n\nWith Chet Baker :\n\nRassinfosse, Baker, Catherine (1983) Igloo 034CD\n\nThere'll Never be Another You (1985) Timeless cd sjp437\n\nChet' s Choice (1985) Criss Cross 1016 CD\n\nStrollin (1985) Enja 5005CD\n\nIn Bologna (1985) Live Dreyfus 191 133-2\n\nWith Baruti Trio @ 4 :\n\nNdugu Yangu (1996) Maîsha com 01\n\nWith Lou Bennett & Jack Sels:\n\nJack Sels (1961) IBC 4C 054 97754\n\nWith Emmanuel Bex, Aldo Romano:\n\nTrio\n\nWith Carla Bley, Mike Mantler:\n\nMore Movies (1979) Watt 10A/1\n\nWith Julien Clerc:\n\nStudio (2003) virgin 72435 843632 7\n\nWith Larry Coryell:\n\nTWIN HOUSE (1976) Atlantic 50 342\n\nBACK TOGETHER AGAIN (1977) WEA 50382\n\nSPLENDID (1978) Electra 52 986\n\nWith Laila Dalseth:\n\nA WOMAN'S INTUITION (1995) GMCD 87\n\nWith Freddie Deronde:\n\nSPONTANEOUS EFFORT (1990) Igloo IGL 081\n\nWith Klaus Doldinger, Buddy Guy, Les McCann, Johnny Griffin...\n\nDOLDINGER JUBILEE (1975) Atlantic SD 18162\n\nWith Kenny Drew:\n\nMorning (SteepleChase, 1975)\n\nIn Concert (SteepleChase, 1977)\n\nAnd Far Away (Soul Note, 1983)\n\nWith European Jazz Ensemble :\n\nLIVE AT THE PHILARMONIC,KÖLN (1989) M.A Music A 800-2\n\nWith Focus:\n\nLIVE AT BBC (1976) Hux050\n\nCON PROBY (1978) Harvest ST-1721\n\nWith Richard Galliano:\n\nNEW MUSETTE (1991) Label Bleu LBLC 6547 HM 83\n\nWith Michaël Gibbs:\n\nTHE ONLY CHROME WATERFALL ORCH.
