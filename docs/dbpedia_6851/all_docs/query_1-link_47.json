        "text": "Jean-Luc Ponty\n\nJean-Luc Ponty is a pioneer and undisputed master of violin in the area of jazz and rock. He is\n\nwidely regarded as an innovator who has applied his unique visionary spin that has expanded the\n\nvocabulary of modern music.\n\nThe great American jazz violinist Stuff Smith hearing Ponty in the 60’s said “he is a killer, he\n\nplays on the violin like Coltrane does on sax” (Jazz Encyclopedia In The Sixties by Leonard\n\nFeather). In an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle in 1976, Stéphane Grappelli said “No\n\nhe is not a student … he is a great musician and invented a new style on the violin”.\n\nPonty was born in a family of classical musicians on September 29, 1942 in Avranches, France.\n\nHis father taught violin, his mother taught piano. At sixteen, he was admitted to the\n\nConservatoire National Supérieur de Musique de Paris, graduating two years later with the\n\ninstitution’s highest award, Premier Prix. In turn, he was immediately hired by one of the major\n\nsymphony orchestras, Concerts Lamoureux, where he played for three years.\n\nWhile still a member of the orchestra in Paris, Ponty picked up a side gig, playing clarinet (which\n\nhis father had taught him) for a college jazz band that regularly performed at local parties. It\n\nproved a life-changing jumping-off point. A growing interest in the jazz sounds of Miles Davis\n\nand John Coltrane compelled him to take up the tenor saxophone. Fueled by an all-encompassing\n\ncreative passion, Jean-Luc soon felt the need to express his jazz voice through his main\n\ninstrument, the violin.\n\nSo it was that Ponty found himself leading a dual musical life: rehearsing and performing with the\n\norchestra while also playing jazz until 3 AM at clubs throughout Paris. The demands of this\n\ndoomed schedule eventually brought him to a crossroads. “Naturally, I had to make a choice, so I\n\ntook a chance with jazz”, says Jean-Luc.\n\nAt first, the violin proved to be a handicap; few at the time viewed the instrument as having a\n\nlegitimate place in the modern jazz vocabulary. With a powerful sound that eschewed vibrato,\n\nJean-Luc distinguished himself with be-bop era phrasings and a punchy style influenced more by\n\nhorn players than by anything previously tried on the violin; nobody had heard anything quite like\n\nit before. Ponty played with some of the best European musicians such as Daniel Humair, Eddy\n\nLouiss, Niels-Henning-Ørsted Pedersen among others, his notoriety grew with remarkable leaps\n\nand in June 1964, at age 21, he recorded his debut solo album for Philips, Jazz Long Playing\n\n(Universal/Emarcy). A 1966 live album called Violin Summit united Ponty on stage in Basel,\n\nSwitzerland with such notable string talents as Svend Asmussen, Stéphane Grappelli and Stuff\n\nSmith.\n\nIn 1967, John Lewis of The Modern Jazz Quartet invited Ponty to perform at the Monterey Jazz\n\nFestival in California. Jean-Luc’s first-ever American appearance garnered thunderous applause\n\nand led to a U.S. recording contract with producer Richard Bock for his World Pacific label.\n\nJean-Luc returned to California in 1968 and 1969 to perform and record the albums Electric\n\nConnection with the Gerald Wilson Big Band, and Jean-Luc Ponty Experience with the George\n\nDuke Trio. Through the late-60s and early 70s, Ponty achieved mounting critical praise and\n\npopularity across Europe. In turn, the violinist soon found his signature talents in demand by top\n\nrecording artists the world over.\n\nIn 1969, Frank Zappa composed the music for Jean-Luc’s solo album King Kong (Blue Note). In\n\n1972, Elton John invited Ponty to contribute to his Honky Chateau #1 hit album. In 1973, at the\n\nurging of Zappa who wanted him to join his band the Mothers of Invention, Ponty migrated with\n\nhis wife and two young daughters to America and made his home in Los Angeles. He continued\n\nto work on a variety of projects - including a pair of John McLaughlin/Mahavishnu Orchestra\n\nalbums and world tours (Apocalypse, Visions of the Emerald Beyond). In the meantime he\n\nbecame a prolific composer, signed on as a solo artist with Atlantic Records in early 1975,\n\nreleased his first album Upon The Wings Of Music that same year and started touring with his\n\nown band.\n\nFor the next decade, Jean-Luc toured the world repeatedly and recorded 12 consecutive albums as\n\nbandleader, violinist, keyboardist, composer and producer, which all reached the top 5 on the\n\nBillboard jazz charts and sold millions of copies. Early Atlantic recordings, such as 1976’s\n\nAurora and Imaginary Voyage, firmly established him as a figurehead in America’s growing jazzrock\n\nmovement. He went on to crack the top 40 U.S. pop charts in 1977 with the Enigmatic\n\nOcean album and again in 1978 with Cosmic Messenger. In 1984, a revolutionary video featuring\n\ntime-lapse images was produced by Louis Schwarzberg for Individual Choice. Along with Herbie\n\nHancock, Ponty became one of the first jazz musicians to have a music video.\n\nFrom the 80s to this day Ponty has been recording and touring around the world with his own\n\ngroups, and he has done collaborations with other great musicians such as drummer guitarists\n\nAllan Holdsworth, Al Di Meola, bassist Stanley Clarke, West African musicians, banjo player\n\nBela Fleck, Lalo Schifrin, violinists Nigel Kennedy - Mark O'Connor and L. Subramaniam from\n\nIndia, classical violist and conductor Yuri Bashmet from Russia, pianist Wolfgang Dauner,\n\nguitarist Bireli Lagrene, Chick Corea, Lenny White, Frank Gambale and singer Jon Anderson.\n\nJean Luc has also recorded and performed with his daughter pianist-singer-composer Clara, and\n\nperformed his music with symphony orchestras in the U.S.A, Canada, Japan, Western and Eastern\n\nEurope, Brazil and Russia.\n\nAWARDS\n\nJean-Luc Ponty has received the following awards:\n\n1966 the Django Reinhardt prize in France for his first solo album\n\n1980 Grammy nomination for best pop instrumental in the USA\n\n1992 'Victoire de la Musique' Lifetime Achievement Award in France\n\n2001 Medal of Honor of the city of Avranches, France, where JLP was born\n\n2007 Jazz Trophy in Germany\n\n2009 Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur in France\n\n2008 Lifetime Achievement Award in Temuco, Chile\n\n2011 Lifetime Achievement Award in Cork, in Ireland\n\n2012 The Grand Prix of the Sochi Arts Festival in Russia\n\n2012 Lifetime Achievement Award in Nis, Serbia\n\n2016 Lifetime Achievement Award in Zagreb, Croatia\n\n2016 Officier de la Legion d'Honneur in France\n\nFor more info please visit www.ponty.com"
