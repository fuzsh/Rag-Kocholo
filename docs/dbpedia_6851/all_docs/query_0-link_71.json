        "text": "Django\n\nAlthough he's not young anymore he's the closest I've heard in many years - try Phillip Catherine for a modern day artist - part of a review follows:\n\nPhilip Catherine has been called the \"Young Django\" by none other than Charles Mingus, and upon hearing his elliptical, rapid-fire, expressively melodic acoustic guitar, there can be no doubt as to whose records he was absorbing as a youth. Born to a Belgian father and English mother living in London during World War II, Catherine went back with his family to Brussels after the war, where he learned guitar and turned professional at 17. The examples of Larry Coryell and John McLaughlin led Catherine into jazz-rock; he played with Jean-Luc Ponty's Experience from 1970 to 1972 before taking a year off to study at Boston's Berklee School. Back in Europe in 1973, he founded the band Pork Pie, which recorded into the mid- and late '70s; he also formed a duo with Niels-Henning Ã˜rsted Pedersen and worked with such musicians as Mingus and Stephane Grappelli. If anything, Catherine is best-known in America for his duets with Coryell, which began spontaneously in Berlin in 1976, triggered some lovely duo albums for Elektra, and helped steer Coryell back to the acoustic guitar.\n\nReally? I've got the third box sitting here on my desk, and the artwork clearly says \"FRESHLY REMASTERED BY TED KENDALL\". Wait - here's the advert from JSP:\n\nSo are the employees of JSP's art department deluded, or lying? They didn't make any such claim on the second box (the banner for that one only said \"REMASTERED - RE-ENGINEERED\").\n\nSpeaking of which, what do folks here generally think of JSP's other releases, and the restoration efforts of John R. T. Davies and Ted Kendall? As a 78 collector, I'd especially be interested in Steve's thoughts/comments on the subject.\n\n- M.\n\nI have about 25 Quintet Of The Hot Club Of France original 78's from Gt. Britain and France, 1936-39 and a bunch from Decca (both USA and Gt. Britain) that were issued during and after the war. Some of the most amazing playing anywhere from both Django and Stephan Grappelli. Of course, Joe Venuti was the original \"jazzy\" violin player with Eddie Lang on guitar and THEIR stuff on Okeh and Victor was basically the inspiration for the Hot Club Of France. Django was quite the amazing player especially since he lost the use of several fingers of his left hand in a caravan fire. I can't get enough of those guys.\n\nFor me though, Django without Grappelli is like bread without butter. You need them both.\n\nI didn't know this! First John R. T. Davies, now David French. Sad times indeed for the reissuing of classic jazz.\n\nI'm not Steve, nor am I a remastering engineer, nor even a collector of 78s. (It's just little old me, Underdog.) But I do collect classic jazz on CD, and experience has taught me to follow the work of those remastering engineers whose work I respect (including Steve of course, when it comes to the magnetic tape era). IMO, John R. T. Davies is simply the best. There's no one to touch him when it comes to \"lifting\" the music off of old 78s. Kendall learned some of Davies' art, and is very good as well. Very importantly, they don't use digital NR. All noise reduction is done in the analog domain. I find digital NR, as applied to 78 RPM recordings, to be the kiss of death. Yes, Mosaic/Addey do it better than most, but in general -- and certainly as applied by the major labels -- it is soul-destroying.\n\nP.S. As for JSP, anything remastered by Davies or Kendall is worth having. I avoid their later releases, which are reportedly ripped off from Mosaic, Revenant, and other independent labels which have actually put in the hard work to find the best sources and transfer them properly. Even if the ripped-off JSP copy sounds good -- and they certainly are cheaper -- I refuse to buy them on moral grounds. What JSP is doing may make them some money in the short run, but in the long run it will remove the incentive for the independents to reissue this material in the first place, and then where will we be?\n\nDang, bud,\n\nI didn't know you knew about Eddie Lang. I should've figured though. I recently took a jazz guitar class taught by Fred Sokolow at McCabes, and he turned me on to Lang and Venuti. I never realized Django was inspired by them, but after listening to some selected tracks it was such an eye opener. Man, that stuff is tuff to play, even with all my fingers. Charlie Christian is next. I just want an understanding and appreciation of what they did so I can write about it somewhat intelligently. I have no pretense that I can actually play their stuff or even come close.\n\nsc: As for modern versions of Django...I don't think you can go wrong with the Soundtrack to Woody Allen's \"Sweet and Lowdown.\" It has all the famous tunes, and done very well."
