I found the link to an old NET broadcast which had been uploaded. Here's the link if you care to view any of it.\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/calauem_000153\n\nFor those of you wanting song listings and musicians, here you go:\n\nFlying Home - Illinois Jacquet, John Lewis, Ray Brown, Louis Bellson\n\nSome of These Days - Ray Nance, John Lewis, Ray Brown, Louis Bellson\n\nC Jam Blues - Ray Nance, Svend Asmussen, Jean-Luc Ponty, John Lewis, Ray Brown Niels-HenningØrsted Pedersen, Louis Bellson\n\nGentle Rain - Dizzy Gillespie Quintet (Mike Longo, James Moody, Russell George, Candy Finch)\n\nSomething in Your Smile - Dizzy Gillespie Quintet\n\n‘Round Midnight - Dizzy Gillespie & the Modern Jazz Quartet\n\nNew Horizons - Don Ellis Orchestra\n\nThere are some issues with the video in the Gillespie/MJQ number, though the audio doesn't seem to be affected.\n\nEdited May 12, 2017 by Ken Dryden\n\nGreat that the videos via that link are working - last time I checked the Don Ellis collection it threw me off after about 5 minutes for all of the audio and video archive material. Last night I was able to play in full that 1968 San Fran Museum of Art show. Wonderfull !\n\nGood to see Illinois J. in his pomp with John Lewis and co. in the Monterey show. Will check out the rest of it today.\n\nI just received a reply from the Stanford University Library. They dated the performances as being September 15, 1967.\n\nThey evidently don't have the video footage from the public television broadcast. Here is what they have in their collection:\n\nJazz Violin Conclave\n\nRAY NANCE and trio\n\n1. The Man I Love [incomplete]\n\nJEAN LUC PONTY and trio\n\n2. Sunday Walk\n\n3. Carol’s Garden\n\nSVEND ASMUSSEN, RAY NANCE, JEAN LUC PONTY and quartet\n\n4. [Unidentified septet]\n\n5. [No content]\n\nDIZZY GILLESPIE QUINTET\n\n6. [Sudden Samba?]\n\n7. Gentle Rain [incomplete] genre\n\nJEAN LUC PONTY, violin ; with GEORGE GRUNTZ, piano ; NIELS HENNING ØRSTED PEDERSEN, bass ; DANIEL HUMAIR, drums\n\nSVEND ASMUSSEN, RAY NANCE, JEAN LUC PONTY, violins ; with JOHN LEWIS, piano ; NIELS HENNING ØRSTED PEDERSEN, RAY BROWN, basses ; LOUIS BELLSON, drums\n\nDIZZY GILLESPIE QUINTET\n\n(DIZZY GILLESPIE, trumpet ; JAMES MOODY, alto saxophone, flute ; MIKE LONGO, piano ; RUSSELL GEORGE, electric bass ; OTIS \"CANDY\" FINCH, drums)"
