        "meta_description": "The Bass in the Background by Niels Henning Ørsted Pedersen, released 19 December 2019\n\n1. Bouncing With Bud\n2. Wee Dot\n3. Wait a Second\n4. Parisian Thoroughfare\n5. Skip It\n6. Swingin&#39; Till the Girls Come Home\n7. Cottontail\n8. Soy Califa\n9. Sweet Georgia Brown\n10. You&#39;re Blasé\n11. Rhythm-a-Ning\n12. Kary&#39;s Trance\n13. Morning Fun\n14. Imagine\n15. You Don&#39;t Know What Love Is\n\nThe sudden death of NHØP on April 19th 2005 was a shock to the whole jazz community. This CD is a selection of some of the best tunes from Storyville recordings, where NHØP was sideman. The Great Dane is here in absolute top form, backing up some of the greatest jazz musicians ever. The CD covers a period of 30 years - from 1962 when NHØP was all but a teenager, and up to 1992. Besides the well-established Danish artists such as Svend Asmussen, Bent Jædig and Alex Riel, NHØP can be heard in beautiful collaboration with names like Kenny Drew, Ben Webster, Dexter Gordon, Ed Thigpen and Stuff Smith to name a few. This CD clearly showcases why NHØP was one of the best bass players in the world. The version of John Lennon&#39;s beautiful &quot;Imagine&quot; on this CD says it all.",
