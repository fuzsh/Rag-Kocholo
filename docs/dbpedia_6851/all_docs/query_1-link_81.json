He is widely regarded as an innovator who has applied his unique visionary spin that has expanded the vocabulary of modern music.\n\nSays Jean Luc, “We’re calling it ‘The Atlantic Years’ tour since I am touring with my band from the late 70’s – 80’s with whom I recorded several albums for Atlantic Records, and we perform some classics from these early albums exclusively.”\n\nThe Jean Luc Ponty Band features:\n\nJean Luc Ponty – violin\n\nJamie Glaser – guitars\n\nKeith Jones – bass\n\nRayford Griffin – drums\n\nWally Minko – keyboards\n\nJean Luc Ponty Band 2018 US tour dates:\n\n8/13 – Chicago / The City Winery\n\n8/14 – Chicago / The City Winery\n\n8/15 – Detroit / Chene Park\n\n8/17 – Pittsburgh / Allegheny County South Park Bandshell\n\n8/18 – Philadelphia / Keswick Theatre, Glenside PA\n\n8/19 – Alexandria VA / The Birchmere Music Hall\n\n8/21 – Annapolis MD / Rams Head\n\n8/22 – Annapolis MD / Rams Head\n\n8/23 – Newton NJ / Newton Theatre – Skylands PAC\n\n8/24 – Beverly MA / Cabot Theatre\n\n8/26 – Westbury, Long Island NY / The Space\n\n8/28 – Albany, NY / The Egg\n\n8/29 – Fairfield CT / The Warehouse\n\n8/30 – New York City / Sony Hall Theatre\n\nAfter studying classical violin at the Paris Conservatory, Jean Luc Ponty turned to jazz in the 60’s.

His pioneering work on the electric violin in the 70’s attracted the attention of pop and rock musicians, he recorded with Elton John and participated to several tours and legendary recordings with Frank Zappa’s Mothers of Invention and John McLaughlin’s Mahavishnu Orchestra. In 1975 he founded his own band and became one of the most prominent figures of the jazz-fusion movement in the USA, selling millions of albums that all reached the top of the US charts.

A player of rock, jazz, jazz fusion and more, Ponty lists Frank Zappa, the Mahavishnu Orchestra, Stephane Grapelli, Elton John, Chick Corea and Jon Anderson of Yes among his many collaborators. But Ponty has also released an incredible run of solo albums over the years, including many for the vaunted Atlantic Records label.\n\nPonty has just begun a national tour that’s dubbed The Atlantic Years tour, a venture that’ll see him feature songs from albums like Imaginary Voyage, Cosmic Messenger, Enigmatic Ocean and other albums he released on Atlantic in the ‘70s and early ‘80s. That tour, with all the sidemen who played on those iconic albums, visits the Scottsdale Center for the Performing Arts in Scottsdale, Arizona on June 9. In advance of the show we had a chance to chat by email with Ponty who told us how the tour came about and what he still hopes to accomplish before he retires. Ponty’s commentary below is given exclusively to AXS.com.\n\nAXS: It’s quite the accomplishment to bring together the members of your band from the late ‘70s for your Atlantic Years tour. When the idea struck, did you already know where all of these players were, and did you have to do any cajoling to get any of them on board with the idea?\n\nJean Luc Ponty: I have always kept in touch with these musicians and there was absolutely no need to cajole any of them.\n\nAXS: How much rehearsal did you have to do to dust off some of the older material?\n\nJLP: We already did an Atlantic Years tour in South America a few years ago, but we had to wait till everyone was available to do it in the U.S., which is the case now. So just a few days was enough to refresh everyone’s memory. But what is special is the fun we experience being together again, almost giving us the illusion that we are still as young as we were.

(The minimum pledge is only $1.00) The project will only get funded if they hit goal by Sunday August 24th at 1:55 PM EDT. Join the ‘Jon Anderson & Jean-Luc Ponty Project’ and help these incredible legends reach their goal for recording a new album… Contribute and join in on the musical journey HERE\n\nThe musical blend of Jon Anderson’s angelic vocalizations of progressive rock virtue and Jean-Luc Ponty’s awe-inspiring instrumentation of jazz-fusion & classical essence… will undeniably be spectacular!\n\nJEAN-LUC PONTY was taught by his classically trained parents who were also music teachers. He learned to read musical notes before he learned the alphabet. Ponty was taught the violin and piano, but at the age of eleven his father asked him to choose only one instrument so he would be proficient with a single instrument instead of mediocre at several.\n\nAfter graduating from the Conservatoire de Paris, it appeared that Jean-Luc was on the way to a prodigious classical music career and eventually performed with a major symphony orchestra. But Ponty also began to establish a musical appetite for jazz music which led to Jean-Luc recording his debut “bebop” album entitled Jazz Long Playing in 1964.\n\nFor the rest of the bio and the interview, please visit the Music Tried and True website!\n\nInterview:Jean-Luc Ponty (Anderson Ponty Band,Frank Zappa,Mahavishnu Orchestra)\n\nΔημοσιεύθηκε 4 Αυγούστου 2014\n\nHIT CHANNEL EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: August 2014. We had the great honour to talk with a legendary violinist and composer: Jean-Luc Ponty. He has a very successful solo career and has played with Frank Zappa, Mahavishnu Orchestra, Elton John, Stanley Clarke, Al Di Meola, Return to Forever, Allan Holdsworth and many others. He is currently working with Jon Anderson of YES on the first album of Anderson Ponty Band. Read below the very interesting things he told us:\n\nHow did you get in touch with Jon Anderson?\n\nWe knew each other from the past. When I was with the band Mahavishnu Orchestra with John McLaughlin . When we toured in 1974 or ’75 in the U.S we did one show with Yes. The two bands together. And then, maybe 10 years later I was in the offices of Atlantic Records in Los Angeles, coming out of a meeting because that was the record label I was with at the time and Yes was also in Atlantic Records. He was walking in to a meeting, so we cross passed. We were introduced and we talked briefly. I told him that I really admired his singing and creative songwriting and he said that he liked my violin playing and my music too and even suggested at the time that we do a project together at some point. But then, we never met again and you know life goes on and we put in contact again a year ago. A producer of his was talking about me doing a violin solo on his song “Go Ahead”. And when we got in contact, we came up with the idea putting a band together. So, it’s funny that it happens so late. But better late than never.\n\nYou are writing music for the debut album of Anderson Ponty Band. Can you give us some info about its sound?\n\nIt’s always difficult to describe sounds with words. I would say that there is his musical personality, which means the way he sings, the kind of melodies he always wrote with arrangements that are a lot more up-to-date in terms rhythms and sounds. But we are going to play a very limited number of classics of each other. Because I know the fans are always happy to hear some pieces that they liked in the past and we like to play still today. But some pieces we did –him and me- are still sounding very good today. So, we keep that. The idea is to keep the musical personalities of the original sounds, but the production on it will be more modern.\n\nWhy you decided to start a Kickstarter campaign for the recording of the album?\n\nThat was really a management’s choice. We have a manager in common, he is who put us together, and he had interest from record companies. No problem. But, I guess he wanted to keep control and use today’s ways of producing an album as opposed to the old way when an artist had no other choice than signing with a record company. He decided to go this way and then Jon and myself said: “It’s ok. Let’s do it. Let’s see how it works”.\n\nFor the rest of the interview, please visit the Hit Channel website!\n\nFor Immediate Release\n\nMusic Legends Jon Anderson and Jean-Luc Ponty Announce Formation of New Music Ensemble –\n\nThe Anderson Ponty Band!\n\nLos Angeles, CA – Music legends Jon Anderson and Jean-Luc Ponty announce the formation of a new ensemble – The Anderson Ponty Band!
