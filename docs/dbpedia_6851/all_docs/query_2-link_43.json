        "text": "EU Import\n\nAvant-garde tenor saxophonist Archie Shepp created a stir in 1977 when he recorded a set of hymns and folk melodies in melodic duets with pianist Horace Parlan. On February 6, 1980, he reunited with Parlan for a set of blues associated with Bessie Smith, and the following day, as a sort of sequel, Shepp played eight songs associated with Charlie Parker in collaboration with bassist Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen.\n\nAlthough never a bebopper, Shepp does surprisingly well on such tunes as \"Moose the Mooche,\" \"Ornithology,\" \"Yardbird Suite\" and \"Confirmation,\" even if he makes the mistake of doubling on his erratic soprano during a few numbers. Archie Shepp pays tribute to Bird not by copying him, but by being creative and playing Parker's repertoire in his own sound.\n\nRecommended.\n\nScott Yanow AMG"
