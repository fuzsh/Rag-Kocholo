It is also, as a literary experience, one of the strangest since it gives wildly\n\ncontradictory signals about what kind of a work it is. Certainly i it is a horror tale in which\n\nthere is plenty of that fearful, grisly, wonderful, and sometimes silly stuff that we count on finding in our blood-and-gore late-bedtime reading. On the other hand, from its pages there rise images so dreamlike and yet so imperative that we experience them as ancient _. allegories. Everywhere one looks, there flicker the shadows of primordial struggles: the perpetual tension between the dark and the light; the wrestling :match between Christ and Satan; and finally, the complex allegories of sex: sex in all its unimaginable i innocence, or sex reeking with the full perfume of the swamp. And all these urgencies are seen or sensed through a hot wash of blood which, deny it though we will, fascinates us very nearly to the point of shame. This book, this Dracula, has, since 1897 when it was written, managed to interject into the culture of the West the image of a creature of such symbolic force that he has\n\nbecome something like a culture hero whom our first duty it is to hate even while we have\n\nfor him a certain weird admiration. What an elegant monster he is! How strong, how graceful, how lonely, how wise. And above all—and here is. his central mystery —how deadly . . . and erotic. Everywhere one looks, the power—or the legacy —of the book i is felt. The film industry i in a dozen countries inexhaustibly reinvents the adventures of the Count or his various semblables: Baron Latoes, Count Alucard, Count Yorga, Blacula. Because there are more than two hundred Draculoid titles (and the rate at which new.ones appear is accelerating), it is nearly impossible to make a sensible filmography.- The old Hamilton Deane—John Balderston stage version of the play is a staple of provincial and repertory theatres; musical Draculas occasionally make their appearance. There are Dracula dolls, Dracula comics (in which, notably, Dracula is a “good guy’). With all of that—no doubt\n\nbecause of that—Bram Stoker's splendid fiction Dracila is not yet a thoroughly respect-\n\nable literary work. Cultivated readers of the book, like Anthony Boucher who obviously loved and appreciated it, are willing to concede that “it is . . .a masterpiece of a kind, if not a literary one.” Montague Summers, nearly forty years before Boucher, would concede to Stoker only brilliantly selected subject matter and occasionally “admirable” writing.\n\nx\n\nTHE\n\nANNOTATED\n\nDRACULA\n\nSummers, himself an exhaustingly copious writer on anything to do with vampires, and author of the book The Vampire: His Kith and Kin, admired the first four chaptersof Dracula but wished that “the whole story [could] have been sustained at so ner a level.” “Then,” says Summers, “we should have had a complete masterpiece [p.: Let me say at once that we dave a complete masterpiece, flawed here and there, as the Chinese insist masterpieces should be, but, nevertheless, the real thing. What those flaws are will be readily apparent. Stoker was a hasty writer with the habits of a hack. He was, too, overendowed with the sensibility of his age, which means that every so often passages, even whole chapters, grow soft or moist with too much feeling or insufficient characterization; but to dwell on the book’s flaws in a brief introduction to the Annotated Dracula is as much a critical error as it is a bad tactic. More to the point is a short overview of the literary context in which Dracula appears and then some comment both on Stoker himself and on the way his great fiction sustains its power.\n\n- Dracula is a Gothic romance, a species of writing that first appeared in England in the mid-eighteenth century and which flourished in the late eighteenth and early\n\nnineteenth centuries. The typical Gothic romance has a beautiful young woman in it, who is pursued by wicked, dark, usually Italian, men whose intentions are strictl dishonorable. Her flight takes her to a variety of dismal or dangerous places: subterranean corridors, vaults, crypts, ruins, caves, secret rooms, graveyards. Usually the young _ woman is well-bred, sensitive, frail. Clearly, she deserves a better fate than the one that\n\nthreatens her, and it almost goes without saying that she is rescued from it (sometimes\n\nrepeatedly) by a handsome but sexually unthreatening young man with whom, as the book closes, she settles down to live| happily ever after. It is a genre of fiction easy enough to poke fun at, but its finest practitioners have produced works that have either endured or that are frequently rediscovered. _ The great authors of Gothic fiction before Stoker mostly lived in the eighteenth century. Horace Walpole’s The Castle of Otranto, which was published on Christmas Eve in\n\n1764, is usually credited with being the “first” Gothic romance. The Castle of Otranto is the\n\nwork of an antiquarian with a feverish brain, “who”—as I say in A Dream of Dracula—“could imagine for himself (and build) a stone and plaster castle jam-packed with medieval scraps of glass, statuary and armor. It was called Strawberry Castle, and was a quaint structure with towers, battlements, and saints in imitation Gothic windows,\n\nvaulted roof, balustrades, stairways [ pp. 153-54] . . .” Walpole tells us that his book had its origin in a dream “of which all I could recover was that I had thought myself in an\n\nancient castle . . . and that on the upper most bannister of a great staircase I saw a gigantic hand in armor. In the evening,I sat down to write. . . .” The Castle of Otranto is hardly a moving work, but it does have the ambience and the ma machinery that were to characterize Gothic fiction in the years to come. Harry Ludlam, Stoker’s biographer, who\n\nlikes Otranto more than I do, says that it\n\n_\n\nhad doors with rusty hinges, a trapdoor, and lamps extinguishable in a wink. It had a superb villain in Manfred, who, discovering his only son dead on his wedding morning——dashed to pieces beneath an enormous helmet—determined to marry his son’s bride, Isabella, so that his line should not become extinct. His own wife, Hippolita, he planned to confine in a convent [p. 181].\n\nFor Ludlam, the novel ends i in a “roaring climax in which a hundred men 1 appeared bearing a huge sabre, and a portrait walked out of its frame.” I am myself fond of Otranto without being either moved or surprised by it. It seems precisely the sort of novel a neurasthenic antiquarian with bad dreams and plenty of time on his hands would write in two months time “without knowing in the least what [he] intended to:say or to relate.”\n\nWith Ann Radcliffe’s The Mysteries of Udolpbo (1794), we have the first fully realized\n\nGothic romance in the history of the genre. Despite itsits sometimes endless descriptions of\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nplaces to which its author had never been; despite lapses into fifth-rate poetry; despite even its author’s insistence on demystifying her first-rate mysteries, the work has a\n\ncompelling fascination that commands respect. And if inUdolpbo's genteel certitudes about\n\nterror we care what happens to Emily St. Aubert as she is pursued by Montoni the tyrant, how much more avid is our interest in the heroine of Ann Radcliffe’s even more successful The Italian (1797). That young woman’s enemy is fouler, blacker, and more consummately evil than Montoni, with the added horror that the monster turns out to be (and then not to be) her father. If there is a hint of incest in The Italian, it appears in flagrante in Matthew G. Lewis’s The Monk (1796). Lewis, at nineteen, as Walpole did at forty-seven, wrote his book at top speed, finishing it in the space of ten weeks. The Monk is a work of wonderful adolescent gusto. The young Lewis intensely enjoyed the lustful and violent extravagances of his villain, Ambrosio, and devoted himself to giving them to us in every macabre and delicious detail. Since Ambrosio is made to begin his career of villainy after having led a life of blameless chastity for thirty years, one is right to suppose that the long-banked fires of evil that the seductions of the beautiful Rosario-Matilda cause to flame up in him will blaze with an especial heat. And so they do. Before his career of iniquity is done, Ambrosio, once the saint of Madrid, has surrendered (one might better have said “squandered”) his virginity and become a practiced, if insatiable satyr. Inflamed, always inflamed by beauty, he murders what turns out to be his mother so that he can enjoy what turns out to be his sister. That frenzied consummation with an unconscious fifteen-year-old girl takes place “by the side of three putrid half-corrupted bodies” in a charnel house beneath a Capuchin monastery in Madrid. Charles Maturin’s Melmoth the Wanderer (1820), a work of greater depth, though not greater intensity, has probably the most sustained, and certainly the most complex vision of any Gothic fiction—not excepting Dracula. Melmoth is a vast work of nearly unrelieved somberness that follows the adventures of Melmoth who, at the cost of his own soul, purchases a one-hundred-and-fifty-year life-span only to learn in the most bitter way that he has only purchased an opportunity for more and more loathsome experience in a world that was monstrous from the start. Melmoth is replete with Gothicisms: dungeons, whips, cannibalism, and truly monumental instances of personal dismay. What gives profundity to the fiction is the way in which Melmoth’s long _ adventure into the abyss that is the world becomes aniapparently accurate chart of the\n\ncost to mankind of original sin.\n\n|\n\nSo far, the works talked about have been those that helped to establish the Gothic tradition in English. It remains to notice a couple of books in the vampire vein to which Stoker undoubtedly paid some attention: John Polidori’s The Vampyre and Thomas Presket Prest’s Varney the Vampyre. Since neither of the stories, except as they relate to Dracula, have much to recommend them, one may pass over them quickly. John Polidori’s The Vampyr is, like The Monk, a young man’s book. Polidori wrote The Vampyre when he was twenty-four as a consequence of what Anthony Boucher called “that same splendid brainstorming session that also produced Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein.” On that famous summer evening in 1816, Byron suggested to the two Shelleys, to Polidori, and to\n\n“Monk” Lewis, who were all there in Geneva keeping out of the rain, that each of them\n\nwrite a horror tale in imitation of some “German stories of ghosts, which happened to fall into their hands.” The eighteen-year-old Mary Shelley and John Polidori were the only members of the group that followed through. Here, our interest is only in Polidori’s The Vampyre\n\n(1819),\n\nwhich\n\nintroduced\n\nto English literature the suave,\n\nwicked,\n\nand blood-\n\nthirsty Lord Ruthven whose “dead grey eye” fascinated his victims. The Vampyre is a work almost without merit, having neither memorable characters, a plot worth pursuing, nor any noticeable style. Its subject, on the other hand, made it a success, and the deadly hued Lord Ruthven, pursuing first the evanescent, beautiful Ianthe and later the\n\nXil\n\nTHE\n\nANNOTATED\n\nDRACULA\n\ngood-looking Aubrey’s sister, became well known in England and on the continent, particularly in one of the many stage versions of the story that appeared. Varney the Vampyre (1847), a work that has no literary pretensions, is for that reason much more fun to read. The book is an enthusiastic potboiler whose energy almost never lags. A couple of paragraphs from the first chapter of Varney convey almost everything one needs to know about the work except the vicissitudes of the plot, which are constructed on the same organizational principle as a mad seamstress’s workbasket. Here, then, are some passages from Varney. After that, each reader’s own taste—and endurance—must come into play. Prest writes: | . .. A shriek bursts from the lips of the young girl, and then, with eyes . fixed upon that window and with such an expression of terror upon her face, she\n\ntrembled, and the perspiration of intense fear stood upon her brow.\n\nA tall figure is standing . .. The lightning has set fire consuming building falls upon figure is there, still feeling for\n\non the ledge immediately outside the window. to a mill, and the reflection of the rapidly that long window. There can be no mistake. The an entrance, and clattering against the glass with\n\nits long nails. . . . A small pane of glass is broken, and the form from without introduces a long gaunt hand, which seems utterly destitute of flesh. The\n\nfastening is removed, and one half of the window, which opens like folding doors, is swung wide open upon its hinges. . .. The figure turns half round, and the light falls upon the face. It is perfectly white—perfectly bloodless. The eyes look like polished tin; the lips are\n\ndrawn back, and the principal feature next to those dreadful eyes is the teeth\n\n—the fearful looking teeth—projecting like those of some wild animal, hideously, glaringly white, and fang-like. It approaches the bed with a strange, gliding movement... . . | With a sudden rush that could not be foreseen—with a strange howling cry that was enough to awaken terror in every breast, the figure seized the long tresses of her hair, and twining them round his bony hands he held her to the bed. Then she screamed . . . Shriek followed shriek in rapid succession . . . Her beautiful rounded limbs quivered with the agony of her soul. The glassy, horrible eyes of the figure ran over that angelic form with hideous satisfaction . . . He drags her head to the bed’s edge. He forces it back by the long hair still entwined in his grasp. With a plunge he seizes her neck in his fang-like teeth—a gush of blood, and a hideous sucking noise follows. The girl bas swooned, and the vampyre is at bis hideous repast | pp. 3-4]! The villain making that hideous sucking noise is Sir Francis Varney whose deeds and misdeeds race on and on over 220 chapters distributed among 868 double-columned closely printed pages. Though Stoker took hints here and there from Varney, particularly for the great Lucy-staking episode in chapter XVI, Dracula and Varney have almost nothing but their vampire theme in common. One needs finally to notice J. S. LeFanu’s fine vampire tale “Carmilla” which Stoker certainly read and from which he borrowed at least some erfects: Lucy Westenra’s dreamlike flight through the yew trees and her execution, presided over by two physicians in a family tomb, for instance. LeFanu, who, like Stoker, was an Irishman, died in 1873, twenty-six years before Dracula. “Carmilla” appeared in LeFanu’s most famous collection of short stories, J” a Glass Darkly, published a year before LeFanu’s death. Writing a muted and sedate prose, LeFanu tells the story of his vampire and her female victims with great skill. In “Carmilla” childhood memories, vampire terrors, and lesbian love are seen as through a bittersweet haze.\n\nThe\n\nstory\n\nis jewellike in construction:\n\nthere is still a world\n\nof difference\n\nbetween\n\nsmall, luminous, it and\n\nStoker’s\n\nintense.\n\nSuccessful\n\nmasterpiece.\n\nas it is,\n\nWhat distinguishes Dracula from the vampire fictions that preceded it, as well as from those that subsequently appeared, is the way in which folklore and authentic history\n\nVARNEY, [THE\n\nTHE FEAST A\n\nVAMPYRE OF\n\n‘\n\nTHE FEAST OF BLOOL.\n\n83\n\nBLOOD\n\nBomance,\n\n| |\n\n| |\n\n| ove\n\nR give up thelr dead, Asie how ae red ghHeel ralanece gtowa\n\n| |\n\n—\" — THE HAIL-ATORM. — qae aymen’, OFUL VISITOR.—THE VAMPYR\n\n| |\n\noa solemn ex of an old a clock tie ie midnight—the air is thick and heavy—a strange, death-like stillness petvadea all nature.

How did he find what he used? Harry Ludlam, his biographer, tells us that the impetus for the making of the book came to him in a nightmare brought on “from a too generous helping of dressed crab at supper one night. . . .” In that dream, we are told, Stoker saw “a vampire king rising from the tomb to go about his ghastly business.” But a private British dream is not enough foundation on which to build a master work of fiction—as The Castle of Otranto ought to prove. Evidently Stoker’s genius, which had been in hiding for so many years, also knew this and sent him to the British Museum where, following a lead provided him by a Hungarian friend, Arminius Vambery, he found what he needed: first, an authentic vampire folklore; second, a dreadful historic figure named Viad Dracula, or, as he was also called, Vlad Tepes, the Impaler; and third, a place that incorporated them both—Transylvania, The Land Beyond the Forest. Vampire\n\nlore, one must\n\ninsist, 1s not restricted to Transylvania.\n\nHelsing properly says in his ridiculous English:\n\nAs\n\nDr.\n\nVan\n\nLet me tell you, he is known everywhere that men have been.

In short, as I like to say, vampires have appeared almost everywhere that men\n\nXIV\n\nTHE\n\nhave bled.\n\nIt is true, however,\n\nANNOTATED\n\nthat in Central\n\nEurope,\n\nand\n\nDRACULA\n\nparticularly in Transylvania,\n\nwhich was for centuries a battleground between Turks and Christians, there is a heavy Christian overlay on the pagan content of vampire legendry, a fact that Stoker seized upon eagerly and exploited well. Probably the richest single source of folklore information for him was Emily Gerard’s\n\nfine travel book,\n\nThe Land Beyond the Forest,\n\nwhich,\n\nin addition to giving him\n\na\n\nlively and extraordinarily circumstantial account of daily life in Transylvania circa 1888, is crammed with information about its history and folkways. In Miss Gerard’s book he could read that: More decidedly evil is the mosferatu, or vampire, in which every Roumanian peasant believes as firmly as he does in heaven or hell . . . even a flawless pedigree will not insure any one against the intrusion of a vampire into their family vault, since every person killed by a nosferatu becomes likewise a vampire after death, and will continue to suck the blood of other innocent persons till the spirit has been exorcised by opening the grave of the suspected person, and either driving a stake through the corpse, or else firing a pistol-shot into the coffin . . . In very obstinate cases of vampirism it is recommended to cut off the head and replace it in the coffin with the mouth filled with garlic, or to extract the heart and burn it, strewing its ashes over the grave [ pp. 185-86]. If Transylvanian folklore is already Gothic enough, its history, particularly of the fifteenth century, is even more so. Vlad Tepes, voivode of Wallachia, which he ruled briefly in 1448,\n\nfrom\n\n1456 to 1462,\n\nand for two\n\nmonths\n\nin 1476,\n\nwas one of Europe’s\n\nbloodiest tyrants. His life and character (if that is the right word for it) have recently been the subject of a popular study, In Search of Dracula, by Professors Raymond T. McNally and Radu Florescu, in which Vlad’s life and cruelties are probed. Tepes, it is certain, was a boundlessly dreadful man. What else can one think of a prince who conducted his own St. Bartholomew’s Day Massacre in the course of which “some 30,000 persons were probably killed.” Florescu and McNally tell us that Vlad’s\n\nTHE\n\nIMPALER.\n\nnao x\n\nMINN 4\n\na\\\\ZZS\n\nN\n\nZ\n\nLS Pr)\n\ni\n\nVLAD\n\n|\n\nMa\n\nsa\n\nEe\n\na}\n\n———\n\n}\n\n=\n\n=\n\n— ———\n\nr\n\nAS}\n\nact\n\ncrimes, the refinements of his cruelty . . . deserve a chapter unto themselves. Impalement, hardly a new method of torture, was his favorite method of imposing death. A strong horse was usually harnessed to each leg of the victim,\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n|\n\nXW\n\nwhile the stake was carefully introduced so as not to kill instantly. . . . Such quick deaths would have interfered with the pleasure he sought in watching their agonies over a period of time, as the stakes were propped in the ground. ‘This torture was often a matter of hours, sometimes a matter of days. . . .\n\n_\n\nThere were also various geometric patterns in which the impaled were\n\ndisplayed. Usually the victims were arranged in concentric circles, and in the outskirts of cities where they could be viewed by all. There were high spears and low spears, according to rank. There was impalement from above—feet upwards; and impalement from below—head upwards; or through the heart or navel. _ There were nails in people’s heads, maiming of limbs, blinding, strangulation, burning, the cutting of noses and ears, and of sexual organs in the case o\n\nwomen, scalping and skinning, exposure to the elements or to the wild animals, and boiling alive [ pp. 45461\n\n|\n\nAnd that list of Vlad’s abominations neither exhausts their number nor includes all _ their varieties. And yet there have been historians like ‘Colonel Leon Lamouche who can\n\nwrite that “Vlad was, nevertheless, an energetic, skillful prince, and his cruelty, which certainly was not always understandable, had at least the result that it made order reign in\n\nWallachia and it completely suppressed brigandage, which before him was commonplace.” One thing must be granted to him—if it matters. Vlad Tepes. was not a va pire. . That attribute was given him by Bram Stoker who, it seems to me, saw the proper _ metaphor lurking in the man. Taking his cue from the European lore of the vampire in\n\nwhich the vampire is seen as having a tainted soul, Stoker invested Vlad Dracula with it for the sake of his fiction. In the circumstances, it hardly seems libelous. How often is a mother’s estimate of her son’s achievement confirmed by history? Rarely, one may be certain, and yet, here is Charlotte Stoker writing to her son Bram on the occasion of the publication of Dracula, as quoted in Ludlam’s biography: My dear, [Dracula] is splendia, a thousand miles beyond anything you~\n\nhave written before, and I feel certain will place you very high in the writers of the da No book since Mrs. Shelley’s Frankenstein or indeed any other at all has come near yours in originality, or terror—Poe is nowhere [pp. 108-9].\n\nMrs. Stoker was right on target. Her son had indeed written a uniquely terrifying book.\n\nAnd one would like to know a great deal about the sort of person he was. Unfortunately, a full discussion of Bram Stoker’s life is not yet possible. _ 7 Harry Ludlam’s Biography of Dracula, whose subtitle is The Life Story of Bram Stoker, _ while it is useful enough as.a sort of public record of the events in which Stoker was involved, leaves essentially unexplored those aspects of his private life about which we are likely to be most curious. Ludlam’s bias is in favor of what is immediately visible to a not — very scrutinizing eye: As a result, in Ludlam’s pages, Stoker comes across as part boy _\n\nscout, part Horatio Alger hero, and more than a small part Victorian boor. All the crucial\n\nquestions that are raised by the recorded facts of Stoker’s life as well as those raised by his ~ work, Ludlam is unwilling either to notice or to answer. For example, the most enigmatic\n\nrelationship of Stoker’s life is, presumably, the one he had with the actor Henry Irving — who was both his employer and his friend. Though that complex and charged friendship is touched upon, it is not explored beyond the banalities of true-blue loyalty and devotion. Stoker’s relationships with his wife (about whom one would also like to know a great deal), his mother and father, and his son are similarly left politely unexplored: There is reason to hope that a biography of Stoker by his great-nephew, Daniel Farson, which is scheduled for publication in England late in 1975, will fill in the gaps left by a\n\ntoo-respectful Ludlam. | | : _’ ° Meanwhile, we must be grateful to Ludlam for having assembled the public facts\n\nof Stoker’s life, which, briefly, are as follows: Stoker was born in 1847 in Dublin, the © third son of seven children. His father, Abraham Stoker (for whom Bram was named),\n\nXVi\n\nTHE\n\nANNOTATED\n\nDRACULA\n\nwas an Irish civil servant who worked in the Chief Secretary’s Office at Dublin Castle. Bram was a sickly child who was not able to stand upright, as he tells us, until he was seven years old. He recovered from his childhood illnesses and grew into such vigorous, athletic young manhood that he could later claim of himself, “in fact I feel justified in saying I represented in my own person something of the aim of university education mens sana in corpore sano . . . .” Stoker graduated with honors in mathematics from Trinity College, Dublin, but when he left school he pursued a longtime interest in writing and the theatre by taking on an unpaid job as drama critic for the Dublin Mail while, at the same time, he followed in his father’s footsteps in the Irish civil service. en, in his twenty-ninth year, he met Henry Irving. The meeting changed both their lives. Stoker followed the famous\n\nactor to London\n\nand not long afterward he became\n\nIrving’s confidante and the actor-manager of his theatre, a job he held for twenty-eight years, until Irving’s death. For Stoker, they were years of extraordinary busyness in the course of which, he tells us, he wrote in Irving’s name “nearer half a million than a BRAM\n\nSTOKER,\n\nA SKETCH\n\nBY W.\n\nW.\n\nDENSLOW.\n\nBRAM STOKER, AN 1885 SKETCH.\n\ny\n\nPaar a I\n\n*\n\n‘ ’ f ? if ul f al Pi\n\n¢ yigts?\n\n44\n\nELLEN\n\nTERRY\n\nWITH\n\nSIR HENRY\n\nIRVING.\n\nELLEN\n\nTERRY\n\nAND\n\nSIR HENRY\n\nIRVING\n\nIN TENNYSON S\n\nBECKET.\n\nquarter of a million letters.” The quality of Stoker’s life in Irving’s service is perhaps conveyed in the following description given in A Dream of Dracula: The\n\ntall, handsome,\n\nvigorous\n\nIrishman\n\nwas henceforth\n\na familiar figure\n\nbefore the doors of the Lyceum theater. Maybe what drew Stoker to the task (in addition to Irving) was the opportunity it gave him to move about in the cosmopolitan ambience of the glittering London that whirled around Irving. For a provincial young Irishman, not thoroughly convinced of his own talents, there may have been some psychic nourishment in being always within sight and sound of greater men than himself. Irving’s son Laurence writes that “to Stoker, these illustrious patrons, whom he welcomed on their arrival in the foyer, were the breath of life; Irving, who dismissed them with his blessing from the stage, found that they made him depressed and nervous.” Or, in addition to the excitement of the life of the theater, Stoker was pleased to find an outlet for the bureaucratic and organizational talents [he had]. . . . Laurence Irving tells us that the great actor’s “retinue of fifty-four included the players necessary for these productions and the key men in all the departments of stage management. The organization of this imposing caravan was left to Bram Stoker; it was the kind of work he thoroughly enjoyed and at which he excelled” [p. 253]. That fascination with small detail also shows up in Dracula where both Jonathan and Mina Harker have railroad timetables much on their minds. | | On October 13, 1905, Sir Henry Irving died in the hall of the Midland Hotel, London. Two minutes later Bram Stoker arrived to do his friend one last service—he closed the dead man’s eyes. In the seven years that remained of Stoker’s life, he produced The Personal Reminiscences of Sir Henry Irving, a two-volume work, as well as two novels, The Lady of the Shroud and The Lair of the White Worm, plus a volume of short stories, and some periodical writing. The Lady of the Shroud has a seven-foot-tall hero and some fake vampirism in it, but mostly the book is a sort of Tom Swift-and-His-Private-Ruritania\n\nXViii\n\n|\n\nTHE\n\nANNOTATED\n\nDRACULA\n\n_\n\nfiction set in the Land of the Blue Mountains where both the good guys and the villairis speak elevated prose and where, very likely, the first airplane bombardment in literary history takes place. The Lair of the White Worm is not much better as fiction, but the novel’s plot and tone give one a good deal to think about regarding those of Stoker’s perplexities that his biographer Ludlam avoided confronting. Ludlam summarizes the\n\nLair as follows:\n\n,\n\nThe White Worm of the story was one of those monsters which had _ secreted itself for thousands of years in a well of uncommon depth . . . creature had so developed its brain and powers as to be able to project itself in the form of a woman, a woman in white with low and sibilant voice and long, flexible hands, from whose path all common snakes fled.\n\nSo far so good. But the plot that resulted in the snake woman Lady Arabella, being unmasked and her lair dynamited by a resourceful young hero, introduced a number of other weird, incredible characters that moved through the story like evil cardboard figures in a macabre toy theatre [p. 149].\n\nHarry Ludlam, commenting en Dracula, has written: Critics, psychologists and others have laboured over earnest examinations of — suspected deeper, hidden meanings behind Stoker’s chilling horror. The genial, red-bearded giant would have laughed loud at such high-flown nonsense |p. 8]. The trouble is that this very same genial red-bearded giant wrote both Dracula Lair of the White Worm. \\n Dracula the fear of and fascination with women is a theme of the fiction. In the Lair of the White Worm the fear and fascination are horrid presences. Both books, earnestly examined, make one wonder just how Bram Stoker’s inner life could have been.\n\nand the pulsating writhing, genial\n\nAnthony Boucher, in his introduction to the Heritage Edition (the only one ever illustrated, incidentally) of Dracula asks: “How did the most successful horror novel in the English (and possibly in any) language come to be written by a man whose first published book was entitled The Duties of Clerks of Petty Sessions in Ireland?” One might extend the question to inquire how Dracula came to be written by the same man who wrote such arch fictions as The Snake’s Pass, The Watter’s Mou’, The Shoulder of Shasta, The Mystery of the Sea, and The Lady of the Shroud. Anthony Boucher, shrewdly, did not try to answer his question, and I have no intention of answering mine. Literary greatness is easier to acknowledge than to explain. It is enough that the world was lucky; that something gathered in Bram Stoker that made it possible for him to make one—and only one—work whose central figure could become an overwhelming symbol of the crimes and temptations of the twentieth century. As I said in my Dream of Dracula: . . . Dracula. Our eidolon . . . He is huge, and we admire size; strong, and we admire strength. He moves with the confidence of a creature that has energy, power, and will. Granted that he has energy without grace, power without responsibility, and that his will is an exercise in death. We need only to look a little to one side to see how tempting is the choice he makes: available immortalsee]. has.collected on the devil’s bargain: the infinitely stopped moment [p. 302 |. : For this, Faust was willing to risk damnation. Here, then, is the figure that Bram Stoker created—a figure who confronts us with primordial mysteries: death, blood, and love, and how they are bound together. Finally, Stoker’s achievement is this: he makes us understand in our own experience why the vampire is said to be invisible in the mirror. He is there, but we fail to recognize him since our own faces get in the way.\n\nDRACULA BY\n\nBRAM\n\nSTOKER\n\nWESTMINSTER ARCHIBALD\n\nCONSTABLE\n\nAND\n\n2 WHITEHALL GARDENS 1897\n\nCOMPANY\n\nTO MY\n\nDEAR\n\nFRIEND\n\nHOMMY-BEG!\n\nHALL\n\nCAINE.\n\n1 Hommy-Beg.

In the Christian world other saintly dragon killers besides St. George include St. Philip the Apostle, St. Martha, St. Florent, St. Cado, St. Maudent, St. Michael, St. Margaret, and St. Clement. St. George, however, is clearly the star performer, and deserves some comment. Mrs. Cornelia S. Hulst (quoted in Ingersoll, p. 186) neatly summarizes the life story of this “essentially mythical saint” as follows: “ “According to Be [ this Shae ae was born, about A.D. 285, of noble parents in Cappadocia, eastern Abus As he grew to antes he became a soldier; his courage in battle soon won him promotion, and he was attached to the personal staff of the emperor Diocletian.

Finally she went down on her knees and implored me not to go; at least to wait a day or two before starting. It was all very ridiculous, but I did not feel comfortable. However, there was business to be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it. I therefore tried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could, that I thanked her, but my duty was imperative, and that I must go. She then rose and dried aig eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to I did not know what to do, for, as an English Gectien, I have been taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous, and yet it seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a state of mind.

The\n\nearliest narrative of his martyrdom known to us is full of the most extravagant marvels: three times. George is put to death, chopped into small pieces, buried deep in the earth, and consumed by fire, but each time he is resuscitated by God. Besides this we have dead men brought to life to be baptized, wholesale conversions, including that of the “Empress Alexandra,” armies and idols destroyed simultaneously, beams of timber suddenly bursting into leaf, and finally, milk flowing instead of blood from the martyr’s severed head.’ ”\n\nfy\n\n8\n\nTHE\n\nIn the more familiar dragon-slaying tale George comes to the town of Silene in Libya. Near the town there is a pond in which a dragon lives; for years it has exacted a dreadful toll, first of livestock, then of sons and daughters of the inhabitants. Finally, the king’s daughter, chosen by lot, is turned loose near the pond where “dressed in her best, and nerved by high resolve” she waits for the dragon Fortunately for her, she meets George the valiant knight, and, though she warns him to “fly! fly! Sir knight,” his only answer is the sign of the cross. Then he advances to meet “the horrible fiend . First he transfixes it, then, when the princess silees her girdle around it, she is able to lead the monster “like a docile hound.” mun the ae beast serving as a parable, George is able convert twenty thousand people to Christianity, oe which he cuts the dragon’s head o In this tale, as in wihias Christian at tales, the\n\ndragon represents Satan. And he does in Stoker’s\n\nfiction, as well, if we remember shes Dracul in Romanian means both “dragon” and “devil.” Among other delightful things Stoker would have found in Paget’s Hungary and Transylvania would be the information that near the village of Babakay, on the Hungarian side of the Danube, travelers were shown the very cave of “the Dragon slain by St. George, and where, they say, the foul carcass still decays, and, like Virgil’s ox, gives birth to a host of ee things.” for St. George’s Eve, Montague Summers aoe pp. 311-13) gives us Romanian lore about that occasion as follows: “Throughout the whole of Eastern Europe, indeed, the feast of S. George, 23 April, is one of the most important celebrations of the whole year . upon the eve of the saint the power of vannpiees, witches and every evil thing is at its height. Among the Ruthenians of Bukowina and Galicia the farmer’s wife gathers great branches of thorn to lay on the threshold of her house and every door is painted with a cross in tar to protect it from the witches. The Huzuls kindle large bonfires for their houses for the same reason whilst throughout Transylvania, Walachia, and Bulgaria precautions of various kinds are similarly taken. .. . On the morrow, 23 April, the house is garlanded with flowers, chaplets of roses decorate the stalls and the horns of the cows are wreathed with blossom in honour of the saint. ... In Roumania upon these particular days when the vampire is most malicious the country folk anoint the windows with garlic, they tie bundles of garlic on the door and in the cow sheds. All lights throughout the house must be extinguished and it is = that every ional should be turned topsy-turvy.” As for the buried treasure, that too is a standard ingredient of dragon lore. Beowulf, it will be remembered, killed a three-hundred-year-old serpent that guarded a great treasure. Apparently, the\n\nANNOTATED\n\nDRACULA\n\nsources for this kind of legendry are to be found in the burial practices of precivilized tribes that often buried their important men (along with such treasures as their heroes might need wherever they were going) in caves or barrows in which, naturally, snakes also took ner (See chapter II, note 16, on “the blue flames.’’) 28 midnight.

When it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the passengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after the other, as though urging him to further speed. He lashed the horses unmercifully with his long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on to further exertions. Then through the darkness I could see a sort of patch of grey light ahead of us, as though there were a cleft in the ills. The excitement of the passengers grew greater; the crazy coach rocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like a boat tossed on a stormy sea. Ihadtoholdon. The road grew more level, and we appeared to fly along. Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each side and to frown down upon us; we were entering on the Borgo Pass. One by one several of the passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed upon me with an earnestness which would take no denial; these were certainly of an odd and varied kind, but each was given in simple good faith, with a kindly word,\n\nS\n\nTOWARD\n\na\n\nVIEW\n\nments which I had seen outside the hotel at Bistritz—the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye. Then, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each side the passengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the darkness. It was evident that something very exciting was either happening or expected, but though I asked each passenger, no one would give me the slightest explanation. This state of excitement kept on for some little time; and at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on the eastern side. There were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the air the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder. It seemed as though the mountain range had separated two atmospheres, and that now we had got into the thunderous one. I was now myself looking out for the conveyance which was to take me to the Count.\n\nJONATHAN\n\nHARKER’S\n\nEach moment I expected to see the glare of lamps through the blackness; but all was dark. The only light was the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from our harddriven horses rose in a white cloud.

I was already thinking what I had best do, when the driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which I could hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so lowa tone; I thought it was “An hour less than the time.” Then turning to me, he 46 said in German worse than my own :— “There is no carriage here. The Herr is not expected after all. He will now come on to Bukovina, and return to-morrow or the next day; better the next day.” hilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and snort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up. Then, amongst a chorus of screams from the peasan:s and a universal crossing of themselves, a caléche, with four horses, drove up behind us, overtook us, and drew up beside the coach.

I could only see the leam of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red in the lamplight, as he turned to us. He said to the driver:— ‘“‘You are early to-night, my friend.” The man stammered in reply :— v a English Herr was in a hurry,” to which the stranger replied :— ‘ That is why, I suppose, you wished him to go on to Buko-\n\nA CALECHE.\n\n47 tall man. No doubt this is a manifestation of Dracula himself, though the brown beard is wrong. Throughout the fiction, Dracula’s eyes are spoken of as having a red gleam in them. Though we are never told precisely what color his eyes are, it is worth noting that in Greece vampires were likely to have blue eyes. In Romania the cold gaze of a vampire looking at a pregnant woman could result in the birth of another vampire.\n\nvina. You cannot deceive me, my friend; I know too much, and my horses are swift.” As he spoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth, with very red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory. One of my companions whispered to another the line from Burger’s “ Lenore ;”— ‘* Denn die Todten reiten schnell ”—\n\n(‘* For the dead travel fast.”)\n\nThe strange driver evidently heard the words, for he looked up with a gleaming smile. The passenger turned his face away, at the same time putting out his two fingers and crossing himself. ‘Give me the Herr’s luggage,” said the driver ; and with exceeding alacrity my bags were handed out and put in the caléche. Then I descended from the side of the coach, as the caléche was close alongside, the driver helping me with a hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel; his strength must have been prodigious. Without a word he shook his reins, the horses turned, and we swept into the darkness of the Pass. As I looked back I saw the steam from the horses\n\nof the coach by the light of the lamps, and projected against\n\nit the figures of my late companions ‘crossing themselves. Then the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses, and off they swept on their way to Bukovina. s they sank into the darkness I felt a strange chill, and a lonely feeling came over me; but a cloak was thrown over my\n\nA\n\n48 “Denn die Todten reiten schnell’ —Burger’s poem “Lenore” has in it all the Gothic machinery of the German Schauerroman: the young woman waiting for her bridegroom Wilhelm who is away at King Frederick’s wars. When he delays his return, she reproaches him with faithlessness. Suddenly there is the clatter of horse’s hooves, and Wilhelm is there; he takes her up on his horse and they ride off at © midnight on a strange wild ride. It takes the reader hardly any time at all to learn that Wilhelm, though he clasps his bride fiercely, is dead, and that he and Lenore will plight their troth only in the grave. he line Harker is quoting is reiterated as a chorus line five times through the poem. The first time it reads: ‘““‘We and the dead ride fast.” Then, three other times, it is ““Hurrah! The dead ride fast.” And finally, the line is simply, “The dead ride fast.” At no time is it “For the dead travel fast.” Burger’s poem was published in German in 1773 and was rendered into English in 1796 by William of Norwich. Montague Summers, in his The Vampire: His Kith and Kin (pp. 275-76), discusses the tremendous popularity the poem had among the Romantic poets. In Germany the poem became a household word. ;\n\n14\n\nTHE\n\nANNOTATED\n\nexcellent German :—\n\nSO over and over the same ground. The dreamlike mood of this journey serves a mythic purpose. Harker’s passage from light to dark at the very\n\nbeginning of the fiction will be replayed later as the\n\nbook reaches its climax. Stoker may also be remembering Mephistopheles’s remark to Faust (p. 127) that “the fool who speculates on things is like some animal on a dry heath led by an evil fiend in endless circles.” For the moment it is enough to note that Harker’s\n\nascent to the castle is a sort of mirror reverse of\n\ncertain classical descents Proserpine’s, Orpheus’s.\n\ninto\n\nhell:\n\nOdysseus’s,\n\nS11 within a few minutes of midnight.

I think had there been any alternative I should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that unknown night\n\njourney. The carriage went at a hard pace straight along, then we made a complete turn and went along another straight road. It seemed to me that we were simply going over an over the same ground again; and so I took note of some salient point, and found that this was so. I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, but I really feared to do so, for I thought that, placed as I was, any protest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to delay. By-and-by, however, as I was curious to know how time was passing, I struck a match, and by its flame looked at my watch ; it was within a few minutes of midnight. This gave me a sort of shock, for I suppose the general superstition\n\nabout midnight was increased by my recent experiences, waited with a sick feeling of suspense.\n\nI\n\nThen a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road—a long, agonised wailing, as if from fear. The sound was taken up by another dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind which now sighed softly through the Pass, a wild howling began, which seemed to come from all over the country, as far as the imagination\n\ncould grasp it through the gloom of the night.\n\nAt the first\n\nhowl the horses began to strain and rear, but the driver spoke to them snothingly, and they quieted down, but shivered and sweated as though after a run-away from sudden fright. Then, far off in the distance, from the mountains on each side of us began a louder and a sharper howling—that of wolves—which\n\naffected both the horses and myself in the same way—for I\n\nwas minded to jump from the caléche and run, whilst they reared again and plunged madly, so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them from bolting. In a few niinutes, however, my own ears got accustomed to the sound, and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able to descend and to stand before them. He petted and sovthed them, and whispered something in their ears, as I have heard of horse-tamers doing, and with extraordinary effect, for under his caresses they became quite manageable again, though they still trembled. ‘The driver again took his seat. and shaking his reins, started off at a great pace. This time, after going to the far side of the Pass, he suddenly turned down a narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right.\n\nSoon we were hemmed\n\nin with trees, which in places\n\narched right over the roadway till we passed as through a tunnel; and again great frowning rocks guarded us boldly on either side.

The keen wind stil] carried the howling of the dogs, though this grew fainter as we went on our way. The baying of the wolves sounded nearer and nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. I grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear; but the driver was not in the least disturbed. He kept turning his head to left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.\n\nSuddenly, away on our left,I saw a faint flickering blue\n\nflame. The driver checked the horses into the darkness. the howling of the the driver suddenly\n\nsaw it at the same moment; and, jumping to the ground, I did not know what to do, wolves grew closer; but while appeared again, and without\n\nhis seat, and we resumed our journey.\n\nhe at once disappeared the less as I wondered a word took\n\nJ think I must have\n\nfallen asleep and kept dreaming of the incident, for it seemed to be repeated endlessly, and now looking back, it is like a sort of awful nightmare. Once the flame appeared so near the road, that even in the darkness around us I could watch the driver’s motions. He went rapidly to where the blue flame arose —it must have been very faint, for it did not seem to illumine\n\nthe place around it at all—and gathering a few stones, formed\n\nthem into some device. Once there appeared a strange optical effect: when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it, for I could see its ghostly flicker all the same. This startled me, but as the effect was only momentary, I took it that my eyes deceived me straining through the darkness. Then for a time there were no blue flames, and we sped onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the oe around us, as though they were following in a moving circle. | At last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he had yet gone, and during his absence the horses began to tremble worse than ever and to snort and scream with fright. I could not see any cause for it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether; but just then the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind the jagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light I saw around us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues, with long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair. ‘Ihey were a hundred times more terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled. For myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of fear. It is only when a man feels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand their true import. All at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had some peculiar effect on them. The horses jumped about and reared, and looked helplessly round with\n\neyes that rolled in a way painful to see ; but the living ring of\n\nterror encompassed them on every side, and they had perforce to remain within it. I called to the coachman to come, for it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the ring and to aid his approach. I shouted and beat the side of the caléche, hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side, so as to give him a chance of reaching\n\n53 the trap.\n\nHow he came there, I know not, but I heard his\n\nJONATHAN\n\nHARKER’S\n\nvoice raised in a tone of imperious command, and looking towards the sound,\n\nsaw him stand in the roadway.\n\nAs he\n\nswept his long arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the wolves fell back and back further still.\n\nJust then a heavy cloud passed across the face of the moon, so that we were again in darkness. ‘When I could see again the driver was climbing into the caltche, and the wolves had disappeared.
