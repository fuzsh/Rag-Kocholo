What a mass of contradicticois is ioTolved in our constitution, in our church, in our universities ! How hard it is to discover the springs which influence the nation I How entangled are the ramifications of law, of literature, of science I We have all been made acquainted with this peculiarity in one vast branch through the terrible revelations of war. But it is, in fact, a part not only of ' the system,' as it is called, but of our character, of our situation. It is at once our curse and out blessing. Its dangers c%ui be guarded against, its advantages may be made the most of; but its root is deep in our very inmost being — we cannot lose it or change it without ceasing to be what we are or have been. To no point does this apply more truly than to our literature and theology. Go to France or Germany, and no man will be at a loss to tell you where the most learned, the most enlightened men of the country are to be found. They are members of the Institute ; they are lecturers in the College of Henri IV. ; they are Professors in the Universities. Here and there they may have risen to be Ministers of State. But such a rise has been through their. literary eminence ; and that eminence is illustrated, not superseded, by their new position. Every one knows where is the oracle at whose mouth he is to inquire. In England it is far otherwise. Now and then it may be that a great light in theology or history will burst forth at Oxford or Cambridge and draw all eyes to itself. But these are exceptions. Look over the roll of our literary heroes in ancient times or in present. Engaged in the distracting labours of the schbol-room, serving the tables of a bank, in the back room of a public office, in the sedu^on'of a rustic parish, are too often planted the men who in vou xcrvu. MO. cxcin. b Digitized by G Fraucc 2 Archdeacon Hare, France or Germany would have been enthroned on professorial chairs addressing themselves to the rising historians, philologers, or theologians of the age. The evil has been pointed out in the Report of the late Oxford G>mmis8ion, and may, we hope, be remedied to some extent by the new one ; for an evil un- doubtedly it is, that Archimedes should be without the standing- place from whence he might move the world. But there is a brighter side to this state of things which is not to be overlooked* It is a good that light should be diffused as well as concentrated ; that speculation and practice should be combined and not always isolated ; that genius should be at times forced into uncongenial channels and compelled to animate forms of life which else would be condemned to hopeless mediocrity. We have made these remarks because we are about to enter on a remarkable instance of their applicability. If any foreigner landing in England last year had asked where he should find the man best acquainted with all modem forms of thought here or on the Continent — where he should find the most complete collec- tion of the philosophical, theological, or historical literature of Germany — where he should find profound and exact scholar- ship combined with the most varied and extensive learning — what would have been the answer ? Not in Oxford — not in Cambridge — not in London. He must have turned far away from academic towns or public libraries to a secluded parish in Sussex, and in the minister of that parish, in an archdeacon of <me of the least important of English dioceses, he would have found what be sought. He would have found such an one there : he would now find such an one no more. For such was Julius Hare, late Rector of Herstmonceux and Archdeacon of Lewes. There are many in humble places and in high to whom, both on public and private grounds, a brief attempt to endeavour to sketch the life and character of such a man, to fix the position which he held in his generation towards his church and country, may not be unacceptable. ; , Julius Charles Hare was bom on the 13th of September, 1795. He was the third of four brothers, all more or less remarkable, and all united together by an unusually strong bond of fraternal affection — Francis, Augustus, Julius, and Marcus. Of these the eldest and the youngest have left no memorial behind ; but the two nearest in years and nearest in character cannot be mentioned together without noticing the one as well as the other. Augustus Hare will long be remembered by all who can recall the lofty and chivalrous soul, the firm yet gentle heart, which was so well repre- sented in his bearing and countenance. He will be loi^ remem- bered by those who never knew him through the t^o volumes of Digitized by LjOOg Semtons Arehdmicm Skre. Z 'Sennons t* a Constry Gmgregtttion,' which will probably be handed down to fvtinre generations as the first example of the great improrement of rand preaching in the nineteenth century —« as a striking proof of the effect which a refined and cultivated miod may have in directing the devotions and lives of the most simple and ignorant populations. But he will be reroembeied ako by the undying affection of his younger and more celebrated brother, exprcMed many a time and oft with a fervour and simplicity unusual in our countrymen — nowhere more strikingly than in the revised edition of the * Guesses at Truth by Two Brothers,' in which they first appeared before the world. ' Id truth, through the whole of this work I have been holding con- verse with him who was once the partner in it, as he was in all my thoughts and feelings, from the earliest dawn of both. He too is gone. But is he lost to me ? Oh no ! He whose heart was ever pouring forth a stream of love, the purity and inexhaustibleness of which betokened its heavenly origin, as he was ever striving to hfl me above myself, is still at my side, pointing my gaze upward. Only the love which was then hidden within him has now overflowed and transiigarad his whole beiog, and his earthly iorm is turned into that of an angel gS light' In his early training he owed much to his mother, a woman of great strength and beauty of character, daughter of Dr. Shipley, Bishop of St. Asaph, and his aunt, Lady Jones, widow of the famous Orientalist. A large portion of his boyhood and youth were spent abroad ; and to this must be in some mea- sire ascribed the foreign tinge which appeared, as well in the limplicity and impulsiveness of his character, as in his literary predilections. ^In 1811,' he playfully said, 'I saw the marie of Luther's ink on the walls of the castle of Wartbnrg ; and there I fiist learned to throw inkstands at the Devil.' Tins, as we shall afterwards see, expressed, in a fuller sense than that in which he had mtended it, the origin of much of his future labours — ^the infloeuoe exercised over his mind by Germany and its great Re* former. His regular education was begun at the Charterhouse, and he Aere fell in vrith one of those golden times which at successive intervals crown the harvests of schools and colleges as virell as of Ae natural work). The same generation of schoolboys numbered on its roll, besides his own, the names of Waddington, the accom- plished Dean of Durham, and of Grote and Thirlwall, the future historians of Greece, not to mention others less known to fame, hot whose strong practical abiliCies, or whose fresh and genial Bstnres, long retained a hold on the respect or the affection of their fellow Carthusians^ From the Charterhouse he went to Cambridge in 1812. His B 2 academical aoMlemtcal career was tenmhat^ by his election as Fellow of Trinity College in October, 1818 ( whither, after a short stadj of the legal profession, he returned in 1822, and entered on the office of Assistant Tutor of the G>llege. In the honouitd suc- cession of those who have occupied the princely chambers which open on the long green avenue of limes-*the glory of the Trinity Gardens — Julius Hare wUl always fill a distinguished place. To the twenty years which he passed at Trinity College he owed, as he says himself, * the building up of bis mind.' * Not only as a teacher, but as a student, he entered with all the ardour of his mind into the philologidil learning in which the University of Cambridge has always been pre-eminent. There, too, he laid the foundation of that German libranr which has now returned once more to the walls within which it was first begun. With his friend and coUefeigue, now Bishop of St David's, he there made accessible in 'an English garb the great work of Niebuhr, than which p^haps no historical work has ever had such an awakening and ' inspiring efTect on the minds of the generation to which it was offered. With the same eminent man he set on foot the ^ Philological Museum,' which shared the usual transitory fate of such learned periodicals, but which during the period of its existence ,|\\inushed more solid additions to English literature and scholamhip than any other of the kind that has appeared. But it was not from the intellectual aitpFfosphere of Cambridge that his mind received its most lasting . influences. There was the circle of his numerous and most distinguished friends. It has sometimes struck us that there was a strength and per* manence in the youthful friendships of that generation which we hardly find in our own. How far more strikingly does Arnold stand out from the background of his generation by reason of the group of faithful and loving, equals — equals no.t in character or genius, but in age and sympaiyhy — with wboi[p he i^ i^urrounded from first tp last. So too it was with Julius Hare. Remoyed by distance, by occupation, perhaps by opinions, fix>m alipoat all of them, he never forgot or was forgotten by them. Of I'hirlwall we have already spoken, in his exquisitely polished Essays on philology and history giving the promise of that calm, compre- hensive, imperturbable judgment which has made his Epiecopal Charges the chief oracles of the English Chprch for the last ten years. Sedgwick was there,, awakening, ^as, hip friend well ex- presses it, ^an almost afiectionale thankfulness' f for the delight ♦ Dedication of Sennont on the Viefbrjr of Faith. i Ouesset at Truth, 1st leries, 4th ed., p. S58. Digitized by GoOglC Which Arehd^Mm Hare, 5 whieh liis genial wit^uid eloquent cottrenation afforded ; yet more for the free and generous sympathy which, michilled by time, he if still at ready as ever to pour forth. Less known, but not to be fofgoHetty was die author of the ^ Broad Stone of Honour * and of '1%e Ages of Faith,' to that generation the chief representative of the admiration for medieval times which has since spread so wide, and so far overshot the legitimate reaction which was then unquestionably needed in their behalf. Perhaps the one to whom he looked back with the chiefest portion of gratitude was his pownful and vigorous colleague. Dr. Whewell — now the head of that illustrious College — ^through whose urg^cy he was mainly induced to exchange a legal for an academical course, a lay for a clerical profession. There was yet another and a more intimate circle which grew up round the Tutor of Trinity — the exceeding great reward of every cme sincerely engaged in the work of education, and, in the sense in which we here spe^ of it, the peculiar blessing of a college tutor — the circle of his pupils. Many there must be who look back with interest to the stores of knowledge which streamed forth in only too abundant profusion in that well-known lecture-room ; many who cherish a grateful and affectionate reverence for the memory of him wbp delighted to be not only the instructor, but the friend, of those young and aspiring minds with whom he was thus brought into contact ; — in whose very aspect they read a lehuke to all suggestions of evil, an enkindlement to purity and goodness. Three, however, require especial notice — three who to their connexion with him would probably have gladly confessed that they owed a great portion of that cultivation which has given them a place in the literature of their country, and on whom he in Tetom I<x>ked with a love, and in one instance at least with a reverence, which almost made one forget that the superiority of years and station, to speak of nothing more, was on his side, and not on theirs. There was the bold and generous, it may perhaps be added, the rash and eccentric, spirit of one whose stoiy, with hardly any incidents worth recording, has had the singular fate of being told by two of the most gifted men * of his time, and * We allode» of ooune, to the two biographies of John Sterling, b^ Archdeaoon Hare and Mr. Carlyle. Each is to be reckoned amonf^st the most interesting of its aathor^s writingg. It would be presomptuons to adjudicate between two snch aeii'j bat we cannot forbear to express our eonyiction that the view given of Sterling bv the Archdeacon is more correct than that giren by the historian of the Froich Revolution. It is very probable that the former has understated the amount of Sterling's doubts in his later years. But as to the mun point at issue Between the two eminent biographers— the reasons of Sterling's abandonment of Ae clerical profesoon— we have no doubt that the Archdeacon was right in •leribmg it to the nmple cause of ill health, which Mr. Carlyle maintains to have been 6 jbrMlsaeoa Hars. •nd who certftinlj left an impiieMioa oa all who ever heard hie eonrerse, such as €aB hardly be conceived by those who oqIj know him through the far inferior medium of his written words. There was the accomplished authcnr of the ^ Notes on the ParaUes,' who has the merit of having first recalled the course of English theology £rom patristic to exegetical studies, after the decUne and fi^l of the Oxford School, and who, more than any other of Hare's pupils, imbibed from him the accurate dia- crimination which has produced the series of delightful little volumes on ' Words,' * Proverbs,' and ^ the English Language.' Thope was finally the noble-hearted man, who, whatever may be thought of the obscurity of his style, the insufficiency of his arguments, or the erroneousness of some of his conclusions, is perhaps the best example that this age can show of that deep prophetic fervour, of that power of apostolic sympathy which awakens not the less becsAise it often fails to satisfy — which edifies not the less because it often fails to convince. We may not be able to go along with the vehement expressions of admiration for Mr. Maurice's works which fill the Archdeacon's pages, but we can well understand and honour the genuine en- thusiasm with which be laboured to bring all the world to agree with him in his estimate of his friend and pupil, and, as was afterwards the case, his near and dear kinsman. In 1832 the family living of Herstmonceux in Sussex became Vacant by the death of his uncle, and, his elder brother Augustus declining to leave the scene of his happy labours at Alton, the Rectory of Herstmonceux was offered to Julius. He at once accepted the charge, though we can easily imagine the pain with which the Fellow of Trinity exchanged the studies and the society of Cambridge for the active ministration and the retired Ufe of a country parish. It was in the interval between the acceptance of the living and his entrance on its duties that he enjoyed a year's absence on the Continent, mostly with his friend and ardent admirer, Walter Savage Laadc^, whose now celebrated ' Imaginary Conversations,' which contain some of the most beautiful writing in the language, he had himself been mainly instrumental in introducing to the English public In the course of this journey he first visited Rome, always an epoch in the life of any man who can think and feel, more especially to one whose Cambridge studies had necessarily drawn him into the careful study of the beginnings of Roman history, and been a mere pretext It so lumpens that we had ourselves ample opportunities of obsenring the working of Sterling's mind at the time in question, and we are per- suaded that, as his interest in his parochial work was intense, so his reluctance to abandon it was deep and unfeigned.

One carious incident is worth recording, which marked his stay at Rome. Whilst there he preached a sermon in the EngUsh chapel— ^treating of some of the feelings with which travellers oaght to be animated— <m the characteristic text, ^ What went ye out into the wilderness for to see ? A prophet ? yea, I say unto yon, and more than a prophet.' We will give the anecdote in his own words :— • ^From the subject ♦ it came home to the hearts of a part of the con- gregation, and in compliance with their wishes I endeavoured io obtain the consent of the Papal censor to its publication at Borne, havii^ received a hint that that consent would not be witbhdd. For I had been misunderstood — as was natural enough — in the passage where I termed Rome th\\s/atefid city, and had been supposed to have called it this faithful city ; whereupon, while some of my Protestant hearers were offended by Uie expression, rumour was busy in reporting that a sermon had been preacht at the English chapel speaking very favour- ably of Romanism. . . • . The imprimatur which I applied for was not refused ; but proceedings at Home are so dilatory, that months passed by, and I came away before it was obtained. Perhaps the delay was a civil substitute for a refusal.' He returned from Rome in the spring of 1834, bringing with him many costly works of art to adorn his new home. One of these, a Madonna of Raphael, which he bought at Florence, in a characteristic access of enthusiastic tenderness he in- sisted on carrying in his own hands over the long ascent of S. Gothard. And now he settled in the sphere of duty from which he never afterwards moved, and in which was afterwards associated with him the beloved and honoured partner of his later years, sister of his friend and pupil Frederick Maurice. Let us pause for a moment on a scene which became so much a part of himself and of his writings, that for all who knew him during the last twenty J ears of his life the recollections of Herstmonceux and of alius Hare were almost inseparable. • Prafiice to • Victory of F»th/ p. adi, ^ * Digitized byG00gl(^^ 8 ArcMeaam Hart. , On the edge of the long sweep of high land which encloses the marsh of Pevensey Level stretches the parish of lieirstmonceux,* so called from the ^ weald/ ^forest,' at^lmr$t\\ of.

But it would be to overlook a very curious, as well as most important and instructive, part of his career, if we were to forget to ask how this shrine of lesniing rose and flourished on what might have seemed the uncoi^enial soil of the Weald of Sussex — how the Cambridge scholar was united with the country pastor — what benefit the white-frocked pea^ sants. or the neighbouring clergy reaped from the appearance of a character or a home amongst them which could hanlly have been more unlike all around it had it been transplanted from another hemisphere. Those of our readers who have turned over the pages of the very interesting volume lately published on the reorganisation of the Civil Service, will remember the clever, though not altogether conclusive, ol]g'ection urged against 'the proposed reforms by the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department :* — ' ^ It may be instructive as well as amusing to inquire what would be the effect were my two immortal friends [Grote and Macaulay] to descend from the clouds, and assume for a few days the humble disguise of Home Office clerks. I very much fear the public would not discover the change. The more exact knowledge of the composition of the Spartan ^' Mora,\" or the Macedonian phalanx, would not peep out in a letter fixing the permanent staff of a regiment of militia ; the eloquence of the great historian of our constitutional liberties would not be recognised in a letter pointing out to a county magistrate that he had strained the provisions of the Vagrant Act. The gods would return to Olympus undetected, leaving no 6e6(TavroQ 6^fjL¥l behind.' May we venture to ask the same question as to another of Mr. Waddington's former schoolfellows ? would he, too, have returned undetected to his Cambridge Olympus, had the University thought fit to recall the most learned of her sons to occupy his fitting place amongst her professors ? or was there, even in these distant wilds, a sense of worth and power which they would else have never known ?

Coming to Herstmonceux ss he did — to the scene of his own early yesrs^-resnembered as a child bj the old inhabitants — honoured as the representative of a family long known amongst them — ^he was from the first bound to them, and they to him, by a link which years always riret with a strength of which both parties are often unoonscious till it is rent asunder. His own knoMrledge of their history, of their abodes, of their characters, perhaps in great measure from the same cause, was very remarkable; and although his visits to them might be comparatively few, yet theirs to the rectory w^e con** fttant, the more so beoEUise they were always sure to receive a ready welcome. Whatever might be the work in which he was empbyed, he at once laid it aside at the call of the humblest > parishioner, to advise, console, listen, assist. There was that, too, in his manner, in his words, in his voice and countenance^ which could not fail to impress even the dullest with a sense of troth, of determination, of uprightness— -yet more, with a sense of deep religious feeling, of abhorrence of sin, of k>ve of goodness^ of humble dependence on God. Such a feeling transpired in his ordinary conversation with them ; it transpired still more in the deep devotion with which he went through the various servicea of die church. ^ If you have never heard Julius Har^ read the Communion service,' was the expression of one who had been much struck, as indeed all weie, by his mode of reading this especial portion of the Liturgy, ^you do not know what the words of that service contain.' And in his sermons, needlessly long and provokingly inappropriate as they sometimes were, there were fix»m time to time passages so beautiful in themsdves, so oougenial to the time and place, that Herstmonceuz may well be |iroad, as it may well be thankful, to have its name, its scadery.

Not seldom, thus, a passage of Scripture or an event of sacred history was explained and brought home to the apprehen- sions of his most unlettered hearers, when it seemed to those who listened as if the windows of heaven were opened for a flood of light to come down ; and when the purest and most practical lessons of morality were educed with surprising force and attractiveness. It was impossible but that Herstmonceux Rectory should have become the centre of the surrounding clergy. The influence which was gradually fostered by the mere idxX of his presence amongst them received its legitimate sphere when, in 1840, he was appointed by Bishop Otter to the Archdeaconry of Lewes. This office he discharged with remarkable seal and success. He entered upon it at a time when the archidiaconal office was just assuming new importance; and his interest in its functions was evidently enhanced by the circumstance that his colleague at Chichester was no less a person than Archdeacon Manning, for whom, amidst many differences of opinion and principle, he felt, and continued to feel, the warmest admiration, and maintain a close intercourse up to the moment when they were parted by his colleague's secession to the Church of Rome. With a remark- able want of regularity and punctuality in his general habits, he combined an extraordinary precision and method in dealing with letters and papers, and hence the business that naturally might have seemed uncongenial to his tastes was more easily sur- mounted than might have been expected, and his presence waa sensibly felt throughout the portion of the diocese placed under his superintendence. But the most tangible, certainly the most per- manent, result of the Archdeaconry was to be seen in his Charges, It is not too much to say that these addresses occupied, with the single exception of the Charges of his distinguished friend the Bishop of St. David's, the first place in this field of ecclesiastical literature. Amongst the Charges of his Archidiaconal brethren there were none to be named with them for the public interest they almost invariably attracted. They laboured indeed under the defects inseparable partly from his own style, partly from the circumstance that, including under their undefined range all sub- jects, from the pewing of a church up to the war wi^ Russia, they were marked by a certain incongruity of composition .amounting almost to grotesqueness. And for his audience, we can quite imagine that their inordinate length may at times have been calculated to produce the effect which we once heard ascribed to ^ them Archdeacon Hare, 13 tbem by the good-humoured wit of one of our most eminent pre-^ lates, — ^ If I had been one of his clergy, dnd been charged in that way, I should have been like a gim — I shoiild have ffone off^ But with all these drawbacks there was in his delivery and his style a kindling' fire, a ti^uinpet-call,'tvhi<^h few could hear or read without emotion : there was in his arguments an accuracy of research, a calmness of mdgment^'a cleam^sd of statement, which made them the b^st resource foi* ieinv'one Who wished to know the rights and wrongs, the li^htis and shad^, of 'the leading practical qnestions of ihe day.

This sphere was not granted to him ; but on two occasions he was enabled to show how deeply he valued the opportnnity of recurring to it — how powerful the effect occasioned by even the temporary appearance of such a man in the Academic world. Those who were present at Cam- bridge in the winter of 1839, and the spring of 1840, will remember the strange apparition — as one might almost call it — of the Select Preacher of those two periods in St Mary's pulpit. It was many years since he had stood in that place. A tradition floated in the undergraduate world, that on the last time when he had appeared there the sermon had rolled on its seemingly inter- minable length far beyond the usual limit of Academic afternoon discourses, and, what was more important, far beyond the time allotted to the early dinner-hour of the great College, celebrated for its rivalry with that to which the preacher belonged. Whether from ancient feud, or shear weariness of spirit, or the natural pangs of hunger, the numerous members of this community are said to have manifested their impatience by the most unseemly and unequivocal signs, and the sermon on ^ the Children of Light ' (it was afterwards published at the request of the members of Trinity College) was closed amidst the audible scrapings and shufflings of a multitude of invisible feet on all sides of the eloquent preacher. Very different was the scene during the delivery of the two noble courses of sermons on * the Victory of Faith ' and on * the Mission of the Comforter.' No doubt in the interval Academic prejudice had been abated — Academic roughness softened. But there had been a change in the preacher also : the long sonorous sentences were the same, and the vast range over the concentric spheres of philosophy and religion, but there was an earnestness of purpose — a breadth and depth of feeling — which seemed to fill the stream of his discourse with a new and irresistible impulse; and as he stood before the vast congregation — listening in breathless silence to his impassioned appeal — ^his eyes glistening, his voice deepening with the increasing vehemence of his emotion, it seemed indeed as it had been a prophet amongst them. These sermons perhaps formed the culminating point of his fame. He never again appeared in so public a position before the world. But he took an energetic part in ail the ecclesiastical questions of the day, until disabled by the repeated attacks of an internal disorder, which, amidst much pain and suffering patiently and cheerfully borne, brought with it the greatest of all trials to an active mind, the incapacity of sustained application and work. Alleviated as it was by the constant care and skill of Sir Benjamin Brodie, who took a more than professional interest in his patient's Digitized by GoO^eCOVCiy, Archdeaecn Hare. 15 nooffajj yet jeacr bj jemr the effort of writing and exertion became greater ; and for months he was altogether prevented from taking anj active share in parochial duty. In the autumn of 1854 he ddivered with difficulty bis last Chaise to the clergy of his Arch- deaconiy, and on the 20th of January^ 1855, he expired at Herst* monceux Rectory, in the arms of her who for the last ten years had cast a steady sunshine over his life. One sign, eminently characteristic, broke the all but entire unconsciousness of his last hours. When asked to change his position, he answered nothing, but, pointing with his finger as he spoke, said, ^ Up- wards, upwards.' * On the 30th of January his remains were conveyed to their lesting-place in Herstmonceux churchyard. From the Rectory to the church the body was borne at the head of a mournful pro- cession, increased as it wound along through its three miles' course, by the successive troops of parishioners and clergy who joined it at the several stages of its progress. It was a clear bright day, in the midst of the unusually cheerless and dreary winter of that period, so dark with public disaster and distress ; and the features of the wide landscape of plain, and sea, and distant pro- montory, stood out in the sunshine as the mournful band were gathered around the aged yew-tree, on the verge of the rising ground beside the ancient church. Beneath that yew-tree was the humble cross which marked the grave of his brother Marcus. He two elder of that fourfold band slept far away beyond the sea — Francis at Palermo, Augustus in the Roman cemetery beside the Pyramid of Cestius, hallowed by so many dear and iUustrious recollections of the English dead. And now the last of the four brothers was laid in the dust ; and as the mourners stood round, many a heart must have been struck with the melancholy thought that the last link of a long familiar story was in him broken and buried. But it was not only the revered pastor of a country parish, or the last member of a remarkable family, that was there interred. Round the grave might be seen clergy of many different shades of religious belief from far and near, who were there to pay their tribute of affection and respect to one whose very differences brought out bis union of heart and feeling with them. And not Aoae only who were present, but many in various classes and stages of life, when they heard that Archdeacon Hare was no more, felt that they had lost a friend, an instructor, a guide. Let us ask what this loss has been ? What place was filled in * For m detailed account of his laft moments,' and for many just remarks on bSs character, we refer to the interesting sermons by two who knew him well, the title of which we have prefixed to this article.

To use the somewhat antiquated language of the last century. Archdeacon Hare's career might be described as that of an eminent scholar and divine. It is true that the words as applied to him convey an erroneous impressioa The two spheres in him were so closely fused together, and both were so truly the expression of the entire man within, that it is difficult to consider them apart. Still for convenience sake we may do so, moving gradually fiom the outward to the inward as our story leads us on. The scholarship of Julius Hare was of the kind which penetrated the whole frame of his mind. Like all English scholarship, it was built up on a classical basis, and the effect of this, enlarged as it was by the widest view of the ancient writers, never left him. Greece and Rome were always present to his mind ; and when he endeavoured to arouse the clergy of Sussex to their duties by the strains of Alcsus, it was only one instance out of many in which his deep delight in classical antiquity found its vent in the common occasions of life. To the older school of English elegant scholarship he hardly belonged, but in a profound and philosophical knowledge of the learned languages he was probably second to none even in the brilliant age of his Cam- bridge contemporaries; and he was one of the first examples that England has seen not merely of a scholar but of a ^ philo- loger,' of one who studied language not by isolated rules but by general laws. This precision of scholarship showed itself in a form which is perhaps, to many, one of the chief associations connected with bis name. Almost any one who has ever heard of Archdeacon Hare's writings has heard of his strange spelling. Every one knows that his sermons were not ' preached,* like those of ordinary mortals, but ^preacht;' that his books were not ' published' but ^ pub- lisht.' It is but due to bis memoiy to remind our readers that it was not, as most people imagine, an arbitrary fancy, but a deliberate conviction founded on undoubted facts in the English langua^, which dictated his deviation from ordinary practice. His own statement of his principle is contained in a valuable and inte- resting essay on the subject in the Philological Museum ; and it was maintained, in the first instance, not only by himself but by his two illustrious colleagues at Cambridge. £ut Bishop Thirl- wall openly abandoned it in his History of Greece, and has nevei recurred to it; and Dr. Whewell has confined it to his occa- sional efforts in verse. It was characteristic of the nmn thai Hare alone persevered to the end ; and whether it were a hymn- Digitized by Google ^Oo\\^ Archdeacon Hare. 17 book for his parish church or a monomental tablet, a German Dovel or a grave discourse on the highest matters of church and state, he would never abandon what he considered the true standard of correct schdarship, or countenance the anomalies of the popular practice. We may justly smile at the excess to which this pefftinaoity was carried ; but it was an index of that onwearied diligence, of that conscientious stickling for truth, which honourably distinguished him amongst his contemporaries ; it was an index also, we may fairly allow, of that curious dis- regard for congruity which, more than any other single cause, msurred his usefulness in life. The scholarship of Archdeacon Hare was remarkable for its combination with his general learning. Learning as an acquis!- tioD is not perhaps uncommon ; but as an available possession it is a very rare gift. It is easy to accumulate knowledge; bat it is not easy to digest, to master, to reproduce it. This, however, was certainly accomplished in the case of Archdeacon Hare ; and when we think with regret of the giants of learnings in former days, or of the superficial literature of our own, we may console ourselves by the reflection that we have had one at least amongst us who was sure to have consulted all the oracles, dead or living, within his reach, on any subject on which he ventured to speak. And this was the more re- markable from the width of his range. At the time when he fint appeared as a scholar, he and his companion Thirl wall were piohably the only Englishmen thoroughly well versed in the literature of Germany ; and this pre-eminence, even in spite of the ever-increasing knowledge of that country in England, he retained to the last. His acquaintance with German literature extended to its minutest details ; indeed, bis earliest publications were translations of some of the German romances of La Motte Fouque and Tieck ; and many who have never read any of his graver works have reason to be grateful to him for the delighti'ul garb io which he first introduced to them * Sintram ' aiul the ^Little Master.' But it was especially in theology that this branch of his learning made itself felt. One other name for a time was more prominently known as the English student and champion of German divinity : ' Pusey's Answer ' to Mr. Rose's attack on German Rationalism, though now almost foigotten in the greater celebrity of its author's subsequent writings, must always be regarded as the first note of cordial salutation inter- changed between the theologians of England and Germany. The Hebrew Professor has since drifted so far away from the position which he then maintained that he has long since ceased to be identified with the country to which he owes so much; and VOL. XCVll.

Not so the Arcfadeaoon of Lewes. What- ever he wrote or thovght was coloured through and throt^ with German research and Grerman speculation. Schleiermacher and Nitzch, Daub and Lacke, were as familiar in his moatk as Tillotson or Seeker, Mant or D'Oyly. He qnoted them witboat apology ; he nsed them without reserve. Yon could no more be ignontnt of their presence in his writings than oi their books in his library. Whatever may be the effect of German theology in England, whedier it be good or evil, great or small, there is no other single individual who has so largely contributed ^to this TDSoh as Julius Hare. To a great extent the German language, especially the language of German theologians, will always be to us a dead language — a tongue in which ^e learned will converse with each other, but not a medium of popular communicatioa. T\\m is, in some respects, a great convenience. There are always subjects in which it is impossible for the mind of a whole nation, or of two whole nations, to be simultaneously on the same level ; and in such matters a separate language is the best means o\\ intercourse between those who are really able to form a judgmait On the questions at issue. For this reason, we confess that wc can never look with much hope or favour on mere translations oi German works on theology or philosophy. It is next to inipos sible that they should convey to the uneducated Englishman tb impression which they received from the Grerman author. Often indeed, the mere fact of translation renders tb^n utterly unintelli gible.* The real interpreters of German thought are those who receiving it themselves, and understanding by experience it strength and its weakness, are able to reproduce it in an Englisl garb, or rather to develop and animate English literature by th contact. This was eminently the work of Archdeacon Hare ; for, tboug so deeply versed in foreign learning, he yet never lost the feelin or the position of an English gentleman and an English dei^ man.

But it was a kftier and broader position on which he took his stand. His academical youth had been cast in a time when the finer spirits of both Univenides were opening to the thaw which broke up the frost of the last century. It was at Oxford the age of the Oriel school — of that volcanic eruption which left as its two per- manent traoes on the history of this generation the names of Arnold and of Newman. It was at Cambridge the age when in a higher and wider sphere, though with leas direct and tan- gible efiects, there was the same yearning aDber a better vnion between Rcdigion and Philosophy — between things hnman and things sacred. One potent spirit swayed in this direction the mind of Cambridge, which at Oxford was hardly known. — ^ To the honoured memory of Samuel Taylor Coleridge «... Who, through dark and winding paths of speculation, was led to ihte light. In order that others, by his guidance, might reach that light Without passing through the darkness ' — Julius Haie de- dicated in after years his chief work, as ^ one of the many pupils Who had by his writings been helped to discern The sacred oon- cord and unity Of human and divine truth.' * ^ At the sweet sounds of that musical voice,' as he beautifully expresses it elsewhere, t those who listened seemed to ^ feel their sooJs teem and hurst as beneath the breath of spring, while the life-givii^ words of the poet-philosopher flowed over them.' We do not here profess to unravel the strange contradictions of Cote- zidge's mind and character. We do not foiget the mourafml obliquity which in all the homelier relations of life seems to have distorted his moral vision. Yet, in Cambridge at least, these words hardly overrate the importance of his influence. Of this combining, transforming, uniting tendency. Have was undoubtedly the chief representative; and the more so because it fell in with a peculiarly cos^enial disposition ; and it was the more strikingly and instructively displayed in him, from the fact that his profession and station were ecclesiastical. The cleigy in the middle ages, as is well known, represented all the better knowledge of their time. In England, even after the Reforma- tion, literature and theology were not entirely divorced, fiut diey gradually drifted away from each other.

He was able, in a time when the panic of Germany mounted almost to monomania in many excellent persons, to prove in his own person that a man might be deeply versed in German theology without being an infidel. He was able also, in an age of vehement party warfare, to take an active and beneficial share in all ecclesiastical movements without being a partisan. No party or sect of the church could claim him as exclusively their «wn. His separation from some, his agreement with others, of the leading members of each would really disqualify him from representing any of them. Yet he did not therefore hold aloof from joint action. He did not feel, as at some periods of his life Arnold felt, that he had no man like-minded with him ; that his hand was against every one and every one*s hand against him. On the contrary, few men of his time worked more harmoniously with his brethren, and re^^ved more sympathy from them. In his advocacy of Convocation he fought side by side with the almost Proverbial impersonation of the ancient High Church school, the ite Dr. Spry. His strenuous opposition to the modem High Church never deterred him from lending the whole weight of his support to Mr. Woodard's college and school at Shoreham and Harstpierpoint. With equal energy he strove against the intoler- ance of the partisans of Dr. Pusey and of the partisans of Mr. Gorham ; and yet he won the almost affectionate respect of men of all these various shades of opinion. One journal, indeed, l<mg continued to assail him with the bitter personal rancour which gives it an unhappy notoriety even amongst the party organs of this country, and delighted to denounce him as ' puffed up with crude and undigested knowledge,' as ' only to be acquitted of the crimes of treason and perjury at the expense of his judg- ment and of bis sense,' as one ^ whose spiritual state is painfully hazardous.' * But this was almost the only exception ; and theologians may think themselves happy if they can carry with * See Remarks on the * Record' Newspaper, 1849, p. 9, 10.

What then were the special qualities and views which won this admiration ? And, first, let us observe that it was not in kis ease an abstinence from attack on his opponents. It was, indeed, a remarkable circumstance that, with a heart so kindly and a sympathy so comprehensive, he combined an eagerness for polemics more like the old controversialists of the age of Salma- sios or of Jerome than of divines in modem times. The attack on Sir William Hamilton, in the notes to the ^ Mission of the Comforter,' and on Dr. Newman, in his ^ Contest with Rome/ are amongst the most vehement both in thpught and expression that the literature of this generation can furnish. Neither was it any peculiar attractiveness of style. To the popular reader it was too abstract and elaborate ; to the critical reader it was dis- figured by violations of taste almost unaccountable in one wbo bad so just an aj^reciaticm both of the excellences and defects of the language <rf others, whether in prose or poetry. There are, indeed, passages, such as the catalogue of the Christian heroes of faith,* where the sustained and elaborate energy with which be supports the greatness of the subject rises into a solemn and dignified eloquence: there are others to which his personal feeling lends an exquisite pathos. But on the other hand, there is hardly a page in which we do ]|||ft meet some quaint comparison, some novel turn of expression, which not only offends the eye and ear, but actually diverts the attention from the main argument in which the blemish occurs. Neither was it the establishment of any <»ie g^eat truth, or the victory of any one great cause, such as extort admiration even from the unwilling, and homage even from the dissentient. Hooker has won for himself his high place by the * Ecclesiastical Pblity ;' Butler by the * Analogy ;* Wilberforce by his share in the abolition of the Slave Tntde; Arnold by his work in Eblic educaticm. No such task fell to the lot of Julius Hare. s writings are all more or less fragmentary.

S3 bdiere, not onlj m place in tke affections of his conteraponuries, Imt in the interest of post^ity. What he waa will always be greater than what he did. Eren in the comparative failure of his ktboors there is something- so much more edifying than moat men's anccesscsy that we shall be doing a good work by dwelling on the image of the whole man whilst it is still fresh in the mesnory of those who knew him — whilst it still lends to his wiilings a unity which apart from hira they wocdd be in danger of kwing. Firsts tknre waa a 8im]dicity of purpose and of style which gave to all his writings the charm ol a personal presence — of a liraig cxunmimkaition. He wrote as he talked: he wrote^ if one maj thus apply Archbishop Whately's celebrated test of gaod preaching, ^ not becanae he had to say something, but be- came he had something to say.' It was no style put on and off for the occasion, but the man himself who was addressing yon. There needs no portrait, no biography of the writer, to tell you what he was like. As long as the works of Julius Hare survive, he will lire with them. The book is the authcM'. ' The cmrtain ' (aa the Greek painter said), ' the curtain it the picture.' Secondlj, whatevor might be the eccentricity of his mind in detail, he was one of the few writers^ certainly one of the few theologians, of this age who, in his practical judgment of men aad things, could lay. claim to the name of ^ wisdom.' * The wisdona which is ixomi above is first pure, then peaceable; gentle, eaaj U> be entreated, full of mercy and of good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy.' These are the words whidi are inscribed by pious gratitude on his gravestone. In some points they jar against the roughnesses of his natural temperament, as most always be the case in applications of afasteact truth to individual characters. But in some points they are strikingly appropriate, and the general effect well harmoBases with the purity and peace and genuineness of his teaching. Take his less elaborate judgments on books, on men, on things, as they are given in the delightful ^ Guesses at Truth,' which, thoi^ nominally by the two l»others, were almost entirely the work of the younger ; and certainly, for the justness of their csiticisms, for the breadth and fearlessness of their views, often for the pregnant wit and good sense of their aphorisms, may abnost take their place beside the ^ Remains of Coleridge.' * Or pass to his more deliberate treatment of general truths.

' I am bound/ be used to saj, * to defend one to whoB I owe so much.' It is true that in this, as in otbers of his Vindications, we cannot feel satisfied that he has always hit the main point of the objectors ; we cannot avoid the conviction that, whilst he is in possession of every single outwork, the citadel of the argument often remains unconquered. For example, after all that he has said, there will still be left an impression that Luther's conception of futh, when expressed in its dogmatical form, was either something very different from that portrayed so beautifully in * The Victory of Faith,' or else that it was not so distinctively or exclusively his own as to entitle him to the eulogies heaped upon him as its champion. But, on the other hand, we think that no one can read Archdeacon Hare's Vindi- cation without feeling that it is an important step gained in the right understanding and in the favourable understanding of Luther's character. The unparalleled knowledge displayed of the Reformer's writings is not only most valuable as a mine of reference, but is in itself a testimony to the greatness of the man who could inspire, at the distance of three centuries, such a vast, such an enthusiastic research. The numerous explanations of expressions long misunderstood, and of falsehoods long believed, are amongst the most decisive triumphs of literary- investigation that we have ever seen. No one can again quote against Luther that he called the Epistle of St. James an epistle of straw, or that he tossed the Book of Esther into the Elbe. No one can now give to the celebrated advice, *£sto peccator et pecca fortiter,' the terrible meaning ascribed to it by those who a few years ago regarded it as one of their most formidable weapons against the Lutheran doctrine. And above all, the breadth and energy of Luther's genius, the depth and warmth of his heart, and the grandeur of his position and character, amidst whatever inconsistencies or imperfections of expression, are brought out with a force and clearness which must often be as new to his admirers as to his detractors. We have said that this may be considered his last bequest to the literary world ; but we feel sure that amongst the letters and manuscript sketches which he has left behind, enough remains to form a more complete picture of what he was than is contained even in the expressive writings which we have been considering — much more than can be contained in the scanty outline which we have attempted in these pages. His childlike outbursts of affection, devotion, and faith ; his burning admiration of good wherever seen; his indignant scorn and hatred of evil, noble even when misplaced or exaggerated ; his entire freedom from all the littl^iesses of vanity, or ambition, or selfi^seeking, which Digitized by VjOO^, SO 99 tftea Tvx and bftimt llie path of aatfaon and of ecclesiastics — these are gifts bestowed by Providence with a sparing band. Let OS make the most of what remains of them ; let ns not snfier die image of them lightly to vanish out of our recollection. 'When we see pien like Archdeacon Hare cut off before tbeir time ' — so writes an able observer * of our ecclesiastical worid— 4t is- a natural superstition which tempts us to look upoa their removal as a sign of coming judgment, and an eril omen for ^e Church which they adorned.' But let ua ^ a more cheering view. Let the example of such a oicer rather fill us with thankfulness that there is at least cae cboTch in Christendom where such a career could be run as in its natural field — which gives scope for soch a union of ferrent piety with refined culture and masculine learning. His coarse has been well compared by one who knew him well to that of a noble ship, with her sails wide spread, filled by every gale which blew. Where, we may ask, would so many influences haveheen combined to propel the bark onwards as in the church ud coantry where his lot was actually cast ? Let us remember also that the divisions of which we are always complaining as &^ to the peace, if not the existence, of the Church, did but •erre in his case to bring out more dearly his power of over- looking and overruling them to the common good. Happily in ^ present lull of ecclesiastical controversy — ^hushed as it always ^ be hushed in the presence of the really great events on which hman happiness and misery depend — his voice may be heard Me readily than at times when it would be more needed. But tf^theiJogical factions of a few months or years past should \"gwn revive, there would be no ^ truer remedy for the evils of ^ ^e' than if we coold hear more and more appeals to the two ^^^i^Meadrng parties in the spirit of that which in such a time of 'S'tatioB, in the spring of 1850, was addressed by Archdeacon Hai« to his brethren :— 'With both sides I feel that I have many bonds of common faith and ^ and duty : with both of them I heartily desire to work together in ^ aenrice of our common Master. With each of the two parties, «• sundry points I differ in opinion more or less widely : but *h? sboold this cut \"^me off from them ? or why should it cut th«m ^ bm me ?

II. — Histoire de la D^couverte de la Circulation du Sang, Par P. Flourens, Membre de TAcademie Fran^aise et Secre- taire Perpetuel de rAcademie des Sciences (Institut de France), Professeur au Musee d'Histoire Naturelle de Paris^ &c. Paris. 1854. TT is within our recollection, that when some one mi^de a -■\" remark in his presence as to the value of his discoveries ir the decomposition of the alkalis and earths, Sir Humphry I>avy observed : * Perhaps you give me more credit than really belong to me ; others had invented the voltaic battery. The time had arrived when it was to be applied to the purposes of chemistry, and it fell first into my hands.' Something like this may be s&ici as to most of the great discoveries which have been made in th^ department of physical science. Knowledge is, for the most part slow in its progress. Among those who are engaged in the pur^ suit of it, there are few who do not add something, howevei small the contribution may be, to the general stock. At last some one endowed with a more comprehensive genius, takini advantage of the labours of his predecessors, views the fkctj which they have collected in their relations to each other, tra.cei analogies which they have overlooked, and from thence is le^ on to further inquiries, which open up new views of natura phenomena, and afford a deeper insight into the laws by whici they are regulated. These remarks have been suggested to us by the perusal of tb work the title of which is prefixed to the present article, in whiel a distinguished philosopher of a neighbouring country has beei ♦ * True Remedy for the EtjIs of the Age/ piu95-96.j Digitized by* 'piu95-96., by Google The Circulation of the Blood. 29 at the pains of collecting the various observations which, made bj difierent individuals, and at different periods of time, gradually led the way to that great discovery of the circulation of the blood, which it was reserved for our illustrious countryman Harvey to complete ; a discovery not less important in its relation to the sciences which appertain to animal life, than that of the law of gravitation is in its relation to mechanics or astronomy. To any one who reads the lucid exposition which Harvey has given ojf the facts which bear upon this subject, it may be a 9iatter of surprise, that from the time when anatomy was culti- tifated. hy Galen sp many centuries should have elapsed before the lariftth as to the circulation of the blood should have presented itself to those who were engaged in anatomical researches. The valves of the veins, those between the cavities on each side of the heart, and at the origin of the two large arterial trunks, seem to be of themselves sufficient for determining the course in which the blood fldws.

The necesHty for tl^e admission of air into the lungs by the act ' Digitized by LjOO^:! of 30 The dmilation^tim Blood. t>{ respiration was a fiact too obrious to be at any time orerlooked. The arteries whi(^ (as we now know) are, in tbe living body, always distended with blood, in tbe dead body are in a great degree empty of blood, but in a patulous state from their elasticity, and containing air. Erasistratus (as we learn from Galen), con- necting these two facts with each other, supposed that the air which entered the limgs by the windpipe was conveyed first by the large veins of the lungs (the pulmonary) to the left cavities of tiie heart, and from thence by the lai^e arterial trunk (the aorta) and its imiumerable ramifications to every other part of tke body. The arteries were held to be, like the windpipe, simply air^passages, and it was from the function thus hypotheticaUy attributed to diem that they derived the name by which they aie still designated. Galen corrected this error of his predecessors. He instituted experiments which prov«d that, in the living body, the arteries ooDtain not air but blood. He showed that the air drawn in by inspiratioQ does not really penetrate beyond the air-cells of ihe lungs ; he believed that the purpose which it answered was simply that of cooling and refreshing the blood ; and this opinioii prevailed amcmg physiologists even as late as the time of Ualler. It was reserved for modem chemistry to prove that the air and the blood act mutually on each other, and that in this way a change is produced in the latter without which it womld be uafit for the maintenance of life. Galen had not the means of determining the real nature of the respiratory function; but he ascertained that tbe blood in the arteries is different from that in the veins, which was a consider- able step towards it. Altogether, considering the point at which he set out, he accomplished a great deal, and may justly be con- sidered as having laid the foundation of the more ocu^rect phy- siology of tiie present day. Deriving little help from those who had preceded him, and with such limited means of obtaining a knowledge of anatomy as the state of society then afforded, it need be no matter of sur- prise that many of his views have proved to be erroneous. He believed that it was the office of the veins as well as of the arteries to furnish a supply of blood to ^e various organs of which the animal system is composed ; that die latter, having their origin in the left ventricle of the heart, convey a purer blood to the more refined and delicate organs, in which he includes the lungs ; wbile the former convey from the corresponding cavity on the right side of the heart blood of an inferior quality to the more gross and solid organs, in which he includes the liver. At the same time he held that the venous blood could not be equal to the duties assigned to Digitized by LjOO^;: it The Oftuktiau rfike Blood. 31 it mless eome portion of dw esMBce or tpirk oontaiDed in the arterial blood was infuBod into it. The qoosdon presented itself in what manner this infusion was eflTected, «aid be at once solred the difficulty by assuming that tlMre are openings expressly for this purpose in the wall or septMm by which the cavities on the two sides of the heart are separated from each other« No such apertures exist ; yet so paramount was the authority of Galen, that no <me presumed to contradict what he had asserted on the subject ; and it was not until the middle of the sixteenth century that VesaliuSy * the father of modem anatomy/ relying on his own observations, corrected and exposed the error. But Vesalius advanced no further ; and it is reraaikable that, after so great an anatomist had failed, it should have fallen to the lot of an individual who bad devoted his energies not to anatomy, but to controversial theology, to make a greater stride than any one had made before him towards the discovery of the true theory of the 'circulation. For those of our readers who are not oonversant with these subjects it may be well to premise that in all the higher classes of animals, there is a double circulation, the one for the trans- mission of the Uood through the lungs for the purpose of its beix^ exposed to the influence of the air in respiration ; the other for the purpose of distributing it, after it has received that influence, to the body generally, these two circulations being wholly dis- tinct from each other. Calvin rejected the authority of Rome. Servetus was opposed to Calvin. With the Rcnnish Church Calvin was a heretic. Servetus was a heretic with Calvin. When he published his treatise on the ^ Restoration of Christianity ' (^ Christianismi Bestitutio ') Calvin persuaded the magistrates of Geneva that he ought to be treated by them as himself would have been treated by the Inquisition if it had had him in its power ; and he was condemned to death, and was burnt. In the aforesaid treatise he gave an account of the pulmonary circulation, applying it in some way to his peculiar opinions in theology. A copy of Servetus's work, for which he thus, through the instrumentality of Calvin, acquired the glory of martyrdom, is preserved in the Imperial library of France.* M. Flourens supposes it to be the only copy now in existence — an opinion which may well be correct, as we leam from Sir Henry Ellis ^lat there is no copy of it either in the British Museum or in any other of the principal public: libraries of this country. The ^ It is stated that this copy of Senretus's work had belonged to CoUadon, one of his accnsers, and that it had at one time formed a part of the library of onr countryman, Dr. Mead. Digitized by GoSg^ian 32 The Circulation of the Blood. Parisian copy itself is in a mutilated state, having been partly burnt, as if it had been somehow snatched from the flames which were intended to consume at once the heresies and the heretic. Fortunately that part of the volume which treats of the circula- tion remains entire, and thus M. Flourens has had the oppor- tunity afforded him of giving an exact account of the opinions of this singular physiologist. The views of Servetus, when separated from certain wild meta- physical speculations with which they are mixed up, may be thus briefly explained. 1. The hypothesis of Galen that there is some kind of union of the venous and arterial blood, or that something is transmitted from one to the other, through the partition or septum which separates the cavities of the left and right side of the heart is altogether a mistake. 2. The scarlet (or arterial) blood which is found in the cavities of the left side of the heart is essentially different from the dark coloured (or venous) bl"
