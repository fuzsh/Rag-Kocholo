Numerous enlistments are being\n\nmade In the navy, hnt until yesterday no reports\n\nwere made of them to the District Provoet-Mar\n\nthal. It la presumed that these will add greatly\n\nto the filling of the quota, Lieutenant Batty la\n\nGoing all In bla power to credit the enlistments In\n\nthe nary to Cook county, except in cases where\n\nthey manifestly come irom,p!acea where there are\n\nno naval stations.\n\nThere are Indication* quite favorable that not a\n\nsingle Grafted man need go unless hs chooses.\n\nSeveral of the wards are exempt—having filled\n\ntheir quotas—and they will' doubtless asalrt with\n\nmen and money those who are poor and nnable to\n\nmake any great sacrifice. The vrsrdorvauUatlons\n\nare a capital thing, and we wou’d urge ail who are\n\nable to Goto, to Join them. In there wards not yet\n\ncrafted, those who will subscribe twenty-five col\n\nlars will have an opportunity to draw from five\n\nhundred to eight hundred dollars from the\n\ntunc so contributed, in case he ts drafted.\n\nWith this and tbs county scrip, |*hlch will be\n\nnegotiated without difficulty, after the present\n\nstringency in the money avast pastes away, will\n\nbe better off than he who la not drafted, because\n\nbe will doubtless obtain a substitute for a lees\n\nam onni he receives—Urns m iking a nice Utile\n\nprofit, as the result ot subscribing to the organiza\n\ntion. The county towns are making vigorous ex\n\ncitlons to get substitutes for those dra'ted, and In\n\ntome instances have succeeded admirably.\n\nnxcßvrre.\n\nThe present it an excellent time for .enrolled\n\nmen to enll-t. They will by so doing now receive\n\nthe wire bonus, toe county scrip and the govern\n\nment bounty, bat If they hold off, the likelihood\n\nIs that they will not get sornuca. Theconuty\n\nscrip will doubtless find reidy purchasers, after\n\nthe present atricgency passes over, anu as they\n\ndraw ten per cent Interest—as much as any other\n\nsecurities In the market—they will not suffer any\n\ndepredation. The county of Cook Is rich enonsn\n\nfive times over to redeem the scrip, and It will\n\nt ever be repudiated. All the wards In the North\n\n\"Division are now out of the draft, consequently\n\nthe demand for substitutes will be of the decrease,\n\nand like all articles governed by tbe lavs of sup\n\nply and demand, the prices must recede, and tbe\n\nransututea will not receive eo much mon*y. The\n\nlonger they delay, their prospects forobtalnlng the\n\nIsrge bounties will proportionately diminish. So\n\nnow is the time, gentlemen. Ton will probrbly\n\nsever hare a better opportunity than at Ue pres\n\nent. Tbe draft will Inrolah men enough If you\n\ndon't step forward, and It la “row or never.’* :\n\nIt psvs well to enlist.

Tbe dr.\n\neemstance passed by without special comment till\n\nthe news reached the Twelfth Ward.

Mr. Tattle was struck several times, chiefly\n\nin tbe back, but was once struck la the back of the\n\nneck with a aktp which was said to be loaded.\n\nThe blows wore ratoer poaches than otherwise,\n\nthe disposition btwg apparently simply to make\n\nbim give np tne money belonging to the Twelfth\n\nWard fund. was nonplussed, and did\n\nnot speak.

Near the corner\n\ntwo or three gentirmen pushed forward to his as\n\nsistance. and did their best to rescue him. This\n\nIncreased tbe anger of the assailants, and thence\n\nforward the ptmlahment administered was rather\n\nmore severe, betides which several side fights\n\nwere eatablhbed between Individuals of the two\n\nparties. Soon Mr. Tattle got downoa his knees,\n\nand then Major Williams, of the Bth Veteran Bs\n\nserve Corps, came to the rescue, calling\n\nto his aid half a dozen unarmed sol\n\ndiers . who wera in the crowd, and sending\n\nfox tbe Frev at Guard. These soon arrived under\n\ncommand of Captain Bjcrg and OoL B. J. Sweet,\n\nthe eemmaader of the post, came on the ground\n\nabout the same time. CoL Sweet restored order\n\nla short style, giving the crowd “ three minutes\n\nto aispcne. n The order was obeyed, and the sol\n\ndiers • formed a cordon round the building and\n\nkept the crowd outside. No sbeta were fired or\n\nweapons used, the only blows struck being -with\n\ntbe fiats. Mr. Casselman, tbe Qrreasnrer of the\n\nFond.
