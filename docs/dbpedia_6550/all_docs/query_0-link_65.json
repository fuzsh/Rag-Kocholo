Pew persons realise the vast amount <strong>of</strong> promotion the marble tournament undergoes long before it reaches <strong>Ocean</strong> <strong>City</strong>, They think only in terms <strong>of</strong> the amount <strong>of</strong> eryes- copy that goes out during lUe four days <strong>of</strong> tournament play, forgetting all about how much publicity the city receives during the months <strong>of</strong> March, April ana May, when the tournament is in its first stages. For example, Mr. Shurtleff can produce thousands <strong>of</strong> elippinp irom t'ountry-wide papers, <strong>of</strong> itor- ies on the marbles tournament and in each one there will more than likely be some mention <strong>of</strong> <strong>Ocean</strong> <strong>City</strong>, As an illustration, a Canion paper shows marble champs playing on the beach here uiid lelaies tnat <strong>Ocean</strong> Uity has Uie finest sand beach in the world. And that's how it goes down the line, in f&ct, <strong>Ocean</strong> Uity residents would leel migiity proud <strong>of</strong> their town if they could read some <strong>of</strong> the nice things that ire written about Uie city which appear in tlie press throughout the country.

The Atlanta Journal's coverage is a well rounded affair and the clippings from this paper begin- ning as early as Uie 2ith <strong>of</strong> Feb- ruary, would fill a large book. And if At lan tans never heard <strong>of</strong> <strong>Ocean</strong> <strong>City</strong>, N, J,, before that date, T, Bradford Byrd, the marbles editor, has certainly made them <strong>Ocean</strong> <strong>City</strong> conscious by now. This isn't only the case in At- lanta but most <strong>of</strong> the other cities as well run a large number < stories and pictures about <strong>Ocean</strong> <strong>City</strong> long before the tournament actually takes place.
