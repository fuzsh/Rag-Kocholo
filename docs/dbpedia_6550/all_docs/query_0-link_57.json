        "text": "10 is 8 0 0 0 and 2 THE ENQUIRER. CINCINNATI, TUESDAY, JULY 27, 1897 LITTLE HAND Scratched By the Judges And His Owner Threatens To Make Trouble. The Horse Did Not Tally With the Stud Books. Racing in Deep Mad at the Cincinnati Track. Great Contest Between Stout and Van Heest Last Night--Other Matters of Interest .\n\nThe racing at Oakley yesterday did not, perhaps, call for much, but there was doing\" in the side to make matters unusually lively at the hilltop track. What with a \"scrap\" between parties prominent in the racing game down in front of the stand before the first race and the subsequent ejectment from the track of a well-known Cincinnati business man, who had publicly threatened to make a move to have the hilltop track closed by legal process- of which is detalled elsewherematters were exceptionally lively at the handsome race course. The racing, as already stated, did not call for much--at least from a standpoint of sport. There was little about it to enthuse over, the finishes generally being tame and long drawn out. That was to have been expected, however, as the conditions were not such as to be conducive to brilliant contests .\n\nThe track was deep in tough mud, and the better class of horses for the most part were in consequence kept in their barns. As it was Ladies' Day, a very fair crowd was in attendance, despite adverse conditions, the gentler sex of course being in the preponderance. The crowd succeeded reasonably well in picking the winners, too, for while three favorites were bowled over. two of their number fell before well-played second choices. The only one of the five events, in fact, that could be thought to have broken in the pencilers' favor was the first, a five-furlong selling affair for maiden two-year-olds .\n\nDressen, The Devil and Dora were the betting choices among the ordinary lot engaged in it, but the only one of the trio that got any part of the purse was The Devil, and the best he could do was to run third. Dance, who went from 6 to 12 to-1-sufficient evidence of the fact that he had little support leading by a couple of lengths all the way, and winning easily from Essonite, another unthought-of starter. Dressen, the favorite, did not get off well, and Tommy Burns forthwith pulled him up. For so doing that jockey was set down by the judges for all but his employers. Kenston and Dr .\n\nColeman were the choices of the public in the second race, a seven-furlong selling affair, and they had the race to themselves at the end, Dr. Coleman and The Navy alternating in the lead to the turn, when Kenston joined Coleman. The latter swerved all over the track in the final furlong, and Kenston drew away from him and won easily. The talent took a fall in the five-and-ahalf-furlong race for two-year-olds, which followed. Banished was a hot favorite at 4 to 5 and less, but My Maryland, the wellplayed second choice at about 2 to 1 throughout, was quickest on her feet at the start, and opened a gap in the first furlong that the Wallace colt could never close, the daughter of Bramble winning all out by a couple of lengths .\n\nAn odds-on favorite went down in the succeeding race also. It was a split from the second, with Performance picked for a cinch, and backed from 3 to 5 down, to 1 to order 2. Adowa and Captain Peirsal was the to turn, when Peirsal went into the lead. When -iraightened for home Performance came the such but she could never quite reach, McLean castoff, likewise the second choice in the betting, lasting long enough to win in a drive by half a length. Carroll Reid's famous mud lark, Balk Line, was selected by the talent to carry their money in the closing event, a dash of a mile, with selling allowances, and he did not disappoint his backers, though old Jamboree, something of a mud lark himself .\n\nkept. him busy at the end to beat him out a length. OAKLEY GOSSIP. Henry Varwig, well known as the head of the one-time extensive business establishment, the Varwig Bung Company, last night announced that he would close the Oakley race track if it is in his power to do so. Mr .\n\nVarwig was yesterday ejected the hill-top track, and he now threatens to get even by proceeding against the track as stated. The cause of all the trouble was the action of the Oakley judges in refusing to allow a horse to start in the second race yesterday. Among others named as probable starters on the programme was Little Land, entered as a bey gelding, four years old, by Little Miner, dam Jennie McFarland, and the property of R. As the horse had never started and he was not to the satisfaction of the judges, those officials did as they have done in other similar cases- ordered the horse withdrawn from the race. The elder Varwig says that about two weeks ago he went to the judges at Oakley and informed them that his son had a horse which he desired to race at the hill-top track, telling them at the time, so he says, that the horse had never started, and asking what steps would have to be taken in order to race the horse .\n\nHe was told that it would be necessary for him to get responsible horsemen to identify the horse, and that it might be demanded that those who should the horse would do so under oath. Mr. Varwig says he then went to \"Brown Dick.\" the well-known colored trainer, and asked him if he knew the horse. On his assurance that he did he (Varw.g) called Dick over early yesterday to identify the horse in the presence of Secretary Letcher. Dick .\n\nso it is claimed, after examining the horse, assured Secretary Letcher that he was what he purported to be, the four-yearold son of Little Minch and Jennie McFarVarwig says he then asked Secretary Letcher, if that was satisfactory, and that he replied: \"Yes, if the horse is registered.\" Afterward, he says, he met Presiding Judge Rees, and while talking about the horse he showed a letter that had been written by B. J. Johnson with reference to the gelding. Captain Rees then told him that the horse would not start with his consent, intimating that the fact that Johnson had bred the gelding, as stated in the letter referred to, had influenced Captain Rees against allowing Little Hand to start. So much for Mr .\n\nVarwig's story, as far as action with reference to Little Hand was concerned. Now, to look at the other side of the matter. The younger Varwig, the owner of Little Hand, when asked if the horse had been registered, said that he had. When asked for the registration papers he said that he did not have such a document, and never did have it. An examination of the stud book showed Little Hand to be registered as a bay gelding by Little MinchJennie McFarland, foaled in 1893 .\n\nThe stud book furthermore in the description of the horse says that he has no distinguishing marks. Right there is where the hitch is. The horse entered in yesterday's race does not conform to the description given in the stud book, inasmuch as there is a white spot in his face, his near hind leg is white about one third of the distance to the knee, and the off hind leg is white to the knee. It cannot be said that the horse entered in yesterday's race is without distinguishing marks. With that sort of discrepancy in description the judges could hardly do otherwise than refuse to let the horse start .\n\nAs far as Captain Rees being influenced in his action by any connection that B. J. Johnson had or ever had with the horse, there is, of course, nothing in that. After the judges ordered Little Hand out of the race the senior Mr. Varwig accosted President Alex .\n\nLabold and asked him why his son's horse was not allowed to start. Mr. Labold did not know what horse was referred to, but when informed he said that it was entirely with the judges whether to let a horse start or not. Mr. Varwig, a littie later engaged in considerable loud talk in front of the grand stand, and declared that if that was the kind of thieving game carried on, or words to that effect, he would have those that run the track, the judges and others, indicted .\n\nThen President Labold instructed one of the officers to demand his badge, and to remove a from Mr. track if he failed to prohim the duce badge. Varwig did not show a badge and the officer took him from the track, refusing to let him go into the ring to get winning -ticket which he had cashed, and also insisting on his going out at the nearest gate, that leading to the railroad trains. After the races President Labold went to the Norwood Inn gardens, just outside of the track. Mr .\n\nVarwig and his sons were seated in the gardens at the time, and those who knew of the occurrence at the track looked for trouble, but no words passed between the gentlemen. Mr. Varwig declared to-day that he would swear out warrants against the Oakley offclals under the state law prohibiting gambling, and in this way break up the meeting. It Is said that after leaving the track he had a talk with Squire Ganzert, of Hyde Park, with reference to the case. President Labold in last night declared that he had no feeling the matter .\n\nHis re fusal of the horse was simply a precaution to protect patrons of the course. While he was not cognizant at time of the facts leading up to the trouble. he indorsed the action of Judge Rees fully, Mr. Varwig, he said, forgets clubs that there in a rule by which Jockey can refuse any entry without making public the reason. There was an unfortunate episode near the paddock gate before the racing began yesterday afternoon .\n\nStarter Letcher and Porter, the owner of Kriss Kringle, had some words about a remark that Forter made after the Kriss Kringle race Saturday. Mr. Letcher took the remark a reflection on his integrity, and asked the young owner if he meant anything of the kind. Porter said that he did, and the starter, according to parties who were nearresented the insult by slapping. or, rather, pushing, the young man in the face with his hand .\n\nPorter then swung with the field glasses, which he nearly always carries across his shoulder, striking the starter light blow. Bystanders then interfered to stop further trouble. It was an unfortunate affair all around. Mr. Porter's remark, as he said he meant it to be understood, was certainly a one .\n\nMr. Letcher's integrity has never been questioned by those who have known him long and well. whatever may be thought of his ability as a starter. There has been considerable complaint times about his work In the starter's box, but the same thing is true of several other gentlemen that have filled the position of starter this season. Some of the criticisms on Mr .\n\nLetcher's work have been correctothers have not. He certainly does the best he can to secure good starts, as tested by the patience that he shows with bad actors, and the fact that nearly every time he takes several trials before dropping the flag. No one, of course, can tell what he may have in his mind when a bunch of horses are before him, but it is not reasonable to suppose that he aims to give any one horse the worst of the break. The Judges have yesterday's affair under consideration. Brown Dick last night shipped his good two-year-old Plaudit and six other horses to Saratoga .\n\nTiny Williams, the clever Jockey, went with Dick. Billy Porter ran down from Ft. Erie yesterday to have a look at the Oakley game. His will in a day or so go from Ft. Erle to Saratoga .\n\nBilly reports that J. J. Carroll, P. J. Miles .\n\nCough and Creviling, who have been racing at the Buffalo track, will all go to Saratoga. For pulling up Dressen 'at the start in the first race Tommy Burns was set down by the judges for all but his employers. The foreign book at the track was touched up over the victory of Caddie at St. Louts. The price on the filly came from the track at 5 to 1, but the Oakley book laid only 8 to 5 .\n\nAt that price they got in $1,800 on her, a commission from St. Louis. The filly was played for \"further\" orders in all the rived poolrooms at in the country. She recently St. Louts from Kansas City, where she won several races .\n\nHiram Scoggan is in Chicago. He has nounced that he will ship his to Harlem at the close of the Oakley meeting. A sure winner-White Seal Rye. OAKLEY RACES.

PETTINGILL'8 Bad Work With the Flag at the Aqueduct. SPECIAL TO THE ENQUIRER Aqueduct Race Track, July -The summer meeting opened fairly well to-day .\n\nA majority of the plungers and an army of regulars remained away, making preparations for the Saratoga season, but sufficient number of paying patrons turned out to comfortably fill the grand stand and betting Inclosure. In four of the tive races the work of Starter was simply atrrocious. Rey del Tierra, favorite for the fourth race, was left standing at. the post. The starter threw his flag at the second attempt, paying no heed to the horse that carried tHe lica'9 share of the public money wagered over the race .\n\nAccording to the recently adopted rule of the Jockey Club two recalls are allowed at the post. Rey del Tierra only received the benefit of one recall. The race was won by Burlesque, 6-10-1 shot, who negotiated the mile route in The owner of Rey del Tierra obtained permission from the stewards to send his horse over the course immediately following the completion of the regular race. Starting at the regulation point and, unpaced, the colt ran the mile in 1:42. a second faster than the time of the original race, Speculation dragged heavily the first couple of races .\n\nThis was owing to the fact that -the public had not been properly introduced to the thirty-one firms that laid the prices in the inclosure for the past couple of seasons. The Metropolitan Association has controlled the booking priylleges on the Jockey Club tracks. It's four score members have monopolized the easy chairs at Monmouth Park and the substantial office stools at the other courses, and established odds to the complete ignorement of the less fortunate bookmakers who were relegated to the dead Last week the Metropolitan declined to pay the Queens County Jockey Club $50 a day each for the laying of odds concession at the present meeting, and the club officials barred the Metropolitans and installed the or Dead Liners\" in their stead. The newcomers were only assessed $25 a day each for the privflege. The new .\n\ndeparture was not exactly relished by patrons, owing to the annoyance over identification and the return to cash betting system. Only one layer did business without paying for the privilege. He enjoyed no chair, but represented the dead line in a manner that deserved an entire set of furniture. Taking his stand under the number man's elevated box, this individual catered to the crowd in open defiance of the track officials.
