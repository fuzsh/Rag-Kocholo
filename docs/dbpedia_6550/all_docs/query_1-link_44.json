Such accolades don’t rain lightly from the heavens. And Robby Vee, well, he’s been turning heads and making friends in the highest echelons of the music cosmos. When you dive into his latest opus, Double Spin, you’ll understand precisely why.\n\nVee does that essential alchemical act that transcends genres and shifts sonic landscapes—he propels music forward. While at first glance, you might peg him as a guardian of musical heritage, a torchbearer of bygone glory rather than a trailblazer, you couldn’t be further from the truth.\n\nScratch beneath the surface, immerse yourself in the songs, and you’ll uncover more innovation than nostalgia. Robby Vee is, in fact, a visionary artist. He knows where he hails from, but the much more exhilarating prospect is where he’s headed.\n\nSure, tracks like “Love Supreme” bear the indelible marks of a recognizable style, but within them, there’s an elevation, an effervescence, a polish and poise that firmly plants them in the present moment. Then there are gems like “Monsoon Sunset,” exquisite country rockers executed with such finesse that “timeless” is the only rightful label.\n\n“Song of Songs” weaves a captivating ballad, the sort Johnny Cash might be crafting today if he were alive and hitting his prime in this era. “Perfume” is a sweet serenade, elevated to celestial heights by the ethereal, spiraling violin that propels it. “Dashboard Jesus” is as infectious as music gets: fun, buoyant, brilliant.\n\nWhile Vee’s compass may point firmly to the past, his genius lies in reimagining, refurbishing, and revitalizing those cherished sounds and keeping them relevant for a whole new generation of discerning music fans. The result is an album that resonates with a devoted audience and kindles new fires in perhaps yet uncharted territories. It’s nothing short of perfection.

We’re incredibly excited to be speaking today with acclaimed Neo-Rockabilly artist extraordinaire Robby Vee; greetings and salutations, Robby! Before we dive into the proverbial Q&A musical rabbit hole, how is the autumn of 2023 treating you thus far?\n\nThank you Vents for the opportunity to talk about our new LP release Double Spin.\n\nAutumn is my favorite time of year… It’s when I feel the most creative. Coming off a really busy Spring/ Summer of shows, it feels good to slow down a little and approach new projects and take in the change of season.\n\n​\n\n2.) Major congratulations on the release of your amazing new album Double Spin! Getting the proverbial ball rolling, what was the inspiration behind this beautiful and rockin’ new album?\n\nI appreciate that. Double Spin has a few shifts in inspiration to it. The first is a collection of songs I wrote to bring attention to my “Blue Moon Blue Project” Artist Raising a Voice for Care, for the Alzheimer’s Foundation of America. This includes a couple co-writes with my Dad Bobby Vee and one with Wayne Carson who wrote the Letter for the Boxtops and You’re Always on My Mind for Willie Nelson among other great hits. I showcase these Blue moon Blue Project songs and my interest in the foundation nightly in my shows. My father passed away from Alzheimer’s in 2016, he and I got involved in projects for the Foundation together. The second is a collection of writing sessions with co-writer Andrew Hall, a talented poet from Las Vegas who I’ve known going back to my childhood. And last, is two singles “Good Morning & A Forever Kind of Love”. The song Good Morning (June Carter) is currently being pushed to radio. I’m excited that “Double Spin” was also issued on vinyl, I’m a record collector that has always dreamt of having my own songs on vinyl format.\n\n​\n\n3.) How is Double Spin similar to some of your past music? How is it different?

He’s got some shows coming up in Larchwood IA and Kenosha WI!\n\n​\n\nBuzz has a timeless danceability that makes my heart perk up. The video is fantastic because you are so fantastic on stage. When you write songs do you consider how it will sound or feel playing it live?\n\nThanks Ann! I appreciate the kind words… “I found a new way to start, found a vessel to your heart. Time has moved me past the clock to the inner beat that rules the block.” That’s the first verse of Buzz. When I was working on the music for Buzz , I was wanting an upbeat, retro vibe, celebratory dance kinda thing. I open my shows with it because of its uplifting energy, I love playing it live.\n\nThere are so many songs from my records over the years that I don’t play live… They just work better in the studio. When I do come up with a song that fits well in my live show… I feel lucky and normally it isn’t planned that way. The studio and live performance are so different for me. When I’m writing, I’m really focused on developing a song the best I can, almost like creating a painting that’ll look good in a frame or in this case, sound good with a collection of songs. When I get requests in my shows for songs that I don’t normally play live… It always feels like such a compliment to me.\n\nOn the latest album you cover Bobby Vee’s (your father’s) song, Forever Kind of Love. (Again, the video is fabulous because it gives homage to that connection without making it the focal point.) How does it feel to be able to pay tribute to him? And why you select this song?\n\nI love my Dad’s music. He was a huge influence on me as a person and as a recording artist. He was a great Dad and Artist!\n\nOver the years I’ve had fans of his and mine ask me if I’d consider recording one of his songs. “Forever Kind of Love” was a top charting hit record for my Dad in the UK recorded at Abbey Road Studio in London. It reached #13 and it remained on the charts longer than any other record of his…originally it wasn’t released in the US market making it fairly unknown here, which was such a shame. When I would tour the UK with my Dad it was the top requested song and my favorite to play on stage with him. I thought if I ever recorded one of his hits, it would be this song to introduce it to an audience that may have never heard it before.\n\nMy hope was to introduce a great piece of Vee musical heritage to a new audience and at the same time give a subtle tip of the hat to my Father, his legacy and the fans that helped make it a hit in the first place.\n\n​\n\nYou have played and worked all over the world, with names such as Bo Diddley and Eric Clapton; you grew up in a musical world, but I’m wondering if there are elements of Minnesota that you know you bring to your music? How has Minnesota impacted your sound and/or do you think you pass that onto your collaborations?

Robby’s the son of the late 60s pop-idol Bobby Vee (Velline) who had 38 Billboard charted hits & 6 gold records. A far better artist than many give him credit for. Bob Dylan played piano in Vee’s early band (1959) & Dylan had lots of respect for Vee. He even acknowledged Bobby during a live performance. Vee issued lots of pop songs but also some Americana-oriented albums: “Gates, Grills & Railings,” “Nothin’ Like a Sunny Day,” & his last “The Adobe Sessions.” But this is Robby Vee’s moment in the spotlight & deservedly so. He carries on the earlier tradition with retro & twang.\n\nThe CD I have doesn’t detail who the 13 songs were written by. But I’ve enjoyed the offspring of many successful singers. Lisa Marie Presley was not Elvis, but she had her punky charm. Hank Williams, Jr. is a success but not necessarily in the tradition of his Dad. Roy Orbison’s son sings spookily almost like his father. Julian Lennon is a viable artist who also sounds a little too much like John. Julian has good songs but just isn’t as challenging or inventive as his Dad. Big shoes to fill.\n\nSo, if the acorn doesn’t fall too far from the tree – Robby Vee may have the pop instincts his father had & it is evident on Double Spin (Dropped June 9–Paramour Records). Produced by Robby with Jeff Bjork, Vee’s voice isn’t as warmly distinctive as Bobby Vee but what he possesses is a genuine rockabilly individuality.

He is recognized by both the American & Canadian Rockabilly Hall of Fames and in 2019 he was recognized by the IRRMA for a Iowa Rock n Roll Hall of Fame Nomination. Vee has been performing his unique style of Rock-n- Roll music for years on stages across the globe.\n\nHaving been on tour with the legends and architects of rock-n-roll, Robby has learned from, and shared credits and stages with the best, from James Burton to Carl Perkins, Bo Diddley, Albert Lee, Little Richard, the Everly Brothers, Sir Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, Dion, The Righteous Brothers, Buddy Holly’s Crickets, Dick Clark and his ‘Caravan of Stars Rock ‘N’ Roll Show’, his father, 60’s pop rocker Bobby Vee and many more. Robby is known for combining elements of his vast repertoire telling stories that bridge the generation gap from “the roots of Rock n Roll to the new sounds of Americana music of today”.\n\nAs an Entertainer with many studio records to his name, countless guest artist credits, and a history of extensive touring, Vee has captured the attention of audiences and respected industry professionals both Nationally and Internationally. Claude Hall, radio-TV editor of Billboard magazine writes, “If this guy had been around during the era of Elvis, he would have given Elvis a run for his money.” READ MORE >\n\nMaking a Scene POD CAST\n\nRichard L’Hommedieu\n\nhttps://www.makingascene.org\n\nhttps://audius.co/Makingascene/robby-vee-is-making-a-scene\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/episode/1jFzAU7mmh9Ig3m9MhCh1V?go=1&sp_cid=6dc2c1af6c1e26d157ba3d39b90b9b6b&utm_source=embed_player_p&utm_medium=desktop&nd=1&dlsi=40d50889a4354823\n\nhttps://www.mixcloud.com/richard-lhommedieu/robby-vee-is-making-a-scene/\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nSEPT 1, 2023\n\nRootstime (Belgium/Netherlands) Album Review\n\nhttps://www.rootstime.be/index.htmlhttps://www.rootstime.be/CD%20REVIEUW/2023/SEP1/CD25.html\n\nI would bet a lot that no one knows who Robert Velline might be. But if we mention his stage name, that could soon change because when hearing Robby Vee, music connoisseurs could immediately make the link to the sixties and seventies singer and actor Bobby Vee. That successful artist suffered from the infamous Alzheimer's disease and died in October 2016 in Minnesota, where Robby also lives in Minneapolis and where he was nicknamed 'The Prince Of Twang'.\n\nJust like his father, Robby Vee chose to perform rock'n'roll and rockabilly in its purest form. We can now also hear this on his latest album “Double Spin” on which he plays and sings a total of thirteen songs in that music genre for 45 minutes. Actually it's about eleven new songs and two bonus tracks released as singles, both of which we added to the videos in this review: “A Forever Kind Of Love” and “Good Morning”.\n\nWhat has also earned him comparisons with his father is his double inclusion in both the American and Canadian 'Rockabilly Hall Of Fame'. Robby Vee already has a whole series of albums to his name and this album “Double Spin” is the most recent in a long list. He often performs together with the surviving rockabilly and rock'n'roll stars from the 'golden sixties' during the so-called 'Rock-n-Roll Caravan Show' that permanently tours all American states. In addition, he can pay a musical tribute to his father through his rich legacy of hits “Take Good Care Of My Baby”, “Rubber Ball”, “The Night Has A Thousand Eyes”, “Since I Met You Baby” and “Run To Him” on stage.\n\nRobby Vee can also count on many famous fans from the music world such as Carl Perkins, Paul McCartney, Dion DiMucci, Robert Plant and Marshall Crenshaw who frequently praise his singing and songwriting qualities as well as his sublime guitar playing. We can also discover these qualities ourselves on “Double Spin” in the swinging opening track “Buzz”, the catchy songs “Monsoon Sunset”, “Love Supreme”, “Tucson Girl”, “Wanna Dance” and the beautiful “Dashboard” accompanied by accordion music. Jesus” as well as the songs “Song Of Songs”, “Calianna's Lullaby” where the influences of his father's sound can clearly be heard.\n\nIn addition to the two songs that you can listen to on the videos, a new third single was recently released from “Double Spin” with the song “Blue Moon Blues”. Albums that evoke nostalgic feelings such as “Double Spin” are hardly recorded and released these days, but we certainly cannot and do not want to hide the fact that we are 100% in favor of this new album by Robby Vee.

Vee is a student of the rock ’n’ roll era and is in the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. “Rockabilly’s a little bit different than rock ’n’ roll,” he said. “It’s rock ’n’ roll plus something.”\n\nRockabilly’s kind of a melting pot of rock ’n’ roll, Johnny Cash country and jazz. He described the period from 1956 to ’64 as a feel-good, forget your problems and enjoy the music era, and that’s what he focuses on: Forget about the day and have a good time, something he said was rare in today’s world. He likes the challenges that come with doing a good show and having people connect to music, but he loves the connections music brings. “There’s a lot of people that come to my shows that feel like family to me,” he said. “It’s the connection with people and the connection with the legacy I come from.\n\n“People show up and they like my records and they like what I do, but they also love my dad. And that’s a common thread.” That’s because Vee is also a legacy artist, as his dad was Bobby Vee.\n\nREAD MORE >\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nFEB 4, 2024\n\n65 Years After “The Day the Music Died”\n\nJim Monk, Aaron Walling\n\nhttps://www.kvrr.com/2024/02/04/65-years-after-the-day-the-music-died/\n\nThat night proved to be a turning point for Bobby Vee, the 15-year-old Fargo boy who went on to become a pop superstar. Vee passed away in 2016.\n\n“My dad described it like, as one star went down, his rose that night,” according to Vee’s son, Robby Vee. “It was his introduction into the music business. And he said he was so nervous. There was an unbelievable amount of nervousness.” READ MORE >\n\nSeptember 21, 2021\n\nNuevoculture: Exclusive Interview With Robby Vee\n\nhttps://www.nuevoculture.com/exclusive-interview-with-robby-vee/\n\nCongratulations on releasing two hit tracks “Good Morning” and “A Forever Kind of Love.”\n\nQ: Please tell us more about the message you wanted to convey with these two tracks?\n\nA: I wanted to record two songs that were positive and hopeful from a life or relationship perspective…\n\n“Good Morning” is a song that speaks to the positive and in some ways it could be an anthem for mental health; “How are things inside you, will this day rule or guide you?” “Do you wake up with the feeling of all that life’s been dealing.” It also pays homage to the legendary June Carter from the Carter Family who was country music’s original great lyrical optimist.\n\n“A Forever Kind of Love” is a song written by Gerry Goffin & Jack Keller who also wrote hit songs for my Father Bobby Vee including a #2 Hit “Run To Him” (my personal favorite). Over the years people have asked me if I would consider covering one of my Fathers releases, which I’ve wanted to do…it just took me some time to find the one that fit my journey and had meaning for me. This song was originally recorded by my Father in the early 60’s at Abbey Road Studios in London and it charted in the UK & Australia, but was never originally released in the United State because the producer “Snuffy Garrett” had an issue with it. We would get requests for the song when on tour in the UK & Australia and always looked at it like a missed opportunity that his original version was never released in the US. With that in mind, I love the true blue message of the song. It feels like a timeless song to me. I was excited to introduce a great song to my audience as well as his audience that may have never heard it before.\n\nQ: How did your sound develop to become the Robby Vee we know today?\n\nA: I started out as a fan of my Father’s record collection, the Vinyl LP and 45’s…. Which put me in the universe of Rock n Roll and Rockabilly. As a kid I would spend entire Summers on the road with my Father watching those very same Legendary artist from those Vinyl records perform. Months at a time hanging backstage in the wings on Dick Clark’s Rock n Roll Shows seeing greats like Bo Diddley or Little Richard do their thing. I learned a deep love for rock n roll that has continued through the years, I love the craft of a good song. My sound comes from Rockabilly in the sense that the term Rockabilly means many genres: country, bop, rhythm and blues etc… all melted together. It means freedom of genre to move around in that melting pot to arrive at a great song, even a pop song. My foundation has always been these building blocks of roots music and the freedom to build on that in the now of today’s sound. My aim has always been to stay true to my own style and honor those foundational pieces in a way that feels honest and real to me. To be grounded in the roots while pointing to the future and embracing what feels most natural. In newer artists I seem to be instinctively drawn to music and a sound that reminds me of those legendary artists and early influential years.\n\nQ: How would you best describe your musical style?\n\nA: I’ve been described as Neo-Rockabilly…with some Roots Rock n Roll. I think I could fit into the category of Singer Songwriter with my more current releases.\n\nQ: What inspires you when creating new tracks?

Robby Vee has carved out an incredibly impressive career carrying on in the honest and thoughtful rock and roll stylings of Bobby Vee. It’s a discography that only serves to improve and further the legacy of the Vee family.\n\n‘Good Morning‘ begins with the tuneful twang that Robby Vee has become famous for. The guitar sings and throughout the track it provides a beautiful and emotive core that works wonderfully pumping blood at the heart of the song.\n\nThe guitar is joined by the soulful crooning of Robby Vee and his crisp warm vocals. The song is one of hope and positivity and this is expertly matched in the inflections and careful placement of each melody.\n\nThe lyrics themselves are honest, open, and easily understood. Like all good country it speaks straight from the heart and doesn’t spend too much time or energy hiding behind metaphor or simile, instead it lays out its message in language we can all understand, feel, and relate to.\n\nIt’s a song that looks to provide a friendly smile and a cosy shoulder to relax into. While retaining a sense of realism it admits that life can be hard sometimes, but instead of dwelling in it, it encourages the listener to step into the brighter feelings.\n\nThe instrumentation is much more complex and layered than just the beautiful guitar work of Robby Vee himself. There are whirlwind flourishes of fiddles, sumptuous bass lines, and energetic drums.

From the sparky, almost Arctic Monkeys-esque ‘Tucson Girl’ to the danceable, ‘Buzz’, Robby experiments but never gets carried away.

Though similar atmospheric hum suits ‘Before Majesty,’ heightening its sombre lyrics, it all adds up to a monotony that drags down the record’s second half somewhat.\n\nFortunately, the closing act, ‘Wanna Dance’ clears things up and resolves the album nicely – in a collision of happy words and ringing guitars. It’s not without fault, but ‘Buzz’ is a hugely captivating start.

The EP Collection.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nDecember 01, 2018\n\nNEW RELEASE \"Vee Hall\"\n\nNeo-Rockabilly Artist Robby Vee teams up with Poet & Writer Andrew Hall for a collection of Songs titled “Vee Hall”.\n\nRobby Vee comes from a big musical family many know for the musical genius of Bobby Vee. He carries on the family tradition as will his children. It was something I witnessed growing up down the block from the Vee’s. In the Vee house, there was always a guitar nearby. Music was in the very blood... And words also flowed in the artistry of The Vee’s through Bobby and Karen and their family.\n\nMy dad wrote a column for Billboard Magazine about radio and television, but music was his first love. He and Bobby shared a love of country music and our families often went camping together. Bobby would break out the acoustic guitar and serenade us into the night around the campfire. He always threw in my favorite: “Lollipop.”\n\nOur fathers have recently passed on to the next realm but not before imbuing us with their love and passion for music and lyrics. Words can't do justice to the legacies our respective dads left us but still we try.... Robby through music and myself through words...\n\nRobby reminds us that this work is in honor of and brought forth by the love of our parents but also our personal heart felt journey of us doing what we do...\n\nWe are artists trained by the best…\n\nWe pay tribute in our path.\n\n“You can’t know where you are going unless you know where you have been.”\n\nOn Vee Hall…\n\nBuzz is a celebration of life in the purest sense. Hallelujah!\n\nBefore Majesty brings us back to our childhood imagination. We are all purple dragons... We are warriors and sages and fools... All the archetypes are in us all.\n\nMonsoon Sunset has the beauty of classic country songs ala Jimmy Webb and Glen Cambell... The music changes to meet the lyrical moods and the song delivers warmth and hope about weathering the storms of our lives.\n\nLove Supreme celebrates the jazz that is love and the love that is jazz and all music for that matter.\n\nPerfume is the essence of life.\n\nWe need a sense of everything or a scent... Darkness and light....Yin/ Yang... We must lose in order to gain perspective.\n\nSong of Songs (Ballad of Old Souls) is a musical satire in the tone of Shakespeare's sonnet,\n\n\"My mistress eyes are nothing like the sun.\" The Bible is always a good place to go for inspiration, creativity, and diversity.\n\nRobby, a fine lyricist in his own right, had to navigate around these words, into them, and through them to unravel their musical possibility. He crafted poems into songs. For many musicians the words come after the tune has formed. For Vee the challenge was to unpack the mystery and translate the magic into pure sound. From our conversations, I could tell that this process was a joy for the both of us.\n\nFor the poet... The job is relatively easy... Just spit the words out and let time do the rest. Sure... There are revisions and edits... But the musician has to sculpt the words to fit his or her voice... To sing well is difficult let alone to invent musical accompaniment.\n\nI hope the songs move you to dance, to reflect, to hold your dear one close... And if you are a solitary traveller, hold yourself even closer....\n\n\"Music is eternal\n\nThe notes never go quiet\n\nAnd if you are so inclined\n\nPick up your instrument\n\nAnd play with us.\"\n\nRobby continues to entertain, create and pass the family tradition down to his children. He will bring the twang with his Rock and Roll Caravan to the edge of the universe.\n\nI work as a high school English Teacher turning the kids on to the power of words. Somewhere out there our fathers look down on us with a smile knowing that the music continues.\n\nIt is an honor and joy for both of us to collaborate together and bring you the grooves that have moved us.\n\n- Andy Hall\n\n(In loving memory of Bobby Vee & Claude Hall).\n\nOther Music From Robby Vee:\n\nBlue Moon Blue, Viva La Twang, Liquid Love, Bop, Early Years with the Vee's (Moon Dog House Party/ Crash Boom Bang It Out), Vee sings Vee (Robby & Bobby Vee) SINGLE: 'This Love'\n\n​​​\n\nMore About Andrew Hall:\n\nAndrew Hall grew up in a creative writing household.

I played music with my family and started doing shows with my father early on, but what started me on my path was a meeting with Record Producer Greg Ladanyi.\n\n​\n\nJ.I. Allison, The Crickets original drummer and song writer invited my father and myself down to Nashville to work on a record titled ‘The Crickets & Their Buddies’ a compilation Tribute to ‘Buddy Holly & The Crickets’ featuring Eric clapton, Waylon Jennings, Phil Everly and many others. We cut the song ‘Blue Days Black Nights’ in JI’s studio…and producing the project was Record Producer Greg Ladanyi. Greg is best known for his work with The Eagles, Don Henley, Toto, Jackson Browne, Warren Zevon to name a few. They were looking for songs for the record, and greg asked me if I had any…I played a few for him and he in return asked me to come out to his studio in LA to record with him. His company signed me to 2 consecutive contracts which really started me on the path of making my style of records and finding my own way in the business.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nMedia Involved:\n\nWhat is Rockabilly Music?\n\nVee:\n\nEven though I’m a Rockabilly Hall of Fame member I’m not a purest in the sense, I use the term pretty loosely with my music. I think of Carl Perkins the way he describes it as, taking country, rock n roll, blues…jazz, Bop and mixing it all together in one pot until you get a style of music. I think all of my music comes from that traditional foundation. I like the freedom and that idea to be able to move in different stylistic directions blending it all together. I feel like my records are very much my own thing…I’m not like other artist. I kinda have my own slant on it all from songs I write to the way I approach what i do, though I’m influenced by many.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nMedia Involved:\n\nWhat are some of your first influences of Rock n Roll?\n\nVee:\n\nMy father used to take me on tour with him at a very young age… It really exposed me to all the great legends in the business. A time that really sticks out, when I was very young we spent an entire Summer in Vegas with a ‘Dick Clark Caravan of the Stars Show’. I would go to the show with him every night and sit back stage watching Bo Diddley, The Shirelles and many others go on stage…the songs and performances really got into my blood and sparked a love for rock n roll. The great rock n roll package shows my father would put together with Del Shannon, Buddy Knox, Freddie Canon, Tommy Roe and many others became shows as I kid that I was exposed to, but later I became a supporting artist on those same shows along with backing most of them up as a member of the band.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nMedia Involved:\n\nWhen you talk about the Vee Family tradition of Rock n Roll…what does that mean to you?\n\nVee:\n\nI bring that back to my high school years growing up in the midwest. My family moved to the midwest from LA when I was in my teens. My parents started a rock n roll concert fund raiser for Cathedral High School in St Cloud MN that went on for 25 plus years raising money for the community. Dick Clark, Little Richard…all my Dads friends got involved. Family’s would come together with music and have an amazing evening. I learned from that family tradition most of what I do now, our family was instrumental in creating, booking, producing & preforming on those shows right down to the art on the cover of the concert booklets. From a business and musical stand point. I feel like I’m continuing that tradition of music and values in my own way, the igniting of positive spirit in a community.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nMedia Involved:\n\nWhen you go to a Robby Vee Show what can you expect?\n\nVee:\n\nIt’s important for me to come on stage and introduce the audience to the musical tradition and legacy I grew up with…I’ve recorded so many records over the years, some as Robby Vee, some as The Vee’s and some as Bobby Vee & The Vee’s. It’s important for me to plug into my father Bobby Vee’s legacy…from his Hits to the familiar and most requested album cuts from my career and the Vee’s. I also like to celebrate the Rock n Roll era from the Surf Music and Twang to the familiar ‘toe tapping’ sing-alongs that engages the audience in just having a fun time. Rockabilly music gives me the freedom to play all sorts of traditional Americana music from Blue Grass, Swing to Country and straight up Rockin’ Blues Rockn Roll!!\n\n​\n\n​\n\nMedia Involved:\n\nTells us about your latest Project.\n\nVee:\n\nI call it the Blue Period. Our most recent release is titled ‘Blue Moon Blue’. The single is ‘Blue Moon Blues’…we came together with the Alzheimer’s Foundation of America “Artist Raising Their Voice for Care” to help raise money and bring awareness to this great foundation. We put together T-Shirts with one of my paintings also featured in the record sleeve of Blue Moon Blue along with the Single with all proceeds going to the foundation. T-Shirts can be found at www.robbyvee.com and the music at Amazon or iTunes. The project is a bitter sweet project for me for a great cause. My father was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2011 forcing him to retire his career. My involvement with AFA is me putting some positive into a tough situation. Blue Moon Blue much like the myth of new beginnings and letting go symbolized in a blue moon and Picasso’s blue period, this project has been very much all that for me. My Mother passed away the week it was released. The cut Tucson Girl from the record was a co-write between my father, my sister and myself. It’s the last song my father ever wrote. My co-writer Wayne Carson (You Were Always On My Mind, The Letter, Soul Deep), who co-wrote Blue Moon Blues, a mentor and a huge presence on all my records passed away the same week of the record being released…and last the co-producer and string arranger for the project James Carey passed away the week of our last recording session for the project. Just a huge amount of tragedy in a short amount of time…total life changing stuff. So, I guess this project is my career Blue Period though it hi lights the great production of Jeff Bjork and playing of Jeff and Bryan Williams including some of the great guest that contributed their talents, including a cameo by my daughter Alison along with Jamie Williams on vocals…the studio Vee-ettes. The project will always hold a introspective place for me much like the gospel influenced song Dashboard Jesus featured on the record.\n\nSubscribe\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nJune 20, 2016\n\nVee Sign's with Warner Chappell Latin America!\n\nMedia Invloved Blog News:\n\nRobby Vee's Music Catalog, with Vee Entertainment/ Jan Cooper Publishing has signed with Warner Chappel Publishing Latin America.
