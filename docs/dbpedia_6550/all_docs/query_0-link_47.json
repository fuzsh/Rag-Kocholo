        "text": "From the NERW Archives\n\nYup, we’ve been doing this a long time now, and so we’re digging back into the vaults for a look at what NERW was covering one, five, ten and – where available – fifteen years ago this week, or thereabouts.\n\nNote that the column appeared on an erratic schedule in its earliest years as “New England Radio Watch,” and didn’t go to a regular weekly schedule until 1997.\n\nOne Year Ago: May 20, 2013\n\n*It”s been a week of big changes in western NEW YORK broadcasting, and nowhere, perhaps, bigger than in the newsroom at WBEN (930 Buffalo). News director Steve Cichon has become a fixture in the market over his 20-year career, starting out as a producer at WBEN, moving down the hall to WIVB (Channel 4) and then to the program director”s chair at the old WNSA (107.7) before returning to WBEN in 2003.\n\nAs news director at WBEN in recent years, Cichon has been as Buffalo as Buffalo gets – and when he”s not running the newsroom, he”s been busy writing books about the history of the Parkside neighborhood where he lives (“A Complete History of Parkside“) and about Buffalo”s legendary Channel 7 news team (“Irv! Buffalo”s Anchorman: The Irv, Tom and Rick Story“) – and blogging constantly about Buffalo history at StaffAnnouncer.com and on Facebook.\n\nWhich is why it was rather a shock early last week to see Steve”s announcement – yes, right there on Facebook – that he”s moving on from WBEN, and from broadcasting, at least for now. Cichon will leave WBEN on May 31, and in June he”ll launch a new company called “Buffalo Stories, LLC,” where he says he”ll be “working with small businesses and non-profits to tell their story.”\n\nNo replacement has been named yet at WBEN – and in the meantime, we send our very best wishes westward down the Thruway to Steve on his new venture!\n\nThere”s a format change in Buffalo: Wednesday morning brought a flip from soft AC to standards at Dick Greene”s WECK (1230 Cheektowaga) and its FM translator at 102.9 in downtown Buffalo. The former “Buffalo”s Breeze” is now “Timeless WECK,” with Tom Donohue still in morning drive and Dial Global”s standards format filling the rest of the day. While the “Breeze” format went up against much bigger AC players including Townsquare”s WJYE (96.1) and Cumulus” WHTT (104.1), the new “Timeless WECK” has its format pretty much to itself after the demise last year of Cumulus” “Swing 1270” (WHLD, now carrying CBS Sports Radio.)\n\n*A Long Island broadcast group is making a big expansion in north central Florida. JVC Broadcasting, owned by John Caracciolo and Vic “Latino” Canales, is acquiring the Asterisk Communications clusters in the Ocala-Gainesville market. In Ocala, JVC gets AC WMFQ (92.9) and country WTRS (102.3), stations we just recently profiled on Tower Site of the Week, while in Gainesville, JVC”s new signals are smooth jazz WXJZ (100.9), talk WBXY (99.5) and country WYGC (104.9). JVC is paying $3.5 million for the five Florida stations.\n\n*It looks like Plum TV has hit the pits. Last week, we noted that the Boston-market affiliate of the upper-demo TV network, WMFP (Channel 62), appeared to be on the verge of switching affiliations to NBC”s CoziTV rerun network – and not only did that change come to pass early Monday morning for viewers in eastern MASSACHUSETTS, but Plum also disappeared for the denizens of Martha”s Vineyard and Long Island”s Hamptons, where local Plum outlets quietly went dark on cable within the last few weeks.\n\nThe network, which also included outlets at several ski resorts out west, had already gone through a brush with bankruptcy in recent years, only to be rescued by a new round of investors who”d been trying to improve Plum”s visibility in larger markets like Boston. Now it appears to be gone for good – and it”s certainly gone from Boston, where Cozi is now airing on WMFP”s 62.1 channel over the air and on Comcast cable 20.\n\n*It”s been a rough few years for small AM stations in western PENNSYLVANIA.\n\nFrom Connellsville to Oil City to Carnegie to Somerset, we”ve watched as shifts in the economy have impelled station owners to surrender their licenses rather than continue losing money trying to keep them afloat. The latest entry on that unhappy list appears to be WKZV (1110 Washington), the 1000-watt directional signal that signed on as WKEG back in 1970. Most recently programming classic country, WKZV had been operating only sporadically in the past year following the death of co-owner Stanley Supinski, and there”s now word that his widow, Helen Supinski, has signed off the station for the last time and sold the land on which its two-tower directional array sits, with the towers soon to be demolished.\n\n*Conventional wisdom says we”re living right now in a time of transformative media change, as established news sources come under siege from newer, more nimble ventures. wbin-smIn the world of local TV news, though, “new” doesn”t automatically mean “success” – especially in markets where a single player might have a six-decade head start on a newcomer. Markets such as, say, NEW HAMPSHIRE, which is where we start this week”s column with the news that Bill Binnie”s WBIN (Channel 50) has pulled the plug, for now, on the 10 PM local newscast that launched back in the fall of 2011.Read more at: http://www.fybush.com/nerw-20130506/\n\nFive Years Ago: May 18, 2009\n\nA western PENNSYLVANIA radio institution is succumbing to the economy. For nearly half a century, the call letters “WAMO” – which officially stand for the Allegheny, Monongahela and Ohio rivers that meet in Pittsburgh – have been synonymous with programming for the region’s black community, and it was that community that was stunned Friday by the news that Sheridan Broadcasting, which has owned the WAMO stations for more than 35 years, had reached a deal to sell them to an organization called Saint Joseph Missions, bringing an end to the urban-oriented formats on the stations.\n\nWhat Saint Joseph gets for its money is a relative bargain: for $8.9 million, it gets the current incarnation of WAMO-FM, a class B facility on 106.7 licensed to Beaver Falls and serving the northern half of the Pittsburgh market with R&B from a transmitter site in Wexford, as well as two AMs – urban talk/R&B oldies WAMO (860 Millvale), with 1000 watts by day, 830 watts at night and a solid signal over the core of the market, and gospel WPGR (1510 Monroeville), a 5 kW daytimer serving primarily the eastern side of the market.\n\nSo who is Saint Joseph Missions? According to the statement the nonprofit filed in a 2007 application (still pending) for a new noncommercial signal on 91.7 in Ligonier, it’s “organized exclusively for religious, educational, and charitable purposes,” in particular those of the Catholic Church. There’s little question, then, about what format Pittsburgh listeners will be hearing on 106.7, 860 and 1510 once the sale closes – and no small bit of irony there, since another Catholic broadcaster, Relevant Radio, apparently couldn’t make a go out of its lease of a much smaller local signal, WZUM (1590 Carnegie), which has been cycling through several temporary formats in the last few days.\n\nNEW YORK’s Pacifica outlet, WBAI (99.5), is no stranger to management turmoil, and that seemingly endless loop is making another cycle this spring. Pacifica national management removed GM Anthony Riddle from his post earlier this month, and station veteran Bernard White says the 10-day suspension he’s serving amounts to an ouster from the PD chair he was occupying. Lavarn Williams is serving as acting general manager as the national Pacifica board tries to get the station back on sound financial footing.\n\nThere’s a callsign change in the Catskills: WXHD (90.1 Mount Hope), the relay of New Jersey’s freeform WFMU (91.1 East Orange), has changed its calls to WMFU, an anagram of the mothership’s callsign. Yes, the station is well aware of the potential fun that those with filthy minds (In radio? Never!) might have with the new callsign – and it’s already fielding potential guesses as to what the WMFU calls really ought to stand for. (Our favorite among the early entries: “We Must Forget Upsala,” a reference to the now-defunct college that was WFMU’s original licensee.)\n\nOver in Utica, we’ll know this morning how serious Roser Communications is about the “format change” it’s been heavily promoting at its pair of “Kiss FM” top-40 stations, WSKS (97.9 Whitesboro)/WSKU (105.5 Little Falls). The stations garnered lots of publicity late last week when they announced that “financial constraints” were forcing them to flip to a new format at 7:30 Monday morning – but since Kiss is also promising that its airstaff won’t be affected, and since there’s no mention of the “changes” on its website, it certainly has that “stunt” scent to us. Stay tuned; we’ll be listening Monday morning to see what, if anything, happens.\n\nMONDAY MORNING UPDATE: After a series of tearful “goodbyes” from the airstaff, the stations “relaunched” at 7:30 with the soft AC format from sister station WUTQ (1550) as “Beautiful Music 97.9 & 105.5,” and nearly 20 minutes later, it’s still smelling stunt-y, what with the jock complaining on-air about the “new format” and all… (And sure enough, just before 10 AM, “Kiss FM” returned to its old format, with new morning man Eric Thomas having used the “Beautiful Music,” followed by “Whatever FM,” as his way of introducing himself to the market.)\n\nA former CONNECTICUT callsign is back on the air in the Hartford market. Now that John Fuller’s Red Wolf Broadcasting has taken control of WURH (104.1 Waterbury), the station is returning to the WMRQ, “Radio 104” identity it used from 1995-2003.\n\nTen Years Ago: May 17, 2004\n\nNick Berg’s name and his tragic story have been all over the national headlines this week – but for many radio folks in PENNSYLVANIA, NEW YORK and NEW JERSEY, the tower worker who was beheaded in Iraq is more than just a name in the papers. Before Berg headed over to Iraq earlier this year, he was up in the air (and down on the ground) at tower sites all over the region, operating as “Prometheus Tower Service” at sites that included Ingraham Hill in Binghamton (where he installed the new WHWK 98.1 antenna, apparently his last job in the U.S.), WNGZ in Montour Falls, N.Y., the New Jersey Meadowlands and WPLY in Philadelphia.\n\nWe’re keeping tabs on an industry effort to create a scholarship in Nick Berg’s memory, and we hope to have details to provide by next week’s issue.\n\nThere’s a new FM station on the air in NEW JERSEY: WJPG (88.1 Cape May Court House) signed on a few days ago, simulcasting the contemporary Christian music of WJPH (89.9 Woodbine).\n\nSome talent on the move in upstate NEW YORK this week: at Clear Channel’s WYYY (94.5 Syracuse), the husband-and-wife morning team of Pete Michaels and Brenda Bisset are out after three years, replaced by Rick Gary (of sister station WIXT-TV) and Kathy Rowe, who moves to mornings from middays. Replacing Rowe is Marne Mason, formerly of Galaxy’s WTKW (99.5 Bridgeport)/WTKV (105.5 Oswego); she’ll also be Y94’s assistant program director. And replacing Mason alongside Glenn “Gomez” Addams in mornings on TK99 will be Galaxy programming honcho Mimi Griswold.\n\nBig news from eastern MASSACHUSETTS, and you read it first here in NorthEast Radio Watch: this fall’s schedule at WBZ-TV (Channel 4) in Boston won’t include news at 5 PM weekdays. Instead, NERW has learned that “CBS4” plans to move Dr. Phil from 3 PM to 5 PM (it can’t air at 4 PM, against Oprah on WCVB Channel 5), where it will replace the hour of news that’s been airing there for years. WBZ will then launch a 4 PM newscast to challenge WHDH-TV (Channel 7), which now has the local news audience to itself that early in the afternoon.\n\nOut in western Massachusetts, Vox closed on its $2.025 million purchase of the three Berkshire Broadcasting stations last week, adding WNAW (1230 North Adams), WMNB (100.1 North Adams) and WSBS (860 Great Barrington) to a cluster that already includes WUHN (1110 Pittsfield), WBEC (1420 Pittsfield), WUPE (95.9 Pittsfield) and WBEC-FM (105.5 Pittsfield), though the latter has a pending application to move out of the market to Easthampton.\n\nFifteen Years Ago: May 14, 1999\n\nOur top story this week comes from CANADA, where the CBC has departed the AM dial in Montreal after 77 years. On Thursday, listeners to CBM (940) heard programming interrupted every ten minutes by a recorded announcement to switch to FM beginning at midnight. When the hour arrived, CBC Radio One programming was interrupted mid-promo for a repeating loop directing listeners to “88.5 on the FM dial” — CBME, the 4000-watt replacement for CBM’s booming 50-kilowatt class-A signal. The loop then ran for 24 hours, ending with no fanfare at midnight Friday. The CBC seems to already realize that the 88.5 signal is inadequate to reach the old CBM audience; they asked the CRTC this week for permission to boost power to 16900 watts (presumably directional to protect adjacent-channel WXLU 88.3 in Peru NY and WWPV 88.7 in Colchester VT), and they’re reportedly being deluged with calls from listeners who can’t hear the FM replacements.\n\nFor the next few months, DXers might get some interesting catches on 940, but Montreal won’t be gone long. Expect the CRTC to decide within a few months among the several applicants for 940 and 690, abandoned earlier this year by CBF.\n\nWe’ll edge back onto our home turf way up in northern MAINE, where Andy Soule has moved on to a new job as morning jock, PD, promotions, operations, and sales at WDME (103.1) in Dover-Foxcroft. Soule was doing sales for the last few months at the Presque Isle combo of WQHR (96.1)/WBPW (96.9)/WOZI (101.9), after several years as PD/operations manager for the group. Also departing WBPW is longtime morning guy J.R. Mitchell, who’s now a beer distributor. OM/PD Rick Davis slides across the hall from WQHR to take over mornings at WBPW, while Jason McKay comes aboard to do mornings on Q96.1.\n\nWe’re saddened to report the passing of a VERMONT radio institution. Bob Kimel came to the Green Mountain State in 1959 when he purchased WWSR (1420), making good on a promise to own his own station by age 35. Kimel had been sales manager at WHAV AM-FM in Haverhill, Mass. In later years, he added WSNO/WORK in Barre, WLFE St. Albans, and (for a while) WEHW Windsor Locks, Connecticut to his station group. Kimel also went to work for a station brokerage group, then started his own firm, New England Media, which he ran until his retirement in 1990. Kimel suffered a stroke on Thursday, May 6. He was 74. He’s survived by his wife, Bea, and sons John and David.\n\nAnd with that, it’s on to NEW YORK, beginning down in the Big Apple, where banned-in-Boston Opie & Anthony were handing out CDs on the sidewalk in front of WNEW (102.7). The duo claimed they were getting rid of the station’s music collection to prepare for the rumored switch to all-talk.\n\nPlenty of changes this week in Albany, beginning at WKLI (100.9)/WKBE (100.3 Warrensburg), which has started using the “Point” nickname that briefly surfaced across town at 104.9 earlier this spring. We hear a new jock lineup will be unveiled soon to go along with the modern AC format.\n\nIn the Mohawk Valley, WODZ (1450 Rome) has dropped its simulcast with oldies FM WODZ-FM (96.1) to take on religion from new owner Bible Broadcasting and new calls WYFY. At rhythmic CHR WOWZ (97.9 Whitesboro)/WOWB (105.5 Little Falls), John Carucci takes over as PD from the departed J.P. Marks. Carucci was promotion manager at WSEN (92.1 Baldwinsville) in the Syracuse market."
