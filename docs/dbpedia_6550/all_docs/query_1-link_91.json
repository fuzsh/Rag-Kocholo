ADDRF.SS TO CHRISTIANS ON OBSEEVIlia THE CONCERT OF PRATER INSTITUTED FOR THE AXEHICAN EOVCATIOK BOGIE- TT, AVD FOR THOIS inn>ER ITl PA^ TROITAOB. JFrknds of tlit Lord Jesus^ When yon think of the vast muUi* tildes who are to be supplied with the prrachuig of the go^ptl, we doubt not tluu your heat la an- ruDved, and that you long to see llie number ol lierivld:^ increased who are to carry to them the n)es5ages of heavenly mercy. When you hear that eocie- ties have been formed to eneourage young men of pronaiae to seek an ed- ooatioD for the ministry, you rejoice, and contribute freely of your proper^ ty to aid the design But is it felt, as it should be, that the most impor- tant of all means for accomplishing this ohject, is prayer ? This was the means which the Saviour directed his disciples to use, wfien he spread before them the sj)iritual waiUs of Ju- dea, ** Pray the Lord of the hnr- vest, that iic will scndjorlk laborers into his harvest\" The direction is as appropriate and as necessary now, as it ever was. If ministers of the gospel are to be pro- vided, in eufficient numbers to meet the wants of the world, there must be fervent and effectual prayer for this end. Christians must every where pray with more faith, and with more importunity Human effort alone is totally inadcfjii itr to the work of pre- paring men lor llie ministry. There must he divine, as well as huniun teaching ; an expcr iaiental acciuaiti- tancc with tlio truths to be taught, as well as a speculative knowMgeofj tbem. Ifi-Cfod do not prepare men ! for this holy calling, they will never be prepared for it. Neither human learning, nor societies for patronizing indigent young men, nor millions of nioiiBy, wiH' avail any thing without the enlightening and sanctil'yuig influ- ence of the Holy Spirit. Other means are Indeed necessary, but they cannot, combined, qualify one soul for the work of an ambassador of Christ, if this influence be withheld. As important, then, as it b,that the millions who are destitute, should be furnished with the preaching of the gospel, so important is it, that Chris- tians should he encratred in unlff f! rrnd earnest prat/er for those spiritual giftb and qualifications which nrp requisite to fit men for the sacred (.nire The Directors of the American EcJucdiiou Society would he deeply impressed with this truth, themselves, and they would, Christian friends, labor to impress it indelibly upon your minds. However dependeni other institnlNNis may be upon the Messing of God for success, and there is not one which is not dependent, it is certain that this Society must utterly fail without it. Without help from on high, it will never furnish one herald of sal- vation, as he should be, for the high duties of his station. We implore you, therefore, by all the good which the Society may do if God should prosper it, and hy all the evil which it will inflict on the world if he should not; by the endless happiness, or wo, of the millions who are proba- bly to be saved or lost through its in- fluence, to pray for it when you lie down, and when you rise up ; in tbe closet, and in tbe social circle ; when you gather around the fiunily altar, and when you mingle your devotions in the sanctuary. The conductors of t!ie Societv would in this way ?eek a (ifilli/ remembrance in the auppiica- ti'Kis of the Christian Church. But whiic they do this, they would es- pecially invite ihu tr iends of the Lord Jesus to bear in mind the season for united prayer wbieh has been recent- ly instituted, on the Tuesday after- noon and evening immediately fol- lowing the first Monday of every month. This concert was begun by the young men nnder the patronage of the societyi and is now observed Digitized by Google IW. AUbKESB TO in all the collcfres nnd seminaries vbere they are pursuing their stu- dses. Four leading topics of prayer are kept in view. The fir^f, has ref- erence lo the young mtii theiiiselvcs, that they may be holy anJ devoted ■leu, prepared for « life of actife la- lior, asd of naafoloess ; ihe stemd, fefera lo the Society, that it may erer be kept under the guidance of heateiiy and be preeeffed Irom pei^ fenioii ; the third, respects those who are dettitote of the g^pel in our own country and in other parts of the world, that thev may speedily he piipplied wiih faithul pastors and inissinturics ; tnd t!ip fourth topic relates to rcvi' ral< uj rtlti^tun in academies and col- eges, that hundreds ot younq; »nen in ihem may lie converted to God, and become preachers of righteousness. Each of these important subjects of prayer is exhibited, at length, in a priated eoiMtitotion adopted by the jottog men^ and roaj be seen in the tppendis to the Ele? enth Aaaoal Re- port. And now, Christians of every name, we come to you, and ask, will you help u\", hy your prayers^ while we go forw:K(j m thi*? arfliion^, nnri difficult, b'Jt <jl'»ri;>tis f ntcr j>ri'^L', r)[' raisitijT up hhon r:* lor the, wide spread iiiii &[)ir- iluai liarvcst ?

The lime for prayer <iud effort is short.

Though thi« l:»pse of lime not crral, it is sufficient to tltbrd some ti >i uf tiie principles and de- s^pw which were then avowed, and of Us* practicability of accompiislMng ilic j;rc.»r objects uliicb were then contempl<itetl. 1 have been an observer of the whole proc«s», from the iodpioat aseasures to the pres- ent advanced state of llie work; (and there are many others who have boea observers also ;) and I feel warranted io sayinfT, that the cause ef educatins pinus young men for the gospel ministry has giunod a coo^ieto afid absplute triunBh. But let me not be understood as p«yici|^ a tribute to human wisdom. All I roeao by tbo triinnph of the cause is, that those, who engaged in it, judged ngbtly aa lo ilie idain dii^ of sanding labOTeie Into ^km Lord's harvest Jliey saw the cxigeocy of the case ; they delibcrnted as to the means to be used, and the object to be gained; and, casting ilmnselwec wp^a Providence, tliey detemuned to do sonan thing toward providing faithful preachers for the destitute parts of our own iaod, snd IhejperMiing ihiHIent ef heethen eow* tries. Tbey determined to do sornethinft* which should answer for a specimen of wiial should afterwards be accomplit^iied, on a more extensive scale and under more favored auspices. There were not wanlinp persons, whn objected to the plan, on what tlicy deem- ed practical groimds ; and among the eln* cere friend*! of Christ and of th<>ir coun- try, there were some who hesitated to give their approbation, and were incltoed to predict » nilure. The pilodpal grouadf of objection end hesitntion ^ere the three following. 1. The need of a great number of addi- tional ministers ef tM Gospel was thought to be much less urgent, than the fouiid> ers of our Education Societies bad repre- sented. The fact, however, flnt* etrong representations had been enade, led In in- quiry and thorough investigation; and at nuiy bo cooaldered ss cf^Mveljr proved, if it Is not universally admitted, Oiat there arc mfHions of people In United Stetee who are not within the reach of the reg- ular ministrations o( the Gospel, and wha cannot re<;eive religious tfiaching at aM* unless the number of preachers be great- ly aujnnented ; and who cannot he wt l! taught, uuiass vigorous and perse vehng eflbiti ai«k npdf) le. have theioiighly edor rated men brought into the. ministry* The fourt(!er4 of Education Societief Ifcre ft^t therefore on this point. nfify effofts wnvid net, indseasg th(^ |Mfni« ber of educated ministers; for it was sup- posfi4* ^^^^ the young men, who were \" Kir the eihdstrr, already ebtifoetf an m$m eWwr in thn mmmn nf iiiem> I or their Mmi»,\\»lf nmnt of «x- bMynfifuury exertioof. On particular io- ijatry, however, it wa\"« found that vfry u.uty youths of promising character to ft£iy aod laleatii coMkl jbe brought into the ttrvice of the church, if the expense uf their education, or a part of if, could be uefrdycJ from charitable .<<()uice4. Aad vhifo thi« iovMtifatkm was ^oing oo, 'Jitf Spirit of the Lord was poured out, and ui^y new rofiverts were pr»-f).ired for eu* terin^ upou a courte of educatiao. And fo ir bu cooliiUMd Ull the preseat hour, when tlierc arc probably thousands of young toeo, between the apes of fiAeen iod twenty live, whu inight be traiped for Iho Bini^try, if every practkablo osertion w.^re mule to bring them forth to tho work. The onmber now in a course of education i< greatly increa^d by wiiat ha« been tkmt^ dooe. Probably at lowl twice 1* many arc looking: to the ministry, a» there would have been, it no extraordina- ry iDoreinent had been made ; and l\\m pro*pect at proeont is, that the tdnnm \"sr;!! be still more rapid, ?o long as (b4 vaats of tiie workJ shall be unsuppliod, nd the disciples of Christ »ball be williog H do Mr doty. 3. It was urged that, even if the ^o^t\\- rouoo should he found as great m had kca atteged, aod if young meo in great iimAerf coura bo educated by clmftebli tSoTtn, itifl one formidolilo difficulty would tetMio.

If the people wtaoed for preachers, it ndfJed, they would apply for them aod secure thMD, to accordfuice with the rmmmU gHMdn.lhtt Hm aupply wUl keep pace with the denaod. It was ur- ?e<l, by way of answer, (hat ministers couid Dot be «up|>lted to meet the demand M ibev wopo flfft odnotted; and |hat, though destitute people might not (eel Dtcir wants so deeply, as to send a thou* m4 miles for a chrffya^n, aod thett wait mni yean for the cmtplBtioa of bia pre- ymiary studies; yet (bey nught gladly aettie a mini«iter, who should present hiin^ «ei( before them, in the AiU esertiaa of tbs okrical AiBalloiiti and in Ibe pospai- Koa of all those attaioments, whieh.tffould pKMEtxe a life of eminent useffflne**!*.

Tliat this is the fact ia beyond all rational controversy. Mlu h more thnn this might be asserted ; and with the pains now taken, in the for^ nttloB of the chtncfer of the benefida- ilee, we may hope tliey will acifdre a firmness of purpose, a hutnble sense of Hieir dependence on God, and a apirit of liDly enterprise, wtdch eludl be Mlowed by fi;reat bleaaiocs apoa thehr labon. But our refifftovjs public must make up their mindji to admit, what we are daily taught by obeervation and expedience, aa well oa by the Scripfores, that kwnan agents are nhrnyn hnptrfeet ; and Mmetimes tho«!e, in whom great conhdeoce has been plac- ed« pfove radically unaonnd tad corrupt. Unless Christians have moral courage enough to look at these truths without (ii<i- may, they are not yet prepared for liie ar- doooa ezertlona of die present timea. Ate we to sit down with folded hands, and wait till a race of perfect men shall ap- pear? or till the agency of men shall be •uperaeded by the mlniatry of angele f Ve shall do so at our peril. We shall do so with the certain foreboding of hearint; Urom our offended Judge the awful words, Yt UMikeda$»d tM^kd aerooiifi, addreaaed to ourselves. Let it then be spttU il once for all, lhat beneficiaries of JulducaUuo Societies, and irho eapertsteod their eoiine of pre* paration for the ministry ; — that mis^ona* rfes, and tboiO who have the eaelgnaiefit of their fielda of labor, are, like their fel- low profe'^^or-i of ('!iri-ii \\ntt^^ liable to err, encouipassed with inttrunttes, and ex- posed 10 the flHiltlpUed danger*, tempta- tions, and sins, of wbidi the hiatoty of th ' church affords so niany cx3nj|>le?.

And here. Sir, you will permit mn to al- lude tn i\\ <\\ihj(^ct of preat interest. WiUuu a year past, a clergyman io the prime of Kle, oeeopyiof^ a deairable otntioB, and one of great «'^efuTno«, has been re- moved from a beloved prnple, by the voice of the churches, and made the raoat im- portant agent, in conducting the aflfairv of this Society.

Of hia deep and lively interest io the extension of the I^p lf^o rm^r's kirij:dom, it is universally lioown that he has long given the moat aobatantial evidence. His property, he habitually felt, was a talent committed to him. to be u-rd for the plo- ly of God, and the good of fantily and of the world. Deeply, I have had the moat aatufiictory evidence, did he feel the responsibility involved in its possession ; and earnest was his solicitude that he niicht be found fidthflil hi hia trust. His charities have been long continued, muni- ficent, widely extended, and applied to every variety of proper objects. The poor have lived upon hia Itounty. Many are the widow? and the fatherless child- ren whori) he has rescued from want and wo. Mdiiy are the friends wiioiu hi:* lib- erality has aided, and comforted. Very inariy are (he souls which hi« beneficence hoa er)li<:hlene(J. and sanctil'jcd, atul sav- ed. He did not indeed give as much in praporUom to hu means sonic in more moderate circumstances. This, whatever may be thought of the question of duty, was not, at least in the present state of the church and the woeM, to be expect- ed. Bui there baa, I believe^ no man of wealth lived and died fai tUt eooatry wiao has in proportion (o liis ability, done a*o much for the cansr of charity It i\"* to be remembered also, thai he was educated, and his babita formed, when, in thia eooii* try, liberal benefactions were unknown. With liitn, it may ahiiost he said, be:::;%n that spirit of liberality, which has sprung up, and apread so tapldly In our eoainMH> nity. It t<« al«n to be recollected, that most of the measures and as^^oci'itioas now in operation for extending the bless- ings of education, of civilization, and of rt>h_Mnn, were fornicil after he had pasgcd the meridian of life ; and that he was, from his habits of thinking and feeling rather averse to new and untried expe- dients. Yet scarcely a mca«fiirc ha?? been adopted or an association formed, in this city and vicinity, for the Improvement of the physical, the intellectual, the morul, or the spiritual condiiion of men. whirfi has not received his co-operation and Itis liberal support. Nor did thIa procee4 from an ostentation of charity, or n btUid impulse of generosity. No man was ever farther from ostentation in his ch.irities; and in reference to all new applk«ttona to his bounty, he always tooic time for deliberation, consultation, and prayer. Of the numerous plans which have, with- in a few yearn, been adopted for the pro- motion of evanpp'ical rcIiKinn, I know of but one to which he wliolly refused his co-operation ; and it U a remarkable fact, that that one is now generally regarded as havirijx entirely failed. ** I confess tiiat when I consider a!! these circumstances, I look will) wonder, — and I hope with gratitude to God whose prace made him what he was, — at tlie variety and the amount of his chari- ties.

Sapid growth ofpopulatwn in the Uni- Um Staie§» An intelligent genUeiDMi who has long resided in Ohio, was recently in New England, and, to show the rapid growth of the popubtion in the 9tate where he belongs, which already exceeds 800,000, italed to another genilfiniin thuf lie had wcertaioed, alter careful inquiry, tivo factf of great intereft on this suhjcct ; one WM, that there is not a native bom citi- wn iti the state a? old as liiiiHi If, and he i5 but 4d i and the other, that Ohio i^, at the pteaent time, the greateet emigi ating sute in the Union. Yet thi« is but specimen of what U talcing place in the Western states sen- cnDy: 9T yeara ago the entire rate population beyond the All^hany amount- ed, by actual cntiUMrafion, to scarcely otu humUed thousand ; now it is more than il*r«0 mSHem^ At the same time the Atlantic states have been steadily in- creiiin«T.

Nothing can atop the enormoua evil, but the e-fnhlishment of Chri-iti.m colo- nies alonj; the coant. The inOuenee of the British colony at Sierra Leone has been already extensively felt. A short lime since a tribe, from whoine shores fifteen or twenty thousand captives had been an- nually embarked on hoard of slave s^hips, put theniselvee under the protection of the colony, and are now no longer trou- bled with the dealers in human ^h. The late Gen. Turner tecently wrote from the colony and stated, that he had but little doubt that the slave trade would be Mpecdiiy abolished for a thousand miles around Sierra Leone. Our aettlement at Liberia already guards 150 miles of the lonp; haunlcd roast. Twenty such col- onies as Sierra Leone and Liberia spread- ing along the western shore of Africa, at suitable distances, woidd put an end to the slave trade forever, and ditfuse the light of Christianity over a large part of the African continent.

The American Board of Commis*4ioners for foreign Missions have forty three sta- tions among the heathen, and about the saiDf number of ordained niinisterr^. These would supply one county of 50,000 in- habitanta, with Christian institutions, at home. The annual receipts of the Board are greater than those of any benevolent Society in the United Statea: and yet there are tmiwuliials in the country whose yearly private income exceeds those re- ceipts, and wlio could therefore, if dispos- ed, do more for Foreign Missions, tliaa the Chrialian community now do.

The money which H»ey receive from the Society does but barely pay for hoard and tuition ; leaving book$t clothiu)(, and other expenses, to be defrayed by aucli otlHsr means as they can find. Many worthy young men are eAm in want of comfortable clothing. Thil ii the case at the present time, with HOW whose waDta have come to the knowledge of the Directors. The arti- cles most in demand are cloths suitablt' to be made up intu co^it^t and pantaloons, lo general, it If deddediy better, to leave the cloth to be made up, as it is called tor by the indigent student biinself, tlun to Mod it manufactured into garments. It it also found on eiperieoce, that there is less advantage from xecojui hand clotlies, than might be supposed by the ^oeora. Not only are alterations and re- pairs frequently necesjary, and expensive, H'Jt the jirnient is les3 durable, and if ll>e texture happens to be very fine, as it will be, It subjects the student to the charge oif estravaganee from those who acu ignorant of the manner in which received the garment. Pieces of cloth, ■di as discreet 'persons would judge suit- »^le for the beoeticiaries of the Society in the Tiriou^ stages of education, of a dark color, either gray or black* cotton or WMlee, and ooeh •• may be bad at most 01 our maoufactlirillg establishmenU in exchange for the mw matori.d, would be exceediagly useful and very thanlUiiUy '•«i»ei. If a few neighbors would each contribute a small quantity of wool, or •ome other material, and exchange it at manufiactones for cloth, they might with a small sacriBce to themselves, great- ly ai.M<«t the young men whom the society patronizes. Of shirts, there is, at pre- ■pf. a supply. Cravats and handker- ^^lefj are wanted. Socks for snmmer are wmte.l ; and a few, in addition to those ao» on hand, for winter.

Twen- ty five young: men under the patron- age of the Annerican Education Socie- ty, some of tbem youth of the highest promise^ have heen eat doiro within the last twetre yean, while engaged b their preperatory studies. A still lii^er number, for want of health, have entirely lalled of their object, or entered upon the duties of the minis- trr with ficreativ fVimini'^hed menn** of usenjlneas. The ch^ns^e which is ex- perience<l in passin^;' from an active and UlK)riou!« employment to a seden- tary and studious life, as is of\\en the Case with those who go into the roin- lury, is greater than matt constitii- tions will bear* FVeqaent, systematic, tad hhorlmis exercise is requisite to ai^hitaiD the iinimal fnoctions, and to pr^^rve their a^nstomed vigour. to the hig^hest point of <iucce8S, until thiit most invaluatdc ol earthly bless- ings, mem $ana in corpore mno, shall become a common possession or lite- rary DMD. Various methods have been devised for accomplishing this object Gyn^ nastic exercise$ iuve recently lieen in^* troduced into several of the colleges, and, it is thougfht, with pfood effect. But, the diffic!ilty, common in al- most all plans ot exercise, (hat of keeping up a uniform and lively in- terest in the students iind persuading them to be regular in their exercise, attends this scheme also ; indi if we may ja4g^ from the appearances of neglect already visible within the pre- cincts of gymnastic grounds, their util- ity Is likely to be, in many cases, of limited duration. In arldition to thi«^ the frcqfient interrnp) lions to which this mode of exercise is liahle, when taken in the open air, in consequence of the weather, and it^ want of con- geniality, as usually practised, with toe feelings and habits of serious young men, make It doubtful wheth^ er it can ever be generally introduced among this class of students. ^ricitUural labour has sometimes To provide the mean* of such exer- been resorted to for the same general tke, is of the fir«t importance to the ohiect, and in a few in-^tances, acade- locce^srul prosecution of a course of mie.s have been instituted, with small Study in any of o ur public seminaries farms appended, on wiiicii itie stu- of learnings. It is gratifying to observe dents are required to work several that this suiiject is taking strong hold hours every day. Such is the plan of efthe public mind. It augurs well for the Methodist seminary established at the fatore osefolnem of our public and Readfield In the state of Mahie, where ptofesiioiial n^n ; for never will In- the students pay for their boaid, and, taUcctual and motal effort be canied , in some Instancesi Ibr their tnltion Digitized by Google 18 9LAX or IXSftCIfB 121 TBMOL, mmAtOtt AmMMU also, by means of their labour. A similar institution has been lately commenced in Oneida county in the stale of New York. Where the entire plan of an InstitutioD is constructed with reference to such a system of •zercbe, and it is made the duty of the oflicen and ttudeiiti to conform to it, with the same regularity which f» obaerfed in other departnientefSiie- ceit may reaaoiuibly be eipected; but where arrangements are made for agricultural labour, and the stu- dents are left to perfonn it or not as their feelings or conrenience shall dictate, all experience leads us to an- ticipate a failure. The fluctuations of the weather and the change of the seasons, the necessity of being provi- ded with different suits of clothing, and the numher and expensiveness of the preparations needed for a large institution, were there no other ob- 8taclet| would proTent this mode of exercise from lieing extensifely a- dopted. Anotlier mode, and one which gives, at least in our estimation, fair- er promise of success, is that of a regular system of me^nical labour. An experiment, recently made by an association of young men in the The- ological Seminary at Andover, has strengthened this belief.* Twenty five of the students voluntarily united some months since, and placed them- selves under the obligations of a writ- ten constitution. A professed mechan- ic was obtained, who received a fixed compensation for his services, and de- voted his whole time to the business of the work shop, as SuperinUndent and Agent. A building was provided and fitted up with the necessary ap- paratus. The association was divid- ed into two companies, and each di- vision l;»l)()ured three times a day, be- * It !• proper to ttata thai the ttndents of the aem- inary hiiv*- Miriun^ mi'tliodi of Uikin^: excrciM which hnre nt»t only b*H)ii jwofiuhb tu ihomitelvet, but liighly upr>rul to the Miiiinarjr. The labour boatowod ^Mm ia the oonttfuotioo of c ravol w^Um, dnfing ZSTr*^ year, couM not it la belwved have been hir- M lor a kniii Bum than five hundreH tlollitrii.

Monitors were appoint to note tardiness and iibsences, fines were inflicted in case of dellp- quency. The work was laid out for every student by the saperintendent^ and the articles manofactored were disposed of b^ him for the benefit of the association. With these avails, amd with the eamhigB of the snperlates^ dent in other ways, a treasury wa* formed, from which the superinten- dent in the first place was to be paid, and the remainder, should there be any, was to be applied or divided as the association should direct. Thus I the association proceeded throug-h I the summer, and no recitation or oth- I er exercise in the seminary was more 1 regularly or constantly attended by the students, during the whole term than this. The result has more than answered their eipectations. Each member of the association has hmd more than one hmdrtd hmtr$ of ayste- matic and profitable exercise, leavlQir him time forother kinds of recreatioa if he has desired to have them. The effect has been happy both upon the health and spirits of the members, and they have been enabled to pursue their studies with greater pleasure and advantacre. More than two ihou- sand boxes of various descriptions, be- sides chests, bedsteads, tables, and other articles of furniture, have been manufactured, and have found a rea- dy sale under the direction of the su- perintendent A sufficient sum haa thus been earned to pay the wages of the superintendent, and to pur- chase stock ; leaving a balance In fa- vour of the association of on^ hundred and eigkuen dollars^ most of which has been expended in the purchase of tools. Such has been the result for a single term, notwithstandingr that the asfiociation has had to contend with the difficulties incident to a iiew un- dertaking. Future efforts, it may rea- sonably be hoped, will show stilf high- er success.

In the introduction, the preiicher shows that the words of the text be- long pro*»minently to Chrt*:!. But, as in every re-ipcrt in which rompnri*ion Is ndmis^sible, Christ is the great pat- tern for ministers in all asres. he em- ploys the text to illustrate the con- nexion between sonnH leaminjj^, and sinoplicity, nnd adaptedoess io comani- nicatiitg divine truth. It Is an obvious fact, that no one can eommanfciite clearly what he does sot himseir fully apprehend.
