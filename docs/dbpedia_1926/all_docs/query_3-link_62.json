        "text": "Introduction\n\nWhether last year's shutdowns encouraged authors to write more or not, it's clear that publishers were able to provide a year's worth of wonderful titles.\n\nSales of books in 2021 were even higher than the year before, when readers and writers alike spent much time isolated during the coronavirus pandemic. The NPD BookScan showed that as of Nov. 13, year-to-date sales so far are 11% higher than 2020 and up 20% over 2019.\n\nSo, what to read?\n\nEvery year, the Post-Dispatch offers a selection of local reviewers' favorite titles, supplemented by wire service reviews. This year, it leans heavily on fiction, including thick novels such as \"Cloud Cuckoo Land\" and \"Crossroads.\" Twenty books, although they'll keep readers busy, are only a fraction of the fine output this year.
