My passion fuels my pursuits, driving me to push boundaries and challenge conventions. Overall, I am an amicable person who like to meet new people and take new challenges.â\n\nZainab Aldaoseri\n\nB.A. in English Language and Literature, University of Basrah (Basra, Iraq)\n\nResearch Interests: âI am deeply passionate about medieval and Renaissance studies, literary theory, and comparative literature. However, my greatest interest is the application of psychological theories as well as moral philosophy to literary criticism. It's a way for me to understand life and the human condition through literature, and it thus contributed to my belief that literature is life itself. Understanding literature helps us gain new perspectives about human nature and reality.â\n\nâI've always been fascinated by cultures, languages, and literature, which led me to major in English Language and Literature. Additionally, I'm a music enthusiast and a cat mom. Besides Arabic (my native language) and English, I can speak a little German and even less Persian (which I only started learning recently).â\n\nMd. Sayed Ali\n\nB.A. in English Literature, Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (Sylhet, Bangladesh)\n\nM.A. in English Literature, Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (Sylhet, Bangladesh)\n\nResearch Interests: Feminism and cultural studies, Gender, Race and Sexuality , post-colonialism, Existentialism, Cultural Hegemony\n\nâI have always been drawn to literature, especially novels, and my quest for knowledge in this area has led me to explore further. I am always open to discussing differing opinions and thoughts in a friendly manner, while avoiding personal attacks.â\n\nEmma Bacak\n\nB.A. in English, University of North Texas (Denton, TX)\n\nResearch Interests: Dystopian literature, with an emphasis in Race and Ethnic literature.\n\nâI was raised in College Station, Texas and completed my bachelors in English with honors at the University of North Texas in Denton, Texas! I am very excited to continue my study of literature and explore Fayetteville and the Ozarks.â\n\nEmily Birtwistle\n\nB.A. in English and Comparative Literature, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\n\nResearch Interests: Southern American literature, Modern American literature, feminist and gender studies, and Shakespeare\n\nâI started reading when I was two years old, and I haven't been able to put a book down since! After graduating from UNC, I worked as a sixth grade language arts teacher in Raleigh, NC, to help connect younger students with their own love for literature. I hope to continue that mission at UARK, and eventually become an English professor myself!â\n\nAmber Black\n\nB.A. in English Literature and History, John Brown University (Siloam Springs, AR)\n\nM.A. in History of Warfare, King's College London (London, England, United Kingdom)\n\nM.A. in History, University of Arkansas\n\nResearch Interests: Previous research focused on the Cold War; planning to continue that focus by researching the writings of Kurt Vonnegut in a Cold War context.\n\nâI have just finished my second MA in history. I hold a double BA in English literature and history. I am passionate about the humanities and enjoy roller skating and reading in my spare time.â\n\nTeyaira Bonds\n\nB.A. in English and Psychology, Henderson State University (Arkadelphia, AR)\n\nResearch Interests: African American Literature, Pop Culture, Feminist Studies, Young Adult Fiction\n\nâOriginally from Arkansas with a love of reading and education. My hope is to continue learning and teaching, honing my craft through what literature can teach me.â\n\nTaylor Brown\n\nB.A. in English Education, Southwest Baptist University (Bolivar, MO)\n\nResearch Interests: feminist studies, gender and sexuality, folklore, regional literature, horror and gothic literature, Modern American literature, religion and spirituality\n\nâI was born and raised in Northwest Arkansas and earned my bachelor's degree in English education in Southwest Missouri. After four years, I'm so glad to be back home and to continue furthering my education in the subject I am so passionate about. I love how stories bring us together and I believe that we are made kinder and more understanding through literature's recognition of our similarities and its celebration of our differences.â\n\nCharlotte Cassidy\n\nB.A. in English and Theatre, University of North Carolina at Pembroke\n\nPost-Baccalaureate focus: Psychology, Columbia University (New York, NY)\n\nResearch Interests: Victorian Literature, Science Fiction, Adaptation Theory, Psychoanalysis, Horror, and Gothic Fiction\n\nâMy name is Charlotte and I have a pig named Wilbur and a pig named Waddles; my guinea pigs. I am a singer, writer, actress, film buff, and theatre nerd. In melding my creative arts interests with my research interests I intend to focus on what changes need to be made in adapting literature to the stage and to film. I am also interested in researching fear. Science fiction, crime fiction, and horror fiction are three genres that give us insight into what different societies and cultures are afraid of, as do a culture's myths. I suggest that people are most afraid of the unknown. The unknown as a fear seems to me to transcend cultural differences. I would, if possible, include how scientific discoveries make people afraid, even when the developments are meant to improve life. Societal frictions often appear to be struggles between those who believe in science and ideas as positive potentials, and those who fear the new as other and risky.â\n\nAbel Fenwick\n\nB.A. in English, Royal Holloway University of London (Egham, Surrey, England, United Kingdom)\n\nB.A. Thesis: ââBinding the Woundâ: A Trauma Theory Reading of Frankenstein and Wuthering Heightsâ\n\nCertificate in Secondary English Education, University of Sunderland (Sunderland, England, United Kingdom)\n\nResearch Interests: The interplay of psychology, horror and the gothic in literature, representations of queer identities on film, Victorian and Neo-Victorian texts, and media conflations of region, identity and class.\n\nâAttending Royal Holloway University of London as a mature student allowed me to understand the value of education as a ladder to progression, a lifechanging experience which made me determined to help others climb the rungs. My choice to apply for a Master's degree in English is shaped by my desire to further delve into how literature continues to both reflect and shape the world. I am pursuing the Regional and Ethnic Literature specialist track to deepen my understanding of the power literature holds to both perpetuate and undermine wider hegemonic discourses surrounding the âotherâ within the context of the United States, an interest sparked through my membership of the Italian American Studies association and my own independent study. I look forward to learning more about the rich history of the United States and exchanging ideas with my new cohort - I'm always up for a chat and a tea!â\n\nRyan Glover\n\nB.A. in French, University of Arkansas\n\nResearch Interests: gender and sexuality, speculative fiction, afrofuturism, and film studies.\n\nâAfter some time off since achieving my Bachelorâs in French, I am very excited to return to the University of Arkansas to continue my studies of literature. I am particularly interested in literature and film relating to queer stories and experiences. In my free time I can usually be found patronizing local bookstores and libraries, attending book clubs, and watching as many movies as possible.\"\n\nJohn Hannon\n\nB.A. in History, Criminal Justice, and Sociology, University of Arkansas\n\nâI'm in the process of writing my first novel, it's historical fiction set in the early 1100s. I got into reading about that period about 2 years ago and fell in love with it and that's in part what led me to want to go back to school and study it in more depth and detail. My research interest pertains to more or less the period from 1000-1200, the period of history that Dr. Smith is an expert in. That's the main reason I wanted to study here, to benefit from his expertise on the long 12th century.â\n\nChristopher Jester\n\nB.A. in Rhetoric and Writing, University of Arkansas at Fort Smith\n\nResearch Interests: Southern American Literature, 20th Century American Literature, The Lost Generation, Ancient History, Philosophy, Religion\n\nâI was born and raised in Fort Smith, AR, and currently live in Van Buren, AR. A lot of my free time is spent reading mostly classic literature, watching films, collecting vinyls, or drawing what interests me. I welcome the opportunity to learn more about the literary world and its history to deepen my understanding so that I can hopefully become an English professor.â\n\nMary Beth Kemp\n\nB.A. in English and Journalism, University of Arkansas\n\nResearch Interests: Medieval literature, gender and feminist studies, folklore and mythology\n\nâI love exploring new worlds through reading, and I believe that literature is a vital tool for understanding each other and fostering empathy. When I'm not reading, I love going to concerts, wandering museums, and thrifting!â\n\nBlake Laird\n\nB.A. in English, B.A. in Political Science, University of Arkansas at Little Rock\n\nM.A. in Political Science, Arkansas State University (Jonesboro, AR)\n\nResearch Interests: Political Theology and Modern American Literature\n\nâI am a family-oriented person. When I am not hanging out with my family, I like to wander around libraries, visit coffee shops and read in solitude. From a social standpoint, I enjoy going to academic presentations that are related to my research interests as well as starting/joining reading groups. Lastly, I enjoy deep sea fishing and being out on the water in general.â\n\nMorgan Lee\n\nB.A. in English Literature with a minor in Classical Studies, California State University, Long Beach\n\nResearch Interests: medieval literature; Renaissance literature; classical literature and philosophy; ethnic literature\n\nâI am originally from Los Angeles, CA. I have spent the past seven years living and working in Memphis, TN. I've been an educator for almost 20 years (yes, I am that old). For the past two years, I have been working as a 7th grade English teacher for a private online Christian school. I am a proud auntie to two cats...oh...and several humans as well.â\n\nMolly Mingo\n\nB.A. in English, Williams Baptist University (Walnut Ridge, AR)\n\nResearch Interests: world literature and cultural literature, as well as rhetoric and composition\n\nâI graduated from Williams Baptist University with a Bachelorâs degree in English. After graduating, I taught English as a second language in South Korea for 18 months. Iâm looking forward to continuing my studies at the UofA and hopefully get into the editing/publishing field after graduation!â\n\nAbigayle Money\n\nB.A. in English, College of the Ozarks (Point Lookout, MO)\n\nResearch Interests: English Renaissance literature, American Romanticism, Southern Gothic literature, and Religion\n\nâIâm originally from Southern Illinois, but my decision to pursue higher education led me to the Ozarks, which has been my home for the past four years. When Iâm not in class, you can find me either training for my next marathon, doodling in one of my many unfinished sketchbooks, or watching overly pretentious films. By continuing my education at UofA, I hope to one day become a humanities professor.â\n\nLauren Phillips\n\nB.A. in English and Communication Arts, Washington & Jefferson College (Washington, PA)\n\nResearch Interests: Psychoanalytic Literary Criticism, Gothic Literature, Poetry and Poetics, Trauma Studies, Theater and Drama, Gender and Sexuality\n\nâI grew up in the Gettysburg area, and one of my favorite memories is sitting atop Devilâs Den with my best friend as we debated the logistics of Thestralâs appearances in Harry Potter. Iâve always found great purpose in reading and poetry, and I hope to apply my studies to my goals of becoming an English professor and better understanding, connecting, and empathizing with myself and those around me. When Iâm not reading and writing, I often find myself watching and performing in plays and musicals, hiking and biking, and investing a bit too much time into video games and movies.â\n\nAllie Primm\n\nB.A. in Rhetoric and Writing, University of Arkansas at Fort Smith\n\nB.A. Honors Capstone: A pilot episode for an original sitcom called âApartment H8â; the defense involved a table read.\n\nResearch Interests: rhetoric and composition, literary theory, folklore, and genre fiction\n\nâI lived in the same little ranch-style house in the River Valley my entire life until I moved to Fayetteville about two years ago to work at the University. I recently married and we have what I believe is the cutest dog in the whole world-a Boston Terrier named Danny DeVito (he is a menace). In my free time I enjoy baking, playing RPG video games and D&D, embarrassing myself at karaoke, and rewatching my favorite sitcoms.â\n\nLydia Sharpe\n\nB.A. in Secondary English Education, Oklahoma Baptist Universty (Shawnee, OK)\n\nResearch Interests: Medieval/Renaissance literature or Classical literature\n\nâI am originally from Washington State; my family lived off of Hood Canal near Seattle. I prefer quiet coffee shops and being outside to pretty much anything else.â\n\nBethany Tilley\n\nB.A. in English, Harding University (Searcy, AR)\n\nB.A. Thesis: âAs a Jeweler Polishes a Stone, a Poet Turns a Phrase: The Language of Gemstones in Cheryl Savageauâs Mother/Landâ\n\nResearch Interests: film theory, feminist and gender studies, poetics, and Norse mythology\n\nâI have loved reading and films since I was young, but the hunger for further study of literature didnât fully take root until high school and then blossomed in my undergraduate studies. In my free time, I enjoy reading, watching movies, writing, spending time with my wife, weightlifting, and cuddling my cats.â\n\nAhsan Tohel\n\nGrew up and educated in Sylhet; lives in Dhaka, Bangladesh\n\nB.A. in English, Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (Sylhet, Bangladesh)\n\nB.A. Assignment: âMagical Realism in Gabriel GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquezâsStrange Pilgrimsâ\n\nM.A. in English, Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (Sylhet, Bangladesh)\n\nM.A. Monograph: âToni Morrisonâs The Bluest Eye: A Psychoanalytic Readingâ\n\nResearch Interests: English Language and Pedagogy, Media and Culture, Modern American Fiction and Drama, British Classics, Modern British Drama, South Asian Literature\n\nâThe best is yet to come. The best piece of work is yet to be done. The best of fictions is yet to be penned. We can always get beyond our limit in excellence.

When I'm not buried in a book you can find me climbing, sailing, hiking, or biking. I love new people, new experiences, and puzzles (even when my cat tries to eat the pieces).â\n\nPh.D. Students\n\nEmmy Aguayo\n\nB.A. in Spanish, University of Arkansas\n\nB.A. in French, University of Arkansas\n\nM.F.A. in Creative Writing & Translation, University of Arkansas\n\nTate Aldrich\n\noriginally from Laconia, NH\n\nB.A. in English Teaching, University of New Hampshire (Durham, NH)\n\nM.Ed., Plymouth State University (Plymouth, NH)\n\nResearch Interests: 20th Century American Literature and Gender Studies\n\nJessica L.

My research focuses on romance novels as a means to invite more conversations, especially topics often deemed too controversial, or uncomfortable, for public discussions. I like to ask âwhy notâ and I encourage other students to ask the awkward questions.â\n\nJanette Byrd\n\nB.A. in English and B.A. in Anthropolgy/Sociology, University of Arkansas\n\nM.A. in Applied Anthropology, Oregan State University (Corvallis, OR)\n\nM.A. Thesis: âServing Amid Institutional Camouflage: The Invisibility of School Food Service Workersâ\n\nResearch Interests: Narratives of missing and murdered Indigenous women, children, and men in Oklahoma, and gun violence in Arkansas.\n\nâMy research interests are rooted in developing narrative literacy and how it is used for social and cultural change. What narratives do we use to solve social and cultural contradictions or controversies that serve the status quo, how do those narratives intersect with power, and how do we construct new narratives that disrupt what is and usher in what can be? What tales do we tell ourselves and others to make sense of unjust acts or systems, and how do we learn how to âreadâ, interpret, internalize, and leverage them into actions?â\n\nOlivia Cash\n\noriginally from Pindall, AR\n\nB.A. in English and Writing, Drury University (Springfield, MO)\n\nM.A. in English (Specialization in Ethnic and Regional Studies), University of Arkansas\n\nResearch Interests:American South, Global South, Ecocriticism, and Medical Humanities\n\nBethany Cole\n\nB.A. in Philosophy, Oklahoma Baptist University (Shawnee, OK)\n\nM.A. in English, University of Arkansas\n\nResearch Interests: fantasy, the soul, religion and literature, mythology, translation, sacramental literature, Tolkien studies, liturgy\n\nâI previously earned a M.A. in English from the University of Arkansas and am thrilled to now be working towards a Ph.D. in Medieval Studies.
