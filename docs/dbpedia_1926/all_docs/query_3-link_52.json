        "text": "Judge Margaret McManus\n\nFY 2017 - 2022, New York Immigration Court\n\nPublished Oct 26, 2022\n\nJudge McManus was appointed as an Immigration Judge in January 1991. She received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the Catholic University of America in 1973, and a Juris Doctorate from Brooklyn Law School in 1983. Judge McManus was an attorney for Marion Ginsberg, Esquire from 1989 to 1990 in New York. She was in private practice in 1987 and 1990, also in New York. Judge McManus worked as a consultant to various nonprofit organizations on immigration matters including Catholic Charities and Volunteers of Legal Services from 1987 to 1988 in New York. She was an adjunct clinical law professor for City University of New York Law School from 1988 to 1989. Judge McManus served as a staff attorney for the Legal Aid Society, Immigration Unit, in New York, from 1983 to 1987. She is a member of the New York Bar.\n\nDeciding Asylum Cases\n\nDetailed data on decisions by Judge McManus were examined for the period covering fiscal years 2017 through 2022. During this period, court records show that Judge McManus decided 284 asylum claims on their merits. Of these, she granted asylum for 263, granted 0 other types of relief, and denied relief to 21. Converted to percentage terms, McManus denied 7.4 percent and granted 92.6 percent of asylum cases (including forms of relief other than asylum).\n\nFigure 1 provides a comparison of Judge McManus's denial rate each fiscal year over this recent period. (Rates for years with less than 25 decisions are not shown.)\n\nFigure 1: Percent of Asylum Matters Denied\n\nNationwide Comparisons\n\nCompared to Judge McManus's denial rate of 7.4 percent, Immigration Court judges across the country denied 63.8 percent of asylum claims during this same period. Judges at the New York Immigration Court where Judge McManus decided these cases denied asylum 34 percent of the time. See Figure 2.\n\nJudge McManus's asylum grant and denial rates are compared with other judges serving on the same court in this table. Note that when an Immigration Judge serves on more than one court during the same period, separate Immigration Judge reports are created for any Court in which the judge rendered at least 100 asylum decisions.\n\nFigure 2: Comparing Denial Rates (percents)\n\nWhy Do Denial Rates Vary Among Judges?\n\nAlthough denial rates are shaped by each Judge's judicial philosophy, denial rates are also shaped by other factors, such as the types of cases on the Judge's docket, the detained status of immigrant respondents, current immigration policies, and other factors beyond an individual Judge's control. For example, TRAC has previously found that legal representation and the nationality of the asylum seeker are just two factors that appear to impact asylum decision outcomes.\n\nThe composition of cases may differ significantly between Immigration Courts in the country. Within a single Court when cases are randomly assigned to judges sitting on that Court, each Judge should have roughly a similar composition of cases given a sufficient number of asylum cases. Then variations in asylum decisions among Judges on the same Immigration Court would appear to reflect, at least in part, the judicial philosophy that the Judge brings to the bench. However, if judges within a Court are assigned to specialized dockets or hearing locations, then case compositions are likely to continue to differ and can contribute to differences in asylum denial rates.\n\nRepresentation\n\nWhen asylum seekers are not represented by an attorney, almost all of them (83%) are denied asylum. In contrast, a significantly higher proportion of represented asylum seekers are successful. In the case of Judge McManus, 1.8% were not represented by an attorney. See Figure 3. For the nation as a whole, about 16.7% of asylum seekers are not represented.\n\nFigure 3: Asylum Seeker Had Representation\n\nNationality\n\nAsylum seekers are a diverse group. Over one hundred different nationalities had at least one hundred individuals claiming asylum decided during this period. As might be expected, immigration courts located in different parts of the country tend to have proportionately larger shares from some countries than from others. And, given the required legal grounds for a successful asylum claim, asylum seekers from some nations tend to be more successful than others.\n\nThe largest group of asylum seekers appearing before Judge McManus came from China. Individuals from this country made up 59.2% of her caseload. Other nationalities in descending order of frequency appearing before Judge McManus were: Former Countries (6.7%), India (4.9%), Nepal (4.2%), Albania (2.8%). See Figure 4.\n\nIn the nation as a whole during this same period, major nationalities of asylum seekers, in descending order of frequency, were El Salvador (18.2%), Guatemala (16.0%), Honduras (14.6%), Mexico (10.5%), China (7.5%), India (4.5%), Cuba (2.5%), Venezuela (2.1%), Ecuador (2.1%), Nicaragua (1.9%), Haiti (1.7%), Cameroon (1.5%), Nepal (1.2%).\n\nFigure 4: Asylum Decisions by Nationality"
