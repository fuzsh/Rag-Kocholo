        "text": "By John O. McManus\n\nFor decades, an array of ‘‘death taxes’’ has become\n\npart of the cost of living and dying in the United\n\nStates. With demands to balance budgets, minimize\n\ndebt, and support public programs, states are exploring\n\nstrategies to create new revenue by expanding\n\nthe footprint of taxation. To foster an increased flow of\n\ncash to their governments, even states with generally\n\nconservative fiscal policies have recently taken steps\n\nthat may indicate a new trend in the taxation of wealth\n\ntransfers, both during their taxpayers’ lifetimes and after\n\ntheir deaths.\n\nConnecticut Takes the Lead\n\nIn 2005, Connecticut was the first state to impose a\n\nstate gift tax on lifetime gifts made to others. In the\n\nyears following the adoption of this statute, the gift tax\n\nexemption (or the amount that a Connecticut resident\n\ncould gift during his or her lifetime without paying gift\n\ntax) gradually increased and rose as high as $3.5 million.\n\nHowever, beginning in 2011, Connecticut’s governor\n\nsigned into law a new budget that dramatically curtailed\n\nthe ability to make tax-free gifts by reducing the\n\nstate’s lifetime gift exemption to $2 million and taxing up to 12 percent on aggregate lifetime gifts exceeding\n\nthat amount.\n\nFurthermore, effective as of July 1, 2013, in addition\n\nto adopting rules subjecting certain non-residents to estate\n\ntaxation, Minnesota passed a law that established\n\nits own state gift tax with a gifting exemption that is\n\nlimited to $1 million.\n\nIt is a significant concern that other cash-strapped\n\nstates may follow the lead of Connecticut and Minnesota.\n\nThose states that do charge an estate or inheritance\n\ntax experience diminishing returns when the\n\nproperty and assets that their residents gift during their\n\nlifetimes are not a part of the estate upon death. Furthermore,\n\nmany politicians view the imposition of a gift\n\ntax as a safer revenue-generating innovation, because\n\nmost of their constituents would be unaffected by such\n\na levy.\n\nMore than ever, these developments highlight the existing\n\nchallenges, including estate tax, inheritance tax,\n\ngeneration-skipping tax, and other traps, in transferring\n\nan estate to loved ones, while also signaling the\n\nalarm that, in the near future, it may become even more\n\ndifficult to make such a transfer in a tax-efficient manner.\n\nNew Gift Tax: Minnesota, a Case Study\n\nEarlier this year, the Minnesota legislature passed a\n\nbill that imposes a 10 percent state gift tax on lifetime\n\ntransfers of wealth exceeding $1 million, the state exclusion\n\namount.\n\nThe tax is applied to the value of all assets transferred\n\nby a Minnesota resident (and, for a non-resident, gifted real property located in Minnesota), and the donor\n\nwould be required to pay the gift tax due. The Minnesota\n\nDepartment of Revenue has yet to release the\n\nMinnesota gift tax form, but timely filing of this document\n\nwill be necessary, together with the gift tax return\n\nat the Federal level (Form 709).\n\nAdditionally, Minnesota has placed further constraints\n\non gifting by rendering all ‘‘deathbed gifts’’\n\nmade within three years prior to the donor’s passing\n\nnull and void. This would have the effect of clawing assets\n\ngifted within that period of time back into the donor’s\n\nestate and subjecting them to estate tax.\n\nFinally, in this new law, the State of Minnesota\n\nmakes an effort to swell its tax base by requiring that\n\nnon-residents owning real property in Minnesota pay\n\nestate tax on the value of such property after they pass\n\naway. This tax even applies to real property owned in\n\na Limited Liability Company or Revocable Living Trust,\n\nwhich would otherwise be common approaches to\n\navoiding this exposure.\n\nNon-residents owning real property\n\nin Minnesota pay estate tax.\n\nRelatively speaking, knowing that Minnesota’s legislature\n\nacted on the heels of Connecticut’s reduction in\n\nits own gift exemption, it is not unreasonable to believe\n\nthat other states may follow suit in the coming months\n\nand years. As such, it will be important to monitor similar\n\ndevelopments in the governments of other states to\n\ndetermine whether the climate will ultimately become\n\nless hospitable for gifting and more confiscatory in\n\nterms of estate taxes. Those who reside in a state with\n\nan estate tax on the books may also benefit from acting\n\nsooner rather than later by making gifts and other\n\nwealth transfers to take advantage of the lack of current\n\nrestrictions and limitations and before any new law is\n\nimplemented.\n\nDeath Taxes: New Jersey, a Case Study\n\nGift tax, state inheritance and estate tax, Federal estate\n\ntax, and generation-skipping tax complete a group\n\ncommonly referred to as ‘‘death taxes.’’ To a lesser extent,\n\nincome tax is also considered when planning for a\n\ntransfer of wealth.\n\nNew Jersey and Maryland are the only two states\n\nthat maintain a dual, sometimes overlapping death tax\n\nfor residents and non-residents at the time of death. In\n\nNew Jersey, estate tax is imposed when gross estate assets\n\nare greater than the exemption amount—currently\n\n$675,000—and assets transfer to ‘‘Class A’’ beneficiaries,\n\nwhich include parents, grandparents, spouses, civil\n\nunion partners, children, step-children, or more remote\n\ndescendants of the deceased. The New Jersey estate\n\ntax, which is paid from estate assets before transfer to\n\nestate beneficiaries, is a graduated tax with a rate as\n\nhigh as 37 percent and as low as 4.8 percent. The rate is highest for the first $50,000 over the exemption amount\n\nand generally averages 10 percent thereafter.\n\nWhen assets having a cumulative value greater than\n\n$25,000 pass to ‘‘Class C’’ beneficiaries, including siblings\n\nand children-in-law, a New Jersey inheritance tax\n\nis imposed. The ceiling plummets to $500 for all others,\n\nknown as ‘‘Class D’’ beneficiaries (for example,\n\nnieces and nephews, cousins, or friends of the deceased\n\nwho receive assets after death). The New Jersey inheritance\n\ntax, which is paid by each beneficiary who\n\nfalls in either of these classes, carries with it a rate that\n\nranges from 11 percent to 16 percent.\n\nThe interplay of these two New Jersey taxing regimes\n\ncan be illustrated by way of example using an estate\n\nwith gross assets of $ 1 million. Assume 90 percent\n\nof the estate ($ 900,000) has been bequeathed to a Class\n\nA beneficiary—decedent’s son, and 10 percent\n\n($100,000) has been bequeathed to the decedent’s\n\nbrother, a Class C beneficiary. The inheritance tax is determined\n\nfirst, and is imposed on the $100,000 bequeathed\n\nto the Class C beneficiary, after subtracting\n\nthe $25,000 exemption amount. The remaining $75,000\n\nis subject to an 11 percent inheritance tax of $8,250,\n\nwhich is paid by the Class C beneficiary.\n\nWith gross assets of the estate equalling $1 million,\n\nestate tax is imposed on that part of the $ 1 million estate\n\nthat exceeds the $675,000 exemption amount. The\n\nexemption amount is in effect taken into account as\n\npart of the allowable unified credit linked to the estate’s\n\nfederal estate tax return. The New Jersey estate tax imposed\n\non the remaining amount computes to $24,950,\n\nafter a dollar-for-dollar credit is given for the inheritance\n\ntax. In this example, the estate tax accounts for\n\n2.5 percent of the entire estate.\n\nFor New Jersey residents, all real property in state,\n\nas well as tangible and intangible assets located in or\n\nout of state, are included in the calculation of taxable\n\nestate assets. Like in Minnesota, non-residents are\n\ntaxed on real property located in New Jersey, but with\n\nthe distinction that if such real property is owned by a\n\nLimited Liability Company prior to death, it is recharacterized\n\nas intangible personal property and tax is\n\navoided.\n\nThe nuance and variation in the taxation structure\n\nalso carries through to permissible exemptions and deductions.\n\nFor example, annuities and life insurance proceeds\n\nwith a designated beneficiary are not taxable for\n\ninheritance tax purposes, but are included in the estate\n\nfor the purpose of calculating estate tax. Funeral expenses,\n\nadministration expenses, and debts of a decedent\n\nmay be used as deductions to reduce both estate\n\nand inheritance tax, but real estate and property maintenance\n\ncosts may not be used as deductions in most instances. It is important to note that New Jersey estate tax is\n\ndue within nine months of the decedent’s date of death\n\nand must be accompanied by a Federal Form 706 Estate\n\nTax Return (unless an alternate New Jersey form is submitted),\n\nwhile inheritance tax is due within eight\n\nmonths of the decedent’s date of death. For each structure\n\nof taxation, a six-month extension to file the return\n\nis available, but there is no extension with respect to the\n\npayment of the tax, and penalties and interest are accrued\n\non any late or underpayment of taxes.\n\nThe decedent’s lifetime gifts also receive different\n\ntreatment for New Jersey estate and inheritance tax\n\npurposes. The full amount of lifetime gifts made within\n\nthree years of death are considered in contemplation of\n\ndeath and are pulled back into gross estate assets for\n\nthe purpose of calculating inheritance tax. Conversely,\n\nall lifetime gifts are included on the estate tax return\n\nsubmitted to New Jersey, no matter when they were\n\nmade and for whatever purpose.\n\nThe complex nature of death taxation in the Garden\n\nState is exemplary of the estate planning difficulties\n\nconfronting taxpayers throughout the New York Metropolitan\n\narea and elsewhere in the United States. New\n\nYork and Connecticut both impose estate taxes, and\n\nthey limit their estate tax exemptions to $1 million and\n\n$2 million, respectively. Pennsylvania requires an inheritance\n\ntax on assets received by any person other\n\nthan a spouse. Unfavorable statutes of this nature in the\n\ntri-state area have very much contributed to the flight of\n\nresidents to the 30 states, such as Florida, that lack a\n\ndeath tax regime.\n\nThe Importance of Domicile\n\nProving domicile in a state to which one has moved\n\nis oftentimes a difficult process in and of itself, particularly\n\nfor those who wish to maintain a foothold in the\n\nstate from which they are transferring their residences.\n\nMeticulous records must be kept to demonstrate that\n\nthe requisite number of days is spent in the new jurisdiction\n\nto claim residency there. This is particularly vital\n\nbecause New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut are\n\nincreasingly auditing the files of ‘‘snowbirds’’ who\n\nchange their residency. The argument is that those\n\npeople really never left by virtue of the fact that they\n\ncontinue to spend a substantial amount of time in their\n\nformer home states. As such, there is a laundry list of\n\nitems that expatriates are advised to complete, such as\n\nchanging their voter registration, driver’s license, and\n\naddress of record to their new state; maintaining landline\n\ntelephone records, receipts, and other statements\n\nthat prove their physical location in their new state; and\n\npurchasing and owning a home, rather than renting, in\n\ntheir new state of domicile.\n\nProbate and estate tax issues linger when taxpayers\n\ncontinue to own property in their previous state of residency.\n\nMoving to a new state will not necessarily completely\n\neradicate estate exposure from the previous\n\nstate if an individual continues to own real property\n\nthere. Additionally, direct ownership of real property in a state other than the state of domicile will necessitate\n\nan ancillary probate proceeding in that jurisdiction.\n\nProbate is one of the initial stages during the administration\n\nof the estate, and going through probate in multiple\n\nstates dramatically increases the time, expense,\n\nand frustration of this process. Typically, the best approach\n\nto remedy these issues is to transfer the real\n\nproperty to a Revocable Living Trust, which avoids probate\n\nproceedings, or a Limited Liability Company,\n\nwhich is treated as intangible personal property and,\n\ntherefore, avoids both probate and estate tax in the\n\nstate where the property is located.\n\nWith respect to other forms of intangible personal\n\nproperty, such as securities or bank accounts, the general\n\nrule established by case law is that these types of\n\nassets follow the person and that—for the purposes of\n\nestate taxation—the domicile of the owner has jurisdiction\n\nvia a provision with a fancy name: ‘‘Mobila sequunter\n\npersonam.’’ That said, it is also well-settled that\n\na state legislature may impose local tax on items of personal\n\nproperty that are significantly distant from that of\n\nthe owner’s permanent residence. In rare cases when a\n\nphysical stock certificate is owned, the physical location\n\nof the document determines the jurisdiction that governs\n\nfor tax purposes. Such securities can be owned by\n\na revocable living trust, and the situs of the trust will be\n\nthe tax regime that rules taxation of the portfolio. The consequences of failing to comprehensively prepare\n\nfor the threat of death taxes underscore the value\n\nof consulting with expert advisors to ensure awareness\n\nof prospective taxation and other post-mortem pitfalls,\n\nand to ensure success in implementing strategies that\n\nwill importantly aid in reducing or eliminating these\n\nproblems.\n\nGeneration-Skipping Transfer (GST) Tax\n\nWhile 20 states and the District of Columbia subject\n\nresidents to estate and inheritance taxes (and while\n\nthere is also a federal estate tax), GST tax at the Federal\n\nlevel is an issue that gets much less attention because\n\nits provisions are considered to be among the\n\nmost complicated in the Internal Revenue Code. GST\n\ntax is generally levied on the value of property received\n\nby descendants more than one generation down the line\n\n(such as grandchildren), which exceed the GST tax exemption\n\n(currently $5.25 million and rising to $5.34 million in 2014). For individuals and families who have undertaken\n\nmaterial estate planning with trusts in the past\n\n(and for those who will do so in the future), this becomes\n\na thorny matter as a result of the automatic allocation\n\nrules that went into effect in 2001 that apply to\n\nany trust that is deemed to be a ‘‘skip trust’’.\n\nFor example, a popular estate planning technique is\n\nan Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust (ILIT) to which a\n\nlife insurance policy is transferred in order to avoid estate\n\ntax on the proceeds of the policy at death. Generally,\n\nthese types of trusts are appealing because no gifting\n\nexemption is used and no filing with the IRS is required.\n\nThe risk, however, is that depending upon the\n\nprovisions of the ILIT, the IRS may classify it as a skip\n\ntrust, which would then create unintended consequences\n\nthat impact other aspects of the estate plan.\n\nAny amounts contributed to the ILIT would automatically\n\nexhaust a portion of the donor’s GST tax exemption\n\nthat the donor may have otherwise wanted to preserve\n\nfor future lifetime or death wealth transfers to\n\ngrandchildren and more remote descendants.\n\nThe result is that the unnecessary GST taxes, which\n\ncould have been minimized or eliminated entirely, may\n\nbe imposed at the time that the grandchildren inherit\n\ntheir share. The best practice, therefore, is to file gift tax\n\nreturns whenever an ILIT or irrevocable trust is funded\n\nin order to clarify whether the automatic allocation\n\nrules apply depending on the structure, provisions, and\n\nlong-term planning goals for the trust.\n\nThe GST tax and the proper deployment of the GST\n\ntax exemption are no longer issues that can be brushed\n\naside or ignored. In 2011 and 2012 following the dramatic\n\nescalation of the federal lifetime gifting exemption,\n\nthe affluent made an unprecedented number of\n\ngifts to irrevocable trusts – tens of thousands of individuals\n\nand married couples made gifts ranging in value\n\nfrom hundreds of thousands of dollars to $10 million,\n\nwith the expectation that such trusts would carry forward\n\nthrough several generations. This significant issue\n\nis not only relevant to gifts made into trusts in the past\n\ntwo years, but it also warrants further examination of\n\nany trust established after 2001 to best ensure that the\n\nwealth transfer plan operates as intended.\n\nStay State Informed\n\nChoosing where to live is about more than good food\n\nand the weather. It can have a huge impact on the\n\nmoney on hand today and the amount of wealth that\n\ncan be transferred to heirs tomorrow. Different states\n\nhave significantly different tax regimes, so moving\n\nacross the country or just across the state line could\n\nalso mean that one’s estate planning approach needs to\n\nbe revised. All in all, the best strategy for preserving the\n\ngreatest amount of assets is to stay informed."
