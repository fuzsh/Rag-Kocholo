        "text": "Night Falls On The City\n\nBy Sarah Gainham,\n\nFrom my list on love, loss, and logic in 1930s Vienna.\n\nBy Kirsten Menger-Anderson Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI first learned about life in 1930s Vienna from my grandfather’s memoir: Reminiscences of the Vienna Circle and the Mathematical Colloquium. I was fascinated by the time and place and began to read more about the era, which ultimately served as a setting for my forthcoming novel, The Expert of Subtle Revisions.\n\nKirsten's book list on love, loss, and logic in 1930s Vienna\n\nWhy did Kirsten love this book?\n\nSpanning seven years in six hundred pages, Gainham’s Night Falls On The City is a richly detailed depiction of the stress and madness of life in Vienna after the German annexation.\n\nOnstage or off, the novel’s protagonist, Julia Homburg, must always act, and the strain of this performance, under escalating violence and increasingly difficult circumstances, takes a harsh toll. A compelling and memorable story.\n\nBy Sarah Gainham,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Night Falls On The City as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nVienna, 1938. Beautiful actress Julia Homburg and her politician husband Franz Wedeker embody all the enlightened brilliance of their native city. But Wedeker is Jewish, and just across the border the tanks of the Nazi Reich are primed for the Anschluss.\n\nWhen the SS invades and disappearances become routine, Franz must be concealed. With daring ingenuity, Julia conjures a hiding place. In the shadow of oppression, a clear conscience is a luxury few can afford, and Julia finds she must strike a series of hateful bargains with the new order if she and her husband are to survive.\n\nA highly…\n\nPreview\n\nAll Hell Let Loose\n\nBy Max Hastings,\n\nFrom my list on Great WW2 books published after 2000.\n\nBy Glyn Harper Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nGlyn Harper has been researching and writing military history for over forty years. He is the author of numerous best-selling books on military history and is also an award-winning author of books for children and young adults. A former army officer, Glyn is New Zealand’s only Professor of War Studies.\n\nGlyn's book list on Great WW2 books published after 2000\n\nWhy did Glyn love this book?\n\nMax Hastings is the author of more than thirty books, many of them about the Second World War. All Hell Let Loose describes the Second World War in considerable detail but focuses on the human experience of what it was like to be a participant in this critical period of history. For its breadth, its power of expression, and penetrating analysis, this book is unsurpassed. There are many excellent single-volume studies of the Second World War, but I rate this as one of the very best.\n\nBy Max Hastings,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked All Hell Let Loose as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nA magisterial history of the greatest and most terrible event in history, from one of the finest historians of the Second World War. A book which shows the impact of war upon hundreds of millions of people around the world- soldiers, sailors and airmen; housewives, farm workers and children.\n\nReflecting Max Hastings's thirty-five years of research on World War II, All Hell Let Loose describes the course of events, but focuses chiefly upon human experience, which varied immensely from campaign to campaign, continent to continent.\n\nThe author emphasises the Russian front, where more than 90% of all German soldiers who…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Red Army and the Second World War\n\nBy Alexander Hill,\n\nFrom my list on WW2 in Europe.\n\nBy Jeremy Black Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nJeremy Black is a prolific lecturer and writer, the author of over 100 books. Many concern aspects of eighteenth-century British, European, and American political, diplomatic and military history but he has also published on the history of the press, cartography, warfare, culture, and on the nature and uses of history itself.\n\nJeremy's book list on WW2 in Europe\n\nWhy did Jeremy love this book?\n\nThe Eastern Front has not always attracted the most readable scholarship, while two of the major works by British writers are by those who cannot read Russian. Hill is a welcome relief. His scholarship is impeccable and his book is readable. An important contribution.\n\nBy Alexander Hill,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Red Army and the Second World War as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIn a definitive new account of the Soviet Union at war, Alexander Hill charts the development, successes and failures of the Red Army from the industrialisation of the Soviet Union in the late 1920s through to the end of the Great Patriotic War in May 1945. Setting military strategy and operations within a broader context that includes national mobilisation on a staggering scale, the book presents a comprehensive account of the origins and course of the war from the perspective of this key Allied power. Drawing on the latest archival research and a wealth of eyewitness testimony, Hill portrays the…\n\nPreview\n\nWhy Stalin's Soldiers Fought\n\nBy Roger R. Reese,\n\nFrom my list on the Soviet Union in World War II.\n\nBy Wendy Z. Goldman Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI am a professor of Russian history at Carnegie Mellon University.I have visited Russia many times and spent years working in Russian archives. I am keenly aware of the impact World War II and the Nazis had on the country: a loss of 26-7 million people, wide-scale suffering, mass murder of civilians, and destruction of cities, towns, and villages. The majority of German divisions were concentrated on the eastern front, and it was here the Red Army broke the back of the Wehrmacht. Yet because of divisions created by the Cold War, Americans are taught little about the central role the Soviet Union played in this victory. As a historian, I am strongly committed to bringing the full story of the war to light.\n\nWendy's book list on the Soviet Union in World War II\n\nWhy did Wendy love this book?\n\nWhy are soldiers willing to fight and die, often despite horrific odds, for a cause? And why do whole armies fall apart under less difficult conditions? The Red Army, which lost millions of men and suffered massive encirclements by the Wehrmacht provides the perfect case study of these questions. After months of retreat, the Red Army turned the tide at Stalingrad and drove the Nazis back to Berlin.\n\nReese’s careful research and balanced conclusions note that morale and motivation fluctuated depending on soldiers’ nationality, social group, and personal circumstances. Many were deeply motivated by Soviet patriotism, which was sometimes, but not always coincident, with socialist ideals and support for Stalin. The army quickly proved that despite catastrophic losses of people and equipment, it could regroup and deliver victory. Its successes were tied in no small measure to the efforts the Soviet state poured into creating strong morale and motivation. Credit,…\n\nBy Roger R. Reese,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Why Stalin's Soldiers Fought as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nInept leadership, inefficient campaigning, and enormous losses would seem to spell military disaster. Yet despite these factors, the Soviet Union won its war against Nazi Germany thanks to what Roger Reese calls its \"military effectiveness\": its ability to put troops in the field even after previous forces had been decimated. Reese probes the human dimension of the Red Army in World War II through a close analysis of soldiers' experiences and attitudes concerning mobilization, motivation, and morale. In doing so, he illuminates the Soviets' remarkable ability to recruit and retain soldiers, revealing why so many were willing to fight in…\n\nPreview\n\nArdennes 1944\n\nBy Antony Beevor,\n\nFrom my list on understanding the Battle of the Bulge.\n\nBy John C. McManus Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nJohn C. McManus, Ph.D., is Curators’ Distinguished Professor of U.S. Military History at Missouri University of Science and Technology, and a recipient of the prestigious Gilder Lehrman Prize for Military History. He is the author of 14 books, including Alamo in the Ardennes: The Untold Story of the American Soldiers who Made the Defense of Bastogne Possible.\n\nJohn's book list on understanding the Battle of the Bulge\n\nWhy did John love this book?\n\nWhat happens when an author with a remarkable knack for insightful research and a gift for brilliant narrative prose takes on the task of telling a story of such epochal importance? A wonderful book that conveys the desperation of the moment and weaves this together with latter-year perspective. Among Beevor’s many insights, my favorite is his assertion that “the German leadership’s greatest mistake in the Ardennes offensive was to have misjudged the soldiers of an army they had affected to despise.” So very true! The Germans badly underestimated the U.S. Army and they paid the price for their dismissive chauvinism.\n\nBy Antony Beevor,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Ardennes 1944 as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe prizewinning historian and bestselling author of D-Day, Stalingrad, and The Battle of Arnhem reconstructs the Battle of the Bulge in this riveting new account\n\nOn December 16, 1944, Hitler launched his 'last gamble' in the snow-covered forests and gorges of the Ardennes in Belgium, believing he could split the Allies by driving all the way to Antwerp and forcing the Canadians and the British out of the war. Although his generals were doubtful of success, younger officers and NCOs were desperate to believe that their homes and families could be saved from the vengeful Red Army approaching from the…\n\nPreview\n\nWhen Titans Clashed\n\nBy David M. Glantz, Jonathan M. House,\n\nFrom my list on WWII theater: the Nazi-Soviet War.\n\nBy Robert Kirchubel Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI have been interested in the Nazi-Soviet War since my high school years, and I am happy to say my views have become more sophisticated in the intervening 50 years! During the Cold War I served as a US Army Armor officer for 28 years and globally across 18 time zones (retired lieutenant colonel). Thereafter, I earned a PhD in modern European history, specializing in the 20th-century German military, from Purdue University. I have researched, taught, and written extensively on all aspects of military history, particularly WWII. My latest book, an operational level [of war] history of Barbarossa for the Campaigns and Commanders series (University of Oklahoma Press, in preparation as of mid-2024).\n\nRobert's book list on WWII theater: the Nazi-Soviet War\n\nWhy did Robert love this book?\n\nI give retired US Army Colonel Glantz pride of place here because of his leading role in correcting the history of this conflict. Cold War politics made the Germans ironic but underserving heroes.\n\nGlantz sets the story straight and shows how and why the Soviet Union and Red Army earned the title of victors. This book is very readable and covers the entire four-year war in surprising detail. I consider it a great introduction to his massive body of work.\n\nBy David M. Glantz, Jonathan M. House,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked When Titans Clashed as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nOn first publication, this uncommonly concise and readable account of Soviet Russia's clash with Nazi Germany utterly changed our understanding of World War II on Germany's Eastern Front, immediately earning its place among top-shelf histories of the world war. Revised and updated to reflect recent Russian and Western scholarship on the subject, much of it the authors' own work, this new edition maintains the 1995 original's distinction as a crucial volume in the history of World War II and of the Soviet Union and the most informed and compelling perspective on one of the greatest military confrontations of all time.…\n\nPreview\n\nStalingrad\n\nBy Antony Beevor,\n\nWhy did Cathal love this book?\n\nBeevor has a rare gift of presenting war at the level of both the ordinary soldier and the generals and distant leadership making decisions both good and bad. His sources range from letters home, to diaries, to dispatches on both the Soviet and German side. He writes without flinching about the horrors of war, or too overtly playing the cheerleader as so many military histories do, to their detriment.\n\nBy Antony Beevor,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n4 authors picked Stalingrad as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThis authoritative and well written book recreates the battle for Stalingrad that became the focus of Hitler and Stalin's determination to win the gruesome and vicious war for the Eastern front. A detailed examination of the most pitiless, and perhaps the most important battle in WW2 history. Focusing on the experiences of soldiers on both sides, driven beyond the limits of physical and mental endurance this work stands as a testament to human endeavour and to the vital role of the Soviet wareffort. This will be the classic book on the subject,\n\nPreview\n\nIvan's War\n\nBy Catherine Merridale,\n\nWhy did Harold love this book?\n\nMerridale uses archival material and interviews with Soviet war veterans to personalize the war on the Eastern Front. This work moves beyond the number of combatants and tanks to focus on real life at the frontlines. She talks about issues that help the reader “feel” the war: what did soldiers eat given the well-known shortages and privations throughout the USSR; how did soldiers get warm clothes and boots; how did they obtain ammunition and artillery shells and new guns despite the long supply lines; was stealing accepted in the army; what behaviors were tolerated and which ones were punished; how did hierarchy allow officers to get first choice of captured enemy equipment. She reveals how officers might not report all the dead in their unit so they would not lose the lost soldier’s food ration. While Alexander Werth’s Russia at War provides a sweeping view of Soviet organization, suffering, and…\n\nBy Catherine Merridale,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Ivan's War as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nA powerful, groundbreaking narrative of the ordinary Russian soldier's experience of the worst war in history, based on newly revealed sources.\n\nOf the thirty million who fought in the eastern front of World War II, eight million died, driven forward in suicidal charges, shattered by German shells and tanks. They were the men and women of the Red Army, a ragtag mass of soldiers who confronted Europe's most lethal fighting force and by 1945 had defeated it. Sixty years have passed since their epic triumph, but the heart and mind of Ivan -- as the ordinary Russian soldier was called…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Fall of Berlin 1945\n\nBy Antony Beevor,\n\nFrom my list on WW2 books I used as research for my horror novel.\n\nBy Andrew C. Piazza Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nAndrew is a long-time WWII history buff and writer who looks for any excuse to do a deep dive into his favorite history topics. For his WWII horror novel One Last Gasp, he spent over a year researching the Battle of the Bulge, from first-hand accounts of front-line soldiers to official U.S. Army documents.\n\nAndrew's book list on WW2 books I used as research for my horror novel\n\nWhy did Andrew love this book?\n\nA bit dry and occasionally over-focused on rattling off official numbers and unit designations, The Fall Of Berlin is also a low-key horror novel. Surrounded on all sides by a massive Russian army hell-bent on revenge, the people of Berlin are caught between those invaders and their own leadership forcing them into a suicidal last stand. The scale of brutality is numbing; this is a battle fought without mercy by two adversaries locked in a death struggle.\n\nBy Antony Beevor,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked The Fall of Berlin 1945 as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n\"A tale drenched in drama and blood, heroism and cowardice, loyalty and betrayal.\"-Jonathan Yardley, The Washington Post\n\nThe Red Army had much to avenge when it finally reached the frontiers of the Third Reich in January 1945. Frenzied by their terrible experiences with Wehrmacht and SS brutality, they wreaked havoc-tanks crushing refugee columns, mass rape, pillage, and unimaginable destruction. Hundreds of thousands of women and children froze to death or were massacred; more than seven million fled westward from the fury of the Red Army. It was the most terrifying example of fire and sword ever known.\n\nAntony Beevor, renowned…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Forgotten Soldier\n\nBy Guy Sajer,\n\nWhy did George love this book?\n\nWhen I was researching my grandfather’s actions fighting for Czechoslovakia in World War Two, for my own book, including his time of the front line in France in 1940, I grew tired of academic history books and sought out a firsthand account of the realities of combat. Guy Sajer’s story of his experiences as a German soldier on the Eastern Front provided exactly what I was looking for: As I read it, I could feel the mud caked on my fingers, the shrapnel wound stinging my arm, and the trench foot creeping up my leg. The fact that Sajer was fighting, somewhat unwillingly, with the Nazis gives a whole extra layer of interest too.\n\nBy Guy Sajer,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Forgotten Soldier as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nAn international bestseller, this is a German soldier's first-hand account of life on Russian front during the second half of the Second World War.\n\nWhen Guy Sajer joins the infantry full of ideals in the summer of 1942, the German army is enjoying unparalleled success in Russia. However, he quickly finds that for the foot soldier the glory of military success hides a much harsher reality of hunger, fatigue and constant deprivation. Posted to the crack Grosse Deutschland division, with its sadistic instructors who shoot down those who fail to make the grade, he enters a violent and remorseless world…\n\nPreview"
