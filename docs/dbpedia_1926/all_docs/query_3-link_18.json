        "text": "I am always asked about my favourite books about D-Day, and the fact is with over 1000 books in my library, it is very hard to select a few favorites. However here are some that I especially like.\n\nGeneral books on D-Day\n\nHere are some very good books that cover the landings on June 6th and in some cases the first few days. In my opinion they are balanced and cover all the participant Nations' roles well.\n\nNormandy '44 and the Battle for France by James Holland\n\nSand and Steel: A New History of D-Day by Peter Caddick-Adams\n\nOverlord by Sir Max Hastings\n\nSix Armies in Normandy by John Keegan\n\nDouble Cross: The True Story of the D-Day Spies by Ben MacIntyre\n\nD-Day. Piercing the Atlantic Wall by Robert Kershaw\n\nThe Americans on D-Day and in the Battle of Normandy\n\nThe three books by my friend Joe Balkoski are meticulously researched and his Omaha book is exceptionally good. Marty Morgan's photographic book is also superb.\n\nThe British in Normandy\n\nThere are less books solely about the British in Normandy, but John Buckley's book is a great new and unbiased account.\n\nMonty's Men: The British Army and the Liberation of Europe by John Buckley\n\nD-Day Documents by Paul Winter\n\nThe Canadians in the Battle of Normandy\n\nMy friend Mark Zuehlke's books are unrivaled in terms of accuracy and readability, but anything by Terry Copp is also worth reading.\n\nThe Juno Beach Trilogy by Mark Zuehlke\n\nFields of Fire by Terry Copp\n\nCinderella Army: The Canadians in Northwest Europe, 1944-1945 by Terry Copp\n\nA Rising of Courage: Canada's paratroops in the liberation of Normandy by Dan Hartigan\n\nBritish Airborne Troops on D-Day\n\n​Neil Barber's books are superb, so too are Carl Shilleto's and both these historians are friends of mine.\n\nThe Pegasus and Orne Bridges: Their Capture, Defence and Relief on D-Day by Neil Barber\n\nDay the Devils Dropped In by Neil Barber\n\nPegasus Bridge and Merville Battery by Carl Shilleto\n\n13 - Lucky For Some: The History of the 13th (Lancashire) Parachute Battalion by Andrew Woolhouse\n\nAmerican Rangers and Specialist Troops\n\nPatrick O'Donnell is another friend and I helped a little bit with his Dog Company book, I also like Joanna McDonald's book on Pointe du Hoc.\n\nDog Company: The Boys of Pointe du Hoc--the Rangers Who Accomplished D-Day's Toughest Mission and Led the Way across Europe by Patrick K. O'Donnell\n\nLiberation of Pointe Du Hoc by Joanna McDonald\n\nSpearheading DDay - American Special Units in Normandy by Jonathan Gawne\n\n82nd Airborne\n\nThe books by Phil Nordyke are packed with information and Robert Murphy's book remains a classic.\n\nOn to Berlin by James M Gavin\n\nTo DDay and Back by Bob Bearden\n\nAll American All The Way by Phil Nordyke\n\nFour Stars of Valor by Phil Nordyke\n\nNo Better Place to die by Robert Murphy\n\nDown to Earth by Martin K A Morgan\n\n101st Airborne\n\nWe are spoiled for choice these days with books about the Screaming Eagles in the post Band of Brothers era. Here are a selection of great works.\n\nVanguard of the Crusade by Mark Bando\n\nScreaming Eagles at Normandy by Mark Bando\n\nDDay With the Screaming Eagles by George Koskimaki\n\nTonight We Die As Men by Ian Gardner and Roger Day\n\nEasy Company Soldier by Donald Malarkey\n\nFighting Fox Company by Terry Poyser\n\nWe Who Are Alive and Remain by Marcus Brotherton\n\nA Company of Heroes: Personal Memories about the Real Band of Brothers by Marcus Brotherton\n\nIn The Footsteps of the Band of Brothers by Larry Alexander\n\nCurrahee - A Screaming Eagle in Normandy by Donald R Burgett\n\nBooks by friends (Not all Normandy and WWII)\n\nThis section of books are all penned by friends of mine. They are all enjoyable reads and come with my recommendation but cover a variety of subjects.\n\nHitler's Death: The Case Against Conspiracy by Luke Daly Groves\n\nAppeasement: Chamberlain, Hitler, Churchill, and the Road to War by Tim Bouverie\n\nA History of the English-Speaking Peoples Since 1900 by Andrew Roberts\n\nWalking DDay by Paul Reed\n\nDDay Survivor by Harold Baumgarten\n\nSomme 1916: Success and Failure on the First Day of the Battle of the Somme by Paul Kendall\n\nPatton's Photographs by Kevin M Hymel\n\nAnimals in the First World War by Neil R Storey\n\nGame to the Last the 11th Australian Infantry Battalion at Gallipoli by James Hurst\n\nWe Got Each Other Home - The Most Decorated Coastguard LST of WWII by Andrew Zimmerman\n\nContact me if you have other suggestions for this list​"
