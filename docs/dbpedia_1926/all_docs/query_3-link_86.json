        "text": "History “represents the underlying stratum of consciousness out of which news judgments are made. More generally, the study of history and the humanistic social sciences promote knowledge of the world. They provide a textured backdrop to a journalistic reading of the world.”\n\n—G. Stuart Adam, The Routledge Companion to News and Journalism\n\n“The study of history . . . provides information important for identity and background. It helps us to know ourselves both individually and collectively, and it provides knowledge valuable in helping us to understand people and the world around us. Although we may assume that particular events that occurred in the past will never recur in exactly the same way, we also know that an understanding of them will help us to deal with similar events in the future. Whether we are considering wars or social movements or any other major topic, we can be certain that a knowledge of them and the answers to the questions they raise serve a purpose of anyone who hopes to be an informed and responsible person today . . . a knowledge of history provides a broader perspective than one gets from simply studying the tools of the trade.”\n\n— W. David Sloan, “Why Study History?” in American Journalism\n\n“The purpose of history is to assess the past so that we may more effectively construct the present and future, just as the journalist must capture the news to help inform and sometimes direct daily decisions. Historical research is about resorting life and providing context.”\n\n— D.G. Godfrey, “Editor’s Note,” Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media\n\nHistorians “seek to capture the thought and feeling of a time past as they are associated with a particular problem under investigation. Historical study would need no further justification than that. One might as well be obligated to justify humankind’s interest in art or its continuing search for knowledge. If there is value in studying the past, then that fact, furthermore, automatically justifies historical research methods, for they provide the only way of recapturing, as it were, the past as it actually occurred.”\n\n— W. David Sloan, “Why Study History?” in American Journalism\n\n“We hear often about an historian acting as a kind of detective, and while that analogy fits, it would be more appropriate to see the historian as an investigative journalist looking at the past.”\n\n— D.G. Godfrey, “Editor’s Note,” Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media\n\n“Historical study provides the opportunity to inform later generations about the nature of humankind and behavior; it contributes to the authentic record of human experience. The primary goal of historians, therefore, is to explain particular things of the past fully and truthfully.”\n\n— W. David Sloan, “Why Study History?” in American Journalism\n\n“Historians, like journalists, must remain faithful to the factual records. While movie, television directors, and novelists may take dramatic license, such flights of fancy are forbidden to historians and reporters. . . . Historic truths, like journalistic facts, must be derived from all available evidence. Evidence—solid evidence—is that which establishes the existence, or nonexistence, of a fact. This is the result of searching, detective work, indeed the whole discovery process. Put another way, writing good history involves the gathering of primary materials, the organization of puzzle pieces, and the building of the case. . . . The study of history offers pragmatic value as it increases a scholar’s and the journalist’s ability to undertake good writing, problem solving, communication, and reasoning. . . . The search for the discovery of truth is similar, and the rules of evidence and tests of authenticity are parallel.”\n\n— D.G. Godfrey, “Editor’s Note,” Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media\n\n“Barriers that have traditionally existed between journalism and history are likely to be much more porous in these challenging times. The political and cultural attacks on journalism and history are driven by similar ideologies and we ought to fight against them together rather than let ourselves be divided. The rough relationship between those who write the first draft of history and those who edit that draft for posterity has been strained, but we cannot let it break. We all believe that studying history is important. We have dedicated our lives to it. If we want our research to continue to have an impact on future generations, incorporating media in the ways that research is published and shared will be essential.”\n\n—Jason Lee Guthrie, “Revising the First Rough Draft: On Journalism, History, and Journalism History,” in American Journalism\n\n“The research method of historiography requires skills similar to an experienced journalistic producer in gathering, organizing, and verifying facts, along with the vital evaluation of different kinds of evidence. Even their uses by historians and journalists are often similar. The journalist-producer must dissect written, oral, and visual records; analyze physical evidence; and make sense of these as a factual story. . . . The challenge of the historian is very much analogous to the seasoned in-depth reporter. . . . More importantly for the journalist-producer-historian, studying history helps to increase communication abilities, facilitate problem-solving skills, and improve skills of reasoning, deduction, organizing, and analyzing evidence that are all required to defend any position. . . . Why teach historical research methods? Because effective use of such methods can enhance the development of better journalistic skills. . . . If we look at the historiographic and journalistic parallels in the research process, we may well question whether there is a difference. After all in both situations one must:\n\nIdentify and focus the general topic of interest.\n\nStudy the literature, information, and the context of the time period.\n\nExamine and compare what has been written.\n\nLook for primary unfiltered sources.\n\nSuggest a framework that can add to new knowledge.\n\nUncover the primary evidence that portrays a story and then analyze the evidence.\n\nWeigh evidence against various tests of authenticity.\n\nExamine and triangulate collaborative, contradictory, and physical evidence.\n\nPeel back the layers of the creative process to assure that the primary evidence is valid.\n\nPay particular attention to visual and oral evidence, what it communicates, and the needs for verification and/or support.\n\nProvide supportive evidence wherever media sources are called into question by the skeptics of media as evidence.\n\nSuggest a theoretical approach where the work goes beyond traditional patterns, chronology, or the Five Ws (who, what, when, where, and why) being sure that the theoretical approach chosen is appropriate to the object of analysis and the questions at hand.\n\nOrganize the analyzed evidence to support the narrative facts; and,\n\nWrite and rewrite.\n\nResearchers in each discipline must understand the topic, immerse themselves in primary factual information, assess that evidence, and recreate a new picture that extends our understanding of the world around us. So, we must prioritize the teaching of both history and historiography as well as behavioral science. Both are essential in acquiring new knowledge, but history has a particularly valuable parallel to journalism and journalistic training. To ignore, overlook, or relegate it to a part of another course is to auction our journalistic skills set, our understanding, not just of the past, but of the future.”\n\n—D.G. Godfrey, “Editor’s Note,” Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media\n\n“. . . the historian [as well as the journalist] must place in context the information they have collected and do this by addressing questions related to causation, generalization, interpretation, and the establishing of significance.\n\n—W. D. Sloan and J.D. Startt, The Media in America: A History\n\n“Sonia majored in history at a liberal arts college in the Northeast and later pursued a master’s degree in Latin American studies. She believes that a history major is the best foundation for a career in journalism. Her studies in history helped her to do research, taught her where to look for needed documents, and made her a better writer. She adds, ‘More important, however, [my history major] taught me to think critically. Because when you look at events in history, by looking at how those situations were resolved you can understand a lot about what is going to happen in the future. The past is prologue.’ Sonia believes that employers are always looking for people who can do research, think critically, place current events in historical context, and write clearly. She concludes that she ‘cannot think of a better major that gives you all that.’”\n\n—John Fea, Why Study History?\n\n“Amy is a passionate student of the past who directs the honors program at a small liberal arts college in New York, but every two years she works as the supervisor of the research room for NBC’s coverage of the Olympic Games. . . . As a historian, Amy knows how to turn small details into a compelling story for NBC viewers. As she puts it, ‘The ability to think, write, speak, communicate, innovate, and create: that is history well done.’”\n\n—John Fea, Why Study History?\n\n“Chris Berman at ESPN says simply, . . . ‘You don’t have to major in communications or journalism. I’m not saying that’s bad. . . . I majored in history. . . . . Maybe somebody would be intrigued with a person who majored in history. But once you have that first job, it’s what you do on the air—the communications major doesn’t get you the second job. Then it becomes my tape vs. your tape.’”\n\n—Tom Hedrick, The Art of Sportscasting: How to Build a Successful Career\n\nPenny Abernathy, Knight Chair in Journalism at the University of North Carolina\n\nJill Abramson, former executive editor (and first female), New York Times\n\nLen Ackland, founding director of the Center for Environmental Journalism\n\nYa’akov Ahimeir, Israeli TV and radio personality\n\nTom Allon, publisher and former co-owner, City & State NY, Manhattan Media\n\nEric Alterman, media critic; contributor, The Nation, Washington Monthly, New Republic\n\nMarc Ambinder, former politics editor, The Atlantic; correspondent, National Journal\n\nMichal Ansky, food writer\n\nBinyamin Appelbaum, business and economics representative, New York Times editorial board\n\nAnne Applebaum, staff writer, The Atlantic\n\nRamtin Arablouei, podcast host, NPR’s Throughline\n\nAllison Arieff, Editorial Director of Print, MIT Technology Review\n\nDavid Axe, military correspondent, blogger, War Is Boring\n\nJohn U.
