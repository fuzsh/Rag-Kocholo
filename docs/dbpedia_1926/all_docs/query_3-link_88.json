        "text": "The oral history program in the FDA History Office, which began in the mid-1970s, captures the memories of selected agency employees typically toward the end of their careers in Food and Drug. Though the programâ€™s early focus was on agency staff directly connected to enforcement work, the History Office today collects oral histories from staff at all levels and across the agency. As a convenience to researchers, the below table contains oral history transcripts in PDF format. You can sort the table using the arrows at the top of each column and can find particular interviews by inputting keywords in the search field."
