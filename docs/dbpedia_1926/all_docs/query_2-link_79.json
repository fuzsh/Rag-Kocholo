        "text": "From the liberation of the Philippines to the Japanese surrender, the final volume of John C. McManus's trilogy on the US Army in the Pacific WarWinner of the Army Historical Foundation Award for Excellence in U.S. Army WritingFrom the liberation of the Philippines to the Japanese surrender, the final volume of John C. McManus's trilogy on the US Army in the Pacific War\"Brilliant and riveting... a truly great book.\"-Gen. David Petraeus . \"Triumphant and compelling.\"-Richard Frank . \"McManus is one of the best-if not the best-World War II historians working today.\"-World War II magazineThe dawn of 1945 finds a US Army at its peak in the Pacific. Allied victory over Japan is all but assured. The only question is how many more months-or years-of fight does the enemy have left.John C. McManus,winner of the Gilder Lehrman Prize for Military History, concludes hismagisterial series, described by the Wall Street Journal as being \"as vast and splendid as Rick Atkinson's Pulitzer Prize-winning Liberation Trilogy,\" with this brilliant final volume.On the island of Luzon, a months-long stand-off between US and Japanese troops finally breaks open, as American soldiers push into Manila, while paratroopers and amphibious invaders capture nearby Corregidor. The Philippines are soon liberated, and Allied strategists turn their eyes to China, Iwo Jima, Okinawa, and the Japanese home islands themselves. Readers will walk in the boots of American soldiers and officers, braving intense heat, rampant disease, and a by-now suicidal enemy, determined to kill as many opponents as possible before defeat, and they will encounter Japanese soldiers faced with the terrible choice between capitulation or doom. At the same time, this outstanding narrative lays bare the titanic ego and ambition of the Pacific War's most prominent general, Douglas MacArthur, and the complex challenges he faced in Japan's unconditional surrender and America's lengthy occupation.\n\n“To the End of the Earth is, like the campaign it describes, a solid mix of strategic insight, tactical analysis and ground-level fighting in which the American soldier’s deprivation and self-sacrifice claim their due credit. In the final installment of his trilogy, Mr. McManus renders an eloquent salute to soldiers who fought their way across two island chains to reach Japan’s doorstep and set the stage for the war’s end.”—The Wall Street Journal\n\n“McManus is one of the best--if not the best--World War II historians working today.”—WWII Magazine\n\n“A brilliant, riveting final volume in John McManus’s extraordinary trilogy on the war in the Pacific. To the End of the Earth paints vivid portraits of generals and foot soldiers alike and provides a wealth of important new detail on the campaign to liberate the Philippines and the other ‘stepping-stone’ battles that brought about Japan’s defeat. It also solidifies John McManus’ reputation as one of the great historians of our times. This is a truly great book!”—General David Petraeus, US Army (Ret.), former Commander of the Surge in Iraq, US Central Command, and Coalition Forces in Afghanistan and former Director of the CIA\n\n“In this triumphant, compelling conclusion of his trilogy on the US Army in the Pacific in World War II, John McManus wins new laurels. This sweeping narrative ranges from finely crafted depictions of generals and admirals, gritty glimpses into the sharp end of combat, the physically and mentally wounded, logistics, race, and everything else. If you are at any level a practitioner of military history, I would urge you to read this as a pole star for excellence in the craft.”—Richard Frank, author of Tower of Skulls: A History of the Asia-Pacific War: July 1937-May 1942\n\n“An invaluable contribution to our understanding of the Army’s role in the Pacific War. McManus’s narrative style, and his ability to interweave first-person accounts with his chronology of events, is something to behold.”—Military Review\n\n“McManus masterfully integrates a wide array of primary sources and weaves together accounts from generals to those fighting in the mud.”—Library Journal, starred review\n\n“Wide-ranging yet granular, it’s a fitting capstone to the series.”—Publishers Weekly"
