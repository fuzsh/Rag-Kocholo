        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\n1825 HOURS, DECEMBER 17, 1944 THE CLARAVALLIS HOTEL CLERVAUX, LUXEMBOURG\n\nColonel Hurley Fuller was angry, scared, and exhausted. The past thirty-six hours had been the most horrendous and stressful of his life, and he had been through plenty of bad situations. Long ago, back in his native Texas, his parents had separated. Young Hurley had attended the University of Texas but never finished his degree, opting instead to join the army in 1916 at the age of twenty. Two years later, as a freshly minted lieutenant with the 9th Infantry Division, he endured the horrors of trench warfare in the Argonne Forest. The memories of what he had seen there never left him. The Argonne was a wasteland of shattered trees and shattered men, seemingly nothing there but gray-green corpses, their skin soaked to putrefaction by the steady, cold rains. Combat in the Argonne had been very disillusioning to a young officer like Hurley. Nonetheless, he stayed in the army during the interwar period.\n\nHis career was steady, if rather unspectacular. He had earned a reputation as being irascible but competent. The most common adjective used to describe him was cantankerous. He had no West Point pedigree, no brilliant war record, and absolutely no political skills. He had a tendency to talk back to superiors. He was not the type of officer to attract the attention of General George Marshall’s notebook, the one he used to record the names of officers who impressed him. That book was too crowded with such names as Eisenhower, Bradley, Patton, and Collins to include someone like Fuller. In this second world war, Fuller had seen many of his peers receive general’s stars while he was slotted for field-grade assignments.\n\nHis worst moment came in Normandy, when he was in command of the 23rd Infantry Regiment of the 2nd Infantry Division. In June, his regiment was in the middle of a maze of hedgerows, several miles north of Saint-Lô, pushing for that town but getting nowhere. Fuller was not much of a tactical innovator. He was so enamored of the World War I-era bolt-action Springfield rifle, that he arranged for his entire regiment to be armed with them, thus ensuring that his riflemen would have little personal firepower.\n\nAs in 1918, Fuller witnessed the product of bloody stalemate there in the hedgerows. He was losing hundreds of men to gain half a mile. Day after day, the wounded streamed back, on foot or on litters, to the aid stations. It was all so hellish, so hopeless, such a nightmare. Actually, it was all so reminiscent of 1918, except for one thing: this time Fuller was in a position of senior command. He was responsible for more than just a platoon or a company. He was in command of three thousand soldiers, and they were all, seemingly, getting killed, getting wounded, or losing their minds to psychoneurosis. Try as he might, Fuller could not figure a way to break that stalemate in Normandy. Even in the best of times, Fuller was not much of a talker, nor was he very inspirational. He tended to retreat behind a gruff exterior and keep his men at a distance. This tendency only deepened during the horrible days in Normandy. He withdrew behind his hard shell, his ever-present pipe firmly in his mouth as he pored over maps, looking for a solution.\n\nThen came the most painful memory of all. One day, at the division command post (CP), Fuller’s two immediate superiors, General Walter Robertson, the division commander, and General Leonard Gee Gerow, the corps commander, fired him on the spot. It had been yet another unproductive, bloody day in the bocage. Fuller’s battalions were in disarray. Everything was a mess, and he was not sure what to do about it.\n\nAt the division CP, General Gerow was mad as a hornet, and he decided to make an example of Fuller. He pounded on a map board and demanded an explanation from Fuller as to why his forces had scattered in the face of the enemy. Gerow stretched to his full height, well over six feet tall, and towered over Fuller, who stood no more than five feet, five inches. At that moment, Fuller froze. Try as he might, he did not know what to say. Gerow fired question after question at him. Even when the general shouted, Goddamn it, Colonel, I’m talking to you! Now, you answer me! Fuller could not bring himself to speak. With that, Gerow and Robertson relieved him. Stunned and bewildered, Fuller felt involuntary tears roll down his cheeks as a young captain led him away.\n\nHe spent the next few months in limbo, hanging around General Omar Bradley’s headquarters, enduring the humiliation of his relief, hoping for another command. Finally, in November he got his break. His old friend Major General Troy Middleton, commander of VIII Corps, was looking out for him. The two had known each other since World War I. Colonel Ted Seely, commander of the 110th Infantry, 28th Infantry Division, was hospitalized for shrapnel wounds. Seely had led the 110th through Normandy, the Siegfried Line, and Hurtgen Forest. He was well liked in the regiment, but for the time being, he was in the hospital. The 28th Division was part of Middleton’s VIII Corps. Middleton seized on the regimental opening created by Seely’s infirmity and suggested to General Norman Dutch Cota, the division commander, that he appoint Fuller as commanding officer (CO) of the 110th. Cota could hardly refuse such a coercive suggestion from his boss.\n\nFuller took command on November 24, just three days before his fiftieth birthday. Even in this moment of vindication, satisfaction eluded Hurley. He found himself in a tough spot, replacing a popular commander who fully intended to return to the regiment. What’s more, Fuller’s new executive officer, Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Strickler, wanted his job. Strickler was a fine officer who had guided another of the division’s regiments, the 109th, through the misery of Hurtgen Forest. As such, he had proven himself and felt he deserved to command the 110th. (In an ideal political environment, he probably would have been Cota’s choice.)\n\nFuller knew he was an outsider in this National Guard division. He had not been with these men of the 110th in Normandy and the Hurtgen, so he had much to prove to them. Some of his soldiers even thought he came from a desk job in Washington. One rumor had it that he had been a POW in World War I. All of this was, of course, false, but Fuller could do little to debunk such canards. Never much of a communicator, he had trouble establishing a rapport with the troops of his new command. He made very little impression on most of them.\n\nNor did he have any opportunity to ease his way into combat with them. Throughout the first two weeks of December, Fuller had worried incessantly over the vulnerability of his regiment. At that time, the 110th was spread so thin along the Our River that it covered the distance ordinarily assigned to an entire division. He had no continuous front line. He could do little more than establish company-sized strong points in strategically located towns such as Heinerscheid, Marnach, Hosingen, Holzthum, and Weiler. The Germans were just across the Our River, in Germany itself, close enough to cause all sorts of problems, Fuller knew.\n\nOn December 13, he moved his regimental command post from Consthum, a few miles from the Our, to Clervaux, a delightful resort town located several miles northwest of Consthum and farther away from the front. This was a good decision. Clervaux was ten times the size of Consthum. Most of Clervaux was nestled into low, flat ground between two prominent, pine-covered ridges. The narrow streets were lined with dense rows of two- and three-story houses. Charming shops and boutiques honeycombed the town. The Claravallis Hotel anchored Clervaux’s western exits. At the southeastern edge of town, a medieval monastery and a medieval castle, both built on prominent hills, towered above even the tallest pines. Clervaux was the perfect, centrally located place for Fuller’s headquarters. But the town’s picturesque beauty made little impression on the practical colonel. If the Germans ever came across the Our River in force, with a full-scale attack, Fuller knew his regiment would be in serious trouble.\n\nAt 0530 on December 16, that very thing happened. The Germans launched a powerful counteroffensive. Their tanks, troops, and artillery were everywhere. For a solid day and a half, they had been battering away at the 110th, slicing through the thinly held front, advancing west. In all that time, Colonel Fuller had been here, in his little office on the second floor of the Claravallis Hotel, trying to manage the battle. Communications were intermittent. Sometimes he had been able to talk with commanders by telephone or radio, sometimes not. Bad news had been steadily pouring in: the Germans had overrun Heinerscheid, they were past Marnach, they were roaring past the 3rd Battalion’s strong points at Hosingen and Consthum. The eastern side of Clervaux was dominated by a ridge, over which lay the little town of Reuler. All day long, Fuller had heard the sounds of fighting from over there, even as he received spotty reports from the town’s American defenders. Somewhere over that ridge, his soldiers were fighting and dying. Every minute the situation seemed to deteriorate further. Indeed, fighting had been going on all day in Clervaux itself, and Fuller knew that it would be only a matter of time until the Germans attacked his command post.\n\nThis made Normandy seem like a picnic. After all, the Americans had been the ones on the offensive in Normandy. The fighting there had been awful, but the Americans could call off their attacks at any time without much fear of a major German offensive. This situation in the Ardennes was different and much more perilous, Fuller knew. Since the prior morning, he had understood that his unit was at the epicenter of a massive and ambitious enemy offensive. It was a bit like being in the middle of a hurricane. The whole German army seemed to be attacking his lonely regiment. Time after time, he had tried to impress his superiors with the gravity of the situation, but they did not seem to understand. General Cota, from the division CP at Wiltz, ten miles to the southwest, had told him several times to hold at all costs. Fuller had done his best to comply, but Cota had given him precious little help.\n\nNow, at 1825 hours on Sunday, December 17, Colonel Fuller eyed the field telephone that rested on his little desk and contemplated his next move. His office reeked of the sickly sweet smell of pipe smoke. Outside in the hallway and in the lobby one floor below, all he heard was chaos. Wounded men were groaning and wailing. Medics were rushing about, doing anything they could to help the wounded. Staff officers and NCOs were hollering back and forth in a cacophony of confusing voices. One of his intelligence officers was deliberating as to whether he should burn the regimental codes and signals instructions.\n\nThe Claravallis Hotel, rectangular in shape but ornate in a charming, resort-town sort of way, now stank of mud, cordite, and fear. Fuller could hear small arms fire outside and a distant rumbling, too. He knew the source of the rumbling. Moments before, Lieutenant Colonel James Hughes, executive officer of the 2nd Battalion, had reported from Reuler and told Fuller that several German tanks had roared past his position on the way to Clervaux. The enemy tanks were on the way. After a day and a half of bitter fighting, Fuller had little left with which to stop them. In a matter of minutes, they would drive into town from the northwest and roll right up to the Claravallis.\n\nThe colonel knew that he and his headquarters group were in serious jeopardy. For thirty-six hours he had done his best to hold at all costs, as his orders stated, but now he knew he had to retreat or die. For several hours he had actually been pleading with division for permission to withdraw (many of his subordinates were doing the same with him), but to no avail. Now he knew for certain that if he did not withdraw, the 110th command group, and whatever else was left of this fine regiment, would face complete annihilation. If they got out of Clervaux right now, though, they just might be able to set up a new defensive line along the road to Bastogne.\n\nFuller picked up the phone and called the division CP in Wiltz. He got Colonel Jesse Gibney, Cota’s chief of staff. Outside, Fuller heard the rumbling grow louder. The tanks were getting closer. He quickly described the desperate situation at Clervaux and asked for permission to withdraw to a new position on the Bastogne road.\n\nGibney cut Fuller off: Your orders are positively to defend in place and give up no ground.\n\nNever one to use much tact in dealing with superiors (or anyone else), Fuller was nearing a breaking point and replied, Let me talk to General Cota about this.\n\nGeneral Cota is at dinner and can’t be reached by phone, Gibney responded.\n\nThe quick-tempered Fuller could feel anger welling inside him. For some time now, tension had been brewing between Gibney and him. He sensed that the chief of staff did not respect his assessment of the situation, and that Gibney had little understanding of the crisis they all faced.\n\nThe tanks outside were getting closer by the second. The ominous noise of their engines filled the hallways of the Claravallis. A staff officer popped into Fuller’s office and reported that six German tanks were in the street, right outside.\n\nFuller’s anger gave way to a mixture of sadness and fear as he resumed his conversation with Gibney: Since you’re transmitting the general’s orders, I have no choice but obey them and fight in place. He could not resist adding a flourish, one that emanated from his Texas roots. I should tell you that we’re basically in the same predicament that Colonel Travis found himself in at the Alamo. We will never surrender or retreat.\n\nNo sooner had those words left Fuller’s mouth when a volley of three German tank shells crashed into the S1 office on the first floor, right below him. The noise of the explosions was overwhelming. It felt as though the entire hotel would come crashing down. The enemy tanks were shooting point-blank, probably from a distance of only fifteen yards outside the hotel.\n\nWhat was that? Gibney asked.\n\nGerman tanks, Fuller replied. He could not help but feel a bit of vindication. Yes, the situation was this bad. Why hadn’t Gibney and Cota been able to understand that? Now it was too late. Fuller had no more time to talk. Gibney was saying something, but Fuller cut him off and hung up the phone. Somewhere downstairs German soldiers were yelling. Orders or not, Fuller knew he had to get his people out of there.\n\nThis really is like the Alamo, Fuller thought, but on a much larger scale and with many more lives at stake. Clearly the Germans now controlled Clervaux, but could anyone stop them from capturing Bastogne? Fuller did not know. Even as he scrambled into action at the Claravallis, thousands of other American soldiers all over the Bastogne corridor were dealing with the same furious German onslaught, fighting for their lives. Somewhere out there in the darkness, each and every one of them was experiencing his own Alamo in the Ardennes.1\n\n1\n\nBEFORE THE FURY\n\n1\n\nThe Hurtgen Forest was a horrible nightmare, but it was over now. For some it was over because they were dead. But for the living, Hurtgen was now just a bitter memory, albeit one that would never really fade. In the middle of November 1944, the 28th Infantry Division left the Hurtgen Forest and convoyed south to the Ardennes.\n\nIn just two weeks in the Hurtgen, the division had suffered over six thousand casualties. Now platoons were the size of squads. Companies were the size of platoons. Battalions were the size of companies. The unit had been fighting since July in Normandy and it badly needed rest and replacements. Veterans needed time to rebuild their shattered nerves, put the misery of the forest behind them, and maybe enjoy life again. New arrivals needed a chance to ease into their new assignments, make friends, feel a part of something, and learn how to survive in combat.\n\nThe Ardennes, everyone thought, was the ideal place for this rest. The Ardennes was quiet. This was the ghost sector, a place where the war was taking a holiday. The soldiers of the 28th Division, nicknamed the Bloody Bucket for its distinctive divisional symbol, fanned out all over the Bastogne corridor in Luxembourg. They settled into towns, manned outposts, and did some training. More than anything, though, they rested. The Germans seemed to be doing the same.\n\nThanksgiving came on November 23 that year. For survivors and replacements alike, there was much to be thankful for—security, warmth, and some wonderful food. The cooks prepared turkey, gravy, potatoes, cranberry sauce, and everything else that goes with a traditional Thanksgiving dinner. There was more food than even these hungry men could eat. One company in the 112th Infantry received four hundred pounds of turkey complete with trimmings. That day we all could say we had something to be thankful for, a soldier recalled.\n\nSome GIs even had Thanksgiving dinner with Luxembourgers. Sergeant Herman Ham Kramer ate dinner in Colmar-Berg at the home of a local tavern keeper: He had squirreled away some wine from the Germans. He brought out that wine. With a flourish, the tavern keeper first poured a small bit of wine in his glass and then larger portions into the glasses of the Americans. Somebody asked him why he did that. It’s a local tradition, he replied. If there’s any impurity or cork, I will take that in my glass. Kramer and his friends were impressed: The people there in Luxembourg were just great. They admired us and were so grateful to us.1\n\nIndeed they were, and the admiration cut both ways. The Germans had swallowed up the tiny, beautiful country in May 1940. The ensuing occupation was difficult for the rebellious and independence-minded Luxembourgers. The Germans impressed private citizens into work as laborers and conscripted young men for their army. Anyone who opposed the Germans risked being hauled away to a concentration camp. On September 10, 1944, the Americans had liberated Luxembourg, ending four years of tyranny and restoring freedom to a people who yearned for it. September 10 is to most Luxembourgers what July 14 is to the French or July 4 to the Americans: a day of liberty and celebration.\n\nSo it was only natural that the 28th Division soldiers quickly established strong, enduring ties of friendship with the Luxembourgers of the Ardennes. In Clervaux, Sergeant Bob Bradicich, a squad leader in E Company, 110th Infantry, found several surrogate families: We could get some food from the ‘mess hall,’ and I gave it to the civilian families and sometimes would eat with them at their house. This went on for a couple of weeks.\n\nOne night a young girl, in response to his kindness, gave him a card that had a soldier’s prayer written on it. Bradicich was touched. He had lived through the Hurtgen Forest, and he knew that a soldier needed every bit of help he could get—temporal or spiritual—to survive. He tucked the card away and resolved to carry it with him everywhere.\n\nJust down the street from Bradicich, medics like Sergeant Andrew Puchany had plenty of time to treat local patients because of the absence of combat casualties. Puchany and his buddies had a couple of favorite patients, including a sweet girl of eighteen who had ulcers on her legs and a bearded lady friend. Sergeant Gene Fasig was a medic in D Company of the 103rd Medical Battalion, part of which was at Ettelbruck, far behind the frontline outposts. He and the twenty-one other medics, in the course of their duties, met and befriended plenty of locals: The civilian population was very good to us, and we will never forget the friends we made there. We planned to show our appreciation by giving a party for as many of the local children as we could cram into our living quarters. Candy and foodstuffs were donated by every man who received a package from home … a program of entertainment was being whipped into shape. Already we had a Christmas tree up in our OR [operating room] trimmed with anything and everything that had color. As the citizens of Ettelbruck strolled by, many of them donated ornaments for the tree.\n\nThe scene was much the same to the north in Wiltz, a picturesque river town of some four thousand people where General Cota had set up his division headquarters. Sergeant Paul Luther and another small group of D Company, 103rd Battalion medics, set up their hospital in a school building in the middle of town. He and six other men slept on the upper floor of a near1by bakery: We slept on the floor on our own blankets and even had access to a toilet. Across the street was a pub operated by a very nice family. They always had pastry snacks and drinks available and were friendly to everyone. As in Ettelbruck, the Americans were planning a nice Christmas party with a tree and plenty of goodies for the kids.2\n\nEven frontline soldiers like Private David Skelly, a machine gunner in D Company, 109th Infantry, got the chance to experience the festive atmosphere. The line companies of his regiment rotated back and forth from the front, affording soldiers like Skelly the opportunity to rest in Diekirch, a small town located four miles east of Ettelbruck: We were sent to … quarters in a hotel, where I immediately made friends with several civilians. We were constantly surrounded by children who always asked us for chewing gum and chocolate. To my astonishment, there was among them a ten-year-old girl who understood a little English and even spoke it. I became especially fond of her and often brought her something to eat.\n\nTwo miles north of Wiltz, at Eschweiler, the soldiers of the 28th Division Mechanized Reconnaissance Troop grew especially close to the people. One of the recon troopers, Private George Mergenthaler, forged such deep friendships that he made a permanent impression on the town’s history. Mergenthaler was a child of privilege, heir to a printing fortune, and a graduate of Princeton University. He had chosen to serve in combat as a private soldier. Urbane, witty, and kind, he spoke both German and French. Quick with a smile or a joke, he made friends rapidly. He was helping us always, Michel Huberty, a resident of Eschweiler, remembered. He was cutting wood and carrying the hay to the cattle. He was a fine lad.\n\nPerhaps his best friend in town was Father Antoine Bodson, the local priest. Mergenthaler was a Catholic kid. He and Father Bodson enjoyed conversing in both English and French. For a short time, Private Mergenthaler even lived in the rectory before moving to the home of a local family. Father Bodson enjoyed the companionship of this American: He felt in my house like at home. He was treated like a brother and after a few days we were the best friends. Every night we sat together, listening to the broadcasting. Sometimes he dined … with me. Out of my library he got books … to read. Every morning he went with me to Holy Mass and Communion.\n\nMergenthaler and his buddies, like Private Cletus LaFond, often ate with the people of Eschweiler: At mealtimes many times, the boys were invited to share the home cooking of their hosts, and reciprocated by bringing some of their GI food, chocolate and fruit juices to the kindly people. Private Mergenthaler spent much of his spare time helping the villagers with chores or dispensing care package items his wealthy family had sent him.3\n\nOf course, most of the GIs were not as pure of heart as Mergenthaler. Plenty of them were on the make. In Wiltz, Clervaux, and several other places, American soldiers prowled the streets looking for willing women. There were dances and movies. Rest-center hotels in the larger towns teemed with GIs who were looking for a good time anywhere they could find it. There was also plenty of beer hall carousing. Sergeant Gene Fasig and several other medics drank most of their nights away with Ettelbruck women: Our group took advantage of the recreation offered by this quiet Luxembourg town and almost immediately female connections were made and the beachheads of love were well established.\n\nAt Knaposcheid, a little burg half a mile north of Eschweiler, Private E. C. Wilson, a truck driver in the 630th Tank Destroyer Battalion, marveled at the skill with which his buddy Sam Christopher pursued women. The 630th had been in Europe since the previous summer, and everywhere women fell for Chris, as Wilson and the other soldiers called him. I don’t care where we went, what town, what nationality, the women took to him. Here at Knaposcheid they were billeted in the home of a farm family that had a teenage daughter. She had already attracted Christopher. She was already making a play for him. The close proximity of the girl’s parents kept the prospective lovers apart for the time being, but Wilson knew it was just a matter of time until Chris and the girl got together.\n\nIn frontline towns like Weiler, civilians had long since been evacuated to safer areas, but there were exceptions. Sometimes the Americans permitted local farmers to harvest their crops on quiet days. On one such day, Private First Class Thomas Myers of I Company, 110th Infantry, noticed two young women harvesting potatoes in a nearby field. He and an NCO buddy walked over to them and checked their passes to make sure they were authorized to be in the area. At close hand, we could see that under the bandannas, the heavy woolen sweaters, skirts, and stockings were two quite attractive young women. Myers and his sergeant were pressed for time, so they checked the passes, made some small talk, found out that the two were sisters, and moved on.\n\nBut the sergeant did not forget what he had seen. A few days later, the women were back. The sergeant said to PFC Myers, Let’s go check some civilian passes. The two soldiers walked toward the potato field. Watch my style, the sergeant said. I’m going to talk one of those gals into ‘going for a walk’ with me. Myers knew exactly what going for a walk meant. He was happily married with a two-year-old daughter at home, and he had no intention of going for a walk.\n\nThe sergeant was his buddy, though, and Myers was curious to see how this would turn out: The … Luxembourgers accepted our gifts of chewing gum and ‘D’ bars while my friend turned his charm on the younger of the two sisters. The language barrier… was great, but I am sure that she understood by his gestures that he wanted her to go for a walk with him. She refused to go anywhere.\n\nPFC Myers was amazed to see the older sister start walking away, beckoning for him to follow. Curious, he followed her over a hill to the end of the field. She unpacked a homemade bacon sandwich and handed it to him. They sat down and began to eat. Myers was not sure what else to do: It then became obvious that all she wanted was to hear about America and my family.\n\nThey had trouble communicating but spent a pleasant half hour doing their best to understand each other. When they finished eating, they got up and went back over the hill. The sergeant was still trying to make time with the kid sister, but with no more luck than before. Admitting defeat, he gave up and went back to Weiler with Myers. All the way there, he fumed while an amused Myers tried to keep from laughing: [He] began cursing about his bad luck and my good luck. I never told him what we did but let him assume what happened.4\n\nMovie star Marlene Dietrich and her USO troupe were making the rounds of the Ardennes that December, entertaining the troops. The German-born but fully Americanized actress could not have been very popular with the Nazis, so it was fairly courageous of her to entertain soldiers that close to the front.\n\nLieutenant William Pena attended a dinner on the evening of Saturday, December 9, 1944, in which Dietrich was the guest of honor. He and his unit, I Company, 109th Infantry, were fresh off the front lines, resting now in Diekirch: Our men were grouped in unoccupied homes and buildings, and the officers roomed at the hotels. Pena was staying in the Hotel des Ardennes right in the middle of town. A native of Houston, Texas, he was the executive officer of the company. He had been fighting since September, and he was ready for some fun.\n\nThat night he and the other battalion officers gathered at a smaller hotel just down the street for the dinner. Everyone wore dress uniforms and polished boots. Several female nurses from a nearby medical unit also attended. Lieutenant Pena sat at a table in the front of the room, right next to Dietrich’s head table: [She] looked a bit older than I remembered her in the movies, and she seemed tired from traveling, but then with us she was not onstage. Still, her glamour permeated the room. Every table was draped with long tablecloths that nearly touched the floor. Pena and his friends spent much of the dinner bemoaning the fact that they couldn’t see her beautiful legs.\n\nAfter the dinner, Pena and the other officers went back to their hotel for a dance with the nurses, while Dietrich and her troupe went to a nearby recreation hall to entertain the enlisted men. The evening was a success. She planned to come back to Diekirch and perform for the officers in less than a week.\n\nThe next day, December 10, she was a few miles to the northwest visiting the 687th Field Artillery Battalion at the Hotel du Moulin near Bourscheid. Like Pena the night before, Lieutenant Les Eames, a young officer in the survey section of Headquarters Battery, was looking forward to seeing the movie star’s legs (and much of the rest of her). He too was disappointed. Dietrich showed up for lunch in a loose-fitting paratrooper’s uniform. To make matters worse, she was impatient as the devil… sat down to eat w/o introductions or how-do-you-do, bitched, crabbed, took off zzzzip! Saw her show later in the PM, not good, but not too bad.5\n\n2\n\nA few miles east of where Dietrich and her supporting cast were performing, the war was still going on. Quiet sector or not, the men at the front were dealing with all the usual privations of combat: exposure to the elements, fatigue, and constant danger. General Norman Dutch Cota’s overwrought division was stretched along a thin line of outposts and strong points that paralleled either side of the Our River. The division’s northern neighbor was initially the 2nd Infantry Division, but a few days before the German offensive, the brand-new, raw 106th Infantry Division replaced the 2nd. To the south, the 9th Armored Division bordered the 28th. The 28th had so much ground to defend that Cota was forced to keep all three of his regiments on the line.\n\nIn the north, the 112th Infantry held the smallest sector but was actually in the midst of the Siegfried Line, east of the Our, in Germany itself. From Lutzkampen in the north through Harspelt in the center, to Sevenig in the south, the regiment covered a reasonable distance of three and a half miles. Since my sector was closest to the enemy lines, in some cases not over 140 yards, it was the shortest of the division front, Colonel Gustin Nelson, the CO, later explained. He was a bald, energetic, courageous West Pointer. His class of 1921, with only seventeen graduates, had been the smallest in the history of the academy.\n\nHe and his officers made sure that the troops dug in well, set up interlocking fields of fire, and protected their holes against the possibility of tree bursts. Nelson even devised several contingency plans in the event of a German attack. He placed his command post at Ouren, a little town that hugged the western banks of the Our. The 112th was the only 28th Division regiment with a continuous, fully defended front.\n\nTo the south, Hurley Fuller’s 110th Infantry was covering more than thirteen miles of Ardennes territory. So overstretched was the 110th that Fuller could place his companies only in strong points astride the strategically situated towns of Heinerscheid, Marnach, Hosingen, Holzthum, and Weiler. A paved, ridge-lined road, dubbed the Skyline Drive by the Americans, stretched from north to south, connecting many of the strong-point towns.\n\nWhile the companies did have some support from an eclectic mix of tanks, tank destroyers, self-propelled artillery, and engineers, they could not hope to man an uninterrupted line. Small groups of soldiers would outpost the Our, a couple of miles to the east, during the day and return to their towns at night. Fuller’s companies were constantly running contact patrols to stay in touch. One can scarcely imagine a more thinly held sector. The 110th was responsible for twice as much territory as any regiment could be expected to control, yet it had only two of its battalions at the front. Much to Fuller’s chagrin, the other battalion was behind the lines, in division reserve, and he was miffed at Cota about that. Very dangerous gaps in our lines existed, Fuller said. This plan of defense, however, was what was ordered by … Norman D. Cota.\n\nFarther to the south, the 109th Infantry was in a similar situation, patrolling more than ten miles of rolling country west of the Our. As with the 110th, there was no bona fide defensive line, only town- and crossroads-centered strong points in the vicinity of Walsdorf, Fouhren, Longsdorf, Hoesdorf, and Reisdorf. Here, too, soldiers often outposted the Our during the day and pulled back at night.\n\nThe division after-action report described the area quite succinctly: The terrain along the entire division front is extremely hilly, much of it covered with pine forests. Observation is difficult because of the many wooded draws. The road net is fair. Actually the roads were everything in the Ardennes. The terrain was so hilly, so studded with woods and deep draws, that mechanized forces were often road-bound. The 110th and 112th Infantry Regiments held the most vital road routes of advance to Bastogne. This was the Bastogne corridor.6\n\nFor the combat soldiers of the 28th Division, life at the front in December was a series of routines. Private Charles Haug’s B Company, 112th Infantry, was clustered in foxholes on a hillside overlooking Lutzkampen. The town was ghostly, its residents long gone. At any given time, the Germans or the Americans might be in the town, using the buildings for observation. Beyond Lutzkampen, Private Haug, a platoon runner, could just make out pillboxes and dragon’s teeth on the Siegfried Line. The pillboxes were enormous concrete bunkers, bristling with machine guns or artillery pieces. They dotted the landscape seemingly in a haphazard fashion, but actually they were expertly set up to support one another. The dragon’s teeth were foot-high lumps of concrete, laid out in tight, even rows, carpeting the countryside in hopes of impeding Allied tanks. Outside of a few shells flying back and forth, little was happening. Our kitchen crew moved up … just behind our hill. We were fed two meals a day. One at about four o’clock in the morning and one about nine o’clock at night. We had to eat during the darkness because we couldn’t take the chance of getting out of our holes and moving during the daylight.\n\nOccasionally the men could get out of their holes and move around in the daytime. Lieutenant Charles Hogzett, a platoon leader, even allowed his soldiers to have a little fun: We … let them go back down into the valley behind our defensive positions, where there was an open area about a hundred yards square, where they exercised by running and throwing a football around.\n\nPrivate Alexander Hadden, a rifleman in B Company, was new to the world of combat. He was a bright nineteen-year-old who had once been enrolled in the Army Specialized Training Program, or ASTP. The program afforded young men who did well on aptitude tests the opportunity to go to college on the army’s dime. Secretary of War Henry Stimson had designed the program in hopes of attracting intelligent youngsters to the army and ultimately protecting them from frontline combat. But the program did not survive the voracious needs of the war machine. By 1944 the army was in dire need of more combat troops, so the ASTP was disbanded. Hadden and thousands of others like him ended up in frontline infantry units.\n\nDay by day, he adjusted to life on the front line: Activity centered around standing guard at whichever of the company positions we happened to be occupying at the time. While there were a few sunny days—much relished of course—the skies hung low and were mostly gray, with rain or snow from time to time. Endless time was devoted to keeping warm, fed, and dry, though very little could be done about keeping clean. Hadden and his buddies rotated two hours in [a] covered foxhole sleeping and trying to keep warm, and two hours maintaining vigil towards the east and being cold. It was a mind-numbing routine of course. Sometimes at night a flare or a star shell would burst over the lines, illuminating the whole area for a few spooky minutes. Then things would get quiet again.\n\nIn no time, Private Hadden came down with a nasty diarrhea problem, a common malady for frontline troops. Thus began a months-long intimacy with diarrhea, and its close and malevolent cousin, dysentery. I don’t think I ever shook them altogether. When the urge came, Hadden crawled, crab-walked, or ran to a nearby slit trench that served as a latrine, and did his business.\n\nBy and large, the front was very quiet. Sergeant Murray Shapiro, a machine gunner, was holed up in a position near Sevenig, a mile south of Lutzkampen. He received \"rations of beer or coke … tobacco … reading material consisting of daily issues of Stars and Stripes … Yank, and all kinds of paperback books … as well as occasional handouts of razors, pens etc.\" They also got plenty of mail from home, including Christmas care packages.7\n\nAt times, neither side seemed very interested in maintaining hostilities. Bedford Davis, the surgeon for 2nd Battalion, 109th Infantry, was visiting the front with General Cota one sunny day when he observed a humorous, and revealing, conversation between the general and a soldier: Some of the men were lying on the ground outside their foxholes and slit trenches to absorb the welcome sunshine. German soldiers about two hundred yards away were doing the same.\n\nAs Dr. Davis watched, the general began talking to one of the sunbathing men: Son, do you see that man over there wearing a gray uniform?\n\nYes sir, the soldier replied.\n\nDon’t you know he is your enemy?\n\nYes sir.\n\nWhy don’t you shoot at him then?\n\nSir, he might shoot back!\n\nEverybody laughed, including General Cota. He wanted his troops to be aggressive, but he knew, in this quiet sector, the man was right. Why shoot at someone if he was not shooting at you?\n\nOccasionally German patrols would slip across the Our River, look around for a bit, and quickly go back. Rarely was there much shooting. Troops from the 109th were amazed and amused to see what went on in some of the Siegfried Line fortifications across the Our. Pillbox defense appeared to have its romantic moments, one regimental officer wrote, as female figures could occasionally be seen in the dusk entering the ‘boxes,’ and then leaving at dawn to return to the small villages in the rear.\n\nSeveral miles to the north, Private First Class Robert Probach witnessed the same kind of permissive environment. He had been wounded two and a half months before, and he was just now returning to his unit, F Company of the 110th Infantry: \"We would drive about three miles to the high banks overlooking the Our River. We would wave to the Germans on the other side. Sometimes we would shout"
