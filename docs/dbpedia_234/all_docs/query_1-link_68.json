        "text": "Docu-Series Explores The Lives Of Four Women As They Tackle Everyday Challenges, All While Living With Paralysis\n\nPush Girl ’push ’gər(-ə)l noun, definition:\n\n(a) A fierce, fearless female who is not helpless, hapless or hopeless. (b) A powerful woman who might be confined by a wheelchair but does not let her paralysis confine or define her life. (c) A person who sheds their handicap and faces life head on.\n\nPasadena, CA – January 14, 2012 – In the same way \"Murderball,\" winner of the 2005 Audience Award for Best Documentary at the Sundance Film Festival, took the lid off the competitive world of “wheelchair rugby,” Sundance Channel is bringing an unfettered, uncensored glimpse at what it means to be sexy, ambitious and living with paralysis in Hollywood with “Push Girls”, a new original non-fiction series from producer Gay Rosenthal (\"Ruby,\" \"Little People, Big World\"). Sundance Channel has ordered 14 episodes of the half-hour long docu-series, tracing the lives of four dynamic, outspoken and beautiful women who, by accident or illness, have been paralyzed from the neck or the waist down. The announcement was made today by Sarah Barnett, Sundance Channel General Manager. The series, which is currently in production, is slated to premiere in April 2012.\n\n\"The indomitable spirit of this series will give viewers permission to stare at a world that they may previously have been too polite – or too frightened – to explore,” says Barnett. “Sundance Channel allows the ‘Push Girls’ to convey the stark reality of their lives, something our broadminded audience will appreciate. We are remarkably fortunate to get to work with this exceptional group of women.\"\n\nGay Rosenthal commented, \"Watching the ‘Push Girls’ tackling life with spirit and confidence is not only inspiring but compelling. The show challenges perceptions about life in a wheelchair, giving the audience an honest, no nonsense look into their world. It’s real, it’s outspoken and it’s from the heart. I am delighted to share their story on a network that prides itself on authentic, bold and respectful storytelling.”\n\nTaking a matter-of-fact attitude towards their disabilities, “Push Girls” offers a candid view of the women as they pursue their own claims to happiness as they enter different stages of their lives. Angela is a down-to-earth, stunningly gorgeous model who has recently become separated from her husband. Auti, a dancer, rapper, actress and all-around powerhouse, is crossing her fingers that, at age 42, she can try for a baby with her husband. Reflective and pragmatic Mia is taking stock of her relationship with her able-bodied boyfriend; a onetime competitive swimmer, she is about to attempt to swim for the first time since high school. Flirty, wisecracking Tiphany is doing some deep soul-searching about her sexuality, settling down and finding her calling in life.\n\nToday’s announcement continues the network’s commitment to original unscripted content, which topped 70 hours in 2011 and included popular series “The Mortified Sessions,” “Girls Who Like Boys Who like Boys” and “All on the Line with Joe Zee.”\n\nMarco Bresaz and Jonathan Grosskopf will serve as “Push Girls” Executive Producers for Sundance Channel.\n\nAbout Sundance Channel\n\nSundance Channel is the destination for What’s Next, Now.
