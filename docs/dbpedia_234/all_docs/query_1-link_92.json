        "text": "On New Year’s Eve 1989, Eastern Europe reached a historic turning point. Communist dictatorships collapsed one by one. Only in Romania were the guns ringing out, where the hated dictator was executed by the rebels on those very days. Everyone was excited to see what new world, what new life, the new year would bring.\n\nIn Hungary, a successful film crew gathered in Kádár’s former villa to bid farewell to the new year and celebrate the new possibilities. But before the clock struck midnight, the dark shadows of the past unexpectedly appeared and called into question the beautiful future.\n\nWhat would the new year bring and what would be to toast? Will the truth of power prevail, or the power of truth?\n\nEven before the outbreak of the Second World War, the officials of the Bank of Hungary were already working on how to protect the Hungarian gold reserve, the Holy Crown and other national treasures from foreign powers.\n\nAt the end of the war, the officials of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank managed to escape German and Soviet plundering and to flee to Spital am Pyhrn, a small Austrian mountain village, the assets of the Central Bank and the Hungarian state: 600 crates, 30 tons of gold reserves, banknotes and documents.\n\nThis film was inspired by the book “Flow”, written by the Hungarian émigré Mihály Csíkszentmihályi. The model suggested by Csíkszentmihály aims at uncovering the secret of true happiness in a book loved many around the globe. His hypothesis states that a varied selection if activities (work, art, play, study) and impulses can create a sensation that he simply calls “flow”. This film follows the spark of his original as it smoulders, sizzles and eventually bursts into fabulous flames.\n\nBéla Biszku was one of the leaders of the reprisals after the 1956 Hungarian Revolution and War of Independence. As Minister of the Interior, he led the purges and bloody crackdown on freedom fighters. Since the democratic change of regime, Béla Biszku has lived in seclusion and has never spoken about his past actions. The film’s two creators donned disguises and, as enthusiastic locals, rang the bell to the once-feared interior minister. Luring out the retaliator hiding in retreat has shed light to the inner workings of his mind, and how he copes with the past. Watch our multiple award film."
