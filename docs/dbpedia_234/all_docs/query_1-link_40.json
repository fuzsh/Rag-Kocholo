        "text": "\"Liquid Sky\" is a gonzo comedy, a solarized downtown farce set in the wee hours just before the sun came up on Ronald Reagan's morning in America.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/4 | Jun 11, 2024\n\n...the costumes are wild, the NYC club scene is well caught, and the print on Amazon Prime is surprisingly good; if you’ve never heard of it, broad-minded viewers will always find something outré in this weird and occasionally wonderful film.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | Jan 23, 2024\n\nThe film's throbbing music score, trippy effects, and commentary on sex, drugs & (punk) rock'n'roll mark it as a particularly spacey odyssey.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Aug 29, 2021\n\nThe film is a melange of electric theatre, parody, caricature and mock-seriousness. It works well if you let it. Some might not bother. But I rather liked it.\n\nFull Review | Aug 20, 2021\n\nKnowingly kitsch, Liquid Sky uses the most basic effects and featuring music and fashion that were cutting edge at the time, it now looks fashionably retro.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | May 30, 2007\n\nOutrageous fun, this film is New Wave chic, satire, self-parody, science fiction, and certainly one of the more accessible independent features ever made.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/4 | Apr 11, 2007\n\nCapturing the manner and humor of a comic strip about punk culture, Liquid Sky is the brain product of Slava Tsukerman, a Soviet emigre in NY; like the aliens in his cult flick, he explores the exotic pleasures denied him in his native country.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: B | Nov 15, 2006"
