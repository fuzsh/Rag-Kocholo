We seek to give an outlet to the experimental, the fan films, the 48 hour film projects, the student films, the films that may not have such a happy ending, the films that challenge the audience to think and feel.\n\nABOUT THE FESTIVAL\n\nFounded in 2004 by Frankly Zoe Productions as a one off festival meant to promote their Youth Summer Movie Program, F3: Frankly Film Fest screened 27 films during the 2005 festival. In 2016 Frankly Zoe Productions decided to resurrect F3 in conjunction with the Tenth Anniversary of Un-Con, an unconventional convention where all genres of fandom are welcome and accepted. In keeping with the \"all genres are welcome\" theme of the Un-Con, F3 is an all genre festival.\n\nThe 2016 F3: Frankly Film Fest received 685 submissions from 39 different countries. Of those 685 films, 50 were chosen to screen during the weekend festival. There were awards given for \"Best Short\", \"Best Feature\", \"Best Student Film\", and \"Best of Fest\".\n\nFor the 2017 festival F3 became a shorts only festival. The festival received 499 submissions from 41 different countries. Awards were given for \"Best Student Short\", \"Best Non-Student Short\", \"Best of Fest\", \"Judges Choice\", and \"The Steve Turner Award.\"\n\nFor the 2018 festival, 401 entries were received from 40 countries. Forty films were screened at our festival.\n\nIn order to be fair to all filmmakers, no fee waivers will be granted.\n\nInternational Festival\n\nShort film festival\n\nFiction Documentary Animation Fantastic Terror Other Experimental Music Video\n\nTRIBE Project brings you Through My Eyes Film Festival.\n\nThrough My Eyes is an international and Indigenous short film festival that seeks to showcase the stories of Indigenous peoples from all over the world. The festival aims to redefine the word Indigenous, originally meaning \"of the land\", and in doing so, create community through the understanding that we are all indigenous to somewhere. It doesn't matter if you're native to the United States, the aboriginal lands of Australia, Europe, Asia, or Africa.\n\nSubmissions need not be limited to content that explores Indigenous or Native Identity (though that is welcome). We seek radical inclusivity that embraces stories from the land you come from and the places that your ancestors once called home. From the heart of Native American actress and filmmaker, Tiger Moon, Through My Eyes is seeking submissions for LA's 4th annual Indigenous short film festival.\n\nInternational Festival\n\nShort film festival\n\nFiction Documentary Animation Fantastic Experimental Music Video\n\nThe Overcome Film Festival is a venue for all storytellers, filmmakers, and artists to tell the world their stories of survival and triumph over adversity. It is the focus of the film festival to give survivors a voice and a venue to share their life experiences and provide hope to others. Everyone is invited to participate with their work. Animation, narrative and non-narratives, audiovisual poetry films, and experimental works are accepted.\n\nThe Overcome Film Festival especially encourages the entries of anyone who wants to share their experiences in overcoming challenges, illnesses, disabilities or any other factor that has contributed to their growth as a person and motivated them to celebrate their existence.\n\nThe Overcome Film Festival is an international event and everyone all over the world is encouraged and welcome to participate.\n\nShort and Feature international films (all countries).\n\nInternational Festival\n\nShort film festival\n\nFeature film festival\n\nFiction Documentary Animation Fantastic Terror Other Experimental Music Video"
