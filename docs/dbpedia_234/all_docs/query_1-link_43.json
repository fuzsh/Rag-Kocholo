        "text": "IN OUR CONSERVATION CONSCIOUS times Hollywood often pursues its own recycling program. As if determined to waste little of its legacy, the film industry dusts off and finds new uses for movie concepts from the past, not only in official remakes but also in uncredited rehashes and inspired variations on a theme.\n\nFor example, when ''A Life Less Ordinary,'' starring Cameron Diaz and Ewan McGregor, opens on Friday, movie buffs will likely feel that they are watching something familiar. This romantic comedy is aggressively unconventional, punctuated by kidnapping, patricidal urges and oozing entrance wounds, yet there is still something old-fashioned about the film.\n\nFans of Frank Capra's ''It Happened One Night'' (1934), starring Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert, will recognize the story's basic situation: a recently dismissed working man and a rebellious heiress are thrown together on a rollicking road trip. Fans of Michael Powell's whimsical ''Stairway to Heaven'' (1946) will find something familiar in the theme of heavenly interference in earthly romance. And these similarities are not accidental. While preparing to film ''A Life Less Ordinary,'' the director, Danny Boyle, showed the two old movies to his cast and members of his crew.\n\nMr. Boyle, the British director of the iconoclastic films ''Trainspotting'' and ''Shallow Grave,'' is making his American debut with ''A Life Less Ordinary'' -- in the company of his usual collaborators, the producer Andrew Macdonald and the screenwriter John Hodge -- but he's still unquestionably a maverick. When it comes to drawing inspiration from movies of the past, however, he is right in line with mainstream filmmakers. His more conventional colleagues, with varying degrees of care and success, have been proving for years that the old can be made new again.\n\n''The Money Pit'' (1986) is easily seen as a yuppie update of ''Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House,'' the 1948 Cary Grant comedy. Five years ago, audiences flocked to see a movie about a showgirl who hides out in a cloistered setting. Whoopi Goldberg fans know that this story belongs to ''Sister Act''; aficionados of old movies will also recognize the premise from ''Ball of Fire,'' the 1941 Howard Hawks film starring Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck. ''Rookie of the Year'' (1993) was a children's version of ''It Happens Every Spring,'' a 1949 baseball fantasy. And Steven Spielberg's most recent film, ''The Lost World: Jurassic Park,'' is in many ways a shrewd reworking of ''King Kong,'' substituting a tyrannosaurus for the giant ape.\n\nThis recycling of concepts can take many forms. ''A Life Less Ordinary'' uses ideas from old films as a springboard for post-modernist riffing. Explaining his preproduction screenings of ''It Happened One Night'' and ''Stairway to Heaven,'' Mr. Boyle said: ''You don't try to copy them, really. You genuinely just use them as reference points for a spirit within yourself. Personally, I don't like films that pay reference overtly and continually to something.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
