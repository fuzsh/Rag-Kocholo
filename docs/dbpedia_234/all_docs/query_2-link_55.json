        "text": "Normally, the first thing that I write for the column is the title, which gives me a certain amount of direction about where I’m going. This morning, I have no idea where I’m going, except for this: it’s almost stereotypical that our opinions become more “set in stone” as we age. That’s not been my experience.\n\nIn fact, I’ve changed my mind more in the last few years than I ever did as a younger man. Instead of thinking, “Oh, that’s nonsense,” I’m far more likely to think, “They may have a point.” That old joke defines middle age as “When a broad mind and a narrow waistband change places.” I still wouldn’t exactly refer to myself as “broad-minded,” but I’m changing.\n\nI don’t know why.\n\nTo be clear — my “core values” remain largely the same, the whole idea of “what makes Dave, Dave.” However, I’m finding it increasingly difficult to answer even a basic question like “Who is your favorite writer?” I’m not sure any more, so much so that I’m simply likely to name the writer that I’m reading at the moment and be done with it.\n\nSomeone asked me a really easy question the other day, “What is your favorite color?” … and I couldn’t choose. What followed was a small description of how it’s either blue or green. The only reason that I picked those two is that most of the shirts I own are either blue or green, and it seems to me that a person’s favorite color is the color of the clothing they wear most often. That’s it ― that’s my entire reason for that opinion.\n\nMore: David Murdock Column: On 18 years of writing a weekly column\n\nHowever … I do own shirts in other colors and wear them quite often, but for odd reasons. I have an orange-ish shirt that I wear in Fall simply because someone told me once that it was “a pretty color for Fall.” That’s it.\n\nThe whole idea of clothes shopping is a cultural phenomenon that entirely escapes me. Simply put ― nearly all my trousers are khaki because I know that khaki matches just about every shirt I own, so I don’t have to think about matching trousers to shirt when I get dressed. Nearly all my socks are black ― I simply gave up trying to match those years ago.\n\nSo, y’all can see how choosing something as consequential as a favorite writer would be for me ― it’s like saying, for all time, “this one is my favorite.” That’s just not true.\n\nOne recent example is Dorothy Sayers. Before about December of last year, I’d only read ONE of her detective novels featuring the character, Lord Peter Wimsey. And it was … OK. The only reason I read it was that I was doing some research into the history of detective novels — she’s a major figure in that field. I’d long enjoyed her non-fiction, her scholarly work. However, Wimsey just wasn’t for me.\n\nThen I re-read that book for some reason … and I was hooked. Since December, I’ve read all of Sayers’ novels featuring Wimsey (and four more novels by Jill Paton Walsh that continued the series after Sayers died). I love ‘em! Great “gentleman detective” character. Beautiful prose.\n\nWhat changed? I don’t know.\n\nHowever, now I do think of Sayers as one of my favorite fiction writers, and she’s among my absolute favorite detective fiction writers. Hands down, bar none. Even considering the company she keeps, like Agatha Christie and Dashiell Hammett.\n\nAnd, as I got close to finishing all of the Lord Peter Wimsey novels, I remember thinking, “Well, what am I going to do now?” several times. After all, 16 novels in just under two months is quite the immersive experience.\n\nI don’t know what I’ll do … except that I do. I’ve started on some other British detective fiction writers that I’ve ignored in the past, just to see if I like them now, too. (By the way, sorta “so-so” on that front.) If nothing else, I’m far more familiar with British slang from the 1920s and 1930s than I’ve ever been ― there are websites that are devoted to Sayers’ use of vernacular phrases … and also websites devoted to her allusions, which are extensive.\n\nThe only possible answer is that I’ve always regarded my life as an adventure of sorts. Honestly, living in Etowah County is far more of an adventure than is usually thought … as long as I have access to books. Every book is a new adventure, a new trip into the unknown.\n\nMore: David Murdock Column: On driving and being driven while taking in the sights\n\nMaybe that’s it. It seems like such a simple explanation, but it does explain. That’s more than I can say for any other reason.\n\nThat gets me back to another of my “favorite” subjects: proverbs and maxims. There’s a really old one, “You can’t teach an old dog new tricks.” That one ought to be amended with “… depending on the dog.”\n\nThere will always be some things about which this particular old dog doesn’t care ― like fashion ― but there are others about which he does. Books. Movies. Music.\n\nThere are even some things he cares more about now than ever before ― don’t get me started on great paintings or philosophy, fairly recent interests of mine. But I don’t think that I’ve ever lost a “favorite” ― those abide."
