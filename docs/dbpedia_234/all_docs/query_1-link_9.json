        "text": "I'll try to explain myself a bit better.\n\nI'm a microbiologist student, but I love reading about moviemaking and films in general. I've recently started reading some books about movies (Lumet's Making Movies and Walter Murch's In the Blink of an Eye) and I'm loving them but I've always prefered to learn about things by studying from examples. I've come across some \"mise-en-scene analysis\" thesis about some scenes from a movie, and although I liked reading about it, I didn't like the movie that much. So now I'm looking for more places where I could read about concrete analyzes about more movies.\n\nNot just broad reviews about the movie themself, but a much more focused study about why things were filmed the way they were; why did the director chose to present/hide such object from frame; why does the background music swell on a scene; etc...\n\nI know people joke about it, but I've always loved listening about my english professor's thoughts about a poem and analysing what the author must have been saying/thinking about on a certain poem/text."
