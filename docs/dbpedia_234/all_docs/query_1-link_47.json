        "text": "Pipedreams, American Public Media\n\nCathedral Resonances Michael Barone Week of August 11, 2013\n\nFor adventuresome and broad-minded viewers, I do recommend Paul Festa’s provocative film “Apparition of the Eternal Church,” which explores the unexpected responses of a variety of people to a first-time hearing of that mesmerizing 1931 score by Messiaen. It's a fascinating portrait of how people listen to music and what they imagine. (39:10)\n\nWhy We Listen: Three Songs and Many Questions\n\nWhy We Listen 05 - Paul FestaMarc KateApril 9, 2012\n\nHis film Apparition of the Eternal Church was one of my primary inspirations to start Why We Listen. It’s a sort of experimental documentary that observes people as they listen to Olivier Messiaen’s organ composition \"Apparition of the Eternal Church.\" It’s a really moving film and I recommend it very, very highly.\n\nThe New York Times\n\nMUSIC REVIEW Messiaen Moments, in Swells and Fanfares\n\nBy STEVE SMITH\n\nNovember 13, 2011\n\nYou needn’t be a pipe organ cabalist or an initiate of the new-music illuminati to be moved, even shaken, by Olivier Messiaen’s music for the instrument he played most of his life. “Apparition of the Eternal Church,” a 2006 film by Paul Festa, makes the point vividly; in it, Mr. Festa claps headphones on writers, performers and quasi celebrities, then captures their reactions of bemusement, perplexity and awe as they listen to Messiaen’s landmark 1932 piece, “Apparition de l’Église Éternelle.”\n\nnewyorker.com\n\nMusic critic Alex Ross's blog Unquiet Thoughts\n\nMessiaen video\n\nOctober 20, 2009\n\nTwo other Messiaen films worth seeing: the DVD of Pierre Audi’s Netherlands Opera production of \"St. Francis of Assisi,\" with a magnificent lead performance by Rod Gilfry; and Paul Festa’s mind-bending documentary \"Apparition of the Eternal Church.\"\n\nThe Globe and Mail\n\nDo you see what I hear?\n\nJuly 30, 2009\n\n\"This hour, watching headshots of individuals listening to music we can't hear, is entirely absorbing, moving – sublime, even. From invocations of religious imagery and howls of pain, to ecstasies of both the divine and the sexual, the immediate responses to the music are consistently hilarious, intelligent and primal.\"\n\nClevelandClassical.com\n\nPaul Festa talks about Apparition of the Eternal Church, the Messiaen film to screen at Oberlin May 5 (pdf)\n\nApril 27, 2009\n\n\"One of Festa’s brilliant editing touches is depriving the viewer from hearing the music until the very end of the film, when Messiaen’s Apparition de l’Eglise Éternelle, played by Olivier Latry, forms the soundtrack to a rather chilling collection of text slides, followed by the credits. The piece seems to have been transformed by the comments that have gone before, and we may never hear it quite the same way again.\"\n\nThe New Yorker\n\nThe Century Club: Celebrations of Carter and Messiaen\n\nJanuary 5, 2009\n\n\"Not everyone can put up with Messiaen’s Catholic ecstasies, but his canonical status seems assured, and his devotees are numerous and zealous. Paul Festa, who has made a remarkable film, “Apparition of the Eternal Church,” about the experience of listening to Messiaen, suggests that the composer has become the focus of a new kind of nondenominational religious feeling, distinct from Catholicism. Messiaen might have been horrified by the notion, but his binding together of sensual and spiritual impulses is a force that acts upon diverse audiences with unpredictable intensity.\"\n\nThe View From Here - Chicago Sun-Times critic Andrew Patner's blog\n\n2008 -- A very good Chicago classical and opera year -- Chicago Sun-Times\n\nDecember 27, 2008\n\n\"A knock-out Messiaen-on-acid documentary.\"\n\nThe Juilliard Journal\n\nQ&A With Paul Festa\n\nDecember, 2008\n\n\"The internationally acclaimed documentary...attempts to answer the question: what does Messiaen’s passionately Christian music sound like to non-Christians?
