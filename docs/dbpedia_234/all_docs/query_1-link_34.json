An event hell-bent on showcasing the most exciting, innovative and individualistic examples of contemporary international genre cinema from every corner of the globe.\n\n__________________________________\n\n- WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR?\n\nWhile predominantly a fantasy/action/horror festival, Fantasia has always embraced works whose sheer individuality puts them in a genre of their own. We’ve showcased everything from captivating dramas, eccentric comedies, provocative documentaries, mind-blowing experimental works, even atypical children’s films.\n\nWe encourage filmmakers of all backgrounds and obsessions to submit their work. Films coming from underrepresented horizons are always of interest.\n\nExplore our previous lineups to get a sense of our programming. We’re pretty broad-minded!\n\n__________________________________\n\n- TESTIMONIALS :\n\n“Fantasia is the most important and prestigious genre film festival on this continent.” — Quentin Tarantino\n\n“Fantasia is a shrine” — Guillermo del Toro\n\n“Fantasia remains to this day one of my very favorite film festivals in the world.” — James Gunn\n\n“I promise to make more genre films just so I can get invited back.” — Edgar Wright\n\n\"Fantasia has some of the best audiences and programming out there.

Among our accomplishments, Fantasia is regularly cited as the place where the J-horror craze began in this part of the world - our North American Premiere of RINGU led directly to Dreamworks acquiring the film and producing its blockbuster remake, and Fantasia was also the first festival in North America to screen a film by Takashi Miike.\n\nSome other programming coups? We were the first festival in the world to show work from a then-19-year-old Adam Wingard when we world premiered his feature debut HOME SICK, our World Premiere of PERFECT BLUE launched the career of Satoshi Kon, our World Premiere of THE MIDNIGHT SWIM launched Sarah Adina Smith and our Canadian premiere of PI marked the first time a film by Darren Aronofsky was shown in Canada.\n\nIn 2017, our International premiere of Nico van den Brink’s short SWEET TOOTH led directly to the gifted Dutch filmmaker being signed to Paradigm, with James Wan teaming up with him to make a feature adaptation of the film at New Line. In 2018, our International Premiere of David-Jan Bronsgees' short MEET JIMMY led to the filmmaker signing up with Paramount and Platinum Dunes for a feature-length adaptation. Our World Premiere of Daniel Goldhaber’s brilliant feature debut CAM saw the film brought by Netflix. More recently, Fantasia launched the Adams Family into genre stardom with our World Premiere of THE DEEPER YOU DIG (and subsequent World Premieres of HELLBENDER and WHERE THE DEVIL ROAMS). Our 2022 World Premiere of Kyle Edward Ball's singular instant-classic SKINAMARINK lead to the film's acquisition and enormously successful release by IFC and Shudder.\n\nWorld Premieres from our 2023 edition included Jared Moshe’s APORIA, Yuval Adler’s SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL, Jenn Wexler’s THE SACRIFICE GAME, Lim Sun-ae’s MS. APOCALYPSE, Larry Fessenden’s BLACKOUT, Teresa Sutherland’s LOVELY, DARK, AND DEEP, Nicholas Tomnay’s WHAT YOU WISH FOR, Yeva Strelnikova’s STAY ONLINE, Shigeyoshi Tsukahara’s KURAYUKABA, Zach Clark’s THE BECOMERS, Victor Ginzburg’s EMPIRE V, Olivier Godin’s IRLANDE CAHIER BLEU, John Rosman’s NEW LIFE, Mary Dauterman’s BOOGER, Mark H. Rapaport’s HIPPO, Hei-Yau Lin’s THE MOON, SKY AND YOU and RKSS’ WE ARE ZOMBIES.\n\n__________________________________\n\n- OUR INTERNATIONAL CO-PRODUCTION MARKET :\n\nIn 2012, Fantasia launched the Frontières International Co-Production Market as well as a film market component.
