        "text": "I have given the Truman Show a 4 star as the film could have been better. The reasons are that the climate and the atmosphere can be improved as the painting was a bit dull and the actors voices and acting could be improved on. On the other hand the camera angles and the thought behind it, is very broad minded. The angles of the cameras had a great role, such as : when the camera in the newspaper shop had the edges black. This made a effect of him getting recorded on a CCTV camera. I also loves the scenes at the end when the controllers rise the lever up to the danger zone. This is when it seems more likely to be a fake life in a real life. Also the EXIT door at the end makes it seem like it is a massive dome, but if you physically think about it, you already know that you have to act in this particular way and that is difficult. Overall the film was great and I enjoyed it."
