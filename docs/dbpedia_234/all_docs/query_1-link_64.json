        "text": "17-year-old Viola Zhou is the daughter of a director and that's the same direction she wants to go in.\n\nWednesday, the Grade 11 St. John​'​s​-Ravenscourt student took part in Freeze Frame's 19th annual International Film Festival for Kids of All Ages.\n\nShe likes all movies but ​it's the storytelling involved in documentary work that really attracts her.\n\n\"I feel like documentaries are a really nice way of spreading stories around and mainstream movies are less detail and less realistic,\" Zhou said. \"It's always nice to see what's out there.\"\n\nPascal Boutroy, Freeze Frame's artistic director, said th​is is the reason ​for his organization exists - to give kids an insight to what happens behind the scenes ​of film production ​and expose them to what is out there.\n\nEmpowering kids to be 'media savvy'\n\n\"It was always about empowering the kids, exposing them to different [things], and making them media savvy,\" Boutroy said. \"We want our kids to be broadminded, to understand what is going on in South Africa, to understand what's going on in Denmark, all kind of experiences in life. I think it's good for them and it's good for society in general.\"\n\n\"If you look at the media today, it's very based on stories that are told in moving images. Film is one of them, so teaching them about films is also about teaching the​m​ about the diversity of messages,\" Boutroy said. \"They have learned that when you edit one image close to another, you have made a decision, an editorial decision, that can twist the truth or not, so they become more savvy this way. They become a more critical watcher, and they'll be better at making decisions in their lives too.\"\n\nGimli Ice Festival provides backdrop for doc\n\nFor a class project they have to create a documentary about this weekend's Gimli Ice Festival. They have learned how to work a camera, and have developed interview skills, and video editing.\n\nThe exposure to the film industry led Thorkelson to develop an interest in directing and camera work.\n\nShe said documentary work isn't just about that - it's also about a team working together to create something out of just an idea.\n\nBoutroy also believes these kids are the future of the business and that it's important to get them interested in it now so they can gain the experience they need to excel at it in the future.\n\nFuture of Manitoba film industry at stake\n\n\"On a short term, it's certain that we are struggling to find crews in Manitoba, so we do need more people to get into the industry. Also, what's important with our workshop is that the kids learn to shape the messages, so if they are the kinds of kids that actually want to be filmmakers, they have a chance to learn that, to be exposed to that, and then they can push it further,\" Boutroy said.\n\nWitt has a split role in her high school production. She is editing and directing and although she is unsure if a future in film is for her, she knows the whole process of making a documentary is more than it seems and there's no denying how important documentaries are.\n\nThe films ​at the International Film Festival for Kids of All Ages ​are from all over the world​, including Denmark, South Africa, France, Norway, and Canada.\n\nThey will be screened ​to the public ​this weekend at 340 Provencher Blvd. Tickets are $6 and can be purchased at the door.\n\nSaturday's screenings start at 10 a.m. with the last film running at 2 p.m.\n\nSunday's films start at noon, with the closing ceremonies at 2:30 pm.\n\nLast year's festival was attended by close to 6,000 kids between the ages of 3 and 18."
