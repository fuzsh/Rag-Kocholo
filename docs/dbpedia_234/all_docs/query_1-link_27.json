        "text": "\"I'm going for the chain-smoking section,\" said Diesel as he reached our table. Before he could even finish asking if it was OK to smoke, his man appeared and delicately rolled from his hand a solitary gasper. \"Yes, you can smoke,\" the man said.\n\nNot knowing what Diesel was in the mood for, beverage-wise, his minders had thoughtfully provided an array of choices: a fruit juice, a coffee, a hot chocolate. Diesel was also presented with a silver platter of freshly made bruschetta. Having once proved his appetite to a reporter by stuffing an entire muffin in his mouth, this proved to be child's play for the bald, 180cm, muscle-bound star. \"I love Australia,\" Diesel chomped, looking out from the restaurant and on to the gleaming blue harbour. \"Look how f***ing beautiful it is. I'm amazed I don't have a place here. The thing is, it's hard to get away from America to come here for a weekend.\"\n\nYou sensed that if it could be done, Diesel would find a way to do it. The 35-year-old former nightclub bouncer, known to his family as Mark Vincent, has become a huge star in the space of two movies action-fests The Fast And The Furious and, currently, xXx. His asking price has skyrocketed to a reported $20 million. xXx is being viewed as a money-pit franchise with James Bond-like potential and he's even been discussing a remake of Guys And Dolls with, of all people, Nicole Kidman.\n\nJust at the moment you expect him to lean over and proclaim \"It's good to be the king\", he actually does. His man was back again, with an exotic, fruity concoction to add to the drink collection already on the table. Diesel took one sip. \"The king is happy again,\" he growled.\n\nIt was unlikely his sudden happiness was caused by a nip of something stronger from the bar. Diesel, you see, has had to give up alcohol. \"I had to stop drinking 31/2 years ago,\" he said. \"Because I'd be a prime candidate for ...\" He paused. \"I learned from Russell [Crowe]. Ha, ha. I'll stay out of that one. I got enough problems, you know what I mean?\n\n\"It was a conscious decision that happened after Pitch Black [the science-fiction movie he filmed in Australia a few years ago, now also being turned into a three-part franchise].\n\n\"What's so funny is the first time I came out here, I was still drinking and having a blast doing it but nobody really cared about what I was doing, so I could get drunk and have fun. Now, it's different. Now everyone cares a little too much and I can't get away with being drunk and being unaccountable for my drunken stupor. Not that I had any real problems drinking. But I'm less apt to be comfortable in public.\"\n\nAccording to Diesel, the new-found focus on his private life has been a considerable downside to the fame he has finally found since dreaming about being a movie star as a little kid doing amateur theatre in home town New York.\n\nWhile some gossip rags reported his meeting with Kidman about Guys And Dolls was in fact a romantic one \"I told her that was going to get written up,\" he smiled buzz on the internet has all but outed him as gay. And he makes no secret of the fact he despises the paparazzi.\n\nStill, there have to be some advantages like the money, for instance.\n\n\"I never see it,\" he said. \"It's a real fun thing to make money when you can't spend it. I always wanted to buy a Mercedes. Not really. I guess I always thought of it as a status symbol, so I bought my sister a Mercedes. My little brother and my parents, they go to Europe. They get to spend it. Something's off.\n\n\"My big splurge was I transformed a tennis court into an NBA basketball court at my house in LA and that was cool. But I don't know how to spend money because I never had it. I swear to God, if you've never had money and you get money, you still don't know what the f*** to do with it. You're so scared about spending money. The fact that this cranberry and club soda I'm drinking right now is free tickles me.\"\n\nDiesel spoke about what has happened to him with such wonder and surprise that you almost forget he was brought up by an astrologer mother. Surely, she must have seen it all coming.\n\n\"I got shafted,\" he boomed. \"My mother always said she couldn't do my chart because she was too close and she couldn't do one that was unbiased because of that. I never reaped the rewards of having an astrologically psychic mother.\n\n\"It's not fair. I've spent my life trying to rectify that injustice.\""
