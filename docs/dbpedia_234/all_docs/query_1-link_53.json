        "text": "Stephen Benedict Dyson\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n2 min read\n\n·\n\nSep 3, 2015\n\n--\n\nAlan Partridge is a fictional - nay mythical - character in British comedy, invented by Steve Coogan (Night at the Museum, Philomena). The Alan Partridge movie is a stand-alone story intended to introduce this gem of (fake) British broadcasting to a wider audience. Although you don’t need to know his life-story to enjoy the movie, here is a primer to the career of “the British Ron Burgundy.”\n\nAlan is a parody of a certain type of British media personality, lathered up with insincere bonhomie, un-hip figures who affect an avuncular style but, we suspect, are on the verge of losing control of their mouths, their television shows, and probably their personal lives. What’s really going on behind the carefully coiffed, made-up, and wardrobed facade of the welcoming host? Alan is going on.\n\nAlan is an example of the affluent conservative type common in rural Norfolk, a region of England famous for many activities such as farming. He holds the typically parochial beliefs of this kind of person: Britain is great, foreigners are awful, young people are out of hand, and he is cooler than them anyway. Conventional on the outside, Alan nonetheless maintains a vibrant inner dream-life.\n\nAlan values the ideal of the multi-talented media host. There is a universe out there in which Alan is a great singer, superb at monologues, a great sports reporter, and the host of a successful, long-running TV show. In our universe, however, Alan’s TV show was cancelled due to low ratings and a minor incident involving the on-air murder of a guest, and Alan now helms the radio show Mid-Morning Matters (a plea as much as a title) on North Norfolk Digital. Corporate raiders want to take over North Norfolk Digital, and rename it Shape: the way you want it to be. Despite being the station’s biggest name, Alan worries about his future. Shape is not how he wants it to be. He wants it to be an Alan Ascendancy. An Alan-ocracy. Instead, he is cornered and facing far superior forces. It’s worse than the Alamo. It’s the Alan-o.\n\nAlan worries period. And we worry that we are Alan, that we are all “a bit Partridge.” We think we are broadminded and have it together, but we secretly fear that we are ridiculous and on the verge of losing it. At a low point in his life, Alan had a breakdown, and drove bare-foot to Scotland whilst scarfing Toblerones. What we are really thinking is, a couple of bad breaks and that could be me."
