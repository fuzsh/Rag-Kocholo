        "text": "It's an epidemic. How many viral videos do we need to see before the live deaths of unarmed black men stop. What is it going to take before we all care asks Dr. Anthony Burrow a professor from Cornell University, a participant in the documentary that speaks to a time when he was profiled, with guns drawn. On September 13, 2013, unarmed Jonathan Ferrell was in a serious car accident after a night out with work colleagues. After knocking on the first door he came to in search for help, the home owner called 911 and reported a break-in. When police officers showed-up almost 20 minutes later, Jon stood waiting, looking relieved that help had arrived. Within 17 seconds Jonathan was tased, then shot at 12 times and hit ten times. This documentary shares an intimate story, beyond the headlines of a love story cut short. Unconscious Bias is real says Cache', who was Jon's high-school sweet-heart and fiancé, she makes the strong point illicit bias is glaringly in the Justice system and shreds the idea of stereotypes with behind the scenes footage of who Jon really was. Cache' s diverse family, the Heidel family all speak to their loss in the aftermath of a bias driven tragedy. The love-story is juxtaposed between college educated and upper middle class black men and boys that speak to their fear of the police, when doing absolutely nothing wrong. We must have this conversation, if this country is to ever be united. The Heidel family is the perfect family to deliver the message.\n\nGhost skin highlights the FBI's findings of white supremacy in the police force, questioning the roles of implicit and explicit bias considering unarmed black men are 5x more likely to be killed by police than whites of the same age. Ghost Skin, juxtaposes the intimate-raw story of Cache' Heidel, fiancé of Jonathan Ferrell, an unarmed man murdered by police officers in NC . heart felt interviews between middle class black college educated men, offering their personal experiences with policing in the land of their birth, while asking how do they survive in a world where they are feared and hunted by those that are suppose to protect them.\n\nStetson Kennedy waged a lifelong war against racial inequality, institutional segregation and social injustice. An audacious, determined, larger-than-life character, his daring actions demonstrate how one man bravely risked his life to transform the destiny of a nation. A privileged son of Southern heritage, a young Kennedy could not ignore the bigotry and intolerance around him. In the 1940's, he went undercover to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan and fed information to the producers of the nationally broadcast Superman radio show to expose the identities of their leaders. A prolific author, crusading journalist, tireless activist, early environmentalist and chronic womanizer, Kennedy was a wild man, not above embellishment or self-promotion, but his courage, his actions and his accomplishments made him a legend. KLANDESTINE MAN is his story.\n\nThe history of the iconic song \"Strange Fruit\" and how its incredible power, stemming from the horror of its lynching theme, Billie Holiday's tremendous rendering and its haunting melody, helped eradicate the practice of lynching in America. Over 4,0000 African-Americans were lynched from the late 19th century through World War II, yet lynching remained a taboo subject for White America. The song was a catalyst for the Civil Rights movement, and ignited a culture of protest in the music industry, inspiring artists such as Nina Simone. Both the song's author, Abel Meeropol, and its singer, Billie Holiday, cared so deeply about the heinous impact of lynching that they were willing to promote the song at great personal and professional risk, both ultimately suffering as a result.\n\nBreaking Bones, Breaking Barriers tells a story of diversity, inclusion, and the American dream. The film centers around the pioneer black stuntmen and women who broke racial, gender and economic barriers and opened doors to diversity in the stunt industry. The Black Stuntmen's Association was the first and only organization to fight for women and minorities in film and television when deep-seated racism and sexism penetrated every corner in America. Their struggle represents the broader picture of ongoing discrimination in every industry. Pulling back the curtain on Hollywood's most dangerous profession reveals an industry still marred by grievous discriminatory practices.\n\nAs the nation was gripped by the Watts riot and civil rights movement, An all-black basketball team in post-riot Compton, California was led by a white head coach called the John Wooden of high school basketball who transforms a team of athletes into living legends becoming the first team in California history to win 66 consecutive basketball games without a loss while becoming back-to-back undefeated State and National Champions. As National Champions they represented the city of Compton, the state of California and the nation. They faced racism and discrimination, and brutality on and off the court because of the color of their skin. 2019 marked the 50th anniversary of that historic accomplishment. Something that hasn't been done in over 50 years and may never be done again. The documentary Living Legends 66-0 tells the story of the longest winning record in California High School Basketball history, how it transformed the coaches and players lives and uplifted their communities. Those teams, players, and coaches became professional athletes, Hall of Fame coaches, college graduates, Olympians, teachers, veterans and elected officials but were left out of their rightful place in history."
