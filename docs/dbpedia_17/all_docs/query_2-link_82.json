        "text": "With the glow of legend, the names of the Dominican friar Servando Teresa de Mier, born in Monterrey, and Francisco Javier Mina, Spanish revolutionary, native of Navarra, appear in the history of Mexico, forever united. The first, punished by the high ecclesiastical hierarchy for his liberal ideas, was imprisoned in Spain for many years and then toured Europe, full of concern for the independence of his homeland. In England, Sa joined Mina, a high-flying guerrilla who had distinguished himself in the war against the French invaders and later against the corrupt Spanish monarchy. Together they marched to Mexico, where they arrived to sustain a dazzling campaign against the royalists in 1817. Mina was shot in the same year and remained a singular example of the solidarity of the best Spaniards of his time with the people of America eager for independence and freedom."
