        "text": "Amador Lugo Guadarrama Mexican artist\n\n0 0\n\nrank #2 ·\n\nAmador Lugo Guadarrama (April 12, 1921 – June 26, 2002) was a Mexican painter, graphic artist, writer and cultural promoter, best known for his landscape painting and the founding of several cultural institutions. He began painting when still a child, attending the Escuela al Aire Libre de Pintura in Taxco then developing his career in Mexico City. At that time, the Mexican muralism school was still dominant. Lugo related to its aesthetics but not so much to its politics, so he participated in the founding of various institutions such as the Sociedad Mexicana de Grabadores and the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana which provided opportunities for artists outside the dominant movement. He also worked as an educator, writer and cultural promoter, mostly in Mexico City and his home state of Guerrero.\n\nMexican male painters · 165T\n\n21st-century male artists · 1,869T\n\n20th-century printmakers · 391T\n\nFederico Cantú Garza Mexican artist\n\n0 0\n\nrank #4 ·\n\nFederico Heraclio Cantú Garza (March 3, 1907 – January 29, 1989) was a Mexican painter, engraver and sculptor. While considered to be a member of the Mexican muralism movement, his style was noticeably different, mostly for adhering to older and more academic forms of painting and sculpture. He had his most success exhibiting in the United States and Europe, but he did murals and sculptures in Mexico. His best known work is a sculpture called La maternidad which was adapted as the logo of the Instituto Mexicano de Seguro Social (IMSS).\n\nMexican male painters · 165T\n\n20th-century male artists · 3,569T\n\n20th-century printmakers · 391T"
