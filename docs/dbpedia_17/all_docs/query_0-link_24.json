We also want to bring to the reader's attention that the dimensions and impacts on health that IMSS has achieved, throughout its history, have strengthened the citizenship, as well as social sustainability. Also, those impacts have determined the creation and the reinforcement of human capital in MÃ©xico. Throughout this concise balance, all the controversy surrounding the foundation of the Institute is being recalled (the protest in the Mexico City ZÃ³calo, or the attack to an hospital in San Ãngel -a neighborhood located in the Southwest of Mexico City-), as well as the way the IMSS incorporated several words into the vocabulary of Mexicans. We also remember the previous antecedent of the Revista MÃ©dica del Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, as well as the Revista de EnfermerÃ­a, and the emblematic Archives of Medical Research. The IMSS has 70 years of achievements, seven decades covered.\n\nA Digital Divide?

Efectos paradÃ³jicos1\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMassey, Douglas S.; Pren, Karen A.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nResumen A finales de la dÃ©cada de los cincuenta, Estados Unidos permitÃ­a la entrada de aproximadamente medio millÃ³n de inmigrantes mexicanos al aÃ±o, de los cuales 450.000 entraban con visados de trabajo temporal y 50.000 llegaban con visados de residentes permanentes. A mediados de los aÃ±os sesenta, los cambios en la polÃ­tica migratoria de Estados Unidos realizados en nombre de los derechos civiles redujeron drÃ¡sticamente las oportunidades de entrada legal a Estados Unidos. Se eliminaron los visados de trabajo temporal y se limitaron los visados de residentes a 20.000 por aÃ±o. Con las oportunidades de entrada legal restringidas, los flujos migratorios ya establecidos simplemente continuaron, fuera de los lÃ­mites legales, dando comienzo a una inesperada reacciÃ³n en cadena de eventos que culminaron en una guerra total contra los inmigrantes y el rÃ¡pido crecimiento -sin precedentes- de poblaciÃ³n residente no autorizada en Estados Unidos. El presente artÃ­culo demuestra que el aumento de inmigraciÃ³n indocumentada en los Estados Unidos y el crecimiento de la poblaciÃ³n sin papeles son un producto de polÃ­ticas migratorias y fronterizas mal concebidas.

Thanks to the work and leadership of Benito Coquet, who initiated the building of the National Medical Center in 1961, and the work of two pillars of research, Luis Castelazo and Bernardo SepÃºlveda, the Institute successfully improved scientific research. In the years that followed, the Institute fostered the professionalization of research, the creation of research units in different areas of science, the incorporation of consolidated groups of researchers, the relationship with other institutions, the incorporation to the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores, the editing of a journal to expose outside the work done within the Institute, and the formation of a trust to raise funds for financing. Thanks to all that, institutional research strengthened in all lines, and it was placed first, at certain times, at the national level.\n\n[Strengths and future of the Revista MÃ©dica del Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social].\n\nPubMed\n\nFajardo-Dolci, GermÃ¡n\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe journals of medicine arose as a communication tool more than 200 years ago. At the beginning, their nature was local; later, their aim was to spread medical information along the nation; and, finally, they sought to reach the world distribution. The Revista MÃ©dica del Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social was published for the first time 52 years ago, and it has walked its way from local to international distribution. This journal has 23 000 subscribers, it is included in Medline and it reached a 0.112 SCImago Journal Rank in 2012. Its website receives around 200 000 visits monthly and 45 % are foreign visits. In the future, the peer review system is going to be strengthened, and the journal is going to offer audio, video, and applications to reinforce interactive participation between authors, readers in order to reach modernity and draw young new attention.\n\nMalignant tumors as cause of disability at the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social\n\nPubMed\n\nZitle-GarcÃ­a, Edgar JesÃºs; Sauceda-Valenzuela, Alma Lucila; Ascencio-Montiel, IvÃ¡n de JesÃºs; GarcÃ­a-Paredes, JesÃºs\n\n2018-01-01\n\nCancer represents an important issue in health, with the economic impact that it takes. The aim of this paper is to analyze the epidemiological characteristics of a population with social security who was diagnosed with some type of cancer and required a disability pension. Observational study, retrolective cohort type, carried out at the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS) with IMSS beneficiaries ruled with a state of disability due to malignancy during the period 2006 to 2012. 13 633 cases were studied, observing an increasing behavior among the years mentioned. The age average of the rightful claimants ruled was 47.75 years; the main causes of disability due to malignant tumors were breast, colon and brain cancer. The definitive opinions represented the 49.66%, which are likely to generate a constituent amount for the IMSS. It is important to have data of the survival in relation to the most frequent malignant tumors, which can provide information about the severity and prognosis of these diseases. The results obtained lead to discuss the effectiveness of programs established on the prevention and early detection of non-communicable diseases, mainly in breast cancer, since the impact that has this type of suffering may involve a major financial problem for the IMSS because of the payment of constituent amounts.\n\nUsing direct observations on multiple occasions to measure household food availability among low-income Mexicano residents in Texas colonias\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2010-01-01\n\nBackground It has been recognized that the availability of foods in the home are important to nutritional health, and may influence the dietary behavior of children, adolescents, and adults. It is therefore important to understand food choices in the context of the household setting. Considering their importance, the measurement of household food resources becomes critical. Because most studies use a single point of data collection to determine the types of foods that are present in the home, which can miss the change in availability within a month and when resources are not available, the primary objective of this pilot study was to examine the feasibility and value of conducting weekly in-home assessments of household food resources over the course of one month among low-income Mexicano families in Texas colonias. Methods We conducted five in-home household food inventories over a thirty-day period in a small convenience sample; determined the frequency that food items were present in the participating households; and compared a one-time measurement with multiple measurements. After the development and pre-testing of the 252-item culturally and linguistically- appropriate household food inventory instrument that used direct observation to determine the presence and amount of food and beverage items in the home (refrigerator, freezer, pantry, elsewhere), two trained promotoras recruited a convenience sample of 6 households; administered a baseline questionnaire (personal info, shopping habits, and food security); conducted 5 in-home assessments (7-day interval) over a 30-day period; and documented grocery shopping and other food-related activities within the previous week of each in-home assessment. All data were collected in Spanish. Descriptive statistics were calculated for mean and frequency of sample characteristics, food-related activities, food security, and the presence of individual food items. Due to the small sample size of the pilot data, the Friedman\n\n[Perception of undergraduate medical students of the educational environment at Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social].\n\nPubMed\n\nMorales-GÃ³mez, Antonio; Medina-Figueroa, Alda MarÃ­a\n\n2007-01-01\n\nTo ascertain the perception of third and fourth year medical students and interns (fifth year) about the educational environment during the clinical education phase and during the internship at Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS). A questionnaire with 120 items was developed to evaluate whether IMSS educational environment encourages reflection and criticism among medical students and interns. The highest possible score of the questionnaire was 240 points. A t test was used to compare the score of the students who were classified according to the term in which they were enrolled. 1997 medical students and 1075 interns from 46 IMSS clinical settings answered the previously validated questionnaire. Seventy percent of the students considered that the educational environment was not very favorable for reflection and criticism; 19% perceived it as favorable and 11% as unfavorable. The median score of third and fourth year medical students, was 134.9 (range 80-193; p = 0.27), interns' score was 130.4 (range 80-208; p = 0.001). The perception of the medical students in clinical settings other than Mexico City was less unfavourable (median 132.8; range 63.5-208); p = 0.003). apparently, the occupational environment influences the educational environments where the courses take place. As long as the students advance in their courses and get involved in clinical practice, their perception of the educational environment becomes unfavorable.\n\n[Costs and sick leave due to chikungunya in the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social in Guerrero, Mexico].\n\nPubMed\n\nVÃ¡zquez-Cruz, Irene; Juanico-Morales, Guillermina; SÃ¡nchez-Ramos, Apolinar; Morales-SÃ¡nchez, Ofelia de JesÃºis\n\n2018-01-01\n\nChikungunya fever (CHIK) generally causes temporary sick leave, affecting groups of productive age, which represents a significant economic impact from the labor point of view. The objective was to estimate costs of disability due to chikungunya in the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS) in Guerrero, Mexico. Cost assessment of working population from IMSS in Guerrero who met the definition of case for CHIK and took sick leave, which was registered in the Original Disability Certificates (OCI, according to its initials in Spanish) processed from January to April, 2015. Paid sick days were multiplied by the current minimum wage of the municipality of Acapulco (geographical area A, general = $ 70.10: seventy pesos with 10 cents per day]). Of all the OCIs, 31.5% (38 271/12 062) met the criteria for CHIK with a total of 41 197 prescribed days and 14 941 paid sick days with an estimated cost of 2 397 393.40 pesos (two million, three hundred and ninety seven thousand, three hundred and ninety three dollars and forty cents). Sick leaves increase the costs in health systems. These costs increase as increases the number of days granted. The average number of days granted is consistent with the information published in different articles.\n\n[Experience in training in emergencies, Division of Special Projects in Health, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social].\n\nPubMed\n\nCruz-Vega, Felipe; LorÃ­a-Castellanos, Jorge; HernÃ¡ndez-Olivas, Irma Patricia; Franco-Bey, RubÃ©n; Ochoa-Avila, CÃ©sar; SÃ¡nchez-Badillo, Victoria\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThere has been interest in the Division of Special Projects in Health to offer the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social personnel resources for training and quality thereby respond to potential contingencies. Presented here is their experience in this field. To describe and analyse the productivity in different training programs in emergencies and disasters developed by the Division of Special Projects in Health, Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS). Observational study in which different training activities conducted by the Division of Special Projects in Health between 1989 and 2014 are described. Descriptive statistics were used. In these 25 years have trained 20,674 participants; 19.451 IMSS and 1,223 other health institutions. The most productive courses were life support (BLS/ACLS) (47.17%), distance courses \"Hospital medical evacuation plans and units\" (14.17%), the workshop-run \"Evacuation of hospital units with an emphasis on critical areas\" (5.93%) and course \"Programme Evaluators of Hospital Insurance\" (8.43%). Although the Special Projects Division Health has primarily operational functions, it nevertheless has neglected its responsibility to maintain constantly trained and updated institute staff that every day is in a position to face any type of emergency and disaster. This increases the chance that the answer to any contingency is more organised and of higher quality, always to the benefit of the population. Copyright Â© 2015 Academia Mexicana de CirugÃ­a A.C.

The aim of this study was to estimate the costs and effectiveness of five antipsychotic treatments (ziprasidone, olanzapine, risperidone, haloperidol and clozapine), which are included in the national formulary at the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, through a simulation model. Type of economic evaluation: complete economic evaluation of cost-effectiveness. direct medical costs. 1 year. Effectiveness measure: number of months free of psychotic symptoms. to estimate cost-effectiveness, a Markov model was constructed and a Monte Carlo simulation was carried out. Effectiveness: the results of the Markov model showed that the antipsychotic with the highest number months free of psychotic symptoms was ziprasidone (mean 9.2 months). The median annual costs for patients using ziprasidone included in the hypothetical cohort was 194,766.6 Mexican pesos (MXP) (95% CI, 26,515.6-363,017.6 MXP), with an exchange rate of 1 â¬ = 17.36 MXP. The highest costs in the probabilistic analysis were estimated for clozapine treatment (260,236.9 MXP). Through a probabilistic analysis, ziprasidone showed the lowest costs and the highest number of months free of psychotic symptoms and was also the most costeffective antipsychotic observed in acceptability curves and net monetary benefits.

Factors associated with immigrantsâ access to, and use of, healthcare were sex, urban/rural status, education and country of origin. Conclusion There were significant associations between SES, and access to and use of healthcare among immigrants in Chile and a higher prevalence of no health care provision entitlement among poor and disabled immigrants compared to the Chilean-born. Changing associations between access and use of healthcare and SES among immigrants in Chile over time may reflect changes in their socio-demographic composition or in the survey methodology between 2006 and 2009. Resumen IntroducciÃ³n La evidencia internacional indica menor acceso y uso de servicios de salud por parte de inmigrantes, pero sus factores desencadenantes varÃ­an significativamente dependiendo del contexto. Algunas investigaciones se han desarrollado en este tema en AmÃ©rica Latina, desde una perspectiva cualitativa. Este estudio cuantitativo explorÃ³ el auto-reporte de acceso y uso de servicios de salud de inmigrantes en Chile y los comparÃ³ con la poblaciÃ³n chilena. MÃ©todos AnÃ¡lisis secundario de datos de encuesta nacional CASEN 2006 y 2009. Inmigrantes fueron comparados con chilenos en caracterÃ­sticas demogrÃ¡ficas (edad, sexo, urbano/rural, composiciÃ³n del hogar, etnia), estatus socioeconÃ³mico (educaciÃ³n, ingreso, situaciÃ³n contractual), tipo de previsiÃ³n (pÃºblica, privada, otra, ninguna), y uso de varios servicios de atenciÃ³n primaria.

Genotype data from 30 microsatellites were used to assess the genetic diversity and relationships among five Cuban cattle breeds (Siboney de Cuba, Criollo Cubano, CebÃº Cubano, MambÃ­ de Cuba and TaÃ­no de Cuba). All microsatellite markers were highly polymorphic in all the breeds. The expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.67 Â± 0.02 in the TaÃ­no de Cuba breed to 0.75 Â± 0.02 in the MambÃ­ de Cuba breed, and the observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.66 Â± 0.03 in the CebÃº Cubano breed to 0.73 Â± 0.02 in the Siboney de Cuba breed. The genetic differentiation between the breeds was significant (p < 0.01) based on the infinitesimal model (F(ST)). The exact test for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium within breeds showed a significant deviation in each breed (p < 0.0003) for one or more loci. The genetic distance and structure analysis showed that a significant amount of genetic variation is maintained in the local cattle population and that all breeds studied could be considered genetically distinct. The Siboney de Cuba and MambÃ­ de Cuba breeds seem to be the most genetically related among the studied five breeds.

Methods The Registry of Cancer in Children, started in 1996 in the IMSS-MC, is an on-going, prospective register. The data from 1996 through 2001 were analyzed and the different types of cancer were grouped according to the International Classification for Cancer in Children (ICCC). From this analysis, the general and specific frequencies by age and by sex were obtained for the different groups of neoplasms. Also, the frequency of the stage of the disease that had been diagnosed in cases of children with solid tumors was obtained. Results A total of 1,702 new cases of children with cancer were registered, with the male/female ratio at 1.1/1. Leukemias had the highest frequency with 784 cases (46.1%) and, of these, acute lymphoblastic leukemias were the most prevalent with 614 cases (78.3%). Thereafter, in descending order of frequency, were tumors of the central nervous system (CNST) with 197 cases (11.6%), lymphomas with 194 cases (11.4%), germinal cell tumors with 110 cases (6.5%), and bone tumors with 97 cases (5.7%). The highest frequency of cancer was found in the group of one to four year-olds that had 627 cases (36.8%). In all the age groups, leukemias were the most frequent. In the present work, the frequency of Hodgkin's disease (~4%) was found to be lower than that (~10%) in previous studies and the frequency of tumors of the sympathetic nervous system was low (2.3%). Of those cases of solid tumors for which the stage of the disease had been determined, 66.9% were diagnosed as being Stage III or IV. Conclusions The principal cancers in the children treated in the IMSS-MC were leukemias, CNST, and lymphomas, consistent with those reported by developed countries.

In general, nurses exhibit negative attitudes towards Moroccan patients, such as: the increase in crime is caused by the arrival of immigrants, those who commit offenses must be expelled from Spain, they take advantage of the Spanish health system and too many resources are devoted to immigration. The worst-rated immigrants are the Moroccans, considering that they do not pay much attention to their personal hygiene and do not adapt to their host countries. It is necessary to work with the nursing staff to change these attitudes. Future degree students must be trained in cultural skills and the care of immigrants will improve with a greater commitment towards cultural differences. Conocer la actitud de enfermerÃ­a del Hospital de Melilla hacia los pacientes marroquÃ­es. Estudio ex post facto descriptivo. Se ha pasado un cuestionario de Escala de Actitud ante la InmigraciÃ³n para EnfermerÃ­a. En general las enfermeras presentan actitudes negativas ante los pacientes marroquÃ­es, como: el aumento de la delincuencia es provocado por la llegada de inmigrantes, los que delinquen deben ser expulsados de EspaÃ±a, se aprovechan del sistema sanitario y se dedican demasiados recursos para la inmigraciÃ³n. Los inmigrantes peores valorados son los marroquÃ­es, considerando que son pocos cuidadosos con su higiene personal y no se adaptan a los paÃ­ses de acogida. Es necesario trabajar con el personal de enfermerÃ­a para que cambien estas actitudes. Las futuras promociones de Grado deben estar formadas en competencias culturales y mejorarÃ¡n los cuidados a los inmigrantes como un mayor compromiso con la diferencia cultural.\n\nCost-effectiveness analysis for joint pain treatment in patients with osteoarthritis treated at the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS): Comparison of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) vs. cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors.\n\nPubMed\n\nContreras-HernÃ¡ndez, Iris; Mould-Quevedo, JoaquÃ­n F; Torres-GonzÃ¡lez, RubÃ©n; Goycochea-Robles, MarÃ­a Victoria; Pacheco-DomÃ­nguez, Reyna Lizette; SÃ¡nchez-GarcÃ­a, Sergio; MejÃ­a-ArangurÃ©, Juan Manuel; GarduÃ±o-Espinosa, Juan\n\n2008-11-12\n\nOsteoarthritis (OA) is one of the main causes of disability worldwide, especially in persons >55 years of age. Currently, controversy remains about the best therapeutic alternative for this disease when evaluated from a cost-effectiveness viewpoint. For Social Security Institutions in developing countries, it is very important to assess what drugs may decrease the subsequent use of medical care resources, considering their adverse events that are known to have a significant increase in medical care costs of patients with OA. Three treatment alternatives were compared: celecoxib (200 mg twice daily), non-selective NSAIDs (naproxen, 500 mg twice daily; diclofenac, 100 mg twice daily; and piroxicam, 20 mg/day) and acetaminophen, 1000 mg twice daily. The aim of this study was to identify the most cost-effective first-choice pharmacological treatment for the control of joint pain secondary to OA in patients treated at the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS). A cost-effectiveness assessment was carried out. A systematic review of the literature was performed to obtain transition probabilities. In order to evaluate analysis robustness, one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Estimations were done for a 6-month period. Treatment demonstrating the best cost-effectiveness results [lowest cost-effectiveness ratio $17.5 pesos/patient ($1.75 USD)] was celecoxib. According to the one-way sensitivity analysis, celecoxib would need to markedly decrease its effectiveness in order for it to not be the optimal treatment option. In the probabilistic analysis, both in the construction of the acceptability curves and in the estimation of net economic benefits, the most cost-effective option was celecoxib. From a Mexican institutional perspective and probably in other Social Security Institutions in similar developing countries, the most cost-effective option for treatment of knee and/or hip OA would be celecoxib.\n\nCost-effectiveness analysis for joint pain treatment in patients with osteoarthritis treated at the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS): Comparison of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) vs. cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors\n\nPubMed Central\n\nContreras-HernÃ¡ndez, Iris; Mould-Quevedo, JoaquÃ­n F; Torres-GonzÃ¡lez, RubÃ©n; Goycochea-Robles, MarÃ­a Victoria; Pacheco-DomÃ­nguez, Reyna Lizette; SÃ¡nchez-GarcÃ­a, Sergio; MejÃ­a-ArangurÃ©, Juan Manuel; GarduÃ±o-Espinosa, Juan\n\n2008-01-01\n\nBackground Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the main causes of disability worldwide, especially in persons >55 years of age.

The emergence and progress of a different concept and practice of teaching made possible the creation of the Institutional Teaching Career at the end of 2004. This achievement represents the acknowledgement of teaching practice, making possible the permanence, self-improvement and promotion of those professors truly committed to a teaching practice of greater importance at IMSS. The theoretical perspective that conceptually frames this career as well as the different categories of career professor implies an idea of education, as well as a teaching and improvement practice concept of health assistance that outlines a way in search of the perfection of both occupations (teaching and assistance) at the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, with growing repercussions in its influence sphere.\n\nLegalistic and Personalistic Adaptations to Ethnic Conflict in a Texas School\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nFoley, Douglas E.\n\n1976-01-01\n\nIn attempts to reduce conflict between Mexicano and Anglo high School students, administrators tended to use legalistic modes while most teachers relied upon personalistic strategies.

The exact composition of the immunotherapy concentrate, with which the patient is treated, depends partly on the results of the skin prick tests applied to the allergic patient. As such, the effectiveness of the immunotherapy depends heavily on the quality of the skin prick test. The detailed recommendations for the realization of the skin prick tests have evolved and changed over the years, leading to multiple variations in its application in Mexico. We tried to get a picture of the daily practice patterns of the members of CMICA and CoMPedIA concerning the application of skin prick tests. Aquestionnaire was sent in various occasions to all members of the Colegio Mexicano de Inmunologia Clinica y Alergia (CMICA) and of the Colegio Mexicano de Pediatras, Especialistas en Inmunologia y Alergia (CoMPedIA). The results are presented descriptively and by calculation of the frequency/percentages of intervals of replies, in the case of numerical responses. A response rate of 61 (17%) was obtained of the College members, showing consistency in some replies but a wide variation in others, for example in the time certain medication has to be suspended before the execution of the skin prick test. Comparing the replies obtained with recent recommendations in international publications, some discrepancy can be detected. In some aspects of the survey there is coincidence of the skin test practices among the participants; however, in other items there is an important variation.\n\n[Practice patterns in Mexican allergologists about specific immunotherapy with allergens].\n\nPubMed\n\nLarenas Linnemann, DÃ©sirÃ©e; Guidos Fogelbach, Guillermo Arturo; Arias Cruz, Alfredo\n\n2008-01-01\n\nImmunotherapy has been practiced since over a hundred years. Since the first applications up today changes have occurred in the preparation, dose and duration of the treatment, as well as in the extracts used. Guidelines have been published in Mexico and other countries to try to unify these practice patterns of immunotherapy. By means of a questionnaire, sent in various occasions to all members of the Colegio Mexicano de InmunologÃ­a ClÃ­nica y Alergia (CMICA) and of the Colegio Mexicano de Pediatras, Especialistas en InmunologÃ­a y Alergia (CoMPedIA) we tried to get a picture of the daily practice patterns of immunotherapy in the allergist's office. Results will be presented in a descriptive manner. A response rate of 61 (17%) was obtained from the College members. For immunotherapy allergists use locally made and imported extracts, generally mixed in their office (20% over 10 allergens in one bottle). Eighty percent adds bacterial vaccine at some point and 60% uses sublingual immunotherapy. Most use Evans without albumin as diluent, don't routinely premedicate, reach maintenance treatment after more than six months and 46% recommends a maximum duration of immunotherapy of two years or less. We present a diagnosis on the current situation of practice patterns concerning allergen immunotherapy among the members of both Mexican colleges of allergists. The methods used by the allergists for indication, preparation and administration are quite diverse.\n\n[Epidemiologic behavior of malignant digestive tract tumors over a five year period in Veracruz, Mexico].\n\nPubMed\n\nRoesch-Dietlen, F; JimÃ©nez-GarcÃ­a, V A; Remes-Troche, J M; Rubio-Arce, J F; LÃ³pez-Salinas, A; Ruiz-JuÃ¡rez, I; Grube-Pagola, P; Silva-CaÃ±etas, C F\n\n2012-01-01\n\nTumors of the digestive system are considered to be a public health problem because of their elevated mortality rate. In Mexico, gastric cancer and colon cancer rank fourth and fifth, respectively, following tracheal, bronchial, and lung cancer, and there has been an increase in their frequency in the last few years. However, there are no specific studies that have evaluated their epidemiologic behavior in Veracruz. To determine the frequency of digestive system cancer in five health institutions in the city of Veracruz and to describe its epidemiologic behavior over a five-year period. Annual statistics from the following hospitals were reviewed: the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, the SecretarÃ­a de Salud, the Instituto de Seguridad y Servicios Sociales de los Trabajadores del Estado, PetrÃ³leos Mexicanos, and the SecretarÃ­a de la Defensa Nacional within the time frame of January 2005 to December 2009. Diagnoses based on histopathology were recorded, along with patient age and sex. A total of 1803 cases of digestive tract cancers were detected: 52% were men and 48% were women. A yearly increase in the number of cases was observed with colon cancer being in first place, followed by stomach cancer and rectal cancer. The increase in digestive system cancer cases over the last five years in Veracruz underlines the need to evaluate the implementation of screening programs for the at-risk population and to study the different etiologic factors involved in its manifestation.\n\nSeizures, cysticercosis and rural-to-urban migration: the PERU MIGRANT study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGonzales, Isidro; Miranda, J Jaime; Rodriguez, Silvia; Vargas, Victor; Cjuno, Alfredo; Smeeth, Liam; Gonzalez, Armando E; Tsang, Victor C W; Gilman, Robert H; Garcia, Hector H\n\n2015-01-01\n\nÃ©quences neurologiques de l'infection par la cysticercose sont susceptibles de survivre Ã la rÃ©ponse d'anticorps durant des annÃ©es aprÃ¨s la migration des zones rurales vers les zones urbaines.

Umbilical cord blood (UCB) has proved to be a viable source of hematopoietic stem cells for transplantation purposes. The aim was to report the contribution of the umbilical cord blood bank over the past 9 years, in the treatment of various diseases. Since 2005 the number of units of blood from the umbilical cord and their use for transplantation in diverse disease were analyzed. A selection of volunteer pregnant women in labor was performed. Umbilical cord blood was obtained from them, which underwent processing, cryopreservation and validation, as well as compatibility test before using for transplantation. Ten thousand and ninety nine candidates to donation were assessed, from whom 2481 unit of UCB were collected. Of these, 893 unit were processed and cryopreserved for transplantation. In 65% of cases there was histocompatibility between the cord cell and the receptors. Transplantation was done in 87 patients, 67% had hematologic neoplasias, who have received 140 units of UCB in 102 transplants. This Bank of UCB ranks second in the world in productivity according to the rate of utility of units in transplantation (3.3%). Our bank of UCB has been able to develop a cell line (hematopoietic stem cells) with international quality standards and has been beneficial for patients served by our institution with need of a transplant mainly in hemato-oncologic patients.\n\nMexico City's Petroleos Mexicanos explosion: disaster management and air medical transport.\n\nPubMed\n\nUrquieta, Emmanuel; Varon, Joseph\n\n2014-01-01\n\nMexico City is the largest metropolitan area in the Americas and 1 of the largest in the world; its geographic location and uncontrolled population and industrial growth make this metropolis prone to natural and human-made disasters.

The results are presented descriptively and the frequency is calculated by which certain allergen is tested in the interviewed practices. A survey response rate of 61 (17%) was obtained and 54% showed their SPT content. Weeds' representation in the SPT seems adequate; Atriplex is tested in all allergy practices. Some trees that show cross-reactivity might be eliminated from the SPT, but 20% doesn't test for Cynodon nor Holcus, and 25% doesn't for important allergens as cat, dog and cockroach. House dust and tobacco are still tested with certain frequency.

Patterns and sources of Hispanic diversity in U.S. metropolitan areas.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Barrett A; Martin, Michael J R; Hall, Matthew\n\n2017-11-01\n\nRapid Hispanic growth has been a major source of increasing ethnoracial diversity in the United States. However, diversity within the Hispanic population is frequently obscured by the tendency to lump all Latinos together. Our study examines Hispanic diversity at the local level, drawing insights from the Mexican dominance, Caribbean-centric settlement, spatial assimilation, and economic opportunity perspectives. Measures of the magnitude and structure of Hispanic origin-group diversity during the 1990-2010 period are constructed for 363 metropolitan areas based on each area's shares of Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans, Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Colombians, and 'others'. We find that diversity magnitude varies markedly across metropolitan Hispanic populations. Although the most diverse metro areas lack a majority origin group, Mexicans often constitute a majority or plurality of local Latinos. Diversity levels and structures have remained relatively stable over time. In both 1990 and 2010, metro areas with more diverse, multigroup Hispanic communities are distinguished by their larger size, smaller proportion of Hispanics, location farther from Mexico and closer to the Caribbean, and greater odds of being a military hub. They also exhibit higher rates of housing construction and lower rates of agricultural and manufacturing employment. We use weighted data to show that Dominican metro dwellers experience the highest Hispanic diversity while the average Mexican lives in an area where four-fifths of all Latinos are Mexican. Overall, our results provide primary support for the Mexican dominance perspective but some support for the other three perspectives as well. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Geophysical exploration companies under contracts with Pemex carried out gravity anomaly surveys that were referred to different floating data. Each survey comprises observations of gravity stations along highways, roads and trails at intervals of about 500 m. At present, 265 separate gravimeter surveys that cover 60% of the Mexican territory (mainly in the oil producing regions of Mexico) are available. This gravity database represents the largest, highest spatial resolution information, and consequently has been used in the geophysical data compilations for the Mexico and North America gravity anomaly maps. Regional integration of gravimeter surveys generates gradients and spurious anomalies in the Bouguer anomaly maps at the boundaries of the connected surveys due to the different gravity base stations utilized. The main objective of this study is to refer all gravimeter surveys from Pemex to a single new first-order gravity base station network, in order to eliminate problems of gradients and spurious anomalies. A second objective is to establish a network of permanent gravity base stations (BGP), referred to a single base from the World Gravity System. Four regional loops of BGP covering eight States of Mexico were established to support the tie of local gravity base stations from each of the gravimeter surveys located in the vicinity of these loops. The third objective is to add the gravity constants, measured and calculated, for each of the 265 gravimeter surveys to their corresponding files in the Pemex and Instituto Mexicano del Petroleo database. The gravity base used as the common datum is the station SILAG 9135-49 (Latin American System of Gravity) located in the National Observatory of Tacubaya in Mexico City. We present the results of the installation of a new gravity base network in northeastern Mexico, reference of the 43 gravimeter surveys\n\n[Lower incidence of severe damage to target organs in mexican patients with systemic sclerosis and diffuse skin affection].\n\nPubMed\n\nRojas-Serrano, Jorge; Codina-VelÃ¡squez, Helga; Medrano-RamÃ­rez, Gabriel; Abraham SimÃ³n, J; Vera-Lastra, Olga; VÃ¡zquez-Mellado, Janitzia\n\n2008-01-01\n\nTo determine the cumulative incidence of severe organ involvement in Mexican patients with systemic sclerosis (SS) and diffuse scleroderma at 3 years from the onset of SS symptoms, and to compare itwith the cumulative incidence observed in a cohort of white patients with SS.

Review.\n\nPubMed\n\nChiganer, Edson HernÃ¡n; Hryb, Javier Pablo; Carnero Contentti, Edgar\n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects multiple systems. Myelopathy is one of 19 neuropsychiatric syndromes related to SLE defined by the American College of Rheumatology. Although infrequent, it is a severe manifestation, leading to motor and sensory deficits, and sphincter dysfunction. The pathogenesis is not clearly known, but may be related to arterial thrombosis and vasculitis. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings, laboratory tests and the use of gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. The standard therapy is the combination of intravenous cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids. In refractory disease, other treatments such as plasmapheresis or rituximab have been used.

We studied 97 patients divided into five groups: rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis, gout, chondrocalcinosis and osteoarthritis, exploring six elementary lesions in 194 Achilles entheses examined. In our study the total index ultrasonographic Achilles is higher in spondyloarthritis with significant differences. The worst elementary spondyloarthritis lesions for discriminations against other pathologies were calcification. This study aims to demonstrate the discriminant validity of Achilles enthesitis observed by ultrasound in spondyloarthritis compared with other rheumatic diseases that may also have ultrasound abnormalities such enthesis level.

There is a clear increasing tendency for the coming years. The available data indicates a higher frequency and increased demand of women. Higher number of patients is observed between 40 and 59 years old. However, earlier age groups present considerable amount of cases. Having the number of patients allows knowing the average of consultations per patient, this parameter allows having an estimate of the follow up by the physician and it must be part of the evaluation of the medical attention programs. Diabetes mellitus is strongly associated with obesity, this condition affects a high percentage of diabetic patients in the Institution and weight loss must be encouraged.\n\nSystemic Sclerosis Sine Scleroderma in Mexican Patients. Case Reports.\n\nPubMed\n\nVera-Lastra, Olga; Sauceda-Casas, Christian Alexis; DomÃ­nguez, MarÃ­a Del Pilar Cruz; Alvarez, Sergio Alberto Mendoza; Sepulceda-Delgado, JesÃºs\n\n2017-01-03\n\nSystemic sclerosis sine scleroderma (ssSSc) is a form of systemic sclerosis that is characterized by Raynaud's phenomenon (RP), visceral involvement without thickening of skin and anticentromere antibodies (ACA). We studied 10 ssSsc patients with a prevalence of 2%. The clinical signs were: RP 9/10, esophageal manifestations 8/10, pulmonary arterial hypertension 4/10, interstitial lung disease 4/10, cardiac signs 3/10 and ACA 8/10. In patients with RP, esophageal dysmotility, interstitial lung disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension should be tested for ACA in order to establish a prompt diagnosis and treatment of ssSSc.

Front District, with headquarters in Reynosa. By cementing with turbulent flow, Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) has increased to nearly 90% the success ratio of casing cementing. In the same general area, due to hydraulic fracturing, gas fields which before were considered marginal, have become good producers. The fracturing jobs must be well-planned and well-executed. The results in these Eocene formations show considerable variance, from good to extraordinary. The results show a low productivity ofmoreÂ Â» increase of 66.3% and a high productivity of 326%, following frac treatment. Graphical representations show cementing with turbulent flow; and the effect of fracturing.Â«Â less\n\nHPV vaccination syndrome: A clinical mirage, or a new tragic fibromyalgia model.\n\nPubMed\n\nMartÃ­nez-LavÃ­n, Manuel\n\n2018-03-13\n\nIndependent investigators have described the onset of a chronic painful dysautonomic syndrome soon after human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. The veracity of this syndrome is hotly debated. Many of the reported post-HPV vaccination cases fullfill fibromyalgia diagnostic criteria. This article discusses the arguments favoring the existence of a syndrome associated to HPV vaccination. We propose that fibromyalgia dysautonomic-neuropathic model could help in the diagnostic and therapeutic process in those patients in whom the onset of a painful chronic illness began after HPV immunization. On the other hand, if its veracity is corroborated, HPV vaccination syndrome may become a new tragic fibromyalgia model.
