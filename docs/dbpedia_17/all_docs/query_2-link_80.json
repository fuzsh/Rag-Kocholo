        "text": "“We control the grapes from the vineyard in order to guarantee the highest quality”. All generations of the Cavas Blancher family have adhered to this philosophy, adopted by our founder, ANTONIO CAPDEVILA PUJOL.\n\nWe consider controlling the vineyards essential – it allows us to certify the quality and production of the grapes. For this reason, we control the entire vineyard process, from planting through production. We vinify in separate parcels (terroirs), so that our products are fully traceable.\n\nFor many years, more than 90% of our harvests come from the same vineyards, so we can guarantee the quality of our products and ensure a consistent taste.\n\nAll the grapes used to produce our wines and cavas have been pressed and fermented in our winery in the center of Sant Sadurni d’Anoia, where we use modern equipment and production techniques.\n\nOur grapes are harvested when they reach optimal maturation, beginning in mid-August and ending in September. We harvest only the best grapes after a careful inspection in each vineyard, and ensure that only those in perfect condition reach the winery. The harvest is transported in small capacity stainless steel trailers, to ensure the grapes’ quality is not damaged.\n\nWe use a pneumatic press at low pressure to ensure a better and higher quality first must, perfect for producing excellent wines and cavas. The must is then fermented in stainless steel tanks with a maximum capacity of 15,000 liters, at a temperature of 16 degrees Celsius. (Controlled fermentation)\n\nAt the end of the year we prepare our first cupages (blends of different types of wine), to create a taste and quality faithful to the handmade essence that has characterized Blancher wines and cavas throughout the years.\n\nOnce we create the cupages, we add sugar and yeasts, and begin bottling the wine, which undergoes a second fermentation in our cellars, located 16 meters deep, at a temperature of 16 to 19 degrees Celsius, ideal for this type of fermentation. Bottling typically occurs in February and March, once we determine our wines have reached the perfect texture to produce an excellent cava.\n\nPeace, darkness, and the optimal ambient temperature of our cellars ensure that bottles of wines and cavas Blancher are aged in the right environment. Our bottles are placed in the traditional rimas or riddling racks, and are inspected periodically to monitor their evolution until the right moment for commercialization.\n\nRiddling is performed manually over the course of approximately three weeks, with daily rotation and elevation of each bottle, which allows the sediments to settle in the neck, to facilitate its eventual extraction.\n\nWe use the best and newest disgorging techniques, after which the corresponding expedition liquor is added (a secret formula transmitted from generation to generation). Finally, the bottles are corked and labeled to be sold.\n\nAll of our cavas are aged a minimum of 18 months and an average of 30, to obtain the Reserve or Grand Reserve designations certified by the D.O. Cava.\n\nBoth white and red wines are produced with D.O. Penedés varietals. Red wines are aged a minimum eight months in French and American oak barrels.\n\nFrom the moment our grapes are harvested to the disgorging of the cava or bottling of the wine, a period of at least two years has passed. Our goal is that our family’s hard work and knowledge pays off with a bottle of wine or cava you thoroughly enjoy."
