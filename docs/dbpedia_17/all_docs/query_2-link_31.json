In this six-year period, he was able to realize the popular demands expressed in the Mexican Revolution that began with the fall of the dictator Porfirio Díaz, and to rally his people behind a program which carried out agrarian reform, with the accelerated break-up of the great haciendas and their re-assembly into collective “ejidos” run by the farmers, the expansion of the network of schools around a socially oriented curriculum, the systematic encouragement of cooperative production through the establishment of credit banks, the fostering of the workers’ drive towards greater unity in the labor movement, the transference of railroad management to the railroad workers themselves, the foundation of the Talleres Gráficos de la Nación (National Printing Shop)—the most important publishing house in the hands of the workers—, and finally, in the decree of March 1938, the bold expropriation of all foreign oil companies in the greater interests of the nation. In the international field, Mexico started the flow of arms to the heroic defenders of the Spanish Republic—the first burnt offering of fascism in Europe—and was the first to give them asylum.\n\nThis social and economic transformation catalyzed the Mexican people into mighty farmers’ and workers’ unions for the defense and advancement of their Revolution’s aims. The effort to unify the workers’ movement gave birth to the Mexican Federation of Labor (CTM), established in 1937 under the leadership of its first executive secretary, Vicente Lombardo Toledano, and opened the way for the creation of the Latin American Federation of Labor (CTAL) in 1938. There can be no doubt that Cárdenas created an atmosphere conducive to a re-formation of the culture and structure of Mexican society which, in turn, gave fresh impetus to the arts.\n\nIt was at this time that Mexico’s progressive intellectuals formed the League of Revolutionary Writers and Artists (LEAR, 1933–1938) in order to depict the socialist desires of the people in type, paint and ink. Here it was that artists first found a way to collaborate by means of fresco-paintings, and when, after heated disagreements, the LEAR was dissolved in 1937, they decided to establish a new center for the graphic arts, to be known as the Workshop for Popular Graphic Art (TGP), which would serve the progressive movements of Mexico. The charter members, led by Leopoldo Méndez, Luis Arenal and Pablo O’Higgins and encouraged by David Alfaro Siqueiros, were Ignacio Aguirre, Raúl Anguiano, Ángel Bracho, Jesús Escobedo, Everardo Ramírez, Antonio Pujol, Gonzalo de la Paz Pérez and Alfredo Zalce, and soon their circle comprised sixteen. In their midst stood a lithographic press boasting the label “Paris, 1871,” which is said to have served the Paris “Commune.” This press, witness to a venerable tradition, was more effective in banding together the artists than any theoretical program. A three-room studio of about 500 square feet, entered from a dim court in which the lithographic stones were prepared, was located at Belisario Domínguez No. 69, in the old quarter of Santo Domingo. The space was divided into an exhibition and sales-room, a studio with individually lit desks, and a machine-room containing the mechanical press and a hand-press for lithographs and other types of printing. The monthly rent came to 50 pesos, or about 14.00 Dls. (American money), and the landlady filled the patio with her imprecations if she did not receive it on time, which was the case rather often.\n\nWhile the typically 19th Century life of the workers’ quarter circulated in the street outside, inside, artists and machinery began to move. Their work at once became an outlet for the manifold stimulus of the daily needs and sometimes harsh truths of Mexican life. It reflects the people’s views on current issues in domestic and foreign policy, their hunger for bread and for knowledge, their fight for land and freedom: “Tierra y Libertad! ” All production has been critically reviewed by the whole circle of artists from the start, and has always been characterized by the absence of abstract techniques, which would not be understood by the masses. The usual art “isms” and cliches are missing here, and the objectives to which each member is bound are as simple as can be. There is room for every point of view save fascism.\n\nIn 1937 the first poster appears: an illustrated felicitation to the newly founded Federation of Workers of Mexico (CTM). The first caricatures deal with the expropriation of the oil fields in 1938. Three illustrated popular calendars come out of a joint project for the Workers’ University (UOM). Hundreds of rural schoolteachers were assassinated in the course of [the] “Cristero” movement; the TGP strikes back in a portfolio of seven lithographs entitled, “In the Name of Christ ” (pp. 232–239). A little later, L. Méndez, R. Anguiano, X. Guerrero and L. Arenal transfix the spectre of Franco Spain on stone; this portfolio of twelve prints, “The Spain of Franco ” (pp. 214–231), is the first to show up fascism in Europe. In the fall of 1938 the walls of the capital display the first of a series of eight pointed cartoons in two-color lithograph, keyed to the eight weekly lectures of the “Liga pro Cultura Alemana” against Nazism. In the spring of 1939 a second poster campaign was undertaken: eight lithographs condemning “El Fascismo,” with a run of 2,000 each, or a total of 32,000 posters in sixteen short weeks. Most romantic of all, the artists themselves, working night and day, turned to, and printed their lithographs in their “Paris Commune press.” In the meantime, the first backdrops for popular assemblies employing color sketches several times life-size in scale with the hall were carried out as team projects. The largest of these paper hangings, for the Palace of Fine Arts, measure 12 × 8 meters (about 40 × 28 feet). All the while a constant stream of thousands of lithographed handbills is pouring out among the people. Witty “corridos ” (topical songs) and biting “calaveras ” (what might be called Skeletons’ Follies or Dances of the Dead) caricature the exploiters, the machine politicians, the oil-trusts and false, selfmade (!) “Revolutionaries.” These footnotes to the news are often, as the favorite Mexican tradition has it, laid in the hereafter, where the actors on today’s public scene may be found performing as skeletons.\n\nIn Mexico, where half the population is still all but illiterate, the cartoon, understood by all, is the best medium of communication and of resistance to man’s humanity. It may be accusing, as in Callot’s “Misères de la Guerre,” devastating, as Goya’s “Caprichos,” critical of society as a sketch of Daumier’s, illuminating as the “Images d’Epinal,” or all of these together, as in the newspaper cuts of the Mexican master of popular graphic art, José Guadalupe Posada\n\nThe artistic heritage of our artists and their utilization of it is deeply rooted. Although the relationship of their graphic expression to the pre-Hispanic past lies more in feeling than in form, the present-day black-and-white art would not exist without the collective spirit of those ancient Indian arts, and without this spirit there could be no TGP! Again and again, the Indian subconscious emerges in their best work. For instance, there is Ángel Bracho, who blends a vague melancholy with sparkling, elusive whimsy. Take Leopoldo Méndez, who sometimes will use a restrained symbolism to illustrate an idea for the man-in-the-street. Or take José Chávez Morado, whose acid critique of society is shot through with diabolic fantasy. Again, there is Francisco Mora, whose figures are distorted in a quite natural manner resembling the primitive Indian clay figurines. And above all, there is the profound sadness of their race, which pervades the fine engravings of Everardo Ramírez, the Indian from the Pedregal of Coyoacán. The simplified and symbolical presentation of current events is often reminiscent of the old Códices which, be it noted, were not hieroglyphs for the priests and the initiated alone, but were meant to be read and understood by all—just as are the best prints of the TGP.\n\nWhile certain ideas are rendered in the preHispanic spirit, others, particularly when critical of the milieu or narrative, remind one, rather, of the “retablos ”—those primitive paintings that the faithful offer to the Virgin Mary in testimonial of miraculous rescue from accident or disease. Such a story is reproduced with crude literalness and in the harsh local color of the physical and social setting— just as the true TGP artist likes to do.\n\nWhile searching for the precursors of popular graphic art, our artists rediscovered their spiritual forebears, whose pens and brushes recorded and accompanied the struggle for freedom in the first century of Mexico’s existence as a state, 1810 to 1910. It is the century which opened with Father Hidalgo’s shout of independence, “El Grito de la Independencia,” which saw Don Benito Juárez (1806–1872) unite the nation of Mexico and defeat the French invasion, which drew to a close in thirty years of agony under the dictator Porfirio Díaz, who drowned the people’s cry for “Tierra y Libertad!” in the blood of forced labor, mass murder, and execution, of potential leadership, and which ended in the eruption of the Mexican Revolution. Our artists leafed through the periodicals of the liberal and anti-clerical movements of the day: “La Orquesta,” “El Ahuizote ” and “El Hijo del Ahuizote,” and through the output of publisher Antonio Vanegas Arroyo which is bursting with the peppery sketches of Hernández, Villasana, Escalante, Manilla and of the greatest of them all, José Guadalupe Posada (1852–1913). The foundation of the magazines “EI Machete ” in 1923 and of “El Libertador ” already belongs to the period of the Mexican Revolution. These two graphic arenas of the Revolution are where the revolutionary artists of today first formed a nucleus and fought their way towards a realistic and aggressive graphic expression appropriate to the times.\n\nOf the living old masters of Mexican art, none has had as strong an influence on the artists of the TGP as José Clemente Orozco. This admirer of the “Pulquería” (bar) murals, who became so important to both Mexican fresco-painting and drawing indirectly guided the way to the groping search for the creation of the TGP’s own style, and, although he never worked in the TGP himself, he set the pace for most [of] its members by the example of his plastic style, the wealth of his imagination, his apocalyptic power, his genuinely revolutionary and revolutionizing temperament, and by the universal value of his art.\n\nIn 1937, during the establishment of the TGP, L. Méndez and P. O’Higgins formed a friendship with the old master-lithographer Jesús Arteaga, who pulled lithographs for José Clemente Orozco and Julio Castellanos and who represented the best tradition of his craft in Mexico. It was in his humble workshop in the then red-light district of the Calle Cuauhtemotzín that the first lithographs of the TGP were printed. From him our artists learned the basic techniques of lithography, and from him came the tips on economy of operation. One day, after the lithographic presses has been installed in Belisario Domínguez No. 69, the young worker-lithographer, José Sánchez walked in, and “José” had [sic] been the link between the artists and the stones and presses ever since. His prints reveal high technical ability, a skilled hand, and a talent for the interpretation of each artist’s desires.\n\nIn the search of [sic] faster and cheaper duplication methods, our members increasingly came to prefer the linoleum cut for every day use. Really good wood blocks are hard to find and hard to finance. Big lithograph stones are scarce, so posters of large format are generally cut in linoleum. Leopoldo Méndez has the following professional comments to make about these technical developments:\n\nFrom the moment that the camera turned its glass eye on the field occupied by the graphic professions, hand-engraving lost much of its original purpose. Nonetheless and in spite of this phenomenon, artists all over the world, using the same technical base, but exploiting new tools and material wherever possible, continue to practice the several branches of engraving. Pablo Picasso etches, Siqueiros draws lithographs, José Clemente Orozco does both, Alfredo Zalce works in every branch of graphics. . . . Incredible that such intelligent men should ignore progress!” one might exclaim. But no, the issue is a very different one, and, the explanation, in my opinion, will be simple to anyone with an open mind.\n\nEngraving was largely a technical profession, but was also and still is an art. Engraving as art is simply, like painting, a direct medium of expression. The hack professional engraver left us hundreds of thousands of illustrations of machines and cientific [sic] apparatus, of birds and insects, all executed in impeccable technique, exactly portrayed—and devoid of the smallest breath of life. Motionless machinery, desiccated fauna. The engraver who was also an artist, on the other hand, left us a living man set in his living space and time. He captured the very light of his time; he left us its palpitating matter.\n\nWe welcome the appearance of the photomechanical process of graphic reproduction because it releases the artisan from the thankless chore of copying that which he does not care about and has not created. Creation is a desire inborn in man. The true artist has always been one whose senses were all awake; he creates with his mind, his eyes, his hands—with his whole being. Because of this, art is a direct expression of the whole man. It is this and nothing less which differentiates an engraving of Posada’s from a cut in a scientific textbook. Clearly, then, artists have continued to see engraving as a direct means of expressing their art. Nothing mechanical remains; when looking at their work, one cannot doubt that they have put all their emotion into its execution. Would ‘The Disasters of War’ or ‘The Lies and Delusions of Franco’ have been possible if the technical possibilities of the medium which even allowed the interpretation of color values had been underrated? Would the incomparably magnificent quality of Alfredo Zalce’s engraving been attained?\n\nBut engraving holds in itself a property with a high strategic function in the political and social scene, and that is the fact that it can be reproduced. This has given the engraving its well-earned fighting reputation of the past and present which will be multiplied in the future when machines serve art and not vice versa; that is to say, when the infantile bewilderment at the machine-age has passed and the men who run the machines do so to satisfy actual cultural and material needs. In spite of the confusion from which we suffer, in spite of the imperialistic character of production, in spite of patent monopoly, this new day is already dawning.\n\nAmong all the TGP’s dreams, one has stood out: that of having a completely equipped offset press at our disposal, so that we might explore its possibilities in the course of our work. We want a good one, but have not the funds to acquire it and set up the enterprise. Without good equipment and a good operating organization, the task is multiplied a hundred-fold. This does not imply, however, that we will quietly retreat and paint portraits to the taste of ladies and gentlemen who would pay well for them, nor that we’ll pause, bedazzled by the manifold facets of abstract art. Our work will never be of use to owners of the reactionary press who would like to drape themselves in the (invisible) mantle of culture, nor will critics find it a convenient filler for the column left empty because articles and news were thrown into the ashcan lest they displease the honorable ladies and gentlemen. Our protest against fascism—fomenter of wars, enemy of the people—is not so easily hushed!\n\nThe outbreak of World War II in 1939 multiplied the activities of the TGP also: illustrations for the anti-fascist press, backdrops for rallies, graphic exhibitions against the Nazi terror, etc. Under the slogan, “Mexico’s first line of defense is on the Soviet front,” a broadly conceived poster campaign was spread throughout the country. In order to defray the cost of each series of 5,000 posters, we sold a special edition of 200 copies on good paper to sympathizers. For the “Libro Negro del Terror Nazi” (The Black Book of Nazi Terror), ten members sketched a series of 32 indictments, and Robert Mallary lithographed a poster for the AntiTerror Exhibition. The rally which massed in the “Zócalo,” the capital’s central square to listen to the President’s Declaration of War on the Axis in June, 1942, was greeted by the TGF’s allegorical floats, and the war’s end was hailed by Bracho’s poster, “Victoria” and A. Zalce’s graphic announcement of the official victory celebration.\n\nA more peaceful period began for all. Zalce flew to Yucatán, returning soon with studies for his portfolio, “Prints of Yucatan,”—a master work of contemporary lithography.\n\nBefore discussing the current output of the TGP, we should draw up the critical balance-sheet of our production in recent years. Without doubt, the TGP has demonstrated its vitality in the hard field on the side of the people. In spite of the disorganization of the inner politics of Mexico’s revolutionary and leftwing circles, it has always proved possible to unite members and sympathizers around immediate, central tasks. The more projects we can work out together, the stronger and more active the TGP will become!\n\nIn the meantime, the series of “85 Prints of the Mexican Revolution” (pp. 262–301) was undertaken by a group of sixteen artists and, under the strict supervision of all concerned, was completed in two years. Of the total edition of 550 portfolios and 46,750 prints, 2/3 were sold within a year. 10% were presented to progressive cultural organizations all over the world—Capetown [sic],\n\nThe Workshop for Popular Graphic Art: A Record of Twelve Years of Collective Work (Mexico City, La Estampa Mexicana, 1949)\n\n“Art for the people: Murals in a rural school of Michoacán (Photo: Mayo)”\n\n“The new site of the TGP: Netzahualcoyotl 9, 2nd floor, Mexico, D. F. (Photo: M. Yampolsky)”\n\n“Mexico’s old master lithographer Jesús Arteaga († 1948) with (at left) P. O’Higgins and (at right) L. Méndez (Photo: Jules Heller)”\n\n“TGP artists on a sketching trip in the Valley of Mexico, 1949. (Left to right) J. Escobedo, P. O’Higgins, R. Berdecio, L. Bergner, R. Anguiano, L. Méndez, H. Meyer (Photo: R. Berdecio)”\n\n“Hannes Meyer, architect-urbanist, with his son Mario (Photo: R. Berdecio)”\n\nBuenos Aires, Jerusalem, Montreal, Moscow, New York, Lisbon, Berlin, Geneva—. In spite of the differences in quality in the work of the sixteen artists, the collection is firmly held together by a common technique—22 × 30 cm, linoleum cut—and a common patriotic and revolutionary spirit. A wealth of emotion—heroic, lyrical, passionate; cruel, cynical, criminal—, distinguishes it.\n\nThe campaign for literacy, begun in the spring of 1944 under the direction of the Minister of Education, and the concurrent program of school-building—over 700 schools inside of three years, costing 60,000,000 pesos—afforded new opportunities for collectively practiced art; all sixteen active artists took part in the illustration of a big “Memoria, C.A.P.F.C.E. 1944–1946,” a record of the accomplishments of the National School Construction Board) and later, in the design of individual primers (“cartillas ”) which were given mass distribution by the Department of Public Education (SEP).\n\nThere are many signs of the TGP’s desire to extend the field of graphic action. Individual artists had long taken part in the so-called “cultural missions,” which the SEP sends out to the remotest Indian minority groups of Mexico for such varied projects as painting a mural in the school or studying the folklore of the region. Alberto Beltrán, for one, joined several anthropological expeditions whose latest fruit is a book about the Totzil Indian, “Juan Pérez Jolote” by Ricardo Pozas A., enlived [sic] by Beltrán’s scholarly illustrations. A TGP member and expert archeologist, Agustín Villagra Caleti, and a colleague from Guatemala were the first to copy, and to copy extremely well, the famous Mayan frescoes of Bonampak, discovered in 1947 in the jungle of Chiapas. Apropos of the UNESCO Conference in Mexico in the fall of 1947, Leopoldo Méndez first showed his “engravings,” enlarged to a height of 7.50 meters (about 50 feet) which were used as murals and backdrops in the Assembly Hall. Since then, in collaboration with the screen photographer Gabriel Figueroa, he has brought his graphic art to the scale of the motion picture screen in two series of ten engravings each for the films “Río Escondido” (1948) and “Pueblerina” (1949).\n\nFor years, the TGP has been haunted by the idea of superseding the single, fixed fresco by a “composite-mural” which could be put together piece by piece and reproduced in color by means of silkscreen. Such murals could then be sold at a low price to schools, “ejidos,” workers’ and farmers’ organizations.\n\nAmong the most recent attempts at widening the field of action must be counted the scripts for 32-mm. educational films on social themes, which are worked out in collaboration with the Bryant Foundation in Los Angeles, Cal., including also the 1948 documentary on the TGP itself.\n\nObjectively, however, we must admit that, with the exception of the “calaveras,” fliers and primers, we have not yet been able to produce really cheap popular editions of our graphic work. Another difficulty is the lack of an efficient distribution system. One step on the way to popularization was taken in 1948 by the wide distribution of a selection of graphic art by means of 24,000 postcards arranged in 4 series of 12 cards each. The government official organ, “El Nacional,” daily for three months at the beginning of 1949 published a print from the portfolio of the “Mexican Revolution,” and thus did much to promote its distribution. Truly popular editions, however, of our picture-book series which would have such outstanding educational value for rural schoolteachers, ejidos and unions are still checked by our economic weakness.\n\nEven now, after twelve years of operation, the arrangement of the studio is as simple as can be. A cut for a new street forced the TGP out of its rooms in Belisario Dominguez No. 69 and in the fall of 1948, after one stop-over in Calle Regina No. 114 and another in Calle Quintana Roo No. 127, the TGP moved into its present well-lit quarter of 180 square meters (about 2,000 square feet) on the second floor of the business building at Netzahualcóyotl No. 9. The old mechanical press has been dismantled, end an excellent handpress with manual control for engravings and proofs of all kinds up to 58 × 68 cm, stands next to the handpress for lithographs. The dream of an offset press of our own has long since evaporated. Experience has taught that it is best for the TGP to have its work mechanically reproduced at a well equipped press, under the direct supervision of a TGP representative. The typographically and artistically outstanding “Incidentes Melódicos del Mundo Irracional,” (p. 176) a very fine book by Juan de la Cabada, was produced in this manner\n\nThe Workshop for Popular Graphic Art: A Record of Twelve Years of Collective Work (Mexico City, La Estampa Mexicana, 1949) in the Talleres Gráficos de la Nación, under the eye of the illustrator, L. Méndez, and in the Book Fair of 1945 it was awarded first prize as “the best illustrated book of Mexico.”\n\nAll TGP publications that have appeared since 1947 were produced in the press of the medium sized publishing house, Editorial “Galatea,” under the technical guidance of Hannes Meyer, supported by the enthusiasm of the organized employees and by the understanding cooperation of the owner, Sr. Higinio Arias Urzay. This method of production seems to us at the present time the most natural and economical one. Skillful, individually controlled printing of linoleum and woodcuts on the mechanical vertical press, “Victoria,” achieve a higher standard than the old hand-pulled prints with all the accidents so highly prized by the collector. This new method, however, calls for a fresh approach to popular graphic arts which will deliberately discard the 18th Century and reevaluate the social role of the art of today.\n\nThe TGP’s mastery of graphic technique cannot be fully understood without reference to the fraternal guidance of [a] certain foreign guest—the Czech master of graphic arts, Koloman Sokol. The US couple Max Kahn and Coney Cohen of Chicago, experts in all fields of graphics, Jean Charlot, who drew the gaily colored lithographs of his “Mexihkanantli” on stone in our workrooms in 1947, and Albe Steiner, graphic artist from Milan. The Swiss couple, Hannes Meyer and Léna Bergner, put their talents for organization and their technical and artistic experience to work for the TGP and are responsible for the relatively high quality of the design and representation of our last publications.\n\nExamination of the TGP’ s social structure quickly reveals the central bond: poverty forces the artists to join in the use of the indispensable technical installations and of the space, light and quiet so many lack at home. The workshop offers them all these and, in addition, their colleagues’ experience and helpful criticism. A new generation is being fostered that no longer desires to wait alone in a corner for inspiration.\n\nIn the course of its twelve years of existence, the TGP has had 26 active members and approximately as many guests, so that the circle of affiliated artists comprises 50. The number active at any one time is remarkably constant: a nucleus of twelve to fifteen has always been on hand to continue the normal activity of the workshop. Another striking fact is that almost all of the nine founders of the TGP are still with it. It is equally striking that most of the active members stem from the lower classes: L. Méndez’ father was a shoemaker, A. Zalce’s a photographer, F. Mora’s a band musician, I. Ocampo’s a lighthousekeeper. Many are rooted in indian [sic] peasant stock on their mothers’ side. Several made detours before turning to graphic art. A. Bracho was a hairdresser, ticketseller and butcher’s helper. Monroy was a lacquerer in a furniture factory. A. Pujol herded his father’s sheep. E. Ramírez, a pure-blooded Indian, still lives in the self-same hut on the lava deposit of Coyoacán where he was born. At the age of fifteen Ignacio Aguirre fought in the army of Venustiano Carranza against Pancho Villa and fought again, when he was twenty under Alvaro Obregón. For the rest, however, the Mexican Revolution was but an impression of their youth.\n\nAlmost all of the members of the TGP, insofar as they have had any artistic schooling at all, received it either at the San Carlos Academy or at the national art school, “La Esmeralda,” in Mexico City. Few have the specific training as graphic artists L. Méndez, A. Zalce and I. Ocampo have; in this field, the majority are self-taught. They have picked up the tricks of the trade from each other in the daily give-and-take, and have, by joint effort and under the review of all achieved technical and artistic command over the graphic representation of everyday life. No mannerisms, no formalisms, no castration of individual creative power! A glance at the comparative tables of graphic techniques . . . shows the full variety of personal expression in the works of the TGP.\n\nAll the members need the income from the joint sale of their work, for the salaries which most of them earn as drawing teachers, etc., in the public schools are miserable: 90-120-150 pesos a month (about $19-25-37 US 1946). The economic relationship between, the workshop and the artist has been gradually adjusted so that upon the sale of loose prints 1/3 goes to the TGP and 2/3 to him. The compiler of a portfolio receives 20% of the gross income after deduction of the dealer’s discount of 33%, and then 33% of the net after expenses. The workshop treasury keeps 20% of the net on commissions, e.g. posters or illustrations, whether entrusted to an individual or to a team. The TGP, in trying harder than ever to improve the material position of its members, is doing the best thing for its own reinforcement, because, along with the opportunity for ideological and technical development, the financial help induces the individual artist to work cooperatively.\n\nIt is significant that up to now the TGP has existed as a free association without legal form. There have been repeated efforts from the very beginning to put the organization on a formal basis, but in vain: the stark poverty of the members sets a limit to their contribution and the unpredictable demands of the day are apt to overrule all bylaws. In the end, organization rested on recognition by all the members of a “Declaration of Principles.” The fully democratic weekly membership meeting makes all major decisions regarding jobs, commissions, elections, finances, etc., and a three-man executive board— the technical manager, treasurer and export manager, each with an alternate, and assisted by the lithographer José.\n\nOrdinarily a special team is set up under its own foreman for each job. This team is subject to review by a full membership meeting which will rule on the main proposals. From then on the team is on its own: It turns out the job, confers with the client, buys materials, divides the commission, and, at the end, hands 20% of the net over into the treasury.\n\nFrom 1937 to 1939 the TGP displayed its prints and paintings in a little art gallery under the direction of the photographer Josefina Vollmar. From 1943 to 1946 the TGP employed an ideal administrator in the person of George Stibi, a German political refugee who won the members’ confidence by his understanding work with the TGP and its publishing house. Since the beginning of 1947 the publishing house, “La Estampa Mexicana,” has been an economically independent organ under the technical direction of Hannes Meyer. It is administered by a committee of three, on which the TGP is represented by Leopoldo Méndez. The Estampa handles all editions of the TGP and their distribution, accounts with clients and artists, the publicity (in part) and the assembling of exhibitions to go abroad. The sale of individual prints remains the business of the TGP. The list of publications during the 2½ years from Jan. 1, 1947 to June 30, 1949 is as follows:\n\nTotal Volume: 1,500 copies of lithographs; 24,000 postcards; 61,375 copies of engravings.\n\nTotal Net Value: $87,550 pesos.\n\nThe Estampa has also built up a “fototeca,” a file of photographs of the best works of all the TGP artists for use in publicity releases and by others interested. At the present time there are about 700 photographs recording the format, medium and Spanish-English title of each work under an index-number for easy filing and preparation of exhibitions.\n\nThe TGP is no longer alone in its determined fight for survival and growth; it is constantly being reinforced by new friends from progressive circles at home and abroad. In 1945 the Association of American Artists (AAA) published a portfolio of 12 lithographs by ten artists, in effect an ode to Mexican labor, entitled “The Mexican People.” There are large collections of TGP prints in the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Museum of Western Art in Moscow, and a very comprehensive one in the National Museum in Mexico City. In addition to exhibitions in Mexico City and the provinces there have recently been others in Buenos Aires (1948), New York (1946), Boston (1947), Chicago (1946), San Francisco (1947), Los Angeles (1948) and Hollywood (1949). A large “Traveling Exhibition of the TGP ” was sent to Poland and Czechoslovakia by government invitation. Gratifying though this is, the members of the TGP are pleased most especially by the attempts of their former guests to found similar workshops at home in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Portland (O[regon]). Imitation is indeed “the sincerest flattery”!\n\nEpilogue\n\nThe question of the TGP’s future is in practice identical with that of the Mexican nation and of the revolutionary forces within. An art that is true to the life of the people is inseparably bound to their destiny. Mexico, along with the other Latin American countries is exposed to economic and cultural invasion from their “good neighbor” to the north. 80% of Mexico’s trade is with the United States.\n\nThis is a threat to the Mexican national economy on all fronts, to industry, education and art—to the entire achievements of the Mexican Revolution, in short. The very existence of the type of life-reflecting art that has found a home in the TGP, and is one of the people’s weapons, is perforce also in danger. What use can world imperialism have for an art that would inspect Wall Street’s evil exports—race-hatred and antiSemitism, ignorance and bigotry, war-mongering and the atom bomb? The amount of gold and surrealist painting that has turned up in fashionable 42nd Street, in New York, “displaced” by the war, is surely significant. Hailed as the sum and end-all of Art, mistical [sic] and abstract form has been used to camouflage social injustice and existentialism has been made to furnish the artificial fog. The TGP has nonetheless seen through them, and has drawn what it sees.\n\nOn the basis of the TGP’s twelve years experience, it seems advisable to continue to preserve its organic unity and economic independence in the future. The current confusion in all of revolutionary Mexico—seven distinct workers’ and farmers’ central organizations and three national parties, all laying claim to the label, “Revolutionary”!—make it especially hard just now for the artist to orient himself. In view of this, the TGP cooperative should strengthen its own (and always voluntary!) inner discipline and do all it can to offer technical and financial help to each member. And every member should learn there to master the common technical problems of graphic art! This calls for the development of the TGP into a training shop where the artist can expect to receive methodical instruction in place of the now mostly haphazard interchange of experience. The occasional conspicuous neglect of workmanship in execution must be replaced by the slogan, “Every lithographer back to his stone! ” Everyone should be capable of supervising the execution of his designs, the format, type, paper, composition and the printing itself—only then will crudity give way to craftsmanship.\n\nThe TGP is to be praised for its stand to date, well oriented in spite of the bewildering times and for the great popular art that it has developed in close relationship with mighty popular organizations in the face of the social conflicts from which Mexico suffers. It has made an invaluable contribution to realistic art of this type everywhere."
