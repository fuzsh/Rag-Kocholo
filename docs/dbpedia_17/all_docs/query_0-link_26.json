It has been scrutinized from multiple perspectives—as an incipient ethnography, a literary work, a dictionary, a historical record, and a theological reflection—and found to be all of these and more. Created by the Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahagún and his indigenous collaborators, the document records two languages, features over two thousand images, and engages a broad range of fundamental questions, including those of authorship, literacy (both verbal and visual), intercultural dialogue, and historical memory. The Florentine Codex occupies a prominent nexus between the pre-­ Hispanic past and the New Spanish colonial present and, as such, opens up a fertile space to investigate the various epistemic systems that met, intermingled, and clashed in sixteenth-­century Mexico. Until recently, studies of the manuscript focused on the very important task of translating and comprehending the bilingual texts. We acknowledge our collective debt to the illustrious scholars who have gone before us and share our appreciation for this magnificent illuminated manuscript. Breaking new ground, the authors in this collection of essays direct their critical analyses to the images of the Florentine Codex: their pictorial sources, their material components, and their correspondence with the accompanying narratives. In resituating the paintings within their textual matrix and a Nahua-­ Christian context, this volume as a whole complicates a Eurocentric understanding of the images and foregrounds the roles and agency of their indigenous makers.\n\nThe impetus for this volume began with a two-­day conference, “Visual and Textual Dialogues in Colonial Mexico and Europe: The Florentine Codex,” held in 2015 at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the Getty Center. The meeting convened a group of scholars from Mexico, Europe, and the United States to examine the interrelation of the manuscript’s three “texts”: the Nahuatl and Spanish alphabetic texts and the hand-­painted images. Taken together, both words and pictures offer a rich body of evidence for interdisciplinary investigation, as well as a springboard for larger questions. The conference was followed six months later by an informal workshop held at the Getty Research Institute. The dialogue generated by this workshop highlighted the need for a publication dedicated to our new interpretative perspective on the Florentine Codex. We are grateful for the participation of the invited scholars, whose thought-­provoking papers were subsequently expanded and refined into the essays found in this volume. Additionally, we acknowledge the contributions of the discussants at the 2015 conference, Kim Richter, Cecelia F. Klein, and Daniela Bleichmar. For so generously hosting and facilitating these meetings, the editors would like to express their special thanks to Barbara Fuchs, then director of the Center for Seventeenth- and Eighteenth-­Century Studies and the UCLA William Andrews Clark Memorial Library, and to Thomas W. Gaehtgens and Kim Richter, then director and associate director of the Getty Research Institute at the Getty Center. We also acknowledge the assistance of Sue Kang, Nathaniel Deines, Sally McKay, Lisa Camvii\n\nbier, and Mahsa Hatam at the Getty, and Jeanette LaVere, Kathy Sanchez, and Erich Bollman at UCLA. We are grateful to other research centers at UCLA that cosponsored the conference: the Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, the Center for Mexican Studies, and the Latin American Institute. We owe a great debt to the warm reception and cooperation of the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana, where the Florentine Codex is housed. Ida Giovanna Rao, the director of the library until December of 2017, made the original three-­volume Florentine Codex accessible for research and waived the costs of publishing its images. Our thanks also to Anna Rita Fantoni, the Laurenziana’s current director, for supporting this generous arrangement, and to the Getty Research Institute for allowing us to incorporate into this volume both images and related text from their superb digital copy of the Florentine Codex. We thank Christopher DiMatteo for his expert translation of Italian in chapter 2, and Rebecca Dufendach for collating and editing our bibliography. We are grateful to Helen Deutsch, current director of the UCLA Center for Seventeenth- and Eighteenth-­Century Studies and the Clark Library, for cosponsoring this publication with a generous subvention, and to the UCLA Latin American Institute for the same. We are especially grateful to\n\nviii • Preface and Acknowledgments\n\nKerry E. Webb, senior acquisitions editor, and the staff at the University of Texas Press. Note to readers: The editors acknowledge that the alphabetic spelling of some Nahuatl words can vary from one scholar and one chapter to the next. As one example, the name of the Aztec ruler at the time of the conquest can be spelled Moctezuma, Moteuczoma, or Motecuhzoma. Recognizing the complexity of the cultural terms “Aztec” and “Nahua,” in this volume the name Aztec is generally applied to precontact peoples who flourished in central Mexico and, by conquest or negotiation, received tribute from many communities of Mesoamerica. Specifically, those who lived in the island cities on Lake Texcoco, Mexico-­Tenochtitlan, and Tlatelolco, were also referred to as the Mexica. More current is our use of the term Nahuas for those peoples who spoke, and continue to speak, the language of Nahuatl. On the pagination of the Florentine Codex, we have followed throughout the folio numbers internally sequential within each book, found in the upper right-­hand corner (recto and verso). The exception to this practice is in the pagination of the first twelve folios of Book 1, in which the only page numbers are those for volume 1 found in the lower right-­hand corner of each folio (recto and verso).\n\nThe\n\nFLORENTINE CODEX\n\nFigure I.1.

They worked inside the cloistered walls of the Colegio de Santa Cruz in Santiago Tlatelolco while family, friends, and some of their own group succumbed to disease. Writing during the virulent epidemic of 1576, Sahagún recalled an earlier plague of 1545, when he claimed to have buried more than ten thousand corpses before he himself fell ill and nearly died. “There is hardly anyone still in the college,” he lamented. “Dead and sick, almost all are gone.”1 Sahagún blamed the two epidemics for the decline of the colegio. The Franciscan colegio in Tlatelolco, a Mexica community just north of neighboring Tenochtitlan and on the same island in the lake of the Basin of Mexico, was the first European college in the Americas. The Holy Cross College was founded on January 6, 1536, to educate Nahua youth, primarily but not exclusively the sons of Nahua elites. The Franciscans offered a basic humanities curriculum, teaching the neophytes how to read and write in Nahuatl, Spanish, and Latin; the trivium and the quadrivium; and elements of the Christian doctrine. The college possessed an extensive library to support these endeavors. By the second half of the sixteenth century, Tlatelolco had become a center of Franciscan learning and humanist education in New Spain.\n\nBut by the 1570s, Sahagún had seen the “whole land . . . depleted of people” with his very own eyes.2 He feared that the Indians were destined for extinction, to be replaced forever by Spaniards and their descendants.3 A striking image in Book 12 of the Florentine Codex depicts victims of the first outbreak of smallpox, after the Spaniards were expelled from Tenochtitlan in 1520 (fig. I.1). A woman attends to the sick, who lie suffering on petates, or reed mats. The Nahuatl text says that the epidemic lasted a full sixty days before it moved toward the south, and “the Mexica warriors were greatly weakened by it.”4 The epidemic of 1576 struck in August; Sahagún penned the prologues and interpolations in November of that year. To describe the devastation wrought by war and disease on the indigenous peoples of New Spain, he recalled the words of an Old Testament prophecy. In the prologue to Book 1 he compares the war of 1520–1521 to the curse which Jeremiah, in the name of God, thundered upon Judea and Jerusalem in the fifth chapter, saying: “I will cause to come upon you, I will bring against you a people from afar, a very vigorous and brave people, a very ancient people skilled in battle, a people whose language you will not understand, . . . all powerful and courageous people, lusting to kill. This people will destroy you and your women and children and everything you possess, and will destroy all your villages and buildings.” This has literally happened to these Indians by way of the Spaniards.5\n\n1\n\nThe Florentine Codex took shape amid the chaos of conquest, disease, and consolidation of imperial power in Mexico, the culmination of decades of meticulous gathering and recording of knowledge about Nahua culture. As soon as the bilingual manuscript was completed, the final version in a series of works collectively referred to as the Historia general (or universal), it was whisked away to Spain. In March 1578, Sahagún wrote a letter to the Spanish king, humbly inquiring whether his majesty had seen the books that had taken three decades to complete.6 By this time, fray Bernardino was approaching eighty years of age and wrote with a trembling hand. He would never know of the work’s final destination or fate. Table I.1 provides a timeline for the manuscript’s production.\n\nThe Manuscript This volume presents studies generated by our 2015 conference on the Florentine Codex that address issues raised by the internal dynamics of the manuscript, its “three texts,” and their external implications. The questions we initially explored, and herein pursue in writing, we hope will promote greater understanding of the relationship of the bilingual texts to the relevant imagery, with an emphasis on the methods, potential models, and intent of its multiple authors. This introductory chapter locates the production of the Florentine Codex in its historical, literary, and artistic framework and summarizes the thirteen substantive contributions to this volume. At the outset I should clarify the several titles conferred on the Florentine Codex and their inconsistent usage. The “Florentine Codex” is the title that the pioneering historians Francisco del Paso y Troncoso, Joaquín García Icazbalceta, Arthur Anderson and Charles Dibble, and other prominent scholars have given the manuscript that now exists in the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana in Florence, Italy (Med. Palat. 218, 219, and 220). The twelve books of the manuscript were originally bound in four volumes;7 today the manuscript consists of 1,223 folios (2,446 pages) and is rebound in three volumes. Ironically, historians do not know the original title of the work; it is unclear what title Sahagún chose. The manuscript preserves only a small fragment of the title page, which was probably removed when it was bound a second time. It is also called the Historia general de las cosas de Nueva España and the Historia universal de las cosas de Nueva España, based on the titles of a working draft and 2 • Kevin Terraciano\n\na copy of the Spanish text, the Palacio Real and Tolosa manuscripts, respectively, both in Madrid.8 Many scholars have also adopted the Historia general title, including Carlos María de Bustamante, Paso y Troncoso, and Anderson and Dibble, both for Sahagún’s larger project (1558–1577) and explicitly for the final edition. In 1829– 1830, Bustamante published the Spanish translation of the codex as the Historia general de las cosas de Nueva España. It is based on the Tolosa manuscript, which in general is a faithful copy of the Florentine’s Spanish text.9 In the prologues to each of the twelve books, Sahagún seems to avoid a title, referring to the work numerous times as the libros (books) or the doze libros (twelve books) or the obra (work). He also uses the title historia more than once, in the prologues to Books 9 and 10 and in his letter to the king in 1578, mentioned before. The broader meaning of the word historia in the early modern period did not refer exclusively to an account of past events; the term was often modified with other descriptive terms, such as natural (i.e., flora and fauna) or moral (mores) to indicate broader studies of nature or customs.10 The qualifying term general implies the treatment of a wide range of subjects, and universal suggests an attempt to insert the Nahuas into a universal Christian history. Jesús Bustamante García observes that the archbishop of Mexico, Pedro Moya de Contreras, referred to the work as Sahagún’s “Historia universal de las Yndias” in his letter to the king, dated December 16, 1578.11 ­Victoria Ríos Castaño provides evidence that universal was the term recognized by King Philip II and the Council of the Indies. She also points out that the choice of twelve books conforms to the symbolic import of the number twelve to the friars and to Christian ideology in general.12 Sahagún also refers to having written “twelve books of the divine, or rather idolatrous, human, and natural things of this New Spain.”13 Thus he refers to his entire encyclopedic project with many of the key words that were later applied to it: “Historia general de las cosas de Nueva España.”\n\nThe Imperial Archive Despite many dramatic postconquest changes, the Nahuatl-­speaking peoples who lived around Lake Texcoco in the Basin of Mexico continued to live and work in hundreds of separate, semiautonomous altepetl (communities) that survived in altered but recognizable forms.14 Even the two altepetl at the center of the Mexica capital,\n\nTable I.1.

Nonetheless, their leaders and inhabitants were forced to come to terms with new political and religious authorities who spoke a foreign language, introduced another legal system, and promoted a rapidly changing economy in which the competition for natural and human resources, especially at the center of this “New Spain,” intensified with each generation. At the same time, the Crown sought to impose its sovereignty on the distant land. Carlos V brought the chaotic early period of Cortés, and his successor, Nuño Beltrán de Guzmán, president of the first audiencia, or high court, to a close by appointing a second audiencia of judges loyal to the Crown and a new viceroy, don Antonio de Mendoza, who governed from 1535 to 1550. Viceroy Mendoza consolidated the Crown’s authority and supported the efforts of the mendicant orders to establish the Church.15 In this early period of violent entradas (expeditions) and Indian slaving, fray Bartolomé de las Casas and other critics of empire exposed the hypocrisy of the concept of “just war” and lamented the rapidly declining native population. The New Laws of 1542 represented the Crown’s attempt to assert its authority throughout Spanish America by reigning in conquistadores, outlawing indigenous slavery in so-­ called pacified areas, and abolishing the encomienda (royal grant of indigenous labor and tribute to a Spaniard). Although the New Laws were not carried out fully anywhere, rebellious movements and the discovery of rich silver deposits in the viceroyalties of New Spain and Peru stiffened the Crown’s resolve to assert control over the Indies, as the Holy Roman Empire continued to expand. The Florentine Codex is unique in its scope and reliance on Nahua collaborators, but it nevertheless falls within the parameters of the early modern European quest for collecting information on newly conquered territories and their people. Spain’s overseas ventures generated a staggering amount of information, contributing to the creation of an imperial archive. Leaders of expeditions were among the first to report, using the genre of the relación, or account. Hernando Cortés wrote the first cartas de relación from Mexico, sending his letters directly to the king beginning in 1519. Early relaciones and crónicas (chronicles), written by both secular and ecclesiastical officials, brimmed with cultural detail about the people of the new lands, the indios. The first royal chronicler of the 4 • Kevin Terraciano\n\nIndies, Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés, stationed on the island of Española, in Santo Domingo, interviewed Spaniards returning to Spain for the first part of his lengthy history, Historia general y natural de las Indias, published in Seville in 1535. Fray Toribio de Benavente, one of the original twelve Franciscans to arrive in New Spain in 1524, who adopted the name Motolinía (Nahuatl for “he is poor, afflicted”), completed his Historia de los indios de la Nueva España in 1541, within two decades of his arrival, but it was not published until the nineteenth century.16 Motolinía consulted many Nahuas and was one of the first Spaniards to realize how Nahuas kept written records of their histories, using a pictorial system that he compared to Egyptian hieroglyphs. Francisco López de Gómara, author of the first history of the conquest of Mexico (after Cortés’s letters), published in 1552, copied entire sections of Motolinía’s manuscript on indigenous customs into his own work.17 Native artists in the early postconquest period contributed directly to many manuscripts by providing information and producing images. Nahua tlacuiloque (plural of tlacuilo, writer/painter) learned how to write their languages with the Roman alphabet; many culture groups in Mesoamerica had developed traditions of writing on stone, fig-­bark paper (amatl), deerskin, and cloth with natural pigments long before the Spaniards arrived. The eleventh book of the Florentine Codex features twelve pages on colors or pigments used for writing/painting. Figure I.2 is a folio from chapter 11, which shows two tlacuiloque working while assistants prepare pigments of different colors. Ironically, the images in this second part of Book 11 contain no colors; the artists seem to have run out of pigments by this latter part of the project, after painting hundreds of images throughout most of the manuscript. One of the first compilations to feature indigenous images and Spanish text was the Codex Mendoza. Produced during Viceroy Mendoza’s term of office (1535– 1550), little is known about the origins of this manuscript, for it contains no title page or prologue. One potential scenario is that an indigenous group in Mexico City, perhaps in collaboration with friars, created a pictorial manuscript that portrays Tenochtitlan and Mexica society in a positive light and then approached Spanish authorities to have it translated and sent to the king. The Codex Mendoza consists of three parts: (1) a history of Mexica dynastic leaders and their conquests; (2) a long list of tribute that altepetl subject to the Mexica empire sent to Tenochtitlan;\n\nFigure I.2.

The artists then explained the meaning of the images to a translator, who wrote explanatory Spanish glosses alongside the paintings. The resulting narrative juxtaposes images, language, and a wealth of information on Mexica culture.18 But it is unclear whether Viceroy Mendoza commissioned or even saw the manuscript. More certain is Mendoza’s sponsorship of the 1541 Relación de Michoacán, a book that was written by a Franciscan based on interviews with indigenous informants and illustrated by indigenous artists. Its tripartite structure resembles the Codex Mendoza, but its purpose was to help resolve territorial disputes in and around Tzintzuntzan.19 By the 1540s, indigenous writers throughout highland Mesoamerica were producing many different types of pictorial manuscripts to support claims within the Spanish justice system, attempting to show proof of possession and hereditary authority for judges in the form of maps and lists of rulers. In fact, Viceroy Mendoza had ruled in favor of allowing pictorial claims as evidence in lawsuits.20 Indigenous artists used images to document everything from land claims to abuses of authority. The Codex Tepetlaoztoc (or Kingsborough) and the Codex Osuna, for example, were produced for legal disputes in the 1550s and 1560s. In this early postconquest period, Franciscans played a leading role among the mendicant orders in working closely with indigenous men to record their languages for evangelical purposes, creating vocabularios (translation dictionaries), artes (grammar texts), doctrinas (doctrinal texts explaining Christian concepts), and confesionarios (confessional manuals)—all in native languages, with or without Spanish translations. Many of these works were among the first books published in the Americas. Fray Alonso de Molina, who worked and taught alongside Sahagún in the Colegio de Santa Cruz, published the first Spanish-­to-­ Nahuatl vocabulario in 1555, and then added a Nahuatl-­ to-­Spanish complement in 1571, creating the first two-­ way dictionary of an indigenous language of the Americas. Obviously, Molina could not have done this without the assistance of many Nahuas who were fluent in Spanish. In spite of the indispensable contribution of bilingual indigenous scholars, the title pages of these works consistently refer to the friars as the sole authors, even when indigenous contributions are acknowledged in the prologues to 6 • Kevin Terraciano\n\nthe works. In the making of the Florentine Codex, Bernardino de Sahagún shared these collaborative working practices, but to his credit he included the names of some of his Nahua coauthors in his prologues and interpolations.\n\nA Unique Collaborative Project Fray Bernardino de Sahagún was born around 1499 or 1500 in the ancient town of Sahagún, in the kingdom of León. He took his vows and assumed the habit of the Franciscan order in Salamanca, where he likely also attended the University of Salamanca.21 He arrived in New Spain in 1529 and established a reputation for learning Nahuatl.22 By the 1540s, he embarked on a series of projects that stand out for their originality and sheer ambition, summarized in table I.1. For example, he collected dozens of Nahuatl speeches in 1547 and recorded a Nahuatl version of the conquest of Mexico in 1555. In 1558, the Franciscan provincial, fray Francisco de Toral, commissioned Sahagún to compile a study of indigenous culture that would be useful to the religious who sought to indoctrinate neophytes in the Christian faith. To this end, Sahagún took four Nahua scholars whom he had taught at the Colegio de Santa Cruz in Tlatelolco to the Franciscan convent in Tepepulco, an altepetl located about eighty kilometers northeast of Mexico City and the probable source of the Nahuatl speeches that he had collected earlier. The four scholars were Antonio Valeriano of Azcapotzalco, Martín Jacobita of Tlatelolco, and Pedro de San Buenaventura and Alonso Vegerano of Cuauhtitlan. In Tepepulco Sahagún and his team consulted with elders and leaders, who used images as mnemonic devices to elicit oral recitations and responses, in the manner that preconquest-­style codices were used to guide a narrative. The Nahuatl scholars wrote down the responses prompted by the images. Sahagún also compiled word lists for various topics that were explained later, focusing on the lexicon associated with each topic.23 By 1561, Sahagún and his team produced a manuscript known today as the Primeros memoriales, considered a precursor to the Florentine Codex in its thematic structure and its reliance on a strong pictorial component. Its four chapters consist of eighty-­eight folios, or 176 pages; more than half of the pages contain illustrations. The Primeros memoriales follows a pattern detected in other encyclopedic manuscripts that organize their material from the celestial to the more earthbound realms, discussed more\n\nfully later. The first chapter, titled “Teteo,” addresses the deities and their associated rituals; the second, “Ilhuicayotl iuan Mictlancayotl,” treats matters related to the heavens and the place of the dead; the third, “Tlatocayotl,” deals with rulers; and the fourth chapter, “Tlacayotl,” considers a variety of human affairs.24 Images serve a primary function in the Primeros memoriales, as in the Codex Mendoza, guiding the content of the alphabetic text. Unlike the Mendoza glosses, which are in Spanish, in the Primeros memoriales Nahuas wrote explanations or transmitted information in Nahuatl. In 1561 Sahagún returned to the Colegio de Santa Cruz in Santiago Tlatelolco, where he applied the methods he had developed in Tepepulco, meeting with leaders there to request support for his grander project. In the prologue to Book 2 of the Florentine Codex, Sahagún recounts how in Tlatelolco “[t]he governor with his councilmen assigned me as many as eight or ten leaders, selected from among all, very capable in their language, and in their ancient customs.”25 These men, and four or five of his most able trilingual students from the Colegio de Santa Cruz, “amended, explained, and expanded” what was collected in Tepepulco. The resulting drafts from this period are known as the “Manuscrito de Tlatelolco.” In 1565 Sahagún returned to the convent of San Francisco in Mexico City to work alone for three years, where he “examined and reexamined” all his writings. He writes in the prologue to Book 2 that he “divided them into books, into twelve books, and some books by chapters and paragraphs.” He included material already gathered on rhetoric (1547) and the conquest (1555), which became Books 6 and 12 of the Florentine Codex, respectively. The Franciscan completed this Nahuatl “Manuscrito de 1569” in Mexico City. Nahua students “added and amended many things to the twelve books when they made a clear copy.” However, at this time only the Nahuatl text of the bilingual project was complete.26 In 1570, the merits of Sahagún’s project were discussed at the provincial order chapter meeting in Mexico City. Some members voiced concern with the project, Sahagún recalls, that “it was contrary to the vows of poverty to spend monies in recording those writings.”27 It is likely that the matter involved more than economic considerations. At issue was a heated debate over the role of knowledge about indigenous cultures within the missionary program. Franciscans were divided. Did recognizing and recording indigenous culture, including sacred beliefs\n\nand practices, advance or undermine their goals of converting the native inhabitants to Christianity? In any case, Sahagún was instructed to dismiss his scribes and complete the work alone, despite the “trembling” of his hand in old age. Even worse, the provincial, fray Alonso de Escalona, confiscated and scattered the books by sending them to friars throughout the province for their perusal. The tide turned five years later, however, and Sahagún eventually retrieved the books with the assistance of the commissary fray Miguel Navarro. In 1575, the commissary general fray Rodrigo de Sequera ordered the Nahuatl manuscript to be translated into Spanish, authorizing the project’s continuation. Sequera intended to send it to the president of the Council of the Indies, don Juan de Ovando.28 Ovando had become president in 1571, advising the king on policy regarding the Indies and building a corpus of data for the imperial archive.29 His interests ranged from geography and natural resources to the customs and history of indigenous peoples. Ovando began to develop questionnaires to be circulated throughout the Spanish empire, ultimately the basis of the Relaciones geográficas that were sent to New Spain in 1576. In 1573 King Philip II issued a decree to compile a historia, a book of descripciones, a type of encyclopedia on the history of the Indies and its people, the type of manuscript on which Sahagún and his team had been working.30 Ovando created the position of cosmógrafo-­cronista to write the official history and geography of the Indies, and he sent out scientific expeditions, including that of Francisco Hernández, the protomédico who collected a vast array of botanical and medicinal information in Mexico. When Ovando heard of Sahagún’s work he asked to see the books, and Sequera intended to send them to him, but Ovando died in 1575. In 1576, the archbishop of Mexico, Pedro Moya de Contreras, entered the conversation, urging Sequera to have the books translated into Spanish and to send them to the king.31 Meanwhile, Sahagún prepared Spanish summaries of the Nahuatl text in what would become the final edition of the Historia general, or the Florentine Codex. He focused on translating the manuscript and writing the prologues in 1576 and 1577. The prologues refer to current events of that period, including the epidemic of 1576, discussed before. Artists also added the hundreds of images in these two years, most painted in polychrome tones. Only the images in the second half of Book 11 and in Books 6 and 12 lack color (with a few exceptions), suggesting that these Introduction • 7\n\nwere the final books being illustrated when the color pigments ran out; or that their preparation could not keep up with the scribes’ hurried pace to complete the manuscript; or that the epidemic of 1576–1577 affected the availability of pigments and manpower to complete its production, or some combination of these factors.32 Everyone was forced to work faster to meet a new deadline when the Crown altered its position on manuscripts involving indigenous history and religion and issued royal cedulas ordering the confiscation of all manuscripts on the topic. In April of 1577, King Philip II issued a decree that concludes: We order that, as soon as you receive this, our decree, with great care and diligence you take measures to get these books without there remaining the originals or copies of them, and to send them well guarded at once to our Council of the Indies, that they may there be examined. And you will be advised not to permit anyone, for any reason, in any language, to write concerning the superstitions and way of life these Indians had.33\n\nThe decree suggests a shift in policy from encouraging the collection of information on indigenous culture and history to prohibiting writing on those topics. Moreover, the decree authorized the confiscation of all manuscripts and related materials on these controversial topics. The Council of Trent’s decrees (1545–1563) to condemn false doctrines and idolatries and the presence of the Holy Office of the Inquisition, established in New Spain in 1571, might have influenced the Crown’s decision. This cedula and its enforcement expedited Sahagún’s plan to send the books to Spain. Sahagún wrote a letter to Philip II in March 1578, averring that he had sent a copy of the Historia general to the king but had heard nothing of its reception, and that he would copy the manuscript and send it again if it had not reached him (unwittingly suggesting that he had defied the order by keeping a copy of the manuscript). Another reference to this manuscript appears in Sahagún’s 1585 version of Book 12, where he claims he gave a first copy to the outgoing viceroy, don Martín Enríquez, and then later gave a second copy to fray Rodrigo de Sequera.34 Since a first so-­called Enríquez copy is no longer extant, and it is difficult to believe that Sahagún and his team could produce two major manuscripts within a couple of years, the only certainty is that Sahagún entrusted a complete version with images to Sequera, who departed 8 • Kevin Terraciano\n\nMexico for Spain in 1580.35 This “Sequera manuscript,” dedicated to the supportive commissary general, is the Florentine Codex. Sahagún called the books of this copy “muy historiados” (profusely illustrated).36 Although the fate of the Sequera manuscript once it reached Spain is equally unclear, it likely arrived in Rome, where Ferdinando I de’ Medici acquired the manuscript, by gift or purchase, from Sequera.37 Giovanna Rao provides new evidence indicating that Ferdinando possessed the manuscript before he became Grand Duke of Tuscany in 1588. She concludes that Sequera probably thought that the codex was more likely to survive if it were entrusted to the grand duke, who sought to augment the collection of international manuscripts begun by Cosimo the Elder. One fascinating piece of evidence that the codex had reached Florence by 1588–1589 comes from the depiction of Mexica warriors on the ceiling of the former Armeria (room 21) of the Uffizi Gallery, originally a Medici palace. The greatest affinity between the Florentine Codex and the Uffizi murals is found in the portrayal of a heroic Mexica warrior, Tzilacatzin, who is featured in Book 12 (fol. 60v).38 The artist must have seen the codex before he painted his stylized narrative of the conquest of the Americas. After 1587–1589, the preservation and location of the codex was unknown to all those outside a few people within the Medici circle until 1793, when the bibliographer Angelo Maria Bandini published a catalogue in Latin of manuscripts in the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana, designed by Michelangelo. Still, the work was not studied until it was cited again by fray Marcelino de Civezza in 1879, a full three centuries after its journey across the Atlantic Ocean to Tuscany.39 This discussion of the evolution and survival of the Florentine Codex sheds light on the unique qualities of the manuscript. Sahagún deliberates on why and how the work was produced, referring to the obstacles that beset the project and suggesting that he knew the books would continue to attract scrutiny: “[T]his work has been examined and verified by many over many years. It has suffered many travails and misfortunes until it has been put into the form it is now in.”40 Sahagún’s prologues abound with such defensive remarks about the nature of the work, beginning with his opening statement in the first prologue, in which he compares a doctor’s remedy to the extirpation of idolatry. Just as a doctor needs to know the symptoms of a sickness in order to apply a cure to the patient, he reasoned, the religious of New Spain needed to be able\n\nto identify idolatry in its many forms in order to destroy it completely. Saving people, whether from disease of the body or the soul, required knowledge. Considering that Sahagún wrote these prologues last, in 1576 and 1577, in the midst of an epidemic, it is no coincidence that he chose to compare the work of priests with doctors. Many friars, in fact, believed that God was punishing the Indians with disease because of their idolatries. And yet this religious justification was only one aspect of the work. If fray Francisco de Toral commissioned Sahagún to compile a study of indigenous culture that would be useful to the mendicants who sought to indoctrinate them in the Christian faith, Sahagún and his team of Nahua writers and artists went far beyond this objective, creating a massive compilation of language and culture that resembles a humanist encyclopedia more than a handbook for extirpation. Indeed, no other manuscript in the Americas can match the Florentine Codex for its wide-­ranging coverage of numerous topics (some controversial at the time), its hundreds of carefully painted illustrations, and its record of the indigenous language.\n\n“A Treasury for the Knowledge of Many Things ” : Models for the Manuscript In referring to the type of work that he and his colleagues had sought to produce, Sahagún remarks that many who knew of his project would ask about the calepino, in reference to the demonstrative vocabulary of Latin that Ambrosio Calepino (1440–1510/1511) had created.41 Although Sahagún concluded that it would be impossible to create a calepino, considering that there were very few Nahuatl (alphabetic) writings at this time, he thought his project might lay the groundwork for such a work. He interrogated his Nahua colleagues for “all manners of speech and all the words that this language uses, as well verified and certain as that which Virgil, Cicero, and other authors wrote in the Latin language.” Sahagún was certain that the compendium would be “a treasury for the knowledge of many things worthy of being known,” and a “thing of much value in New and Old Spain.”42 If recording “all manners of speech and all the words” of the language was one of Sahagún’s main concerns, organizing and preserving knowledge on a wide variety of topics regarding Nahua culture was another. Aside from the calepino, several other works seem to have influenced the objective and method\n\nof the Florentine Codex, including classical and medieval encyclopedias, historias (general, universal, natural, moral), Christian treatises, and the many books on sermons and confessions that filled the shelves of the Colegio de Santa Cruz library. The Florentine Codex is clearly “encyclopedic” in that it attempts to encapsulate the sum of what was then known about the Nahua world in a concrete, pictorialized book form. Sahagún’s monumental endeavor fulfills the very definition of the encyclopedia, from the Greek for “general knowledge” (enkyklios paideia).43 It is also a work that “encapsulates a total or universal body of knowledge organizing it in order to preserve it and make it accessible.”44 The manuscript’s format and its sequence of twelve books conform to the hierarchical organization of classical and medieval compendia, progressing from the realms of the divine (“Gods” and “Ceremonies”) to the human (“The People”) and the natural realms (“Earthly Things”). Only Book 6, “Rhetoric,” and Book 12, “The Conquest,” break with this sequence (for a summary of the organization of the twelve books, see table I.2). For its overarching structural organization, as well as in some cases specific data, three well-­known encyclopedias have been suggested as models (see table I.3): Pliny the Elder’s Naturalis historia, found in the Tlatelolco library; the seventh-­century Etymologiae of Isidore of Seville (580–636); and the thirteenth-­century De proprietatibus rerum (On the nature of things, 1220–1240) by Bartholomeus Anglicus.45 Isidore was the first Christian writer to compile a summa of universal knowledge in the Etymologiae, also known as Origines. The twenty-­volume compilation assembled parts of many books from antiquity. Two of these well-­known encyclopedists, Pliny and Isidore, also devote considerable attention to language and rhetoric.46 Sahagún seems to imitate Pliny in describing his Historia general project as a thesaurus, a treasury (tesoro), and a coffer (recamara) or storehouse.47 Anglicus’s influence on Book 6 and especially Book 10 of the Florentine Codex, in its description of the vices and virtues of various Nahua types, is well documented.48 Several Christian texts influenced Sahagún’s model and the content of the Florentine Codex. Saint Augustine, for one, wrote on the conversion of non-­Christian populations and the taxonomy of “pagan” gods. Augustine wrote De civitate dei (City of God) to defend Christianity after the sack of Rome by a Gothic army in 410. By the sixteenth century, the work was firmly established in Introduction • 9\n\nTable I.2.

Augustine’s intent to compile knowledge on pagan religions in order to expose their false and sinful nature resonates with Sahagún’s objective for compiling the first five books of the Florentine Codex.49 Elizabeth Boone and Guilhem Olivier refer to the influence of Augustine in this volume. Ríos Castaño demonstrates the importance of Augustine and shows that several collections of sermons, manuals of confessional practices, and texts on biblical exegesis had a decisive influence on Sahagún’s model and inquisitorial method of collecting information.50 Book 11 of the Florentine Codex on the flora and fauna, minerology, and topography of New Spain anticipates other sixteenth- and early seventeenth-­century studies of natural history. These include the works of Andrea Cesalpino (De plantis libri XVI, published in 1583), Ulisse Androvandi (De reliquis animalibus [. . .], 1605), and Francisco Hernández (Cuatro libros de la naturaleza [. . .] de la Nueva España, 1615), which feature legends and proverbs,\n\n10 • Kevin Terraciano\n\nsuperstitions, and symbols associated with specific animals and plants.51 In fact, Hernández consulted Sahagún’s manuscript in Tlatelolco. The range of potential models for the Florentine Codex continues to expand as intriguing new sources are identified, some described in this volume. For example, Boone refers to the work of Albricus, a philosopher who wrote a thirteenth-­century treatise (Liber ymaginum deorum), as well as new manuals published in the sixteenth century on the description and mythology of the classical gods, which helped frame questionnaires regarding Nahua deities and also impacted the rendering of the gods’ iconography in the Florentine Codex. The Franciscan Johann Boemus published in 1520 a work on peoples and their customs (Omnium gentium mores, leges et ritus). Pablo Escalante Gonzalbo observes that Olaus Magnus’s Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus (1565) and Johann von Cube’s Hortus sanitatis (1536) served as models for several illustrations in the Florentine Codex.

It was the first great “historia general” produced in Castile. Written not in Latin but in Castilian, the General estoria was intended as a world history from the time of creation to the reign of Alfonso el Sabio, king of Castile and León (1252–1284). The unfinished work intertwines the Old Testament, Greek and Roman mythology, and extrabiblical information on the people and empires of the extended Mediterranean world and ends with the birth of Christ.53 The General estoria relied on a wide array of sources in Latin (especially Pliny), Arabic, Castilian, French, and English; like Sahagún’s Historia, it treats the histories of deities, kings, and earthly things. The manuscripts’ euhemeristic interpretation of legends, in which gods and goddesses are treated as old kings, queens, and heroes who were worshipped as deities\n\nafter their deaths, resembles the Florentine Codex’s treatment of Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca, for example, who lived in Toltec times and were later worshipped as gods. In the prologue to Book 8 Sahagún compares the legend of Quetzalcoatl to that of King Arthur, whose exploits are discussed at length in the General estoria, based on a translation of Geoffrey of Monmouth.54 Sahagún likens the people and altepetl of central Mexico to those of the Mediterranean world, comparing Cholula to Rome, Tlaxcala to Carthage, Tula to Troy, and Mexico to Venice.55 Like the ancient Romans, the people left impressive antiquities and structures strewn across the land, in places like Tula and Xochicalco. Sahagún’s attempt to make sense of Mesoamerica by comparison with the Mediterranean pagan world is part of his Historia general project. There is no doubt that Sahagún planned a work that is based to some degree on the hierarchy and categorization visible in classical, medieval, and Renaissance models. But ultimately the Florentine Codex is singular in that the end product relied on the constant participation of Nahua scholars who took the various prototypes presented by\n\nIntroduction • 11\n\nSahagún and adapted them to their own ways of gathering and presenting knowledge, filtered through their own choices of what to document and preserve. At the same time, the scholars were exposed to Hispanic values and were well versed in Christian beliefs. The dynamic process of exchange and interaction between Sahagún and his team of Nahuas created new forms of expression and knowledge. The manuscript’s artwork makes apparent this adaptation. In many respects, the art style of the images is neither European nor Mesoamerican but an entirely new colonial creation. Thus the final product is truly unique, even compared with manuscripts produced in New Spain in the same century.56\n\nThe Present Volume Much has been written on the Florentine Codex; we are indebted to those who recognized the great value of the manuscript and spent much of their careers plumbing its rich commentary. We pay homage to such luminosos as Arthur Anderson, Charles Dibble, Ángel María Garibay Kintana, Wigberto Jiménez Moreno, Miguel León-­Portilla, James Lockhart, Alfredo López Austin, H. B. Nicholson, Francisco del Paso y Troncoso, Donald Robertson—to name only a few. Many of their groundbreaking works on the Florentine Codex appear in the bibliography and throughout the many notes of this volume. This chapter draws from many previous introductory studies, especially the essays by Anderson and Dibble in the introductory volume to their English translation of the Nahuatl, which set a high standard for their clear and concise prose.57 The introduction by Ángel María Garibay Kintana in the 1953–1954 edition of the Historia general is another invaluable source. Excellent studies of the Florentine Codex and related manuscripts include those compiled by Munro Edmonson (1974); J. Jorge Klor de Alva, H. B. Nicholson, and Eloise Quiñones Keber (1988); Quiñones Keber (2002); John Frederick Schwaller (2003); and Gerhard Wolf and Joseph Connors (2011). The list of contributors to these volumes reads like a who’s who of Florentine Codex scholars. The Handbook of Middle American Indians, edited by Robert Wauchope, especially volume 13, part 2 (1973), contains several seminal essays on the Florentine Codex and manuscripts associated with Sahagún. The flagship research journal published by the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Mexico, Estudios de Cultura Náhuatl, founded in 1959, deserves recognition 12 • Kevin Terraciano\n\nfor publishing hundreds of articles on the Florentine. The journal’s longtime editor and contributing author, Miguel León-­Portilla, has published many pieces related to the Florentine Codex in Estudios and is spearheading a multiauthored project to translate sections of Nahuatl text in the Florentine Codex into Spanish. A facsimile edition of the Florentine Codex, produced in 1979 by Giunti Barbera in Florence and the Secretaría de Gobernación in Mexico, spurred on studies of the codex. A facsimile edition and translation of the Primeros memoriales, translated by Thelma Sullivan and edited by Nicholson et al. (1993, 1997), represents another breakthrough. Jesús Bustamante García (1990) provides a useful, detailed examination of the composition of Sahagún’s manuscripts. Most recently, Victoria Ríos Castaño (2014) has examined the methods and models of the Historia universal and Sahagún’s mission of translation and conversion. Yet the Florentine Codex remains an understudied work, considering its depth and breadth of content. Sahagún’s primary interest was collecting and preserving the Nahuatl texts. His Spanish translation seems like a secondary consideration, an obligation frequently requested by his superiors and completed, for the most part, only in the final years of the project. The Spanish ranges from translating the Nahuatl text verbatim, to summarizing or ignoring it. And yet the Spanish data has been used more often by scholars. The very first publication of the Historia general de las cosas de Nueva España, in 1829–1830, by Carlos María de Bustamante, was based on the Tolosa manuscript version of the Spanish translation. Many subsequent editions were based on this same version. The monumental translation project of Anderson and Dibble (Sahagún, 1950–1982), and James Lockhart’s translation of both the Nahuatl and the Spanish of Book 12 (1993), have enabled more recent studies of the Nahuatl, understood through English translation. Likewise, Ángel María Garibay Kintana and Miguel León-­Portilla offer sections of the Nahuatl text of Book 12 in Spanish, in Visión de los vencidos (1959). Despite these excellent works, systematic analyses of the Florentine based on the original Nahuatl text are few. The images of the Florentine were created last but clearly play a prominent role in the manuscript, judging by their number, quality, and color. Our 2015 conference was, to our knowledge, the first dedicated specifically to the interrelation of the three “texts”—the Nahuatl, the Spanish translation, and the images58—and was certainly\n\nthe first to focus on how the images and their meanings differ from textual exegesis. The painstaking labor and commitment required to create so many detailed, colored paintings suggest that Nahuas insisted on including them, as discussed by Jeanette Peterson in chapter 1. One important observation to emerge from the conference, and more fully underscored in the chapters of this volume, is that one cannot call the manuscript “Sahagún’s Florentine Codex.” In reality, Sahagún was more coordinator, compiler, editor, and translator than author. Garibay and León-­Portilla advanced this idea as early as the 1950s.59 But scholars are still coming to terms with how Nahua authors and artists contributed the essential content of the work. Sahagún assumed responsibility for the Spanish translation, and there is no doubt that he wrote the prologues and Spanish interpolations, but those parts constitute less than half of the total work and are not the primary contributions. Although Sahagún contributed to this notion by calling himself the “author” in the text, he also refers to himself as a compiler, and he credits many (but not all) of the Nahuas who played a pivotal role in the project.60 In addition to those trilingual four already mentioned and on whom Sahagún relied the most—Antonio Valeriano, Martín Jacobita, Pedro de San Buenaventura, and Alonso Vegerano—other scribes included Diego de Grado and Bonifacio Maximiliano of Tlatelolco, and Mateo Severino of Xochimilco.61 Still others who came from different communities around the great lake of Texcoco contributed to the manuscript. For example, in Book 11 we find a list of Nahua tiçitl, or physicians, from barrios and parishes of Tlatelolco, who contributed their knowledge to the section on medical cures and herbs in folios 139v to 181. The experienced elders include Gaspar Matías and Pedro de Raquena of Concepción; Pedro Santiago and Miguel Motolinía of Santa Inés; Francisco Simón, Miguel Damián, and Miguel García of Santo Toribio; and Felipe Hernández of Santa Ana. In Book 10, another eight médicos mexicanos are listed as providing information for the preceding section (fols. 97–113v) on illnesses of the body: Juan Pérez, Pedro Pérez, Pedro Hernández, José Hernández, Miguel García, Francisco de la Cruz, Baltasar Juárez, and Antonio Martínez.62 Even those talented Nahuas who remain unnamed were not simply his “informants” or his “aides.” They were Sahagún’s sources of information: the multilingual writers of the Nahuatl text, the part of the work that was produced first; and the artists who “illuminated” the manuscript, the part that was done last.\n\nFinally, it is important to consider what the manuscript means for Mexico and for the Americas in general. There is no doubt that the Florentine Codex is the most remarkable and most important intellectual product of the exchange between indigenous and European cultures in the early modern Atlantic world. Such a work could have been produced only in Mesoamerica, where the introduction of the Roman alphabet and European art style made sense to people who had been writing and painting with ink and natural colors for centuries. It is among the rare first manuscripts to represent indigenous cultures that involved indigenous people. It is the richest resource for the study of “classical” Nahuatl. As a collaborative, multivoiced enterprise, the Florentine Codex embodies various modes of interpretation and transformation, processes that may be characterized as distorting or betraying the original while simultaneously, in the “creative destruction” that defines all translation, also being perceived as processes of “invention and renewal.”63 The Nahua scribes and artists actively constructed versions of their cultural identity through their choice of vocabulary, as well as by means of syntactical and pictorial choices. Sahagún, on the other hand, seems to reconcile his inherited intellectual traditions and orthodox religiosity with his desire to bear witness to the differences, as well as the similarities, that marked the Americas. These dual objectives were not without tension, as manifest in Sahagún’s outlook as well as our modern assessment of his achievements. Scholars have tended to characterize the friar in rather polarized terms, as a learned scholar who sought to record indigenous language and knowledge, or as a physician of souls who employed inquisitorial methods of collecting information for pragmatic missionary purposes. Rather than regarding Sahagún primarily as a pioneer ethnographer (and something of an anachronism), or conversely as firmly rooted in a sixteenth-­century Euro-­ Christian framework, the Franciscan seems to be caught between a medieval and modern mindset: the former defined knowledge as revealed by the grace of God, whereas the ideas of modernity credited the human intellect with the capability of producing knowledge, as Walden Browne argues.64 In his task as cultural translator, collating and permanently inscribing the language and culture of the Nahuatl-­ speaking peoples, Sahagún adopted a Western book form and hierarchical organization of topics. Anthony Grafton critically notes that the vast quantity of incoming informaIntroduction • 13\n\ntion was shoehorned into existing schemata; in his words, Sahagún bent “the New World to the old systems.”65 Nonetheless, while recognizing the European influences on the content and organization of the work, many of the authors in this volume discern indigenous or Nahua modes of categorizing knowledge, underscoring the discretionary power of the tlacuiloque over their sources and interpretative strategies. In other words, Sahagún had confidence in those who had trained with him, even if his trust in the Nahua population eventually dissipated into a darker suspicion, as censorship, age, disease, and the growing decline of the regular orders grew ever more debilitating in the later years. In the end, nothing went exactly according to plan in New Spain. Spanish intentions were seldom fully achieved and were always tempered and compromised by local actors and negotiations. This was true of Sahagún’s Historia general, as well. Sahagún clearly had his models, but the final manuscript reflects the profound input and subjectivity of the Nahua artists and writers on whom he depended to complete the project, as the chapters of this volume hope to show. While keeping in mind the intellectual coherence of this volume and the complementary overlap between essays, we have subdivided the chapters loosely into four thematic sections: “The Art of Translation,” “Lords: Royal and Sacred,” “Ordering the Cosmos,” and “Social Discourse and Deviance.” We recognize that in doing so we, too, are guilty of imposing our academic need to classify knowledge.\n\nThe Art of Translation The philological objective of Sahagún, that is, his aim to produce a sweeping and inclusive dictionary of the Nahuatl language, is laudable in a time period when the indigenous languages of the Americas were increasingly under siege. For Spanish officials, particularly ecclesiastical authorities, words in native tongues were inherently suspect and images potentially idolatrous; translation itself might camouflage heretical ideas and harbor dangerous political meanings. The first section, “The Art of Translation,” encompasses four chapters that directly and indirectly confront the textual and pictorial facets of the translational process within the contested social, political, and counterreformational milieu of late sixteenth-­century Spain and New Spain. The slippage inherent in these acts of translation is understood as a process that generates new meanings.66 14 • Kevin Terraciano\n\nJeanette Favrot Peterson addresses not only the nature and motives behind the plethora of images in the Florentine Codex but also the historiographic factors that promoted textual exegesis of the manuscript while hindering serious scholarship of its paintings. While acknowledging the pervasive stylistic and iconographic Europeanizations visible in the imagery, Peterson also locates meaningful signs reflective of an indigenous worldview and long-­standing pictographic tradition. As indices of intercultural dynamics, the images reinforce the appeal of the Florentine Codex to dual audiences and betray the Nahua painters’ roles as vital participants in the creation of the manuscript. Ida Giovanna Rao’s remarkable discovery of the earliest translation into Italian of the first five books of the Florentine Codex (with Lia Markey) underscores the almost immediate recognition of the illuminated manuscript’s significance. Notwithstanding Ferdinando I de’ Medici’s own Catholic fervor and his belief in a universal Christendom, his humanist education made him open to the value of the newly discovered Americas. Through a selection of excerpts published for the first time, herein also in English, Rao demonstrates the care with which the professional (if anonymous) translator worked literally, rather than liberally, making changes primarily in the abbreviation of some passages. Nowhere are the partisan motivations of translators more apparent than in the competing Nahua-­Spanish dialogues on the conquest in Book 12. Kevin Terraciano deconstructs the Mexica (Nahua) narrative, one of the earliest accounts (1555) from an indigenous perspective. He identifies significant differences between the Nahuatl text and the Spanish translation, which is much shorter than the original, and considers reasons for the discrepancies. The paintings of Book 12 operate somewhat independently, both adhering to the narrative and veering off to depict other memories not articulated in the alphabetic texts. Terraciano connects the conspicuous, exaggerated display of feathers in the headgear of both indigenous and European protagonists with Nahua concepts of tonalli and teotl, extreme force and power. A close analysis of all three “texts” enriches our understanding of this invaluable indigenous account of the encounter and war. The appropriation and translation of a wide array of pictorial prototypes by the Florentine’s painters is the theme of Pablo Escalante Gonzalbo’s chapter. Given the wealth of humanist publications in monastic libraries from\n\nwhich the tlacuiloque drew inspiration, Escalante Gonzalbo points to the influence of emblem books and published pharmacopeia of nature,67 as well as of the 1565 edition of Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus, by the bishop Olaus Magnus. The author explores the formal analogies with these sources, and analyzes their content and meaning to reveal linked messaging that is not neutral but imbued with political and moralizing commentary.\n\nLords: Royal and Sacred Given the attention to elite history, governance, and cosmology in the extant precontact records of Mesoamerica and coeval colonial accounts, it is not surprising that several books in the Florentine Codex are devoted to the lordly class in Aztec society, as well as to the priesthood, divine beings, and the rituals held to honor them. Paradoxically, while Sahagún’s mission was obsessed with eradicating idolatry, in the encyclopedic project he preserves those same “idols,” methodically, but not always objectively, documenting the indigenous Mesoamerican pantheon in order to create a kind of missionaries’ guidebook to the Aztec supernatural world. Sahagún intended the Florentine Codex to serve as one of several “weapons” to fight the devil, under whose dominion idolatry was practiced.68 The three chapters in the section “Lords: Royal and Sacred” interrogate the transformations that occurred between the indigenous and the European prototypes of gods and kings and their depictions in Sahagún’s manuscripts. These authors suggest varied motives for the Aztec deities assuming more humanlike representations, while addressing the core issue of the gods’ ontology, or how divinity (the complex Nahuatl term teotl) was understood, even when filtered through a Christian perspective. Eloise Quiñones Keber undertakes a comparative study of the representation of Aztec deities and their calendrical festivals as they evolved from the Primeros memoriales to the Florentine Codex twenty years later. In the weaving together of memory, oral testimony, and the mnemonic prompts provided by the “ancient paintings,” Sahagún’s team gathered information about the attire worn by each of the deities, their perceived powers, and their ritual roles. Quiñones Keber reconstructs how and why the descriptions of the gods expanded to their more fulsome treatment in the Florentine Codex, focusing on the evolution of the earth and corn goddess Chicomecoatl (Seven Serpent). The author also analyzes the increased extravagance\n\nand complexity of the veintena, or twenty-­day festival, as practiced in the martial ceremonies of the Mexica capital. In exploring the disparity between the Aztec kings and the supernaturals in the illustrated manuscripts attributed to Sahagún, Elizabeth Hill Boone traces the continuities and ruptures with the antecedents available to the Franciscan and his team. Royal lords easily migrated almost verbatim from the flat, ideoplastic images of precontact annals histories to the folios produced by Sahagún’s team of Nahua artists. In contrast, the representations of Aztec gods required scribes and artists to innovate from bicultural models. Sixteenth-­century publications on the pagan gods offered appropriate templates for the textual information on their taxonomy, appearance, and physical attributes, referring to both pictorial models from indigenous codices and manuals of classical deities. In the transfer to the European mimetic canon, Boone concludes that Aztec deities were severed from their divinatory preconquest meaning, yielding “simple visual representations of anthropomorphic beings.” The anthropomorphism of the godly images is further explored by Guilhem Olivier, who probes the delicate semantic and conceptual overlap between the humanity of the gods and the divinization of mortals as manifest in the Florentine Codex. In the search for an antecedent, Olivier points to the theory of euhemerism, from the Greek Euhemerus of the fourth century BCE. As Quiñones Keber and Boone also recognize, the equivalency of Aztec deities to their classical counterparts was intended not only to enhance the reader’s familiarity with a known European entity but also to diminish the divinity of the indigenous gods. Although perhaps a successful reductive strategy, this process was never one of complete erasure, as Olivier demonstrates with his painstaking analysis of the multivalent term teotl (plural teteo), often translated as “god.” Teotl had a wide semantic range, referring to something marvelous or one imbued with solar energy (tonalli), a significance that allowed for the assimilation of the European newcomers at contact to be perceived as teteo, connecting with observations made by Terraciano in chapter 3.69\n\nOrdering the Cosmos The chapters in this next section rest on a fundamental tenet of the Nahua worldview, that of cosmic order. One of the awesome responsibilities of the Nahua governing class was to maintain an equilibrium between the human Introduction • 15\n\nand the supernatural realms, a balance that ensured a predictable rotation of the universe and dependable provisions for life. An order-­disorder dialectic framed Nahua cognitive structures, social interactions, ritual behavior, morality, and even the animacy with which painted images were endowed. Order in the Nahua world was menaced routinely by the ecological challenges of the lacustrine environs of Mexico City–­Tenochtitlan. Water, both an essential life-­ giving entity yet a deadly force, had to be properly managed. Barbara E. Mundy links the relationship of such natural threats as floods to the authority of Mexica leaders, who were perceived as appropriate custodians of water management. The author highlights the propitiatory offerings and sacrifices to petition and control water-­related threats that occurred at the ceremonial site of Pantitlan, an anomalous whirlpool-­spring in Lake Texcoco. Mundy also investigates a second aberrant phenomenon, the furry aquatic creature known as acuitlachtli (water bear), a type of nutria that was equally transgressive in its hybridity, habitat, and the danger it posed to the city’s water supply. Both the ritual site and the animal occupied liminal zones, representing the kind of eruption that indigenous leaders were charged to eliminate or minimize in their efforts to sustain a precarious cosmos. Molly H. Bassett similarly erases the Western boundary between the natural and the supernatural in the Nahua lifeworld. In a bold proposal, she argues that “nature” provided a template for a Nahua way of clustering knowledge: literally and figuratively conceived of as a quimilli, or bundle (a unit of twenty). Bassett explores one of the sacred bundles, the tlaquimilolli, conceptualized as a temple-­mountain, not only as biologically and socially essential, but also as an embodiment of divine forces. Another example, the ocelotl bundle, is more hypothetical, but the author provides evidence for the potency of the spotted jaguar pelage as an organizing principle and a sign of sacred and political power. Bassett’s project resonates with Olivier’s contention that although the structural clustering of the Aztec deities in the Florentine Codex conforms to an overarching Roman pantheon, we need to investigate alternative autochthonous taxonomies.70 The permeable membrane between the interlocking human and sacred spheres is also a foundational idea in Diana Magaloni Kerpel’s essay on the expressive carriers of Nahua knowledge from the “other side,” crossing time,\n\n16 • Kevin Terraciano\n\nspace, and degrees of animacy. The author explores spoken word and painted image in the Florentine Codex as creative acts, divinely generated and in some cases displaying a “living presence.”71 Images could be embodiments of the sacred, thus becoming more than just a representation.72 To reveal the layered meanings of ritual discourse, as well as in the Florentine’s imagistic sign system, she uses the Tzeltal Maya metaphor of a flower’s “unfolding” with all of its sensory implications, as recorded by Pedro Pitarch. Magaloni Kerpel also applies her understanding of the pigments used in the Florentine Codex to support the tenacity with which the tlacuiloque continued to perceive images as signifying vehicles with their own palette and material makeup.\n\nSocial Discourse and Deviance The spoken word, and its power to communicate knowledge in a culture that valued orality above all, was also crucial to maintaining stability in an inherently disorderly world. In this final section, “Social Discourse and Deviance,” words are shown to exert so much weight that they bear authority over the Nahua body politic. These chapters also underscore the composite, often contested, nature of pictorial representation when caught between two discrete cultural and religious systems. Whereas pictures in other encyclopedic manuscripts, such as the Codex Mendoza, discussed before, juxtapose indigenous pictorial models with Spanish alphabetic script,73 the images in the Florentine more commonly conflate diverse systems of representation to create new syntheses within competing prescriptive norms in a multiethnic society. If the elite played a central role in maintaining cosmic order, as Mundy makes clear in the previous section, they manifested this fundamental responsibility in their cultivated mastery over rhetoric and the esoteric knowledge it encapsulated. Jeanette Favrot Peterson explores the most formal of the discourses, known as the huehuetlatolli (speech of the elders), that transmitted Nahua values and beliefs to the next generation. Sahagún recognized the metaphorical elegance of these orations as well as their didactic utility early in his career. Although the Nahuatl texts constitute some of the most authentic material in the Florentine Codex, paradoxically, the huehuetlatolli and prayers were regularly appropriated for the mendicants’ sermons. Christian scenes were similarly integrated into\n\nthe mixed syntax of the black-­and-­white images in Book 6, ironically sacralizing Nahua rhetoric. Similarly, Lisa Sousa reveals the variety of strategies in Book 10 deployed by the indigenous authors and artists to retain Nahua values while adhering in part to new Christian prescriptions of good and evil in the sections on social deviants. The Nahuatl text articulates traditional ideals of what constituted morality, employing verbal metaphors of speech and flowers. The more hybrid images adopt certain European style traits and figural forms that either condemn or condone certain behaviors, while signaling speech and flower metaphors or adding new information featuring Nahua glyphic elements. The figures of the so-­ called prostitute (ahuiani) and adulteress (tetzauhcioatl), for example, are shown standing precariously on, or holding, water (the atl glyph). The water glyphs operate phonetically as well as symbolically, reinforcing the censorious Nahua attitude toward women whose deviant behavior was considered fluid, irresponsible, and ultimately a threat to the social, economic, and political order. There is no more dramatic disjunction between the Spanish and Nahuatl texts in the Florentine Codex than those found in chapter 27 of Book 10. Ellen T. Baird compares Sahagún’s Spanish lament at the status of mendicant affairs regarding their indigenous charges with the parallel Nahuatl texts that steadily enumerate anatomical parts. Although the two textual narratives reveal a kind of split agenda, the images manage to bridge or comment on both texts. The visualization of severed body parts mirrors Sahagún’s cognizance of the increasing dissolution of the Nahua body politic in the face of colonial threats and natural disasters. Baird parses, in both the written and pictorial elements of the Florentine, the order-disorder dialectic as it played out within a New Spain reeling from the impact of recurrent, deadly plagues. The contributors to this volume share a genuine and deep respect for the authors and artists of the Florentine Codex, who compiled such a monumental encyclopedia of Nahua culture in a time of crisis. Not only are all thirteen chapter the product of collegial exchanges within our community of scholars; in addition, they acknowledge the work and insights that preceded our own. We hope that our present volume will encourage others to appreciate the “treasure” that we now call the Florentine Codex.\n\nNotes I thank Jeanette Peterson for her many contributions to this introduction and for the extensive comments, suggestions, edits, and additions she has made to multiple drafts.

Painted by Fernando Gallego between 1483 and 1486, the extant portion of the original dome is populated with a zodiacal mix of fantastic creatures and accurately plotted constellations (fig. 1.1).1 The celestial signs in what has popularly come to be called the Cielo de Salamanca can be traced to Islamic and classical models that Gallego creatively combined from multiple sources.2 Among his prototypes are the medieval ink drawings of the constellations based on Islamic iconography that were used to teach astronomy at Salamanca, as well as the traditional globes illustrating the Islamic signs of the zodiac, so popular in fifteenth-­century Spain.3 Additional models have been traced to Italian and Northern European graphics, such as the woodcuts from Hygin’s Poeticon astronomicon of 1482 and various editions of the Triumphs of Petrarch.4 No single source, however, can adequately account for all of Gallego’s inventive, even inverted, variations. Gallego’s artistic independence, quite as freewheeling as the airborne constellations that spin across the picture plane, can be productively compared with the creativity displayed by the indigenous painters of the Florentine Codex. What also might have caught Sahagún’s eye as he gazed upward to Gallego’s mural is the Latin inscription that frames the circumference of this star map. The inscription marks the limits, both physical and conceptual, of the\n\ncelestial scene. The biblical text quotes Psalm 8: “When I look up at the heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars set in their place by thee.”5 The order imposed by the linear-­reading pattern of the quotation, as much as its message, suggests to the viewer that the firmament, even the passage of time itself, is in the hands of a divine sovereign. An audience from Sahagún’s time would have appreciated the differences between the word-­ signs and the picture-­signs, whether or not they were fully legible; at the very least, the lofty location of the mural evoked an appropriately heavenly scene and echoed the learned ambiance of the academic library, considered to be a “temple of knowledge.” To the educated, Latinate spectator, both systems of communication would have been recognizable. Just as in this ceiling mural, in which Gallego deftly reconciles several epistemological systems within the scaffolding of Christian tenets, so the Florentine Codex’s scribes and artists negotiate between several semantic and representational systems. This feat was not unusual for individuals immersed in the social, religious, intellectual, and aesthetic crosscurrents of early modern Spain and New Spain. For both the Spanish painter and the Florentine Codex team, their projects were an exercise in transmission and translation on several levels, adapting and recombining old and contemporary, classical and Renaissance, pagan and Christian, alphabetic text and pictorial imagery. The dialectics of reading and viewing conflated word and image and mixed the profane with the sacred. In this and other ways developed in this chapter, the Gallego 21\n\nfresco acts as an apt metaphor for the formidable task confronted by Sahagún and offers us an entry point into the issues of translatability that Sahagún and his indigenous team of collaborators undertook in producing the Historia general de las cosas de Nueva España, terminating in the Florentine Codex. The conjecture that Sahagún passed a portion of his student days at the University of Salamanca is based on an offhand remark by Gerónimo de Mendieta and on the close academic ties between the Franciscan monastery in Salamanca, where Sahagún took his vows, and the famed university.6 His broad education in the liberal arts and theology illuminates his objectives and the manner in which he packaged his information in the Historia general. Like Gallego, Sahagún was nurtured in a cosmopolitan university city and a multicultural milieu that profoundly shaped his worldview.7 Moreover, the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries witnessed a flood of new publications. By 1500, Spain had multiple printing presses (Salamanca alone had eleven registered printers) that in two decades produced over 1,307 books.8 Sahagún had access to much of the world in print. In this same time period, the advent of printing accelerated acts of translation, acts that could be heard and seen almost everywhere in Castile. The university encouraged philological studies in languages from Aramaic to Greek; the production of dictionaries and polyglot bibles was being actively pursued; and the visual landscape of Spain continued to be a heterodox combination of artistic traditions, from North African tiles and mudéjar wooden-­inlay ceilings to the Italianate facades that increasingly graced palaces and civic buildings. As Salamanca was situated on one of the pilgrimage routes to Santiago de Compostela, the community participated in the string of art fairs in which imported books, prints, paintings, and decorative arts were sold duty-­free.9 Sahagún could not have been immune to this intoxicating mix of the foreign and the familiar, a potent brew of intercultural expressions that must have rendered the friar more receptive to the alterity of the New World. The diverse modes of translation, indeed the very translatability of the Florentine Codex, underpin this chapter. Both Sahagún and his Nahua collaborators encountered the challenges of translation while trying to bridge their discrete worldviews. As do other of the volume chapters, I attend to the interface of the Florentine texts and pictures and probe questions raised by the almost 2,500 images 22 • Jeanette Favrot Peterson\n\nin books that Sahagún called “muy historiados,” or lavishly illustrated.10 I argue that the Florentine is as much a pictorial as a textual compendium. This essay also explores the rationale for including the plethora of images as well as their sources and function, issues that require historiographic hindsight. With the surfeit of scholarship on the textual content of the Florentine Codex, when did the Florentine’s images begin to be analyzed seriously, why have they been sidelined as mere illustrations, and how do they function as carriers of meaning? Are the associated paintings complementary to the text, contradictory, or are they entirely new creations quite independent of their textual matrix?\n\nThe Dialectics of Translation Translation always entails movement as texts and images are transposed through time, space, and the pen or brush of the human mediator, promoting, in every case, changes and innovations both overt and subtle. These shifts are foregrounded throughout the production of the Historia general, as the transmission of indigenous knowledge was passed from oral testimony to an alphabetic record; from Nahuatl speakers to bi- or trilingual scribes conversant in Spanish and Latin; from painted pre-­Hispanic scroll or flat cloth (lienzo) to a Westernized book format; from machine-­printed models to hand-­crafted pictures. In transit across language, media, and cultural dimensions, expressive modalities were displaced, reconfigured, and recontextualized, thus acquiring new signification. Given these translational shifts, to what degree can scholars today fully appreciate the sixteenth-­ century meaning and intent of the Florentine’s texts and images? This question touches on the fundamental concern of cultural incommensurability, particularly when separated by some four and a half centuries. Said another way, can a modern-­day historian overcome the challenges of decoding a colonial document and its claims to record memories of a preconquest past?11 Alessandra Russo’s use of the term “untranslatable image” is applicable to this inquiry, not to imply that cultural and linguistic differences are irreconcilable, but rather to emphasize the ongoing and dynamic process of translation: the discovery of the “infinite possibilities at play during the passages from one artistic world to another.”12 There is no presumption here that we can entirely untangle the indigenous and Hispanic worldviews embedded in the Florentine Codex, but we can situate the\n\nFigure 1.2.

To one degree or another, all the volume authors probe the intertextual relationships and ask how the images are related to the accompanying language texts, as well as how the imagery may signify differently. Although its bilingual words and pictures are sometimes referred to as three “texts,” one needs to recognize the multivalence of the image, or the “suggestive intricacies” of the pictorial component, as Nicholas Thomas puts it.13 Both texts and images can breed ambiguous readings, and both entail the acts of “reading” and seeing, but images are more evocative in their sensory capacity, and they possess wider interpretative latitude, somewhat analogous to Gallego’s painted\n\nconstellations in his Salamanca sky. The celestial signs in Gallego’s mural provoke wonder in their delicate hues and curvilinear posturing; they also incorporate multiple cultural and stylistic traditions in contrast with the enframing ribbon of Latin text that anchors the scene to a single biblical source. Similarly, in the Florentine Codex the images betray layered spatial and temporal dimensions, readily sliding across and combining formal and iconographic conventions. A majority of the narrative or “primary” pictures (ca. 1,860) in the Florentine Codex occupy rectangular, black-­ framed enclosures that set them off spatially from the double columns of alphabetic lettering, a format that mimics the typography of a printed book (fig. 1.2). The formal Images in Translation • 23\n\nisolation of the pictures in the page layout, as well as the mimetic and illusionistic nature of many of the images, speaks to their resonance with European traditions.
