        "text": "Who has not heard of Neil Gaiman? Or Sandman series? In fact, a while ago, I was reading The Japanese Lover by Isabel Ellande, where the first few pages of the novel referred to works of Neil Gaiman and Tolkien (hush hush, that book is still a work-in-progress and I hope to write a book review of that also soon).\n\nI am not really sure if my book review – this post – will give due credit to the likes of such contemporary authors having a huge fan base. But frankly, this one is my first book by Neil Gaiman, and selected especially because I remembered seeing a movie by the same name ages ago approx 10 years back when I was in college and had lot of free time at hand. Time has changed and while I was wondering which book to pick next, somehow this book’s recommendation showed on my page and I was like why not! A proper fantasy tale is what I had not indulged in a long time (I am an absolute no for cheesy rom-coms, but otherwise I am good to try any book which is not too boring in the start).\n\nStardust is the description of fantasy faerie world but not in the sense of goody good children’s book. Haven’t you as an adult wondered how it would be like to be on a real cloud with that one person, simile of being in love to be on cloud number nine. I know I once was! Old times. But why not? One should feel happy while living in practical world and just for some time go back to those happily ever after moments. Did you feel like that after reading this book? Please let me know in comments and suggest which book I should pick up next.\n\nKeep watching my blog for more book reviews!\n\nRating: 9/10"
