        "text": "The star of the danmei wuxia series ‘Word of Honor’ has catapulted a collection of Neil Gaiman stories onto the Chinese fiction charts.\n\nBy Porter Anderson, Editor-in-Chief | @Porter_Anderson\n\nStar Power Propels Neil Gaiman’s ‘Smoke and Mirrors’\n\nIn an unusual amount of change for China’s bestseller lists, nine books entered the charts in June—six titles appearing for the first time and three returning.\n\nNeil Gaiman’s 1998 short story collection Smoke and Mirrors: Short Fictions and Illusions. (This is HarperCollins’ 2021 English edition. Should you be interested in an audiobook edition, “Neil himself” reads the work here.) was published in March by Jiangsu Literature & Art Press and was understood to inhabit a niche appeal, as imported fantasy writings tend to do in China.\n\nNot making particularly big strides in the market at first, our Beijing OpenBook associates tell us, the anthology in the late spring drew the attention of 30-year-old actor and Shanghai Theatrical Academy graduate Zhang Zhehan.\n\nHis work as Zhou Zishu/Zhou Zi Su in the television series Word of Honor has catapulted him to a new level of fame in the Chinese market this year. (Both Netflix and Prime Video from Amazon carry the 36-episode opening season with English subtitles, distributed by Jetsen Husashi Media.)\n\nJust to be clear, Word of Honor is not a Gaiman piece. It’s based on a novel, Faraway Wanderers, by a female author who writes under the pseudonym Priest.\n\nThe work is based in two popular genres. One is wuxia, which revolves around ancient Chinese martial arts. The other is danmei, a term that means there’s an indulgence in beauty–specifically in male-male relationships. It’s typically targeted to female audiences but also is understood to be a form of expression avidly valued in cultures that don’t support more openly developed homoerotic themes.\n\nZhang, evidently having come across Jiangsu’s publication of the Gaiman anthology, on June 14 posted an Instagram message which contained four words relative to four short stories in Smoke and Mirrors.\n\nFans “decoded” the message—Zhang starred in a 2016 television mystery series called Decoded—and the resulting attention to Gaiman’s book led to quick sellouts across digital retailers in China.\n\nUpdate August 16: Since this article was written on August 2, Zhang has come under intense state-media criticism and a reported loss of upcoming projects and lucrative brand endorsements. Around August 13, reports surfaced, including this Reuters article of August 14, saying that the actor had visited the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo in 2018 and 2019, posting photos of himself there on social media.\n\nThe Shinto shrine has long been a point of contention with East Asian neighbors of Japan because of Tokyo’s former colonization aggression (including the South Korean comfort women). The shrine commemorates those who died in wars in which Japan was involved and includes the names of 14 World War II convicted war criminals.\n\nAs Walter Sim at the Straits Times writes, Zhang has apologized and said that he was ignorant of the controversy around the shrine, the Chinese Association of Performing Arts has called for a boycott of his work. Companies that formally were in endorsement agreements with him have canceled. Those companies include Coca-Cola in the States and the Danish jeweler Pandora.\n\nAs Ju-min Park writes for Reuters in a separate article on August 13, even the Japanese defense minister was criticized this month by South Korea for visiting the shrine, and in 2013, Japan’s former prime minister Shinzo Abe drew complaints from Beijing, Seoul, and Washington for making such a visit. It’s unclear at this point how much impact this political gaffe might have on the actor’s fan base or celebrity influence.\n\nMore Fiction Developments in the Charts\n\nIf Gaiman’s book took top new-to-the-charts honors at No. 7, Nanpai Sanshu’s Personal Notes of Wu Xie was close behind at No. 10.\n\nIn the case of Nanpai’s book, the approach to the bestseller list was fast. The book was published in May by Jincheng Press and is a follow-up to another popular title, The Lost Tomb.\n\nOur colleagues at Beijing OpenBook point to an artful use of such an existing fan base in two other works, The Mystery of the Alphabet (Henan Literature & Art Press) by Seiichirou Oyama at No. 18 and Aye (Chang Jiang Press) by Yin Luxing.\n\nThe Seiichirou work is new, and the author is sometimes called “the god of short story reasoning for very astute mystery constructions. Short videos have been used to promote this one to faithful mystery consumers.\n\nYin’s Aye began its life as “online literature”—that’s digital-serial writing, of course—where it had the delightful title I Like Your Pheromone.\n\nOur associate Rainy Liu, always perceptive on these subtleties, points out to us that while this book will of course be riding primarily on the popularity of its original digital-serial life (much as, say, Anna Todd’s After series has ridden on its original fandom at Wattpad), a radio-drama edition of I Like Your Pheromone/Aye has been avidly followed since January, with a second season introduced in April.\n\nUtilizing popular actors to voice its roles, that radio drama’s two seasons, as Liu is explaining, created another layer of marketing force for the work, so that the arrival of the book edition from Chang Jiang Press served as an immediately welcomed extension of the brand.\n\nAlso new to the charts in June are 13 Steps (Shanghai Literature & Art Press) by Kazuaki Takano at No. 23 and Sour Plum by Huang San (Jiangsu Literature & Art Press) at No. 27, both doing well on the popularity in the market of campus-based themes for stories.\n\nBelow, then, are OpenBook’s overall lists from June of bestsellers in fiction, nonfiction, and children’s books, followed by its lists of bestselling fiction and nonfiction in China by authors from outside the country.\n\nAt the end of our article, as always, you’ll find notes on how the lists are constructed.\n\nOpenBook’s Fiction Bestsellers, June 2021\n\nMay 2021 Ranking June 2021 Ranking ISBN Release Date Title (Translated) Author Chinese Publisher 1 1 9787536692930 2008-01 The Three-Body Problem Liu Cixin Chongqing Publishing House 3 2 9787536693968 2008-05 The Dark Forest Liu Cixin Chongqing Publishing House 6 3 9787229030933 2010-11 Death’s End Liu Cixin Chongqing Publishing House 5 4 9787540487645 2018-06 Moments We Shared Zhang Jiajia Hunan Literature & Art Press 7 5 9787530215593 2017-06 To Live Yu hua Beijing October Art & Literature Publishing House 11 6 9787544291170 2017-08 One Hundred Years of Solitude (50th Anniversary Edition) Gabriel García Márquez Nan Hai Publishing Co.

It functions somewhat as Nielsen and NDP do from the West, and Nielsen Book Research International has worked with OpenBook in Asian operations. With authoritative data and information resources, OpenBook is able to deliver consulting service to partners who would like to explore the Chinese book market and identify suitable partners.\n\nJiang Boyan LLC advises authors and right’s holders on global intellectual property and investment opportunities.\n\nAs of January 1, 2020, OpenBook monitored more than 10,000 online and offline bookstores.\n\nThe online channel includes digital retailers such as large self-operated online stores, platform stores, and small- and medium-sized stores. The offline channels include 4,495 bookstores. Coverage includes most of the state-owned and influential privately owned bookstores in 30 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Tibet are not included in OpenBook’s system.\n\nIn 2019, OpenBook tracked around 71.72 billion RMB in sales (US$10.1 billion).\n\nRetail outlets include:\n\nTraditional bookstores\n\nSupermarkets\n\nCampus bookstores\n\n“Professional” stores, said to be small stores with a specific industrial or trade focus\n\nAirport stores\n\nIn addition, OpenBook is drawing data from online bookstores of three main types:\n\nThe “Tmall” stores of Alibaba (Tmall is described as a marketplace of companies that create storefronts online to sell products including books)\n\nThe “JingDong” Stores of JD.com (similar to Tmall as a marketplace of both individual companies and bookstores operated by JD.com)\n\nTen independent online bookselling retailers\n\nChina has 500 or more publishers in operation today. Most of them, Jiang Boyan CEO James Bryant clarifies, are government-owned. Private publishers are required to generate ISBNs for their titles from a publishing company that is government-owned—which, in other words, creates a system in which all ISBNs are in one way or another registered through government channels. The government approves each book published in China."
