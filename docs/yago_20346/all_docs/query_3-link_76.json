        "text": "QuickFacts\n\nFormat: Short story\n\nAuthor: Neil Gaiman\n\nTaken From: Fragile Things: Short Fictions & Wonders by Neil Gaiman\n\nGenre: Fiction\n\nLength: 4 pages\n\nMy rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars\n\nSpoiler Alert! Do not read this review if you do not wish to hear any plot details.\n\nYou may notice that I have been focusing, largely, in my recent reviews, on the concept of surprise, and on the effort of a piece to tell its audience something without him or her realizing exactly what that thing is until the end of the story. The short story, “Other People” by Neil Gaiman is no exception to this theme, and the more I pick out random stories and discover this same trend, the more I realize that it is a common convention of much literature.\n\nIn Gaiman’s “Other People,” the secret is that the demon at the beginning of the story is not really a demon, but a regular man who had been sent to Hell, and that the protagonist that we follow is soon to become yet another “demon.” The story points to this outcome with certain phrases such as “time is fluid here,” and “flayed at some point in the distant past.” The plot conveys these, yet still keeps its secret until the end because, first off, these references are vague, but also because they are revealed out of order.\n\n“Time is fluid here” is spoken by the demon at the very beginning of the story, in fact, it is the very first sentence. This phrase, which refers to two things: first that time means nothing there, and second, that our protagonist will eventually morph into a part of this place, is said before the reader knows anything about the world of the story or its nature. Since we have no background and have not yet witnessed the protagonist being tortured for thousands of years, this statement means nothing to us at the time that we read it, and we are not likely to revisit it until we have finished reading the story completely. Likewise, when Gaiman refers to the demon as “flayed at some time in the distant past,” it is referring to the fact that each person sent to hell is tortured and flogged, just as we are about to witness the protagonist being. That is just the problem though, it hasn’t happened yet, and so the reader does not connect the two in his mind.\n\nEven the comment uttered by the protagonist when he says “that’s inhuman” in response to the demon heating the cat of nine tails in the brazier has a foreshadowing aura. Once the reader has reached the end, he takes it to mean that the experience endured in hell turns each man into a man no longer. This concept is further accentuated by these descriptions of the demon:\n\n“’Now,’ said the demon, in a voice that carried with it no sorrow, no relish, only a dreadful flat resignation, ‘you will be tortured.'”\n\nand\n\n“It stared at him with expressionless eyes, and he was forced to look away.”\n\nThe ending is executed in a succinct and effective way, merely mentioning that the man is now alone, and that another walks into the room before the first utters the familiar words “time is fluid here.” This repetition serves to explain to the reader who the protagonist has become, and it is shocking to realize that he must now fit the description of the demon at the beginning:\n\n“The demon was rake-thin, and naked. It was deeply scarred, and it appeared to have been flayed at some time in the distant past. It had no ears, no sex. Its lips were thin and ascetic, and its eyes were a demon’s eyes: they had seen too much and gone too far, and under their gaze he felt less important than a fly.”\n\nThat he could have been dehumanized to this extent is a scary thought. The interesting thing is that, if you really think about it, the story never really claims he has become a demon. This goes to show just how powerful the method of implication is. It is simply the repetition of that one phrase that triggers the horror a reader experiences at the end of the story. There is no description of the outcome at all.\n\nThis is not the only ends that repetition is utilized to reach, however. It is used to a greater extent to convey the nature of the man’s torture, and this is one of its strong points. It even takes the time to not only explain that the man is forced to remember all of the bad things he has done in his life, but also that it is different each time he does it. The first time, the man is still prideful, and tries to lie himself out of the allegations against him. Each time, he is embarrassed to have to admit the truth of his ways. The second time the demon forces him to repeat his sins, he knows he cannot lie his way out, and instead approaches each response with a sense of self-loathing. The story states,\n\n“There was a self-knowledge there he had not had the first time, which somehow made everything worse.”\n\nThe third time contains more than a twist on the experience, it provides actual new information. This time, he is presented with the unknown consequences of his actions. The demon informs him about all the people he has hurt, and the overall effect he had on the rest of the world, a torture all on its own. The last time through, the man is forced to recite all the information by heart, a concept that would make any reader shudder. Guilt without hope of forgetting.\n\nThis use of repetition goes to show one of the themes of the story, which is that the mind is stronger than the body. There is a dualism of sorts in place here, in the fact that the man is first physically tortured, and then mentally. Though he denies it at first, in the end he admits that “The physical torture had been kinder.” The very concept that it is mental torture that is the main fare of Hell is clear enough to make this theme prominent.\n\nThe only weakness I might point out is that this story makes the reader feel as though he is missing out on a lot of plot. Since it covers thousands of years in only two or three pages, there is much that is not described, and this is a rather obvious fact. For example, if the man is really in as much pain as the story makes it seem, one would think that, at some point, the man would rush to one of the many torture devices lining the walls, and attempt suicide. Such an event might even add scare factor if he were to discover that he is unable to kill himself in this place since he is already dead. No such occurrence is mentioned or hinted at, however, and neither is any other. What the reader is presented with is merely a bare framework for a much bigger story, and this can be frustrating if kept in mind while reading.\n\nRegardless of this aspect, however, “Other People” by Neil Gaiman is a superior story for its length, and this one, in particular, reminded me of the vignettes of David Eagleman, of which I am rather fond. One of his vignettes, Descent of Species, is reviewed on this blog. This comparison comes about largely because both deal with stories of the afterlife, and do it in a similar manner. “Other People,” though, is unique from any of Eagleman’s work, containing a solid premise, a horrifying twist, and a ring of truth."
