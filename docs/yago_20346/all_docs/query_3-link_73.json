        "text": "Sci-Fi London has announced that award-winning author Neil Gaiman (The Sandman, American Gods, Coraline) is set to judge the shortlisted entrants for this year’s 48 Hour Film Challenge, which takes place this coming weekend.\n\n“Neil Gaiman’s genius for astonishing writing is respected by an entire generation of readers and cinema-goers – for the participants in this year’s challenge, knowing that their work might be viewed by such a unique talent will be a huge motivation,” states Festival Director Louis Savy.\n\nJoining Gaiman on the jury are London Film Festival programmer and Co-Founder of the London Short Film Festival, Kate Taylor; award-winning film composer Simon Boswell (Shallow Grave, Hardware); BBC’s Inside Science presenter Dr Adam Rutherford and Film Editor Colin Goudie (Monsters, Rogue One).\n\nThe 48 Hour Film Challenge takes place Saturday 11 April – Monday 13 April 2015. Participants register online at 48hour.sci-fi-london.com and entry is FREE. Teams receive a randomly generated film title, line of dialogue and a prop list at the BFI on the Saturday morning at 9.00am. The winning film will be screened alongside the festival’s closing night feature film on 6 June 2015.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&list=PL18yMRIfoszFLSgML6ddazw180SXMvMz5&v=pnc360pUDRI"
