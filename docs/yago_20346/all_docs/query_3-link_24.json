He manages to balance elements of fantasy, horror, and wit seamlessly, without clutching to the familiar clichés one would expect from those genres.\n\nHe has won several awards, including the Hugo, Nebula, and Bram Stoker awards, as well as the Newbery and Carnegie medals. His stories are filled with compelling characters and intricate plots that take you to surreal, and sometimes nightmarish, worlds.\n\nMany of Gaiman’s works have been adapted into film and television, including his fantasy novel Stardust, which starred Robert De Niro, Michelle Pfeiffer and Claire Danes, and the novel Coraline, which was adapted into a stop-motion feature starring Dakota Fanning and Teri Hatcher.\n\nBelow you will find a list of my favorite Neil Gaiman novels for adults. Enjoy!\n\nAmerican Gods\n\nNeverwhere\n\nOcean at the End of the Lane\n\nAnansi Boys\n\nBad Omens"
