        "meta_description": "En 2005, Neil Gaiman et Dave McKean, connus pour leurs albums pour enfants, s’associaient à nouveau pour concevoir un film, MirrorMask, à la sollicitation de The Jim Henson Company, qui espérait renouer avec le succès de leurs films de fantasy des années 1980 (The Dark Crystal et Labyrinth). La même année, le duo d’artistes signait une adaptation de leur film sous la forme d’un album mêlant textes, dessins originaux et photogrammes extraits du long-métrage. Ce qui est en jeu ici est donc l’adaptation d’un film (constitué d’une succession d’images animées) en un album, dont l’esthétique joue ici sur la superposition de textes et d’images. L’article explore les enjeux narratifs et esthétiques de cette « translation intermédiale », et la façon dont l’adaptation inscrit MirrorMask dans un réseau de références partagées par les jeunes lecteurs, qui ne sont pas nécessairement les spectateurs du film source. L’adaptation du film en album renforce encore la dimension méta-narrative du récit, déjà présente dans l’œuvre source : l’album donne à voir des images tirées d’un film qui raconte l’histoire d’une adolescente perdue dans un monde qu’elle a créé par la force de ses textes et de ses dessins. Le processus de traduction intersémiotique met encore davantage en lumière les caractéristiques post-modernes du travail de McKean et Gaiman : la fragmentation, l’hybridation et l’excès.",

        "text": "2For all its technical challenges and financial difficulties, MirrorMask, designed and directed by Dave McKean, hit the big screen in 2005. Because it was praised by many critics, the film avoided direct-to-DVD release, as was initially planned, and was eventually screened in movie theatres. Just like Labyrinth, MirrorMask tells the coming-of-age story of a frustrated teenage girl who dreams of living her supposedly “true” life far from the family home. Fifteen-year-old Helena makes up stories with her drawings, which she hangs on the walls of her bedroom. She finds refuge in her imagination and thus believes she can escape from the obligations of her parents’ occupation as circus performers and managers. After an argument with her daughter, the mother falls sick and needs to be hospitalised. Helena, overwhelmed with anxiety and guilt, leaves Brighton and enters the City of Light, whose topography and architecture are quite similar to the dreamlike landscapes she draws. Helena is told that the City of Light has been threatened by growing darkness since its princess rebelled against her tyrannical mother and ran away, so she sets herself the mission of restoring the balance of that fanciful and fantastic world. The rebellious princess, wearing a magic mask with a reflective surface like a mirror, manages to cross the boundary between reality and imagination. Anti-Helena, as the princess is referred to, is Helena’s inverted image, like her reflection in a looking-glass. She usurps Helena’s place in Brighton while the British teenager is paradoxically faced with real-life issues and responsibilities in the fantasy world.\n\n4To provide tentative answers to those questions, my demonstration will focus on three key moments in the plot. I shall first try to determine if the phenomenon at stake in the adaptation of MirrorMask (as a film) into MirrorMask (as a book) is a case of “intermedial translation” (Louvel 112) and, secondly, if it is an example of “anti-adaptation”, a phrase coined by Jan Baetens in his study on novelisation, i.e. the novelistic adaptation of a film or of its screenplay (Baetens 17). Although the theoretical frameworks defined by Louvel and Baetens are the most obvious ones to examine a corpus whose very nature questions the relation between a (supposedly original) text and its visual interpretation(s) by a graphic artist, I shall demonstrate that such an ambitious experimental undertaking as MirrorMask does not entirely comply with such frameworks and requires another critical lens. I shall thus eventually examine how Gaiman and McKean, in self-adapting their film, managed to give life to a more comprehensive artwork whose very identity is based on mixed media (i.e., the combination of multiple media, in each of the two creations under scrutiny, in our case). To do so, I shall rely on Linda Hutcheon’s seminal theory of adaptation as well as her definition of postmodernism to try and understand what novel and innovative dimension is brought to such cultural productions for children as the two MirrorMasks.\n\nAn intermedial translation?\n\n5It is first and foremost necessary to look closely at the “aesthetic and formal connections” (Louvel 112, my translation) between the film and the book. At first sight, it appears that the two media rely on the same distinctive techniques: the collage and assemblage of different graphic objects (photographs, photograms, original drawings, and excerpts from the storyboard). Human characters of flesh and bones wear inexpressive masks made of clay whereas fabulous (drawn) creatures show strongly expressive—and true to life—human faces. Such mashup of heterogeneous forms and materials is meant to convey the hybrid nature of fantastical characters—a penguin-gorilla chimera, for instance (fig. 1)—or the unstable nature of changing adolescent heroes, oscillating between childhood and adulthood. Similarly, the symmetrical, mirror structure of the narrative seems to be identical in both film and book. The story opens and closes with comparable scenes taking place in the family circus. The core story, set in the City of Light, is bracketed by the circus scenes. Despite such obvious formal similarities, the narrative device seems to differ in each version of MirrorMask and appears to be dependent on the medium used.\n\n6A film needs to combine different strategies to make and arrange the images it is made of. In other words, film narrative is based on both mise-en-scène (how the story is shown through the choice of setting, lighting, costumes, acting performances, and camerawork) and editing (how the story is told, how it is structured into scenes and sequences that are assembled to make a coherent whole). What is more, as Linda Hutcheon contends, “being shown a story is not the same thing as being told it […]. With each mode, different things get adapted and in different ways” (Hutcheon 2006, 12). In MirrorMask’s opening sequence, the main protagonist Helena is shown playing with sock puppets (fig. 2).\n\n7Helena uses them to invent stories and she gives them her voice to make them talk together. One sock is white, the other black, to represent the character’s inner contradictions. The puppets work like transitional objects as they enable the teenage girl to express her conflicting feelings. Her drawings in the background serve as the setting for this short theatrical sketch, foreshadowing the urban landscapes she will find in the City of Light. In spite of the obvious mise-en-abyme produced by the puppet show that she performs, Helena is not the narrator of her own story as the images presented to the spectators show more than the girl’s (limited) perception and knowledge. Her mother’s feelings and emotions are also apparent, even when, blinded by her selfish resentment, Helena is supposed to have locked herself in her caravan. The film’s (omniscient) narrator shows more than he tells Helena’s story. Conversely, the opening chapter in the picture book is marked by the invasive presence of the printed text. Although it is told in a book supposedly made of pictures, surprisingly, Helena’s first-person narrative is to be read before it can be seen or watched:\n\nThis is my story about what happened to me […]\n\nIt’s the first story I’ve written down, although sometimes I like to make up stories in my head. (This isn’t a made-up story, though). Normally, what I do best is draw […].\n\nI call this story “MirrorMask” and it is written by me, Helena Campbell. (Gaiman and McKean n.p.)\n\n8Undoubtedly, Helena Campbell is here introduced not only as the first-person narrator of the story but also as its writer and illustrator. The story’s self-reflexivity mirrors the character’s reflection on/of her own self. A specular rhetoric is thus developed on both the thematic and narrative levels, with multiplying mirror images, symbols and metaphors while relying on a more or less symmetrical narrative structure. Adopting the conventions of the book form, Helena divides her tale into chapters, and she signs the story she has authored. More than merely telling a story, she is aware she is writing a book, the very material object the readers are holding in their hands. The text is meant to tell the story thanks to words used as semantic signs but also, and more particularly, as graphic signs, in support of images. Besides telling a story full of twists and turns, the text, in turn, shows the subjectivity of the girl’s narrative. In the first pages, the text is well-ordered and printed in straight lines. However, the more expressive the storytelling gets, the more disorderly the text becomes: the straight lines are replaced by curved, S-shaped lines; the harmony of the lettering is also broken with the gradual use of discordant fonts and sizes; text and image are increasingly intertwined and can no longer be separated.\n\n6 When image and sound merge.\n\n7 « Tout objet dessiné synchronisé avec une note de musique devenait cette musique, et cette musique (...)\n\nAny animated object synchronised with a music note would become the music note and the music note would become the animated object. Synchresis enabled to make the cartoon world dance and sing more easily than the filmed world because the former is more malleable, abstract, and stylised. As a result, the world stopped resisting and surrendered to cartoons’ beat and tune. (My translation)\n\n11In order to examine what is at stake in the art of illustration, Liliane Louvel coins the concept of “intermedial transposition” and, in so doing, she rejects the idea of any hierarchical relationship between text and image (Louvel 61-63). Illustration is not so much about translating one semiotic system (text) into another (image); that process brings to the fore the material specificities of each medium, taking into account their heterogeneous nature, and relies on the collaboration between two means of expression. In the case of MirrorMask, the collaborative work of Gaiman and McKean proves that no particular artform prevails. The visual and narrative aesthetics of both film and book is based on an intricate network of shared visual and textual (self-)references, indiscriminately mixing various media. However, it might be objected that McKean’s images are not meant to illustrate Gaiman’s text, and it remains to be proved that the picture book is indeed derived, or “transposed”, from the supposedly original film. In the end, despite the equal cooperation between text and image (at least in the picture book), in spite of the obvious aesthetic and formal echoes connecting them, are not the two objects but distinct artworks defined by their heterogeneous materiality? If intermedial criticism is useful to understand the result of the collaboration between a writer and an illustrator, the concept of intermedial transposition or translation is not fully operational to examine the work of a duo of artists such as Gaiman and McKean.\n\n12The two versions of MirrorMask can be seen as mirrored creations, initiating a dialogue between two different media (understood here, in the sense used by Louvel, as “material means of expression”, Louvel 63) that are nonetheless connected through their use of images. They possess, however, their own formal idiosyncrasies, somehow imposed by their specific material constraints (sound in the film; text in the book).\n\nAn example of anti-adaptation?\n\n14Interestingly, the tension between the “double”—or “copy”—and the “other” is at the structural and thematic heart of the MirrorMask story. What is at stake here is not the translation of a written text into another written text; neither the finished film nor its screenplay may be considered as the source materials for the picture book. The film did not solely originate from Gaiman’s script, but it also derived from McKean’s storyboard. From the outset, MirrorMask appears to have been a multimedia undertaking. Several media, therefore, serve as sources for the picture book. It consequently seems necessary to take both textual and graphic narrative modes into consideration when analysing MirrorMask as a supposed adaptation. Is it a beautifully crafted copy of an original film then, or else a new artwork entirely, rethinking the form(at) of the story? In the end, can it still be claimed that the book MirrorMask is an adapted text?\n\n16That said, it is difficult to apply Jan Baetens’s “anti-adaptation” theory to MirrorMask. It would be wrong to conclude that the picture book is the “copy” of the film, as the book is far from being the result of an “immediate transfer” from one medium to the other. In his research on novelisation for children, Vincent Ferrier emphasizes the commercial dimension of the books that are usually adapted from blockbuster films and tends to consider most of those objects as by-products of successful franchises:\n\n13 Original text: « [L]orsque le film devient livres pour jeunes, [… l]’objectif premier reste de part (...)\n\n[W]hen a film is turned into books for children, […] the prime objective is to participate in the development of a brand of which the book is only a by-product, thus following the principles of branding, a concept popularized by Naomi Klein. (My translation)\n\n17However, Ferrier qualifies his statement by observing that the commercial dimension of novelisations is not incompatible with literary ambition. The author of a novelised book may try to gain some form of independence from his or her source. Such autonomy can be achieved, Ferrier explains, thanks to an original transformation of the source material (for instance adding educational bonuses, using an unusual and surprising text/image relation, or introducing cinematic effects that cannot be found in the original work). In reaction to Ferrier’s analysis, one might contend that Gaiman and McKean’s picture book is not a commercial product derived from some MirrorMask franchise. As has already been demonstrated, the book does not merely reproduce the film’s main aesthetic and narrative features, but the two artists endeavoured to create something other, using a different medium and relying on different materials. Eventually, one may wonder whether the film might still be considered as the original, or whether it should rather be seen as one expression of the artists’ wider imaginary universe, to be examined on an equal plane with the text-book version.\n\nMirrorMask, self-adaptation, and the recycling of images\n\nMoreover, the literal meaning of palimpsest—altering a medium to create a new work—makes it very similar to a recycling process which can be used for text and art alike. Indeed, collages are made of successive layers which add meaning to the background or the elements they are pasted on. (Gras, n.p.)\n\n23Although the MirrorMask picture book develops its own visual rhetoric and narrative strategies (spatiality and plasticity of the text, conjunctive layout), “showing” or “performing” the same story or “fabula” (Hutcheon 2006, 8-13) as in the film with its own specific graphic tools, it also recycles distinctive features from the film (collage and assemblage, hybridisation and parody). On many levels, MirrorMask can be seen not as a case of “adaptation” strictly speaking but rather as an example of self-adaptation, making McKean’s double creation a very ambiguous and problematic object to analyse and define. More broadly, the book is part of the MirrorMask universe, on the same plane as the film. McKean is here both creator and adapter, in that order. However, if adapting means “appropriating” and “salvaging” the (supposedly) original film (Hutcheon 2006, 20), the MirrorMask picture book may fall short of the definition, as the visual identity of both works is definitely the same, originating in McKean’s experimental imagination.\n\n25It would be wrong to say that the MirrorMask picture book, as a problematic “adapted” text, is the result of a process “creating something new” (20). Yet, something new is indeed created, which above all comes from the reflexive and postmodern dimension of Gaiman and McKean’s collaboration. Postmodern aesthetic is a trademark of Gaiman and McKean’s collaborative works, if not their signature. MirrorMask is a model example of “those almost undefinable and certainly bizarre works” that are the manifestation of Posmodernism as the “site of the struggle of the emergence of something new” (Hutcheon 1988, 4). In the end, what novelty can be brought by self-adaptation is the possibility of crafting double and conjoined artworks."
