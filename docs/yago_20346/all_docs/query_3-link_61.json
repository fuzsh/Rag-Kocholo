        "text": "“When I was a boy, Ray Bradbury picked stories from his books of short stories he thought younger readers might like, and he published them as R Is for Rocket and S Is for Space. Now I was doing the same sort of thing, and I asked Ray if he’d mind if I called this book M Is for Magic. (He didn’t.)” (p. xii)\n\nI’m a big fan of Neil Gaiman’s work and for anyone who is looking for a place to sample Gaiman’s work, M Is for Magic (2007) would be a great place to start. The 11 stories in this collection range from science fiction to fantasy to suspense. I love “The Witch’s Headstone, ” a cunning story with a great ending. I’m also fond of “How to Sell the Ponti Bridge” where a group of con artists listen to a stunning variation on the old selling the Brooklyn Bridge scam. The Ponti Bridge is located on another planet and it consists of gems and diamonds and other precious stones held together by Magic.\n\nM Is for Magic showcases stories with humor, wit, and occasional darkness. And, a great book to read around Halloween! GRADE: A\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS:"
