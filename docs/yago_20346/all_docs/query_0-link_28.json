        "meta_description": "A Short Film About John Bolton is a darkly hip and hilarious film explores the question that torments artists of every medium: \"Where do your ideas come from?\" Renowned artist John Bolton's paintings of voluptuous she-vampire nudes have earned this quiet eccentric a reputation for having a \"damaged imagination.\" BBC radio personality Jonathan Ross buys his pieces, which leads interviewer extraordinaire Marcus Brigstocke to find out what the appeal is in Bolton's beautiful (but terrifying) artwork. Why does Bolton demand that his gallery \"monsterpieces\" speak for themselves? What does he do with that ornamental knife that he carries everywhere? Will Marcus ever learn how to operate the camera?",

        "text": "Neil Gaiman should write and direct some more comedy shorts because this was good. Also, it should go without saying, but John Bolton’s art fucking rules.\n\nEven if it’s not always actually making me laugh, there’s an inherent, wry humor to the mockumentary genre that usually tickles me. It initially reminded me of What We Do in the Shadows because of the dark weirdo fish-out-of-water angle, but it’s really closer tonally to something like Christopher Guest because it also satirizes the absurdity of the art world.\n\nHere, it’s specifically poking fun at how weirdos get exalted to mainstream by people who waste their time and money pretending to like it because of a perceived preordained value of the thing rather than using their own judgment and intuition. Gaiman never makes that critique feel heavy-handed. The focus is on the ridiculous first and foremost."
