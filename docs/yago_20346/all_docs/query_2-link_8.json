        "text": "‘The Wolves in the Walls’ was made into an opera by the Scottish National Theatre in 2006, and ‘Coraline’ was adapted as a musical by Stephin Merritt in 2009.\n\nWriting for Adults\n\nGaiman is the New York Times bestselling author of the novels ‘Neverwhere’ (1995), ‘Stardust’ (1999), the Hugo and Nebula Award-winning ‘American Gods’ (2001), ‘Anansi Boys’ (2005), and ‘Good Omens’ (with Terry Pratchett, 1990), as well as the short story collections ‘Smoke and Mirrors’ (1998) and ‘Fragile Things’ (2006).\n\nHis first collection of short fiction, ‘Smoke and Mirrors: Short Fictions and Illusions,’ was nominated for the UK’s MacMillan Silver Pen Awards as the best short story collection of the year. Most recently, Gaiman was both a contributor to and co-editor with Al Sarrantonio of ‘Stories’ (2010), and his own story in the volume, ‘The Truth Is A Cave In The Black Mountains,’ has been nominated for a number of awards.\n\n‘American Gods’ has just been released in an expanded tenth anniversary edition, and there is an HBO series in the works.\n\nFilm and Television\n\nGaiman wrote the screenplay for the original BBC TV series of ‘Neverwhere’ (1996); Dave McKean’s first feature film, ‘Mirrormask’ (2005), for the Jim Henson Company; and cowrote the script to Robert Zemeckis’s ‘Beowulf.’ He produced ‘Stardust,’ Matthew Vaughn’s film based on Gaiman’s book by the same name.\n\nHe has written and directed two films: ‘A Short Film About John Bolton’ (2002) and Sky Television’s ‘Statuesque’ (2009) starring Bill Nighy and Amanda Palmer.\n\nAn animated feature film based on Gaiman’s ‘Coraline,’ directed by Henry Selick and released in early 2009, secured a BAFTA for Best Animated Film and was nominated for an Oscar in the same category.\n\nGaiman’s 2011 episode of Doctor Who, “The Doctor’s Wife,” caused the Times to describe him as “a hero.”\n\nHow To Talk To Girls At Parties, by Neil Gaiman\n\nHugo Nomination for Best Short Story 2007\n\n\"Come on,\" said Vic. \"It'll be great.\"\n\n\"No, it won't,\" I said, although I'd lost this fight hours ago, and I knew it.\n\n\"It'll be brilliant,\" said Vic, for the hundredth time. \"Girls! Girls! Girls!\" He grinned with white teeth.\n\nWe both attended an all-boys' school in south London. While it would be a lie to say that we had no experience with girls -- Vic seemed to have had many girlfriends, while I had kissed three of my sister's friends -- it would, I think, be perfectly true to say that we both chiefly spoke to, interacted with, and only truly understood, other boys. Well, I did, anyway. It's hard to speak for someone else, and I've not seen Vic for thirty years. I'm not sure that I would know what to say to him now if I did.\n\nWe were walking the backstreets that used to twine in a grimy maze behind East Croydon station -- a friend had told Vic about a party, and Vic was determined to go whether I liked it or not, and I didn't. But my parents were away that week at a conference, and I was Vic's guest at his house, so I was trailing along beside him.\n\n\"It'll be the same as it always is,\" I said. \"After an hour you'll be off somewhere snogging the prettiest girl at the party, and I'll be in the kitchen listening to somebody's mum going on about politics or poetry or something.\"\n\n\"You just have to talk to them,\" he said. \"I think it's probably that road at the end here.\" He gestured cheerfully, swinging the bag with the bottle in it.\n\n\"Don't you know?\"\n\n\"Alison gave me directions and I wrote them on a bit of paper, but I left it on the hall table. S'okay. I can find it.\"\n\n\"How?\" Hope welled slowly up inside me.\n\n\"We walk down the road,\" he said, as if speaking to an idiot child. \"And we look for the party. Easy.\"\n\nI looked, but saw no party: just narrow houses with rusting cars or bikes in their concreted front gardens; and the dusty glass fronts of newsagents, which smelled of alien spices and sold everything from birthday cards and secondhand comics to the kind of magazines that were so pornographic that they were sold already sealed in plastic bags. I had been there when Vic had slipped one of those magazines beneath his sweater, but the owner caught him on the pavement outside and made him give it back.\n\nWe reached the end of the road and turned into a narrow street of terraced houses. Everything looked very still and empty in the Summer's evening. \"It's all right for you,\" I said. \"They fancy you. You don't actually have to talk to them.\" It was true: one urchin grin from Vic and he could have his pick of the room.\n\n\"Nah. S'not like that. You've just got to talk.\"\n\nThe times I had kissed my sister's friends I had not spoken to them. They had been around while my sister was off doing something elsewhere, and they had drifted into my orbit, and so I had kissed them. I do not remember any talking. I did not know what to say to girls, and I told him so.\n\nThey're just girls,\" said Vic. \"They don't come from another planet.\"\n\nAs we followed the curve of the road around, my hopes that the party would prove unfindable began to fade: a low pulsing noise, music muffled by walls and doors, could be heard from a house up ahead. It was eight in the evening, not that early if you aren't yet sixteen, and we weren't. Not quite.\n\nI had parents who liked to know where I was, but I don't think Vic's parents cared that much. He was the youngest of five boys. That in itself seemed magical to me: I merely had two sisters, both younger than I was, and I felt both unique and lonely. I had wanted a brother as far back as I could remember. When I turned thirteen, I stopped wishing on falling stars or first stars, but back when I did, a brother was what I had wished for.\n\nWe went up the garden path, crazy paving leading us past a hedge and a solitary rosebush to a pebble- dashed facade. We rang the doorbell, and the door was opened by a girl. I could not have told you how old she was, which was one of the things about girls I had begun to hate: when you start out as kids you're just boys and girls, going through time at the same speed, and you're all five, or seven, or eleven, together. And then one day there's a lurch and the girls just sort of sprint off into the future ahead of you, and they know all about everything, and they have periods and breasts and makeup and God-only-knew-what-else -- for I certainly didn't. The diagrams in biology textbooks were no substitute for being, in a very real sense, young adults. And the girls of our age were.\n\nVic and I weren't young adults, and I was beginning to suspect that even when I started needing to shave every day, instead of once every couple of weeks, I would still be way behind.\n\nThe girl said, \"Hello?\"\n\nVic said, \"We're friends of Alison's.\" We had met Alison, all freckles and orange hair and a wicked smile, in Hamburg, on a German exchange. The exchange organizers had sent some girls with us, from a local girls' school, to balance the sexes. The girls, our age, more or less, were raucous and funny, and had more or less adult boyfriends with cars and jobs and motorbikes and -- in the case of one girl with crooked teeth and a raccoon coat, who spoke to me about it sadly at the end of a party in Hamburg, in, of course, the kitchen -- a wife and kids.\n\n\"She isn't here,\" said the girl at the door. \"No Alison.\"\n\n\"Not to worry,\" said Vic, with an easy grin. \"I'm Vic. This is Enn.\" A beat, and then the girl smiled back at him. Vic had a bottle of white wine in a plastic bag, removed from his parents' kitchen cabinet. \"Where should I put this, then?\"\n\nShe stood out of the way, letting us enter. \"There's a kitchen in the back,\" she said. \"Put it on the table there, with the other bottles.\" She had golden, wavy hair, and she was very beautiful. The hall was dim in the twilight, but I could see that she was beautiful.\n\n\"What's your name, then?\" said Vic.\n\nShe told him it was Stella, and he grinned his crooked white grin and told her that that had to be the prettiest name he had ever heard. Smooth bastard. And what was worse was that he said it like he meant it.\n\nVic headed back to drop off the wine in the kitchen, and I looked into the front room, where the music was coming from. There were people dan\n\ncing in there. Stella walked in, and she started to dance, swaying to the music all alone, and I watched her.\n\nThis was during the early days of punk. On our own record players we would play the Adverts and the Jam, the Stranglers and the Clash and the Sex Pistols. At other people's parties you'd hear ELO or 10cc or even Roxy Music. Maybe some Bowie, if you were lucky. During the German exchange, the only LP that we had all been able to agree on was Neil Young's Harvest, and his song \"Heart of Gold\" had threaded through the trip like a refrain: I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold. . . .\n\nThe music playing in that front room wasn't anything I recognized.\n\nIt sounded a bit like a German electronic pop group called Kraftwerk, and a bit like an LP I'd been given for my last birthday, of strange sounds made by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. The music had a beat, though, and the half- dozen girls in that room were moving gently to it, although I only looked at Stella. She shone.\n\nVic pushed past me, into the room. He was holding a can of lager. \"There's booze back in the kitchen,\" he told me. He wandered over to Stella and he began to talk to her. I couldn't hear what they were saying over the music, but I knew that there was no room for me in that conversation.\n\nI didn't like beer, not back then. I went off to see if there was something I wanted to drink. On the kitchen table stood a large bottle of Coca-Cola, and I poured myself a plastic tumblerful, and I didn't dare say anything to the pair of girls who were talking in the underlit kitchen. They were animated and utterly lovely. Each of them had very black skin and glossy hair and movie star clothes, and their accents were foreign, and each of them was out of my league.\n\nI wandered, Coke in hand.\n\nThe house was deeper than it looked, larger and more complex than the two- up two- down model I had imagined. The rooms were underlit -- I doubt there was a bulb of more than 40 watts in the building -- and each room I went into was inhabited: in my memory, inhabited only by girls. I did not go upstairs.\n\nA girl was the only occupant of the conservatory. Her hair was so fair it was white, and long, and straight, and she sat at the glass-topped table, her hands clasped together, staring at the garden outside, and the gathering dusk. She seemed wistful.\n\n\"Do you mind if I sit here?\" I asked, gesturing with my cup. She shook her head, and then followed it up with a shrug, to indicate that it was all the same to her. I sat down.\n\nVic walked past the conservatory door. He was talking to Stella, but he looked in at me, sitting at the table, wrapped in shyness and awkwardness, and he opened and closed his hand in a parody of a speaking mouth. Talk. Right.\n\n\"Are you from around here?\" I asked the girl.\n\nhttp://www.jounikoponen.com/images/picts/HtTtGaP01.jpg\n\nShe shook her head. She wore a low-cut silvery top, and I tried not to stare at the swell of her breasts.\n\nI said, \"What's your name? I'm Enn.\"\n\n\"Wain's Wain,\" she said, or something that sounded like it. \"I'm a second.\"\n\n\"That's uh. That's a different name.\"\n\nShe fixed me with huge, liquid eyes. \"It indicates that my progenitor was also Wain, and that I am obliged to report back to her. I may not breed.\"\n\n\"Ah. Well. Bit early for that anyway, isn't it?\"\n\nShe unclasped her hands, raised them above the table, spread her fingers. \"You see?\" The little finger on her left hand was crooked, and it bifurcated at the top, splitting into two smaller fingertips. A minor deformity. \"When I was finished a decision was needed. Would I be retained, or eliminated? I was fortunate that the decision was with me. Now, I travel, while my more perfect sisters remain at home in stasis. They were firsts. I am a second.\n\nSoon I must return to Wain, and tell her all I have seen. All my impressions of this place of yours.\"\n\n\"I don't actually live in Croydon,\" I said. \"I don't come from here.\" I wondered if she was American. I had no idea what she was talking about.\n\n\"As you say,\" she agreed, \"neither of us comes from here.\" She folded her six- fingered left hand beneath her right, as if tucking it out of sight. \"I had expected it to be bigger, and cleaner, and more colorful. But still, it is a jewel.\"\n\nShe yawned, covered her mouth with her right hand, only for a moment, before it was back on the table again. \"I grow weary of the journeying, and I wish sometimes that it would end. On a street in Rio at Carnival, I saw them on a bridge, golden and tall and insect-eyed and winged, and elated I almost ran to greet them, before I saw that they were only people in costumes. I said to Hola Colt, 'Why do they try so hard to look like us?' and Hola Colt replied, 'Because they hate themselves, all shades of pink and brown, and so small.' It is what I experience, even me, and I am not grown. It is like a world of children, or of elves.\" Then she smiled, and said, \"It was a good thing they could not any of them see Hola Colt.\"\n\n\"Um,\" I said, \"do you want to dance?\"\n\nShe shook her head immediately. \"It is not permitted,\" she said. \"I can do nothing that might cause damage to property. I am Wain's.\"\n\n\"Would you like something to drink, then?\"\n\n\"Water,\" she said.\n\nI went back to the kitchen and poured myself another Coke, and filled a cup with water from the tap. From the kitchen back to the hall, and from there into the conservatory, but now it was quite empty.\n\nI wondered if the girl had gone to the toilet, and if she might change her mind about dancing later. I walked back to the front room and stared in. The place was filling up. There were more girls dancing, and several lads I didn't know, who looked a few years older than me and Vic. The lads and the girls all kept their distance, but Vic was holding Stella's hand as they danced, and when the song ended he put an arm around her, casually, almost proprietorially, to make sure that nobody else cut in.\n\nI wondered if the girl I had been talking to in the conservatory was now upstairs, as she did not appear to be on the ground floor.\n\nI walked into the living room, which was across the hall from the room where the people were dancing, and I sat down on the sofa. There was a girl sitting there already. She had dark hair, cut short and spiky, and a nervous manner.\n\nTalk, I thought. \"Um, this mug of water's going spare,\" I told her, \"if you want it?\"\n\nShe nodded, and reached out her hand and took the mug, extremely carefully, as if she were unused to taking things, as if she could trust neither her vision nor her hands.\n\n\"I love being a tourist,\" she said, and smiled hesitantly. She had a gap between her two front teeth, and she sipped the tap water as if she were an adult sipping a fine wine. \"The last tour, we went to sun, and we swam in sunfire pools with the whales. We heard their histories and we shivered in the chill of the outer places, then we swam deepward where the heat churned and comforted us.\n\nI wanted to go back. This time, I wanted it. There was so much I had not seen. Instead we came to world. Do you like it?\"\n\n\"Like what?\"\n\nShe gestured vaguely to the room -- the sofa, the armchairs, the curtains, the unused gas fire.\n\n\"It's all right, I suppose.\" http://www.jounikoponen.com/images/picts/HtTtGaP02.jpg\n\n\"I told them I did not wish to visit world,\" she said. \"My parent-teacher was unimpressed. 'You will have much to learn,' it told me. I said, 'I could learn more in sun, again. Or in the deeps. Jessa spun webs between galaxies. I want to do that.'\n\n\"But there was no reasoning with it, and I came to world. Parent-teacher engulfed me, and I was here, embodied in a decaying lump of meat hanging on a frame of calcium. As I incarnated I felt things deep inside me, fluttering and pumping and squishing. It was my first experience with pushing air through the mouth, vibrating the vocal cords on the way, and I used it to tell parent-teacher that I wished that I would die, which it acknowledged was the inevitable exit strategy from world.\"\n\nThere were black worry beads wrapped around her wrist, and she fiddled with them as she spoke. \"But knowledge is there, in the meat,\" she said, \"and I am resolved to learn from it.\"\n\nWe were sitting close at the center of the sofa now. I decid\n\ned I should put an arm around her, but casually. I would extend my arm along the back of the sofa and eventually sort of creep it down, almost imperceptibly, until it was touching her. She said, \"The thing with the liquid in the eyes, when the world blurs. Nobody told me, and I still do not understand. I have touched the folds of the Whisper and pulsed and flown with the tachyon swans, and I still do not understand.\"\n\nShe wasn't the prettiest girl there, but she seemed nice enough, and she was a girl, anyway. I let my arm slide down a little, tentatively, so that it made contact with her back, and she did not tell me to take it away.\n\nVic called to me then, from the doorway. He was standing with his arm around Stella, protectively, waving at me. I tried to let him know, by shaking my head, that I was onto something, but he called my name and, reluctantly, I got up from the sofa and walked over to the door. \"What?\"\n\n\"Er. Look. The party,\" said Vic, apologetically. \"It's not the one I thought it was. I've been talking to Stella and I figured it out. Well, she sort of explained it to me. We're at a different party.\"\n\n\"Christ. Are we in trouble? Do we have to go?\"\n\nStella shook her head. He leaned down and kissed her, gently, on the lips. \"You're just happy to have me here, aren't you darlin'?\"\n\n\"You know I am,\" she told him.\n\nHe looked from her back to me, and he smiled his white smile: roguish, lovable, a little bit Artful Dodger, a little bit wide- boy Prince Charming. \"Don't worry. They're all tourists here anyway. It's a foreign exchange thing, innit? Like when we all went to Germany.\"\n\n\"It is?\"\n\n\"Enn. You got to talk to them. And that means you got to listen to them, too. You understand?\"\n\n\"I did. I already talked to a couple of them.\"\n\n\"You getting anywhere?\"\n\n‹ Prev Next ›"
