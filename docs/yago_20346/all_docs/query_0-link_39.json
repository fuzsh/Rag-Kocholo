        "text": "Blade Runner\n\n(theatrical release–widescreen) R–1982–117 min.\n\ndir. Ridley Scott w/Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Daryl Hannah\n\nNo other movie has ever combined this year’s theme of film noir to the science fiction genre as directly as this film. For this reason Rex has decided to open and close Cinema Rex with two different versions of this iconic film. Much has been said regarding the differences between the two. Regardless of your opinion as to which is best, there is no denying that voiceovers are the stuff of noir.\n\nDouble Indemnity\n\nNR–1944–107 min.\n\ndir. Billy Wilder w/Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, Edward G. Robinson\n\n“I killed him for money…and for a woman. I didn’t get the money. And I didn’t get the woman.” Amoral insurance investigator Fred MacMurray falls for Barbara Stanwyck, the most fatale of all the femmes. Together they concoct a hard-boiled plot involving money, sex and expressionist lighting. Edward G. Robinson steals the show as MacMurray’s boss, who has a little man living in his stomach, and a problem lighting matches. Directed by Billy Wilder; based on James M. Cain’s novel, with a screenplay by Wilder and Raymond Chandler. This is the greatest of all films noir.\n\nDark Blue\n\n(widescreen) R–2002–118 min.\n\ndir. Ron Shelton w/Kurt Russell\n\nKurt Russell is helping Rex out with the convention theme this year with a recent film that was much overlooked in theaters. Written by James Elroy, (L.A. Confidential) the story unfolds during the final days of the Rodney King trial in Los Angeles. Corrupt politicians, corrupt police officers, and unsavory protagonists fill this grim tale where life has little value. Don’t let the sunshine fool you, this film has a solid basis in the noir tradition.\n\nA Short Film About John Bolton\n\nNR–2003–27 min.\n\ndir. Neil Gaiman\n\nJust what is there that Neil Gaiman can’t do? Premiered at last year’s San Diego Comic Con but shown nowhere else, this mockumentary short was directed, yes, directed by the writer of the famed Sandman comic book series. Discover for yourself the secret life of fantasy artist John Bolton.\n\nTrailer Park\n\nSee what the future holds as Rex dishes out trailers for hot upcoming releases, as well as some locally produced independent shorts. This is one trailer park that probably won’t get hit by a tornado.\n\nDracula: Pages From a Virgin’s Diary\n\n(widescreen) NR–2002–73 min.\n\ndir. Guy Maddin w/The Royal Winnepeg Ballet\n\nThe Dracula tale, as you have never seen it before! This is a black & white silent film with a ballet troupe for a cast. Beautifully transposing the Royal Winnipeg Ballet’s interpretation of Bram Stoker’s classic vampire yarn from stage to screen, Maddin has forged a sumptuous, erotically charged feast of dance, drama and silent film techniques. Add to this a lush score and red and green accents hand painted directly on the film and you have an amazingly unique cinema experience. You just can’t miss this one.\n\nGinger Snaps\n\n(widescreen) R–2000–108 min.\n\ndir. John Fawcett w/Emily Perkins, Katharine Isabelle, Mimi Rogers\n\nRex’s goth extravaganza continues with this dark, clever werewolf flick with an odd sense of humor. This Canadian independent film has a rabid following among the few who’ve seen it. (hee hee) But seriously, this modern goth/horror/comedy about two despondent teenage gloom cookies fixated on death will surprise you.\n\nDark City\n\n(widescreen) R–1998–96 min.\n\ndir. Alex Proyas w/Rufus Sewell, Kiefer Sutherland, Jennifer Connelly, William Hurt\n\nA man wakes up, alienated, in a city where something is not right. In his search for the truth, he learns the answer to the question that defines his existence… The director of The Crow brings us a live-action comic book style movie NOT based on an actual comic book. Quirky performances, a classic story, and a strong, dark aesthetic make this film a treat. Thanks to the noir theme, this is the first official reshowing of a Cinema Rex selection from a previous year.\n\nBatman: Mask of the Phantasm\n\n(widescreen) PG–1993–76 min.\n\ndir. Eric Radomski, Bruce W. Timm w/Kevin Conroy, Dana Delaney, Mark Hamill\n\nRex really likes this theatrical installment of the Batman animated series. Arguably one of the most noir figures in comic book lore, the Batman has been interpreted many different ways. This Saturday morning cartoon will make you wish you had a trench coat and fedora to match your footed pajamas.\n\nThe Iron Giant with Vincent Truitner\n\n(widescreen) PG–1999–86 min.\n\ndir. Brad Bird w/Eli Marienthal, Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick Jr., Vin Diesel\n\nRemember when you were a boy named Hogarth growing up in the 50’s and you befriended a huge robot from outer space? You don’t? Then come watch this film and see exactly what would have happened to you if you had. A geek favorite, this delightful nostalgia piece was missed by many, but you can help remedy that.SPECIAL GUEST BONUS: Animator Vincent Truitner will speak before the film about his experience working on The Iron Giant, right here in Cinema Rex!\n\nThe Shadow\n\nPG-13–1994–108 min.\n\ndir. Russell Mulcahy w/Alec Baldwin, John Lone, Ian McKellen, Penelope Ann Miller\n\nWho knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? Only Rex knows. He also knows that this film had to be on his schedule this year. He also knows you’ll never find a better example of what a high level illusionist can do.\n\nCast A Deadly Spell\n\nR–1991–96 min.\n\ndir. Martin Campbell w/Fred Ward, David Warner, Julianne Moore, Clancy Brown\n\nFred Ward stars as detective Harry Lovecraft, investigating the theft of a rare book (“Its called… the Necronomicon!”) in an alternate1948 Los Angeles where everyone uses magic on a daily basis – except our retrograde hero, of course. Julianne Moore stars as the good-girl-gone-bad, or is it the bad-girl-gone-good? David Warner is his usual sinister self, and Alexandra Powers is the only girl in L.A. who can catch a unicorn. The fusion of comedy, Lovecraftian cosmic horror and slightly-overheated film noir succeeds well beyond it has any right to. Keep an eye open for the Night of the Demon reference.SPECIAL CTHULHU GIVEAWAY: To celebrate the release of their new Call Of Cthulhu Collectible Card Game, Fantasy Flight Games is giving away starter decks, demo decks, posters and other Cthulhu related stuff.\n\nSpecial Surprise Feature\n\nDue to contractual obligations, Cinema Rex can not disclose the title of this yet to be released film. Trust Rex…you won’t be disappointed.\n\nNight Of The Demon\n\n(widescreen) NR–1957–95 min.\n\ndir. Jacques Tourneur w/Dana Andrews, Peggy Cummins\n\nAlmost fifteen years after Cat People and I Walked With a Zombie, director Jacques Tourneur returned to the supernatural with this adaptation of the M.R. James story “Casting the Runes.” Night of the Demon (sometimes called Curse of the Demon) is a bona fide horror masterpiece, with an unparalleled atmosphere of dread and suspense, and one of the best demons on film. It’s little seen, but often referenced…as by Kate Bush in “The Hounds of Love,” and by a passel of drug-crazed monkeys with typewriters in The Rocky Horror Picture Show.\n\nThe Ring\n\n(widescreen) PG-13–2002-115 min.\n\ndir. Gore Verbinski w/Naomi Watts\n\nThe first installment of Rex’s “Ring Double Feature,” this is the film that shows why you should fear your television. And unknown video tapes. And static. And water. And little girls with long hair.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"
