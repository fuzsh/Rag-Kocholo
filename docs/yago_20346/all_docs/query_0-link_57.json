        "text": "The Art of Elysium, a nonprofit that brings creators and those in need together to create transformative healing experiences through art, will toast its 25th anniversary with its Heaven Benefit in January, where Neil Gaiman has been chosen as the recipient of this year’s Visionary Award.\n\nEach year, the event’s theme, “Heaven,” is brought to life by a chosen visionary who conceptualizes their personal idea of paradise. This year — with the event scheduled to take place in Los Angeles on Jan. 6, the night before the Golden Globes — the task is bestowed upon Gaiman, whose canon deals with fantasy, divinity and humanity across mediums.\n\n“Celebrating 25 years of The Art of Elysium and our mission of art heals is surreal to say the least. Choosing a visionary to conceptualize their idea of heaven has never been more important than at this milestone. This is our first Heaven since the COVID pandemic, and it is the largest celebration to date,” Jennifer Howell, the organization’s founder, said in a statement. “Choosing Neil as the visionary for Heaven is the most personal ask I have ever made. I have been a fan of his work for as long as I can remember and believe him to be one of the most creative forces in our lifetimes. He creates worlds, he makes people laugh and cry at the same time, and he constantly reminds each of us of the gift of free will. I am honored beyond words that we will be dancing in his wondrous heaven in 2024.”\n\nGaiman, whose books Good Omens, American Gods and The Sandman have become hit television series, has also written screenplays for Neverwhere and Mirrormask, penned an episode of Doctor Who, co-wrote Beowulf with Robert Zemeckis and produced the film Stardust. Additionally, Gaiman’s directorial pursuits include A Short Film About John Bolton and Sky Television’s Statuesque.\n\n“For me, heaven is two things that are, perhaps, the same thing: Heaven is both a library, the place where we go for knowledge, for wisdom, for advice and for stories, and heaven is also a refuge, somewhere that we can go, whoever we are, for safety and protection,” Gaiman said in a statement. “Heaven contains librarians and refugees, shelters the helpless, and gives them — us — somewhere quiet to sit and read or listen.”\n\nPast honorees have included Marina Abramovic, Shepard Fairey, John Legend, Vivienne Westwood, Andreas Kronthaler and Stevie Wonder, as the event raises funds that go to the arts programs that serve individuals in the midst of emotional life challenges like illness, hospitalization, displacement, confinement and crisis."
