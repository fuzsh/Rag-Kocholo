        "text": "Just saw this on Sci-Fi wire:\n\nDel Toro Wants Gaiman On Death\n\nGuillermo del Toro, who is producing the film adaptation of Neil Gaiman's comic-book miniseries Death: The High Cost of Living, told SCI FI Wire that he believes Gaiman is the right choice to direct the film, even though he's never directed a full-length feature before.\n\n\"I think that if anyone knows that character, it's him,\" del Toro said in an interview on the set of his current directorial project, Hellboy II: The Golden Army, in Budapest last week. \"And then, if we need to create a support structure, we will. I mean, there is without a doubt no one more qualified to tell that story than Neil Gaiman in my mind.\"\n\nThe character of Death, as embodied by a perky young goth woman, first appeared in Gaiman's critically acclaimed comic-book series Sandman. In the three-issue miniseries Death: The High Cost of Living, she takes human form in order to better understand humanity, a ritual that happens once a century. During this time, she befriends a suicidal teen and teaches him the value of life.\n\nGaiman's only directing credit to date is A Short Film About John Bolton, a fictional story about the real-life artist told in documentary style. Earlier this year, Gaiman visited the set of Hellboy II to learn from del Toro and observe him at work. \"We talked a lot,\" del Toro said. \"We talked about him directing as soon as possible.\"\n\nDel Toro expressed his confidence in Gaiman's vision as both a writer and a director. \"I think that Neil is a guy that thinks in terms of ideas and very concrete images,\" he said. \"He's not an artist in the sense that he's not a draftsman, but he is the creator of that universe. ... I think there's a great advantage to not knowing how things should be done. People just go and make them happen, because they don't know that they are impossible. ... I prefer first-time mistakes than 10th-time mistakes. I think these guys are going to have first-time things that no one else is going to do. So hopefully it will happen.\" â€” Cindy White"
