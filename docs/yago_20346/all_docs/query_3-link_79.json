        "text": "Neil Gaiman, literary world builder and one of Earth’s treasures, graced us with his presence on November 10, 1960. Born in Hampshire, England, Gaiman’s love for reading started at a young age when he wrote his first poem at the age of three. His parents would often pat him down before social events to make sure he wasn’t squirreling away any books. It makes sense, then, that his love affair with libraries would have begun at such an early age.\n\n“I wouldn't be who I am without libraries. I was the sort of kid who devoured books, and my happiest times as a boy were when I persuaded my parents to drop me off in the local library on their way to work, and I spent the day there. I discovered that librarians actually want to help you: they taught me about interlibrary loans.\" —Neil Gaiman discussing his literary beginnings\n\nAt age seven, Gaiman was gifted The Chronicles of Narnia box set where he first learned of the prestigious Carnegie Medal—a British literary award given to an outstanding new book for young readers. When he bought A Wrinkle in Time several years later, he learned about the Newbery Medal, the Carnegie’s US equivalent. Some 40-odd-years later, Gaiman would be awarded both medals for The Graveyard Book, a title he had been working on since his mid-20s.\n\nBesides the works of C.S. Lewis and Madeleine L’Engle, Gaiman also grew up reading titles by J.R.R. Tolkien, James Branch Cabell, Edgar Allan Poe, Michael Moorcock, Ursula K. Le Guin, Gene Wolfe, G.K. Chesterton, and Lewis Carroll. The works of these writers and many more had a profound influence on Gaiman and his writing style.\n\nGaiman started off as a journalist, writing over 700 book and film reviews for various different publications. In 1984, while waiting for a train, Gaiman noticed Alan Moore’s Saga of the Swamp Thing Number 25 on a newsstand rack. What he read was a revolutionary approach to comics, reinvigorating his deep love for comics and the art form. 1989 was the start of the cult series: The Sandman, winner of multiple Eisner and Harvey Awards.\n\nIn 2013, in celebration of the 175th anniversary of Charles Dickens's classic holiday story, Neil Gaiman performed a reading of A Christmas Carol here at NYPL.\n\nGaiman is beyond prolific. He’s written novels, short stories and novellas, film scripts, comics and graphic novels, nonfiction, and pretty much anything else you can think of—including an out-of-print biography of Duran Duran and a poem about a gay Quaker astronomer who confirmed Einstein’s theory of relativity. His transcendent stories have won many accolades, cementing him as one of the top writers of this generation. His ability to write for all ages has only continued his legacy for current and future fans. This is the world of Gaiman and we are only living in it.\n\nFor those interested in Gaiman’s bibliography, we’ve put together a reader’s starter guide to all things fantastical.\n\nAmerican Gods\n\nCaught between the Old Gods (Odin, Anansi, Bilquis) and the New (Media, Technology, Globalization) in a battle for America’s soul, Shadow, a young man recently released from prison, embarks on a surreal road trip to decide their fates. The novel was adapted for television in 2017 and is now in its third season. A perfect introduction to Gaiman’s oeuvre.\n\nThe Sandman\n\nA classic in the comic world, Gaiman reinvents DC Comic’s character of The Sandman. The story follows Dream of the Endless, ruler of the dreamworld, through his trials and tribulations. Part horror, part fantasy, the strength of this series comes from its blend of mythology and history. Highly recommended for those wondering where to start in the graphic novel format.\n\nThe Ocean at the End of the Lane\n\nA return to his hometown for a funeral brings forth forgotten memories about his childhood and his neighbor, Lettie Hempstock. Magical realism at its best.\n\nGood Omens with Terry Pratchett\n\nWhat happens when two witty authors combine forces? A story where the end of the world is nigh, Good and Evil are under preparation, and the Antichrist is missing. Oh, and did I forget to mention that an angel and demon team up and forge a plan to sabotage the Rapture upon deciding it’s “not for them?” Wildly funny and massively entertaining.\n\nStardust\n\nIn the small town of Wall, Tristran Thorn must find a fallen star to win the hand of his beloved, Victoria Forester. This journey will take him into Fairie, a magical world where things are not always what they seem. A fairie tale for adults.\n\nThe Graveyard Book\n\nNobody Owens is not your average boy. He lives in a graveyard and cared for by those who prowl the cemetery - ghosts, vampires, and other improbable creatures alike. But how does a boy truly live amongst the living and the dead? Rich in detail, this dark tale takes adventurers on a wild journey of the heart.\n\nCoraline\n\nA deliciously creepy book, Coraline travels through a door in her new house to one that is a mirror image...but better. The other parents shower her with love and affection, everything Coraline craves. It seems perfect, until it’s not. One to read on a dark, stormy night, preferably with biscuit and tea.\n\nA Study in Emerald\n\nAn ode to Sherlock Holmes and H.P. Lovecraft, this supernatural mystery is a loose retelling of A Study in Scarlet set in the world of the Cthulhu Mythos. Paired with Rafael Albuquerque’s illustration, this short story exemplifies Gaiman’s craftsmanship of the fantasy and sci-fi genres.\n\n---\n\nHeadshot: \"Author Neil Gaiman\" by Kyle Cassidy is licensed under CC BY 3.0\n\n---\n\nHave trouble reading standard print?
