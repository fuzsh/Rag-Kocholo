        "text": "Synopsis\n\nGraphic India, a pioneer in Indian-themed character entertainment, and acclaimed author Neil Gaiman are collaborating on a new English-language animated film titled 'Cinnamon'. Adapted from a short story by Gaiman, the screenplay will be co-written by Gaiman and leading Indian animation writer Sharad Devarajan.\n\nGraphic India, the leader in original Indian-themed character entertainment, and Neil Gaiman are partnering on a new English-language animated film, 'Cinnamon'.\n\nGaiman is the NYT best-selling author and creator of films and series including, Coraline (Academy Award Nominee, Best Animated Feature), The Sandman, American Gods, and Good Omens.\n\nBased on a short story written by Gaiman, the screenplay is being adapted by Gaiman and leading Indian animation writer and creator, Sharad Devarajan (The Legend of Hanuman; Baahubali: The Lost Legends) with Sarena Khan and Sujatha SV. The film will be directed by acclaimed Indian animator, Jeevan J. Kang.\n\nBorn with pearl eyes that render her blind to the physical world, Cinnamon’s destiny is shaped forever when a mysterious talking tiger appears. Offering to lead her through the wonders and trials of the wild, Cinnamon begins a perilous adventure that will shape her path and test her resolve. She enters a hidden realm where the line between the mundane and the mystical is as thin as a whisper and where the ancient wisdom of India breathes life into a jungle thrumming with secrets.\n\n“Together, we are crafting a film that will transport audiences to a world of magic, wonder, and eternal truths, a story that celebrates the transformative power of compassion and the resilience of the human spirit. I cannot wait to share this incredible journey with animation fans around the world, old and new,\" commented Neil Gaiman.\n\n“Neil Gaiman is one of the greatest storytellers of our time if not all time. I am honored to bring his enchanting story of Cinnamon to audiences around the world. Inspired by Indian fables, Cinnamon weaves together the timeless theme of dharma as a young princess embarks on a journey of courage and self-discovery. At its core, it explores the universal human experience of the eternal struggle between light and darkness,” added writer and producer, Sharad Devarajan.\n\nPreviously at Graphic India, Devarajan and Kang created and produced (with Kang directing) the animated hit, The Legend of Hanuman which broke records as the most successful animated project in Indian history and reached #1 on the charts for Disney+Hotstar when it was released.\n\nProducers for the film are Neil Gaiman and Cat Mihos for The Blank Corporation and Sharad Devarajan, Sarena Khan and Jeevan J. Kang producing for Graphic India, which is also the production studio animating the project and India’s leading animation studio of original content.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nWhy Bhavish Aggarwal, not Google, is making investors of India’s oldest navigation startup edgy\n\nMeals to movies: Zomato spices up menu with acquisition of Paytm’s ticketing biz\n\nIndia’s banks have a deposit problem.
