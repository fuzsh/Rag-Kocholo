        "text": "As a massive Neil Gaiman fan, I often get asked by friends where they should start reading his work. Because there’s so much to choose from, there’s no easy answer. Some people say read Neil Gaiman by publishing date. Some say start with his most popular work (Good Omens or American Gods) and go from there. I say, where to start reading Neil Gaiman depends on other stuff you like to read. In short, what kind of reader are you? Do you like comics or short stories or fun novels or thought-provoking pieces? Are you a kid, or kid at heart, and want to dive in? To help tease out the mystery, here’s a rundown of 8 starting places for Neil Gaiman’s work. Your path after that is up to you…\n\nThe Neil Gaiman Reader - For those who like short stories\n\nThe Neil Gaiman Reader is a collection of Gaiman’s best short stories as chosen by his readers. Simple. I like this book as a first place to start reading Neil Gaiman, because short stories don’t take a huge investment. You can dive in and out. You can read a few, go to something else and then come back without losing anything. With this being a smattering of his most popular short fiction over the years, it feels like a no-brainer as a start point for those who enjoy faster reads. It’s never the first book to pop up on Gaiman searches though, so, to make it easy, you can find it here.\n\nGood Omens - For Terry Pratchett fans and those who like a funner read\n\nSome of Neil Gaiman’s work can be pretty dark. Not Good Omens. While it deals with heavier themes (the end of times), it’s packed full of wicked humour. Neil wrote this in conjunction with famous fantasy author Terry Pratchett, introducing a generation to the younger writer, and Gaiman fans to Terry. It still holds up to this day. If you want to make it even easier, the TV adaptation on Amazon TV is a classic, written and produced by Gaiman himself.\n\nAmerican Gods - For those who want to first read Neil Gaiman’s most celebrated work\n\nI’d class American Gods as Neil Gaiman’s ‘best’ book. A lot of award-givers agree. It won the Locus, the Hugo and the Nebula awards all in the same year. However, while I’d say ‘best’, it isn’t an easy read. If you want something that’s sprawling, through-provoking and more than a little weird, then start here. But, if you want to ease into Neil Gaiman from an easier path, then go the short stories, or maybe even the very next suggestion.\n\nNeverwhere - Dark fantasy that won’t scare you witless\n\nNeverwhere is best described as a bridge between Good Omens and American Gods. It still has a good bout of humour, but has some really thought-provoking ideas and situations in there. It’s also quirky as hell. This is the book I most recommend for my friends to start with, mostly because it’s the most similar to my own work in Hellbound. If you’d like a guide to other good dark fantasy, head here. Or, get stuck into Neverwhere right away. A great starting point Neil Gaiman fans often point to.\n\nThe Graveyard Book - A younger Neil Gaiman read that adults still love\n\nNeil Gaiman was told that this horror book for kids was unpublishable when he first wrote it. Too dark. Too scary. Too weird. Are you kidding? That’s what makes it amazing. Since it (eventually) came out, kids and adults around the world cite it as a work that helped them through tough times, and something they’ll always remember as being pivotal to their lives. It has had that much impact. Coraline is a wonderful place for brave kids to start reading Neil Gaiman.\n\nSandman - For comic book readers, or lit freaks who also love art.\n\nThe story that kick-started Neil Gaiman’s career. Sandman is a twisted work of a fabulous mind. The art, arcs and ideas all make it a classic. This comic has been so influential, it is about to be made into a Netflix series too. Look out for the flipping of tropes, like making Death a teenage girl, and the flipping of worlds, from reality to dreamscapes and back. For those wanting the full experience, this Box Set is a must-have.\n\nThe Ocean At The End of The Lane - literary horror for parents.\n\nRevisit your childhood nightmares in The Ocean at the End of the Lane. This book is great for adults who like a more literary read with a healthy dose of darkness. This is a nostalgic book, loosely based on Neil Gaiman’s own childhood. In his own words “It's a book about family, it's a book about being 7 in a world of people who are bigger than you, and more dangerous, and stepping into territory that you don't entirely understand.” A great feeling for parents to be reminded of sometimes, so, for me, a great place for parents to start reading Neil Gaiman (to themselves, not their kids). To find The Ocean at the end of the Lane, head here.\n\nIf you love Neil Gaiman, you may enjoy the Hellbound Trilogy.
