        "text": "Felicia Day has developed a new fantasy comedy series for Audible titled Third Eye. The movie is described as a comedic love letter to the fantasy genre, and fan-favorite author Neil Gaiman is involved.\n\nThis is a scripted series that is written and created by Day (The Guild, Geek & Sundry) and Gaiman (The Sandman) serves as The Narrator. The show will have “an abundance of iconic geek and gaming culture Easter eggs cleverly woven throughout the series.”\n\nThe series also has a great supporting cast that includes Sean Astin (The Lord of the Rings), LilyPichu (Offline TV), Wil Wheaton (Ready Player One), London Hughes (The Netflix Afterparty), Danny Pudi (Mythic Quest, Community), Alan Tudyk (Resident Alien), Hudson Yang (Fresh Off the Boat) and Christopher Judge (God of War).\n\nThe Audible original tells the story of Laurel (Day), a “Chosen One” wizard still grappling with the fallout of failing a decade earlier in her fight with the ultimate evil Tybus (Judge). Our heroine is forced to overcome her tattered reputation and self-loathing in order to save her friends, eventually uncovering shocking secrets on the way toward confronting old enemies. Along the way, Laurel encounters characters including Kate Chen (LilyPichu), a quirky, teenage human girl on a quest for knowledge about the supernatural world; Frank Fletcher (Astin), a cranky, stubborn vampire; Robigus (Wheaton), the local San Francisco enforcer for Tybus the Terrible and a constant thorn in the side for Laurel; and Sybil (London Hughes), an exiled Faerie princess in her 20s who exemplifies “hot mess.”\n\nDay said in a statement: “As my biggest passion project since The Guild, I am thrilled that Audible has allowed me to bring ‘Third Eye’ to life in the exact way I’ve been imagining for years. I can’t wait for fans to listen and fall in love with these characters as much as I have.”\n\nZola Mashariki, head of Audible Studio added: “Third Eye is a testament to Felicia Day’s unparalleled creativity, transporting listeners to a genre-bending universe of science-fiction blended with comedy. With a uniquely imaginative performance, Neil Gaiman headlines an outstanding cast comprised of genre royalty. ‘Third Eye’ is sure to captivate audiences worldwide, and we’re thrilled to add yet another exciting show to our growing collection of Audible originals.”\n\nThird Eye will premiere on October 5, 2023, exclusively on Audible."
