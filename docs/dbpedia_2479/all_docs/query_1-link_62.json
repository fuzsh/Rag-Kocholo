        "text": "Decide what type of cabin you would like.\n\nThere are four main types (categories) of cabins:\n\nInside cabins:\n\nThese cabins are usually the lowest price. Typically they will have twin beds that convert to a queen size, a private bath with a shower, a closet for hanging clothes, a dresser and a television. These cabins do not have a window to let natural light in. To help give the occupants an impression of having a view, some inside cabins have a virtual view. That means there is a large screen that displays outside views. Expect to pay $100 to $200 a night for an inside cabin.\n\nException: Carnival has several cabins which are classified as inside cabins but actually have a french glass door which allows light into the room (no balcony, but the door can be opened). Carnival also has some cabins that have a window, but because the window has an obstructed view (that means there is a railing or object in the way) it is listed as an inside cabin. Royal Caribbean has some cabins that have a window but look out over an inside promenade area. These are called \"promenade staterooms\".\n\nOceanview cabins:\n\nThese cabins are like inside cabins but usually have a port hole or window. A window is much more desirable than a porthole because the porthole can be difficult to look through. Windows will vary in size and some cabins will even have full floor to ceiling windows. Most window sizes for oceanview cabins are about 4 feet by 3 feet. Be sure to read the cabin description carefully to determine if there is a different type of window. Windows can not be opened. Expect to pay $150 to $250 a night for an oceanview.\n\nBalcony cabins:\n\nThese cabins are better, and more expensive, than oceanview cabins because they typically have full glass sliding doors that lead to a balcony. The balcony allows fresh air and light into the cabin and also may have additional chairs or loungers. Balconies tend to be separated by dividers which give some sense of privacy, but be aware that most balconies are not fully private and can be viewed from above or by the cabin next to you. Balconies on new Norwegian Cruise Line ships and Princess Cruise Line ships tend to be smaller and more narrow than balconies on other ships. We will list balcony size in the cabin description. Carnival offers what is called a \"Cove Balcony\" on some of their ships. These balconies are very popular because they sit lower on the ship (closer to the water line). Expect to pay $200 to $400 a night for an balcony cabin.\n\nSuite:\n\nA suite is a premium cabin on a cruise ship. It is usually much larger than a balcony and includes more perks. Suites typically have a full bath tub, large shower, larger closets, larger balcony, larger TV, and butler services. Expect to pay $400 to over $1,000 a night for a suite.\n\nDecide where you would like the cabin located.\n\nCabins are priced based on location on the ship. Typically cabins on lower decks are less expensive. Typically cabins midship (in the middle part of a deck) cost higher. Balcony and Suite cabins on the very aft of the ship can also be more expensive than other cabins.\n\nIn order to set the pricing many cruise lines will divide each cabin type into sub categories. For example a balcony cabin may be divided into sub categories such as B1, B2, B3, B4. In most cases the cabin size and features in a sub category is the exactly the same. The only difference is usually the location of the cabin on the ship. Please look for the notes on the category descriptions to determine if there is a difference in size or features between the subcategories.\n\nException: Royal Caribbean and other cruise lines will also use sub categories to distinquish between how many occupants the cabin will sleep. Therefore a cabin that can sleep up to 4 people will be a different sub category from a cabin that sleeps only 2 people.\n\nYou can also use our drag deck feature to determine if your cabin is in a good location. Cabins are best located when they are next to, above or below other cabins. As a rule of thumb avoid booking a cabin under a public area or kitchen. If you are looking for a balcony cabin, please be aware that on many ships the cabins that are below the pool deck may also be shaded by a roof overhang from the deck above. You can also use our drag deck feature to determine if there is a overhang.\n\nTIP: Many of the cruise ships are so large now and have so many floors that elevators are required to get to the public areas from your stateroom. But during peak times you could be waiting awhile to get on an elevator. If you pick a stateroom near the top or near the lower decks of the ship you may find a much better experience getting around. For example a stateroom on top of the ship gets you closer to the pool and buffet areas. A stateroom near the main public decks gets you closer to the lounges and bars. If you do need to take an elevator it is easier to find one that is empty if you are starting from the top or the bottom. You will also find the busiest elevators are the ones that go up to the buffet."
