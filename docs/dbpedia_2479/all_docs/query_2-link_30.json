In the second 500, the Swiss combo of Schaeuble and Ireland moved into the lead, taking nearly a length on the rest of the crews with the favored Irish crew moving into second. McCarthy and O'Donovan of Ireland inched into the lead in the third 500, with Italy taking control over third place, open water on fourth. At the finish, Ireland had pushed out to a length lead to repeat as world champions, with Switzerland holding off a sprint from Italy to claim the silver.\n\nWatch the final here.\n\n2024 SEASON RECAP\n\nWORLD CUP I\n\nThree doubles qualified for Paris made the A Final in Varese, with Italy sprinting through Switzerland to take the gold by just under half a second. Norway finished in third, another three seconds behind the Swiss.\n\nEUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIPS\n\nThe Swiss double led from start to finish to take the gold in Hungary in a field that featured five of the six finalists from the 2023 World Championships. Italy finished in second, just ahead of Norway with Czech and Spain rounding out the top five.\n\nFOPQR\n\nThe two qualification spots for Paris were won by France and Greece.\n\nWORLD CUP II\n\nIreland made their only appearance in 2024 in Lucerne, but were unable to keep the pace, finishing in third place behind both Italy and Switzerland.

The NYAC/Green Racing Project composite crew of Sam Melvin and Cooper Tuckerman did not advance to the A Final at the FOPQR, failing to qualify for Paris."
