        "text": "Adrienne Maloof’s sons are growing up so fast!\n\nIn a June 19 Instagram post, The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alum revealed her eldest child, Gavin Nassif, whom she shares with ex-husband Dr. Paul Nassif, just celebrated his 21st birthday.\n\n\"Happy 21st birthday to my beautiful son! I love you more than words can say,\" Adrienne captioned the photo of her son who was all smiles in what appeared to be a restaurant where family gathered for the occasion. Gavin sat in front of a large white cake that had light blue writing on top and blue-and-white-\"21\" candles.\n\nDon’t miss out on the latest Bravo news:\n\nTake a Look Back at Yolanda Hadid's Massive Engagement Ring from David Foster (PICS)\n\nMauricio Shares a Look at His Life Apart From Kyle — & It Includes a Career Achievement\n\nJeff Lewis Shares Insight on Dorit Kemsley & PK's Split: \"I Knew Long Before...\"\n\nAdrienne also added \"[Proud Mom]\" as a hashtag to gush about her oldest.\n\n\"Thank you mom love you very much,\" Gavin wrote in the comments section.\n\nSee Dr. Paul Nassif's tribute to Gavin Nassif on his 21st birthday\n\nPaul also celebrated his son's milestone birthday with his own Instagram post and a tender tribute to boot.\n\n\"I can’t believe my firstborn, [Gavin], is 21 YEARS OLD!\" Paul began in the caption of the post which showed himself and his son smiling proudly for the camera in a sweet selfie.\n\n\"Gavin, it seems like it was just yesterday when I held you for the first time,\" Paul continued. \"[Y]ou had the biggest smile on your face. That moment changed my life forever because you showed me a love that I didn’t know existed. It’s hard to believe you’re already 21. I’m so proud of the young man you’ve become. You are my world. I love you more than you know. Happy birthday, Gav… what a milestone!\"\n\nGavin thanked his father for the well wishes in the comments, writing, \"Love you very much.\"\n\nInside Adrienne Maloof's son Gavin's freshman year at college\n\nIn addition to commemorating his 21st, Gavin recently had another milestone worth celebrating: he just finished his first year in college.\n\nAdrienne shared behind-the-scenes details of Gavin gearing up for college in August 2023 by first preparing with a Target run for supplies and other household items.\n\nIn mid-August, Adrienne updated us with a view inside Gavin's freshman dorm room, which was pretty bare bones when they first moved in.\n\n“Moving my son into his first day of college life. It’s all about the bare necessities for now,” she captioned the post, which showed the sparsely decorated space with a desk, chair, dresser, and a raised bed with storage space underneath. “I wish I could bring some fresh flowers to brighten up the place a bit,” Adrienne completed her caption.\n\nWe bet Gavin made the dorm room wholly his own and had an exciting first year at school!"
