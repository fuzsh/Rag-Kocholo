Continues to be a model of consistency: streak has reached 89 rounds to start his college career without a score in the 80s (in fact, his high has been 77 on just four occasions, one 76, and then a 75 on two others, otherwise all other 82 rounds have been 74 or lower) ...

That figure was good for 12th in the Pac-12 (sixth-best by an underclassmen) … In the fall, he recorded the third-best fall stroke average ever by a Buff – 70.33 – just a tad behind his frosh average of 70.07 (now second-best) ...

Score counted toward CU’s team total a team-best 39 of 40 times (97.5 percent) ... Second on the team with 28 rounds of par or better (20 subpar) ...

The team leader in stroke average with a 70.91 mark, he also led the team in the fall (70.07) and spring (71.57) … He was the first freshman since Jeremy Paul in 2013-14 to lead the team and just the sixth overall to ever accomplish the rare feat … The figure was also seventh overall in the Pac-12, and first among all freshmen; he also led all league frosh in top 20 finishes (7), rounds in the 60’s (12), subpar rounds (20), rounds of par or better (23) and the “low” high score (77) ...
