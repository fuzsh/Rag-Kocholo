Ferguson, the Supreme Court decision that established the \"separate but equal\" doctrine.\n\nAll four of her grandparents were descended from slaves.\n\n-♪ When Israel was in Egypt's land ♪ ♪ Let my people go ♪ -In the 1890s, Marian's grandfather, Benjamin, and Isabella, Aunt Marian's grandmother, moved from Virginia to Philadelphia.\n\nThey were part of the early migration of people moving from the South to the North for a better life.\n\n-♪ Go down, Moses ♪ ♪ Way down in Egypt's land ♪ ♪ Tell old Pharaoh ♪ ♪ To let my people ♪ ♪ Go ♪ -Philadelphia had the largest free Black population before the Civil War, so it's had a long history of Black communities.\n\n[ Children shouting playfully ] -There were middle-class Blacks, educated Blacks going back to the late 18th century.\n\n-But the largest number of African-Americans in a place like Philadelphia were poor.\n\nYou have tensions between immigrant communities who are coming into Philadelphia fighting for the same jobs.\n\nYou also have tension between African-Americans who had been in Philadelphia for generations and new African-Americans.\n\n-Marian's father, John, he was a hard worker.\n\nHe worked at the Reading Terminal as a laborer, a jack-of-all-trades.\n\nHe delivered coal.\n\nAnd whites certainly made it clear that there were a lot of employment opportunities where Blacks were not welcome, and so they really had to scratch and fight for everything they got.\n\n♪♪ -My father was a very handsome man.\n\n-♪ La-da-da-da-da-da-dum ♪ -I remember hearing him -- ♪ La-da-da-da-da-da, da-dum ♪ That was his favorite thing to hum while he was getting dressed.\n\nHe was a very tall man, about six feet, and Mother's short, and I remembered hearing him tell mother when she was helping him put on his tie that she should get newspaper and stand on it to make her tall enough.\n\n[ Laughs ] My father was a special officer in the Union Baptist Church.\n\nI was taken along to church with my father practically every Sunday.\n\n-The church was the epicenter.\n\nWe went to church for dinners.\n\nWe went to church for social events.\n\nWe went to church for religious services.\n\nSunday was an all-day affair.\n\n-At 6 years old, we were taken to the children's choir with my aunt.\n\nAfter a short while, the group was singing so well that we sang for the big Sunday school.\n\n♪♪ By the time we arrived at our little house, the director of the choir had already been there and left.\n\nMy mother told my father that Mr. Robinson wanted to be sure that I would be able to be in church earlier the next Sunday because there were going to be visitors, and he wanted that we should sing for them.\n\nMy father said in reply to that, \"I'm not going to have them singing my child to death.\"\n\n[ Laughs ] My first public appearance.\n\n[ Laughs ] -She grew quite the audience at that church.\n\n♪♪ -My father bought our first piano.\n\nOh, you have no idea the joy.\n\n-They knew she had this musical gift.\n\nShe seemed to just have this extraordinary sense of melody.\n\n♪♪ -I remember taking one finger of his hand to make it go up the scale.\n\nHis fingers were so large that I could scarcely get them on one key at a time.\n\n♪♪ He may even have tried to hit two notes to make me feel that he couldn't do it as well as I.\n\n[ Laughs ] ♪♪ One fine day, I was sent to the store, and I saw something lying on the street.\n\nIt was, oh, a little handbill, but there was something in the corner that was strangely familiar to me.\n\nThere in the corner was a small snapshot under which it said, \"Come Hear the Baby Contralto.\"\n\nI was absolutely flabbergasted and stunned.\n\nI was the proudest thing in the neighborhood.\n\n♪♪ The amusing thing was they said, \"The Baby Contralto, 10 years old,\" and I was then 8.\n\nThat was the first time that I had seen my name and my picture in print.\n\n[ Laughs ] -Her father protected her until his untimely death in 1909 when she was 12 years old.\n\n♪♪ -John was working on the track line, and he was struck on the head.\n\nHe didn't get the immediate medical treatment that he needed.\n\n-He died in our little home.\n\n-Aunt Marian's mother, Anna, wanted to take her daughters back to Virginia, where she was from.\n\nBut Aunt Marian's grandmother, Isabella, prohibited that.\n\n-They immediately had to move in with her grandmother and grandfather, and the grandfather died the next year, and so it was just the grandmother, who was not a very warm figure.\n\n-My grandmother was boss even of my mother, and she was the one who decided what should be done when, where, and how.\n\n-Anna, her mother, got a teaching certificate in Virginia, but in Philadelphia, officials would not certify her to teach.\n\n-She decided to take work as a domestic at the John Wanamaker Department Store.\n\n♪♪ -My sister and I stopped in at Wanamaker's, and Mother was so busy and so intent on the job which she had to do, she didn't realize that anybody else was in the world.\n\n♪♪ -Marian Anderson's grandmother insisted she work full-time to try to help support the family.\n\nShe had to leave school at the age of 12.\n\nShe worked, singing, but also working as a domestic, just anything she could get to help the family.\n\n♪♪ Marian's Aunt Mary, her father's sister, was really the biggest influence on her.\n\n♪♪ -At 13 or 14, my aunt took me with her to the senior choir.\n\nThe conductor was good enough to let us take the music home, and we learned everybody's part.\n\n♪♪ The great piece of the choir was the \"Inflammatus.\"\n\n-The \"Inflammatus\" is a anthem that the Black Church would sing.\n\nEven for the most trained singers, it's a tour de force.\n\nThere's a bunch of high C's in there, especially at the very end.\n\n-It allows you to do a lot of rather nice gymnastics.\n\n[ Laughs ] [ Operatic singing ] There seemed not to be too much vocally that gave one a great deal of trouble.\n\n-For young Black women like Marian Anderson, there were fewer options for studying and for performing.\n\n-We have all been conditioned, particularly in this country, to believe that with the art form of classical music, there's a different face than ours.\n\n-Classical music was seen as something that only a European person should perform in or should be seen doing.\n\n-[ Singing operatically ] -There were many African-American women singers who came along before Marian Anderson.\n\n♪♪ Elizabeth Greenfield.\n\nThe Hyers Sisters.\n\n\"Black Patti,\" Sissieretta Jones.\n\n-With Sissieretta Jones, it was just so fresh off of slavery that there was just very little chance of her breaking certain barriers.\n\n-Most concert halls and opera houses are completely off-limits for Black singers.\n\nAfrican-American communities would create their own classical-music world.\n\nThey would stage operas.\n\nThey would stage full symphony concerts.\n\n-The Theodore Drury Company in the 1902, 1903, 1904.\n\nHarry Lawrence Freeman is a composer who was writing operas for Denver in the 1890s.\n\n-Roland Hayes was somebody who was a trailblazer of trying to figure out, how could he create a career for himself in classical music?\n\n-He was the first African-American superstar in classical music.\n\nWhen he sang, you heard his soul.\n\n-♪ Du bist die Ruh ♪ ♪ Der Friede mild ♪ -Every year, there was a gala concert, and the gala concert meant that Roland Hayes was coming.\n\nRoland Hayes' program consisted of a group of Italian classics, German lieder, and French art songs.\n\n-♪ ...dir ♪ ♪ Voll Lust und Schmerz ♪ -He would end it with Negro spirituals, and that was the only English on the program.\n\nBut there were a group of people who said, \"Well, I think now we should have our Marian on the program because if she sings, we'll know what she's singing about.\"\n\n[ Laughs ] -Roland Hayes realized Marian Anderson's ability, and he, in fact, gave her a big break in 1917.\n\nHe invited Marian Anderson to do the contralto part of Felix Mendelssohn's \"Elijah\" in Boston at Jordan Hall.\n\n-♪ Oh, rest in the Lord ♪ ♪ Wait patiently ♪ ♪ For Him ♪ ♪ Wait patiently ♪ ♪ For Him ♪ -She was 20, and she got to meet a number of the best musicians in Boston.\n\n-Roland Hayes would introduce Marian Anderson to his voice teacher, Arthur Hubbard.\n\nArthur Hubbard made an offer to Marian Anderson that he would help her to refine her voice, and in exchange, she would do maid service.\n\n-♪ Wait ♪ ♪ Wait ♪ -Roland Hayes thought it would be a wonderful opportunity because I could even go to the studio and hear lessons of other people.\n\nMy grandmother didn't know what the advantage would be.\n\nSo far as she was concerned, I could sing.\n\nSo to Boston I did not go.\n\n-Her grandmother did not want her to be a maid.\n\n[ Bell clanging ] Her first trip to the South in 1917, she was invited to sing by a Black organization in Savannah.\n\n-♪ Poor me ♪ ♪ Poor me ♪ -I went south while I was in high school, and my mother was my chaperone.\n\nWhen we got to Washington, we had to get out of the train and get into the first coach.\n\nThe coach was called the Jim Crow Car.\n\n-♪ Poor me ♪ -Anna and Marian thought they were going to be in a normal rail car, and it was shocking.\n\nShe had all these images as they were on the train of night riders, vigilantes coming to take her off the train.\n\nNothing like that happened, but she was terrified all the way down.\n\n-It meant, of course, that one had to sit up all night, and that was what we did.\n\n-♪ Poor me ♪ -I noticed some of my people were embarrassed to the very core.\n\nThere were others who accepted what they were having to live through.\n\nThey were not in the position to do anything at all.\n\n-♪ Poor me ♪ -It was certainly necessary to do something about it.\n\n-♪ Trouble will ♪ ♪ Bury ♪ ♪ Me ♪ ♪ Down ♪ -When she got to Savannah, they got a very warm welcome from the Black community, and it turned out to be a good experience for her.\n\n♪♪ -In the summer of 1919, Marian Anderson traveled to Chicago for a six-week opera course.\n\nShe's coming from Philadelphia to Chicago during a time of unrest in the city.\n\n-What you have is a growing Black population, and there's tensions between the Black population and the white population.\n\n-An African-American young man had floated in the lake to the wrong side.\n\nThey threw a rock and hit him.\n\nAnd he died.\n\nThere was a race riot.\n\n-When she sang \"The Crucifixion\" in the 1950s, you could hear the memories of the South and the riots of 1919.\n\n-♪ They crucified ♪ ♪ My Lord ♪ ♪ And He never said ♪ ♪ A mumblin' word ♪ ♪ They crucified ♪ ♪ My Lord ♪ ♪ And he never said ♪ ♪ A mumblin' word ♪ ♪ Not

Chicago, she entered the competition of the National Association of Negro Musicians.\n\nThey were having their first festival.\n\nAnd Marian Anderson won the competition.\n\nShe sang the aria \"Adieu, Forets\" by Tchaikovsky.\n\nAnd it's Joan of Arc's aria.\n\n[ Marian singing \"Adieu, Forets\" ] ♪♪ -The Chicago Defender runs a spectacular review of her singing, says everyone should hear this young woman sing.\n\nIt kicks her up to another level, and she's becoming known around the Black institutions.\n\n[ Marian singing \"Adieu, Forets\" ] ♪♪ -Marian wanted to study music on a higher education scale.\n\n-Her Aunt Mary encouraged her to try to get with a white music school, and the woman at the desk insults her, says, you know, \"We don't take colored here.\n\nWhat are you doing here?\n\nYou don't belong here.\"\n\n-It was more a shock to me coming from a young person.\n\nIf it had been an old person, a sour-looking person, it would never have been quite a shock, but that there was a young person to come out bluntly and say, \"We don't take colored,\" I was not prepared for it.\n\n♪♪ I felt for the moment that all of my dreams were just shattered around my head.\n\n[ Marian singing \"Adieu, Forets\" ] ♪♪ [ Indistinct conversations ] ♪♪ -Prior to the '20s, most people didn't graduate from high school.\n\nYou were lucky if you had a year or got through the eighth grade.\n\nAnna really wanted Marian to finish.\n\nOne thing that helped her was that she always looked younger than she was.\n\nShe graduated from high school at 24.\n\nWhile she's still in her early twenties, she meets Orpheus Fisher, known as King Fisher.\n\n-There was this very tall and fine-looking young man in the door, and as I tried to get in, he stretched his arms across the door and wouldn't let me in, all the time grinning and giggling.\n\n-Orpheus Fisher came from a solidly middle-class family, all of whom had light skin.\n\nHe could pass for white, easily, and sometimes he did.\n\n-When I went in, I met another very charming young man, much shorter than the one whom I'd seen at the door, but I could see a very strong family resemblance.\n\n♪♪ One brother would come over to see me, and then they would both come together for quite a while.\n\nAnd then one day, the one who had stood in the doorway, he moved his hand across the back of the sofa and touched my shoulder.\n\nAnd I saw the little paper, so I took it as discreetly as I could and looked at it.\n\nIt said, \"This affair between you and my brother has got to stop.\"\n\n[ Laughs ] ♪♪ When my young man was finished with school, he would come over to our house.\n\nWe saw a good deal of each other for quite some time.\n\nWe knew that we would marry.\n\n♪♪ -\"My dearest Marian, I shall be waiting for you with open arms.\n\nLove always, Orpheus.\"\n\n♪♪ -♪ Every time I feel the spirit moving in my heart ♪ ♪ I will pray ♪ ♪ Every time I feel the spirit moving in my heart ♪ ♪ I will pray ♪ ♪ 'Pon

old shoe.\"\n\n[ Laughs ] -When you find somebody talented like Marian Anderson, what the church does is recognize, \"Let us put some resources so we can help build that talent, because her success is our success.\"\n\n-We were invited to sing at as many churches as we could possibly go.\n\n♪♪ From the YWCA to the YMCA to the Methodist Church, to the Episcopal Church, to the Baptist Church.\n\nThere was always something given at different churches.\n\nAnd sometimes in an evening I would appear at three different places singing the same song, which I played myself.\n\nSometimes I would arrive home with a dollar, sometimes a dollar and a half, sometimes two dollars.\n\nI was as busy -- you cannot imagine -- and my aunt would run with me from one place to the other.\n\n♪♪ On one of these occasions, Billy King showed up, whispered in my ear and said, \"May I?\"\n\nI was absolutely thrilled to pieces.\n\n-Billy King was a very talented musician.\n\nHe was an accompanist for a variety of musicians, including Roland Hayes.\n\n-He suggested that in order to raise money, he would set up a United States tour.\n\nTheir musical relationship would take off.\n\n♪♪ -The tours that we took, Billy and I, carried us mostly in the South.\n\nOne felt that now we're getting to have a career.\n\n-In 1923, Billy King had become her manager.\n\n-We sang in the Negro colleges and universities and churches.\n\n♪♪ -She couldn't have traveled the way she did in the South and the Midwest in those years without Billy.\n\nA single Black woman alone would have been very, very dangerous for her.\n\nI think he wanted to marry her.\n\nHe was jealous of Orpheus Fisher.\n\n-I didn't have that same feeling about Billy.\n\nIn a way, he was a boyfriend without the other things that go with it.\n\n-\"Is that Billy King staying in his place?\n\nI'm dying to see you and hear about all of the things that you have done and planning on doing.\n\nAlways yours, Orpheus.\"\n\n-Billy King was able to make money, and I was able to make money.\n\nAll of this led up to bigger concerts and longer tours and appearances in places where one might attract the attention of people who were not only church people or college people.\n\nAnd one day, one picked up the phone and called the Wanamaker Store.\n\nI had never had the satisfaction in my life that I got the morning I told Miss Hennessy in as breezy a tone as I could muster up that my mother would not be coming back to work there anymore.\n\nThere was a small house on Martin Street.\n\nMother and I put money in together to get the little house.\n\nThen we went to Mr. Boghetti.\n\nIn the studio, one had a completely new and different training.\n\n-Giuseppe Boghetti was a dynamic vocal coach and artist based out of Philadelphia, and he was known around the world.\n\nMr. Boghetti had a full slate of students and didn't feel that he could fit in one more.\n\n-The song which we sang for Mr. Boghetti was \"Deep River.\"\n\n-♪ Deep river ♪ -She was able to deliver \"Deep River\" with such artistry that Mr. Boghetti said he would take her right away.\n\n♪♪ -Among the things which Mr. Boghetti gave me to learn was the \"Ave Maria,\" and he gave me to learn the three verses, and it seemed to me to be the longest and the most drawn-out and the most uninteresting thing that there was.\n\nAnd I did not know any German, and it was really a great trouble.\n\nThe \"Ave Maria\" was put by the side.\n\n-He had a particular approach to classical music, and it was, you know, bel canto, which really favored

same bundle.\"\n\n[ Laughs ] ♪♪ There was a business of getting a home.\n\nWe looked in Long Island, and I think we looked in New Jersey for a place, and then we finally came to Connecticut.\n\n-Danbury would have been like the rest of the country.\n\nThe country still was very segregated.\n\n-There were no African-Americans living there.\n\nYou know, they tried to purchase 50 acres, and they had to send Orpheus, who looked white.\n\n-To cut the deal to sell the property was probably a normal thing for them to do, but then they learn that he's married to Marian Anderson, and the deal now is off.\n\nThe sellers were saying that, \"If we sell you the property, then the property around that would have no real value.\"\n\n-They expanded the purchase to 100 acres.\n\nThey thought that would scare them off.\n\nBut they did -- they did buy the 100 acres and they had a real farm there.\n\n-The horses that we have here, when they see you coming, they'll come up to the gate

machine, a portable radio, typewriter, and several cooking utensils.\n\n-She gave more concerts per year than any other artist in the United States.\n\nShe was always on the road.\n\nThere were times when Marian sang two concerts, one to whites and one to Blacks.\n\nThey wouldn't allow for any mixing.\n\nBut what she preferred was vertical segregation.\n\nShe thought that was a decent compromise.\n\n-Vertical segregation meant that the auditorium had a line down the middle from the balcony down to the orchestra seats, and Blacks sat on one side and whites on the other.\n\n-In 1951, she did a concert in Richmond, Virginia, and they had vertical segregation.\n\nAnd the NAACP, they picket her concert, and she was very embarrassed and kind of hurt by it.\n\nBut Walter White and others prevailed upon her and argued and finally persuaded her that it was just time.\n\n-We asked that there be absolutely no segregation in our audiences.\n\nAnd immediately, those persons who had sponsored our concerts had to make a choice.\n\n♪♪ Six to eight concerts which we would ordinarily have, we do not have.\n\n♪♪ -1955 -- that was the year of the \"implementation\" decision, the

year that Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a Montgomery bus and triggered the Montgomery bus boycott, which made Martin Luther King Jr. the American Gandhi and introduced nonviolent direct action on a mass scale to the American Civil Rights Movement.\n\n-In 1955, Marian Anderson practically ended the racial barrier in opera for people of color at the Metropolitan Opera.\n\n-Mr. Hurok gave one of his fabulous parties.\n\nMr. Bing, who came over.\n\nIt was very casual.\n\nAnd without any ceremony at all, he said, \"Would you be interested in singing with the Metropolitan?\"\n\nAnd so I said, as casually as I could, \"Oh, I think I would.\"\n\n-Rudolf Bing was the general manager.\n\nHe wanted to have a Black person on that stage.\n\nHe wanted someone that had worldwide attention, and she was absolutely the best option for that.\n\n-People warned Rudolf Bing not to do it.\n\n♪♪ -The greatest dream as one grew older was to be able one day to sing on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera.\n\nAnd then came the day.\n\nWhen we came to the Metropolitan, there was a man who said immediately, \"Welcome home.\"\n\n-I don't think there are many people who debut at the Metropolitan Opera close to 60 anymore.\n\nI don't even think it was normal at that time.\n\n-She made her debut as Ulrica in \"Un Ballo in Maschera.\"\n\nShe was the witch.\n\n-Not a person that you think would be singing Ulrica because the character of Ulrica is rather gross.\n\nShe didn't go there to try to sing the Ulrica that they were used to seeing.\n\nShe came on with a dignity.\n\n-I've read about her that she didn't feel confident with her acting skills.\n\n-But she'd never fleshed out characters on stage before because she wasn't allowed to do that.\n\nIn the operatic world, the sopranos always are the leading ladies.\n\nI've sung some of Marian Anderson's pieces, and they were out of my tessitura, meaning they were out of my range, and my voice is classified as a higher voice than hers.\n\nIt's one of the reasons that I believe that Marian Anderson was not classified as a soprano is because that would mean that she would be the love interest of a white counterpart, which was not accepted at all at the time.\n\n[ Brakes squeal ] -The night of the performance, there was electricity in the air that you could almost cut with a knife.\n\nI was nervous.\n\n[ Marian
