Each dresser is given a satin finish with our water-based stain that highlights the natural Ash grain. The six spacious drawers offer ample storage for baby essentials, clothing and bulky items, while the removable dividers allow parents to create compartments suited for stacking diapers or holding little items such as socks that tend to get lost in big drawers.",
