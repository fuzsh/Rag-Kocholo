        "text": "Serve where you live: Engage Dallas\n\nEngage Dallas is a place-based community engagement initiative via SMUâ€™s Residential Commons to address community needs focusing on South and West Dallas. The initiative is a long-term, university-wide commitment led by students to partner with local residents, organizations, and other leaders to positively impact the community. There is equal emphasis on campus and community impact stemming from the initiative.\n\nIn Loyd Commons, we focus on Youth Engagement & Outreach as a community need in Dallas. Loyd students address this by collaborating on service events and activities with local partners Mercy Street, Girl Scouts of Northeast Texas and The West Dallas STEM School to directly help those most in need. Our students who serve gain a broader understanding of current social problems, build community with both the city and their peers, and can earn their Community Engagement and Civics & Individual Ethics proficiencies required for graduation. Engage Dallas cultivates unique and enriching experiences for SMU students to explore and serve Dallas!\n\nStart serving today!"
