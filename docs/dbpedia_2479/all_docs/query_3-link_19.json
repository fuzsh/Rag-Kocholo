        "meta_description": "1 print on wove paper : lithograph printed in pale green, buff, and black ; image 54 x 41.1 cm. | A large, elaborate allegory predicting the triumph of the Union over the dark forces of the Confederacy and \"King Cotton.\" A published key accompanying the print describes the secession of the South in heavily moralistic terms, as the workings of an insidious \"Hydra of human discord,\" spawner of treachery and rebellion. The composition is divided into a lower and upper half. Below are the forces of darkness, ruled over by King Cotton, an alligator-headed monarch whose body is a sack of cotton. As the key describes, he \"roars through the south the reeking monster--It reviles and tears asunder the bonds of a free and united humanity, and raises with the power of arms the banner of secession. The bowie-knife and dagger, the revolver, the lash and a bloodhound, are the titles to his rights to the golden crown and ermine, which a benighted people yet honours as a sacred symbol. Sighing under the feet of the tyrant the imploring looks of the slave turn heavenward.\" The monster sits on a throne, before a burning column with the words \"Lecompton\" (the controversial proslavery Kansas constitution passed in 1857), \"Fugitive Slave [Law],\" and \"Missouri Compromise.\" He has pistols and daggers in his belt. One of King Cotton's paws is placed on a manacled slave, who looks upward toward a \"sublime apparition\" which appears in an aureole of clouds. Here Freedom, wearing an Indian bonnet and holding a liberty cap, appears with a large American flag amid a crowd of deities and historical figures, including George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson. Freedom is attended by Christianity (left) and Justice (right). Immediately in front of her is \"Humanitas,\" borne by an eagle and holding an infant and reaching down toward the supplicant slave below. The eagle fiercely clutches the hem of King Cotton's ermine cloak and wields several lightning bolts, which have ignited the terrified monarch's throne. Equally terrorized by the vision are the hideous Hydra of Discord and her followers, who appear in the shadowy background below. The Hydra, accompanied by a hound \"Fugitive Slave Law,\" crowds of overseers or planters, and a Spaniard, who drops a package marked \"Cuba $50,000,000,\" are driven into the sea. Near the shore appears a dinghy holding several slaves. A moored ship is visible in the distance. Entwined in the decorative lower border of the illustration is a dead rattlesnake. Below, in the margin, are eighteen lines of verse from Lord Byron's 1813 poem \"The Giaour.\"",

Therefore, it does not license or charge permission fees for use of such material and cannot grant or deny permission to publish or otherwise distribute the material.\n\nUltimately, it is the researcher's obligation to assess copyright or other use restrictions and obtain permission from third parties when necessary before publishing or otherwise distributing materials found in the Library's collections.\n\nFor information about reproducing, publishing, and citing material from this collection, as well as access to the original items, see: American Cartoon Print Filing Series - Rights and Restrictions Information\n\nRights Advisory: No known restrictions on publication.\n\nReproduction Number: LC-DIG-pga-02893 (digital file from original print) LC-USZ62-68236 (b&w film copy neg.)\n\nCall Number: PGA - Traubel--Triumph (D size) [P&P]\n\nAccess Advisory: ---\n\nObtaining Copies\n\nIf an image is displaying, you can download it yourself. (Some images display only as thumbnails outside the Library of Congress because of rights considerations, but you have access to larger size images on site.)\n\nAlternatively, you can purchase copies of various types through Library of Congress Duplication Services.\n\nIf a digital image is displaying: The qualities of the digital image partially depend on whether it was made from the original or an intermediate such as a copy negative or transparency. If the Reproduction Number field above includes a reproduction number that starts with LC-DIG..., then there is a digital image that was made directly from the original and is of sufficient resolution for most publication purposes.\n\nIf there is information listed in the Reproduction Number field above: You can use the reproduction number to purchase a copy from Duplication Services. It will be made from the source listed in the parentheses after the number.\n\nIf only black-and-white (\"b&w\") sources are listed and you desire a copy showing color or tint (assuming the original has any), you can generally purchase a quality copy of the original in color by citing the Call Number listed above and including the catalog record (\"About This Item\") with your request.\n\nIf there is no information listed in the Reproduction Number field above: You can generally purchase a quality copy through Duplication Services. Cite the Call Number listed above and include the catalog record (\"About This Item\") with your request.\n\nPrice lists, contact information, and order forms are available on the Duplication Services Web site.\n\nAccess to Originals\n\nPlease use the following steps to determine whether you need to fill out a call slip in the Prints and Photographs Reading Room to view the original item(s). In some cases, a surrogate (substitute image) is available, often in the form of a digital image, a copy print, or microfilm.\n\nIs the item digitized? (A thumbnail (small) image will be visible on the left.)\n\nYes, the item is digitized. Please use the digital image in preference to requesting the original. All images can be viewed at a large size when you are in any reading room at the Library of Congress. In some cases, only thumbnail (small) images are available when you are outside the Library of Congress because the item is rights restricted or has not been evaluated for rights restrictions.\n\nAs a preservation measure, we generally do not serve an original item when a digital image is available. If you have a compelling reason to see the original, consult with a reference librarian. (Sometimes, the original is simply too fragile to serve. For example, glass and film photographic negatives are particularly subject to damage. They are also easier to see online where they are presented as positive images.)\n\nNo, the item is not digitized. Please go to #2.\n\nDo the Access Advisory or Call Number fields above indicate that a non-digital surrogate exists, such as microfilm or copy prints?\n\nYes, another surrogate exists. Reference staff can direct you to this surrogate.\n\nNo, another surrogate does not exist. Please go to #3.\n\nIf you do not see a thumbnail image or a reference to another surrogate, please fill out a call slip in the Prints and Photographs Reading Room. In many cases, the originals can be served in a few minutes. Other materials require appointments for later the same day or in the future. Reference staff can advise you in both how to fill out a call slip and when the item can be served."
