        "text": "Adrienne Maloof’s sons have been leaving the nest of her Los Angeles mansion over the past year, and she’s been sure to document the bittersweet process.\n\nIn August 2022, The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alum helped her eldest child, Gavin, whom she shares with ex-husband Dr. Paul Nassif, get ready for college (the former couple also share twins Christian and Colin). Adrienne couldn’t help but get emotional during that moment, documenting her experience on Instagram starting with some back-to-school shopping.\n\n“Getting supplies for my son who is preparing for college… So sad,” she captioned a snapshot that showed various shopping bags and household items loaded into the trunk of her car. The mom of three added a teary-face emoji plus the hashtags “college bound” and “bittersweet.”\n\nA few days later, Adrienne shared another photo of a Target run she made for Gavin to prep him for his first year away from home. “Today is Gavin’s first day at school, I had to leave him and it was the saddest day! Definitely one of the saddest of my life,” she wrote.\n\nThis year, Adrienne is packing up another son for college, and she was sure to take a few photos of that process as well.\n\nAdrienne Maloof’s Son’s Dorm Room\n\nOn August 16, the Beverly Hills mom took to Instagram to share how she was moving one of her sons into his freshman dorm room, documenting the space while sharing her concerns.\n\n“Moving my son into his first day of college life. It’s all about the bare necessities for now,” she captioned the post, which showed the minimally decorated space — as Adrienne noted, for now.\n\nWhile the small bedroom featured a desk, chair, dresser, and a raised bed with storage space underneath, Adrienne was already bringing her design eye and penchant for decor to her ideas for the room.\n\n“I wish I could bring some fresh flowers to brighten up the place a bit,” Adrienne completed her caption. Considering her role as a decor queen in our book, we wouldn’t be surprised if the proud mom was able to spice up the space.\n\nMore Details on Adrienne Maloof’s Sons\n\nTime flies for sure, and we honestly cannot believe how quickly Adrienne and Paul’s three boys have grown before our eyes.\n\nTake a look at some of the adorable photos below of Adrienne and her sons to see just how much they’ve grown. We can’t wait to keep up with all their adventures in college!"
