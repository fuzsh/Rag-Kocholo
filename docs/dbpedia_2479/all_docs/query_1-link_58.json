Fox News can now project that Texas Senator Ted Cruz has won Iowa.\n\n>> Ted Cruz wins the Republican contest here in Iowa.\n\n>> Tonight is a victory for courageous conservatives across Iowa and all across this great nation.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Senator Ted Cruz had defeated Donald Trump in the first contest for the 2016 presidential nomination.\n\n>> Ted Cruz took on Donald Trump toe-to-toe and prevailed.\n\n>> Clearly, a majority of Iowans didn't want to make a deal with Donald Trump.\n\n>> It's going to be very interesting to see how Donald Trump will react to the fact that he's now been beaten.\n\n>> The big question now: how is Donald Trump going to handle a loss?\n\n>> NARRATOR: Trump's response a sign of what was to come.\n\n>> \"Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it.\"\n\n>> You have tweeted that Senator Ted Cruz stole the Iowa election.\n\n>> Everything about it was disgraceful.\n\nIt was a fraud, as far as I was concerned.\n\n>> \"The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated-- a total fraud.\"\n\n>> Knowing what we know now, I think you would go back to February 1st of 2016 as the beginning.\n\n>> It's a total voter fraud, when you think of it, and actually, I came in, probably, first, if you think about it.\n\n>> That episode was a bright red blinking light foreshadowing everything that was to come, and just what a danger to democracy that this man posed.\n\n>> This is a pattern for Trump.\n\nHe has done this every step of the way through his career, long before politics.\n\n>> ♪ Money, money, money, money ♪ >> When \"The Apprentice\" lost an Emmy to \"The Amazing Race,\" he claimed that the Emmy contest was rigged.\n\n>> \"'Amazing Race' winning an Emmy again is a total joke.\n\nThe Emmys have no credibility.\"\n\n\"The Emmys are all politics.\n\nThat's why 'The Apprentice' never won.\"\n\n>> The public is smart, they know it's a con game.\n\n(crowd cheers and applauds) >> I have just called President Obama to congratulate him on his victory.\n\n>> He claimed that the election was rigged in 2012, when Mitt Romney, whom he had endorsed, lost to Barack Obama.\n\n>> \"This election is a total sham and a travesty.\n\nWe are not a democracy.\"\n\n\"More reports of voting machines switching Romney votes to Obama.\"\n\n\"Let's fight like hell and stop this great and disgusting injustice!\"\n\n\"We can't let this happen.\n\nWe should march on Washington.\"\n\n>> Every step along the way, anything he has ever lost, it's because somebody else has cheated and stolen it from him.\n\n>> NARRATOR: For those watching closely, it was a signal of trouble ahead.\n\n>> This certainly was a moment that set off alarm bells.\n\nTo be a small D democrat means to know how to lose elections.\n\nAnd a democracy can't survive if politicians and political parties don't know how to lose.\n\nI mean, sometimes people have even said democracy is for losers.\n\nIt's a system that allows losers to come back and fight another day, and so, if the losers deny that they've lost, the system can't endure.\n\n♪ ♪ (sirens blaring) >> NARRATOR: In Washington, some in the Republican Party were sounding the alarm about the threat Trump posed.\n\nBill Kristol was one of what were called the \"never Trumpers.\"\n\n>> I was publicly saying that Trump was unacceptable, people shouldn't support him.\n\nThey should make clear they couldn't support him in the general election, even.\n\nThey should band together against him.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Kristol had been born into conservative royalty.\n\nHis father, Irving, the godfather of the neoconservative movement.\n\nHe was chief of staff for Vice President Quayle in the George H.W.\n\nBush White House.\n\nFounded the conservative magazine \"The Weekly Standard.\"\n\nKristol saw danger in Trump's appeal.\n\n>> He had a real feel for people's anxieties and unhappiness about various things.\n\nHe was willing to stoke those anxieties and, and, uh, hatreds, in some cases-- resentments-- in ways that other politicians weren't willing to.\n\n>> Take three, start the recording.\n\n>> I don't know anything about David Duke, okay?\n\nI don't know anything about white supremacy or white supremacists... >> At the time, we used words like \"unconventional\" and \"nontraditional.\"\n\n>> \"Oh, I don't know what I said!\n\nUh, I don't remember!\"\n\n>> But in hindsight, yeah, looking back, there were red flags left and right about what kind of leader Donald Trump was going to be.\n\nThis was not someone who supported democratic ideals.\n\nThis was, in very real terms, an anti-democratic candidate, someone who had very clear authoritarian and autocratic tendencies.\n\nYou see the pattern looking back now.\n\n>> We're going to be so strong.\n\nWe're going to be so tough.\n\nWe're going to be so vicious.\n\nAnd we're going to knock them for a loop.\n\nWe have no choice.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Adding to the never Trumpers' alarm, a dangerous fervor among some of his supporters.\n\n>> Donald Trump liberated a certain portion of America-- hyper-nationalist, reactionary, semi-military elements, using the language that was common in these arenas.\n\nThey saw him as the best hope of translating their paranoia, their contempt, their anxiety, their anger, into a political platform, and into public policy.\n\n>> You know, knock the crap out of him, would you?\n\nJust knock the hell-- I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees, I promise.\n\n>> There were many, many signals throughout 2016 that this was not just a showman, but no, somebody who had definite authoritarian sympathies.\n\nAnd there was violence at his rallies that he openly encouraged.\n\nI mean, it wasn't a joke.\n\n>> There's a guy, totally disruptive, throwing punches.\n\nI love the old days.\n\nYou know what they used to do to guys like that when they were in a place like this?\n\nThey'd be carried out on a stretcher, folks.\n\nI'd like to punch him in the face, I'll tell you.\n\nAh, it's true.\n\n>> The nastier he got, the more excited the crowd got.\n\nAnd rather than trying to clamp that down and sort of pull back, he egged on the crowd further.\n\nAnd that dynamic of the angry crowd and the demagogic leader fomenting anger and, and using violent rhetoric was a sign that this was somebody who had no democratic core, liberal democratic core.\n\nAnd it was not clear what the limits of this style of politics were, so I think that was, that was very frightening.\n\n♪ ♪ >> NARRATOR: With Trump's emerging embrace of authoritarian behavior, a moment of decision for Republicans.\n\n>> They had a choice.\n\nThey could have taken steps to prevent Trump's nomination.\n\nOr if that seemed illegitimate because he won the primary, they could've renounced him.\n\nThey could've refused to endorse him.\n\nThe Republican Party was the one group of individuals with the power to isolate Trump.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Some tried.\n\n>> Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud.\n\nHis promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University.\n\n>> This is the party of Abraham Lincoln.\n\nThis is not the party of David Duke, Donald Trump.\n\n>> NARRATOR: But most Republican leaders didn't.\n\n>> I'm going to continue to avoid, uh, weighing in on the presidential contest at this point.\n\n>> I don't really know him.\n\nWe're going to obviously get to know each other if he gets the nomination.\n\nWe'll cross those bridges when we get to it.\n\n>> And he could be our nominee, but, but I think I don't want to comment on something hypothetical.\n\n>> It was vertigo-inducing, because it showed me that either I had gone crazy, or everybody else had gone crazy.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Mona Charen's conservative credentials were earned in the Reagan White House.\n\nShe was surprised by what she was seeing among Republicans.\n\n>> I didn't know what world I was living in.\n\nIt felt really Alice in Wonderland-esque.\n\nUm, the, the things I thought were solid were not.\n\nAnd it was very disorienting.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Republican Congressman Mark Sanford, once the governor of South Carolina, was not as surprised.\n\n>> At that time, a number of people were just thinking this can't go far.\n\nTherefore, I'll just look the other way, because... it doesn't matter.\n\nAnd because the, the thing that drives 99% of the folks in politics is self-preservation.\n\nYou know, to make noise might not be good in terms of my own political interests.\n\nTherefore, I'll stay quiet.\n\n>> This makes back-to-back victories for Donald Trump, dominating his third... >> NARRATOR: They expected Trump to flame out.\n\n>> Donald Trump is the projected winner of the... >> We love Nevada, we love Nevada.\n\n>> NARRATOR: But in state after state, he was racking up wins.\n\n>> Marco Rubio is suspending... >> Jeb Bush dropped out, ending his dream... >> NARRATOR: The last viable Republican opponent: Ted Cruz.\n\n>> The voters have a right to know... >> No, no, you're the liar.\n\nYou're the lying guy up here.\n\n>> It was really ugly.\n\nI mean, it got as deep into the mud as I can remember any primary contest getting.\n\nI mean, Donald Trump was, you know, implying that, that Ted Cruz's wife was unattractive.\n\n>> A picture is worth a thousand words.\n\n>> I don't get angry often.\n\nBut you mess with my wife, you mess with my kids, that'll do it every time.\n\nDonald, you're a sniveling coward.\n\nLeave Heidi the hell alone.\n\n>> If Ted Cruz brought a knife to the fight, Donald Trump brought a nuclear-tipped bazooka.\n\n>> You know, his father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald being, you know, shot.\n\nI mean, the whole thing is ridiculous.\n\nWhat is this... >> Cruz had watched as this man humiliated him, humiliated his wife, humiliated his father, in the most brazen and, and despicable way.\n\nAnd he felt at that moment that if he was going to lose, he needed to get a few things off of his chest.\n\n>> The man is utterly amoral.\n\nMorality does not exist for him.\n\nIf this man were to become president, think about the next five years.\n\nThe boasting, the pathological lying, the bullying.\n\nThink about your kids coming back and emulating this.\n\n>> The danger of what was unfolding between Cruz and Trump at that time was, \"You're a liar,\" \"No, you're a liar.\"\n\nOkay, you get a lot of that in politics, but in this case, what, what Ted Cruz was saying was absolutely the truth.\n\nAnd a lot of people in, in sort of political circles in D.C. knew it to be so, but weren't saying a word.\n\n>> NARRATOR: In the end, Ted Cruz would do the one thing Donald Trump hadn't back in Iowa-- concede.\n\n>> We gave it everything we've got.\n\nBut the voters chose another path.\n\nWe are suspending our campaign.\n\n>> No!\n\n>> Ted Cruz was an object lesson in what the Trump movement could do, even to a fairly reputable rock-ribbed conservative like Ted Cruz.\n\nYou saw Trump sweep Cruz onto the sidelines.\n\nThat was a lesson for the entire party.\n\nYou know, if that could happen to Ted Cruz, that could happen to anyone.\n\n>> Presumptive G.O.P.\n\npresidential nominee Donald Trump is celebrating... >> Donald Trump is promising to make a big effort to unify the G.O.P.\n\nover his presumptive nomination.\n\n>> Can the candidate who lives by slash-and-burn calm Republican jitters... >> NARRATOR: As the presumptive nominee arrived in Washington... >> Trump meeting with Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill today... >> Closed-door meetings... >> NARRATOR: ...the Republican establishment faced a decision.\n\n>> He'll try to reassure some members of Congress.\n\n>> Republicans had a crossroads in 2016.\n\nYou can win power, but it's going to be with this person, who has said all of these different things over the years that are offensive, who has a spotty record on business and politics.\n\nYou can win power, but it comes at this cost.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Senate Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan were both deeply skeptical, even as they publicly endorsed Trump.\n\n>> In 2016, I mean, there were countless Republicans who were very, very nervous about what a Trump presidency would mean for the country and for the party.\n\nThere was a lot of concern.\n\n(phone ringing) >> NARRATOR: One phone call would help change that.\n\n>> Mike Pence gets the phone call late one night.\n\nThe familiar voice of Donald Trump saying, \"Mike, it's gonna be great, it's gonna be amazing,\" and Pence says, \"I don't know if there's a question in there, but if there is, the answer is yes.\"\n\nAnd they laugh and he goes on to join the ticket.\n\n>> Donald Trump making it official that Indiana Governor Mike Pence will be his running mate.\n\n>> The fact that Mike Pence joined the ticket implicitly said that if I can tolerate this man, so can you.\n\nHe lent his credibility in Evangelical Christian circles to the cause of Donald Trump.\n\n>> I'm a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican in that order.\n\n(crowd cheers and applauds) >> NARRATOR: And Pence had his own reasons for deciding to join Trump.\n\n>> Mike Pence, the governor of Indiana, is in deep trouble politically.\n\nIt's not clear that he'll be able to win a second term.\n\nAnd so, here is Donald Trump with the, with the ability to offer Mike Pence a lifeline unlike any other, and put him on the national ticket.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Mike Pence would grab that political lifeline... >> For the sake of the sanctity of life... >> NARRATOR: Join Trump... >> For the sake of the Second Amendment of the Constitution... >> NARRATOR: And help win over conservative Republicans.\n\n>> For the sake of all the God-given liberties that are enshrined in our Constitution, Ohio, we must decide here and now that the next president to make appointments to the Supreme Court of the United States will be President Donald Trump.\n\n(crowd cheering) >> We often see throughout history political leaders contributing to damaging situations for democracy.\n\nBecause what they're doing is giving legitimacy to a political leader who actually doesn't deserve any legitimacy.\n\nAnd so it's a kind of devil's bargain that gets made out of personal ambition.\n\nWhat, what's so remarkable is the degree to which that repeats itself throughout history.\n\nAnd yet it seems as if people often don't learn, you know?\n\nAnd that's, again, a kind of tragic thing about, about democratic politics.\n\n>> It's game time for the Republican National Convention.\n\n>> The convention expected to fire up the G.O.P.\n\nbase... >> ...where Republican delegates will soon be gathering to officially nominate Donald Trump... >> NARRATOR: By the start of their convention, Republican leaders had, at least publicly, come to terms with Trump.\n\n>> The next time that there's a State of the Union address, I don't know where Joe Biden or Barack Obama are going to be, but you'll find me right there on the rostrum with Vice President Mike Pence and President Donald Trump.\n\n(crowd cheers and applauds) >> There was a lot of pressure towards the end to sort of just go along, because, you know, what's the real harm?\n\nHe's, he's going to, to lose.\n\nIn the end, it was still going to be a Clinton presidency.\n\n>> So with Donald Trump in the White House, Senate Republicans will build on the work we've done and pass more bills into law than any Senate in, in years.\n\n(crowd cheers and applauds) >> There's just one holdout, and it's Ted Cruz.\n\n>> NARRATOR: As runner-up, Ted Cruz had a prominent speaking slot at the convention.\n\nHe had to decide what to say about Trump.\n\n>> If you talked to Ted Cruz, he would say that it was a hard decision at the time.\n\nI know that he and his people struggled with how hard he was going to go after Donald Trump, whether he was going to name him at all in the speech.\n\n>> NARRATOR: His advisers were split.\n\nMost argued against legitimizing Trump.\n\n>> They're saying, \"Ted, not only did this man humiliate you and your family, but this man is undemocratic.\n\nThis man is anti-constitutional.\n\nThis man is downright un-American, the way that he talks about things.\n\nAnd you want to be on the right side of history here.\n\nThis isn't just about 2016 or 2020.\n\nIn the long run, you will be proven right by standing firm in your convictions and your fidelity to the Constitution and to the principles that you believe in.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: Cruz's campaign manager, Jeff Roe, was on the other side.\n\n>> If you're not going to endorse, then you probably shouldn't give the speech.\n\nBecause it's his convention, it's his party.\n\nAnd, you know, just pass on the speech.\n\nAnd, you know, if you want, if you want to give the speech, then you probably need to endorse.\n\n>> NARRATOR: It took days for Cruz to decide.\n\n>> He tells them his decision, that he's not going to endorse Donald Trump in his speech.\n\nAnd they ask him why.\n\nAnd Cruz looks at them and he says, \"History isn't kind to the man who holds Mussolini's jacket.\"\n\nAnd that's that, his decision's made.\n\n(crowd cheers and applauds) >> Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.\n\n(crowd cheering) >> NARRATOR: In that moment, Ted Cruz would withhold his endorsement.\n\n>> We deserve leaders who stand for principle, who unite us all behind shared values.\n\n>> In fact, that convention was in Donald Trump's hip pocket, and that speech went down very, very badly.\n\n>> That is the standard we should expect from everybody.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The crowd, hungry for an endorsement, was restless.\n\n>> Standing on the stage in front of the Republican Party, Ted Cruz basically came out and hanged himself.\n\n>> Vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust... >> Get out!\n\n>> Pull the plug!\n\n(crowd booing and shouting) >> (chanting): Endorse Trump!\n\n>> The crowd turned against Ted Cruz.\n\nThey were suddenly all with Trump and against Cruz.\n\nBooing him, trying to get him off stage.\n\n>> Get off the stage!\n\n(crowd booing) >> Get off the stage!\n\n>> God bless each and every one of you and God bless the United States of America.\n\n>> NARRATOR: To the surprise of Republican leaders, a new political base-- fervent, angry MAGA Republicans-- had made its voice heard.\n\n>> The biggest misunderstanding of the Trump era is that he leads the base and the base goes where he does.\n\nI actually think that he's created a monster that he doesn't even control.\n\nAnd he is actually very much driven by the base, not the other way around.\n\n(crowd booing) >> That night, immediately following the speech, Ted Cruz went into a bunker with his closest advisers.\n\nAnd I can tell you, from talking to two of the people who were in the room with him in those moments, that there was a real belief that his political career might be finished.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Cruz returned to Texas facing an uncertain political future.\n\n>> He was receiving lots of advice, imploring advice, saying to him, in effect, \"Ted, this is bad for the party, it's bad for Trump, but it's also really bad for you and for your future if you don't get on board the Trump train.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: He made his decision.\n\nHe would endorse the man he'd called \"a pathological liar,\" and go out on the campaign trail for him.\n\n>> Well, I'm here campaigning for Donald Trump.\n\nI'll make a point, I'm getting ready to get on a gigantic airplane that has Donald Trump's name painted on the side.\n\n>> (chuckling) >> If a guy goes out and calls your wife these certain things and says these certain things about your father, says these certain things about you... ...how you get up and say, \"It's all cool with me, you're my buddy\"?\n\nI don't get it.\n\nUh, that's not real.\n\nIt's about political self-preservation and trying to somehow stay politically relevant, and being blinded to one's political ambitions.\n\nAnd a lot of folks will give up most anything, as they're slaves to their own political ambition.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Republican leaders had backed a risky candidate.\n\n>> Thank you, thank you very much.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Now, yet another warning, as Trump offered a vision of a president as strongman.\n\n>> The crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon, and I mean very soon, come to an end.\n\n(crowd cheers and applauds) >> He was offering himself as the strongman.\n\nHe was offering himself as a leader who would do things that no other leader would do to bring order to the country.\n\n>> The time for action has come.\n\n(crowd cheers and applauds) Nobody knows the system better than me.\n\nWhich is why I alone can fix it.\n\n(crowd cheers and applauds) >> \"I alone can fix it\" is a pretty striking, classic strongman statement.\n\nIt was making himself the solution.\n\n>> ...so that I can be your champion in the White House, and I will be your champion.\n\n(crowd cheers and applauds) >> In democracy, at least in American democracy, in theory, the individual is supposed to be smaller than the institution of the presidency.\n\nAnd here we had a individual who was blatantly casting himself as bigger than any institution in the United States.\n\nNothing in that reflected the kind of personal or democratic humility that would be required of that office.\n\n>> I make this promise, we will make America strong again.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Once an outsider, Trump's politics were now becoming the Republican Party's.\n\n>> And we will make America great again.\n\nGod bless you, and good night.\n\nI love you!\n\n(crowd cheers and applauds) ♪ ♪ >> This was about winning an election, this was about maintaining power.\n\nThat's what this was about.\n\nIt is truly remarkable now to look back and see some of the things that Republican officials were willing to overlook, were willing to enable, and were willing to just kind of explain away for the sake of moving the candidate along.\n\n(band playing \"Hail to the Chief\") >> NARRATOR: The Republican establishment hadn't expected Donald Trump to win.\n\nAnd he had already signaled what he was prepared to do if he didn't.\n\n>> The election is being rigged in an effort to elect Hillary Clinton president.\n\nIt's one big ugly lie.\n\n>> NARRATOR: In the end, Trump didn't need to go there.\n\nHe defied the odds.\n\n>> What Donald Trump understood better than everyone else is that voters weren't playing by any playbook at all.\n\nThey didn't care.\n\nThey liked that Donald Trump was tearing up the playbook.\n\nThey liked that he wasn't following someone else's rules.\n\n>> Donald Trump will be the 45th president of the United States.\n\n>> His journey to the White House unlike any that's come before, and the first big step of his presidency... (siren blaring in distance) >> NARRATOR: The Republicans now had the Senate, the House, and the presidency.\n\nBut would they have any control over Trump?\n\n>> Trump really represents a lump of clay to many Republicans early in his presidency that can be formed and, and shaped by them.\n\nMany of them still viewed him as sort of a clown, as a buffoon, as somebody who was not to be taken terribly seriously.\n\nBut if they viewed him as an idiot, they viewed him as a useful idiot at that point.\n\n>> Hi, good morning.\n\nWelcome to the dawn of a new, unified Republican government.\n\nFeels really good to say that, actually.\n\n>> They thought he would be easy to manipulate.\n\nAnd it turned out he was the one doing the manipulating.\n\nFor me, that's really so much the bottom line of the Trump presidency and the Trump episode, in terms of the Republican Party and conservative elites.\n\nThey all thought they were going to manage him, to manipulate him, and he ended up being the one doing the manipulating.\n\n>> (chanting): You will not replace us!\n\n>> The torch-wielding white nationalists coming face to face... >> NARRATOR: The dangers of ignoring the warnings about Trump would become clear in Charlottesville.\n\n>> ...demonstration by white nationalists at the University of Virginia... >> (chanting): You will not replace us!\n\n>> NARRATOR: A moment that would foreshadow what was to come.\n\n>> Charlottesville was clearly a harbinger of, of the future.\n\n>> This is Trump's America!\n\n>> Because it was an expression of the white supremacist part of the Republican base, and, and of what was stirring in the country that, that Trump had tapped into.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The next day, as neo-Nazis and white nationalists gathered... >> Hi, hello, how're y'all doing?\n\n>> NARRATOR: ...former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke invoked Trump's campaign.\n\n>> We are determined to take our country back.\n\nWe're going to fulfill the promises of Donald Trump.\n\nThat's what we believed in.\n\nThat's why we voted for Donald Trump.\n\n>> Armed militia men also showed up... >> NARRATOR: Some of the same characters and groups would participate in the insurrection on January 6.\n\n>> Armed militia men, which is a very jarring image... >> Charlottesville was a long time coming.\n\nWhen Charlottesville happened, you could easily say the same thing that you could say about January 6-- this was inevitable.\n\nIt was always heading toward this.\n\nYou have a president of the United States who is willing to give tacit approval to some of the darkest elements of American politics.\n\n>> A lot of these forces have been part of the American fabric since its inception.\n\nBut what candidate Trump, and then President Trump, and, by default, a number of leaders in the Republican Party, did was give them space.\n\nWas give them oxygen.\n\n(people screaming) >> A man drives his vehicle into the crowd, killing Heather Heyer and wounding others.\n\nThis was a incident that was clearly the tail of these far right, white supremacist powers emboldened and out of control.\n\n>> Panic and horror in Charlottesville.\n\nA car slams into a crowd of counter protestors... >> A woman was killed when a man drove his car into a crowd, injuring 19 others... (people screaming) >> NARRATOR: For Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and other Republicans, shock at what happened in Charlottesville.\n\n>> He wasn't in Washington at the time.\n\nWe were needing to kind of track him down and discuss it, but it, very clear, obviously, right away, that this needed to be condemned.\n\nAnd that was clearly one of the fundamental moments where you have to make clear what's right and wrong.\n\nThere was no question about that.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Ryan and other Republicans were watching to see how Trump would react.\n\n>> So, you know, as far as I'm concerned, that was a horrible, horrible day.\n\nI think there's blame on both sides, and I have no doubt about it, and you don't have any doubt about it, either.\n\nBut you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides.\n\n>> I'm a reporter who has reported on race for a long time, and I never would have imagined the person in the office of the president calling people who go to a Nazi rally \"very fine people.\"\n\n>> But you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists, okay?\n\nThank you all very much.\n\nThank you.\n\n>> What about the Nazis who support you?\n\n>> It's probably the first time where the country realizes this is going to get bad.\n\nAnd it is the beginning of a time in America where people realize that America is not just a place where racist ideals can exist, but it's a place where racist ideals can be fueled by the White House.\n\n>> ...will have a tremendously positive impact on race relations.\n\n>> NARRATOR: For Republican outlier Bob Corker, it was the clearest sign yet of the threat Trump posed.\n\n>> It was very evident that it was a dog whistle to the groups who had come in and, and done what they did.\n\nNot unlike, by the way, the first video that was sent out after the January 6 event at the House, I mean, \"We love you, we...\" you know.\n\nThe president evidently did not want to discourage that type of activity-- as a matter of fact, wanted to encourage it.\n\n>> Very fine people, on both sides.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Troubled by Trump, Paul Ryan tried to walk a fine line.\n\n>> One of Paul Ryan's fundamental problems with him is his racism, the way that he flirts with racists.\n\nSeemingly, anybody who supports him is okay in his book, no matter what they believe.\n\n>> NARRATOR: He issued a strong statement on Twitter, but didn't mention the president by name.\n\n>> \"We must be clear.\n\nWhite supremacy is repulsive.\n\nThis bigotry is counter to all this country stands for.\n\nThere can be no moral ambiguity.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: Trump took it personally.\n\nHe called Ryan.\n\n>> Trump is on the phone with Paul Ryan and saying to the House speaker, \"Paul, you don't understand me, and you don't understand my political appeal.\"\n\n>> (chanting): You will not replace us!\n\n>> \"These are my people.\"\n\n>> You will not replace us!\n\n>> \"I'm standing with my people.\"\n\n>> (chanting): White lives matter!\n\n>> Ryan says, \"I don't care if they're your so-called your people, you have to disavow the white nationalists.\"\n\n>> (chanting): David Duke!\n\n>> Trump says, \"You don't get it, Paul.\n\nThese are my people.\"\n\n(phone tone buzzes) (receiver hangs up) >> When Trump says that \"those are my people,\" he's not inaccurate.\n\nHe knows who has been coming to his rallies, and who has been lending support to him.\n\nAnd really, more implicitly, he's saying that, \"These are our people,\" as in, \"This is now the core of the Republican Party.\"\n\nWhich is something that Paul Ryan seems to be loath to admit or to recognize.\n\n>> NARRATOR: In Washington, Republicans were pressed to respond about Trump and Charlottesville.\n\n>> It's a test.\n\n\"What are you going to do or say about this?\"\n\nBecause almost all of them disagree with him and, and felt, in fact, were disgusted by it.\n\n>> \"The hate and bigotry witnessed in Charlottesville does not reflect American values.\"\n\n>> Mitch McConnell, some of the other Republican leaders, they would come out or tweet or release statements that talked about how much they hated racism.\n\n>> \"Race-based supremacy movements have no place in our melting pot culture.\"\n\n>> But very few, and very few top Republicans, would say the president was wrong.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Vice President Mike Pence dodged the issue.\n\n>> Do you agree with the president that there were good people among the white supremacist protesters?\n\n>> What happened in Charlottesville was a tragedy, and I stand with the president and I stand by those words.\n\n>> He certainly was appalled at the events in Charlottesville.\n\nI have heard him say that behind closed doors.\n\nThe problem is, this is a White House where, if he said that, it would be in direct contradiction to sort of the side-stepping that the president was doing.\n\nBut by doing that, when you're Mike Pence, you're enabling it to happen again.\n\n>> So how do we account for the limp, listless, embarrassing silence from elected Republicans?\n\n>> A tweet doesn't cut it in this situation, it just doesn't.\n\n>> NARRATOR: In the end, Paul Ryan and the Republican leadership would move on, not confront Trump about the extremists among his supporters.\n\n>> They also have to reckon with a political consequence from allowing him to define the party in the way he is doing.\n\n>> Senator, do you mind stopping for just 30 seconds?\n\n>> It was a constant decision we were having to make every day.\n\nSome things were pretty fundamental, like Charlottesville, where you were, you had to speak with a moral voice about what was right and wrong, but it was also untenable to always be at war with him.\n\nYou can be fully against Donald Trump, you just can't be a Republican in Congress doing that.\n\n>> When the Republican Party didn't push back, that was the moment you realized that their surrender was complete.\n\nThat they were not ever going to stand against him.\n\nIf you didn't break with Donald Trump for Charlottesville, then basically, you were saying, \"We're, we're done.\"\n\nThat was a...\n\nThe acquiescence of Republicans after Charlottesville, I think, was, is, was really an inflection point.\n\n>> NARRATOR: There were a few elected Republicans who pushed back against the president, who warned about the threat he posed to democracy.\n\nOne of them was Jeff Flake.\n\n>> Jeff Flake had a fundamental criticism of Donald Trump as an authoritarian leader who was prepared to trample on, you know, on, on the constitutional norms and the pillars of democracy.\n\nAnd he was prepared to stand up and say that, not just once, but repeatedly, and he did a book about it.\n\n>> This is not behavior that we should condone.\n\nWe shouldn't be okay with this.\n\nThis is not normal.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Flake would become an example of the danger of speaking out.\n\n>> Well, I'm thrilled to be back in Phoenix, in the great state of Arizona.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Flake watched as Trump attacked him in front of his own voters.\n\n>> They all said, \"Please, Mr. President, don't mention any names.\"\n\n(crowd cheering) So I won't, I won't!\n\n>> It's about going back to the base to demonstrate how popular it is to be with the president, particularly in Jeff's own state.\n\n>> And nobody wants me to talk about your senator, who's weak on borders, weak on crime, so I won't talk about him!\n\n(crowd cheers and applauds) No, I will not mention any names!\n\n>> (chanting): Drain the swamp!\n\n>> I think he knew at that time that I was out of step with a lot of the Republican base, that he represented more of their feelings than I did.\n\n>> Thank you, Arizona, God bless you.\n\nThank you, thank you.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Jeff Flake decided not to run for re-election.\n\n>> Every person who came up who challenged him, Trump sought to destroy.\n\nLifelong Republicans, lifelong conservatives, he wrote them out of the party.\n\nHe made fun of them, he ridiculed them, he embarrassed them, and he destroyed them.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Another target, South Carolina conservative Republican Mark Sanford, who had been critical of Trump and his threat to democracy.\n\n>> \"Mark Sanford has been very unhelpful to me in my campaign to MAGA.\n\nHe is M.I.A.\n\nand nothing but trouble.\"\n\n>> It's not good when you're a lowly member of Congress and the president of the United States of your party is coming out against you.\n\nI mean, that's just not a good movie, it doesn't work out well, and it didn't.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Trump endorsed Sanford's Republican challenger.\n\n>> \"I fully endorse Katie Arrington for Congress in SC, a state I love.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: Sanford was a member of the hard-right Freedom Caucus.\n\nHe believed they would stand by him.\n\n>> At that time, Justin Amash-- I'll never forget this-- stood before, you know, the, the Freedom Caucus and said, \"Look, if Trump will come after Sanford like he did, then ultimately, he'll come after any one of us.\"\n\nAnd everybody is, like, looking at their feet, looking away, looking at their toes.\n\nAnd these are the folks that you thought were your friends, and you're going, \"Oh, my goodness, where am I?\"\n\nIt's mind-blowing.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Mark Sanford lost his primary.\n\nMore than three dozen Republicans decided not to run for re-election.\n\n>> Any particular individual who popped his head out above the foxhole was going to have it shot off.\n\nWhat they never did was all join hands, and that would have been, on many occasions, a much better and a winning strategy.\n\nAnd they never did see that if they acted in concert, they would have a lot more, a lot more power.\n\n>> NARRATOR: As Trump cleansed the G.O.P.\n\nof his critics, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell took notice.\n\n>> We know now that he did not like Donald Trump as a person.\n\nHe didn't believe that this was someone who necessarily should be in charge, should be the president of the United States.\n\nHe had concerns about some of his autocratic tendencies, as well.\n\n>> NARRATOR: But McConnell had other priorities.\n\n>> Mitch McConnell needed Donald Trump's signature on a tax cut.\n\nHe also needed conservative nominees that Mitch McConnell could easily sort of shepherd through the Senate, and, and then he would have his conservative judges.\n\n>> NARRATOR: McConnell traveled to the White House to make a deal.\n\n>> McConnell comes in, sits down in the Oval Office, and essentially, they come to a truce-- essentially, they come to an understanding.\n\n\"Let's not fight because there's no point in that.\n\nLet's figure out what we can get done together where we actually agree.\"\n\n>> They decided at that point that they were going to try to shelf everything that had happened up till then.\n\nAnd they were going to focus on two things.\n\nThey were going to focus on judges and they were going to focus on tax reform.\n\nAnd they did-- and they did.\n\n>> NARRATOR: In return, McConnell would give Trump what he wanted most-- loyalty.\n\n>> From that October 2017 meeting on, basically, Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump made their truce.\n\nDonald Trump, arguably, is the winner, because Mitch McConnell gets judges.\n\nDonald Trump gets the party.\n\nDonald Trump is now the owner, lock, stock, and barrel, of the Republican Party.\n\nIt is under new management.\n\nIt's under Trump management.\n\n>> One of the things that I've discovered, looking at similar situations throughout history, is that the establishment politician possesses a level of hubris, and sees the outsider and thinks, a-ha, this is somebody I can use for my own personal ambition.\n\nAnd this is a trend that repeats itself over and over.\n\nAnd I think we saw something analogous happen in the United States, where mainstream politicians overestimate their own capacities.\n\n(clock ticking) (\"Jingle Bells\" playing) >> It looks like President Trump is going to get his Christmas wish.\n\n>> Trump and McConnell, they've actually had a pretty successful couple of months here.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The bargain was consummated in public, as Republicans gathered to celebrate.\n\n>> Trump setting a record for getting his judicial nominees... >> NARRATOR: Judges.\n\n>> Neal Gorsuch plus a record number of Circuit Court... >> NARRATOR: And a tax cut.\n\n>> The most sweeping rewrite of our tax code... >> The tax cuts are the payoff, right?\n\nThe tax cuts are what you get for putting up with everything else.\n\n>> Republicans cheered as they passed the most sweeping tax overhaul in three decades.\n\n>> This is what we get as part of the trade-off.\n\nWe end up living with this clownish, scandalous, racist behavior in the White House, but in trade what we get is this great freedom to write the bill as we want, to cut the taxes, and to finally pass big legislation.\n\n>> I guess it's very simple.\n\nWhen you think you haven't heard this expression, but we are making America great again.\n\nYou haven't heard that, have you?\n\n>> NARRATOR: At the ceremony, McConnell and the other Republicans demonstrated their loyalty, praising the president.\n\n>> Well, let me just say, Mr. President, you made the case for the tax bill, but this has been a year of extraordinary accomplishment for the Trump administration.\n\nWe've cemented the Supreme Court right of center for a generation.\n\nYou've ended the overregulation of the American economy.\n\nThank you, Mr. President, for all you're doing.\n\n>> They're saying it because they've been well trained, by Trump, that in order to get anything that they want, they have to not just praise him, but, but be obsequious in their praise.\n\n>> Something this big could not have been done without exquisite presidential leadership.\n\nMr. President, thank you for getting us over the finish line.\n\nThank you for getting us where we are.\n\n>> They were warned, over and over and over again, about Donald Trump, who he was and what he was capable of doing.\n\nAnd they looked the other way.\n\nThey may have known the same thing.\n\nBut they thought they could ride the tiger.\n\nThey thought that the trade-off was worth it.\n\nThey thought, well, how bad can it possibly be?\n\nWhat could he possibly do?\n\n>> I serve with him every day.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is a man of his word.\n\nHe's a man of action.\n\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nThank you for your leadership.\n\nThank you for your love for this country and the people of this country.\n\nYou will make America great again.\n\n(crowd applauds) >> Rationalization is a very powerful force, it turns out, in human psychology.\n\nIt was a funny kind of choice, though, because it wasn't... You know, we read history books, and it's, like, this is the moment where you choose this or that.\n\nBut there are also ways in which you choose gradually, you know, and then incrementally, and the choice is more of an accommodation and a rationalization and an enabling.\n\nIt's not a sort of, I'm standing up here and choosing this path.\n\nSome did that.\n\nBut an awful lot went along, and they kept on going along, and then they had to rationalize why they were going along, so they became sort of enthusiastic about going along.\n\nAnd you can rationalize your way into a series of choices, which becomes a very damaging and dangerous choice.\n\n>> Starting with E17, H, okay.\n\nWe're going to start with the tag from the previous... >> Good evening from New York.\n\nI'm Chris Hayes.\n\nAlmost every day, we see the story of the corruption of this presidency.\n\n>> This is a president who has overseen the most corrupt administration in our history.\n\n>> NARRATOR: On the left, they were attacking the president at every turn.\n\n>> For Democrats, they had to figure out how to navigate this landscape in which the most vile, misogynistic, xenophobic, racist, violent, volatile elements of his rhetoric were okay with 60 million people.\n\n>> Donald Trump, again being a schmuck... >> And so where does that leave you?\n\n>> What I have here is a copy of Donald Trump's tax returns.\n\n>> The Trump administration's ongoing challenges with the truth... >> And I think that it was very difficult for them to figure out what their position would be, outside of simply opposing Donald Trump.\n\n>> What it means to have a president stained by racism.\n\n>> The president of the United States is racist.\n\n>> And into that vacuum came a kind of perpetual outrage system of the hyper-examination of everything that he did.\n\n>> Who can stop him?\n\nHe's the president of the United States.\n\n>> We can, and we have to.\n\n>> Our job is making sure that Donald Trump is a one-term president.\n\n>> The only thing that we can do is to start that impeachment inquiry.\n\n>> We must open an impeachment inquiry.\n\n>> Impeachment... >> Impeachment... >> Impeach... >> Impeachment... >> Today I say, \"Impeach 45.\"\n\n>> Because we're going to go in there, we're going to impeach the mother(bleep).\n\n>> NARRATOR: It became a partisan media maelstrom.\n\n>> Trump Derangement Syndrome.\n\nTheir only remaining principle is hatred of the president.\n\n>> The Democrats in this country hate this president more than they love America.\n\n>> Just another example of that, it's Trump Derangement Syndrome.\n\n>> The only thing that sort of saved Trump and restored Republican Party unity was Democrats overplaying their hand.\n\n>> I cannot tell you the amount of dysfunction that this president is advancing.\n\n>> And stretching too far in their attempts to convince the American public of what the American public, in many cases, already knew.\n\n>> Because the president of the United States is a dangerous, unstable, lying propagandist.\n\n>> The racism, the egomaniac that he is... >> Because of this relentless, day-in, day-out onslaught against Trump, it got to a place where many voters who had been reluctant to support Trump in 2016 came to view an attack on Trump as an attack on them.\n\n>> No matter what, you continue to make excuses for this man.\n\nDoesn't that make you just as bad, if not worse, than him?\n\n(clock ticking) >> NARRATOR: The partisan fever escalated with impeachment.\n\n>> I'm announcing the House of Representatives moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The ultimate constitutional check on a president.\n\n>> The president must be held accountable.\n\nNo one is above the law.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Republicans were once again at a crossroads with the president.\n\nLiz Cheney, arch-conservative from Wyoming, led their response.\n\n>> Liz Cheney is the sort of political daughter of Dick Cheney, the kind of Darth Vader figure in the Republican Party despised by Democrats.\n\nAnd Liz Cheney is a chip off the old block.\n\nShe is very much the hawk that her father was, very much the conservative that her father was.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Cheney became a staunch defender of Trump against Democrats' charges he abused his office by pressuring the Ukrainian president to dig up dirt on Joe Biden.\n\n>> The president pressured Ukraine's leader about eight times, eight times... >> Our Democratic colleagues have been working to remove this president since the day he was elected.\n\n>> Cheney led the charge in defending Trump, while excoriating Nancy Pelosi and her Democrats for what she believed was an unjust process, and essentially a witch hunt against the president.\n\n>> Nowhere in the Constitution does it say if you are angry at the president, or you are afraid you can't beat him in the next election, that you can just assume impeachable conduct, yet that's what the Democrats are doing.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Cheney held the Republicans in the House together.\n\nNone of them voted for impeachment.\n\n(gavel bangs) >> On this vote, article one is adopted.\n\n>> It's not just that they like Trump, it's that they really don't like the people who don't like Trump.\n\nSo, if the Democrats were up there screaming and hollering, making a big fuss out of it, then the natural reaction among a lot of Republicans is to kind of be contrarian and say, \"Well, wait a second.\"\n\nAnd to look for reasons to justify their vote to save Trump in office.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Cheney has said she doesn't regret her vote.\n\nBut Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger does.\n\n>> That's one of my greatest regrets is not voting for the first impeachment.\n\nOne of my criticisms of how the Democrats handled that was they rushed it.\n\nAnd I remember, it gave us...\n\nFrankly, it gave me an excuse to vote against impeachment.\n\nYou know, when you're stuck in that kind of a polarized moment, you're always looking for kind of a way out.\n\nAnd that's to my shame that that happened.\n\n>> Donald Trump, just the third American president to be impeached.\n\n>> ...deeply divided moment playing out in American history... >> NARRATOR: In the Senate trial, Mitch McConnell was in lockstep with the president.\n\nHe refused to even hear witnesses.\n\n>> Donald Trump is his conduit to power, and he wasn't going to put that at risk.\n\nIt was an indication of how far they were willing to go for Donald Trump.\n\nThat they would vote against even hearing witnesses at a time when there were some substantial issues being raised.\n\nBut the Republican Party had become absolutely determined to look the other way and to enable Donald Trump and not hold him accountable.\n\n>> In this article of impeachment, 52 senators have pronounced him not guilty.\n\nDonald John Trump, president of the United States, is not guilty as charged in the first article of impeachment.\n\n(audience cheers and applauds) >> This is what the end result is.\n\n(audience cheers and applauds) >> It was a disgusting display.\n\nI think there was profanity used, if memory serves.\n\n>> It was all bull(bleep).\n\n(audience laughs) We were treated unbelievably unfairly.\n\n>> He thought he was bulletproof.\n\nIt didn't constrain him.\n\nHe had just beaten impeachment.\n\nAnd I think that did have an effect on his future conduct, and not a good one.\n\n>> And Mitch McConnell, I want to tell you, you did a fantastic job.\n\n(audience applauds) >> The acquittal in the impeachment trial really just fit in to this bigger pattern, in which he became more audacious and more contemptuous of the rules that other people had to abide by, and more confirmed in the belief that those normal rules did not apply to him.\n\n>> Thank you very much, everybody.\n\nThank you, thank you very much.\n\n(audience cheers and applauds) >> Everything that happened after the failure to convict in that first impeachment, including Trump's attempt to steal the election, his fomenting of an insurrection, a violent insurrection at the Capitol, it flowed from that permission slip that he had been given after the first impeachment.\n\n(police radios running) (sirens wailing) >> Our great national wound of race has opened up once again.\n\n>> A new wave of grief in the form of police brutality.\n\n>> The police killing of George Floyd sparked a massive wave of protests against police brutality.\n\n>> They will demand justice for George Floyd and call for an end to racial inequality.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Fresh from his acquittal, once again, Trump was called to respond to the issue of race.\n\n>> A nationwide re-examination of race and justice... >> The crossroads of race and trauma, with the same question-- why does this keep happening?\n\n>> (chanting): I can't breathe!\n\n>> NARRATOR: And once again, his words and actions would tear at the fabric of democracy.\n\n>> Trump's instinct is to fuel the fire, not to put it out.\n\n>> \"These thugs are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won't let that happen.\n\nAny difficulty and we will assume control, but when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\n\nThank you!\"\n\n>> He's not calming things down.\n\nHe's amping it up.\n\n>> Say his name!\n\n>> George Floyd!\n\n>> President Trump making matters worse.\n\n>> Adding, \"When the looting starts, the shooting starts.\"\n\n>> Mirroring a racist phrase that was used back in the '60s.\n\n>> \"When the looting starts, the shooting starts,\" meaning they would not hesitate to use lethal force, violence necessary to subdue these people who they disagreed with on the other part of the political spectrum.\n\n>> (faintly): George Floyd!\n\nGeorge Floyd!\n\nGeorge Floyd!\n\nGeorge Floyd!\n\n>> Our nation has been gripped by professional anarchists, violent mobs, arsonists, looters, criminals, rioters, Antifa.\n\n>> It's Trump as reality TV star put together with Trump as strongman to send a signal of what he had said in that 2016 convention speech that, \"I alone can fix it.\"\n\n>> I will fight to protect you.\n\nI am your president of law and order... >> NARRATOR: Outside the White House, protesters were gathering across the street.\n\nAlso massing, law enforcement.\n\n>> As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel, and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults, and the wanton destruction of property.\n\n>> I saw a ton of Secret Service, law enforcement in riot gear, the attorney general parading around like some sort of dictator, to be honest with you, with rows and rows of law enforcement.\n\nAnd I thought to myself, I just knew.\n\nMy gut told me, I was, like, something bad is about to happen.\n\n>> And I was there that day.\n\nAnd all of a sudden, it was sort of like the running of the bulls in Pamplona, Spain.\n\nJust heard this chaos rumbling down the street.\n\n(object bangs, people shouting) It was a horrific moment.\n\nIt was not a scene we've seen in America in a long, long time.\n\n(people shouting, tear gas exploding) >> Watching armed officers in the nation's capital forcefully clear what were largely peaceful protesters calling for racial justice in America, it was a moment I never thought I would see in this country.\n\n(sirens wailing in distance) >> NARRATOR: It was a photo op, and a message.\n\nTrump was in charge.\n\n>> Seeing that image of him walking across Lafayette Square and waving the Bible around at St. John's Church is really unbelievable.\n\nAnd it feels like you're not in America at that point.\n\nAnd if you saw this, a clip of this on television from some other country, you'd think, oh, that's one of those unstable democracies.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Most Republican leaders again would not challenge Trump's actions.\n\n>> Senator McConnell, was what the president did last night the right thing to do?\n\nWas clearing the protesters an abuse of power?\n\n>> ...walked across the street to the church.\n\nWas that the right thing to do?\n\n>> ...about what happened at the White House last night?\n\n>> Was it an abuse of power, what we saw last night outside the White House?\n\n>> By that point, they had learned a lot from him.\n\nYou know, Republicans in Congress understood that if you were able to point the finger at somebody else, you never really had to apologize for anything.\n\nYou could always be on offense.\n\n>> NARRATOR: With their support, Trump turned a moment about race in America into an opportunity to project his power.\n\n>> I have strongly recommended to every governor to deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers that we dominate the streets.\n\n>> Republicans weren't going to push back because they understood this is who Donald Trump was.\n\nHe was enjoying that.\n\nHe loved this.\n\n>> Antifa, the radical left, run down your streets, riot in your streets, burn down your stores, beat you... >> This kind of talk about Antifa in the streets and Black Lives Matters in the streets as being this existential threat to democracy...\n\nThis is a strategy, of course, that authoritarian-minded leaders have used throughout history, the kind of threat of disorder, the threat of chaos, to try to pull reasonable voters back to your side.\n\n(clock ticking) >> Frankly, we did win this election.\n\n(crowd cheers and applauds) >> The Fox News decision desk can now project that former Vice President Joe Biden will win Pennsylvania and Nevada.\n\n>> He is President-elect Joseph Robinette Biden... >> ...become the 46th president of the United States.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The greatest threat to American democracy began to take shape in the hours and days after the election.\n\n>> The West Wing was a ghost town.\n\nNo one was even coming in.\n\nAnd the president didn't come down from the residence for several days after it was called for Biden.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Alyssa Farah Griffin had been the communications director for Mark Meadows and the Freedom Caucus, press secretary for Vice President Mike Pence, and was the Trump White House communications director.\n\n>> I passed into the Oval Office just to kind of see how he was doing.\n\nHe seemed just kind of resigned to it.\n\nThere was one moment where he was watching Joe Biden on TV and says, \"Can you believe I lost to this blank guy?\"\n\nSo there was an acknowledgment.\n\nBut then it went completely a different direction.\n\n>> NARRATOR: He had questioned elections before, with the Emmys and the Iowa caucuses.\n\nAnd an old friend told him he'd help him do it again.\n\n>> Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor, his personal lawyer.\n\nTrump gives the keys, essentially, to Rudy Giuliani, not his campaign lawyers.\n\nHe says to Rudy, \"Do what you need to do to help me stay here.\"\n\n>> If we don't, if we don't fix this, Sean, we'll never have a free and fair election, at least for the next 30 or 40 years.\n\nThere is strong evidence that this was an election that, in at least three or four states and possibly ten, it was stolen.\n\nThe reality is, dead people voted, over 300,000 ballots were counted in secret... >> NARRATOR: It was a pivotal moment.\n\nSenate Leader Mitch McConnell had said privately that Trump had lost.\n\nJosh Holmes was one of his key advisers.\n\n>> The view, at this point, initially, is, look, this looks like it's probably over, from our perspective.\n\nThe margins are large enough where it's not triggering automatic recounts in some of these places.\n\nIt just, it felt off.\n\nIt felt like it wasn't going to be able to get to the, you know, a victorious outcome for President Trump.\n\n>> NARRATOR: But McConnell wouldn't say it publicly.\n\n>> He knows Trump has lost.\n\nBut he does not want to anger Trump.\n\n>> All right, folks, let's wrap it up, thank you very much.\n\n>> All right, guys, let's go.\n\n>> But McConnell chooses silence.\n\n>> All right, guys, come on, let's go.\n\n>> He does not acknowledge Biden's victory because he's trying to keep Trump happy.\n\nHe's trying to placate Trump.\n\n>> I heard from a specific senator who said, \"Mitch has told us to stay quiet against the president in this period.\"\n\nAnd I think that led to a lot of what otherwise would be kind of influential senators at least countering the voice of Donald Trump, being silent.\n\nAnd silence is complicity.\n\n>> He had seen enough, over the last five years, of what kind of a person Trump is, to know that this was a, this was a dangerous indulgence.\n\nHe should have been looking for an opportunity to, to defang Trump while he had the chance.\n\n>> That decision keeps Mitch McConnell out of the crosshairs of Trump and Trump's people.\n\nBut more perniciously, that gives a lead time for the most fantastic and outrageous conspiratorial ideas to really just start circulating.\n\n>> \"Most fraudulent election in history!\"\n\n>> All we get back is, \"Shut up.\n\nYou're a conspiracy theorist, you're attacking the integrity of our democracy.\"\n\n>> You think we're idiots?\n\nWe're not backing off this one inch.\n\nHe won!\n\n>> It will be impossible to ever know the true, fair, accurate election results.\n\nThat's a fact.\n\n>> \"Fake voters and fraud that miraculously floated in from everywhere!\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: Right-wing media was amplifying the lies.\n\n>> They're going to try to steal North Carolina next.\n\nWe believe these people are thieves.\n\n>> You have 138,000 votes that magically appear that are all 100% Biden votes.\n\n>> I have a lot of family who are die-hard Trump supporters.\n\nIt was frustrating to me to talk to my family, who would be, like, \"Well, listen, no, I think it was stolen.\n\nHe's going to have another four years.\"\n\nAnd I'd be, like, \"Guys, that's not true.\n\nIt was not stolen.\n\nHe is not going to have another four years.\"\n\nBut then you flip on the news, and some other senior White House official is lying to the public.\n\n>> We have what appears in some sense to be an immaculate deception.\n\n>> \"There is tremendous evidence of widespread voter fraud.\"\n\n>> ...Detroit, about ballots brought in there, new ballots in the middle of the night.\n\n>> He miraculously found enough ballots to call the state for Biden.\n\n>> Votes being subtracted from President Trump and appearing on the Biden side of the scale.\n\n>> What was incredibly shocking to me was the number of Republicans and lawmakers who, quote-unquote, should know better... >> They are setting the stage to potentially steal an election... >> ...who were encouraging the president, who were standing by him.\n\n>> Trump has not lost.\n\nDo not concede, Mr. President.\n\nFight hard.\n\n>> \"20,000 dead people on the Pennsylvania voters roll.\"\n\n>> You got more than 10,000 dead people confirmed in Michigan to have voted.\n\n>> Georgia, we've been told 10,000 dead people voted.\n\n>> You might see one of these prominent Republicans come on the air and deliver a fire-and-brimstone speech.\n\n>> President Trump won this election, so everyone who's listening, do not be quiet, do not be, do not be silent about this.\n\n>> And you might ask yourself, do they really believe this?\n\nAnd the answer in almost every single case is no.\n\nThey don't believe it.\n\n>> I never once talked to anybody that believed any of this garbage.\n\n99.9%, almost, of congressmen and women in the Republican Party know that the election wasn't stolen.\n\nThey're just too cowardly to say it, and, frankly, in a republic, that's frightening.\n\n(sirens wailing) >> The Republican Party enabled Donald Trump as he riled up his base and, and as he convinced his base that, that the election had been stolen.\n\nAnd there, for the first time, the Republican Party becomes unambiguously anti-democratic, right?\n\nThey were breaking norms, they were tolerating authoritarian behavior.\n\nBut the Republicans were not an authoritarian party until November 2020, when they, as a collective, refused to accept defeat in an election.\n\nThat was incredibly decisive.\n\n♪ ♪ >> This is a contested election.\n\nMany people are nervous, the president showing no signs that he's prepared to concede this election.\n\n>> NARRATOR: As the lie spread, so did the political unrest.\n\n>> They're trying to put us under permanent martial law.\n\nYou gotta rise up now!\n\n>> Now!\n\nNow!\n\nNow!\n\nGet out on the streets.\n\nProtest.\n\nShow them who you are and that they can't get away with it.\n\n>> I don't even care if Trump concedes.\n\nI'm not conceding crap.\n\nThis means revolution.\n\nThis means war.\n\n>> We have men already stationed outside D.C. as a nuclear option in case they attempt to remove the president illegally.\n\n>> America is awakening!\n\n>> Everything had led to a moment wherein Trump's people were completely unmotivated to accept anything other than unqualified victory as valid.\n\n>> President Trump flew over the crowd on his way... >> Tens of thousands of Trump supporters marching on... >> NARRATOR: Over those weeks, Trump's extremist followers were preparing for a showdown.\n\n>> We are the Proud Boys!\n\n>> Supporters of the \"Stop the Steal\" movement... >> (chanting): (bleep) Antifa!\n\n>> (bleep) Antifa!\n\n(crowd shouting) >> ...saying the election was being stolen from the president.\n\n>> ...when everyday American citizens get together and fight tyranny.\n\n>> By the time it becomes clear that Joe Biden has won the election, it would have been surprising had you not seen violence.\n\n>> (bleep) (crowd shouting, sirens wailing) (crowd shouting) >> And if, in fact, the people who were claiming power represent an existential threat to the nation, then why wouldn't you commit acts of violence to defend the country?\n\n>> (chanting): Stop the steal!\n\n>> A very real cost and risk of the president's lies about the election... >> Election workers have received threats of death... >> Threatening violence against these officials who have been honestly running the election.\n\n>> It has all gone too far.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The warning from one Republican in Georgia was unambiguous.\n\n>> What you don't have the ability to do, and you need to step up and say this, is, stop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence.\n\nSomeone's going to get hurt.\n\nSomeone's going to get shot.\n\nSomeone's going to get killed.\n\nAnd it's not right.\n\n>> All that frustration and all that energy had to be channeled somewhere.\n\nAnd it's not surprising that it ended up being focused on, you know, the people who were actually doing the jobs on the frontlines of seeing through Americans' elections every year.\n\n>> Mr. President, you have not condemned these actions or this language.\n\nSenators, you have not condemned this language or these actions.\n\nThis has to stop.\n\n>> If you believe that the person who's supposed to be overseeing your election process in your county or your state is inherently corrupt, or not actually a member of the political party that you adhere to, you're not going to trust that system.\n\nAnd that system has now been inherently undermined, which is going to impact not just Democrats, but Republicans, too.\n\n(siren wailing) >> NARRATOR: At the White House, chaos.\n\n>> Over a dozen Trump campaign lawsuits have been dismissed... >> Yet another loss, as an attempt... >> NARRATOR: They were losing lawsuits, dozens of them.\n\n>> Turmoil over the next steps at the White House... >> The beginnings of an exodus of staff that is bubbling behind... >> NARRATOR: Senior officials were leaving.\n\n>> Attorney General William Barr is leaving the Trump administration early.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Alyssa Farah Griffin was one of them.\n\n>> I resigned when I started hearing internally much less about, you know, he's going to come around and accept it, and started seeing very fringe figures walking into the, the West Wing.\n\nAt that point, I knew I didn't have really any sway over him.\n\nI wasn't going to be able to impact outcomes.\n\nSo I thought that was my time to leave.\n\n>> NARRATOR: One who stayed: Farah Griffin's one-time mentor, Mark Meadows, Trump's chief of staff.\n\n>> Mark Meadows was very actively conducting a misinformation campaign.\n\nHe was enabling some of the wild conspiracy theorists to have Donald Trump's ear, and he was texting with them, and he was helping to promote the election lies.\n\n>> It's hard for me to understand how myself, as a, a 32-year-old woman, could have more political courage than these, you know, men who've had these long careers in Washington.\n\nI've unfortunately seen a lot of grown men put their political ambitions ahead of their integrity in recent years.\n\nI'm still just stunned by people who weren't, even in that moment, willing to do the right thing.\n\n(clock ticking) >> NARRATOR: It was six weeks after the election when Mitch McConnell finally publicly conceded the reality.\n\n>> McConnell waited until there was, there could be absolutely no doubt about the election results to come out to congratulate Joe Biden.\n\nIt was on December 15.\n\nThat is the day after each state has certified its electoral votes.\n\n>> The Electoral College has spoken.\n\nSo today, I want to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden.\n\n>> He knew that his relationship with President Trump would forever change at that moment.\n\nHe knew that Trump had increasingly been trying to rein in any Republicans that observed reality at this point.\n\nAnd the significance of McConnell saying it's over means it's over.\n\n(phone ringing) (receiver picks up) >> McConnell and Trump speak by phone.\n\nThe president is furious.\n\nHe lashes into McConnell, \"What the heck do you think you're doing?\"\n\nExpletives fly.\n\nHe says to McConnell, \"You've never been loyal.\n\nYou've never been someone I could trust.\n\nYou've never really been in my corner.\"\n\nMcConnell says almost nothing.\n\nHe's done with Trump.\n\nHe says one sentence to Trump.\n\n\"The election is over-- you have lost.\"\n\nAnd then the call ends.\n\n(receiver hangs up) It's the last time the two speak.\n\n(clock ticking) >> NARRATOR: Increasingly angry and desperate, Trump saw one last chance.\n\n>> The last opportunity the president saw to be able to get his way and overturn the election, overturn the will of the people, was the vote in Congress on January 6, where the House and the Senate were coming together to do their constitutional duty and certify the vote of the Electoral College.\n\n>> He has a meeting on December 21 with a whole bunch of his most fervent supporters in the White House, people like Louie Gohmert and Matt Gaetz, and Marjorie Taylor Green, who hasn't even yet taken office, but has just been elected.\n\n>> Just finished with our meetings here at the White House this afternoon.\n\nWe had a great planning session for our January 6 objection.\n\n>> It is really, truly an effort to overturn a presidential election.\n\nThis has gone way beyond, you know, \"We're going to go out there and make noise and tell people we won, and we're going to try and challenge results in the courts, and we want recounts in elections that are close.\"\n\nThis is an effort to overturn an election that has already been certified by all 50 states.\n\n>> We aren't going to let this election be stolen by Joe Biden and the Democrats.\n\n>> Now it's, \"Can we use the blunt force of Republicans in Congress to turn over the election?\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: Trump's plot to overturn the election required the help of Republicans in Congress.\n\nHe turned to longtime ally Kevin McCarthy, the top House Republican.\n\nTrump called him \"My Kevin.\"\n\n>> The White House viewed Kevin McCarthy much as it had viewed him for the previous four years, which is as a totally willing accomplice and enabler of Donald Trump.\n\nAt no point in the run-up to January 6 did Kevin McCarthy say, \"Enough is enough, folks.\n\nThe time to question and challenge the election is over.\"\n\n(siren wailing) >> NARRATOR: Trump needed McCarthy to get House Republicans to agree to the plan.\n\nBut McCarthy's deputy, Liz Cheney, wouldn't go along.\n\n>> Liz Cheney, being a Cheney, was a lifelong Republican, was a steward of this party, and was not going to let it move in this other, crazier direction without a fight.\n\nShe wasn't simply going to become part of the surrender caucus.\n\n>> Cheney recognizes how dangerous this moment is.\n\nThis is really how societies find themselves enmeshed in protracted bloodshed.\n\nThis is how democracies fail.\n\nAnd I'm not sure that other Republicans made that calculation.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Just days before January 6, House Republicans debated whether to support Trump's plan to not certify the election results.\n\n>> There's a conference call with the full House Republican conference, all the Republican House members.\n\nAnd they're debating this, and Liz Cheney is making an impassioned argument.\n\n\"Don't sign on.\n\nThe election's over.\n\nBiden has won.\n\nThis is unconstitutional, this effort.\n\nDon't do it.\"\n\n>> Liz had given a really compelling narrative about why we have to certify the election.\n\nKevin came on and said, \"Liz only speaks for herself, not the conference.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: McCarthy and the majority of House Republicans would stick with Trump.\n\n>> Totally reckless.\n\nIt was totally reckless.\n\nThere are sort of certain moments in the life of a democracy where it's most vulnerable, and those are moments of succession, when there's an election, when there's a change of power.\n\nAnd to, to play recklessly with this is going to get a democracy into trouble.\n\nAnd none of these guys clearly knew this, or if they did, they seemed not to care.\n\nBecause by doing this, they were laying the seeds for a, for a crisis, which is what happened.\n\n(clock ticking) (crickets chirping, siren wailing) >> NARRATOR: The centerpiece of Trump's plan relied on his loyal vice president, Mike Pence.\n\n>> There were some people who were telling the president that Mike Pence could just object to electors, that he could declare Trump the winner of the election, and all would be good.\n\n>> Mike Pence owed his office to Donald Trump.\n\nAnd here was Donald Trump basically calling in that favor, cashing in those chips, and saying, \"You have the power.\n\nOverturn the election results and do as I tell you to do.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: Pence was reluctant.\n\nAs Trump headed out to a televised rally, he decided to pressure Pence publicly.\n\n>> Well, I see the president is taking to the stage, let's, let's check in.\n\n>> And I hope Mike Pence comes through for us, I have to tell you.\n\nI hope that our great vice president comes through for us.\n\nHe's a great guy.\n\n>> Pence and his advisers are watching Trump and they grow increasingly nervous.\n\n>> Of course, if he doesn't come through, I won't like him quite as much.\n\n(crowd laughs) >> Trump makes it clear through the television screen to Pence in Washington, \"You better follow the plan.\n\nYou better listen to what I'm saying.\"\n\n>> Nah, Mike is a great guy.\n\nHe's a, he's a... >> For Pence, this is the moment of truth.\n\n>> A man that I like a lot... >> For three years and 11 months, he has done whatever he had to do stay on Trump's good side.\n\nAnd now he has reached a moment of truth.\n\nThere's no way to finesse this.\n\nYes or no.\n\nWhite or black.\n\nPick a side.\n\nWhat are you going to do?\n\n>> Pence had a clear conflict between what Trump wanted him to do and what the Constitution and the rule of law required him to do.\n\nI think he managed to navigate those conflicts in various ways over four years.\n\nNot always, in my view, in the right way.\n\nBut he had turned a blind eye to an awful lot of things.\n\nBut this was such a blatant, you know, transgression.\n\n>> NARRATOR: With time running out, Pence looked for a definitive legal opinion to get him off the hook.\n\nHis staff knew just the judge.\n\nA retired top conservative judge, J. Michael Luttig, was once on the short list of Republican Supreme Court justices.\n\nPence's lawyer called Luttig in the early morning hours, told him it was an emergency, and they needed a constitutional opinion immediately.\n\n>> There I was, on the morning of January 5, and, and I had to do this.\n\nSo I did the best I could.\n\nAnd what that meant was, I copied and pasted from my iPhone an email that included the, the text of the tweet.\n\n\"The Constitution does not empower the vice president to alter in any way the votes that have been cast.\n\nNeither the president nor the vice president has any higher loyalty than to the Constitution of the United States.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: Luttig's opinion gave Pence solid ground to defy Trump.\n\n>> I said that he has no such authority at all and that he must accept, and the Congress must count, the Electoral College votes as they have been cast.\n\n>> NARRATOR: That night, on the eve of January 6, Pence met with the president.\n\n>> This was a moment for Mike Pence to either stand up or buckle under the pressure.\n\n>> Ultimately, Pence says to the president, \"I can't do it.\n\nI just can't do it.\"\n\nAnd Trump says, \"If you can't do it, I don't even want to be your friend anymore.\"\n\n>> You could not overstate what was at risk had the vice president gone along with the plan.\n\nIt would have thrown the country into a constitutional crisis of a kind that the Constitution doesn't contemplate.\n\nThere is no way that we would've had a president on Inauguration Day.\n\n(clock ticking) (clock chimes) >> (chanting): Fight for Trump!\n\n>> The entire event was designed to intimidate Congress from doing its constitutional responsibility.\n\nTrump wanted, in whatever way he could, to empower people to disrupt that process.\n\nIf that resulted in violence, he obviously was prepared to let that happen.\n\n>> This election was stolen from you, from me, and from the country.\n\nYou'll never take back our country with weakness.\n\nYou have to show strength and you have to be strong.\n\n>> This was mob rule.\n\nThis was mob rule in a nutshell.\n\nDonald Trump's last best hope, he thought, was to stir up this mob of his own supporters outside the White House, send them down to the Capitol.\n\n>> Now it is up to Congress to confront this egregious assault on our democracy, and after this, we're going to walk down-- and I'll be there with you-- we're going to walk down to the Capitol and we're going to try and give our Republicans the kind of boldness that they need to take back our country.\n\n(crowd shouting) >> Looking back now, of course, you see the drumbeat.\n\n>> (chanting): Fight for Trump!\n\n>> You see there were a number of steps and a series of decisions.\n\n>> And we fight, we fight like hell, and if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.\n\n>> (chanting): Fight for Trump!\n\n>> A series of things that leaders were willing to look the other way on, or to enable or to enforce.\n\n>> I rise to object to the counting of the electoral ballots from Arizona.\n\n>> Is the objection signed by a senator?\n\n>> Yes, it is.\n\n(applauding) >> The ultimate culmination of all of that absolutely led to that day.\n\n(crowd shouting) >> They're coming down to a door here, underneath.\n\n>> The entire Republican Party is culpable for what happens on January 6.\n\nWhen it was already clear that Donald Trump was willing to condone violence, when it was already clear that he was not willing to accept defeat, Republicans, with a couple of, of very honorable exceptions, \"humored\" him.\n\nThey remained silent.\n\nThey enabled him.\n\n>> Hold the line!\n\n>> (chanting): Fight for Trump!\n\n>> Mike Pence, I hope you're going to stand up for the good of our country.\n\nAnd if you're not, I'm going to be very disappointed in you.\n\n>> When the people came for the people's house... >> If Pence caved, we're going to drag mother(bleep) through the streets.\n\n>> ...and the attackers scaled the walls... >> We just heard that Mike Pence has betrayed the United States of America.\n\n(crowd booing) >> (chanting): Hang Mike Pence!\n\n>> ...and the mob started beating the policemen, what did all these people do inside of Congress?\n\nAll these people who had fomented this, all these people who had enabled the lies, all these people who had invited this violence, what did they do?\n\nThey ran.\n\n>> (chanting): Hang Mike Pence!\n\n>> They went looking for cover.\n\n>> Stand down, mother(bleep).\n\n>> Break it down!\n\n>> He's got a gun!\n\n(gun fires) (crowd shouting) >> We gotta get E.M.S.\n\nhere!\n\n>> I think about the fact that Ashli Babbitt, who lost her life that day, was a veteran.\n\nShe served our country in the Air Force.\n\nBut she believed people that she thought she was supposed to trust, who she thought were supposed to tell her the truth, telling her that this country you fought for is now being stolen because somebody stole an election and your vote doesn't count.\n\nI mean, that, that's horrible.\n\nShe would still be alive today if people did not lie to her and inspire her to be there at the Capitol.\n\n>> I want to quickly bring in Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader.\n\nDo you condemn this violence?\n\n>> I want to be very clear, I condemn any of this activity.\n\nThis is not anything I support.\n\nThis is not anything that I would be a part of.\n\nThis is not who we are!\n\n>> Kevin McCarthy was desperately trying to get Donald Trump on the phone.\n\nWhile he was on the phone with him, Ashli Babbitt was shot.\n\nHe heard the gunshot.\n\nHe was furious.\n\nHe had a screaming, expletive-filled, yelling phone call with Donald Trump.\n\n>> Kevin McCarthy says, \"You've got to speak out.\"\n\nAnd Trump says, \"Well, Kevin, I guess these people are just more concerned about the election than you are.\"\n\nIn other words, he is siding with the mob over his own Republican ally.\n\n>> McCarthy gets angry with Trump and says, \"Who are you to say that?\n\nI've been fighting for you.\"\n\nAnd he had been, right?\n\nI mean, McCarthy hadn't crossed Trump at all.\n\nIt's one of the most tense conversations that the two men ever had.\n\n>> Whose house?\n\n>> Our house!\n\n>> Whose house?\n\n>> Our house!\n\n>> Whose house?\n\n>> The lesson in all of this is, if you accommodate a demagogue, someone who is telling untruths and leading hard-working Americans to a place, if you accommodate that, it can grow into something way beyond what you ever, ever fathomed.\n\nI don't think people expected that people would actually, you know, break into the Capitol, that five people would die.\n\nBut I think it does demonstrate the fragility of a democracy and how what you say matters.\n\n(clock ticking) >> Tensions are still high following the chaos at the Capitol.\n\n>> Our nation's capital under a state of emergency, under a citywide lockdown... >> The National Guard has been called in to the Capitol.\n\nThe Capitol is secure now.\n\n>> NARRATOR: In the aftermath of the attack, shock, and a brief sense that things might change.\n\n>> Republicans, by and large, were entirely horrified by Donald Trump's behavior on January 6.\n\nThe thing that really solidified it for a lot of the people who had been the president's supporters was the fact that he did nothing to stop the riot while it was undergoing.\n\nThe fact that he didn't come out until way too late to tell people to go home.\n\nThe fact that he didn't condemn the attack on the Capitol.\n\nAnd there was a real sense that he was done.\n\n>> For about 48 hours, it really seemed that this was the final straw and that the dam had broken.\n\nPeople were finally going to do the right thing.\n\nIt was, for me, a moment where I had some hope that, that things were going to, the ship was going to right itself.\n\nVery late, but still better late than never.\n\n(siren wailing) >> NARRATOR: One by one, Republican leaders rebuked the president.\n\nMitch McConnell.\n\n>> The mob was fed lies.\n\nThey were provoked by the president... >> McConnell loathes Trump, and now he believes Trump, once and for all, is going to be gone.\n\nAnd he can wash his hands of Donald Trump at this point.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Kevin McCarthy: >> He has a phone call with a small group of Republican congressional leaders.\n\n>> What you hear on that call is that Kevin McCarthy totally understands the difference between right and wrong in that moment.\n\nAnd he knows that Donald Trump has done something deeply, deeply wrong.\n\n>> NARRATOR: And Trump confidant Lindsey Graham.\n\n>> Trump and I, we've had a hell of a journey.\n\nI hate it to end this way.\n\nOh, my God, I hate it.\n\nAll I can say is count me out.\n\nEnough is enough.\n\n>> You heard Lindsey Graham say, \"Enough is enough, I'm out.\"\n\nThis was someone who had stood steadfastly by Donald Trump, who said once and for all this is a bridge too far.\n\n♪ ♪ >> Senator Graham feels the heat immediately after that speech.\n\n>> You traitor!\n\nYou traitor!\n\nYou son of a bitch!\n\n>> It's visceral.\n\nThere is an almost violent edge to the way Graham is criticized.\n\n>> You won't be able to walk down the street anymore.\n\n>> This is the rest of your life, Lindsey.\n\n>> Bye, traitor!\n\n>> They see Graham as a traitor, traitorous.\n\nThis is the kind of way Graham is cast immediately.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Anger, vitriol, and threats directed at any Republican seen as disloyal, like messages to Alyssa Farah Griffin.\n\n>> \"You are a (bleep) traitor.\"\n\n\"You need to be raped.\"\n\n\"We know where you live, bitch.\"\n\n>> After I spoke out, on January 7, I started receiving death threats on a variety of social media channels.\n\nIt's the first time in my life that I had, and I never had expected to.\n\n>> \"You deserve to be killed.\"\n\n\"(bleep) piece of (bleep).\"\n\n\"I know where you live.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: And there were voice messages on election officials' phones.\n\n>> (bleep) election-stealing bitch.\n\n>> You rigged my (bleep) election, you (bleep) piece of (bleep).\n\n>> Lying, corrupt pieces of (bleep).\n\nYour day is coming.\n\n>> Whereas, in 2016, it required political courage to stand up to Trump and to this kind of nationalist, authoritarian cult... >> They're going to hang you for treason, you (bleep) bitch.\n\nWhat are you going to do then?\n\n>> ...by 2020, it required physical courage, because things had gone to such a point where people did fear for their own safety and for that of their families.\n\n>> (cackling) See you in hell, you (bleep).\n\n(call ends, siren wailing) >> NARRATOR: And even in the Capitol building... >> Do swear or affirm that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic, so help me God.\n\n>> So help me God.\n\n>> NARRATOR: ...the specter of violence remained as Congress decided whether to impeach the president for his role in the January 6 attack.\n\n>> We know that the president incited this insurrection.\n\nHe must go.\n\nHe is a clear and present danger to the nation that we all love.\n\n>> The second impeachment was somewhat like the first impeachment, but on steroids.\n\nThe revulsion over what happened on January 6 and Trump's role in that struck people as so beyond the pale that, again, something had to be done to hold him accountable.\n\n>> On this vote, the ayes... >> NARRATOR: But at the vote... >> The nays are 197.\n\n>> NARRATOR: ...Kevin McCarthy was among 197 House Republicans still not willing to take action against Trump.\n\n>> A lot of them didn't do it because, quite frankly, they were afraid of their own physical well-being.\n\nI mean, they were getting death threats.\n\nTheir family was being threatened.\n\nI mean, to me, this is the essence of, of authoritarianism.\n\nIt's actually being intimidated into voting a certain way, not by any debate, not by any political calculation, but by the threat of physical intimidation.\n\n>> You know, I had a member of Congress say to me, \"These people were willing to come after us inside the United States Capitol building.\n\nWhat are they going to do to me when I'm at home with my wife and kids?\"\n\nIf January 6 was political terrorism, I think you have to say that it worked.\n\n(clock ticking) >> I, Joseph Robinette Biden, Jr., do solemnly swear... >> NARRATOR: Refusing to attend Biden's inauguration, Trump left Washington.\n\n>> So help me God.\n\n>> Congratulations, Mr. President.\n\n(crowd cheers) >> NARRATOR: The question: would his hold on the party remain?\n\n>> There is this uncertainty.\n\nEverything's up in the air in the Republican Party.\n\nWhat is President Trump's role going to be?\n\nHas he now been discredited?\n\nOr does he retain his grip on the party?\n\n>> NARRATOR: On his last flight on Air Force One, he made a final threat to the party.\n\n(phone ringing out) He spoke to RNC chair Ronna McDaniel.\n\n(phone vibrating) >> I got this account from multiple sources, including a source that directly witnessed the phone call.\n\nTrump lays into her and says, \"You failed to fight for me.\n\nRepublicans abandoned me.\n\nThe election was stolen.\n\nYou did nothing about it.\n\nI'm leaving.\n\nI'm done.\n\nI'm leaving the Republican Party.\n\nI'm creating my own party.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: Amid the transition of power, Republican leaders made a critical choice.\n\n(crowd cheering and applauding) >> The Republican leadership is absolutely freaked out that if Trump leaves, the party will fragment.\n\nThere will be no hope for the Republican Party.\n\nRepublican leaders always had that in the back of their mind, that if Trump walks away, he will bring millions of voters with him, and you can kiss the idea of a Republican majority goodbye for a long, long time.\n\n>> NARRATOR: As Trump hunkered down at his Mar-a-Lago compound in Florida, it didn't take long before he was visited by a special guest.\n\nThey took a photograph.\n\n>> McCarthy says to Trump, \"I want your help for 2022.\n\nHelp me win back the majority.\"\n\nIt was an opportunity on the table, laid out for Donald Trump to repair himself.\n\n>> It was like a, when somebody's in cardiac arrest, and you take the paddles, and you bring him back to life.\n\nTrump's political career was in cardiac arrest.\n\nAnd Kevin McCarthy brought the paddles and resurrected him.\n\n>> Kevin McCarthy makes a political decision, which is betting on the fact that President Trump will continue to have a hold over the base and the party, that he's going to be one of the key fundraising leaders when it comes to future elections, and that there are midterms coming up.\n\nThat's a political decision and a calculation he makes in the moment.\n\n(jet roars, tires screech) >> NARRATOR: As if January 6 and all that came before hadn't happened, Republicans made the pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago.\n\nEven Lindsey Graham was back.\n\n>> We see Lindsey Graham trying to get back in Trump's good graces.\n\nAnd I think that that's symbolic of what's happened to the Republican Party writ large.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Mitch McConnell also wasn't done with Trump.\n\n>> There'll be a lot of talk this weekend about 2024.\n\nIf the president was the party's nominee, would you support him?\n\n>> The nominee of the party?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\n>> (chanting): Trump won!\n\n(clock ticking) >> If there is no real consequence, and there's no exile for a political figure who has orchestrated this kind of violence, and this person remains not only within the fold, but still effectively, culturally, the leader of the party... >> My fellow Americans, our movement is far from over.\n\nIn fact, our fight has only just begun.\n\n>> ...that only means that it's much more possible that we would have an election where a loser would be able, through political subversion and use of force, to actually gain power and become the president.\n\n>> NARRATOR: For Liz Cheney, who had voted for impeachment, January 6 was a turning point.\n\n>> She crossed the Rubicon.\n\nShe experienced January 6 to a point where it was so traumatic, she can't come back from it.\n\nShe made the decision that, \"I'm going to fight this battle.\n\nIf it costs me my job, so be it.\n\nThe verdict of history is worth it to me.\n\nThis is what I'm willing to do.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: Kevin McCarthy and his allies voted Cheney out of the leadership.\n\n>> Do you feel betrayed?\n\n>> Congresswoman, do you feel betrayed by today's vote?\n\n>> I think that it is an indication of where the Republican Party is, and I think that the party is in a place that we've gotta bring it back from.\n\nWe cannot be dragged backward by the very dangerous lies of a former president.\n\nThank you.\n\n>> Thank you very much.\n\n>> NARRATOR: In her primary, McCarthy and other Republicans endorsed Cheney's opponent and ultimately helped to defeat her.\n\n>> The Republican Party is in a very grave place.\n\nThe Republican Party is the party of Trump.\n\nAnd what comes with that is that you are the party of the Big Lie, you are the party of undermining American democracy.\n\nIt's the party that's swiftly pivoted back to this man, and it's going to, it's going to end up hurting them in the long run.\n\n(clock ticking) >> One more time, here we go.\n\n>> NARRATOR: January 6 has continued to overshadow Washington, and American politics.\n\n>> With the House January 6 Committee set to hold its first hearing tonight in primetime, a TV spectacular.\n\nDemocrats say the future of democracy is on the line.\n\n>> A critical moment for our democracy after... >> NARRATOR: Democrats convened primetime hearings detailing the assault on American democracy.\n\n>> The committee is hoping to make sure the country never forgets that day, and that the people responsible are held accountable.\n\n(gavel bangs) >> What I saw was just a war scene.\n\n>> An armed revolution.\n\nI mean, people died that day.\n\n>> We were watching the Capitol building get defaced over a lie.\n\n>> But I had to be faithful to the Constitution.\n\nThat's what I swore an oath to do.\n\n>> Which is antithetical to everything in our democracy.\n\n>> Today, we'll focus on a few officials who stood firm against...\n\nI don't know if we're going to convince anybody to change their mind.\n\nMy hope is that we can just give a historical record to the American people.\n\nAnd so that's what's important to me, is the legacy we're leaving for the truth.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Adam Kinzinger... >> Some of these same Republican members requested pardons... >> NARRATOR: ...and Liz Cheney... >> You refused to defend our nation and our Constitution.\n\n>> NARRATOR: ...were the only two Republicans serving on the committee.\n\n>> There were only two of them and 200-plus other Republicans who were willing to, you know, whether for reasons of cowardice, calculation, you know, lack of conscience, were willing to just sort of go along because they didn't need the hassle of, of defying Donald Trump.\n\nAnd that just shows how unique a figure Liz Cheney has become in a time like this.\n\n>> Tonight, I say this to my Republican colleagues who are defending the indefensible-- there will come a day when Donald Trump is gone, but your dishonor will remain.\n\n>> Ready six, take... >> A full-on Hollywood, multimedia extravaganza... >> The effect was North Korean.\n\nEvery channel the same.\n\nNothing like it has ever happened in this country.\n\n>> And the blowhard of the evening award goes to Liz Cheney.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Republicans attacked the committee despite the fact it exposed powerful evidence.\n\n>>...was a prime-time dud.\n\nNothing came out of it that we didn't, we didn't know before.\n\nIt didn't change anybody's minds.\n\n>> The January 6 Committee will be seen through the same partisan lenses that so much of what we've seen over the last several years was seen.\n\n>> ...partisan committee has weaponized the investigatory powers.\n\n>> It is a partisan political committee.\n\n>> People on one side will take it as proof and hard evidence.\n\n>> They're using it to advance their political agenda.\n\n>> And people on the other side will say it's just part of a continuing witch hunt on the part of Democrats to hurt Donald Trump and to hurt the Republican Party.\n\n>> This is the only hour on an American news channel that will not be carrying their propaganda live.\n\nThey are lying and we are not going to help them do it.\n\nWhat we will do instead is to try to tell you the truth.\n\n>> All right, thanks, everybody.\n\nAnd stop the records.\n\n(siren wailing) >> NARRATOR: Most Republican voters now believe the lie that the 2020 election was stolen.\n\n>> Voters' faith in our democratic system of elections is diminishing further by the day, practically.\n\nThe erosion of confidence in our elections is an existential crisis for the United States of America.\n\nThere's no other way to say it.\n\n>> NARRATOR: A lie that Trump and other Republicans continue to promote with midterms looming and another presidential election two years away.\n\n>> One of the things that we have typically thought about American democracy was that it was rooted in, you know, these ironclad precepts of the Constitution, and that there really isn't that much wiggle room, you know, if you wanted to damage the machinery in a particular way.\n\nThat's wildly untrue.\n\nA good deal of American democracy relies on simple good faith.\n\nThat the people who are operating the controls of the system will adhere to the norms.\n\nBut there aren't really checks for a lot of the most dangerous things that could happen in that system.\n\n(siren wailing) >> Go to pbs.org/frontline for extended interviews from the film, part of our Transparency Project.\n\n>> This is how democracies fail.\n\n>> And silence is complicity.\n\n>> You cannot overstate what was at risk.\n\n>> He had just beaten impeachment.\n\nHe thought he was bulletproof.\n\n>> The Republican Party is in a very
