Another time to donate is if you upgrade furniture and don’t know what to do with the old pieces.\n\nBelow are four steps to follow when scheduling a donation pickup:\n\n1. Research Your Charity\n\nThe above-listed charities and others not listed use your donation directly or indirectly to help individuals. That being said, most charities serve a particular group of people. Research each organization’s website to ensure its values align with your beliefs or if there’s one you’d prefer to reach out to.\n\n2. Confirm the Organization Accepts Your Donation Type\n\nMost importantly, confirm that the organization accepts your donation type. Many of these nonprofits’ websites list items that they do and do not accept, along with exceptions. If your chosen charity doesn’t accept or won’t pick up one of your items, research one of the other ones on our list.\n\n3. Schedule a Donation Pickup Time With the Charity\n\nMost charities make it easy to schedule a donation pickup. You can typically do so by filling out an online form, sending an email, or inquiring via phone. Once you have a move date, schedule your donation pickup. It’s best to plan ahead so you’re not in too much discomfort without an often-used furniture piece like a bed or couch.\n\nNote: Charity donations increase dramatically during the holiday season so there might be longer wait times for scheduled pickups.\n\n4. Coordinate Donation Pickup Time With Landlord and Neighbors\n\nAs a tenant, it’s best to make your landlord and close neighbors aware of your scheduled donation pickup. If you can’t be there during the exchange, ask a neighbor or friend to sub in for you. Also, let your landlord know so they don’t toss the item intended for donation or fine you for breaking lease rules.\n\nHow to Help Your Tenants Donate\n\nPart of being a great landlord means organizing fun and exciting events for your tenants. One option is to create a canned food drive or a donation pickup for your tenants. You can organize a community-wide donation pickup by contacting one of the above-listed organizations and working with them to do a large sitewide pickup.\n\nBelow are a few donation pickups or drives the entire complex or community can help with:\n\nCanned food drives\n\nClothing drive\n\nAnimal shelter needs\n\nToy drive\n\nBlood drive\n\nAnother option is to advertise these charities that pick up appliances and furniture via email, flyers, or your monthly newsletter. This way, tenants are fully aware of these services. You can organize this type of event annually during high turnover seasons, biannually, or quarterly.\n\nIf you’re having a difficult time deciding what to donate, check out this flowchart to help them quickly decide which item should be donated, kept, or trashed."
