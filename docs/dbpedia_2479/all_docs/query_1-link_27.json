        "text": "Don left this earthly setting September 10, 2023 to join the Lord and rejoin his beloved family in Heaven.\n\nDonald Edward Schlaudraff was born September 22, 1931 to Edward and Cecile Schlaudraff in Huntington, Indiana.\n\nHe received his early education in Indiana before joining the Air Force. The military experience included travel all over the world and the United States. He especially enjoyed being stationed in rural Alaska for the winter. During part of his duty he was stationed in Austin, Texas, where he met Arline, who would become his wife on August 25, 1956.\n\nDon and Arline returned to Indiana, where Don continued his education before joining ITT Federal. When the company closed and employees were to be sent to New Jersey, Don instead made the move back to Texas to please Arline.\n\nDon worked for Pan Geo Atlas Corporation until it was sold to Dresser Industries, and worked at Dresser until he retired.\n\nDon and Arline retired to the farm at Round Top, where the whole family loved to gather. It was always a special time for him to love, tease, and teach the grandchildren and great grandchildren. Retirement also meant time for his travels with Arline all over the US and Germany.\n\nDon was a man of many talents. He helped his dad build houses and so learned all the skills (plumbing, electrical, etc.) required to build a home from start to finish. He enjoyed woodworking and made beautiful custom pieces for his loved ones. He gave Arline a run for her money when the family played 42 or 88, and kept the farm and all its vehicles in strong shape. He especially loved the time he spent flying for fun as a private pilot.\n\nDon leaves behind his wife of 67 years, Arline and his three children: Paul (Chris), Donna (Lindsay), and Sandra. He also leaves behind 11 grandchildren - Joseph, Justin (Liz), Paul Christian (Devon), Kathryn (Bryant), Mark, Laura, Paul Donald, John, Megan, Katelyn (Ben), and Amanda - and 10 great grandchildren: Ari, Mason, Rayleigh, Case, Indiana, Brantley, Easton, Adelyn, Bennett, and Jacklyn. He will also be missed by his sister Janet, and numerous nieces, nephews, and friends.\n\nDon was predeceased by his parents, his sister Janice, his brother Robert, his grandson Matthew, and four brothers-in-law.\n\nFuneral services will be at Abiding Word Lutheran Church in Brenham on Friday at 10 am, with visitation preceding on Thursday at Fayette Memorial Funeral Home in La Grange and family present from 6-7. Burial will be at Richter Cemetery in Round Top.\n\nMemorials may be sent to Abiding Word Lutheran Church or Round Top-Warrenton Fire Department.\n\nArrangements have been entrusted to Fayette Memorial Funeral Home in La Grange, Texas.
