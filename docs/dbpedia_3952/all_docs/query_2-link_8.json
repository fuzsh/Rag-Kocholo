        "text": "Admission requirements include prerequisite courses and letters of recommendation.\n\nPrerequisite courses\n\nCandidates applying for admission to the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine Program at CSU must complete the following prerequisite courses:\n\nwith a grade of C- or above\n\nby July 15 before matriculation\n\nat an institution accredited by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA)\n\nA single course may only count toward one prerequisite. You must identify a unique course for each prerequisite requirement.\n\nOnline courses are accepted if they are taken for credit with a grade and show as completed on an official transcript. Courses taken at vocational and proprietary schools will not be accepted. AP courses must appear on an official transcript.\n\nBiochemistry, cell biology, genetics, and systems physiology must have been taken within the last ten years. All other prerequisite courses are recommended to have been taken within ten years. A recent demonstration of an ability to handle an upper-division biomedical science curriculum is strongly encouraged.\n\nAll prerequisite courses – including in-progress courses – must be included in the VMCAS application at submission. Courses must be matched to prerequisites in the VMCAS application. This includes completed, in-progress, and future courses you plan to take. If a course is not matched to a prerequisite in an application, it will be assumed you have not and do not intend to take the required prerequisite.\n\nCandidates may apply before completing all required courses and can be admitted under provisional admission. If provisionally admitted, final transcripts must be received by July 15 of the year you matriculate. Provisional admission may be granted for the following in-progress prerequisites: biochemistry, biology lab, cell biology, chemistry lab, genetics, physics, statistics, and systems physiology.\n\nOnce the VMCAS and CSA are closed, you cannot modify your application. Please do not send application materials or transcripts outside the application; only what is included in your application will be reviewed.\n\nList of prerequisite courses\n\nThe course description, content level, prerequisites, number of credits, and a grade of C- or above must meet these requirements. For examples of courses that meet each requirement, please see our list of sample course descriptions."
