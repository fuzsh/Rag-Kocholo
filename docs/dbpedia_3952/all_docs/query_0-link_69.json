Pat celebrated her 100th birthday last August surrounded by family. Upon graduation from Davis High School at age sixteen, Pat was recognized for perfect attendance, never absent or tardy during all her school years. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of WVA in 1943 then went directly to Washington, DC for a job in the war effort. She was hired by the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), precursor to the CIA, and sent to Calcutta (now Kolkata), India for the duration of the war. While in Calcutta she first met the love of her life and future husband, Captain William (Bill) B. Durant, USN. After WWII Pat’s spirit of adventure led her to employment with the American Red Cross to help repatriate Japanese internees from Shanghai, China back to Japan. While in Shanghai, Pat reconnected with Bill Durant. Her experiences in India, China and Japan were just the beginning of a life of travel and frequent moves. After returning to the U.S. Pat and Bill began their married life together in Schenectady, NY. For the next eighteen years they were a Navy family, mainly stationed in Arlington, VA between stints in Hawaii, California and Sasebo, Japan. Pat took up golf, bridge, painting, and flower arranging as well as working as a school bus driver while raising their four children. In 1965 they relocated to Hanover, NH where Pat worked summers for Dartmouth College organizing college conferences. Pat continued her Red Cross work as a volunteer at local bloodmobile drives. Always a lover of the outdoors, she enjoyed skiing, hiking, bird watching, and gardening while also honing her golf and bridge skills. She later took up duplicate bridge and would travel New England for tournaments. As grandchildren started arriving Pat and Bill began organizing biennial vacations to Cape Cod for the whole family. This tradition continued with only a few missed years until Pat was no longer able to travel. Many of the most treasured memories for the family came from these special times together. “Granny” was famous among the grandchildren for her fabulous family dinners, always delicious if not extravagant, and she made it all seem easy. Not only was she an excellent cook, she was a talented seamstress and prolific knitter. Pat’s beloved husband, Bill, died in 2000 after a long journey with dementia. She was predeceased by her two sisters, Betty Gooding and Patty Thompson.

They spent many summers with their sons renovating and updating the building, riding their horses through the surrounding fields, and later on, driving a Haflinger-drawn cart across the county’s back roads and in the Tubs Parade in Lenox.

Elizabeth “Liz” Hemenway (nee Elizabeth Gillmor Stidger) passed away peacefully of heart disease at age 94 on Sunday April 2, 2023 in Marietta GA with loving family comforting her. She lived with brio to the last hour. Liz was deeply curious and wholly engaged in life, giving of herself with unmatched generosity, tact, and grace. She was treasured for her knowledge, intelligence, counsel, and laughter.\n\nWith her husband Brewster Roe Hemenway of Buffalo NY, a diplomat with the US Foreign Service, she travelled and everywhere embraced the people and cultures she encountered, making lifelong friends while maintaining close family ties back home, no matter the distance. She generously supported the music, theater, and visual arts everywhere she lived, advocated for many causes and instilled a deep appreciation of creativity and service in her children and grandchildren. Most of all, she inspired friends and family to be their best selves and never failed to lift them when they faltered.\n\nLiz lived the Christian ethic throughout her life and later reflected “classical music became my religion.” Liz loved small gatherings with great food, wine, and conversation, especially about her beloved Buffalo Bills (she rarely missed a game) and the latest family, geopolitical, and cultural insights. She wielded her terrific sense of humor skillfully to bring friends and family together, break inevitable tensions, and express her boundless joy in life. Never lonely when she was alone, she also valued the quiet hours of her days.\n\nLiz was born March 11, 1929 in Orange NJ to Ivan Read Stidger, M.D. 1911, of Moundsville WV and Ethel Bogart Graham, a nurse, of Lee MA. “Lizzie” was the youngest of three siblings, with Anne Stidger Pickering ’45, also a nurse, and Bill G. Stidger ’50, a businessman. Liz loved singing and dancing, was a gifted pianist, and delighted in the NY Metropolitan Opera. As an adult she sang with The Pitch Pipers, a female barbershop a cappella group, and with the National Cathedral Choir in Washington DC.\n\nLiz graduated from Allegheny College in Meadville PA in 1951 with a BA in French and a minor in Secretarial Studies. She became a program planner with the US Department of State Fulbright Program in Georgetown, DC, where she met Brewster (“Brew”), then married him in 1956 to begin their journey with the Foreign Service starting with their first posting in Barcelona. The couple soon had their first child, Caroline (“Cari”) and Liz immersed herself fully in her career as Foreign Service Officer (FSO) spouse, with a lifelong delight in gathering people around common interests and in fostering mutual understanding through cultural exchange. Together with Brew, she hosted many dignitaries including three American presidents-to-be and even musician Louis Armstrong.\n\nThe next 20 years included posts in Quito, Ecuador (where her son Roe and daughter Janet were born); Montevideo, Uruguay; Bogota, Colombia; and Vienna, Austria; she always represented the best of her country and culture with grace and skill. At every post, Liz dedicated herself to helping the local community, taking keen note of local needs and becoming involved in establishing systemic solutions, always in partnership with local women. She worked to improve schools and hospitals, educate and support disadvantaged women, and promote the arts as a scaffolding for mental and spiritual well-being. Liz also took on leadership roles with US and international women’s organizations that were instrumental in successful diplomatic relations. And in the early 1970s, Liz joined the internal worldwide campaign of Foreign Service wives to change Foreign Service policy on spouse evaluation and unpaid work “I was happy to be on the front end of the endeavor with my angry letter!” The result was a new directive that abolished the policy and opened up opportunities for thousands of US women.\n\nThese experiences were punctuated by stateside posts in New York, Rhode Island, and around Washington DC. Home-leaves allowed Liz to reconnect with family in Buffalo, Gettysburg and Ontario, catch up with US culture, and, most important, visit her own kin at their rustic family cabin on a modest pond in the Berkshires. She spent weeks there every summer, truly at home, alone or with her family. She skinny dipped, walked the woods, read, told stories, enjoyed Tanglewood and art centers nearby, played Up-Jenkins, and taught everyone how to use the oil lamps, water pump, and wood stove. It was her sanctuary and touchstone.\n\nRetiring from the Foreign Service to Buffalo with Brewster in 1985, they continued to venture abroad with many of their lifelong friends and family, ever fostering new experiences. The couple fully embraced Buffalo’s rich cultural and social scene. Liz joined the Garrett Club for its lively lectures and contributed to its success as board member and bridge champion. She volunteered with Meals on Wheels and Canopy of Neighbors, became a docent at Wright’s Darwin Martin House, fundraised, and supported the Burchfield Penney Art Center, the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra, and more. She participated in both Trinity Episcopal Church and Westminster Presbyterian. Liz even created her own rabid Bills Mafia group and remained a member in good standing until her last breath. When Brew passed away in 2002, Liz continued to travel extensively, win at bridge and golf, ride ziplines and mopeds, spoil grandchildren, and retreat yearly to her Berkshire sanctuary. She never stopped finding ways to express her deep love for sister Anne and Anne’s husband Jim and for her dearest in-laws and “out-laws” (including Dodie, Georgia, Jackie, and Prudy). She even created a Covid-19 pod with her Buffalo Mafia friends, meeting every Tuesday at her place for cocktails and hors-d’oeuvres and securing a home for companionship and joy even in difficult times. In 2021, as living alone became more chore than pleasure, she moved into an independent living community in Marietta GA, just a few miles from her daughters. There, her charm, insight, warm personality and worldly experience won her still more new friends. Above all, Liz relished the frequent visits of all six children/spouses, and eight grandchildren and their spouses. Elizabeth Hemenway was alight with life and had a calendar filled with future events, anticipating the births of her first two great-granddaughters, due in April and August. Liz was known as a trusted and gentle soul who welcomed and drew out the best in people. Effortlessly sensitive to others, she was quick to mend rifts, offering and receiving sage counsel on a foundation of deep personal integrity.\n\nLiz was preceded in death by her parents, husband Brewster Roe Hemenway (1928-2002), sister Anne Stidger Pickering (1923-2005) and brother William “Bill” Graham Stidger (1925-1967). Survivors include her three children: Caroline Graham Hemenway of Marietta, GA and spouse Earl Martin Chamberlin, Jr., Brewster Roe Hemenway, Jr. and spouse Sharon Rudolph Hemenway of Painted Post NY, and Janet Hemenway Taylor and spouse Mike Taylor of Marietta GA; and eight grandchildren ( Austin, Matthew, Samantha, Daniel, Stephen, Christopher, Andrew, and Benjamin) and their partners (Natalie, Hannah, Emily, Maebdh). Liz passed away just days before her first great granddaughter (Carter Emilia Taylor) was born; as Liz’s granddaughter-in-law Hannah affirmed, Carter gained a guardian angel to watch over her.\n\nDr. Peter Michael Lewinsohn on December 18, 2022. Peter Michael Lewinsohn, award winning scientist, passed away Dec. 18, 2022 at the age of 92. He died surrounded by his family.\n\nPeter was born in Berlin, Germany, March 17, 1930 to parents Hugo and Mathilde Lewinsohn. As a result of the persecutions inflicted on German Jews, Peter’s family made the decision to immigrate to Shanghai, China in 1941, where the family spent the war years under difficult conditions.\n\nPeter left Shanghai in 1947 to attend Yeshiva College (New York, N.Y.), and remained grateful throughout his life for the support he received from National Association of Jewish Women and other Jewish philanthropic organizations. Two years later, he chose to attend college and received a scholarship to attend Allegheny College where he majored in psychology. He always worked several jobs to help pay for his education, and had many happy memories of working together with his brother Tom as waiter and busboy in resort hotels.\n\nPeter next attended Johns Hopkins University, receiving his PhD in Clinical Psychology in 1955. Following his graduate studies, he sought to gain clinical experience, and served on the staff of numerous hospitals and clinics. He also developed his facility with psychological and neuropsychological evaluation. Ultimately, he sought to pursue research in clinical psychology in a university setting, and accepted a position as Associate Professor in psychology at Southern Illinois University in 1963. In 1965 he began his long association with the University of Oregon, where he remained until his retirement in 1987. Peter was a dedicated teacher and researcher, and was well loved by the many graduate students who studied with him.\n\nDuring his tenure at the University of Oregon, he pioneered the research and development of a cognitive, non-pharmacologic, treatment of depressed individuals. Working with graduate students, he created the Coping with Depression Course which has been translated into many languages and used around the world. This approach is embodied in Behavioral Activation, a widely used and highly effective treatment of depression.\n\nPeter was a pioneer in applying the rigorous research approaches that he learned at Johns Hopkins University to clinical questions in psychology. He developed one the largest and most comprehensive studies that encompassed children, adolescents, and adults. From this study, he made key discoveries related to the etiology of depression across the lifespan.\n\nHis distinguished career included a number of awards; receiving the Psychologist Scientist award from the Lane County Psychologist Association, the Distinguished Scientist award from the Society for the Science of Clinical Psychology, the Professional Award from the Mental Health Association of Oregon, and the Gold Medal Award for Lifetime Achievement in the Application of Psychology by the American Psychological Association (APA).\n\nUpon retiring from the University of Oregon, he joined the Oregon Research Institute, where he continued to collaborate with colleagues in numerous research projects into his 70’s.\n\nPerhaps Peters’ greatest legacy has been the many graduate students and early career professionals who he inspired to pursue a research career in psychology.\n\nThroughout his life, Peter was devoted to his family. In 1959 he married Cynthia Stiefel and they had two sons, David born in 1960, and Mark born in 1963. The Lewinsohn family moved to Eugene in 1965. Peter had an adventurous soul. He developed a wide range of interests, often joining his family on such activities such hiking, fishing, canoeing, backpacking, and skiing. He also loved travel, and often tried to learn the language in advance of the trip. Peter’s curiosity was insatiable, and he could often be found with a stack of books on his newest interest.\n\nPeter is survived by his wife, Cynthia; his two sons; David and Mark; his five grandchildren; his brother, Tom; his daughters-in-law, Debbie and Kari; and brother-in-law, John; his sisters-in-law, Alice and Lesa.\n\nLoyal Dean Moore on October 12, 2022.

Nancy Ruth Miller Swanson, cherished wife, mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, and friend, passed away peacefully at her home in Barnes Tuesday. She was 91.\n\nExcept for a few years away at school, she resided in the village all her life, and Barnes was central to her existence. She loved to amble along its lanes and across its hilltops and she was a good and generous neighbor. At various points, she also was the secretary for the cemetery, the pianist at the Barnes United Methodist Church, the Sunday School superintendent, the host of the annual Barnes Picnic, and the church’s choir director. In 1979, after her six children were mostly grown, she co-founded The Valley Voice, the weekly newspaper for Barnes and Sheffield that was published out of the old library near her house for several years and then from Sheffield for another couple of decades. She wrote a column for the newspaper, “Out My Back Door,” in which she detailed her adventures as mother, grandmother, wife, and human being. She loved to write.\n\nShe loved her family more. David Swanson, to whom she was married for more than 60 years, died eight years ago. She was mother to David Nels Swanson ’77, Eric Swanson, Kirsten Turfitt, Karl Swanson ’83, Karen “Tia” Swanson and Elisa Gordon, who survive. She also is survived by her sons- and daughters-in law: Hallie Campbell Swanson, Susan Gerbron Swanson, Myron Turfitt, Mary Beth Devine Swanson, Christopher Mumma and Eric Gordon; 17 grandchildren and two great-granddaughters, the younger of whom arrived three days after her death.\n\nShe was born November 25, 1931, the only child of Ruth Titus Miller 1921 and Otto Lester “Nick” Miller. Her father died of complications from tuberculosis before she was 2 and her mother never remarried. She was raised in the Titus family home, surrounded by maiden aunts, her mother and grandmother. She was valedictorian of the Sheffield class of 1949 and received a degree in English from Allegheny College, the alma mater of her mother and aunts. She was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and the Allegheny Singers, a membership that cemented her lifelong love of music, particularly hymns and choral singing.\n\nMarried the week after graduation, she helped put her husband through law school by selling books door-to-door and by teaching second graders. An amateur artist, she was later an art teacher at the old Sheffield High School, even though there was no art room. Undeterred, she instructed six grades of art students on the finer points of perspective from makeshift tables in the girls’ locker room.\n\nAlthough she never learned to ride a bike or swim, one of her favorite places was Hatteras Island, North Carolina, where she and Dave would gather the children and grandchildren for an annual vacation and where she could read for hours in the sun without interruption. With Dave, she briefly took up downhill skiing in her 50s – though cross-country was more to her liking — hiked the Grand Canyon twice in her 60s and paddled through the Boundary Waters into her 70s.\n\nFor years she collected stocking presents for all her children and grandchildren. On the Christmases when members of the family would not be in Barnes, she sent the stocking presents out. They would arrive in a box a week before the big day, and there would always be seven presents for each family member, wrapped in their own papers so as not to cause confusion.\n\nWhen her first grandchild was born in 1990, she wrote a letter to her that was published as a column. It said, in part:\n\n“Look for the first snowflake in winter, listen for the first peeper or wild goose passing overhead in spring. When it is time for summer, watch the first shoots come up in the flower bed and look for the webs of the spider on the grass in the early morning. Autumn will be marked with bright leaves, and the squirrels, even in the city, will be burying treasures for the winter in the earth. As long as you can find pleasure in these small things, each season will bring happiness your way.”\n\nThese are words she lived by.\n\n’54\n\nRobert T. Buck on February 22, 2023.

Lamar and family were longtime members of Grace Evangelical Lutheran Church, Camp Hill, and he was a 32nd Degree Mason with the Valley of Harrisburg A.A.S.R. He loved nothing more than being with his family, and he would generously plan family vacations to various destinations over the years, with Stone Harbor, The Greenbrier, Hawaii and Disney World highlighting the list. Once he entered the workforce, Lamar set off on a 60+ year career in the construction equipment industry, grooming countless employees throughout the field he loved. He loved teaching the “art” of selling to his salesmen and always made sure they carried around their “shut up” card in their coat pocket. Throughout the years, from being a top salesman to an executive, he always managed to make time for his family and the things that mattered most. He was a very down to earth person and the epitome of an honest and moral human, and he made it a point to be home with his family at dinnertime. He would tell you that the driving force behind his professional career, and success, was his devoted and supportive wife. And when grandchildren and great grandchildren came along, they quickly became his greatest source of joy. Surviving Lamar is his wife of 64 years, Janice (Shirk) Light; daughters, Anne-Marie Light Mettus ’81 (Richard) of Feasterville, Elaine Price (James) of Mechanicsburg, and Patti Jean Savastio (Michael) of Mechanicsburg; grandchildren, Megan Friedman (Matthew), Matthew Price, Carinne Mettus, Jonathan Mettus, Ellen Kremer (Kevin), and Thomas Savastio; great-grandchildren, Kellen and Owen; a sister, Shirley Kerr; and several nieces and nephews.\n\nRet. Lt. Col. Terrence “Terry” Moyer on December 29, 2022. Ret. Lt. Col. Terrence “Terry” Moyer, of Oleander Drive, passed away December 29, 2022, at Trellis Supportive Care in Winston-Salem, NC. He was born September 18, 1935, in Marysville, Perry County, PA, to the late Ivan and Delilah Eppley Moyer. After graduating from Allegheny College in 1958, Terry joined the Air Force and served five years of active service as a B-52 Bomber pilot and retired from PA National Guard as a Lt. Col. He retired after 37 years of service from Ingersoll-Rand Company, Construction & Mining Group as Executive Vice President and Western Regional Manager. His years with Ingersoll-Rand allowed extensive travel to all of the continental US including Canada, Hawaii, and Alaska. In addition to his parents, his brother Keith Moyer, preceded him in death. He is survived by his loving wife, Shirley Boger Moyer. Terry and Shirley had a loving 36 years of marriage. They enjoyed making friends as their journeys took them throughout the U.S. and Canada. Terry never met a stranger and will be missed by his numerous friends from his lifelong journey he leaves behind. “A good man!” Survivors include his wife, Shirley Boger Moyer, of the home; his children, Tracey (Rodney) of Philadelphia, PA, Michael of New Orleans, LA, Steve Russ (Patty), and Beth Russ, all of Mocksville; grandchildren, Kelsie Hatherlee, Kacie (Chris) Swiergiel, Kinley Hatherlee, and Tyler (Brittany) Russ; a very special cousin, Cheryl (Ed) Briner of Marysville, PA; and several other cousins, nieces, and nephews. Terry valued every moment he was able to spend with his grandchildren. He provided many opportunities for them, especially sharing his love of Wake Forest Sports with them, making them forever Deacon Fans. Terry also had a lifetime love for the New York Yankees. Terry enjoyed all things sports. Terry always worked hard to stay healthy and in good physical condition. Terry enjoyed gardening and loved sharing his harvest with his many friends and neighbors, sometimes called the “mater man”. Terry’s granddaughters were blessed to have his guiding wisdom and positive influence on their lives. Time and paper do not allow for the expression of love he had for these girls and they have for him. The twinkle in Terry’s eye was for his granddaughter, Kinley, and she says “Terry will be the most handsome star in the night’s sky and the most handsome ray of sunshine in the sun.” She says Terry always told her to do the right things and “I’m watching you.” Granddaughter Kacie says, “there will always be an empty place in my heart without you here. I know you are looking after me.” He always told her, “Kacie, I expect more from you.” Granddaughter Kelsie stated Terry always said “to get it done and be on time,” teaching her a great work ethic that I have been able to carry forward with me.” During Terry’s extended illness he worked extremely hard to get back on his feet and live a normal life. Every step of the way was his wife Shirley. The love they had for one another was not only visible during the good days but was especially evident during Terry’s illness. She was true to her vows of until death do us part. Forever she will be his Shirl. From the words of Elizabeth Ammons, “You can shed tears because they are gone, or you can smile because they lived. You can close your eyes and pray they will come back, or you can open your eyes and see all they left for you. Your heart can be empty because you can’t see them or you can be full of the love you shared. You can turn your back on tomorrow and live yesterday, or you can be happy for tomorrow because of yesterday. You can remember only that they are gone, or you can cherish their memory and let it live on. You can cry and close your mind and feel empty, or you can do what they would want. Smile, open your heart, love and go on.”\n\nTheodore Nelson Ross on March 3, 2023. Theodore Nelson Ross, 92, laid down his working tools on Friday, March 3, 2023.
