Hosmer\n\nNot to be reproduced without permission from the Concord Free Public Library\n\nCompiled by George Tolman in 1908\n\nRevised for editions of 1970 and 1981 and, by Joseph C. Wheeler, for this online edition of 2006.\n\nThis online edition is complete up to the Joseph's revision, 12 October 2016.\n\nQuestions or comments regarding the content of this genealogy should be addressed to Joseph C. Wheeler.\n\nc2006-c2016 Concord Free Public Library, Concord, Mass.\n\nNot to be reproduced in any form without permission of the Curator of Special Collections, Concord Free Public Library.\n\nNote to the 1970 and 1981 editions: Numerous insertions have been made by Mrs. Caleb (Ruth R.) Wheeler (RRW) and we have not usually noted her initials for these. Other insertions by Elizabeth R. Pickard are initialed. Mr. Tolman's manuscript was signed six years before Albert Gallatin Wheeler published in 1914 his 1250 page History of the Wheeler Family in America, but Mr. Tolman had many details not in Gallatin's book. Also, RRW notes that articles related to the English origins of the Wheelers can be found in the American Genealogist, Vol. 12, pp. 4-17 and 135 and Vol. 14, pp 1-4 – July 1935 and Jan. 1936.\n\nNote to the 2006 edition: This edition attempts to bring the earlier documents up to date. Its editor, Joseph C. Wheeler (JCW), had considerable help from Ann Young, Barbara Wheeler, George Francis Wheeler III, Marian Wheeler, Phebe Packer, Kenneth Turkington, Mr. and Mrs. Richard Wheeler and other family members. This new edition has been renumbered for ease of use.\n\nThe number after a name denotes the generation, with the first generation being that of one of the six “early settlers” listed in the table of contents below.\n\nContents\n\n1. The George Wheeler Line 1 - 692\n\n2. The Obadiah Wheeler Line 1001-1159\n\n3. The Lieutenant Joseph Wheeler Line 2701 - 2705\n\n4. The Captain Thomas Wheeler Line 2801 - 2823\n\n5. The Captain Timothy Wheeler Line 2901 - 2905\n\n6. The Sergeant Thomas Wheeler Line 3001 - 3242\n\n7. Probable English Ancestry of the Concord Wheelers\n\nSome of the relationships among these lines are discussed under # 2901 as well as in Section 7.\n\n--Top--\n\nThe George Wheeler Line\n\nGEORGE 1 WHEELER m. KATHERINE PYN\n\nGeorge Wheeler was an early settler of Concord: The first record I find of his name is in 1640. He appears to have been a person of some influence, and his name appears often on town records. He was selectman in 1660. His house lot of 11 acres was at the (present) corner of Main and Walden Streets, and in conjunction with Capt. Timothy Wheeler, who I think was very probably his nephew, he owned a large amount of land in the center of the town. He had also land near the “frog-ponds” and at Walden Pond, and at Nut Meadow Brook. His death is not recorded but his will was dated January 28, 1684/5 and presented for probate June 2, 1687. (Suffolk Prob. Reg. Vol. X fol. 1) His sons Thomas and John were named executors, but the former had died between the above dates and John was named sole executor. The will names “the children of my son William deceased, sons Thomas and John, daughters Elizabeth Fletcher, Sarah Dudley, Ruth Hartwell and Hannah Fletcher, and the children of my daughter ‘Fox' “. His age is not known, but as he had a son married in 1657, and as the birth of the youngest of his eight children occurred in 1645, it is probable that he was born between 1600 and 1610. I think it probable that he was a brother of Obadiah.\n\n[George married Katherine Pyn 9 Dec.1631 -- RRW] Katherine d. 2 Jan. 1684/5. According to a letter from Lexington genealogist Winifred Lovering Holman dated 21 June 1945, George Wheeler married first, 12 May 1645, Mary Studd.] His children by Katherine, as shown by his will and by the Town records were:\n\n2. I Thomas 2 m. Hannah Harwood\n\n3. II William 2 [b. 1633 – AY] m. Hannah Buss\n\n4. III Ruth m. Samuel Hartwell\n\n5. IV Elizabeth m. Francis 2 Fletcher [b. 1636 in Concord. They married 1 Aug. 1656. On April 15 1682, their son Samuel 3 Fletcher, who was born 6 Aug. 1657 and died 23 Oct. 1741, married another Elizabeth 2 Wheeler -- #3008. She was born 23 Feb. 1664. Samuel 3 Fletcher was a Corporal under Capt. Timothy Wheeler (#2901) and fought in King Philip's War. He was a Selectman 1705-7. – JCW]\n\n6. V Hannah m. [Samuel] Fletcher [son of William, son of Robert - RRW] [Note: Births, Marriages and Deaths has “Hanna Wheler” marrying Samewell (Samuel) Smedly 11 July 1667 and “ffrancies ffletcher” marrying Elizabeth Wheeler 11 Oct. 1656.

She was the daughter of Thomas Goble (Gobill). Joseph and Abigail's son Benjamin Dudley was born in Concord 20 March 1698/9 and married Elizabeth Rice of Sudbury. Then their son Joseph Dudley married Mary Warren of Westborough in 1732 -- JCW]\n\n8. VII John 2 b. 19 March 1643 m. Sarah Larkin\n\n9. VIII Mary b. 6 Sept. 1645 m. Eliphalet 2 Fox [They married 26 Oct. 1665. He was the son of Thomas and Rebecca Fox. Eliphlet and Mary Wheeler Fox' daughter Mary married Peter Harwood – JCW]\n\n2.THOMAS 2 WHEELER m. HANNAH HARROD or HARWOOD George 1\n\nThey married 10 Oct. 1657. [Apparently, wife Hannah was daughter of John Harwood and Dorothy - Source: see bolded 212. THOMAS 6 WHEELER - JCW]. His death not of record, nor that of his wife who survived him. [He apparently died 1687 in Concord, MA - Source: see 212. THOMAS 6 WHEELER - JCW]. On 21 Sept. 1687 administration of his estate was granted to his widow Hannah, and his son Thomas. The inventory begins thus: “an inventory of the estate of Thomas Wheeler, son of George Wheeler late of Concord deceased.” (Suffolk Prob. Reg. Vol. X fol 115-116).\n\n[RRW notes that Thomas's descendants in Marlboro, Worcester and Hardwick are described in a paperback on the Wheeler and Warren families compiled by Henry Warren Wheeler, Albany, 1892.] His children, as per Town Records, were:\n\n10. I Hannah b. 25 Oct. 1658 d.12 Aug 1659\n\n11. II Thomas 3 b. 1 Jan. 1659/60 m. Sarah Davis\n\n12. III John 3 b. 2 Sept. 1661 m. Elizabeth Wells [Tolman separately says they moved to Marlboro – JCW]\n\n3. WILLIAM 2 WHEELER m. HANNAH BUSS George 1\n\n[Hannah was born in 1641, daughter of Lt. William Busse – AY] They married 30 Oct. 1659. He died intestate 31 Dec. 1683 and administration of his estate was granted to his widow Hannah. (Middlesex Prob. Rec. Vol II fol 133). On 15 March 1693/4 John Wheeler Senior of Concord, son of and apparent heir to George Wheeler late of said Concord dec'd quitclaims to William, John and George Wheeler, all his right title and interest in certain lands in the south part of Concord “that were in the possession of their father William Wheeler deceased.”\n\nOn the same date another agreement sets forth that “Whereas William Wheeler late of Concord died some time since, possessed of several lands of which he had no legal conveyance as also of a competency of personal and moveable estate, -- but as yet there has been no final settlement of said estate, -- and there being a considerable part of said moveable estate is wasted one way or other and doth not appear, and the rest of which is disposed of by Hannah, relict of the sd Wm Wheeler, and for a final settlement of the whole of the remaining part of the sd estate, amongst the children of the sd Wm Wheeler, and to prevent any further trouble and contention about the premises and to settle peace and unity that may be lasting, they, viz: William Wheeler, John Wheeler and George Wheeler, sons to the sd Wm deceased, upon their own accounts, and Nicholas Shevalley on behalf of Rebeckah his wife of sd Concord, and James Burley of Ipswich on the behalf of Elizabeth his wife, both daughters of sd Wm Wheeler dec'd, do agree in manner and form following, as to the division of property, by virtue of which agreement Wm [#16] as oldest son had a double share of the real estate, and John [#19] and George [#20] and the two younger sons divided the rest, and the personal property was parceled out among the daughters. The land was all in the Nine Acre Corner district, and some of it is in the family to this day.\n\nThe children of William and Hannah (Buss) Wheeler, as shown by the Town Records, and by this agreement, (the birth of sons John and George not being of record), were:\n\n13.

He was called in the town records “John Wheeler Senior”. On 21 Oct. 1719 an agreement for the settlement of his estate is made by his widow Sarah, and his children Samuel, Edward and Ebenezer, on their own accounts, and Wm Woodbury, John Meriam, Timothy Wheeler, Sam'l Prescott and Jonas Prescott on behalf of their wives, as named below.
