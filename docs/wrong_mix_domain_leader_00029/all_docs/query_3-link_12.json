This made her call an early presidential election. Once again, she came out victorious and managed to defeat her opponent, Ranil Wickremasinghe in the election held on 21 December 1999 and was sworn in for another term the next day.\n\nHer second term was one of the most challenging periods for the country. It saw the civil war aggravating with her government suffering major defeats against the opponents during the famous Second Battle of Elephant Pass and Bandaranaike Airport attack. This not only affected the political scene of the country but also saw the country’s economy going into recession for the first time in history.\n\nShe was listed 25th by Forbes magazine in its “100 most powerful women” in 2005.\n\nIn 2006, having remained the leader of the SLFP after leaving office, she “temporally” stepped down from the party leadership citing “continuous harassment she has faced after Mahinda Rajapaksa took office as president” and soon after left the country to self-imposed exile in the United Kingdom.\n\nKumaratunga is a member of the Council of Women World Leaders and the Global Leadership Foundation.
