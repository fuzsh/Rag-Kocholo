        "text": "Iron Viz is a yearly contest hosted by Tableau where like minded tableau-geeks come together and compete on data visualization skills. It consists of 3 qualifying rounds, and a winner from each round is picked based on four skills: design, story telling, analysis, and overall presentation. These three winners compete for the coveted title of Iron Viz Champion at the Tableau Conference. One more winner from each round is chosen as a Crowd Favorite and can be elected through twitter voting. The topic for this qualifier was Politics.\n\nTo directly go to my visualization click here.\n\nThis is my first time participating in the Iron Viz competition and I didn’t like the idea of creating a viz. (visualization) on Politics right away. I didn’t know where to start. I had already seen many visualizations about the current elections on the Tableau gallery and thought everything had been done already.\n\nData\n\nI started looking for data on political leaders and found an overwhelming amount of information. I found data that it had leaders from around the world dating back centuries. It first intrigued me to show the rulers who had ruled the earth ages ago. I wanted to show their kingdoms using the Tableau Map visualization but was unable to do that because the world geography and borders today are very different from the times of the past.\n\nI was reading an article about corporate women leaders when it hit me that maybe I should look up women in politics. In a few minutes time I stumbled upon a data-set that I thought was perfect to start with. I started cleaning the data too excited to put it in Tableau and start working on the viz. After spending hours, I had partially clean data with many questions unanswered:\n\nDo I want to include queens?\n\nWhat should I do about the leaders who are missing tenure information?\n\nIf a leader’s term in office indicates 2013-?, does it mean they still hold that position or is the information missing?\n\nWith all these unanswered questions I started building my viz, looking for a story and hoping to find answers in the process. After looking at the data for three days and not being able to see a story I gave up. I decided to look for a different topic and a different data-set. My search took me to Wikipedia. Fortunately, I typed ‘female prime minister’ and found what I was looking for all this time. A list of women heads of government showed up. I immediately loaded kimonolabs and started scraping my data. Within minutes I was building my viz.\n\nStory\n\nI began by arranging my data in chronological order to find out who the first woman head of government was. I thought this would make a good starting point for the story. The first woman head of government, I found out was Sirimavo Bandarnaike, who was elected as the first woman Prime Minister in Sri Lanka in 1960. Sri Lanka, once again elected a woman leader in 1994. This time it was Prime Minister Chandrika Kumaratunga.\n\nThere was a gap of 34 years between these two leaders and it further roused my curiosity and I started researching what happened during these years.\n\nSurprisingly, Sirimavo held the Prime Minister’s office for 17 years over 3 terms where as Chandrika Kumaratunga was the Prime Minister for only 87 days. Okay, so 87 days naturally begged the question What happened? What happened was Chandrika Kumaratunga had won the Presidential elections that year (1994) and conceded the Prime Minister’s position to her mother- Sirimavo Bandarnaike.\n\nI found this really interesting and I knew I had to include this story in my viz. If only it were that easy. The thing is, I had started with the data set for women heads of government and in exploring it I came across this interesting story that now also included a woman head of state- President Chandrika Kumaratunga. I wanted to share the story but my data-set only included one of these two positions. I decided to stay the course for the time being and see what else I find.\n\nSo, now that I knew who the first woman leader was and that Sri Lanka had twice elected woman leaders I started looking at the data-set as a whole to see if there were any specific trends I could find. Sure enough, I found an interesting one. I noticed, 1990s saw 21 women leaders vs only 5 in the 1980s. This was a 320% jump. Burundi elected Prime Minister Sylvie Kinigi and Rwanda elected Agathe Uwilingiyimana while Canada elected Kim Campbell as the Prime Minister all in 1993.\n\nThis brought me to the Americas. Canada wasn’t the only country in the Americas to have a woman leader. Dominica elected Eugenia Charles in 1980. She became the longest continuously serving woman Prime Minster ever. Peru, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica have all had women heads of government.\n\nI think the question to ask now is-\n\nWill USA join this list soon?\n\nVisit my tableau visualization here: Women of Power – Tableau Link\n\nIf you like my viz. please vote using #IronVizsshah on twitter.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
