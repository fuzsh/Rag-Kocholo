        "text": "Sri Lanka suspended direct talks with Tamil Tiger rebels yesterday while the country's feuding leaders tried to resolve a personal power struggle stemming from the effort to end 19 years of civil war.\n\nPresident Chandrika Kumaratunga extended an olive branch to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday, inviting him for talks on forming a unity government later this week. There was no immediate response from Mr. Wickremesinghe's office, nor from the Tigers. AP"
