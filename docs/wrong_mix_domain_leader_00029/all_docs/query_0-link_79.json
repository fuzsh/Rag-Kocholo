They thought they can get away with any and every dirty work they do. If anyone raised objections they were killed,” she said.\n\nThe former President said the only way forward was for those who want to work for Sri Lanka to join hands irrespective of party differences and introduce a new system.\n\nKumaratunga made the remarks while attending the opening of an office of the New Lanka Freedom Party at Battaramulla.\n\nThe Nawa Lanka Freedom Party is to led by MP Kumara Welgama.\n\nUNI MR ING"
