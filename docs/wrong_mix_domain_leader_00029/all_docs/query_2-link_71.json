        "text": "It is a curious fact that in many democracies, voters choose their leaders according to the most monarchical of principles: family ties to former leaders. Given the option of voting for anyone they like, they cast their ballots for the children, spouses, or other close relatives of those who have already held office. In the United States, George W. Bush followed in the presidential footsteps of his father, George H.W. Bush, just as John Quincy Adams did with his father, John Adams, nearly two centuries earlier. In India, the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty provided the country with its prime ministers for all but four of its first 42 years of independence. As of June 2024, eleven of the world's democracies have heads of government whose fathers or husbands were heads of government before them: Canada, Estonia, Greece, Guatemala, Honduras, Mauritius, Nauru, the Philippines, Samoa, São Tomé and Príncipe, and Uruguay. In an age in which monarchy is viewed with growing skepticism and so-called \"nepo babies\" are called out for their unfair advantages, voters around the world continue to throw their support to those with blood or marital ties to the powerful.\n\nWhat explains the phenomenon of hereditary democracy? Is it harmful, helpful, or indifferent? While a significant literature has emerged on this topic, the sheer ubiquity of hereditary democracy is not widely appreciated.1 The Trudeaus of the world are more numerous than the Assads: Excluding absolute monarchs, there are currently more democratically elected heads of government whose fathers were heads of government before them than autocratic heads of government for which the same is true. Here I define hereditary democracy and present new data on its global prevalence. To help make sense of this puzzling phenomenon, [End Page 146] I develop a framework that takes into account both supply- and demand-side factors, as well as both the voting masses and party elites. Finally, I consider the effects of hereditary democracy, arguing that it artificially shrinks the pool of political talent and can lead to disappointed voter expectations. While these harms are partially offset by at least one notable benefit—the greater numbers of women reaching high office in places where this would otherwise be unlikely to occur—the practice of hereditary democracy must ultimately be condemned. This is not how democracy is supposed to work, and we should not accept it as an inevitable fact of life.\n\nDefining Hereditary Democracy\n\nHereditary democracy is the phenomenon whereby the children, spouses, or other close family members of powerful politicians are themselves elected to high office. The term is an obvious allusion to the more familiar concepts of hereditary monarchy and hereditary autocracy. The role of family is most explicit in monarchies. Here the throne passes from the monarch to a close family member upon his or her death or abdication. Over one-fifth of countries in the world today are monarchies. Most of these are what Stepan, Linz, and Minoves call \"democratic parliamentary monarchies,\" in which the monarch is the ceremonial head of state but not head of government (for example, Sweden and Japan).2 However, there are still several ruling monarchies in the Middle East (such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar), as well as in countries like Eswatini in southern Africa and Brunei in Southeast Asia.\n\nHereditary autocracy is similar to hereditary monarchy, but without the veneer of legitimacy provided by supposedly royal bloodlines. In a hereditary autocracy, a dictator takes power, holds it until old age or death, and then bequeaths it to a family member. Some hereditary autocracies are sultanistic regimes: Just as the military becomes the dictator's goon squad and the state coffers his personal bank account, political power becomes a family heirloom to be passed on to the next generation. However, even non-sultanistic regimes sometimes employ hereditary succession, as in the case of Singapore, where longtime autocrat Lee Kuan Yew was replaced by his son, Lee Hsien Loong. The most common type of succession in such regimes is from father to son, as with the multigenerational Kim dynasty in North Korea. There are currently seven nonmonarchies in the world with a dictator who directly inherited the job from his father: Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Chad, North Korea, Syria, Togo, and Turkmenistan. Leadership in hereditary autocracies may also pass from sibling to sibling, as when Fidel Castro transferred power to his brother Raúl in Cuba in 2008. To my knowledge, there are no cases of authoritarian handover from spouse to spouse, though contemporary [End Page 147] Nicaragua comes close. The current autocrat, Daniel Ortega, not only made his wife, Rosario Murillo, his vice president, but in 2023 called for a constitutional amendment to officially proclaim her \"co-president.\"3\n\nLike hereditary monarchy and hereditary autocracy, hereditary democracy involves family members of powerful politicians attaining high office themselves—but with two crucial differences. First, and most importantly, the incoming leader is not forced on the population by the rules of royal succession or the whims of narcissistic dictators. He or she is chosen, voluntarily, by the electorate. Second, the new leader does not necessarily succeed his or her relative immediately. Indeed, there may be a significant time lag between the two. In Jamaica, for example, there was a ten-year gap between the end of the government of Norman Manley (1955–62), the country's most important independence leader, and the start of the government of his son, socialist firebrand Michael Manley (1972–80, 1989–92). In Guatemala, a whopping seven decades passed between the presidency of Juan José Arévalo (1945–51) and that of his son, Bernardo Arévalo (2024–present), most likely a record. Such delays make the phenomenon of hereditary democracy all the more puzzling. Because political heirs often come to power years after their forebears have left office and do so from opposition, their election cannot be attributed to incumbency advantages.\n\nAs with hereditary monarchy and hereditary autocracy, the most common form of family transmission in democracies is from father to child. Thus Jawaharlal Nehru (1947–64), India's first prime minister, was followed by his daughter, Indira Gandhi (1966–77, 1980–84), into the prime minister's office following his death; in turn, her son, Rajiv Gandhi (1984–89), became prime minister after she was assassinated. Siblings of past leaders may also come to power, such as Yingluck Shinawatra (2011–14) in Thailand, who followed in the prime ministerial footsteps of her brother, Thaksin Shinawatra (2001–2006). Finally, and to a far greater degree than in hereditary monarchy or hereditary autocracy, power can be transferred from spouse to spouse. The baton is almost always passed from husband to wife, as in the cases of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (2007–2015), the wife of former president Néstor Kirchner (2003–2007), in Argentina; Xiomara Castro (2022–present), the wife of former president Manuel Zelaya (2006–2009), in Honduras; or (nearly) Hillary Clinton, the wife of former president Bill Clinton (1993–2001), in the United States.\n\nThe concept of hereditary democracy is closely tied to that of democratic dynasties. The difference between them, albeit minor, can be understood by looking at how dynasties are understood in the context of monarchy. As historian Jeroen Duindam explains: \"A dynasty is a line of kings reaching back into the past, yet it also is the extended group of relatives around a living sovereign.\"4 If monarchy is the system, dynasty refers to the people who occupy that system. Another distinction [End Page 148] is between \"vertical\" and \"horizontal\" dynasties: A vertical dynasty is one that stretches across time from generation to generation, while horizontal dynasty refers to the family members who surround the monarch. Democratic dynasties can take both forms, as in the case of the Bushes in the United States. George H.W. Bush served as president (1989–93) and was then followed into this position by his son, George W. Bush (2001–2009). The elder Bush was himself the son of a former U.S. Senator, Prescott Bush (1952–63), making for a three-generation vertical dynasty. However, this was also a horizontal dynasty, with both George W. Bush and his brother, Jeb, simultaneously serving as governors of Texas (1995–2000) and Florida (1999–2007), respectively. While in theory only two family members are needed to make a dynasty, the term implies a larger number. A dynasty of two is not much of a dynasty.\n\nThe Prevalence of Hereditary Democracy\n\nHow common is hereditary democracy? One way to get a sense of both the extent and importance of this phenomenon is to look at democratically elected heads of government who were the children, spouses, or siblings of former heads of government. To determine how common this was, I assembled a list of all countries in the world that experienced at least one sustained period of democracy between 1945 and 2010, drawing on data from Geddes, Wright, and Frantz's Autocratic Regimes Data Set. I then examined all democratically elected heads of government in those countries to see whether they were the children, spouses, or siblings of former heads of government. The figure was remarkably high: 36 of 89 democracies—or 40 percent—elected at least one head of government who was the child, spouse, or sibling of a former head of government.5 This occurred in virtually every major world region and spanned a wide assortment of countries, from the most developed (Canada, Iceland) to the least developed (Malawi, Bangladesh), the best governed (Uruguay, Switzerland) to the worst governed (the Philippines, Honduras), the oldest democracies (the United States, Belgium) to the youngest (South Korea, Indonesia).\n\nThe benefit of looking at heads of government who are close relatives of former heads of government is that it is easy to observe and can be justified by the importance of the position. However, it is also an extremely conservative measure, arguably downplaying the true extent of the phenomenon. For example, if we were also to look at elected heads of government who were the children of former heads of state, Ghana's current president, Nana Akufo-Addo (2017–present), would have to be included, since his father was the country's ceremonial president from 1970 to 1972. (The elder Akufo-Addo appears on Ghana's banknotes along with independence hero Kwame Nkrumah, giving a sense of his historical stature.) The list would grow longer still if we were to consider [End Page 149] elected heads of government who were close family members of politicians who had held cabinet or other important positions. For example, Portuguese prime minister Mário Soares (1976–78, 1983–85) was the son of a former cabinet minister, as were two of Norway's prime ministers, Gro Brundtland (1981, 1986–89, 1990–96) and Jens Stoltenberg (2000–2001, 2005–13). In Brazil, President Fernando Collor de Mello (1990–92) was the son of a former governor and senator.\n\nThese findings about heads of government are consistent with data on national legislatures, the main focus of existing studies on the topic. The most important such study is Daniel M. Smith's excellent 2018 book, Dynasties and Democracy: The Inherited Incumbency Advantage in Japan. Drawing on his own data and the work of other scholars, he shows that between 1995 and 2016, an average of more than a quarter of all members of Japan's lower house of parliament belonged to dynasties.6 In Ireland, Iceland, and Taiwan, the figure ranged from slightly less than a quarter to slightly more than a third. In Japan, the percentage of \"legacy MPs,\" as Smith calls them, appointed to cabinet was even higher, exceeding 90 percent in the early 2000s. In Ireland, the share of cabinet ministers belonging to dynasties reached 44 percent during the government of Enda Kenny (2011–16), himself the member of a dynasty. While not as widely studied, hereditary democracy at the subnational level is also pervasive. One study of Mexico, for example, found that \"governors with blood or marital links to other politicians have governed in 27 of the 32 states (84%) since 1989.\"7 A study of the Philippines found that as of 2013, \"85 percent of the provincial governors and 84 percent of the town mayors belong to political families.\"8\n\nThe Puzzle of Hereditary Democracy\n\nThe idea that voters in democracies would choose their leaders on the basis of family ties to past leaders is surprising. Enlightenment thinkers like Thomas Paine decried the idea of hereditary succession and viewed the logic of democracy as diametrically opposed to it.9 The most obvious explanation for hereditary democracy is the human propensity to favor one's own kin. This propensity appears in even the most unlikely of places, such as the Catholic Church. Indeed, the term nepotism—defined by the Cambridge English Dictionary as \"the act of using your power or influence to get good jobs or unfair advantages for members of your own family\"—stems from the Italian word nipote, or nephew. It takes its name from the common practice in medieval Europe of clergy appointing their nephews (in many cases actually their illegitimate sons) to positions of influence. The desire to help one's own has always been part of politics. In his two-volume study of the origins and decay of political order, Francis Fukuyama places the struggle against \"patrimonialism,\" [End Page 150] or \"the natural human propensity to favor family and friends,\" at the center of his story.10\n\nHereditary democracy would seem to be an expression of this nepotistic urge. In truth, however, it is a much stranger phenomenon: Hereditary democracy entails favoring somebody else's kin, not one's own. To illustrate how odd this is, consider the topic of college admissions. In 2019, the Hollywood actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin made headlines when it was revealed that they had paid bribes and engaged in other illegal activities to help their daughters gain admission to the colleges of their choice. Yet as outrageous as this behavior was, the logic behind it was not hard to grasp. Indeed, Huffman's husband, William H. Macy, had articulated it clearly in a 2004 interview when he stated: \"[N]epotism works … If I can give [my children] a leg up, I absolutely would.\"11 Now let us imagine these same parents paying bribes not to get their own daughters into college, but instead the offspring of someone they had never met and never would meet. Why would anybody do this? That, in essence, is the puzzle of hereditary democracy.\n\nTo make sense of this puzzle, Daniel M. Smith argues that family members of politicians benefit from what he calls \"the inherited incumbency advantage.\" Democratic incumbents, as is well known, benefit from a range of advantages, including influence over public spending, free media coverage, and simple name recognition. Many of these advantages, he argues, can be passed from family member to family member. This is not incumbency in the strictest sense, but it has a similar effect and explains why democratic dynasties are so common. This is backed up by several large-N studies that have sought to estimate the magnitude of this advantage. One study of India's 2014 election, for example, found that dynastic candidates enjoyed a \"dynasty premium\" of 19 percentage points over nondynastic candidates. Studies of other countries, including the United States, the Philippines, and Norway, have likewise found that dynastic candidates enjoy robust and statistically significant advantages.12\n\nYet while there can be little doubt that the inherited incumbency advantage is real, the precise nature of this advantage is debatable. Why is it to a candidate's advantage to be related to another politician? How does this work exactly? In approaching this problem, it is useful to make two distinctions: the distinction between supply-side factors and [End Page 151] demand-side factors, and the distinction between the electorate and the selectorate. Supply-side factors are the objective skills or assets possessed by candidates. The skills needed to thrive in the world of democratic politics are not evenly distributed in a given population. Some people are simply better at giving speeches, working a room, earning people's trust, and so forth. One possible reason why the children of politicians often get elected is that they possess more of these skills than their nondynastic counterparts. This has been described in the context of college admissions as \"hereditary meritocracy,\" with the children of highly educated people often becoming objectively strong candidates.13 The same principle may also apply to the world of politics: Whether due to genetics or the lessons learned by growing up in a political family, hereditary candidates may simply be good at politics.\n\nOne example is Justin Trudeau, Canada's prime minister since 2015. In terms of his level of formal education and political experience, he was arguably not qualified for the job. What he was, however, was a gifted politician, something on display since he first ran for parliament in 2008. His charm on the stump, talent for retail politics, and ability to articulate an inclusive and optimistic vision of Canadian identity enabled him to win his seat in a highly competitive district, despite his Liberal Party losing badly at the national level. Those same skills later enabled Trudeau to lead his party to victory in the 2015, 2019, and 2021 federal elections.\n\nWhy was Trudeau so good at politics? By his own account, his political education began during his \"Childhood at 24 Sussex,\" the Ottawa address of Canadian prime ministers, as the first chapter of his 2014 memoir Common Ground is titled. As the son of one of Canada's longest-serving prime ministers, Pierre Trudeau (1968–79, 1980–84), he had a front-row seat to national politics from the day he was born in 1971. Justin Trudeau's predecessor as Liberal Party leader, Michael Ignatieff, offered a similar explanation: \"He's an actor, a professional politician who fully inhabits the role with a confidence that comes from having always known this was the role he was born to play.\"14\n\nIf supply-side factors can be thought of as the objective skills or assets that candidates possess, demand-side factors are far more subjective: These are the beliefs that voters have about dynastic candidates based on their political forebears—beliefs that may or may not be true. The forebears are often larger-than-life figures. Many played a key role in the struggle for independence from colonialism, such as Jawaharlal Nehru in India, Jomo Kenyatta in Kenya, or Grantley Adams in Barbados. Others occupied opposite ends in the struggle over authoritarianism. On one side are democratic opposition leaders like Benigno Aquino Jr. in the Philippines, whose widow and son were both elected president after he was assassinated. Though never permitted to assume the presidency outright, another example is Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma, the [End Page 152] daughter of assassinated independence leader Aung San. On the other side of the regime divide are former dictators such as Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines, General Park Chung Hee in South Korea, and General Omar Torrijos in Panama, whose children all won the presidency under democracy. The current mayor of Taipei and rising political star in Taiwanese politics, Wayne Chiang, is believed to be the great-grandson of former dictator Chiang Kai-shek.\n\nAs the family members of such high-profile figures, hereditary candidates typically present themselves as uniquely qualified to continue the legacy of their forebears. Yet while this sort of \"brand\" or reputational capital might seem like it should be regarded as a supply-side factor, it is better thought of as a demand-side factor, for two reasons. First, it is premised on the existence of a desire within the electorate for whatever that legacy is supposed to entail. A law-and-order appeal from the child of a former dictator, for example, will only work if there is widespread demand for law and order within the population. Second, and even more importantly, it is an open question whether the children, spouses, or other close family members of former leaders really are uniquely qualified to continue their legacy. We know this intuitively: None of us are carbon copies of our parents, much less our spouses. Would we agree to open-heart surgery from the son of a famous surgeon if that son had never even been to medical school? The question is absurd—and yet this is precisely the logic that many voters seem to follow when choosing their leaders. The idea that the children or widows of past politicians will resemble their parents or husbands is not an objective fact but an assumption that voters bring to the equation.\n\nIn addition to the distinction between supply-side and demand-side factors, it is useful to distinguish between the electorate and what the literature on candidate selection calls the \"selectorate.\"15 Thus far the discussion has focused on the electorate, or the voting masses. This is the main difference between hereditary democracy and other forms of hereditary rule: no mass electorate, no hereditary democracy. To have any real chance of getting elected, however, it is necessary in most democracies to be nominated by a political party. Sometimes this is a legal requirement. At other times it is the product of strong partisan identity or partisan polarization, with voters automatically casting their ballots for whichever candidate their preferred party puts forward. This can give those who select the candidates to appear on the party ticket, or the selectorate, great influence. As with the electorate, there is good reason why, once again, candidates related to other politicians may enjoy both supply- and demand-side advantages.\n\nOne major supply-side advantage is that they are more likely to know the right people. After years of being dragged along to party meetings and social events by their parents or spouses, they have personal connections to party elites. In the case of personalistic parties, in which virtually [End Page 153] all power is held in the hands of one person, this connection may be particularly dramatic. In such cases, their relative is the selectorate. In Argentina, for example, Juan Perón selected his wife, Isabel Martínez de Perón, to be his running mate in the September 1973 presidential election, and she became president after he died in office. Something similar played out in Pakistan, albeit with a bizarre and morbid twist. Following the 2007 assassination of Benazir Bhutto, the former prime minister and leader of the Pakistan People's Party, a meeting of top party leaders was held in which a portrait of the late Bhutto was propped up in a chair at the head of the table.16 Her handwritten will was then brought out, in which she decreed that the party was to be cochaired by her 19-year-old son, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, and her widower, Asif Ali Zardari. In 2008, the husband was elected Pakistan's president, and in 2022 the son became minister of foreign affairs, after being elected to parliament four years earlier.\n\nFinally, hereditary candidates may benefit from demand-side factors with respect to the selectorate. Here the work of Jason Brownlee on hereditary succession in modern autocracies provides insights. Why do non-sultanistic regimes, like Taiwan under single-party rule (1949–2000) or contemporary Singapore (1965–present), sometimes opt to replace outgoing autocrats with their first-born sons? The answer, Brown-lee argues, is that while all top officials in such regimes would like to become the new autocrat themselves, they are even more fearful of a succession crisis and thus may rally around the outgoing autocrat's son as a \"second-best choice.\"17 The same logic may apply to the selectorate in the context of democracy, with party elites giving their support to the outgoing leader's family member in order to avoid a nasty leadership contest or a party schism. In addition, they may hope to ride the candidate's coattails to influence—especially after a tragedy such as Bhutto's assassination in Pakistan, where a family member of the slain leader is likely to benefit from a sympathy vote.\n\nThe Effects of Hereditary Democracy\n\nWhat are the effects on democracy? There are at least two ways to think that hereditary democracy could be harmful. One way is to block the rise of talented leaders who do not have the right family ties. To understand this harm, it is useful to draw on Rousseau's distinction between \"hereditary\" aristocracy, which he believed was the worst form of government, and \"elective\" aristocracy, which he believed was the best.18 By elective aristocracy, he meant a system with competitive elections that would allow the most capable and virtuous leaders to rise to the top. Hereditary democracy makes a mockery of this idea. The 1993 presidential contest in Chile, for example, was fought between Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, the son of a former president, and Arturo Alessandri [End Page 154] Besa, the nephew of one former president and the grandson of another. The 1999 presidential election in Panama was fought between Mireya Moscoso, the widow of a three-time former president, and Martín Torrijos, the son of a former military dictator. In Bangladesh, Mauritius, and Sri Lanka, entire national party systems have revolved around competing family cliques. It is implausible in the extreme that the best and brightest in these countries all happened to share blood or marital ties to other politicians. By artificially shrinking the pool of political talent, hereditary democracy undermines the sorting function that Rousseau expected elections to play.\n\nA second potential harm is to create a mismatch between voter expectations and reality. If voters elect the child, widow, or other relative of an important politician on the assumption that they will be similar to their family member, and that assumption turns out to be wrong, the quality of representation will be poor. There are numerous instances of democratic heirs who diverged markedly from their predecessors. For example, while India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, had a strong personal commitment to democracy and underutilized his power, his daughter, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, concentrated power and established authoritarian rule between 1975 and 1977 during an episode called the Emergency. A more recent example is Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the United States, a conspiracy theorist whose views shared little in common with those of his uncle, John F. Kennedy, or his father, Robert F. Kennedy, but who nevertheless attracted support during his 2024 run for president because of his surname. In short, voting for a candidate on the assumption that they will be similar to their family member would appear to be an example of what is known as the \"representativeness heuristic.\"19 As the literature on heuristics and biases has shown, such cognitive shortcuts are sometimes useful—but they can also lead to serious error.\n\nDespite these potential harms, there is at least one way that hereditary democracy can be beneficial: It can allow women to reach high office in places where this would otherwise be unlikely to occur.20 The first woman in the world to be democratically elected prime minister was Sirimavo Bandaranaike of Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) in 1960. This was more than six decades before Sweden, for example, got its first female prime minister. Not coincidentally, she was also the widow of S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, the recently assassinated prime minister. She would go on to govern on multiple occasions, as would her daughter. Other countries that have had female heads of government under democracy—and the years they first took office—include: India (1966), Pakistan (1988), Bangladesh (1991), Indonesia (2001), Thailand (2011), and South Korea (2013). Each was the daughter, widow, or sister of a former male head of government. Of the first fifteen women to win a presidential election or to become prime minister after leading their parties to victory [End Page 155] in parliamentary elections, eight were widows or daughters of former male heads of government, and three were related to other high-profile male leaders.21\n\nWhile the election of female heads of government in Asia is especially striking, the phenomenon of wives and daughters being elected to high office is not limited to any one region. Of the eight women who have won presidential elections in Latin America, three were the wives or widows of former male presidents and a fourth was the widow of an assassinated opposition leader.22 In Guyana, a small English-speaking country in South America where the vast majority of the population is Indo- or Afro-Guyanese, the victor of the 1997 presidential election was Janet Jagan, the Jewish, American-born widow of former president Cheddi Jagan. The first woman to serve as Estonia's current prime minister, Kaja Kallas (2021–present), is the daughter of a former minister, Siim Kallas (2002–2003). While the United States has never elected a female president, there is a long tradition of \"widow's succession\" in Congress, with widows effectively inheriting the seats of their deceased husbands.23 To the extent that we believe in the importance of \"descriptive representation,\" or the idea that political representatives should reflect key demographic traits of the population including gender, this is one area where hereditary democracy must be regarded as beneficial.\n\nHarmless Fact of Life or Democratic Failure?\n\nIt is telling that in the world's first modern democracy, the United States, the first president to have biological children, John Adams (George Washington was famously childless), was followed into the presidency by his son. The case of India, long thought of as the world's biggest democracy, is even more dramatic, with both the daughter and grandson of its first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, becoming prime ministers themselves—and Nehru's great-grandson, Rahul Gandhi, currently the country's most high-profile opposition leader. These cases are not unique. Whether one looks at executives or legislatures, national or subnational governments, hereditary democracy is ubiquitous. Where elections are held, dynasties emerge.\n\nWhat should we make of this? One view holds that hereditary democracy is a harmless fact of life. In his provocative 2003 book In Praise of Nepotism: A Natural History, Adam Bellow—the son of the Nobel Prize–winning novelist Saul Bellow—argues that nepotism, broadly understood, has always been with us, always will be with us, and that the way it is practiced today is much less bad than it was in the past. He describes the modern version of this phenomenon as \"meritocratic nepotism,\" in which family connections help a person get their foot in the door, but after that they must prove their own worth—something they are likely to do, he argues, because they have been apprenticed to [End Page 156] the role since childhood. This extends not just to politicians, but also to actors, academics, police officers, union leaders, and virtually every other occupation one can think of.\n\nThis notion of capable dynasts is ultimately an empirical question—and one on which the jury is still out. Some studies indicate that the opposite is true: They find that dynastic politicians tend to possess lower levels of education, to have less experience in local government, and to generate worse economic outcomes for their districts than nondynastic politicians. Other studies have arrived at different conclusions.24 While more research is needed, we should not be surprised if the negative findings are correct. For economists, one of the major types of \"market failure\" is the emergence of monopolies or oligopolies that stifle competition. The outsized influence of a small number of political families can be understood in the same way. It is a democratic failure, not an innocuous quirk.\n\nBut perhaps the strongest argument against hereditary democracy is purely normative. In his 1971 classic work of political philosophy, A Theory of Justice, John Rawls asks us to carry out a thought experiment: If a person were behind the \"veil of ignorance,\" with no knowledge of their gender, race, religion, level of wealth, or other personal characteristics, what kinds of rules would they choose for their society? Rawls calls this the \"original position\" and argues that a rational person in it would opt for political liberalism and substantial economic redistribution. Political theorists ever since have debated the soundness of Rawls' conclusions. One thing that absolutely nobody would choose in the original position, however, is a political system dominated by a small number of political families. Stripped of proper nouns—whether Kennedy, Gandhi, Park, Bush, Chiang, Arévalo, or any other surname to which we may be personally sympathetic—it is hard not to conclude that this is an unfair and patently ridiculous way to run a democracy. To be sure, there are many aspects of modern democracy that nobody would choose in the original position, such as dark money, partisan gerrymandering, and misinformation. We all know these things are wrong, however, and rightly call them out. It is time to have a similar reckoning with hereditary democracy."
