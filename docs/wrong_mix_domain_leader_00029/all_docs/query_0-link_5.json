        "text": "January 12, 2005 Prime Minister Paul Martin today announced that he will visit Tsunami-affected countries Thailand, Sri Lanka and India, as well as Japan and China, from January 15 to 23, 2005. \"Asia is a dynamic region which holds tremendous opportunity, but which is being challenged by the devastation wrought by the tsunami,\" said the Prime Minister. \"My trip is an opportunity to express solidarity with the governments and populations of the region as they forge ahead with recovery efforts and to confer with other donors, but also to revitalize bilateral relations with each country and advance global issues.\" In Phuket, Thailand, on January 16, the Prime Minister will tour tsunami-affected areas and discuss with government officials and volunteers both the recovery underway and future reconstruction needs. He will also meet with members of the Canadian forensic team. In Sri Lanka on January 17, the Prime Minister will survey the tsunami-hit region from the air and visit the DART team deployed in Ampara. In Colombo, the Prime Minister will meet with humanitarian agencies, President Chandrika Kumaratunga and members of parliament. \"I look forward to receiving first-hand reports from Canadians in the region as we continue to plan Canada's comprehensive contribution to longer-term reconstruction,\" said the Prime Minister. I will also thank the public servants who are working tirelessly in support of affected Canadians and their families, and individual Canadians who are reinforcing the efforts of governments and international partners.\" In India the following day, the Prime Minister will lay a wreath at the Rajghat, a memorial to Mahatma Gandhi, before meetings with President Abdul Kalam and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Discussions will focus on ways to strengthen our bilateral partnership, including efforts on global environmental and security issues such as climate change, terrorism, and global governance. The Prime Minister will also be briefed on the impact of the tsunami and meet with a Canadian tsunami expert who is presently in New Delhi to explore ways in which Canada and India can collaborate on Tsunami-warning procedures for the Indian Ocean region. While in Tokyo, Japan, on January 19, the Prime Minister will address a luncheon hosted by the Nippon Keidanren - also known as the Japan Business Federation, an organization whose membership includes large Japanese multinationals, and members of the Canadian business community in Japan. The Prime Minister will then meet with Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. The next day, he will attend a breakfast roundtable meeting to discuss global issues with Japanese decision and opinion leaders. The Prime Minister will then travel to Beijing, China, where he will meet with and attend a working luncheon hosted by Premier Wen Jiabao, followed by meetings with President Hu Jintao and the Chairman of the National People's Congress, Wu Bangguo. Discussions are expected to focus on a wide range of economic, bilateral, and global topics, including human rights, environment and health. Later that day, the Prime Minister will address a Canada-China Business Council (CCBC) dinner. The CCBC works closely with the Government of Canada to expand trade and investment with China. The Prime Minister's trip to China coincides with a January 18-25 trade mission being led by International Trade Minister Jim Peterson. The mission includes stops in Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong, China. Finally, the Prime Minister will visit Hong Kong, China, where he will meet with Chief Executive Mr Tung Chee Hwa on January 22. The following day, the Prime Minister and Veteran's Affairs Minister Albina Guarnieri will attend a remembrance ceremony at the Sai Wan Bay War Cemetery, which contains the graves of Canadians who died in the Battle of Hong Kong or subsequently in captivity. This will be the first of many ceremonies and events to commemorate 2005 as the Year of the Veteran, designated by the Government of Canada in recognition of the important contribution made by our veterans. -30- PMO Press Office: (613) 957-5555"
