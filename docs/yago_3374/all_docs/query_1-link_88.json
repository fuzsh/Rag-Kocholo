        "text": "Born on 24 December 1837 in Munich, Bavaria, Her Royal Highness Duchess Elizabeth Amalie Eugenie, known as ‘Sisi’, was the fourth child of Duke Maximilian Joseph of Bavaria and his wife Princess Ludovika of Bavaria.\n\nThe family lived at Possenhofen Castle where the children were raised in an uninhibited environment, and Elizabeth would often skip education in favour of riding through the countryside.\n\nIn 1853 Elizabeth’s aunt, Princess Sophie of Bavaria arranged a marriage between her son Emperor Francis Joseph and Elizabeth’s elder sister, Helene. Elizabeth accompanied her mother and elder sister on the journey to Austria in order for the Emperor to formally propose to Helene. Still in mourning over the death of an aunt, the three women were dressed in black for the journey and intended to change into more appropriate clothing on their arrival, but the coach containing their gala dresses failed to arrive.\n\nWith Helene’s dark colouring, wearing black did not suit, and with her being a pious, quiet young woman she and Emperor Francis Joseph felt uncomfortable within each others company. However, he was instantly infatuated by the striking appearance of Elizabeth, and defied his mother when he insisted that he would not propose to Helene, and suggested if he could not have Elizabeth then he would not marry at all. It was just five days later when the official announcement of their betrothal was made.\n\nEight months later on 24 April 1854, at Augustinerkirche, Vienna, the couple were married.\n\nWith a drastic change of lifestyle, Elizabeth found it difficult to adapt to the rigid and strict etiquette of court life and soon began displaying signs of ill health, where she suffered coughing fits, became anxious and frightened whenever she descended a narrow steep staircase.\n\nJust ten months after her wedding, in 1855 she gave birth to her first child, a daughter, Archduchess Sophie of Austria, who had been named by Elizabeth’s domineering mother-in-law. The dominant Princess Sophie not only named her granddaughter after herself without consulting her daughter-in-law, but she also took charge of the child, where she refused to allow Elizabeth to breastfeed or care for her own child and was often heard calling Elizabeth a “silly young mother”.\n\nA year later in 1856 Elizabeth gave birth to her second daughter, Archduchess Gisela of Austria. Once again Princess Sophie removed the child from Elizabeth’s care.\n\nElizabeth was made to feel more and more unwanted in the palace as she had failed to produce a male heir and would find notes left in her room indicating her failure, believed to have been written by Princess Sophie;"
