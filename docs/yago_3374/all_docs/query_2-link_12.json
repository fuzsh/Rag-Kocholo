        "text": "KING FREDERICK WILLIAM IV.\n\nA telegram from Cape Race announces the death of the King of Prussia. His Majesty King FREDERICK WILLIAM IV., son of FREDERICK WILLIAM III., was born on Oct. 15, 1795. The very greatest care was bestowed upon his education, and some of the most distinguished men of the day were his instructors. The late monarch was present at most of the great battles fought in 1813, 1814 and 1815, although he was not intrusted with any command. He was called to the throne in 1840 by the death of his father, and distinguished his accession by repairing several of the injuries which had grown out of his predecessor's system of government. But the liberality that marked the early part of King FREDERICK WILLIAM's reign was not kept up. The Constitution, promised in 1815, was long delayed, and, after it was granted, the King, on more than one occasion, sought the aid of the Chambers to release him from the provisions that guaranteed representative Government. During the Crimean war, the King, in endeavoring to keep friends with either party, lost the regard of both. He showed himself to be time-serving, vacilating and insincere. With all his faults, however, FREDERICK WILLIAM was a sincere friend of science and the arts. He surrounded his throne with eminent men. His Majesty had been in exceedingly bad health for several years, during which time the Government of the Kingdom was administered by his brother, the late Prince-Regent, but now FREDERICK WILLIAM V. The new King is generally regarded as an absolutist, and opposed to popular representation. It has been predicted that, upon his ascending the throne, Prussia would have a strong Government or undergo a revolution. He is exceedingly ambitious -- resolute and determined in his views -- and has made FREDERICK the Great a model for all his conduct. His Majesty's eldest son married the Princess Royal of England."
