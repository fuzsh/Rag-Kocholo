        "text": "A tale of sadness and strength\n\nErie Astin\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\nPublished in\n\nHistory of Women\n\n·\n\n6 min read\n\n·\n\nJan 17, 2023\n\n--\n\nWith the movie Corsage recently coming out, Empress Elisabeth of Austria (“Sisi”) is once again in the public eye. Ironic, since in life she was extremely introverted and hated the responsibilities and public attention that came with being empress. She performed her duties anyway, and became an iconic figure in Austria and throughout the world.\n\nI became aware of Sisi when I was doing virtual tours of European cities during the pandemic. As my tour guide trained his camera on one of the palaces Sisi had lived in, he told the story of the depression she suffered through all her life. I live with depression myself and immediately felt a kinship.\n\nThe tour guide didn’t mention how Sisi’s life ended. I didn’t know about it until I was researching this article; it was shocking. But first, the beginning.\n\nElisabeth Amalie Eugenie, also known as Sisi, was born on December 24, 1837 in Munich, Germany. She was the fourth child of Duke Maximilian Joseph in Bavaria and Princess Ludovika of Bavaria.\n\nSisi had a privileged upbringing as a member of the Bavarian aristocracy, receiving a classical education that included literature, history, music, and the arts. She was fluent in several languages, including German, French, and Hungarian. (The Hungarian became especially precious to her later.)\n\nSisi enjoyed participating in sports, especially horseback riding, and developed a love of horses at an early age. Overall, she had a happy and privileged childhood.\n\nHer life took a turn for the worse in April 1854, when she was married off to Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria. Theirs was not a happy union. Though the couple ended up having four children together — Sophie, Gisela, Rudolf, and Marie Valerie — they had a strained relationship. Such is the result when two families unite for power instead of love.\n\nAs soon as she entered the Austrian court, Sisi began to clash with her mother-in-law, who was also named Empress Elisabeth. The two had very different personalities and viewpoints. The older woman was traditional and placed a strong emphasis on protocol and etiquette, while Sisi disliked the strict rules and expectations that came with being a member of the royal family.\n\nDespite her strained family relationships and growing depression, Sisi shined. Cultivating her interest in fashion, she became known for her long, thick hair and her signature hairstyle, which involved braiding her hair and then twisting it into a knot.\n\nSoon Sisi’s hairstyle was so iconic that it was imitated by other women, both in Austria and around the world. Women imitated her style of dress as well. Sisi loved jewelry and simple, elegant clothing. She often wore dresses with high necklines and full skirts and avoided flashy or ostentatious attire. These fashion choices were noted and discussed in the press of the time.\n\nSisi kept up her childhood interest in physical activity, too. She rode horses, went on long walks, and hiked in the mountains.\n\nIn fact, Sisi was so dedicated to her fitness routine that she carried her own exercise equipment with her when she traveled, so that she could continue her workouts no matter where she was. She even had a portable gym installed on one of her yachts, complete with weights, a balance beam, and other equipment.\n\nHer commitment to fitness became something of a legend, and she was often depicted in paintings and photographs as a strong and athletic woman.\n\nOver the years, though, Sisi’s depression weighed on her more and more. She felt unhappy and unfulfilled in her role as empress. As a deeply private and introspective person, she struggled with feelings of loneliness and isolation despite her privileged position.\n\nSisi withdrew from public life as much as possible and began spending more and more time away from court, visiting places like Hungary, Greece, and Corfu.\n\nShe quickly developed a special affinity for Hungary and the Hungarian people. In Hungary, she was able to escape the constraints placed upon her as empress and enjoy a greater degree of freedom. She felt a strong connection to the country and its culture. Thanks to her childhood lessons, she was fluent in Hungarian and was interested in the history and customs of the Hungarian people.\n\nShe had a special affection for the Hungarian countryside and enjoyed spending time in the rural areas of the country, riding horses and taking long walks and hikes in the mountains.\n\nSisi was also a patron of the arts, attending concerts, plays, and other cultural events while in Hungary.\n\nThough she was a huge lover of Hungary, Sisi didn’t neglect Austria, even though she was unhappy there. She was greatly interested in politics and social issues and used her influence to promote causes such as education for women and the rights of the poor.\n\nOne of the ways in which Sisi supported charitable causes was by making donations to various organizations and institutions. She was generous with her money and often contributed to charities and other causes that she believed in.\n\nIn addition to making financial contributions, Sisi was also actively involved in charitable work. She often visited hospitals and other institutions to offer support and comfort to those in need, and she was kind and compassionate towards those who were suffering.\n\nSisi spent her life fighting to be happy. Sadly, her life did not have a pleasant ending. She was assassinated at the age of 60 by an Italian anarchist while she was on a trip to Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nOn September 10, 1898, Sisi was traveling incognito and was walking alone along the promenade of the Lac Léman when she was approached by an Italian anarchist named Luigi Lucheni. Lucheni had intended to kill the Duke of Orléans, but when he couldn’t find him, he decided to attack the next important-looking person he saw, which happened to be Sisi.\n\nLucheni approached Sisi from behind and struck her in the chest with a file that he had sharpened to a point. The file pierced her lung and she collapsed to the ground. Despite efforts to save her, Sisi died a few hours later.\n\nLucheni was arrested at the scene and later confessed to the assassination. He was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison, where he died in 1910.\n\nSisi’s assassination was a shock to the people of Austria and the rest of Europe, and her funeral was attended by thousands of mourners. She is remembered as a popular and iconic figure in Austria and is revered by many people today.\n\nSisi’s children had a mixed history. Two of them lived to middle age and beyond, while the other two died during Sisi’s lifetime. Here is a brief overview of their lives:\n\nSophie: Sophie was the oldest of Sisi’s children and was born in 1855. She was a talented musician and enjoyed a close relationship with her mother. However, Sophie was also a victim of the rigid protocols of the royal court, and she struggled to find happiness in her role as a member of the royal family. She died of diphtheria at the age of 24.\n\nGisela: Gisela was born in 1856 and was known to be a kind and compassionate person. She was interested in charitable causes and was active in supporting various charitable organizations. Gisela married Prince Leopold of Bavaria and had several children. She died in 1932 at the age of 76.\n\nRudolf: Rudolf was born in 1858 and was the heir apparent to the Austro-Hungarian throne. However, he struggled with mental health issues and is believed to have suffered from depression and anxiety. In 1889, Rudolf committed suicide at the age of 30.\n\nMarie Valerie: Marie Valerie was the youngest of Sisi’s children and was born in 1868. She was close to her mother and shared her love of music and the arts. Marie Valerie married Prince Franz Salvator of Austria and had several children. She died in 1924 at the age of 56.\n\nOverall, Sisi’s children had varied lives and experiences, and each of them struggled in different ways with the demands and expectations of their royal positions. (One is reminded of the British royal family’s current struggles.)\n\nSources:\n\nPalaces of Europe. https://www.palaces-of-europe.com/empress-sisi.html\n\nAustria Info. https://www.austria.info/en/culture/sisi-empress-of-austria"
