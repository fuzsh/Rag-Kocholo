        "text": "How did my love of royalty actually started? I was thirteen and borrowed the book Sissi, impératrice d’Autriche by Jean des Cars. This was the first royal biography that I read. Many would follow! But who was Sisi actually?\n\nMany know her from the famous Ernst Marischka films from the 1950s with Romy Schneider “Sissi”. Her family called her Sisi, with one s. I really loved those movies and Romy Schneider. However, I don’t believe they gave a real picture of the real life of Elisabeth of Austria and Hungary. I will illustrate this with a couple of true or false statements.\n\nIn the movie, Franz Joseph choose Sisi over Helene: true or false?\n\nTRUE!\n\nSophie of Habsbourg (mother of Franz Joseph) and Ludovika of Bavaria (Sisi’s mother) were sisters and had planned a marriage between their children Franz Joseph and Helene. But during a family weekend in Bad Ischl, Franz Joseph fell in love with Helena’s younger sister Elisabeth (Sisi). Both were engaged a couple of days later.\n\nSisi was Elisabeth’ real nickname: true or false?\n\nTRUE!\n\nAlmost all children of Max and Ludovika of Bavaria had pet names:\n\nLudwig – Louis (1831-1920)\n\nHelene – Nene (1834-1890)\n\nKarl-Theodor – Gackel (1839-1909)\n\nMarie Sophie (1841-1925)\n\nMathilde – Spatz (1843-1925)\n\nSophie Charlotte (1847-1897)\n\nMax Emanuel – Mapperl (1849-1893)\n\nDo you want to know more about her sisters? Please read my blog: Sisi’s sisters.\n\nThe marriage between Franz Joseph and Sisi was happy: true or false?\n\nPARTLY…\n\nThe marriage of Franz Joseph and Sisi started from love. This was quite exceptional at that time. But Elisabeth was actually a very selfish woman. She could hardly settle in Vienna, had a difficult relationship with her mother-in-law and could not handle all the obligations associated with an imperial title. Every excuse was good enough to leave. Sisi was also called the wandering empress.\n\nShe was certainly unique too! She loved Franz Joseph but not enough to stay in Vienna. That is why she herself arranged for a replacement …\n\nKatharina Schratt, an Austrian actress, was Franz Joseph’s Freundin.\n\nGrandmother at 36: true or false?\n\nTRUE!\n\nFranz Joseph and Elisabeth had four children: Sophie (1855-1857), Gisela (1856-1932), Rudolf (1858-1889) en Marie Valerie (1868-1924).\n\nAt that time, imperial children were not raised by their own parents but by governesses and teachers. That was no different in Austria. Archduchess Sophie, Sisi’s mother-in-law, actually governed the Habsburg court and made all decisions regarding the children. Therefor, Sisi did not have a good relationship with Gisela and Rudolf. She changed this with her youngest daughter. Marie-Valerie was her favorite child.\n\nHer daughter Gisela married Leopold of Bavaria in 1873 and the first child was born in 1874. So Elisabeth became grandmother on her 36th…\n\nShe is the reason they became King and Queen of Hungary: true or false?\n\nTRUE!\n\nElisabeth played no political role. Yet she did have influence at some point during her life. Elisabeth managed to unite Austria and Hungary. In 1867, the dual monarchy of Austria–Hungary was established. Her crowning in Buda (Budapest) was her greatest triumph.\n\nHappy end: true or false?\n\nFALSE…\n\nAfter the mysterious death of her son Rudolf in Mayerling in 1889, the loss of her sister Sophie at the fire in the Bazar de la Charité in Paris in 1897, she predicted that she would also die in a tragic way. She was right … On 10 September 1898, she was murdered in Geneva by Luigi Lucheni, an Italian anarchist.\n\nBOOKS About Sisi"
