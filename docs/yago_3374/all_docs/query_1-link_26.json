        "text": "Thanks to the Sisi films, most know about Néné, Sisi’s oldest sister. But did you know that she had four sisters in total? Helene, Marie, Mathilde and Sophie. And all Ludovika daughters led a very tragic life. Curious? Read on…\n\nOn November 9, 1828 Ludovika married her Duke Maximilian in Bavaria: together they had ten children including five daughters.\n\nAs the eldest daughter of the family, Helene, nickname Néné, was destined to marry Emperor Franz Joseph. However, he chose Elisabeth. For Helene, this was of course a huge disappointment. Helene retired back to her family home Possenhofen. Helene met Duke Maximilian Joseph,\n\nhereditary Prince of Thurn and Taxis during a mountain hunt. The couple married on August 24, 1858 at Possenhofen.\n\nMaximilian and Helene had four children\n\nLouisa (1859 – 1948)\n\nElisabeth Marie (1860 – 1881)\n\nMaximilian (1862 – 1885)\n\nAlbert (1867 – 1953)\n\nMuch to her grief, Helene was widowed a few weeks after the birth of her son Albert in 1867. Maximilian died of kidney disease. On the death of her father-in-law, Maximilian Karl von Thurn and Taxis, in 1871, she became the head of the family, until the majority of her son Maximilian. She was very popular with the Regensburg people. Life became increasingly restless and lonely for the aging Helene, and she sought more and more consolation in religion. The death of her daughter Elisabeth (severely weakened after the birth of her child), of course also contributed to this.\n\nOn June 24, 1883 Maximilian came of age and took over as the seventh prince of Thurn und Taxis the government of the royal house. Helene could finally have more time for herself, but not for long. Maximilian died on 2 June 1885 of an unknown disease and again Helene became a guardian until her youngest son Albert would come of age, which would take place two years later.\n\nIn 1890 Helene became seriously ill. Albert had informed Empress Elisabeth, who came directly to Regensburg. Helene died on May 16, 1890 at seven o’clock in the evening at the age of 56. Helene was buried in the family tomb of the family Thurn und Taxis.\n\nI have written quite a lot about Elisabeth. In short, Elisabeth was chosen by Emperor Franz Joseph as his bride. She did not become very happy. She was murdered on 10 September 1898 by an Italian anarchist in Geneva. If you want to know more, read my blog the Real Sisi.\n\nMarie Sophie Amalie was born on October 4, 1841. When she was 17, she married on February 3, 1859 in Munich with the later Francis II of the Two Sicilies. In the same year, her father-in-law Ferdinand II died and Marie Sophie became Queen of the Two Sicilies. However, her husband abdicated on March 20, 1861. Due to Marie’s unyielding pursuit of her husband’s throne, she acquired the nickname Heroine of Gaeta.\n\nThe marriage between Francis and Marie was far from perfect. In the early sixties, Marie became pregnant … from another man. The father turned out to be a Belgian nobleman, Armand de Lavayss. Marie fled to the parental castle Possenhofen. There she gave birth to a daughter, in the company of her sisters Elisabeth (who had just left Vienna at that time in a marital crisis and also stayed at home) and Mathilde. Immediately after birth she had to hand over the child to her lover. Then she rejoined her husband. In 1869, they had a child together, Maria Christina Pia, who unfortunately died a year later.\n\nMarie Sophie and Francis lived in exile for the rest of their lives. Part of the year in England, in the county of Northamptonshire. In 1878 an argument arose between her sister Elisabeth and Marie about the charms of Captain Bay Middleton. The quarrel was never settled. On December 27, 1894 her husband, ex-King Francis II, suddenly died. It was a difficult period for Marie Sophie. She herself died on January 19, 1925.\n\nMathilde Ludovika in Bavaria was born on September 30, 1843. She spent her childhood at the parental castle of Possenhofen, not far from Munich. She was very attached to her slightly older sister Marie, with whom she undertook a great deal. On 5 June 1861 she married Lodovico, Count of Trani, a younger brother of the King of Naples. Thus Mathilde and Marie spent the first years of their marriage together in Rome. In 1867 she gave birth to her first and only child: Maria Theresia.\n\nThe marriage between Mathilde and the Italian count was far from happy. He was unfaithful to her and had a strong drinking problem. Mathilde therefore tried, as well as her sisters Marie and Elisabeth, to make as many trips as possible. Mathilde was, just like her sisters, a beautiful woman, but so thin and with such a squeaky voice that she was called “Spatz” (sparrow) by her family.\n\nOn 8 June 1886 she became a widow (presumably her husband committed suicide). A few years after Sisi’s death, Elisabeth’s daughter Marie Valerie tried to couple ‘Aunt Spatz’ to Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, which did not work out. During the First World War Mathilde lived in Switzerland, then settled with her sister Marie in Munich. She died shortly after Marie, as the last child in the Max and Ludovika family.\n\nSophie Charlotte Augustine in Bavaria was born on February 22, 1847. After all her brothers and sisters were married, she was the last child to stay at the parental castle Possenhofen.\n\nShe was very friendly with her cousin\n\nLudwig II, who in 1864, would become king of Bavaria. They shared a great love for nature and for the music of Richard Wagner. The couple finally got engaged.\n\nProbably because of fear of commitment, Ludwig always postponed the wedding date. After a few months the engagement was broken. Then Sophie had a brief but apparently intense affair with the trading entrepreneur Edgar Hanfstaengl. He was not considered suitable as a future life partner by her family.\n\nLudovika therefore looked for of a new marriage candidate and found the duke Ferdinand of Alençon-Orléans. Sophie agreed to the marriage proposal, and on 28 September 1868 they married in Possenhofen. The couple moved to England, where the Orléans house lived in exile since the revolution of 1848. There Sophie had many attacks of melancholy. She was longing for home and her former lover, Edgar Hanfstaengl. She wrote him passionate love letters, which, remained unanswered. From 1872 the couple lived again in France, where they moved into a villa in Vincennes.\n\nThe couple had two children:\n\nLouise Victoria (1869 – 1952)\n\nEmmanuel (1872- 1931).\n\nIn 1886, Sophie fell in love with her gynecologist, Dr Glaser. The couple started a relationship and even decided to leave for Switzerland together. This plan was stopped in time. It was decided to have Sophie admitted to a psychiatric clinic near Graz. Sophie spent five months in the clinic, recovered for some time in a castle in Tyrol and then joined her husband again.\n\nSophie eventually died in a heavy fire in the Bazar de la Charité (a charity exhibition in Paris) in 1897, when she insisted that other women should be rescued first.\n\nTo have a clear image of the Sisi’s complete family, click on the image below to see the complete family tree:\n\nDo you want to read more about Sisi and her sisters?\n\nThe Empress Elisabeth of Austria\n\nby Karl Tschuppik, Eric Sutton (translation) (kindle edition)\n\nThis is the english translation of the book written in 1929 about her life.\n\nIf you want to see more images of Sisi’s sisters, have a look at my Pinterest board:\n\nDid you know that Sisi also had five brothers.
