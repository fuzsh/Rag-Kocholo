        "meta_description": "For sale is a extremely rare The Order of Louise (or Luisen-Orden in German) was founded on 3 August 1814 by Frederick William III of Prussia to honor his late wife, the beloved Queen Louise. It was intended strictly for women whose service to Prussia was worthy of such high national recognition. Its dame companion members were limited to 100 in number, and were intended to be drawn from all classes.                        The final photograph shows three of the recipients wearing the order of Louise. From left to right :                   1. Kaiserin Augusta, wearing the Prussian state regalia, and the Order of Louise (on her left shoulder). Portrait by Franz Xavier Winterhalter, ca. 1861.              2. Luise, Prinzessin von Preußen, Grand Duchess of Baden, wearing the Order of Louise. Portrait by Franz Xavier Winterhalter, ca. 1856              3. Maria, Prinzessin von Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, Duchess of Flanders, wearing the Order of Louise                   The Chief of the Order of Louise was the reigning queen. Daughters in the royal family were invested with this order in lieu of the Order of the Black Eagle, Order of the Red Eagle Grand Cross, Prussian Crown Order First Class, and Royal House Order of Hohenzollern that were reserved for the sons.                   The Order of Louise was renewed with each successive monarch. At its initial creation in 1814, the Order was only available in one class. A second class was added during the reign of Wilhelm I.                   The Royal Prussian Louisenorden (also: Luisenorden) was the highest lady's order of the Kingdom of Prussia and was founded on the 3rd August 1814 during the freedom wars against Napoleon I donated by King Friedrich Wilhelm III in memory of his wife Queen Luise, who died in 1810.                   The foundation certificate states:                   When the men of our brave armies bled for the fatherland, they found labsal and relief in the nurturing care of the women. Faith and hope gave the mothers and daughters of our country the strength to satisfy the concern for theirs who fought with the enemy and the pain for the lost through persevering activity for the cause of the fatherland and their essential aid for the great cause were not missed anywhere.\"              The order was renewed in 1850 under King Friedrich Wilhelm IV, in 1865 under Wilhelm I and 1890 under Wilhelm II.                   On the 30th October 1865, King Wilhelm I created the second division of the Order, which was divided into two classes and had smaller, non-enamelled crosses.                   The medal of the originally one-class Louis Order is a black enameled gold cross. In the obverse middle medallion, which was enamelled sky blue, there is the monogram L within a wreath of stars. The reverse of the first model shows the years 1813 - 1814 and after the revolution of 1848 the numbers 1848 - 1849. This second model was only available from 1850 awarded.                   The order was worn in a bow made of white ribbon with black edges on the left chest. Non-Christian bearers received a golden medal instead of the cross with the same center medallion as in the verse of the cross.                   The Jew Amalie Beer received a modified version of the order out of consideration for her religious feelings.                   The number of borrowers who had to have Prussian citizenship was limited to 100.For individual bearers of this order, see Carrier of the Louisen Order.                   The text of the original royal proclamation that created the Order roughly translates as follows:                   When the men of our brave armies bled for the homeland, you found relief in the maintaining care of the women. Faith and hope gave the mothers and daughters of the country the power… for the grand purpose (of the nation).
