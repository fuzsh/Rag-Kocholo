Perhaps mother-in-law would not be so hard on someone who was towing the line in the first place. With Nene, I see more time spent in Vienna, less, if any sympathy with the Hungarians but I don;t think any of this would change the course of the early reign. Austria was bound to lose in Italy and Germany. Only a horse trading realist of a prime minister could have salvaged better outcomes.\n\nSisi: yes she would have been in demand as a Grand Duchess or regional Queen, but what if someone got the bright idea of marrying her off to Napoleon III? I have often thought about this. It would have required that wily prime minister that never was to initiate an about face in Austrian policy regarding France.\n\nBut think of it. Flawless and petulant Sisi throwing shade all over Paris."
