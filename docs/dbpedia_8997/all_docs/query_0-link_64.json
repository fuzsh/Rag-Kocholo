Go here for the latest seasonal science fiction news.\n\n[The other key sections within this seasonal newscast are: Major Headline Links |\n\nNews which contains: Major Science & SF News, People: Major SF Author, Science Writer and Artist News; Film News; SF Book Trade News; TV News; Eurocon/Worldcon News; Fandom & Other News; and Net Watch |\n\nLast Season's Science News Summary including: General Science, Astronomy and Space and Natural Science |\n\nForthcoming Book Releases including: Science Fiction Forthcoming Fantasy & Horror Forthcoming Science Fact and Non-Fiction and Forthcoming TV & Film Tie-ins Book Releases | Selected Recent DVD Releases |\n\nR.I.P | Interface: Science and SF | End Bits.]\n\nSpring 2012\n\nSTAFF MATTERS\n\nAlan and Karen's wedding went well.\n\nJonathan, Karen, Alan and Dan at the reception.\n\nBill  the unsung hero who sorts our 'Futures' PDFs out  and his wife now have a baby son. Our congratulations to the couple.\n\nNadia  one of our book review team  has had a baby daughter. Our congratulations to her and husband Wayne.\n\nFinally  Advance notice that we will have our 25th anniversary this Easter. A quarter of a century already. Shock, horror drama, probe to come.\n\nElsewhere this issue (vol 22 (1) Spring 2012) separate to this page we have:-\n\nan article on Films from the Mummy's Tomb\n\na review of the 2011 SF Worldcon\n\na review of the 2011 British Fantasycon\n\na review of the 2011 Festival of Fantastic Films\n\nour annual look at the coming year's SF convention and film diary\n\n...and many SF/F book reviews. See What's new page.\n\nFantasy and horror book reviewer wanted. SF2 Concatenation not only lists forthcoming British Isles books on its seasonal news pages (like this one) but posts between 50 and 70 stand-alone book reviews a year. Currently we have nearly a thousand stand-alone fiction reviews on the site and last year (2011) these were over 300,000 fiction review downloads by site visitors (a figure that has been growing year-on-year). Alas we do not have enough reviewers on our book review team to review all the titles sent us and so we are looking for an additional reviewer (or possibly two). Specifically we are looking for reviewers willing to review fantasy (both traditional and urban), horror, steam punk and related titles.\n\nReviewers must be based in Britain (so as to keep our post costs down) and have been regular genre readers for a decade or longer. Reviews should be typically between 500 and a thousand words and submitted as a MS Word.doc 2007 or earlier version (not .docx) with publication details as per house style accurately cited at the review's top line (check out a couple of recent reviews from our What's new page. What we do is circulate a list of books (which has the aforesaid publication details) we have to review in January, April and September. Reviewers say how many titles they are prepared to review for the relevant review period and then list the titles they would like to review plus a couple of extra choices (as often some books get selected by more than one reviewer). We then send the reviewers the books. The one thing we are strict on are the seasonal deadlines (March 15th, August 15th and December 15th) as we have a really mad rush at the end of each season collating not just reviews but all the news sent us, coding the site, internal and external link checking and then posting seasonal editions. Naturally book reviewers get to keep the books they review. If you think you have what it takes and wish to share your critical enthusiasm for genre books then feel free to contact us about trial period.\n\nHelp support Concatenation: Get Essential Science Fiction which is also available from Amazon.co.uk. In addition to helping this site it makes a great present and helps you do your bit to spread the genre word. See also news of signed copies from Porcupine Books (who can send you copies cheaper than Amazon...).\n\n[The other key sections within this seasonal newscast are: Major Headline Links |\n\nNews which contains: Major Science & SF News, People: Major SF Author, Science Writer and Artist News; Film News; SF Book Trade News; TV News; Eurocon/Worldcon News; Fandom & Other News; and Net Watch |\n\nLast Season's Science News Summary including: General Science, Astronomy and Space and Natural Science |\n\nForthcoming Book Releases including: Science Fiction Forthcoming Fantasy & Horror Forthcoming Science Fact and Non-Fiction and Forthcoming TV & Film Tie-ins Book Releases | Selected Recent DVD Releases |\n\nR.I.P | Interface: Science and SF | End Bits.]\n\nSpring 2012\n\nMAJOR HEADLINE LINKS\n\nThe Best SF books, SF films and genre television of 2011.

Not aware that there are films other than Hollywood kids' or comics related films? Our short video clip links section this season includes, among others, links to a range of 2011 genre film trailers that you may just want to at least check out before you nominate for this year's Hugos.  See the section here and also we remind you that there is a separate short selection of best films below.\n\nScience news of the past season included that: the space-time continuum is smooth (and not a foam); the space-time continuum is smooth (but still a foam); the stone-age began earlier than thought; Britain's politicians lied about UK science funding; there really is free water on Mars (note: free standing water); the Black Death genome has been sequenced revealing history; a new test for Downs syndrome; a quarter of World's farmland is now degraded; the current global amphibian extinction is set to increase; and why stop being lard-arses spurred our human evolution... and of course there is Higgs boson and exo-planet news that you will have already picked up on from the mainstream media.\n\nScience-and-SF news of the past season included that: the Moon's inhabitants speak French said biologist Richard Dawkins; TV series Firefly quotes land university lecture in trouble with jobs-worth administration; spontaneous human combustion is now legal; and the Yanks are developing a tractor beam.\n\nNotable SF books due out in the run up to Easter 2012 include: The Stainless Steel Rat Returns (reprint) by Harry Harrison, Demi Monde: Spring by Rod Rees, and Blue Remembered Earth by Alastair Reynolds.

Yes, it is the start of a new year and so time for an informal look back at the last one. Here are a few of the books that we rated published in the British Isles last year (obviously there are other worthy offerings as well as titles published elsewhere which also include some of these). We have a varied mix for you so there should be something for everyone. So if you are looking for something to read then why not check out these Science Fiction books of 2011:-\n\nFinal Days by Gary Gibson.\n\nPax Brittania: Anno Frankenstein by Jonathan Green.\n\nEmbassytown by China Miéville\n\nThe Map of Time by Felix J. Palma\n\nThe Islanders by Christopher Priest\n\nQuantum Gravity Book 5: Down to the Bone by Justina Robson\n\n(and sadly not eligible, as it came out the previous year (2010), but rated by team members (until we checked the publication date) was Johannes Cabal The Detective by Jonathan L. Howard  which we mention in case you missed it the previous year.\n\nOn the fantasy and horror front in 2011 released in the British Isles (and possibly elsewhere) there was:-\n\nRivers of London a.k.a. Midnight Riots (N. American title) by Ben Aaronvitch\n\nVampire Empire: Book Two: The Rift Walker by Clay Griffith & Susan Griffith\n\nQueen of Kings by Maria Dahvana Headley\n\nTongues of Serpents by Naomi Novik\n\nBlack Halo by Sam Sykes\n\nBest Science Fiction (and Sci Fi) films (movies) of 2011. Well, there has been the usual debate as to our informal consideration for better or worse. We have as customary a varied mix (sci fi, SF, space opera, fantasy and horror) for you so there should be something in this, best of science fiction films 2011 selection, for everyone:-\n\nAtlantis Down. An Italian-US co-production. A retired space shuttle is brought back into service and then in mid-mission the ship's crew is transported somewhere... See the trailer here.\n\nBeyond the Black Rainbow . This Italian/Canadian choice of ours may or may not be to your taste: most people either love it or hate it. The film is more a visual experience (think of Kubrick and Tarkovsky). A young woman is imprisoned in an experimental zone... See the trailer here.\n\nContagion. A super-flu epidemic breaks out. As this is a Hollywood blockbuster it is likely to be a candidate for the Hugo short-list without further preamble.\n\nThe Dark Fields a.k.a Limitless. Though Hollywood this one may have escaped your attention. A writer is given a drug that enables his brain to reach its full potential... But is this something you would really want? See the trailer here.\n\nThe Gerber Syndrome. An Italian production following the outbreak of an epidemic that ultimately makes people mad. See the trailer here.\n\nPerfect Sense. A BBC production. A love story with an SFnal backdrop: across the world people are losing their senses (taste, balance, hearing, hunger, touch, sight...) one by one. See the trailer here.\n\nRise of the Apes. Hollywood again. A worthy re-boot of the franchise.\n\nSource Code. An SF thriller and a Hollywood offering but from the director that brought us the independent and previous Hugo winner Moon.\n\n+++ Also here below are more links to 2011 SF films trailers from around the world whose DVD, now a few months have passed, you may be able to pick up in your own country.\n\nAs for short-form media (effectively TV) SF and offerings under 90 minutes, the Hugo voters will no doubt go for Dr Who in what has in recent years effectively in all but name become the Dr Who Hugo category. This is not a function of the Hugo's purpose of reflecting SFnal excellence rather than the Hugo rules mean you vote for an episode (not the series) and so many Dr Who fans vote at the Worldcon for so many episodes that almost everything else gets squeezed out. (Would that the TV series only count for the Hugo nomination and then the episode that gets the most votes be the one put on the ballot. That way Hugo voters would be able to choose the best episode of the different series on the ballot.) So if recent year's Hugo-voting practice is anything to go by then a few Who episodes will be short-listed and here our betting is that Neil Gaiman's episode  'The Doctor's Wife'  will be the one that wins.\n\nAnyway, if you do feel like voting for something different then the year's worthy-of-consideration productions (out of many offerings) include:-\n\nBig Bang Theory (Season 4). More science and SF comedy with this charming N. American series about researchers and their attractive non-science mundane neighbour. A safe bet for most of our regulars to be able to view this as this is shown on both sides of the Pond. If you have not seen it then here are some season 3 highlights (including how come they have always been unable to use the lift).\n\nBlack Mirror. This was a short run of three SFnal films. The second in the series was called 15 Million Merits and could have been based on a Golden Age SF short story. It concerned a future in which most workers pedal-sports bikes to generate energy for their high-tech city. The only way for many to escape this life of drudgery is to enter a talent show... See the trailer here. The final episode was called The Entire History Of You. What would happen if you had a perfect memory? See the trailer here.\n\nMisfits (Season 3) Is in effect the British take on the Heroes premise of individuals gaining super-powers but dark, gritty, sassy and street wise. Seasons 1 and 2 (2009 and 2010) were stunningly brilliant and radically different to Heroes even though the theme explored is the same. See the first season introductory trailer here and the DVD is now out.\n\nNominations for 2012 Hugo Awards are now open. For details see our Eurocon/Worldcon news subsection below. Vote, and vote wisely.\n\nThe 2011 Nobel Prizes for science have been announced. The science category wins were:-\n\nPhysics: Saul Perlmutter and Adam Riess of the US and Brian Schmidt of Australia. For their work on Type 1a supernovae, determining that more distant objects seem to move faster, hence the Universe is expanding faster and faster.\n\nChemistry: Dr Shechtman (Israel) for determining the structure of quasi-crystals.\n\nMedicine: Bruce Beutler (US), Jules Hoffmann (France) and the late Ralph Steinman. Profs Beutler and Hoffman discovered how the body's first line of defence was activated. Prof Steinman discovered the dendritic cell, which helps defeat infection.\n\nSee also last year's 2010 Nobel Prizes.\n\nNobel rule preventing award presentation posthumously is excepted for 2011. See the obituary comment for Ralph Steinman below.\n\nThe 2011 Royal Society Charles 2nd Award goes to China's premiere Wen Jiabao. Since taking office in 2003, Premier Wen has overseen one of the most ambitious programmes of national research investment. Science and technology have been placed at the heart of China's planning and national development and it is recognised as a common value through school and university education. The King Charles II medal is awarded to foreign Heads of State or Government who have made an outstanding contribution to furthering scientific research in their country. Wen has a professional background in geology and engineering.\n\nThe 2011 Royal Society Michael Faraday prize has been awarded to Colin Pillinger. Professor Pillinger is probably best-known for leading the Beagle 2 project to land a British-built spacecraft on Mars in 2003. What is less known is that, while Beagle 2 was a failure, some of the technological spin-offs have been promising. For example the miniaturisation of the mass spectrometer has diagnostic potential by doctors in their practices. (Currently doctors have to send off samples to a lab.) The Michael Faraday Prize is awarded annually a scientist or engineer whose expertise in communicating scientific ideas in lay terms is judged exemplary.\n\nThe 2011 British Fantasy Awards were presented at Fantasycon. The winners were:-\n\nBest Novel (August Derleth Fantasy Award): Demon Dance by Sam Stone (The House Of Murky Depths)  Award subsequently declined\n\nBest Novella: 'Humpty's Bones' by Simon Clark (Telos)\n\nBest Short Story: 'Fool's Gold' by Sam Stone (in The Bitten Word edited by Ian Whates/ Newcon Press)\n\nBest Collection: Full Dark, No Stars by Stephen King (Hodder & Stoughton)\n\nBest Anthology: Back from the Dead: The Legacy of the Pan Book of Horror Stories edited by Johnny Mains (Noose & Gibbet)\n\nBest Non-Fiction: Altered Visions: The Art of Vincent Chong (Telos)\n\nBest Artist: Vincent Chong\n\nBest Small Press: Telos Publishing\n\nBest Magazine/Periodical: Black Static (Andy Cox (Ed.)/TTA Press)\n\nBest Comic/Graphic Novel: At the Mountains of Madness by Ian Culbard (Self Made Hero)\n\nBest Film: Inception (Christopher Nolan/Syncopy Films)\n\nBest Television: Sherlock (Steven Moffat/BBC)\n\nKarl Edward Wagner Special Award: Terry Pratchett\n\nSydney J.

(The Francophone winners were previously announced in May in Montreal.) The principal category wins for the Anglophone Auroras were:-\n\nBest Novel: WWW: Watch by Robert J. Sawyer\n\nBest Graphic Novel: Goblins by Tarol Hunt\n\nBest Related Work: The Dragon and the Stars edited by Derwin Mak and Eric Choi\n\nBest Artist: Erik Mohr\n\nGermany's Curt Siodmak Prize (visual) and the German SF Prize (written) were awarded at Buchmessecon (BuCon):-\n\nCurt Siodmak - Film: Inception (that also recently won Hugo and a Nebula)\n\nCurt Siodmak - TV: Battlestar Galactica\n\nGerman SF Club Prize - Novel: Orte der Erinnerung [Places of Memory] by Uwe Post\n\nGerman SF Club Prize - Short story: 'Walpar Tonnraffir und der Zeigefinger Gottes' ['Walpar Tonnraffir and God's finger'] by Wolfgang Jeschke\n\nThe German SF Club Prize is a juried award from the German SF Society (Club) SFCD.

The principal category wins were:-\n\nBest Novel: Crónicas del Multiverso [Chronicles from the Multiverse] by Victor Conde\n\nBest Novella: La Mirada de Pegaso' ['The Glance of the Pegasus'] by Sergio Mars\n\nBest Anthology: : La Mirada de Pegaso [The Glance of the Pegasus] by Sergio Mars\n\nBest Nonfiction Book: Teoría de la Literatura de Ciencia Ficción [The Theory and Literature of Science Fiction] by Fernando Ángel Moreno\n\nBest Audiovisual Production: A Través del Espejo [Through the Mirror] by Alfonso Merelo and Elia Hernández (radio)\n\nBest Magazine: Imaginarios [Imaginations] from the Federación Española de Fantasía Épica (Spanish Federation for Epic Fantasy)\n\nBest Foreign Novel: Nación [Nation] by Terry Practhett\n\nBest Website: La Tercera Fundación [The Third Foundation]\n\nAlso presented was the...\n\nDomingo Santos Award: Astronauta en la Playa [Astronaut on the Beach] by Ramón San Miguel\n\nDomingo Santos is a well known Spanish SF author who also co-founded the magazine Nueva Dimensión [New Dimensions].

Another Earth saw Brit Marling get a 'Best Actress' award.\n\nThe Big Zilant was awarded at the 21st International Festival of Fantasy, Zilantkon, in Kazan in November. The Russian Federation's Worldcon-sized event but with a purely fantasy (non-SF) focus. This year's Big Zilant went to Maria Galina for her book Small Hamsters of Egladore.\n\nThe Utopiales and other Awards were presented at this year's Utopiales in Nantes, France. (an event that is a big as Worldcon):-\n\nLiterature\n\nPrix Utopiales Européen (Novel): Rêves de Gloire [Dreams of Glory] by Roland C.

Entrants must be over 18, have no previous published full-length works of fiction and live in the UK, Ireland or the Commonwealth. Submissions should be emailed to: pratchettprize[-at-]transworld-publishers.co.uk.\n\nPhilip K. Dick family suing makers of The Adjustment Bureau film. It is a complicated affair which, to cut very short, turns on the following. Dicks original story was published in a science fiction magazine in 1954. However, Dicks estate claims that this was done without Dicks knowledge or consent, making it invalid. The first official printing, the estate argues, of Dicks material was in a 1973 short story collection. The estate has already had a total of over US$1.5 million (£1 million) but, if it owns copyright, is owed a further US$500,000 (£330,000). The estate's lawyer is also reported as saying that up to the film's launch, the film makers (Media Rights Capital) accepted the estate's view of the story's copyright status as this was in the contracts and copyright reviews covered as part of the acquisition.\n\nAsimov's The Caves of Steel being adapted for a film. 20th Century Fox is looking to make a film version of Isaac Asimov's 1953 classic novel. The story concerns the solving of a murder case of an off-world colony ambassador to the over crowded Earth. The detectives solving the crime are a human (Elijah Bailey) and a humanoid robot (R. Daneel Olivaw). Elijah is not too enamoured with robots let alone the idea of working with one.\n\nMore SF/F film news in the SF film news subsection lower down.\n\nAsterix The Gaul's future assured says Albert Uderzo when accepting award. Uderzo took over the writing for the comic book after the death of Goscinny in 1977, even though many feel his stories were up to Goscinny's standard. He has now decided to pass on the baton. \"I've decided there should be some continuity, and I want it [Asterix's saga] to carry on for generations and generations.\" To this end he announced that he has had an artist working with him for some time and that this new artist will produce more adventures. The first of this is slated to be released at the end of 2012. Meanwhile there will be a new live action Asterix film in 2012 starring Edouard Baer as Asterix and Gerard Depardieu as Obelix. It will be based on Asterix in Britain and is called Asterix and Obelix: On Her Majesty's Service (God Save Britannia).\n\nSuperman #1 comic sells for record-breaking US$2.2 million (£1.4m). The pristine copy of Action Comics no. 1 dates from June 1938 and was Superman's first outing. Two years ago, spring 2010, an issue sold for US$1m (£646,000).\n\nNew York Review of Science Fiction is to cease being a mainly-print magazine after July (2012). After then it will primarily be in PDF format that may be e-mailed to subscribers, or they may decide not to have subscribers and just make each issue available on-line, either for a nominal charge or for free. They also say that they will almost certainly also offer a print-on-demand option as well. All this came about because their long-time printer, Odyssey Press, was sold in October (2010), after they had sent the November issue layouts to them. Odyssey did not print it, because by the time it was prepared they had run entirely out of paper, and so they sent the job to the new owner in Pennsylvania. They did ultimately print it, late in November, but did not mail it until 2nd December. Thus the New York Review of Science Fiction missed a calendar month for the first time in its 23-year history.\n\nMurky depths, the British magazine of SF short stories, has closed. The last issue was no. 18. Despite having some critical acclaim (apart from a few rival small press deprecating comments), good production presentation, and some great artwork, circulation levels were never high enough to cover the magazine's production costs: starting in 2007 just before the recession did not help. According to its website, the newsagent chain W. H. Smiths refused to stock it in the UK because of its 'extreme explicit content'. This in itself is a sign of Murky depths' worthiness. Still, all is not lost as the publishers, 'the House of Murky Depths', will continue publishing graphic novels and paperbacks. www.murkydepths.com.\n\nRealms of Fantasy finally(?) closes. Despite repeated attempts to keep it going, the October 2011 issue was the last. The magazine has continually made a loss over the past year, and then previously under its original owners. The magazine was originally founded in 1994.\n\nBid to bring Amazing Stories back. Amazing Stories died back in 2006. By 2007, Hasbro had abandoned the trademark. Steve Davidson, who was managing the intellectual property department of an R&D firm at the time, routinely reviewed the status of some favourite marks. Noting the lapse for Amazing Stories, he filed an application for the Mark in 2008. Now Steve Davidson has acquired the trademarks for Amazing Stories and announced the creation of an Editorial Advisory Board to assist in the re-launch of the world's first dedicated science fiction magazine originally launched in 1926. Serving on the board in a voluntary capacity are four former editors of Amazing Stories - Barry Malzberg, Patrick L. Price, Robert Silverberg, Ted White and Joseph Wrzos (who edited under the pen name Joseph Ross). Their former tenures as editors of Amazing Stories spans nearly three decades. At its peak Amazing's circulation reached 100,000 but by the year 2000 had slumped to 10,000 when it first folded. See www.amazingstoriesmag.com.\n\nHow to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe has been turned into a stage play. It saw an autumnal run in Columbus, Ohio, US, at the Available Light Theatre. The play was directed by Matt Slaybaugh and adapted him and Jennifer Fawcett. Let's hope someone puts it on in BritCit.\n\n2000AD's 35th anniversary. Yes, its 2012 and Britain's No. 1 SF comic  indeed some say 'the Galaxy's greatest comic', 2000AD is 35 years old this year. (Yup, 10 years older than SF2 Concatenation.) 2000AD was launched in 1977 by IPC along with another SFnal title, Star Lord. The premiere strip was Judge Dredd law enforcer of the future which quickly developed a rounded character who despite recognising the fundamental benefit of the law begun to question the wisdom of some laws. Then we had the long-running readers' debate as to who should star in the then forthcoming Judge Dredd film. We readers wanted Clint Eastwood: we got Sylvester Stallone. A couple of years after its launch 2000AD merged with Star Lord and so 2000AD got Ro-Busters (a kind of robotic Thunderbirds) which in turn subsequently begat The ABC Warriors, as well as Strontium Dog mutant interstellar bounty hunter of criminals, whose alien medic, the Gronk, that so captured readers affection that he became the official (authorised by Tharg) mascot of Hertfordshire University (formerly Hatfield Polytechnic) SF Society PSIFA and also Cambridge University SF Society. Today 2000AD is now owned by Rebellion (a games firm who also recently acquired the SF book publisher Solaris) and is still going strong as a full colour weekly. There is also the monthly Judge Dredd Megazine that for the past couple of years comes bagged with a small graphic novel of compiled earlier 2000AD strips: so this is the place for newcomers to go and well worth the £72 a year Megazine subscription (that's about US$120 plus added overseas shipping if you are foreign) e-mail subscriptions[-at-]2000AD.com substituting [-at-] with @ for details.

The now 81 year-old was testifying at a Congressional hearing that NASA is a national disgrace. His age means that he has no career to lose. The US space program is \"embarrassing and unacceptable,\" he said. \"We will have no American access to, and return from, low Earth orbit and the International Space Station for an unpredictable length of time in the future,\" he said. \"For a country that has invested so much for so long to achieve a leadership position in space exploration and exploitation, this condition is viewed by many as lamentably embarrassing and unacceptable.\" Armstrong reminded the House committee of Winston Churchill's famous saying that Americans will always do the right thing, but only after they have exhausted all the alternatives. \"In space flight,\" Armstrong said, \"we are in the process of exhausting alternatives. I am hopeful that, in the near future, we will be doing the right thing.\"\n\nMargaret Atwood's non-fiction SF book, In Other Worlds, has a commemorative special edition of 300 copies printed on Second Harvest paper. This is a publishing-grade material manufactured from 36% straw and 64% recycled paper. The paper was developed by Canadian environmental group Canopy costing Can$100 (£62). +++ She was also on BBC's Radio 4's Open Book programme in which she talked of her defining 'speculative fiction' as fiction that may have exotic science but it could happen, whereas 'science fiction' was based on unrealistic fantastical science Comment: would help if she used terms the way the rest of us do and checked Clute's SF Encyclopaedia or Jeff Prucher's Brave New Words: The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction. She not only has re-defined 'speculative fiction' listed on both those works, she uses it the way the term 'mundane SF' (or 'mundane science fiction') has been used in recent years.\n\nIain Banks was on BBC Radio 4's Book Club discussing his non-SF novel The Wasp Factory. One member of the audience asked whether the humour was meant to be laugh out loud? Iain said that he was surprised that when the book came out 27 years ago that some reviewers had not realised that the novel was intentionally in part a black comedy. The interviewer asked Iain whether he had ever been psychoanalysed. Iain replied that he did not think he needed it as he considered himself to be well balanced and a nice chap. He would never seek to be psychoanalysed in case he discovered that the well-spring of part of his creativity was due to part of his psyche and that discovering this might jinx his writing.\n\nGreg Benford's website has had a makeover. See www.gregorybenford.com.\n\nBernard Cribbins has received an OBE for services to drama. His genre contributions have included providing the voices for Uncle Bulgaria, Tobermory and Orinoco in the 1970s series The Wombles. He also played a policeman who accompanied Dr Who in the second Doctor Who film Daleks - Invasion Earth 2150 AD and was Wilfred Mott in the Doctor Who Christmas television special, 'Voyage of the Damned'; he then reprised thee character throughout the 2008 series as the grandfather of companion Donna Noble.. He is the only actor to have faced the daleks in both television and cinema. He also appeared in two episodes of The Avengers as well as one of Space 1999. His non-genre contributions include roles in three 'Carry on ' films. There was an on-line campaign complaining that he should not have received the OBE but a Knighthood.\n\nRichard Dawkins biologist, revealed that he had considered the Moon's inhabitants to speak French! Richard Dawkins told Andrew Marr on BBC Radio 4's Start The Week that when a youngster he had written a book about a dog going to the Moon, but had the sense to realise that the Moon's inhabitants would not speak English, so he had them speak French! Andrew Marr replied that you can't get more alien than that. The programme's theme that week was on 'reality'. Dawkins' other SFnal contribution was that SF authors were often 'lazy' in their portrayal of aliens. This is a view with which SF2 Concatenation's two resident biologists have some sympathy. Nonetheless, that's Dawkins telling the likes of Ballantyne, Banks, Clement, Egan, Niven, Reynolds, and Sawyer Or was Richard only referring to pulp as well as soft SF writers?\n\nHarlan Ellison tried to sue the makers of In Time SF film starring Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried, claiming it borrows from a prize-winning short story he published in 1965. Ellison argued that In Time, which is written and directed by Andrew Niccol, the Oscar-nominated screenwriter of The Truman Show and director of GATTACA, borrowed substantially from his story 'Repent, Harlequin! Said the Ticktockman'. Both stories feature control of the population's individuals' lifespans and both have enforcers called 'Timekeepers'. 'Repent, Harlequin! Said the Ticktockman' won both the 1966 Hugo and Nebula Awards for 'Best Short Story'. Harlan and the studios are covering their own costs. Why did Harlan drop the case? Nobody is sure but maybe it is because that whilst the film has some common elements (and so could be said to have been loosely inspired by Harlan's story) it is substantively different. +++ Harlan is known for vigorously protecting his rights and we last reported him suing to recover dues owed from the Star Trek TV series and earlier still for speaking out on film companies not paying authors for work on DVD extras. Among other litigious escapades and high jinks, Ellison sued regarding Cameron's The Terminator, citing that it was based on two episodes he wrote \"The Outer Limits.\" Orion Pictures and the production company settled out of court for an undisclosed amount and added an 'acknowledgement' of Ellison's work at the film's end. Cameron opposed the whole settlement, stating that the author's claim was a \"nuisance suit\" and that Ellison was a \"parasite who can kiss my a--.\"\n\nNeil Gaiman was on Fox TV's The Late, Late Show Craig Ferguson (who is Scottish) with wife Amanda Palmer singing a song with her group. He revealed how when he has too much scotch in Scotland he slips into a Scottish accent. He was on the show in part due to his November appearance on The Simpsons.\n\nGeorge R. R. Martin has had sold over a million Kindle E-books according to Amazon. He is the eleventh author to sell over a million Kindle copies, joining writers including genre writer Charlaine Harris. Martin's most recent novel in his 'A Song of Ice and Fire' series, A Dance with Dragons\". He has recently reached an even wider audience with the TV series Game of Thrones (that Salman Rushdie hates).\n\nLeonard Nimoy made his (apparently) final convention appearance at (controversially for some) Creation Star Trek con. A surprise video was screened. It had been assembled by Creation Entertainment (generally welcomed by all) featuring the seven of the main stars of Star Trek (2009) and director J. J. Abrams, sharing memories and good wishes to their co-star. Leonard Nimoy has been a regular guest on the ST con circuit...

Suggested wording is on the author's site at his Frederick Pohl's birthday wish for America post.\n\nTerry Pratchett is suing Paul Bamborough and Camel Productions, who had an option on film rights for the novel Mort. Terry's case is that the rights ran out and is seeking a legal declaration to that effect so that another company can make the film. +++ Terry revealed, on BBC Radio 4, that the title of his latest book, Snuff, had nothing to do with his campaign over euthanasia rights. +++ Snuff sales' success reported in book sub-section below.\n\nHannu Rajaniemi dubut novel's success is on-going. In addition to previous foreign rights sales, he has had the rights to the Quantum Thief Trilogy sold to Japan.\n\nSalman Rushdie, mainstream author popular with litcrits, has damned the TV series of George R. R. Martin's Game of Thrones. Rushdie was researching fantasy on TV for his own forthcoming project when he came across the HBO's Emmy-winning series Game of Thrones. he said on hareetz.com: \"There was a series called Game of Thrones which was very popular here in the United States, a post-Tolkien kind of thing. It was garbage, yet very addictive garbage  because there's lots of violence, all the women take their clothes off all the time, and it's kind of fun. In the end, it's well-produced trash, but there's room for that, too.\"\n\nBrent Spinner was interviewed by uktheatre.net at the October Star Trek con in Chicago (US) when he was interrupted by two teenagers who wanted to ask what would Data eat at McDonald's. Thrown by the combination of rudeness of an interruption of an interview recording and the inanity of the question, Brent spent part of the rest of the interview noting that Star Trek's future vision was over-idealised by the show's addicts. As to Brent's answer to the children's question: \"This is the stupidest thing anyone has ever asked me. The single dumbest thing anyones ever said. Would Data eat at McDonalds? Data wouldnt be so stupid to eat at McDonalds. Data would go, ''I want something nutritious. I dont wanna kill myself, I wanna live, right?'\" All of which goes to show that Brent has some knowledge of nutrition, and possibly reasonable taste...\n\nAlbert Uderzo, the artist behind the fantasy, juvenile graphic novel Asterix the Gaul, announces his retirement when receiving a trophy (along with daughter the former Asterix story writer Rene Goscinny) to mark the sale of 350 million copies of Asterix adventures worldwide.

As we have previously reported, there has been speculation that Prometheus is an alien prequel. Well it was hinted in the Alien films that the Nostromo was set up to encounter the extraterrestrial SOS and to return a sample (hence the android Ash was onboard with a mission). Now, the trailer has been released. It features many ultra-short (1 to 2 second) clips including of the first extraterrestrial alien victim ship. There are shots of a female astronaut character who effectively fulfils the same role as Ripley and we get the character who played the android in the Alien series turning up. It looks good. The film will be out in August.\n\nRidley Scott says his new Blade Runner film will be a sequel. So, not going for the obvious option then you cunning fox Ridley. None of the original cast will be involved Scott added.\n\nMajor Spanish SF novel to be a film. Mecanoscrit del Segon Origen by Manuel de Pedrolo will be director Bigas Luna's next film. This important novel was first published in 1974, and became the most broadly disseminated Catalan fiction book. It is the story of two children from a little country village in Catalonia called Benaura. Alba, a fourteen-year-old girl, and Dídac, a black nine-year-old boy, become the only two remaining humans on Earth after they accidentally survive an alien holocaust that eradicates all mammal life on the planet. They decide to set about preserving human culture and repopulating the Earth.\n\nFilm option for Adam Nevills horror novel The Ritual. Stillking Films have optioned The Ritual which was published in Britain in 2011 by Macmillan, it will also be published in the U.S. by St Martins Press in 2012. The novel is a contemporary horror tale that follows four men hiking in the northern European forests and the hellish things they stumble across there The deal was brokered by the Gotham Group in Los Angeles, representing the John Jarrold Literary Agency. Stillking Films have produced many major films including Casino Royale, The Illusionist, From Hell and The Bourne Identity.\n\nFilm option for Charles Yu's novel How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe. Chris Columbus has bought the rights along with Michael Barnathan and Mark Radcliff. Furthermore it looks like they have signed on Brendan Bellomo to direct. The novel was a Time Magazine Top 10 Fiction Books of 2010 and it also made the New York Times 100 Notable Books of 2010 list.\n\nDr Who film, BBC set to ruin it before production starts... but then came the cry 'what Dr Who film?' Apparently the BBC was meant to be looking to David Yates to direct a new Dr Who film. Fair enough (but note the 'apparently' which we will come back to later). What is not fair enough is that news in Variety magazine was that they were looking for writers... Which if it had been true meant that they are ignoring using either Steven Moffat or Russell T. Davies. According to this rumour-mongering source, Dr Who \"needs quite a radical transformation to take it into the bigger arena\". What! Why? If it ain't broke then don't fix it. Dr Who's latest venture to the big screen could well have ended up a flop as were other TV-to-big-screen adaptations, such as Thunderbirds and The Avengers films, that departed greatly from their British TV roots. Will they never learn?! (What would have been wrong with a Moffat and Neil Gaiman team up?)... Fortunately all this is 'apparently' as Steven Moffat has dismissed rumours of a Doctor Who film coming soon, despite Variety magazine reportage and comments from director David Yates, claims of him to be in the adaptation driving seat.\n\nStar Wars Blu-ray sale make global record. One week following the box set launch Star Wars: The Complete Saga\"on Blu-ray has already set global sales records. Lucasfilm and Twentieth Century Fox have so far sold one million units of the Blu-ray box set, which launched on 16th September, including 515,000 units in North America alone. With that many unit sales, according to the film studios, Star Wars is now the \"bestselling catalogue Blu-ray disc of all time.\" In addition, the Star Wars Blu-ray set generated US$84 million (£54m) in worldwide revenue in the past week, including US$38 million (£24.5) in North America. The box set comes with a load of extras including hard copy photographs.\n\nBanned horror film gets reprieve but has to have cuts. Only 12 films have ever been banned by the British Board of Film Classification since it was set up in 1912. (The Japanese horror The Grotesque was the last in 2009.) The Human Centipede 2 had been denied a rating in the summer due to sexual violence and graphic gore, but then in October was rated 18 after its distributor agreed to 32 cuts. A sequel to 2009's The Human Centipede, the film concerns a man who, inspired by the first film, attempts to replicate its bizarre people-grafting experiments. Two minutes and 37 seconds have been removed ahead of its DVD release.\n\nContagion US box office hit in three days of its September US release. It took US$23.1m (£14.5m) in its first three days of release said Warner Brothers. The film concerns the outbreak of a global SARS-like pandemic.\n\nTintin: The Secret of the Unicorn top of British Isles charts for two weeks. This despite the release of Justin Timberlake's In Time. On its second weekend of release, the Steven Spielberg Tintin CGI animation made £2.19m in UK and Ireland box offices. The previous week it topped the British Isles box office, debuting at number one with takings of £6.7 million.\n\nBollywood superhero film Ra One copyright tussle. Actor Shah Rukh Khan has been ordered to pay a deposit of US$200,000 (£125,686) to an Indian court in order to secure release of his latest film. The actor and his production company have been accused of breaching copyright by TV scriptwriter Yash Patnaik who says he came up with the concept, and should receive 10% of the film's profits. The film, the most expensive Bollywood production to date, has already suffered delays due to its extensive special effects and 3D production.\n\nCowboys & Aliens sued by comic creator. Stephen Busti created the comic strip 'Cowboys and Aliens' in Bizarre Fantasy #1 in 1994. The following year Busti's story was highlighted in Comic Shop News and on the same page there was another story about Scott Mitchell Rosenberg of Platinum Studios. Another year passes and in 1997 Platinum Studios produced a Cowboys & Aliens poster in 1997 and sold the rights to the property to Universal and Dreamworks. The Cowboys & Aliens film came out last year and took over US$100 million at the box office before the DVD came out. And now Stephen Busti wants his share.\n\nGhost Rider writer loses case for rights and share of film revenue. The rights to Marvel Comics hero 'Ghost Rider'  created in 1972 but since played by Nicolas Cage in two films - belong to the firm and not the writer, Gary Friedrich, a New York judge has ruled. The case had been running for four years. Gary Friedrich had apparently signed an agreement with Marvel in 1978 relinquishing rights in exchange for more future freelance work. Gary Friedrich says he will appeal.\n\nShort video clips that might tickle your fancy .\n\nCalling Hugo Award 'Best Dramatic Presentation' nominators.

The below are a varied selection from around the world so hopefully there will be at least something for everyone\n\nFilm clip download tip!: Perfect Sense. A love story set against an SFnal riff. A chef and a scientist become drawn together as an epidemic begins to rob people of their sensory perceptions. This BBC Film is a collaborative British, Swedish, German and Danish production starring Ewan McGregor, Eva Green and Connie Nielsen, and directed by David Mackenzie.  See the trailer here.\n\nFilm clip download tip!: The Rift. The extraterrestrials were watching us. What are they? Nobody knows. Earlier a Russian physicist started to study a phenomenon of recent decades. Then in 1982 he found an answer but before he could tell anyone he vanished. 30 years on, in Newell Iowa, Dean Hollister seems to be a normal person until strange radar anomalies appear throughout the world. All of a sudden something starts to happen at the sky, black rifts appear. Behind those rifts something is moving... This is a SwissUSA production that first came out in 2011 but is slated (hopefully) for a broader release this year.  See the trailer here.\n\nFilm clip download tip!: The Divide. This German, Canadian and US production is an apocalyptic thriller that comes with the tag line 'To survive the end of the world you must first survive each other'..  See the trailer here.\n\nFilm clip download tip!: Phase 7. This Argentinean production is set in the near future when the authorities have decided that drastic measures are needed to curb the population.  See the trailer here.\n\nFilm clip download tip!: Another Earth. This purely US production comes from 20th Century Fox, which shows that they still can make genre offerings a cut above average. In the not too distant future a planet appears in the Earth's skies: it is another Earth. On Earth 2 events have taken a slightly different path to that on the (original) Earth and it is possible to visit those there  See the trailer here.\n\nFilm clip download tip!: Thelomeris: City of Time. As you know there has been a boom in steampunk novels of the three years. This is a rather neat Hungarian steam-punk offering whose only US influence seems to be Mark Hamill as one of the stars and the story's 'creative script consultant' (only) to director Hungarian Balázs Hatvani's story vision. Good photography. Also stars György Dörner, József Kerekes and Ottó Viczián.  See the trailer here.\n\nFilm clip download tip!: Re-Kill. As you know the boom in post apocalyptic zombie novels of the past three years has translated into a similar boom of cinematic offerings: though, of course, this sub-genre is long-lived and never really died. The twist (as such) with this 2011 US production is that it has the army involved. To match things up against the military, the zombies are more energetic than the usual Romero ones and the story picks up five years into the battle to save the planet.  See the trailer here.\n\nFilm clip download tip!: Behemoth. Actually this is more standard fare, but if you like big monsters, or even really BIG monsters, and B-type films then this Canadian jobbie might just take your fancy? Underneath some mountains there may lurk a sleeping giant creature of Mayan legend best not disturbed  See the trailer here.\n\nFilm clip download tip!: Surya's 7am Arivu Official Trailer. This film is clearly Bollywood influenced but it is SF involving GM humans in an action romp. Its Bollywood influence is because this is a Tamil film. (Tamils being natives of Sri Lanka (Ceylon).) Its due out shortly.  See the trailer here.\n\nAnd coming up in 2012...\n\nFilm clip download tip!: Darkest Hour. This is a US and Russian action SF offering, though the film's perspective is refreshingly Russian (all too often the aliens seem bent on taking over the US). Life is normal in Moscow and then all over the world lights start dropping from the sky. It is an alien invasion. One problem! We have difficulty seeing them.  See the trailer here.\n\nFilm clip download tip!: Chronicle. This Anglo-American production concerns a group of teenagers who develop super powers. Alas the powers look like growing to become too much to handle.  See the trailer here.\n\nMeanwhile here are some non-trailer links to short vids of SFnal interest\n\nFilm clip download tip!: Nobody Watches the Watchmen -- Rorschach vs. Alan Moore!. This short video is a tribute to The Watchmen. So what did the young journalist read in Rorschach's journal. Could the mastermind behind the death of the director of the proposed Watchman film sequel be none other than Alan Moore!  See the five-and-a-half minute film video here.\n\nFilm clip download tip!: 'War of the Worlds' - Ray Harryhausen Martian test footage. Apparently Ray Harryhausen was up for doing some of the models and effects in the George Pal 1953 film of H. G. wells' novel. This is a short, silent, test footage clip.  See the clip here.\n\nFilm clip download tip!: Ray Bradbury interview, a half-hour interview from the Day at Night TV chat show archive.  See the clip here.\n\nFilm clip download tip!: Leonard Nimoy's and his welcome and initial words at his (apparently) last Trek convention appearance (click here) and one of his closing remarks as to who is Leonard Nimoy (click here). +++ And a clip from The Big Bang Theory when Sheldon gets a Leonard Nimoy related present from Penny.\n\nFilm clip download tip!: Daleks 'exterminate' across all Dr Who series to 2010 in 9 minutes of shouty threats.  See the clip here.\n\nWant more?

Snuff sold 31,904 copies in the first week of its launch. What's more its monthly total sales of 54,687 copies was a long way ahead of the month's number 2 which sold 11,104 copies. Its global sales during its launch week were 54,687 copies.\n\nE-books more than global depression slows British printed book sales by a fortnight in 2012. By late September British printed book sales in 2011 have passed the £1bn (US$1.55 billion) mark two weeks later than in 2010 and year sales down 5.3% on last year. However the decline is more to do with the growth of E-book sales than the global economic depression. E-book sales accounted for around 9-10% of overall British Isles book sales in September 2011 compared to 4-5% in September 2010.\n\nE-books now over 10% sales. A quarter of British Isles publishers have seen E-book sales grow to over 10% of their market. This news is a development of last year's (2010) E-book appraisal. Some in the British book industry thing that half British mass market book fiction will be E-books by 2020.\n\nSpeculative Fiction (SF/fantasy/horror) holds its own in market share. Note: You have to be wary of what it is being measured, so read the following carefully... Speculative fiction has consistently held between 7  10% of the British Isles share of mass market (excluding small press and academic publishing) sales over the years. For example, back in 2001, science fiction and fantasy accounted for 4.6% with horror a further 2.4% and so together accounted for 7% of the mass market in cash terms (paperbacks and hardbacks combined). Now (2011) an analysis of mass market unit sales (that's numbers of copies sold) of British Isles paperbacks sold through Amazon reveals that SF and fantasy together have a market share of 9% of the mass 'fiction' market (obviously excluding non-fiction). However the picture is even better for Amazon's Kindle E-book sales as SF and fantasy together account for 14% of E-book copies sold and horror a further 4.7%, making the total British Isles speculative fiction (SF/fantasy/horror) E-book fiction genre E-book share a whopping 18.7% in terms of copies sold! (Of course add in non-fiction and average it with hard copy book sales it brings this figure down towards the long-term 7-10% market and unit sales share average.) So it certainly looks like spec-fic is holding its own if not doing rather well.\n\nBorders Group, the previously reported bankrupt US bookseller, resolved a dispute with Random House by giving the publisher the right to try to collect as much as US$36.4 million (£22.75m). Under the agreement, filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, Random House has a non-priority claim worth about US$800,000 (£500,000) less than the publisher is owed for books it supplied to Borders prior to bankruptcy.\n\nFinland's largest bookshop chain sold. The Suomalainen Kijakauppa bookshop chain has been sold to Otra, Finland's second largest publisher for £24.3 million (Euro 27.5m). The 59 shop strong chain celebrates its 100th anniversary this year (2012).\n\nSix libraries close in Brent. Brent was one of a number of local government Councils taken to court by residents over library closures last summer (2011).This new news follows the High Court ruling that Brent Council's closure plans were not unlawful. But Brent residents had taken out an injunction preventing further closures unless a Court hearing is heard. However the Court has now ruled that the closures were lawful. Since the financial crisis some 33 local libraries have shut out of 4,612.\n\nBritish library 2010-11 stats show that their annual budgets have declined by an average of 2.3%. Within the budgets the biggest decline was for buying new books and here budgets declined by an average of 8.6%. This was to protect library staff budgets. Even so paid library staff numbers are down and this year (2012) volunteers are set to outnumber 23,000 professional staff. Not surprisingly with fewer new books book borrowing has also declined; what is surprising is that book borrowing has only declined by 2.9%.\n\nAngry Robot boosts marketing strength. The SF/F crossover imprint Angry Robot has only been going a little over two years but has already shown that it punches above its weight including by publishing an Arthur C. Clarke award-winner despite a turbulent time moving to publishers Osprey. Now it is capitalising on its early successes by boosting its marketing and online profile. To do this it has recruited a marketing and digital manager, Darren Turpin. Turpin had been at publishers Little, Brown for three and a half year, originally working for the companys science fiction and fantasy list, Orbit. Before that he was manager of the SF department at Waterstones Bookstore Deansgate, Manchester, and editor of their in-house SF magazine The Alien Has Landed. Angry Robot are planning new products and marketing initiatives further to recent ones such as Nano Editions.\n\nAngry Robot have announced a sister imprint, Strange Chemistry, which will publish Young Adult genre fiction. The imprint launched in the autumn, with five titles appearing before the end of 2011. 2012 sees Strange Chemistry releases settle down to one book each month. Strange Chemistry will follow ARs strategy of co-publishing its books simultaneously in the US and UK, in both E-book and paperback formats. Subject matter will include fantasy, science fiction, supernatural and horror, and as with Angry Robot the lines between those genres are likely to be very blurry at times.\n\nHarperCollins marks Hobbit anniversary. HarperCollins is celebrating the 75th anniversary of The Hobbit with the publication of a collection of Tolkien's artwork and a 'cute' pocket-sized edition of the novel. The Hobbit was first published in September 1937. J. R. R. Tolkien, a good amateur artist who illustrated The Hobbit as well as producing maps and letter forms for Elvish script, plus pencil sketches and watercolours. What no-one has yet done is pull together all the artwork and put it into one book. Now the Tolkien archives, held at the Bodleian Library in Oxford, have been digitised, allowing HarperCollins to put all the illustrations in print for the first time, scanned at high resolution and with strong detail. The Art of the Hobbit, a slipcased volume, is edited by Wayne G Hammond and Christina Scull, and carries 110 pictures by the author. Also published is: a straight B-format reissue of the novel, as the 75th anniversary edition, (£7.99); a revised edition of The History of the Hobbit by J R R Tolkien and John Rateliff, published in a single volume for the first time (£35); and a 75th anniversary boxed set of the four novels, telling the complete story of Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf, Gollum and the Ring, with a new jacket design.\n\nTitan Books with the Estate of Philip Jose Farmer to bring his backlist titles back into print. Significantly, these include the 'Wold Newton Family' sequence and Time's Last Gift, a time travel novel featuring a well known Lord of the Jungle, whose initials, TLG, happen to match the abbreviation of the book's title. First published in 1972, and revised in 1977, Time's Last Gift serves as a prequel to his series of books featuring the land of Khokarsa in Ancient Africa (Hadon of Ancient Opar, Flight to Opar and the forthcoming The Song of Kwasin.) Time's Last Gift is scheduled for release in June, 2012, in trade paperback and digital (Kindle & Nook) formats. Also coming in the same formats is The Other Log of Phileas Fogg, a 'secret history' novel revealing the hidden events behind Jules Verne's Around the World in Eighty Days. First published in 1973, The Other Log of Phileas Fogg is one of the first examples of steampunk. The Other Log of Phileas Fogg is currently scheduled for release in May, 2012.\n\nReviver by Seth Patrick has been acquired by Tor UK for a six-figure sum. It is the first of three books in the 'Reviver' series, all of which have been acquired by Tor UK and Thomas Dunne Books in New York for World English Language rights. Comparable to Stephen King, Justin Cronin and Dean Koontz, this supernatural thriller has a lead character, Jonah Miller, who will feature in all three books. Reviver is set in the USA and introduces readers to Jonah Miller, one of the worlds most gifted revivers. Revivers are those who can make contact with the dead and bring them back for a short period of time to say goodbye to loved ones or, more importantly for the police, tell them who their killers were. But while reviving the victim of a brutal murder, Jonah discovers that a sinister presence is watching from the other side. When he starts to investigate, what he uncovers threatens everything he knows Author Seth Patrick is in his late 30s and lives in West Sussex (Britain).He is computer games developer who works for Sega. Reviver is his first novel.\n\nBella Pagan has left Orbit to join Tor at Pan Macmillan as a senior commissioning editor. We wish her well at her new home.\n\nThe Bookseller Association campaigns for declining local bookshops. It has a poster thanking customers who use their local bookshop, pointing out to customers that:-\n\n1) You kept money in the local economy.\n\n2) You embraced what makes us [(bookshops)] unique.\n\n3) You created local jobs.\n\n4) You helped the environment.\n\n5) You nurtured the community. 6) You helped keep the high street healthy.\n\n7) You created choice.\n\n8) You benefitted from our [(bookshop)] expertise.\n\n9) You invested in entrepreneurship.\n\n10) You made us [(bookshops)] a destination.\n\nBritish book chain Waterstones doe not give pay rise to longstanding contract staff. Staff on the Waterstones long-term 'legacy contract' an inflation pay rise of 3% their other 4,000 staff get. 100 long-term staff are affected. They will not get the pay rise unless they sign a new contract to work Bank (public) holidays. Many staff also complained that the tone of the letter they received from management was insulting.\n\nMore book trade news in our next seasonal news column in April 2012.

Shock, Horror, Drama, Probe! According to Steven Moffat (Who's current lead writer) its going to be heartbreaking. Amy and Rory were with the Doctor from embryo Matt (the current Doctor) Smith's first appearance at Easter 2010. A shame as the series would really benefit from longer story arcs in addition to the shorter ones.\n\nGermany airs Star Trek Nazi episode 43 years later. State broadcaster ZDFneo has decided that German viewers are now ready for the episode 'Patterns of Force', 43 years after it was first broadcast in Great Britain in 1968. In it the Enterprise finds that a star system has been culturally contaminated with one alien planet mimicking Nazi Germany and another being victimised. The episode was dubbed into German in 1995 for a restricted screening on German pay TV in 1996: the recent 2011 airing was free-view. Nonetheless, the episode screening was still subject to a German FSK-16 regulation which meant that nobody under the age of 16 was allowed to watch, and it was aired after 10 o'clock at night.\n\nSouth Park running gag outed. There are loads of running gags in South Park since it began in August 1997, 'they killed Kenny' being one that ran for many seasons (until Kenny actually died), but now a new one has been discovered. Each episode features a grey alien. The alien can be human-sized or as small as appearing on a dollar bill, but they are secreted in each episode. +++ South Park gets three season renewal. The US cable network Comedy Central had until recently contracted the series until 2013, but it will now run until 2016. The programme has just ended its 15th series in the US. The show was recently voted the greatest animated TV series by Entertainment Weekly. It has been nominated for an Emmy almost every year since, in the animation category, and has won four times.\n\nWalking Dead renewed for third series. The first episode of the 2nd series saw N. America viewing figures of 7.3 million so it was hardly surprising that they would renew. The series is based on the Eisner Award winning comic series about survivors immediately following a zombie apocalypse. It has to be said that the graphic novels are better as the series is a little drawn out: guess they want to milk it.\n\nWhat's hot and what's not in the US TV charts are a guide to series renewals or axes. Given this then looking back at the autumn sees the following series doing well: The Big Bang Theory and Person of Interest respectively getting around 15 million and 12 million. A Person of Interest is getting around 11 million viewers. Muddling along with around 7 million viewers is Terra Nova, The Walking Dead and A Gifted Man, though while the latter two are holding their own, the former has a distinctly downward trend and given its production costs it may be soon in trouble. Bumping along the bottom, hence ripe for axing, are The Vampire Diaries, Fringe, Clone Wars, Sanctuary and Chuck all with less than four million viewers.\n\nNeil Gaiman's American Gods set for TV series. HBO want an episodic drama stretched over six seasons with a possible debut in 2013. Each season will be of 10-12, hour-long episodes with a budget of around US$35-40 million (£23m  £25m) per season with a slated launch in 2013 at the earliest. Neil Gaiman (the British-born, US-based novelist, short-story writer and screenwriter) is an executive producer and the writer for the series. He says that the series will also include the novel's sequel, which he is now starting to write. American Gods won the 2002 Hugo and also the 2002 Bram Stoker Award (from the Horror Writers of America) for 'Best Novel'. Robert Richardson (the double Oscar-winner who worked on the Quentin Tarantino films Kill Bill and Inglorious Bastards, and on Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island) will make his directorial debut with this series. Tom Hanks' production company, Playtone, is to produce the show. American Gods' plot centres on the idea that the gods of ancient mythology exist in present-day America and are kept alive by people's belief in them.\n\nStephen King's Dark Tower possibly to become an HBO series. This news has yet to be confirmed and as King fans will know, the novels were previously announced as being adapted for film and before that King turned down an even earlier offer. +++ Books in the The Dark Tower have won a number of prestigious awards including Germany's Deutscher Phantastik Preis for science fiction and the British Fantasy Award 'Best novel'\n\nStephen Kings novel Under the Dome to be a TV series from DreamWorks. That there was to be a series is old news we previously reported. The new news is DreamWorks and that the adaptation may well be done by the comic book and Lost (seasons 3 - 5) writer Brian K. Vaughan. The SFnal thriller concerns conflicting locals, at a Maine vacation spot, when a force field suddenly surrounds their town and cuts them off from the rest of the world. is best known for writing the comic book series Ex Machina and Pride Of Baghdad.\n\nSyfy announces three scripted projects for development from Universal Cable Productions, CBS TV Studios and Fox Television Studios. The first is loosely a space opera: After decades of war, the newly formed Unity Democracy orders a volatile mix of humans and trans-humans to lead the Starship Defender on an expedition in search of lost worlds requiring law and order The second is a loose variant on Randall & Hopkirk with the working title Seeing Things : A cop becomes a ghost after his violent death and the only person who can help close his last case is a socially awkward man who realizes that the hallucinations he has had all his life may not be a figment of his imagination Finally there is Ghost Projekt. Based on the US comic series, a female KGB agent and male American weapons inspector form an unlikely partnership when a deadly force is unwittingly unleashed from a Siberian research facility.\n\n[The other key sections within this seasonal newscast are: Major Headline Links |\n\nNews which contains: Major Science & SF News, People: Major SF Author, Science Writer and Artist News; Film News; SF Book Trade News; TV News; Eurocon/Worldcon News; Fandom & Other News; and Net Watch |\n\nLast Season's Science News Summary including: General Science, Astronomy and Space and Natural Science |\n\nForthcoming Book Releases including: Science Fiction Forthcoming Fantasy & Horror Forthcoming Science Fact and Non-Fiction and Forthcoming TV & Film Tie-ins Book Releases | Selected Recent DVD Releases |\n\nR.I.P | Interface: Science and SF | End Bits.]\n\nSpring 2012\n\nEUROCON / WORLDCON NEWS\n\nThe 2011 Worldcon, Renovation, was held in Reno, Nevada, US. This was back at the end of August and we covered news in last season's news page but now with this Spring 2012 issue have here a stand-alone review of the Renovation 2011 Worldcon by Peter Tyers.\n\nChicon 7, the 2012 Worldcon, Chicago, US. Not much new news other than as you read this the Hugo Award base design competition has just closed. Progress Report 2 came out on-line in December (as an unnecessarily large, over 5MB, PDF and that did not even include the cover). The only item of note is a fascinating article on their astronaut GoH. Much of the rest concerns the (useful but mundane) usual domestics. The Hugo nominations now open (see next item below). Chicon 7's Guests of Honour are five-time Hugo winning author Mike Resnick, artist Rowena Morrill, art agent and collector Jane Frank, science fiction fan and former Worldcon chair Peggy Rae Sapienza, and  rather brilliantly  astronaut Story Musgrave. Chicon 7's Toastmaster is John Scalzi.\n\nHugo Award nominations for 2012 will shortly be open. Nominations are sought for a variety of categories of the Hugo 'SF achievement' Awards for novels, novellas, best film (dramatic presentation long form) and TV (short form) among other categories for works that came out in 2011. (Check out our above thoughts on the best science fiction books and best science fiction films to appear in the British Isles in 2011.) The Hugo Awards are one of the major awards for (in practice) English-language science fiction. The Hugos were first awarded at the 1953 World Science Fiction Convention in Philadelphia (Philcon II), and they have continued to honour science fiction and fantasy notables for nearly 60 years since. Nomination ballots are usually accepted through to around mid-March for the Hugo Awards and the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer. Members of Chicon 7  the 2012 Worldcon who join by 31st January 2012, and all members of Renovation, the prior year's Worldcon, are invited to submit nominating ballots before 11th March 2012. +++ Links to current Worldcon websites for more information can be found from the World SF Society on www.wsfs.org or on our diary page.\n\nThe 2013 SF Worldcon is, of course, Texas, US, as we reported last season. No further news other than the guests previously announced and the sad news just before Christmas that one, Darrell K. Sweet of these had passed away.\n\nThe 2013 World Fantasycon announces new GoH Richard Matheson! A popular choice well-known for I am Legend and The Shrinking Man.\n\nLondon is the currently unopposed bit for the 2014 Worldcon. The autumn saw a site visit by the organisers and a number of interested fans of the Excel conference centre in London's docklands. Since we reported on the bid launch it is all looking rather positive. Plenty of hotels (albeit a tad expensive), excellent conference facilities, London's finance district five minutes away (boring but spectacular to look at) by local light rail and the London's west end (theatres, parliament etc) is 20 minutes away. Just across the river is the Greenwich Maritime Museum and across the small park and up the hill from that is Greenwich Observatory through which the zero longitude line runs (and another great view). For those into civil engineering then ten minutes by boat downstream there is the Thames barrage (with small exhibition centre). However please do not treat this bid as a forgone conclusion. Worldcon regulars are most certainly encouraged to vote for the site at Chicon 7 future site selection tally. If a really large number do vote then it will signal likely attendance (hence help the organisers plan) as well as promote what could well be one of the most exciting Worldcons outside of N. America of the past decade. So if you are registered for Chicon then do vote, it costs nothing but will mean a lot.\n\nThe 2015 Worldcon sees two bids: Spokane and Orlando, both US. See last season's brief report. As both are N. American, N. Americans with a yen to travel might like to consider something different and go to a smaller Eurocon that year (in addition to the winning Worldcon bid.\n\nKansas City, US, bid for 2016 Worldcon. This is a new bid. There is also a light-hearted rival for Mariehamn, Finland, but this is not likely to develop into a serious bid unless Kansas really messes up. (There was much blogosphere debate in the last months of 2011 as to Mariehamn's seriousness.)\n\nJapan has their bid for the 2017 Worldcon. We previously noted the Japan bid but this is now up against a rival bid for New York, US.\n\nNew Orleans, US, is bidding for the 2018 Worldcon. This bid is currently unopposed.\n\nMontreal, Canada, is bidding for the 2019 Worldcon. This bid is also currently unopposed. As the 2009 Worldcon in Montreal was successful it is possible that no other bid will stand against this one.\n\nNew Zealand is bidding for the 2020 Worldcon. This builds upon the enthusiasm of the 2010 New Zealand national convention which was held the weekend before the 2010 Worldcon in Melbourne Australia and so saw an international dimension. Notwithstanding arguably the best Worldcon film programme for a decade, Melbourne Australia was an exemplary organisational cock-up rescued on the day by volunteers stepping up to the plate, an Australian bid this decade is not likely to attract much support. And so we have New Zealand. Though its fandom is smaller, if it can recruit overseas committee members choosing carefully on those with a reputation for delivery (rather than just big name fans), then this could be a most interesting bid. The venue has yet to be determined (plenty of time for that) but if it is the capital then there is plenty for visitors to see in Wellington. Those who attend Worldcons are gently urged to consider supporting this bid right now. Though air prices are in real-terms likely to be much higher in 2020, the global human ecology of energy resources is such that this could be the last southern hemisphere Worldcon with affordable air travel for averagely wealthy fans. Another reason for supporting this bid. Check their website out\n\nLinks to Worldcon websites can be found from the World SF Society on www.wsfs.org.\n\nFor links to Worldcon bid websites check out - http://worldcon.org/bids - the Worldcon bid page.\n\nMeanwhile over in Europe\n\nCroatia Eurocon 2012 in Zagreb is now entering its final preparations lap. So only timely, for those wanting an early summer holiday in central Europe with many on hand to do translating for you, to register for this end-of-April Eurocon. Meanwhile we have previously provided news of this convention here and here.\n\nEuropean SF Society (ESFS) business meeting at Zagreb might well see a change in the ESFS officer line-up. The terms of the current officers expire at this year's Eurocon. It is likely that a number of the officers will get re-elected in part because nobody else seems to want to do the jobs and also because ESFS aren't exactly good at posting minutes of their business meetings (unlike WSFS) or even the agendas of forthcoming meetings. (So many of you may not be aware of the opportunity, hence this notification to give you time to consider matters.) Though many of the current officers have been good at keeping ESFS ticking over the past decade (a pat on the back here), change really is needed and ESFS requires re-invigorating (not least changing the Treasurer post to something meaningful as ESFS has no finance or financial obligations and we do not see the current Treasurer except at those Eurocons where the officers get re-elected). What is needed is for ESFS officers to gather views at the annual business meetings, distil them to action points and to recruit volunteers to take these forward between successive Eurocons, as well as to disseminate ESFS/Eurocon news to key European SF news websites/blogs in each member nation just four times a year or so. So if you have been to several Eurocons (hence have a basic knowledge of European fandom), have conrunning experience (hence can appreciate the challenges individual Eurocon organisers face), and can commit to attending Eurocons in your three-year term, then why not put yourself forward for election? The officer posts are not challenging (the Eurocons themselves are organised by host nation teams and not the officers) but if you have organisational experience (especially with team-building across disparate groups) then there is considerable scope to develop ESFS, promote Eurocons and encourage Euroconferences should you wish to stand for office at Zagreb 2012. The rewarding upside is that officers get to meet and work with a diverse range of people and SF groups across Europe. So if you are European and a con-goer who would like to see a broader front of SF activity furthered, then why not give standing for an ESFS officer post consideration? This is a genuine opportunity to make a mark helping grow the pan-European SF community.\n\nKiev Eurocon, Ukraine, 2013. Not much news but none was really expected at this early stage. The Ukrainians did send a team to SMOFcon and sold several memberships. We covered the Kiev 2014 convention basics last time but expect to learn new news after this year's Zagreb Eurocon above. Of course the 2006 Eurocon in Kiev was successful and its the same venue this time. If the organisers can have a more integrated international programme and again can organise a post-convention trip to Chernobyl, then this could be the Eastern European Eurocon of the decade.\n\nThere are two bids for Eurocon in 2014: Ireland and Romania. Ireland will hold their national convention (Octocon) the weekend after the 2014 London Worldcon irrespective of whether or not they win the bid to be the Eurocon: so there will be a relaxacon after the Worldcon which many transatlantic visitors will enjoy and it could make for a fine Euroconference if Ireland does not win the Eurocon bid. The problem Ireland has is to convince the Eurocon business meeting at Zagreb (at which the vote will be made) that they are truly a serious Eurocon bid. The last Irish Eurocon (Dublin in 1997) was a Eurocon flop (albeit a worthy local convention) with next to zero European SF programming and no European mainland Guests of Honour. The current bid team still seem to be having difficulty in assuaging such Eurocon fears especially as their website has proclaimed the previous Irish Eurocon as successful. All this we covered in last season's news. Ireland, while no doubt able to attract a number of N. Americans wishing to extend their 2014 London Worldcon trip, also have the problem of attracting mainland continental European fans who may not have the budget to do both London and Dublin. What we do know is that Dublin will be the venue city. Meanwhile Romania also has much convincing to do at the 2012 Zagreb Eurocon business meeting. We understand that currently two options are being considered: one for an Eastern Romania convention, and the other for a Western Romanian con. Romania did run a hugely successful Eurocon in western Romania in 1994 (Timisoara) and also a bit of a flop in eastern Romania in 2001 (Capidava): hardly any non-Romanians attended. However the latter's failure was in no small part due to one of the leading organiser's sad demise while the former's success owed quite a bit to state sponsorship. The likely time of the bid is April/May 2014 to prevent any clash with the Worldcon and also to capitalise on the pre-London Worldcon European preparations as that would be the last major European event with significant international representation. The question is whether or not the Romanian team have the resources in place for a good bid or whether they will ask for a transfer of bid status to that of a smaller Euroconference (which if held in a Romanian city with an international airport that is not Bucharest could be very interesting in its own right).\n\nIn short, both the Romanian and Irish bids have their work cut out and both bidding committees need to be clearly focussed on what it is they are exactly pitching in the context of a European Worldcon year. That then is the cold harsh look. Being positive, if both bids recognise and address their weaknesses as well as build on their respective strengths then the outcome, be it Eurocons and/or Euroconferences, for 2014 will be bright.\n\nWill Eurocon 2015 be Finland? Well there are no formal bids announced but the Finns have been hankering to do a Eurocon for a while (2003 was the last time so they are arguably due) and Fincons are lively affairs.\n\nNetherlands for Eurocon in 2016? Hmmm. The Dutch aren't exactly prominent on the Eurocon scene and are not noted for international conrunning. However at SMOFcon apparently some Dutch were testing the water with the idea of a bid for 2015. If there has been a new conrunning fan group established the past decade in the Netherlands and they start sending half a dozen of their team to both the 2012 and 2013 Eurocons then they might see enough of how things are done to put forward a meaningful bid in 2014 to run the Eurocon in 2016.\n\nConsidering putting forward a Eurocon bid? Then check out the guidance on the Eurocon ESFS website linked off the front page. Current and potential bidders might want to print this out and then formally work through check-listing the points.\n\nLinks to current/forthcoming Eurocon websites can be found from the European SF Society on www.esfs.info.\n\nFor a list of national and major conventions, check out our convention diary.\n\n[The other key sections within this seasonal newscast are: Major Headline Links |\n\nNews which contains: Major Science & SF News, People: Major SF Author, Science Writer and Artist News; Film News; SF Book Trade News; TV News; Eurocon/Worldcon News; Fandom & Other News; and Net Watch |\n\nLast Season's Science News Summary including: General Science, Astronomy and Space and Natural Science |\n\nForthcoming Book Releases including: Science Fiction Forthcoming Fantasy & Horror Forthcoming Science Fact and Non-Fiction and Forthcoming TV & Film Tie-ins Book Releases | Selected Recent DVD Releases |\n\nR.I.P | Interface: Science and SF | End Bits.]\n\nSpring 2012\n\nFANDOM & OTHER NEWS\n\nBritish Fantasy Award storm at Fantasycon. The twittersphere was abound with grumbles, comment and query following the 2011 British Fantasy Award winners. At first glance the award winners seem all very worthy, and indeed as candidates for the award they truly are. However, when you realise that British Fantasy Society Chairman and the award administrator, David Howe, is also the person behind the small press company Telos whose books picked up a couple of awards and it itself won in the 'Best Small Press' category, you can see why some eyebrows were raised. And if in addition you happen to know that Sam Stone, the winner of two categories this year, is his life partner you will not be surprised that some eyebrow-raising achieved escape velocity. It should be made clear that the Brit-based SF2 Concatenation has not been involved in this debate in any way. Nor are we aware of any deliberate rigging of the vote. However it does seem to us that in the general case for any award that it is prudent of both award administrators and staff of sponsoring organizations (in this case the British Fantasy Society) should be ruled as ineligible for being nominated for the award they serve. There must be seen to be transparency and clear water between those administrating awards, responsible for their promotion and governance, and the masses of us that nominate and vote for the awards. Anything else just makes things murky, undermines credibility and provide openings for criticism be it justified or not\n\nAnd so it was perhaps in this spirit that after a few days of controversy in the blogosphere that even spread over into the national press, Sam Stone returned her award and David Howe resigned as British Fantasy Society Chair. Author Ramsey Campbell, current President of the BSF, announced on the BSF's website that: \"David has worked extremely hard for the society this past year and has, we believe, raised the profile of the BFS significantly with the changes he has instigated and the work he has put in. We are very sorry, therefore that this situation, and the words of members of the society aimed personally at David, have forced him into a position to tender his resignation. The Committee regretfully respects his decision to stand down.\"\n\nIn December the preliminary results of a British Fantasy Society membership survey were announced. It appears there is some support for a move from the British Fantasy Award being membership voted to a jury decided award. Both options have their pros and cons: the former signals a popular choice, while the latter is based on the criteria and resulting opinion of a minority but less likely to be swayed by lobbying. However it may well be that the BFS will try to get the best of both worlds with its membership determining the short-list and a jury determining a final winner. +++ Comment: Of course all major awards have their problems. To take one obvious example, the Hugos. In recent years, the voting here moved from a first-past-the-post to the 'Australian voting' system of ranked preferences. One way of looking at the advantage of the latter is that the winner has the greatest across-the-board popularity. Conversely, the disadvantage is that the winner is the least objectionable to the majority. Neither option reflects the unrealisable ideal of selecting for SFnal excellence. (However the short-listed 'Best Novel' category usually throws up a couple of truly commendable works, and sometimes one of these even wins.) And then there is the Hugo 'Best Dramatic Presentation Short Form' category which counts TV episodes not series, and so recent years (much of this category's history) has see it become the Dr Who category, while the fanzine and fan writing Hugos are really a Worldcon fan personality popularity contest of little relevance to excellence in SF fanac. So all awards have their problems. The recent trials of the British Fantasy Award just demonstrate that it is difficult to run awards of genre-wide relevance (in theory to hundreds of thousands of British readers) by a small subset (a hundred or so). There is though one lesson from this sorry tale. Those involved in running and promoting awards should have no connection with any of that award's entries if the award's credibility is not to be undermined. +++ See also Ian's stand-alone review of the 2011 Fantasycon.\n\nRussia's fandom splits with some slight silliness. The so-called end of the Communist era in 1990 saw the rise of Russian, and Russian federation nation, SF/F conventions and the emergence of Russian fandom. All well and good and despite ups and downs it has been largely good natured with minimal regional rivalry. Former Soviet nations have also enjoyed some fan success particularly the Ukraine. In Russia itself one of the largest conventions has been the International Festival of Fantasy and Role Games, Zilantkon, which has seen registrants in the thousands, sometimes rivalling Worldcon in size (though of course not France's Utopiales or the US Dragoncons): Zilantkon saw around 2,500 in 2007. Zilantkon is held each November in Kazan in central Russia. Meanwhile, earlier in the year in the Spring, near Moscow there have in recent years been the Roskons and these have attracted a respectable few hundred. Variable in size have been the Aelita conventions but which have regularly attracted international-standard Guests of Honour, and there are a few others such as run of St Petersburg venued cons. However this year there was unconstructive rumour-mongering that Zilantkon was on its uppers. Then there was a new convention, the Festival of Fantasy, in Kaluga. Completely unhelpfully this last was organised on the same weekend as Zilantkon is traditionally held. The good news is that those with strong tribal instincts could not attend their rivals' event, so both cons went off peaceably. Those that suffered were the few fans who would have gone to both events: Russian fandom needs to have regard for its nation's fan diversity and calendar. Having said that, both events have a markedly different take on speculative fiction and, contrary to a minority in Russian fandom, there is nothing at all wrong with that!\n\nFirst inter-regional Festival of Fantasy held in Kaluga, Russia, in November. Kaluga is about 100 miles (160km) south-east of Moscow. The programme included science fiction writers Sergey Lukyanenko, Alexander Gromov, Alexander Zorich, Vladimir Vasilyev, Sergey Slyusarenko, Anton Pervushin, and local author Mikhail Tyrin, as well as film directors Alexander Mayorov and Vladimir Tarasov. Those attending from outside of the region there were tourist opportunities including a convention-organised the excursion through the city, as well as a visit to the city's planetarium and an outing to the space museum: indeed the programme saw an item by the space rocket designer Oleg Sokolov It should be noted that Festival of Fantasy related to as much SF as fantasy: Russians use the same word for 'SF' and/or 'fantasy', 'fantastika' the equivalent of which in English would be 'speculative fiction'.\n\nThe 21st International Festival of Fantasy and Role Games, Zilantkon, was held in Kazan. This year there were 1281 registrants plus 500 day registrants. This was not bad despite some rumours that few would attend. Indeed numbers have been higher in the past but we must remember that we are in the middle of a recession. There was a full programme of panels and much fancy dress with archery demonstrations and so forth, not to mention gala balls. The programme had nearly 250 items, roughly half as much again as the previous year. Traditionally Zilantkon is firmly what in the west would be considered fantasy whereas the Festival of Fantasy covered both SF and fantasy, and the two events were also nearly 500 miles (770km) apart. +++ And of course the 21st International Festival of Fantasy saw the Big Zilant awarded, see above awards section.\n\nThe 22nd Festival of Fantastic Films was held in Manchester. Elsewhere this Spring 2012 issue of SF2 Concatenation Darrell Buxton has a stand-alone review of the 2011 Festival.\n\nEntries are now invited for the 2012 Delta Film Award, to be presented at the 23rd Festival of Fantastic Films in Manchester, England, in October. The deadline is 1 September, 2012. The entry form and rules are available here: http://pics.livejournal.com/stevegreen/pic/000b6t08/. The Award's history is available here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Film_Award.\n\nGermany's Buchmessecon (BuCon) 2011 is the largest to date. Some 400 attended. As is usual with BuCons, it was very book orientated, though the Kurt Siodmak (film), along with SFCD and Phantastik (written SF) Prizes were awarded. There were many readings, an excellent atmosphere, but not very good catering. This year's event was more fantasy orientated and there were noticeably more women present (not that these two facts are to be connected by your PC; perish the thought). And, of course, there were plenty of authors and a dealers room.\n\nSpain's national convention, Hispacon, had more than 150 attending. Noteworthy events included the panel with Laura Gallego, Anabel Botella, David Lozano, Susana Vallejo and Víctor Conde, on publishing speculative fiction in Spain, and the launch of Alejandro Colucci's new book of his artwork. The convention also saw the presentation of the Ignotus and other awards.\n\nIndia's Science Teaching through Science Fiction media, Artificial Intelligence and Robots conference is being held in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu India at Bharatiar University, Jan"
