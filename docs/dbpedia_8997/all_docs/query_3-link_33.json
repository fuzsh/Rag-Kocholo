        "meta_description": "INSEMINOID 2 by INSEMINOID 2, released 13 October 2023\n\n1. Act I: The Moribund Artifact\n2. Act II: The Crewâ€™s Decay\n3. Act III: The End of the Horde\n\nWhile our in-house horror synth masters, NIGHT GOSPEL, didn&#39;t have the time to put together an album this year, they did give their stamp of approval to TWO spooky tapes for you this Halloween. This, the first, is a fictional sequel to the 1981 Norman J. Warran film INSEMINOID, which was basically just a rip-off of ALIEN.\r\n\r\nThe band here channels their &quot;Follow the Flock&quot; era The Locust love and crafts Three Acts of disturbing sci-fi grindcore horror. Guitars that sound like lasers. Dual vocals shout across the corridor. Drums that race in and out as an alien finding their next victim. All with interludes with set-ups from an android narrator. Anywho, here&#39;s the synopsis for you nerds:\r\n\r\nDeep within the desolate ruins of a remote research station on a lunar outpost, an unspeakable horror awakens. An ancient artifact triggers a vile infestation, unleashing alien organisms with an insatiable desire to reproduce.\r\n\r\nAs the crew of the USCSS Moribund explores the ruins, they unwittingly become vessels for the creatures&#39; sinister breeding. Bodies are violated, grotesque hybrids emerge, and terror spreads like wildfire. Trust shatters, alliances crumble, and survival becomes a desperate struggle against an evolving nightmare.\r\n\r\nFollowing a communication blackout and tormented by their infected comrades, the survivors battle their own sanity as the relentless horde adapts, growing stronger with every passing second. In a race against time, they must unravel the secrets of the ruins before they succumb to the ravenous abomination that lurks on board.\r\n\r\n&quot;Inseminoid 2&quot; is chilling and visceral sci-fi horror, plunging deep into the abyss of human vulnerability as it confronts the unimaginable terror of an extraterrestrial force determined to consume their very souls and juicy buttholes.\r\n\r\nWC-048",

        "text": "In shadows deep, a lunar outpost lies, Where ruins of the ancient wake and rise. An artifact disturbed, an evil stirs, Unleashing horrors, fertile thoughts in blur. Inseminoid's infestation takes hold, Alien beings, vile and uncontrolled. Their lust for breeding spreads a chilling fear, In violated bodies, life appears.\n\nTrust fractures, alliances start to fray, Survivors grapple with their minds' decay. Visions grotesque, their sanity's demise, As hybrids spawn beneath the astral skies. Time slips away, a race against their fate, Unraveling secrets, but it might be too late."
