        "text": "Based on the title and the poster, I was expecting some real garbage. Like David DeCoteau levels of garbage. But it turns out this is a real movie. It’s not necessarily great, but it tries.\n\nI guess I’d consider it an Alien knockoff. It is from 1981, just two years after the release of Ridley Scott’s film. And it involves an alien basically raping a woman.\n\nIt’s sort of disturbing, but I suppose it goes without saying that it’s inferior to Alien. It’s not as monster-heavy, likely because of budgetary restrictions. Instead of a xenomorph, we have a woman going around killing people, and that’s where I lose a bit of interest.\n\nRating: 5/10"
