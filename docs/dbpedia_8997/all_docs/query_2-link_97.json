        "text": "The North Remembers\n\nSeason 2 Premiere. As Robb Stark and his northern army continue the war against the Lannisters, Tyrion arrives in King's Landing to counsel Joffrey and temper the young king's excesses. On the island of Dragonstone, Stannis Baratheon plots an invasion to claim his late brother's throne, allying himself with the fiery Melisandre, a strange priestess of a stranger god. Across the sea, Daenerys, her three young dragons, and khalasar trek through the Red Waste in search of allies, or water. In the North, Bran presides over a threadbare Winterfell while, beyond the Wall, Jon Snow and the Night's Watch must shelter with a devious wildling.\n\nThe Night Lands\n\nIn the wake of a bloody purge in the capital, Tyrion chastens Cersei for alienating the king's subjects. On the road north, Arya shares a secret with a Night's Watch recruit named Gendry. With supplies dwindling, one of Dany's scouts returns with news of their position. After nine years as a Stark ward, Theon Greyjoy reunites with his father Balon and sister Yara, who want to restore the ancient Kingdom of the Iron Islands. Davos enlists Salladhor Saan, a pirate, to join forces with Stannis and Melisandre for a naval invasion of King's Landing.\n\nWhat Is Dead May Never Die\n\nAt the Red Keep, Tyrion plots three alliances through the promise of marriage. Catelyn arrives in the Stormlands to forge an alliance of her own. But King Renly, his new wife Margaery, and her brother Loras Tyrell have other plans in mind. Balon Greyjoy maps out his strategy of attack while, at Winterfell, Luwin tries to decipher Bran's dreams."
