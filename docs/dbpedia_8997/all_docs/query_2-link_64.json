        "text": "The producer Richard Gordon, who has died aged 85, was involved with several offbeat classics of horror and science-fiction cinema. These included Arthur Crabtree's Fiend Without a Face (1958), which climaxes with a still-astonishing siege of a power station by disembodied, tentacled, malicious human brains, and Antony Balch's Horror Hospital (1973), a lively and perverse mad-scientist satire featuring Michael Gough and Robin Askwith.\n\nIt may be that Gordon and his brother, Alex, so closely associated that many reference sources mistakenly say they were twins, were the first people to take the now-common route from movie-crazed kid to industry professional, later the path of film-makers as different as Jean-Luc Godard and Steven Spielberg. As schoolboys, the Gordons founded a film society, then wrote for fan magazines and performed menial roles on low-budget productions, always motivated by a boundless enthusiasm for the films they had loved as children in London, where Richard was born.\n\nHe served in the Royal Navy at the end of the second world war, but Richard's entire life was devoted to the cinema. The Gordon brothers emigrated to the US in 1947. Alex went to Hollywood and became active as a producer of low-budget, teen-appeal exploitation films marked by his fondness for casting old-time stars he recalled from his childhood who had lost their marquee lustre by the 1950s.\n\nRichard stayed in New York and founded Gordon Films, importing and distributing foreign films in America. He had a canny eye for an exploitation item and a bargain. When his friend and frequent collaborator Bryant Haliday, who combined the careers of exploitation star and high-end distributor, didn't take seriously an Italian horror movie called L'Ultima Preda del Vampiro, Gordon – who had come along to the screening staged for Haliday – quietly bought the rights, retitled it Playgirls and the Vampire, and reaped a healthy profit from the film.\n\nIn America, the Gordons sought out the idols of their youth on the excuse of interviewing them for fan magazines. Finding Bela Lugosi in a career lull, Richard became the horror star's agent in the 1950s, and was responsible for setting up a British theatrical tour of Dracula in 1951 which floundered.\n\nTo make the best of a bad thing, Gordon put together a peculiar British film, Mother Riley Meets the Vampire (1952), partnering Lugosi with the music-hall drag comic Arthur Lucan (similarly in decline). After producing or executive-producing a string of British B-pictures – Assignment Redhead (1956), The Counterfeit Plan (1957), Kill Me Tomorrow (1957) – Gordon was able to work with Boris Karloff, an even greater horror idol, on two British-made period shockers, The Haunted Strangler (1958) and Corridors of Blood (1958), which rode the gothic horror wave inaugurated by Hammer Films. He also had a hand in the science-fiction films First Man into Space (1958) and Fiend Without a Face, made in Britain but set reasonably convincingly in North America.\n\nBased always in New York, Gordon still made films in Britain. In the 1960s, while handling a heavy load as a distributor, he found time to set up and produce an interesting string of genre movies starring Haliday: the creepy ventriloquist's dummy horror movie Devil Doll (1964), the African revenge drama Curse of the Voodoo (1965), the mutated-scientist science-fiction monster movie The Projected Man (1966) and the island-set proto-slasher movie Tower of Evil (1972).\n\nCredible in driven, sinister roles, Haliday was nevertheless not charismatic enough to compete with Peter Cushing – with whom Gordon worked in Island of Terror (1966) – but Gordon's association with him paid off in later years. Haliday was a co-owner of the arthouse label Janus Films, holder of the US rights for many Fellini and Bergman classics; when Janus evolved into the Criterion Collection – which has been issuing major films in optimal editions on DVD and Blu-ray – Gordon supervised sumptuous editions of his backlist titles in new formats.\n\nIn the 1970s, Gordon produced films for other eccentric cineastes: Balch, who went from collaborating with William Burroughs to directing Secrets of Sex (1970) and Horror Hospital; Radley Metzger, one of the most creative makers of softcore and hardcore sex films, who collaborated with Gordon on a chic 1978 remake of The Cat and the Canary with a superb supporting cast (Honor Blackman, Wilfrid Hyde-White, Daniel Massey, Wendy Hiller, Edward Fox); and Norman J Warren, a British exploitation pioneer who directed Gordon's last film, the pleasingly lurid science-fiction monster movie Inseminoid (1980).\n\nIn his later years, Gordon was a frequent interviewee, convention attendee and letter-writer, always eager to chip in with points of fact or opinion whenever anything was written about his work.\n\nHis brother died in 2003."
