        "text": "Welcome to the first in what I'm planning will be a year-long series of weekly reviews for movies that were released in 1981. Before I begin with my review, I should note that while it is my intention to review each movie as close to the thirtieth anniversary of its release as possible, finding a reliable release date can be problematic. It can also be difficult to track down specific movies. From time to time I'll be a little off, but I'll do my best to make a note of it. Sometimes this will be accidental, and sometimes it will be by design. There will be occasions where two of the movies released one weekend are more interesting to me than anything released the next weekend. In cases such as those, I'll go with what looks the most interesting to me. I'll also be looking to the boards for the occasional suggestion.\n\nThat's said. Let's have a (spoiler-filled) look at...\n\nInseminoid (Original Release Date: 23 January 1981 [West Germany])\n\nI knew this as Horror Planet growing up, and was surprised to discover it was not the original title. The people who made it called it Inseminoid, and I can't imagine why anyone would want to call it anything else. Such a title is an unspoken promise of sci-fi and sexploitation, and if it delivers nothing else, it at least delivers this. You want a buck-naked woman injected with alien seed in a bizarre dream sequence? You want to see that same woman feed on human entrails, get punched in the face, and get kicked repeatedly in her pregnant belly? You got it. If that's all you want from Inseminoid, you may be pleased.\n\nThe biggest hurdle you will have to overcome to enjoyit is to look past its similarities to better movies. If you go digging for reviews, I'm betting a comparison to Alien is the one you will see drawn the most. There's no getting around it, really. In Inseminoid, a scientist among a small crew of scientists on a remote planet in the (presumably) distant future is impregnated by alien seed, the crew is picked off one by one, aliens are born, and the movie ends with a suggestion that they will get off the planet and multiply. If you've seen Alien, you've seen a pretty similar story pan out. There's more to Inseminoid's plot than these bare bones, but I don't think the movie cares any more than I do that there's more to the plot, so I won't bother summarizing it much more beyond the above.\n\nInseminoid isn't simply a poor man's Alien. To begin with, the budget and subtlety of Alien (hard to imagine, considering Giger's designs) are wholly absent. It owes almost as much, if not more, to the emerging slasher genre. Almost every death is gory, and almost everyone killed dies as a result of pure idiocy.\n\nThe expectant mother, played by Judy Geeson, does the majority of the slashing, and she takes a mixture of delight and disgust in doing it. Geeson approaches her role with conviction â€” so much so that the movie around her barely meets her half way. Much of the rest of the cast is made up of bland and generically attractive men and women not even the script trusts the viewer to tell apart. For the first ten minutes, almost no character is spoken to without that character's name getting thrown into one of the lines. \"What do you think it is, Kate?\" \"I don't know, Sharon. You'd better ask Holly.\" \"Well, Holly, what do you think it is?\" \"What makes you think I'd know if Kate didn't know, Sharon? You'd better have Gail run some tests. Will you do that for us, Gail?\" \"Certainly, Holly.\" (Note: Not Actual Dialog from Movie)\n\nThere's something a little off about the whole affair. The sets look as dirt-cheap as I'm sure they were, and the space suits look enough like jogging suits that I wouldn't have been surprised if I had caught a glimpse of the classic Adidas flower on one of them. The score is a medley of moog and synth that often seems out of place. Sometimes it sounds like Wendy Carlos. Sometimes it sounds like Charles Bernstein's Nightmare on Elm Street. At one point, a humorously slow mine cart chase scene is scored with some funk-style synth bass. The score's composer, John Scott, is no hack. He scored Greystoke (a Tarzan movie a good deal better than the Bo Derek Tarzan I plan to review later in the year), so he must have some clue what he's doing. Right? (Of course, scores don't always get the editing they deserve.)\n\nThe acting is particularly uneven. For every gusto-giving, competent performance like Geeson's, there's one like Jennifer Ashley's. (Ashley encounters the words she speaks like she's reading them for the first time, and like Anakin and Padme, nods and shakes her head with almost every line she delivers.) The actors are a mix of Americans and Brits, though Britishisms are put in Americans' mouths. (Both Americans and Brits refer to \"torches,\" where an American would normally refer to the same object as a flashlight; I guess the Brits win the final language war.) In the case of at least one actor, I suspect an American accent is faked. (An actor speaking in otherwise perfect Americanese lets an \"arse\" slip.) Why? I don't know. \"Why?\" is a question I tried not to ask myself too often. The script and characters are too dumb to waste much thought on them.\n\nThe aliens are born so late from their human mother's womb that they don't really have much of an impact. The puppets are stiff and unrealistic looking, so this was probably a wise choice. They resemble final-stage Brundlefly a lot (or, rather, Brundlefly resembles them), so that's sort of cool.\n\nAll these elements combine for a movie I found myself wanting tolike more than actually liking it.\n\nThe Final Word:\n\nRecommended? Even if you have an affection for sci-fi, sexploitation, and slasher films, you might find this one dull. While describing it, it occurred to me how much more enjoyable it should have been.\n\nStandout Scene: A woman gets her foot caught while in a space suit in the cold outer atmosphere of the planet. Her foot looks pretty easily extractable. She is instructed via commlink how to get out of the mess, but she freaks, rips out her oxygen tube, pops her visor open, exposes her face tothe subzero temperature, puts the tube in her mouth, pulls an electric saw out of some invisible magician's hat, and proceeds to try to saw her foot off before succumbing to hypothermia. It's hilarious.\n\nHey! I know that guy! Victoria Tennant, who plays Barbra, was married to Steve Martin for close to a decade. She's in All of Me and L.A. Story with him. Judy Geeson was in To Sir, with Love and would later show up on Mad About You and Star Trek Voyager. Stephanie Beacham was a latter-series fixture on Dynasty.\n\nNostalgia Score: 7/10. It definitely feels of the era. It has Alien written all over it, and some wannabe Wendy Carlos moog. It also makes frequent reference to the planet's binary suns, which practically screams Star Wars.\n\nMovie Score: 41/100\n\nActual Line of Dialogue From the Movie's Trailer: \"The inconceivable is about to be conceived.\"\n\nReview Score: 41 / 100"
