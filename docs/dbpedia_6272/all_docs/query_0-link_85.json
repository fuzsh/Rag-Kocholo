        "text": "Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle is the latest creation of Jay Ward to come to life again in the movie theaters. For the first time, Brendan Fraser is not in it (like George of the Jungle or Dudley Do-Right), which is a good initial sign. However, there was no great clamor for those remakes, and there is no great clamor for this one. What starts off promising turns around and becomes boring and overbearing. For the first time, Rocky, Bullwinkle, Fearless Leader, Boris and Natasha, are in the real world. Even a legion of cameos (Randy Quaid, John Goodman, Jonathan Winters, Kenan and Kel, Whoopi Goldberg, Billy Crystal, Janeane Garofalo, David Alan Grier, and many more) are not enough to ultimately save the movie.\n\nFearless Leader (Robert De Niro, Analyze This, Flawless), Boris Badenov (Jason Alexander, North, The Hunchback of Notre Dame), and Natasha Fatale (Rene Russo, The Thomas Crown Affair, Lethal Weapon 4) make it into the real world and scheme to take it over. The three will use RBTV (really bad television) to hypnotize America into a stupor, thereby rendering them open to suggestion. Fearless Leader will then tell them to vote him as President. The FBI sends Agent Karen Sympathy (\"it\" girl-of-the-moment Piper Perabo, Coyote Ugly, White Boys) to find Rocky and Bullwinkle in order to stop their foes. Sympathy finds them and brings them here, but only as cartoons. Sympathy, Rocky, and Bullwinkle must race across the country to stop Fearless Leader from airing RBTV while Boris and Natasha chase after them.\n\nScreenwriter Kenneth Longeran (Analyze This) does have the entire concept down well. Bullwinkle (voiced by Keith Scott, who also voices the Narrator) and Rocky (voiced by June Foray, the original voice of Rocky) remain true to their old cartoon ways. Bullwinkle puns mercilessly, and some of them are extremely funny. The film is replete with sight gags (the best being the hospital \"J\" Ward) and verbal interplay between the Narrator and characters, but the actual number of times these gags are funny falls as the movie progresses. Some of the better one-liners come from the cameos, especially John Goodman and Kenan and Kel's last comments. However Longeran's explanation of what all the characters were doing since the cancellation of their series is funny."
