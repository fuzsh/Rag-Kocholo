        "text": "DreamWorks Animation Television is creating two original kids series for Amazon Prime Video: The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Kung Fu Panda: The Paws of Destiny.\n\nRocky and Bullwinkle will debut on May 11 in the U.S., U.K., Germany, India, and Japan. The Kung Fu Panda series will have a global debut at some point later this year via Prime Video in over 200 territories.\n\nThe trailer for the Rocky and Bullwinkle series is below:\n\nRocky and Bullwinkle are, of course, based on the classic cartoon squirrel and moose that first appeared on television screens back in 1959. The Cold War-era series pitted them against a pair of adversaries – Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale – from the fictional eastern European country of Pottsylvania.\n\nThe new series is executive produced by Scott Fellows (The Fairly OddParents, Big Time Rush) and Tiffany Ward, daughter of the original series producer Jay Ward, and features Tara Strong as the voice of Rocket J. Squirrel, Brad Norman as Bullwinkle J. Moose, Ben Diskin as Boris Badenov, Rachel Butera as Natasha Fatale, Piotr Michael as Fearless Leader, and Daran Norris as Narrator.\n\nThe upcoming Kung Fu Panda: The Paws of Destiny will be overseen by producers Mitch Watson (All Hail King Julien) and Elliott Owen (All Hail King Julien), and Lane Lueras (The Adventures of Puss in Boots). In the show, four panda kids stumble upon a mystical cave beneath Panda Village, accidentally absorbing the chi of ancient and powerful kung fu warriors known as the Four Constellations, and they must realize a destiny to save the world from an evil force. Meanwhile, Po finds himself faced with his biggest challenge yet — teaching the kids how to wield their newfound powers.\n\nNotably, both of these shows will be on Amazon’s streaming service, marking the first time an original series from Dreamworks Animation Television has debuted on Prime Video. Until now, most of Dreamworks’ series have launched on Netflix thanks to a major deal that was signed between the two companies back in 2013.\n\nWhile the Netflix/DWA deal remains in place and will result in additional series like the upcoming She-Ra and The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants, it doesn’t seem likely that Netflix will renew it. The streamer recently launched its own animation studio and will produce more shows in-house, leaving Dreamworks to find new outlets, like Amazon, for its content."
