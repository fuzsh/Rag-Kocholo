        "text": "“All my life I wanted to be pretty. I thought it would change everything.”\n\nHowever, becoming “pretty” can lead to sinister things, or so it’s teased in the just-released trailer for the Netflix film, Uglies.\n\nThe film, adapted from the 2005 sci-fi novel of the same name by Scott Westerfeld, is set in a futuristic world where citizens undergo cosmetic surgery once they turn 16 to turn “pretty” and join the rest of society. However, protagonist Tally (King) learns the exterior is hiding the dark secrets going on internally and embarks on a journey to save her friend who runs away and fights against the society.\n\nKing and Outer Banks star Chase Stokes star alongside Keith Powers, Brianne Tju, Jan Luis Castellanos, Charmin Lee and Laverne Cox.\n\nMcG directs from a screenplay by Jacob Forman, Vanessa Taylor and Whit Anderson. John Davis, Jordan Davis, Robyn Meisinger, McG and Mary Viola produce. Joey King, Jamie King, Westerfeld, John Fox and Jenny Hink exec produce.\n\nIn an interview with Tudum, McG said, “The film’s really about beauty as interior. It’s a commentary on what we’re experiencing today, where so many people can’t just take a photograph and post it on social media. You’ve got to put it through the filter, you’ve got to edit it, you’ve got to do the thing to present this idealized version of beauty. And this is a moment to say, ‘Take a deep breath, work on your inner game, love people for who they are, and accept yourself for who you are,’ and strangely, it’s a much more fruitful way to live.”\n\nUglies will be available to stream on Netflix globally on Sept. 13."
