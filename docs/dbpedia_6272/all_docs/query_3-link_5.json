        "text": "Keith was excellent. His manner was professional and reliable. He was funny and kept the crowd absorbed with his remarks. He also helped to control the night in a timely manner.\n\nCommonwealth Bank of Australia\n\nKeith was absolutely brilliant! We have never laughed so much for a long time.\n\nAgility\n\nKeith was very entertaining, personable and professional. A great time was had by all.\n\nProgress Software\n\nWOW. What a presenter / MC!! Keith ensured our night was a success with his professional manner as MC and his comedy presentations through the night. Everyone enjoyed his act and we are still receiving positive feedback from the night with most people indicating that they hadn’t laughed so much or had such a good night out for years. No hesitation in recommending or using Keith again.\n\nTiffen & Co\n\nDefinitely worth an encore performance at some stage. Highlight of the dinner – probably the highlight of the conference seminar.\n\nAustralian Credit Union Industry\n\nKeith was very approachable and easy to get along with before the performance. His energy and enthusiasm during his performance were contagious and he got the crowd going and had them in stitches. He didn't want to get off the stage he was on such a roll!\n\nNT Cattlemen’s Association\n\nAlthough we were running well ahead of time, Keith did a fantastic show even though he was a little rushed. Brilliant!! Thoroughly entertaining and topical. Great performer.\n\nCentral Coast Soccer Association\n\nKeith was fantastic entertainment for our annual staff party. There wasn’t a dry eye in the house as everyone had tears of laughter rolling down their faces. Highly recommended.\n\nGreater Building Society Limited\n\nKeith was an absolute hit …. Comments from the crowd were that this was the best presentation night they had been to. It is just a shame that he is so unique that we can’t have him back every year! He had to work around some difficult props (a banquet table) but was a thorough professional.\n\nMacquarie Soccer Association\n\nThe entertainer, Keith Scott, was absolutely brilliant. The feedback from our guests was extremely positive and he targeted the audience perfectly (we had a mixed range of ages and there was something for everyone). Keith rang the week prior to the event to finalise any details and everything went smoothly on the night. He was also very accommodating in terms of being involved in the presentation of some awards on the night.\n\nAustralian Stainless Steel\n\nKeith is a genius and a rare talent. An inspirational hidden star. He was a huge hit at our function and appealed to team members of all ages. A fantastic night!!\n\nBoyce Chartered Accountants\n\nKeith is to be complimented on his wonderful presentations. His performance drew many accolades from our guests.\n\nInsulflex\n\nKeith was punctual and looked very presentable. He immediately went into his role as MC which he did admirably. His comedy show was brilliant and entertaining.\n\nCure For Life Foundation\n\nIt was a fantastic night. Everyone is talking about it. Keith was a hit a great MC and a lovely man to talk to. I am so glad we took up your recommendation for him. The roulette table was also well enjoyed and as you can imagine, it became the men’s club while the wives boogied their booties off on the dance floor. Thank you for all you did to help make our event a success.\n\nPacific Medical Imaging\n\nKnocked them out … Fantastic …. They are still talking about him.\n\nCanberra Convention Bureau\n\nKeith had to follow a very entertaining act in the Three Waiters. It would not have been easy for him but his professionalism showed through and he kept the crowd interested and highly amused.\n\nCarbine Club of Port Moresby\n\nKeith is a consummate performer and professional MC. Keith is very personable and put our guests of 240 local and intrastate business people at ease within the first few minutes. His mastery of impersonation and his ability to weave everyday topical events and people into his routine was an absolute hit with everyone. We would highly recommend Keith to anyone looking for that special touch with personality to boot who can carry off your event with ease.\n\nAgriPlex Group\n\nKeith Scott was a major hit at our fundraising dinner. He was the perfect entertainment for our room of CEO’s – his subtle humour was delivered perfectly and all in the room laughed so much. Keith undertook two encores and he could have kept talking all night. We will certainly use Keith again and we have no hesitation in recommending him to this calibre of guest.\n\nCerebral Palsy Alliance\n\nKeith was great. Very professional and easy to work with, Keith read the audience well and had their utmost attention. 10/10!!\n\nCanberra Business Council\n\nOur guests had the opportunity to select from a “menu” of Acts for the after dinner entertainment they preferred, and the selected act would then perform a private routine at their dinner table. The concept of individual entertainment was a confronting style for entertainers & audience alike! For Keith it was a matter of engaging guests in bizarre conversations with US & Australian politicians. The guests were engrossed in what he was saying, laughing and thoroughly enjoying the experience.\n\nCMA Events\n\nKeith was so warm and friendly to our guests….. nothing was too much trouble. He was a pure professional and gentleman.\n\nMid Coast Broadcasters"
