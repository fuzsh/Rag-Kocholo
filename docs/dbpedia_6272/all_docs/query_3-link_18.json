Aforementioned Gloria Wood, Ed Prentiss and mel Blanc.)\n\nThere seems to be some debate as to who's the Levitow UNNTATURAL HISTORY (1959) narrator---Ed Prentiss (<a href=\"http://www.davemackey.com/wb/index\">Dave mackey</a>) or Byron kane (Webb's book)?\n\nHi Steve~\n\nThat's a very good list, it was undoubtedly a great labor of love for you (plus a LOT of typing ). Graham Webb's book does indeed sell for around $125. But his knowledge of cartoon (and old radio) voices is unsurpassed (unless it's by his fellow reseacher Hames Ware, which I doubt), and its all present in Webb's book. His source for the credits for the Disney shorts prior to their mid-'40s adoption of on-screen credits would have to be the Disney archives themselves...But there are oddities and irregularities with these credits just the same... He has T. Hee at Disney too early. Many titles have no storyman listed. And there's almost no mention of Charlie Thorson (5 references for a guy who worked at Disney a couple years, then I believe, at 9 (NINE) other cartoon studios...)\n\nHowever also present in his tome are a lot of unfortunately poor guesses at who wrote/animated/directed on some of the uncredited (or under-credited) classic cartoons... Example: in a fair number of cases he has people animating on MGM cartoons while they were actually still at Walt's!. Likewise he makes Bob Allen the director of Rudy Ising's Oscar winner \"The Milky Way\" (Ising directed it). He has Michael Sasanoff working on Bob Clampett's two Katz unit MM's (instead of Richard H. Thomas). For whatever reason he fails to list the directors for the 1930-33 Harman-Ising/Warner toons Etc. etc. So like so many cartoon references it is marvelous in some respects...and a creator of confusion as regards other things.\n\nBUUUUUT his voice credits in it are superb!! (And intriguingly he ends up correcting information that he and Hames Ware gave to Mike Barrier to write up and publish twenty years earlier, thus Bernice Hansen's last name was actually Hansel, Johnny Murray did all the WB Boskos aside from the first, Cy Kendall did the spider's voice instead of Tex Avery etc.)."
