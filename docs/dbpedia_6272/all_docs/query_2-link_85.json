        "text": "Greetings, culture lovers! Today’s story is about Moose and Squirrel.\n\nNo, not Sam and Dean Winchester, the original Moose and Squirrel: Bullwinkle J. Moose and Rocket J. Squirrel, citizens of Frostbite Falls, Minnesota and stars of the 1959-1964 animated series known as both Rocky and His Friends (1959 to 1961) and The Bullwinkle Show (1961- 1964).\n\nAs narrator William Conrad (who also narrated the original series) says in the 1990 documentary Of Moose and Men: The Rocky and Bullwinkle story, “it was a series unlike anything that had come before. It starred a moronic moose, an all-American squirrel, a pair of bumbling spies and a truly oddball assortment of supporting characters.”\n\nThe spies, who hailed from Pottsylvania, were Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale, Rocky and Bullwinkle’s primary adversaries.\n\nSome of these supporting characters, who appeared in their own segments and didn’t interact with Rocky and Bullwinkle, include Mr. Peabody, a time-traveling dog, and his pet boy, Sherman (they travel through time via the WABAC Machine) and Dudley Do-Right, an incompetent Mountie who somehow manages to get his man.\n\nOther segments include “Fractured Fairy Tales” and “Aesop and Son.”\n\nBullwinkle himself narrated “Poetry Corner” and was “Mr. Know-It-All.”\n\nThe show was created by producer Jay Ward, who’d previous co-created Crusader Rabbit, and animator and writer (and Bullwinkle voice) Bill Scott.\n\nWard and Scott assembled a creative team that, among other things, was known for “world-class puns.”\n\nIn one episode, Rocky and Bullwinkle hire a famous mountain climber (a disguised Boris), “Sir Hillary Pushemoff”, to help them find the mooseberry bush.”\n\nIn another, part one of the six-part “Ruby Yacht” storyline, we’re told that the Frostbite Falls Flotilla Festival is, according to a senior citizen, the major event of the year, “because all the noisy kids are down at Veronica Lake.”\n\nIn that episode, we learn that Bullwinkle found a small boat while taking a walk.\n\n“…he stumbled upon an ancient, rust-encrusted dhow,” the narrator tells us.\n\n“Dhow about that,” Bullwinkle says.\n\nThe narrator then tells us that a dhow is a sailing vessel primarily used in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean.\n\nThe dhow, it turns out after the dirt is washed off, is encrusted with jewels and the name on the bow reads “Omar Khayyam.”\n\nRocky and Bullwinkle first visit the library to find books on boats, but the only ones on the shelf are two copies of The Ancient Mariner by “Al B. Tross.”\n\nThey then take the Dhow to a jeweler, who tells them it’s composed of rubies.\n\n“Yes, sir, it’s rubies.”\n\n“No it isn’t,” Bullwinkle replies, snatching the dhow out of the jeweler’s hands. “It’s mine.”\n\n“Oh my gosh, if it’s made out of rubies…” Rocky starts to say.\n\n“If you’re hesitating for me to finish the line, you’re got a long wait,” Bullwinkle says.\n\nThe shopkeeper doesn’t have the guts to say it, leaving to Rocky to tell us that if the dhow is made out of rubies, “then this must be the ruby yacht of Omar Khayyam.”\n\nGroans from Bullwinkle and the shopkeeper, as well as the audience at home, no doubt.\n\nWhen I first saw that storyline, I hadn’t heard of The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, so I didn’t get reference, but I knew it was horrible pun of some sort.\n\nThere’s also a lot of the “breaking of the fourth wall” in the series. When the narrator reveals to us the true identities of “Sir Hillary Pushemoff” and his associate, “princess Bubbles” (Natasha), Boris turns to the screen and says, “Please. You’re giving away the plot.”\n\nIn another storyline, the narrator tells us Rocky and Bullwinkle have no idea what’s going on.\n\n“They’re not even in on the plot,” Natasha tells Boris.\n\nHowever, a nearby fruit cart proprietor is in on the plot and so he charges Boris $50,000 to buy his cart. When Boris objects, the proprietor summarizes the storyline so far.\n\n“Hey, how come you know all this?” Boris asks.\n\n“What do you think? I don’t watch The Bullwinkle Show?”\n\nBoris gets the better of him, however.\n\n“Boris, he trusted you,” Natasha says.\n\n“Yes, apparently he doesn’t watch the show regularly.”\n\nI mentioned that Bill Scott voiced Bullwinkle. In a 1984 interview, shown in Of Moose and Men, he says that when they recorded the pilot, he and Ward were in the booth with June Foray (voice of both Rocky and Natasha) and Paul Frees (voice of Boris) and Scott asked who was going to voice Bullwinkle. Turns out Ward thought he was.\n\n“And with that remarkable bit of casting, I became the voice of Bullwinkle,” Scott said.\n\nScott also voiced Mr. Peabody and Dudley Do-Right.\n\nIn Of Moose and Men, critic Leonard Maltin describes Scott as the “heart and soul” of those shows.\n\nWhile Ward and Scott didn’t share the same political beliefs (Ward was a conservative and Scott a liberal), they did share an irreverent sense of humor.\n\nOne storyline, entitled “Moosylvania”, concerns an island located between the United States and Canada that both countries fight over. The U.S. insists it’s part of Canada and Canada insists it’s part of the U.S.\n\nMaltin said Ward, who was always publicity minded, bought an island off the coast of Minnesota, named it Moosylvania and started a campaign for statehood.\n\nWard and Publicist Howard Brandy began a nationwide tour that eventually took them to the White House. However, they couldn’t get in because, as Brandy explains in Of Moose and Men, they’d shown up during the Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\n“Nobody paid any attention to us, even though we were very funny,” he said.\n\nThe show also skewered everyone and anyone.\n\n“We offended nations, countries, politicians, school teachers, weather people, no matter what, you know?” Foray says in Of Moose and Men.\n\nMaltin said the Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons were unlike other shows of the time.\n\n“They had an edge to them, they had a satiric thrust to them and they had an irreverence to them that really was unlike anything else we were seeing on T.V.”\n\nThe shows also had a number of topical references. In one “Peabody’s Improbable History” segment, Peabody tells us that he and Sherman are going back to 69 A.D. to “visit one of the world’s most renowned violinists.”\n\n“Jack Benny?” Sherman asks.\n\n“No, that would be 39 A.D., Sherman. Our illustrious fiddler was none other than the emperor of Rome, Nero.”\n\nThis scene includes a visual gag, as the pipe Peabody is lighting bursts into flames as he mentions Nero’s name.\n\nAnother segment has them visiting William Shakespeare, who is working on his play, “Romeo and Zelda.” Mr. Peabody has a few suggestions.\n\nThey also meet one of Shakespeare’s rivals, who has a few critical remarks:\n\n“Bacon!” Shakespeare says.\n\n“With eggs!” Bacon replies, hurling the eggs.\n\nAnother topical reference is in the “Fractured Fairy Tales” segment “Sleeping Beautyland”, in which a prince sells tickets for people to see Sleeping Beauty.\n\n“Awake she’s just another princess,” the prince realizes as he’s about to kiss her. “Asleep, she’s a gold mine.”\n\nIn Of Moose and Men, Director Bill Hurtz says he modeled the prince on Walt Disney and narrator Edward Everett Horton tells us that attractions in the castle included “Moat Land”, “Entrance Hall Land” and “Stair Land.”\n\nThe “Dudley Do-Right” segments featured Dudley, Nell (Foray), the daughter of the post commander, and the villainous Snidely Whiplash (voiced by Hans Conried).\n\nThe segments were done in the style of old silent movies, including “actor credits” for both Dudley and snidely.\n\nRocky and Bullwinkle is comedy gold. Well worth checking out.\n\nCopyright 2021 Patrick Keating."
