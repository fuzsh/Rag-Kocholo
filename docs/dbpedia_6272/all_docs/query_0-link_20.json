        "text": "From Neverpedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nKeith Scott (born 1954, in Sydney, Australia) is a voice-over and voice actor from Australia, one of the primary performers in the 1988 Burbank Films Australia animated adaptation Peter Pan.\n\nHe provided the voice for Bullwinkle in the 2000 motion picture The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle (for which he had been specially flown to the United States several times) and did the voice of the narrator in the feature film George of the Jungle and George of the Jungle 2.\n\nHe has provided voices for various other Australian animated projects including Yoram Gross's \"Dot\" feature films, Blinky Bill, Tabaluga, Skippy: Adventures in Bushtown and Flipper and Lopaka. In the case of Yoram Gross' productions, Scott usually provided all of the male character voices.\n\nScott was a long-time friend of Rocky-and-Bullwinkle creators Bill Scott (no relation) and Jay Ward, and is an expert on the history of Jay Ward Productions. In 2000 he wrote The Moose That Roared: The Story of Jay Ward, Bill Scott, a Flying Squirrel, and a Talking Moose. He has also spent years studying the work of early voice actors, trying to identify performers who originally went uncredited in cartoons.\n\nUses some licensed material by Wikipedia editors."
