        "text": "Sorry, guys. No search function on Anime Superhero means that if this is a duplicated thread it's not actually my fault.\n\nThe Adventures Of Rocky And Bullwinkle \"Stink Of Fear: Chapter One\"\n\nI really shouldn't complain about this show's animation considering the original series' was atrocious, but I think the designs themselves look all wrong. Is this Flash? I would like to actually see a Bullwinkle show with good animation. Is that out of the question?\n\nDaran Norris makes a great Narrator. Perfect casting.\n\nThe rest of the voices sound all right although they probably should have made a bigger effort to match the voices of Bill Scott and June Foray.\n\nInterestingly, this is a full 22 minute cartoon instead of a couple of mini-chapters with Dudley Do-Right, Fractured Fairytales, Aesop And Son, or Mr. Peabody and Sherman shorts to fill out the runtime. I understand Mr. Peabody has his own show on Netflix but I DO miss the other stuff.\n\nI'm an agnostic about this series after the first episode. **1/2.\n\nThe Adventures Of Rocky And Bullwinkle \"Stink Of Fear: Chapter Two\"\n\nIs this the first time Rocky has been shown without his goggles and flight helmet?\n\nGordon Ramsey's character design is as ugly as the dude is in real life.\n\nI like them poking fun at the fact that they don't have to air commercials anymore.\n\nInteresting that each multi-parter seems to have it's own title sequence.\n\nI like that whenever Granwinkle answers the phone, she starts reciting her social security number.\n\nDecent. ***.\n\nThe Adventures Of Rocky And Bullwinkle \"Stink Of Fear: Chapter Three\"\n\nThat did not work. It wasn't even a story. It was random unrelated stuff happening. I know that sort of thing is popular with modern shows but even the old show had s SLIGHT attention span.\n\nToo random for its own good. *1/2.\n\nThe Adventures Of Rocky And Bullwinkle \"Stink Of Fear: Chapter Four\"\n\nI laughed at the design of the Henchbot. Fearless Leader's loving reaction to it is also funny.\n\nPeachfuzz taking that long to realize Rocky and Bullwinkle are morons says she is one too.\n\nLion door? I love that on this show Rocky is as stupid as Bullwinkle is.\n\nHow does Bullwinkle know about chakras?\n\nFor the record, Fearless Leader's plan is super dumb. It says something bad about the Universe when it sounds plausible within the framework of the show.\n\nI like Boris and Natasha fake-being sad over Henchbot being crushed. Oh no.\n\nThe being licked to death puppy torture sounds cute but it is actually quite horrific. A good gag.\n\nI'm starting to get comfortable with this show. ***1/2.\n\nThe Adventures Of Rocky And Bullwinkle \"Stink Of Fear: Chapter Five'\n\nMario Lopez's character design is awful.\n\nI like that Boris fanboys Gordon Ramsey's meanness. Him seeing him as a role model for insults is great.\n\nRocky and Peachfuzz's number getting a standing ovation says this is a stupid universe.\n\nI like that they tied the climax back into the first episode.\n\nRocky being creeped out at how quickly his funeral was arranged was the correct reaction.\n\nThe whole bones solution for the puppy is actually quite gruesome.\n\nPretty good. ***1/2.\n\nThe Adventures Of Rocky And Bullwinkle \"The Dark Side Of The Moose: Chapter One\"\n\nI like the new title sequence.\n\nHow did Boris, Natasha, and Fearless Leader get out of jail?\n\nI like the way Fearless Leader laughs.\n\nI liked Boris and Natasha posing as bored, emo teens. They could pass for convincing.\n\nFirst instance of Bullwinkle pulling something out of a hat. Hint: It's worse than a lion.\n\nI like how Bullwinkle and Rocky jump in fake low gravity.\n\nI like that Rocky refuses to bow to Bullwinkle as the new leader of Mars. Dude has SOME pride.\n\nThat alien is cute. So was the episode. ****.\n\nThe Adventures Of Rocky And Bullwinkle \"The Dark Side Of The Moose: Chapter Two\"\n\nNever name a baby something that rhymes with fart. Somebody needs to get a time machine and notify Homer and Marge Simpson.\n\nIf a person had any friends they wouldn't be at a Qwerf convention. That whole thing was dumb and convenient. I liked Bullwinkle saying he didn't even remember that show. And yes, Rocky admits he's from an old TV show too.\n\nAlso pretty good. ***1/2.\n\nThe Adventures Of Rocky And Bullwinkle \"The Dark Side Of The Moose: Chapter Three\"\n\nRocky loves his mother and she loves him. That is a very good thing to know. I feel weirdly better.\n\nThe episode was fun. ****.\n\nThe Adventures Of Rocky And Bullwinkle \"The Dark Side Of The Moose: Chapter Four\"\n\nI give Tara Strong nothing but grief in my reviews, but her version of Rocky is actually good. Mostly because you can't actually tell it's her. Which was the reason Raven worked all the way back in the original Teen Titans. Strong seems to work best when doing roles she hasn't quite mastered. She's more interesting to listen to at any rate.\n\nDon't blow up Rocky. He'll hate that.\n\nThat Jump Like A Frog Does thing was super annoying.\n\nSolid conclusion. ****.\n\nThe Adventures Of Rocky And Bullwinkle \"Moosebumps!: Chapter One\"\n\nFearless Leader's most evil plot ever is buying a vacation home which makes Boris and Natasha question what they are doing with their lives.\n\nWhy can't Boris stop flipping?\n\nNeat new title sequence.\n\nReal estate! Aaah!\n\nI like that the series seems to be a bit smug that they can now afford new animation for any magic interstitial they choose to make.\n\nThe butler was trying to scare Bullwinkle and Rocky off because he was tired of cleaning up after them.\n\nI like that everybody's hang-up is straightening pictures. Them and Stephen King's Gunslinger. But no lie, crooked pictures are irritating.\n\nMr. Peabody and Sherman cameo!\n\nFunny episode. ****.\n\nThe Adventures Of Rocky And Bullwinkle \"Moosebumps!: Chapter Two\"\n\nThey should probably stop drinking that.\n\nThe Rocky Times is a legitimate publication! Rocky is so cute.\n\nThere was a lot of funny stuff in this one. ****.\n\nThe Adventures Of Rocky And Bullwinkle \"Moosebumps!: Chapter Three\"\n\nI like that the Narrator thinks Fearless Leader is uncool. He totally is.\n\nSquirrel surfing = Bad. Moose shredding = Acceptable. Makes perfect sense to me.\n\nI like that Dr. Lesso asks Bullwinkle if he's a cop.\n\nWho is Boris kidding? He's delicious.\n\nThat's disgusting! None of those birds are using silverware!\n\nHumongalon is a good name for a monster. Gladys? Not so much. No wonder Lesso forgets it.\n\nI still don't get the deal with Fearless Leader's Evil Chicken.\n\nI love that Natasha instantly knows what the monster saddle is and how to operate it. And she's actually jealous of Boris's Bird-Mom locket.\n\nBullwinkle hates Cherry medicine because it never tastes like Cherry. That is the most valid complaint I've ever heard.\n\nFunny. ****.\n\nThe Adventures Of Rocky And Bullwinkle \"Moosebumps!: Chapter Four\"\n\nI like that Bullwinkle has a tattoo that says \"Yes Maybe I Don't Know\". Someone's a Malcolm In The Middle fan.\n\nBorisburg sounds like hell. Fearless Leader will think about it.\n\nI like Rocky saying it's just like that story they're ripping off.\n\nI like Natasha mugging for the camera. I also like that Natasha Heights boasts literacy.\n\nI like the Narrator telling the Monster Bros to go to college and get a life.\n\nThat was good. ****.\n\nThe Adventures Of Rocky And Bullwinkle \"Almost Famoose: Chapter One\"\n\nI loved the musical number at the beginning.\n\nThe new theme title is great too because it has actual vocals.\n\nIt's so funny how everyone is calling Weird Al Yankovic handsome, and talented, and funny. Mario Lopez WISHES he got that kind of press from this show.\n\nI love the minion with the mustache's suggestion on how to make the world a better place. The irony is, had the advice been followed, it would have worked. I also like Fearless Leader realizing the science wasn't there to create a dance to force people to do what he says. He'll think of something.\n\nFunniest moment was Rocky saying the woods were no place for a moose and squirrel.\n\nSolid premiere. ****.\n\nThe Adventures Of Rocky And Bullwinkle \"Almost Famoose: Chapter Two\"\n\nFirst Mr. Know-It-All of the reboot.\n\nI liked the live-action reaction shot of Rocky upon Bullwinkle telling him he's changed.\n\nI love that Fearless Leader can't send attachments. \"I swear that's just what I did!\"\n\nPretty good. ***1/2.\n\nThe Adventures Of Rocky And Bullwinkle \"Almost Famoose: Chapter Three\"\n\nDo you know what I've noticed about Boris Badenov? He ain't so bad.\n\nThe episode was pretty good too. ***1/2.\n\nThe Adventures Of Rocky And Bullwinkle \"Almost Famoose: Chapter Four\"\n\nThis show is patently ridiculous, but it weirdly finds a way to make that work in its favor. When Weird Al is the sanest thing in the episode, you know the ludicrousness is out of control. And it weirdly works. ****.\n\nThe Adventures Of Rocky And Bullwinkle \"The Legends Of The Power Gems: Chapter One\"\n\nThe increasingly elaborate main title sequences continue to impress me.\n\nBullwinkle's so dumb he loses at Tic-Tac-Toe.\n\nI like that the photos and Bullwinkle's wallet are from the original series and the live-action / animated movie.\n\nI like that Boris likes the bell, and I also laughed at him saying they had a shark. It was brief but when Fearless Leader tells Boris and Natasha his plan they both smile like the Grinch's wonderful awful idea.\n\nThe fish and bits ad was nasty.\n\nSolid. ***1/2.\n\nThe Adventures Of Rocky And Bullwinkle \"The Legends Of The Power Gems: Chapter Two\"\n\nRocky saying his and Bullwinkle's string of victories are unearned is pretty on the nose. That's pretty much what this franchise is about.\n\nBonkers doesn't look much like a surfer dude to me.\n\nFunny. ***.\n\nThe Adventures Of Rocky And Bullwinkle \"The Legends Of The Power Gems: Chapter Three\"\n\nI like that the Wind Guardian is a Wacky Waving Inflatable Arm-Flailing Tube Man.\n\nIs this the first time we've seen other talking cartoon squirrels in this franchise? Because they were super cute.\n\nThis episode was cute too. ***1/2.\n\nThe Adventures Of Rocky And Bullwinkle \"The Legends Of The Power Gems: Chapter Four\"\n\nRemember when this story was about shrimp? I love the Narrator.\n\nGet out of town! Bullwinkle was right? He was just makin' stuff up!\n\nNobody actually knows what a tuffet or curds and whey are anymore.\n\nSolid conclusion. The animation was spiffy too. ****.\n\nThe Adventures Of Rocky And Bullwinkle \"Amazamoose And Squirrel Wonder: Chapter One\"\n\nI love how this show keeps knocking the main titles out of the park.\n\nAlso Fearless Leader's laser pointers controlling the cats was the funniest thing the show has ever done. I couldn't stop laughing.\n\nThe live-action cat footage was goofy too.\n\nHow many of his men does Fearless Leader want? 1, 2, ALL OF THEM!!!\n\nInterestingly Amazamoose is before Squirrel Wonder in the actual episode title seen on Amazon Prime, but Squirrel Wonder is first in the title seen in the opening credits.\n\nThat was SO funny. *****.\n\nThe Adventures Of Rocky And Bullwinkle \"Amazamoose And Squirrel Wonder: Chapter Two\"\n\n\"This is turning from a bad situation into a Chad situation.\" Oh, good grief. I laughed at any rate.\n\nI like that Bullwinkle's name can be found on the warning to the suit.\n\nMore Chad, please. Whenever he comes back from adult dodgeball. ****1/2.\n\nThe Adventures Of Rocky And Bullwinkle \"Amazamoose And Squirrel Wonder: Chapter Three\"\n\nI love that they had Mark Hamill playing himself playing Captain Great Guy. His performance as Chillex was funny too.\n\nEvil Chicken is starting to grow on me.\n\nThe \"important massage\" is the type of pun the old show used to do. More of that, please.\n\nThat was funny. ***1/2.\n\nThe Adventures Of Rocky And Bullwinkle \"Amazamoose And Squirrel Wonder: Chapter Four\"\n\nI like that in Opposite World Bullwinkle and Rocky are evil. And since it's opposite world evil wins all the time.\n\nIn Opposite World Bullwinkle's hat trick with the rabbit actually works. TOO well. Plus, the rabbits are totally evil.\n\nI like that Rocky and Bullwinkle repeatedly do the spit-take because the juice is terrible.\n\nI like that the Queen of England's throne is a battle mecha.\n\nA good episode. ****.\n\nThe Adventures Of Rocky And Bullwinkle \"Amazamoose And Squirrel Wonder: Chapter Five\"\n\nThat was great. A fine call-back to the entirety of the first two seasons.\n\nThings were getting very meta when Fearless Leader took over the show and banished Rocky and Bullwinkle and an uncooperative Narrator to the No Show Zone.\n\nI like that they took the time to create a new Fearless Leader title sequence.\n\nI don't know if the show is going to come back or not, but if it doesn't, that would have made a good series finale. *****."
