        "text": ". Rocky:\n\n\"And now, here's something we hope you'll really like.\"\n\n(The preface that introduced many of the series sketches.)\n\nMoose and Squirrel, Boris and Natasha, Dudley Do-Right, Mr. Peabody and Sherman and fractured flicker and fairy tale friends: A toast to you and your contributions to the quality of American life!\n\nThis is an unabashed fan's tribute to the splendid--the unparalleled--animated cult cartoon series, The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show, that featured Rocket J. Squirrel and Bullwinkle Moose and their friends, television characters who captivated many of us in the early '60s and, for some of us, they still do.\n\nRocky, the flying squirrel, and his buddy, the bumbling moose Bullwinkle--—are no more. The creative artist who drew them, Alex Anderson, died on Friday in Carmel, California. He was 90 years old. Jay Ward, the creator of the series (and several others featuring \"friends\" of the squirrel and the moose) died in October, 1989. And several years earlier, in 1985, Bill Scott, head writer and co-producer of the series, and notably, the voice of Bullwinkle, died.\n\nThe show ran on ABC as Rocky and His Friends from 1959 to 1961. It featured the serialized adventures of a courageous flying squirrel who wore flight goggles and a dimwitted moose who faced formidable odds in every encounter with their nemeses Boris Badenov and his side-kick, Natasha Fatale, Slavic spies from an imaginary Soviet satellite, Pottsylvania. The series moved to NBC in 1961, becoming The Bullwinkle Show until it ended in 1964.\n\nAnd in years following, re-runs were frequent, thanks to syndication and cable TV.\n\nRocky and Bullwinkle were joined by Mr.Peabody (a \"bespectacled dog time-traveling back into one non sequitur after another,\" as the New York Times editorial puts it) and Sherman, of course, and Dudley Do-Right, and others. Many notable voices were heard through these characters including Judy Foray, as Rocky, Hans Conreid, voicing the character of Snidely Whiplash in the Dudley Do-Right shorts and also appearing in Fractured Flickers, another creation of Jay Ward and Bill Scott. And, of course, there was American character actor, Edward Everett Horton, who narrated Fractured Flickers.\n\nGenerations came to know and love these clever, spirited, lovable characters who were so often engaged in quixotic struggles. It was a spectacularly grown up series, as the New York Times editorial this week affirmed, \"a cold-war fable crowded with allusions, puns and moments of almost abstract silliness.\"\n\nThere have been none quite like these characters to appear again. So, I offer a tribute to them--for my readers--using the words and scenes from the series, with a special shout-out to my hero, my favorite, the endearing Bullwinkle Moose.\n\n. Here are Rocky, Bullwinkle and friends with Lord Nelson, with Bullwinkle reciting his version of a classic poem at the start.\n\n. And \"Leaping Beauty\" from, you guessed it, Fractured Fairy Tales:\n\n. And, from Rocky, Bullwinkle and Friends, the opening song:\n\n. By all means, visit Bullwinkle's Corner Cartoon Database that features such treats as \"How to be Happy (Though Miserable)\"; \" Little Miss Muffet; and \"The Raven.\"\n\nFor tropes and quotes and other assorted wonders, go to this\n\ngood site\n\n.\n\nA sampling:\n\n---Competition Coupon Madness: Boris and Natasha produce counterfeit box tops to get all the prizes and undermine the world's economy. General Mills (which not only sponsored the show, but owned it outright) was not amused and forced the producers to end the story earlier than planned.\n\n---City of Spies: In the Jet Fuel Formula story arc, Pottslyvania is depicted as a country of spies where everything is secret: All phone numbers are unlisted resulting in blank phone books, and newspapers have nothing but advertisements since all news is too secret to print. The ice cream man also hawks classified documents.\n\n. Memorable quotes and situations can be found here, including these precious exchanges:\n\n[Bulwinkle has been captured by government agents]\n\nRocky: Hey, what's the meaning of this?\n\nAgent: Military intelligence. That phrase mean anything to you?\n\nRocky: It sounds like a contradiction of terms.\n\nBullwinkle: I'd like to apply for a job as an usher?\n\nBoris: What experience have you had?\n\nBullwinkle: I've been in the dark for most of my life.\n\n[Rocky and Bullwinkle have brought an old model ship to an antique dealer]\n\nRocky: Bullwinkle, this ship is covered in rubies and look what's written on the side! O-Mar Khay-yam. Bullwinkle, do you know what this is?\n\nBullwinkle: Well, if you're waiting on me to say it, I won't.\n\nAntique Dealer: Me neither.\n\nRocky: OK, then this must be\n\n[pause]\n\nRocky: \"The Ruby Yacht of Omar Khayyam\".\n\nBullwinkle, Antique Dealer: OOOOH!\n\nNatasha Fatale: Boris, is Moose you said you killed in previous episode?\n\nBoris Badenov: Look, it's his show. If he wants to be hard to kill, let him.\n\nYes, hard to kill, that’s Bullwinkle Moose. Thwarting the bad guys; coming out ahead, even if somewhat confused. Not likely to be another moose like this moose. But, come to think of it, with all my VHS tapes of the series and the wealth of material on the Internet, he doesn’t have to die—ever. Long live Bullwinkle!\n\nThank you, Jay Ward, Alexander Anderson and Bill Scott and all who made this series the unique, wonderful adventure it (still) is."
