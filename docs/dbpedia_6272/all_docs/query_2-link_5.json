        "text": "In this instance, the chief narration for the show was done by William Conrad. He was aided from time to time by Paul Frees and Edward Everett Horton. When Conrad started on the show \"The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends\", he was an adult (41 years old). This American animated television series was one that would originally air from November 1959, to June 1964, on the ABC and NBC television networks.\n\nThe main characters and heroes of the show are Rocket \"Rocky\" J. Squirrel, a flying squirrel, and his best friend Bullwinkle J. Moose, a dim-witted but good-natured moose. Also, most episodes had the scheming villains and fiendish spies Boris Badenov, a pun on Boris Godunov, and Natasha Fatale, a pun on femme fatale.\n\nWith William Conrad, he was a person who really enjoyed doing the narration. It allowed him to be the actual one telling each storyline in each episode to a very young and royal audience. Conrad was able to work for the entire time that 326 segments ran on the air; he never sounded patronizing and was always very natural."
