        "text": "A couple of popular properites from different eras are about to return to TV. Amazon will stream a pair of new series from DreamWorks Animation Television: The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Kung Fu Panda: The Paws of Destiny.\n\nRocky and Bullwinkle is expected to go live May 11 n the U.S., UK, Germany, India, and Japan, while The Paws of Destiny will have a global debut later in the year.\n\nThe world’s best-known flying squirrel and talking moose are back in a serialized comedy about the two goofball best friends who routinely find themselves thrust into harrowing situations but end up saving the day time and again. As Rocky (Tara Strong) and Bullwinkle’s (Brad Norman) innocent and silly ambitions to become rock stars or find lost treasure end up dovetailing with Fearless Leader’s (Piotr Michael) sinister plans to take over the world, our heroes are set on a collision course with his notorious superspies Boris Badenov (Ben Diskin) and Natasha Fatale (Rachel Butera). Daran Norris narrates the series executive produced by Scott Fellows and Tiffany Ward, daughter of the original series producer Jay Ward. Here’s a trailer:\n\nKung Fu Panda: The Paws of Destiny is an adventure series about four panda kids stumble upon a mystical cave beneath Panda Village, accidentally absorbing the chi of ancient and powerful kung fu warriors known as the Four Constellations, they must realize a destiny to save the world from an evil force. Meanwhile, Po finds himself faced with his biggest challenge yet — teaching this ragtag band of kids how to wield their newfound powers. It hails from Emmy-winning All Hail King Julien executive producers Mitch Watson and Elliott Owen, and Lane Lueras (The Adventures of Puss in Boots).\n\nWatch on Deadline"
