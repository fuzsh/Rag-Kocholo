SCOTT\n\nRelated Articles\n\n• Current Film\n\nVideo\n\n• Selected Scenes and Trailer From the Film 'The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle'\n\nForum\n\n• Join a Discussion on Current Film\n\nemember the old \"Rocky and Bullwinkle\" cartoons? If you do, either from their initial run in the early 1960's or their long afterlife in syndication, you will recall that they were short, clever (albeit in a stupid kind of way) and proudly two-dimensional. The drawing and animation were defiantly crude, cheap and fast. The show's low-rent look was as integral to its aesthetic as the narrator's goofy modernist intrusions or the moose's barrage of bad puns and loopy malapropisms.\n\nWhy would anyone want to spin this slight, charming relic of the pop culture past into a high-tech, expensive, effect-jammed feature film like \"The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle\"? As if anxiously aware of its own pointlessness, Des McAnuff's hectic blend of computer animation and live action raises this question obsessively, hoping to distract a credulous audience with knowing showbiz parody.\n\nThe gambit works for about 10 minutes, an all-cartoon segment during which the biographies of Rocky, Bullwinkle and their nemeses over in Pottsylvania, whose escapades were unceremoniously canceled in 1964, are rapidly brought up to date. The squirrel and the moose live in the now deforested town of Frostbite Falls, Minn., supporting themselves with ever-shrinking residual checks, while Boris, Natasha and their Fearless Leader are stymied by the fall of the Iron Curtain, which falls, with appropriate sound effects, on them. The narrator has moved back in with his mother and has been, as he puts it \"reduced to narrating events in his own life.\"\n\nSo far, so good, but then the movie succumbs to its blockbuster ambitions and turns into a noisy, bloated mess. Bloating, in fact, is literally what happens to our heroes, who morph from line drawings into computer-generated 3-D projections that look like half-inflated floats from the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade. Boris and Natasha have slightly better luck: they turn into Jason Alexander and Rene Russo, who do some spirited hamming on the way to cashing their checks, which will be co-signed by Robert De Niro, who plays Fearless Leader and whose company, TriBeCa Films, was among the producers of this film.\n\nHis mouth fixed in a rictus of evil glee, Fearless Leader has apparently borrowed not only Regis Philbin's wardrobe of matching shiny shirt-and-tie combos, but also Mr. Philbin's ambition to dominate the airwaves. Fearless Leader concocts an elaborate plan to stupefy the American public by making television even dumber than it already is. The flagship of this scheme is RBTV -- Really Bad TV -- with headquarters in a New York skyscraper that looks a lot like Rockefeller Center, home of the real-world NBC, the original Rocky and Bullwinkle show's network.\n\nThis is typical of the movie's lame, confused attempts at satire, as is the movie studio called Phony Pictures. \"The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle\" cloaks its essential inanity in warmed-over sub-\"Simpsons\" facetiousness.\n\nThe irreverent, off-the-cuff spirit of Jay Ward's freewheeling original doesn't really make it to the big screen. What should seem plucky, inventive and charmingly silly -- improbable coincidences, elaborate setups for trifling jokes -- feels at once panicky and stale.\n\nThe script, by the playwright Kenneth Lonergan, desperately tries to poke fun at its own ambitions, to signal to the audience that there's nothing here to take seriously, but this feels like cheating. When Fearless Leader proclaims that real and animated characters have never before shared the screen, another says, \"What about that movie 'Roger Rabbit'?\" \"This is completely different,\" thunders the would-be ruler of the world, and you can't help agreeing. That 1988 Robert Zemeckis extravaganza was a good movie.\n\nThe showbiz references -- creaky plays on industry terms like greenlighting and hiatus -- will sail over the heads of most children, as will Mr. De Niro's reprise of Travis Bickle's most famous scene in \"Taxi Driver.\" But then again, \"The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle\" isn't really aimed at today's children. It's another attempt to cash in on baby boomer nostalgia, and to exploit that generation's bottomless appetite for nostalgic self-regard.\n\nHow else to explain the self-congratulatory cameos by John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Jonathan Winters (in multiple roles) and Whoopi Goldberg, whose character is named Judge Cameo? Why else would the filmmakers tack on a syrupy moral about self-knowledge and the inner child?\n\nIt's uttered, with abashed conviction, by the hardworking Piper Perabo, who plays the youngest-looking F.B.I. agent in film history. The original \"Rocky and Bullwinkle\" had sufficient ingenuity to revel in its own dumbness and make an audience reared on Mad magazine feel smart. Their new \"Adventures\" are made by people who clearly think themselves much smarter than their audience. In place of whimsy, it offers cynicism.\n\n\"The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle\" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes some very mild profanity and some real-life re-enactments of cartoon-style mayhem.\n\nTHE ADVENTURES OF ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE\n\nDirected by Des McAnuff; written by Kenneth Lonergan, based on characters developed by Jay Ward; director of photography, Thomas Ackerman; edited by Dennis Virkler; music by Mark Mothersbaugh; production designer, Gavin Bocquet; produced by Jane Rosenthal and Robert De Niro; released by Universal Pictures. Running time: 88 minutes. This film is rated PG.\n\nWITH: Rene Russo (Natasha), Jason Alexander (Boris), Randy Quaid (Cappy Von Trapment), Kel Mitchell (Martin), Kenan Thompson (Lewis), Piper Perabo (Karen Sympathy), Robert De Niro (Fearless Leader), Janeane Garofalo (Minnie Mogul), Carl Reiner (P. G. Biggershot), Jonathan Winters (Whoppa Chopper Pilot) and John Goodman (Oklahoma Cop)."
