        "text": "When it comes to the best sci-fi movies and TV shows on Paramount Plus, there's an abundance to choose from. The streaming platform is home not only to iconic titles from the genre, but its own original content. Each month, the options only expand. It's worth noting that while Paramount Plus used to be the home of everything Star Trek, some of the franchise can no longer be found there.\n\nDo not fear though, there are still a lot of new (and old) Star Trek favorites available on Paramount Plus. We're talking anywhere from the animated reimagining of the Star Trek Universe, \"Star Trek: Lower Decks\" to highly-rated cult icon, \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\".\n\nIt's not all about Star Trek on Paramount Plus though, for sci-fi TV shows and movies, there are cult classics, modern adaptations, and, of course, the famous Halo and Transformers franchises.\n\nIf your watchlist still isn't full after you've journeyed through our list below, be sure to check out our guide to the best sci-fi TV shows of all time and the best sci-fi movies. If you're keen to anticipate what's to come, there are also the upcoming sci-fi TV shows and sci-fi movies for 2024 for all the latest sci-fi content entering our celestial space.\n\nStar Trek\n\n1) 'Star Trek' Original Movies\n\nCast: William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, Nichelle Nichols, George Takei, (more)\n\nDirectors: Robert Wise, Nicholas Meyer, Leonard Nimoy, William Shatner\n\nRelease: 1979-1991\n\nA huge reason for getting Paramount Plus is that it's the home of all things Star Trek and that's the case with the movies. All six original movies from The Motion Picture to The Undiscovered Country are available to stream, although only in the UK and Australia.\n\nWith these movies, you'll see the original crew of the USS Enterprise in all their glory as they set off to save Earth, travel further afield and face new challenges and foes. The six movies are based on the original TV series, feature the same cast and span 12 years, from 1979 to 1991.\n\n2) 'Star Trek' The Next Generation Movies\n\nCast: Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Michael Dorn, Brent Spiner, (more)\n\nDirectors: David Carson, Jonathan Frakes, Stuart Baird\n\nRelease: 1994-2002\n\nIn 'The Next Generation' Patrick Stewart plays the role of Jean-Luc Picard and becomes an instant fan-favorite. The four installments in this era of Star Trek movies see the English actor play the iconic role as the next generation of Star Trek heroes attempt to save Earth, bring peace in different parts of the universe and encounter new and troublesome foes.\n\nThese four movies were generally well received, despite criticism for 'Nemesis'. If you're a fan of Star Trek, they’re well worth the watch. The Next Generation era featured four movies based on the television series spanning from 1994-2002. All four of The Next Generation movies are only available on Paramount Plus in the UK and Australia.\n\n3) 'Star Trek' Kelvin Timeline Movies\n\nCast: Zachary Quinto, Chris Pine, Simon Pegg, John Cho, (more)\n\nDirectors: J.J. Abrams, Justin Lin\n\nRelease: 2009\n\nThis new era of Star Trek movies is referred to as the Kelvin timeline by many, named after the USS Kelvin, a spaceship named after J.J Abrams' grandfather. This series of movies is still ongoing as the fourth installment was set for a December 2023 release, however, has faced continuous delays.\n\nThese films are a revival of the originals and cast much younger actors in the titular roles with updated looks to costumes and the interior of the Enterprise getting its very own revamp. Critically, these movies were well received with the first instalment being arguably the best Star Trek movie to be made.\n\n4) 'Star Trek' The Original Series\n\nCast: William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, Nichelle Nichols, George Takei, (more)\n\nSeasons: Three\n\nFirst Release: 1966\n\nThis is where the (unquestionably) most iconic sci-fi franchise in television history began as the USS Enterprise takes the crew and the science fiction genre boldly where no man has gone before.\n\nJoin Captain Kirk, Spock, Scotty, Sulu, Uhura, Chekov and others as they seek out new life and civilizations. 79 episodes of action, adventure, good humor, and compelling storytelling are all available to stream on Paramount Plus right now.\n\n5) 'Star Trek' The Next Generation\n\nCast: Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Michael Dorn, Brent Spiner, (more)\n\nSeasons: Seven\n\nFirst Release: 1987\n\nSome will argue that The Next Generation is as iconic as the original series - it certainly helped the franchise stand the test of time. Here we have instantly recognizable characters including Jean-Luc Picard, Worf, Geordi La Forge, Data/Lore and more.\n\nThe new crew set off on new adventures around a hundred years after the events of the original series. More compelling storytelling, good humor, action and adventure mean you get to sit back and enjoy USS Enterprise action for more than 170 episodes.\n\n6) 'Star Trek' Deep Space Nine\n\nCast: Avery Brooks, Rene Auberjonois, Cirroc Lofton, Colm Meaney, (more)\n\nSeasons: Seven\n\nFirst Release: 1993\n\nOne of the more, if not the most, underappreciated and underrated entries into the Star Trek universe, Deep Space Nine is set in the 24th century. Unlike its predecessors, it is set on a space station rather than a traveling ship. It's also the first Star Trek series to have an African American actor as the central character.\n\nLike The Next Generation, there's seven series for you to enjoy here and it's likely that you will as it was nominated for Emmy Awards in every year of its run. Throughout the series you'll see stories of adventure, war, and conflict all tied in with the usual humor and good storytelling.\n\n7) 'Star Trek' Voyager\n\nCast: Kate Mulgrew, Robert Beltran, Roxann Dawson, Ethan Phillips, (more)\n\nSeasons: Seven\n\nFirst Release: 1995\n\nReleased to run at the same time as Deep Space Nine, Star Trek Voyager also got seven seasons and took the franchise into the new millennium. The series was generally well-received and was notable (along with its overall quality) for having a more gender-balanced cast.\n\nThe adventures start as USS Voyager departs Deep Space Nine in search of a missing ship in the Badlands. From there, the ship is overrun by a powerful energy and the surviving crew are trapped tens of thousands of lightyears from Earth.\n\n8) 'Star Trek' Enterprise\n\nCast: Scott Bakula, John Billingsley, Jolene Blalock, Dominic Keating, (more)\n\nSeasons: Four\n\nFirst Release: 2001\n\nEnterprise, as it was initially known, is set about 100 years before the events of the original series. It's a prequel that follows the adventures of Earth's first starship that can travel at warp five and its crew.\n\nThe show received mixed reaction across its four seasons with a slump in season two before picking back up. The first two seasons showcase standalone episodes while more plot-driven adventures are had in three and four. It can definitely be argued that the show fought for survival by introducing plot improvements and raising the rate of enjoyment before it was canceled.\n\n9) 'Star Trek' Discovery\n\nCast: Sonequa Martin-Green, Doug James, Anthony Rapp, Emily Coutts, (more)\n\nSeries: Five\n\nFirst Release: 2017\n\nAnd so, onto the new era of Star Trek television series, which has to be said, is pretty good. Star Trek Discovery is set on board the starship Discovery and takes place ten years before the events of the original series. Without giving too much away, the Discovery does travel to the 32nd century, which is the setting for the proceeding series.\n\nStar Trek Discovery is notable for its widely diverse cast and genuinely good quality storytelling. It's been nominated for - and won - numerous Primetime Emmy Awards as well as receiving other accolades.\n\n10) 'Star Trek' Picard\n\nCast: Patrick Stewart, Alisson Pill, Michelle Hurd, Santiago Cabrera, (more)\n\nSeasons: Three\n\nFirst Release: 2020\n\nPatrick Stewart reprises his role as Jean-Luc Picard for a television series beginning 20 years after the events in Star Trek: Nemesis. Each season explores different aspects of the character in his old age as he is deeply affected by the death of 'Data' and the destruction of 'Romulus.'\n\nIt's another well-received entry into the Star Trek universe, one we like a lot too, and the good news is that there are three seasons to enjoy on Paramount Plus.\n\n11) 'Star Trek' Lower Decks\n\nCast: Tawny Newsome, Jack Quaid, Noël Wells, Eugene Cordero, (more)\n\nSeasons: Four (ongoing)\n\nFirst Release: 2020\n\nThis animated entry into the Star Trek universe is a bit different but refreshing. While most of the Star Trek series center around senior officers or captains onboard a starship, 'Lower Decks' focuses on those who work below deck, carrying out cog-churning jobs.\n\nThis series is set in the 24th century and focuses on the low-ranking officials on board one of Starfleet's least important starships, the USS Cerritos. There are four seasons out now on Paramount Plus, with a fifth and final season premiering on October 24.\n\n12) 'Star Trek' Strange New Worlds\n\nCast: Melissa Navia, Anson Mount, Ethan Peck, Jess Bush, (more)\n\nSeasons: Two (ongoing)\n\nFirst Release: 2022\n\nStar Trek: Strange New Worlds is a prequel to the original series, set in the decade leading up to the adventures of Captain Kirk, Scotty, Sulu et al. As well as being a prequel, this series is also a spin-off from Star Trek: Discovery which sees some of the same characters explore new worlds onboard the USS Enterprise.\n\nHalo\n\n1) 'Halo'\n\nCast: Pablo Schreiber, Shabana Azmi, Natasha Culzac, Olive Gray, (more)\n\nSeasons: Two\n\nFirst Release: 2022\n\nOkay, so this section is a little short but worthy of its own section nevertheless. Paramount Plus is where you can stream both seasons of Halo, based on the iconic video game of the same name.\n\nThis sci-fi action series follows the adventures of Master Chief as he leads his team of Spartans from a powerful alien threat that is hellbent on destroying humanity. Unfortunately, Variety reports the live-action series has been canceled, meaning there's no hope of a third season.\n\nTransformers\n\n1) 'Transformers'\n\nCast: Shia LaBeouf, Megan Fox, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, (more)\n\nDirector: Michael Bay\n\nRelease: 2007\n\nThe first Transformers and the first of five with Michael Bay directing, this movie well and truly propelled the franchise into motion. Transforming (uh-hum) the original 1986 animated movie into something much, much bigger, teen Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) stumbles upon Autobot Bumblebee while looking for his first car. Unbeknownst to him, he's about to embark on a journey of war as the battle between the Decepticons and Autobots crashes onto Earth.\n\nWhile it's not the top-rated Transformers entry by critics, it shaped everything to come, as you’re about to discover with the five other movies on our list. Be sure to check out how to watch the Transformers movies in chronological order or by release.\n\n2) 'Transformers' Revenge of the Fallen\n\nCast: Shia LaBeouf, Megan Fox, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, (more)\n\nDirector: Michael Bay\n\nRelease: 2009\n\nThe sequel to the first movie in the Transformers series, Revenge of the Fallen, is finally coming to Paramount Plus in the US in August. In this entry, we follow Sam Witwicky once again, whose hopes for a normal life are quickly thwarted. Cryptic symbols begin to fill his head which drag him right back into the Transformers' war.\n\nSam finds himself personally targeted by the Decepticons for what he knows and what it could mean for the future of the bots. It’s a revenge arc at the end of the day and the once-defeated robots are returning in a bid to destroy the Sun and end human life on Earth, the planet that wronged them.\n\n3) 'Transformers' Dark of the Moon\n\nCast: Shia LaBeouf, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, (more)\n\nDirector: Michael Bay\n\nRelease: 2011\n\nFollowing on from Revenge of the Fallen, Dark of the Moon continues the story of this saga as the Autobots learn of a mysterious spacecraft hidden on the moon and race against the Decepticons to reach it and learn its secrets. Just like the other films in the saga, you'll get plenty of sci-fi action in this story.\n\n4) 'Transformers' Age of Extinction\n\nCast: Mark Wahlberg, Nicola Peltz Beckham, Jack Reynor, Stanley Tucci, (more)\n\nDirector: Michael Bay\n\nRelease: 2014\n\nThis installment sees Mark Wahlberg play the lead role for the first time in the franchise as Age of Extinction offers up more action, more sci-fi cinematography and more transformers.\n\nHumanity turns to a bounty hunter to help with their pursuit of Optimus Prime, but when the Autobots learn of this, they turn to a mechanic and his family for help.\n\n5) 'Transformers' The Last Knight\n\nCast: Mark Wahlberg, Anthony Hopkins, Josh Duhamel, Laura Haddock (more)\n\nDirector: Michael Bay\n\nRelease: 2017\n\nThe last of the Michael Bay-era Transformers movies, The Last Knight did not impress critics or the audience. A 16% critic score and 43% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes is a very telling sign. Nonetheless, there's a history to unfold on Earth that tells fans of the franchise a lot more about the Decepticons and Autobots.\n\nIt's a trip you may not be expecting with lots of King Arthur, Merlin, an English Lord, and an Oxford professor leading the story this time round. A step away from the usual action, but with Optimus Prime on their own separate mission of discovery, it shapes another adventure into defending Earth and remaining victorious in war.\n\n6) 'Bumblebee'\n\nCast: Hailee Steinfeld, Jorge Lendeborg Jr., John Cena, (more)\n\nDirector: Travis Knight\n\nRelease: 2018\n\nBumblebee, although the sixth entry in the franchise, actually sets itself in the prequel timeline of the movies and, as such, is set only a year after the original animated series. For this thread, director Travis Knight picks the origin story of Bumblebee as its story.\n\nCharlene \"Charlie\" Wilson (Hailee Steinfeld) stumbles upon Autobot scout B-127 in a junkyard, hiding out after fleeing the war on Cybertron. Charlie befriends him and calls him \"Bumblebee\". Unfortunately, despite the fuzzy nickname, trouble has followed him to Earth and battle commences.\n\n7) 'Transformers' Rise of the Beasts\n\nCast: Anthony Ramos, Dominique Fishback, Luna Lauren Velez, (more)\n\nDirector: Steven Caple Jr.\n\nRelease: 2023\n\nRise of the Beasts was a return to the Transformers franchise, five years after Bumblebee, and it came with a big change. No more Michael Bay and no more previous timeline.
