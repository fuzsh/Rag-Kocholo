        "text": "By Peter Hummers on May 16, 2024\n\nIn the beginning (1950) was Crusader Rabbit, a four-minute cartoon (the first created specifically for television), produced by Alex Anderson and Jay Ward. When they lost the rights to the Crusader Rabbit character in a legal fight, Ward pursued an unsold series idea, The Frostbite Falls Revue, featuring characters destined to become household names in households with‚Äîand without‚Äîchildren, Rocky the Flying Squirrel and Bullwinkle the Moose.\n\nTL;DR: The classic Rocky and Bullwinkle show has its own 24/7 TV channel on the Xumo Play app for Roku, Fire Stick, Android etc.\n\nTHE BULLWINKLE SHOW\n\n/Amazon /Xumo Play /‚≠ê7.8/10 /Intros. /1959-1964 /TVG\n\nProduced by Jay Ward Productions, The Bullwinkle Show was a cartoon variety show, the main feature being the serialized adventures of the flying squirrel Rocket J. (‚ÄúRocky‚Äù) Squirrel and moose Bullwinkle J. Moose. Their antagonists were the two Russian-like spies Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale, both working for Fearless Leader.\n\nSupporting segments include ‚ÄúDudley Do-Right‚Äù (a parody of old-time melodrama, which kids in 1960 still recalled), ‚ÄúPeabody‚Äôs Improbable History‚Äù (a dog named Mr. Peabody and his boy Sherman traveling through time), and ‚ÄúFractured Fairy Tales‚Äù (classic fairy tales retold in comic fashion), among others. The blanket title The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends was used for home video releases more than 40 years after the series originally aired and not when the show was televised; television airings of the show were broadcast under the titles of Rocky and His Friends from 1959 to 1961, The Bullwinkle Show from 1961 to 1964, and The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show (or The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle) in syndication.\n\nThe Bullwinkle Show is known for quality writing and wry humor, mixing puns, cultural and topical satire, and self-referential humor, appealing to adults as well as educating children. It was also one of the first cartoons whose animation was outsourced; storyboards were shipped to Gamma Productions in Mexico, and it has a very unpolished look. The animation is extremely limited even by television animation standards at the time; still, the series has long been rightly held in high esteem.\n\nDuring its original run this writer was an adolescent, and for me and my friends The Bullwinkle Show was appointment viewing. But when I went to school, history and ‚Äúsocial studies‚Äù was taught; I seriously doubt if today‚Äôs adolescents would understand any of it.\n\nTHE ADVENTURES OF ROCKY & BULLWINKLE\n\n/Amazon /Streaming /üçÖ42%üçø21% /Trailer /2000 /PG\n\nProducer-actor Robert De Niro‚Äôs (The Deer Hunter, Mean Streets, Ronin etc.) live-action homage to Rocky and Bullwinkle was a box-office MOAB (mother of all bombs), despite his presence (as Fearless Leader) and that of Jason Alexander (Seinfeld), as Boris Badenov; Rene Russo as Natasha Fatale; Carl Reiner; Jonathan Winters; John Goodman and others. June Foray, the original voice of Rocky, was even in the cast (as Rocky).\n\nDirector Des McAnuff wanted ‚Äúto maintain the simplicity of the original characters,‚Äù but he also wanted Rocky and Bullwinkle to exist in three dimensions, to go with the three-dimensional real-world space they occupy in most of the film. As a result, the animators adapted the characters into the modeling and movements of 3D animation but incorporated cel-shaded techniques to help maintain the cartoony overall rendering in their models. The plot involved Boris and Natasha using CDI (‚ÄúComputer-Degenerating Imagery‚Äù), a weapon that can trap cartoon characters in the Internet.\n\nIn my opinion, it‚Äôs so bad it‚Äôs good. Really, check it out!\n\nTHE ADVENTURES OF ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE\n\n/Amazon /Streaming /üçÖ100%üçø80% /Trailer /2018 /TV-Y\n\nThis is an American animated television series produced by DreamWorks Animation Television, a reboot of the 1959‚Äì64 series. It debuted on May 11, 2018, on Amazon Prime Video, being DreamWorks Animation Television‚Äôs first series to air on a streaming service other than Netflix.\n\nI don‚Äôt like it (but Rotten Tomatoes does). At first glance, the characters are redrawn, unpleasantly, Rocky especially so: his face is a rounded square in which all his features are crammed. Bullwinkle resembles the classic moose a little more, but looking at the animation and scenery, it looks like the intention was to suggest the crude-in-the-day Mexican animation of the original series, although it‚Äôs very sophisticated. (This animation was done in Canada.)\n\nThe voice cast is all new, and to grab the new audience in the absence of the original show‚Äôs charms, Gordon Ramsay, Mario Lopez, ‚ÄúWeird Al‚Äù Yankovic, and Mark Hamill play ‚Äúthemselves.‚Äù\n\nThere are terrible, noisy musical numbers to take our minds off of the absence of puns and topical humor. There‚Äôs a lot of screaming. (The TV-Y rating means that the show is ‚Äúappropriate for all ages.‚Äù Hmm.)\n\nI‚Äôll stick with Jay Ward‚Äôs sophisticated 1959 masterpiece, which I can see at any hour of the day or night on Xumo Play.\n\nSources include The AFI Catalogue of Feature Films, and Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 4.0 DEED).\n\n(Pete Hummers is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to earn fees by linking Amazon.com and affiliate sites.
