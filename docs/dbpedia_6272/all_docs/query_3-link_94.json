        "text": "Shane confirmed All Elite\n\nBy Scott Keith on 18th February 2022\n\nCome on, they’re doing Heart Association crossover right now, Shane looks like he’s going to have a coronary all the time…WAKE UP SHEEPLE! Do I have to draw you a diagram?\n\nRants\n\nRefs\n\nBy Scott Keith on 18th February 2022\n\nHi Scott,\n\nAs good as the Sammy vs. Darby match was on Dynamite, I kept finding myself distracted by Bryce Remsburg physically reacting to EVERY SINGLE MOVE as if he was selling the moves himself. I notice this every time he refs a match, actually, but that one was particularly distracting. Do you notice that at all? I feel like the best referees shouldn't be noticed unless it's part of the story of the match. I actually think he's a really good referee when he's not overdramatically hamming it up as if he's supposed to be one of the focal points. But if my attention is drawn to his antics instead of what the wrestlers are doing, I feel like he's actively taking away from the match. (And if you haven't noticed this before, I apologize for bringing it to your attention because you won't be able to unsee it from this point forward.)\n\nNobody pays attention to referees. Anyone who gets knocked out by a shoulder tackle isn’t worthy of mention.\n\nRants\n\nCody and Shane\n\nBy Scott Keith on 18th February 2022\n\nHey Scott,\n\nLove the blog, keep up the great work.\n\nConnecting the dots here….\n\nHHH is out at NXT\n\nShane has a crazy, unexpected outburst, completely out of nowhere and has left the promotion. The fact that he’s a McMahon makes it notable because I already thought he was gone.\n\nCody leaves AEW due to being in no man’s land.\n\nAre these three getting together with everyone that’s been cut and starting another promotion from the ground up?\n\nBack in 1998, Bret coming back to WWE sounded way crazier than this.\n\nThoughts?\n\nMaybe they’re backing that Adam Scherr and EC3 project.\n\nRants\n\nShadows at (almost) 25\n\nBy Scott Keith on 18th February 2022\n\nHi Scott, just watched Wrestling With Shadows again after some years and it’s still a masterpiece, although one that gets sadder and sadder with the passing of time. What are your favorite portions of the film and who are some of your favorite characters? I loved the profile on Stu, (“Have some discipline, have some discipline.”) especially the part where you could hear him chuckling when stretching out that poor guy. And I felt so much for Helen, as you could see how much she despised the business. In a sad way, Montreal made Bret into sort of a household name, but if Montreal never happens, how do you think we remember him?\n\nI think Bret would have kind of faded into the background as an office guy and it’s actually kind of a weird blessing to his legacy that it happened to him. Kind of like the “may you live in interesting times” curse.\n\nRants\n\nDynamite at 869K\n\nBy Scott Keith on 17th February 2022\n\nhttps://mobile.twitter.com/BrandonThurston/status/1494414990085955586\n\nThis show is now getting lower ratings than shows before Punk rejoined, even though the episodes have generally (IMO) been pretty awesome.\n\nWTF is going on? Normally after a well publicized departure ratings would go *up* and not down!! I don’t get it anymore man. Why can’t we have good things?!!\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\nWell they had a good run.\n\nRants\n\nNTX Level Up\n\nBy Scott Keith on 17th February 2022\n\nAny chanche of you reviewing it?\n\nA chance? Sure.\n\nSo probably not a good chance.\n\nRants\n\nSuper Bowl Belts\n\nBy Scott Keith on 17th February 2022\n\nHow awkward would it be if the Jaguars won the Super Bowl, to see TK scrambling to grab the traditional WWE Super Bowl Champion belts away from the players? Who are we kidding, the Jags have less chance of winning the Super Bowl than the Leafs have of ever winning the Stanley Cup. How bout it?\n\nApparently the guy who owns the Rams is the one who Vince beefed with years ago. So he might not get a belt either.\n\nRants\n\nUseful, but not necessary\n\nBy Scott Keith on 17th February 2022\n\nHi Scott, with Cody’s pretty shocking leave from AEW, it got me thinking about Hogan and WCW. With all that Cody had done helping build AEW, they had no issue with him leaving. With all Hogan had done for WCW, for better and worse…when would you have cut him loose?\n\nRight after putting over Goldberg. He made a star and should have disappeared.\n\nRants\n\nBrock in the Chamber\n\nBy Scott Keith on 17th February 2022\n\nWhich is more likely:\n\n1) That Brock Lesnar is one of the first two in the Chamber and beats everyone before the next pod opens, or\n\n2) That Brock Lesnar is the last into the Chamber and pins all five guys in less time than it would take for the next pod to open?\n\nWell he has to lose, right? So obviously he goes in first and then gets pinned in 30 seconds so he can maximize his payday.\n\nRants\n\nCody Rhodes and the biggest mistake AEW made (IE no competing for the World Title)\n\nBy Scott Keith on 16th February 2022\n\nCan we agree that the whole “Cody can't challenge for the world title” thing was a HUGE freaking mistake AEW made, in hindsight?\n\nCody should have beaten Moxley for the belt then had a long run, with Cody as a Stan Smith from American Dad type anti-hero who does whatever he wants but ultimately does the right thing with the proper browbeating. Let him feud with Omega as part of a “OK, no one gives a flying fuck about Kenny so we are starting 100% from scratch reintroducing Kenny to American fans who don't give a shit about Japan and think Bullet Club was just AJ Styles and the Good Brothers Horsemen Cover Band Stable” and get Kenny over as a heel that way.\n\nNot to mention it would have meant Cody and a face version of FTR hooking up to fight Omega and the Bucks, along with Adam Hangman Page versus Cody with Page going full heel Millennial villain who drinks and does evil shit like terrorizes Brandi, Dustin, Arn as part of a campaign against Cody to weaken him before facing him for the world title, with MJF being the heel whisperer who gets Page to turn evil as part of his long game war with Cody to get the belt off of Cody.\n\nJesse\n\nOK, Jesse's weighed in on the Cody departure, time to shut the topic down for good now.\n\nRants\n\nMansoor\n\nBy Scott Keith on 16th February 2022\n\nSeems bizarre that they haven't booked him for Saturday's show. What's more likely: Vince has given up on using him even for the Saudi shows, or Vince is confusing him with Mustafa Ali?\n\nThey've been waiting to finalize the Cody deal so that the American Nightmare can debut in Jeddha and put him over.\n\nRants\n\nRhodes situation Rabbit Hole\n\nBy Scott Keith on 16th February 2022\n\nWith all the confirmed and unconfirmed news regarding Cody, I don't think we will have concrete story until we see where he shows up next. That being said, if his next step is WWE, what would be lucrative to him? as uneven his AEW run has been, Cody seems like a very smart buisnessman. With WWE's history of handeling many things recently, the only really standout that you or someone on your blog mentioned is he might have been offered a lot of power with wwe film production company, and thats where he wants to put his feet firmly into.\n\nBut, for the nutjob in me, I can't imagine the checkbook opening that much in wwe for him, wrestling wise, especially with the Budget cuts. Having said that, is the big game plan for wwe to cut the (what they see as)low-to-mid carder talent to offer big money to AEW talents that will really make headlines when their current contracts expire? (Cody, Bucks, Omega, MJF top of my list, and to a lesser extent, bring back Mox, Jericho etc)? What the fuck does that mean? Has everyone gone fuckin' nuts? What the fuck happened to that guy's head?\n\nWell this email took a dark turn.\n\nDon't worry, WWE has fired plenty of great talent that AEW can sign in response and sell t-shirts with.\n\nRants\n\nCody leaving – a win-win for all?\n\nBy Scott Keith on 16th February 2022\n\nIs Cody leaving AEW the rare case where both sides make out better for the deal? Like a high quality sports trade?\n\nWWE is desperately low on acts that move the needle. Their fans need a jolt since everyone has been leaving. Sure Vince may overpay, but it's a big move that obviously gets people talking and Cody makes a ton of money.\n\nAEW definitely didnt need Cody anymore – he was an asset, of course, but he wasn't a main event guy anymore.\n\nIt's just felt more and more like Cody was out of place. At Full Gear, that show was loaded with great matches and the one that stuck out was the Cody tag. I was at the DC show when he gave that rambling ladder promo, and it felt like he was out there giving an old IN THIS BUSINESS promo Hunter used to do, whereas Moxley's promo earlier that night was quicker, better, and felt more like AEW.\n\nAt first, I was stunned by the news. But after thinking about it for 24 hours, it seems like it's in the best interest for all parties, and that almost never happens in pro wrestling. Your thoughts?\n\nHey, Bron Breakker needs guys to work with and put him over and NXT needs viewers pretty desperately, plus we know Cody loves living in Orlando, so he'll fit in great down there! They can even have him present the Dusty Rhodes Cup to the winning team of the sleepy girl and Crazy Dakota to really put it over. I see big things ahead for young Cody.\n\nRants\n\nHBK + Jose = WTF\n\nBy Scott Keith on 15th February 2022\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nFirst time, long time. As I was reading the Observer Flashback, I was reminded of a question that I probably already know the answer to (Vince gonna Vince). What was the logic behind pairing decidedly-less-cool-since-he-went-babyface Shawn with who, at the time, I thought was his Mexican grandfather?\n\nCombination of stuff. Mostly, as noted, Vince not really understanding what people wanted to see out of Shawn Michaels.\n\nRants\n\nItd be a Stone Cold Surprise of a comeback\n\nBy Scott Keith on 15th February 2022\n\nKevin Owens running down Texas on RAW?Sure\n\nhope a rattlesnake doesnt take offence and comes out of retirement for Mania to defend its honour….\n\nAustin really doesn't need to do that. He's got more money than he'll ever need in a lifetime, he can do whatever he wants with his life, and he's probably feeling healthier than he's been in decades. Why can't they just make a new star so that they can stop literally pulling people out of retirement? Well, if that's what Austin wants to do, good for him I guess? I just find it sad.\n\nRants\n\nOnline Onslaught’s Rick Scaia\n\nBy Scott Keith on 15th February 2022\n\nHello Scott,\n\nI've just seen on Twitter that the gentleman behind the old Online Onslaught website has had his health turn major heel on him for the second time in eight years. Back in the late 90's I discovered your writing, plus that of MiCasa and CRZ, on his site, or\n\nat least at the same host. I'm nowhere near social media literate to spearhead any campaign, but there very well may be a few of us here who remember him and would like to help him in some manner. His Twitter handle is The OOriginal Rick @OOWrestling.\n\nPoor guy's stuck watching RAW and posting about it on Twitter. I know that would be a hellish existence for anyone.\n\nRants\n\nJay White\n\nBy Scott Keith on 14th February 2022\n\nWhy do you hate him so much?\n\nHe’s Justin Credible with better matches and uglier facial hair. Also New Zealand sounds like a made up country. If AEW needs to push annoying pasty white guys they’ve already got a bunch under contract without needing to import them.\n\nRants\n\nBig Dave\n\nBy Scott Keith on 14th February 2022\n\nHey Scott, if 2009 Heel Batista could jump to AEW, how fast would you put the world title on him?\n\nHe’ll have to learn how to do Texas death matches.\n\nRants\n\nWM18 Re-Book\n\nBy Scott Keith on 14th February 2022\n\nHey Scott,\n\nConsidering Rock was basically done with the business and the crowd reaction, you think it would've made more sense for Hogan to have gone over in WM18?\n\nNot a huge issue but Hogan was going to be the one with the title shot & you probably could've extended the nostalgia tour for a couple of months.\n\nᐧ\n\nYou’re asking ME if I think that HULK HOGAN should have gone over the ROCK? Are you new here? NO. Just no.\n\nRants\n\nHOOK on WWE\n\nBy Scott Keith on 13th February 2022\n\nTranspose HOOK into WWE this entire time & imagine him getting over organically the same way he has in AEW.\n\nWhat would WWE Creative do with him next?\n\nSend him to NXT to do jobs to the sleepy girl because Vince would be like “HA HA THAT KID HAS BEDHEAD, BRUCE!”\n\nRants\n\nBig Show in 1999\n\nBy Scott Keith on 13th February 2022\n\nBig Show had a pretty cool debut at St. Valentine's Day Massacre in 1999, and then kind of floundered on and off with face and heel turns during the year. Do you think it was McMahon not knowing what he had, was it Russo's crash TV style that just didn't work,\n\nor was it just bad creative all around? What would have been the best way to book him after his debut?\n\nThat was 100 percent on Vince because he knew exactly how to book Andre and even mocked WCW for not booking Wight properly. You keep him off TV and make sure he’s an attraction that people have to pay to see.\n\nRants\n\nDeep Roster\n\nBy Scott Keith on 13th February 2022\n\nHi Scott,\n\nIs the AEW roster super deep or do they just book better so they seem to have more stars?\n\nThe fact that they have to shoot so many episodes of Dark to give people work indicates that it’s a pretty deep roster.\n\nRants\n\nThe one thing AEW & WWE do that i absolutely hate\n\nBy Scott Keith on 11th February 2022\n\nGood morning sir! Hope you family is safe from the convoy! I tune into AEW right at 8pm. Its been many, many years since i tuned in right from the start on a raw and smackdown, and one of the reasons why is what AEW did last night. I f'n!!!!!!!! HATE a in-ring promo to open the show. I love MJF, love the arrogance, but please put those anywhere BUT the beginning and ending of a show. Now they're are few, rare examples (Punks return and…… i'll have to really think about it). I'm here for the wrestling first and foremost.\n\nOne more to pile on that, whoever is organizing the format for tv & ppv for AEW really needs to step back and look at the overall format before air-time. On dynamites there has been alot of promos/interviews back to back. On ppvs there have been more than one of the same style match, some times also back to back! (examples, first 2 matches at All Out & 2 multi-man street fights at Full gear)\n\nStay safe, keep up the great work!\n\nI agree with your hot take sir. They need to start putting the Bucks in the openers again on a regular basis.\n\nRants\n\nMike Tenay\n\nBy Scott Keith on 11th February 2022\n\nGiven how opinionated wrestling fans are, I don’t recall much discussion on Mike Tenay. No hatred. No love. Nothing. It’s like he never existed, and that’s hard to do with the years under his belt behind a wrestling microphone.\n\nAny publicity is good publicity, but I don’t recall Mike getting any at all. Am I missing a period of time where the blog was just blowing up on Tenay, or is he just the human equivalent of Pepsi? Not good, not bad, and you’ll drink him if you have to?(Unless you’re CM Punk, of course)\n\nI think it’s more that Tenay was kind of miscast as a lead announcer in TNA and really the WCW role where he could pop in as the Iron Professor was his best one. As a lead guy he just wasn’t memorable.\n\nRants\n\nDouble Turns\n\nBy Scott Keith on 11th February 2022\n\nSeeing as how there’s only been 2 in wwe history, was the Bret Hart/Steve Austin double turn actually planned? Or was it a happy accident?\n\nIt was 100% planned, yes.\n\nRants\n\nArticle on Keith Lee/Jay White Debuts\n\nBy Scott Keith on 10th February 2022\n\nHey Scott, longtime fan, blah blah blah…\n\nStarted a wrestling site and I’ve love to get some feedback.\n\nThanks, Chris.\n\nI can always appreciate someone working “unfuckupable” into an article. Good job.\n\nRants\n\nRumble in the Thunderdome\n\nBy Scott Keith on 10th February 2022\n\nHey Scott. Here’s one I don’t think anyone has brought up yet. This year’s rumble match was so boring and almost every decision made seemed to be the wrong one. Whether that’s ALL on Shane who knows but it got me thinking. Last years Rumble was dare I say fun in comparison? The surprises were at least surprising (Hurricane, Carlito, Kane and biggest one Christian) and made for some fun moments (Team Hell No and E & C reunion) or at least were harmless. The overall story was one they’ve told before but it was still a story (Edge going coast to coast to win) and there was no one I would consider completely useless. This year had BAD BUNNY and Shane as surprises, Knoxville as a wasted celebrity appearance that didn’t even do anything memorable, and a Lesnar win we all saw coming. My question is did you ever think we’d live in a world where a rumble in a real dome in St Louis with real fans would make us miss a rumble in front of no fans in the thunder dome?\n\nNothing would ever make me miss the Thunderdome. That was a miserable run of shows and overstayed it’s usefulness by a good three months.\n\nRants\n\nWWE and David Benoit\n\nBy Scott Keith on 10th February 2022\n\nHey Scott,\n\nChris Benoit's son David is obviously someone who has dreams of being a successful wrestler. I know he signed with RCW back in August, but really hasn’t been discussed since. He’s been training for a while, but has obviously hit some roadblocks along the\n\nway due to his father, unfortunately.\n\nHypothetically, if he were to become good enough, do you see WWE giving him any sort of shot in their development system? Or do you think WWE would cower away from him due to any PR nightmares caused by his father’s name?\n\nUnless he’s got more charisma than Hulk Hogan, there’s not enough upside in the world for WWE to risk the backlash. It’s totally unfair to him but that’s the business.\n\nRants\n\nFor Research Purposes\n\nBy Scott Keith on 10th February 2022\n\nI read once that you said a match can be a bad match but also still be entertaining. Can you provide a specific example(s) of this?\n\nSure, the easiest example is most of the Attitude era Hardcore match nonsense. Think Patterson and Brisco vs Mean Street Posse. Entertaining crap.\n\nRants\n\nWrestlecrap to Wrestlecap…ital\n\nBy Scott Keith on 9th February 2022\n\nHey Scott,\n\nWas listening to the Bruce Prichard podcast where they did the Lex Express. Bruce was ADAMANT that LE would have worked with another wrestler, claiming Lex was too lazy and didn't try to make the gimmick work. He then references Savage (which, honestly, would have been awesome) as someone who would've embraced the gimmick and taken it to its full potential.\n\n1. You think there's something to this? Yoko was a great foreign heel and there doesn't really seem to be a good reason why a dude in a sweet USA Bus wouldn't be the King of the World. Maybe the problem with the Lex Express really was Lex.\n\n2. Is there a wrestlecrap gimmick that you think should've been awesome but suffered from casting?\n\nᐧ\n\nOh there’s the Luger question I was waiting for after last nights run of emails.\n\nLex was definitely a big part of the problem. I don’t know if Crush would have worked either but he would have at least not seemed bored while doing it. Savage would also have been awesome in that role and you know he’s a guy who is happy to shake hands and mentor kids all over the country.\n\nAs for the second part, yeah, lots of them. Glacier chiefly among them so we’ll start with him.\n\nRants"
