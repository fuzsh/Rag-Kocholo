Plot[edit | edit source]

Fearless Leader (De Niro) and his sidekicks Boris Badenov (Alexander) and Natasha Fatale (Russo) dig a tunnel from their home country of Pottsylvania to Hollywood, where they transform into 3D human characters. They immediately embark on a new scheme to conquer the world, starting their own television studio (RBTV, short for "Really Bad Television") and using its broadcasts to brainwash viewers into supporting Fearless Leader's campaign to become the next President of the United States. Alarmed, the FBI sends Agent Karen Sympathy (Perabo) to pull Rocky, Bullwinkle, and The Narrator (Scott) into the real world as well. Due to his natural stupidity, Bullwinkle is immune to RBTV's stupefying broadcasts.

After a cross-country chase between Boris and Natasha and Rocky, Bullwinkle, and Karen, the two groups end up crashing Fearless Leader's nationally televised address, during which he plans to place the entire country under his mind control. After a chaotic fight in front of a mesmerized studio audience, Rocky and Bullwinkle manage to foil Fearless Leader's plans. The villains are turned back into their animated forms and are banished to the Internet, while RBTV is rebranded as "Rocky and Bullwinkle Television," reviving their careers.
