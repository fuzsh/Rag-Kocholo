Keith Scott (born 28 October 1953) is an Australian voice actor, impressionist and an animation historian. Scott provided the voice for Bullwinkle J. Moose in the 2000 motion picture The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle (for which he had been specially flown to the United States several times) and did the voice of the narrator in George of the Jungle and George of the Jungle 2. Also in 2000, Scott was originally going to be the voice of Diesel 10 in Thomas and the Magic Railroad but he was removed from the film afterwards because the US test audiences thought that Scott made Diesel 10 sound much too frightening for young children. Apart from originally meant to be voicing Diesel 10, he also narrated the Thomas The Tank Engine toy merchandise commercials from Bluebird Toys in Australia in 1998.

He has provided voices for various Australian animations, including Yoram Gross's 'Dot' feature films, Tabaluga, Skippy: Adventures in Bushtown, Fairy Tale Police Department, Flipper and Lopaka, Old Tom and even Blinky Bill. In the case of Yoram Gross' productions, Scott usually provided all of the male character voices.
