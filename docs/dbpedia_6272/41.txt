Keith Scott (born 23 June 1957, in Sydney, Australia) is a voice actor and an animation historian from Australia. Scott provided the voice for Bullwinkle J. Moose in the 2000 motion picture The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle (for which he had been specially flown to the United States several times) and did the voice of the narrator in George of the Jungle and George of the Jungle 2. Also in 2000, Scott was originally going to be the voice Diesel 10 in Thomas and the Magic Railroad but he was cut from the film afterwards because the US test audiences thought that he made Diesel sound much too frightening for young children.

He has also provided voices for various Australian animation including Yoram Gross's "Dot" feature films, Blinky Bill, Tabaluga, Skippy: Adventures in Bushtown and Flipper and Lopaka. In the case of Yoram Gross' productions, Scott usually provided all of the male character voices.
