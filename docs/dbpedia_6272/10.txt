The Narrator of Rocky and Bullwinkle is a male, usually unseen voice who not only narrates the plot of the Rocky and Bullwinkle shorts, but directly interacts with the characters, having conversations, and even being threatened by Fearless Leader and other villains.

Despite usually being off-screen, he is seen in the "Banana Formula" arc catching the viewer up on the story and being tied up. His hands and a portion of his arms are briefly seen in "Mucho Loma".

Personality[]

The narrator is fairly upbeat, but often finds himself annoyed by Boris Badenov's constant involvement in the show. At some points in the show, he even seems overwhelmed by the sheer strangeness of events he is narrating.

Trivia[]

At one point in the Banana Formula arc, it is mentioned he had a moustache...that is, until the tape was removed from his mouth, along with the moustache.
