        "text": "Special 'Burru' - Burruchaga 1985/1987 :\n\n85/86 : day #10 (1 assist v Le Havre : launches Halilhodzic between two HAC defenders), day #16 (lobbed pass to Halilhodzic v Lens), day #18 (free-kick for a header by Le Roux v Rennes, 1-0), day #25 (cross to Le Roux v Lille, 5-1 the 5th goal). 4 assists.\n\n86/87 : day #1 (free-kick on the floor to Le Roux with the foot, 1-0 v Lille).\n\nOn day #9, he is credited with an assist at Monaco in the sum-up about assists (1-3 loss) but in the game report it is said that Anziani scored after a double one-two with Morice (so it's more likely that Morice was the last passer, dunno, did not find a video). That was a 20 m. shot by Anziani anyway... so... dunno... he is credited with 2 in the general ranking onwards in any case, so, unless it suddenly disappear, I'll just keep it as they show it... as long as the players with 2 assists appears (day #23), he's still there, so... yeah.\n\nDay #25 : Free-kick for a header by... Le Roux. But it's not mentioned in the sum-up of the Day #25 assists this time, and Burru doesn't feature with the players with 3 assists (a trick from FF in order to compensate a previous mistake?). As he doesn't reappear along the players with 3 assists later on, it looks like it was an error, indeed.\n\nAnd Morice was credited with one instead of Burru on day #25 : OK. So that's how FF rearranged things. Thus, that's 2 assists in all for Burru (not 3).\n\nBtw, on day #35, FF adds 2 to Ferreri that hey had forgot about on day #33. They say it into an insert (not called \"erratum\" but called \"précision\").\n\nNo more assists in 86/87 for Burru.\n\nSo that's 4 in 1985/1986 and 2 in 1986/1987.\n\nIndeed, in some highlights videos, we can see him directing traffic with his short or long passes and eliminating players by his dribbling at midifield but also see him not to be always altruistic when having a chance or half-a-chance upfront (to the great displeasure of Halilhodzic). Burruchaga must have some 'pre-assists' too (I saw one but did not check everything in that regard).\n\nAlso, he scored against PSG (2-0 in Nantes, min. 82') and was good in a Nantes v Bordeaux (day #35) that ended with a 0-0 but was rated 15 out of 20. Burruchaga received the grade of 4 there like others (Tigana, 5). Burru volleyed the ball on the goal post.\n\nThat is about the 1985/1986 season. He scored against the rivals of Bordeaux on day #6 in '86/87 too (the 3rd goal in a 3-0 win).\n\nHe received the distinction of the \"best foreigner\" in 1985/1986. The main arguments that we can collect here and there putted the emphasis on his Argentine/ South American technique and gestures, his handling of the ball. It was remarkable and spectacular, he brang the show into the Division 1, \"the football as we like. With Susic, he was the most technical player in the league and he had just lift up the World Cup, as a Nantes player.\n\nIn Onze, we can read that he had his 'caracter' too. Halilhodzic (number 9 and at Nantes since '81) and Burruchaga, that was two 'strong heads', two strong caracters in quite a \"familial club\", relatively speaking, of course. Two stars who had to coexist...\n\nLater on, in the early 90's, after his third long-term injury, coach Suaudeau also did not miss the opportunity to tell that he was a great teammate and club-player, humble in spite of his World champ' title. With his long-term injury, we know that Burru took the amateur status in order to liberate a place for a foreigner, namely N'Doram.\n\nSo that's from this video for example, where teammate Jean-Jacques Eydelie also says that Burruchaga is \"adored\" by the group.\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=Aj8_7-08F7s\n\nEydelie, Burruchaga... we know what will happen, no further comments.\n\nNext : the continuation of the thread with the overall rankings.\n\n////////////////////////////////////\n\n1986/1987\n\n*** Desmet (Lille), Micchiche (Metz), Ferreri (Bordeaux) : 9. ***\n\nMorice (Nantes), Passi (Toulouse) : 8\n\nVahirua (Auxerre), Bouquet (Brest), Thouvenel (Bordeaux), Marcico (Toulouse) : 7\n\nTigana (Bordeaux), Reuzeau (Laval), Susic (PSG) : 6\n\nZl. Vujovic (Bordeaux), Mariini (Brest), Lopez * (Metz), Durand * (Toulouse) : 5 ...\n\n[Then, there's quite of a bug in the FF list : I'm not sure if they all have 3 or if there is 4 that should appear in one place. I also have to retrieve some players with 5 assists who disappeared from day \"37 to day #38 (did they had more assists in the last day match? Vahirua seemingly had 2 more on day #38, for instance). These players who had 5 are designated with an asterisk.\n\nAgain, thanks to the ranking after 37 games I can identify the players with 4 assists at this moment (day #37) but same thing, did they have more in the end? Well, say that the ones with 4 most likely stood with 4 (and were joined by Dogon and Plancque after the last game). The interrogation remains stronger about the ones with 5 who had disappeared]\n\n... Geraldès (Auxerre), Buscher (Brest), Dogon (Laval), Picot (le Havre), Tobollik (Lens), P. Plancque (Lille), Black (Metz), Lerby, Dib, Fofana (Monaco), Amisse (Nantes), Henry, Mège, Larios (Nice), Fernier, Morin (Sochaux), Pardo, Dominguez (Toulon) : 4\n\nCantona, Dutuel (Auxerre), Zo. Vujovic (Bordeaux), Colleter (Brest), Owubokiri, Stéfanini (Laval), Velitchkov, Monteilh (Le Havre), Ramos (Lens), Vandenbergh (Lille), Giresse, Papin, Sliskovic (Marseille), Pons, Pauk, Hinscherberger (Metz), Amoros (Monaco), Zahoui, Casini (Nancy), Littbarski, Francescoli, Thys, Fernandez (RCP), Charrier, Solsona (Rennes), Daniel, Françoise, Jacques (Saint-Etienne), Stopyra, Espanol (Toulouse) : 3.\n\nFerreri is the assist leader for the second time (now as a league champion), joint with one of the Belgians of Lille, Desmet (partner of Vandenbergh on the pitch and coached by Heylens), and new French international striker Micchiche who scored and gave an assist for his first cap against Iceland. He will not be selected after 1987 (2 caps in all, the last one occured in Norway, 0-2 in EC qualifiers) and by the way, Platini gave his last NT assist to him.\n\nWithout Giresse and now with Ferreri in the limelight, \"The Great Bordeaux\" conquers its last title, dominating OM who finished at the second place, with their new president, who poached Giresse.\n\nDesmet of Lille : beyond the border. In France, he beats his record of goals scored in one league season : 13 (he's used more upfront than in Belgium). And finishes 14th in the table with Lille and all of the \"Belgian connection\", Vandenbergh scoring 8 times only, in 28 games (he arrived injured at Lille).\n\nCarmelo Micchiche : more altruistic than he looks. A lord, really.\n\n///////////////////////////////////\n\n1987/1988\n\n*** Giresse (Marseille) : 12 ***\n\nVercauteren (Nantes), Bellone (Cannes), Milla (Montpellier) : 10\n\nHoddle, Amoros (Monaco), Bernardet (Montpellier), Calderon (PSG), Pardo (Toulon) : 9\n\nZl. Vujovic (Bordeaux), Kurbos (Nice), Morice (Niort) : 8\n\nCantona (Auxerre), Ferreri (Bordeaux), Emon, Lambert (Laval), Allofs (Marseille), Umpierrez (RCP), Laurey (Montpellier), Hateley (Monaco) : 7\n\nVahirua (Auxerre), Thans (Lens) : 6\n\nDutuel (Auxerre), Moreau (Le Havre), Fernier (RCP), Hinschberger, Zénier (Metz), Perez (Montpellier), Bocandé (Nice), Haon, Garande (Saint-Etienne), Marcico (Toulouse) : 5\n\nThouvenel, Tigana (Bordeaux), Polaniok (Cannes), Omam-Biyik (Laval), Pain (Le Havre), Tobollik (Lens), Desmet, Vandenbergh (Lille), Genghini (Marseille), Zanon (Metz), Amisse (Nantes), Squaglia (Niort), Sivebaek (Saint-Etienne) : 4\n\nMlinaric (Auxerre), Bosser, Guégan (Brest), Brisson (Laval), Lefebvre (Lens), Vizek (Le Havre), Ribar, Pons (Lille), Owubokiri (Metz), Blanc (Montpellier), Rio, Burruchaga, Anziani, Johnston (Nantes), Tholot (Niort), Susic, Roux (PSG), Buscher (RCP), Djelmas (Nice), El Haddaoui, G. Clavelloux (Saint-Etienne), Zahoui, Henry, Paganelli (Toulon), Passi, Durand (Toulouse) : 3\n\nWhile he was never meant to leave his club, the Girondins (but the new OM president Tapie was there to steal him from Bordeaux of president Bez in '86, with the help of Hidalgo), the 35 years old Giresse ends his career with an honorific \"assist leader title\".\n\nHe put Papin into orbit, who knew difficulties to score goals until then. The arrival of Allofs also helped a lot in that sense and having these two upfront certainly helped Giresse to get these numbers as well. A triplet of great value.\n\nThe first OM league title will come next season. This one was for Monaco of the English duet Hateley-Hoddle, coached by Wenger, while OM finished only 6th this time, but reached its first European last-four (in the Cup Winners Cup).\n\n//////////////////////////////////////\n\nThat's from Footnostalgie where there are threads by season with scanned pages (not 100% of them but not far. The short reports and tables).\n\nYou must have a certain number of contributions in order to access it. This number is kept secret in order to avoid \"false posts\" and was increased lately (I don' think it's as much as 50 though).\n\nMany people don't contribute much if not at all on this forum lately and just ask for things they want, which is boring.\n\nI permit myself to re-type this (instead of just copying the pics, well) in order to transmit things about French football that many people whose the French language is not the primary language will not access otherwise (which is comprehensible, it can be a sort of barrier, moreover with that rule about the number of posts required to see the threads which are properly about the football of before).\n\nI hope to promote a bit what is about our French football's history like that (our legends are not as well-known as others, from other countries). + over here we have already plenty of threads of the kind so why not contributing with it over here as well.\n\nI guess that \"non-French people\" visit Footnostalgie, but not that much; no I don't think they are many. Even French, it's deacreasing a lot.\n\nMaybe you are a member over there as well, under a different name?\n\nBy concentrating on assists and putting it a certain way (with pics from Onze or else etc.) although nothing extraordinary, I believe I somehow create quite a new thing, based on this source. Trying to put it in English, to start with ;-) Perhaps I invent a new language even? Or not, it's just \"Franglish\".\n\nNext : the 1988-1989 season. We'll enter the 90's a tad later.\n\nOnze online, if people still don't know (I think I already gave the link over here some years ago) : http://fr.1001mags.com/magazine/onze\n\n1988/1989\n\nWarning : on this one, I can't see the final ranking (after 38 days) but only what it was after 37 games (perhaps the final ranking can be found over Soccernostalgia?). Also the players are listed only up to 5 assists.\n\nA last thing, I will bold the assist leader's name + numbers (and club) just like I did previously in spite of this.\n\nAfter 37 days :\n\n*** Vercauteren (Nantes) : 11. ***\n\nTobollik (Lens) : 9\n\nRix (Caen), Desmet (Lille), Allofs (Marseille), Zanon (Metz), Calderon n' Perez (PSG), Thomas (Sochaux) : 7\n\nVandenbergh (Lille), Vercruysse (Marseille), Francescoli (RCP), Hoddle (Monaco), Ferri (Strasbourg then Cannes) : 6\n\nStopyra n' Ferreri (Bordeaux), Zl. Vujovic (Cannes), Brisson (Laval), Cantona (Marseille then Bordeaux), Touré (Monaco), Valderrama (Montpellier), Djelmas (Nice), Xuereb (PSG), Fournier (Saint-Etienne), Mège n' Péron (Strasbourg), G. Passi (Toulouse) : 5.\n\nAlso, only 5 games reports appear for Day #38 (St-Etienne v Nice, 0-0, Lille v Laval, Toulouse v Racing Paris, Toulon v Lens and Caen v Cannes).\n\nAccoring to these, still, as an indication, here are the assists that can be registered on day #38 (some of the players may have reached the number of 5 assists overall, or even more like Divert) : Ab. Pelé (for Lille, a \"luminous through-ball\" btw, to Vandenbergh), Fiard (Lille), Da Silva (Lille), Dogon (RCP, deflection on a ck to Ginola), Marcico (Toulouse, cross), Monteilh (Lens), Zahoui (Toulon), Divert 2x (Caen, a deflection and a cross, each time to Stein).\n\nQuite sure that we have our assist leader anyway.\n\nFranky Vercauteren, a passer of first order.\n\nVercauteren, a technical leader on the pitch, for a club in transition (it will take some time, basically during his whole stint there, even longer, until that Saudeau comes back as the first team coach. Suaudeau, who welcomed Vercauteren in '87 but was then replaced by Blazevic in '88, one of the worst decision ever made at the club... by president Max Bouyer, who will leave in '92).\n\nVercauteren, a guide for a new generation of \"Canaris\" (Deschamps, Desailly, Debotté...).\n\nVercauteren, a veteran of international football with experience and inexhaustible talent.\n\nThe next season, his last one at the club, will be more complicated and he'll then sign a very last contract with Molenbeek.\n\nMore than 20 assists in his two first seasons. Also 8 goals in 1988/1989, including one against PSG (1-1) and a winner against Bordeaux on day #34 (1-0). 6th in the league in 1988-1989 (not that bad apparently but with a 15-12-11, 41-40 record).\n\nThe picture is from the previous season (or during the summer?).\n\nChampions : as announced in the post above, OM*. Ahead of PSG.\n\n* and it's not ready to stop.\n\nGreat work with this @wm442433 - it is already one of the best threads I think!\n\nSince we chatted a bit via PM since you opened it, I think that providing Platini's average rating for 81/82 in here (since you can't see the final etoiles or average ratings in lists and won't be opening a thread on that topic) is ok and nice extra info. I have a feeling he'd be a candidate for assist leader at least himself that season, but as you've told me the info from France Football game by game isn't good enough to establish approximately how many he'd have (it seems in their game summaries the assister is often not mentioned, and it's not mentioned for any of several goals I already know he did assist as per the videos below - you did find one or probably two others they did confirm though vs Lens in a 5-2 win with a 'golden pass' and seemingly vs Montpellier in a 4-1 win too)\n\n(Those are the links for the games vs Bordeaux and Metz where he did get several assists, not for the games vs Lens and Montpellier, just to clarify for everyone)\n\nSo his average rating was 4.31, comprised of these etoiles (on a 1 * to 6 * scale):\n\n4* vs Metz\n\n4* vs Monaco\n\n4* vs Strasbourg\n\n4* vs Sochaux\n\n4* vs PSG\n\n5* vs Lens\n\n4* vs Lyon\n\n4* vs Auxerre\n\n4* vs Lille\n\n3* vs Nantes\n\n4* vs Brest\n\n4* vs Nancy\n\n3* vs Bordeaux\n\n5* vs Montpellier\n\n4* vs Laval\n\n5* vs Nice\n\n5* vs Bastia\n\n4* vs Tours\n\n6* vs Valenciennes\n\n3* vs Monaco\n\n4* vs Sochaux\n\n4* vs PSG\n\n4* vs Lens\n\n5* vs Auxerre\n\n4* vs Brest\n\n5* vs Lyon\n\n5* vs Lille\n\n4* vs Nantes\n\n3* vs Nice\n\n6* vs Bordeaux\n\n5* vs Montpellier\n\n5* vs Laval\n\n4* vs Bastia\n\n5* vs Tours\n\n4* vs Valenciennes\n\n5* vs Metz\n\nSo, it's confirmed, France Football provided assists rankings in the late 70's. In 1977-1978 and in 1978-1979.\n\nThat's confusing in a first time because of the words they used : \"remises\" instead of \"passes décisives/ assists\"; \"remiseur\" being the word used to designate a player who did a \"remise\".\n\nA \"remiseur\", in football, it's about releasing the ball when back to the goal for example (with the foot or with a deflection with the head for example), or giving it back when playing a one-two. Not that much about through-balls or crosses. It may have been a bit confusing at the time too, in my opinion (perhaps it was less confusing if it was used some decades before?). Also they don't award \"passes\"/ \"passes décisives\"/ \"assists\" but use the word \"points\".\n\nIt features right before the golscorer list, too. The proximity between the two lists erase some doubts but at the same time, choosing to present it before the goalscorers can be surprising, at first sight.\n\nAt last, given the players who make the lists, there's little doubt that we are well in presence of an \"assist ranking\".\n\nHere it is :\n\n1977-1978 (after Day #31)\n\nThe record of \"points\" doesn't appear for each day match, in this thread that I am consulting, and it appears for the last time after the 31st day match, with a complete article on the matter.\n\nThe article is entitled : \"Assists - Christian Dalger : it's in the bag\".\n\n1. Dalger (Monaco), 20 points.\n\n2. Dahleb (Paris-S.-G), 12 pts.\n\n3. Redon (Paris-S.-G), 11 pts.\n\n4. Lacombe (Lyon), 10 pts.\n\n5. Amisse (Nantes), Huck n' Sanchez (Nice), Ivezic (Sochaux), Piaseki (Strasbourg), 9 pts.\n\n10. Giresse (Bordeaux), Boubacar (Marseille), Platini (Nancy), Betta (Reims), Gemmrich (Strasbourg), 8 pts.\n\n15. Tokoto (Bordeaux), Chiesa (Lyon), Linderoth n' Florès (Marseille), Noguès (Monaco), Horlaville n' Bourebbou (rouen), Sarramagna (Saint-Etienne), Tanter (Strasbourg), Giachetti (Valenciennes), 7 pts.\n\n25. Papi n' De Zerbi (Bastia), Lechantre (Laval), Spiegel (Lyon), Rubio (Nancy), Pécout (Nantes), Bjekovic (Nice), Guillou (Nice), Parizon (Sochaux), 6 pts, etc.\n\nRight after that, we have the three best by club :\n\nBastia : Papi n' De Zerbi, 6 ; Orlanducci, Rep, Larios, 3.\n\nBordeaux : Giresse 8, Tokoto 7, Goubet, Barthou, Ferratge, Jeandupeux, 2.\n\nLaval : Lechantre 6, Keruzoré n' Leroy, 5.\n\nLens : Six n' Marx, 5 ; Krawczik 4.\n\nLyon : Lacombe 10, Chiesa 7, Spiegel 6.\n\nMarseille : Boubacar 8, Linderoth n' Florès 7.\n\nMetz : Zénier 5, Raspollini, Perignon, Rémy 3.\n\nMonaco : Dalger 20, Noguès 7, François 4.\n\nNancy : Platini 8, Rubio 6, Rouyer 4.\n\nNantes : Amisse 9, Pécout 6, Michel 5.\n\nNice : Sanchez 9, Huck 9, Guillou n ' Bjekovic 6.\n\nNîmes : Domarski n' Gamouh 4, Dellamore 3.\n\nParis-Saint-Germain : Dahleb 12, Redon 11, M'Pelé 5.\n\nReims : Betta 8, Santamaria n' Bonnec 3.\n\nRouen : Bourebbou n' Horlaville 7, Pena 2.\n\nSaint-Etienne : Sarramagna 7, Rocheteau n' Synaeghel 5.\n\nSochaux : Ivezic 9, Soler 8, Parizon 6.\n\nStrasbourg : Piasecki 9, Gemmrich 8, Tanter 7.\n\nTroyes : Verstraete 4, Diallo 3, Vendrely, Raulin, Fuchs, Tota, Grégoire, Sanchez 1.\n\nValenciennes : Giachetti 7, Piette, Jeskowiak, Zaremba, Maschzyk, Jacques 3.\n\n\"Best passer, 4th scorer alongside teammate Onnis : is 1978 the Dalger year?\"\n\nAnswer : he'll win the league with Monaco (1 pt over Nantes), Onnis will score twelve more (17 + 12 = 29), Dalger only 1 more, but it will not prevent him to make a trip to Argentina (1 game against Italy, his last cap for a total of 6 : 1 in '74, 2 in '77 and 3 in '78).\n\nOnze (where the pic comes from) uses the word \"remiseur\" as well.\n\n////////////////////\n\n1978-1979 (after Day #33)\n\nSame as for the 1977-1978 season, the ranking is rarely shown and this time, it appears for the last time after Day #33 (knowing that there's some rescheduled games, of course. As for Platini, we know that he was injured in August and came back only in March. He has 13 games after Day #33, 19 at the end of the season. A last thing, the club names are not shown this time and I'll just copy it as it is, on this one).\n\nAmisse, Olarevic, Gamouh, 11 points.\n\nPiasecki, 10.\n\nRouyer, Baronchelli, Rocheteau, Gemmrich, 9.\n\nLechantre, Pleimelding, Cabral, Chiesa, 8.\n\nRep, Six, Rubio, 7.\n\nGiresse, Simon, Battiston, Platini, Luizinho, M'Pelé, 6.\n\nYes, probably France Foot would have recorded it. It is similar to Monteilh '88/89 on day 38, although the description doesn't allow to know if it was towards the goals, or 'slightly in diagonal', or coming from the wing à la Roberto Carlos '02 (sounds like it was from a central position though. It was a very 'aerial chipped pass' dunno how to say, \"un ballon en cloche\").\n\nThis goal, really is superb."
