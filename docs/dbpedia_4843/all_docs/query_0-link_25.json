        "text": "Comparison of sexual behavior and HIV risk between two HIV-1 serodiscordant couple cohorts: the CHAVI 002 study.\n\nPubMed\n\nRitchie, Adam J; Kuldanek, Kristin; Moodie, Zoe; Wang, Z Maggie; Fox, Julie; Nsubuga, Rebecca N; Legg, Kenneth; Birabwa, Esther F; Kaleebu, Pontiano; McMichael, Andrew J; Watera, Christine; Goonetilleke, Nilu; Fidler, Sarah\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe CHAVI002 study was designed to characterize immune responses, particularly HIV-specific T-cell responses, amongst 2 cohorts of HIV-exposed seronegative (HESN) individuals. The absence of a clear definition of HESNs has impaired comparison of researchÂ within and between such cohorts. This report describes two distinct HESN cohorts and attempts to quantify HIV exposure using a 'HIV risk index' (RI) model. HIV serodiscordant couples (UK; 24, Uganda; 72) and HIV unexposed seronegative (HUSN) controls (UK; 14, Uganda; 26 couples, 3 individuals) completed sexual behavior questionnaires every 3 months over a 9 month period. The two cohorts were heterogeneous, with most HESNs in the UK men who have sex with men (MSM), while all HESNs in Uganda were in heterosexual relationships. Concordance of responses between partners was determined. Each participant's sexual behavior score (SBS) was estimated based on the number and type of unprotected sex acts carried out in defined time periods. Independent HIV acquisition risk factors (partner plasma viral load, STIs, male circumcision, pregnancy) were integrated with the SBS, generating a RI for each HESN. 96 HIV serodiscordant couples completed 929 SBQs. SBSs remained relatively stable amongst the UK cohort, whilst decreasing from Visit 1 to 2 in the Ugandan cohort. Compared to the Ugandan cohort, SBSs and RIs in the UK cohort were lower at visit 1, and generally higher at later visits. Differences between the cohorts, with lower rates of ART use in Uganda and higher risk per-act sex in the UK, had major impacts on the SBSs and RIs of each cohort. There was one HIV transmission event in the UK cohort. Employment of a risk quantification model facilitated quantification and comparison of HIV acquisition risk across two disparate HIV serodiscordant couple cohorts.\n\nPerceptual Influence of Ugandan Biology Students' Understanding of HIV/AIDS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMutonyi, Harriet; Nashon, Samson; Nielsen, Wendy S.\n\n2010-08-01\n\nIn Uganda, curbing the spread of HIV/AIDS has largely depended on public and private media messages about the disease. Media campaigns based on Ugandaâs cultural norms of communication are metaphorical, analogical and simile-like. The topic of HIV/AIDS has been introduced into the Senior Three (Grade 11) biology curriculum in Uganda. To what extent do studentsâ pre-conceptions of the disease, based on these media messages influence studentsâ development of conceptual understanding of the disease, its transmission and prevention? Of significant importance is the impact the conceptions students have developed from the indirect media messages on classroom instruction on HIV/AIDS. The study is based in a theoretical framework of conceptual change in science learning. An interpretive case study to determine the impact of Ugandan studentsâ conceptions or perceptions on classroom instruction about HIV/AIDS, involving 160 students aged 15-17, was conducted in four different Ugandan high schools: girls boarding, boys boarding, mixed boarding, and mixed day. Using questionnaires, focus group discussions, recorded biology lessons and informal interviews, studentsâ preconceptions of HIV/AIDS and how these impact lessons on HIV/AIDS were discerned. These preconceptions fall into four main categories: religious, political, conspiracy and traditional African worldviews. Results of data analysis suggest that studentsâ prior knowledge is persistent even after biology instructions. This has implications for current teaching approaches, which are mostly teacher-centred in Ugandan schools. A rethinking of the curriculum with the intent of offering science education programs that promote understanding of the science of HIV/AIDS as opposed to what is happening nowâinsensitivity to misconceptions about the diseaseâis needed.\n\nHIV Type 1 Disease Progression to AIDS and Death in a Rural Ugandan Cohort Is Primarily Dependent on Viral Load Despite Variable Subtype and T-Cell Immune Activation Levels\n\nPubMed Central\n\nEller, Michael A.; Opollo, Marc S.; Liu, Michelle; Redd, Andrew D.; Eller, Leigh Anne; Kityo, Cissy; Kayiwa, Joshua; Laeyendecker, Oliver; Wawer, Maria J.; Milazzo, Mark; Kiwanuka, Noah; Gray, Ronald H.; Serwadda, David; Sewankambo, Nelson K.; Quinn, Thomas C.; Michael, Nelson L.; Wabwire-Mangen, Fred; Sandberg, Johan K.; Robb, Merlin L.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBackground.âUntreated human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) infection is associated with persistent immune activation, which is an independent driver of disease progression in European and United States cohorts. In Uganda, HIV-1 subtypes A and D and recombinant AD viruses predominate and exhibit differential rates of disease progression. Methods.âHIV-1 seroconverters (n = 156) from rural Uganda were evaluated to assess the effects of T-cell activation, viral load, and viral subtype on disease progression during clinical follow-up. Results.âThe frequency of activated T cells was increased in HIV-1âinfected Ugandans, compared with community matched uninfected individuals, but did not differ significantly between viral subtypes. Higher HIV-1 load, subtype D, older age, and high T-cell activation levels were associated with faster disease progression to AIDS or death. In a multivariate Cox regression analysis, HIV-1 load was the strongest predictor of progression, with subtype also contributing. T-cell activation did not emerge an independent predictor of disease progression from this particular cohort. Conclusions.âThese findings suggest that the independent contribution of T-cell activation on morbidity and mortality observed in European and North American cohorts may not be directly translated to the HIV epidemic in East Africa. In this setting, HIV-1 load appears to be the primary determinant of disease progression.

Brooks; Bagenda, Danstan; Omer, Saad B.; Donnell, Deborah; Nakabiito, Clemensia; Eure, Chineta; Guay, Laura A.; Taylor, Allan; Bakaki, Paul M.; Matovu, Flavia; McConnell, Michelle; Fowler, Mary Glenn; Eshleman, Susan H.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nHIV-infected infants may have CXCR4-using (X4-tropic) HIV, CCR5-using (R5-tropic) HIV, or a mixture of R5-tropic and X4-tropic HIV (dual/mixed, DM HIV). The level of infectivity for R5 virus (R5-RLU) varies among HIV-infected infants. HIV tropism and R5-RLU were measured in samples from HIV-infected Ugandan infants using a commercial assay. DM HIV was detected in 7/72 (9.7%) infants at the time of HIV diagnosis (birth or 6â8 weeks of age, 4/15 (26.7%) with subtype D, 3/57 (5.3 %) with other subtypes, P=0.013). A transition from R5-tropic to DM HIV was observed in only two (6.7%) of 30 infants over 6â12 months. Six (85.7%) of seven infants with DM HIV died, compared to 21/67 (31.3%) infants with R5-tropic HIV (p=0.09). Higher R5-RLU at 6â8 weeks was not associated with decreased survival. Infants with in utero infection had a higher median R5-RLU than infants who were HIV-uninfected at birth (p=0.025). PMID:21073438\n\n'They wrote \"gay\" on her file': transgender Ugandans in HIV prevention and treatment.\n\nPubMed\n\nMinor Peters, Melissa\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis paper examines the ways in which HIV-related programmes for heterosexual Ugandans and also for men who have sex with men work to deny healthcare services to transgender people in Uganda. Contrary to current conventional wisdom, the study found that the widespread use of the term 'men who have sex with men' produces greater barriers to healthcare for queer Ugandans than identity categories such as 'lesbian' or 'transgender'. Interventions for men who have sex with men assume a male-identified sexual subject with agency over sexual practices, such as frequency of condom use. Based on two years of ethnographic research in Kampala, I suggest that the focus on individual sexual practices harms transgender people in two ways. First, current HIV prevention and treatment programmes fail to account for risk factors that accrue to both male and female transgender Ugandans due to the social enforcement of gender norms. Second, the term men who have sex with men directs attention towards stigmatised sexual practices, producing the neglect and abuse of non-heteronormative individuals. In the context of Ugandan healthcare, terms such as 'transgender' and kuchu instead focus attention on the dignity and humanity of the rights-bearing person. These findings emphasise how health practitioners must pay attention to emic categories in order to address the ways in which vulnerability is distributed along social vectors of difference.\n\nEpidemiology of Meningitis in an HIV-Infected Ugandan Cohort\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRajasingham, Radha; Rhein, Joshua; Klammer, Kate; Musubire, Abdu; Nabeta, Henry; Akampurira, Andrew; Mossel, Eric C.; Williams, Darlisha A.; Boxrud, Dave J.; Crabtree, Mary B.; Miller, Barry R.; Rolfes, Melissa A.; Tengsupakul, Supatida; Andama, Alfred O.; Meya, David B.; Boulware, David R.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThere is limited understanding of the epidemiology of meningitis among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected populations in sub-Saharan Africa. We conducted a prospective cohort study of HIV-infected adults with suspected meningitis in Uganda, to comprehensively evaluate the etiologies of meningitis. Intensive cerebrospiral fluid (CSF) testing was performed to evaluate for bacterial, viral, fungal, and mycobacterial etiologies, including neurosyphilis,16s ribosomal DNA (rDNA) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for bacteria, Plex-ID broad viral assay, quantitative-PCR for HSV-1/2, cytomegalovirus (CMV), EpsteinâBarr virus (EBV), and Toxoplasma gondii; reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) for Enteroviruses and arboviruses, and Xpert MTB/RIF assay. Cryptococcal meningitis accounted for 60% (188 of 314) of all causes of meningitis. Of 117 samples sent for viral PCR, 36% were EBV positive. Among cryptococcal antigen negative patients, the yield of Xpert MTB/RIF assay was 22% (8 of 36). After exclusion of cryptococcosis and bacterial meningitis, 61% (43 of 71) with an abnormal CSF profile had no definitive diagnosis. Exploration of new TB diagnostics and diagnostic algorithms for evaluation of meningitis in resource-limited settings remains needed, and implementation of cryptococcal diagnostics is critical.

This study examined the initial outcomes of provider-initiated routine HIV testing at a rural Ugandan hospital regarding partner HIV testing, sexual risk behavior, disclosure, and HIV care seeking. In a prospective cohort study, 245 outpatients receiving routine HIV testing completed baseline and 3-month follow-up interviews. After receiving routine HIV testing the percentage of participants engaging in risky sex decreased from 70.1% to 50.3% among HIV-negative and from 75.0% to 53.5% among HIV-positive participants, the percentage knowing their partner(s)' HIV status increased from 18.7% to 34.3% of HIV-negative and from 14.3% to 35.7% of HIV-positive participants. Among those reporting risky sex at baseline, HIV-positive participants were more likely to eliminate risky sex in general and specifically to become abstinent at follow-up than were HIV-negative participants. Similarly, unmarried participants who were risky at baseline were more likely to become safe in general, become abstinent, and start 100% condom use than were married/cohabitating participants. Rates of disclosure were high. Over 85% of those who tested HIV positive enrolled in care. Routine HIV testing in this setting may promote earlier HIV diagnosis and access to care but leads to only modest reductions in risky sexual behavior. To fully realize the potential HIV prevention benefits of routine HIV testing an emphasis on tailored risk-reduction counseling may be necessary.\n\nMedia ownership and news framing: an analysis of HIV/AIDS coverage by Ugandan press.\n\nPubMed\n\nKiwanuka-Tondo, James; Albada, Kelly F; Payton, Fay Cobb\n\n2012-12-01\n\nApplying framing theory, the present research analyzes trends in Ugandan news coverage and the prominent issue frames for HIV/AIDS-related stories. In order to determine the influence of other factors, such as media ownership and journalist origin, nearly 800 articles, from 2000 to 2004, were gathered from the major private newspaper and government-owned newspaper in Uganda. After systematic sampling, 365 articles constitute the sample. The results indicate that print news coverage of HIV and AIDS followed a non-linear trajectory, declining from 2000-2002 and then increasing from 2003-2004. Curative medicine emerged as the most prominent issue frame. Higher-risk behaviour was the least prominent issue frame overall. The 'solutions' issue frame nearly doubled in prominence from 2000-2004, while the HIV-prevention frame decreased from 2000-2002 and then rebounded from 2003-2004. Concerning HIV-related topics, the private newspaper included more features, printed lengthier articles, incorporated a greater variety of news frames, and published more articles by foreign journalists than the government-owned newspaper. The private newspaper employed the 'HIV-prevention,' 'action,' and 'victims' frames more often than the government-owned newspaper. Journalists at the government-owned newspaper adopted a 'solutions' frame more often than their private-press counterparts. Though foreign journalists were more likely than local journalists to employ the HIV-prevention frame, additional tests revealed that the news organisation for which the journalists worked contributed to issue framing to a greater extent than did either a local or foreign reporting origin. Local (Ugandan) journalists working for the two news organisations differed in their tendencies to apply the HIV-prevention, action, victims, and tragedy frames in news stories on HIV and AIDS, with journalists at the private newspaper using these frames more often than did journalists at the government-owned newspaper.\n\nNeurocognitive function in HIV-infected persons with asymptomatic cryptococcal antigenemia: a comparison of three prospective cohorts.\n\nPubMed\n\nMontgomery, Martha P; Nakasujja, Noeline; Morawski, Bozena M; Rajasingham, Radha; Rhein, Joshua; Nalintya, Elizabeth; Williams, Darlisha A; Huppler Hullsiek, Kathy; Kiragga, Agnes; Rolfes, Melissa A; Donahue Carlson, Renee; Bahr, Nathan C; Birkenkamp, Kate E; Manabe, Yukari C; Bohjanen, Paul R; Kaplan, Jonathan E; Kambugu, Andrew; Meya, David B; Boulware, David R\n\n2017-06-12\n\nHIV-infected persons with detectable cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) in blood have increased morbidity and mortality compared with HIV-infected persons who are CrAg-negative. This study examined neurocognitive function among persons with asymptomatic cryptococcal antigenemia. Participants from three prospective HIV cohorts underwent neurocognitive testing at the time of antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation. Cohorts included persons with cryptococcal meningitis (NÂ =Â 90), asymptomatic CrAgÂ +Â (NÂ =Â 87), and HIV-infected persons without central nervous system infection (NÂ =Â 125). Z-scores for each neurocognitive test were calculated relative to an HIV-negative Ugandan population with a composite quantitative neurocognitive performance Z-score (QNPZ-8) created from eight tested domains. Neurocognitive function was measured pre-ART for all three cohorts and additionally after 4Â weeks of ART (and 6Â weeks of pre-emptive fluconazole) treatment among asymptomatic CrAgÂ +Â participants. Cryptococcal meningitis and asymptomatic CrAgÂ +Â participants had lower median CD4 counts (17 and 26 cells/Î¼L, respectively) than the HIV-infected control cohort (233 cells/Î¼L) as well as lower Karnofsky performance status (60 and 70 vs. 90, respectively). The composite QNPZ-8 for asymptomatic CrAgÂ +Â (-1.80 Z-score) fell between the cryptococcal meningitis cohort (-2.22 Z-score, PÂ =Â 0.02) and HIV-infected controls (-1.36, PÂ =Â 0.003). After four weeks of ART and six weeks of fluconazole, the asymptomatic CrAgÂ +Â cohort neurocognitive performance improved (-1.0 Z-score, PÂ <Â 0.001). Significant deficits in neurocognitive function were identified in asymptomatic CrAgÂ +Â persons with advanced HIV/AIDS even without signs or sequelae of meningitis. Neurocognitive function in this group improves over time after initiation of pre-emptive fluconazole treatment and ART, but short term adherence support may be necessary.\n\nVaginal Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Is a Useful Biomarker of Semen Exposure Among HIV-Infected Ugandan Women.\n\nPubMed\n\nWoolf-King, Sarah E; Muyindike, Winnie; Hobbs, Marcia M; Kusasira, Adrine; Fatch, Robin; Emenyonu, Nneka; Johnson, Mallory O; Hahn, Judith A\n\n2017-07-01\n\nThe practical feasibility of using prostate specific antigen (PSA) as a biomarker of semen exposure was examined among HIV-infected Ugandan women. Vaginal fluids were obtained with self-collected swabs and a qualitative rapid test (ABAcard Â® p30) was used to detect PSA. Trained laboratory technicians processed samples on-site and positive PSA tests were compared to self-reported unprotected vaginal sex (UVS) in the last 48Â h. A total of 77 women submitted 126 samples for PSA testing at up to three study visits. Of these samples, 31Â % (nÂ =Â 39/126) were PSA positive, and 64Â % (nÂ =Â 25/39) of the positive PSA samples were accompanied by self-report of no UVS at the study visit the PSA was collected. There were no reported difficulties with specimen collection, storage, or processing. These findings provide preliminary data on high levels of misreported UVS among HIV-infected Ugandan women using practically feasible methods for PSA collection and processing.\n\nMinor drug-resistant HIV type-1 variants in breast milk and plasma of HIV type-1-infected Ugandan women after nevirapine single-dose prophylaxis.\n\nPubMed\n\nPilger, Daniel; Hauser, Andrea; Kuecherer, Claudia; Mugenyi, Kizito; Kabasinguzi, Rose; Somogyi, Sybille; Harms, Gundel; Kunz, Andrea\n\n2011-01-01\n\nNevirapine single-dose (NVP-SD) reduces mother-to-child transmission of HIV type-1 (HIV-1), but frequently induces resistance mutations in the HIV-1 genome. Little is known about drug-resistant HIV-1 variants in the breast milk of women who have taken NVP-SD. Blood and breast milk samples of 39 HIV-1-infected Ugandan women were taken 6-12 weeks after NVP-SD intake. Samples were analysed by population sequencing and allele-specific real-time PCR (AS-PCR) with detection limits for NVP-resistant HIV-1 variants (K103N and Y181C) of < 1% of the total viral population. AS-PCR results for both plasma and breast milk were obtained for 19 women who constituted the final study group (HIV-1 subtype frequencies were A1 n = 11, D n = 5, G n = 2 and C n = 1). A total of 7 (37%) and 10 (53%) women carried NVP-resistant virus in breast milk and plasma, respectively. Overall, 71% (5/7) women with NVP-resistant HIV-1 in breast milk displayed >1 drug-resistant variant. Resistance in breast milk was higher at week 6 (6/13 samples [46%]) compared with week 12 (1/6 samples [17%]). In total, 10 drug-resistant populations harbouring the K103N and/or Y181C mutation were detected in the 19 breast milk samples; 7 (70%) were caused by resistant minorities (< 5% of the total HIV-1 population). In the four women with drug-resistant virus in both plasma and breast milk, the mutation patterns differed between the two compartments. Minor populations of drug-resistant HIV-1 were frequently found in breast milk of Ugandan women after exposure to NVP-SD. Further studies need to explore the role of minor drug-resistant variants in the postnatal transmission of (resistant) HIV-1.\n\nArtemisinin-based combination therapies are efficacious and safe for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in HIV-infected Ugandan children.\n\nPubMed\n\nKakuru, Abel; Achan, Jane; Muhindo, Mary K; Ikilezi, Gloria; Arinaitwe, Emmanuel; Mwangwa, Florence; Ruel, Theodore; Clark, Tamara D; Charlebois, Edwin; Rosenthal, Philip J; Havlir, Diane; Kamya, Moses R; Tappero, Jordan W; Dorsey, Grant\n\n2014-08-01\n\nArtemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are highly efficacious and safe, but data from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected children concurrently receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) and ACTs are limited. We evaluated 28-day outcomes following malaria treatment with artemether-lumefantrine (AL) or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) in 2 cohorts of HIV-infected Ugandan children taking various ART regimens. In one cohort, children <6 years of age were randomized to lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based ART and treated with AL for uncomplicated malaria. In another cohort, children <12 months of age were started on nevirapine-based ART if they were eligible, and randomized to AL or DP for the treatment of their first and all subsequent uncomplicated malaria episodes. There were 773 and 165 treatments for malaria with AL and DP, respectively. Initial response to therapy was excellent, with 99% clearance of parasites and <1% risk of repeat therapy within 3 days. Recurrent parasitemia within 28 days was common following AL treatment. The risk of recurrent parasitemia was significantly lower among children taking LPV/r-based ART compared with children taking nevirapine-based ART following AL treatment (15.3% vs 35.5%, P = .009), and those treated with DP compared with AL (8.6% vs 36.2%, P < .001). Both ACT regimens were safe and well tolerated. Treatment of uncomplicated malaria with AL or DP was efficacious and safe in HIV-infected children taking ART. However, there was a high risk of recurrent parasitemia following AL treatment, which was significantly lower in children taking LPV/r-based ART compared with nevirapine-based ART.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether alcohol used at the time of a sexual event is associated with unprotected sex at that same event. Data for this study were collected as part of two longitudinal studies of HIV-infected Ugandan adults. A structured questionnaire was administered at regularly scheduled cohort study visits in order to assess the circumstances (e.g., alcohol use, partner type) of the most recent sexual event (MRSE). Generalized estimating equation logistic regression models were used to examine the association between alcohol use (by the participant, the sexual partner, or both the participant and the partner) and the odds of unprotected sex at the sexual event while controlling for participant gender, age, months since HIV diagnosis, unhealthy alcohol use in the prior 3Â months, partner type, and HIV status of partner. A total of 627 sexually active participants (57% women) reported 1817 sexual events. Of these events, 19% involved alcohol use and 53% were unprotected. Alcohol use by one's sexual partner (aOR 1.70; 95% CI 1.14, 2.54) or by both partners (aOR 1.78; 95% CI 1.07, 2.98) during the MRSE significantly increased the odds of unprotected sex at that same event. These results add to the growing event-level literature in SSA and support a temporal association between alcohol used prior to a sexual event and subsequent unprotected sex.\n\nHair concentrations of antiretrovirals predict viral suppression in HIV-infected pregnant and breastfeeding Ugandan women.\n\nPubMed\n\nKoss, Catherine A; Natureeba, Paul; Mwesigwa, Julia; Cohan, Deborah; Nzarubara, Bridget; Bacchetti, Peter; Horng, Howard; Clark, Tamara D; Plenty, Albert; Ruel, Theodore D; Achan, Jane; Charlebois, Edwin D; Kamya, Moses R; Havlir, Diane V; Gandhi, Monica\n\n2015-04-24\n\nHair concentrations are a noninvasive measure of cumulative antiretroviral exposure and the strongest predictor of viral suppression in large cohorts of nonpregnant patients. We examined hair concentrations of antiretrovirals in relation to virologic outcomes in pregnant and breastfeeding women for the first time. The Prevention of Malaria and HIV Disease in Tororo trial (NCT00993031) enrolled HIV-infected pregnant Ugandan women at 12-28 weeks gestation who were randomized to lopinavir or efavirenz-based antiretroviral therapy (ART). Small hair samples were collected at 30-34 weeks gestation and 10-25 weeks postpartum. Efavirenz and lopinavir hair concentrations were measured via liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Multivariate logistic regression models examined predictors of viral suppression (HIV-1 RNA â¤400âcopies/ml) at delivery and 24 weeks postpartum. Among 325 women, median CD4 cell count was 366âcells/Î¼l (interquartile range 270-488) at ART initiation. Mean self-reported 3-day adherence was greater than 97% in each arm. Viral suppression was achieved by 98.0% (efavirenz) and 87.4% (lopinavir) at delivery. At 24 weeks postpartum, 92.5% (efavirenz) and 90.6% (lopinavir) achieved viral suppression; 88% of women were breastfeeding. In multivariate models including self-reported adherence and pretreatment HIV-1 RNA, antiretroviral hair concentrations were the strongest predictor of viral suppression at delivery [efavirenz: adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.86 per doubling in concentration, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14-3.1, Pâ=â0.013; lopinavir: aOR 1.90, 95% CI 1.33-2.7, Pâ=â0.0004] and 24 weeks postpartum (efavirenz: aOR 1.81, 95% CI 1.22-2.7, Pâ=â0.003; lopinavir: aOR 1.53, 95% CI 1.05-2.2, Pâ=â0.026). Antiretroviral hair concentrations represent an innovative tool that strongly predicts viral suppression among HIV-infected childbearing women during the critical periods of delivery and breastfeeding.\n\nA prospective study of trends in consumption of cigarettes and alcohol among adults in a rural Ugandan population cohort, 1994-2011.\n\nPubMed\n\nAsiki, Gershim; Baisley, Kathy; Kamali, Anatoli; Kaleebu, Pontiano; Seeley, Janet; Newton, Robert\n\n2015-04-01\n\nTo characterise trends over time in smoking and alcohol consumption in a rural Ugandan population between 1994 and 2011. We used self-reported data from a long-standing population cohort - the General Population Cohort. From 1989 to 1999, the study population comprised about 10Â 000 residents of 15 adjacent villages. From 1999, 10 more villages were added, doubling the population. Among adults (â¥13Â years, who comprise about half of the total study population), data on smoking were collected in 1994/1995, 2008/2009 and in 2010/2011. Data on alcohol were collected in 1996/1997, 2000/2001, 2009/2010 and 2010/2011. The reported prevalence of smoking among men was 17% in 1994/1995, 14% in 2008/2009 and 16% in 2010/2011; equivalent figures for women were 1.5%, 1% and 2%. In the most recent time period, for both sexes combined, prevalence of smoking increased from 1.5% in those aged <29Â years, to 18% in those 50+ years (PÂ <Â 0.001); prevalence was 14.8% in the lowest tertile of socio-economic status, decreasing to 3.7% in the highest (PÂ <Â 0.001). For alcohol consumption, current drinking was reported by 39% in 1996/1997, 35% in 2000/2001 and 28% in 2010/2011; men were more likely to drink than women (32.9% vs. 23.5% in 2010/2011) and consumption increased with age (PÂ <Â 0.001); and was associated with low socio-economic status, riskier sexual behaviour and being HIV positive (PÂ <Â 0.001). In this rural Ugandan population, consumption of cigarettes and alcohol is higher among men than women, increases with age and is more frequent among those with low socio-economic status. We find no evidence of increases in either exposure over time.

Nine clinical research centers (CRC) in sub-Saharan Africa conducted HIV observational epidemiology studies in populations at risk for HIV infection as part of an HIV prevention and vaccine trial network. Annual HIV incidence ranged from below 2% to above 10% and varied by CRC and risk group, with rates above 5% observed in Zambian men in an HIV-discordant relationship, Ugandan men from Lake Victoria fishing communities, men who have sex with men, and several cohorts of women. HIV incidence tended to fall after the first three months in the study and over calendar time. Among suspected transmission pairs, 28% of HIV infections were not from the reported partner. Volunteers with high incidence were successfully identified and enrolled into large scale cohort studies. Over a quarter of new cases in couples acquired infection from persons other than the suspected transmitting partner.

Therefore, we evaluate the association between stigma, anxiety, depression, and social support and change in QOL and SRH in HIV-infected Ugandan adults during an 18-month period. Psychosocial indicators were assessed at enrollment using structured questionnaires. QOL and SRH measures were assessed at months 0, 6, 12, and 18 using the Medical Outcomes Survey-HIV. Linear mixed models determined risk estimated differences in QOL and SRH in relation to quartiles of each psychosocial status indicator. Repeated measures generalized estimating equations modeling was implemented to assess differences in likelihood of improved versus nonimproved SRH during follow-up.QOL scores and SRH improved significantly for all participants over 18 months (Pâ<â0.0001). The gain in QOL increased dose-dependently as baseline depressive symptoms (time*depression Pâ<â0.001) and anxiety levels (time*anxiety Pâ<â0.001) declined. Lower social support was associated with worse QOL at baseline (Pâ=â0.0005) but QOL improvement during follow-up was not dependent on baseline level of social support (time*social support Pâ=â0.8943) or number of stigmatizing experiences (time*stigma Pâ=â0.8662). Psychosocial determinants did not predict changes in SRH in this study. High levels of depression and anxiety symptoms at HAART initiation predicts lower gains in QOL for HIV-positive patients for as long as 18 months. Long-term QOL improvements in HIV-infected adults may be enhanced by implementation of psychosocial interventions to reduce depression and anxiety in HIV-infected adults.\n\n\"...No stone left unturned:\" how the public explains the Ugandan success story.\n\nPubMed\n\nChapman, Elizabeth; Kipp, Walter; Rubaale, Tom\n\n2008-01-01\n\nWe conducted a public poll to assess the public's perception about changes in HIV prevalence and its causes in a township in western Uganda. The main questions related to the declining HIV prevalence and its interpretation, as well as to the \"Ugandan success story.\" The study used a qualitative methodology; we interviewed 68 citizens in eight focus group discussions. The majority stated that the HIV prevalence had declined in their town. Of those respondents, most cited behaviour changes related to Uganda's ABC strategy as their explanation of the declining trends. Those who said that a decline in HIV had taken place also stated that they believed in the Ugandan success story. Our study concludes that it is important to involve the public on important health issues such as HIV/AIDS in order to obtain more valid results by combining scientific findings with public/indigenous knowledge.\n\nA Randomized Controlled Trial to Evaluate if Computerized Cognitive Rehabilitation Improves Neurocognition in Ugandan Children with HIV\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNakasujja, Noeline; Sikorskii, Alla; Opoka, Robert O.; Giordani, Bruno\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAbstract Objectives: Clinically stable children with HIV can have neuromotor, attention, memory, visualâspatial, and executive function impairments. We evaluated neuropsychological and behavioral benefits of computerized cognitive rehabilitation training (CCRT) in Ugandan HIV children. Design: One hundred fifty-nine rural Ugandan children with WHO Stage I or II HIV disease (6 to 12 years; 77 boys, 82 girls; Mâ=â8.9, SDâ=â1.86 years) were randomized to one of three treatment arms over a 2-month period. Methods: The CCRT arm received 24 one-hour sessions over 2 months, using Captain's Log (BrainTrain Corporation) programmed for games targeting working memory, attention, and visualâspatial analysis. These games progressed in difficulty as the child's performance improved. The second arm was a âlimited CCRTâ with the same games rotated randomly from simple to moderate levels of training. The third arm was a passive control group receiving no training. All children were assessed at enrollment, 2 months (immediately following CCRT), and 3 months after CCRT completion. Results: The CCRT group had significantly greater gains through 3 months of follow-up compared to passive controls on overall Kaufman Assessment Battery for Childrenâsecond edition (KABC-II) mental processing index (pâ<â.01), planning (pâ=â.04), and knowledge (pâ=â.03). The limited CCRT group performed better than controls on learning (pâ=â.05).

Genetic epidemiological study enrolling adult black African Ugandan and Zimbabwean patients attending a UK HIV-1 clinic, irrespective of antiretroviral therapy status. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood and the presence of CYP2B6 alleles was determined by direct sequencing of all nine exons of the CYP2B6 gene. Blood was also collected, where appropriate, for determination of efavirenz concentrations. Frequency of SNPs in all patients and LoF haplotype frequencies were calculated. The relationship between the number of LoF haplotype alleles possessed and efavirenz trough concentration (ETC) was determined. Thirty-six Zimbabweans and 74 Ugandans (58 Bantu and 16 Nilotic) were recruited. The definite haplotypes determined were *6, *18, *20 and *27 as LoF and *4 as gain of function. Among those with definite genotypes, the frequency of LoF alleles was 65% [95% confidence interval (95% CI): 51-80] of Zimbabweans versus 22% (95% CI: 12-31) of Ugandan Bantus (Pâ=â10(-6)) and versus 39% (95% CI: 14-64) of Ugandan Nilotics (Pâ=â0.09). Among the 19 patients with definite genotype and with available ETCs, log ETCs were associated with a greater number of LoF haplotype alleles [848 ng/mL (nâ=â12), 1069 ng/mL (nâ=â4) and 1813 ng/mL (nâ=â3) for 0, 1 or 2 LoF haplotypes, respectively (Pâ=â0.016)]. Among Zimbabweans, LoF haplotypes constitute the majority of CYP2B6 alleles and are significantly higher in prevalence compared with Ugandans. Frequencies of LoF haplotypes and SNPs in Ugandan Nilotics appear to lie between those of Zimbabweans and Ugandan Bantus. These findings may have relevance to pharmacokinetics and dosing of efavirenz in African populations.\n\nCorrelates of Use of Timed Unprotected Intercourse to Reduce Horizontal Transmission Among Ugandan HIV Clients with Fertility Intentions\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWagner, Glenn J.; Goggin, Kathy; Mindry, Deborah; Beyeza-Kashesya, Jolly; Finocchario-Kessler, Sarah; Woldetsadik, Mahlet Atakilt; Khanakwa, Sarah; Wanyenze, Rhoda K.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nWe examined the correlates of use of safer conception methods (SCM) in a sample of 400 Ugandan HIV clients (75% female; 61% on antiretroviral therapy; 61% with HIV-negative or unknown status partners) in heterosexual relationships with fertility intentions. SCM assessed included timed unprotected intercourse, manual self-insemination, sperm washing, and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). In the 6 months prior to baseline, 47 (12%) reported using timed unprotected intercourse to reduce risk of HIV infection (or re-infection), none had used manual self-insemination or sperm washing, and 2 had used PrEP. In multiple regression analysis, correlates of use of timed unprotected intercourse included greater perceptions of partnerâs willingness to use SCM and providersâ stigma of childbearing among people living with HIV, higher SCM knowledge, and desire for a child within the next 6 months. These findings highlight the need for policy and provider training regarding integration of couplesâ safer conception counselling into HIV care.

However, only a few studies have explored the relationship between psychological distress and ART adherence among adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa. The paper examines the relationship between psychological distress and ART adherence, and effect of psychosocial resources on ART adherence. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 464 ALHIV (aged 12-19; 53% female) seeking HIV care at a large HIV treatment center in Kampala, Uganda. ALHIV were recruited during routine clinic visits. Three self-reported binary adherence measures were utilized: missed pills in the past three days, non-adherence to the prescribed medical regimen, and self-rated adherence assessed using a visual analog scale. Psychological distress was measured as a continuous variable, and computed as the mean score on a locally developed and validated 25-item symptom checklist for Ugandan ALHIV. Psychosocial resources included spirituality, religiosity, optimism, social support, and coping strategies. After adjusting for respondents' socio-demographic characteristics and psychosocial resources, a unit increase in psychological distress was associated with increased odds of missing pills in past 3 days (Odds Ratio(OR)â=â1.75; Confidence Interval (CI): 1.04-2.95), not following the prescribed regimen (ORâ=â1.63; CI: 1.08-2.46), and lower self-rated adherence (ORâ=â1.79; CI: 1.19-2.69). Psychosocial resources were associated with lower odds for non-adherence on all three self-report measures. There is a need to strengthen the psychosocial aspects of adolescent HIV care by developing interventions to identify and prevent psychological distress among Ugandan ALHIV.\n\nLarge-scale human immunodeficiency virus rapid test evaluation in a low-prevalence ugandan blood bank population.\n\nPubMed\n\nEller, Leigh A; Eller, Michael A; Ouma, Benson J; Kataaha, Peter; Bagaya, Bernard S; Olemukan, Robert L; Erima, Simon; Kawala, Lilian; de Souza, Mark S; Kibuuka, Hannah; Wabwire-Mangen, Fred; Peel, Sheila A; O'Connell, Robert J; Robb, Merlin L; Michael, Nelson L\n\n2007-10-01\n\nThe use of rapid tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has become standard in HIV testing algorithms employed in resource-limited settings. We report an extensive HIV rapid test validation study conducted among Ugandan blood bank donors at low risk for HIV infection. The operational characteristics of four readily available commercial HIV rapid test kits were first determined with 940 donor samples and were used to select a serial testing algorithm. Uni-Gold Recombigen HIV was used as the screening test, followed by HIV-1/2 STAT-PAK for reactive samples. OraQuick HIV-1 testing was performed if the first two test results were discordant. This algorithm was then tested with 5,252 blood donor samples, and the results were compared to those of enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) and Western blotting. The unadjusted algorithm sensitivity and specificity were 98.6 and 99.9%, respectively. The adjusted sensitivity and specificity were 100 and 99.96%, respectively. This HIV testing algorithm is a suitable alternative to EIAs and Western blotting for Ugandan blood donors.\n\nCharacterization of humoral responses to soluble trimeric HIV gp140 from a clade A Ugandan field isolate\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2013-01-01\n\nTrimeric soluble forms of HIV gp140 envelope glycoproteins represent one of the closest molecular structures compared to native spikes present on intact virus particles. Trimeric soluble gp140 have been generated by several groups and such molecules have been shown to induce antibodies with neutralizing activity against homologous and heterologous viruses. In the present study, we generated a recombinant trimeric soluble gp140, derived from a previously identified Ugandan A-clade HIV field isolate (gp14094UG018). Antibodies elicited in immunized rabbits show a broad binding pattern to HIV envelopes of different clades. An epitope mapping analysis reveals that, on average, the binding is mostly focused on the C1, C2, V3, V5 and C5 regions. Immune sera show neutralization activity to Tier 1 isolates of different clades, demonstrating cross clade neutralizing activity which needs to be further broadened by possible structural modifications of the clade A gp14094UG018. Our results provide a rationale for the design and evaluation of immunogens and the clade A gp14094UG018 shows promising characteristics for potential involvement in an effective HIV vaccine with broad activity.

We analyzed NVP resistance in HIV-infected Ugandan infants who received either SD NVP or extended NVP prophylaxis. We tested plasma HIV by using a genotyping assay (ViroSeq; Celera Diagnostics), a phenotypic resistance assay (PhenoSense; Monogram Biosciences), and sensitive point mutation assay (LigAmp, for K103N, Y181C, and G190A). When infants were 6 weeks old, ViroSeq detected NVP resistance in a higher proportion of infants in the extended NVP arm than in the SD NVP arm (21 of 25 [84%] vs. 12 of 24 [50%]; P = .01). Similar results were obtained with LigAmp and PhenoSense. In both study arms, infants who were HIV infected at birth frequently had NVP resistance detected. In contrast, infants in the extended NVP arm who were HIV infected after birth were more likely to have resistance detected at 6 weeks, compared with infants in the SD NVP arm. The use of extended NVP prophylaxis was also associated with detection of NVP resistance by ViroSeq at 6 months (7 of 7 [100%] infants in the extended NVP arm had resistance detected, compared with 1 of 6 [16.7%] infants in the SD NVP arm; P = .005). The use of extended NVP prophylaxis was associated with increased selection for and persistence of NVP resistance in HIV-infected Ugandan infants.\n\nSexual behavior and HIV transmission risk of Ugandan adults taking antiretroviral therapy: 3 year follow-up.\n\nPubMed\n\nApondi, Rose; Bunnell, Rebecca; Ekwaru, John Paul; Moore, David; Bechange, Stevens; Khana, Kenneth; King, Rachel; Campbell, James; Tappero, Jordan; Mermin, Jonathan\n\n2011-06-19\n\nLong-term impact of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on sexual HIV-transmission risk in Africa is unknown. We assessed sexual behavior changes and estimated HIV transmission from HIV-infected adults on ART in Uganda. Between 2003 and 2007, we enrolled and followed ART-naive HIV-infected adults in a home-based AIDS program with annual counseling and testing for cohabitating partners, participant transmission risk-reduction plans, condom distribution and prevention support for cohabitating discordant couples. We assessed participants' HIV plasma viral load and partner-specific sexual behaviors. We defined risky sex as intercourse with inconsistent/no condom use with HIV-negative or unknown serostatus partners in previous 3 months. We compared rates using Poisson regression models, estimated transmission risk using established viral load-specific transmission estimates, and documented sero-conversion rates among HIV-discordant couples. Of 928 participants, 755 (81%) had 36 months data: 94 (10%) died and 79 (9%) missing data. Sexual activity increased from 28% (baseline) to 41% [36 months (P < 0.001)]. Of sexually active participants, 22% reported risky sex at baseline, 8% at 6 months (P < 0.001), and 14% at 36 months (P = 0.018). Median viral load among those reporting risky sex was 122,500 [interquartile range (IQR) 45 100-353 000] copies/ml pre-ART at baseline and undetectable at follow-up. One sero-conversion occurred among 62 cohabitating sero-discordant partners (0.5 sero-conversions/100 person-years). At 36 months, consistent condom use was 74% with discordant partners, 55% with unknown and 46% with concordant partners. Estimated HIV transmission risk reduced 91%, from 47.3 to 4.2/1000 person-years. Despite increased sexual activity among HIV-infected Ugandans over 3 years on ART, risky sex and estimated risk of HIV transmission remained lower than baseline levels. Integrated prevention programs could reduce HIV transmission in Africa.\n\nLow prevalence of Pneumocystis jirovecii lung colonization in Ugandan HIV-infected patients hospitalized with non-Pneumocystis pneumonia.\n\nPubMed\n\nTaylor, Steve M; Meshnick, Steven R; Worodria, William; Andama, Alfred; Davis, J Lucian; Cattamanchi, Adithya; den Boon, Saskia; Yoo, Samuel D; Goodman, Carol D; Huang, Laurence\n\n2012-02-01\n\nPneumocystis jirovecii is an important opportunistic infection in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. In the developed world, P. jirovecii epidemiology is marked by frequent colonization in immunosuppressed patients, but data on the prevalence of colonization are very limited in sub-Saharan Africa, where the majority of persons living with HIV reside. Our objective was to describe the epidemiology of P. jirovecii colonization among HIV-positive patients in a cross-sectional, hospital-based study of patients admitted with suspected pneumonia in Kampala, Uganda. P. jirovecii was detectable in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from 7 (6%) of 124 consecutive patients with non-Pneumocystis pneumonia. Colonization was not associated with patient demographic or clinical information. This prevalence is substantially lower than in published studies in the developed world and suggests that there is a limited reservoir of organisms for clinical infections in this Ugandan population. These findings may partially explain the low incidence of Pneumocystis pneumonia in Uganda and other sub-Saharan African countries. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The data indicated a similar prevalence of total and epitope-specific anti-Tat IgG in 578 serum samples from HIV-infected Italian (n=302), Ugandan (n=139), and South African (n=137) subjects, using the same B clade Tat protein that is being used in vaccine trials. In particular, anti-Tat antibodies were detected in 13.2%, 10.8%, and 13.9% of HIV-1-infected individuals from Italy, Uganda, and South Africa, respectively. Sequence analysis results indicated a high similarity of Tat from the different circulating viruses with BH-10 Tat, particularly in the 1-58 amino acid region, which contains most of the immunogenic epitopes. These data indicate an effective cross-recognition of a B-clade laboratory strain-derived Tat protein vaccine by individuals infected with different local viruses, owing to the high similarity of Tat epitopes.\n\nBrief Report: Food Insufficiency Is Associated With Lack of Sustained Viral Suppression Among HIV-Infected Pregnant and Breastfeeding Ugandan Women\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNatureeba, Paul; Nyafwono, Dorcas; Plenty, Albert; Mwesigwa, Julia; Nzarubara, Bridget; Clark, Tamara D.; Ruel, Theodore D.; Achan, Jane; Charlebois, Edwin D.; Cohan, Deborah; Kamya, Moses R.; Havlir, Diane V.; Young, Sera L.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAbstract: Food insecurity is associated with poor virologic outcomes, but this has not been studied during pregnancy and breastfeeding. We assessed sustained viral suppression from 8 weeks on antiretroviral therapy to 48 weeks postpartum among 171 pregnant and breastfeeding Ugandan women; 74.9% experienced food insufficiency. In multivariable analysis, food insufficiency [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.38, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.16 to 0.91], higher pretreatment HIV-1 RNA (aOR 0.55 per 10-fold increase, 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.82), and lopinavir/ritonavir versus efavirenz (aOR 0.49, 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.96) were associated with lower odds of sustained viral suppression. Interventions to address food security may improve virologic outcomes among HIV-infected women.

Secondarily, to examine factors associated with both sexual behavior and ART independently, that may help to assess the impact that ART is likely to have on the HIV epidemic. Retrospective analysis of data from an open cohort. ART roll-out began in the cohort in 2004. Using 3-monthly data from 2002 to 2009, we conducted regression and descriptive analyses to examine associations between timing of ART initiation and sexual behavior among HIV-infected, and timing of ART availability and sexual behavior among HIV-uninfected. We also examined partner turnover rates, and the proportion of HIV-infected on ART - two important factors for modeling the potential impact of ART on the HIV epidemic. Risky sexual behavior among HIV-infected people rose on several indicators after ART initiation, but not to levels higher than two or more years before initiation. Some evidence suggests that the availability of ART may impact risky behavior among HIV-uninfected people, although this was inconsistent across different reported behavior variables. The HIV-uninfected is larger than the HIV-infected population. If risky behavior among this population increases due to the feeling of safety that ART provides, this will affect the impact of ART on the HIV epidemic. Policy makers are urged to intensify messages associating sexual behavior and HIV and to target both HIV-infected and uninfected people.\n\nThe effect of malnutrition on the pharmacokinetics and virologic outcomes of lopinavir, efavirenz and nevirapine in food insecure HIV-infected children in Tororo, Uganda.\n\nPubMed\n\nBartelink, Imke H; Savic, Rada M; Dorsey, Grant; Ruel, Theodore; Gingrich, David; Scherpbier, Henriette J; Capparelli, Edmund; Jullien, Vincent; Young, Sera L; Achan, Jane; Plenty, Albert; Charlebois, Edwin; Kamya, Moses; Havlir, Diane; Aweeka, Francesca\n\n2015-03-01\n\nMalnutrition may impact the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of antiretroviral medications and virologic responses in HIV-infected children. The authors therefore evaluated the PK of nevirapine (NVP), efavirenz (EFV) and lopinavir (LPV) in associations with nutritional status in a cohort of HIV-infected Ugandan children. Sparse dried blood spot samples from Ugandan children were used to estimate plasma concentrations. Historical PK data from children from 3 resource-rich countries (RRC) were utilized to develop the PK models. Concentrations in 330 dried blood spot from 163 Ugandan children aged 0.7-7 years were analyzed in reference to plasma PK data (1189 samples) from 204 children from RRC aged 0.5-12 years. Among Ugandan children, 48% was malnourished (underweight, thin or stunted). Compared to RRC, Ugandan children exhibited reduced bioavailability of EFV and LPV; 11% (P=0.045) and 18% (P=0.008), respectively. In contrast, NVP bioavailability was 46% higher in Ugandan children (P<0.001) with a trend toward greater bioavailability when malnourished. Children receiving LPV, EFV or NVP had comparable risk of virologic failure. Among children on NVP, low height and weight for age Z scores were associated with reduced risk of virologic failure (P=0.034, P=0.068, respectively). Ugandan children demonstrated lower EFV and LPV and higher NVP exposure compared to children in RRC, perhaps reflecting the consequence of malnutrition on bioavailability. In children receiving NVP, the relation between exposure, malnutrition and outcome turned out to be marginally significant. Further investigations are warranted using more intensive PK measurements and adequate adherence assessments, to further assess causes of virologic failure in Ugandan children.\n\nCohort profile: the German ClinSurv HIV project--a multicentre open clinical cohort study supplementing national HIV surveillance.\n\nPubMed\n\nBÃ¤tzing-Feigenbaum, J; Kollan, C; KÃ¼hne, A; Matysiak-Klose, D; Gunsenheimer-Bartmeyer, B; Hamouda, O\n\n2011-05-01\n\nNew forms of HIV/AIDS therapy require new surveillance instruments to meet shifting public health demands. The Clinical Surveillance of HIV Disease (ClinSurv HIV) project was established in 1999 as a collaboration between major HIV treatment centres in Germany and the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). The project contributes to national HIV surveillance and focuses on the changing epidemiology of HIV/AIDS after the introduction of new therapies in 1995. ClinSurv HIV is designed as an open multicentre observational cohort study of HIV-infected patients. Anonymized data on diagnoses, treatment and laboratory parameters are collected in a standardized format. Data are currently sampled biannually via 11 centres specializing in HIV diagnosis and care within the legal framework of the German Protection against Infection Act [Infektionsschutzgesetz (IfSG)]. A total of 14874 patients were enrolled in the study by 30 June 2009. Of these, 10221 patients (68.7%) were enrolled after 1 January 1999 and 6006 patients (40.4%) were known to have been diagnosed as positive for HIV before 1999. Evaluation indicators, such as the number of newly enrolled patients per half-year period, loss to follow-up, completeness of data per case, availability of data per possible clinical contact, and internal quality control parameters, show a very stable evolution in the cohort, which although open, can be observed. Comparison with the national HIV surveillance data suggests a high degree of representativeness according to major demographic variables. Bearing in mind the obvious strengths and weaknesses discussed, the German ClinSurv HIV cohort provides a broad range of research opportunities in the field of HIV/AIDS both within Germany and in international collaborative research.\n\nPrevalence and Correlates of Use of Safer Conception Methods in a Prospective Cohort of Ugandan HIV-Affected Couples with Fertility Intentions.\n\nPubMed\n\nWagner, Glenn J; Linnemayr, Sebastian; Goggin, Kathy; Mindry, Deborah; Beyeza-Kashesya, Jolly; Finocchario-Kessler, Sarah; Robinson, Eric; Birungi, Josephine; Wanyenze, Rhoda K\n\n2017-08-01\n\nWe examined the prevalence and correlates of safer conception methods (SCM) use in HIV-affected couples with fertility intentions. A prospective cohort of 400 HIV clients in Uganda who had fertility intentions with their partner was surveyed every 6Â months for 24Â months. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine individual, relationship and provider level predictors of SCM use. Over one-third (35%) reported any use of timed unprotected intercourse (TUI) during the study; use of other SCM was rare. Baseline predictors of any TUI use included lower social support, greater perceived provider stigma of childbearing, greater SCM awareness, greater control over sexual decision making in the relationship, inconsistent condom use, and the belief that a desire for childbearing impedes condom use. These findings highlight the need for policy and provider training regarding integration of safer conception counselling into family planning and reproductive health services for people living with HIV.\n\nThe MANGUA Project: A Population-Based HIV Cohort in Guatemala\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGarcÃ­a, Juan Ignacio; Samayoa, Blanca; SabidÃ³, Meritxell; Prieto, Luis Alberto; Nikiforov, Mikhail; PinzÃ³n, Rodolfo; Santa Marina de LeÃ³n, Luis Roberto; Ortiz, JosÃ© Fernando; Ponce, Ernesto; MejÃ­a, Carlos Rodolfo; Arathoon, Eduardo; Casabona, Jordi; Study Group, The Mangua Cohort\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIntroduction. The MANGUA cohort is an ongoing multicenter, observational study of people living with HIV/AIDS in Guatemala. The cohort is based on the MANGUA application which is an electronic database to capture essential data from the medical records of HIV patients in care. Methods. The cohort enrolls HIV-positive adults â¥16 years of age. A predefined set of sociodemographic, behavioral, clinical, and laboratory data are registered at entry to the cohort study. Results. As of October 1st, 2012, 21 697 patients had been included in the MANGUA cohort (median age: 33 years, 40.3% female). At enrollment 74.1% had signs of advanced HIV infection and only 56.3% had baseline CD4 cell counts. In the first 12 months after starting antiretroviral treatment 26.9% (n = 3938) of the patients were lost to the program. Conclusions. The implementation of a cohort of HIV-positive patients in care in Guatemala is feasible and has provided national HIV indicators to monitor and evaluate the HIV epidemic. The identified percentages of late presenters and high rates of LTFU will help the Ministry to target their current efforts in improving access to diagnosis and care.

Sera obtained from 7895 individuals in a rural population survey were tested using an algorithm based on two different EIA systems: Recombigen HIV-1 EIA and Wellcozyme HIV-1 Recombinant. Alternative algorithms were assessed using negative or confirmed positive sera. None of the 227 sera classified as unequivocably negative by the two assays were positive by Western blot. Of 192 sera unequivocably positive by both assays, four were seronegative by Western blot. The possibility of technical error cannot be ruled out in three of these. One of the alternative algorithms assessed classified all borderline or discordant assay results as negative had a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 98.4%. The cost of this algorithm is one-third that of the conventional algorithm. Our evaluation suggests that high specificity and sensitivity can be obtained without using Western blot and at a considerable reduction in cost.\n\nCohort profile: The Canadian HIV Women's Sexual and Reproductive Health Cohort Study (CHIWOS).\n\nPubMed\n\nLoutfy, Mona; de Pokomandy, Alexandra; Kennedy, V Logan; Carter, Allison; O'Brien, Nadia; Proulx-Boucher, KarÃ¨ne; Ding, Erin; Lewis, Johanna; Nicholson, Valerie; Beaver, Kerrigan; Greene, Saara; Tharao, Wangari; Benoit, Anita; Dubuc, DaniÃ¨le; Thomas-Pavanel, Jamie; Sereda, Paul; Jabbari, Shahab; Shurgold, Jayson H; Colley, Guillaume; Hogg, Robert S; Kaida, Angela\n\n2017-01-01\n\nGlobally, women are at increased vulnerability to HIV due to biological, social, structural, and political reasons. Women living with HIV also experience unique issues related to their medical and social healthcare, which makes a clinical care model specific to their needs worthy of exploration. Furthermore, there is a dearth of research specific to women living with HIV. Research for this population has often been narrowly focused on pregnancy-related issues without considering their complex structural inequalities, social roles, and healthcare and biological needs. For these reasons, we have come together, as researchers, clinicians and community members in Canada, to develop the Canadian HIV Women's Sexual and Reproductive Health Cohort Study (CHIWOS) to investigate the concept of women-centred HIV care (WCHC) and its impact on the overall, HIV, women's, mental, sexual, and reproductive health outcomes of women living with HIV. Here, we present the CHIWOS cohort profile, which describes the cohort and presents preliminary findings related to perceived WCHC. CHIWOS is a prospective, observational cohort study of women living with HIV in British Columbia (BC), Ontario, and Quebec. Two additional Canadian provinces, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, will join the cohort in 2018. Using community-based research principles, CHIWOS engages women living with HIV throughout the entire research process meeting the requirements of the 'Greater Involvement of People living with HIV/AIDS'. Study data are collected through an interviewer-administered questionnaire that uses a web-based platform.

Methods Caregiver ratings for the BRIEF and CBCL were obtained for two independent samples of school-aged children: 106 children (5-12 years old, 50% males) with a history of severe malaria, and on 144 HIV-infected children (5-12 years old, 58% males) in Uganda. Exploratory factor analysis was used to evaluate the factor structure of the 8 sub-scales for the BRIEF and the 8 scales of the CBCL to determine correlation. Results Overall, children in the severe malaria group had higher (increased symptom) BRIEF and CBCL scores than children in the HIV-infected group. We identified 3 factors that provided a reasonable fit to the data and could be characterized as 3 specific domains: 1) Metacognition, which consisted of the scales in the BRIEF Metacognition domain; 2) Behavioral Adjustment, which was comprised of the scales in the BRIEF Behavioral Regulation domain and the Externalizing Symptoms scales in the CBCL; and 3) Emotional Adjustment, which mainly consisted of the Internalizing Symptoms scales in the CBCL. The BRIEF Behavior Regulation and CBCL Externalizing Symptoms scales, however, did overlap in terms of assessing similar behavior symptoms. These findings were consistent across the severe malaria and HIV-infected samples of children. Conclusion The BRIEF and CBCL instruments offer distinct, yet complementary, assessments of behavior in clinical pediatric populations in the Ugandan context, supporting the use of these measures for similar research settings.

Lucian; Segal, Mark; Blackburn, Elizabeth; Huang, Laurence\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIntroduction HIV infection is a risk factor for opportunistic pneumonias such as tuberculosis (TB) and for age-associated health complications. Short telomeres, markers of biological aging, are also associated with an increased risk of age-associated diseases and mortality. Our goals were to use a single cohort of HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals hospitalized with pneumonia to assess whether shortened telomere length was associated with HIV infection, TB diagnosis, and 2-month mortality. Methods This was a sub-study of the IHOP Study, a prospective observational study. Participants consisted of 184 adults admitted to Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda who underwent evaluation for suspected TB and were followed for 2 months. Standardized questionnaires were administered to collect demographic and clinical data. PBMCs were isolated and analyzed using quantitative PCR to determine telomere length. The association between HIV infection, demographic and clinical characteristics, and telomere length was assessed, as were the associations between telomere length, TB diagnosis and 2-month mortality. Variables with a Pâ¤0.2 in bivariate analysis were included in multivariate models. Results No significant demographic or clinical differences were observed between the HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected subjects. Older age (P<0.0001), male gender (P = 0.04), total pack-years smoked (P<0.001), alcohol consumption in the past year (P = 0.12), and asthma (P = 0.08) were all associated (Pâ¤0.2) with shorter telomere length in bivariate analysis. In multivariate analysis adjusting for these five variables, HIV-positive participants had significantly shorter telomeres than HIV-negative participants (Î² = -0.0621, 95% CI -0.113 to -0.011, P = 0.02). Shortened telomeres were not associated with TB or short-term mortality. Conclusions The association between HIV infection and shorter telomeres suggests that HIV may play a role in cellular senescence and biological aging and\n\nCOBA-Cohort: a prospective cohort of HIV-negative men who have sex with men, attending community-based HIV testing services in five European countries (a study protocol).\n\nPubMed\n\nLorente, Nicolas; FernÃ ndez-LÃ³pez, Laura; Fuertes, Ricardo; Rojas Castro, Daniela; Pichon, FranÃ§ois; Cigan, Bojan; Chanos, Sophocles; Meireles, Paula; Lucas, Raquel; Morel, StÃ©phane; Slaaen Kaye, Per; AgustÃ­, Cristina; Klavs, Irena; Platteau, Tom; Casabona, Jordi\n\n2016-07-13\n\nCommunity-based voluntary counselling and testing (CBVCT) services for men who have sex with men (MSM) can reach those most-at-risk and provide an environment for gay men that is likely to be non-stigmatising. Longitudinal data on the behaviour of HIV-negative MSM are scarce in Europe. The aim of this protocol, developed during the Euro HIV Early Diagnosis And Treatment (EDAT) project, is to implement a multicentre community-based cohort of HIV-negative MSM attending 15 CBVCT services in 5 European countries. (1) To describe the patterns of CBVCT use, (2) to estimate HIV incidence, and to identify determinants of (3) HIV seroconversion and (4) HIV and/or sexually transmitted infection (STI) test-seeking behaviour. All MSM aged 18â years or over and who had a negative HIV test result are invited to participate in the COmmunity-BAsed Cohort (COBA-Cohort). Study enrolment started in February 2015, and is due to continue for at least 12â months at each study site. Follow-up frequency depends on the testing recommendations in each country (at least 1 test per year). Sociodemographic data are collected at baseline; baseline and follow-up questionnaires both gather data on attitudes and perceptions, discrimination, HIV/STI testing history, sexual behaviour, condom use, and pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis. Descriptive, exploratory and multivariate analyses will be performed to address the main research objectives of this study, using appropriate statistical tests and models. These analyses will be performed on the whole cohort data and stratified by study site or country. The study was approved by the Public Health authorities of each country where the study is being implemented. Findings from the COBA-Cohort study will be summarised in a report to the European Commission, and in leaflets to be distributed to study participants. Articles and conference abstracts will be submitted to peer-reviewed journals and conferences.

Purpose Examine the impact of an Internet-based HIV prevention program on Information-Motivation-Behavior Skills Model-related constructs. Methods Three hundred and sixty-six sexually experienced and inexperienced students 12-18+ years-old in Mbarara, Uganda were randomly assigned to: the five-lesson CyberSenga program or treatment-as-usual. Half of the intervention participants were further randomized to a booster session. Assessments were collected at three and six months post-baseline. Results Participantsâ HIV-related information improved over time at a greater rate for the intervention groups compared to the control group. Motivation for condom use changed to a greater degree over time for the intervention group â especially those in the intervention+booster group - compared to the control group. Behavioral skills for condom use, and motivation and behavioral skills for abstinence were statistically similar over time for both groups. Conclusions CyberSenga improves HIV preventive information and motivation to use condoms.

The objective of the study is to determine the impact of HIV on prevalence and incidence of respiratory disease in the current era of effective antiretroviral treatment. A pulmonary-specific questionnaire was administered yearly for three years to participants in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) and Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS). Adjusted prevalence ratios for respiratory symptoms, testing, or diagnoses and adjusted incidence rate ratios for diagnoses in HIV-infected compared to HIV-uninfected participants were determined. Risk factors for outcomes in HIV-infected individuals were modeled. Baseline pulmonary questionnaires were completed by 907 HIV-infected and 989 HIV-uninfected participants in the MACS cohort and by 1405 HIV-infected and 571 HIV-uninfected participants in the WIHS cohort. In MACS, dyspnea, cough, wheezing, sleep apnea, and incident chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were more common in HIV-infected participants. In WIHS, wheezing and sleep apnea were more common in HIV-infected participants. Smoking (MACS and WIHS) and greater body mass index (WIHS) were associated with more respiratory symptoms and diagnoses. While sputum studies, bronchoscopies, and chest computed tomography scans were more likely to be performed in HIV-infected participants, pulmonary function tests were no more common in HIV-infected individuals. Respiratory symptoms in HIV-infected individuals were associated with history of pneumonia, cardiovascular disease, or use of HAART. A diagnosis of asthma or COPD was associated with previous pneumonia. In these two cohorts, HIV is an independent risk factor for several respiratory symptoms and pulmonary diseases including COPD and sleep apnea.

To improve cancer ascertainment and estimate cancer incidence, we linked records of adults (agedââ¥â16 years) on antiretroviral treatment (ART) enrolled at Sinikithemba HIV clinic, McCord Hospital in KwaZuluâNatal (KZN) with the cancer records of public laboratories in KZN province using probabilistic record linkage (PRL) methods. We calculated incidence rates for all cancers, Kaposi sarcoma (KS), cervix, nonâHodgkin's lymphoma and nonâAIDS defining cancers (NADCs) before and after inclusion of linkageâidentified cancers with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A total of 8,721 records of HIVâpositive patients were linked with 35,536 cancer records. Between 2004 and 2010, we identified 448 cancers, 82% (nâ=â367) were recorded in the cancer registry only, 10% (nâ=â43) in the HIV cohort only and 8% (nâ=â38) both in the HIV cohort and the cancer registry. The overall cancer incidence rate in patients starting ART increased from 134 (95% CI 91â212) to 877 (95% CI 744â1,041) per 100,000 personâyears after inclusion of linkageâidentified cancers. Incidence rates were highest for KS (432, 95% CI 341â555), followed by cervix (259, 95% CI 179â390) and NADCs (294, 95% CI 223â395) per 100,000 personâyears. Ascertainment of cancer in HIV cohorts is incomplete, PRL is both feasible and essential for cancer ascertainment.

We first conducted formative research among 56 pregnant and lactating women to select a supplement regimen. Acceptability and use of the supplementation regimen [35 sachets of lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS) and 4 or 6 kg of instant soy porridge for the household provided monthly] were evaluated among 87 pregnant women. Organoleptic assessments of LNS were favorable. Participants reported consuming LNS a mean of 6.1 days per week, and adherence to recommended consumption behaviors (e.g. frequency, quantity, not sharing) was >80%. Few women reported negative social consequences of supplementation. The majority of participants also consumed most of the porridge intended for the household. In sum, LNS was acceptable and used regularly. Larger studies to evaluate physical and psychosocial consequences of LNS during pregnancy among HIV-infected women are warranted.

It was formed through the linkage of nine provincial treatment, surveillance and administrative databases. This open cohort allows for bidirectional analyses from 1996 onward and is refreshed annually. Extensive data collection for cohort members includes demographic information, detailed clinical and laboratory data, complete prescription drug use including antiretroviral agents, and information on health service utilization encompassing inpatient and outpatient care, addictions treatment and palliative care. This cohort provides an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate, over an extended time period, patterns and determinants of key outcomes including engagement in the cascade of HIV care from diagnosis to treatment to viral suppression as well as monitoring trends in medical costs, health outcomes and other key healthcare delivery indicators at a population level with wide-ranging, high-quality data.

In 2008 a rapid UPS assessment estimated TB prevalence at 654/100 000, three times that of the general population (183/100 000). Although treatment programs exist, little is known about treatment completion in sub-Saharan African prisons. METHODS We conducted a retrospective study of Ugandan prisoners diagnosed with TB from June 2011 to November 2012. We analyzed TB diagnosis, TB-HIV comorbidity and treatment completion from national registers and tracked prison transfers and releases. RESULTS A total of 469 prisoners were diagnosed with TB over the 1.5-year period (incidence 955/100 000 person-years). Of 466 prisoners starting treatment, 48% completed treatment, 43% defaulted, 5% died and 4% were currently on treatment. During treatment, 12% of prisoners remaining in the same prison defaulted, 53% of transfers defaulted and 81% of those released were lost to follow-up. The odds of defaulting were 8.36 times greater among prisoners who were transferred during treatment. CONCLUSIONS TB incidence and treatment default are high among Ugandan prisoners. Strategies to improve treatment completion and prevent multidrug resistance could include avoiding transfer of TB patients, improving communications between prisons to ensure treatment follow-up after transfer and facilitating transfer to community clinics for released prisoners.

The objective of the study is to determine the impact of HIV on prevalence and incidence of respiratory disease in the current era of effective antiretroviral treatment. Methods A pulmonary-specific questionnaire was administered yearly for three years to participants in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) and Womenâs Interagency HIV Study (WIHS). Adjusted prevalence ratios for respiratory symptoms, testing, or diagnoses and adjusted incidence rate ratios for diagnoses in HIV-infected compared to HIV-uninfected participants were determined. Risk factors for outcomes in HIV-infected individuals were modeled. Results Baseline pulmonary questionnaires were completed by 907 HIV-infected and 989 HIV-uninfected participants in the MACS cohort and by 1405 HIV-infected and 571 HIV-uninfected participants in the WIHS cohort. In MACS, dyspnea, cough, wheezing, sleep apnea, and incident chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were more common in HIV-infected participants. In WIHS, wheezing and sleep apnea were more common in HIV-infected participants. Smoking (MACS and WIHS) and greater body mass index (WIHS) were associated with more respiratory symptoms and diagnoses. While sputum studies, bronchoscopies, and chest computed tomography scans were more likely to be performed in HIV-infected participants, pulmonary function tests were no more common in HIV-infected individuals. Respiratory symptoms in HIV-infected individuals were associated with history of pneumonia, cardiovascular disease, or use of HAART. A diagnosis of asthma or COPD was associated with previous pneumonia. Conclusions In these two cohorts, HIV is an independent risk factor for several respiratory symptoms and pulmonary diseases including COPD and sleep apnea.

We therefore examined the relationship between maternal BMI at study enrollment, gestational weight gain (GWG), and hemoglobin concentration (Hb) among 166 women initiating cART in rural Uganda. Prospective cohort. HIV-infected, ART-naÃ¯ve pregnant women were enrolled between 12 and 28 weeks gestation and treated with a protease inhibitor or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based combination regimen. Nutritional status was assessed monthly. Neonatal anthropometry was examined at birth. Outcomes were evaluated using multivariate analysis. Mean GWG was 0.17 kg/week, 14.6% of women experienced weight loss during pregnancy, and 44.9% were anemic. Adverse fetal outcomes included low birth weight (LBW) (19.6%), preterm delivery (17.7%), fetal death (3.9%), stunting (21.1%), small-for-gestational age (15.1%), and head-sparing growth restriction (26%). No infants were HIV-infected. Gaining <0.1 kg/week was associated with LBW, preterm delivery, and a composite adverse obstetric/fetal outcome. Maternal weight at 7 months gestation predicted LBW. For each g/dL higher mean Hb, the odds of small-for-gestational age decreased by 52%. In our cohort of HIV-infected women initiating cART during pregnancy, grossly inadequate GWG was common. Infants whose mothers gained <0.1 kg/week were at increased risk for LBW, preterm delivery, and composite adverse birth outcomes. cART by itself may not be sufficient for decreasing the burden of adverse birth outcomes among HIV-infected women.

Cross-sectional analysis within the Hawaii Aging With HIV Cohort. We calculated the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) among 145 cohort participants. Values were compared to concurrent neuropsychological test performance and cognitive diagnoses. Hypertension, body mass index (BMI), and non-Caucasian self-identity were directly related to insulin resistance (IR); however, age, CD4 lymphocyte count, and rates of treatment with HAART were not. In logistic regression analyses and stratifying cognition status on a 3-tiered scale (normal, minor cognitive motor disorder (MCMD), and HIV-associated dementia (HAD)), we identified an increased risk of meeting a higher diagnostic category as HOMA-IR increased (OR, 1.12; 95% CI: 1.003 to 1.242 per unit of HOMA-IR, P = 0.044). In linear regression models and among nondiabetic participants, an increasing degree of IR was associated with lower performance on neuropsychological summary scores. IR is associated with cognitive dysfunction in this contemporary HIV-1 cohort enriched with older individuals. Metabolic dysfunction may contribute to the multifactorial pathogenesis of cognitive impairment in the era of HAART.\n\nSteady State Bioequivalence of Generic and Innovator Formulations of Stavudine, Lamivudine, and Nevirapine in HIV-Infected Ugandan Adults\n\nPubMed Central\n\nByakika-Tusiime, Jayne; Chinn, Leslie W.; Oyugi, Jessica H.; Obua, Celestino; Bangsberg, David R.; Kroetz, Deanna L.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nBackground Generic antiretroviral therapy is the mainstay of HIV treatment in resource-limited settings, yet there is little evidence confirming the bioequivalence of generic and brand name formulations. We compared the steady-state pharmacokinetics of lamivudine, stavudine and nevirapine in HIV-infected subjects who were receiving a generic formulation (TriomuneÂ®) or the corresponding brand formulations (EpivirÂ®, ZeritÂ®, and ViramuneÂ®). Methodology/Principal Findings An open-label, randomized, crossover study was carried out in 18 HIV-infected Ugandan subjects stabilized on Triomune-40. Subjects received lamivudine (150 mg), stavudine (40 mg), and nevirapine (200 mg) in either the generic or brand formulation twice a day for 30 days, before switching to the other formulation.
