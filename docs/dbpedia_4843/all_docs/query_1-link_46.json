        "text": "Attention all history enthusiasts and curious minds! Did you know there's a hidden treasure nestled in the heart of Mayfair that's simply brimming with stories and scientific wonders? It's the Royal Institution, and it's a place that's sure to ignite your imagination! This institution isn't just a building; it's a hive of history and discovery that goes back centuries. The Royal Institution is famous for its Christmas lectures, but it's much more than that. When you step through the doors, you're walking in the same halls where groundbreaking scientists like Humphry Davy and Michael Faraday made discoveries that changed the world! Imagine being in the very room where they experimented with chemicals and created the first electric generators. It's like taking a step back in time and watching the birth of modern science. And the best part? The Royal Institution is still a buzzing center for scientific education and research. They work hard to make science exciting and accessible to everyone, whether you're young or just young at heart. Now, why haven't more people heard about this amazing place? It's a bit of a mystery! Many of us might have seen the exciting Christmas lectures on TV, but not realized where they were being broadcast from. It's like having a superstar in your neighborhood and not knowing they live right next door. So next time you're wandering through Mayfair, keep an eye out for the Royal Institution. Whether you love the thrill of a science experiment or just want to soak up some history where great minds once stood, this is a spot you can't miss. Get ready to be wowed by the wonders of science and the stories of the past, all under one roof! Now isn't that something to chat about with your friends?\n\nOrganising an academic conference can be beneficial for a researcher’s career. It helps to establish the researcher in their academic field, it’s a great addition to an academic CV, and conferences can be a valuable networking opportunity, in particular for the organisers. Steveen Ulysse has written a blogpost for our University of Glasgow PGR Blog about the journey of organising the inaugural James McCune Smith Conference 2023. Steveen outlines some of the challenges, triumphs and insights gained from this ground-breaking conference, organised to highlight the contributions of Black scholars in UK Higher Education. Steveen's reflections are a unique perspective on organising an event which resonates with James McCune Smith's legacy. \"Organising a conference - especially one that surfaces themes close to you - is a rewarding feat. But by no means an easy one. I remember the call made to the inaugural cohort of James McCune Smith scholars (of which I am a member) for volunteers to organise the very first JMS conference. Looking back, I can attest to having no idea of the level of work, and commitment such an endeavour would entail, particularly being the first of its kind not just in Glasgow, but in the United Kingdom. I and five others answered the call, excited by the prospect of having our collective ideas stamped on the proceedings, but not really knowing what we were letting ourselves in for!\" https://lnkd.in/exuDR4md #researchers #universities #conferences #networking"
