        "text": "Carioca had had a couple of absolute blinders for us, but more often than not, he had been merely OK. I had expected greater things in his two seasons so far. That said, I’d have liked to give him another shot. Alas, he was desperate to go there, but the hefty profit from when we signed him for €14.25m, combined with the fact that it’s another non-EU player off of the books, means I’m not too annoyed.\n\nColin Prent’s departure on the other hand was a sickener. As last season had gone on, he had begun to impress me more and more, and I was planning on having him in the starting eleven, next to Ugarte in the centre of the park. But he was furious that I hadn’t offered him a contract. I tried, but I couldn’t get through his agent (don’t get me started on player/agent interactions/promises, the system is pure shite). To make matters worse, he’s even gone for a slight loss.\n\nMubenga was one of two wide attackers to permanently depart as a result of our planned formation change. I didn’t particularly want him to stay in Ligue 1, but Monaco were his only suitors. Rabie Aribi also left earlier in the summer, for a meagre €11.5m (plus 20% profit) to Rangers. Melvin Camara’s gone out on loan, while both Mazek and Mazouch will be playing in different positions this year.\n\nJosé Gutiérrez has been on the books for three full years, since Ted picked him up on a free transfer from Peruvian amateur football. Three year-long loan spells, firstly at Paços de Ferreira, then Rennes, and finally Hertha Berlin, have seen him develop marvellously, adding three or four points to most of his central defender attributes.\n\nI was in the market for a CB this summer, but the choices were limited to players that would only go for €100m+, players inferior to José, and Josko Gvardiol, who wanted staggering wages, so I’ve stuck with what we’ve got instead. It does mean I’ve got a non-EU problem again, as Gutiérrez can’t be registered until Ugarte’s paperwork to become a French national comes through.\n\nJarne Vandendriessche’s year in Germany went very well. He top scored for Mainz with 16 goals as they finished in an impressive fourth place. He’ll be vying with Hwan Solo and Nestorovic for a starting role this season.\n\nAfter signing in Ted’s very last window, Wesley performed superbly for Juventus, winning the Coppa Italia, and breaking into the Brazilian national side, which finished third at the 2026 World Cup. It’s fair to say I rate him a lot.\n\nInitially, I had planned to give Mazouch a go up top, with Cvitkovic in the centre of the park, meaning my first team squad numbers would’ve been 1-11. It didn’t take long to make a change though, with Mazouch a pale imitation of himself up front, and Cvitkovic looking like he needed more time to settle. So the first XI for most of the first half of the season was the below:\n\nAt this point, I did have a mounting concern about the wide players. Apart from our Czech new boy, no-one had been impressing on the wings, with former mainstays, Mazek and Camara being especially useless. After an impressive start to the season, firing in 9 goals in the first two months, Nestorovic had gone quiet, with only 2 goals since the beginning of November. Hwan Solo had 6 goals from his limited appearances by this point…was it time to properly bust out the new hope?\n\nJanuary ‘26:\n\nTed certainly thought so, giving him a start and an appearance off of the bench in the Coupe. Solo duly bagged five goals, and although two were penalties, a) the rest of the squad are shit at penalties, and b) three goals in 115 minutes is still pretty good. Ted’s got us through to the Coupe quarters again, though the eleventh round victory, 4-3 over Nantes, was a close run thing.\n\nTed finished his tenure with six victories from six, the three in the league taking us eight points clear at the top, with PSG surprisingly dropping points at Nancy.\n\nJanuary Transfer Window:\n\nTed’s final window was a relatively quiet one, in terms of its impact on the first team squad anyway. He did spend another €40m on players for the future, one of whom I love the look of, but he’s yet a further non-EU headache. We’ve loaned him to Juventus, and if there is another season, I hope he’ll be a part of it.\n\nActually, looking back on it now, I think maybe Ted was trolling me. He signed eight players, and seven of them are non-EU…\n\nThe Toulouse 2 squad is heaving with players on various loan deals. At the very least, they’re a future revenue stream.\n\nFebruary to May ‘26:\n\nThe Champions League is where the real fight is, and this season the knockout stages presented us with Inter Milan, and a chance to face off against Sarmiento and Vlahovic. Well, the former anyway. After spunking €30m on our Serbian target man, Inter couldn’t register him at all as they had exceeded their own non-EU quota. Poor lamb.\n\nAfter our pretty poor showing in the group stage, I wasn’t anticipating much from this tie, but the first leg was a doozy. An end to end first half finished three apiece, with Sarmiento naturally amongst the scorers.\n\nThe second half continued in a similar vein, although with less clinical finishing. Colin Prent banged one in from the edge of the box in the 53rd minute, and Arnau Tenas confidently claimed corner after corner, to see us take a slender lead to Milan.\n\nSigned from SPO (FEO FEEL FREE TO PUT THE REAL NAMES IN BTW LOLZ) (Editor’s note: no.) for €14.25m. It looks like he can do a job anywhere in the midfield, and is good cover for Manuel Ugarte.\n\nMost of the departures were on loan or for nominal fees, which included two first-team defenders who could do a job at full back. All-in-all, the business in January looks a disaster – I’ve weakened the defensive options by choice after being forced into the sale of Alonso following my failure to sort a contract this time last year (he may still have asked for a lot, but I didn’t even check). My reasoning is vaguely simple – Sarmiento can play at left back (just about). In addition, Sylla 2.0 needs minutes to become as good as Sylla 1.0, and the guys I’ve loaned out need more regular game time in order to fulfil their potential.\n\nIt makes sense in my head. I trust that FEO will be able to get the most out of the squad regardless, and maybe find a creative solution to the left back issue. Champions League and Ligue Un glory awaits…\n\nFEO:\n\nLet’s cover the positives first. Carioca looks a great prospect, and on paper we now have five top players for the centre of the park, with a nice variety of different skills between them.\n\nAlthough the first team squad is smaller than previous seasons, for nine of the ten outfield positions, the quality of back up has never been better.\n\nLeft back though. Left back Ted. The Alonso situation is not on Ted in my opinion, and the money we got for him was a relief. The failure to replace him? I’m not too irked by that, sometimes the right player isn’t there for the right money.\n\nBut Ted. Why do you be loaning out two potential solutions!? You absolute madman. Especially loaning out the wonderfully named, Christ Merali. Following Sarmiento’s injury, Merali had filled the first team role solidly, if unspectacularly.\n\nNot satisfied with that, Ted then also loaned out Sawadogo, a versatile, ambipedal young defender, who theoretically would have been perfect as a covering squad player for the remainder of the season.\n\nNext, just to make extra sure, Ted went into the Toulouse 2 squad and sold Mulugeta, who I admit, was not a great left back prospect, but had played a few minutes last year and was earmarked by me as an option if things got really desperate.\n\nWhy Ted, why!? :crying_cat_face: It’s not just that we don’t have back-up, we don’t have a single left back over the age of 16! I think someone got carried away by Sarmiento’s performances in January. Yes, he played well three times for Ted, but one of those appearances was on the wing, and two were against lower league teams in the Coupe.\n\nFortunately, I am mighty.\n\nFebruary and March 2025:\n\nAnd so is Tony:\n\nWhy the end to the big pause?\n\nWell, I’m an FMer, so it’s only natural to put out a couple of weekly posts immediately after alluding to an end.\n\nWe had a bit of a backlog to attend to, and then for the first time in a long time, I found myself “in the zone”. The final 14 games of this season all took place on the same day, with the last 11 happening in one session. It’s been about four months since I last played like that. Seeing the team play great football and getting results was good fun, and of course, I feared turning off due to the ever-present peril of succumbing to a classic #MythMike scenario.\n\nMy issues with FM21 remain the same, though I have partially mitigated some of them by handing off some responsibilities to my (in-game) Director of Football, Tomáš Rosický, and choosing to ignore certain other issues.\n\nAnyhow, we’re basically fully caught up now. Ugarte’s demanded a new deal, and I’ve sent the save to Ted a bit earlier than usual as a result.\n\nSpeaking of Ted, sharing this save with him has been great fun. I don’t think it’s overstating it to say that without his input, I’d have stop playing a while back. If you’ve somehow missed the embedded links to his blog in these posts, here’s a more obvious one (he’s really good):\n\nhttps://tedredwood.wordpress.com/\n\nIf this is reading a bit like an au revoir, that’s intentional. I have no idea if the next blog post is two weeks away, or six months down the line, and that’s fine. Winning a Ligue 1 title was the main aim of this save, and we’ve got one :smirk:\n\nAs always, thanks for reading, stay safe, get vaccinated x\n\nHe looks great, I expect him to put pressure on Oriol Busquets straight away for a starting berth, and he looks like he could become a world-class ball-winning midfield option. I think that role will be returning to the tactical fold.\n\nReliable second choice left back, Sylla, who outperformed his attributes (and arguably Alonso too), departs after 63(10) apps, 2 goals, 25 assists, 5 sec. assists for us. Ted has signed a new 16 year old left back prospect, also called Sylla, which won’t be confusing at all.\n\nIn a move that’s bound to get us both blocked by Shrewnaldo, VDBNTO has also gone. His influence on the team was on the wane, this is Ugarte’s house now. Van den Boomen leaves after 92(32) apps, 15 goals, 20 assists, 17 sec. assists, and some sweet-ass free kicks.\n\nI feel like Ted’s been a little harsh on Mavro, perhaps because he never got to play with him. I must say, I would’ve kept him, given how great he was before the broken leg. However, there’s no doubt that an injury that severe can derail a career, and the profit turned is impressive.\n\nThe Alonso situation sucks, but I don’t think Ted can be blamed overmuch. We’ve done everything to placate him to the point where he’s “happy to stay” (Alonso, not Ted), who could’ve predicted he’d want that much money? Considering our current top earner is new boy Colin Prent, who is on €40k p/w, Alonso’s demands are outlandish, and we will now likely face a desperate rush to sell him for something in January.\n\nWe also have a bit of dressing room disquiet to contend with this season, as both Camara and Aribi are agitating for new deals. I can tell Camara is on Ted’s naughty list, as he only signed a new contract 12 months ago, and Ted doesn’t like that sort of thing. Aribi is more likely to be offered an extension, but that may come with consequences, as a large portion of the first team squad think he should pipe the fuck down…\n\nAugust to December ’24:\n\nThat sure was a lot of words about the summer changes. I could probably cover the next five months by just saying, it’s almost an exact duplication of the start of last season.\n\nBut then I’d not get to mention a Champions League “Group of Death”, which is always fun. Seriously though, Milan, Bayern AND Barcelona? Are you taking the piss?\n\nDefeat in the Trophée des champions to PSG? Check.\n\nGreat Ligue record, but lost to PSG, so still second? Check.\n\nBizarrely, this was no lucky progression, we were the better side in the first five games, although Barcelona schooled us in the final match (even before we suffered a 28th minute red card), and with Milan having a highly fortunate away goal advantage over us, we needed Bayern’s only win in game six to get us through (I think that’s how it works…).\n\nWe’ve drawn fucking Liverpool in the First Knockout Round, and seeing as they did us 8-1 on aggregate last year, I’m not optimistic. Once again I wonder if I shouldn’t be throwing CL group games to get in to the Europa League instead…\n\nNo broken leg for a key defender this time around, though there’s been an epidemic of wrist and other “lower arm” injuries, including a broken arm for Mazek in the final game before January.\n\nAlonso’s Toulouse career came to a premature end when he broke his collarbone in November. He’ll be off to Atletico in January for €22m plus 25% of the next sale, which is better money than I feared we’d get. Seeing as Ted had removed all semblance of first team ready depth from the left back department in the summer, Sarmiento was the unlikely man chosen to fill in there. He was excellent in games against difficult opponents (Bayern, Lyon, and he had a game winning, player of the match performance coming off of the bench in the first game against Barcelona), but useless against Ligue 1 rubbish. And then he succumbed to an injury of his own.\n\nDespite the injury problems, we’ve won ten in a row in Ligue 1, and have looked pretty good doing it.\n\nTactics:\n\nWe’ve been a lot more consistent with our tactical choices this season, with 4231 our undisputed primary tactic.\n\nTed Redwood:\n\nMy task for Mr From in the 2023/24 season is simple – continue closing the gap to PSG. The previous two campaigns had Toulouse 10 points behind, then 9 points. Is there anyone I can sign that will increase the quality of the side to such an extent that we can definitely take 6 points off them a season? The short answer is no. The long answer is nooo. Nevertheless, there are always transfer shenanigans when TedRedwood is involved, so I tried my best.\n\nOver the course of the campaign we made a net loss of €23m or so, which is by far our biggest over the save. There was only one real first-team player sold in the summer, with Kelvin Amian bringing in €5m as he jetted off for Nantes. Mohamed Dieng is easily my preferred player at right back, so we may as well make some coin off the old guard.\n\nThe incomings during the summer were well targeted – Tenas remains on loan for a second campaign in goal, and we replaced some of the other loanees with permanent signings. We needed a centre back to replace Gabrielsen, so I acquired Konstantinos Mavropanos (Mavro) on a free. Rabie Aribi and Grzegorz Mazek fill out the forward positions for €16m combined, and are good investments for the future, as well as winger Joao Mubenga for €900k, one that F had brought to my attention earlier in the summer. I decided that we needed to up our game in the middle of the park, so Oriol Busquets joining for €4.8m is a bit of a snip. On top of all that, there were the standard 10 or so youngsters coming in that may or may not succeed.\n\nFEO:\n\nSome great looking transfer business, I’m especially excited to see what Mazek can conjure:\n\nBoth central midfielders and both ball-playing defenders have the “stay wider” player instruction, to try and avoid being crazy narrow. It looks a bit daft, but as Ted pointed out, wide attackers are pretty decent at contributing defensively, so those red boxes didn’t worry me overly.\n\nWhat brought this on? Mainly, because when playing four at the back, we seem very susceptible to leaking goals against two strikers. Even if they’re shite. We’re not squaring off against systems like this too often, but when we are, I want to try this.\n\nThe above line-up is probably not the strongest we could have here, but one of the points of having two main formations was for them to be interchangeable, and I believe Alonso and Dieng are capable enough to thrive outside of their usual positions.\n\nTactic #3: 42DM31:\n\nOr, my old Champions League tactic.\n\nMostly, this will be reserved for trying to see games out, or for particularly stern opponents (like PSG). Quite often I’ll couple this shape with both DMs and the AMC set to man mark their opponents in the centre, which seemed to work pretty well when I tried it last year against PSG.\n\nTactic #4: 424:\n\nEveryone’s got at least one tactic for when things aren’t going well, surely? I actually have two, the first is our default shape with the lines dropped and the pressing reduced, in an effort to suck particularly defensive opponents forward before going on the attack.\n\nThe other is this attacking 424, which I kind of see as a last resort when all of my cunning plans have failed me. It turns out both Ted and I have independently developed variations on this shape. “Never mind the manoeuvres, always go at ’em!”, as Lord Reiss Nelson used to tell me last season.\n\nI don’t think it really works against “park the bus” types like Lorient and their flat back five, but I like it against slightly more ambitious opponents. Having said that, if we’re using it, something has likely gone wrong.\n\nJuly to December ’23:\n\nThe season started with PSG comfortably beating us 2-0 in the Trophée des champions, which I assume we qualified for by coming second in the Ligue, and not being des champions of jack shit.\n\nWe were presented with another tough task in the Champions League, though our performance last season had me more optimistic this time around.\n\nWhy the big pause?\n\nAs the bartender said to the bear. Mainly, it’s because I’m not really enjoying this edition of Football Manager very much. There are so many flawed features, from the minor issues, such as press conference questions referencing the wrong things, to the major problems, like stats being banjaxed. I personally detest club vision. Maybe because I expected it to be so good, and it just doesn’t work as intended (I assume, if it does, then that’s worse).\n\nMy natural cycle with Football Manager is actually not to get the game every single year. With the relatively slow way that I play, I used to like the extra time to get deep in to a save. Also, when I was younger, cash was tight, and a CM/FM every year felt like an unnecessary indulgence.\n\nThere are two types of FM release as I see it; the one with big, important changes, and the meh. It feels to me like we’ve had two successive “meh” editions now. Old (young) me would probably still be playing FM19. FM21 feels particularly buggy and frustrating. Probably the only reason I’m still playing it, is that I’m really enjoying sharing this save with Ted. Genuinely, the most enjoyable part of this save from my point of view is when Ted has it…\n\nSince picking up FM18 halfway through the FM year, in April 2018, my blogging has played a part in my decisions to buy the new games, in fact, it was never in question that I would. I’d never bought Football Manager as soon as it came out before, let alone pre-ordering the thing. Doing so in order to blog about it is not about views, hitz, or even flags for me (though I do love flags), but rather the interactions with others on similar journeys.\n\nWhat does this mean for the future? Well, in terms of this series, we’re about halfway through playing season five, so there’ll be another post for sure, but I don’t know when my desire to play will vanish again, so there’s no guarantee it won’t be the final season. When I didn’t want to play with Toulouse, I tried out starting a couple of alternative saves, but they were extremely short lived. Because the problem for me isn’t the save, it’s the game.\n\nAnd beyond? At this point I’d say it depends on FM22. If we get a big upgrade edition, I suspect I’ll be diving straight in, as I have for the last couple of years. If that doesn’t materialise though? I’m not sure. The way things are, I imagine that instead of trying out the game to prepare for a blog, I’ll instead be using the beta period reading the blogs and Slack channels of other FMers, to decide whether I’m buying the game at all. It’s entirely possible I’d go back to playing an old save on an old version, and whilst you’d probably not be as interested in reading about that, I feel like I might have more fun. And isn’t that the point?\n\nThey took us down with a 90th minute long shot, and our dream was over. Fortunately Roma beat them in the final :smirk:. No Only a bit of shame losing to them. Our performance in the Europa League was enough to earn us the “biggest overachievers” tag, but it always hurts to get so close to a big final. We remain trophyless.\n\nIt’s been a fun season, in a sick kind of a way. We’ve proven that we can mix it with the big boys, though our back-up players have been the real inspiration for me this year, Bacanin, Sylla, and Camara especially. We’ve given a whopping 40 players first team action, with plenty of Ted’s young signings, as well as some academy youngsters from our first intake, getting their first minutes.\n\nMost goals: Kean (14), Jones (11), Parrott (11), Vlahovic (9)\n\nMost key contributions: Jones (8), Bacanin, Camara, Parrott (all 6)\n\nMost assists: Ugarte (13), Bacanin (11), Jones (11), Sylla (10)\n\nMost secondary assists: Jones (6), Van den Boomen (6), Bacanin (5), Ugarte (5)\n\nManuel Ugarte has made a big step up this season, adding set piece assists and wonderful through balls to his repertoire. We may face a fight to keep him this summer, as of the end of the season, both Liverpool and Barcelona are showing an interest. With captain Gabrielsen’s contract to expire, I’d quite like Ugarte to take over leadership of the team, and perhaps give him a chance to play in a more ambitious role. We shall see what Ted decides…\n\nCorners, II:\n\nI had a whinge last time about our useless record at corners (3 goals from 82 matches). After making one change to our routines, that of removing 6’7″ goliath and ideal target Sidibé from the penalty box and sticking him back with the full backs, how have the numbers stacked up for the season?\n\nMuch better! 14 goals from 52 games this season. We’re not a dominant set piece team by any means, but at least I’ve stopped rolling my eyes every time we get a corner, it was getting medically dangerous. The main beneficiary was captain Ruben Gabrielsen, who scored his first ever goal for Toulouse, and then got another five.\n\nWhy though?\n\nThe Curious Case of Melvin Camara, II:\n\nHe ended the season with 8 goals, 6 key contributions, 5 assists and 2 secondary assists from his 1’886 minutes of football. He continues to pass the eye test. I hope Ted can find more unexpected young bargains like Melvin Camara, as our intake this year was absolutely diabolical.\n\nOverall, I’m about as satisfied as I can be with our business. Goal posts are shifting at an alarming rate, and I’ve not really had much opportunity to even start building for the future, as we’re already a few seasons ahead of where I thought we’d be. With funds so tight after an excellent season, the best I could do really was to try to replicate the previous season’s type of transfers, but to try and increase the quality by a notch. I think we’ve done that, even with the loans, and going forwards we can try to secure some more permanent, prime, rib roast talent, now that we’re bringing in European money. Over to F to show that my transfers are actually naff.\n\nFEO:\n\nI was mainly left stunned at how stingy our board were. I wasn’t expecting Ridsdale sized profligacy, but giving us less than we even made? Bastards. AdmitTedly, they came through eventually with the wonderkid left back, so I can’t whinge too much. I think for the first time, a TedRedTransferWindow hasn’t got me thinking that we’re significantly improved. I’m not pointing a finger, sometimes the right players aren’t available for the right price, and our overachievement coupled with our tight board has tied Ted’s hands somewhat.\n\nStill, I do think we’re better off in terms of depth, and that could be essential in a season where we face more fixtures than we have at any point so far. It’s not just about the incoming transfers either, with Mohamed Dieng developing nicely, arguably ready for a berth in the first eleven, and Anthony Rouault returning from a successful loan spell in Portugal to vie for a first team spot. Also, I don’t think we’re weaker either. Apart from maybe in goal, and even there, Tenas looks a good player, with potential to improve, even if he’s not a patch on Maignan (yet?).\n\nI’ve picked out Curtis Jones as my favourite of Ted’s deals:\n\nTen points is a great haul, more than double what I had hoped for. There’s a little disappointment as we were actually top going in to the final match with Chelsea, but we didn’t get near them either time. How Juventus won the group after being unable to beat us, I don’t know. I wasn’t very impressed with them, and Leverkusen turned out to be tripe.\n\nArguably, finishing third is for the best. Hopefully we can get through a knockout tie or two in the Europa League, and swell our coffers a little more.\n\nWith rotation in full effect, there are a wide range of names on the faux stats list so far:\n\nMost goals: Parrott (6), Kean (5), Koulouris (5)\n\nMost key contributions: Bacanin, Dieng, Kean (all 3)\n\nMost assists: Bacanin (4), Dieng, Jones, Sarmiento, Sylla, Ugarte (all 3)\n\nMost secondary assists: Jones (4), Van den Boomen (3), Akpa Akpro (2)\n\nCorners:\n\nUh-oh, here we go again, FEO banging on about setty p’s…I’ll keep it brief.\n\nIn season one, we scored from one corner. In season two, we scored from two corners. I can feel the eyes of mathematicians upon me. That’s 82 competitive games, 3 goals.\n\nTime to change something up. New routine? No. New set piece taker? No. I’ve made one change. The man who has been the target for the vast majority of our corners so far, has been reassigned. Sure Sidibé is big, great in the air, great off the ball and arguably the best target I’ve ever had for a corner routine…but he doesn’t score. He is now assigned to stay back with the full backs, and we’re aiming for our inferior centre backs instead.\n\nIt’s early days, and a small sample size, but we’ve played 18 competitive games this season, and have scored from four corners. Gabrielsen has three of them, and he had never previously scored. Draw your own conclusions.\n\nThe Curious Case of Melvin Camara:\n\nWith the frequency of fixtures likely to cause fitness issues, and dressing room disquiet messing with certain individuals’ form (cough…Quina…cough), we’ve needed support from unexpected figures so far. Ted actually brought in a couple more players back in mid-June, both on permanent deals from lower league French clubs. The one to make an impact was a €425k pick up from Troyes, Melvin Camara:\n\nWhilst the first gif is the one that made me sit up and take notice, whether because of chronology or the fact I’m a sucker for a woodwork strike, it’s the second that’s more important, especially in that it hasn’t been a one off.\n\nHe’s involved in crafting an attack down the right hand side, driving towards goal, and providing an assist. All things that I haven’t seen out of Quina this season. Mainly what I’ve noticed from him is woefully misplaced passes.\n\nIn the following games, he also showed the capacity to get on the end of moves, and became Toulouse’s youngest ever goalscorer in the process.\n\nAs the new year dawns, Camara has accumulated 654 minutes of first team action, and has 3 goals, 3 key contributions, 2 assists and a secondary assist to his name and has looked at home on the right flank.\n\nQuina meanwhile has played for 920 minutes, in which he’s managed a solitary assist. Which was a corner.\n\nThese numbers should be couched somewhat by the fact that Camara wasn’t registered for the Champions League, and as such, on average, he has played against “easier” opponents than Quina. Would I have tried him in the CL if I could have though? Absolutely yes.\n\nIt’s the Adriano Mari principle, and perhaps it needs reiterating. Attributes and stats for other teams (Camara had done sweet FA for Toulouse 2) don’t tell you everything. Sometimes (always?) you need to clap eyes on a player in action to make an informed decision, and hopefully this will serve as a reminder for me to give the more peripheral figures in the squad a chance.\n\nWe’re not playing all that well. So that points haul is somewhat fortunate, although ironically, we didn’t deserve to lose the one we got spanked in. It feels like we’ve been found out a bit. I don’t know if that’s the way it works, but we’re being stifled in the attack whilst playing our usual tactic. Our most impressive win came about when going to a 424 formation after going 1-0 down.\n\nFor the first time, we went with a different formation from the start at home to Monaco, and though it didn’t work as I’d hoped, it didn’t not work, and a draw is a decent result from that one.\n\nThe pre-match presser for the Auxerre game revealed to me that our home form is inferior to our away form (by quite a bit it turned out), and though some of that can be put down to the teams we’ve played in those games, I tried a more positive 433 against Auxerre, and despite the final score, we battered them, in our best performance for more than a dozen games.\n\nWe remain, miraculously, in second.\n\nIn horrible news, Mike Maignan has signed a new long term deal for Lille, so our hopes of bringing him in on a free at the season’s end have been dashed.\n\nSo once again, with January approaching, and Ted’s imminent arrival with it, I leave him a) in a great situation on paper, whilst b) starting to see the tactic unRavel. Sorry Ted.\n\nTed Redwood:\n\nExpectations can be a funny thing in Football Manager, and the prospect of them being quite high often diverts me from choosing sides who are expected to compete from the off. I thought I had changed that myself by choosing Sporting Cristal in my own save, however, it’s here in Toulouse that I feel the most pressure.\n\nUnder From’s management, the purple demons have defied their own expectations, and sit in 2nd place in Ligue Un upon my arrival. Another January, another set of fixtures for me to navigate, as well as trying to ensure that FEO has enough depth and quality for the remainder of the season.\n\nWe are overachieving, but it’s my job to ensure that this continues. My attempts to build on FEO’s success have been somewhat hampered by myself prior to my own arrival. Four of the five future transfers arrived on January 1st 2022, and only attacking midfielder Mateja Bacanin is vaguely ready for the first team squad. I had presumed the club would be working its way up the league over a few seasons, but now we are short of cash for wages and transfers, and are battling for European football next season. The solution? Fob on around €3.1m of expiring/useless talent (including top earner Wesley Said), and make room for the permanent transfer of Mike Maignan. Wait, what? He signed a new deal at LOSC?\n\nBest scour the loan market for some other scoundrel that needs some love, and give F the boost he needs to continue smashing the league, then:\n\nThere were a few matches that resulted in tweakage during February. After a brief dalliance with three CMs, I dropped one to be a DM. I changed to an advanced playmaker from the previous CMS, re-introduced the advanced forward rather than the pressing forward, and added low crosses to the team instructions. Speaking as someone who’s played a lot of 90 minute FM so far, if they haven’t recently nerfed headers, then I’m a Dutchman.\n\nSpeaking of heading, Sidibé had been given a go as the CMA, with his height (6’7″) and ability in the air, I thought he could be a danger arriving in the box. And I was correct, up to a point. He was always popping up on the end of crosses. In two separate games he had double figures for efforts on goal, the majority of which were aerial chances. When it comes to heading the ball straight at the ‘keeper, he’s arguably the world’s finest talent.\n\nIn terms of other personnel, Machado’s frequent errors, specifically giving the ball away cheaply, got on my nerves, and Moussa Diarra usurped him at left back. Dejaegere returned on the right, after Janis Antiste’s early season impact waned. He’s young, and will hopefully be a serious part of our future, especially with Dejaegere only here on loan for this season.\n\nThe only position that no-one really claimed was the CMA. Manu Koné had a couple of great games, but he also stunk it up at times. Spierings and Alegre also had moments, but without fully convincing.\n\nLosing the AMC seemed to particularly benefit Wesley Saïd on the left flank, as he was frequently cutting inside and driving into the central space. Occasionally he’d run so far he popped up on the right wing. He looked far more effective from February onwards. Koulouris thrived on through balls from deeper positions, scoring plenty with his feet.\n\nThree draws and thirteen victories later, the title was ours:\n\nBoth goals feature a quality secondary assist that I award a key contribution for. I love a pass that spreads the play, and putting the wide players clear is integral to the goals.\n\nCrosses and headers are areas I’ve found most difficult to make decisions on scoring so far. In these examples, I rate both assists as key contributions, as the crosses are near perfect (plus the movement of the wide players for that matter), but I don’t always give crosses that credit, say if I judge the movement and/or header more important to the goal. Whilst both these headers are good finishes, I don’t rate them as a KC, as the crosses have put them on a silver platter in my opinion.\n\nHopefully this makes a bit of sense. The last thing I’m trying to work out, is how to go about weighting these things to get an overall score (probably one for assists, one for goals), although I’m not totally convinced that it’s worthwhile. I’ll revisit once I have a season’s worth of numbers.\n\nWant a goal scored by this system? Got a really good goal? Confused by what the hell I’m talking about and need more examples? Send me a #GifGoal. Find me on Slack or Twitter, I’ll happily take a look. Don’t want those things? Then, errr…don’t.\n\nDay One Analysis:\n\nToulouse are considered strong favourites for an immediate return to Ligue 1, and the board expect promotion.\n\nImagine my surprise then, when the Team Report showed me that we’re not all that. The good news, we’re the finest Off The Ball outfit in the division.\n\nI don’t tend to spend a lot of time worrying about the comparisons, however, the midfield screens in particular gave me pause.\n\nToulouse:\n\nStill, there were a few reasons that Toulouse appealed, and unusually for me, it’s a selection I came up with a fair while ago (and then failed to come up with a better idea). They’re recently relegated, wear purple, and they play in the fourth biggest city in the country, yet don’t win anything of note (other than a solitary Coupe de France, way back in 1957).\n\nThe country is probably the biggest draw for me. I’ve not played in France for a long old time. It should, theoretically at least, provide a harder challenge than some of my previous saves, but I’ve said that before. They did have a takeover in July this year, so I’ve no idea what to expect from the board.\n\nI’m not going to make any promises about this being a one club odyssey or anything. I do enjoy a building project, but it’s started to feel a bit repetitive. So, I’ll play it by ear.\n\nFEO:\n\nSo what’s different for me this year? Well, inspired by playing in a couple of FM20 succession saves over on FMSlack, the highly enjoyable Black Crow blog series (first blog post linked) from CJ feat. Mike, and [redacted], I’ve decided to share this save with another.\n\nThe Black Crow series has a whole lot more going on than is my intention here, but for the purposes of this save, I’ll be having my very own human Director of Football.\n\nWhy? I really enjoy the match experience, the player development, and tweaking tactics in FM, but I’m a little weary of scouting, contracts and transfers. It’s all begun to feel a little samey, and I want a break. I also like the idea of having to adapt my style of play based on the decisions of someone else.\n\nAdditionally, I thought it might be interesting for the blog to feature the thoughts of two players, to see our different ways of playing, and whether a unified approach emerges, or we have a constant tug-of-war on our hands. Either way could provide an entertaining read!\n\nI won’t be giving any instructions. The transfer business both in and out will be totally in the hands of the DoF. I’ll be in charge of the team, but the team is whatever I’m given. I’ll be completely hands-off between seasons, and in all likelihood, will be giving the save up for the January transfer window(s) too.\n\nSo over to my new boss, Ted Redwood. Oh yes, it’s #EssexFM, baby. Ted writes a mean blog post, is an expert in the loan market, and I’m really happy to be sharing this save with him.\n\nTed Redwood:\n\nMuch like the idea behind my involvement within this save, I have been given no information or restrictions in regards to an introduction.\n\nOver the last few editions of Football Manager I have always noted the success that FEO brings wherever he manages, and wondered what could truly test his abilities within the game.\n\nIt seems as if he reached a similar conclusion to myself when managing in a ‘lesser’ European nation during FM20, although it’s the sort of chokepoint you could force yourself through with enough gaming the AI, and of course excess time to play until you burst through.\n\nI feel like I was offered the chance to take over as some kind of rogue Director of Football for FEO after he witnessed my ability to shift Mesut Ozil during a brief Arsenal succession save held within FM Slack.\n\nHe’ll be delighted to hear that I’ll be attempting to be as financially prudent as always, however with the added caveat that I’m aware of how good he is at the game, so he’ll probably be showered with players with no real style in mind, and will rue the day he sees how many players are on loan at any given time.\n\nWhat’s Next?:\n\nWell said, Ted (I wrote this part beforehand, so that’s a total guess). I’m really looking forward to which players he dumps on my doorstep stylishly unveils in future, and I’m so pleased to have his words feature this year.\n\nI’ll be playing a beta save again this year, firstly to have a no consequence try of the game, but also to spend a little time working out how we will start in France.\n\nSimilarly to this choice, I won’t be basing my beta selection on an interesting club, but this time on a player, and a specific skill. More next time (once I’ve actually decided…).\n\nThanks for reading, stay safe x"
