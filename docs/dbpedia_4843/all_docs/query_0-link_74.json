This collection illustrates the best of what edited volumes can do: create a diverse, informed, and compelling conversation about a specific yet complex topic. Dr. Hauke Dorsch, AMA African Music Archives, Johannes Gutenberg Universität Mainz\n\nUte Röschenthaler is Professor at the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; Scientific Collaborator in the Cluster of Excellence ‘The Formation of Normative Orders’ and the project ‘Africa’s Asian Options’ (AFRASO) at Goethe University, Frankfurt.

These cultural expressions are increasingly regulated by intellectual property rights, as orally transmitted stories are written down, traditional songs broadcast and ownership claimed, and sporting activities once part of village life become national media events. This volume brings together an interdisciplinary team of legal experts, anthropologists and literary scholars to explore, from an African point of view, what happens to intangible cultural goods when they are confronted with large-scale commodification and distribution through media technologies, and globalized and divergent judicial systems, institutions and cultural norms. These transformations are observed in contexts that range from Senegalese wrestling contests to beauty pageants in Mali, from Kenyan hip-hop to the Nigerian novel, from the vuvuzela horn to Cameroonian masks. Contributors address the role of the state and the legacy of the European origination of IP laws, as well as the forms of ownership, technologies of mediation and degrees of commercialization that existed pre-colonially in different African societies. Resisting a single narrative of the imposition of a Western legal regime displacing older African modes, a more complex picture is revealed of the intricate interconnections between pirates, artists, communities, governments and international organizations. It is only when local actors embrace technologies and regulations in a specific historical situation that these become influential forces for change. The question raised is not whether international IP norms conform to African practices, nor whether media impose Western styles, but rather what local actors do with these regulations and how both local and Western practices and technologies impact on each other and co-exist. Intellectual property (IP) has become central to global governance but we have little idea of how this international legislation plays out on the ground. This pioneering book shows how local actors use IP rather than the other way around. A must-read for anyone interested in intellectual property.

It grew out of the research project ‘Norms and Media in Africa’ carried out by Mamadou Diawara and Ute Röschenthaler. The project was affiliated with Research Area 2 ‘Historicity of Normative Orders’ in the Cluster of Excellence ‘The Formation of Normative Orders’ at the Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany, funded by the German Research Council (first period 2007–12). In this framework we organized two conferences in the Forschungskolleg Humanwissenschaften (Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities) in Bad Homburg, with international junior and senior scholars from different disciplines. The first of these conferences, in December 2010, served to elaborate the topic and the second, in June 2011, to present and discuss the individual chapters of this volume. The principal question which motivated us to engage in this project was: why has the application of norms and rights to immaterial cultural goods gained so much importance, especially since the 1990s? In different African countries, we observed how the international discourse on global rights and norms has become increasingly influential over the past couple of decades. Mamadou Diawara, who has been working on the recycling of tradition in Mali since the 1970s, noted mounting concern about the loss of effect of spoken words and music as ever more modern artists began to stage ‘tradition’ on the global music scene. Similarly, Ute Röschenthaler, who in the 1980s began to study the development of local rights in cult and dance associations in south-west Cameroon and south-east Nigeria from pre-colonial times until the present, noted that the conceptions of the ownership of immaterial goods have in the past couple of decades diversified, and are no longer imagined to belong to clans and later cult associations only, but increasingly also to entire ethnic groups and single artists. Scholarly work that discusses the impacts of globalization largely focuses on the repercussions in local cultural contexts of Western-induced financial flows, diffusion of commodities, technologies and habits of consumption and the reception of these in different local cultural contexts. We felt that this discussion would greatly benefit from a study that explores what happens, from a local African point of view, to immaterial cultural goods when they are confronted with large-scale commodification, globalized mediatization and divergent judicial systems, institutions and cultural norms. We want to encourage the taking of a closer look at the intersections of these globalized norms, technologies and products with local normative standards and concepts of rights which have their own history. In addition\n\nvi\n\nMamadou Diawara and Ute Röschenthaler\n\nto this, we stress the importance of studying the practices of the actors on the ground. To understand, for example, what copyright is about and how it is discussed in Africa, we must keep in mind that it has become a global phenomenon which emerged in the specific historical context of one part of Europe, from where it developed into different ‘traditions’, following its origin. Thus, rights to creations should also be conceptualized as cultural constructions with specific purposes and local characteristics which, according to the circumstances, privilege one or the other aspect of these constructions, be it the rights of a single ‘author’, purely commercial considerations or the ‘common good’. The same applies to other normative standards in the domain of immaterial culture, such as literary genres or aesthetic concepts. The Cluster of Excellence ‘The Formation of Normative Orders’ provided us with the opportunity to consolidate the results of individually conducted studies by bringing together an international and interdisciplinary team of anthropologists, jurists and literary scholars for a fruitful exchange on the topic. This broad-based intellectual interchange enabled us to overcome the dichotomies oral/literary, ideation/materialization and improvisation/fixation (of performance). It also enabled us to comprehend the complexity of cultural expressions as mediated representations – in performance, songs, music, books, and tapes – in addition to the normative frameworks of ownership rights connected with their use. We are grateful to the many individuals and institutions that helped us to realize this project. The Cluster of Excellence and the Centre for Interdisciplinary African Studies, both at the Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany, have contributed substantially to what we consider the success of this undertaking. They have financially underwritten the two conferences as well as the editing of the book. Special thanks are due to Andreas Fahrmeir, the Speaker of Research Area 2 of the Cluster of Excellence, for his moral support, to Peter Siller, who facilitated the unrolling of the project as its Scientific Manager, and to Stefan Schmid, Director of the Centre for Interdisciplinary African Studies. Thanks are also due to the Anthropology Department (Institut für Ethnologie) at the Goethe University for its support in the organization of the conferences. We wish to extend particular gratitude to Ingrid Rudolph, the Director of the Forschungskolleg Humanwissenschaften in Bad Homburg, which hosted our conferences, and to her entire team for their warm welcome and the congenial atmosphere essential to the success of any symposium. We also wish to acknowledge the efforts made by the authors to get themselves together to participate in this inspiring project, many of whom travelled twice to Bad Homburg, most often quite far from their homes, for the purpose. We are very fortunate to have had the expertise and moral support of Karin Barber and Alexander Peukert at both conferences. Their presence,\n\nPreface and acknowledgements\n\nvii\n\nas well as that of Elisabeth Mudimbe-Boyi, was invaluable for the realization of the undertaking. Two participants, Rosemary Coombe and Monika Bruss, have not contributed directly to this volume, but unstintingly offered their input. Veit Erlmann joined us at a later stage. We also wish to acknowledge the important stimuli we owe to our participation at the conference ‘Tuning in to African Cities’ at the Centre of West African Studies at Birmingham in 2010, and to the other audiences to which we presented the topic at lecture series and anthropology conferences in Europe and North America. We also greatly benefitted from conversations with many more scholars who readily discussed the topic with us but who are too numerous to list here. Finally, we thank our students Kathleen Witt and Tom Simmert for their untiring help in organizing both conferences and in welcoming the participants. Tom Simmert also efficiently assisted in the editing of the volume. We are particularly grateful to our late copy editor Elliot Klein for his outstanding efforts not only to edit the English language but also to translate long passages from German and French and, after all, to make the text readable and put the finishing touches to the July 2012 draft of the manuscript.

With the increase of knowledge about Africa’s cultural heritage came a growing unease about how to treat and consider these forms of cultural expression and artistic production. The question of its ownership and use have become to an ever greater extent the object of legal regulations and commercial interests which go hand in hand with its global distribution through the media. Joost Smiers (1999) quite accurately observes that everywhere in the world all domains of cultural life – music, literature, performance, video, sports – and all expressions of lifestyle, and the human body itself, have been affected by these processes. Many scholars are disconcerted that it is no longer just in consumer societies, but even in the furthest reaches of the planet that all cultural expressions are now increasingly regulated by intellectual property (IP) rights (Coombe 1998; Cowan 2001 et al. 2006). Also, IP has moved from its formerly exclusive location within legal discourse into much wider public prominence (Hirsch and Strathern 2004:3). Jean and John Comaroff attribute this to the prevalence of the neoliberal order (2000, 2009; see also Coombe 2003), which appears to favour the appropriation and control of artistic products by big companies that earn a fortune from the rights to immaterial property (Benthall 1999; Smiers 1999). Thomas and Nyamnjoh (2007:14) wonder whether increasing privatization is the inevitable fate of a connected world.\n\n2\n\nUte Röschenthaler and Mamadou Diawara\n\nThese trends can in any case be clearly read as indicators of swiftly changing ‘normative orders’ (for more on this concept see Forst and Günther 2011). Scholars have also noted that the intensified attempts at control have provoked civil disobedience, spurred local creativity into circumventing the rules (Roitman 2005) and produced hotly contested illicit trade and piracy. Ravi Sundaram suggests that both tendencies are intrinsically connected, inseparable companions: piracy is the twin sibling of the increasing control of IP rights. Extensive endeavours to make the (Indian) city more transparent and safe have only contributed to rendering it more opaque (2010:175–6). This is also true for Africa. As Mbembe and Roitman (1995) note, promises and dreams of modernity develop their own underground lives in the (African) city. Which side to take is, however, far from self-evident. Do the deprived artists, whose art is their only way to survive, require more support, or do the laws intended to help them only hinder them and constrict the production of art forms (Anon. 2005)? Should we sympathize with the small pirates who question these laws, arguing that they deprive the public of access to ‘common goods’ (see also Goldhaber 2000; Raustiala and Sprigman 2006)? Is the real battle even between artists and pirates, or does that rather serve to distract us from the underlying reality that governments in need of taxes or other significant income support the exploitative monopolies of big companies at the expense of the creators of artworks and the local owners of cultural expressions? Arriving at such an uncomplimentary interpretation, Philip (2005) interrogates the intricate complexities of this economy and Chang (2004) points to the increasing impossibility of distinguishing originals from fakes in global (Asian) markets. Many scholars, including those from Africa, call for more protection and better implementation of IP laws (Brush and Stabisky 1996; Dutfield 1999; Globerman 1988; Hewitt 2007; Mills 1996; Ouma 2006; Strathern et al. 1998), with good arguments to acknowledge tradition-based art as the heritage and property of the community of its creators or of an ethnic group. Other scholars are worried by the intensified enforcement of rights and advocate the copyleft movements1 that propose free access to immaterial goods and creations so that all can profit and benefit from innovation, provided it remains free (Anon. 2005; Benthall 1999; Guillebaud, Stoichita and Mallet 2010; McLeod 2005; Rowlands 2004; Vaidhyanathan 2001).2 Others criticize 1\n\n2\n\nThe copyleft movement is a growing alliance of artists, authors, activists and legal theorists who are building an alternative to the current restrictive regime of IP controls. Guillebaud, Stoichita and Mallet (2010) dedicate an entire issue of Gradhiva to the topic, entitled La musique n’a pas d’auteur: ethnographies du copyright.\n\nAfrican intellectual worlds in the making\n\n3\n\nthe IP norm as a Western notion that does not coincide with African cultural conceptions (Boateng 2011; Geyer 2010; for Asia: Lehmann 2006; Yung 2009; and more generally: Strathern 2006). This criticism can also be found in many African contributions to the topic, although their dominant focus is to censure their own malfunctioning state institutions. These reflections raise basic questions about how to treat and regulate immaterial goods. Who should have access to them, who should be permitted to make what use of which specialized knowledge, who should be considered their author, discoverer or owner, and who should have the right to profit from their sale? The responses to such questions also differ at the local level. Many local actors have a growing sense of competition and crisis linked to the loss of free access to, and control over, immaterial goods, whereas others see such perplexities themselves as an opportunity to create a new self-consciousness and recognition of their culture (see for example, Comaroff and Comaroff 2009; Geschiere 2009). These developments also encourage entrepreneurial activities, be they legal, illicit or illegal. Two basic tendencies can be observed. On the one hand, individual local actors appropriate cultural expressions in their locally practised forms, then transform them and amplify them with new elements, declare the results to be their own creations and market them as their intellectual property. On the other hand, ethnic groups proclaim certain cultural forms of expression and local knowledge as their cultural heritage, to be intrinsically linked only to their group from now on, often essentialized and declared to be an ancient legacy from their own earliest ancestors. Endeavours to implement the new IP legislation are promoted by non-governmental organizations and the global art market. Thus both local and international actors contribute to the emergence of new ‘invented traditions’ (Ranger 1983, 1993).3 The global distribution of IP norms also represents what Appadurai (1996) calls an ‘ideoscape’ (Goodale 2009:2–3). Yet, we still do not know enough about these intricate interconnections in Africa. We need to know more about what transpires, from a local perspective, among pirates, artists, governments and international organizations. What happens to the art forms, the music, performance, inventions, oral literature, local beauty ideals and sports activities when they become media products, confronted with international norms and regulations, and practices of 3\n\nRanger’s primary intention, when he wrote The Invention of Tradition (1983), was to the draw attention to the distortion of local history by colonial officials in order to make it coincide with their own construction of African culture as one which existed within narrowly defined ethnic boundaries and without a noteworthy history.\n\n4\n\nUte Röschenthaler and Mamadou Diawara\n\nsanctioning them? How are oral art forms and ritual performances transformed when they are fixed on paper or on modern sound carriers and video media, which then become commodities, when sport is converted into a commercial event and bodies are increasingly mediatized and normatized? Little is still known of the complexity of local norms and rights to intangible goods, and what happens to these local regulations when international IP rights are introduced. Are they simply replaced by Western norms and regulations, or do both continue existing side by side, and, if so, what are the consequences of their co-existence? In whose interests are the copyright laws applied? Under what circumstances do they inspire people to create new cultural productions and market them globally, or rather invent strategies to circumvent the laws? To what extent do they determine the outcome of art? Whose norms are they? Were art forms, cultural expressions and knowledge already owned before they became subject to copyright law, and, if so, were the owners an entire ethnic group, a community, a family or an individual? How do cultural expressions become the property of individuals and collectivities? How is the immaterial staged in Africa, which rights and norms are disputed and which new styles and performances are emerging as a result? In this book we intend to explore these questions to gain a better understanding of the processes involved, from a local point of view, when immaterial cultural goods face globalization and technological innovation. We want to know more about the transformation of cultural expressions when confronted with international regulations and processes of commodification and mediatization. The understanding of these transformations – one of the most challenging questions in this book – also requires knowledge of the forms of ownership, technologies of mediation and degrees of commercialization that existed pre-colonially in different African societies. The contributors to this volume all focus on one or the other aspect of these transformations. They investigate in which way local and international norms have, at a specific time and in a particular place, encouraged the transformation of orally transmitted stories and plots, ritualized speeches, praise poetry, music, performance, sports or other corporeal practices. They explore what happens to them when they are fixed and turned into written documents, when they are commercialized and broadcast in the media or become subject to legal regulations such as the IP rights regime.4 We argue that these transformations result not only from the introduction of legal regulations by the so-called West, nor always from that of technologies such as the printing press and electronic media. The process is more complex. The 4\n\nThe book deals with legal regulations such as authors’ rights and copyrights, but not with patents, brands or trade secrets, which could easily fill another book.\n\nAfrican intellectual worlds in the making\n\n5\n\nlocal regulations, media and forms of commerce in these goods have to be understood before we can grasp their confrontation with varying Western legacies of immaterial property regulations. Most important, it is only when the local actors begin to embrace them in a specific historical situation that these technologies and regulations become influential forces for change and provoke various transformations, including the development of piracy. The question is thus less whether international IP norms conform to African practices or whether media impose a Western style, but rather what local actors do with these regulations and how they appropriate, implement and make use of them, and how both local and Western practices and technologies have an impact on each other.\n\nIn the realm of copyright and piracy: impacts of law, technology, media and market\n\nProperty has been described ‘not as a thing but a relationship’ (Murphy 1980), and rights to property define this relationship between people with respect to certain things (see, for example, Hann 1998; May 2000; C. Rose 1994; M. Rose 1993; and in the African context Chanock 1985; Lentz 2006). This perception also applies to intangible property, but its immateriality further complicates the definition of rights in terms of relationships between people. These rights can be passed on, but what is subject to the rights can be kept and given away at the same time (Röschenthaler 2011a; see also Weiner 1992). Rights to intangible property can be acquired and sold, but immateriality encourages clandestinity, as it is far more difficult in respect to immaterial than to material goods to define exactly what one has a right to, how this intangible product came into being, and consequently, how ownership can be secured and imitation and the production of copies prevented. Any researcher interested in immaterial cultural goods in sub-Saharan Africa will quickly realize that the subject has been relatively little studied, quite contrary to the case of material goods, especially art objects.5 Working on intangible goods requires one to take a detour through the laws that treat 5\n\nFor works – just to name a few important ones – focusing on the material aspects of African art and performance, see, for example: Arnoldi 1995; Boone 1986; Fardon 2007; Fischer 1984; Kramer 1993; Ranger 1975; Strother 1998; for textile patterns: Arnoldi, Geary and Hardin 1996; Asmah 2008; Boateng 2011; Picton 1995; Rovine 2001. Other monographs focus more on immaterial cultural goods and expressions, and some also discuss claims to ownership. For example, see for music, Charry 2000; Dorsch 2006; Erlmann 1991; Goodman 2005; Hoffmann 2000; Ntarangwi 2009; Schulz 2001; Stewart 2000; White 2008; for oratory: Barber 2007; Diawara 1990, 2003; Fabian 1990; Finnegan 2007; Furniss 2004; for cultural heritage: De Jong 2009; De Jong and Rowlands 2007; Probst 2011.\n\n6\n\nUte Röschenthaler and Mamadou Diawara\n\nauthors’ rights and which serve as the matrix of the principles governing the management of all intellectual property, including immaterial goods, especially music, dance and rituals, and their public performance. The present situation can be understood only from a diachronic perspective. The laws which have spread through the world originated in Europe, and have become innate to the West. We will examine this history, for at least two reasons: first, to see the diverse ways in which intellectual property can be protected and in which profit can be derived from it; second, to take note of the rifts deriving from the practices enshrined in IP law that divided, and still continue to divide, the very same people who have globally imposed this judicial system on other countries. We also have to take a critical look at the object under study and the terms and concepts used to describe and shape it. The jurist, for example, expresses himself in legal terms with respect to a ‘work’ (œuvre) (see Peukert in this volume). It is necessary to locate these terms in the contexts in which they were developed before entering into arguments about them with respect to sub-Saharan Africa. Against this background, we can see the particular path they took in Africa and contextualize the property rights in force there. Most works on IP begin their account with the invention of the printing press. There is agreement that in one way or another it was print technology that enabled large-scale copying and necessitated copyright as an attempt to ‘control the flow of knowledge’ (Altbach 1986:1643). Print technologies also inspired ideas of ownership, authorship and the right to make copies. The printing press as a mechanical means of producing an unlimited number of copies was invented by Johannes Gutenberg in Germany around 1445, but it took at least 250 more years until the first substantial regulation of the production of copies was established with the Statute of Anne in 1709 (in Britain), which addressed what was at the time a state monopoly, implemented by the British Stationers’ Company (Briggs and Burke 2001; Johns 1998). It would take over a century more for regulations concerning music to be included, in 1842 (Goehr 1989; Toynbee 2006). In the epoch in which printing and multiplying a manuscript required the granting of a privilege, the state proceeded to codify the ownership authors could claim to their work. From now on, they would have the right to take part in a market flourishing from its ever-increasing self-liberalization (Edelman 2004:201–5). This transition was effectuated in England in the eighteenth century, in France following the revolution of 1789, in Germany in the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth centuries, and in the USA after independence in 1776 (Löhr 2010:37, 41). In Europe, the institutionalization of cultural goods was a matter treated at a national level. At the time, bilateral agreements regulated the relations\n\nAfrican intellectual worlds in the making\n\n7\n\nbetween states. Lazar (1971:5) succinctly summarizes the basic principle in these terms: ‘We shall treat you as you treat us.’ That was the rule, including among the various German Principalities in the period preceding unification (1832–7). The situation in Italy was analogous in the 1840s, before its own unification. The goal was to avoid, by means of inter-state treaty, the illegal reproduction of works produced in the north by the southern regions of both Germany and Italy (Löhr 2010:41, 43–4). We can already see the extent to which the territories were divided by their coverage by the law. In 1858 the first literary congress was held, in Brussels, in which authors and publishers broached the issue of the inadequate protection accorded to authors’ rights. This was the initiation of a series of meetings, culminating in 1886 with the signature of the Berne Convention, which regulated the protection of artistic and literary properties in a world opening to a market until then completely unknown. The nations constituted a union to sign this Convention. Lazar (1971:5) correctly observes the transition from the principle of reciprocity to one of ‘national treatment’. The number of signatories to this accord grew from nine to fourteen at the end of the century. When the First World War dawned, they were seventeen. The members in 1914 included Great Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, Spain and Switzerland. They had the clear objectives of assuring their dominance of the market, guaranteeing the revenues of their actors in the trade in cultural goods and imposing the recognition of their rights, with all derivatives and appurtenances (Löhr 2010:73, 75). The Berne Convention gives, however, a false impression of the unanimity of the states that fostered it, masking, at this level, the very strong and real interests which separated the partners. Nor did the national delegations allow themselves to be encumbered by the customary politesses. Lobbyists intervened violently in the work groups to defend their interests (Löhr 2010:121). At the end of the nineteenth century, what Löhr (2010:19) terms ‘the global expansion of the protection of authors’ began. To graft the made-inEurope notion of authors’ rights onto the American conception of copyright turned out, however, to be complex, because of the profound difference of interests. Moreover, aside from the Convention of Montevideo signed in 1889, all the others (the Convention of Mexico of 1902, the Convention of Rio de Janeiro of 1906, the Convention of Buenos Aires of 1910) were the exclusive reserve of American states, one outcome of which was that these granted themselves the right to reproduce European works on an industrial scale. A typical example is the USA, which extended copyright only to US citizens and permanent residents. As a predictable result, American publishers authorized themselves to print British works massively, and with impunity. The USA did\n\nUte Röschenthaler and Mamadou Diawara\n\n8\n\nnot adhere to the Berne Convention until 1989 (!) (US Copyright Office 2010; see also Löhr 2010: 77, 132, 140–1); the USSR, at long last, ratified it in 1995. One of the central principles of the Berne Convention of 1886 had been to bond the colonies into the same juridical framework as their respective metropoles (Lazar 1971:4; Löhr 2010; Peukert in this volume). Thus French colonies, wherever they were, were assimilated to France, just as the British colonies were to Great Britain. This reality perpetuated itself without encountering any significant resistance until 1967, the date at which the longstanding crisis of confidence of the ex-colonies with respect to the Convention reached its culmination. On 14 July 1967 a protocol was adopted in favour of developing countries. Monsieur Tournier, General Director of the Société des Auteurs, Compositeurs et Éditeurs de Musique (SACEM),6 and the officially recognized spokesperson for the exporters of authors’ rights, emphatically refuted the point of view of India as follows: Since, as we know, the Convention of the Berne Union is entirely based on the principle of the author’s exclusive right it is to be wondered what India is doing in that Union. We should hope rather to see that country depart from the Union as soon as possible, together with all the other countries sharing views that are totally incompatible with the Instrument with which they mistakenly associate themselves.\n\n(Tournier 1967 in Lazar 1971:4; our emphases)\n\nWe now have to ask ourselves several questions essential to our enquiry. For example, considering the reluctance of some Western countries (the USA) to submit to the Berne Convention, and also such eloquent responses of defenders of the Convention to their detractors as the one just cited, what were the constraints placed on African actors in particular once the Convention had been imposed on them, after independence, and how did they react and respond to these? What was the Convention’s itinerary from the first moment that the colonial powers that had promoted it compelled their colonies to adhere to it? In addition to the relations between the post-colonial state and the metropole, we also have to take into account the often conflicting relationships between the local actors themselves. What relations develop between those local actors who enthusiastically support authors’ rights and their compatriots, who either know nothing about them or knowingly ignore them? Let us return to the divergent European notions of intellectual property. Different traditions of authorship and copyright were developed in the various 6\n\nSACEM was founded in Paris in 1850.\n\nAfrican intellectual worlds in the making\n\n9\n\nEuropean countries. British law (much later adopted by the USA) stresses the legal rights of the author and views copyright through a commercial lens: creations are to be widely disseminated to stimulate creativity for the profit of all. Frith (1988:60) critically concludes that ‘[t]he whole point of copyright is to ensure that the author of a work, its “absolute owner”, is duly rewarded for other people’s enjoyment of that work – without such rewards there would be no economic incentive to make musical or literary works in the first place’. Artistic works are created within a market system through which artists of various kinds expect to gain financially from their endeavours. Altbach (1986:1644) points out some of the ambivalences and reversals, above all that the USA, now perhaps the strongest proponent of prosecution for piracy, itself did not accept copyright until 1954, when it joined the UCC, but not yet the Berne Convention which it ratified only decades later, as earlier mentioned (for more on Anglophone copyright see Samuels 2002; Saunders 1988; Stokes 2004; Yung 2009; on music Frith 1993; Seeger 1992). In France, copyright was adopted after the revolution (1793), with the emergence of the concept of the Romantic author. The French copyright stresses the moral right of the author to control his work. This reflects a then new conceptualization of the author as a sole and ‘original creator’ of a literary and artistic work, his rights to it largely based on the labour invested. This author concept has been criticized and deconstructed by French philosophers, such as Roland Barthes (1967) and Michel Foucault (1984), as an invention, a historical, social and cultural construction by Romanticism that does not adequately represent the process by which an artist creates art, in which innumerable identifiable or unknown individuals have participated over generations. Foucault argues, even further, that since, finally, it is the readers who create the meaning of a work, they should be considered as its true authors. Elisabeth Mudimbe-Boyi (in this volume) discusses the French legacy in African literature (see also Sherman and Strowel 1994 for a critical view of the author concept). A third way of dealing with immaterial cultural goods was practised in Socialist countries. This approach prioritizes social content and accessibility over the claims of individual authors and commercial gain. According to this approach, immaterial cultural goods do not belong to any single person, but rather to the collectivity, and the state chose to manage them in the name of the community (Altbach 1986). In the course of time, more countries developed their own IP laws, all more or less variations of these three approaches. They were valid only in each respective country, until bilateral and multilateral international agreements were signed to seek mutual protection of ‘the work’ in member states. Within\n\nUte Röschenthaler and Mamadou Diawara\n\n10\n\nEurope copyright displays remarkable diversity, whereas, viewed from Africa, it is rather perceived as a uniform, universal law. Let us now take a look at what is meant by ‘a work’. Although most often taken for granted as self-evident, the concept is, nevertheless, a cultural construction. The philosopher of music Lydia Goehr (1989) provides an excellent history of the concept. She puts its usage into perspective, even in the West, its cradle. A ‘work’ is obviously intimately linked to its author. Goehr defines it as follows, pointing out that the concept dates only from the eighteenth century, and cannot be unreservedly applied to all types of music: A musical work is held to be a composer’s unique, objectified expression, a public and permanently existing artefact made up of musical elements (typically tones, dynamics, rhythms, harmonies, and timbres). A work is fixed with respect, at least, to the properties indicated in the score and it is repeatable in performances.\n\n(Goehr 1989:55; our emphases)\n\nThough the concept emerged in the eighteenth century, it is, however, the outcome of a long process set in motion in the sixteenth century. In other words, it took two-hundred years to be adopted in the West. Goehr pertinently insists that this concept of ‘work’ has long neglected, and even excluded, folk and popular music. To underscore this, she invokes and advocates the relevant criticism addressed to the topic by Czerniawski, the translator of Ingarden (1986), who was a resolute elitist and defender of this concept of ‘the work’ (Goehr 1989:63). Goehr is quite rightly adamant about the problems posed by the concept, as soon as one considers even avant-garde music, and cites the abundant bibliography on the subject. Likewise, she demonstrates the relativity of the notion by referring to well-known European musical genres such as flamenco. Goehr (1989:65 n.5) dwells at some length on a specific concert given by the famous flamenco guitarist Carlos Montoya, noting that it ended in an artificial way. Indeed, at a given moment in his show, the artist simply stopped playing. The audience applauded. But then the artist continued his concert by improvising, in his manner, various melodies from his own repertoire. Where, then, is ‘the work’ in all this? We will ask this same question as it applies to artists in African countries. Their music is far more exotic than flamenco with respect to the Western canon. The problem becomes ever more urgent to resolve when copyright, drawing in particular on Berne, crams the artists and authors into this format, which defines ‘author’ in individualistic and exclusive terms. Both ‘author’ and ‘work’ remain elusive concepts, deceptively simple ‘trick questions’. Moreover, it is the function\n\nAfrican intellectual worlds in the making\n\n11\n\nof ‘writing’ that makes an author. But how should we think of this when considering the African artists? What is most often either overlooked or deliberately masked is that prior to the development of the printing press and, subsequently copyright, concepts for the regulation of ownership and copying existed almost everywhere. For example, in south-west Nigeria only certain families have the privilege of performing certain genres of songs (Barber 2003, 2007), or, in Mali, of reciting history and praise in public (Diawara 2011). In south-west Cameroon such privileges were already alienable in pre-colonial times, so rights in the ownership and performance of cultural institutions could be acquired, and transfers were accompanied by regulations to protect the acquired immaterial good from illegitimate appropriation (Röschenthaler 2011a). Most of the contributions in this volume refer to the existence of such earlier regulations in African societies. Local regulations also existed early on in Europe, defining what people were allowed to do with valuable immaterial goods and to what extent and in what ways they could make use of knowledge and skills as resources. These regulations were, however, not (yet) implemented centrally by a state, but rather determined and defended on a local level alone (Long 1991; Somers 1996). Wherever such regulations of the use of valuable goods existed, we also encounter plagiarism (Theisohn 2009) and piracy (Jones 1994). Walter Benjamin (1970) discusses the similarities and differences between handcopying of texts and paintings and their mechanical reproduction. Handcopying of books was a normal practice in the Middle Ages before the invention of print, whereas copies of artworks were considered fakes. The early regulations appear to have been at least as well able to cope with the complexity of local practices as the state-controlled laws accompanied by a series of definition problems, in particular how to protect works which build on those of prior generations, which they complete, vary, reconstruct, reconfigure and mix in multiple ways, making it impossible to distinguish between identifiable and perceptible constituents (see Anon. for Jazz; Mose in this volume for rap; and in the areas of speech and language, Goldhaber 2000; Pennycook 1996; Scollon 1995). These artistic practices entail borrowing, quoting and modification, and also move among different genres, media and formats, a phenomenon which has been variously described as intertextuality, intermediality and remediation (McLeod and Kuenzli 2011). Musical genres such as jazz and rap, the very basis of which is improvisation, inevitably come into conflict with copyright regulations that prevent musicians from improvising on other artists’ music, but which is unable to protect the artistic achievements of improvisation until these are, somehow, ‘fixed,’ and so in this way impede artistic freedom (Anon. 2005). Similar multi-layered complexity\n\n12\n\nUte Röschenthaler and Mamadou Diawara\n\noccurs in oral literary practices the very art of which may consist precisely in the citation, modification, blending and variation of other literary works (Barber 1999). In anthropology, it is above all Karin Barber (2003) who has pointed out that all texts are made from other texts (oral or written), and always build upon existing ideas and interpretations (see also Barber 2007; Finnegan 2007:137). Property-right jurisdiction faces immense difficulty when it has to distinguish ownership from piracy given such multifaceted interconnections and artistic creations with entangled genealogies. The way these activities are considered greatly depends on which side of the fence the decision-makers and observers are positioned. National legal regulations have been created by politicians in reaction to the diversity of practices that have emerged from new possibilities of copying and selling artistic products. The establishment of these legal regulations by bureaucratic authorities appears to be an attempt to bring ‘order’ to the wild growth of artistic creativity and the multiplicity of forms it can assume. IP norms completely neglect the complex creative processes which produce artistic works in different environments and performance contexts, in which – as Karin Barber argues – the active participation of audiences plays a major role (Barber 1997). This also applies to other, only apparently straightforward artistic domains. Elizabeth Bigham (1999) states that even in the production of a portrait photograph – her example is the Malian artist Seydou Keïta – many individuals are creatively involved, including the person photographed, but only one person is considered ‘the artist’. This is further complicated when the images are acquired by a collector, who becomes their owner, as can the author of a book in which they are published, the publishing house or an image bank. In most societies, the judicial and public discourses often do not coincide with the complexity, practices and usages involved in the production and management of artistic property (Benda-Beckmann 2000; Geisler and Daneker 2000; Singer 2000:4). As we shall see, copyright issues became virulent in Africa mainly from the 1980s on, a decade which ended with a proliferation of media reforms, market liberalization and the foundation of numerous state-independent media (Bourgault 1995; Hydén and Leslie 2002). Beginning in the 1990s, the markets were also swamped with all kinds of cheap electronic and other products imported from Asia (see, for example, Sachikonye 2008). The widespread introduction of new technologies facilitated the recording of cultural expressions, their broadcast in the media, and the appearance of unlimited copies of such products on the market (Chang 2004), now affordable for large audiences and clienteles. Such media products are available as originals, but more often as pirated copies (see Tcheuyap for music and Jedlowksi for videos, in this volume; see also Larkin 2004, 2008).\n\nAfrican intellectual worlds in the making\n\n13\n\nIncreasing numbers of African authors have addressed copyright questions in recent years (Boateng 2011; Shyllon 2003; Sodipo 1997). Many also criticize the inadequate implementation of the relevant regulations or argue that African practice and copyright are intrinsically incompatible (Asmah 2008; Mills 1996; Ouma 2006; Boateng 2004, 2011 with respect to Adinkra and Kente textile design in Ghana). Others suggest that ‘rights’ serve better to exploit artists and indigenous peoples than help them (Lunsford and West 1996). The questions remain as to why piracy is proliferating and why governments are reluctant to fight it. This apparently has to do with inequalities in the world market and with particular entanglements of the political and economic sectors (Roitman 2005), but Veit Erlmann (in this volume) also shows that governments can indeed successfully fight for their citizens’ rights. There is a widespread conviction among international organizations that immaterial cultural expressions are ethnically or communally owned in African societies.7 A number of scholars and organizations argue that there was no such thing as ‘individual author’ and ‘exclusive proprietor’ previous to the introduction of these notions from the so-called West, and that it is therefore difficult, if not impossible, to adopt Western copyright and patent laws which recognize one single person as the exclusive owner of creations and inventions, in order to ‘protect’ them. Michael Brown (1998, 2003) points to the inappropriateness of the international law as a means of protecting the cultural expressions and knowledge of ethnic groups and communities from exploitative appropriations by large companies (see also Rose 2005). Scholars therefore suggest protecting immaterial cultural goods and folklore by designating them the communal property of specific ethnic groups, just as cultural heritage is attributed to ethnic groups or regions in the framework of the nation-state (Brown 2004, 2005).8 But these attempts underestimate the dynamics of ethnic groups, and overlooks their having been formed at specific times to achieve particular objectives. While, in the West, immaterial cultural expressions, inventions and knowledge become only temporarily privatized and are returned to the public domain after a certain lapse of time, cultural expressions and heritage remain the property of ethnic groups forever. However, even the ‘public domain’ is a judicialized concept which provides free access to cultural goods under certain conditions. As already mentioned, 7 Hirsch and Strathern (2004:6) also are of the opinion that stereotypes of communal and collective forms of ownership have little to do with local realities in Papua New Guinea. 8 For a discussion of the relationship of heritage to property, see Rowlands 2002; of heritage and memory in Africa, see De Jong and Rowlands 2007; and of cultural heritage generally, see Kockel and Craith 2007.\n\n14\n\nUte Röschenthaler and Mamadou Diawara\n\nthis has not always been the case, as families and specialists were endowed with privileges or acted as the custodians of knowledge (Boateng 2011; see also Hirsch and Strathern 2004 in Melanesia).\n\nCreatively coping with increasing judicialization, commercialization and mediatization\n\nThe focus of this volume is on studying the ways in which local actors participate in the transformation of Africa’s rich artistic cultural practices in their grapple with international regulations, new technologies and global networks, or, more specifically, increasing judicialization, commercialization and mediatization. These tendencies, which intensified with the reforms and liberalization of African markets and media beginning in the mid-1980s, are the subject of a growing body of literature focusing predominantly on the introduction of print and electronic media, the impact of these on societies and the roles played by their respective audiences. To grasp the full effect of the new media it is useful, however, to work with a broad approach which stresses the common ground shared by all types. William Mazarella complains that most of the literature on media overlooks that mediation itself is a crucial foundation of social life. A medium is not only a framework that both enables and channels expression, it is also a reflective and reifying technology that makes society imaginable and intelligible to itself in the form of external representations (2004:346). The most basic medium is the human voice, often amplified by performance with the body, manufactured instruments such as drums and institutions such as rituals or festivals. Electronic media have broadened the range of these preexisting practices (Diawara and Röschenthaler 2013). Media, in a wide sense of the term, are essential to all the forms of performance and cultural expression examined in this volume. Media render skills and messages visible and audible, and these messages are shaped by the medium in its materiality, its production formats and the varying actors involved, as well as by the regulations applied to them and their consumption by audiences. Performances have always been, in most societies, embedded in economic activities and exchange networks. New techniques for recording and storing performances increase their opportunities for commercialization, which brings regulation and taxation in its wake.9 When we were searching for concepts to describe the impact which copyright laws, technology, media and the market had on immaterial 9\n\nFor a recent anthropological approach to media see the contributions in the special issue of Social Anthropology (2011), edited by Patrick Eisenlohr, and entitled What Is a Medium? Theologies, Technologies and Aspirations.\n\nAfrican intellectual worlds in the making\n\n15\n\nAfrican cultural expressions, and the transformations this implied, we discovered that major incentives for this discussion arose in the 1980s, when such transformations were observed on a large scale in Asia. Of particular importance was the work of the Indian anthropologist Arjun Appadurai, who coined the phrase ‘the social life of things’ (1986, see also Kopytoff 1986). His approach was pioneering because of its actor-centred conceptualization. From then on, ‘things’ could no longer be viewed monolithically in terms of the particular function for which they had been designed. Appadurai emphasized that the purpose of things was ascribed to them by both their producers and their users, and that in the course of their ‘social lives’ their value and meanings could shift, especially while changing hands, according to the context and historical circumstances. Appadurai (1996) extended this approach to ‘things’ to the movements of people, techniques, stories, ideologies etc. in a globalized world. He did not, however, study these processes in detail in what remained a programmatic outline. Appadurai inspired numerous works, perhaps most notably a collective work edited by Van Binsbergen and Geschiere (2005) which provides detailed case studies demonstrating how we can conceive of material things in circulation in a new way, with a critical focus on the impact of commodification on local cultures. In response to the huge body of literature on the diverse impacts of globalization, anthropologists have primarily sought for defences against a possible homogenization of culture (Eriksen 2003; Featherstone 1990; Featherstone, Lash and Robertson 1995; Van Binsbergen, Van Dijk and Gewald 2004). Studying the reception of globally disseminated material goods in different local cultural contexts, they have emphasized the creativity that independent local actors have displayed in appropriating these goods according to their own ideas, needs and values. They found that objects assume, in often unexpected ways, a wide range of new meanings and uses (Probst and Spittler 2001; Spittler and Hahn 2001; Strang and Busse 2011; Ziff and Rao 1997). In this entire discussion, however, and in particular with respect to Africa, intangible cultural expressions have remained largely understudied. The debate on creativity, innovation and improvisation is related to our central concern and object of our enquiry, but has a different focus. A collection of studies edited by John Liep explores the interconnectedness of culture and creativity in a changing globalized world and its relation to the notion of entrepreneurial success (2001:1–13). It assumes that innovation and novelty are created through the recombination or transformation of existing cultural practices and forms in a way partly reminiscent of Lévi-Strauss’ concept of bricolage (Röschenthaler 2004). In their collection of essays, Creativity and Cultural Improvisation (2007), Hallam and Ingold focus on improvisation rather innovation in the creation of cultural production (2007:2). They\n\n16\n\nUte Röschenthaler and Mamadou Diawara\n\nchallenge the polarity between novelty and convention, i.e. between the dynamics of innovation and static tradition. Their approach is close to that of Edward Bruner (1993), who sees culture as constantly under construction through an ongoing process of improvisation rather than as the result of the purposeful transformation of a body of existing traditions. Jonathan Friedman (2001:48, quoted in Hallam and Ingold 2007:3) also pointed to the necessity of studying processes in a world which is always in the making (Jackson 1996:4). Close to our topic is also the collection on Melanesia edited by Hirsch and Strathern (2004; see also Aragon and Leach 2008). They also employ an interdisciplinary approach – law and anthropology – intended to open a comparative perspective on intellectual and cultural property rights in Melanesia (2004:5). The editors show that property concerns in Melanesia are shaped by motives different from those of Euro-American origin, but this regime of IP has apparently foreseen possibilities to protect artefacts, performances and repositories of wisdom that identify a ‘culture’ and make it distinct from others (2004:3). Cultural expressions have long been perceived in local contexts as important economic and symbolic resources, but the IP regime encourages the ‘creation’ of property from something culturally significant, and questions of creativity are pertinent to what is or is not transacted, creativity and innovation having become the basis of ownership claims. The issue disputed by Melanesians is not the loaning or sharing of their immaterial culture but rather the exclusive rights to its ownership and to the benefits this might confer (2004:1–2). The editors also point to a range of limitations on ownership, for example, custodians of culture may well have to be consulted before an owner can dispose of anything connected to ancestral values and therefore an integral part of the group’s identity. Concerns about maintaining the distinctiveness of their cultures have also led local actors in African societies to appropriate and naturalize their cultural expressions as something innately belonging to them alone and/or to their group’s ancestral past, and such efforts have been encouraged by the introduction of international norms and programmes (Geschiere and Nyamnjoh 2002; Röschenthaler 2011b; Rowlands 2002). This volume is interested in such on-going transformations, in cultural components constantly renewed and reshaped by different actors with different interests. We are, however, less concerned with reflecting upon concepts such as creativity, novelty, innovation, improvisation or transformation of culture as such, but rather, like Hirsch and Strathern, attempt to offset and counterbalance the international IP rhetoric. We study the confrontation of local actors with the new norms which have come to frame their everyday lives and which, precisely because they inspire creative ways to deal with them, open the way to transformations. We argue that it is individuals who\n\nAfrican intellectual worlds in the making\n\n17\n\nshape and modify elements of the culture into which they are born and live. But this should not be seen as a dichotomy between individual creativity and the conventions of society; all individuals contribute to culture, but their interests do not necessarily coincide. It is in accordance with these that they give different contours to different aspects of a culture, which can then be conceptualized as fluid and diffuse. Some strive to preserve older traditions in the name of the ancestors, others acknowledge the culture of the elders but modify it, and yet others opt to copy and multiply it, most often intending no harm but only to enable the survival of their families. A performance artist might well consider the wide illicit dissemination of his or her music as a loss, but no less justifiably as free promotion, spreading his or her fame and resulting in many new invitations to perform (see also Panzacchi 1994:201).\n\nStaging the immaterial: rights, piracy and performance in subSaharan Africa\n\nThis study has four parts and comprises fourteen chapters by scholars of law, anthropology and literature. They investigate developments in the cultural expressions of oral and written texts, music and recordings, performance and video, sport and beauty contests broadcast in the media. Some of them follow an interdisciplinary approach, combining ethnography, history, literature, law or media studies. Part 1 presents issues of IP in Africa from the viewpoint of the disciplines of law, literary studies and anthropology. The chapters in the following three parts pursue these topics in individual case studies of the local perspectives of actors in South Africa, Kenya, Cameroon, Nigeria, Mali and Senegal. All the authors demonstrate historical continuities between older and more recent cultural expressions, and describe the experiences artists have had with the new media formats and legal regulations, and how these, in turn, have left their impression on them. There are of course many other important cultural practices that are subject to transformation but could not be included in this volume. Some of them have been well studied, notably the issues involved in marketing and protection of pharmaceutical and other local knowledge (see for example, Mazonde and Thomas 2007), the identity branding and marketing of cultural expressions for tourism (Comaroff and Comaroff 2009) and the effect that nomination by UNESCO as cultural heritage has had on various cultural forms (De Jong and Rowlands 2007; for heritage and IP norms see Röschenthaler and Diawara 2011; for the commodification of heritage more generally Nic Craith 2007). Part 1, ‘Protecting immaterial cultural goods: authors, artists and the law’, deals with the history of IP rights in Africa (Peukert), questions their applicability to African literatures (Mudimbe-Boyi) and provides insight into\n\n18\n\nUte Röschenthaler and Mamadou Diawara\n\nthe complexities of musical practice and into the inequalities African artists face in the global market (Erlmann). These authors discuss the topic in its global context: how the law arrived in Africa, the criticism of the author concept from literary and philosophical perspectives, and how the copyright law has figured in precedent-setting lawsuits. It explores the problematics of attributing a creative work to a single individual as its sole author and of the inequities implicit in the global application of the copyright concept. Alexander Peukert surveys the history of IP rights and their transfer to African countries from the perspective of a jurist. He summarizes the development of the copyright and author concepts in Europe, their extension to the colonies and their continuation by post-colonial governments. He shows that these IP laws were primarily intended to protect European rights holders, not the colonized. This exclusion continues in the TRIPS agreement, which has been widely touted as a major step toward multilateral cooperation, but whose principal thrust is to regulate trade-related aspects of IP for WTO members. He emphasizes that African interests in protecting cultural expressions and heritage have not been taken into account by any of the international copyright conventions. Elisabeth Mudimbe-Boyi questions the applicability of the concept of ‘the author’ to African oral texts. Following post-structuralist philosophers who have deconstructed the author concept, she examines Francophone novelists from Senegal, Mali and the Congo, and their differing degrees of moral obligation to acknowledge the literary genealogy of their texts. Enquiring into the differences between oral and written texts, she notes that such rhetorical strategies as variations in rhythm, gestures, certain kinds of word play and repetitions are denotative techniques difficult to incorporate into a written text. She argues that writers whose work is based on existing oral literature should be termed ‘auteurs au second degré’, as they are only one link in the chain of creators in an African community. Literary work did not until recently become an issue in African copyright debates, most likely because both producing and reading books long remained the pastime of a small elite. This is quite different to the music and video sectors, which quickly reached global proportions and have spurred controversies over copyright in many African countries since the 1980s. Veit Erlmann analyses the landmark lawsuit in which the South African artist Solomon Linda (more precisely his family) won a judgment against an entity no less powerful than the entertainment industry giant Disney Enterprises Inc. Erlmann shows that much of the reasoning employed in both the litigation and the subsequent debate was couched in racial terms, as were constructions of authorship and originality which neglected the polyphonic texture of the song and many parameters of musical organization. This lawsuit\n\nAfrican intellectual worlds in the making\n\n19\n\nencouraged South Africa to find a way to become perceived as a serious player in the global IP regime, protecting both individual artistic creations and communal cultural expressions such as knowledge systems and folklore. Like Mudimbe-Boyi, Erlmann questions the concept of ‘the author’ and suggests looking at the genealogies involved in artistic production, but, going a step further, argues that musical works involve such a multiplicity of processes that none can be termed ‘originals’ (as many works on music and IP do). He even questions the distinction between original and copy, and sees ‘appropriation’ as key to the production of normative concepts of musical substance, authority and ownership. Part 2, ‘Creating norms and genres by modelling, quoting and mixing’, further elaborates the issues of authorship and of drawing dividing lines between original and copy, one work and another, by documenting the interconnections on which artistic work is based and from which genres emerge. Karin Barber examines the relationship between oral and written literature but, to the contrary of Mudimbe-Boyi, emphasizes their continuities. Newspaper journalists in the earlier phases of Yoruba-language print culture in Lagos, Nigeria, were well aware of copyright laws, but only appealed to them selectively, when their publications seemed likely to be suitable for republication as booklets. In their other writings, they did not insist on named authorship, but rather alluded to shared popular knowledge and often concealed their identities behind pseudonyms and nicknames. The owners of these early newspapers enhanced their prestige and prominence by drawing on a wide diversity of sources, much in the same way as skilful performers of oriki, the Yoruba praise poems which are based on the borrowing and sharing of textual resources. Barber demonstrates that the two options – either to claim copyright as a named author, or to participate in an anonymous print sphere characterized by extensive quotation and recycling – coexisted for many years. The choice of one or another option was controlled by the writers’ particular interests and projects. It was not simply a matter of an external legal regime that originated in Western print culture being imposed upon and displacing older African oral modes. Writers exercised aesthetic, social and economic choices about how they (re)presented their texts. Patrick Oloko examines print culture in a later stage, analysing what it takes to transform a manuscript into a publishable novel. He explores the early post-colonial period when Heinemann began, in close conjunction with Chinua Achebe, its Nigerian flagship author, to publish Nigerian novels. Achebe established the criteria according to which authors, genres, topics and approaches were selected, and by which they would be deemed publishable and likely to sell. Oloko shows that many manuscripts remained unpublished\n\n20\n\nUte Röschenthaler and Mamadou Diawara\n\nbecause they did not conform to the norms that defined, in a particular period in literary history, what a novel should be and how Nigerian literature should be presented internationally. Questions of the genealogy of texts and of the ownership of plots, canons and genres were implicit in this context too, but, in legal terms, only the designated author’s rights to a specific text were taken into overt consideration. Caroline Mose studies hip-hop in Kenya and the production of this musical genre from the multiple components which comprise it. The musicians who create the lyrics regard a song as theirs because they are the authors of its text. The musical beats which forms the integral background for their freestyle improvised oral performance are, however, assembled from bits and pieces of other chants, beats, speech and sounds from very diverse sources, creatively mixed into a hybrid known as ‘sampling’. She shows that hip-hop is a genre that by its very nature pirates or plagiarizes music from other sources, but also argues that sampling should not be seen as ‘theft’ but rather as ‘re-contextualization’. IP issues arose only when media laws obliged radios to broadcast local music, which in turn encouraged the commodification of music and the growth of the local music industry. Barber, Oloko and Mose demonstrate that it was neither the introduction of a specific technology nor the copyright law that transformed artistic practice, but rather that it was the commodification of certain formats (such as the book and the individual music album) that raised the issue of authorship. Oloko and Mose show how literary canons and musical genres are created in a specific market situation that influences and even determines how artists fashion their products. Karin Barber shows how local actors in the incipient print culture made it all but impossible to identify most writers, just as today, hip-hop musicians and producers blur the provenance of background beats, so that both sectors inherently challenge the acknowledgement of individual creators. These authors also examine, as do Mudimbe-Boyi and Erlmann, a fundamental question to which there is no single answer, namely how the artists themselves conceptualize the provenance of their products, i.e. whether they attribute them to an entire community, to a group of people in this community, to an individual, or to no one in particular, and how they believe their own work should be used by other artists. Part 3, ‘Transformations of cultural goods: imitation, appropriation and piracy’, explores how individual artists and cultural groups cope with growing mediatization, commercialization and the resulting relevance of the copyright law. It also deals with transgressions of the IP law by traders in order to satisfy consumers’ desires to gain access to artistic products.\n\nAfrican intellectual worlds in the making\n\n21\n\nUte Röschenthaler studies the transformation of performances in southwest Cameroon using the example of an artist involved in dance, music and video production. Analogously to sampling in the music sector and oral literary practices, this performance artist quotes from other performances, modifies and re-contextualizes music, songs and (masked) dances, and – despite his stated objective of ‘reviving’ these performances – he endows them with new meaning and appeal. He combines elements drawn from village performances and popular urban styles, mixing ancient, contemporary and foreign dances, and he has to deal with both local rights of ownership and international copyright legislation when he records and sells his productions. Neo Musangi traces the genealogy and evolution of the Ngqoko Cultural Group, how it first came to perform on stage, and the origins of its performances. She shows that the conceptions of rights and ownership embedded in IP regimes cannot be reconciled with local articulations, because, at the village level, songs were not regarded as ‘entertainment’, but were rather always integral to a specific ritual context in which they had power, not market value. She enquires into what happens to cultural expressions when they become cultural goods that can be marketed and sold, copyrighted, but no longer ‘embodied’, even – or especially – in the context of ‘cultural preservation’. Like other authors in this volume, Musangi concludes that local conceptions of cultural ownership and international IP regimes are largely incompatible. Mamadou Diawara explores how music has been handled in successive generations in Mali and how ideas of music, media and authorship have been modified with the introduction of electronic media, urbanization and access to new markets. Unlike singers before her, Mariam Bagayogo does not belong to a family with an established privilege of praise-singing, but rather she has learned from her masters/teachers, whom she acknowledges in her songs. The generation of musicians that followed her, however, no longer learned songs during long years of apprenticeship, but rather from listening to tapes. This practice created resentment among the praise-singers, who felt they were being deprived of their rightful profit. Just as, in a similar way, Mudimbe-Boyi studied the transition from oral to written literature, Diawara explores the passage of songs from oral performance to recorded and mediated products. Alexie Tcheuyap explores the activities of copying in the music sector in Cameroon and discusses the experiences of Cameroonian musicians with piracy. Tcheuyap’s elaborations make clear that in Cameroon, too, it was not the introduction of copyright law in colonial times, but rather the ready availability of copying technology, that created entrepreneurial opportunities for pirating recorded music. As Diawara observed in Mali, and Röschenthaler in Cameroon, musicians borrowed local performances and transformed\n\n22\n\nUte Röschenthaler and Mamadou Diawara\n\nthem into ‘new’ pieces of music, a technique which made them the individual copyright holders to cultural expressions that had been either communally owned, or the property of specific local owners. Alessandro Jedlowski studies the emergence of piracy in the Nigerian video sector, known as ‘Nollywood’ (Krings 2010; Larkin 2008), which resulted from the introduction, beginning in the 1980s, of new electronic technologies. These enabled an ever-broader population to record and copy moving images (videos), exactly what happened in smaller measure in Cameroon (and not only there) with music, as Tcheuyap describes. This video industry is characterized by low budgets, inexpensive technological equipment and informal networks of production and distribution. Piracy made Nigerian videos international ‘best-sellers’, but only by depriving the original producers of the videos of revenues which would otherwise have resulted from their investment. The low level of copyright enforcement in Nigeria, together with Nollywood’s own high degree of informality, has created a suitable environment for its popular success, but at the same time endangers the continuance of the industry itself. The contributors illuminate the genealogy of cultural expressions, and demonstrate that it is transformed media and markets which create both an awareness of individual ownership and practices of copying and piracy. Artists not previously considered individual owners of products, and who took their inspiration from a pool of artistic knowledge (Musangi) are now reaping the full rewards of music that, from the local perspective, also belongs to other artists, who – attributing their creations to the predecessors who had been their teachers – feel devalued and cheated of their rightful profits by the activities of new artists legally protected by copyright (Diawara). Others had already in pre-colonial times made cultural expressions into a marketable resource and developed ways to prevent the illegitimate copying of them (Röschenthaler). Some chapters discuss piracy from the perspective of the new artists who need to recover their investments and survive with their music (Tcheuyap) or video production (Jedlowski). Most Kenyan rappers perceive copyright as an obstacle to their creativity (Mose), whereas for some Nigerian writers it is not copyright but rather the restrictive criteria of publishing houses that stand in the way of their becoming successful book authors (Oloko). Thus, copyright provokes varying reactions and interpretations. It can be a thread of hope against global inequalities for local artists (Erlmann), or, in other cases, it obliges artists to pay royalties for whatever use they make of the music of other artists. This is the flip side of the scenario proposed by Alexie Tcheuyap, in which he insists that artists must be supported to ensure their survival and that copiers be persecuted more intensely. Part 4, ‘Marketing culture and the body: performance, competition and media impact’, looks at how cultural practices and values, such as performance\n\nAfrican intellectual worlds in the making\n\n23\n\nskills, aesthetic ideals and inventions, have been transformed and shaped by mediatized mass events in an urban context. Wane discusses male body contests, whereas Dorothea Schulz analyses female body contests. These contests impose completely different aesthetic standards on the body, but both rate the inner values and rhetorical skills of the contestants highly. These aspects are, however, of less importance in Gruber’s investigation of the World Cup, perhaps the most popular and widely mediated mass event in Africa. Dorothea Schulz`s contribution addresses beauty pageants in Mali. The aspirants to prizes are evaluated not only with respect to their physical beauty; the criteria extend to costumes, hairstyles, ‘inner beauty’ and rhetorical skills. These contests are accompanied and punctuated by various side programmes such as musical and comedy performances. The pageants, although they inspire a wide range of reactions among Malian spectators, also shape notions of beauty and womanhood. Initially, the contests served to forge national identity with a focus on the Bamana culture, largely represented by populations situated around the capital. This norm has shifted several times; presently women from the northern parts of the country correspond more closely to the beauty ideal of slim models, predominant in the Global West, a shift reinforced by the participation of Mali in trans-West Africa contests and the arrival of private sponsors, particularly those from the international beauty industry. Ibrahima Wane examines the evolution of wrestling from a competitive sport that had formed an integral part of village festivities embedded in the annual cycle, to a mass media event of national importance in Senegal. At first, wrestling was a contest of not only physical strength and prowess, but also of rhetorical skills in the invention and performance of praise songs, and all sections of society actively participated in the celebration. With the growth of urban centres in the twentieth century, however, wrestling became increasingly seen purely as a sport, and attracted media presence and commercial advertising. Popular singers now perform what had been the wrestlers’ songs, and these are broadcast in the media and considered the singers’ property. The real owners of the songs, the wrestlers of the old days, earn nothing when copyright rules are applied. Here, Wane’s observations coincide with those of Diawara, and also with Röschenthaler’s example of the artist who performs ‘traditional songs’ whose owners he praises, but who receive nothing from his sales. Matthias Gruber studies the accessories which were invented and developed in the course of the World Cup 2010 in Johannesburg, and evaluates the varying prospects for copyrighting the vuvuzela horns, the makarapa helmets and the jerseys in the colours of the local club or of the national team. They became subject to IP to differing degrees that reflect established political\n\n24\n\nUte Röschenthaler and Mamadou Diawara\n\nhierarchies. Neither the vuvuzela horns, competing claims to invention of which circulated during the World Cup, nor the makarapa helmets, which were invented by an identifiable soccer fan, could be registered as trademarks. In contrast, the jerseys of the national team, sponsored by Adidas, already were a registered trademark and, unsurprisingly, fake copies flooded the market, as originals were beyond the means of ordinary citizens. All three items gained considerable economic value during the event, and Gruber traces the reasons why coloured jerseys were legally protected whereas the horns and helmets were not. Among the examples of cultural transformation studied in this volume, beauty pageants have the fewest legal implications. Although the contests are an arena in which the body is commercialized and mediatized, each participant retains the rights to her representation in the media. Especially volatile are such major events as the wrestling contests in Senegal and the beauty pageants in Mali, where large sums change hands and which rivet the attention of the entire country or, in the case of the World Cup in South Africa, kept the entire world pinned to its screens. The interest groups which compete for profit from such major events are many, so regulations are indispensable, and yet not everything marketable calls ownership regulations into play. As Gruber’s examples show, such readily commodifiable wares as the vuvuzela and the makarapa helmet excited great interest and became the objects of debates as to how they could be protected. But finally it was the restrictive application of copyright which gained the upper hand, as Africans could not lay legal claim to their own inventions, whereas Western firms were able to protect their wares; protection which was, ironically, of complete indifference to the pirates. Erlmann also noted these same inequalities in the application of copyright in the music sector, which perpetuates the historical exclusion of African artists and inventors from the global market (Peukert). The contributions to this volume demonstrate that norms which regulate cultural expressions build upon existing practices. Some of them focus on the traceability of individual cultural elements (Diawara, Mudimbe-Boyi, Röschenthaler, Musangi), others on their amalgamation (Barber, Mose, Erlmann). They emphasize that the genealogies of their creation are implicitly or explicitly acknowledged in written texts (Mudimbe-Boyi, Oloko), in the performance of musical pieces (Diawara, Mose, Erlmann) and dance (Musangi, Röschenthaler). They pursue their social lives as commodities, as being subject to copyright law and also to piracy (Tcheuyap, Jedlowski). Piracy and plagiarism most often become subject of discussion when opinions differ as to whom profits belong to, and when loyalty conflicts arise between law and family- and friendship-based obligations to share what one owns. The massmedia events, studied by Schulz, Wane and Gruber are partly embedded in\n\nAfrican intellectual worlds in the making\n\n25\n\nthis legal framework and partly remain subject to other norms of marketing. The contributions describe how these new practices challenge established concepts of ownership and aesthetics, and situate them somewhere along the continuum that ranges from individual to family, performer-audience and collective ownership. The question, then, is not whether introduced norms such as copyright or new media formats ‘fit’ African culture, but rather what local people do with them, and to what extent they find them useful. Consequently, this book looks into how local actors – not the global standards in themselves – transform their cultural expressions. When the authors note a wide gap between African practices and global regulations, this does not necessarily mean that the global laws are inherently wrong or superfluous, but rather simply indicates their inadequacy to deal with the complexity of human creativity and regulate the practices connected with it.\n\nReferences\n\nAltbach, Philip. 1986. ‘Knowledge enigma: copyright in the Third World’.
