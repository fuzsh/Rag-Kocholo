        "text": "This book is a unique collection of analyses by experts on security sector reform in Liberia and beyond. All contributors have worked for years in Liberia and been concerned with the matter in sectors ranging from the UN Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) and Government to Civil Society and Academia. The publication thus brings together insider experiences and reflections from various perspectives. It covers a range of topics and presents a comprehensive picture of major issues in security sector reform. An introductory chapter outlines the debate and reflects on the University’s contribution to reform. The Kofi Annan Institute for Conflict Transformation (KAICT) at the University of Liberia is a nodal point in sharing, creating and disseminating knowledge on security sector reform, and the authors have engaged in joint reflection and discussion for many years. The book further analyzes developments in the core issue areas of the National Security Strategy, rebuilding of the armed forces, security sector legislation, civilian-security actor relations, reflecting on the state of reform, and progress and limits thereof.\n\nWritten by Michael J. McNerney, Stuart E. Johnson, Stephanie Pezard, David Stebbins, Renanah Miles, Angela O’Mahony, Chaoling Feng, Tim Oliver. This report assesses U.S. efforts in defense institution building (DIB) in Africa and suggests possible improvements to planning and execution. It first defines DIB and reviews some best practices from DIB and security sector reform experiences. It also highlights how DIB activities serve U.S. official strategic guidance for Africa. The report then examines how DIB is currently planned and executed in Africa and describes the range of programs that are available to U.S. planners for that purpose. It also provides a structured approach to aid in the prioritization of such programs. The report then analyzes DIB efforts in two African nations — Liberia and Libya. Finally, it examines how other institutions and countries undertake DIB by taking a closer look at the DIB activities of DoD's regional centers, as well as the relatively extensive experience of two key U.S. allies — the United Kingdom and France — in this domain.\n\nSince the 1990s, the 15 countries of the Economic Commission of West Africa States (ECOWAS) have established rule of law, functioning state institutions and relatively good governance. Furthermore, these ECOWAS countries have also experienced relatively strong rates of economic growth that is higher than the Africa average. However, in the recent past, these ECOWAS countries have also witnessed three waves of insecurity on a scale large. The continued growth of the economies of West African states and the wellbeing of their peoples will depend on the ability of these countries to address the collective and individual security challenges which they currently face. There is therefore an intimate link between security, public welfare, democracy, and development. In most post-conflict countries in West Africa, emphasis has been on violence cessation and not much is heard of the need for accountability and a democratic control of the security sector. A key theme in the seven-country case studies2 on which this policy brief is based is that in both post-conflict and democratizing countries of West Africa, democratic control of the security sector is a sine quo non for future progress; it is an issue that can no longer be safely ignored. The institutional challenges facing the security sector in each of the seven countries studies are identified. Creative innovations and strengths are also identified. Efforts by ECOWAS to set security sector norms for the whole region are reviewed, along with the challenges of turning norms into practical realities. Against this background, this brief asks the question: What can be learned from the recent experiences of these seven countries in improving the management of their security sectors? Are some of the lessons transferrable? This Policy Brief highlights some of the key lessons that West African countries can easily harvest as lowlying fruits from the recent experiences of their neighbours.\n\nIn collaboration with the ECOWAS Parliament, DCAF has developed a capacity building tool that is tailored to the needs of parliamentarians in West Africa. The project was inspired by the joint IPU-DCAF Handbook, Parliamentary Oversight of the Security Sector: Principles, Mechanisms and Practices which is now translated into over 37 languages. The ECOWAS Parliament-DCAF Guide addresses various aspects of security governance in relation to the role, powers, challenges and prospects of parliaments, such as parliamentary oversight mechanisms, defence and security budgeting, and gender mainstreaming, amongst others. It will serve as a vector for the dissemination of the principles of effective parliamentary oversight of the security sector in the West African region. The Guide is the product of contributions of various experts in the field of security sector governance, particularly from the West African region. The reliance on local experts from diverse backgrounds including contributors drawn from civil society and the media reflects broad based and grassroots engagement. As a joint publication, a draft of the Guide was examined by a Review Committee composed of members of the Political Affairs Peace and Security and Legal and Judicial Affairs Committees of the ECOWAS Parliament at two different fora in Senegal and in Cotonou in 2010. The Guide was presented to the Plenary of the ECOWAS Parliament on 29 September 2010 by the Review Committee and unanimously approved."
