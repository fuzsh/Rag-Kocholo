        "text": "METHODS\n\nData from 2 databases were linked in this study: the transmission-chain data set (1,012 cases) and the Guinean surveillance database of EVD cases. A group of 152 individuals in the transmission-chain data set were participants in the Ebola ça Suffit ring vaccination trial (10, 11). These cases were excluded from this study because of the likely impact of the trial on transmission, leaving 860 cases used in this analysis.\n\nTransmission-chain data set\n\nData on cases and the epidemiologic links between them were collected by the Ministère de la Santé et de l’Hygiène Publique of Guinea (Ministry of Health and Public Hygiene) during the epidemic. Field teams conducted interviews with cases (where possible) and their contacts, as part of epidemiologic investigations. Based on contact with confirmed or probable cases, the most likely infector or infectors were assigned to each case. The chains of transmission were continually revised and updated during the EVD response in Guinea, and when new cases were confirmed, those were added to the database and to the chains. This could result in changes to the likely infector or joining subtrees together as new information became available. The chains therefore represent the best possible epidemiologic linkage of cases to each other, made by trained field teams with access to cases, contacts, and contextual information. We restricted our analysis to confirmed and probable cases infected between September 2014 and November 2015, because transmission chains were available during this time period, and resources were available to digitize these data.\n\nVariables were age, sex, location (prefecture, subprefecture, and village), survival status of the case, whether the burial was safe or unsafe, the epidemiologically inferred source of infection, and the route of transmission (including household, nosocomial, neighbor, Ebola treatment unit (ETU)), as well as national identification number for each individual (Table ). Geographic information, demographic variables, and the probable routes of transmission were ascertained by the field epidemiology teams (Web Appendix 1, available at https://academic.oup.com/aje). Safe burial means that burial was safe, dignified, and conducted by a trained burial team. We used dates of: 1) onset, 2) admission to an ETU, 3) discharge from an ETU, 4) death, and 5) burial. We deleted 10 implausible epidemiologic links (for example, where the end of symptoms of the infection recipient was earlier than the start of symptoms of the named infection transmitter). When several infection transmitters were reported and plausible for a case, we considered only 1 link in the transmission chain by random selection. We conducted sensitivity analysis on this selection.\n\nTable 1.\n\nVariableNo. of Cases%Transmission Status (%)NoneModerateHighAge group, years 0–14 (children)13715.988.310.21.4 15–99 (adults)62172.364.127.38.7 Unknown10211.841.251.96.9Sex Male39145.569.624.36.2 Female45452.862.329.38.3 Unknown151.740.060.00EVD status Confirmed66176.972.323.44.2 Probable19923.141.741.217.1Number of reported infectors First generation of a chain13315.431.655.612.8 1 infector69080.271.022.86.2 2 infectors161.968.825.06.2 3 infectors212.585.79.54.8Route of infectiona Household transmission21775.9 Nosocomial transmission3010.5 Funeral transmission3612.6 Other transmission7426.2Outcome Survivor, ETU+23527.385.513.21.3 Nonsurvivor, ETU+, safe burial23227.071.624.63.9 Nonsurvivor, ETU−, safe burial637.357.138.14.8 Nonsurvivor, ETU−, unsafe burial708.135.740.024.3 Unknown26030.251.237.311.5Location Rural area45853.360.031.98.1 Urban area40246.771.122.66.2\n\nGuinea surveillance database\n\nThe Guinean surveillance database is a line list of confirmed cases in Guinea from the national surveillance system. Each record contains the same information on each case as the transmission-chain data set, except for the transmission link, but completeness of other fields (such as dates) is higher. Therefore, we matched the transmission-chain data set to the surveillance database using national identification number, or name, location, age, and dates of infection. This increased the completeness of the data used in this analysis.\n\nMatching cases\n\nA total 664 cases in the transmission-chain data set (77.2%) matched with a record in the surveillance database; 135 (15.7%) of these did not provide additional information on the case. We compared the features of the 529 remaining cases in each database to eliminate mismatches (Web Appendix 2, Web Figures 1 and 2) and used the surveillance database to supplement features of 380 (44.2%) cases. Among these cases, all reported variables matched for 71 individuals, and the surveillance database contributed information for 380 cases. In cases that were not perfectly matched, the mismatches were minor, and we assumed these differences were due to data-entry errors given that other variables matched (Web Appendix 2). For the other cases, we kept the features described in the transmission-chain data set. Of the 860 individuals in the transmission-chain data set, 196 could not be matched to cases in the Guinean surveillance database (22.8%). Table shows reporting and values of each variable in the final data set.\n\nClassification by number of transmissions\n\nWe calculated the number of reported secondary cases for each individual, and we categorized them as: 1) high transmitters (more than 3 cases), 2) moderate transmitters (1–3 cases), or 3) no onward transmission. We tested for associations with demographic characteristics (Web Appendix 3, Web Figure 3).\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nWe used negative binomial regression to estimate the impact of characteristics of the cases on the number of secondary cases caused (12). We grouped the age of cases into categories, in years, of 0–14, 15–34, 35–54, 55–74, and ≥75. Conakry and prefecture city centers were considered to be urban areas, and other areas (villages, towns) were defined as rural areas. Cases without a known infection transmitter were defined as the first generation of a chain and all others as subsequent generations of a chain.\n\nWe created a variable that combined the survival status, ETU attendance, and burial status of each case, called the “outcome.” In the data, all reported survivors had been admitted to an ETU, and all nonsurvivors that had been admitted to an ETU had a safe burial. Therefore we used 4 unordered levels describing the outcome of each case: 1) survivor who attended an ETU, 2) nonsurvivor who attended an ETU and was safely buried, 3) nonsurvivor who did not attend an ETU and was safely buried, 4) nonsurvivor who did not attend an ETU and was unsafely buried (Web Appendix 3, Web Figure 4).\n\nImputation of missing data\n\nFour of the variables included in the negative binomial regression analysis were incompletely reported: sex (1.7% missing), age (11.8% missing), survival status (4.5% missing), burial safety status (29.4% missing), and ETU admission status (13.6% missing) (Web Appendix 3, Web Figures 5 and 6). Because some of the variables were incomplete, and we aimed to retain the full population in the regression analysis, we used multiple imputation for missing values (13–15). In the imputation model, we considered all factors included in the regression analysis as explanatory variables (see below) as well as 4 others from the database: 3 for the number of transmissions caused (community, funeral, or nosocomial) and one for month of onset. The imputed variables were age (using predictive mean matching), survival status, burial safety status, and ETU admission status (logistic regression). We assumed that missing data were missing at random (16) (Web Appendix 4, Web Table 1, Web Figures 7 and 8). Forty data sets were generated using the MICE package in R, version 3.5.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) (17). We used pooled coefficient estimates drawn from 40 imputed data sets (Web Appendix 4, Web Table 2, Web Figure 9), and we performed sensitivity analysis on the multiple imputation (Web Appendix 5, Web Tables 3 and 4).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nUsing the largest set of epidemiologically linked transmission trees available for EVD, we identified key patient characteristics associated with increased onward transmission and estimated their association with the number of secondary cases each case generated. By doing this, we have been able to quantify the association between attending an ETU and safe burials on onward transmission in the late stage of the epidemic in Guinea.\n\nAttending an ETU was associated with a large decrease in the number of transmission events, and unsafe burial was associated with an almost 2-fold increase in number of transmissions. Our estimates emphasize the importance of ETU attendance and safe burials as control measures for Ebola, and are similar to values found in other studies (8, 18–22). These data are drawn from the late stage of the epidemic, and the same risk factors for transmission extend even late in the epidemic, when awareness of EVD transmission routes might have been higher.\n\nIn agreement with previous studies of EVD transmission, we found a highly skewed distribution of secondary cases (18, 19, 23, 24). Indeed, the majority of cases did not transmit EVD at all, and only a small number had high numbers of transmission events (25). Importantly, we were able to determine the case characteristics associated with the number of transmissions. This information could be used in real-time prediction, by incorporating information on the case mix of incident cases.\n\nOur analysis is of disjoint transmission chains, which are observations of a fully connected transmission tree. This complete tree contains the entire outbreak, with each case linked together. Our findings relating to the first generation of each chain are therefore a measure of the impact of a case not having a traced link to a prior case and not the absence of a true link to a prior case.\n\nWe found that the first generation of each chain was associated with a higher number of secondary cases than those identified later in the chain. The first generation of each chain is necessarily an individual who could not be epidemiologically linked to any prior chains by the field epidemiology teams. First-generation cases might have spent longer in the community (and therefore had a longer transmission window) because either they were not traced by contact-tracing and therefore did not know they were at risk (26) or they evaded contact-tracing (27). Alternatively, or additionally, there might be a bias toward detection of large transmission events in our data, whereby untraced contacts are more likely to be detected if they give rise to a larger cluster of cases (i.e., ascertainment bias).\n\nWe found that children and young adults had lower onward transmission, whereas infections in older adults were more likely to result in large numbers of secondary cases. Several studies have determined that children were at lower risk of infection in previous outbreaks (6, 28) and during the West African epidemic (4, 5, 29); behavioral differences in caring roles are suggested as the reason (28–30). Our study adds to evidence (31, 32) that children were also associated with lower risk of onward transmission, although not all analyses find this pattern (33).\n\nThree quarters of reported transmissions were in the household, making it the most frequent transmission route. Studies from the early stages of the epidemic found a higher contribution from funeral and nosocomial transmission routes (8) than we observed here. Our findings could be the result of public health interventions to increase safe and dignified burials, protect health-care workers, and raise awareness of transmission risks (22, 34).\n\nThere were several interventions occurring at the time of the study (11, 18). We accounted for the largest of these—the Ebola ça Suffit ring vaccination trial—by removing participants in the trial. Other interventions could have affected transmission, although we did not detect an association between time and the number of secondary cases in the model. In addition, the study period is in the latter part of the epidemic, and there might be differences in inferred transmission risk in other time periods of the epidemic.\n\nAlthough we did not find evidence for differences between cases in the transmission-chain data set and those who were not, it is possible that there are different characteristics in the number of secondary cases generated.\n\nThis study is limited to observed cases, and therefore the number of transmission events could be lower than the true value. Of note, there were no survivors who did not attend an ETU in our data. It is likely that these survivors remained undetected, and therefore we could not include transmission risk from these individuals in our analysis. Not attending an ETU could be associated with other transmission risks or with community resistance to interventions (35).\n\nMultiple imputation provides unbiased estimates under the assumption that missing data were missing at random: Given all the information available, the missing values were similar in distribution to the observed values. If, for example, all individuals with an unknown burial status in fact had an unsafe burial, then this assumption might be violated, potentially leading to bias in the estimated regression coefficients.\n\nSome of the links inferred by on-the-ground epidemiologists might be incorrect, which could affect our estimates of determinants of onward transmission. However, in contrast to other studies, which retrospectively linked cases into transmission chains (31, 36), the chains used in our study were generated in real time. Genetic data linking cases together could be used to test whether there are incorrect links (37), but these data were not available for this study.\n\nBy the end of the epidemic, the chains of transmission represented the best possible record of epidemiologic investigations of EVD cases in Guinea. During periods of high numbers of cases, the epidemiologic teams might have been more stretched and therefore surveillance effort per case could have been lower. It is possible that proposed infection transmitters have been misspecified during this time period, which could affect the findings. However, based on the characteristics of cases, we think it is unlikely that this would be a systematic error.\n\nDuring the EVD outbreak in Guinea, detailed investigations were conducted around each case reported to surveillance in order to inform the public health response. This enormous undertaking resulted in large quantities of data that provided invaluable insight into the routes and risk of transmission. Recent outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo indicate the vital importance of epidemiologically informed measures in the control of Ebola (38, 39). Analyses of these data reveal the key role that older individuals and those that did not seek treatment played in the spread of EVD."
