_______________________________________\n\nI owe a great deal of thanks, but first of all to the Department of Geography at Brunel University for funding most of this study. Their patience with my idiosyncrasies and curiosity with my work have made all that follows possible. My first, greatest debt in the department is to my supervisor Nicola Ansell. She was immensely helpful at every stage of the research pulling it apart, putting it back together, arguing over the themes and always urging me on. Secondly, I would like to thank Alan Patterson and Lorraine van Blerk, for their criticism and close reading of earlier drafts of the book. I have benefited from other colleagues and friends. Sue Buckingham has always encouraged me. I do not know where I would be without her support. Other friends from the department include Genevieve Dewez, Anna Batchelor, John Baker, Pedro Costa, Paul Szadorski and Phil Teasdale. It is still incomprehensible to me that the university in its deep stupidity has decided to close such an extraordinary department, which combined intellectual rigour with a complete commitment to its students and staff. Outside university and among my comrades and friends I am fortunate as well. David Renton, for getting me to write in the first place years ago, and telling me to do a Ph.D. and giving me the confidence that I could finish it. Peter Dwyer is another friend whose long emails, telephone calls and wisdom have helped propel me along. xiii\n\nAcknowledgements Other comrades and friends deserve my thanks. Gavin Capps, Raj Patel, John Lea, Caroline O’Reilly and Lawrence Black have all offered me immensely useful comments at different stages of this study. Hannah Zeilig and Matt Reid have helped me in various ways; the most important has been their patience in putting up with my itinerant lifestyle and flying visits. Pascal Bianchini’s friendship has been invaluable. He opened his impressive personal archive on the student movement in Senegal to me. Peter Alexander has always supported me, most recently in ensuring my continued employment in Johannesburg. But most thanks go to Rachel Cohen, who has been my most loyal and loving friend over the last ten years. I owe my mother a lot. She has been insanely generous, with the house that I sometimes squat in and her love, that I have never doubted. Her own politics – a mixture of anarchism and Leon Rosselson – have helped to shape my own. I am indebted to my stepfather Maurice who manages to be patient, kind and loving despite my extraordinary liberties. My extended life as a student – like the eternal (and faintly despised) student in The Cherry Orchard – has lasted now for an eternity and has turned me into the difficult adolescent that I never really was. My father, Ken, who died in 1990, is probably for better or worse the abiding influence on my life. Ken was a freelance broadcaster and made his precarious way in the world by interviewing people. His constant fascination with other people’s lives has infected my sister and me. I was eight years old when I was taken to my first interview with the British stunt man Eddie the Kid (who Ken interviewed on the back of Eddie’s motorcycle). The last two years have been particularly difficult for all the reasons that should have made them joyous. Nadine suffered most from my meltdown. I have seen so much of my angry father in me that I started to despair at my ability to change (a despair I never feel for political change). For what it is worth this book is for her. Still there is an element of the research that haunts me; that I xiv\n\nAcknowledgements was essentially parasitical on the hardship, pain and experiences of my interviewees. My sole objective, after all, was to unearth the experiences and history of the student movement, in doing this I would often tread clumsily on the lives of those I met and interviewed. The circumstances I found myself in and the intimacy of the interviews frequently left me feeling exhausted and useless. I could not be a friend to those interviewed, and yet I found the objectivity of the research sometimes impossible to sustain. I was constantly ‘running off’, stepping in and out of people’s lives without always realizing the consequences of doing this. Terkel has written beautifully about this dilemma (and pain) during interviews conducted for his famous collection Working: It was a Brooklyn fireman who astonished me to shame. After what I had felt was an overwhelming experience – meeting him – he invited me to stay ‘for supper. We’ll pick something up at the Italian joint on the corner’. I had unplugged my tape recorder … ‘Oh Jesus’ I remember the manner in which I mumbled. ‘I am supposed to see this hotel clerk on the other side of town.’ He said, ‘You runnin’ off like that? Here we been talkin’ all afternoon. It won’t sound nice. This guy, Studs, comes to me house, gets my life on tape, and says, ‘I gotta go’.’ … Not that it was a revelatory experience for me. Though I had up to that moment succeeded in burying it, this thief-in-thenight feeling, I knew it was there. The fireman stunned me into facing up to it. (Terkel, Working, 1975, pp. xxii-xxiii) But at least I also benefited from the close friendship of many people in Zimbabwe and Senegal. Hamidou Ba and Jean-Claude Kongo helped immeasurably during my fieldwork in Senegal. In Zimbabwe I benefited from Benson Mutape’s intimate knowledge of the University of Zimbabwe, as well as his impressive work on the institution. Most of all the International xv\n\nAcknowledgements Socialist Organization in Zimbabwe, which has taught me – among many other things – the one thing I believe absolutely (my immutable law): Struggle makes history and struggle makes us. For this I thank my friends Tafadzwa Choto, John ‘Briggs’ Bomba, Munyaradzi Gwisai and Ashley Fataar. Lastly, I owe thanks to Paul Benson and Pete Berman who shamelessly recruited me to the Socialist Workers Party when I was 17 and inspired me with their sociology classes at school (which were little more than excuses to teach us Marxism). The study is also in part dedicated to the memory of Cheikh Tidiane Fall, a 32 year old student at Université Cheikh Anta Diop in Dakar who committed suicide in April 2001. I never knew him but his despair at not being able to find work or see a real alternative in Abdoulaye Wade’s changement politique, must harden our efforts to build another world that is not dominated by neo-liberalism, austerity and under-development.\n\nxvi\n\nFOREWORD By David Seddon ______________________\n\nIn 1967–68, I was 25 years old and a graduate student in the anthropology department at the London School of Economics. It was an exciting period, with student leaders like David 1 2 Adelstein and Daniel Cohn-Bendit haranguing large crowds from the steps at the main entrance of the LSE and calling on them to fulfil their historic destiny, and various forms of ‘collective action’ – the invasions of the staff common room and restaurant stand out in my memory. But, having recently returned from South Africa, where my arrival in late 1964 had coincided with massive demonstrations in response to the introduction of the 90-day detention laws and my departure in 1967 had followed the shooting of President Vervoerd, I did not find the student protests at the LSE as ‘radical’, nor the regimes against which they struggled as oppressive, as did many who 3 took part and commented on them at the time. Nor did the economic and political situation in Britain, or even in France, where the revolts and demonstrations were on a much larger scale, and were more closely linked with workers’ strikes and other forms of industrial and street action, seem to me to be ripe for revolution. Even in the USA, where the student movement was both active and widespread, where in California, Herbert Marcuse was lauding the students as an important 4 element of the revolutionary forces, and where, memorably, state troopers fired live rounds killing protestors at Duke xvii\n\nForeword by David Seddon University, the state did not appear ready to be overthrown. Many have written in retrospect of ‘May 1968’, some with nostalgia, some with bitterness, and some with an acute critical sensibility of the limitations of the student movement. Few have set the student protests in the West in a wider global context – although Fred Halliday tried at the time to look more widely 5 than most. There is no doubt, however, that these protests and other aspects of social unrest in the late 1960s were linked to a deep political–economic malaise, affecting not only the advanced capitalist countries of ‘the West’, but also many other parts of the post-colonial world – for a time (c.1955–75) identified as a ‘Third World’ but subsequently more evidently and more deeply 6 integrated into the Western-dominated global capitalist system. Numerous commentators have analysed – from different economic, political and cultural/ideological perspectives – the deepening world crisis (and the crisis of the Third World) of the late 7 1960s and the even more turbulent decade that followed and saw the beginnings of the painful global restructuring required to restore the dynamics of profitable capital accumulation and 8 the waves of popular protest that accompanied that process. If student protest was a part of the wider political ferment of the late 1960s and early 1970s in the West, the same could be said of Africa (and elsewhere in what was still referred to then as the ‘Third World’). But whereas 1968 was, in retrospect, a ‘highpoint’ of student collective involvement in politics in the West, students have continued to play a significant, if not sometimes crucial, role in the political life of the 50 or so independent states of sub-Saharan Africa. Their role has, however, been ambivalent. Many newly independent states in Africa and Asia inherited from the colonial period a distinctively elitist approach to education – indeed many of those who became the new political elite were themselves university graduates, often having received their further education in France or England, and had a special place in their hearts for the universities and for academia. The new post-colonial regimes were initially committed to xviii\n\nForeword by David Seddon maintaining the highest standards in the universities that had already been established during the colonial period and to creating new centres of excellence, to demonstrate their bona fides with respect to investment in human resources for the future. They were less pleased, however, with the fact that, often, it was from the universities (from both faculty and students) that political opposition was fiercest. Students have always played an ambiguous role in class terms, usually coming from the more privileged sections of society and expecting to take their place among the commercial and social elites, if not among the political elite itself, and yet rebelling against authority and orthodoxy and sometimes setting themselves not only against the government or regime of the day but against the state itself and expressing radical if not revolutionary ideas about the need for social and economic change. In countries where access to education is more difficult and where, generally school-going starts at a later age, those at school and in colleges of further education should also be regarded as part of this student body. This has contributed to the wider role of students in Africa and Asia than in the West – they have tended to be a larger and more diverse body than simply the university elites. In the West it is relatively rare to find recent examples of collective action by school pupils in furtherance of wider social and political objectives – although their involvement in protests against US and British intervention in Iraq in 2003 might be considered one such example. In Africa it is more common – in South Africa, in particular, action taken by school ‘children’ has often been more significant than action by university students. The decades from the 1970s onwards have seen an increasing tendency among university students in the West to political ‘moderation’ and even quietism, paralleling the similar decline in worker activism, particularly from the early 1980s onwards, as the state and its various branches (including the educational structures) exercised a combination of authoritarianism and repression with an emphasis on individual enterprise and xix\n\nForeword by David Seddon competition. This was associated with reductions in funding for universities and a greater reliance on securing funding from nonstate (‘public’) sources. It meant for students less public funding and fewer scholarships, more investment of private (parents or own) funds and a greater concern with the university as a means to an end – successful (lucrative) employment – than as an end in itself – a place of learning and education and an opportunity to think critically and act in support of critical and rebellious ideas. These were the years of Thatcherism and Reaganomics, with their wider influence across the world, when ‘economic reform and liberalization’ were the order of the day and when neoclassical economics became the orthodoxy, even for noneconomists and particularly for university managers. If many in Britain look back on the 1960s and early 1970s as the highpoint for universities and on the 1980s and 1990s as ‘hard times’, the same is also the case for African universities for related reasons. Structural adjustment meant austerity, for public sector institutions, including universities, and for students it also meant that employment in the state sector, the expectation of many students, was less readily available. Universities were hard hit; so were students. But, unlike in the West, students continued to be politically active, providing some of the most principled and radical opposition to regimes increasingly losing their principles and their ideologies in the face of the economic and political pressures of the day. When a new wave of political protest, responding to the fundamentally undemocratic nature of so many regimes as well as to their economic and social policies – which were generally a continuation of those of the 1980s – broke across Africa and Asia in the 1990s, students were to the forefront. There is a need to understand the nature of student involvement in national politics during this period better than we do. This book is about student politics in Senegal and Zimbabwe in their historical context. It attempts to go beyond providing a detailed account of the evolving role of students in national politics in the two countries and seeks to explain what happened and why. Simplistic notions xx\n\nForeword by David Seddon of cause and effect are avoided in favour of a more nuanced analysis, setting students as a social category and student politics as a distinctive form of political action in its broader social, economic and political context. The students are seen as actors and agents in the making of their own and their country’s history, but always within the constraints of existing structures. Leo Zeilig is very familiar with the empirical contexts of Senegal and Zimbabwe, with student activism and the prevailing social structures there, having worked and studied in both countries. He is also familiar with the different ideological and theoretical approaches to student politics in Africa. His study is based on a mode of analysis that derives from Marxist political economy but is far more aware than most writing in that tradition of the social, cultural and ideological dimensions of politics; the influence of the English historian E. P. Thompson is 9 clearly visible, and indeed explicit. He is concerned primarily to ‘rescue’ students as social and political activists from relative oblivion, but in so doing also provides a counter to two dominant (and related) ‘external’ generalizations – an African history of marginalization, failed development, dysfunctional ‘patrimonial’ states, kleptocratic regimes and underdeveloped social formations and a utopian African future of development through globalization and ‘modernization’, economic liberalization, social transformation, democracy and ‘good governance’. He also, implicitly, provides a critique of the dominant ‘indigenous’ version of African under-development as a result of simple unalloyed imperialism and neo-imperialism, so often echoed by African intellectuals and politicians as an excuse for ‘the African trajectory’. The struggles of student activists are, for Zeilig, struggles within rapidly changing African social formations, both reflecting and affecting those changes; they are an integral part of the very dynamic of African development – social, economic and political – effectively contributing to the making of African contemporary history. They are also part of the wider movement of popular protest that shook the sub-continent during the 1970s xxi\n\nForeword by David Seddon and 1980s, and then again, with greater political force, in the 10 1990s. Zeilig’s strength is his commitment to investigative research in which the subjects are allowed to speak for themselves and in which crude generalizations are avoided in favour of nuanced analysis. The interplay between the experiences in the two countries concerned, Senegal and Zimbabwe, also allows for revealing comparisons. The research in Senegal on which this book is based was conducted amongst students at Cheikh Anta Diop Université in Dakar on two main occasions, the first in 2000–1 during ‘the transition’ and the second in the first half of 2004. Extensive semi-structured interviews with student activists were carried out at the university, and during the student strike in 2001 a prolonged period of participant observation was employed over the duration of the dispute. Similarly, in Zimbabwe there were two research periods: the first during the presidential election in March 2002 and the second between May and September 2003. Again interviews with student activists across the political movement were combined with in-depth research amongst members of the International Socialist Organization (ISO), a radical anti-privatization group at the centre of the protest movement from the mid-1990s that emerged from campus politics at the University of Zimbabwe (UZ) in the early 1990s. On the basis of these studies, the book explores the dynamics of student activism in Senegal and Zimbabwe in two markedly different and rapidly changing political–economic and ideological contexts and in the light of the available literature on student protest and African politics in particular. The study concludes with a consideration of the two experiences of Senegal and Zimbabwe together. The synthesis of both movements, in Zeilig’s own words, ‘demonstrates vital differences and similarities in the experience in both countries, and in the evolution of student activism in conditions of increasing poverty and underdevelopment’. It is argued that students (and indeed the intelligentsia more widely) continue to play a privileged political xxii\n\nForeword by David Seddon role on the continent, but in very different ways in very different contexts. The conclusions are intentionally preliminary and, as a consequence, demand further careful research. Let us hope that others will take up that challenge and that Zeilig himself will continue to build on this significant contribution to African studies.

In Paris it was the protests of university students outside Paris, in Nanterre, that sparked a prolonged period of political turmoil. In the United States students at Columbia University in New York launched a wave of student unrest that incorporated public and private universities across the country.1 The year 1968 became quite widely known as the year of the student. The decade had seen unprecedented numbers of student revolts. In America it was black students in southern universities that inspired the protests in northern universities and the civil rights movement.2 Book after book during the period described student power, and saw in the campus rebellions across Europe and America the ‘arrival of a new social force’.3 Students were now frequently seen as the sole revolutionary class in society, with the analysis and organizations to break the chains of an affluent society. The revolutionary student movement we were told signalled the rise of a new proletariat,4 as the old one had been hopelessly coopted by the ‘totalitarian tendencies of the one-dimensional society’ that had rendered traditional (namely working class) forms of protest ineffective.5 Despite a few honourable exceptions,6 one of the problems with the huge amount of literature that poured out of the social movements in the late 1960s and 1970s was its extraordinary Eurocentrism. The decade was also, in many ways, as important 1\n\nRevolt and protest for student activists in Africa as it was in Europe and North America. Similarly, 1968 was a crucial year for student revolutionaries on the continent. In Senegal, in events that some have claimed predated the upheavals in France, students were central to the worst political crisis the president, Léopold Senghor, had faced since independence eight years previously, forcing him to flee the capital and call in the French army to restore order after only eight years of independence.7 Students in sub-Saharan Africa had been involved in a rapid political evolution, from being a pampered elite supporting the state’s attempts to develop society they became the first group to criticize the frequent corruption (and disappointment) in postindependent Africa. They were also increasingly among the first victims. The massacres of student demonstrators – and later the execution of student leaders – in 1969 in Zaire represented both the power of student protest on the continent and the enormous risks activists would take.8 The era of cooperation with the state was over. The significance of these events for the continent and in understanding student activism generally is usually ignored or written out of most accounts of the period.9 Students on the continent, hastened by the erosion of promises of graduate employment in the 1970s, quickly evolved into hardened opponents of the independence settlement. By the 1980s, under the impact of both international recession and structural adjustment, the previously privileged conditions of students had been largely reversed. While the picture of the African university today varies across the continent, on the whole there is no doubting the severity of the situation for students. Students face an astonishingly bleak set of circumstances linked to the collapse of jobs traditionally regarded as ‘graduate work’ as employment in the formal sectors has almost completely fallen away. Today’s students face massively overcrowded classes, in underfunded facilities. The resulting environment can make learning a fairly impossible process. As one Nigerian lecturer observed: Physical clashes occasionally occur between students in different classes as lecture timetables are often not\n\n2\n\nIntroduction Map 1: Locations of Senegal and Zimbabwe\n\nobserved – students scramble to outpace their colleagues, in being the first to occupy classrooms in the desperate desire to take some hours of lectures before the examination period. The frustrations encourage some students to stay away from classes, thus leaving room for engagement in anti-social behaviour such as cultism.10 Compounding these frustrations are additional problems. Libraries, the symbols of a period of early and hopeful investment, are crumbling; they either lack any books whatsoever or 3\n\nRevolt and protest use an old and worn stock that has not been replaced since the 1970s. As a direct consequence of budget cuts, many university libraries on the continent have no access to new journals or books. The Association of African Universities (AAU) has noted the absence of core textbooks, academic journals and basic texts; in addition almost 90 per cent of universities have no computerized databases from which students and staff can access information.11 In the case of the Université de Kinshasa,12 toilets have been turned into offices: The toilets in corridors leading to auditoriums are transformed into offices and rented. … Such closing down of toilets has led to pollution of the green spaces behind the FASEC [Faculty of Economic Science] building, as it has been converted into Home 40 [student jargon for a place to relieve oneself]. … [M]aintenance workers … have assigned themselves to new posts … [making] students or other visitors pay for access to the toilets. Thus, students who cannot afford the fee make do with Home 40. The university in many parts of modern Africa is a contemporary ruin, tantalizing students with the old promise of development and transformation. Though their activism still animates political protest it too has been recast by the narrowing parameters of austerity, poverty and structural adjustment.13 African students have suffered the same poverty and austerity that has hit every section of society. Some writers even argue that they come from increasingly working-class or rural households, and have been in this respect proletarianized.14 They are often forced to repeat the same year many times – cartouchard in Senegal15 – a penalty that most students accept as inevitable. The dream of personal advancement for a social group long regarded as in transition – described as a transitory group in some of the literature16 – to a higher status is a distant prospect for most students. The student in sub-Saharan Africa is today frequently locked into a student life characterized by poverty, failure and unemployment. A bitter caricature of the eternal (and ridiculed)\n\n4\n\nIntroduction student, Pyotr Sergeyevitch Trofimov, in Chekhov’s play The Cherry Orchard.17 Students are forced to commute from extended family members, or if they are fortunate enough to live in university accommodation they must share small rooms with four or five other students.18 From the late 1970s, however, the continent was punctuated by protest, politics and resistance, from which the transitions examined in this book, would eventually emerge. It was during these years that state-led policies of development unravelled under the combined pressure of international recession and what is today fashionably termed poor governance.19 The effect of these dramatic changes was to bring about a period of global readjustment that in many parts of the African continent involved the implementation of World Bank and International Monetary Fund structural adjustment programmes (SAPs).20 The austerity measures associated with these programmes had a dramatic effect on the continent (including a sustained attack on university education). Some writers have noted how these measures brought about a (first) wave of political protest.21 Labelled bread riots, they brought together wide coalitions of mostly urban protestors.22 The second wave of protests was more explicitly political and organized than the first. Developing in the late 1980s this second wave of protests spread across many countries on the continent.23 These movements were often organized by powerful opposition parties, or newly created coalitions. University students were vital elements of these movements (see Chapter 2), which were part of a wave of democratic and popular resistance, amounting to, in Celestin Monga’s words, the ‘collective insubordination’ of Africa against structural adjustment and parasitic governments.24 The movements for change in Senegal and Zimbabwe (both organized around the slogan ‘change’) were part of this wave of protest, and student activists among the most enthusiastic advocates for political transformation. In Zimbabwe widespread opposition to the government first emerged at the University of Zimbabwe (UZ). A rising tide of political resistance and protests from 1996 culminated in the\n\n5\n\nRevolt and protest formation of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) in 1999. Afterwards there followed a period of intense crisis around parliamentary (2000) and presidential (2002) elections leading to the eventual frustration of the movement. The ability of the ruling ZANU regime to recover its momentum after 2000 led to a prolonged period of crisis and repression. Still the mass protests described by one activist as a sort of revolution saw the crucial combination of student unrest and widespread urban protests.25 In Senegal the pattern was similar, though ultimately more successful. Although protest punctuated the 1990s, it never reached the scale of the mass mobilizations in Zimbabwe. The Parti Démocratique Sénégalais (PDS), led by the charismatic Abdoulaye Wade, dominated the opposition. In the presidential elections in 2000 he managed to defeat the ruling Parti Socialiste (PS) that had governed since independence. The victory of the opposition coalition – coalition alternance – was completed in the legislative elections the following year, when the PS was reduced to a rump of ten seats in a parliament it had dominated for a generation. The role of students in registering the rural population to vote, in organizing caravans during the election campaign and galvanizing the country around the idea of sopi (change) was a vital element to the changement politique that swept Senegal. In some ways, however, the experiences of Senegal and Zimbabwe were atypical. Both experienced the political wave of change later than the rest of the continent, after a period of consolidation for those earlier movements that had already undergone political change – most notably Zambia and the experience of the Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) that had come to power after democratic elections held in 1991. What were the experiences of these movements once they turned from opposition groups into ruling parties? How did the student activists in them respond to these changes? For many years before the political transitions in Senegal and Zimbabwe students had been important elements in the struggles for democratic change. The processes involved in their activity, in the evolution of their activism and in their con-\n\n6\n\nIntroduction tribution to recent democratic transitions is the subject of this study. I examine the experience of both countries, through the period of protest and mobilization. There are several central questions for the study. How have students as a social group been transformed since independence? What role have they played in the waves of political unrest and protest since the 1980s and specifically in the political transitions in the 1990s? How can student activism in sub-Saharan Africa be understood today, and to what extent are students politically privileged actors who are able to exercise political agency? These questions will be examined in a range of contexts that have emerged from the two case studies: their ability to engage other groups in society, the level of participation in student politics, the manipulation of student politics by external forces and the presence of an independent ideology in the student movement. Three important works have emerged in recent years that directly impinge on the study. First, a collection of essays and studies by Alidou, Caffentzis and Federici26 that acknowledges African universities and student activism as crucial arenas in the struggles for democratization and political change. Second, Mark Edelman Boren’s popular history of student resistance,27 is important for another reason, it provides a vital general sketch of the history of student activism. The last is CODESRIA’s superb two-volume study of practically every aspect of the African university, edited by Paul Tiyambe Zeleza and Adebyo Olukoshi. All three studies have, of course, followed a developed discipline that has seen a body of research on both student resistance and the predicament in Africa universities. They, however, form a vital and important contemporary commentary on the role of students and the university and the peculiarities (and similarities) of student activism in Africa. But there are serious weaknesses in the research on students. Although university student activism has in recent years been the subject of important research,28 most of the studies have been descriptive rather than seriously analytical. While they give very good accounts of the role of student action across many subSaharan African universities, none provides a satisfactory\n\n7\n\nRevolt and protest explanation of the reasons for the peculiarly prominent role students continue to play in national politics, preferring to explain the micro processes of student organization or to see students simply as manipulated by cynical politicians and fighting each other on an ethnic basis.29 Mills is right to lament the lack of serious research into the recent phases of student activism: ‘Given the key role student politics has played in the post-colonial history of the African state, one would like to know more about this new phase of student activism.’30 Olukoshi and Zeleza also note the absence of research on student activism on the continent: ‘African students and staff have a long history of activism, yet the subject has not attracted as much research attention in its own right as it surely deserves.’31 Some suggest32 that with the privatization of higher education students have ceased to play their historic role and have become, instead, paralysed by the neo-liberal crisis and motivated only by a desire to ‘secure a place in a fragile post-university job market’.33 The study directly engages with this work and extends and contests some of the conclusions reached in the recent literature. The book makes a number of important contributions. First, the research brings together the work on student activism and the experience commonly (and controversially) described today as democratization. In addition, it penetrates the dynamics of student protests in two important case studies, and through the words of student activists themselves. The voices of activists are frequently drowned in the literature. Here, however, the democratic struggles in both countries are told not ‘through the carefully modulated words of politicians and intellectuals, but in the often rough, earnest cadences’ of student activists.34 And, finally, the study makes an original comparison between seemingly disparate experiences in Senegal and Zimbabwe, helping to reveal the meaning of student action across contemporary subSaharan Africa. The study was conducted among students at Université Cheikh Anta Diop (UCAD) in Dakar on two separate occasions, the first in 2000–1 during the transition and the second in the first half of 2004. Extensive semi-structured interviews with student\n\n8\n\nIntroduction activists were carried out at the university, and during the student strike in 2001 a prolonged period of participant observation was employed over the duration of the dispute. Similarly, in Zimbabwe there were two extended research periods: the first was during the presidential election in March 2002 and the second was between May and September 2003. In addition, a short trip was made to secure a number of extra interviews in August 2006. Again interviews with student activists across the political movement were combined with in-depth research among members of the International Socialist Organization (ISO), a radical anti-privatization group at the centre of the protest movement from the mid-1990s that emerged from campus politics at UZ in the early 1990s. Certain ideas in the book, and in this introduction, have been developed in other places. I edited a collection of essays on protest and resistance in Africa35 and, although they are not directly linked to the phenomenon of student action, they deal with a political and economic context that has informed much of this study. I have described the student strike in Senegal in 2001, a key moment in the evolution of activism after the election of Abdoulaye Wade,36 and this description is elaborated further in Chapter 5. Similarly, the historical background to Zimbabwe’s crisis has already appeared,37 and has helped in the development of the first part of Chapter 4. Three further journal articles have directly drawn on ideas from this research. The first is an article on the Senegalese student movement since alternance (the political transfer of power in 2000) in the French journal of African studies, Politique Africaine.38 The second article was in the Journal of Asian and African Studies and explored the evolution of student activism in Zimbabwe during the ‘frustrated transition’.39 The third article, in the Review of African Political Economy and co-written with David Seddon, deals more directly with some of the historical issues associated with the use of a Marxist epistemology in understanding protest in Africa.40 Approaching students Although the research recognizes the dangers in making general 9\n\nRevolt and protest statements about sub-Saharan Africa, the study argues for a broad – and indeed global – conception of political and economic change. Williams argues that there is a requirement for detailed and inter-disciplinary research in the study of African realities and that researchers must be aware of the danger of dissolving ‘regional specificities into comparative propositions’ that gather up disparate phenomena into a ‘generalizing basket’.41 Africa is a complex continent, divided by distinct political and economic histories. For example, South Africa is in some respects an exception to many of the political and economic changes discussed in the book. One can anticipate that a study of students in South Africa, in particular, would add a new layer of complexity to the research on sub-Saharan student activism.42 The agents of social change considered in this study are university students. But even the term student demands explanation. In this study I discuss the activism of university (and, in the case of Zimbabwe, also polytechnic) students and the literature that has attempted to understand them. This is not an accidental choice. The activism and organization of university students in subSaharan Africa is distinct in academic literature43 and in its political and social significance44 from that of other students.45 Although the study emphasizes the activism of students who participated in the two moments of democratic struggle and change in sub-Saharan Africa, it regards these individual militants and their activism as embedded in a political, economic and social world. This creates a dynamic tension between the inherited structures constantly constraining (and offering opportunities to) collective actors seeking to effect social change.46 The research makes an explicit appeal to the subjectivities of resistance but only in the context of a specific and pre-existing historical and political reality.47 As a result, the study can be seen as an historical and political consideration of how students bring about social and political change, in ‘circumstances directly encountered’.48 The lives of the students are not considered in isolation, but in the vital social and political context they encountered and sought to change.49 This vital context has long preoccupied academics who have sought to ground social change in specific\n\n10\n\nIntroduction historical and political circumstances.50 Resistance can emerge in certain counter-hegemonic spaces ‘which allow challenges to the dominant order’.51 Therefore, the concerns of the research are both macro and micro – the motivation of individual activists involved in the democratic transitions, and the broader political and economic worlds they were forced to negotiate. The methods used to uncover these experiences, and to explore this micro world, are various. Extensive use of oral testimony (principally interviews and life histories) was combined in the study with an attention to the historical and political macro world. The study is a fusion of personal experiences of the struggles that gripped Zimbabwe and Senegal and broad political and economic structures. Social change, then, is at least partly made by students and the popular resistance of which they were increasingly an important element. To some, these may seem obvious observations; however, frequently ‘only political, constitutional and administrative history is real history’.52 Thompson, in his famous study The making of the English working class, wrote that he was consciously ‘writing against the weight of prevailing orthodoxies’.53 These orthodoxies derived from various sources, one was the work of ‘the empirical economic historians in which working people are seen as a labour force, as migrants, or as the data for statistical series.’ Thompson’s quarrel with these histories is an important signpost for this research: ‘They tend to obscure the agency of working people, the degree to which they contributed by conscious efforts, to the making of history. … Only the successful … are remembered. The blind alleys, the lost causes; and the losers themselves are forgotten.’54 The tendency to exclude the ‘agency of working people’ is not limited to the Western academy (or to pre-1960 historical writing). On the contrary, the literature on African student movements is replete with these orthodoxies,55 where the crucial agents are missing from their own histories. Indignant readers find themselves yelling: ‘Where is the protagonist? Where are the students?’56 In this book I consequently take Thompson’s historical method\n\n11\n\nRevolt and protest as a marker: ‘I am seeking to redeem the poor stockinger, the Luddite cropper, the “obsolete” hand-loom weaver, the “utopian” artisan … from the enormous condescension of posterity.’57 The research is a sustained attempt not to forget the anti-privatization campaigns led by student activists in Zimbabwe and the euphoria of those who organized them, or the students who travelled day and night across Senegal before the final round of the presidential elections in 2000 to ensure that their villages and towns were mobilized to vote for the changement politique.58 These are the histories told against a frequently hostile and seemingly unbending social world. The student’s determination to bend this world came from a refusal to believe in the inevitability (or impossibility) of their encountered circumstances, and this is one of the reasons why they were such an intransigent agent of social change in Zimbabwe and Senegal. The ideological tools (organizations, initiative and leadership) that students used in the transitions were one of the ways that their agency was exercised, and they are an important focus of the study. These students who are excluded by the orthodoxies Thompson detested were responsible for making, in part, the history in these case studies. In Hill’s words, this is the ‘realization that they may have played a greater part in determining the shape of the historical process whether for change or for continuity, than we have thought.’59 Researching students I should admit to a certain opportunism, which I suspect informs all research. I was teaching in Senegal at UCAD during the historic elections in 2000, and witnessed the involvement of students (many of them I taught) first hand. This period marked the start of my research. For entirely different reasons I was in Zimbabwe in 2002. I was there helping to coordinate the Independent Media Centre during the presidential elections. Most of my contacts at the time were students from the UZ in Harare and the National University of Science and Technology (NUST) in Bulawayo. Social science research in Senegal is a relatively easy process. 12\n\nIntroduction There is a rich and developed tradition of research stretching back to independence, from Cheikh Anta Diop’s pioneering work at the Institut Fondamental d’Afrique Noire (IFAN) at the University of Dakar in the 1960s and 1970s, to the establishment of the Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa (CODESRIA). Dakar now has numerous research institutes and centres. Most of the archival research was conducted at the school of journalism at the university’s Centre d’Etudes des Sciences et Techniques de l’Information (CESTI). The library has a full newspaper archive. I conducted 30 interviews in 2001 with a combination of student activists – members of faculty amicales (departmental unions) – and ordinary students whose activity would increase and diminish with the pace of mobilization. Despite intense political competition, student activists frequently introduced me to their political foes. In the second period of research, in 2004, 28 further interviews were conducted. Although the interviews followed a semi-structured approach, their depth and length varied widely. The majority of the second set of interviews in 2004 were with leading current and exstudent activists, and these were frequently conducted in the evening and interrupted by prayers, or by camarades who would join the discussions, which often transformed them into group interviews (the fashionable focus group I suppose). Further interviews were much shorter and conducted using a notebook with students at both UCAD and at Université Gaston Berger (UGB) in Saint Louis. In contrast to Zimbabwe, the only questioning from the police or security services were enquiries about the nature of my research, which frequently prompted advice and opinions. The majority of interviews were conducted in French, although a number were carried out in English. It was impossible for me to conduct certain interviews with members of the National Youth Service (NYS) in Chegutu. I was forced to use a research assistant and native Shona speaker, at the time a student journalist on the Herald newspaper, Tawanda Kanhema. It was against a background of the politicization of race that the research was undertaken in Zimbabwe. In these conditions I\n\n13\n\nRevolt and protest constructed a substantial façade, denying the real nature of the visit on both fieldtrips and a willingness to undertake considerable risks. There are perhaps two issues here that need to be enunciated more clearly. The first is obvious: I was white in a context in which race is politicized, so clearly no façade was possible here. The second was that my research itself was contentious: I was conducting research in the highly charged political environment of the university, and among a group of political actors who had been the most vociferous in their condemnation of the regime. I had also arrived during a period when the self-confidence of the opposition had been undermined by state violence and the internal decay of the opposition itself. Although the university campus afforded me a certain freedom, I was told repeatedly that students from the ruling party – Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front (ZANU– PF) – who were paid by the state were aware of my presence at the university. What this meant was unclear, but I was advised to leave the campus for several days. I conducted interviews on a very haphazard basis, when student activists were able to find a space to see me. It was also imperative that the majority of interviews at UZ were conducted before the start of June. The date had been fixed for the final push, which involved mass mobilizations across the country, called and organized by the MDC. The potential for continuing the research beyond this date was uncertain. So the entire period of research was in one respect illegal, I was forced to enter the country on false pretences. I lied repeatedly to the authorities, neighbours and even friendly contacts about what I was doing in the country. This raises the question of the ethics of research that have been discussed in the context of global activism.60 I conducted 40 interviews in Zimbabwe with a range of activists and non-political students. Four key interviews were also undertaken in South Africa, with recent student leaders from Zimbabwe who were studying in exile in Johannesburg and Durban, and with the doyen of ex-student militants from the 1980s, then working as a banker in Johannesburg. The later part of the fieldwork involved extensive use of a newspaper archive,\n\n14\n\nIntroduction more or less hidden in the basement of the law library. This provided access to vital material that was difficult to access in the national archives without exposing myself to further questioning. For much of the historical background I made extensive use of the Herald, which was, until 1999, the only daily newspaper. The Herald has traditionally been the mouthpiece of the government and its validity as an historical source was approached critically throughout the study. The most obvious point is that the research in Zimbabwe was not conducted in ideal circumstances. Indeed, it was punctuated by arrest, surveillance and the pressure of living in a country in the midst of an economic and political crisis. Access to a number of people was impossible and certain national archives were unreachable: undoubtedly, the research would have benefited from being able to draw on these sources. However, in a certain respects, examining the activism of students in conditions that they have had to confront in the country’s polytechnics and universities gave me a rare insight into the nature of their political action. As the research was informed by Thompson’s commitment to rescue those agents of historical change forgotten by the ‘enormous condescension of posterity‘, it was important that those recorded are not just the successful (those remembered in the historical accounts) but also those voices rarely heard, much less remembered. I could have dwelt on the great successes of the student movement; those who had reached the heights of political office from the lowly ranks of student unionism. There were many of these in both case studies. I needed their experiences as well (more on this below) but I made a conscious decision early on in the research to concentrate on grass-root activists, and other students, who fell in and out of activity. This reasoning is tied directly to an attempt not to provide another vehicle for the ‘modulated words of politicians and intellectuals’,61 but to include those who do not have their answers on stand-by or have not already constructed their narrative before you walk into the room. Terkel found himself removing many of those whom he had interviewed for his study,\n\n15\n\nRevolt and protest ‘there are deliberate omissions … doctors … politicians, journalists and writers of any kind. … I felt that their articulateness and expertise offered them other forums. … I was interested in other countries not often heard from.’62 These were problematic objectives among students, particularly those active politically. These activists were used to expressing themselves and reflecting on political choices, still they were not familiar with the probing of an interviewer and in general I did not feel that their answers were ready made. The approach adopted could not exclude interviewing politicians who had been student activists. The elevation of a layer of student activists to national parliaments during the democratic transitions was a vital element in the recent history of the student movements in both countries. Still, their accounts could not be taken at face value; often I gleaned less from their modulated words than I did from activists who remained at the university. Some of these issues arose during an interview with an MP in Zimbabwe. Job Sakhala, still an MP for a poor township in Harare in 2006, is one of the most colourful ex-leaders of the student movement. After a titanic struggle to arrange an interview with him (which finally took place in his car, then in three Harare bars and finally at his constituency home), he used the opportunity to set the record straight, and gave me an incredibly detailed account of the student movement and the evolution of the opposition MDC that had, in his words, degenerated into a ‘scramble and fight for economic riches’.63 Inevitably he saw the interview as a way of responding to his critics in the party but also as an opportunity to record the extraordinary events in which he had been an actor. In both countries there were two principal gatekeepers. In Zimbabwe one was an organization, the International Socialist Organization (ISO), with which I had worked in 2002 when I was helping to coordinate the Independent Media Centre. Many of its members were students; some of them had been key activists in the recent transitions. This was a unique opportunity to have access both to the historical actors, and those current ones who maintained a very keen sense of the background and evolution\n\n16\n\nIntroduction of the movement they now led. Arriving at interviews with ISO accreditation made me immediately credible. This was still the case with interviews conducted in 2006. In Senegal it helped to have been a temporary lecturer at the Faculté des Lettres et Sciences Humaines before the main period of my fieldwork. My initial gatekeeper, a former student JeanClaude Kongo, had played a small role in the events described in the book. He put me in touch with Hamidou Bâ, who was also interviewed for the role he had played in 2000. Hamidou became my chief informant and contact. In many ways he was typical of a generation of activists. He knew how to negotiate life at the university, but was less successful with his studies. He was never without accommodation on the university (a scarce resource), having well-established connections with the university administration, the Centre des Oeuvres Universitaires de Dakar (COUD). His activism gave him a formidable contact list, and for those he did not know he had the self-confidence to convince them that he did. Hamidou revealed as much about the student movement from his behaviour as he did through the contacts with whom he was so generous. My abiding memory is of him raging in the dinner hall at the quality of the food being served, hitting his fist against the table so that our trays jumped into the air, exclaiming: ‘This food is not fit for intellectuals!’ He was symbolic in many ways of the perpetual student of my study who is no longer in transition to a prefixed social world but paralysed within the university circuit. From Hamidou I was able to make contacts of my own, which eventually led me to UGB in Saint Louis. I am acutely aware of the dangers in revealing the identities of student activists. These were questions that preoccupied me in both Senegal and Zimbabwe. In Senegal a layer of student activists has been co-opted into political parties or received bursaries for foreign studies and in a number of limited cases students have been elected to parliamentary office. In this environment accusation and counter accusation are hurled backwards and forwords by activists, making the interviews hazardous processes, and potentially dangerous for the interviewees. Students would use my research to implicate other\n\n17\n\nRevolt and protest activists in contentious events, and also, occasionally, to throw dirt at each other. This was graphically illustrated in the violent attack and hospitalization of Madiop Biteye (one of my interviewees) – the leading PDS student militant in Dakar – after a dispute among PDS partisans at the university in Dakar in 2005. The current violence of campus politics illustrates the disintegration of the student movement since the election of Wade in 2000.64 In Zimbabwe the principal source of violence against activists has come from the state, and students have been regularly targeted, arrested and tortured. During both periods of fieldwork I asked interviewees if they agreed to have their identity revealed. In many cases students would pre-empt the question by raising it themselves, insisting that their accounts were recorded and voices heard. Female students in Zimbabwe were, however, far more hesitant and I was asked on a number of occasions to ensure their anonymity. This concern stems from the particular vulnerability of female students to violence, some of it sexual, by other students and the security forces. As a consequence the book is inconsistent in the use of the students’ real names, and I have indicated where students have requested the use of a pseudonym. Summary of chapters In the first chapter I consider the development of student activism as part of the pre-colonial intelligentsia in the years immediately before independence. I go on to examine how their role as privileged actors evolved in the first two decades of independence, and the general significance and meaning of student activism. I also consider questions of protest, politics and resistance in Africa from the 1970s. It was during these years that state-led policies of development unravelled under the combined pressure of international recession and what is today fashionably termed poor governance. From the late 1970s students were forced to negotiate a world radically different from the one that they had expected to inherit. Chapter 2 comprises a survey of several bodies of literature that inform the research: one of the principal ones covers the role 18\n\nIntroduction of students, the nature of their protest and their relationships with civil society in a wave of multi-party elections and democratic struggles in sub-Saharan Africa. Here I focus specifically on the literature that relates to student activism and protest, though it is acknowledged that their activism brings into play many other factors. The context in which students become political actors in contemporary Africa is tied to the transformation of higher education in sub-Saharan Africa, often under the auspices of IMF and World Bank led reform. I also explore the changing nature of higher education in the political economy of sub-Saharan Africa. Chapter 3 is taken up with the processes of political change and student activism in Zimbabwe, and it forms the first full case study. It situates the rising tide of the student movement in two distinct spaces. The first was the contradictory experience after independence, which almost simultaneously saw both the massive expansion of higher education and at the same time a growing financial crisis that severely affected the new state from the late 1980s. Out of this contradiction emerged a vocal and militant opposition to the regime among student activists at UZ. The chapter is divided into three main parts. The first deals with the political and social history of Zimbabwe, focusing on the recent period of political resistance. The second looks at the evolution of student protest and activism through the 1970s and 1980s. The final part concentrates on the period of transition or the convergence of forces from 1995. In it I examine the dynamics of student action in the context of widening political unrest. In Chapter 4 I follow a similar structure to examine the trajectory of political and social change in Senegal. In the first part of the chapter I give a brief description of political change since independence in 1960. In the second part I detail the emergence of the student movement and chart its development from a widely perceived heyday of political vanguardism in the 1960s and 1970s to the crisis in higher education since the 1980s. In the final part I cover the recent participation of students in the changement politique since 1998; then, focusing on the role of key student activists and groups, I chart the participation of students\n\n19\n\nRevolt and protest in Wade’s coalition alternance. I describe how student activists in the years that followed were co-opted and corrupted by a regime they had laboured to elect. In Chapter 5 I explain the meaning of student protest in the light of the research, bringing the comparison between Senegal and Zimbabwe together. I also summarize the principal conclusions reached by the study. In the Conclusion I bring the research back to the role of the student intelligentsia examined in the Chapter 1, arguing that they continue to play a privileged political role on the continent but in wildly divergent movements. The ideas in the Conclusion are intentionally preliminary and as a consequence call for further careful research.\n\n20\n\nChapter 1\n\nPOLITICS, STUDENTS AND PROTEST: THE MAKING OF THE STUDENT INTELLIGENTSIA ________________________________________________\n\nIn the first years of independence, university students could be characterized as a pampered section of society being educated to run the post-colonial state. But, within a very brief period, they became oppositional, regarded in the literature of the day as ‘rival politicians rather than students’.1 Student militants frequently fuelled the early protest movements that questioned the legitimacy of the new states. Many commentators regarded them as a democratic vanguard, powered by left-wing ideology. In later years the literature despaired at their activism, regarding students in Africa as non-ideological and fighting daily struggles for government handouts.2 Between independence in 1960 and the mid-1970s university students were part of a privileged transitory social group waiting to be allotted graduate employment in an expanding civil service and across the state sector. Some described them as members of Africa’s intelligentsia or new petit bourgeoisie. The period corresponded to a brief moment of state-led development across much of the continent, with overwhelmingly well funded students living comfortably on government grants and scholarships. By the mid-1970s this picture was beginning to unravel. In tandem with the economic crisis that led to a collapse in the price 21\n\nRevolt and protest of primary commodities in the 1970s, university provision began to decline.3 Students saw the level of grants fall and their privileged conditions crumble. By the mid-1980s under the impact of SAPs, students had to a large extent been proletarianized and, according to some observers, they comprised part of the new popular classes that helped to empower many of the political protests (and democratic transitions) in the 1980s and 1990s.4 Although this study focuses on the later period of their evolution, and particularly the convergence of forces in the 1990s, student activism is only understandable when viewed historically as a transition from an early post-independent elitism. There are essentially two arguments at the centre of this chapter. The first is that students were a vital element in preindependent nationalist struggle in sub-Saharan Africa. They belonged to the intelligentsia, which included university educated graduates, civil servants working for the colonial service and trade union bureaucrats.5 They were able to play this role because of the relative organizational and political weaknesses of other social groups in society. They were also political modernizers who were going to bring development to the new states. Students were clearly politically privileged actors. They continued to play their privileged role after independence, through the early years of state-led development and, in an adjusted form, through the economic crisis in the 1970s. In the first section of this chapter I consider the development of student activism as part of the pre-colonial intelligentsia in the years preceding independence. I go on to examine how their privileged role evolved in the first two decades of independence and the general significance and meaning of student activism. The second broad theme of the study centres on protest, politics and resistance in Africa from the 1970s. It was during these years that state-led development policies unravelled under the combined pressures of international recession and what is today termed poor governance.6 The effect of these dramatic changes was to bring about a period of global readjustment, which in many parts of Africa involved implementing World Bank and International Monetary Fund SAPs. The austerity\n\n22\n\nPolitics, students and protest: the making of the student intelligentsia measures associated with these programmes had a dramatic effect on the continent (including a sustained attack on university education). Some writers have noted how these measures brought about waves of political protest.7 Labelled bread riots, the action brought together wide coalitions of mostly urban protestors. In the final section of the chapter I look at these changes, at the effect of the economic crisis in Africa from the 1970s and at the corresponding increase in popular resistance. How these changes impacted on higher education and student activism is taken up in Chapter 2. Class suicide and the intelligentsia How far can students be considered part of an intelligentsia? On this question there is a tension in the literature, for intelligentsia and student are frequently used interchangeably. Even in Cliff’s otherwise precise text8 there is a confusion between the two terms; in fact, contemporary student activists in Senegal and Zimbabwe often employ the term intellectual to describe their social role. The conflation of terms continues in a recent study on the African intellectual9 that addresses the historical role and future trajectory of intellectuals on the continent, but makes no serious conceptual distinction between the terms.10 There was a serious exploration of these questions during the student revolts in the 1960s. Flacks, for example, reflecting many of the contradictions in the literature and debates at the time, defines the intelligentsia as ‘those engaged vocationally in the production, distribution, interpretation, criticism and inculcation of cultural values’.11 This group has grown from ‘small pockets of isolated, independent intellectuals’ to become, in the course of several decades, a significant ‘stratum of the population, including many in new white collar vocations’. Although Flacks argued that New Left students aspired to become members of the intelligentsia, he argued that the expansion of the intelligentsia has been largely due to the growth of university education, ‘The newest and largest generation of this stratum was thronging the nation’s [United States] colleges.’12 The same debates took place among scholars in Africa. In a public debate on ‘The role of the 23\n\nRevolt and protest African intellectual in the African revolution’ in Uganda in 1969 with the head of the country’s intelligence service, the scholar Ali Mazrui defined an intellectual as a ‘person who has the capacity to be fascinated by ideas and has acquired the skill to handle many of them effectively’.13 It is argued that the main reason for the conflation of student and intelligentsia in much of the African literature is because students – particularly in the period immediately before and after independence – were engaged, as Flacks describes, ‘in the production, distribution, interpretation, criticism and inculcation of cultural values’.14 However, it is important to situate these arguments in the political changes that were taking place across much of sub-Saharan Africa. There are three vital and related aspects to the immediate preindependence period in much of Africa. First, contrary to many ideological and political beliefs at the time, it was not usually a working-class or trade-union leadership that led the struggles for independence. Although labour mobilizations after the war were often crucial sparks to nationalist movements, generally speaking another social group took up the leading positions in the movements that were to oust the colonial powers (see below). Second, the group that assumed responsibility for leading nationalist struggles was called the intelligentsia. It was made up largely of colonial staff, trade union bureaucrats, university students and graduates who had often been educated abroad on colonial scholarships and who had been immersed in a left-wing (frequently communist) milieu in American, British and French universities in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s.15 Third, this student intelligentsia was attracted to the Soviet model of development.16 The Soviet Union was regarded as offering the intelligentsia of the Third World the option of raising their countries to a level of technological development equal to the advanced West. This was often seen in terms of a radical project of socialist transformation, where the levers of state control could be wielded in the interests of the newly independent nation. Future leaders developed their politics in student groups.17 Two organizations stand out: the West African Student Union\n\n24\n\nPolitics, students and protest: the making of the student intelligentsia (WASU), formed in 1925 in London, was regarded as the ‘training ground for Nigerian nationalists’.18 WASU welcomed students from West Africa who found themselves in London, however briefly, often providing them with accommodation and support. However, WASU was not principally a welfare service but a political and campaigning union: it denounced colonial racism, forced labour, the expropriation of land and the unequal relationship linking the colonial metropoles with their African dependencies. Far from limiting its agenda to student issues, WASU sought to ‘agitate for and emphasize the needs of the future “United West Africa”’.19 Similar, and similarly radical, political organizations of Francophone African students were active in Paris: the Association des Etudiants Sénégalais (AES) and the Fédération des Etudiants d’Afrique Noire en France (FEANF) were seen as crucial to the emergence of students as a distinct social group.20 Marcel-Eloi Chambrier Rahandi, a former activist and leading member of FEANF, explained that the organization assured the political formation of a generation of soon to be African leaders, and crucially the union gave an ideological coherence to the disparate communities of African students studying in France.21 As Chambrier Rahandi put it: ‘one learnt to live, to think and to act together, FEANF was a school where we took our first political lessons. It was within FEANF that African students formed a concept of African nationalism. … Through the practice and theory of the union they forged an idea of freedom.’22 The list of those transformed by the metropolitan university and by their luttes syndicales in these countries testifies to the importance of the student/intelligentsia: Amilcar Cabral in Portugal, Léopold Senghor in France and Kwame Nkrumah in the USA and Britain. These students were forced, partly, to study overseas for the simple reason that there were very few universities on the continent. The reluctance of the colonial powers to build universities came out of a fear of educating the ‘native’. Olukoshi and Zeleza make clear the consequences of this fear, for ‘it was this attitude that set the stage for the historic confrontation that was to fire the nationalist movement.’23 Nobody ever\n\n25\n\nRevolt and protest underestimated the role students would play. Léopold Senghor, Senegal’s first president, addressed students in 1956, ‘you are the elite of the elite, the best elements of our people’24 and it was generally believed that the next generation from the university would continue to play a leading role in post-colonial Africa. Some of the more Eurocentric writers on student politics even suggest that the influence of Western education on a group of Africans instilled in them the desire for freedom, democracy and independence.25 However, an unintended consequence of the experience was to expose students to radical left-wing ideas, a key factor being the intellectual hegemony of Marxism in leftwing politics in European universities in the 1930s and 1940s. Along with these influences was the role black Marxists played in political struggles in the USA and Europe.26 It is clear that student militants and intellectuals achieved an intellectual and organizational hegemony that was unparalleled in colonial Africa. It is vital not to underestimate the role played by trade unions in the struggles for independence in many countries. In both Zimbabwe and Senegal it was national strikes – on the railways in 1947/8 in Senegal and the general strike in Zimbabwe in 1948 – that were key to initiating the nationalist movements.27 The 1945 general strike in Nigeria crippled the colonial machine for weeks leading to a period of labour nationalism in the late 1940s and early 1950s. In Northern Rhodesia the Zambian trade union’s official nationalist leadership agreed to an uneasy alliance, with the trade unions refusing to be completely subsumed into the Northern Rhodesian Congress.28 Several commentators have argued that, rather than the period signifying the weakness of the organized working class, it was rather the ‘lack of a visionary and strategic labour leadership’ of this class.29 Many argue that the lack of such leadership was largely due to Stalinism’s domination of the labour movements.30 Stalinistinfluenced politics insisted on broad alliances with nationalist organizations as part of the two-stage process towards socialism. The first stage was to be the democratic revolution, which included winning independence, and only afterwards would\n\n26\n\nPolitics, students and protest: the making of the student intelligentsia there be a sustained struggle for socialism, once the foundations of a national capitalism had been established. Most communist and communist-inspired students, trade unionists and intellectuals from the Third World believed they must proceed first to national independence, in broad class coalitions.31 Many had expected the working class to lead the struggle for national liberation, an argument advanced most convincingly by Trotsky.32 Trotsky’s theory of permanent revolution was predicated on the argument that the national bourgeoisie – historically responsible for the transition to liberal democracy – was incapable of carrying out these tasks. It would be too terrified that social forces would be unleashed on the very things it wanted to promote – private property, free trade and wage labour. If it had been unable to transform Russia, what chance was there in a colonial world setting that systematically enfeebled the development of an indigenous bourgeoisie?33 Often under the influence of Stalinist politics, a generation of Western Africanists spent an eternity searching (largely in vain) for the emergence of an African bourgeoisie.34 Seddon makes the essential historical point: ‘In most of Africa, the colonial state (serving the interests of metropolitan capital and, where settlers became more strongly rooted, of local settler capital) was at pains to inhibit the development of an indigenous African capitalist.’35 In marked contrast to the absence of a nascent African capitalist class, the colonial state had succeeded in creating a significant stratum of functionaries who controlled many levels. Civil servants, teachers, nurses and clerks comprised a class that Poulantzas called a new petty bourgeoisie.36 The colonial powers wished to train and ‘civilize’ a class of functionaries imbued with the superiority of Western values.37 In the period of decolonization this process was speeded up in the hope that a willing and obedient intelligentsia could be handed the reins of state power in a peaceful transition that would, largely speaking, leave the colonial structures of power intact.38 This was an inherently ambiguous (let alone risky) exercise for the colonial state, for it was from among these groups – intended to control the colonial states – that young educated radicals began to emerge. Many\n\n27\n\nRevolt and protest who were sent abroad on foreign scholarships would encounter and begin to engage in left-wing politics.39 As Seddon reminds us, it is important not to see the history of class struggle in Africa in terms of a ‘narrow definition of the working class … [but rather we] must recognize the crucial (but often problematic) role played by the radical elements of the new petty bourgeoisie.’40 Evidence of this has recently emerged in documents the Public Record Office released in March 2003 describing the emergence of radical and communist ideas in ‘negro organizations’ during the Second World War. Although the files concentrate on the consequences for the West Indian colonies, they betray the paranoia of the British secret services at the growth of a black consciousness linked to an embryonic civil rights movement in the United States. The documents stress growing radicalization among groups of West African students studying in America. In a prolonged correspondence with the Colonial Office, staff at the British embassy in Washington reported with growing anxiety the activity of West African students studying in the United States. In 1944 they were particularly concerned about two Nigerians, Nwafor Orizu and Ozumba Mbadiwe, who were to go on to play a prominent role in the radical wing of Nigerian nationalism.41 A Colonial Office letter on 3 January 1944 noted: ‘We have had a certain amount of correspondence with various Departments over the unsatisfactory position that tends to develop in the cases of many West Africans who have gone to America as students.’ Quoting another letter received the previous year on the alarming state of African students permitted to study in the United States: between 20 and 30 students from West African [sic] have been permitted to come to this country, supported by the promise of profoundly inadequate allowances from their relatives at home. A few are all right, quiet, industrious and serious; others are anything but. They get into debt; they flit from one soft-hearted university to the next, piling unfinished course upon unfinished course. Gradually they learn there is a market value attached to the pose of the\n\n28\n\nPolitics, students and protest: the making of the student intelligentsia exploited victim of British imperialism; they write books and they address meetings and they get taken up and used by groups whose interest is not at all any improvement to African conditions.42 The letter continued to the effect that Orizu and Mbadiwe were clearly from the latter category of unsavoury characters who mixed with dangerous (presumably left-wing) elements. The conclusion was often that these problems could be solved from a financial angle by ensuring that West African students did not find themselves without resources and so resort to the ‘temptation to play to the anti-British gallery.’43 Although the student intelligentsia played a leading role, it could not do so without the mobilization of the popular classes. The role of the intelligentsia was disproportionately visible as the leadership of nationalist movements, but mass mobilizations of other social groups frequently fuelled these movements. A general strike in Zimbabwe in 1948 brought the nationalist struggle to the fore, but Bulawayo shop owner Benjamin Burombo came to epitomize the strike’s leadership.44 In the early 1950s the founding father of Zimbabwean nationalism, Joshua Nkomo, one of the country’s first black graduates, headed the trade union movement.45 The first generation of African leaders after independence were often serious scholars, although this was frequently exaggerated. The presidential intelligentsia crisscrossed the continent. Kenya’s first head of state, Jomo Kenyatta, was the country’s first black anthropologist.46 Uganda’s Milton Obote changed his name to the author of the epic English poem Paradise Lost. While Julius Nyerere in Tanzania is famous for his writings on African socialism, he is less well known for his Kiswahili translations of Julius Caesar and The Merchant of Venice for Oxford University Press. Although Mazrui exaggerates the influence of this presidential intelligentsia, these self-conscious intellectuals helped contribute to campuses that ‘vibrated with debates about fundamental issues of the days … and the role of intellectuals in what was widely designated as “the African revolution”’.47\n\n29\n\nRevolt and protest In reality, independence settlements compelled the student intelligentsia (now transported to the presidency) that had led the anti-colonial struggles to consolidate control in the existing state machinery. Many saw their role as liberators, taking their ‘backward’ societies into the modern (frequently socialist) world.48 For Nkrumah, Senghor and Nyerere (the leaders of Ghanaian, Senegalese and Tanzanian independence) socialism was embodied in the state and in the state they felt themselves ‘above class antagonism generally’.49 As antagonism had no place in their newly founded societies, a classless discourse became a necessity in state control. The state in newly independent Africa became the means of carrying out state-capitalist development.50 So, in Ghana’s case, once independence had been achieved, the movements that had been mobilized in the anti-colonial struggles (and these had been considerable) were abandoned.51 This left the state as the only lever of power. After the first decade of independence (the 1960s), First argued that the process of decolonization had been a ‘bargaining process with cooperative African elites. … The former colonial government guarded its options and … the careerist heirs to independence preoccupied themselves with an “Africanization” of the administration.’52 Tony Cliff offered perhaps the clearest analysis of the role of the intelligentsia in the independent settlement, linking his theory of the ‘deflected permanent revolution’ to Trotsky’s earlier arguments. He maintained that the failure of the working class to lead the movements for national independence and democracy in the Third World, as postulated by Trotsky, was due to the relative inexperience of the working class (often but not always paralysed by the politics of Stalinized communist parties). The leadership of nationalist movements was frequently taken up by a student intelligentsia in a process of deflected permanent revolution. The lack of strategic organization among the working class was in contrast to the high level of political and organizational coherence among students and intellectuals.53 Although Cliff’s argument must be seen as an elaboration (and clarification) of Trotsky’s original theory, he also provided a very clear critique of the role of the intelligentsia in developing\n\n30\n\nPolitics, students and protest: the making of the student intelligentsia societies, ‘as the leader and unifier of the nation, and above all as manipulator of the masses.’54 The intelligentsia, he argued, always attempts to separate itself and rise above society. He describes the Russian populist movement in the nineteenth century as led by an intelligentsia that saw itself as the unique liberator of the peasantry. However, a later intelligentsia, identifying itself with the emergent trade union movement, was forced to be accountable to the collective voice and organizations of the movement. The tendency towards individualism and elitism, Cliff argued,55 is connected to the political and social milieu of the intelligentsia. The political milieu of Russian populist intellectuals was ‘less restrictive, hence they showed clearer and much more extreme tendencies towards elitism, arbitrariness, as towards vacillations and splits’. In the period of nationalist struggles the revolutionary intelligentsia was a far more cohesive factor. The intelligentsia as a non-specialized section of society ‘is the obvious source of a “professional revolutionary elite”’. It is ideally placed to do this because its members are able to pose as the radical (and neutral) arbiters of the nation, against sectional interests, but there is a further aspect to their role. The intelligentsia is the section of society with the clearest concept of national culture and identity, ‘the peasants and workers having neither the leisure nor education for it’. It is therefore not simply their organizational coherence but their status and self-identity as a student intelligentsia, and partly a self-perception as politically privileged actors. This group saw itself as the liberators of Africa and as uniquely representing the emergent nation. As Cliff wrote, ‘They are great believers in efficiency … they hope for reform from above and would dearly love to hand the new world over to a grateful people, rather than see the liberating struggle of a self-conscious and freely associated people result in a new world themselves.’56 This is linked intimately to a vital aspect of student activism that has been analysed by a number of writers.57 The distance students had to travel from their countries – described in the literature as pilgrimages – to colonial schools and colleges in Africa and Europe divorced them from the concerns and realities\n\n31\n\nRevolt and protest of colonial life; they became aware of the distance between their situation and the communities they had left, but crucially of the gap between the West and the national marginalization of their as yet unborn or new nations.58 This geographical element of the student experience remains key to their contemporary selfidentity, expressed in the spatial separation from their family homes and lives in the modern and rarified spaces of the university campus (see Chapter 2). What effect did this have on student activism? It meant that as well as being forged into a ‘national-bureaucratic caste’59 by departing colonial powers, students regarded themselves and their activism as crucial to the development and leadership of the independent state. The inherent elitism of the student intelligentsia simultaneously generates a feeling of guilt and debt towards the masses, ‘and at the same time a feeling of divorcement from, and superiority to them. The intelligentsia are [sic] anxious to belong without being assimilated, without ceasing to remain apart and above.’ Cliff argues that the heightened, one could say, exaggerated power of the intelligentsia derived directly from the ‘feebleness of other social classes, and their political nullity’.60 For this book Cliff’s model serves as a powerful description of how change actually occurred, and the role of the student intelligentsia in it. Indeed, Cliff gives an immensely useful analysis of the nature of student elitism, particularly in the first decade and a half of independence. The more student movements were integrated into broader structures and accountable to wider social forces, the more the elitism of their activism waned (and often the extent of their role in societal change clarified). Equally, the more isolated their activism – an isolation in which students frequently exulted – the more elitist they became.61 As we have seen, students believed they embodied the aspirations of national liberation; they saw themselves as the liberators of the emergent African nation. Mamdani has taken up many of the processes Cliff described. Mamdani claims that this liberation was undertaken by the petit-bourgeois intelligentsia through the levers of the colonial state:\n\n32\n\nPolitics, students and protest: the making of the student intelligentsia Intellectuals ... saw the state and not the class struggle as the motive force of development ... socialism was turned into a strategy for economic development, and no more. Development, in turn, was seen as a technical, suprapolitical and supra-social exercise. It was assumed that this ‘objective’ historical process would erase the ‘backwardness’ of the African people, rather than being itself the by-product of the struggle of that same people for social transformation. From this perspective, it was difficult even to glimpse the possibility of working people in Africa becoming a creative force capable of making history. Rather, history was seen as something to be made outside this force, in lieu of this force and ultimately to be imposed on it.62 However, student activism was not limited to the actions of a diasporic student population studying in Europe and America. Anderson (1991) saw student pilgrims as an essential element in the construction of successful nationalism.63 For a time Ecole Normale William Ponty in Dakar was the centre par excellence that received these student pilgrims from across West Africa; the Institut des Hautes Études (a teaching college), also in Dakar and founded in 1950, later served a similar purpose. It rapidly became a hotbed of anti-colonial agitation. As described in the principal study of the period, ‘the Insitut des Hautes Études of Dakar absorbed all the graduates from French West Africa into four schools. … Despite their small number and the surveillance to which these students are subjected … they will play a very important political role.’64 It provided colonial education for French West Africa, bringing together students from Guinea, Mali and Côte d’Ivoire. Students crossed Francophone West Africa until other secondary schools had been built. The impact on student identity was clear: the state was capable of creating solidarity between the pilgrims. Students acquired a specific identity that was linked to the colonial pilgrimage.65 Students were among the first to champion independence and question the political direction of self-appointed leaders of that\n\n33\n\nRevolt and protest independence. Still, as much of the literature cautions, student activism on the continent during the 1940s and 1950s was limited. Inevitably, as Federici explains, ‘Africa had only a handful of secondary schools and universities; thus those who made it to a college were an absolute minority, who in most cases had to study abroad, often spending many years away from their countries.’66 Diané makes the same point, noting that after more than 50 years of French colonialism, in 1946 not a single university had been created in French West Africa.67 The politically privileged position of students in much of the continent was linked to their exaggerated role in the movements for independence. To be a student at the time was to be alienated from the social world from which many had emerged. The sense of exclusion became the raison d’être of the student movement in the first decade of independence.68 It was a key element in their politically privileged status. They saw themselves as the harbingers of European development, destined to bring about modernization.69 These ideas formed the backbone of much of the political and theoretical thinking in the immediate aftermath of the first wave of independence in Africa.70 Cabral gave a thorough examination of the contradictory identity of the ‘new petty bourgeoisie’. Although he reached the conclusion that independence had failed – ‘we accept the principle that the liberation struggle is a revolution and that it does not finish at the moment when the national flag is raised and the national anthem played’71 – he saw the student intelligentsia as uniquely equipped to bring about real liberation. He argued for the importance of class over ethnicity and believed that the revolution would require what he termed an ideal proletariat whom he saw as the ‘petty bourgeoisie’: the stratum which most rapidly becomes aware of the need to free itself from foreign domination. … This historical responsibility is assumed by the sector of the petty-bourgeoisie which, in the colonial context, can be called revolutionary. … In place of a ‘real proletariat’ an ‘ideal’ one would be comprised of a class of students and\n\n34\n\nPolitics, students and protest: the making of the student intelligentsia intellectuals who would help create unity between the oppressed classes and combat ethnic divisions.72 The class suicide Cabral advocated required the ideal proletariat to make a conscious effort to see the world not as a nascent bourgeoisie but as liberators and modernizers. As Alexander explains, it necessitates ‘a superlative act of the imagination … by means of which they can consistently and consequentially view the world from the angle of vision of the workers and peasants, who constitute the overwhelming majority of the people of the continent’.73 Students inherited a politically "
