        "text": "1 of 17\n\n❯\n\n❮\n\nThe 2015 Africa Cup of Nations will kick off next week. All 16 teams had to submit their final 23-man squads to the Confederation of African Football by Jan. 7. We, at AFKSports, have listed each squad and previewed the coaches and star players of each side. Here are the final 16 squads in the Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nGroup A\n\nGabon\n\nGoalkeepers: Stephane Bitseki (Mounana), Anthony Mezui (Metz/France), Didier Ovono (KV Oostende/Belgium)\n\nDefenders: Aaron Appindangoye (Mounana), Yrondy Musavu King (Caen/France), Bruno Ecuele Manga (Cardiff City/England, second tier), Henri Junior Ndong (Auxerre/France, second tier), Johan Obiang (Chateauroux/France, second tier), Benjamin Ze Ondo (ES Setif/Algeria), Lloyd Palun (Nice/France), Junior Randal Oto Zue (Braga/Portugal)\n\nMidfielders: Kanga Guelor (Rostov/Russia), Mario Lemina (Marseille/France), Levy Madinda (Celta Vigo/Spain), Samson Mbingui (Mouloudia Alger/Ageria), Didier Ibrahim Ndong (CS Sfaxien/Tunisia), Alexander Ndoumbou (Marseille/France), Andre Biyogho Poko (Bordeaux/France)\n\nStrikers: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (Borussia Dortmund/Germany), Frederic Bulot (Charlton Athletic/England, second tier), Malick Evouna (Wydad Casablanca/Morocco), Johan Lengoualama (Difaa El Jadida/Morocco), Romaric Rogombe (AC Leopards/Republic of Congo)\n\nCoach: Jorge Costa has revived the excitement around the Gabonese national team. Known as “The Tank” or “The Animal” in Portugal, Costa should be commended for developing a tricky 4-3-3 that makes Gabon Africa’s best counterattacking side.\n\nStar Player: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is one of the best players in the world at using his pace on the counterattack. His sheer speed and complementary relationship with Malick Evouna are sure to cause countless defences problems at the Afcon.\n\nGroup A\n\nBurkina Faso\n\nGoalkeepers: Moussa Fofana (Kadiogo), Germain Sanou (Bauvais/France, fourth tier), Abdoulaye Soulama (Hearts of Oak/Ghana)\n\nDefenders: Wilfried Balima (Sheriff Tiraspol/Moldova), Narcisse Bambara (Cluj/Romania), Issa Gouo (Kaloum/Guinea), Mohamed Koffi (Zamalek/Egypt), Bakary Kone (Lyon/France), Paul Koulibaly (Horoya/Guinea), Florent Rouamba (Bastia/France), Steve Yago (Toulouse/France)\n\nMidfielders: Adama Guira (Sonderyesk/Denmark), Charles Kabore (Kuban/Russia), Djakaridja Kone (Evian/France), Prejuce Nakoulma (Mersin/Turkey), Abdul Razack Traore (Karakbukspor/Turkey), Bertrand Traore (Vitesse/Netherlands), Moussa Yedan (Al Ahly/Egypt), Jonathan Zongo (Almeria/Spain)\n\nStrikers: Aristide Bance (HJK/Finland), Banou Diawarra (Bobo), Issaka Ouedraogo (Admira Wacker/Austria), Jonathan Pitroipa (Al Jazira/UAE), Alain Traore (Lorient/France)\n\nCoach: Banished from his native Belgium in a match-fixing scandal, Paul Put has found a second home in Burkina Faso. Put has managed this side for about five years, guiding them to a second-place finish in the Cup of Nations two years ago, and just narrowly missing out on a World Cup appearance.\n\nStar Player: In the Upper Volta, no individual is more celebrated than Jonathan Pitroipa. The wiry winger has been a talismanic figure for the Black Stallions for several years now. Now Pitroipa seems to be in the form of his life, leading the continent in scoring during qualifiers with six goals.\n\nGroup A\n\nRepublic of Congo (26 players, provisional squad)\n\nGoalkeepers: Christoffer Mafoumbi (Le Pontet/France, fifth tier), Chansel Massa (AC Leopards), Pavhel Ndzila (Etoile)\n\nDefenders: Dimitri Bissiki, Boris Moubhio (both AC Leopards), Marvin Baudry (Amiens/France, third tier), Antoni Mavoungou (CNFF), Arnold Moutou (Angers/France, second tier), Francis Nganga (Charleroi/Belgium), Igor Nganga (Aarau/Switzerland)\n\nMidfielders: Sagesse Babele, Cesaire Gandze (both Leopards), Hardy Binguila (Diables Noirs), Chris Malonga (Lausanne/Switzerland), Delvin Ndinga (Olympiakos/Greece), Prince Oniangue (Reims/France)\n\nStrikers: Thievy Bifouma (Almeria/Spain), Fode Dore (Cluj/Romania), Ladislas Douniama (Guingamp/France), Sylvere Ganvoula (Raja Casablanca/Morocco), Francis Litsingi (Teplice/Czech Republic), Dominique Malonga (Hibernian/Scotland), Fabrice Ondama (Wydad Casablanca/Morocco)\n\nCoach: Claude LeRoy, the most experienced tournament coach in Africa, manages the Red Devils. His previous success with Cameroon inspires his players, who will make their first appearance at a Cup of Nations in 15 years.\n\nStar Player: The arrival of striker Thievy Bifouma lifted Congo and his impact was immediately felt. The Almeria forward scored two goals in Nigeria and skinned Godfrey Oboabona to assist Prince Oniangue in scoring a third. The win gave Congo a crucial head start in Group A.\n\nGroup A\n\nEquatorial Guinea\n\nGoalkeepers: Aitor Embela (Malaga, Spain), Felipe Ovono Mbang (CD Mongomo, Equatorial Guinea), Carlos Mosibe (CA Malabo, Equatorial Guinea)\n\nDefence: Dani Evuy (Unattached), Diosdado Mbele (Leones Vegetarianos, Equatorial Guinea), Igor Engonga (CD Tropezon, Spain), Armando Bohale (AEK Larnaca, Cyprus), Miguel Angel Mayé Ngomo (Akonangui FC, Equatorial Guinea), Rui Fernando da Gracia Gomes (Hibernians FC, Malta).\n\nMidfielders: Emilio Nsue (Middlesbrough FC, England), JUVENAL Edjogo-Owono (FC Santa Coloma, Andorra), Iban Iyanga (Iraklis Psachna FC, Greece), Iván Zarandona (Rangers FC, Hong Kong), Pablo Ganet (UD San Sebastián de los Reyes, Spain), Carlos Martín (College Europa FC, Gibraltar), Viera Ellong Doualla (The Panthers FC, Equatorial Guinea).\n\nForwards: Javier Balboa Osá (Estoril, Portugal), Iván Salvador Edú (Valencia CF B, Spain), Rubén Belima (Real Madrid CF B, Spain), Iván Bolada (Pune City FC, India), Raúl Fabiani Bosió (CD Olímpic Xàtiva, Spain), Enrique Boula Senobua (RCD Mallorca B, Spain), Rubén Darío (Leones Vegetarianos FC, Equatorial Guinea)\n\nCoach: Esteban Becker was hired only a few days before the Jan. 7 deadline to submit a squad of 23 players. However, the Argentinian coach was employed as Equatorial Guinea’s technical director, so he has good knowledge of his players. Becker has also found success with the national women’s team, winning the 2012 Africa Women’s Championship.\n\nStar Player: Juvenal was Equatorial Guinea’s standout player in 2012, when the co-hosts managed three respectable performances. A very good passer of the ball, Juvenal no longer has the legs to cover the ground he used to, but his 28 caps are a team high, so his accrued experience will be vital in Group A.\n\nGroup B\n\nCape Verde Islands\n\nGoalkeepers: Ivan Cruz (Gil Vicente/Portugal), Kevin Sousa (Nacional/Portugal), Vozinha (Sambizanga/Angola)\n\nDefenders: Carlitos (Apoel Limassol/Cyprus), Gege (Marítimo/Portugal), Jeffrey (Dordrecht/Netherlands), Kay (Craiova/Romania, unaffiliated), Nivaldo (Teplice/Czech Republic), Stopira (Videoton/Hungary), Varela (Steaua Bucharest/Romania)\n\nMidfielders: Babanco (Estoril/Portugal), Calu (Sambizanga/Angola), Platini (CSKA Sofia/Bulgaria), Nuno Rocha (Craiova/Romania, unaffiliated), Samedo (Olhanense/Portugal, second tier), Toni (Excelsior/Netherlands)\n\nStrikers: Djaniny (Santos Laguna/Mexico), Heldon (Sporting Lisbon/Portugal), Kuca (Estoril/Portugal), Garry Mendes (Elche/Spain), Ryan Mendes (Lille/France), Odair (Reims/France), Julio Tavares (Dijon/France, second tier)\n\nCoach: Rui Aguas takes charge of an African national team for the first time in his career. His previous stints in the Portuguese league have left him familiar with many Cape Verde players. He employs a compact 4-3-3, with emphasis on resolute defending.\n\nStar Player: Heldon Ramos scored 12 goals for Sporting last season, playing primarily off of the left flank. On his day, Heldon is untenable with mazy dribbles and dangerous free kicks.\n\nGroup B\n\nDemocratic Republic of Congo\n\nGoalkeepers: Robert Kidiaba (TP Mazembe), Parfait Mandanda (Charleroi, Belgium), Nicaise Kudimbana (Anderlecht, Belgium)\n\nDefenders: , Jean Kaususuka (TP Mazembe), Joel Kimwaki (TP Mazembe), Isama Mpeko (Kabuscorp, Angola), Mabele Bawaka (AS Vita), Chancel Mbemba (Anderlecht, Belgium), Cédric Mongongu (Evian TG, France), Christopher Oualembo (Academica Coimbra, Portugal).\n\nMidfielders: Hervé Kage (Genk, Belgium), Neeskens Kebano (Charleroi, Belgium), Lema Mabidi (AS Vita), Nelson Munganga (AS Vita), Cédric Makiadi (Werder Bremen, Germany), Youssouf Mulumbu (West Bromwich Albion, England), Gabriel Zakuani (Peterborough, England).\n\nForwards: Jeremy Bokila (Terek Grozny, Russia), Yannick Bolasie (Crystal Palace, England), Junior Kabananga (Cercle Bruges, Belgium), Dark Kabangu (FC MK Etanchéité), Firmin Mubele Ndombe (AS Vita), Cédric Mabwati (Osasuna, Spain), Dieumerci Mbokani (Dynamo Kiev, Ukraine)\n\nCoach: Florent Ibenge is perhaps the African coach of the year. After leading local Kinshasa side, AS Vita Club, to the finals of the African Champions League, he managed to qualify the DRC for the Africa Cup of Nations. His knowledge of domestic and professional players will make for a dynamic blend in Equatorial Guinea.\n\nStar Player: Yannick Bolasie has impressed English crowds in the first half of 2014-2015. The erratic winger has put in scrumptious performances against giants like Liverpool and Manchester City. Bolasie must now assume his star status and carry DRC in Group B.\n\nGroup B\n\nTunisia\n\nGoalkeepers: Moez Ben Cherifia (Esperance), Aymen Mathlouthi (Etoile Sahel), Farouk Ben Mustapha (Club Africain)\n\nDefenders: Aymen Abdennour (Monaco/France), Rami Bedoui (Etoile Sahel), Slim Ben Jemai (Laval/France, second tier), Ali Maaloul (CS Sfaxien), Hamza Mathlouthi (Bizertin), Bilel Mohsni (Rangers/Scotland, second tier), Mohamed Ali Yaakoubi (Esperance), Syam Ben Youssef (Astra Giurgiu/Romania)\n\nMidfielders: Mohamed Ali Moncer, Ferjani Sassi (both CS Sfaxien), Yassine Chikhaoui (Zurich/Switzerland), Wahbi Khazri (Bordeaux/France), Youssef Msakni (Lekhwiya/Qatar), Stephane Nater (Club Africain), Houcine Ragued (Esperance), Jamel Saihi (Montpellier/France)\n\nStrikers: Mohamed Amine Chermiti (Zurich/Switzerland), Saber Khalifa (Club Africain), Hamza Younes (Ludogorets Razgrad/Bulgaria), Fakhreddine Ben Youssef (CS Sfaxien)\n\nCoach: Georges Leekens returned to North Africa to coach Tunisia after taking the reins of the Algerian national team in 2003. Then he qualified Les Fennecs to the Cup of Nations and he repeated the feat with the Carthage Eagles. His pragmatic and versatile tactics will trouble any opponent Tunisia comes up against.\n\nStar Player: Yassine Chikhaoui has finally overcome a crippling injury spell, and is having a career campaign. In just over 25 games, the Tunisian attacking midfielder has scored 11 goals and delivered nine assists. Look for him to captain the Carthage Eagles into the later rounds of this tournament.\n\nGroup B\n\nZambia\n\nGoalkeepers: Danny Munyau (Red Arrows), Kennedy Mweene (Sundowns/South Africa), Joshua Titima (Power Dynamos)\n\nDefenders: Donashano Malama, Christopher Munthali (both Nkana), Rodrick Kabwe (Zanaco), Emmanuel Mbola (Hapoel Ra’anana/Israel), Davies Nkausu (Bloemfontein Celtic/South Africa), Stoppila Sunzu (Sochaux/France, second tier)\n\nMidfielders: Rainford Kalaba (TP Mazembe/DR Congo), Chisamba Lungu (Ural/Russia), Kondwani Mtonga (North East United/India), Mukuka Mulenga (Bloemfontein Celtic/South Africa), Bruce Musakanya (Arrows), Lubambo Musonda (Ulisses/Armenia), Spencer Sautu (Green Eagles), Nathan Sinkala (Grasshoppers/Switzerland)\n\nStrikers: Ronald Kampamba (Nkana), Evans Kangwa (Ra’anana/Israel), Emmanuel Mayuka (Southampton/England), Jackson Mwanza (Zesco), Patrick Ngoma (Arrows), Given Singuluma (TP Mazembe/DR Congo)\n\nCoach: Honour Janza has been entrusted with the Chipolopolo after serving on folk hero and AFCON-wining coach Herve Renard’s coaching staff. The local manager knows the domestic league well and will look to harness that unpredictability to gain an advantage in Equatorial Guinea.\n\nStar Player: A few years ago Stoppila Sunzu was linked to a host of Premier League clubs after shackling the likes of Drogba and Gyan in the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations. Sunzu will need to showcase similar performances if Zambia is to progress from Group B.\n\nGroup C\n\nAlgeria\n\nGoalkeepers: Izzeddine Doukha (Kabylie), Rais Mbolhi (Philadelphia Union/USA), Mohamed Zemmamouche (USMA)\n\nDefenders: Essaid Belkalem (Trabzonspor/Turkey), Carl Medjani (Trabzonspor/Turkey), Madjid Bougherra (Fujairah/UAE), Faouzi Ghoualm (Napoli/Italy), Rafik Halliche (Qatar Sports Club/Qatar), Aissa Mandi (Reims/France), Djamel Mesbah (Sampdoria/Italy), Mehdi Zeffane (Lyon/France)\n\nMidfielders: Mehdi Abeid (Newcastle/England), Nabil Bentaleb (Tottenham/England), Yacine Brahimi (Porto/Portugal), Foued Kadir (Real Betis/Spain, second tier), Medhi Lacen (Getafe/Spain), Saphir Taider (Sassuolo/Italy)\n\nStrikers: Ishak Belfodil (Parma/Italy), Abdelmoumene Djabou (Club Africain/Tunisia), Sofiane Feghouli (Valencia/Spain), Riyad Mahrez (Leicester City/England), Islam Slimani (Sporting Lisbon/Portugal), Hilal Soudani (Dinamo Zagreb/Croatia)\n\nCoach: Christian Gourcuff has inherited a talented squad and made them better. Algeria suffered no World Cup hangover as Gourcuff seamlessly implemented his attacking, possession-based philosophy. He is, however, inexperienced in Africa, and that could cause trouble.\n\nStar Player: Yacine Brahimi has been turning heads since his pleasing performances at the World Cup. The supreme dribbler signed with Porto after his exploits in Brazil and has continued to progress since. With Algeria Brahimi is given absolute freedom to roam and create upon whim. Opponents will have to be extremely wary of the pint-sized magician.\n\nGroup C\n\nGhana\n\nGoalkeepers: Razak Braimah (Mirandes/Spain, second tier), Fatau Dauda (AshGold), Ernest Sowah (Don Bosco/DR Congo)\n\nDefenders: Edwin Gyimah (both Black Aces/South Africa), Harrison Afful (Esperance/Tunisia), Daniel Amartey (Copenhagen/Denmark), Mohammed Awal (Maritzburg/South Africa), John Boye (Erciyesspor/Turkey), Jonathan Mensah (Evian/France), Baba Rahman (Augsburg/Germany)\n\nMidfielders: Frank Acheampong (Anderlecht/Belgium), Emmanuel Agyemang-Badu (Udinese/Italy), Solomon Asante (TP Mazembe/DR Congo), Christian Atsu (Everton/England), Andre Ayew (Marseille/France), Rabiu Mohammed (Krasnodar/Russia), Mubarak Wakaso (Celtic/Scotland)\n\nStrikers: David Accam (Chicago Fire/USA), Kwesi Appiah (Cambridge/England, fourth tier), Jordan Ayew (Lorient/France), Asamoah Gyan (Al Ain/UAE),\n\nCoach: Avram Grant was not in charge of the Ghanaian squad for a single match during qualifiers. He takes over after being out of work for three years and must now try to guide a notoriously rowdy Ghanaian side past the group of death.\n\nStar Player: Without Majeed Waris, Kwadwo Asamoah, Michael Essien, Sulley Muntari, or Prince Boateng, Asamoah Gyan is undoubtedly the star man for the Black Stars. The man playing his football in the United Arab Emirates has not lost his scoring touch, and he will carry the offensive burden again during the AFCON.\n\nGroup C\n\nSenegal (28 players, provisional squad)\n\nGoalkeepers: Pape Camara (Sochaux/France, second tier), Bouna Coundoul (Ethnikos Achnas/Cyprus), Lys Gomis (Trappani/Italy, second tier)\n\nDefenders: Papy Djilobodji (Nantes/France), Boukary Drame (Atalanta/Italy), Lamine Gassama (Lorient/France), Cheikh Mbengue (Rennes/France), Kara Mbodj (Genk/Belgium), Lamine Sane (Bordeaux/France), Pape Ndiaye Souare (Lille/France), Zargo Toure (Le Havre/France, second tier)\n\nMidfielders: Stephane Badji (Brann/Norway), Pape Kouli Diop (Levante/Spain), Idrissa Gana Gueye (Lille/France), Cheikhou Kouyate (West Ham United/England), Alfred Ndiaye (Real Betis/Spain, second tier), Salif Sane (Hannover/Germany)\n\nStrikers: Papiss Cisse (Newcastle United/England), Mame Diouf (Stoke City/England), Moussa Konate (Sion/Switzerland), Dame Ndoye (Lokomotiv Moscow/Russia), Moussa Sow (Fenerbahce/Turkey)\n\nCoach: Former French midfielder Alain Giresse heads the Teranga Lions. Giresse has implemented a level of defensive solidity that had previously evaded Senegal.\n\nStar Player: There are doubts over Sadio Mane’s participation after tearing his hamstring with Southampton. But if the pacy winger plays, he will be Senegal’s go-to option in attack. His mazy dribbling capabilities compensate for a lack of creativity in midfield.\n\nGroup C\n\nSouth Africa\n\nGoalkeepers: Darren Keet (Kortrijk/Belgium), Brilliant Khuzwayo (Kaizer Chiefs), Jackson Mabokgwane (Black Aces), Siyabonga Mpontshane (Platinum)\n\nDefenders: Thabo Matlaba, Ntsikelelo Nyauza, Patrick Phungwayo (all Orlando Pirates), Thulani Hlatswayo, Siyabonga Nhlapo (both Wits), Rivaldo Coetzee (Ajax Cape Town), Mzikayise Mashaba (Sundowns), Eric Mathoho (Chiefs), Kwanda Mngonyama (Maritzburg), Anele Ngcongca (Genk/Belgium)\n\nMidfielders: Asavele Mbekile, Bongani Zungu, Themba Zwane (all Sundowns), Reneilwe Letsholonyane, Mandla Masango (both Chiefs), Jabulani Shongwe, Sibusiso Vilakazi (both Wits), Mondli Cele (Maritzburg), Dean Furman (Doncaster Rovers/England, third tier), Andile Jali (KV Oostende/Belgium), Oupa Manyisa (Pirates), Thuso Phala (SuperSport), Thamsanqa Sangweni (Chippa), Thulani Serero (Ajax Amsterdam/Netherlands), Vuyisile Wana (Swallows)\n\nStrikers: Bongani Ndulula (AmaZulu), Tokelo Rantie (Bournemouth/England, second tier), Bernard Parker (Chiefs), Ayanda Patosi (Lokeren/Belgium), David Zulu (Chippa)\n\nCoach: Shakes Mashaba is the people’s champion in South Africa. After taking the Olympic team to new heads in the early millennium, Mashaba has returned to qualify Bafana Bafana to the AFCON after an embarrassing World Cup qualifying campaign under Gordon Igesund.\n\nStar Player: South Africa’s strength is shutdown defense, as they hadn’t conceded a single goal until match day five. In attack, however, very little was created. Tokyo Rantie’s solo efforts won South Africa points on various occasions. He will be their key man in Equatorial Guinea.\n\nGroup D\n\nCameroon\n\nGoalkeepers: Pierre Abogo (Tonnerre), Guy Assembe (Nancy/France, second tier), Joseph Ondoua (Barcelona/Spain)\n\nDefenders: Brice Ekongolo, Nicolas Nkoulou (both Marseille/France), Jerome Ata (Valenciennes/France, second tier), Franck Bagnack (Barcelona/Spain), Henri Bedimo (Lyon/France), Ambroise Bitolo (New York Red Bulls/USA), Cedric Djeugoue (Coton Sport)\n\nMidfielders: Patrick Ekeng (Cordoba/Spain), Enoh Eyong (Standard Liege/Belgium), Franck Kom (Etoile Sahel/Tunisia), Raoul Loe (Osasuna/Spain, second tier), Georges Mandjeck (Erciyesspor/Turkey), Stephane Mbia (Sevilla/Spain), Edgard Salli (Academica Coimbra/Portugal)\n\nStrikers: Vincent Aboubakar (Porto/Portugal), Eric-Maxim Choupo-Moting (Schalke/Germany), Franck Etoundi (Zurich/Switzerland), Leonard Kwekeu (Caykur Rizespor/Turkey), Benjamin Moukandjo (Reims/France), Clinton N’Jie (Lyon/France), Jacques Zoua (Erciyesspor/Turkey)\n\nCoach: Volker Finke has rehabilitated his image after Cameroon showcased a series of scatterbrained performances at the World Cup. The German was gifted an extra six months to right the ship, and he has completed a magnificent turnaround by discarding several superegos from the Indomitable Lions set-up.\n\nStar Player: Replacing Samuel Eto’o is mission impossible, but Vincent Aboubakar is doing a hell of a job in trying. The Porto hitman scored several crucial goals and ensured Cameroon topped their qualifying group after match day five.\n\nGroup D\n\nGuinea\n\nGoalkeepers: Abdul Aziz Keita (AS Kaloum/Guinea), Naby Yattara (Arles Avignon/France), Aboubacar Camara (Murcia/Spain)\n\nDefenders: Djibril Tamsir Paye (Zulte Waregem/Belgium), Fode Camara (Horoya AC/Guinea), Abdoulaye Cisse (Angers/France),Mohammed Diarra (Odense/Denmark), Florentin Pogba (St Etienne/France), Baissama Sankoh (Guingamp/France), Issiaga Sylla (Toulouse/France), Kamil Zayatte (Sheffield Wednesday/England)\n\nMidfielders: Kevin Constant (Trabzonspor/Turkey), Ibrahima Conte (Anderlecht/Belgium), Lanfia Camara (Mechelen/Belgium), Boubacar Fofana (Nacional/Portugal), Naby Keita (Red Bull Salzburg/Austria), Bouna Sarr (Metz/France)\n\nForwards: Abdoul Camara (Angers/France), Francois Kamano (Bastia/France) Seydouba Soumah (Slovan Bratislava/Slovakia), Idrissa Sylla (Zulte Waregem/Belgium), Ibrahima Traore (Borussia Monchengladbach/Germany), Mohamed Yattara (Lyon/France)\n\nCoach: Michel Dussuyer should be commended for juggling the offfield horrors of the Ebola virus and the onfield problems of a tough qualifying group.\n\nStar Player: Ibrahima Traore is a defender’s nightmare. The pocket-sized midfielder enjoys cutting on to his left foot from the right flank and very few fullbacks are equipped to handle his agile movement. Shackling Traore will go a longways towards shackling Guinea.\n\nGroup D\n\nCote D’Ivoire\n\nGoalkeepers : Gbohouo Sylvain (Sewe Sport/Ivory Coast), Mande Sayouba (Staebek), Coppa Barry (Lokeren/Belgium).\n\nDefenders : Aurier Serge (PSG/France), Tiené Siaka (Montpellier/France), Viera Ousmane (Rizespor/Turkey), Kolo Touré (Liverpool/England), Wilfried Kanon (ADO/Holand), Eric Bertrand Bailly (Espanyol/Spain), Akpa Akpro Jean-Daniel (Toulouse/France)\n\nMidfielders : Diomandé Ismael (Saint-Etienne/France), Yaya Touré (Manchester City/England), Serey Die Geoffrey (Basel/Switzerland), Doukouré Cheick (Metz/France), Tioté Cheick (Newcastle/England), Gradel Max-Alain (Saint-Etienne/France), Assalé Roger (Sewe Sport/Ivory Coast).\n\nForwards : Gervinho (AS Roma/Italy), Kalou Salomon (Hertha Berlin/Germany), Traoré Lacina (Monaco/France), Tallo Junior (Bastia/France), Bony Wilfried (Swansea/Wales), Seydou Doumbia (CSKA Moscow/Russia)\n\nCoach: Hervé Renard was the populist choice to replace Sabri Lamouchi, as he had already won the title that has eluded Les Elephants for so long. In 2012 the white-shirted Frenchman helped Zambia to their first ever Cup of Nations title over the team he now manages.\n\nStar Player: Yaya Toure is quite comfortably one of the best players in the world. His reign in Africa has been unchallenged as he won three consecutive Glo-CAF African Player of the Year awards. Now, more than ever, Toure is Cote D’Ivoire’s star player, and it might be his last chance to win this continental title that Cote D’Ivoire have envied for so long.\n\nGroup D\n\nMali\n\nGoalkeepers: Germain Berthe (Onze Createurs), Soumaila Diakite (Esteghlal/Iran), Ntji Samake (Dougouwolofila)\n\nDefenders: Idrissa Coulibaly (Hassania Agadir/Morocco), Ousmane Coulibaly (Platanias/Greece), Salif Coulibaly (TP Mazembe/DR Congo), Drissa Diakite (Bastia/France), Fousseyni Diawara (Tours/France, second tier), Mohamed Konate (Nahdat Berkane/Morocco), Adama Tamboura (Randers/Denmark), Molla Wague (Udinese/Italy)\n\nMidfielders: Sigamary Diarra (Valenciennes/France, second tier), Ahmed Doumbia (Toulouse/France), Seydou Keita (Roma/Italy), Mamoutou Ndiaye (Waregem/Belgium), Bakary Sako (Wolves/England, second tier), Yacouba Sylla (Erciyesspor/Turkey), Abdou Traore (Bordeaux/France), Sambou Yatabare (Guingamp/France)\n\nStrikers: Cheick Diabate (Bordeaux/France), Abdoulaye Diaby (Mouscron/Belgium), Modibo Maiga (Metz/France), Mustapha Yatabare (Trabzonspor/Turkey)\n\nCoach: The sexuagenarian Polish journeyman has displayed tactical acumen in the biggest matches of qualification against Algeria. In Blida he stacked two lines of four, shutting out Africa’s top-ranked team until the final minutes. In Bamako he succeeded in disturbing Algeria’s passing rhythm in a 2-0 victory.\n\nStar Player: It is virtually impossible understanding the stature given to Seydou Keita in Mali. Keita is such a large persona, he carries an aura of gravitas that naturally translates to leadership on the pitch. Les Aigles will also look to him for attacking spark from set-pieces."
