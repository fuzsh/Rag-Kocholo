Guinea—Politics and government—20th century. I. Title. DT543.8.M35 2013 966.52’03—dc23 2012019394 This paper meets the requirements of ANSI/NISO Z39.48-1992 (Permanence of Paper).\n\nAny large-scale account of human action has to involve both “history” and “sociology”: a narrative of the collective subject’s passage through time and an analysis of how that subject is constituted. The former is often regarded as a “dynamic” dimension and the latter as a “static” one. And while it can be readily conceded that they are just dimensions, aspects of what is concretely a complex, undecomposable unity, the problem stubbornly remains of how to write about either without the distortion of not simultaneously writing about the other. —J. D. Y. Peel Marginals stand outside the state by tying themselves to it; they constitute the state locally by ﬂeeing from it. As culturally “different” subjects they can never be citizens; as culturally different “subjects” they can never escape citizenship. —Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing Zusammen gestohlen aus verschiedenem diesem und jenem —Beethoven, autograph to String Quartet in C ♯ minor, opus 131\n\nFor Margaret and Thomas McGovern\n\nCONTENTS\n\nNote on Orthography / xi Acknowledgments / xiii PART I : THE GRAMMAR AND RHETORIC OF IDENTITY\n\nONE\n\n/ Competing Cosmopolitanisms / 3\n\nIconoclasm as a Cosmopolitan Idiom / 5 Uncanny Iconoclasm / 8 Jouissance and the Search for Purity / 12 Ethnogenesis: Two or Three Things I Know about It / 14 Iconoclasm and Ethnogenesis in the Context of Competing Cosmopolitanisms / 19 The Chapters / 20 T WO\n\n/ The Tactics of Mutable Identity / 27\n\nInsecurity, Migration, and Fluidity of Identities / 31 The Koivogui-Kamara Corridor and the Question of Ethnicity / 39 Clanship and Ethnic Mediation / 52 Who Was “Malinke” in 1921? / 55 Living with Violence, Binding Insecurity / 60\n\nInterlude I: Togba’s Sword / 63 THREE\n\n/ Autochthony as a Cultural Resource / 65\n\nAutochthony as a Cultural Resource / 67 The Politics of Sacriﬁce / 70 The Signiﬁcance of Oaths and Ordeals / 80\n\nFOUR\n\n/ The Emergence of Ethnicity / 85\n\nSpace, Landscape, and Production: Loma Rice Farming / 87 Land Tenure and Cash Crops / 89 The Logic of Ethnicized Territory / 93 Mise en Valeur and Ethnicity / 100 Mamadi’s Story / 106 FIVE\n\n/ Portable Identities and the Politics of Religion along the Forest–Savanna Border / 111\n\nPortable Identities / 114 Iconoclastic Precedents / 123 Monotheism and Modernist Anxiety / 133 Northern–Southwestern Mande Links and Their Denial / 137 PART II : REVEALING AND RESHAPING THE BODY POLITIC\n\nInterlude II: Bonﬁre / 143 SIX\n\n/ Personae: Demystiﬁcation and the Mask / 147\n\nChanging Notions of Personhood in Modernist Political Discourse: Personae, Masks, and Mystiﬁcation / 152 Contradictory Cosmopolitanism: Marxism and the Modern Person / 160 Modernist Anxiety and Double Double Consciousness / 164 SEVEN\n\n/ Unmasking the State: Making Guinea Modern / 167\n\nDemystiﬁcation, the Forest Region, and the Guinean Nation / 170 Demystiﬁcation: An “Inside Job”? / 179 The Cultural Politics of Catching Up: A Comparison / 184 A Convergence of Reasonings / 191 EIGHT\n\n/ Performing the Self, Performing the Nation / 195\n\nThe Aesthetics of Discretion and the State / 196 Aestheticization, Folklorization, Re-presentation / 208 A Sociology of Ambition / 219 Surviving Authoritarianism / 225 CONCLUSION\n\n/ Double Double Consciousness in an African Postcolony / 227\n\nThe First Legacy: Denigration into Ethnic Solidarity / 228 The Second Legacy: Embattlement into National Solidarity / 231 Violence, Marginality, and Divided Consciousness / 233\n\nAppendix 1 / List of Kɔ kɔ lɔ gi/zu and their dominant clans, according to Beavogui/Person / 237 Appendix 2 / Agricultural Production in Giziwulu, 1999 / 241 Notes / 245 Works Cited / 275 Index / 289\n\nNOTE ON ORTHOGRAPHY\n\nLoma terms are written using a combination of International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) and French orthography. Consonants: For the implosive “b,” I have retained the French “gb” (instead of the IPA ß). For the voiceless labiovelar stop, I have retained the French “kp.” However, for the voiced velar fricative, I use the IPA gamma symbol (“g“) rather than the French “gh.”1 Vowels: “a,” “e,” “i,” “o,” and “u” all occur in Lomagui, and are pronounced as in Spanish or according to IPA conventions (“a” as in “bat”; “e” as in “say”; “i” as in “meet”; “o” as in “know”; and “u” as in “glue.” In addition, there are two more vowel sounds in Loma, for which I have used IPA conventions: “e“ as in “met”; and “ɔ” as in “not.” I have written Loma words using the deﬁnite article, which, in Lomagui, is the sufﬁx “i” or “gi.” Plurals are formed by adding the sufﬁx “ti” to the end of the deﬁnite article. The text also uses a number of terms from the northern Mande languages, namely Maninkakan. Plurals in Maninkakan are formed by adding the sufﬁx “lu” (sometimes “nu”) to a word, though in the literature, the Bamanakan pluralization, formed with the sufﬁx “w,” is more common.\n\n1. In the southern Guinean dialects of Lomagui, the sound that I render as “ng” often sounds more like a nasalized glottal stop. However, the velar fricative sound does sometimes come through, so I have decided to use the “ng” orthography. In northern Loma dialects, this sound is often dropped altogether, especially from the beginning of words (e.g., “ngazanui” = “azanui” (“woman”), or “ngalui” = “alui” (“moon”).\n\nAC K N OW L E D G M E N T S\n\nI was told about the case in Texas, but it had happened in another state. It has a single protagonist (though in every story there are thousands of protagonists, visible and invisible, alive and dead). —Jorge Luis Borges\n\nSo begins Borges’s parable “The Ethnographer.” In considering my own debts as an ethnographer, I admire his prescience. There are thousands of protagonists in the pages that follow, and it is a pleasure to have the opportunity to thank a few here. The research was funded at various points by many institutions. The ﬁnished product would have been impossible without their help. I thank Emory University, which was always generous both with fellowship and ancillary support; the SSRC International Dissertation Research Fellowship, which funded research in 1997; the SSRC-MacArthur Peace and Security in a Changing World fellowship, which supported research in both England and Guinea between 1997 and 1999; a Fulbright-Hays fellowship, which supported my research in Guinea in 2000–2001; and a Harry Frank Guggenheim Dissertation Writing Fellowship, which underwrote my writing during 2003. A sabbatical leave and a Yale MacMillan Center Faculty Research Grant allowed me to return for much of the 2008–2009 academic year to undertake the research that led to chapter 8 of this book. In Guinea, I would have accomplished nothing without the help of my Guinean colleagues and friends in Macenta Préfecture and in Conakry. Alamako Onepogui, Pepe Bilivogui, and Aboubacar “Banks” Kourouma worked alongside me at different moments as research colleagues and earned my unending gratitude. Jacques Onivogui was my ﬁrst French\n\nxiv / Acknowledgments\n\nteacher in Guinea and has remained an indispensable guide. Professor Galema Guilavogui facilitated my research at every step and generously shared his thoughts with me about Loma history both when he served as Secretary General of the University Gamal Abdel Nasser and when he served as Minister of National Education. Ambassador Tolo Beavogui, also a historian who has served his country in diverse ways, shared his expertise with me in conversation and correspondence. My friends in Conakry, especially Dr. Serge Mara and Vaba Guilavogui, helped my wife Susan and me in numerous ways. Other friends in Conakry, including El Hadj Tafsir Thiam, Ousmane Barry, Kim Maggio, Gaby Sanoussi, and Martin and Kadi Hartney, also made our time in the capital enjoyable and proﬁtable. I thank M. Cissé and M. Kaba at the National Archives and Dr. Sylla at the Bibliothèque Nationale for their generous help. Among my debts to Guinean intellectuals, perhaps none surpasses that to Facinet Beavogui, the brilliant and thorough historian of the Loma-speaking region. I never had a chance to meet him before his untimely death, but I feel as if I have shared many conversations with him about Loma history and culture. In the forest region, I must start in N’Zerekore with my old friend Alain Koivogui, friend and palm wine–drinking companion. Thanks also to the Bakoly family. In Macenta Préfecture, I thank Gile, Mao, Chinois, Pepe and Doyen Bilivogui, and on the women’s side of the family, Loopu Kalivogui, Kulubo Bilivogui, Fanta Kalivogui, and Ouidoh Pivi. On the other side of the village, I thank Bala Pivi, Nyankoye and Parisien Pivi, and Siaka Bilivogui. The late Pokpa Kalivogui and Foromo Kalivogui facilitated my stay. During the research, Oua Bilivogui, Siaka Bilivogui, N’Zolea Bilivogui, Pascal Pivi, Siba III Kalivogui, and Duogi Pivi were of enormous help. In my second research site, Avit Beavogui and the late Elisabeth Onivogui were my hosts, teachers, and friends during a crucial period in my research. Finally, in the Guekedou area, I relied heavily on the hospitality and assistance of Eddie Keturakis and Khadiatou Diallo. Dominique Millimounou and the team he assembled were fantastic and incredibly hard-working. Back home, my thanks go to my mentors and colleagues who have saved me from many errors, though I have stubbornly insisted on forging ahead with some of my more idiosyncratic interpretations. Parts of this book started life as a portion of my very long Ph.D. dissertation, and my committee went far beyond their professional obligations in making sure it was as good a document as I could manage. Ivan Karp, my advisor throughout, was an unending source of ideas, citations, and engaged criticism. His death in 2011 means that he did not see this book come into being, but nearly every page bears some mark of his inﬂuence. Cory Kratz has, since\n\nAcknowledgments / xv\n\nmy ﬁrst semester of graduate school, read my work with tremendous attentiveness. Many manuscript pages have come back to me with as much of her writing on them as my own. Like Ivan, she has pushed me to situate my analysis not only in relation to the regional literature, but also in comparison to works from across the continent. Eddy Bay single-handedly convinced me of the importance of addressing the issues that now underpin the historical angle of this study, and has consistently challenged me to keep gender in the foreground and to clarify what I meant when I wrote about ethnicity. Bruce Knauft brought a refreshing Melanesianist perspective to his generous engagements with my material and helped save me from the “curse of the OK.” Over the years of working on this project, I have met and learned from many others, both professors and students. I thank especially my co-Guineanists. Chris Hayden gets top billing here: he sent books from France, shared many archival documents, and has always read my work carefully, providing collegial and constructive critiques. Nicole Anderson, Lacey Andrews, Alexis Arieff, David Berliner, Graeme Cousens, Becky Furth, Tim Geysbeek, Odile Goerg, Siba Grovogui, Doug Henry, Christian Højbjerg, Jean-Hervé Jézéquel, Lansine Kaba, Fred Lamp, Claude Rivière, Ramon Sarró, and Jay Straker all helped in important ways at different times. I must especially single out James Fairhead and Melissa Leach for sharing with me some tremendous documents from their vast collection, including the Seymour and Ash narratives from the 1860s, which they were then annotating along with Tim Geysbeek. In addition, thanks to Mariane Ferme, Caspar Fithen, Lans Gberie, Will Reno, Paul Richards, Rosalind Shaw, and Susan Shepler for bouncing ideas around from the Sierra Leone side; to Warren d’Azevedo, Jeanette Carter, Stephen Ellis, Comfort Ero, Svend Holsoe, Byron Tarr, and Mats Utas from the Liberia side; Joanna Davidson, Eric Gable, and Marina Temudo from Guinea Bissau; and Mary Jo Arnoldi, James Brink, and Rod McIntosh from the Malian side. My colleagues at Yale have been consistently challenging, stimulating, and supportive. Barney Bate, Kamari Clarke, Narges Erami, Erik Harms, Marcia Inhorn, Bill Kelly, Kwame Onoma, Rod McIntosh, Catherine Panter-Brick, Doug Rogers, Jim Scott, Shivi Sivaramakrishnan, Helen Siu, David Watts, and Libby Wood deserve special mention, as do my inspiring graduate students Susanna Fioratta, Mike Degani, Adrienne Cohen, and Samar Al-Bulushi. Stacey Maples of Yale’s Beinecke Library has become my indispensible cartographer. Chapter 2’s argument has been signiﬁcantly clariﬁed and improved by his work. Among those who have shaped my\n\nxvi / Acknowledgments\n\nintellectual horizons generally and this project in various ways are Sealing Cheng, Ken George, Peter Geschiere, Yvan Guichaoua, Katrin Hansing, Doug Holmes, Wendy James, Peri Klemm, Julie Livingston, Greg Mann, Peter Mark, Donna Murdock, Polly Nooter-Roberts, David Parkin, Al Roberts, Sunanda Sanyal, Dan Smith, Krista Thompson, Bob White, and Luise White. Rob Leopold and the late Bill Siegmann contributed more to this work than I could enumerate here. I especially thank Rob for his astute reading of the manuscript. He saved me from plenty of mistakes, small and large. I am sorry that Bill, like Ivan, could not see this fruition of our many conversations. As this work moved toward life as a book, I beneﬁted enormously from the kind solicitude of David Brent, my editor at the University of Chicago Press. Priya Nelson has also been wonderfully responsive and helpful. Two anonymous reviewers provided encouragement and constructive critique that deﬁnitely improved the book. Thanks to them. There are those family and friends without whom this project never would have happened. Thanks to Matthew Dwyer, Kim Eadie, Brian Keizer, Tim Merello, Jerry Neumann, Rachel Norwood, Jason Pronyk, and Lupe Salazar for friendship and encouragement. My in-laws, Don and Genie David, have been extremely supportive and also braved the long trip to Conakry, Labe, and beyond. The ﬁnal and deepest thanks are to my two families. My family of choice, Susan, Theo, and Delia, has been involved with every step of the development of this project. From graduate coursework at Emory to archival work in Provence to a year in England, Susan and I logged many frequent ﬂyer miles and many hours on the phone. Every moment of my ﬁeldwork was shared with her, as was almost every moment of the book’s long gestation. Our children have leavened the stresses of work with the joys of life together, and I think this has made for a better book. My parents, Margaret and Thomas McGovern, have supported my intellectual growth since my childhood, sacriﬁcing time, energy, and money to do what was best for my education rather than their own comfort. They could never have expected that my intellectual and personal energies would become directed toward understanding a small corner of West Africa, but they can hardly doubt that those energies have been channeled by the discipline, self-motivation, and excitement they instilled in me and the intellectual training they always supported. This book is dedicated to them.\n\nPA R T O N E\n\nThe Grammar and Rhetoric of Identity\n\nONE\n\nCompeting Cosmopolitanisms\n\nThis is a book about iconoclasm and ethnogenesis—that is, about the attempt to destroy objectionable objects and the coming into being of new ethnic identities. Each acted on the other in the region of West Africa that came to be known as the Republic of Guinea. They were, to use the somewhat pretentious academic phrase, mutually constitutive. In this book I argue that seemingly unrelated factors, including slash-and-burn agriculture, the existence of inherited clans with special relations to totemic animals, and the presence or absence of professional oral historians, played crucial roles in this process. Above all, it was the imposition of state power on the formerly decentralized region where each three or four villages had been a law unto themselves that set into motion the reciprocal development of iconoclasm and ethnogenesis in the rainforest–savanna frontier zone I write about. There are four such states relevant to the story I tell in the following pages. The ﬁrst was that of the Almamy Samory Touré, a late-nineteenthcentury conqueror and proselytizer whose state encompassed much of the region that was to become Guinée forestière and more speciﬁcally, Macenta Préfecture (map 1). The second was the French colonial state. The third, and most important for this story, was the government headed by Sékou Touré from independence in 1958 to his death in 1984. After Guinea alone among French colonies chose immediate and complete independence in September 1958, his government built policy out of an ideological commitment to state-socialist modernism and Pan-Africanist valorization of precolonial history and culture. The fourth state that enters the story obliquely is that of the post-socialist government of Lansana Conté, an army colonel who took power in a coup d’état one week after Touré’s death in 1984, and who held on to it, as Touré had done, until his death in 2008. Not much of\n\nMap 1. Map of Guinea\n\nCompeting Cosmopolitanisms / 5\n\nthis book is about the Conté period, but because almost all of the research for it was conducted during the Conté years, there are occasional references to it. This book, a historical ethnography of the socialist period in Guinea, will be followed by a later book that focuses on the legacy of socialism under conditions of postsocialist governance in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nIconoclasm as a Cosmopolitan Idiom [T]he revolution is devoted to acting on the people so that they come back to themselves [pour qu’il revienne à lui-même], to their personality, to their originality. . . . (Touré 1969, 351)\n\nThe “Demystiﬁcation Program” was launched almost immediately after Guinea claimed its independence from France in a referendum.1 It speciﬁcally targeted all forms of precolonial cultural practice deemed backward or primitive, and it focused to a large degree on the polytheistic periphery of a country that had become about 80 percent Muslim and 10 percent Christian by the end of colonialism. Demystiﬁcation teams including soldiers and representatives from the Ministry of Culture went from village to village, forcibly collecting masks and ﬁgurines and burning most of them while taking a few to display in national and regional museums, and recruiting young people to perform the initiation dances that they simultaneously outlawed. The Guinean state demanded several transformations of the country’s peripheral inhabitants, including the choice of a monotheistic religion.2 As newly independent Guinea embraced socialism in the early 1960s, national elites embraced several forms of cosmopolitan practice and discourse that hailed Guinea’s arrival on the international scene. Yet these cosmopolitan idioms were not, themselves, without contradictions and ambivalences. Scientiﬁc socialism held out the promise that countries like Guinea could vault forward in the political economic queue, but only if they acknowledged and then renounced their alleged backwardness. PanAfricanism, by contrast, allowed African countries to embrace African histories and cultures denigrated by Eurocentric ideologies, but it offered mostly intangible beneﬁts to a country seeking rapid economic development. In this context, Guinean state elites mobilized a third cosmopolitan form that partially resolved the contradictions within and between transnational Marxism and Pan-Africanism. Iconoclastic sweeps aimed at eradicating religious “fetishism” and social “mystiﬁcation.” While I am interested in the ways the Demystiﬁcation Program was ex-\n\n6 / Chapter One\n\nFigure 1. “We prefer liberty in poverty to opulence in slavery.” From L’action politique du Parti Démocratique de Guinée en faveur de l’émancipation de la Jeunesse guinéenne.\n\nperienced by speakers of Lomagui in the region where I conducted ﬁeldwork, this book takes Demystiﬁcation as a window on the logics, dynamics, and internal contradictions of a postcolonial socialist state.3 Why did eradicating polytheism become one of a ﬂedgling country’s ﬁrst policy initiatives? Why was the program prosecuted with such ferocity—beating and publicly humiliating elders, exposing men’s sacred objects to women, who were supposed to be rendered infertile or die as a result? Why was it announced a total success about once a year, only to be started over the next? To get at that set of questions, I will begin with a brief ethnographic vignette and then suggest three possible frames for interpreting it. The\n\nCompeting Cosmopolitanisms / 7\n\nframes do not exist in a zero-sum relation to one another, but each one (in my mind at least) adds further nuances to the others. The effect, I hope, will be one of increasingly subtle and complex interpretation. In the end, I don’t intend to offer a single interpretive frame that accounts for all of the phenomena involved in Demystiﬁcation—in fact after twenty years of trying to understand this iconoclastic movement, I still ﬁnd it perplexing, so will not pretend to that type of mastery. I begin with a story that I have been mulling over for many years. I was in my second ﬁeldwork site, beginning to settle in after a month or two. Having spent ﬁfteen months in an isolated, ethnically homogenous Lomaspeaking4 village of about 1,200 inhabitants, I was now working in a small, ethnically heterogeneous town of 8,000 people about 40 km away. I was speaking with an elder Loma man, and we were talking about the history of his town, including current relations between the two main ethnolinguistic groups who lived there, the Loma (understood to be the original inhabitants of the area) and the Manya (one of the two biggest ethnic groups in the country but understood to be relative newcomers in this region). As we were talking, an older man walked by at a distance. He greeted my interlocutor in Maninkakan (a Northern Mande language), and we responded in kind. The elder Loma man talking with me said, “You see him? He and I were initiated into the men’s secret society together. In the sacred forest, everything took place in the Loma language. He spoke Lomagui perfectly. Today, he is a Muslim elder and would deny that he was ever initiated. If you greet him in Lomagui, he will pretend not even to understand you. You should try it the next time you see him. And yet, he has the same cicatrizations on his back as me.”5 I did indeed try a few days later, and he responded to my Loma greeting with the roughly equivalent response in Maninkakan. For Loma speakers, the bonding that takes place between initiates secluded for months or even years in the forest is one of the strongest social ties that exists,6 and it cuts across all other solidarities created by kinship, marriage, religious, or even ethnic relations. What troubled my Loma informant and many other Loma people I knew well was what they perceived to be the hypocrisy of this sort of personal erasure—a form of iconoclasm at the individual level. That full immersion into Islam required a renunciation of secret society membership was well understood. The same was true for serious converts to Protestant (though not necessarily Catholic) Christianity. Most Loma speakers who did not convert to a world religion might not have valued this choice, but they understood it. What they did not understand was why embracing a world religion would entail such a\n\n8 / Chapter One\n\nthoroughgoing attempt to efface past actions that were easily veriﬁable by those who had been there to witness the events. Why, they asked, pretend not to even know the greetings in a language one once spoke ﬂuently and continued to hear spoken every day? I would like to take this small everyday case as a starting point for thinking through the complexities of iconoclasm at the everyday level of village life. I believe that if we can untangle some of the complications involved in such a story of personal iconoclastic self-making, we will be able to understand something new about the history and sociology of this postcolony. To understand the kind of state postcolonial Guinea was and what it aspired to be, it helps to understand the reasons why iconoclasm became a privileged tool in the state’s arsenal for shaping new socialist citizens. Understanding iconoclasm in Guinea may also give some new critical purchase to the broader discussion of iconoclasm as practice and ideology.\n\nUncanny Iconoclasm Guinea’s Demystiﬁcation Program prompts three questions: 1 Why do some objects become so objectionable to iconoclasts that they “require” their own eradication? 2 How does this process work, even when the objects in question have never been seen by those who ﬁnd them offensive, and they will in fact have to be viewed for the ﬁrst time in order to destroy them? 3 What accounts for the particularly strong affective component in iconoclastic movements such as the one in Guinea?\n\nTo try to answer the ﬁrst question, “Why do some objects become so objectionable to iconoclasts that they ‘require’ their own eradication?” I turn to W.J.T. Mitchell. Mitchell’s work is important precisely because of his ability to bring clinically precise thinking to the phenomenon of the power of images. This power is perfectly intuitive at the same time that it is extremely difﬁcult to explicate. Mitchell’s framework for unraveling this problem draws on both Marx and Freud, but uses them as jumping off points toward his own original framework. In his 2005 collection of essays, entitled What Do Pictures Want? he interrogates the power of images to bring out in us what we might think of as the “exorcist” and “adoricist” reactions described by Luc de Heusch (1971) for possession practices in Africa.7 Mitchell asks about the source of the “surplus value of images,” ﬁrst\n\nCompeting Cosmopolitanisms / 9\n\nby asking how techniques such as cloning destabilize our notions about “the thing itself” (and consequently, as if in mirror image, any simple notions of the relationship between the thing and its image). Secondly, he asks about the interrelationships of those aura-laden images, the totem, the idol, and the fetish. He quotes Lévi-Strauss quoting McLennan, “fetishism is totemism minus exogamy and matrilineal descent”(2005, 99)—an absurd equation that nonetheless insightfully points to the place where Marx’s preoccupation with use and exchange values crosses Durkheim’s distinction between mechanical and organic solidarities.8 For them, as for Freud, what distinguishes the fetish is its lack of social usefulness.9 For Mitchell, ever interested in iconoclasm, this is what distinguishes the “iconoclastic hostility” trained on the fetish from the “curatorial solicitude” aimed at the totem (100). He writes that there are four ways of relating to a libidinal object: love, desire, friendship, and jouissance: What happens to the four ways of relating to a libidinal object when an image or picture is involved? An exact correspondence emerges between these relations and the standard array of sacred icons and iconic practices: love belongs to the idol, desire to the fetish, friendship to the totem, and jouissance to iconoclasm, the shattering or melting of the image. When a picture wants love, or more imperiously, when it demands love, but does not need it or return it, but looms in silence, it becomes and idol. . . . When it asks to be shattered, disﬁgured or dissolved, it enters the sphere of the offending, violent or sacriﬁcial image, the object of iconoclasm, the pictorial counterpart to the death drive, or the ecstatic shattering of the ego associated with the orgasm. When it is the object of ﬁxation, compulsive repetition, the gap between articulated demand and brute need, forever teasing with its fort-da of lack and plenitude, its crossing of drive and desire, it is the fetish. . . . Finally there is friendship . . . and its proper image type, the totem. (Mitchell 2005, 74)\n\nMitchell’s magisterial treatment of the power that images have over us brings together Marxist and Freudian notions of the fetish, the anthropological and Freudian notions of the totem, and an intellectual history of iconoclasm. He imposes order on our hunches about the work of iconoclasm. We can only begin to make sense of it by paying close attention to both the implicit theories of society that accompany the classiﬁcation of differing images, and then by paying equally close attention to the affective (even libidinal) economies that overlay these same theories.\n\n10 / Chapter One\n\nBruno Latour’s writings supplement Mitchell’s formulations in several ways. He has insightfully stated about the religious fetish or idol: The only one who is projecting feelings onto the idol is the iconoclast with a hammer, not those who should be freed, by his gesture, from their shackles. The only one who believes is him, the ﬁghter against all beliefs. . . . Belief, naïve belief, might be the way for the iconoclast to enter into contact, violent contact, with the others. It is not a state of mind, not a way to grasp statements, but a mode of relations. (1997, 67)\n\nAs Latour rightly notes, there is something about this iconoclastic posture, both accusatory and slightly desperate for making contact, that seems to characterize young men. In this desire to instantiate a mode of relations, iconoclasm seems to serve almost the same purpose for citizens of the new postcolonial cosmopolis as the incest prohibition serves for isolated corporate communities as described by Lévi-Strauss (1969). It is a prohibition that prescribes other forms of contact, exchange, and sociality. And indeed, if we look at the personnel involved in most iconoclastic undertakings, we ﬁnd that they are overwhelmingly young men. Latour underlines “the extravagant belief that the iconoclast wishes to impute to them [the would-be naïve believers],” as well as insisting on iconoclasm’s modernist ﬂavor. The iconoclast thus transubstantiates the fetish. However, by accusing those who use the fetish of belief (in his view, naïve belief), he in fact attributes to it powers that it may never have had in the eyes of its actual users. At the least, the iconoclast mistakes a metaphor for the thing itself. In this context the iconoclasts10 bring a zeal and a naïve sincerity to their own practice that they project onto those they ﬁgure as “behind,” “backwards,” and “fetishistic.” We are, I hope, fumbling toward the beginnings of an answer to the ﬁrst question, which was why images have the power to provoke humans in the way they have done for millennia. Less well understood, I think, is the answer to my second question, why the knowledge of an image rarely if ever seen by the iconoclast would provoke the iconoclastic reaction. In Guinea, the foci of iconoclastic attention were not golden calves, but objects (masks, ﬁgurines, staffs of ofﬁce) used only by initiates in settings spatially and temporally removed from the sight even of members of the same village of the opposite gender or too young to be initiated, let alone the wider national population. Here we should perhaps talk about the image of the offending image. Michael Taussig (1999) has drawn our attention to the political potency of secrecy and the ways in which it draws defacing reac-\n\nCompeting Cosmopolitanisms / 11\n\ntions similar to iconoclasm. He has also noted the perverse effect of iconoclasm in such settings, namely the “awkwardness to iconoclasm, paradoxically privileging its target by virtue of ridicule” (1999, 27). Is it correct to say that such objects provoked via their role as parts of an “open secret”? As an alternative system of meaning-making and of political sovereignty? Yes, certainly.11 But I don’t think this can account fully for some of the ardor with which iconoclasm in Guinea, or many other places, has been undertaken. To begin to answer my third question, why does iconoclasm provoke such strong emotional reactions, we need to dig deeper into this rich vein of self-contradictory material. I propose that we take a brief detour, namely to consider Freud’s notion of the uncanny. In his essay “The ‘Uncanny,’” Freud begins by giving us the etymology of the German word “heimlich” which, although it has come to mean “homely,” has a history of two uses: “on the one hand it means what is familiar and agreeable, and on the other, what is concealed and kept out of sight.” He continues, linking the uncanny to the compulsion to repeat, and arguing, “every affect belonging to an emotional impulse, whatever its kind, is transformed, if it is repressed, into anxiety” ([1917] 1995, 143). He further describes the play of “irrational” beliefs, such as those characterizing what he calls animism. The uncertainty about whether we have really surmounted our ancestors’ backward beliefs, and the struggle to repress our animist past, result in anxiety. They also cause the uncanny feeling we have when such repressed beliefs return to consciousness. “Unheimlich is the name for everything that ought to have remained . . . secret and hidden but has come to light” (125). Thus, “the animistic beliefs of civilized people” (142) always risk rising back up to the surface. This, I think, gives us a new vantage point on the vignette of the Loma and the Manya elders. It helps to explain how the concerns of a modernizing state might coincide with the concerns of some of its citizens, including those with a shallow monotheistic pedigree who nonetheless wanted to lay claim to the respect, prestige, and dignity that had come to accompany forms of religious piety that were valorized locally, nationally, and globally. Taken together, Freud’s insights about the uncanny, Latour’s about the iconoclast, and Mitchell’s about the anxiety created by what he calls the “surplus value of images” suggest that the iconoclast is, as often as not, trying to purge some uncanny impurity from himself, even though the drama may be played out in the sacred groves or places of worship of others. I should be clear here in stating that the analysis in this book is not psychoanalytic, and the reader will be hard pressed to ﬁnd Freud mentioned in the remaining pages. The dynamic identiﬁed by Freud as the religious\n\n12 / Chapter One\n\nelement of the uncanny is largely the same one Donald Donham (1999) describes as Ethiopian modernists’ desire to “cut history off at the pass.” Donham’s analysis of the 1975 Ethiopian revolution makes no mention of Freud and I could easily do the same here. However, one advantage I see in at least invoking Freud is the fact that it emphasizes that the anxieties about civilization, progress, and modernity that Marxists and zealous converts to world religions in Guinea or Ethiopia experienced are nearly identical to those of the twentieth-century European bourgeois Freud described. Indeed, what is striking to me in looking at the Demystiﬁcation Program in comparative perspective is that it shares so many elements of an enactment we might ﬁnd on most any continent where those most invested in the project of modernity invariably fear that “we have never been modern” (Latour 1993; cf. Wald 1995) Elements of the bedrock modernist faith that underpins Marxism and of the residues of colonial racism bring modernist anxiety into relief in settings like newly independent Guinea, but they might easily be found many other places too.\n\nJouissance and the Search for Purity Still, I don’t think we can be satisﬁed with an explanation that simply ends with the pat statement—it’s all a matter of projection. Recent converts, like new nations and their civil servants, may have some characteristic forms of anxiety that borrow from and improvise out of the grammar of the already anxious undertakings of colonization and proselytization. Yet I am not satisﬁed with an argument that stops here, and not only because of reservations about the applicability of some of these categories of analysis in West African settings.12 The point I want to return to is that the particular fantasy structure of iconoclasm is linked to the uncanny sense of matter out of place, but matter that is too intimately connected to oneself to be simply brushed aside. As Arjun Appadurai has noted in his Fear of Small Numbers (2006), it is precisely in those instances where there is a high level of intimacy, of intermarriage, of physical, emotional, and cultural proximity, that rejection is most likely—not least—to turn toward a logic of extirpation. In another context (Côte d’Ivoire), I have explained the fantasy of xenophobic politics by looking at the ways that charismatic religious ﬁgures link Christian prophetic rhetoric to the politics of autochthony (McGovern 2011). As Geschiere (2009) has described, autochthony is an ideology of nativeness that has been invoked from ancient Greece to contemporary Europe, Africa, and North America in order to justify the partition\n\nCompeting Cosmopolitanisms / 13\n\nof political rights. Autochthonous “owners of the land” claim the right to exercise political preeminence and to limit or deny political rights to newcomers. The fact that many autochthones or their ancestors were themselves once newcomers rarely undercuts the conﬁdence with which they wield autochthonous rhetoric. Like Guinean iconoclasm, this imaginary solution of sending everyone back to their “proper” places participates in a similar logic of extirpating that which is uncannily internal to the individual or the community, yet which no longer squares with the individual’s/ community’s sense of itself. It is not incidental that most of the charismatic movements in Côte d’Ivoire were also preoccupied with eliminating witchcraft, that most uncanny instance of “matter out of place.” Although Loma speakers have no belief in witchcraft and grant sorcery only very limited importance,13 many other Guineans do have highly developed notions about witchcraft and sorcery, and these have sometimes been attributed to the activities of the power associations. The other thing that links iconoclasm and xenophobic politics is that in the exterminating violence that accompanies these moves toward selfmastery, ownership, and puriﬁcation, there is often a perverse joy involved—jouissance (Barthes 1973) is probably the most apt term. We have already touched on some of the reasons why recent converts to monotheism could feel a degree of anxiety about the polytheistic residue that might indeed have been a part of their own biography. This is, as it were, the itch. Yet we are left with the question of why it feels so satisfying to scratch that itch. This question becomes more pressing when we consider the ferocity, the frenzy, and the compulsiveness that accompany so many iconoclastic undertakings around the world. This may help to explain why Guinean Demystiﬁcation began anew year after year, announcing itself as a success, then returning again to start the unﬁnished work over. In chapter 5, I describe how the Demystiﬁcation Program built upon a preexisting idiom of destruction of “idols” as a central step in the conversion to world religions. This precedent combined with Marxist idioms of unmasking the ideological supports of unjust economic relations, and of leveling economic disparities (cf. Fitzpatrick 2005). In chapters 6, 7, and 8, I discuss how Demystiﬁcation also bridged the distance between Marxism and Pan-Africanism by simultaneously outlawing and folklorizing the same objects, and then exporting this authentic (but surpassed) chapter of Guinea’s history via the world-renowned dance troupe, Les Ballets Africains. This allowed Guinean modernists to purge the uncanny traces of the past. At the same time it signaled to both the “backward” periphery and the general population the outlines of the banned cultural content and what was\n\n14 / Chapter One\n\nat stake through a kind of Brechtian “V-effekt” that re-presented the primitive past as theater.14\n\nEthnogenesis: Two or Three Things I Know about It So far, I have discussed the analysis put forward in the second half of the book—in chapters 6 through 9. The ﬁrst half of this book takes ﬁne-grained ethnographic and historical materials to show how the modern conception of ethnicity came into being in postcolonial Guinea. I focus speciﬁcally on Macenta Préfecture, which is home to a Loma-speaking majority and a minority that speaks Mandekan (Greenberg 1955). Loma speakers, like other speakers of Southwestern Mande languages, are known for their Poro men’s and Sande women’s power associations, more commonly called secret societies. In the forest region of Guinea, most of Liberia, and most of Sierra Leone, all boys are initiated into the Poro society and all girls into the Sande society. These are classic “rites de passage” (van Gennep [1960] 1980), bringing the initiate into adulthood after a period of seclusion in a sacred grove located in the forest near the village where non-initiates and all members of the opposite gender are prohibited. They are also the ﬁrst of a series of interconnected societies, each controlling different powers such as the ability to treat snake bites, to help infertile women conceive a child, or to control lightning. I call all of these institutions power associations rather than secret societies in this book, as I think that more accurately describes their most salient characteristic. I explain Loma categories for understanding personhood and power, built around the potentially dangerous life force known as manye, which is channeled and controlled through the use of sale, a term that can mean medicine, talisman, or mask, and the power associations that control knowledge of particular forms of sale within a system of cultivated discretion. Each of these categories has its analogue among the Northern Mande languages, which I group together as Mandekan in this book. Potentially dangerous life force is called nyama, powerful medicine or objects are called basi or daliluw, and the analogues of the Southwestern Mande Poro society are the Northern Mande Komo, Jo, and Kore societies. Despite, or perhaps because of these similarities, speakers of the Northern and Southwestern Mande languages have come to think of themselves as fundamentally different from one another. It is this process of separation, hardening, and distanciation that I refer to as ethnogenesis. This process of ethnogenesis was both a cause and a result of the iconoclastic movement I describe in the second half of the book. I argue, how-\n\nCompeting Cosmopolitanisms / 15\n\never, that it is impossible to understand how and why the Demystiﬁcation Program took place as it did unless we understand the details of rural swidden (slash-and-burn) rice farmers’ lives. Consequently, the ﬁrst half of the book consists of classical ethnography that describes rural agricultural sociology, the forms of ritual and kinship relations that constitute localized political power and legitimacy, and the moyenne durée history of population movements. At each step of the way, however, I analyze the way these practices were not timeless custom but were in fact interacting with a series of polities that aimed to encompass them, from precolonial Muslim empires to the French colonial state to the socialist state of Sékou Touré’s Parti Démocratique de Guinée (hereafter PDG). My argument is inspired by some of the best ethnographic works on the region, including those by Berliner (2005, 2007, 2010), Sarró (2009, 2010) and Højbjerg (2007, 2010). Sarró (2010) crystallizes this line of argument in his wonderful essay, “Map and Territory: The Politics of Place and Autochthony among Baga Sitem (and their Neighbours).” He describes the ways that villagers operating according to the old “rules” that privileged ethnic ambiguity and ﬂuidity but maintained strict hierarchical political relations between early settlers of a territory and relative newcomers found themselves surprised by a new set of rules. Changes to the law under colonial and especially postcolonial governments privileged new kinds of relations to land, and often rewarded those who entrepreneurially moved into fertile zones to cultivate cash crops or to do other forms of work (commerce, transport, cutting and selling timber) that were part of the cash economy. Under such pressures, also described by Geschiere (2009) and Geschiere and Nyamanjoh (2000) in other settings, the logics of authochthony and ethnicized territory suddenly became attractive or even a matter of survival from the point of view of beleaguered “owners of the land.” As one man said to Sarró (2010, 243), “the problem was that they, the Baga landlords, had been too generous: they had given land and shelter to too many strangers and now the strangers thought that they could ‘stand up’ instead of ‘remaining seated.’” Berliner’s and Højbjerg’s essays in the same volume (2010) clarify further how the recognition of the inherently creole origins of maroon societies can sometimes serve as the springboard of nativist discourses of identity when those same groups see themselves as threatened by an outside group. The core of this story is one of ﬂuid ethnolinguistic distinctions that became hardened, of contemporary social and political divisions cast backward in historical time and narrated as age-old incommensurable differences. This is a story that also has a great deal in common with the analysis of\n\n16 / Chapter One\n\nZomia in Southeast Asia put forward by James Scott (2009). When writing my Ph.D. dissertation on this topic, I had already been greatly impressed by the ways that Edmund Leach’s (1954) analysis of Kachin and Shan relations in highland Burma resembled much of what I had seen and heard in Guinea’s southeastern rainforest corner. Like highland Burma, this is an area where kinship, marriage alliance, and political hierarchy are all connected to one another. Wife-givers are preeminent, and wife-receivers are supposed to be their political clients. At the same time, such hierarchies are crosscut by various forms of reciprocity as well as by the attempts by subalterns to improve their stations, whether by ruse or by force. What I had not realized until Scott’s The Art of Not Being Governed: An Anarchist History of Upland Southeast Asia (2009) was published was that the resemblances went much deeper than “mere” structures of kinship and marriage alliance. The deeper kinship between the West African rainforest region and the Southeast Asian highlands that Scott (after van Schendel) calls Zomia is one of maroon societies. In both cases, these multiethnic, polyglot societies held themselves together on the one hand by sometimes effective, sometimes not so effective norms of kinship and marriage relations. Beyond that, they are societies formed out of a commitment to carving tiny islands of autonomy out of an encompassing environment of violence and depredation.15 The product of some ﬁve hundred years of depopulation and destabilization as the result of the intervillage warfare spurred and encouraged by the Atlantic slave trade, the towns and micro-chiefdoms of the area that became Macenta Préfecture were typically comprised of a mixture of a successful war chief and some fearless young men, a large number of refugees of various ethnolinguistic origins, captives, and a few traders. These traders had usually negotiated the protection necessary to ply their wares along the dangerous bush paths that linked fortiﬁed towns, often built at the top of hills and surrounded by rampart walls whose remnants can still be seen in the area (Person 1968). The founder’s cults found in Southeast Asia (Tannenbaum and Kammerer 2003) are similar to the complex of village settlement and strategic sacriﬁce described in chapter 3. Similarly, though written in parallel, my account of agricultural practice, state intervention, and ethnogenesis is remarkably similar to that described by Scott for highland Southeast Asia (2009). Indeed, it would be accurate and fair to the ethnographic particularities of the West African forest–savanna frontier zone I describe to call it a West African Zomia.16 It is in this context that a politics and aesthetics of discretion have become central to the institutional life of the societies of this rainforest belt.\n\nCompeting Cosmopolitanisms / 17\n\nAs many others (d’Azevedo 1962b; Bellman 1984; Ferme 2001; Murphy 1980, 1981) have also argued, the ownership and management of knowledge, and the ability to remain discreet in disbursing it, are central preoccupations of people in Loma and neighboring Kpelle, Mande, Gola, and other societies in this region. What I call “discretion” has more often been termed “secrecy.” I ﬁnd the latter term misleading, both because the rules of discretion are often applied with equal strictness to knowledge and comportments that are not at all secret, and at the same time to other elements of social and political life at the village level that are, at most, open secrets. I describe and analyze this politics and aesthetics of discretion at greater length elsewhere (McGovern 2004), and in summary form in chapter 8. The intersection of political, philosophical, and aesthetic concerns around this complex of discretion/secrecy has attracted not only the attention of states that have tended to treat “secret societies” they did not control as an a priori threat, but also the attention of more philosophically oriented anthropologists. Building upon the superb regional ethnography of secrecy mentioned above, some of my close colleagues (Berliner 2002, 2005, 2007; Højbjerg 2002a, 2002b, 2007), like some anthropologists working elsewhere (Whitehouse 2000, 2002) have developed sophisticated analyses of the cognitive aspects of religious reﬂexivity and transmission. I do not take up that line of argument here, partly because they have done such a thorough job of it, but also because my own interests are somewhat different. The attempts by the Guinean state to destroy Loma speakers’ ritual objects and perhaps by proxy to eliminate the parallel system of religious-political secrecy and autonomy are one instance of a wider phenomenon that is my core interest. That is, how do the agents representing states, and especially socialist states, work to constitute that state’s legitimacy and effective rule? And how do the putative targets of this rule react to these attempts? For understanding this, I ﬁnd that it is especially fruitful to work “from the margins of the state” (Das and Poole 2004), where effective rule is most fragile and where coercive attempts to impose state law tend to erode the state’s legitimacy. Many Loma speakers ﬂed for long or short periods of time into Liberia, where the other half of the Loma-speaking population lives and where they were free to pursue their religious lives as they pleased.17 At that level, it is not surprising that the practices of the Poro and Sande societies continued after the twenty-six-year ban was lifted. What interests me more is the way that the power associations, already centuries old at the time of Guinean independence, became subjects of state rhetoric and policy. This policy operated in such a way that the rhetorical and indeed dramaturgical construction of secrecy (and its unmasking) became\n\n18 / Chapter One\n\na central trope of the state’s self-deﬁnition. At the same time, it caused Loma speakers to qualitatively change their own politico-religious practices, sometimes transforming discretion into true secrecy, as when whole villages sent their ready-to-be-initiated young men or women across the border in the middle of the night to simply become adults in the “normal” Loma way. Secrecy exercises a complex epistemological and ethical sway in descriptions such as this one, that deal with information that may be subject to laws of “that which must not be spoken.” This is one reason why I do not write much of what I know about how certain events took place at the village level, but try in almost all cases to draw my own descriptions of Demystiﬁcation from what is already available in the public record.18 I can say that whatever I have included here also squares with what I understand to be accurate on the basis of my participant observation research. The state interventions epitomized by the Demystiﬁcation Program were thus an important part of the process of reshaping and hardening ethnic identities that have come to seem self-evident. The West Africa literature also throws up many comparable examples to show that the ways that polytheistic and polyglot groupings of mostly Mande people became “Loma” or “Manya” is not an isolated dynamic. Jean-Loup Amselle’s 1990 Logiques métisses is the best known of these works. Amselle dissects the seemingly self-evident and quite different ethnic categories of Fulbe and Bamana in order to show us how, in the areas of Mali, Guinea, and Côte d’Ivoire where he works, people have frequently jumped over the line separating one ethnic group from another. Sometimes these switches had to do with religious practice, sometimes with livelihoods, other times with migration; but in every case, the elaborate tango of mutual constitution and distinction from an intimate other is central to the dynamic. Other works, including Furth (2005) and van Bruijn and van Dijk (1997) specify the related dynamics from within the seemingly monolithic ethnic bloc of “The Fulbe.” Because of their longstanding experience of outside interference and pillage, the people in area I write about were and remain profoundly skeptical of claims by encompassing states that they could or would do anything beneﬁcial for them. The armies of the nineteenth-century Muslim empirebuilder Samory Touré had pillaged and enslaved them as other warlords had done before. The French who followed ﬁrst conquered the region by force, then extracted corvée labor, and expropriated women, grain, and livestock according to their whims. When the socialist government also expropriated farmers’ crops to feed people in the towns, forced families to\n\nCompeting Cosmopolitanisms / 19\n\nrelinquish their teenagers to participate in cultural festivals, and banned the very initiations and masquerades that the youngsters were forced to perform as folklore, people in Macenta and the surrounding area (known as La Région forestière, its inhabitants known as Forestiers) were not much surprised.19 In this context, as in the Southeast Asian one described by Leach (1954) and Scott (1998, 2009), there has been a tension between the usefulness of negotiable identities and those that claim to be historically deeper and more legitimate, using the rhetoric of modernist states and world religions. The vignette of the two elders already tells us something about how formerly ﬂuid identities became increasingly ﬁxed over time in Macenta Préfecture. I want to go beyond that somewhat familiar story of hardening ethnic identities to talk about how this process took place in twentiethcentury Guinea. My claim is that the Demystiﬁcation Program was intimately linked to this process, as both cause and effect of the creation of newly distinct identities out of a formerly shifting set of points on a cultural continuum where people cultivated potential axes of relatedness rather than shutting them down.\n\nIconoclasm and Ethnogenesis in the Context of Competing Cosmopolitanisms The competing cosmopolitan frames provided by Marxist and PanAfricanist ideologies assigned very different values to precolonial African cultures and practices. Pan-Africanism identiﬁed African precolonial cultures as the source of speciﬁcally African genius and particularism, and it insisted that there are African social, political, and economic bases on which to build a distinctive modernity. Scientiﬁc socialism, on the other hand, insisted upon a single path to modernity. Although socialism identiﬁed problems of exploitation within European modernity, it did not hesitate to treat non-European societies with Eurocentric disdain.20 Every non-European Marxist and socialist government had to make its own peace with this contradiction. I argue in this book that in Guinea, the working solution to this problem was to parse the precolonial cultural practices of the people of Guinea into those that could be deemed wholesome and those that were identiﬁed as noxious. The experience of conversion to world religions, very recent for some Guineans, provided a template for this process of sorting, validating, and erasing. In this way, iconoclasm can be understood as making a claim for equal membership in a world of nations. Newly independent countries like\n\n20 / Chapter One\n\nGuinea knew themselves to be denigrated by others, including the erstwhile colonizers. Iconoclasm provided a solution to the desire to eradicate the embarrassing residue of premodern backwardness from the body politic. Sékou Touré made frequent calls for Guineans to “come back to themselves,” to reclaim an authentic precolonial self that had been terribly deformed by the experience of colonialism. Despite this he partook in the often anxious undertaking of eliminating embarrassing traces of precolonial backwardness. Those who practiced African religions in Guinea were not embarrassed by their alleged barbarity. As Latour would predict, only the modernist iconoclasts seem to have been fully convinced of the peasants’ belief. However, Forestiers did come—and it happened rather quickly— to understand that being a full citizen of the young nation entailed the necessity of being embarrassed by such practices and ﬁnding some cherished or useful objects objectionable. Their practices, experienced imaginatively through the eyes of others, became beliefs.21 This experience of seeing oneself through others’ eyes when those others may themselves experience themselves through the eyes of yet another imagined outside gaze is what I call “double double consciousness.” This term, adapted from DuBois’ discussion in The Souls of Black Folk ([1903] 1994) is one of the foci of the second half of the book.\n\nThe Chapters I imagine three types of readers for this book. One group may be most interested in the kind of rural ethnography that constitutes the ﬁrst half, and which has become increasingly rare in academic anthropology. The second group, more interested in the anthropology of the state and the study of cultural policy, especially those of socialist states, might skip the ﬁrst half of the book and go directly to the second. My ideal reader will read the whole, and I try to make the case that full understanding of either half of the book will come only from understanding how the dynamics described in each half work on one another. For those who may still be unconvinced, I sketch the contents of the remaining chapters here. Part 1: The Grammar and Rhetoric of Identity The next four chapters lay out the building blocks of social and political identities, showing the ways they acted on one another. The last chapter in the section addresses the ways that their articulation also played a central role in shaping the dynamics that culminated in the Demystiﬁcation Proj-\n\nCompeting Cosmopolitanisms / 21\n\nect. These chapters tack between village-level micropolitics and the regional idioms of kinship, autochthony, and clan afﬁliation to show the different ways that people along this section of the West African forest–savanna frontier maintained high levels of social and cultural ﬂexibility that aided them in negotiating situations of endemic insecurity caused by the intervillage raiding spurred by the Atlantic slave trade. By so doing, they help to explain why the politics of ethno-religious identity took the particular twists and turns they did, and how techniques for managing unpredictability and insecurity changed during the colonial and socialist postcolonial periods. These transformations led to a distinctive type of ethnogenesis that was the result of many of the same dynamics that led toward an iconoclastic “solution” to the contradictions rising out of these changes. By doing this, these chapters set the scene for understanding the Demystiﬁcation Program, the focus of part 2. Chapter 2 introduces the grammar of micropolitics within this portion of the Upper Guinea Coast and describes the ways in which recurrent population movements characterized the region in the nineteenth century. Drawing on the work of Bledsoe, d’Azevedo, Jackson, Kopytoff, and Murphy, as well as my own ﬁeldwork, the chapter shows how ethnic identity was ﬂuid and negotiable through the idiom of totemic clans common to multiple ethno-linguistic groups. The chapter also introduces the principle of autochthony as the ultimate basis of political legitimacy, showing how it, too, was often renegotiated through the establishment of ﬁctive kinship relations and rewritten genealogies. The picture that emerges is one of considerable movement, ﬂuidity, and negotiability that continued through much of the twentieth century, as individuals and whole villages remained mobile, ﬂeeing ﬁrst colonial forced labor and taxes and later the domination of the socialist state. Chapter 3 explains two institutions that underlie Loma conceptions of socio-political legitimacy: autochthony and the relationship between mother’s brothers and sister’s sons. Loma villages and all the land within them are understood to belong to the descendents of the village’s ﬁrst settler, often ﬁgured as a hunter who found a good place to live while hunting in the bush. This village founder enters into a relationship with the area’s earth and water spirits (inegiti), from whom he receives permission to settle in the area. All subsequent settlers borrow land from him, just as he borrowed it from the earth spirits. The relationship between this ﬁrst settler and the second man who joins him in the village is ﬁgured as one between a wife-giving mother’s brother (k ek e) and a wife-receiving sister’s son (daabe). While the autochthonous uncle enjoys political preeminence\n\n22 / Chapter One\n\nand can in principle revoke rights to the land he has lent, he is beholden to his nephew, who performs sacriﬁces on his behalf to the earth spirits. All subsequent arrivals in the village enter into a keke–daabe relationship with a resident host with whom they enter into a reciprocal relation. Political legitimacy and hierarchy are thus enacted on a quotidian basis by the performance of sacriﬁces of one individual or group for another. Such ancestral sacriﬁce both renews the relations among the living, the ancestors, and the earth and water spirits at the same time that they perform the hierarchical relationship between ﬁrst (or earlier) settlers and their later arriving clients, nephews, and sacriﬁcers. Chapter 4 describes the process that began shutting down the possibilities for renegotiating one’s identity under adverse circumstances in the area that became Guinea’s forest region. First, competition for colonial-era chieftaincies between 1918 and 1925 led the rather bewildered French authorities to split chieftaincies into halves “belonging” to the two language groups resident in the area, Loma and Manya. This novel basis of political legitimacy was ampliﬁed by the socialist government, which introduced land tenure laws granting durable rights to anyone—including migrating “strangers”—who put land to uses the government deemed rational. While the politics of land tenure and chieftaincy began hardening identities around claims to land ownership or legitimate authority, a second factor, conversion to Islam or Christianity, operated to further ﬁx once-ﬂuid identities in place. To become Muslim was to be ethnically Manya, just as to become Christian or continue to practice Forestier religion was to be Loma. While the French introduced Roman Catholic proselytisation to Guinea, they also granted Muslims a signiﬁcantly higher “civilizational” status than polytheists. This bias was continued and extended by the Touré government after independence, and Demystiﬁcation was the primary vehicle for forcing Guineans to choose a world religion. Chapter 5 explores the search for and mobilization of a usable past in the construction of a postcolonial Guinean nation that had inherited arbitrary colonial boundaries. It explores both the content of the new statesponsored history, narrated as if the unfolding of the present were presaged by past glory, and also its form. Analyzing the institutions and practices of history-making along the forest–savanna frontier, I argue that the form as much as the content of historical narration determines its political uses and potentialities. The chapter also analyzes several iconoclastic movements that took place in Guinea in the late precolonial and the colonial periods, which served as precedents to the later Demystiﬁcation Program. This chapter forms the bridge between the chapters of part 1, which show\n\nCompeting Cosmopolitanisms / 23\n\nthe process of ethnogenesis taking place within a variety of encompassing state settings, and those of part 2, which emphasize the process of nationbuilding, with the dynamics of ethnogenesis moving to the background. Part II: Revealing and Reshaping the Body Politic The chapters in part 2 focus on the Demystiﬁcation Program and the individuals who undertook Demystiﬁcation and related policies of the socialist state. While the chapters in part 1 set the scene for understanding the micropolitical dynamics into which Demystiﬁcation intruded, the second half of the book explores questions surrounding the work that Sékou Touré and his civil servants saw themselves doing in the social, cultural, and political ﬁelds. This was a project of full-blown social engineering, and these chapters show many of the potentialities and perils of such an ambitious undertaking. Chapter 6 begins with a consideration of Marcel Mauss’s essay, “A Category of the Human Mind: The Notion of Person, the Notion of Self” (1985), in which Mauss sketches a history of the person. It is notable that the Latin persona denoted a “mask.” The chapter considers the relations between persons and objects and the ways they have been considered politically problematic in a variety of historical settings, often leading to iconoclastic attempts to purge these offending elements. The chapter explores the crucial role played in Demystiﬁcation by Forestier modernists—the teachers, administrative cadres, and self-consciously modernist youth from the forest region who aided in attempts to eradicate what they considered nefarious and backward practices in their own towns and villages. Chapter 7 places the Guinean Demystiﬁcation Program within the broader cultural and political context of an ambitious modernist state’s attempts to effect radical social change. It shows how the state’s formulation of proper political participation was far-reaching and in many ways classically modernist. This chapter looks at the government’s legal and administrative attempts to radically alter gender relations in marriage, school, and the workplace, its work at policing public morals, and its attempts to turn agricultural practices on their heads. Enlarging on the interrelation between nation-building and ethnogenesis, it shows how several of the state’s social engineering projects played out within a rhetoric of ethnic distinction. While Demystiﬁcation was aimed overwhelmingly at the nation’s “backward” Forestier polytheists, attempts to eradicate distinctions between noble and servile descent took place in a context of the government’s attempts to undercut the legitimacy of the ethnic Fulbe (Fulani) nobility.\n\n24 / Chapter One\n\nChapter 8 enters the second half of the central paradox of Demystiﬁcation by exploring the instantaneous folklorization of the very practices that had just been outlawed. I begin by tracing the meanings and uses of discretion by Loma speakers. I argue for an understanding of discretion as a key technique for managing political and ontological insecurity, rather than the fetishization of secrecy it has usually been misunderstood as being. Having shown how systematically Loma-speaking adults work to shape children and adolescents into discreet individuals, I hope to show the reasons why Demystiﬁcation was so troubling to Guinea’s Forestiers, even if their consternation was not exactly that of people whose secrecy had been shattered. Next, drawing on interviews, and photographic and textual documentation, the chapter describes the Guinean state’s construction of one of the most inﬂuential and far-reaching “culture industries” on the African continent. Having created Les Ballets Africains, the national folkloric troupe that was many Europeans’ and North Americans’ introduction to African dance and music, the Guinean state underwrote a series of other professional musical and dance troupes, acting as patron to such famous musicians as Bembeya Jazz and Salif Keita. The ambivalence felt by many Guinean families toward this culture industry was even more pronounced in the forest region, on whose (outlawed) traditions many of the performances were based. Forestiers thus found themselves as simultaneous objects of derision and fascination, and cast as the foils in a kind of national morality play. Despite the negative stereotypes that were thus elevated from interregional prejudice to national cultural policy, many Guinean Forestiers found themselves interpellated (Althusser 1971) by this modernist ideology in complex ways. I return to the issue of discretion in analyzing the “sociology of ambition” in revolutionary Guinea, and show how Forestier intellectuals may have fared better than any other group during the socialist period, despite the abuse they sometimes endured. Their ability to keep a low proﬁle may have been instrumental to their ability to rise within the system of socialist cadres without drawing the unwanted attention that sent so many of their colleagues from other parts of Guinea into exile or to their deaths in Camp Boiro. Starting from DuBois’s concept of double consciousness—“this sense of always looking at one’s self through the eyes of others”—the Conclusion returns to the mutual constitution of the Loma “people” and the Guinean state, and Loma speakers as both members of a newly hardened ethnic group and as citizens of a proudly independent nation. Loma speakers thus understood and understand themselves as the “others’ others,” a group whose objectiﬁcation as primitive was a necessary foil to creating\n\nCompeting Cosmopolitanisms / 25\n\nmodern Guinean national identity, even while that nation was itself considered “second class” by many non-Africans. They are thus extremely well placed to critique the symbolic as well as the physical violence involved in making modern Guineans, at the same time that they derive considerable pride from their Guinean identity. I draw on my ﬁeldwork to show how ﬁnely drawn this double-sided experience became under the circumstances of the Liberian war, when Liberians of Loma, Kpelle, and other Forestier ethno-linguistic groups came over the border, and proved to be at least as different from Guinean Forestiers as Guineans from other ethno-linguistic backgrounds. Looking at Guinea’s success in navigating the civil wars of the 1990s without getting drawn in, I suggest that the productive tension between national and ethnolinguistic identity was one of the factors that helped Guinea to avoid civil war.\n\nT WO\n\nThe Tactics of Mutable Identity\n\nCan one know more or less precisely where the different people of the forest region of Upper Guinea and the surrounding regions come from? Posed in this way, the question remains dubious: in effect, to ask where the Kpelle, Kono, Mano, Loma, Kissi, Lele, Dan, etc. used to be means that one considers them as having existed in their present form if not since time immemorial then at least since some long-ago epoch. In fact, the populations that we studied in 1946–47 were simply the result of a mixing together of people, either in their present locations or in other regions from which a migration brought them into the forest region, pushing others ahead of them in part, and mixing together with them in an equal part. (Germain 1984, 19)1\n\nChapter 1 argued that iconoclasm can be understood as making a claim for equal membership in a world of nations in a context where newly independent countries like Guinea knew themselves to be denigrated by others, including the people of the erstwhile colonizing countries. It was thus part of a process of enacting and embodying nationhood that prompted selection from a relatively ﬁxed menu of choices: Modern nations have passports, ﬂags, national anthems, stamps, and currency; they claim seats at the United Nations and other international organizations; and they aspire to send teams to the Olympics or the World Cup. This chapter and the next address the ways that ethnogenesis—the coming into being of qualitatively new ethnic identities—became a process that was intimately linked to the other aspects of Guinea’s colonial and postcolonial nation building. The substantive focus of this part of the book is the play between ethnic assimilation and differentiation on the part of Loma and Manya speakers in the area that has become Macenta Préfecture. While both groups now present their ethnic, linguistic, and religious differences as primordial,\n\n28 / Chapter Two\n\nthis interpretation of history is not supported by the facts. As late as 1945, there is documentary evidence that both Loma speakers and the peripheral Mandekan speakers2 living among and next to them shared largely interchangeable polytheistic ritual and cultural lives. On the linguistic front, it is clear that in the period since c. 1500, when Loma- and Manya-speaking populations were in or near their present locations, the Northern and Southwestern Mande languages had already separated. We can thus talk about populations with many shared cultural traits yet speaking distinct languages. What is equally clear is that in the context of persistent slave raiding (as late as 1906) and the major population movements it occasioned, there was considerable intermingling amongst these language groups, and in the contact zones (e.g., Macenta), most people were probably multilingual, as they are today.3 With a similar ritual/religious life but different languages, we can see how the question of ethnic distinction might become a preoccupation for Loma speakers, Manya speakers, and the states that governed them. I address the issue in this chapter with some detailed analysis of the settlement history of Macenta Préfecture and parts of Lofa County, in the context of previous historical work on migrations and settlement histories of the wider region. I argue that by using the institutions of translatable clan names and power association membership, (proto) Loma and Manya speakers were able to switch ethnic identities, a hypothesis supported by the fact that such dynamics still operate today. The question remains why the narrative of primordial difference is so appealing to most members of both language groups today if it is true that there has been so much intermingling. The answer to this question is complex and is intimately linked to the dynamics that occasioned Demystiﬁcation in Guinea. The process of amplifying differences allowed peripheral Mandekan speakers living in the forest–savanna frontier region to pretend to a heritage and a history of Islamic practice that were ﬁctional but which nonetheless carried great prestige in Guinea in the 1960s and 1970s. Conversely, it offered Loma speakers undisputed title to the privileges accruing (in principle) to ﬁrst-settling landowners. Such claims, however, did not always bring the expected beneﬁts. Peripheral Mande are still treated like second-class citizens in subtle ways by Maninka from such historical centers of Islamic learning as Kankan,4 and Loma speakers found that the inalienable political and land tenure rights that should have been attached to autochthonous identities were often disregarded by the socialist state. These frustrations did not cause Loma and Manya speakers in Macenta Préfecture to drop their identitarian claims, but rather added an element of\n\nThe Tactics of Mutable Identity / 29\n\nbitter stridency to them. Especially from the 1990s onward, these claims of identity have been used to justify a series of increasingly violent attempts at asserting political dominance. This tendency, which includes one largescale massacre and numerous smaller ones in the region, has been intimately linked to the violence of the Liberian war, and especially the ﬁghting in Lofa County, where the war took on an ethnicized slant,5 and where even during times of peace, villages have undertaken ethnic cleansing. As I argue later in the chapter, both West African and foreign scholars have often operated according to an implicit model of enduring ethnolinguistic difference that I characterize as the “oil-and-water thesis.” The assumptions of this model are that contemporary ethno-linguistic groups map onto what we imagine to have been similarly differentiated groups in the past. As Germain (an exception to this tendency) argues in the epigraph to this chapter, much of the scholarship on the region implies that scholars “consider [contemporary ethnic groups] as having existed in their present form if not since time immemorial then at least since some longago epoch” (1984, 19). Thus groups such as “the Loma” are imagined to be invaded, penetrated, or inﬁltrated by “the Malinke.”6 This ﬁts well with the embattled politics of identity currently in play.7 However, I argue throughout this chapter that the historical materials (scattered as they are) do not support this thesis. Because of the ways that interethnic difference is now invoked in a context of land disputes, planned ethnic cleansing, and intermittent clashes, the subject has pressing contemporary signiﬁcance. This argument is not novel in the context of anthropological studies of ethnicity. From Fredrik Barth’s 1969 collection of essays on ethnicity onward, most anthropologists and many historians have characterized ethnicity as a kind of social process. While most have moved away from a focus on the content of ethnic ideologies and toward process, scholars like Barth (1969) and Mafeje (1971) have also been criticized for taking an overly instrumentalist approach, as if ethnicity were nothing more than a strategy for accumulation, covered by a veneer of false consciousness. As scholars of East Africa have argued, ethnicity is a complex interaction of factors: ecological, economic, cultural, aesthetic, rhetorical, and political (Galaty 1982, 1993; Klumpp and Kratz 1993; Parkin 1978, 1991; Southall 1956, 1970; Spear and Waller 1993). In his introduction to a collection of essays on Maasai ethnicity, Spear writes: However derived, ethnicity remains a powerful ideology for identity formation and social action. That is precisely why leaders seek to invent and invoke it, and why followers are so often willing to kill and die for it. It is thus im-\n\n30 / Chapter Two portant to understand the power of symbols embedded in myth, language, and social behaviour that sustain social identities, for it is this very power that makes ethnicity so effective once such loyalties are evoked. (1993, 16)\n\nIn this chapter I shall not address the mobilization of symbols and rhetoric to political ends; that is one objective of the second half of the book. However, it is my goal to historicize the interaction of Loma speakers and Manya speakers in such a way that the oil-and-water thesis becomes untenable. In Africanist literature, francophone anthropologists and historians have done much to “deconstruct” the naturalized ethnic differences assumed in the savanna region (Amselle 1990; Amselle and M’Bokolo 1985; Bazin 1985; cf. Chretien and Prunier 1989). In many cases, this work has focused on the shifting boundaries between Fulbe and Northern Mande groups who, like the East African Maa and Bantu groups, are presumed to be nomadic pastoralists and sedentary farmers respectively. As those authors have shown, language, religion, and livelihood have formed shifting constellations over time, and in many cases only began to take on more ﬁxed characteristics in the last century.8 There has been little work of the same kind done for the forest–savanna frontier region, especially where Northern and Southwestern Mande speakers meet. Some of the best scholars working on this area (e.g., d’Azevedo 1994–95; Fairhead and Leach 1996; Jackson 1974; Massing 1978–79, 1985; Person 1968) offer much suggestive material, but few have made a concerted effort to take on the assumptions of both local actors and scholars operating within the oil-and-water idiom.9 In this chapter my brief is to present enough of the history of population movements, chiefdom settlements in the Macenta region, and census materials on ethnolinguistic and religious identity to throw that model into serious doubt. In the second half of the book, I revisit this subject and show how the fragile construction of ethnoreligious identity in this area emerged hand-in-hand with the imposition of state power, and how this relationship spawned undertakings such as the Demystiﬁcation Program. In the context of the precolonial slave-raiding insecurity that characterized the area that became Macenta Préfecture, maintaining small autonomous spaces was essential to the survival of people living along the forest– savanna frontier. This chapter enumerates some of their tactics, including the translation of clan identities and ethnicity. These were part of the repertoire of everyday practices that made up a strategy for creating autonomous spaces. It is important to enter here into some detail about the long-term pop-\n\nThe Tactics of Mutable Identity / 31\n\nulation movements through the region and the settlement history of the area that became Macenta Préfecture. The next section describes the movements of Kamara (Diomande) lineages and other migrants into the forest region. Rather than remaining “Malinke” (the umbrella term the French colonizers used to describe all Northern Mande speakers in Guinea), many became Loma over the years.\n\nInsecurity, Migration, and Fluidity of Identities The fact that the Central West Atlantic region experienced several hundred years of persistent insecurity (c. 1500–1900) meant that populations were tremendously mobile. Some moved as refugees, others as soldiers, still others as captives. There were still others who, especially during periods of stability, traveled as traders and Islamic clerics. The history of insecurity in the region is thus intimately tied to the histories of population movements and the interactions of different ethnolinguistic groups. We may look to the linguists to help us explain the degree of relatedness of different languages in the region. In this regard, we are aided by the fact that, excepting the southeastern corner of Liberia, all the African languages spoken in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia belong to one of two groups within the Niger-Congo language family. These are the Mande and the West Atlantic (Greenberg 1963). Each of these may be further split into two main subgroups, the Mande into the Northern and Southwestern groups,10 and the West Atlantic into the Mel subgroup and Pulaar, the only member of the Northern West Atlantic group spoken widely in the threecountry region. Below is a simpliﬁed diagram. Armed with this information, we can take an initial cut through the history of the region. Linguists have attempted to date the split between some of these languages. Welmers (1958) has estimated that the Northern and Southwestern Mande languages separated some 2,500 years ago. At this time, it appears that the entire coastal area of what is now Liberia,11 Sierra Leone, and Guinea was probably sparsely populated by people speaking a proto-Mel language or languages. These, the ancestors of the present-day Gola, Kissi, Sherbro, Temne, Limba, Baga, and Nalou, probably lived in the one- to two-hundred-mile-wide strip along the coast. To the northeast, reaching toward the savanna, were Northern and Southwestern Mande speakers. Further north still were the ancestors of the Fulbe, Wolof, and Serer. Map 2 is a schematic diagram of this state of affairs. These dates are approximate, given current evidence. However, linguists, archaeologists, and historians (Hair 1967; Brooks 1993; Jones 1981;\n\n32 / Chapter Two Table 1. West African languages in Upper Guinea Coast region Mande languages (also includes Soninke) N Mande\n\nSW Mande\n\nSoso (Soussou) Bamanaa (Bambara) Maninka (Malinke) Kuranko Koniyanke Dyula Manya Kono Vai Damac\n\nLoma (Toma) Landogo (Loko) Mende Bandi (Gbande) Kpelle (Guerze)\n\nWest Atlantic languages (also includes Wolof, Serer) Pulaar (Fulani)\n\nMel Kissi Gola Sherbro Temne Bantab Limba Baga Nalou\n\na Bamanakan, Maninkakan, Kurankokan, Koniyankakan, Dyulakan, and Manyakan share over 90 percent lexical similarity (Bird 1970). b A Mel language related to Sherbro and Temne now extinct. Former Banta speakers have mostly adopted Mende (Migeod 1926, 203; Richards personal communication 2002). c A language closely related to Vai and Kono, now extinct. Former speakers of Dama according to Dalby (1963) have mostly adopted Mende.\n\nPerson 1961; Rodney 1970; Welmers 1958) agree on the general outlines of this situation. Over the next 1,500 years (c. 500 BCE–1,000 CE), the Southwestern Mande languages took on separate and distinct forms, as did the various Mel languages. From this point onward, we have a clearer picture of the chronology involved as a result of three sources: Arabic-language chronicles from the Sahelian educational centers such as Timbuktu; oral sources that chronicle the major battles, population movements, and rises and falls of empires in the region; and, as of the late ﬁfteenth century, the writings of Europeans, who were arriving on the coast. As other scholars have analyzed this material, I offer a précis here. Yves Person (1961) argued that the linguistic and archeological evidence suggest that Mande speakers moved southwestward in the thirteenth to the eighteenth centuries. Certainly we know that with the defeat of Soumaoro Kanté, leader of the Soso, by Sundiata Keita, leader of the Maninka, in 1235, the Soso moved westward. One fraction of the Northern Mande group, the Kono-Dama-Vai,12 probably began moving southward towards the coast of what is now Liberia shortly after this (c. 1350–1400). Probably during this same time, other clans who would later become the Kpelle, Loma, Bandi and Mende, and Landogo were moving into the Konian highlands and some of the adjacent forest. As Loma speakers say, Veatie ta yezu,\n\nMap 2. Map of Upper Guinea Coast region, c. 500 BCE\n\nMap 3. Map of Upper Guinea Coast, c. 1400\n\nMap 4. Map of Upper Guinea Coast, c. 1550 (from Jones 1981)\n\n36 / Chapter Two\n\ntilè lèzu (“people move [migrate] downward, they don’t move upward”). The direction “downward” means toward the sea, the same northeast-tosouthwest axis followed by the three major rivers that transect the Lomaspeaking territory.13 By 1400, it is clear that Kono-Dama-Vai speakers had descended in some numbers towards the coast, effectively separating the Kissi- and Golaspeaking populations from their nearest Mel language-speaking neighbors, the Sherbro, Temne, and Limba. At this same time, Fulbe people began inhabiting the mountainous range that came to be known as the Futa Jallon. This movement pushed the Soso westward toward the coast, and consequently pushed the Baga and Nalou to the edge of the Atlantic. These Mel speakers were thus isolated from their former Temne and Limba neighbors, creating three islands of Mel speakers, separated by columns of Mandespeaking populations that had reached the coast. This state of affairs is schematized in map 3. The last step in this series of movements is the best documented, because it occurred as many of the ﬁrst European explorers and traders arrived on the coast. Yet there is little agreement among scholars about the actual meanings of the related oral, written, and linguistic evidence. This period concerns the Mani invasions of the mid-1500s, and the military confederation known as Hondo. In 1668, Olfert Dapper, a Dutch physician and armchair geographer-ethnographer, compiled his Description of Africa from available published accounts as well as testimony from Dutch traders resident in Africa. Using the term “Cumba” interchangeably with “Mani,” he writes: “The year 1515 is when the Cumbas burst into the Capez country to enrich themselves by pillage. But attracted by the fertility of the soil, they decided to accustom themselves, and chased the Capez from all the places where they decided to establish themselves” (1686, 249). My principal interest in this regard is in understanding the importance of this set of movements in the emergence of the Kpelle-Loma-BandiLandogo-Mende groups that today make up the core of the Southwest Mande language-speaking group. What seems to be one result of these sixteenth-century movements (which certainly continued thereafter) is that the mass of southwest Mande-speaking people pushed westward toward the coast of present-day Sierra Leone. This movement, which cut the Melspeaking Kissi off from the Mel-speaking Gola, is represented in map 4. The question for both historians and ethnographers has been who were the Mani, or Mane or Cumba, as they were also called? First, it seems that scholars of the area have given insufﬁcient weight to a simple fact: in Northern Mande languages, the sufﬁx “nka,” “nke,” or “nko” (as in\n\nThe Tactics of Mutable Identity / 37\n\nManinka, Diallonke, or Kuranko) simply means “the people of.” Thus, the Mani and the Maninka are, in their own language, the same people. What, exactly, it meant to be Maninka in that particular place and time is a more complicated question, yet we can say with some conﬁdence that the Mani were at least in part Northern Mande speakers, related to today’s Maninka or Malinke. Most analysts (Person 1961; Abraham 2001), drawing on sixteenth- and seventeenth-century sources like Dapper (1668) and Fernandes (1951), have suggested that the invading force was comprised of a Northern Mande military elite14 and a rank-and-ﬁle population made up of some other ethnic group. This seems plausible, but who were these foot soldiers, and what is their relation to the populations of the region today? All the available evidence suggests that their identities were ﬂuid, allowing negotiation of the relations among language, ethnicity, and territory.15 In his essay on the settlement of the region, Warren d’Azevedo (1962a) paid close attention to Europeans’ accounts of the Hondo and Kondo confederacies: two multi-ethnic confederations based in the town of Bopolu from the 1600s to the 1800s, in a heavily forested part of the Gola-speaking region of what is now Liberia.16 The spoils of local warfare here, as in the Loma-speaking region, were slaves and control of the trading route between the savanna and the ocean. Seventeenth-century Hondo appears to have occupied approximately the same region as the Nineteenth-century Condo confederacy. About Hondo and its neighbors, Dapper wrote: They are called Galaveys because they originated among the Galas [Golas], and having been chased out of their country by the people of Hondo, they came to live in the land of the Veys [Vai—to the south]. Beyond this great forest, near the conﬁnes of Hondo and Manoë [the Manos], live the Galas, who obey a governor whom the king of Manoë sends there. Hondo is next to this forest and further to the northeast than the land of the Galaveys. In the province of Hondo is enclosed one called Dogo. Next to the Hondos are the Conde-Quojas [Kono], that is the “high Quojas” whose language differs from the Quojas of the coast [Vai] as German does from Dutch. (1686, 253)17\n\nThe Southwestern Mande populations, none of whom are identiﬁed by their present-day ethnonyms in the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century sources, were a major fraction of the groups identiﬁed as the “Hondo,” “Dogo,” “Folgia,” and also the “Mani.” That this history has not been clearly traced has much to do with anachronistic readings of history. Yves Person, whose voluminous research on the region put him in a perfect position to recognize these historical, linguistic, and cultural links for what\n\n38 / Chapter Two\n\nthey were, touched on this interpretation, but then seemed to be overcome by his Maninkophile obsessions in which all roads led to the Konian highlands, and surmised that “if [the Mano] had any share in the Mane adventure, it could only be as part of the Sumba cannibal hordes along with other Mande peoples such as the Kpele [Kpelle], the Toma [Loma], the Gbunde or Mendi, and the Kru peoples” (1971, 678).18 The forest–savanna frontier at the time was similar to that described by Bazin (1974) for the Segou state (in present-day Mali) in the early nineteenth century: young men gathered around a strong leader in order to save themselves from slave-raiding. With their arrival, the ranks of military recruits swelled, further strengthening the political-military machinery of an already powerful town or confederation (like Bopolu/Hondo). Consequently more young men (with their families) came from yet further away, seeking security and further strengthening the polity and its army. Ethnolinguistic identity would probably have taken second place to the ﬂexibility required for survival. The written historical record from the mid-1500s onward indicates that the last four-hundred-ﬁfty years in the Upper Guinea Coast region has been characterized by an alternation between large-scale wars such as the Mani invasions, causing major and rapid population movements, and periods of relative peace, in which occasional raids or ﬂare-ups would nonetheless have helped to keep the memory of insecurity alive. The continuous information we have from the mid-nineteenth century onward indicates that the forest–savanna frontier region experienced major tumult from roughly 1860 to 1910, succeeded by a period of relative peace from 1910 to 1990, which has again been succeeded by a period of regional warfare, tumult, and forced migration during the 1990s and 2000s. The social consequences were intense personal insecurity and extensive interethnic mixing. When the Atlantic slave trade was abandoned by the English in 1807, and then by the French and Americans, the system of production (i.e., raiding) in this region actually intensiﬁed.19 Holsoe (1977) describes how those nations that continued to trade in slaves (the Portuguese and Spanish, for instance) demanded entire boatloads of slaves together, as opposed to the ten or twenty slaves they were formerly willing to buy at each small barracoon along the coast. They did this so as to escape detection by the British navy’s vessels, whose job it was to intercept slavers and liberate their captives. Accounts by my Loma-speaking informants (as well as Beavogui’s [1991]), indicate that many late-twentieth-century Loma elders’ parents and grandparents were captured and enslaved during this period, and all sources agree that slave raiding was still common as late as\n\nThe Tactics of Mutable Identity / 39\n\n1906. By this point, captives were destined toward the internal slave trade, but conditions of insecurity were similar regardless of the destination of the war captives. During these dangerous years in the late precolonial period, ﬂight to safety followed by the deployment of one’s social capital were the means of survival. As Caroline Bledsoe has written: “during periods of military strife in the Central West Atlantic region, political allegiance involved attaching oneself to a powerful patron who could offer protection from marauding groups seeking captives and booty. Various degrees of subordination (slavery, pawnship, clientship and so on) were the price of safety” (1980, 145). I have elsewhere described the situation of contemporary Liberian refugees settling in Guinean Loma-speaking villages, sometimes invoking the bonds forged by previous generations of migrants and refugees (McGovern 2004, 2012). What we see in the refugee situation is the importance of the tactics of mutable identity in the region today. This situation gives us a sense of the dialectical, tactical nature of claims about identity. Such maneuvering was also a part of the historical dynamic, in which people who operated in uncertain and violent circumstances used power association membership, clan membership, marriage alliance relations, and networks of personal contacts to negotiate their relations to others. I shall now describe some of these dynamics, starting with the links among clan identity and settlement history in the area that became Macenta Préfecture.\n\nThe Koivogui-Kamara Corridor and the Question of Ethnicity Lebiyaga e Musadu bhaoni. (It is respect that made Musadu prosper.) —Loma proverb\n\nHere we take the broad historical sketch I have just presented and narrow our focus to the contemporary Loma-speaking heartland in Macenta Préfecture, Guinea, and Lofa County, Liberia. It is in this section that I raise questions about the assumptions underlying the oil-and-water model of ethnic identity. I rely heavily on the work of Facinet Beavogui, the Loma historian who did many years of research in the Loma-speaking region. In his 1991 doctoral thesis, he goes to some lengths to detail the settlement history of the region. By putting his material into the wider historical context I have outlined above, I come to different conclusions. I show that the Loma-speaking “corridor” between the Makona River to the northwest and the Ziama mountains to the southeast shows the traces of a surprisingly homogenous migration by people of the Kamara and Koivogui clans,\n\n40 / Chapter Two\n\nwho are the dominant landowners in almost every chiefdom of this corridor.20 Kamara and Koivogui are the Manya and Loma versions (respectively) of the same clan.21 Meanwhile, the Loma-speaking chiefdoms on either side of this corridor are far more heterogeneous in terms of dominant clans. These facts lead to my interpretation that the “Koivogui-Kamara corridor” is the"
