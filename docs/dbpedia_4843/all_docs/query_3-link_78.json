        "text": "Since the arrest of leading opposition politician Ousmane Sonko on March 3, Senegal has been gripped by unprecedented popular protests.\n\nRather than listen to the demands of the largely peaceful protest movement, the government has set out to crush it using all the means at its disposal: arbitrary arrests, the use of live ammunition, and the deployment of marauding militias.\n\nIn February, Sonko, president of the opposition PASTEF party (Patriots of Senegal for Work, Ethics, and Fraternity), was accused of rape and making death threats by an employee of a beauty parlour and has been subsequently stripped of his parliamentary immunity by an ad hoc commission dominated by pro-government MPs.\n\nHopes of a just resolution to the allegations were dashed when, en route to court, Sonko was arbitrarily arrested and placed in police custody for “disturbing public order”.\n\nThat was the last straw. Public anger erupted, setting the country ablaze.\n\nThe grievances that triggered countrywide demonstrations – from the capital Dakar to the Casamance region in the far south – go far beyond Sonko’s case. In the streets and on social media, cries of “Free Senegal” and “Macky out” have all but drowned out those of “Free Sonko”.\n\nRampant youth unemployment, growing inequality, corruption scandals, compounded by repressive measures amid the COVID-19 pandemic, are at the root of growing public anger. We are seeing a fed-up population taking to the streets to reject the country’s ruling political class.\n\nA climate of terror\n\nSince February, hardly a day has passed without the police raiding and arresting PASTEF activists, members of the Front for a Popular Anti-imperialist and Pan-African Revolution movement (FRAPP), and other political figures.\n\nNumerous human rights organisations have sounded the alarm, with Amnesty International calling on Senegalese authorities to “stop arbitrary arrests of opponents and activists, respect freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of expression, and shed light on the presence of men armed with clubs alongside the security forces.”\n\nAdditionally, torture, a tool of colonial repression maintained by every regime since independence, has again reared its ugly head. Khadidiatou Ndiouck Faye, director of the notorious Cape Manuel prison, appeared to confirm as much, when she said on March 4 that uncooperative political prisoners were being held in punitive cells where “the rule is that the detainee commits suicide”.\n\nIn addition to restrictions of access to social media, confirmed by the cybersecurity monitor NetBlocks, the authorities have shut down several private television and radio stations. Numerous videos shared on social media show security forces pursuing unarmed protesters amid the sound of gunfire.\n\nIn some regions, the Senegalese state has called in the army. So far, at least 10 people have been killed and hundreds seriously injured.\n\nDespite the mounting death toll, the government has decided to dig in its heels. On March 5, after the third day of mobilisation, called by the Y’en a Marre (“fed up”) collective, which in 2011 mobilised the youth to overthrow former President Abdoulaye Wade, Interior Minister Antoine Félix Diome released a statement confirming President Macky Sall’s determination to stop at nothing. Mr Diome characterised the violence as “terrorist” and said demonstrators were manipulated by “occult forces”.\n\nInternational impunity\n\nSince its independence, Senegal has won powerful allies – foremost among them, France – which have supported successive regimes, turning a blind eye to authoritarianism and human rights violations.\n\nThe image of a “model democracy”, an island of stability in the restive Sahel region, carved by the country’s first president, Léopold Sédar Senghor, himself the head of a single-party regime repressing the opposition, still resonates internationally.\n\nThe country opened up to a multi-party system in the 1980s and went through two transitions of power in 2000 and 2012. But President Abdoulaye Wade (2000-2012) and now Macky Sall (since 2012), once opponents, have both followed in their authoritarian predecessors’ footsteps.\n\nSuch concentration of power in the hands of the president goes back to the hyper-presidential system inherited from the 5th French Republic of 1958 and the Senegalese constitution of 1963, which repealed the prime minister’s position after the overthrow of the then-head of government, Mamadou Dia.\n\nThe ability of the president to run roughshod over the constitutional separation of powers was confirmed by Macky Sall himself, when in a televised New Year’s Eve speech last year, he said: “If the president knows that the arrest of [a] person [involved in a corruption scandal] will lead to the death of people, will he still arrest him? Maybe there is another way [to solve the problem].”\n\nIndeed, Macky Sall has failed to investigate a corruption scandal revealed in 2019 by BBC in which British Petroleum allegedly agreed to pay $10bn for a suspicious Senegalese gas deal involving Macky Sall’s own brother.\n\nNow that Senegal’s democratic charade has been finally exposed in front of the world’s cameras, impunity for Macky Sall’s regime in the court of international opinion must end. In 2018, the Economic Community of West African States’ Court of Justice condemned the state of Senegal for violating the rights of the former mayor of Dakar and main presidential contender Khalifa Sall who was found guilty of embezzlement and imprisoned in 2017.\n\nAmid the country’s current political crisis, the United Nations called on “all actors to exercise restraint and calm”. In the wake of the scale of the regime’s repression, mere declarations are no longer enough. We demand full accountability and justice for the crimes committed before Senegalese and international courts.\n\nSignatories (100):\n\nBoubacar Boris Diop, author and journalist ;\n\nMoussa Sene Absa, filmmaker;\n\nRachel Ndeye Khan, actress and jurist;\n\nMaky Madiba Sylla, musician and filmmaker;\n\nFlorian Bobin, researcher in history;\n\nKhadim Ndiaye, historian;\n\nDip Doundou Guiss, artist;\n\nJaly Badiane, activist;\n\nFou Malade, artist;\n\nWasis Diop, musician;\n\nHady Ba, philosopher (Cheikh Anta Diop University of Dakar, UCAD);\n\nThiat Kër Gui, artist;\n\nDemba Moussa Dembélé, economist;\n\nNdeye Fatou Fall, jurist;\n\nKilifa Kër Gui, artist;\n\nAbdarahmane Ngaïde, historian;\n\nMarie Parsine-Diop, merchant;\n\nOumar Dia, researcher in philosophy (UCAD);\n\nXuman, artist;\n\nGënji hip-hop, association of women artists, activists and feminists in hip-hop and urban cultures;\n\nKhalil Diallo, Senegalese writer;\n\nBeatrix Daumas-Diatta, social worker;\n\nRamatoulaye Ndiaye, nurse;\n\nSaratou Moussa Sam, lawyer;\n\nMad Zoo, artist (RBS Crew);\n\nEl Hadj Samba Ndiaye, associate professor of law (UCAD);\n\nDemba Gueye, specialist in digital communication and initiator of the hashtag #kebetu;\n\nSimon, artist;\n\nAissatou Ba, social worker;\n\nAmadou Bator Dieng, journalist, founder of Kirinapost;\n\nBanouna Sam, consultant and pan-Africanist activist;\n\nHamidou Dia, researcher (IRD);\n\nRokhaya Loum, artist;\n\nBabacar Faye, English teacher;\n\nNdèye Fatou Kane, researcher in gender studies (EHESS);\n\nAïda Dramé, political scientist specialized in conflict studies and editorialist;\n\nSun Sooley, artist;\n\nAbdoul Aziz Diouf, associate professor of law (UCAD);\n\nNdeye Fatou Wosso Tounkara, instructor in artistic activism and cultural project manager;\n\nBathie Samba Diagne, historian;\n\nDieynaba Madina Diallo, teacher;\n\nNdiouga Benga, lecturer in modern and contemporary history (UCAD);\n\nSeika (Awa Mbengue), artist;\n\nFatou Fall, analyst in defense, security and peace;\n\nNitt Doff, rap artist;\n\nSidy Alpha Ndiaye, associate professor of law (UCAD);\n\nFatou Niang Sow, telecommunications manager;\n\nIdrissa Ba, associate professor of medieval history (UCAD);\n\nDjimby Ka, communication executive;\n\nMike Sylla, stylist;\n\nSokhna Aïcha Mbodji, chef;\n\nAdam Sene, artist;\n\nTamsir Ousmane Diagne, financial expert;\n\nSocrates (Mamadou Diop), filmmaker and writer;\n\nDiane Regisford, academic;\n\nNgoné Sylla Diop, city councillor;\n\nAlpha Oumarou Ba, lecturer in oral literature (Assane Seck University of Ziguinchor);\n\nFatou Bintou Sall, web journalist;\n\nDread Wone, artist;\n\nBigué Marcelle, project manager (Legs Africa);\n\nPapa Dieye, land development engineer and environmentalist;\n\nBig D, artist;\n\nJeanne Dior Corréa, administrative technician;\n\nKhady Tamba, lecturer in English linguistics (UCAD);\n\nAss Malick, artist;\n\nAdja Coumba Gueye, social media manager;\n\nEl Hadj Abdoulaye Sall, lecturer in modern literature (UCAD);\n\nNdeye Yama Diouf, dancing artist;\n\nMalick Diagne, professor of philosophy (UCAD);\n\nObee (Fatima Ndiaye), artivist and entrepreneur;\n\nAlune Wade, musician;\n\nFabienne-Joseph Mérélix, artist;\n\nPope Ibrahima Ndiaye, dancer;\n\nAminata Diouf, entrepreneur;\n\nOmbrezion, artist;\n\nAlioune Gueye, inspector-auditor, political and administrative national secretary for the R3D party (Regards différents pour un développement durable);\n\nNdeye Awa Fall, stylist;\n\nTchiko, artist;\n\nKouro Wane, high school teacher;\n\nMamadou Coulibaly, physics teacher (UCAD) ;\n\nSokhna Diariatou Ba, higher technician in architecture;\n\nLudgero Amilcar Lima Silva, computer scientist, writer and social entrepreneur;\n\nMoh Dediouf, artist;\n\nMarie Mendy, administration secretary;\n\nDjibril Keïta, sociologist;\n\nBoc’s Amandla, artist;\n\nFatoumata Binetou Diallo, program coordinator (Toronto-based Shelter for women victims of violence and abuse);\n\nDread Maxim, artist;\n\nEl Hadji Malick Sy Camara, senior lecturer in sociology (UCAD) ;\n\nBamba Diop, filmmaker;\n\nNdickou Diaga Niang, child and family center advances and receipts director;\n\nSouleymane Ndiaye Sall, head of department in logistics;\n\nFatima Diop, executive coach and founder of Ubuntu Executive Coaching;\n\nBinou Ndoye, financial analyst;\n\nStefane Kabou, artist;\n\nArame Fall, auditor;\n\nMax Barry, artist;\n\nAlioune Ndiaye, former academy inspector, general secretary of the R3D party (Regards différents pour un développement durable);\n\nAbel Proença, artist;\n\nAmilcar Barsely, author."
