        "text": "Swope Park Rangers forward Hadji Barry will join the Guinea Menâs National Team for the first time in his career after being selected by head coach Paul Put for an Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Ivory Coast on Nov. 18 at Stade 28 Septembre in the Guinean capital of Conarky.\n\nâItâs really an honor and Iâm thankful of this opportunity to represent my country. This is like a dream come true. I canât wait,â Barry said. âIt will be very exciting going back home and sharing this special moment with my family, because I wouldnât be where I am today without their support from day one.â\n\nBarry, 25, was named to the USL All-League Second Team this week after a career year in which he led SPR in scoring with 19 goals this season, fourth most in the USL and a new single-season club record. The Swope Park Rangers Team MVP, Barry also finished second on the SPR squad with five assists and 45 chances created in 2018.\n\nA product of Monroe Community College and the University of Central Florida, Barry was selected by Orlando City SC in the first round of the 2016 MLS SuperDraft. He tallied an assist on his MLS debut in his first of 14 appearances for Orlando City SC from 2016-17 and would also contribute 14 goals and three assists for Orlando City B in the USL to bring his career totals to 33 goals and nine assists in three professional seasons.\n\nGuinea, captained by Liverpool midfielder Naby Keita, is 65th in the FIFA World Rankings and currently leads Group H in 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualification with 10 points from four matches (3-0-1). Now with two qualifying matches remaining, a draw or win against 64th-ranked Ivory Coast will secure a berth in next summerâs continental championship in Cameroon.\n\nGuinea MNT 23-Player Roster\n\nGoalkeepers: Ibrahima KonÃ©, Naby Yattara, Aly Keita\n\nDefenders: Ousmane SidibÃ©, Ibrahima Sory ContÃ©, Ernest SÃ©ka, Simon Falette, FodÃ© Camara, Issiaga Sylla, Baissama Sankoh, Mohamed Aly Camara\n\nMidfielders: Naby Keita, Ibrahima CissÃ©, Mohamed Mady Camara, Alkhaly Bangoura, Boubacar Fofana, Ibrahima TraorÃ©, Amadou Diawara"
