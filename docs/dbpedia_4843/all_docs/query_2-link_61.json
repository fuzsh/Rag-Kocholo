        "text": "Taking a look back at a busy Sunday on the Auburn campus ...\n\n* Auburn's 88-76 basketball victory over Alabama was big for Jeff Lebo and his players. It pushed the Tigers (14-11, 4-8) into a tie for third place in the Southeastern Conference West with Ole Miss. Because of beating Ole Miss twice, Auburn has the tiebreaker should it come to that.\n\n* The victory should provide some energy for the final four games of the regular season. Even if Auburn loses both road games - at Mississippi State and Arkansas - it can finish with six SEC wins by beating South Carolina and Georgia at home. Considering what this team has been through, that wouldn't be bad.\n\n* What a performance sophomore Lucas Hargrove had in scoring 28 points against Alabama. Hargrove started for the second time in his career. Before Sunday, he was averaging 6.6 points per game.\n\n* It's a shame that Frank Tolbert will leave Auburn without playing in an NCAA Tournament. I don't know that I've seen a player leave it on the court every time out like Tolbert does.\n\n* Looking at the players Alabama puts on the court, it's hard understand why Tide is tied with LSU at the bottom of the West Division. It's also hard to understand why, against the undersized Tigers, they didn't try to throw it inside to Richard Hendrix on every possession.\n\n* Do Auburn students enjoy anything more than serenading Alabama with its own \"Rammer Jammer\" cheer?\n\n* Maybe next year we'll finally get to see what Lebo can do with a full roster of players. Auburn coaches believe they signed their best recruiting class last November, plus Josh Dollard, Korvotney Barber and Boubacar Sylla should be back. Having said that, Tolbert and Quan Prowell will be sorely missed.\n\n* He doesn't get a lot of recognition, but Prowell is one of the better inside-outside players I've seen on any team this season. He got some help Sunday from Matt Heramb, who might have played his best game.\n\n* There was a lot of energy on the field when Auburn's football team opened spring practice. Coach Tommy Tuberville seems genuinely optimistic about the 2008 season. Here's what he said after practice:\n\n\"We have good leaders this year. I think this group will be the best leadership we've had in the last few years, and we've had good leadership to this point. That will make us even better. We have a chance to have a good football team. I think this team is gelled to do something special. We'll have to wait and see how we go through spring. You never want to make any predictions until you see what this group is about. I like the attitude, and that's where you start.\"\n\n* Offensive coordinator Tony Franklin told me in an interview last week that he wouldn't be surprised if a receiver came out of nowhere to play a significant role next season. He said it could even be a walk-on. He didn't mention any names, but I'll mention one as a possibility. Keep an eye on redshirt freshman John Cubelic, the brother of former Auburn center Cole Cubelic.\n\n* Nobody is saying it, but it seems Auburn coaches are pushing harder for early commitments than in years past. They got a big one Sunday from Williamson defensive end Terrance Coleman.\n\n* The baseball Tigers scored 12 runs for the second consecutive day in beating East Tennessee State for the third consecutive time, 12-4. It would be a mistake to assume too much, because ETSU probably isn't very good. But I have a feeling this team is going to be the one that turns the corner for fourth-year coach Tom Slater."
