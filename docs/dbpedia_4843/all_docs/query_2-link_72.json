        "text": "UW to send eight to regional meet\n\nUW photo service\n\nWyoming freshman Jeremiah James competes in the triple jump earlier this season at the Front Range Invitational in Laramie.\n\nTop five finishers move on to NCAA Championships\n\nBy Wyoming Sports.org\n\nThe University of Wyoming track and field team is sending eight qualifiers to the NCAA Midwest Regional meet this weekend in Lincoln, Neb., hosted by the University of Nebraska.\n\nThe eight individuals and their events and times they are competing in or the Cowgirls include senior Kate Burton (hammer throw and discus throw, Friday 1 p.m. and 5 p.m.), senior Gretchen Johnson (5,000-meter run, Friday, 6:40 p.m.), junior Shaylee Babbitt (100-meter hurdles, Saturday. 4:45 p.m.) and junior Courtney Gougler (discus, Friday, 5 p.m.).\n\nThe Cowboys are sending senior Vashone West (100-meter dash, Friday, 3:40 p.m.), junior John Alderson (triple jump, Saturday, 5 p.m.), freshman Jeremiah James (long jump, Friday, 5 p.m.),and freshman Alan John (hammer throw, Saturday, 1 p.m.).\n\nBurton, a native of Vancouver, Wash., and a Clark Junior College transfer qualified in her first year at UW. During the 2006 season she placed 21st at the NCAA Championships in the hammer throw. Burton currently owns the best throw in Wyoming’s history and the eighth best throw in the nation with her toss of 209-feet, 8 inches.\n\nJohnson, a Sheridan High School graduate from Basin, qualified earlier this year at the Stanford Invite where she ran her personal best time of 16 minutes, 35.98, seconds four one-hundredths off the record time. Johnson ran in the 2007 Cross Country NCAA Championships this past season, where she placed 116th out of 253 runners.\n\nBabbitt ran her personal best time of 13.62 at the MWC Championships and won her first title in four years. A resident of Yoder, she will compete in her first regional meet.\n\nGougler, the junior thrower from Glencoe, Okla., was the first to qualify as she tossed her personal best 166-0 in the discus at the first meet of the outdoor season in Boulder, Colo. Gougler competed in the 2007 NCAA Regional meet ,where she placed eighth in the discus.\n\nFor the Cowboys, West , who is from Fountain Springs, Colo., qualified in the 100-meter dash earlier this year at the Front Range Invite in Laramie with his time of 10.38. West currently holds the fifth best time in UW history in the 200-meter dash at 21.29.\n\nAlderson, a team captain from New Castle, Colo., qualified in the triple jump this year with his leap of 49-4 ½ in Laramie at the Front Range Invite. Alderson was all-conference this indoor season as well as the outdoor season in both the long jump and the triple jump.\n\nJames, a freshman from Morne Fortune, St. Lucia, broke the top five all-time UW list in the long jump with his personal best leap of 24-9 ¼ and a title at the MWC Championships in both the indoor and outdoor seasons.\n\nJohn from Jackson, threw his personal best 190-0 in the hammer throw at the Front Range Invite earlier this May.\n\nRangers A open with Wheatland\n\nYoung Laramie team starts slow against defending A state champions\n\nBy Richard Anderson\n\nWyoming Sports.org\n\nNo coach likes to lose and Laramie Rangers A American Legion manager Jeremy Francom counts himself among those who play to win.\n\nYet, despite a tough season opener Wednesday night at Cowboy Field, Francom is upbeat about his young Rangers’ team. Wheatland, the defending Class A state champions that is loaded with experience (six 19-year-olds), took a pair from the Rangers 22-1 and 12-2.\n\n“As far as the effort goes, I’m not disappointed,” Francom said. “You are disappointed after a loss. If you’re not disappointed after you lose, then you don’t need to be here. It was disappointing and also encouraging because you see so many good things and so much you can work on and improve on this early of the season.”\n\nThe doubleheader was the first two of a set 40-game schedule that has Francom and the Laramie coaches excited. Because of what lies down the road this season, the young Rangers A team is already ahead of last year.\n\n“The great thing about this year compared to last year is we know we’re playing a full 40-game schedule and we’re only two games into it,” Francom said. “Like Coach (Sean) McKinney always says, it’s a marathon, it’s not a sprint. As long as we continue to get better every day, we’ll be OK come the end of the year.”\n\nThe Rangers A team is comprised mainly of 15- and 16-year-olds and will compete in the A level in Wyoming. The roster will be set at about 12 players for the season, giving them a chance to bond as a team without much movement up and down from the A and AA teams.\n\n“The team is great because we don’t have one set guy who is out that will stand out above everybody,\" Francom said. “We’re a true team. I think when we come together as one, we’re going to have guys who can step up and do great things for us. We’re a team and a group who likes to work hard. They are willing to do the extra work to get the job done.”\n\nFrancom said the strength of the team now is its work ethic. “These kids are willing to stay after practice and put in the extra effort that it takes to get the little details ironed out. In the long run, that will make us stronger as a whole,” he said.\n\nLike the AA team, other athletic activities in the school level have made it tough to really go as a full squad. Now with the high school seasons complete, Francom said they can really get to work as a team.\n\n“What is going to help us too is when you have a full team show up for practice, you can do a lot more, rather than with just six guys,” Francom said. “We’re going to see those 12 kids all year long. We’re going to form a bond and we’ll do good things this year.”\n\nIt was a tough way to begin the season on Wednesday against arguably the top A team in the state that age-wise should probably play in the AA level. In the first game, Wheatland broke a 1-1 tie with seven runs in the second and eight more in the third.\n\nLaramie had just four hits in the first game and six errors. Tim Carpenter paced the Rangers with a double and single, with Brody Hilgencamp adding a double and Barry Thomas a single. Thomas, Hilgencamp and Carpenter worked on the mound.\n\nThe second game was much more competitive, with the Lobos breaking away with three runs in the fourth, four more in the fifth and a single run in the sixth. Laramie actually out-hit Wheatland 8-7 in that second game, but committed five errors to none by Wheatland.\n\nTyler Mitchell led the Rangers with three singles, with Thomas adding a RBI double. Hilgencamp, Nolan Carter, Nick Armijo and Derek Campbell all had singles in the game. Carter scored both Laramie runs.\n\nSri Sritharan, Josh Peterson and Lance McCartney all pitched for the Rangers.\n\n“We played a very, very good team,” Francom said. “They’ve played five or six games already and this is our first and second games. It gave us a look at where we are at and where we want to be. I definitely saw some good things and some things that we need to work on.”\n\nFrancom said the positive about Wednesday night was the mistakes his team made can be fixed.\n\n“We’re going to do good things this year, we just need to come together as a team and get a few more innings under our belts. We’ll be all right,” Francom said.\n\n“The first game was rough. There were first-game jitters. It’s the first time half of these guys have put on a Rangers’ uniform and you open up at home. We were a little nervous,” Francom added. “In the second game, we were able to relax a little bit and it was definitely a little closer than the score showed. It just got away from us at the end.”\n\nOther team members include Travis Scott, Kyle Alexander and Zack Kersey.\n\nThe Rangers A team will hit the road next Wednesday with a doubleheader at Rawlins.\n\n---\n\nWHEATLAND 22, LARAMIE A 1\n\n(First Game)\n\nWheatland 178 06 -- 22 13 1\n\nLaramie 100 00 -- 1 4 6\n\n---\n\nWHEATLAND 12, LARAMIE A 2\n\n(Second Game)\n\nWheatland 301 341 -- 12 7 0\n\nLaramie 101 000 -- 2 8 5\n\n---\n\nPrep falls to Cheyenne\n\nThe Laramie Rangers prep baseball team dropped a doubleheader to Cheyenne Prep on Tuesday night at Cowboy Field, 14-0 and 18-4. The twinbill was moved up from the originally scheduled July 23 date.\n\nIn the first game, the older Cheyenne team chipped away with three runs in the first and third innings and four runs in each of the fourth and fifth innings. Laramie had just one hit in the game, a leadoff single by Tyler Loose. Dylan Watson took the loss on the mound.\n\nIn the second game, Cheyenne broke open a relatively close game (9-4) with nine runs in the fifth inning. The Rangers had seven hits in that game, led by Loose's single and double and one RBI and two hits and a RBI by Abel Casas. Also for Laramie, Taylor Boggess had a single, Casey Stangle had a single and RBI, as did Alex Jordan.\n\nSam Feldman took the loss on the mound for Laramie, which fell to 3-6 on the season.\n\nThe Rangers Prep team returns to action on Saturday when it hosts the Rocky Mountain Titans in a doubleheader beginning at noon.\n\n---\n\n(First Game)\n\nCHEYENNE 14, LARAMIE PREP 0\n\nCheyenne 303 44 -- 14 9 0\n\nLaramie 000 00 -- 0 1 4\n\n---\n\n(Second Game)\n\nCHEYENNE 18, LARAMIE PREP 4\n\nCheyenne 522 09 -- 18 17 0\n\nLaramie 211 00 -- 4 7 4\n\nPetrino returns to UW football\n\nCourtesy UW photo service\n\nJason Petrino, then a graduate assistant coach for Wyoming, works with former Cowboy great John Wendling. Petrino is returning to Wyoming as the director of football operations.\n\nFormer graduate assistant will become director of football operations\n\nBy Wyoming Sports.org\n\nWyoming head football coach Joe Glenn announced on Wednesday that Jason Petrino will return to UW as the director of football operations. Petrino replaces Casey Glenn, who was recently named the UW tight ends coach.\n\nPetrino’s duties with the Wyoming football program include, but will not be limited to: coordinating team travel, overseeing the day-to-day administrative operations of the football office and monitoring budgetary and compliance issues relating to Cowboy football.\n\n“Jason (Petrino) is an individual who was on the ground floor with us when we first came to Wyoming,” Joe Glenn said. “As one of our graduate assistants when we first came to Laramie, he was instrumental in some big wins for us against BYU, CSU and UCLA.\n\n“Jason understands our mission and our coaching staff, and he knows how we want to do things. He possesses a great number of characteristics that will help our staff, our administration and our team in his role as director of football operations. He’s a heck of a guy, and we’re thrilled to have him back.”\n\nPetrino, a native of Kalispell, Mont., returns to the Wyoming football program after serving as the defensive graduate assistant during the 2003 and 2004 seasons, Glenn’s first two seasons at UW. As a graduate assistant coach, Petrino coached the Wyoming safeties and assisted in numerous facets of the football program. During his first season at UW, Petrino was a member of the coaching staff that led the Cowboy football team to home wins over rivals BYU and Colorado State. In his second season, he helped lead Wyoming to a 24-21 win over UCLA in the 2004 Las Vegas Bowl.\n\nPetrino has spent the past three seasons as the defensive coordinator at the University of Mary, a Division II school located in Bismarck, N.D. Aside from coordinating the Marauder defense, Petrino also coached the defensive backs and was the recruiting coordinator. He also worked in many other capacities during his time at Mary including working as a speed enhancement coach, an assistant strength coach, a game day manager, a sports information director and an assistant equipment manager.\n\nIn his three seasons at the University of Mary, Petrino helped lead the Marauders to a 20-10 record. This past season, Mary had the best defense in the Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference. They led the conference in pass defense, allowing only 197.6 yards a game, and ranked second in rush defense, allowing only 94.4 yards a game.\n\nPrior to his first stint at Wyoming, Petrino was the defensive backs coach at his alma mater, Carroll College. At Carroll, he coached under former UW assistant coach and letterwinner Mike Van Diest. Petrino coached the Fighting Saints defensive backs for three seasons from 1999-2002, winning the 2002 NAIA National Championship and the Frontier Conference Championship all three seasons.\n\nPetrino played football at Carroll College from 1995-99, serving as a team captain his senior year. He earned a bachelor of arts degree in sociology from Carroll in 2002.\n\nPetrino married the former Heather Fries on June 30, 2006. The couple welcomed their first child, Jason, Jr., on Aug. 28, 2007. Petrino joins his younger brother Jared on the UW football staff. Jared Petrino has served as the football video coordinator since 2006.\n\n“We are very excited to get back to the University of Wyoming and are thrilled to work with so many great people, coaches and student athletes,” said Petrino. “When the opportunity for our family to come back presented itself, it was an easy decision to make. We have some great memories from our time at Wyoming like beating UCLA in the Las Vegas Bowl and also some big wins over BYU, CSU and Ole Miss. We always wanted to get back to Wyoming and couldn’t be more excited to arrive in Laramie and get to work.”\n\nRangers Prep thumps Hawks\n\nBy Richard Anderson\n\nWyomingsports.org\n\nSometimes in sports, it’s not the mistake you make that is the problem; it’s how you react to the mistake.\n\nFor the Laramie Rangers Prep baseball team, Thursday night’s game against the Fort Collins Hawks was all about how the Rangers would react -- to Monday’s drubbing against Cheyenne Prep.\n\nThe Rangers reacted quite well, stopping the Hawks 17-10 at Cowboy Field. The win moved Laramie to 2-4 on the season. On Monday, the Rangers fell to Cheyenne 19-0 and 10-0.\n\n“Monday night was a beating,” Rangers Prep manager VerDon Hoopes said. “They took it pretty hard. We had a long talk about what is our purpose or what is our goal here. That is to just get better all of the time, keep improving and prepare for the future. It’s starting with this 13- and 14-year-old deal. We played against a Cheyenne team that has had a lot of experience and they took it to us pretty good.\n\n“But the kids came out and probably had their two best practices of the year on Tuesday and Wednesday and really got after it like nothing had happened on Monday. That was a good positive. The way they responded tonight was a lot of fun.”\n\nThe Rangers jumped out early, leading 13-1 and 17-4 before the Hawks came back a little in the final couple of innings. Laramie had nine players with hits in the game.\n\n“They made a few errors, but we did some things, like a nice suicide squeeze in the second inning to get our first run. Things just got going from there,” Hoopes said. “They had a lot of good hits tonight. Some of the kids hit the ball into outs, but they made good contact.”\n\nCraig Welniak led the way offensively with a single and triple and two RBI, with Sam Feldman adding a pair of hits and an RBI. Brady Olson had two RBI in the game, with Casey Stangle and Dylan Watson both knocking in a run. Hunter Wick, Taylor Boggess, Tommy Johnson and Abel Casas all had one hit in the game as well.\n\nFeldman was the winning pitcher, giving up four hits and one run in four innings.\n\nLaramie will return to action Saturday with a doubleheader at Cowboy Field against the Longmont Vipors, beginning at noon.\n\n“The field is getting green out here, finally,” Hoopes said. “It was a little chilly tonight, but at least we got to play. Longmont is right in the middle of the pack in league play, so there is no telling what they have. But they have to come up here and play on the big field, so that is always fun for us. We’re looking forward to it.”\n\n---\n\nRangers Prep 17, Fort Collins Hawks 10\n\nFort Collins Hawks 001 031 5 -- 10 11 5\n\nLaramie Prep 024 650 x -- 17 11 4\n\nRangers ready for a game\n\nRichard Anderson photo\n\nJon Sorenson, left, and Skyler Joy are two returning All-Staters for the Laramie Rangers AA American Legion baseball team.\n\nPost 14 looking for a little more unity\n\nBy Richard Anderson\n\nWyoming Sports.org\n\nSkyler Joy and Jon Sorenson have the recognition of being honored individually as baseball players. Yet, they are more excited about the team atmosphere that they are seeing this pre-season.\n\nBoth are returning All-State players for the Post 14 American Legion baseball team, and both see a little different Rangers squad under second-year skipper Sean McKinney.\n\n“We have a lot of new kids who have come in, and it is actually kind of exciting because there is a lot of talent and all of them are willing to learn from myself and the coaches,” Joy said. “It is exciting to have kids who want to play and are willing to work hard to achieve the same goal. We have a really strong core of guys who get along well, on and off the field. It just makes it easier to get out there and work day-in and day-out. We’re all in it together.”\n\nSorenson, still just 16 years old, said they don’t have a “ton of experience,” but they show it in other ways.\n\n“We help the younger kids out on the field and we have other kids helping us out, too. It’s a give-and-take situation,” Sorenson said.\n\nThe Rangers will officially open the season this weekend in Cheyenne with a pair of games each against seven-time defending state champion Cheyenne Post 6 and last year’s state runner up, Gillette. Laramie faces Cheyenne at 1 p.m. on Saturday and then takes on Gillette at 3:30 p.m., before playing Gillette Sunday at 12:30 p.m. and Cheyenne at 3 p.m.\n\nIt was a tough year in the won-loss column (14-29) for the Rangers, who failed to earn at least a third-place finish at state for the first time in three years. A good turnout with a strong mixture of experience and young talent has McKinney excited about the possibilities.\n\n“We’ve been hitting inside and throwing since February,” McKinney said. “It was great about three or four weeks ago to finally get outside. We had those two scrimmages against Cheyenne and Wheatland, which showed us where we stood as a team, what we need to work on. So far, spring ball has been great. We’re working some kinks out, finding where some kids can play, and finding what they can do. Overall, I’m very happy with what we have accomplished so far.”\n\nFor McKinney, a former Ranger player himself and collegiate at Mesa State, things have gone much smoother to begin his second season at the helm.\n\n“It’s been a lot better for me and my assistant coaches, knowing the kids from last year, knowing what each kid needs to do,” McKinney said. “It makes our practices more to the point and what we need to focus on more.”\n\nMcKinney, who is assisted by Kyle Deck, Jeremy Francom and Greg Warren, said their early focus is on fundamentals and teaching the young players the game of baseball.\n\n“We have a lot of kids with a lot of raw talent,” McKinney said. “As coaches, we have to take that talent and teach them the game of baseball. Baseball is very complicated. It has a lot of things going on, within a game, within an inning, within pitches.”\n\nIncluding the Rangers Prep team, there are about 38 players out for the Legion program, up from 18 last year (on two teams). That alone has McKinney pleased.\n\n“That is a good sign for the program and for the kids of Laramie,” he said. “Baseball is a great sport and I am happy to be here teaching the kids, trying to teach them everything that I know and learn some things from them as well.”\n\nJoy, who is moving over from third base to shortstop this season, said he looks to tap into McKinney’s baseball knowledge for a possible collegiate baseball future. He said he worked with McKinney a lot during the off-season on several aspects of the game, such as hitting to the opposite field and defensively at a new position.\n\n“They are a lot of things that he brings from the college game, so maybe I can move up to that level some day,” Joy said.\n\nAs a team, McKinney said the Rangers could be strong defensively and they should have more depth on the pitching mound this season. It all goes back to fundamentals.\n\n“We want kids to play several positions; that way we can be more versatile,“ McKinney said. “That will help us out a lot because we do have a lot of athletes. That will play to our advantage.”\n\nSorenson is a prime example, as he will play at third base, catcher and in the outfield, as well as pitch.\n\n“I’ll play wherever they want me to play,” Sorenson said.\n\nMcKinney said that a team can never have enough pitching, but he likes their depth on the mound.\n\n“We have a lot of kids who can throw,” he said. “Last year, we were really young and this year we are as well. But I feel like we have a lot of kids who can give us good innings and that will be what we need.”\n\nDespite an up-and-down spring, weather-wise, the Rangers are anxious to get on the field for games that count. Even if it is against arguably the two top teams in the state.\n\n“We’re definitely going to see where we’re at. It’s tough to schedule this early in the year, so unfortunately, we get Cheyenne, which has won seven straight state titles,” McKinney said. “It’s a good team for us to play. It will show us where we are at and it shows the kids where they need to be at. The state tournament will always run through Cheyenne and likely Gillette. It will be fun to go toe-to-toe with some of the best teams in the state.”\n\nFor Joy and Sorenson, this weekend will be a chance for them to take what they have learned on the practice field into a game situation.\n\n“We’re all anxious, but at the same time we’re still trying to get some work done,” Joy said.\n\nSorenson, however, will only get to play on Sunday, as he will compete for the Laramie High School track and field team Saturday at the regional meet at Okie Blanchard Stadium in Cheyenne.\n\nIf only he could run back and forth from the track and baseball diamond at Powers Field.\n\n“I wish I could,” Sorenson said with a grin.\n\n---\n\nLaramie Rangers AA and A Roster\n\n18 year olds\n\nJason Rodriguez -- outfield, pitcher; Skyler Joy -- shortstop, pitcher; Ryan Ivey -- outfield; Sri Sritharan -- pitcher.\n\n17 years old\n\nTim Delbert -- catcher, outfield; Zach Kersey -- outfield; Mike Garner -- first base, pitcher; Coleton Wilson -- pitcher, first base; Ryland Harding -- infield, pitcher; Jordan Rhodine -- infield, outfield, pitcher; Mike Hudson -- outfield, pitcher; Sean Gardea -- outfield, catcher.\n\n16 years old\n\nBrody Hilgenkamp -- outfield; Travis Scott -- outfield; Jon Sorenson -- third base, catcher, outfield, pitcher; Derek Campbell -- outfield; Tim Carpenter -- first base, pitcher; Nick Armijo -- catcher, infield; Kyle Alexander -- catcher, infield.\n\n15 years old\n\nTyler Mitchell -- outfield; Lance McCartney -- infield, pitcher; Barry Thomas -- pitcher, infield; Josh Peterson -- outfield, pitcher; Nolan Carter -- infield, pitcher.\n\n14 years old\n\nMax Schoen -- infield, pitcher."
