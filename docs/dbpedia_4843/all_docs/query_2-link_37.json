        "text": "Waddell looking to give Cowboys post presence, added toughness\n\nRichard Anderson photo\n\nWyoming redshirt freshman Adam Waddell works on setting a screen with Cowboy coaches Heath Schroyer and Anthony Stewart.\n\nBy Richard Anderson\n\nWyoming Sports.org\n\nIf three words could describe Wyoming redshirt freshman Adam Waddell this season, it would be bigger, faster, stronger.\n\nA fourth word would be potential.\n\nThe Cody native showed that promise early last year before suffering a stress fracture to his left foot in the sixth game and sitting out the season with a medical redshirt.\n\nWaddell is now being counted on to provide some much-needed post presence and toughness in Heath Schroyer’s second season at the helm.\n\n“Adam Waddell is going to win a lot of basketball games at Wyoming, there’s no question in my mind,” Schroyer said. “He’s tough and he can rebound out of his area. It’s really hard to find post players who can go get it out of their area, and Adam is one of those guys.”\n\nWaddell’s redshirt season proved to be a blessing in disguise, although looking back, he said at times it was a frustration in reality.\n\nA competitor who reminds many old Cowboy fans of Jon Summers (1986-88) -- not only with his aggressive in-your-face play, but in the face -- Waddell didn’t want to watch from behind the bench; he wanted to be on the front line.\n\nAt the same time, he said he knew it was the right thing to do. That frustration has since diminished.\n\n“In a way, it was beneficial because I have grown a little bit and I have gained a little bit of weight,” he said. “I think I have gotten better as a player. Looking back, it was a good decision.”\n\nKnock on wood, Waddell’s left foot is fine. Not only has he beefed up, but he has been able to work on his post game on the court. His biggest improvements? Facing up to the basket and rebounding.\n\n“I’m trying to be an aggressive player and I think I have maintained that since I broke my foot,” Waddell said.\n\nIn a recent practice, the Wyoming coach staff, armed with pads, beat on Waddell and sophomore post Mikhail Linskens mercifully while they drove to the basket. The end result is to go up strong despite the pounding.\n\nThen bigger and stronger than anyone else on the court at Cody High School, Waddell said he had to adjust to the physical play as a Cowboy.\n\n“Although we did that in high school, when I got to college, I was a little hesitant to get in there and bang,” he said. “But I got more and more used to it. Last year, Joe (Taylor) was a physical player and pushing Mikhail off the block is not an easy job. I think it is what my game should be.”\n\nWaddell and Linskens will have to go toe-to-toe with the best the Mountain West Conference has, particularly Utah’s Luke Nevill.\n\nWaddell said it is critical that he and Linskens establish a post presence. He said Schroyer tells them that every day in practice.\n\n“We want to be the aggressor, the more physical team at the post spot,” he said. “You can’t be a finesse player when you are my size. I am kind of a smaller five guy for the guys in my conference. I have to be that way to play.”\n\nWaddell was listed at 6-foot-9, 215 pounds last season. He was still at about 215 earlier in the summer before he put on about 15 pounds. And he grew an inch.\n\n“This is where Coach wants me to play at,” he said.\n\nThe added weight has been an adjustment for his body, he said, as he felt the weight initially.\n\n“But it is not a bad thing; it is a good thing,” he said.\n\nAlthough still a very young team, Waddell said the Cowboys have high hopes for the season.\n\n“Coach has all of his guys that the has recruited in here and I have been fortunate enough to stay here,” Waddell said. “Having Brandon (Ewing) and with Sean (Ogirri) able to play, and Tyson (Johnson) those three seniors being leaders are going to help us a lot. There’s a ton of experience right there.\n\n“The new guys brought in are very athletic and very long. We have Djibril (Thiam) back in December and he will be a huge help. We’re excited. We’re hoping for the best and we’re striving to get that record going and getting momentum going into conference so we can so some things this season.”\n\nJohnson suspended\n\nUniversity of Wyoming senior forward Tyson Johnson has been suspended for the first two \"events\" of the 2008-09 season, due to a violation of team rules, Schroyer announced on Wednesday.\n\nSchroyer said he will have no further comment on this matter.\n\nJohnson will miss Saturday's scrimmage in Seattle against Washington and the exhibition game on Nov. 8 against the Colorado School of Mines.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 Johnson, a transfer from Blinn Community College in Brenham, Texas, came on in the Mountain West Conference season last year and averaged 12.5 points, 5.9 rebounds and played 27.6 minutes a game in his final 12 contests, scoring in double figures in 10 of those games.\n\nJohnson’s best scoring performances of the season came on March 5 when he scored 20 points against BYU. He also scored 18 against San Diego state, 17 against Colorado State and 16 points against UNLV.\n\nJohnson averaged 7.0 points for the season.\n\nOn the court: Schroyer-- Cowboys ahead of last year\n\nRichard Anderson photo\n\nNewcomers Afam Muojeke drives on Djbril Thiam during a recent Cowboy practice.\n\nBy Richard Anderson\n\nWyoming Sports.org\n\nEditor’s note: Wyoming Sports.org sat down with Wyoming head men’s basketball coach Heath Schroyer this week and discussed the differences between his first season and the beginning of his second season. In the second of two stories, Schroyer talks about the changes and additions on the court.\n\nThe Wyoming Cowboys took a shot to the chest in the first round of the Mountain West Conference basketball tournament, losing to Colorado State in the first round.\n\nWyoming had beaten the rival Rams twice during the regular season, but saw its season come to a staggering halt with the loss. It was a tough way for Wyoming head coach Heath Schroyer to end his first season at the helm. Although the Cowboys had just 12 wins going into the tournament, Schroyer felt like the program had made strides in many other areas, on and off the court.\n\nDespite the loss, it only took Schroyer “a couple of hours” to start thinking about seson. A few days later, they went back to work.\n\n“As hard as it was losing the last game, there was a point a couple of day afterwards that you realize, 'you know what, we weathered the storm and as hard as it was, we got through it. We’re better today,'\" Schroyer said.\n\n“The guys that we sat out, the guys we knew we would have back and the guys we thought we were going to bring in, it got our juices flowing pretty quick. I’m happy that we didn’t quick fix this. We’ve done it with young guys, we’ve done it by bringing guys in and redshirting them and balancing out our classes. We haven’t set ourselves up as a one-hit wonder. We have set ourselves sup, in my opinion, for continued improvement and gradual improvement. Hopefully, we’re getting to a point where each year we’re competing for postseason bids. If we can do that, then we have accomplished a lot.”\n\nAfter returning from the MWC tournament in Las Vegas, Schroyer had the team take a few days off before getting back into the weight room.\n\n“As the leader of the program, I had to come out and show that it was over, as hard as it was,” he said. “We went back in and started working hard. When you work hard and starting sweating again, you start talking about next year and what we have to do in the off-season. It gets everybody ready to go, to get that bad taste out of your mouth. I really feel that from the seniors way more than from the previous year.”\n\nSchroyer said he leans on his three seniors -- guards Brandon Ewing and Sean Ogirri and forward Tyson Johnson -- to lead this team that still is young and inexperienced. Ewing is a two-time MWC scoring champion, with Ogirri bringing in scoring and leadership after transferring from Wichita State, where he led the Shockers to the Sweet 16 two seasons ago. Johnson came on last season to become a valuable scorer down low.\n\n“I talked to the seniors on the very first day of school. I talked to them about this being their last go-around,” Schroyer said. “I challenged all of the guys in the program, and starting with this senior class, to leave this program better than how you found it. If each guy in the program, if each coach in the program can do that, then we have done our job. That’s the biggest thing that I talk to these three seniors about when we talk alone. That’s kind of our motto, so to speak, as a program. We all know where it was. If we do that in each class, then we’re going to have a program that we all want.”\n\nYoung and inexperienced for sure, Schroyer likes the talent and the potential.\n\n“There is no question in my mind that our young kids are talented and they all have a chance to be really good players here,” he said. “I’m more confident because it is year two. Guys understand what we are trying to accomplish on both sides of the ball.”\n\nThe key, Schroyer added, will be how quick the young players will adapt and step into their roles.\n\n“Our three seniors have all, in different ways, proven themselves at this level,” Schroyer said. “Now, it is going to come down to the two or three young guys who can step up and become contributors. If that happens, then we have a chance to become pretty competitive.\n\nSchroyer is certainly counting on 7-foot sophomore center Mikhail Linskens and 6-8 junior forward Ryan Dermody to continue their improvement, and redshirt freshmen Adam Wadell (6-9) and Afam Muojeke (6-7) to step in and contribute. Also new to the program is 6-7 junior forward Mahamoud Diakite and transfer Djbril Thiam (6-9), who will be eligible at the start of the second semester and 6-5 freshman A.J. Davis.\n\nSophomore transfer guard JayDee Luster and 7-2 sophomore Boubacar Sylla will sit out as redshirts, with freshmen walk-ons guards Galand Thaxton and Arthur Boudeo also on the roster.\n\nDespite the plethora of new faces, Schroyer said it is still easier because last year was a completely new offense and a new defensive philosophy. The returning Cowboys are ahead of last year because it is the same offense and same defense.\n\n“As hard as it was last year, we kept teaching and we kept demanding certain things on both sides of the ball because that is how we are going to build a program,” Schroyer said. “If we just threw it away midseason and did something else, then we would be starting at year one again on the basketball floor. I feel good about it. As hard as it was to bite the bullets that we had last year with redshirting certain guys and doing the things we had to do, there is no question in my mind that we are better off today because of it.”\n\nNow is the time to take the next step in the process. As coaches and as players, Schroyer said they want to win every game.\n\n“That is why we are here,” he said.\n\nBut for Wyoming at this stage of the program, he said that they have to be a little more realistic. After all, they have nine freshmen and sophomores on the roster.\n\n“I think we’re going to surprise people this year,” Schroyer said. “We are set up in every component to be competitive for the next three, four, five years. That’s a credit to my staff and that’s a credit to our young men who are in the program. I’m excited about starting; I’m excited about our year. I like our guys. The three seniors are playing like seniors and they are leading like seniors. We have a lot of young pups who are following them, and if two or three of those guys step up like I think they will, then we are going to be pretty darn good come January or February.”\n\nSecond year changes: Breaking down the Cowboys\n\nRichard Anderson photo\n\nWyoming head coach Heath Schroyer talks to his team during a drill in a recent practice session.\n\nBy Richard Anderson\n\nWyoming Sports.org\n\nEditor’s note: Wyoming Sports.org sat down with Wyoming head men’s basketball coach Heath Schroyer this week and discussed the differences between his first season and the beginning of his second season. In the first of two stories, Schroyer talks about how he broke the program down off the court.\n\n---\n\nIt’s the little things that Heath Schroyer hopes brings big rewards to the Cowboy basketball program in the immediate future.\n\nNow in his second year at the helm, Schroyer broke the program down and basically started from scratch. There were plenty of lumps taken along the way, but they were trials and tribulations that Schroyer said he envisioned and worked through.\n\nFor the Cowboys, it went back to team meetings, to how they present themselves, to how they go out on the floor, even to what they wore in practice. A big part of the transformation of the program was to just bring the team together.\n\n“Last year, it was an endless process working on those things,” Schroyer. “Now, we’re not dealing with those things. Guys get along lot better. Our staff has done a good job of bringing players in, not only with talent level to compete in this conference, but that they get along and they mesh. A lot of people don’t think about those things in the recruiting process, but who can fit into the locker room and who can’t. If it comes down to two players and both of them are pretty comparable, we’re going to go with the guy who can add to the locker room. We’ve done that with all of the guys who we have been able to get here in the last 18 months. All of the guys get along, all of them mesh together.”\n\nSchroyer wanted to see changes in the classroom, changes in how they acted and performed in practice. He said he wanted to see changes in how hard do they work in the weight room.\n\nAgain, it was the little things.\n\n“We lift at 7 a.m. We all wear the same gear. All of those things, we’re not having to go back and re-teach,” he said. “It is becoming the culture. The accountability is becoming the culture and how hard we work is becoming the culture. From here on out, in my opinion, that’s when we start to build things and build a program that will hopefully get us back into the NCAA Tournament and be a team that can compete in this league. We’re excited about taking the next step in the process.”\n\nSounds easy. It wasn’t. Schroyer inherited problems in many areas when he took over from Steve McClain on March 23, 2007.\n\nSchroyer and his staff basically had to do a little house cleaning. Some players didn’t adhere to those changes and they are gone. Some hesitated, some grabbed a hold of the changes and ran with it. It was nothing that Schroyer didn’t expect to face.\n\n“It’s normal whenever there is a coaching change and taking over a situation like this one was in, you are always going to have certain individuals who maybe don’t want to conform or conform on the surface,” he said. “This year our guys have really bought in. They understand why they do what we do. Last year was a whole year of selling them of what we are trying to do.\n\n“Here is the forest amongst the trees. At some point, this is what is going to happen. It feels good. As a head coach, I feel a lot better going into year two than I did going into year one. These guys, I love being around them. As funny as that sounds, sometimes that is hard. I enjoy the guys, I know they enjoy each other. I think they enjoy the coaches as well.”\n\nSchroyer’s toughest sell: Everything.\n\n“I’d like to think that we are very detail oriented in all of the things that we do,” Schroyer said. “That was the biggest thing. The pace of which we, as a coaching staff, work. The pace of which we want the program to work -- in all facets. Just the amount of rpms that each of the individuals have to run at that, I think, at the University of Wyoming, is the only way for us to be successful. We have to work harder than everybody else at every facet of the program.”\n\nThe facet that put the program in peril was academics. Wyoming men’s basketball was in dire straights in the classroom. When athletics director Tom Burman hired Schroyer, that was first and foremost on his fix-it list.\n\nLast spring, the Academic Progress Rate for men's basketball -- as expected -- was down released from the 2006-07 academic year. UW's APR for men's basketball was 864, which was down from 881 for the 2005-2006 academic year.\n\nSince then, Schroyer said the program has made good strides in the classroom, but it is not out of the woods yet.\n\n“We were obviously in a very big hole, but we’re fighting our way out; our heads are above water now,” Schroyer said. “Our seniors are on track to graduate in the very foreseeable future. When I got here, that wasn’t the case. All of our guys stayed for summer school. It’s about accountability in the class room. Our staff has done a phenomenal job. Molly Moore, Tom Burman, from top to bottom, they have been very supportive of a lot of changes that I wanted to make in that component of the program.”\n\nIn Schroyer’s opinion, all of his players can now compete in the classroom. By redshirting players and taking Division I transfers and redshirting them, Schroyer said it enables them to buy us some time and get these guys close to graduating.\n\n“As bad as I want to fix the basketball part, I have to do it at the same time to fix the academics,” he said. “We were at a point where we were going to lose postseason play, we were going to lose additional scholarships. Now we have come a long, long way in both of those areas in 18 months.”\n\nSchroyer said that the academics problem wasn’t broke over night and it wasn’t going to be fixed over night. But through keeping players here all summer to manage the classes the players take, he said all of them are going towards degrees. Schroyer said those are all things that accountability-wise, that they had to get done.\n\n“Getting them to class and our study sessions are very intense,” he added. “Our guys are in study hall Monday through Thursday and then Sunday night; five nights a week we’re in there. As coaches, we hold them accountable. That was one of the reasons I was hired. In the next year or so, we’ll be back to where we want to be academically.”\n\nWith the rise of popularity with the Cowgirl basketball program under Joe Legerski, the Cowboys have been thought of in the past by some as a little aloof within the community and on campus. That is another area where Schroyer has sought to improve. Like many aspects, he said that too goes back to recruiting.\n\n“We wanted and recruited people who wanted to be here and about what we’re trying to be about,” he said. “We want to be team players who support the University of Wyoming. We’re not transparent, we’re not just our own entity. We’re part of a bigger piece here and that is a university community. We encourage it and I am glad. It is important for their overall being and it is important for us to be a component of the university community not just the basketball team.\n\n“We have guys who are really good guys and they want to be out there. These are good kids. Whenever people get a chance to talk to Brandon Ewing, talk to Adam Wadell, talk to Mikhail Linskens, you’ll find out. I have gotten a lot of e-mails saying they are really good kids. They’re not perfect, but no 18- or 22-year old is perfect. More than that, they are really good ambassadors to the university and to the state of Wyoming. When you win games and you do it the right way and you do it with good people who are talented -- you have to have some talent -- when you do it with the quality of kids that we have in the program, it just makes it all the better.”\n\nAs the Cowboys are just a few days into official practices, the Wyoming coaching staff can now spend more time on basketball and getting the team competitive on the court.\n\nThat brings a smile to Schroyer’s face.\n\n“Before you can win games or even think about that, you have to change your culture,” Schroyer said. “Right now, I feel like the culture has changed. Now we’re in a situation where we have to maintain the culture, which is a lot different than changing it. I feel better about it.”\n\nThe day he got to Laramie, Schroyer said that they had a lot of work to do. That hasn’t changed.\n\n“We’ve accomplished a lot, but it takes a while for staff, for the university and for players to realize the attention to detail and the sense of urgency, the rpms that you have to run at be competitive,” he said. “We have a lot more work left.”\n\n---\n\nUp next: Schroyer discusses the changes made on the court."
