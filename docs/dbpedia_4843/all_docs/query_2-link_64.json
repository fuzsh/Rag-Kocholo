        "text": "8: 55 EAT: FULLTIME: GUINEA 2-0 UGANDA. Another campaign goes to waste as the Guineans have gone against all odds to beat the Ebola epidemic and make it to Afcon 2015.\n\n8:52PM: Clock winding down, two minutes to go, any final drama? Well, Denis Onyango just saves a shot!\n\n8:50 EAT: 90 MINUTES UP. Uganda still fails at the final hurdle, the fans in Casablanca must be dejected, they will feel the toughest of journeys back to Kampala. FOUR minutes of added time.\n\n8:43 EAT: Daniel Sserunkuma's shot is saved by Naby Yattara. Guinea look relaxed but lethal on the counter.\n\n8:42 EAT: Cranes have only eight minutes to resurrect the Afcon 2015 dream or else, embrace the 'since 1978' tag once more.\n\n8:38 EAT: Geoffrey Massa has his shot well targeted but it goes over the bar.\n\n8:36 EAT: Into the final 15 minutes, the hopes are fading, the legs are wearing out, Cranes need two goals to make Afcon 2015.\n\n8:32 EAT: Denis Onyango playing a sweeper role after Mwesigwa's send off.\n\n8:27 EAT: UGANDA SUBSTITUTION: Brian Majwega paves way for Mike Sserumaga.\n\nMicho now has an attack-minded side. It means Baba Kizito and Mawejje play deep in the middle. Then Sserumaga is just infront of them. And the striking trio of Massa, Sserunkuma and Ssentongo upfront.\n\n8:24 EAT: GUINEA SUBSTITUTION: Mohammed Yattara on for Ibrahima Traore.\n\n8:21 EAT: YELLOW CARD: Soumah is booked.\n\nThe Cranes need two goals to erase the 37-year tough memories, the extension of this Afcon jinx.\n\n8: 20 EAT: Its in. Onyango falls down on his left but the ball is just fast enough to the bottom corner. GUINEA 2-0 UGANDA.\n\n8:17 EAT: RED CARD: Andy Mwesigwa is SENT OFF.\n\n8:17 EAT: Brian Majwega opens up on the left flank, good foot work but his cross is wasted by Luwagga Kizito.\n\n8:15 EAT: The Cranes fumble outside the Guinea area, ball cleared. Mwesigwa makes another foul.\n\nUGANDA SUBSTITUTION: Daniel Sserunkuma on for Farouk Miya. Miya has had a tough five days in the Cranes' jersey.\n\n8:10 EAT: Cranes skipper Andy Mwesigwa commits another foul here.\n\nHe survives a booking.\n\n8:08 EAT: Back to Casablanca, Uganda are doing the fire-fighting business in the opening minutes against the Guineans.\n\n8: 09 EAT: In Tamale, TOGO pulls one back against GHANA. Jonathan Ayite half the deficit to make it 2-1.\n\nGHANA have failed to keep a clean sheet in 17 months.\n\n8:05 EAT: And we are back underway for the final 45 minutes between GUINEA and UGANDA in Casablanca.\n\nGUINEA 1-0 UGANDA.\n\n7: 48 EAT: HALF-TIME: GUINEA 1-0 UGANDA.\n\n7:47PM EAT: 45 minutes played, the Cranes are playing longer than usual passes in search of an eqauliser. Panic!\n\n7:42 EAT: We are into the final five minutes of this first half and the Cranes are yet to find an answer to Ibrahima Traore's strike.7:43PM: A cross from Brian Majwega is cleared away. Cranes are lacking the final ball at goal.\n\nFACT: In all 2015 Afcon Qualifiers that Cranes have conceded first, they have failed to win. Madagascar (Away), Togo (Home & Away)\n\n7:34 EAT: The Cranes are pacing up. Godfrey Walusimbi busts up front. Three corner-kicks in a row but they yield no fruit. Good response since that Traore goal!\n\nCranes are slowly stringing up play in the middle. They need a final pass on the business end of things.\n\nChat conversation end\n\n7: 33 EAT:THIS IS HOW GROUP E STANDS NOW\n\n1. Ghana 11pts\n\n2. Guinea 10pts\n\n3. Uganda 7pts\n\n4. Togo 6pts\n\n7:30 EAT: In Tamale, GHANA extends their lead against TOGO, Mubarak Wakaso makes it 2-0.\n\nChat conversation end\n\n7:29 EAT: The Cranes are finding it hard to possess the ball in Guinea's half.\n\n7:25 EAT: GGOOOOOAAAAAALLLLLLL......\n\nGUINEA 1-0 UGANDA\n\nCaptain Ibrahimah Traore scores from a free-kick.\n\nThe ball goes through the feet of the wall.\n\n7:21 EAT: In Tamale, hosts GHANA lead TOGO, 1-0. Goal by Majeed Waris\n\n7:19 EAT: The Cranes surive another cross from Sory Conte. Onyango clears the goalkick.\n\n7:15 EAT: Uganda's Godfrey Walusimbi is having night mares. He is very busy.\n\n7:12 EAT: Cranes right-back Isaac Isinde is down in pain. He must have felt pain from an elbow. Taken off for treatment.\n\n7:07 EAT: Only five minutes played and Guinea have had two shots at goal.\n\n7:06 EAT: Ibrahima Traore's left-foot shot goes to Denis Onyango's hands. Early intent.\n\n7:04 EAT: And Idrissa Sylla's long range effort declares the intentions for Guinea are maximum points tonight. GUINEA 0-0 UGANDA\n\n7:02EAT: Senegalese referee Malang Diedhiou gets action underway in Casablanca. GUINEA 0-0 UGANDA.\n\n7:00PM EAT: The Cranes beat Guinea 2-0 in the first leg in Kampala and are only a point away from qualification. Guinea has conceded in all their fixtures contrary to the Cranes who have managed two clean sheets so far.\n\n7:00PM EAT: The Cranes beat Guinea 2-0 in the first leg in Kampala and are only a point away from qualification. Guinea has conceded in all their fixtures contrary to the Cranes who have managed two clean sheets so far.\n\n6:59 EAT:The anthems are done at the Stade Mohammed V in Casablanca.\n\n6: 48 EAT: Its Match day 6 in Group E of the 2015 Afcon Qualifier. Second-placed Uganda (7 points) is away to Guinea in the final pool match. A draw earns the Cranes a ticket to dine with the continent's football aristocrats in Equatorial Guinea next year.\n\nCranes coach Micho Sredojevic makes two changes from the team that beat Ghana on Saturday at Namboole.\n\nUGANDA X1: Dennis Onyango (GK), Isaac Isinde, Godfrey Walusimbi, Savio Kabugo, Andy Mwesigwa (Cpt), Tonny Mawejje, Geoffrey Kizito, Farouk Miya, Kizito Luwagga, Brian Majwega & Geoffrey Massa."
