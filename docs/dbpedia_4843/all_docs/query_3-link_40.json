        "text": "Mali’s trajectory during the period under review has been mainly influenced by the conflict in its central and northern regions, resulting in significant increases in the number of deaths over time. Violence and instability continue to pose the greatest threats to democracy and a liberal market economy. The country’s resilience has been undermined by a decade of violence, prompting its citizens to resort to drastic measures.\n\nThe suspension of Mali’s flawed democracy has further paralyzed the country. A first coup in 2020, followed by a second one in 2021, in which the same military junta ousted a civilian transitional government, has led the country toward increasing authoritarianism. Since coming into power, the military junta has continuously attacked freedom of speech, imprisoned numerous civil society leaders and intensified human rights violations while conducting military operations.\n\nThe National Transition Council, intended to function as a legislative assembly, has been unable to act as a counterpower despite the junta’s appointment of several civil society members. Additionally, the transitional government has yet to fulfill its commitment to an election timetable, established after six months of regional sanctions in July 2022. So far, concrete actions have not been taken to implement this timetable.\n\nPolls promised for February 2024 are unlikely to occur then, while the junta’s refusal to rule out its participation in the election raises questions of legitimacy. Democratic norms are at stake because the junta has weakened all institutions, particularly the justice system, creating uncertainty about a return to a normal constitutional order. Restrictions on civic space have rendered civil society unable to influence the government. The exception to this are religious leaders, who have emerged as the sole group capable of mobilizing followers without limitations.\n\nThe transitional government struggled to keep the country afloat. Mali’s economy suffered from the 2020 COVID-19 global pandemic, with its annual GDP growth shrinking by -1.2% in 2020. Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) sanctions and poor governmental planning further damaged the economy, which was already suffering from instability. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine resulted in increasing inflation in Mali because the country depends on cereals and fertilizers from Ukraine. Under military rule, the country returned to more isolationist policies and turned its back on its traditional allies, notably France and the United States, while aligning with Russia and demonstrating hostility toward its neighbors Senegal and Côte d’Ivoire.\n\nIts rapprochement with Guinea and Burkina Faso – two countries that endured coups – is a temporary alliance of convenience but has not replaced Mali’s cooperative and committed partners, with which Mali shares a common currency and a customs union. Both are important given that Mali is in a landlocked position. Its isolationist political rhetoric makes security partnerships fragile. Mali’s recent alliance with Russian security providers resulted in the withdrawal of European military support and strained relations with Western bilateral donors. The government has significantly restricted the ability of the Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) to fulfill its mandate, raising doubts about the mission’s survival and increasing the prospects of instability.\n\nThe transitional government has taken steps to improve the business environment by updating the mining code and implementing new investment policies. However, some of these reforms do not demonstrate a commitment to a liberal economy; instead, they signal to the business community a willingness to renegotiate deals based on political objectives.\n\nThe government has launched several investigations into corruption and embezzlement against the previous president’s relatives, which were perceived more as politically motivated than a genuine commitment to integrity. Several corruption scandals, particularly regarding the allocation of subsidized housing to the family of the transitional prime minister, reveal how institutions are being exploited for political purposes. The deterioration of the rule of law has resulted in the removal of various checks and balances, replacing due process with threats.\n\nMali’s reputation as a model of democratization has recently been tarnished. Several gains since the 1991 transition have been stymied by an increasingly authoritarian military junta, acting as the transitional government since 2020.\n\nIn 1991, Mali became a textbook case of how a coup can end in a functioning democracy. At the time, after 23 years of a brutal military dictatorship, a junta seized power following weeks of violently repressed protests, which resulted in the deaths of hundreds. Within a few months, political parties were permitted to compete freely in a fair election, while an emerging civil society enhanced political debates.\n\nThe challenges were manifold – newly elected President Alpha Oumar Konaré had to contend with years of economic neglect, empty state coffers and lack of basic services. He successfully attracted support from bilateral and multilateral donors, notably the IMF’s Heavily Indebted Poor Countries program in 1999. His successor, Amadou Toumani Touré, secured roughly $540 million in debt relief in 2005. The policies of the two successive governments jettisoned years of political and economic isolationism. Mali embraced a liberal economy, implementing economic reforms, including the privatization of several dysfunctional public companies and better regularization. These reforms led to the GDP, in 2015 constant dollars, growing from $4.69 billion in 1991 to $11.36 billion in 2011. Despite this growth, Mali remained one of the world’s poorest countries, ranking at the bottom of the World Development Index. Economic and political reforms were limited by essential governance issues, with the education and health sectors underperforming.\n\nStill, Mali’s politics were based on consensus and co-optation rather than accountability and legitimacy, which caused frustration among those not represented in the political system. In 2008, insecurity became a severe threat to the country’s stability as al-Qaeda-linked groups increased their activity and several kidnappings of westerners occurred in northern Mali. In 2009, a reform of the family code was abandoned after Islamist groups initiated protests and increased their influence in political discussions. Historical marginalization of northerners led to a clash when Tuareg fighters seized weapons following previous rebellions that had ended with political settlements that the government never fully implemented. On March 21, 2012, a month before the presidential elections in which the incumbent, President Touré, was not a candidate, a coup brought a junta into power. The chaos in Bamako led to a military collapse in the north, with two-thirds of Mali’s territory falling under the control of jihadists who expelled Tuareg groups, which had initially launched the conflict. The transition faced several hiccups, and no solution was provided for the northern problem. In January 2013, a French-led mission helped Mali regain its sovereignty and facilitated the return of democracy.\n\nPresident Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, who was re-elected in 2018, had a mandate to reform the fragile state but failed to do so, which meant there was no return to normalcy. President Kéita initiated several economic reforms, leading to an increase in foreign investments and various fiscal reforms. However, he was unsuccessful in resolving the most pressing issues. The 2015 Algiers Peace Agreement presented a significant opportunity to enact political reforms but quickly stalled as many sections of the agreement were never implemented. Additionally, security incidents in the north and center of the country increased exponentially, despite the presence of the United Nations Mission, MINUSMA. Meanwhile, there were allegations against the president and his close supporters of corruption, embezzlement and nepotism. In addition, several claims of fraud during the 2020 legislative elections led to mass street protests. After weeks of contestation, a military junta, marking the fourth in Mali’s history, ousted the president and seized control.\n\nAfter pressure from the West African organization, ECOWAS, a transitional government was established but then overthrown on May 24, 2021, when the original coup leaders regained control.\n\nThe state’s monopoly on force is challenged in certain regions of the country, as the 2015 Peace Accord, which was supposed to re-establish this monopoly, remains challenged because its implementation stalled.\n\nThe Malian state has not fully controlled its entire territory since the 2012 military collapse in the north. The state’s monopoly on the use of force is further eroded as the crisis deepens. It now shares its monopoly with a plethora of armed groups operating throughout the country. These include two umbrellas for armed groups, the Coordination of the Movements of the Azawad (CMA) and the Plateforme, as well as several non-terrorist armed groups that have not signed the peace agreements. In central Mali, several militias, despite supporting the government’s agenda, challenged its control rather than supporting the return of strong state institutions. Although the armed forces are present in the north (which represents about two-thirds of the country) and in the center, they have not been able to secure these parts of the country.\n\nInternational actors have supported the return of the state monopoly on the use of force after the French-led Operation Serval in 2012. The 2021 coup d’état introduced a new administration that decided to seek new partnerships, alienating a decade of relations with European and U.N. partners, and therefore causing several contingent withdrawals. The withdrawal of the French force, Barkhane – operation Serval’s successor – as well as limitations to the U.N. forces, have yet to be fully understood, but early assessments indicate that terrorist armed groups, notably Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) and the Islamic State-Sahel Province (ISSP) now control a large part of northern Mali. Attacks in October 2022 in the Menaka Region by the ISSP and the Boni Blockade in July 2022 by the JNIM demonstrate the inability of the Malian armed forces to control vast territories of its state. Meanwhile, the JNIM and ethnic militias have increased their influence in central Mali. The Malian security forces have conducted some retaliation expeditions, with Russian support, but have slowly lost control of entire regions.\n\nThe legitimacy of the nation-state is rarely questioned among the majority but is questioned among minorities located far from the center of power.\n\nThere are no official statistics on the ethnic fabric of the country. About 50% of the population are Mandingo, which includes the main ethnic group, the Bambaras, as well as the Soninke and the Malinke. Other groups include the Fulanis (about 18%), the Voltaic (about 12%), the Songhay (6%) and Tuaregs and Arabs (10%).\n\nWhile the Bambaras dominated the south, the north, which is much less populated, is predominantly composed of Songhay, Tuareg and Arab, populations that experience a sense of marginalization from Bamako. Calls to revive Azawad, the northernmost territory in the country, as an independent state have increased in the last few years because the 2015 Algiers Peace Agreement was not fully implemented. Northerners, especially Malians of Tamasheq origin, express a sense of marginalization from the central government and formed armed groups to fight it. Lack of progress in the implementation of the accord has led armed groups to increasingly voice secessionist rhetoric.\n\nSeveral northerners still struggle to have their citizenship recognized but are now able to receive birth certificates, which would allow them to register as citizens. While there are no laws or processes to deny them citizenship, the absence of the state (or the delays in the state’s return since the 2012 rebellion) remains a significant factor in preventing some citizens from receiving recognition of their civil rights.\n\nBy law, Mali is a secular state. The separation of church and state is enshrined in the constitution. However, the reality is that Mali’s constitution only pays lip service to secularism, since religious leaders wield significant influence over government affairs. In Mali, a predominantly Muslim country, the social, religious and political spheres are heavily intertwined. Shariah, or Islamic law, is not directly followed, but the rights of individuals largely adhere to Islamic principles. Matters pertaining to inheritance, parentage, baptism, marriage and funeral ceremonies are governed by Islamic law. It is worth noting that the word “Shariah,” which is often pronounced in Bamanankan as [sà.rì.ya], has been adopted into that language to simply mean law and regulation, devoid of any Islamic connotation.\n\nThe main religious leaders – the president of the High Islamic Council, Sufi Chérif Ousmane Madani Haïdara (spiritual leader of the Ançar Dine Association, not to be confused with the terrorist group Ansar Dine); the former president of the High Islamic Council, Mahmoud Dicko; and Chérif of Nioro, the “Guide” of the Hamalliyya/Hamawiyya Sufi Brotherhood – have traditionally played a significant role in the public and political sphere. They have effectively established themselves as a conservative force capable of influencing political decisions and imposing a social order that engages the entire society. From the regime of Amadou Toumani Touré (2002 – 2012) to that of Ibrahim Boubacar Keita (2013 – 2020), all public confrontations between the state and Islamic organizations over social reforms, such as the reform of the family and personal codes, have resulted in victories for Islamic actors.\n\nWhether the three mentioned leaders form an alliance or are opposed to each other is influenced by their individual interests. They may collaborate to back a political figure, or they may be at odds with each other in their selection, particularly during elections. However, in general, they unite on matters pertaining to religion or the defense of Muslim values. For instance, Imam Mahmoud Dicko and Chérif Ousmane Madani Haïdara – who are ideologically opposed, recently urged their followers to take to the streets in an official protest against an anti-Islamic video.\n\nThe 2020 coup followed multiple protests throughout the country about the unfairness of the 2020 legislative elections and was meant as a first step toward political transition. In May 2021, a coup within a coup was the effective end of an attempt at implementing a civilian-led transition. Since then. the military junta has increased its powers, muting any opposition voices and naming a transitional legislative body. The Transition Council members were selected by the junta in an attempt to project a veil of legitimacy; they are not representative of the population and remain a highly consultative body whose influence over state processes remains minimal. The junta has missed every deadline to introduce the effective return of constitutional rule and the organization of elections. There are no set dates yet for elections, and the junta does not make this a priority.\n\nMeanwhile, the last general elections, legislative ones in 2020, had several irregularities and instances of electoral fraud, while many voters could not vote due to the security situation. The electoral commission faced significant logistic shortfalls, which undermined its ability to ensure smooth operations. Complaints from political parties and candidates were ignored, while international observers also condemned several issues affecting the transparency and the fairness of the process. In the Gao Region, allegations of ballot stuffing led to the unilateral annulment of votes from several polling stations, the constitutionality of which remains unclear.\n\nThe irregularities during the 2020 elections were a major reason for the protests that eventually led to the coup d’état, with the military entering into play.\n\nSince the coup on August 18, 2020, Mali has been ruled by a civilian-military transitional government, with the military predominating in key government positions. The military junta was officially dissolved in January 2021. The strong militarization of the administration began with the second coup d’état (the coup within the coup), which occurred on May 24, 2021, overthrowing the transitional president, Bah N’Daw, a retired military officer, and the diplomat Moctar Ouane, who was serving as prime minister.\n\nSince then, several incidents have caused the consolidation of power by the five members of the junta as the prefects and regional governors – who are the heads of the regional executive – are military. Colonel Abdoulaye Maiga, minister of territorial administration, served only temporarily as prime minister before Choguel Maiga returned to his post.\n\nThere are also military personnel directing several services. For example, the directors of the international airport, the Gabriel Touré University Hospital and the National Health Insurance Fund, among others, are all military personnel. Initially, the junta offered some positions to a coalition of opponents, the June 5th Movement–Rally of Patriotic Forces (M5-RFP) umbrella. However, leaders who did not comply with the desires of the junta were slowly discarded. The creation of a transitional legislative body, the National Council of Transition, was meant to increase popular representation. Nevertheless, the junta appoints all the council’s members, whom they can reshuffle at will. In October 2022, they added 26 new council members.\n\nPresident Assima Goita assumed power without any input from democratically elected officials. The junta has arrested opponents and initiated investigations into influential figures from past regimes, including former Prime Ministers Soumeylou Boubeye Maiga (who died in custody) and Boubou Cissé. It has also detained numerous civil society figures and restricted freedom of speech. Additionally, several individuals were compelled to flee the country, such as long-standing opposition member Oumar Marico, who had exposed human rights violations defense and security forces committed against civilians.\n\nFreedom of expression faced multiple threats in 2022. The authorities have threatened or closed several media outlets. Both the 1992 constitution and the 2022 draft constitution protect freedom of expression. Despite this, the military junta has aggressively attempted to curtail freedom of speech. Libeling a state official is a criminal offense. The radio host, Mohamed Bathily, was arrested in December 2020 and later found guilty of insulting the head of state and members of the judiciary.\n\nSeveral media have been banned. Djoliba TV News had its license suspended in November 2022 for broadcasting a commentary deemed too critical of the government. Malian journalist Malick Konaté has faced threats for his investigative work on groups close to the transitional government, who refuse to protect him. For having contributed to a report broadcast on the French television channel BFM TV, deemed too critical of the Malian army, Konaté was subject to threats that forced him to leave the country. Many journalists are either censored or choose self-censorship, so that they will not have problems. Media outlets that do not adhere to the official discourse fear repression, leading to a decreasing plurality of opinions in the public sphere.\n\nForeign journalists are no longer able to work freely in the country. French media RFI and France 24 were banned from airing in Mali in April 2022. In February 2022, French journalist Benjamin Roger, whom authorities granted a visa but refused accreditation, was expelled from Mali for not having proper documentation. Senegalese journalist Mamadou Sylla was arrested in July 2022. All accredited foreign journalists based in Mali had their accreditations revoked.\n\nThe authorities have arrested several bloggers and social media users for posting critical messages, while several pro-junta online activists have attacked critics.\n\nThe 1992 constitution remains valid, despite the transitional government initiating the process of writing a new one. According to the draft that has already been made public, the new constitution should guarantee the same civil rights as the previous constitution. The draft constitution is still under discussion. There is strong opposition in the country among some political organizations, which state that the task of adopting a new constitution should not be left to unelected leaders. There are also members of the Muslim religious class who want secularism totally banned from the new constitution. In early 2023, a commission set up by transitional President Assimi Goita completed the first draft. Another commission was set up thereafter to work on the first draft with the aim of making it more inclusive.\n\nIn practice, there are multiple violations of civil rights and the fundamental rights listed in the constitution. For example, economist and civil society activist Étienne Fakaba Sissoko and opposition leader Oumar Mariko were both arrested for criticizing the government. The government has curtailed free speech and freedom of assembly, leading to several unlawful arrests by the state security services. The absence of the state in parts of northern Mali and its severely limited authority in several regions of central Mali mean that there are no mechanisms to protect civil rights.\n\nThe armed forces during anti-terrorist operations in central and northern Mali have committed civil rights violations, including extrajudicial killings, torture and arbitrary arrests. Hundreds of civilians were killed during operations in Moura by the armed forces and Russian Wagner operatives in March 2022. Security forces are rarely prosecuted for civil rights violations. Not all citizens have the same rights. Women face significant legal barriers, notably in terms of inheritance.\n\nThe 2020 and 2021 coups have threatened fiscal stability in Mali. Over the past decade, Mali has maintained robust cooperation with the IMF, World Bank and other international donors. However, the coups challenged these relationships. The World Bank has suspended operation, while aggressive anti-Western rhetoric from the Malian junta has caused several donors to reduce their support. This includes France, which suspended “public development aid” to Mali in 2022. In July 2022, Mali temporarily defaulted on its debt but immediately repaid it once sanctions were lifted. The transitional government has struggled to maintain economic stability, leaving international fiscal organizations worried about the sustainability of Mali’s public finances.\n\nTotal debt service reached $292 million in 2021 – a historical record – and is projected to increase in 2022. Public debt reached $9.0 billion in 2021, accounting for 51.94% of the country’s GDP, with an external debt of $6.0 billion.\n\nIn 2022, Mali did not recover from the economic contraction COVID-19 caused. The budget deficit reached XOF 273.2 billion in September 2022, compared to XOF 127.86 billion in September 2021. This is because fiscal revenues decreased by 12.55% in the same period, while expenditures only decreased by 1.7%. To bridge the gap, the government initiated a sovereign bond campaign.\n\nSince 2020, Mali has implemented a number of reforms aimed at improving fiscal practices. In 2019 and 2020, the country enacted a new mining code and an implementing decree, which enhance fiscal oversight and modernized the government’s primary revenue stream. Additionally, in 2020, Mali adopted new investment regulations, and a new tax code and procedures book. These measures introduced mandatory registration for all taxpayers, updated procedures for Value Added Tax (VAT) payments, and digitized tax returns and payments. These initiatives are crucial to achieving better control over fiscal affairs.\n\nMali’s constitution ensures property rights and has a significant body of law to protect acquisitions, benefits, use and sales of property. In practice, however, defending these rights is challenging. One major obstacle is the reputation of the courts, which are known for corruption. Its corruption earned Mali a ranking of 137th out of 180 countries on the Transparency International Corruption Perception Index in 2022, placing it at the bottom.\n\nDefending property rights is difficult for citizens in Mali. Additionally, land registries are limited to a few urban areas, and their inefficiency is a well-known result of resource shortages and bureaucratic burdens. Moreover, the majority of Malians lack official ownership documents. Officially allocating land to a specific individual is unusual there. Several Malians may possess legitimate land titles for the same parcel of land simultaneously. In particular, land disputes can escalate into violence, particularly in rural regions where traditional land rights govern access rather than a well-defined legal framework.\n\nMali’s National Land Agency (Direction Nationale des Domaines et du Cadastre) is responsible for land administration. The land code was amended in October 2021 to streamline land title processing by establishing a unified office for all procedures. Although the new system seems to improve legal safeguards for rural agricultural communities, giving them a means to assert their land rights, pastoralists see it as unjust because it does not address their rights to access water sources. Additionally, this policy bestows all unattributed land to government ownership and eliminates prefectural and gubernatorial authority over land.\n\nThe government created the Malian Center for the Promotion of Industrial Property (CEMAPI) to implement a legal regime to protect property rights that includes the World Trade Organization’s agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property. Two agencies are responsible for protecting intellectual property rights: CEMAPI and the Malian Office of the Rights of the Author.\n\nMali’s social safety nets are limited by the government’s low revenues and the state’s lack of capacities. Moreover, 10 years of conflict have limited the presence of the state in central and northern Mali and have had a significant impact on the delivery of social services in those regions. This contributes to Mali having one of the world’s lowest life expectancies of 59.7 years of age.\n\nMali spent 1.9% of its GDP on health spending, placing it among countries with low spending (ranked 170th out of 181 countries). A national network of dispensaries offers health services across the entire country but is underfunded and inaccessible to many Malians.\n\nA national health insurance scheme, the Assurance Maladie Obligatoire, provides state-subsidized basic health coverage at an affordable premium to both employees and civil service agents. It is also available to employees in the private sector and the informal sector, as long as they are subject to making contributions. However, for many Malians in conflict or rural areas, subscribing to and participating in this scheme is difficult.\n\nOther social programs have limited outreach to Malians. The Institut national de prévoyance sociale offers a retirement scheme for both civil servants and contributing private sector workers, thus excluding the majority of Malians. Although there are some initiatives aimed at youth employment and poverty alleviation, these programs often encounter significant funding challenges due to the government’s substantial budget deficits since the 2020 coup.\n\nThe government has initiated various social housing programs, which are supposed to benefit all socio-professional categories. However, these programs primarily focus on urban areas, and there have been cases of corruption in the allocation process. Approximately 5,000 new subsidized housing units were made available in 2022, exclusively within Bamako.\n\nPublic education remains problematic. The post-2012 crisis further weakened an already-fragile school system, resulting in the closure of thousands of schools and a shortage of qualified teachers. Additionally, the security crisis has caused over a thousand schools to close in the central region alone, leaving many children without any other educational opportunities. A lack of educational facilities in rural regions exacerbates the urban-rural divide. In certain areas, the only educational option for children is Quranic school.\n\nSolidarity remains the primary source of social safety for Malians, especially in rural areas where the state is absent. Social safety also depends to a great extent on NGOs and humanitarian actors, with the result that the population has no systematic support.\n\nMali’s economy has remained resilient despite a decade of conflict, primarily because its core economic activities are located in the south, far from the multidimensional crisis in central and northern Mali. The country has maintained an average GDP growth of 4% since 2012. However, since the 2020 coup, Mali’s economic performance has shown signs of lagging due to ECOWAS sanctions and inadequate economic planning, which have gradually weakened the economy.\n\nWhile macroeconomic perspectives are not too bleak in light of the context, the economy faces significant challenges: a high youth unemployment rate, a low industrialization rate, energy shortages, dependency on several imports and an undiversified economy. The economy’s primary drivers are cotton production, agricultural goods and gold extraction.\n\nMali faced weaker-than-expected growth in 2022, according to the African Development Bank. GDP growth was expected to increase by 3.2% in 2022 but only grew by 2.1%. In 2021, GDP per capita grew by 0.1%, revealing a slow recovery from COVID-19. Meanwhile, its public debt reached a historic high, anticipated at 55.9% of GDP by the end of 2022, but far below the regional average of around 70%. Exports decreased by 6% in the second and third quarters of 2022 compared to 2021.\n\nMali’s primary economic challenge, in addition to its political crisis, is its insufficient response to rising global prices. As a landlocked country heavily reliant on grain and fuel imports, Mali is ill-prepared for inflation, which reached a staggering 13.9% in July 2022. The average inflation rate for the remainder of 2022 is expected to be around 8%, significantly higher than the 3.9% yearly average in 2021, as reported by the Mali National Institute for Statistics. Inflation has been highest for staple foods, with a yearly increase of 3.9% in 2021. Furthermore, national grain production declined by 10.5% in 2022, intensifying pressure on an already-strained market due to restrictions on imports from Ukraine and Russia. In terms of foreign direct investments, Mali attracted $640 million in 2021.\n\nThe economic prospects for 2022 were buoyed by a strong cotton harvest of 800,000 tons in 2021/22, which allowed the country to reclaim the title of the biggest African producer of cotton.\n\nThe latest data on unemployment dates from 2021, when the rate was 7.7%. It is inaccurate because the vast majority of Malians work in the informal economy.\n\nMali’s education system has significant structural shortages that predate the current multidimensional crisis. Even before the 2012 conflict forced school closings in central and northern Mali, Mali had some of the world’s worst statistics for education. It currently scores 0.283 on the U.N. Education Index, just above its neighbor Niger, and has one of the lowest literacy rates, at 30.8% in 2021. Barriers to universal access to education are high, with unequal access for girls and rural populations. Mali’s national budget allocated 3.8% of the national GDP for education in 2021, but funding remains insufficient and dependent on foreign aid.\n\nTeachers’ absenteeism and frequent strikes have become a significant barrier to quality education, delaying students’ graduations and increasing drop-out rates. Some students stay in the same class for three consecutive years, mainly because of strikes. In February 2023, the first-year students at the Institut Universitaire de Gestion of Bamako went on strike for having spent three years at that level.\n\nThere is an average of one teacher per 41 students in primary education. Significant shortfalls in the public system force parents to seek alternatives in the private sector, which are a viable option only for urban families with the means to afford them. In rural and peri-urban areas, Quranic schools the only schools available to many parents and their children.\n\nMali’s education system has a high attrition rate, with few pupils graduating and advancing to the next level. About 76% of children are enrolled in primary education, but only 49% finish elementary school. Enrollment at the secondary level was 41% in 2019. Tertiary level enrollment was 5% in 2019 (7% for men and 3% for women). Only 2% of Malians hold a university degree. High unemployment among graduates also discourages students from pursuing higher education.\n\nResearch and development are underfunded, accounting for only 0.2% of Mali’s GDP. The government has created several institutions, notably the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique et Technologique, as well as several agencies devoted to agriculture and health issues, like malaria or sickle cell disease. However, these agencies’ budgets are dependent on international aid and partnerships. There is no budget for industrial or technological research and no government policy to develop this sector.\n\nMali’s government faces several severe structural constraints, poverty being the most significant one.\n\nMali faces extreme poverty, making it one of the world’s most fragile countries. With a score of 0.428, Mali ranks 186th out of 190 countries on the 2021 Human Development Index. About 42.3% of its population lives in extreme poverty. 47.69% of its population is 0 to 14 years old, according to estimates from 2020, making the population’s median age 16. With 41.07 births per 1,000 population (2022 est.), it has the world’s fourth-highest birth rate. Its current population of 20 million is projected to reach 27 million by 2030.\n\nRural poverty is a major issue. Roughly 90% of the country’s poverty is in populated southern rural areas, which results in a high rate of urbanization. In 2022, 46.2% of Mali’s population lived in urban areas, while facing an annual population growth of 4.57% (2020 – 2025 est.). Low education rates, high illiteracy and a considerable gender gap mean that youth have few work opportunities outside the informal economy.\n\nMali is a landlocked country. Due to poor road infrastructure, goods must travel slowly, limiting trade connections. Only 35.1% of the population has access to electricity, which costs $0.17/kWh to produce, one of the most expensive kilowatt hours in the world. According to the Ministry of Hydraulics, in 2022, only 40.0% of Malians had access to drinking water. A low internet penetration rate, 29.9% in 2022, excludes it from the global digital economy.\n\nClimate change is a serious issue in an arid country, the north of which the Sahara crosses. Rising temperatures, droughts, unstable rainfalls and floods are substantial threats, particularly because 80% of the population lives off agriculture, and 95% of that population depends on rainfall for their livelihood.\n\nMali faces conflicts that, since 2012, have introduced violence into its central and northern regions. In October 2022, the UNHCR estimated that armed conflicts had caused 13,000 Malians to become refugees abroad and 440,432 to become internally displaced persons.\n\nMali scores 27th among 54 African countries on the Global Health Security Index. While its health system remains fragile and health services are nonexistent in most of the north of the country, it displayed resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMali’s democratic awakening after the 1991 coup led to the creation of a vibrant civil society. Over 60,000 civil society groups are currently registered. They support various sectors of society: education, health, poverty alleviation and so on. Officials often consult civil society leaders from across the country. They participate in governance and are almost always consulted on significant decisions concerning life in the nation: for example, for the Dialogue National Inclusif (Inclusive National Dialogue) in 2019 during Ibrahim Boubacar Keita’s presidency and on the Assises Nationales pour la Refondation de l’Etat (National Conferences for the Rebuilding of the State) organized by the current transitional government in 2021.\n\nMali has had several success stories, notably the Coordination des Associations Féminines et ONG du Mali, a national umbrella organization for all of the women’s NGOs and associations. In certain parts of the country, NGOs are palliative in the absence of the state, providing humanitarian support and aid. For many Malians, NGOs are the sole resort beyond their own communities.\n\nThe inclusion of civil society leaders into the transitional parliament is an essential recognition of the social role of civic associations in Malians’ lives. Nevertheless, since the 2021 coup, civic space has shrunk as the military junta took steps to reduce their freedom of action. The authorities have targeted Tabital Pulaaku, an NGO defending Fulani rights, particularly two of their leaders who spoke out about human rights violations.\n\nAfter political differences between Mali and France, Mali’s authorities enforced a ban on French funding in December, increasing pressure on NGOs to generate paperwork. Meanwhile, several NGO leaders have been arrested or investigated by authorities, often arbitrarily. The military authorities particularly target human rights activists and associations, seeing their activities as targeting the armed forces.\n\nMali faces a multidimensional conflict that threatens every aspect of his society; this conflict is political, social, ethnic and religious.\n\nSince gaining independence, Mali has experienced multiple Tuareg insurrections. Although the north is home to less than 10% of the country’s population, it accounts for about two-thirds of the state’s territory and is believed to be rich in resources. The central government’s neglect of the north has contributed to Malian Tueregs’ marginalization and poverty, fueling their fight against a government they perceive as prejudiced. The most recent rebellion, starting on January 17, 2012, triggered a series of events that resulted in Salafi jihadist groups taking control of the entire northern region.\n\nWhile a French-led operation in 2013 allowed a partial return of the state government to the north, the region faces constant violent attacks by terrorist groups. The Tuareg armed independence groups signed a peace agreement in 2015, which has yet to make a difference as implementation remains slow. The U.N. mission, known as MINUSMA, has become the world’s deadliest peace mission.\n\nSince 2015, central Mali has also experienced attacks by a Salafi jihadist group called the Katiba Macina composed mostly of Fulani fighters. The group is led by Fulani preacher Amadou Kouffa. The Katiba Macina is affiliated with the Jama’at Nasr al-Islam wal-Muslimin. The increasing number of terrorist attacks carried out by the Katiba Macina has created a civil conflict in which ethnic communities are now in conflict with each other, particularly the Fulani and the Dogon. The Dogon accuse the Fulani of having close ties and collaborating with the jihadists. Additionally, Mali’s armed forces and their Russian auxiliaries are frequently accused of committing human rights abuses, further exacerbating the cycle of violence.\n\nIn southern Mali, the coups of 2020 and 2021 brought a military junta to power. It seized control of all aspects of power and established a transitional charter while drafting a new Malian constitution. The junta has appointed a transitional government and a parliament known as the National Transitional Council. Although doubts remain about the junta’s commitment to honoring it, there is an electoral calendar, and preparations for a new constitution are underway.\n\nIn central Mali, there has been a steep increase in ethnic violence. The arrival of the private Russian military company Wagner has fueled tensions between communities, with the government siding with certain communities over others. Meanwhile, the lack of progress to implement existing peace agreements has increased tensions, causing northern armed groups to abandon peace efforts and prepare for war.\n\nAt the end of 2022, it was unclear when the country would return to democracy. The military authorities have increased the number of arrests, clamping down on civic space and limiting freedom of speech. Mali’s current government’s aggressive political rhetoric has alienated several former partners, including Côte d’Ivoire, France and Denmark – isolating the country on the international stage – since more than half of its budget comes from international aid.\n\nMali’s transitional government struggles to set strategic priorities. The country faces an acute political crisis, which re-enforces short-term interests and authoritarianism over coherence, sustainability and a strategic agenda. Elections are postponed until 2024.\n\nOn August 18, 2020, a military junta seized power, deposing elected President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, known as IBK, after weeks of street protests. On May 24, 2021, the same military junta took control again from a civilian transitional administration and tightened its grip on power. Junta leader Assimi Goita then became president of the transitional administration.\n\nDespite initially proposing several reforms, the government has prioritized military spending. A lack of economic planning threatens the progress of reforms. The government also laid out three other priorities: a new social pact, fighting corruption and education reforms, but again, it has taken no concrete steps to realize them.\n\nThe June 2021 nomination of a civilian prime minister, Choguel Kokalla Maïga, a leading figure of the June 5th Movement–Rally of Patriotic Forces (M5-RFP), the umbrella group behind the anti-IBK protests, was perceived as a sign of openness. His strategic priorities were abandoned, however, after he had a stroke and a junta member assumed his interim position.\n\nTransition President Assimi Goita, during that time, further increased his powers. Sanctions from ECOWAS and significant national budget gaps choked the country’s economy, forcing the administration to reconsider its priorities. Renegotiation of mining deals has increased economic uncertainties, as gold remains the government’s primary source of revenue. A good cotton harvest in 2022 offered a lifeline to the national economy, but not enough to ensure that it’s strong. Meanwhile, the government’s populist and nationalist rhetoric alienated several partners, creating crises that weaken its agenda.\n\nThe National Council of Transition was created in December 2020 as a non-elected legislative body to support the transitional government. At first, it was inclusive, including civil society activists, political opponents, armed group leaders and several atypical members. It voted for a new constitution that was not significantly different from the previous one. The council plays a relatively limited role in shaping governance. The expulsion of Issa Kaou Djim for criticizing the government is perceived as an example of its lack of independence and subservience to the transitional government.\n\nSince 2020, Mali’s transitional government has struggled to implement its policy priorities, which are undermined by political instability. Beyond this, poor economic planning and ECOWAS sanctions, which reduced revenues, have undercut the current transition government’s spending capacity.\n\nIn June 2021, the transitional prime minister, Choguel Kokalla Maiga, set as priorities: 1) improving security; 2) political reforms; 3) organizing free and fair elections; 4) reducing government expenditures; 5) introducing morality into public life; and 6) ending impunity. He was criticized, even by the transitional president, for a lack of progress on any of these points and was under constant pressure from a member of the military junta who sought to impose his own political priorities. Nevertheless, Prime Minister Maiga always publicly enjoyed the support of Transitional President Assimi Goita. However, the president of the National Transitional Council, one of the five members of the junta, Colonel Malick Diaw, criticized Maiga and summoned him before the council to describe the progress made by his government.\n\nThis is not an isolated case. Political instability and frequent changes in administration have constantly undermined policy agendas. Mali has had ten different prime ministers in the last decade and two coups since 2020.\n\nThe conflict has also reduced the government’s capacity to govern Mali’s entire population. It still lacks authority in several regions of the country. The 2015 Algiers Peace Agreement’s implementation stalled, delaying the complete return of the government to the northern part of the country, while increasing violence in the center has crippled the government there.\n\nThe government does not demonstrate policy learning since the current political crisis does not allow public policy debates to occur.\n\nThe National Transition Council is a non-elected legislative body composed of various actors with different experiences. This variety could potentially guarantee diversity in policy debates. However, when such debates occur, there is no indication that they influence governmental policies. Efforts to draft a new constitution represent well the inability to learn, as the current draft contains only a few innovations compared to the 1991 constitution and fails to engage with citizens’ desires.\n\nThe 2020 coup ended a regime that was often described as controlled by a rent-seeking elite that surrounded President IBK. Several reports accused him and some of his close collaborators of corruption, nepotism and lack of understanding of national issues. His regime did not succeed in finding solutions to Mali’s biggest problems, including insecurity and poverty.\n\nThe current regime is selective regarding whom it listens to and declined from “partly free” in 2018 to a “not free” country in the Freedom House 2022 index. While the 2020 coup was enabled by weeks of civil society mobilization, there have been several signs of civil space shrinking.\n\nMeanwhile, the military junta has arrested journalists and forced the closure of media outlets. Previously, the Malian press was relatively free. Initially, several high-profile intellectuals joined the transitional government in 2021, showing a strong desire to reform the country. Most of them left a few months later, as the five original putschists concentrated power in their hands and muted divergent voices.\n\nPolicy coherence has been problematic since the 2020 coup. The administration struggles to maintain its objectives. For example, the budget of the National State Security Agency (the intelligence services) increased from XOF 13 billion to XOF 113 billion in 2022, without any explanation from the government.\n\nMany observers saw this increase as a masked way for the government to pay the private Russian military company, Wagner, without creating a dedicated budget line in the public finances (so as not to leave a trace).\n\nThe security crisis prevents the administration from fulfilling its work on most of the country’s territory. COVID-19 affected the country’s finances, while the political crisis affected the government’s capacity for economic planning. The budget deficit limited the government’s ability to attain its objectives, leaving several departments underfunded while favoring security forces.\n\nMalians witnessed purchases of military equipment without receiving any figures as to their cost. No political debate has been held about these purchases. This could present an opportunity for corruption, as no control is possible at present.\n\nMeanwhile, the transitional government does not communicate its objectives, leaving doubts about the coherence and involvement at the governmental levels, particularly the civil service.\n\nThe junta’s nationalist rhetoric has created tensions with regional coordinating bodies, particularly ECOWAS and WAEMU, two significant economic and political organizations that coordinate Mali’s trade and monetary policy. Mali’s withdrawal from the G5-Sahel, which was created in 2014 to ensure regional cooperation on security, has also undermined the country’s ability to fight against terrorist armed groups.\n\nAfter the transitional government alienated its international partners in 2022, the World Bank temporarily stopped disbursing funds, while traditional bilateral donors like France and the United States decreased their financial support. The government banned French NGOs from working in Mali in 2022 and created bureaucratic constraints on all NGOs, therefore stopping the work of organizations that were the only service providers in certain regions.\n\nThe transitional government has issued multiple declarations about fighting corruption since it took power, but its integrity mechanisms are generally ineffective for fighting decades of corruption. Moreover, the fight against corruption appears, in some respects, to be instrumentalized as a means for the junta to remove all “disturbing” actors who may constitute threats to the longevity of its rule.\n\nMali has multiple institutions to audit and fight corruption: the Cour des Comptes, the Office of the Auditor-General, the State Inspectorate of Public Services and the Central Office for the Fight against Illicit Enrichment. The Office of the Auditor-General is the most important institution in the country, launching investigations into public management; an investigation can be launched by the auditor or by demand of any citizen or institution. The auditor’s reports are often critical of the administration and independent. There are multiple audit reports per year and multiple investigations. In 2021, the Office of the Auditor-General published 11 reports, including one focusing on the government’s COVID-19 response.\n\nThe other institutions are less independent than the Office of the Auditor General. The Cour des Comptes is an organ of the Supreme Court, the role of which is to ensure the regularity of public accounts. The Central Office for the Fight against Illicit Enrichment plays several roles in promoting and fighting corruption. None of these institutions has a prosecution role. Government officials are rarely prosecuted for corruption.\n\nWhen Malians took to the streets in 2020, a significant reason for their anger was alleged corruption by IBK. His administration faced numerous corruption scandals, notably ones regarding a presidential plane, military equipment and other procurement issues.\n\nSince it took power, fighting corruption has been one of the junta’s priorities. Several high-profile members of the deposed government were arrested on corruption allegations, notably former Prime Minister Soumeylou Boubeye Maiga. The justice system also issued multiple warrants, often with respect to investigations initiated by several institutions. While they have substance, these allegations are nonetheless perceived as politically motivated.\n\nMeanwhile, the transitional government is also accused of corruption, embezzlement and favoritism, notably regarding subsidized housing allocation and government contracts. The military junta has threatened journalists and media outlets attempting to publicize these allegations.\n\nThe legal framework to prevent corruption remains weak. Only the president must declare his assets by law but does not have to do so publicly. The current transitional president has not declared his assets, and there have been no consequences. Other government officials and civil servants are not required to declare their assets.\n\nPolitical parties receive public funding, but there is a lot of secrecy concerning how this works. Moreover, parties do not disclose private funding, and the regulatory framework concerning election funding has significant gaps.\n\nMali’s trajectory since 2020 has been one of increasing isolationism. The junta’s aspirations for reform, especially in improving security and fighting corruption, have not led to major changes, while economic and political development have stalled. The transitional government committed to the return of democracy in 2024, but its policy agenda until then remains unclear and changes monthly. Rent-seeking and political score-settling take precedence over sustainable and sound strategies.\n\nPrior to the 2020 coup, Mali’s political leadership developed multiple partnerships to ensure economic development and maintain good relations with donors, while dependency on aid constantly increased. The 2020 coup changed these dynamics, sending contradictory signals after the transitional government initiated multiple conflicts with bilateral and international donors. The government announced that it would subject international assistance to a review. Some donors curbed their funding, notably the French Development Fund, one of Mali’s most significant bilateral donors, and the World Bank. Varying year-on-year, Mali receives foreign aid that amounts to roughly 12–15% of its GDP, more than half its national state budget.\n\nDespite having made security a priority, the government has made little progress in this area, as 2022 was the deadliest year ever in Mali. There is no strategy to build peace. The 2015 peace agreement has stalled. The government established a new partnership with Russian partners on security. This created a political crisis that brought the end of the French Operation Barkhane, leading to the withdrawal of about 5,000 soldiers and the virtual end of the European Union Training Mission. The government took a hostile stance against the U.N. mission, the MINUSMA, making several aggressive declarations and increasing operational barriers.\n\nThe increasing connections with Russia mean Mali has turned back on European and American donors, which have significantly decreased the amount of aid they provide. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has led to increasing inflation in Mali, which is dependent on imports of Ukrainian cereals and fertilizers.\n\nMali’s reforms to the mining and investment codes, as well as initiatives to reform the tax codes, which have yet to be fully implemented, have been welcomed as necessary steps for improving the business environment.\n\nSince 1991, successive Malian administrations have maintained good relationships with the international community, despite demonstrating a lack of clear short-, medium- and long-term goals. Mali’s post-coup transitional government has seriously undermined these relationships. The new government’s actions have made the country a less reliable and credible partner than it was, the objectives of which are incomprehensible to the international community.\n\nIn September 2022, the interim transitional prime minister gave a speech before the U.N. General Assembly in which he blamed the United Nations, France and several of Mali’s West African regional neighbors for destabilizing the country and supporting terrorist groups. This declaration was one of many from a transitional government that has alienated many bilateral and multilateral partners. Several donors stopped support to Mali after receiving threats.\n\nThe transitional government has adopted an aggressive stance toward regional organizations, particularly the WAMEU and ECOWAS, threatening withdrawal. In 2022, ECOWAS imposed sanctions on Mali for six months; they were lifted in July after Mali committed to an electoral timetable. Its relationships with its neighbors remained tense.\n\nMali arrested 46 Ivoirian soldiers on arrival at the airport, accusing them of being mercenaries coming to destabilize the country. The Côte d’Ivoire described them as participants in the U.N. mission. The soldiers were liberated in January 2023, but diplomatic tensions between the neighbors remain acute. Several analysts saw this as retaliation against Côte d’Ivoire for not deporting important high-level members of the previous Malian government, who sought refuge in Côte d’Ivoire during the coup, and also for the alleged role of Ivorian President Alassane Dramane Ouattara in ECOWAS sanctions against Mali.\n\nMali’s relationship with several bilateral and multilateral actors has reached a low point, abruptly ending a decade of collaboration intended to stabilize the country and combat insecurity. The country imposed air restrictions on the MINUSMA and introduced obstacles to staff rotation, leading to announcements of withdrawal from Germany, the United Kingdom and Côte d’Ivoire. MINUSMA is unable to pursue investigations in most of the regions suffering from conflict and faces several other obstructions from the transitional government.\n\nDiplomatic tensions with France led to the expulsion of the French ambassador and the end of the French military operation Barkhane. The European Union also called off its military operation, Takuba, and downsized its military training mission, EUTM, after Mali imposed restrictions that led to the expulsion of Danish soldiers.\n\nThe military junta has also undermined Mali’s commitment to international norms, especially human rights. Mali accused the MINUSMA and several NGOs of supporting terrorists because they published reports condemning Mali’s armed forces for alleged human rights violations. The state still collaborates with the International Criminal Court and the international judicial system. Mali has continued to be active in international climate change and environmental forums, playing an active role in COP27 in 2022.\n\nMali has attempted to develop new partnerships, particularly with Russian actors, but also with two neighbors that are also ruled by military juntas: Burkina Faso and Guinea.\n\nThe 2015 peace accord has stalled under the transitional government. The government called for a review of the agreement and has not honored its previous engagements with signatories.\n\nMali’s most urgent problem remains its security crisis, which formerly was in the north but now also includes the center. At the same time, several terrorist attacks in the south in 2022 suggest that violence is approaching the capital. The transitional government has prioritized security and has taken several steps to reverse the worsening situation. Meanwhile, the 2015 Algiers Peace Accord has yet to be implemented, leaving signatory armed groups at a standstill. Peace and reconciliation should be high on the agenda, as armed groups need to be part of an effective response to terrorism.\n\nThe government must carry on with the transition and ensure a return to democracy. Thus far, commitment to organizing fair and transparent elections across the entire national territory has been weak. No progress has been made in implementing the electoral timeline announced in July 2022. There are suspicions that the military junta members will attempt to put themselves on the ballot, despite reassurances that they will not.\n\nThe restoration of democratic norms is the initial step to curbing the increase of authoritarian measures and the erosion of government accountability, as all state institutions are gradually losing their significance and autonomy. The deaths of the deposed president, Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, and the primary opposition leader, Soumaila Cissé, pave the way for rejuvenating the political landscape, provided that subsequent electoral cycles adhere to a just and competitive process.\n\nThe shrinking of civic space is a significant threat to healthy political debates. An increasing number of government threats against civil society members have already muted powerful voices. The state must recommit to democratic values, not only respect electoral deadlines.\n\nThe next administration will need to bring the economy back on track. This begins with implementing sound fiscal policies to reduce current deficits and address the country’s rapidly growing debt. The isolationist measures advocated by the transitional government have proven unsustainable for a landlocked country.\n\nMali needs strong cooperation with its neighbors, as it shares a common customs and monetary union. The transitional government has adopted a hostile stance toward its closest partners. Increasing its ties with the Guinean military junta has allowed Mali to pursue economic objectives. However, the limited infrastructure connecting the countries and Mali’s lack of integration with Guinea mean that new allies cannot replace the durable, well-coordinated relations with the rest of the WAEMU.\n\nWhile the transitional government has improved the mining code and promised to enhance the business environment, it must keep that promise – especially with regards to the mining sector, which is the primary source of foreign investment. It also needs to commit to inclusive growth and offer sustainable opportunities, especially to women, who continue to be excluded from the economy.\n\nWith 65% of its population under 25 years old, Mali’s youth is one of its most important sources of capital. However, with high underemployment and a weak education system, the country has yet to tap into this strength and prevent it from turning into a ticking bomb. To address this issue, Mali must re-invest massively in training and infrastructure to increase opportunities for youth who are trapped between poverty and migration. Therefore, a new strategy is needed to specifically address the needs of both urban and rural youth, as well as young women.\n\nFinally, the judicial system has been cited as one of the weakest state institutions in Mali, plagued with accusations of corruption, partiality and inefficiency. Only residents in a few urban areas have access to the courts – a major trigger of conflict in central Mali. Malians need to regain trust in their judiciary institutions, from the lower courts that offer fair settlements in land claim issues to the highest level, which is capable of ending an electoral crisis."
