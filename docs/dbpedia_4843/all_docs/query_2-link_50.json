Corinna Jones <strong>Academy</strong> Public Affairs deputy direc<strong>to</strong>r A 1989 <strong>graduate</strong> of the U.S. Air Force <strong>Academy</strong> will <strong>pilot</strong> the <strong>STS</strong>-<strong>130</strong> <strong>mission</strong> <strong>to</strong> the International Space Station aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavor, currently scheduled <strong>to</strong> launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida Sunday. Col. Terry Virts Jr., an astronaut, fighter <strong>pilot</strong> and test <strong>pilot</strong> with more than 3,800 flying hours in more than 40 different aircraft, said the <strong>Academy</strong> played a significant role in preparing him for his Air Force career. “The <strong>Academy</strong>’s academic experience gave me a great background in engineering and taught me how <strong>to</strong> approach and understand real world technical problems,” he said. “The diverse classes we take — chemistry, physics, aero, astro — I have used at least a little bit of all of these in my career.” “More importantly, the <strong>Academy</strong> gave me training and experience in leadership, ethics and integrity — something many schools do not and something that is absolutely essential for any career as an officer and post- Air Force careers,” he said. The colonel said athletics also played a key role. “Staying in shape is a key part of any healthy life. The <strong>Academy</strong> got me used <strong>to</strong> staying active in lots of different activities — running, swimming, sports, skiing,” he said. “There’s no better place <strong>to</strong> prepare you as a ‘whole person’ than the Air Force <strong>Academy</strong>. It’s <strong>to</strong>ugh and not always fun while you’re there, but it’s worth it.” Air Force secretary <strong>to</strong> headline NCLS lineup By Ann Pat<strong>to</strong>n <strong>Academy</strong> Spirit staff The 17th-annual National Character and Leadership Symposium will feature presentations by Secretary of the Air Force Michael Donley and other keynote and concurrent speakers who will gather here Feb. 17-19 with cadets, faculty, <strong>Academy</strong> alumni, government employees and other university students.

He also attended the French air force academy, L’École de l’Air, in 1988 on an exchange program. NASA selected Colonel Virts <strong>to</strong> become a <strong>pilot</strong> in July 2000. His technical assignments include lead astronaut for the T-38 supersonic trainer jet, a Shuttle Avionics Integration Labora<strong>to</strong>ry test crewmember, Expedition 9 crew support astronaut and lead astronaut for appearances. He has worked as a capsule communica<strong>to</strong>r, or CAPCOM, through 11 space station expeditions and 12 space <strong>shuttle</strong> <strong>mission</strong>s, communicating directly with the station crew using the call sign “Hous<strong>to</strong>n.” Most recently, he served as the lead ascent and entry CAPCOM.

Following his graduation, he served as an experimental test <strong>pilot</strong> at of 1959, the <strong>Academy</strong> Class of 1974 and the 10th Air Base Wing. “The best leaders tell great s<strong>to</strong>ries — <strong>to</strong> illustrate, <strong>to</strong> inform, <strong>to</strong> share,” Major Nelson said. “At NCLS, we orient leaders <strong>to</strong> see themselves and their world differently, <strong>to</strong> see opportunities for character and leadership development and <strong>to</strong> emerge ... <strong>to</strong> being great leaders whose decisions and actions will shape a better future.” The round-up of speakers includes: — Secretary of the Air Force Michael Donley — Retired Gen. Lee Butler, former commander of U.S. Strategic Command — Retired Gen. Michael Hayden, former Tuskegee Airman dies Lt. Col. Lee Archer died of coronary complications at age 90.
