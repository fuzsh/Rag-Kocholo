        "text": "Many were wondering whether Terence Crawford would have any ring rust in his first fight since November 2021. The WBO welterweight champion knew he needed to make a statement in his hometown of Omaha, Neb. He did that, and then some.\n\nCrawford knocked out a game David Avanesyan in the sixth round Saturday night at the CHI Heath Center. The fight was produced by BLK Prime. It was the 10th Crawford fight in a row to end via finish. The champ now has 30 wins via knockout.\n\n\"I was just warming up in the earlier rounds,\" Crawford said after the fight. \"I just started picking up the pace, planting my seeds, and hit him with the hook. We knew what he was going to bring to the table, from orthodox to southpaw.\"\n\nCrawford was the aggressor throughout the contest. He landed pitch-perfect right hands, fighting through Avanesyan's defense. Avanesyan landed crisp shots in Round 2, and some observers may have even given him that round, but he would never gain another edge in the fight after that.\n\nMORE: How much money will Crawford make for Avanesyan fight?\n\nCrawford did his best Floyd Mayweather impression during the fight, landing shots while also showcasing great defense. In Round 4, Avanesyan landed a right and an uppercut but Crawford stormed back with body shots. With his front foot forward, Crawford landed open blows to Avanesyan's body.\n\nIt was clear that Crawford was getting into the head of Avanesyan as he jabbed away. There was cause for concern in Round 6 as the padding in Crawford's gloves began to come out. The fight continued, with no questions from Avanesyan's corner. As Avanesyan was going for a shot, Crawford countered with an uppercut and a right hook that put Avanesyan down for the count.\n\nIt was the sixth successful defense of the WBO title for Crawford. Up next is a potential bout against WBC, IBF and WBA champion Errol Spence Jr., who was in a car accident earlier in the night. He appears to be OK, per his social media.\n\n\"I'm a free agent,\" said Crawford, who left Top Rank not long ago and worked with BLK Prime to produce this fight. \"This is a one-fight deal. Hopefully we can go to the drawing board and hope for big fights in the near future.\"\n\nThe Sporting News provided live analysis from Crawford vs. Avanesyan.\n\nTerence Crawford vs. David Avanesyan live results, updates\n\nTerence Crawford knocks David Avanesyan out in return fight\n\nRound 6: The padding is coming out of Crawford's gloves, but the fight continues.
