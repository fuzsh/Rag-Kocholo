That can be a very difficult thing to do, but the new guys have really picked up on that along with the physicality of the game at this level.”\n\nHearing from a Newcomer\n\n\"For any freshmen there is an adjustment period, and we did a great job getting through that this. summer,” Bowen said. “We have gotten used to the speed of the game and have ramped things up. We have continued to do what we can do every day to get better. We are going to keep on getting better as we head into the season.”\n\nCowboys Heading to Cheyenne\n\nThe Wyoming Cowboy basketball team will hit the road for an intrasquad scrimmage with the Pokes heading to Cheyenne on Saturday, October 9.
