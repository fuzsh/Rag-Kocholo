        "text": "Caught a glimpse of a left-footed centre half called Jorrel Hato (16) playing for Holland, he's at Ajax currently. Think he captains both sides.\n\nSomething special about him IMO, would expect Ajax to hand him a full debut this season at some point.\n\nHarder to tell at this age, but looks one for the future.\n\nBen Doak that Liverpool signed from Celtic is an absolute cracker. Massive future.\n\nScotland will have a good side in the next 10 years or so.\n\nWe will still find a way to screw it up.\n\nLCB Micky Van de Ven with an assist as Wolfsburg continue their incredible form after the winter break.\n\nNiko Kovac's squad are smashing 2nd/3rd place Freiburg 4-0 in the 60th minute.\n\nVan de Ven just drew a penalty (which was converted) to make it 6-0 Wolfsburg over Freiburg.\n\nKovac switched Van de Ven over to LB when Lacroix subbed on for LB Paulo Silva @ 71'.\n\nIMO, Van de Ven is (presently) better than Bastoni and on par with Gvardiol, but he has a higher ceiling than both.\n\nLove what Kovac is doing at Wolfsburg.\n\nJhon DurÃ¡n FIFA 22 Feb 3, 2022 SoFIFA\n\nJhon DurÃ¡n (Jhon JÃ¡der DurÃ¡n Palacio, born 13 December 2003) is a Colombian footballer who plays as a striker for American club Chicago Fire. In the game FIFA 22, his overall rating is 55.\n\nI only just saw this post now but he just went to Villa and Iâ€™ll be excited to see how he does. I follow the Fire so watched his coming up last season and figured he needed another year before a team came calling. Physically heâ€™s well suited for the PL as heâ€™s big, fast, and powerful. Heâ€™s well composed with the ball at his feet, but heâ€™s not super creative either.\n\nCaught a glimpse of a left-footed centre half called Jorrel Hato (16) playing for Holland, he's at Ajax currently. Think he captains both sides.\n\nSomething special about him IMO, would expect Ajax to hand him a full debut this season at some point.\n\nHarder to tell at this age, but looks one for the future.\n\nHas been brought on from the bench for his full Ajax debut in a Cup match and has been on the bench 3 times this month in the league.\n\nWorth keeping an eye out for. Him and the massive PSG lad are probably the two best prospects as defenders I've seen in a long time.\n\nHere's a new one to add to the mix. Top 5 prospects in each position that you know of at lesser clubs than ours. Good to keep an eye on how these boys work out:\n\nRB\n\nAaron Wan-Bissaka (Crystal Palace)\n\nBenjamin Henrichs (Monaco)\n\nNoussa Mazraoui (Ajax)\n\nAchraf Hakimi (Dortmund on loan from Real Madrid)\n\nPedro Porro (Girona)\n\nCB\n\nBoubacar Kamara (Marseille)\n\nMalang Sarr (Nice)\n\nEder Militao (Porto)\n\nEvan N'Dicka (Frankfurt)\n\nDayot Upamecano (RB Leipzig)\n\nDM\n\nSander Berge (Genk)\n\nAmadou Diawara (Napoli)\n\nSandro Tonali (Brescia)\n\nArne Maier (Hertha Berlin)\n\nLucas Tousart (Lyon)\n\nCM\n\nFrankie De Jong (Ajax)\n\nRiqui Puig (Barcelona)\n\nYacine Adli (PSG)\n\nFran Beltran (Celta Vigo)\n\nFlorian Neuhaus (Monchengladbach)\n\nAM\n\nKai Haivertz (Leverkusen)\n\nBrahim Diaz (Real Madrid)\n\nDavid Brooks (Bournemouth)\n\nNicolas Pepe (Lille)\n\nGiorgi Chakvetadze (Gent)\n\nFWD\n\nMoise Kean (Juventus)\n\nMoussa Sylla (Monaco)\n\nLuka Jovic (Frankfurt)\n\nMatheus Cunha (RB Leipzig)\n\nPatrick Cutrone (AC Milan)\n\nThe ones I'd absolutely love to see us go for are Berge, Tonali, Puig & Chakvetadze from what I've seen. I'd also be keeping tabs on Dani Ceballos over in Madrid for the rest of the year as I think he has bags of potential.\n\nFinally we get a player from my list through the door. Happy with this one"
