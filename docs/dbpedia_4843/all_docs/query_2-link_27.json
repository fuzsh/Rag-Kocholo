        "text": "This blogger Artur Yanturin of Russia copied many of my blog teams. This blog was one of them. It was my Russia All-Time Team here. His team was written in 2020, but mine was uploaded in 2014. His Spartak Moscow All-Time team entry of was published in October 2020, but mine was uploaded in 2017. His entry of the Dutch-German rivalry between Real Madrid and Barcelona was written in 2020, but mine was uploaded in 2014. He also copied many many of my blog entries.\n\nHis Facebook and Instagram\n\nZaire World Cup 1974\n\nPlease also see myAll-Time World Cup Team Index.\n\nGreatest Players from each African Nation\n\nI did all-time teams for Algeria, Morocco, Egypt, Ghana, Senegal, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, South Africa and Nigeria. The rest of Africa is divided into Northern Africa(including Sudan) and Sub-Saharan Africa. This is the Sub-African All-time team without those countries and the Northern African countries. Of course, I also did an Africa All-Time Team.\n\nBesides the teams that I have done individual all-time team, Zaire(DR Congo), Togo and Angola are the only African countries that had qualified for a World Cup Finals. Both Togo and Angola did it in 2006. Zaire (DR Congo), Zambia, Sudan, Congo and Ethiopia also won at least one African Cup of Nations.\n\nTogo at the World Cup in 2006\n\nTeam\n\nGK: Bruce Grobbelaar (Zimbabwe)\n\nBruce Grobbelaar made 628 appearances for Liverpool in 13 years. He was considered among the best England-based keepers of his generation and a legend with Liverpool. He won the 1984 European Cup, 6 English league titles and 3 FA Cups. Born in South Africa, he moved to Rhodesia as a child. He played one game for Rhidesia in 1977. From 1980 to 1998, he was capped 32 times by Zimbabwe, but with several years where he was absent for the national team.\n\nBruce Grobbelaar\n\nGK: Kazadi Mwamba (Zaire/Congo)\n\nHe led his country to victory in the 1968 African Cup f Nations. However, he was probably remembered for Zaire's poor performance at the WC Finals in 1974. At the 1974 World Cup, in a group game against Yugoslavia, Kazadi conceded three goals in the first 20 minutes and was substituted. Kazadi was the first goalkeeper to be changed for a reason other than an injury or physical problem in a World Cup.\n\nGK: Denis Onyango (Uganda)\n\nIn South Africa, Onyango played witth Supersport United, Mpumalanga Black Aces, and Mamelodi Sundowns. With Mamelodi Sundowns, he won the 2016 CAF Champions League and took part in the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup. He was named the 2016 African-based African Player of the year. He was also ranked as the tenth best goalkeeper in the world in the list for 2016, compiled by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics.\n\nRB: Fousseni Diawara (Mali)\n\nStarting his career in Parisien club Red Star 93, he moved to AS Saint-Étienne in 2000 and made his debut against Rennes in September. On January 30, 2008 he joined Panionios. On September 10, 2009 he signed a 1-year deal with FC Istres and comes from Greek football club Panionios F.C. He signed for AC Ajaccio on 16 June 2010. He had over 50 caps with Mali.\n\nCB/RB: Djené (Togo)\n\nDjené began his career in Beinn and Cameroon. In August 2014, Djené went on a trial at Spanish Segunda División side AD Alcorcón. Since 2017, he had played for Getafe. He was named in the La Liga Team of the Season for the 2017-2018 season. At the time of writing, he is about to break Getafe's appearance record. He is the first African to captain a LaLiga side. He earned 69 caps for Togo.\n\nCB: Lobilo Boba (Zaire/DR Congo)\n\nLobilo played for AS Vita Club, where he would win the 1973 African Cup of Champions Clubs. He was in the Zaire squad that won the 1974 African Cup of Nations finals. He made several appearances for Zaire in 1974 World Cup qualifying and appeared in one 1982 World Cup qualifying match. In 2006, he was selected by CAF as one of the best 200 African football players of the last 50 years.\n\nLobilo Boba\n\nCB: Julien Kialunda (Zaire/DR Congo)\n\nBorn in 1940, Julien Kialunda won the 1972 African Cup f Nations. However, he was not a part of Zaire's ill-fated team at the World Cup Finals in 1974. He played his club football mainly in Belgium. He had a successful stint with Anderlecht. He was a key member of Anderlecht during one of their most successful periods. He won three league titles. He is considered one of Africa's greatest defenders in the 1960's.\n\nCB: Dick Chama (Guinea)\n\nChama was Zambia's defensive stalwart from the late '60s to the mid '70s and formed a formidable central defence pairing alongside Dickson Makwaza and was part of Zambia's squad during the country's very first CAN outing in 1974 and made the official CAF team of the tournament. Chama was voted Zambian Sportsman of the Year in 1975 and after retirement, he coached several club sides as well as the national team.\n\nSW: Bwanga Tshimen (Zaire/DR Congo)\n\nBwanga Tshimen was nicknamed \"Black Beckenbauer\". He is widely considered one of the best defenders from Africa. He won the 1973 African Footballer of the Year. He was a part of Zaire's ill-fated team at the 1974 World Cup in Germany, in which Zaire played poorly, but he helped Zaire to win the African Cup of Nations. For club football, he played for TP Mazembe back home.\n\nLB: Reinildo Mandava(Mozambique)\n\nReinildo Mandava began his football career with Ferroviário da Beira and GD Maputo. He was with Benfica and Sporting da Covilhã and Belenenses before he moved to French club Lille and made a name. He was on the UNFP Ligue 1 Team of the Year for the 2020–21 season as Lille won the league. In 2022, he joined Atlético Madrid. Since 2014, he was capped 33 times."
