        "text": "SALT LAKE CITY — Andrei Kirilenko might be moving back into his Salt Lake City home soon.\n\nIt’s “very possible” that the small forward, who spent the first 10 seasons of his NBA career in Utah, will be traded to the Jazz by the Brooklyn Nets later this month, a source told the Deseret News.\n\nIn exchange for Kirilenko, the Jazz would send seldom-used forward Jeremy Evans and offseason acquisition Toure’ Murry to Brooklyn.\n\nESPN.com’s Marc Stein first reported the possibility of this trade last month.\n\nThe deal wouldn’t take place until at least Dec. 15, which marks the first day teams can trade players who signed in the offseason."
