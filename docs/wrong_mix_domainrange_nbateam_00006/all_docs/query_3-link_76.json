        "text": "Imagine turning on the CBS news one night and, instead of Dan\n\nRather sitting there, in all his square-jawed solemnity, there\n\nwas some bony Russian kid with a spiky hairdo. Then imagine\n\nquickly surfing in search of Tom Brokaw--steady old Brokaw--only\n\nto see, occupying his chair, a baby-faced Puerto Rican with an\n\nearring. ¬∂ In a sense, this is what's happening to Utah Jazz\n\nfans. For 17 years Salt Lake City was the domain of John Stockton\n\nand Karl Malone, the city's own Rather and Brokaw--or, to use a\n\nsports analogy, its Joe Montana and Jerry Rice. Night after night\n\nthe stoic, efficient Stockton threw the perfect bounce pass to\n\nthe stoic, chiseled Malone as the Mailman roared down the wing\n\nlike one of the big rigs he is so fond of. That's almost 1,400\n\ngames of the same pick-and-roll plays, of Stockton pulling up\n\nfor his shoulder-launched jumper, of Malone seemingly rooted at\n\nthe foul line, his knees tilted inward and his lips mouthing\n\nwords that no one could decipher. Seventeen years of edging\n\nthisclose to a title before exiting at Almostville.\n\nNow, in the wake of those two Dream Teamers comes 22-year-old\n\nAndrei Kirilenko, a power forward with swizzle-stick arms, and\n\n24-year-old Carlos Arroyo, a vagabond point guard. So little was\n\nexpected of the new duo and their young, anonymous teammates that\n\nmost publications--this one included--picked the Jazz to finish\n\nlast in the Western Conference, especially after the free agents\n\nit signed to offer sheets over the summer, Los Angeles Clippers\n\nforward Corey Maggette and Atlanta Hawks point guard Jason Terry,\n\nwere retained by their clubs. ESPN.com columnist Frank Hughes\n\nwent so far as to predict that Utah would break the alltime\n\nrecord for futility (nine wins) set by the Philadelphia 76ers in\n\n1972-73.\n\nSo what in the name of Hot Rod Hundley is going on at the Delta\n\nCenter? Behind the coaching of a rejuvenated Jerry Sloan and the\n\nplay of Kirilenko and Arroyo, Utah was 9-6 through Sunday and had\n\nalready beaten such Western playoff contenders as the Houston\n\nRockets, the Portland Trail Blazers, the Phoenix Suns and the\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves (twice). Those victories are almost\n\nsecondary to the new crew's other major accomplishment: making\n\nJazz basketball exciting to watch. On sports radio shows and\n\nInternet message boards some fans have begun expressing a\n\npreviously sacrilegious sentiment--that the team may be better\n\noff without Stockton and Malone.\n\nTake last week's 83-76 home victory over the Rockets. Even with\n\nArroyo sidelined by a sprained left ankle, Utah players ran the\n\nfloor, hustled like crazy, threw alley-oops for dunks, swatted\n\nYao Ming's shots against the backboard and--in a definite\n\nStockton and Malone no-no--had the gall to be animated during a\n\nfourth-quarter scoring burst. \"I'll tell you, I miss those two\n\nguys horribly,\" says Jazz strength and conditioning coach Mark\n\nMcKown. \"But these kids are fun to watch, aren't they?\"\n\nNo longer are Utah games as formulaic as an episode of Three's\n\nCompany. The core system is the same as it's been for a dozen\n\nyears, but in the past the Jazz ran almost exclusively a\n\none-guard front to take full advantage of Stockton's\n\ndecision-making; now it's a two-guard look that creates more ball\n\nmovement and more touches for everybody. (Exhibit A: Four players\n\nare averaging between 11 and 18 points.) And while about 25 of\n\nUtah's approximately 75 set plays are still predicated on the\n\npick-and-roll, those 25 don't see as much action as they used to.\n\nNow, says Kirilenko in his fractured English, \"Coach calls plays\n\nfor who is scoring. Before, we stand and watch Karl and John. Now\n\neverybody is involved.\"\n\nThe 61-year-old Sloan is clearly enjoying his new team. \"The fun\n\npart of coming to work every day for me is finding a way to win\n\nwith the guys we have,\" he says. \"Physically we may be\n\novermatched, but you can still play basketball if you do it as a\n\ngroup.\"\n\nLong known for his old-school values and ref-directed tirades,\n\nSloan has mellowed this season, reducing his sideline f bombs and\n\nplayer lambastings. \"It's a nice change,\" says center Greg\n\nOstertag, a frequent resident of Sloan's doghouse in years past.\n\n\"He'll still get on you, but now he'll back off and say what he\n\nlikes about what you're doing.\" Says Sloan, almost\n\napologetically, \"I don't like mistakes, but I also have to\n\nunderstand that these players have to grow some and I have to\n\nbite the bullet a little bit.\"\n\nBecause of Utah's surprising success, Sloan is suddenly a\n\nfront-runner for Coach of the Year, an award that, despite his 15\n\nstraight playoff appearances, he has never won. His take on the\n\nmatter is predictably Sloanian--\"I've never played or coached\n\nbasketball for a compliment,\" he says. \"I could give a s--- about\n\nthat\"--but others think the honor is overdue. \"Jerry always got\n\ncredit from coaches,\" says Houston coach Jeff Van Gundy. \"I don't\n\nthink fans realized his greatness like they realized Stockton or\n\nMalone's greatness.\"\n\nMinus those two, the closest thing this year's team has to a star\n\nis Kirilenko. Lithe and flamingo-legged at 225 pounds, the 6'9\"\n\nforward has flourished as a starter in his third season,\n\naveraging 17.3 points, 7.5 rebounds, 2.3 blocks and 1.9 steals at\n\nweek's end while shooting 51.1% from the floor and 88.0% from the\n\nfree throw line. Against the Rockets he not only made clutch\n\nbaskets, scoring 23 points on a variety of three-pointers, follow\n\ndunks and fearless drives, but also excelled on defense, swooping\n\nin from the help side to bat away shots three times and pinning\n\ntwo more shots against the glass. Two nights later, in a 98-81\n\nwin over the Seattle SuperSonics, Kirilenko had four steals and\n\nfour blocks to go along with 12 boards.\n\n\"Andrei's the unique NBA player who can dominate a game with his\n\ndefense,\" says Jazz assistant Gordie Chiesa, who believes that\n\nonly two NBA players have the ability to regularly thwart\n\nopponents' three-on-one breaks: Kirilenko and Ben Wallace of the\n\nDetroit Pistons, the two-time Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nThough he plays Malone's position, Kirilenko couldn't be more\n\ndissimilar from his down-home, tractor-driving predecessor.\n\nUnfailingly upbeat--a friend nicknamed him the Joker because his\n\nwide grin looked like Jack Nicholson's in Batman--Kirilenko gels\n\nhis hair in a Beckham-style faux-hawk and has a Russian pop diva\n\nwife, Masha, 30, whose song Sakharny (it translates as Sugary)\n\nwas a huge hit at home last winter. In the background of her\n\nvideo, Andrei flails away at a dance club, a performance that has\n\nearned him \"much joking,\" he says, from members of the Russian\n\nnational team. Explains Kirilenko sheepishly, \"I was tired, and\n\nit was dark. I just make dance moves.\"\n\nKirilenko is the product of athletic genes. His father, Gennady,\n\ncoached professional soccer and handball teams, while his mother,\n\nOlga, played for the national basketball team. He began his pro\n\ncareer as a 15-year-old for the local St. Petersburg team and was\n\ndrafted by the Jazz with the 19th pick in 1999. He arrived\n\nStateside two years later, and after initially feeling lost in\n\nthe U.S. and hating Salt Lake, Kirilenko--who describes himself\n\nas a homebody who likes to \"eat good and sleep good\"--grew to\n\nappreciate the city's small Russian community and subdued charms.\n\nThe feeling is mutual. Kirilenko has become a fan favorite,\n\nanswering to the nickname AK-47--his initials combined with his\n\nuniform number, a nod to the Russian assault rifle--and in many\n\nways becoming the face of the Jazz. After a morning practice last\n\nweek Kirilenko stuck around for three hours to tape a\n\npublic-service announcement with Masha for AIDS awareness that\n\nwill be aired in Russian, film a sequence of 25 trivia questions\n\nand answers for a Russian kids show and do a magazine interview.\n\nRather than rush through his obligations, he advised the American\n\nproducer on the difficulty of the trivia questions (\"Russians do\n\nnot know White Chock-late,\" he said of a question about Memphis\n\nGrizzlies point guard Jason Williams. \"Only five percent know\n\nOll-en Iverson!\"), joked during the filming (told to act serious\n\nby the producer, he stared into the camera and said, \"Hi, I'm\n\nSerious!\") and taught a reporter how to say beautiful in Russian\n\n(kra-SEE-va-ya).\n\nThe player who preceded Kirilenko in the makeshift studio was the\n\nother half of the new Jazz tandem, Arroyo, who was doing\n\ninterviews in Spanish. Starting with his season-opening 18-point,\n\n13-assist performance in a win over the Blazers, he has\n\ndemonstrated surprising quickness and scoring ability. The 6'2\"\n\nArroyo played his college ball at Florida International and spent\n\na year with a pro team in Spain before landing short stints with\n\nthe Toronto Raptors and the Denver Nuggets in the last two\n\nseasons. This is the first time he has played major minutes, and\n\nhe has made the most of them, averaging 15.5 points and 6.1\n\nassists. (While injured, he has been ably replaced by Spanish\n\nimport Raul Lopez, 23, yet another heady Utah playmaker.)\n\nArroyo's hot start, combined with his star turn on the Puerto\n\nRican national team over the summer--he led the squad to an upset\n\nvictory over Steve Nash and Canada to take the bronze medal in\n\nthe Olympic regional qualifying tournament--has made him into \"a\n\nMichael Jordan figure at home,\" says Jazz p.r. man Kim Turner.\n\n\"The Puerto Rican media call all the time. They call me, they\n\ncall him at home. Finally, I had to set up a biweekly conference\n\ncall. It was just too much.\"\n\nMulticultural, multinational, multiplying wins; it's easy to see\n\nwhy Utah fans are warming to their team's new incarnation. On\n\nJazzfanz.com, a surprisingly active message board devoted to the\n\nteam, the tide of opinion is changing. \"Watching this new Jazz\n\nhas been a lot of fun in ways that the old team never was,\"\n\nwrites one frequent poster who goes by tatermoog. \"With Stockton\n\nand Malone there was a predictability, both playwise and\n\ngamewise.\"\n\nThough many of the posts begin with a tribute to their departed\n\nheroes, there is a feeling in the air: Change is good. \"A group\n\nof people would have wanted Stockton and Malone to play until\n\nthey were 55,\" says David James, a local news anchor who hosts a\n\nSunday talk-radio show. \"But there's also a contingent that feels\n\nlike, 'We weren't going to get past the first round anyway, so\n\nwhy not change it up?'\"\n\nThat contingent was easy to identify after the Rockets game. They\n\nwere the ones who stayed after the victory, filing down to the\n\nlower deck to sit and listen as Utah players did courtside\n\ninterviews broadcast over the P.A. Upon finishing his, Kirilenko\n\nraised his arms to the crowd, eliciting a giant cheer, and then\n\nstrode off the court into the tunnel, grinning his goofy grin and\n\nslapping every hand proffered to him, a new kind of star for a\n\nnew era in Salt Lake.\n\nSI.com\n\nThe latest NBA news, scores and statistics, plus analysis from\n\nJack McCallum and Marty Burns, at si.com/basketball.\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: PHOTOGRAPH BY KENT HORNER/NBAE/GETTY IMAGES K RATION With the spindly Kirilenko (47) replacing the Mailman, Sloan (right) has found he can still deliver wins to the Jazz.\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: GREG NELSON [See caption above]\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: KENT HORNER/NBAE/GETTY IMAGES STOCK ANSWER Already a superstar in his native Puerto Rico, Arroyo is quickly making his point with fans in Utah.\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: ALEXANDER WILF FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE Masha is a bigger star than Andrei back home, where her singing puts his dancing to shame.\n\nTHEY'VE GOT SOME POP\n\nUtah's current roster had the fewest combined points in 2002-03\n\nof any team this season.
