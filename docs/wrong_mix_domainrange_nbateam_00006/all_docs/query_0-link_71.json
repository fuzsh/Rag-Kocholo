        "text": "It's hardly an original thought, but if the Detroit Pistons are ever going to fully commit to a rebuilding process, Richard Hamilton and Tayshaun Prince need to go.\n\nWith Ben Gordon and Austin Daye waiting in the wings, the team already has their future shooting guard and small forward ready to rock\n\nPrince's departure is coming, one way or another, before next season. He is in the final season of a five-year contract and will either be moved at the trading deadline or allowed to leave in free agency.\n\nPrince's expiring deal is a valuable bargaining chip in trade talks, but only if general manager Joe Dumars feels he's getting a valuable player in return. If not, the Pistons appear content to let his deal expire. The problem is, the mere subtraction of Prince's salary doesn't get the Pistons far enough under the cap to pursue a big-ticket free agent next offseason.\n\nIn this scenario, to be a player on the free-agent market next offseason the Pistons would also need to unload Hamilton's contract in a trade. (That alone might not be enough, but it's a necessary first step). Don't worry, I know I'm preaching to the Pistons fan choir, but it's always been far easier said than done.\n\nLooking around the league, focusing on depth charts, salary cap situations and trading pieces, it's challenging to find hypothetical trading partners potentially willing to take Hamilton off the Pistons' hands. But based on those factors, here are six teams that could fit the bill. Understand, this is purely speculation. Don't make the assumption any deal is actually on the table.\n\nChicago Bulls: Once Carlos Boozer returns from injury, the Bulls' most-glaring weakness in their starting lineup will be at shooting guard. As it currently stands, Chicago is relying on a rotation of Keith Bogans, Kyle Korver and Ronnie Brewer. All three were offseason acquisitions, and are probably best suited for backup roles.\n\nThe biggest hurdle would be what the Bulls could offer in return. They have no large, expiring contracts and obviously won't be parting with any young talent. It would have to be a multi-team deal with Chicago parlaying Luol Deng for expiring contracts for Detroit.\n\nIt should be noted that Deng, and his rather large contact, hasn't drawn much interest the other times the Bulls have dangled him on the market, so the odds of a deal here are pretty low.\n\nOdds: 100-1\n\nCleveland Cavaliers: Much like the Pistons, the Cavaliers would be thrilled just to make the playoffs this season. Replacing starting shooting guard Anthony Parker with Hamilton would certainly bolster the Cavs' slim hopes.\n\nThere are two things working in Detroit's favor here. First, Cavs owner, Dan Gilbert, is hellbent on proving his team can succeed without LeBron James. The idea of sneaking into the playoffs to battle James and the Miami Heat in the first round might be tempting concept. Stupid, but tempting.\n\nSecond, the Cavaliers have a $14.5 million trade exception from James' departure. That means Cleveland can add salary without giving anything back it return. As odd as it may seem, trading Hamilton for nothing wouldn't be a bad deal.\n\nOdds: 50-1\n\nIndiana Pacers: The Pacers are another team expected to be competing for one of the final playoff spots in the Eastern Conference. They have a decent young core with Danny Granger, Roy Hibbert and Darren Collison, and, at first glance, their shooting guard rotation doesn't seem too shabby with Mike Dunleavy and Brandon Rush manning the two. But there is reason to think they would be open to a change.\n\nDunleavy, the current starter, hasn't been a favorite of coach Jim O'Brien for his lack of consistency on both ends of the court. Rush has actually been pretty good since returning from a five-game, drug-related suspension. He's averaging 11.2 points and shooting 48.9 percent from the floor.\n\nStill, Rush, a lottery pick in 2008, has unperformed throughout his career. With two large expiring contracts in Dunleavy and point guard T.J. Ford, now is as good a time as any for the Pacers to make a move to improve their team.\n\nIs Hamilton that player? Probably not. But if the Pistons sweeten the pot a little, perhaps offering another piece, like Jonas Jerebko, they might be able to get the Pacers' interest.\n\nOdds: 40-1\n\nOklahoma City Thunder: After making the playoffs last year, and giving the Lakers a run for their money in a solid six-game series, the Thunder were a media darling coming into this season. Sitting pretty with an 11-5 record, Oklahoma City appears ready to meet those preseason expectations.\n\nEven with their hot start, the Thunder have room to improve on their roster, specifically at the shooting guard position. Hamilton would provide an immediate upgrade over Thabo Sefolosha.\n\nThe framework of a potential deal could look something like this, with the Pistons getting Selfolosha, along with the expiring contracts of Primoz Brezec and Morris Peterson.\n\nBeyond the statistical upgrade, Hamilton would provide some veteran leadership for the young Thunder squad. Oklahoma City could replace Kristic in their starting lineup with Nick Collison, with Wilcox providing frontcourt depth.\n\nAs for Summers, he could be used in a pinch as a defensive specialist. It's also not unreasonable to believe he would be capable of spelling Durant for 5-10 minutes a night. Durant is currently averaging a taxing 40.4 minutes a game.\n\nOdds: 30-1\n\nUtah Jazz: The Jazz, like the other teams on this list, have a noticeable weakness at shooting guard. The current rotation of Raja Bell and C.J. Miles just isn't getting the job done. Bell, the starter, has a player efficiency rating of 8.24, which is 63rd out of 69 qualifying shooting guards.\n\nThere are a couple of ways these teams could work out a deal. First, the big prize is Andrei Kirilenko, who has a $17.8 million expiring contract. But it's almost a given that the Jazz won't view Hamilton as a good enough return for the massive expiring deal.\n\nAnother possibility would be a swap for Memhut Okur. Again, it's a longshot, but the Jazz have been performing well in Okur's absence. They have wins over Miami, Orlando, Portland and the Lakers already this season. With the addition of Al Jefferson in the offseason, and the strong play of Paul Milsap, the Utah frontcourt is crowded.\n\nA package of Bell and Okur wouldn't help the Pistons free up money for the offseason, but would net them a big man who could defend the post, provide rebounding help, and heaven forbid, be able to set a proper screen for the Pistons' point guards.\n\nOdds: 40-1\n\nOrlando Magic: As indicated by their massive $94.7 million payroll, the Magic are committed to winning now. The question becomes, is their current starting two guard, Vince Carter, the best guy for the team? Carter's numbers are trending downward in almost every statistical category, including points, rebounds, assists, free-throw attempts and steals.\n\nThe good news for Orlando is Carter has a $17.5 million expiring contract, so if they team wants to retool their shooting guard situation, now would be the time.\n\nNo one will claim Hamilton is the sure-fire piece to get Orlando over the top, but he would likely fit in well with the Magic's system. Orlando's game plan is clearly centered around Howard operating down low and the rest of the team providing strong perimeter shooting. Hamilton's offensive game, which primarily consists of mid-range jumpers off of screens, would provide a nice balance to Orlando's half-court offense.\n\nOdds: 25-1\n\nThere are other teams that have the pieces to make a deal for Hamilton, but each seems like a bigger stretch than the six mentioned.\n\nTeams like New Jersey and New York have their eyes focused on a much bigger target by the name of Carmelo, and the addition of Hamilton to rebuilding teams like Minnesota, Toronto and Phoenix doesn't make much sense.\n\nOnce the Pistons are actually sold, and Joe Dumars' job limitations are lifted, there's little doubt he'll try finding a taker for Hamilton. After Hamilton's inspired overtime performance against the Wizards last week, a local media member joked that Rip's trade value was on the rise.\n\nIn reality it will take a several more performances like that one, and quite a bit of luck, if the Pistons are going to find a team interested in acquiring Hamilton this season."
