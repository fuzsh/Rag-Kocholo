        "text": "Marc Fleisher, Kirilenko’s agent, continues to explore overseas options for Kirilenko, who maintains he’s only interested in playing in Russia for either powerhouse CSKA Moscow or Spartak St. Petersburg, where Kirilenko began his basketball career in the Russian League at 15 years old. Back then, he was the youngest player to compete in the league. Kirilenko, 30, has spent the last 10 years with the Utah Jazz and has been negotiating full-time with both CSKA Moscow and Spartak — a team that does not compete in the renowned Euroleague.\n\nDavid Blatt on Kirilenko: “Have you ever been a horse trainer? Andrei is like a beautiful, wild horse. He’s best when he’s roaming around and running free. We ask him to play within the system, but honestly his best moments are when he’s doing what his heart and his instincts are telling him to do. Most of his great plays, they come not from the structure, but from the mind and the beautiful kind of talent he has. The lucky thing is that’s he’s not a selfish man, he is not a greedy player, he plays for the team.”"
