        "text": "When the weekend began, it seemed a matter of when — not if — the Nuggets’ Carmelo Anthony would be traded to the New Jersey Nets in a four -way deal. But Saturday, the discussions slowed considerably, according to a league source, as Denver mulled its potential acquisitions of Derrick Favors, Andrei Kirilenko and a draft pick. Asked if the deal was dead, the league source said, “You never can call it dead, but nothing is imminent.”\n\nA complex four-team trade involving Utah Jazz forward Andrei Kirilenko is in a holding pattern, multiple sources have told The Salt Lake Tribune. A deal centered around Denver forward Carmelo Anthony has moved forward far enough that Anthony has been presented with the trade and asked to approve it. But Anthony is still being sold on the idea of joining a young, rebuilding New Jersey team. Meanwhile, the teams involved — Utah, Denver, Charlotte and the Nets — are still engaged in talks that have a variety of well- and lesser-known players, as well as draft picks, potentially being moved around.\n\nOn Kirilenko’s future with the team and his $17.8 million expiring contract: I think the key thing is, Andrei’s got to play this year. He’s got to worry about his contract mentally. And we all understand that, and that’s part of it. If he plays well, it helps us, it helps him. We don’t talk to Andrei about his contract. But Andrei’s a key for us. And he’s a big key. I think we went 20-4 at one point last season when he was playing very well. And he’s been hurt the last two years. He’s a key. We expect Andrei to have a big season for us. … He’s on our team. If we can improve our team — and I’ve said this from day one — if we can improve our team, we’ll look at doing that. But we’re not looking to make any moves.\n\nWhen your nation’s best player is a flake, good luck building a national team around him. AK-47 is no product of a Red Army team, but the spoils of teenage sensation who got too much, too young. Just like what happens in the United States – and just about everywhere else in basketball now. Kirilenko comes and goes with the national team, and passed on playing in these world championships. Once, this was the biggest basketball tournament in Europe, but the best players from most of these countries are now sitting it out. When Kirilenko stayed home, so did Russia’s best point guard, J.R. Holden. Blatt needed Holden to handle the USA’s pressure on the ball and needed the wildly skilled Kirilenko to try to match Kevin Durant(notes). “With them, maybe we have a 1-in-10 chance to beat this U.S. team,” Blatt said. “Without them? Maybe it’s 1 in 100.”"
