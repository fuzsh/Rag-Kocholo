Jason Kidd told the media at practice that Andrei Kirilenko, who has missed the last six games due to an ankle injury, will return on Friday night against the Detroit Pistons.

The Nets are 3-3 without Kirilenko in the lineup since he injured himself against the Dallas Mavericks. Previously, the Nets said that he was targeting a return of "midweek," of this week.

Kidd also confirmed that Kevin Garnett will not play against the Pistons, which was expected since the Nets are targeting his return on April 8th or 9th when the team heads to Florida to take on the Miami Heat and Orlando Magic.. In fact, Kidd said KG will travel with the team and Kirilenko said the two victims of back spasms worked out together Thursday.

Kidd said he's happy about the progress Garnett is making on returning from back spasms.

Kidd is also "ecstatic" to have Kirilenko back in the lineup.

Everyone is ecstatic. Everyone.
