The app will prompt you to take a photo for verification and submit!\n\nNot automatically but you can easily save it by checking the save photo to camera roll button before submitting.\n\nIt may take up to 72 hours for your photo to be approved, or denied if it doesnâ€™t align with the task.\n\nReturn to the homepage and select which task you are completing. Repeat for each additional task.\n\nDifferent tasks require different levels of participation, so we award the 'heavy lifting' tasks with more points. REMINDER - we monitor check-ins so we will know! You will be immediately disqualified if you are gaming the system.\n\nA contest is a giveaway. This is NOT the same thing as accumulating points via check-ins and special tasks.\n\nRelaxxxx! The purpose of Restaurant Week is to enjoy amazing 3-course meals with your friends and family. The app will not allow you to check-in at two locations within an hour and 45 minutes to give you ample time to truly enjoy the venue!\n\nIf you are connected to the restaurant's Wi-Fi, try turning it off and using cellular data. If you are still having issues please reach out using the contact us form on our website.\n\nWinners will be notified via email and will be announced on Louisville's Restaurant Week Facebook and Instagram (with permission)."
