        "text": "Key findings:\n\nAt least 6,154 news organization workers, which includes both editorial and non-editorial staffers, were laid off beginning March 2020 through August 2021.\n\nAt least 100 U.S. news organizations have closed throughout the pandemic, although 14 of those same outlets have since resumed operations to varying extents.\n\nAnother 42 outlets were absorbed by publications through mergers and acquisitions.This brings the number of news outlet eliminations up to 128.\n\nLocal news outlets particularly struggled to stay afloat, running on thin margins and operating with significantly diminished staff.\n\nWhile the federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and emergency relief funds from tech platforms helped partially mitigate the impact of the coronavirus on news organizations, in some cases it delayed layoffs and other cutbacks.\n\nA lucky number of news organizations are emerging from the economic downturn in seemingly better financial positions now than they were prior to the pandemic. Others are staffing up or have big plans for workforce growth, although these efforts are less scaled at local news outlets.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn March 2020, The Tow Center for Digital Journalism began collecting data on U.S. newsroom cutbacks related to the COVID-19 pandemic and economic downturn. In the fall of last year, we turned more than 5,800 rows of data on individual cutbacks at news organizations into an interactive map that shows which newsrooms were affected across the country and how.\n\nNearly two years after COVID-19 first brought the U.S. to a standstill, the Tow Center is releasing data on news organization layoffs that shows the scale of an industry further devastated by the pandemic. By our count, 6,154 news workers have been laid off from at least 343 individual news outlets with an additional 35 news media chains that implemented chain-wide layoffs from March 2020 through August 2021.\n\n​​\n\nThese layoffs weren’t merely a reshuffling of workers across the industry. No facet of the news media workforce was unaffected, with freelance budgets cut at newspapers like the New York Post and Boulder Weekly, advertising and sales departments diminished, and editorial teams working in overdrive to cover a global health crisis with, in many cases, significantly fewer resources than before.\n\nMany news organizations used innovative strategies to stay afloat, like creating independent journalism funds, implementing tiered subscription models, and launching an array of newsletters and interactive mobile sites to engage readers more directly. Still, an alarming number of outlets across the country permanently closed, and entire offices were laid off. By Tow’s count, at least 100 outlets have closed at some point since March 2020, with just 14 later reopening in various capacities. Another 42 outlets were eliminated through acquisition by other publications, bringing the total number of eliminated outlets up to 128 at the time of publication.\n\nThe pandemic also impacted the news industry in uneven ways, often determined by a newsroom’s size and whether its coverage was national, regional, or local in scope. While waves of layoffs afflicted news organizations of all types, some are emerging from the later stages of the pandemic in better positions now than they were prior to COVID-19, primarily with subscriber growth, workforce size, and overall financial well-being.\n\nOverview\n\nAdvertising revenues dramatically dropped as the US faced deep economic uncertainty and in-person events were cancelled in March 2020. These circumstances disproportionately impacted traditional news media, such as newspapers and magazines, which historically rely on print advertising as their main source of income. At the same time, online traffic exploded, especially at the local level, as communities sought out information about a little-known virus spreading rapidly across the country. However, this online readership growth did not directly plug the financial gap as news organizations continued to struggle to monetize digital advertising in substantial ways.\n\nIn the early days of the pandemic, internship programs across the country were suspended at newsrooms like NPR, Washingtonian Magazine, and the New York Daily News, leaving many young journalists scrambling at the beginning of their careers. Some organizations later replaced portions of their newsrooms once filled with full-time staffers with freelancers who often don’t receive the same benefits. At the Cleveland Scene, for instance, two of the five staffers who were laid off in March 2020 were later brought back—one in editorial and another in sales—to do freelance and contract work respectively. Others at news organizations like the Golf Channel, which laid off staff in June 2020 due to corporate consolidation, were encouraged to reapply for a reduced number of positions at a later date. While many outlets told the Tow Center that they’ve since resumed hiring for full-time positions or even added additional ones, countless remain vacant with workflows consolidated.\n\nCOVID-19 aid programs and news grants\n\nThe federally-funded Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which provided loans to small businesses to cover employee expenses such as payroll, helped many local publications stay afloat. According to the Pew Research Center, nearly 2,800 newspaper companies employing 40,000 workers received a PPP loan from March to August 2020. The Sandpoint Reader, an alt-weekly in Idaho, told the Tow Center in an email that after advertising revenue dried up and the entire staff was laid off for a short time during the first few weeks of the pandemic, the loan program offered a “big boost” towards recovery. Publisher Matt Paxton of the News-Gazette in Lexington, VA told Tow in an interview last year that as soon as the newspaper received its federal loan money on April 4, 2020, he hired back the sports writer and copy editor who had been laid off a few weeks earlier.\n\nPPP funding only partially mitigated the pandemic’s impact on the news business. The Tow Center learned that, in one instance, a reporter who was laid off from the Henry Daily Herald in Georgia at the beginning of the pandemic was brought back in May 2020 after the newsroom received funding from the PPP, then laid off a second time once that funding dried up in July. The program officially ended on May 31, 2021, amid an ongoing pandemic that as of November 2021 has killed more than 750,000 Americans and continues to impact the economy.\n\nFacebook and Google also announced emergency funds for the news business. On April 7, 2020, the Facebook Journalism Project announced its COVID-19 Local News Relief Fund Grant Program and COVID Community Network Grant Program. A week later, the Google News Initiative followed suit with its own Journalism Emergency Relief Fund. In an analysis by the Tow Center for our ongoing platforms and publishers series, we found that Facebook and Google committed a combined $262 million to nearly 7,000 local newsrooms and fact-checking initiatives in direct response to the coronavirus pandemic. While these emergency grants were helpful for many of its recipients, it also deepened the news industry’s reliance on platform funding.\n\nSome news org growth during COVID-19\n\nThe pandemic, without a doubt, intensified the decades-long crisis in journalism as the news industry continues to grapple with building sustainable business models. But it also inspired experimentation, born of a fight to survive. And some news organizations are even entering a period of recovery with ambitious plans for the future despite the industry facing an existential crisis less than two years ago.\n\nIndependent and nonprofit news organizations were better positioned to survive a crisis due to diversified revenue streams and a larger dependence on foundation and individual giving. This sector has experienced rapid growth in recent years, with at least 266 independent, digital-native news outlets starting up in the last five years and a dozen or more nonprofit news outlets launching each year since 2008. In Ohio, for instance, nearly $6 million was recently raised to form a new nonprofit newsroom with a starting staff of 25 in Cleveland next year; just last spring, Cleveland’s alt-weekly, the Scene, as well as the Plain Dealer announced pandemic-related layoffs. According to the Tow Center’s own data on news organization cutbacks amid COVID-19, only a handful of nonprofits implemented cuts, and only one nonprofit newsroom in our database laid off employees. This is in step with the Institute for Nonprofit News’ latest index report, which found that staffing at nonprofit newsrooms “held steady, and even expanded by some measures” in 2020. Total employment in 2020 increased by about 17 percent compared to the previous year, which INN primarily attributed to donor growth.\n\nSome newsrooms, particularly at the national level, are coming out of the other side of pandemic-induced financial turmoil with big plans for work-force growth. In late September 2020, CNN shuttered Great Big Story, a short form video news hub launched in 2015. By February 2021, CNN’s parent company, WarnerMedia, had laid off hundreds of employees across more than a dozen of its subsidiaries. But now, the news behemoth is preparing for its latest venture, a news-video streaming service named CNN Plus, and is currently hiring more than 200 staffers for a spring 2022 launch—the largest hiring surge since CNN’s inception in 1980.\n\nGrowth is more sparse and less scaled across local and regional news markets. The Riverfront Times, an alt-weekly newspaper in St. Louis, told the Tow Center that despite initially laying off seven staffers in March 2020, they anticipate finishing this year with a larger editorial staff than they had prior to the pandemic. The Pulitzer-prize winning Kansas City Star announced in August 2021 that they’re doubling the size of their investigative team with nearly 12 additional reporters, less than a year after shedding its downtown office and closing its printing plant, which resulted in 124 print worker layoffs. And after years of consolidations by corporate owners like Gannett, which laid off at least 110 news organization workers from April to November 2020, some Gannett-owned community newspapers in Missouri are returning to local owners who plan to provide higher-quality journalism by staffing up their newsrooms.\n\nThe challenges of quantifying the scale of cutbacks\n\nMeasuring the impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. news industry as a whole is complicated in large part by how diverse the news landscape is. Widely varied factors like market size, business model, and ownership structure affected news organizations in uneven ways. While some news outlets got by on thin margins and others closed their doors permanently, there are news organizations now emerging from the pandemic in strong positions and with plans for growth. Taking all of these factors into account, and the many requests the Tow Center receives asking to quantify the pandemic’s impact on U.S. news markets, we have compiled a list of layoffs—a permanent type of cutback that directly impacts workers.\n\nNo matter how enticing it is for researchers, reporters, and readers to search for a number that can quickly convey the scale of a journalism crisis accelerated by the pandemic, no number can capture all of its complexities. Tow’s layoffs number, with all of the acknowledged shortcomings in our methodology below, attempts to quantify one way in which the pandemic has damaged the U.S. news workforce.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe Tow Center’s layoff numbers attempt to fill in some of the gaps other news media cutbacks figures have—publicly unavailable data, ambiguous definitions of layoffs and types of organizations counted, and loosely defined date ranges—with the understanding that our count also has limitations. We are publishing our findings in a listed format so that others can see how we arrived at our total. Our hope is that people will continue to contribute information on any layoffs that may be missing from our database.\n\nThese cutbacks were collected through various methods: Twitter announcements, media reports, press releases, WARN filings, self-reported submissions via Google form, databases generously shared with Tow, and original reporting. More than 200 combined emails were sent and phone calls were made to media organizations to inquire about and verify layoff numbers. Many in-depth interviews were conducted—primarily with publishers, managers, and staffers—to help fill in any numbers missing from our database. (At the time of publishing, we still have “unknowns” for 20 layoff entries, many of which were substantial cuts at large corporate chains.) Despite these painstaking efforts, these numbers are likely an underestimate of the total hit taken by the news industry’s labor force and may have changed since they were initially announced. And because much of our data relies on third-party sources, some of the figures may be erroneous despite our repeated efforts to verify them.\n\nTypes of workers counted\n\nOur layoffs numbers include all media organization workers, not just newsroom staffers. News organizations consist of more than just the editors and reporters running a newsroom; without sales and ad representatives, for instance, many newsrooms cannot stay afloat. We also included both part-time and full-time workers in our count with the consideration that any loss of income has consequences, and stated when this was the case.\n\nDespite Tow’s best efforts, sorting editorial workers from non-editorial workers proved nearly impossible. Most announcements did not specify, and many people who were willing to speak with Tow often were not able to provide specific details or figures.\n\nCutbacks counted\n\nMany companies implemented what are considered “traditional” layoffs, or worker discharges that leave positions open until economic circumstances change, as well as position eliminations that result in permanent staff downsizing. However, we only counted “eliminated positions” in our layoffs count if it was occupied by an employee at the time of its elimination. Voluntary buyouts and retirements were excluded, even when they occurred at the same time as mass layoffs, which they often did. Furloughs were also excluded unless we could confirm they resulted in permanent layoffs. It’s likely that many media workers who were furloughed never returned to their jobs, but we found very few examples where this was publicly announced. It’s also worth noting that in some instances, news organizations characterized furloughs as “layoffs” in order for their employees to receive unemployment benefits; the few such examples the Tow Center could verify this was the case were not included in our layoff numbers. For all layoffs where the number of affected workers is “unknown,” we gave the entries a “1” value that went towards the total layoffs figure.\n\nNews organizations counted\n\nTow defines “news organizations” as any entity that regularly disseminates newsworthy information or current events to the general public with applied journalistic editorial standards. We did our best not to include marketing or advertising agencies, consulting firms, or broadband distributors, even if they worked within or adjacent to the news industry. Tow also did not include workers at off-site print facilities, many of which closed or merged throughout the pandemic. (Poynter, however, extensively documented newspaper plant layoffs and closures.)\n\nDate range\n\nThe earliest cutback in Tow’s database is from March 1, 2020. While the pandemic won’t likely have a clear “ending,” numerous variants continue to throw the nation into further uncertainty nearly two years since the first COVID-19 case was confirmed in the US. Therefore, we are continuing to update this list, even when many layoff announcements don't neatly trace the cuts back to the pandemic. While it might be true that many of the later layoffs were not a direct result of the coronavirus, those affected were still laid off amid a global health and economic crisis.\n\nOther news organization cutbacks figures\n\nOn April 10, 2020, the New York Times published an article on news media outlets ravaged by the pandemic. By their estimates, roughly 28,000 workers had been laid off, been furloughed, or had their pay reduced at the time of publication. The Times has subsequently revised that upward, most recently to 37,000. In a phone interview with the Tow Center last year, the editor who oversaw the tally described it as “an imperfect but valuable number.” And the Times’ communications director said in an email to Tow that their reporting was a “conservative estimate based on public and on background comments that have been provided to Times journalists.” Many have incorrectly cited the Times’ figure though, referring to it solely as permanent layoffs when the true meaning includes dismissals, furloughs, and pay cuts—likely due to the understandable impulse to point to large figures as illustrative of the local news crisis’ magnitude.\n\nBecause the Times’ count grouped layoffs, furloughs, and pay cuts together, which measures both temporary and permanent changes to the news industry, it provides limited insight into the lasting impact of COVID-19 on the news industry. The Tow Center sought out a figure that more precisely measures the pandemic’s permanent toll by isolating layoffs from other cutbacks, rather than grouping both temporary and permanent cuts together.\n\nOther outlets have tallied up layoffs numbers, too. While reflecting on her year of covering media closures and layoffs at the end of 2020, Poynter’s Kristen Hare wrote that she had counted “4,500 layoffs and job cuts,” by the end of 2020, with at least 1,500 of those being printing press workers. (Hare has also compiled an extensive list of newsroom cutbacks since the pandemic began that has informed much of the Tow Center’s own initial cutbacks data.)\n\nAxios and the Wrap regularly cite year-over-year newsroom layoffs data collected by Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement firm that studies the economy. While Challenger’s numbers have the advantage of showing how the news industry is expanding or contracting over time, neither their findings’ underlying data nor the methodology behind their layoff tallies is publicly available. (Challenger did, however, readily provide their full list of news organization cutbacks to the Tow Center upon request and willingly discussed the limitations of its own data.) This matters when trying to tease out a specific category of cutbacks—or in Tow’s case, layoffs—due to the complicated nature of classifying cutback types. A thorough review of a sample set of their data from 2020 by the Tow Center found that some of the layoffs included in their count were “temporary layoffs,” or what Tow categorizes as a furlough, rather than permanent job losses. They also included companies like the digital retail agency Triad Digital Media and Cox Corporate Services in their count. And in one case, Challenger attributed layoffs that affected more than 3,100 workers at the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas to the Hearst-owned Cosmopolitan Magazine, which is headquartered at the Hearst Tower in New York City. (Challenger has since been made aware of this error and voluntarily updated its database). The differences between how Challenger and Tow define layoffs and decide who to include in our respective counts boils down to methodology and making it clear and publicly available.\n\nThe Tow Center did, however, speak with Challenger’s vice president of public relations in fall 2020 who said that the firm collects their data through public announcements, online surveys to HR executives, and SEC filings. They also use Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notifications, or WARN filings, that require employers in some states to give a 60-day notice before company layoffs, which added hundreds of unannounced layoffs to Tow’s list.\n\nThe Tow Center’s list of news worker layoffs is by no means exhaustive. It does, however, attempt to bridge the gaps between the few databases that exist and collect data critical to better understanding an industry-wide news crisis. If you notice any missing layoffs from the Tow Center’s database or would like to help make these figures more accurate, please contact us at towcentercuj@gmail.com.\n\nNews organization layoffs\n\nThe following list of layoffs are grouped by news organizations and then sorted chronologically, first by month and then by day, beginning in March 2020. Nearly every entry has a date associated with the cutback to easily search the document with the command function. If a parent company, like the newspaper chain Gannett, had chainwide cutbacks across several of its entities, the known layoffs are grouped accordingly and listed underneath their publishers’ heading. (It’s important to note that many publishing companies had more than one round of layoffs. For instance, Gannett had mass, company-wide layoffs in April 2020, but other individual Gannett newsrooms still experienced one-off cutbacks at various points throughout the pandemic.) If a layoff figure has a plus symbol next to it, this means that it’s likely the number of layoffs is much higher that what’s listed but it could not be confirmed by the news organization or parent company after multiple requests for clarification.\n\nMarch 2020\n\nIndex Newspapers: 28\n\n—The Stranger: 18\n\nSeattle, WA\n\nThe Seattle alternative biweekly newspaper publicly announced on March 13, 2020 that 18 employees were being laid off due to the “hellscape” that is the coronavirus pandemic. The Tow Center learned that six of the 18 employees who were laid off worked in the newsroom, including four staff writers, the managing editor, and one copy editor. One of the staff writers was later re-hired.\n\n—Portland Mercury: 10\n\nPortland, OR\n\nThe alternative biweekly newspaper publicly announced on March 14, 2020 that ten staffers would be “temporarily laid off” across editorial, calendar, sales, and circulation. The Tow Center learned that these cuts later became permanent, but as of March 2021, the Mercury has hired at least one new permanent staffer and added more freelance work.\n\nChico Community Publishing: 60\n\nPresident Jeff Vonkaenel announced on March 17, 2020 that Chico Community Publishing would be suspending print and temporarily laying off “nearly all” of its staff, or about 60 full-time workers, across all of its News & Review newspapers in Reno NV, Chico, CA and Sacramento CA. Vonkaenel could not be reached for updates.\n\nMonterey County Weekly: 7\n\nSeaside, CA\n\nOn March 17, 2020, one-third of staff across all departments were laid off at an all-staff meeting. This included a managing editor, a staff writer, two graphic designers, and three members of the sales team. The Tow Center learned in March 2021 that the Weekly has returned to nearly the same size as pre-pandemic, and they expanded the newsroom by two additional hires, including a newsletter editor.\n\nThe Washingtonian: 4\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nOn March 18, 2020, the “magazine Washington lives by” laid off all four of its spring fellows.\n\nEuclid Media Group: 58\n\nThe publisher of ten alt-weeklies, including the recently acquired LEO Weekly, laid off nearly 80 percent of its workforce on March 18, 2020 with the hope of hiring some staffers back post-pandemic. Those remaining received “significant pay cuts.” As of September 2021, the Tow Center learned that Euclid has filled around 40 to 50 percent of full-time positions left vacant by the pandemic.\n\n—Cincinnati CityBeat: 7\n\nThe free news and entertainment newspaper laid off seven staffers across all of its departments.\n\n—Cleveland Scene: 5\n\nCleveland, OH\n\nThe Ohio alt-weekly laid off five employees across all of its departments on March 18, 2020. The Tow Center learned that as of March 2021, two of the five previous laid off staffers have been brought back on in freelance capacities—one in editorial and the other in sales.\n\n—Creative Loafing Tampa Bay: 8\n\nThe 12-person newsroom laid off seven full time employees and one part time staffer. All remaining employees received a 10 percent pay cut and were expected to take on “additional roles.”\n\n—San Antonio Current: 10\n\nSan Antonio, TX\n\nThe Current laid off 10 employees from its sales, production, editorial and events departments on March 18, 2020.\n\n—Riverfront Times: 7\n\nSt. Louis, MO\n\nNearly the entire staff, including two sales and five newsroom workers, were laid off from St. Louis’ only alt-weekly, the Riverfront Times. Editor in chief Doyle Murphy told the Tow Center in a June 2021 email that five of the seven laid off staffers had since returned to the Times and the newspaper plans to finish the year with more staff than they had prior to the pandemic due to several new staff hires.\n\n—Metro Times: 8\n\nThe Metro Times “temporarily” laid off eight employees across all of its department, two of which were in editorial. The Tow Center learned that as of May 2021, the newspaper was in talks to hire additional editorial staffers.\n\n—Orlando Weekly: 13\n\nOrlando, FL\n\nOn March 18, 2020, the 30-year-old Florida alt-weekly laid off 13 staff across editorial, events, sales, production, and circulation. No timeline was offered to affected workers despite their “sincere hope” to bring affected employees back while remaining staffers were expected to “cover multiple roles” at the 30-year-old alt-weekly.\n\nIsthmus: 23\n\nMadison, WI\n\nDuring the week of March 18, 2021, the 45 year old alt-weekly newspaper indefinitely ceased publication and laid off all 23 full-time employees. Isthmus has since resumed operations as a non-profit news organization relying largely on volunteer labor.\n\nTampa Bay Times: 11\n\nTampa Bay, FL\n\nOn March 18, 2020, the daily newspaper laid off 11 journalists and slashed three additional positions held by people with previous plans to leave.\n\nThe News-Gazette: 2\n\nLexington, VA\n\nThe Tow Center learned that on March 19, 2020, the News-Gazette laid off a sportswriter and an assistant editor. However, both staffers were re-hired roughly four weeks later.\n\nNorthwest Quarterly Magazine: 12\n\nRockford, IL\n\nThe Tow Center learned that nearly all of the magazine’s staff was laid off “temporarily” in mid-March 2020, including 3 editors, two graphic designers, and seven sales team members. Only the publisher and one editor continued working full-time, with a few salespeople working on a commission-only basis. The publisher, Hugh Media Corp, could not be reached for an update on whether affected staff later returned.\n\nExaminer Media: 24\n\nMount Kisco, NY\n\nThe publisher of Examiner Media, Adam Stone, told the Tow Center that four full-time news journalists and more than 20 additional contributors, mostly freelancers, were let go on March 18, 2020. Examiner Media’s total staff on their payroll has since been steadily restored to about 30 total people—similar to pre-pandemic levels—including periodic contractors.\n\nSparks Tribune: 1\n\nSparks, NV\n\nThe rural newspaper laid off one of its three part-time employees on March 19, 2020.\n\nThe Argonaut: 1\n\nLos Angeles, CA\n\nEditor Joe Piasecki was laid off on March 20, 2020.\n\nThe Durango Herald: 5\n\nDurango, CO\n\nOn March 20, 2020, the family-owned newspaper in Southwest Colorado laid off five staffers across its news and advertising departments.\n\nEasy Reader: 12\n\nHermosa Beach, CA\n\nThe entire staff was laid off on March 20, 2020. Publisher Kevin Cody wrote in a column that this included four reporters, two office managers, two advertising representatives, one art director, one bookkeeper, an associate publisher and the publisher. The newspaper continues to operate on a voluntary basis in what Cody calls a “hibernation period,” as he hopes to bring on paid staffers at a later date.\n\nLos Angeles Downtown News: 2\n\nLos Angeles, CA\n\nOn March 20, 2020, Southland Publishing laid off at least two editors from the weekly newspaper. One of the affected editors had worked at the paper for four-and-a-half years under three different owners.\n\nMountain Xpress: 7\n\nAsheville, NC\n\nThe alt-weekly laid off seven staffers across its editorial, IT, advertising, and design departments on March 20, 2020.\n\nNorthwest Alabamian: Unknown\n\nHaleyville, AL\n\nFor the first time in the publisher’s 55-year tenure, Winston County’s weekly newspaper had “a major layoff of employees” on March 20, 2020. The paper could not be reached for further clarification on the number of staffers affected.\n\nPittsburgh Catholic: 11\n\nPittsburgh, PA\n\nIn a ‘shocking’ move to staff, the Catholic newspaper terminated all employees and suspended operations indefinitely on March 20, 2020. The paper has since resumed operations, although it’s not clear when and in what capacity; they did not respond to requests for clarification by the Tow Center.\n\nSample News Group: 21\n\nOn March 20, 2020, the Northeast publisher laid off 21 of 42 employees that worked across two of its Vermont-based newspapers, the Rutland Herald and Barre-Montpelier Times Argus. The Tow Center learned that as of March 2021, publisher Steve Pappas had eliminated 11 of the positions left vacant but filled 10 others across all departments.
