        "text": "People like lists: To do lists. Grocery lists. Top 10 lists. Lists make things easy to organize, easy to digest and easy to read. And while we won’t call this a “bucket list” — because that seems slightly morbid and we want you to accomplish more with your life than just eating smiley face cookies — we will call it a “should list.” Or maybe a “fun list”? What’s less aggressive than a bucket list? A “cup list”?\n\nIt’s not really a list of things to do before you die, it’s more like a list of things to do if you’re bored on the weekend and/or want to prove you’re a true Cincinnatian (outside of the fact that everyone knows instead of blood, our veins run brown with liquid chili).\n\nSo here are 101 things every Queen City resident should do for entertainment, curiosity, civic pride, culinary advancement, etc.\n\n1. Go to the top of Carew Tower\n\nFor $3 to $6 and a 49-floor elevator ride, you can stand on the top of the city’s second-tallest building (the tallest is the Great American Tower) and get a bird’s-eye view of the skyline, Ohio River and Northern Kentucky from the Observation Deck. Carew Tower, 441 Vine St., Downtown, 513-579-9735.\n\n2. Ride the Beast at Kings Island\n\nKings Island’s The Beast turned 40 this year and while it may be getting on in years, the world's longest wooden roller coaster hasn't slowed down at all: its 7,300-plus feet of track includes 135-foot vertical drops, a 540-degree helix tunnel and speeds up to 64 miles per hour. It’s given more than 54 million rides in its four decades and Popular Mechanics magazine just named it the best roller coaster in Ohio. Kings Island, 6300 Kings Island Drive, Mason, visitkingsisland.com.\n\n3. Eat blue Creamy Whip\n\nIf you’ve lived in Cincinnati for any length of time, chances are you can distinctly evoke the taste of blue ice cream, a blueberry-based soft serve — although the actual name of the flavor is just “blue.” Introduced by Kings Island in 1982 to promote a then-new Smurfs ride in the park’s Hanna-Barbera Land, it’s become a quintessential Queen City summer treat. Thankfully the cult following for the dessert is as rich as its flavor, so you can grab a cone at most local creamy whip windows. Although blue creamy whip varies slightly at each location — with many shops implementing special (and secret) twists — the treats taste nearly identical, staying faithful to the amusement park’s true-blue recipe.\n\n4. Or Graeter’s Black Raspberry Chocolate Chip ice cream\n\nFamily-run for 150 years (technically 149; the local dessert giant celebrates its 150th anniversary in 2020), this local French pot ice cream chain is iconic for its giant chocolate chips — chunks, really. They pour gourmet chocolate over churning cream to form a shell that their artisans then break up. It’s totally unique and perfect in flavors like Black Raspberry Chocolate Chip — their all-time best-seller made with black raspberries from Oregon’s Willamette Valley. Multiple locations, graeters.com.\n\n5. Catch Playhouse in the Park’s annual holiday performance of A Christmas Carol\n\nWith every holiday season comes Playhouse in the Park’s production of A Christmas Carol. You know the story: A curmudgeonly, greedy capitalist named Ebenezer Scrooge forces his employees to work on Christmas and, in general, is a jerk. That's why he’s visited by a trio of ghosts who attempt to show him the error of his ways. The heartwarming and classic Charles Dickens’ tale reminds us to appreciate the people that really matter in our lives and, as evidenced by Scrooge, that it’s never too late to change. As CityBeat reviewer Rick Pender once wrote about the Playhouse’s yearly performance: “If you haven’t seen it, give yourself a present and do so.” Playhouse in the Park, 962 Mount Adams Circle, Mount Adams, cincyplay.com.\n\n6. Go underground during a Brewing Heritage Trail tour\n\nOnce one of the largest brewing boomtowns in America in the 19th-century, Cincinnati’s Brewing Heritage Trail explores, preserves and celebrates the city’s storied past as a beer-producing capital with a series of guided tours and a free walking trail. “Hop on” the trail, which stretches about three-fourths of a mile between Findlay Market and Grant Park, at either terminus and follow embedded medallions in the sidewalk to discover historic buildings, brewing sites, public art and more. The trail will eventually stretch two miles, snaking into Pendleton and Mohawk, and include an app with audio tours and augmented reality experiences that will let users look inside underground lagering cellars and former brewing spaces. A number of guided tours are also available to complement the self-guided trail where you can go into the subterranean lagering tunnels of the now defunct breweries, learn about beer barons and just bask in our pre-Prohibition boozy history. Most also include a pint or two of local brew. Brewing Heritage Trail, brewingheritagetrail.com.\n\n7. Spend your entire day camped out on the riverfront for the Riverfest/WEBN fireworks\n\nLaunched more than four decades ago to celebrate the 10th anniversary of radio station WEBN, this Labor Day bash officially signals the end of summer with a series of colorful explosions in the sky. In addition to food, music, major traffic jams and one of the largest firework displays in the Midwest set to music from 102.7 FM (you are 100-percent guaranteed to hear “Smoke on the Water”), festgoers can expect to see half a million other humans and a river full of boats. (People start setting up blankets a day early to claim primo space on both sides of the river.) During the lead-up to the big show, the Freestore Foodbank hosts its annual Rubber Duck Regatta, dropping as many as 200,000 yellow duckies from the Purple People Bridge into the Ohio River in a race to benefit the foodbank (buy a duck, feed a kid, possibly win a car). Riverfest, rubberduckregatta.org, webn.iheart.com.\n\n8. Shop local at The City Flea\n\nShop local at this “curated urban flea market,” which pops up monthly from May to October — with a special winter holiday market — in Washington Park. Small businesses and independent makers sell everything from vintage duds and airplants to apothecary items and artisan pizza. Washington Park, 1230 Elm St., Over-the-Rhine, thecityflea.com.\n\n9. Visit Fiona at the Cincinnati Zoo\n\nSince being born six weeks early in January 2017, baby hippo Fiona has become a bona fide celebrity. Initially weighing just 29 pounds, she inspired the hashtag #TeamFiona as well as plenty of international media coverage, children’s books and mountains of themed merchandise. The former itty, bitty baby is now a sassy and playful multi-hundred-pound hippo. Visit her and her mom, Bibi, in the zoo’s Africa exhibit. Or check out any one of the many other zoo babies who steal our hearts on the regular — like the recently welcomed giraffe, Fennessy. This year the zoo was also named the No. 1 in the nation by USA Today. Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden, 3400 Vine St., Avondale, cincinnatizoo.org.\n\n10. Buy rare hot sauce at Jungle Jim’s\n\nJungle Jim’s is an amusement park for foodies, and not just because of its kitschy statues and animatronics. It sells nearly 1,500 different kinds of hot sauce, which makes the Aisle of Inferno (as it’s so dubbed) “the largest retail selection in the United States.” It’s pretty hard to miss — it’s the one with the giant fire truck on top of it. Jungle JIm’s, 5440 Dixie Highway, Fairfield, junglejims.com.\n\n11. Get a drink at Arnold’s Bar and Grill, the city’s oldest bar\n\nA friendly, diverse and historic gin joint, Arnold’s is the city’s oldest bar — in operation since the 1830s. Arnold’s draws folks for its food, live music (lots of Americana and Bluegrass), local brews and casual atmosphere. Named as one of the best bars in America by Esquire magazine, it offers friendly service, cheap drinks, an awesome courtyard (used to be a stable and carriage house) and a bathtub that was once reputedly used for making bathtub gin. Arnold’s Bar and Grill, 210 E. Eighth St., Downtown, arnoldsbarandgrill.com.\n\n12. Participate in the world’s largest Chicken Dance\n\nOktoberfest Zinzinnati is the nation’s largest feier of authentic German food, music and beer with an estimated 575,000 festgoers eating an estimated 87,542 metts, 400 pickled pigs feet and 64,000 sauerkraut balls each September, among other gluttonous activities. Odd traditions include the majestic Running of the Wieners dachshund races, brat-eating competitions and the world’s largest Chicken Dance, which has been led by celebrities like “Weird Al” Yankovic, Nick and Drew Lachey and George Takei. Oktoberfest Zinzinnati, oktoberfestzinzinnati.com.\n\n13. Have a cocktail at the Bar at Palm Court\n\nNestled inside the historic Hilton Cincinnati Netherland Plaza, the Bar at Palm Court is an astonishing French Art Deco masterpiece with Brazilian rosewood, a massive ziggurat-shaped fountain and seashell-framed booths like Venus rising from the foam. The art is in the design as well as the Great Gatsby-esque drinks. Try the NP, a best-of-both-worlds cocktail that pairs bourbon with something bubbly. Named after the Netherland Plaza, the cocktail features Four Roses yellow label bourbon, lemon, ginger, bitters and sparkling wine. It’s light, refreshing and still packs a boozy punch. The Bar at Palm Court, 35 W. Fifth St., Downtown, orchidsatpalmcourt.com.\n\n14. Run, walk or watch the Flying Pig Marathon\n\nThe flying pig is a ubiquitous Cincinnati symbol, evoking the animal that earned the city its nickname: \"Porkopolis.” But for one weekend a year, the flying pig stands for working off pounds, not putting them on. Created in 1997, the Flying Pig Marathon draws people from around the world to make it through a 26.2-mile urban course at their own speed. The race, which winds through Cincinnati, Covington, Newport, Mariemont, Fairfax and Columbia Township, is a qualifier for the Boston Marathon and sees upward of 40,000 participants annually. Flying Pig Marathon, flyingpigmarathon.com.\n\n15. Grab a latte at Folk School Coffee Parlor while Jerry Springer records his podcast\n\nThe Jerry Springer Show ran for 27 seasons before its final episode in 2018. The tabloid-style talk show was fronted by its namesake, a former mayor of Cincinnati, and was perhaps the definition of guilty pleasure daytime TV. If you miss his shenanigans and commentary, The Jerry Springer Podcast is recorded weekly in Ludlow, Kentucky’s very cozy Folk School Coffee Parlor. Seriously. Subtitled Tales, Tunes and Tomfoolery, it’s a variety show with Springer’s liberal political commentary at its center. You can reserve a seat in one of their own live shows via jerryspringer.com and sip a latte while you’re at it. Listen to archived episodes at jerryspringer.com.\n\n16. Get real American during the Northside Fourth of July Parade\n\nJuly in Northside means one thing: the most colorful, freewheeling parade in Cincinnati. The Northside Fourth of July Parade — happening every year since 1970 — is an all-out celebration of independence, community, small business and individuality. Expect to see creative handmade floats from vintage stores, bars and community organizations; local marching bands; drill teams; every politician you’ve ever heard of; ladies dancing with lawn chairs; guys dancing with power tools; and other unexpected and delightful displays of pride and spirit. The parade complements the Northside Rock N’ Roll Carnival, a two-day fest featuring live music, local beer, fair food and plenty of sideshow entertainment. northsidejuly4.com; northsiderocks.com.\n\n17. Browse the stacks of The Mercantile Library\n\nThe Mercantile Library — located on the 11th and 12th floors of a downtown office building — is Cincinnati’s own Room of Requirement (for those who aren’t Harry Potter fans, basically it’s just an extraordinarily cool, secret space). Open since 1835, this membership library (one of only two-dozenish left in the U.S.) is home to more than 80,000 books, dynamic lecture series — Ralph Waldo Emerson, Ray Bradbury, Tom Wolfe, Julia Child are just a handful of names who have spoken here — concerts, yoga classes and cocktail hours. While you have to be a member to check out books, the public is welcome to wander the stacks, attend events and marvel at the luddite luxury of this classic club. The Mercantile Library, 414 Walnut St., 11th Floor, Downtown, mercantilelibrary.com.\n\n18. Get high in Blue Ash at the Summit Park Observation Tower\n\nAt almost 850 feet above sea level, Blue Ash is one of the highest points in Hamilton County. In 2018, the city boosted its natural elevation by adding a 150 foot observation tower to Summit Park. The sleek, glass-paneled tower affords those who climb the 200-plus steps to the top a birds-eye view of the region, from the Cincinnati skyline to Kings Island's Eiffel Tower. Summit Park Observation Tower, 4335 Glendale-Milford Road, Blue Ash, summitparkblueash.com.\n\n19. Cross the Shark Bridge at the Newport Aquarium\n\nEver wonder what it would feel like to walk the plank into shark-infested waters? Well, you can get a little taste of the experience by venturing across Newport Aquarium’s Shark Bridge, the world’s first rope bridge suspended just inches above the 385,000 gallon Surrounded by Sharks exhibit. Thankfully, once you complete the 75-foot long walk over more than a dozen sharks (plus sharkrays, stingrays and fish), you’ll end up safely on the other side of the tank, not splashing down next to an apex predator. Newport Aquarium, 1 Aquarium Way, Newport, newportaquarium.com.\n\n20. Listen to the western hemisphere’s longest running choral festival\n\nProclaimed as “a celebration of the human voice,” the annual May Festival is the longest-running choral festival in the Western Hemisphere (started in 1873) and is a big reason for the construction of Music Hall — where the festival still takes place today. Though its history is uniquely Cincinnati, the fest also collaborates with artists from around the world. Principal Conductor Juanjo Mena takes pride in working with artistic collaborators from outside the region, including contemporary and avant performers, so while it is traditional, the May Festival is anything but boring. May Festival, mayfestival.com.\n\n21. Do a cannonball into Sunlite Pool\n\nCincinnatians have been splashing around in the world’s largest recirculating pool at Coney Island since 1925. The 200-by-401-foot Sunlite Pool has plenty of space for small children, teenagers and lap swimmers to cool off during the summer. Coney Island Amusement Park, 6201 Kellogg Ave., California, coneyislandpark.com.\n\n22. Ride the mechanical bull at Bobby Mackey’s\n\nSure, Bobby Mackey’s in Wilder, Kentucky is known for being haunted and for serving up some of the most authentic traditional Country and Honky Tonk music in the area on a regular basis, including appearances by its musician owner/namesake (and his “Best Damn Band”) every weekend. But for many, the real attraction remains the nightclub’s mechanical bull ride, which celebrated its 40th year of bucking patrons in 2019. Legend has it that Mackey traveled south and purchased his first bull — known as El Turbo — from Mickey Gilley in 1979 during the filming of John Travolta’s and Debra Winger’s Urban Cowboy, the movie that would soon make Gilley’s Texas honky tonk internationally famous. How long can you last? There’s only one way to find out. And get this, tough guy — the bar’s just a few steps away when it’s time to numb your new bruises. Bobby Mackey’s, 44 Licking Pike, Wilder, bobbymackey.com.\n\n23. Go on The Kentucky Bourbon Trail Craft Tour\n\nThe main Kentucky Bourbon Trail is a self-guided liquor-filled jaunt through 13 major Kentucky bourbon distilleries — the Big Boys of bourbon. But if you want to get off the beaten path, the Bourbon Trail also offers a craft tour with 14 micro-distilleries which are, as the website says, “redefining artisan craftsmanship — and paving the way for the next generation of bourbon connoisseurs to rise.” That trail starts down in Pembroke at MB Roland Distillery and winds its way up through Louisville, Lexington and Bardstown and into Northern Kentucky, where our very own New Riff Distillery sits as the northernmost stop. But if you don’t feel like signing up for more than one drinking destination, New Riff offers its own regular distillery tours and tastings. There are three options from which to choose: the Bonded Tour, the Barrel Proof Tour and the Inside the Lab Tour. New Riff, 24 Distillery Way, Newport, newriffdistilling.com, kybourbontrail.com.\n\n24. Hunt for ghosts at Loveland Castle\n\nWorld War I army medic and Boy Scout troop leader Harry Delos Andrews built Chateau Laroche over the course of 50 years with handmade bricks (formed with quart-sized paper milk cartons) and stones from the nearby Little Miami River. Modeled after European castles, it features towers, a dry moat, hand-tiled ceilings, murder holes and a collection of period weaponry. The castle grounds are available for picnics, overnights and parties and are rumored to be haunted by a variety of ghosts. Loveland Castle, 12025 Shore Road, Loveland, lovelandcastle.com.\n\n25. Get lit during BLINK\n\nAfter a hugely successful pilot event, the art and light festival will return for a second run in October 2019. This year, BLINK will span 30 blocks and cross the Ohio River with large-scale projection mapping, murals, interactive light sculptures, live entertainment and the centerpiece: the Roebling Bridge will be brought to life with light, sound and color for the extravagant fest. This year will also feature a live concert by Alternative Rock band Grouplove, well-known for their songs \"Tongue Tied\" and \"Ways to Go.\" BLINK, blinkcincinnati.com.\n\n26. Make a beer-can pyramid during the Cyclones’ dollar beer night\n\nMinor league sports offer the type of value anyone can appreciate — like $1 beer and hot dogs. A chant of “Sucks!” is traditional after the introduction of each opposing player at Cincinnati Cyclones hockey games, and fans can also suck down responsible amounts of beer as they watch the multi-time ECHL champions play on dollar beer nights at U.S. Bank Arena. The Cyclones offer this promotion 15 or so times a season, along with other funny stuff like an ugly sweater T-shirt giveaway and weiner dog races. Cheap Hudepohl and hot dogs also happen to be available at your local grocer, who will not appreciate your “sucks” chants at the checkout lane. Cyclones, cycloneshockey.com.\n\n27. See (and hear) a concert from the lawn at Riverbend\n\nRiverbend Music Center has made it easier than ever to see live music from the lawn seats. This year, the venue removed the support beam towers that have been part of the pavilion structure since its original construction in 1984. \"Over the years we have received feedback from patrons that they loved being on the lawn for concerts, but wished the sightlines were better. So we listened and now every spot on the lawn has an unobstructed view of the stage,\" said Rosemarie Moehring, MEMI's director of marketing. Lawn seats are cheaper than pavilion seats, and for big concerts — like Jimmy Buffett’s annual pilgrimage to see his Queen City Parrotheads — it’s where the party’s at. It also makes it easier to access the bathrooms, beer lines and the exit when you want to leave. Riverbend Music Center, 6295 Kellogg Ave., California, riverbend.org.\n\n28. Play hooky during the Opening Day Parade\n\nWhen baseball season arrives in Cincinnati, it’s time to air out your Reds gear and practice your fake cough. Opening Day might not be an official local holiday, but we take our season opener pretty damn seriously with the Findlay Market Opening Day Parade. The annual celebration begins promptly at noon and steps off from the market, led by an honorary grand marshal and some 200 other businesses and groups — local politicians, the Budweiser Clydesdales, high school bands, etc. — walking, marching, biking, driving and operating floats down Race and Fifth streets, ending at the Taft Theatre. The Reds are the nation’s oldest professional baseball team, and this historic parade basically shuts the city down for the day, so call into work (if your boss is even there) and get ready to buy some peanuts and Cracker Jacks — and beer and hot dogs and maybe nachos in a Reds helmet — and spend Opening Day reveling in America’s favorite pastime. Opening Day Parade, findlaymarketparade.com.\n\n29. Try a goetta brownie during Glier’s Goettafest\n\nCincinnatians have a thing for weird meats, the most beloved of which is probably Cincinnati-style chili. A close second is goetta, a German-inspired combination of sausage meat and pinhead oats. Goetta devotees flock to Glier’s Goettafest in Newport for a few days each summer (two weekends actually, starting this year) to sample myriad goetta-infused foods, such as goetta burgers, goetta mac and cheese, goetta burritos, goetta fried rice, goetta empanadas, goetta potato pancakes, deep-fried goetta balls, goetta kebabs, goetta wrapped in bacon, goetta nachos and, yes, even goetta brownies. Each vendor has to have a completely unique goetta menu, and no item can repeat, so the goetta iterations are endless and endlessly creative. Glier’s Goettafest, goettafest.com.\n\n30. Dance like a Greek at Panegryi\n\nGo Greek for a day — or the whole weekend — at the annual Panegyri Greek Festival held at Holy Trinity-St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church. Traditional music and folk dance transports guests to the mainland and islands of Greece. You can visit the marketplace to find jewelry, icons, olive oil and other imported goods but the highlight of this festival is the food. Grab a gyro, spanakopita, a full greek dinner and an imported glass of wine, then hit the zaxaroplasteio for traditional Greek desserts like baklava, kourambiethes, melomakarona and more. Live cooking demonstrations also teach guests how to prepare their own festival favorites at home. Opa! Panegyri, 7000 Winton Road, Finneytown, htsnchurch.org.\n\n31. Tailgate before a Bengals game\n\nTailgating in Cincinnati is similar to tailgating in other NFL cities: Orange-and-black-striped repurposed mini-vans, trailers and buses accompany games of cornhole, Playstation, beer pong and plenty of ’80s hair metal — Guns N’ Roses’ “Welcome to the Jungle,” mostly. On game days, you can find fans starting their pre-game celebrations in the early a.m. in parking lots outside of Paul Brown Stadium and across downtown — seriously, all of downtown. Like a call-and-response, just start shouting “Who-Dey” into the air and see who answers; you’ll inevitably find yourself drinking and eating a hot dog out of the back of a pick-up with some new friends. Bengals, bengals.com.\n\n32. Wander through willows at the Taft Museum of art\n\nFar Flung is a large-scale, outdoor sculpture on the grounds of the Taft Museum of Art — and it is pretty cool. A \"unique fantasy experience\" by sculptor Patrick Dougherty, it features more than six tons of manipulated willow tree saplings, twisted into whirling shapes that call to mind hobbit homes, a fairy garden and/or a Dr. Seuss fever dream manifestation. The best part? Visitors can touch and walk through it. Far Flung opened in April 2018, will be open for about 20 months and is free to experience during regular museum hours. Taft Museum of Art, 316 Pike St., Downtown, taftmuseum.org.\n\n33. See all the dressed-up dogs at the Mount Adams Reindog Parade\n\nDressing your furry friend in his or her holiday best to sashay your way through the streets of Mount Adams? Now that’s what the Christmas season is all about. The Mount Adams Reindog Parade, which happens each December, has given pooch owners a chance to do just that for the past 30 years. Prizes are awarded for the best costumes, which brings out the creative elf in everyone. Proceeds benefit SPCA Cincinnati, and plenty of neighborhood bar and restaurant patios go dog-friendly for the day. Even if you don’t have a dog of your own, it’s entertaining enough to see all the entries for Best Dog/Owner Look-A-Like. Mount Adams Reingdog Parade, spcacincinnati.org.\n\n34. Get drunk (or just have a beer) at Bockfest\n\nGerman monks used to drink bock beer instead of food during the Lenten fast. And while lay folk may hesitate to spend 40 days ingesting nothing but alcohol (though, if that’s your jam, we certainly aren’t judging), you can still get a taste of the monastery tradition at Cincinnati’s annual Bockfest, a weekend-long fest that honors both beer and the coming of spring. It kicks off with a Friday parade led by a goat pulling a keg and the reigning Sausage Queen — a gender-neutral pageant-winner honored for their personality, presence and talent (the only real requirement is the ability to carry a symbolic tray of bockwurst). The rest of the weekend’s activities include historic brewery tours, beer drinking, the Sausage Queen/Beard Baron finals, live music, a 5k and plenty of German food. Bockfest, bockfest.com.\n\n35. Spend a Saturday in Rabbit Hash\n\nFor those yet to take a trip down the rabbit hole, this historic Kentucky rivertown is located approximately 30 miles southwest of Cincinnati in Boone County, Kentucky in a place where time appears to have stood still. The Rabbit Hash General Store, open since 1831 and regarded as one of the best-preserved country stores in the Bluegrass State, was destroyed by a fire several years ago, but the town rallied to reopen it. Rabbit Hash is unincorporated, so it is without fixed boundaries, but the hamlet is considered to have a population of about 315. It is known for its series of dog mayors, barn dances, motorcycle culture and other quaint country trappings. Visit on the weekend for a glass of wine from Verona Vineyards’ outpost and listen to some live Bluegrass. Rabbit Hash, Kentucky, rabbithash.com.\n\n36. Find the SpongeBob SquarePants tombstones at Spring Grove Cemetery\n\nTwo 7-foot headstones made in the likeness of SpongeBob SquarePants were the center of controversy when they were first erected in 2013 at Spring Grove Cemetery. The headstones belong to Kimberly Walker — an Iraq War veteran who was murdered at age 28 — and her living twin sister, Kara Walker. The Bikini Bottom resident was Kimberly’s favorite cartoon character and the statue wears her army uniform, name and rank. Though Spring Grove initially approved the headstone, they removed it the following day, deeming it inappropriate for the historic cemetery. After months of back-and-forth, the headstones were reinstalled; but now they’re joined by two granite slabs, which shield them from being seen from the road. In the process, the story attracted international coverage and became a weird nugget of Cincinnati history. Spring Grove Cemetery, 4521 Spring Grove Ave., Spring Grove Village, springgrove.org.\n\n37. Cheer from the Bailey at an FC Cincinnati game\n\nFaces and torsos seem to be the most popular body parts to paint orange and blue at Nippert Stadium, where the Major League Soccer team FC Cincinnati fills the stands with chanting, drum-beating, soccer-scarf-wearing fanatics. Futbol fever plays out on the pitch of the University of Cincinnati’s historic football field and in “The Bailey,” where the team’s support clubs get real rowdy lighting off colored smoke bombs, tossing up tifos and generally enacting flamboyant displays of FC pride in a spirited section just behind the north goal. When the team moves to its new $250 million stadium in the West End in 2021, The Bailey will feature 3,100 “safe-standing” seats on the stadium’s north side — nearly twice the number at Nippert. FC Cincinnati, fccincinnati.com.\n\n38. Pose with Casey Millard's Shark Girl sculpture at the Contemporary Arts Center\n\nSharkboy is so 2005. Hip Cincinnatians know that Shark Girl is the only shark-human hybrid we need. The iconic statue — a little girl’s body clad in a cute dress paired with a shark’s head — has been found at multiple locations, including at the UnMuseum in the Contemporary Arts Center. There, she sits on a bench waiting for a friend to come sit next to her for a photo. For an additional Instagram-worthy experience, take a next-level selfie at the UnMuseum’s Deep Space installation, a series of illuminated and reflective infinity mirrors that create pleasingly New Wave effects. Contemporary Arts Center, 44 E. Sixth St., Downtown, contemporaryartscenter.org.\n\n39. Walk the Steps of Holy Cross-Immaculata Parish\n\nIt’s a tradition that at 12:01 a.m. on Good Friday, people begin to climb the 94 steps up from the street level to Mount Adams’ Holy Cross-Immaculata Parish and pray the rosary. Climb the steps at least once just for the view. You don’t have to be Catholic to participate and the parish has a helpful FAQ online answering questions like, “What does it mean to ‘pray the rosary?’” Holy Cross-Immaculata Parish, 30 Guido St., Mount Adams, 2011.hciparish.org.\n\n40. See something “kinda weird, just like you” during the Cincy Fringe Festival\n\nFor 13 days every summer, Over-the-Rhine spotlights dozens of independent performances during the Cincinnati Fringe Festival. Headquartered at Know Theatre, festival attendees can enjoy not just great, kinda-weird theater, but also visual art, music, public classes and nightly after-parties. Cincinnati Fringe Festival, cincyfringe.com.\n\n41. Pregame for an Elder Football match at Price Hill Chili\n\nPrice Hill Chili is a no-frills West Side staple that has been serving up Cincinnati-style chili and conies — among other typical diner fare — since 1962. After Sunday mass, Catholics migrate from church pews to their restaurant booths. Because of its status as a West Side must, PHC is also heavily frequented pre- and post- Elder High School football games. Games at the all-male Catholic school are played in “The Pit,” and The Panthers rake in fans from around the neighborhood, not just the school (think Friday Night Lights). You can’t truly experience the West Side without doing both, so you might as well just make an entire night out of it. Price Hill Chili, 4920 Glenway Ave., Price Hill, pricehillchili.com.\n\n42. Play a game of cornhole\n\nSometimes called baggo or bag toss, cornhole (the right way to say it) is the official pastime of dads everywhere in Cincinnati. The party game was purportedly developed in the West Side many years ago, though its origins are disputed. Regardless of where it began, however, cornhole is ubiquitous in Cincinnati. Whether you go to a graduation party, a brewery, a camping trip or a tailgating party, cornhole will show up. And you will play. Literally. Everywhere. You cannot escape.\n\n43. Wander in wonder during the Cincinnati Zoo’s Festival of Lights\n\nTake a walk through this wild winter wonderland. The Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden does its annual holiday glow-up with one of the top light displays in the country, giving its usual attractions — like the adorable Fiona — some competition. In addition to 3 million twinkling LED lights, festively adorned foliage, glowing animal sculptures and the ever-so-Instagrammable rainbow-light tunnel, there are also puppet shows, the Toyland Express train ride, everyone’s favorite synchronized holiday music-and-light display on Swan Lake, assorted s’mores stands — and spiked hot chocolate — plus visits from Santa. Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden, 3400 Vine St., Avondale, cincinnatizoo.org.\n\n44. Get a Cincy-themed shirt at Cincy Shirts\n\nEver wished you could wear your love for both the Cincinnati Reds and Cincinnati-style chili on your chest? Or an 8-bit rendering of a local landmark? Or a — definitely not fake — photo of an astronaut planting the Cincinnati flag on the moon? Well, Cincy Shirts knows exactly how you feel, and they’ve created the perfect T-shirt for you to proudly show your Cincinnati pride. Especially if you remember The Uncle Al Show. Multiple locations including 1301 Main St., Over-the-Rhine, cincyshirts.com.\n\n45. Watch out for Krampus at Christkindlmarkt\n\nKrampus is an evil and horned, black-furred German Christmas creature that gives naughty children coal (and, in some versions of the story, carries particularly bad kinder into the woods). Several Krampuses visit the Germania Society’s Christkindlmarkt, a recreation of an authentic Bavarian-style Christmas market at Germania Park, to teach — but not terrify — kids every year. While there, check out the rest of the market, where you’ll find German music, German food (dill pickle soup, spiced gluhwein, strudels, cream puffs) and imported German gifts. Just don’t let Krampus stuff you into his sack. Germania Society, germaniasociety.com.\n\n46. Visit the St. Rose Church flood markers\n\nCincinnati has been submerged by floodwaters many times over the past century, and St. Rose Church has recorded them all. The back of the church is painted with a flood marker, which shows how high the water reached on the building. It's an invitation to imagine what Cincinnati would have been like under about a foot of water (as it apparently was in 1963) or drowned in Ohio River-spillover that reached past the second story of the church, which happened in the disastrous 1937 flood. The church’s website includes some pictures taken in the aftermath of that catastrophe, including one that shows a group of nuns navigating the streets in a rowboat. St. Rose Church, 2501 Riverside Drive, East End, strosecincinnati.org.\n\n47. Slide down the big stone slide at Burnet Woods\n\nFeel like a kid again while skidding down this huge concrete slide in Burnet Woods. The park, located next to the University of Cincinnati campus, also includes the Wolff Planetarium at the Trailside Nature Center, a fishing lake, historic bandstand and plenty of shelters and picnic areas to rest your chapped bottom after a couple trips down the slide. Burnet Woods, 3251 Brookline Ave., Clifton, cincinnatiparks.com.\n\n48. Have a cocktail at Art After Dark at the Cincinnati Art Museum\n\nThe Cincinnati Art Museum hosts monthly nights where the public can visit the museum after hours, experiencing its permanent collection (normally free) and special exhibits (normally ticketed, free for the night). Each evening pairs the art with local music, food and drinks. Cincinnati Art Museum, 953 Eden Park Drive, Mount Adams, cincinnatiartmuseum.org.\n\n49. See the sky illuminate during Balloon Glow at Coney Island\n\nFireworks aren’t the only thing lighting up the sky for the Fourth of July at Coney Island. During the annual Balloon Glow, tethered hot air balloons illuminate the park with glowing color all evening. Guests can walk beneath this dazzling display before a fireworks grand finale over Lake Como. Coney Island, 6201 Kellogg Ave., California, coneyislandpark.com.\n\n50. Show your Pride at Cincinnati’s Pride Parade and Festival\n\nSince 1973, Cincinnati Pride has been providing the LGBTQ+ community and allies with a space to celebrate, affirm and express their individuality regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity or expression. And each year, the Pride Parade and Festival is the largest manifestation of that mission. Attend the parade to see a community coming together — and plenty of decked-out, over-the-top floats. Dress to impress from the sidelines or the procession itself and then head to the family-friendly fest for all-day entertainment. Cincinnati Pride Parade and Festival, cincinnatipride.org.\n\n51. Attend Shakespeare in the Park\n\n“All the world’s a stage,” literally. Or at least, “All the Cincinnati parkland’s a stage.” The Cincinnati Shakespeare Company puts on a free series every summer, bringing the wonder of the Bard's best iambic pentameter to parks, public spaces and other area attractions throughout the Greater Cincinnati region. Cincinnati Shakespeare Company, cincyshakes.com.\n\n52. See fine art at Summerfair\n\nHundreds of artists travel to Coney Island from across the country to display and sell their works at one of the nation's oldest continuous art fairs. The exhibits are accompanied by live performances and food, with all proceeds supporting scholarships and exposure opportunities for student and professional artists. Coney Island, 6201 Kellogg Ave, California, summerfair.org.\n\n53. Try the Best of the Taste at Taste of Cincinnati\n\nTaste of Cincinnati is a long weekend stuffed with the most delicious food the city has to offer — literally, there are prizes awarded for the “Best of Taste.” Over 50 of Cincinnati’s best restaurants take over Fifth Street for the oldest free culinary festival in the nation. Visitors savor their food alongside live performances spread across multiple stages and other tasty entertainment. Taste of Cincinnati, tasteofcincinnati.com.\n\n54. Share a secret at the Whispering Fountains at Union Terminal\n\nIf you talk to these walls, they might just whisper back. The acoustics of the Union Terminal rotunda make it so that if you and a friend stand at the drinking fountains on opposite ends, you can have a conversation across the room by speaking into the wall. Cincinnati Museum Center at Union Terminal, 1301 Western Ave., Queensgate, cincymuseum.org.\n\n55. Drink craft beer and laugh at Cincy Brew Ha-Ha\n\nAmerica’s largest beer and comedy festival boasts a selection of over 100 beers, ciders and wines from more than 85 breweries, which festgoers can down while enjoying free comedic performances from over 80 comedians from across the country. Past headliners have included Michael Ian Black, the Sklar Brothers, Hal Sparks, Bobcat Goldthwait and more. The festival benefits local charities including The Cure Starts Now. Cincy Brew Ha-Ha, cincybrewhaha.com.\n\n56. Practice your James Brown moves at the original King Records site in Evanston\n\nKing Records was a powerhouse of the music world from the 1940s to the 1970s, eventually becoming the sixth-largest record label in the nation. The label launched artists' careers across a variety of genres, from Funk to Country to Rock, including \"Godfather of Soul\" James Brown. The King building is currently abandoned but was recently acquired by the city. Community advocates hope it will become a studio and educational center.\n\n57. Put your dollars to good use at Drag Brunch\n\nBrunch serves several functions in our society, foremost being a graceful means to justify a few drinks before noon. At Metropole’s Drag Brunch, loud music and raucous applause accompany your beverage(s) of choice as the drag queens dance and lip sync through their routines. A bi-monthly event, registration fills up quickly; $35 will cover your brunch and mimosa, but be sure to bring plenty of singles to tip performers like Amaya Sexton, Jessica Dimon, Lexi Love, Sue Nami, Aaliyah Milian and Nichelle Kartier. Events have pleasantly punny names like “Spring Queening” and “Hallowqueen.” Don’t be surprised if this brunch leaves you hungry for more drag shows (and cocktails); just say yass, Queen City. Metropole, 609 Walnut St., Downtown, metropoleonwalnut.com.\n\n58. Cross into Newport on the Purple People Bridge\n\nIt’s purple, it’s for people, and it is, indeed, the main pedestrian bridge connecting Cincinnati and Newport. Walk to Kentucky and back again, show your devotion to your significant other by leaving a love lock, or stick around for one of the events hosted on the bridge. Purple People Bridge, purplepeoplebridge.com.\n\n59. Believe the scary stories at Dent Schoolhouse\n\nFrom a 14-foot tall Necromancer statue to catacombs covered in 4,000 handmade human skulls to a wisecracking tin can, Bud Stross has brought horror to life at Dent Schoolhouse every Halloween. But Dent lays claim to an actual urban legend. After multiple kids went missing from the school in the 1940s and ‘50s and people started noticing a strange smell coming from the basement, Charlie the janitor claimed it was clogged pipes. But in 1955, after more missing children cases, the smell returned. As the story goes, an angry mob burst into the school building and into the basement, where they found the decaying remains of several past students. A search for Charlie began, but he was never found. And the Dent Schoolhouse closed its doors for good. Some say that the spirits of the children — and Charlie himself — still roam the hallways. You can decide for yourself if it’s haunted or nah. Regardless, hundreds flock to Dent — which has been named one of the scariest haunts in the country by multiple publications — year after year for mega scares. Dent Schoolhouse, 5963 Harrison Ave., Dent, frightsite.com.\n\n60. See some lens-based art during the FotoFocus Biennial\n\nThe FotoFocus Biennial sprawls throughout Greater Cincinnati, Northern Kentucky and as even as far as Dayton and Columbus. With the goal of providing greater accessibility to lens and photography-based art, you can view works that are a part of FotoFocus at a number of venues throughout the region. Last year’s event attracted 207,000 visitors — triple of that of their original run in 2012. Next year’s theme has already been announced: light &. “Light is a fundamental aspect of photography. Light implies a force of good, and it conjures hope, clarity and rational thought,” said Kevin Moore, FotoFocus artistic director and curator, in a release. “Exhibitors are asked to consider the phrase light & with what comes after. We’re looking forward to seeing how venues interpret the theme.” FotoFocus Biennial, fotofocus.org.\n\n61. Get a bag of popcorn at the Esquire Theatre\n\nThe Esquire, Mariemont and Kenwood theaters cater to moviegoers with refined tastes for film… and snacks. Offering a vast selection of foreign films and Oscar-shortlisted titles, the Esquire family of cinemas pairs artistry with the best bag of popcorn you’ll find in Cincinnati. Salt and (real) butter flow freely into carbohydrate-stuffed paper sacks, applied carefully enough to harbor the perfect amount of crunch to accompany your cola. It’s classic Americana. If all that popcorn is making you thirsty, each theater is outfitted with a bar to wet your whistle. Visiting film buffs can pour up a star-studded cast of beers, spirits and wines to go with their goodies — the perfect marriage of salt, suds and cinema. Esquire Theatre, 320 Ludlow Ave., Clifton, esquiretheatre.com; Mariemont Theatre, 6906 Wooster Pike, Mariemont, mariemonttheatre.com; Kenwood Theatre, 7815 Kenwood Road, Kenwood, kenwoodtheatre.com.\n\n62. Pay a visit to the Ohio Lesbian Archives\n\nBrowse through decades of Cincinnati and Ohio lesbian herstory at this small but mighty archive. It’s home to shelves of lesbian-centered books, publications, records, films and other remnants of the LGBTQ+ community’s struggle for equality. Open by appointment. Clifton United Methodist Church, 3416 Clifton Ave., Clifton, ohiolesbianarchives.wordpress.com.\n\n63. Watch a movie at The Mini Microcinema\n\nWhen C. Jacqueline Wood started her Mini Microcinema in 2015, it was temporary — she used a $15,000 Globe Grant from the People’s Liberty philanthropic lab to program shorts, art movies and documentaries for several months at the lab’s office space near Findlay Market. It was a hit, and its beautiful red and white cinema sign excited and inspired many to dream about something long missing from Cincinnati’s — and Over-the-Rhine’s — cultural renaissance: a serious-minded cinematheque. This teeny-tiny, 35-seat theater is dedicated to films and other media that break from Hollywood convention. The Microcinema hosts regular film screenings that are free (though a $5 donation is suggested) as well as Adaptation, a book club and movie group. The Mini Microcinema, 1329 Main St., Over-the-Rhine, mini-cinema.org.\n\n64. Drink a latte at Coffee Emporium\n\nCincinnati's oldest coffee house is a great place to meet up with friends, get some work done, relax with a book or conduct a job interview, all with a great cup of joe and some of the best breakfast pastries in the city.

Take a Haunted Tour of Cincinnati\n\nEver felt an eerie chill during a performance at Music Hall or a strange shudder while passing through Washington Park? Hear the story behind these and other purportedly haunted locations by taking an American Legacy Tours Queen City is Haunted Tour — the regular or “ultimate” version. The 90-minute jaunts take you through abandoned cemeteries, sites where human remains have been uncovered, locations related to the most prolific killer in Cincinnati history and other creepy spots. American Legacy Tours, 1332 Vine St., Over-the-Rhine, americanlegacytours.com.\n\n66. Sail the Ohio in a cardboard boat\n\nCardboard and water don’t usually pair well, but the Cardboard Boat Museum in New Richmond, Ohio thinks they go great together. The city is home to the International Cardboard Boat Regatta, which takes place every August. Teams build boats out of, yes, cardboard and then race down the Ohio River. The museum chronicles the history of this unusual race. Cardboard Boat Museum, 311 Front St., New Richmond, cardboardboatmuseum.com.\n\n67. Shoot a wooden eagle at Schützenfest\n\nTranslated as “The Marksman’s Festival,” Schutzenfest began in the 15th century when, according to the legend, a German marksman shot an eagle that attacked a child. When German immigrants settled in Cincinnati, they brought the traditional fest with them, holding the first Schutzenfest here in 1866. Today, the Kolping Society continues the tradition with a weekend that includes a competition for the shooting of a hand-carved eagle, a bier dash and authentic German food. Schutzenfest, schuetzenfestcincy.com.\n\n68. Check out the view from Devou Park\n\nIt is said that Cincinnati is built on seven hills, like Rome — the city is actually named for Roman agrarian and military general Cincinnatus — but the reality is we have plenty more hills, heights and neighborhood names that begin with “Mount” than that. The alternating peaks and valleys of the city create excellent views from a variety of vantage points. There are about 50 classified scenic overlooks throughout the Tristate and many other secret spots from which to see the lights of the city and the winding Ohio River — and Devou Park in Covington might have one of the best. With over 700 acres (plus a golf course, trails, bandstand and history museum), the overlook area is open dawn to dusk and offers a panorama of the city skyline from the Big Mac Bridge and Great American Tower to Carew Tower and the Kroger building. The designated overlook also offers benches, a gazebo, picnic tables and is ADA accessible. Devou Park, 1201 Park Drive, Covington, exploredevoupark.org.\n\n69. Take an ArtWorks mural tour\n\nSince its inception in 2007, the ArtWorks mural program has been a boon to public art along the streets of Cincinnati. The nonprofit organization — dedicated to employing and training local youth and other creative individuals to achieve community impact through art — has created more than 100 of them. To see the centrally located pieces, take ArtWorks’ Spirit of OTR walking tour, a mile-long look at 10 to 12 murals with stories of their origin and how they’re connected to the city. ArtWorks volunteers and the apprentice mural painters responsible for these creations take guests through Cincy’s historic downtown, testing their knowledge of the city’s history and sharing anecdotes from the painting process. ArtWorks, artworkscincinnati.org.\n\n70. Pack a picnic and eat it in Everybody’s Treehouse\n\nFor those who strongly believe treehouses aren’t just for kids, there is a place for you in Mount Airy Forest, and it’s called Everybody’s Treehouse. The wheelchair-accessible structure — the only treehouse like it in Ohio — was built in 2006. It was the vision of then-WCPO reporter Michael Flannery, who worked with the Parks Foundation, Cincinnati Rotary and Forever Young Treehouses to build this childhood nook for all. Bring a book, some lunch or some friends and enjoy this magical public space year-round. Everybody’s Treehouse, 5083 Colerain Ave., Mount Airy, cincinnatiparks.com.\n\n71. Put a coin in The Anchor Grill’s jukebox and watch their animatronic band groove\n\nIt’s verifiable: the more surreal the atmosphere, the better diner food tastes. Three cups of coffee and a plate full of home fries deep into the witching hour, no local hole-in-the wall can compare to the Anchor Grill’s dream-like coziness. Its wood-paneled walls are festooned with lovably hokey knick-knacks and nautical memorabilia. Dim lighting fixtures and ferns form swirls of chiaroscuro color among black leather booths. To top it all off, your jukebox quarters yield a live show for you and your fellow diners: as your ’70s Soft Rock single of choice crackles to life over the Anchor’s speakers, a curtain opens in a small box attached to the ceiling, revealing an animatronic Jazz band comprised of nine handmade puppets and a Barbie doll. The stage, held behind glass, bears an uncanny resemblance to Twin Peaks’ “Red Room,” which is appropriate considering the diner’s Lynchian ambiance. Anchor Grill, 438 W. Pike St., Covington, 859-431-9498.\n\n72. Pick your own sunflowers at Gorman Heritage Farm\n\nIf you follow ‘hip’ folks on Instagram, they probably post an annual #candid of themselves in a field of sunflowers. And most likely, it was taken at Gorman Heritage Farm’s Sunflower Festival. Honestly: totally worth it for the cute pics alone. This autumnal celebration will put you in the seasonal spirit — crisp, early October weather; harvest hues of red, orange and yellow; cozy hayrides (bonus: snag some hot cocoa beforehand); and, duh, sunflowers. You can pick your own from the farm’s field by the stem or by the dozen. The festivities also generally include live music, hayrides, pumpkins and food and craft vendors, so the whole family can find something fun to do. Gorman Heritage Farm, 10052 Reading Road, Evendale, gormanfarm.org.\n\n73. Visit The Swing House (or book an Airbnb weekend)\n\nBuilder/artist Mark de Jong has transformed a three-floor, shotgun-style domicile into the Swing House, a large-scale art installation and rentable home in which the interior has been almost completely opened up — no stairs; no rooms with walls. The center attraction is a 30-foot-long rope swing that lets you travel from end to end imagining the generations who have lived there previously. It’s a trip through time as well as space. Visit during the monthly open house event, every second Saturday from noon-4 p.m. Or book it as an Airbnb for an artful staycation. Swing House, 1373 Avon Place, Camp Washington, swing-house.com.\n\n74. Embark on the Butler County Donut Trail\n\nJust a short 45-minute jaunt from Cincinnati is a magical place called Butler County, home to one of the largest number of donut shops per capita in the Midwest. Among these donut shops are 12 family-run establishments that have come together to offer humans a chance to test the limits of their interest in fried and filled dough, as well as their blood glucose levels. Get an official Donut Trail passport stamped at all of them and get a free T-shirt. Butler County Donut Trail, gettothebc.com/donut-trail.\n\n75. Feed a butterfly at Krohn Conservatory’s Annual Butterfly Show\n\nThe annual interactive butterfly show at this Art Deco greenhouse is kind of a big deal. Navigate your way through clusters of flowers, ferns and trees while hundreds of butterflies flit throughout the room — and maybe right onto your floral-scented butterfly landing pad. Krohn Conservatory, 1501 Eden Park Drive, Mount Adams, cincinnatiparks.com.\n\n76. Ride the Tornado roller coaster at Stricker’s Grove private amusement park\n\nStricker’s Grove is closed to the public for most of the year, save for a few special days in the summer and fall (or if you feel like renting it out for a private event). This family-owned and operated, 25-acre old-fashioned amusement park is home to tons of nostalgic games and classic rides. Play mini-golf and arcade games or take a ride on the Ferris wheel, tilt-a-whirl or swinging pirate ship. If it’s thrills you seek, hop on one of their two roller coasters: the Teddy Bear or Tornado. The wooden Tornado, completed in 1993, was constructed by park owner Ralph Stricker — the only person in the United States to build his own roller coaster. Stricker’s Grove, 11490 Hamilton Cleves Road, Hamilton, strickersgrove.com.\n\n77. Ride the SkyStar Observation Wheel (or Newport’s forthcoming SkyWheel)\n\nCheck out the once-temporary, 136-foot Cincinnati SkyStar as it settles into its permanent residence at The Banks. Or check out the Newport SkyWheel across the river, which boasts about its expected 85-foot advantage over the SkyStar. Or both. The wheels will offer different vantage points of the Cincinnati skyline, so if you find yourself clamoring for more ways to look at the city, just drive a few minutes down the road and hop in another gondola (for a small fee). SkyStar, 55 E. Freedom Way, Downtown, skystarwheel.com.\n\n78. Bathe in neon at the American Sign Museum\n\nGet lost in the ads and landmarks of yesteryear. Winding pathways of colorful signage give way to a mocked-up Main Street, with faux storefronts, cobblestone and giant logos from Howard Johnson, McDonald’s and Marshall Field. From roadside nostalgia and a looming Big Boy to pharmacy signs and gas station markers, the flashing lights, buzzing electricity and rotating wonders are almost a sensory overload. Almost. Guided and self-guided tours available. American Sign Museum, 1330 Monmouth Ave., Camp Washington, americansignmuseum.org.\n\n79. Take a tour of the world’s only ventriloquism museum\n\nNorthern Kentucky’s Vent Haven is the only museum in the world dedicated to the art of ventriloquism. In addition to more than 900 figures, guests can view a library of vent-centric books, playbills and thousands of photographs. The museum also hosts the international ConVENTion every year for hundreds of ventriloquists. Vent Haven Museum, 33 W. Maple Ave., Fort Mitchell, venthaven.org.\n\n80. Buy a trinket at the Lucky Cat Museum\n\nLocated inside Essex Studios, the museum boasts a one-of-a-kind collection of Japanese maneki neko “lucky cat” figures. The glass displays stretch across the walls, containing thousands of styles, colors and sizes of cats. Some are golden, others white with red ears and a green bib. Some don black fur or are chipped. Some are stuffed, others ceramic and plastic. There are some wacky ones, too. All of them, however, carry an undeniable charm. There's even a gift shop, where you can purchase some luck of your own. Lucky Cat Museum, 2511 Essex Place, Walnut Hills, facebook.com/luckycatmuseum.\n\n81. Cruise down the Ohio River on a BB Riverboat\n\nCincinnati was once a hub for steamboat-powered trade and travel, a legacy that lives on in the BB Riverboat fleet. A dinner or sightseeing cruise on one of their ships will make you feel like you’ve stepped into a Mark Twain novel. BB Riverboat, 101 Riverboat Row, Newport, bbriverboats.com.\n\n82. See humans catapult themselves down a hill on a Big Wheel bike during Pendleton’s Danger Wheel\n\nThis annual tournament features teams of three — one to drive and two to give a running start — competing for the title of “Danger Champion.” Racers zip downhill on two-block courses that change throughout the day. It costs to compete, but spectators can watch it all unfold for free while indulging in offerings from local brewers and food trucks. Danger Wheel, dangerhweel.com.\n\n83. Ride the streetcar\n\nWhile originally a contentious public transportation project, the streetcar — currently officially known as the Cincinnati Bell Connector — now offers riders the chance to travel a 3.6-mile loop from Findlay Market to The Banks downtown. With 18 stops (entertainingly narrated by hometown celebrity Nick Lachey), it’s certainly one way to get around whether you’re a tourist or playing one for the weekend. Cars come along every 12 to 15ish minutes and take you past cultural destinations like Music Hall, the Contemporary Arts Center and Fountain Square. Tickets are $2 for a day pass, so it’s a cost-effective way to see city highlights (and/or bar hop) without using your legs. cincinnati-oh.gov/streetcar.\n\n84. Grab some Drive-thru ‘za at Trotta’s Pizza\n\nA beverage drive-thru with above-average pizza, including the Lotta Trotta big-ass pie, available in a variety of interesting topping combinations: the Salami Roll-Up (salami, cream cheese, cheddar cheese and provolone), Chili Pizza (chili and cheddar cheese) and Hot Wing (hot wing sauce, bits of blue cheese, chicken and provolone). Have you actually ever been to the West Side if you’ve never been to Trotta’s? Trotta’s Pizza, 3501 Werk Road, Westwood, trottaspizza.net.\n\n85. See and be seen at Ziegler Pool\n\nLocated in Ziegler Park, this renovated OTR pool is not only a community hot spot, but also a hip place to see and be seen. Partly because of the location (across from Alumni Lofts in the former School for Creative and Performing Arts), partly because of the cost (daily admission is $4 for adults, with free passes allocated for qualifying neighborhood residents) and partly because of the features. There’s a zero-depth entry, lap lanes and a rock climbing wall that arcs out over the water. Pool chairs are available, but seating is first come, first served, so go early on the weekends if you’re looking to lounge. There is a concession stand with Popsicles, soda, etc., and guests are allowed to bring in their own food. No alcohol is served at the pool or allowed to be brought in, but Ziegler does have a liquor license for private events like the monthly Adult Swim parties, sponsored by Rhinegeist and featuring a DJ. Ziegler Pool, 216 Woodward St., Over-the-Rhine, zieglerpark.org.\n\n86. Drink a local beer at Washington Park\n\nWashington Park is a six-acre dream urban escape, complete with a water feature, dog park, playground and its own recently renovated deck bar, which is open seasonally and serves wine, liquor and local craft beer. A new permanent roof structure offers shade and industrial decor vibes, plus cover for additional seating. Sidle up to teal bartop seating and order a brew from Taft’s Ale House, Rhinegeist, Fifty West or the Christian Moerlein Brewing Company. Washington Park, 1230 Elm St., Over-the-Rhine, washingtonpark.org.\n\n87. Eat a late-night 3-Way\n\nBasic beginner stuff, but you can’t be a real Cincinnatian without eating Cincinnati chili. Find it at mom-and-pop parlors, local chains and even veganized. The combo of spaghetti, chili and bright-orange cheese is good any time of day, but especially after a night of drinking. Luckily, plenty of parlors are open late, if not 24 hours, including Camp Washington Chili. A James Beard Award winner, Camp opened its doors in 1940, and Johnny Johnson — the patriarch of the ownership family — has been working at the parlor since 1951. It’s open 24/6; they’re closed on Sundays.\n\n88. Eat a Busken smiley face cookie\n\nBusken Bakery opened in 1928 and quickly became a Cincinnati staple with delicious donuts, bread and apple pies. These classic cookies — decorated with a neon-yellow smiley face — are synonymous with the shop. Grab one at your local Busken Bakery, Kroger or UDF to add a smile to your own face. Multiple locations, busken.com.\n\n89. Remember history’s heroes at the Freedom Center\n\nUsing the city’s historical ties to the anti-slavery movement, the mission of the Freedom Center is “to inspire modern abolition through connecting the lessons of the Underground Railroad with today’s freedom fighters.” Permanent exhibits include a rebuilt 1800s slave pen, The Struggle Continues and a piece of the Berlin Wall. National Underground Railroad Freedom Center, 50 E. Freedom Way, Downtown, freedomcenter.org.\n\n90. Stargaze at the Cincinnati Observatory\n\nKnown as \"The Birthplace of American Astronomy,\" the Cincinnati Observatory is the first public observatory in America and home to one of the oldest working telescopes. The 19th-century telescopes are still used to give visitors an up-close look at the stars. The observatory is open most Thursday and Friday nights (and some Saturday nights) for astronomer presentations and a guided stargaze. Cincinnati Observatory, 3489 Observatory Place, Hyde Park, cincinnatiobservatory.org.\n\n91. Ride Carol Ann’s Carousel at Smale Riverfront Park\n\nCarol Ann’s Carousel at Smale Riverfront Park features 42 hand-carved Cincy-centric animal characters on which to ride (plus 16 hand-painted, stylized landscape murals from local artist Jonathan Queen). The glass-enclosed attraction is rain- and snow-resistant, making it a whimsical year-round pleasure… because the joy of riding Martha the last passenger pigeon, a queen bee or the Findlay Market pig around in circles diminishes significantly if you’re being pelted in the face with rain. In addition to the carousel, the park’s other interactive features include the Fath Fountain’s dancing water jets, a walking labyrinth, a foot piano (like in Big), bench swings with river views and an elevated pig sculpture you can climb into. Smale Riverfront Park, 100 W. Mehring Way, Downtown, cincinnatiparks.com.\n\n92. Eat at a fish fry during Lent\n\nLenten season in Cincinnati can only mean one thing: Fish Fry Fridays are back. (That and someone you know has given up chocolate for 40 days.) Almost every church in Cincinnati — and assorted savvy eateries — offer some type of special fried fish dish on Fridays. But the best way to get a dose of battered and crispy cod is to head down to any Catholic church and partake in the age-old tradition of abstaining from meat at the end of the week. Even if you’re not Catholic, it’s a great way to socialize and enjoy some greasy comfort food (and sometimes beer). One must-attend Lenten event is the Mary, Queen of Heaven Fish Fry (1130 Donaldson Road, Erlanger), home of the “codfather.” This fry boasts a huge menu of Icelandic cod including a signature Holy Haddock sandwich and coveted appearances by the namesake Codfather, aka John Geisen, the CEO of Izzy’s, who dresses in Mafioso gear and carries around a huge stuffed fish for cherished photo ops.\n\n93. Ice skate on Fountain Square\n\nFrom Halloween through President’s Day, the bulk of Fountain Square transforms into a public ice rink for skaters to enjoy for a reasonable rate. Skate rentals are available on-site, as are concessions with hot, cold, alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Bring your family or a date, or just laugh from the sidelines as people struggle to stay on their feet. Fountain Square, 520 Vine St., Downtown, myfountainsquare.com.\n\n94. Take a tour of Rookwood Pottery\n\nFounded by artist Maria Longworth-Nichols in the 1800s, Rookwood Pottery was one of the first female-owned manufacturing companies in the United States. Each piece of tile and pottery is molded, hand-glazed and fired by a team of in-house artists. Tours of the 88,000-square-foot working ceramics factory are offered every Friday at the flagship store in Over-the-Rhine, led by a Rookwood historian. Rookwood Pottery, 1920 Race St., Over-the-Rhine, rookwood.com.\n\n95. Watch planes take off and land at the CVG Aircraft Viewing Area\n\nIf you like watching airplanes, the Cincinnati Northern Kentucky Airport is certainly a top spot for you. And right nearby, CVG’s viewing area is open from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily and has picnic tables, a playground (with plane-shaped attractions), portable potties and an entertaining and up-close view of planes as they enter and leave the city. Informational signage lists optimal viewing times, gives info on different aircraft and more. CVG Aircraft Viewing Area, 1459 Donaldson Highway, Erlanger, cvgairport.com/about/tour/viewing-area.\n\n96. Visit the city’s first police dog at the Police Museum\n\nHandsome was the city’s first police dog. Found by a patrolman in 1898 as an abandoned puppy, the mutt quickly became a fixture at the police station and soon joined daily patrols, chasing down thieves and murderers. He reportedly assisted in hundreds of arrests in the course of his career. After his death in 1912, the beloved beast was stuffed and placed in a glass case to honor his contributions. He is now on public view at the Greater Cincinnati Police Museum, also home to thousands of local law enforcement artifacts and a memorial wall to fallen local, state and federal officers. Greater Cincinnati Police Museum, 308 Reading Road, Pendleton, police-museum.org.\n\n97. Count the gargoyles at Covington’s mini Notre Dame\n\nModeled after Notre Dame in Paris, the Gothic-style Cathedral Basilica of the Assumption on Madison Avenue features 26 Italian-carved gargoyle water spouts, flying buttresses, vaulted arches, columns and one of the world’s largest church stained-glass windows. A perfect substitute while the original Notre Dame is being rebuilt. Cathedral Basilica of the Assumption, 1140 Madison Ave., Covington, covcathedral.com.\n\n98. Find humanity in the dark at the Holocaust & Humanity Center at Union Terminal\n\nFounded in 2000 by Holocaust survivors and their families, the Holocaust & Humanity Center relocated from its former home in a Jewish day school in Kenwood to a 7,500-square-foot exhibition space in the Cincinnati Museum Center. Through moving and modern displays, artifacts, photographs and audio and visual media, the center tells of the mass murder of 6 million Jews by Nazi Germany and its collaborators. And while the museum shows how the Holocaust was a horrific event centered in Europe that spotlighted humanity at its worst, it also explains how it has had a long-lasting impact in Greater Cincinnati by including stories of those survivors who either escaped the Nazis or survived their death camps and came here to start new lives — often arriving at Union Terminal, the grounds of the museum itself, making for a uniquely meaningful experience. Holocaust & Humanity Center, 1301 Western Ave., Queensgate, holocaustandhumanity.org\n\n99. Dress up for a performance at Music Hall\n\nThis 19th-century landmark is home to some of Cincinnati's finest arts groups, including the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra and the Cincinnati Opera. The splendor of the performances is matched by the magnificent interior of the venue, which underwent a significant renovation (completed in 2017) that included acoustic upgrades, new fixtures, more legroom and interesting tech. Embrace the sophisticated elegance by donning your best dress or suit before heading out for an evening of high art. Music Hall, 1241 Elm St., Over-the-Rhine, cincinnatiarts.org/music-hall.\n\n100. Devour a Holtman’s donut\n\nHoltman’s will give you a reason to crawl out of bed on a weekend morning. The Loveland-based operation now has multiple locations that serve up their flaky melt-in-your mouth donuts. Lines for the pastries often wrap outside the door and with good reason: the bakery serves up an array of options — from classic glazed to toasted coconut to lemon-icing-dusted with Fruity Pebbles — to suit any craving. East Siders, rejoice: Later this year, the family-owned business plans to open their fifth location in Oakley. Multiple locations, holtmansdonutshop.com.\n\n101.
