Subscribe to Newcity Today here.\n\nDESIGN\n\nRestrictions Set On Redevelopment Of Century And Consumers Buildings\n\n“With its decision to save the two Loop skyscrapers but nix residential and other reuse, it’s as if the General Services Administration gave the city a bright balloon it wants to jab with a stickpin,” reports the Sun-Times. “While we appreciate the federal government’s safety concerns regarding the Dirksen [courthouse], we also note the Federal Center is surrounded by buildings and has streets running through and around it.” The 194-page impact statement is here.\n\nBetter Streets Chicago Shares LSD Vision\n\nBetter Streets Chicago posts its vision for transforming DuSable Lake Shore Drive into a “transit boulevard.” “A transit boulevard is a high-capacity roadway served by all transportation modes including pedestrians and cyclists, drivers, and transit users. Boulevards often feature dedicated or enhanced transit services like bus rapid transit (BRT) or light rail transit (LRT), wide sidewalks, and high–quality bike lanes.”\n\nTrain Travel Makes American Comeback\n\n“Passengers are taking advantage of expanded rail service across the country, underscoring the demand for alternative modes of transportation,” reports the Wall Street Journal. “Amtrak is on track to set an annual record for ridership as of June. The national passenger railroad has served 24.1 million riders since the beginning of its fiscal year in October, up eighteen percent from a year earlier. And travelers aren’t just flocking to Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor.”\n\nWhere To Eat If You’re Taking The Train From Chicago To Minneapolis\n\n“Amtrak’s new Borealis rail line gives us a chance to taste the Upper Midwest,” writes the Star Tribune. “‘We’re glad you’re here.’ The sign that greets guests in the foyer of Lou Mitchell’s might as well be the Windy City’s official welcome mat. The Chicago diner, which celebrated its centennial last year, claims to have invented many of the hallmarks of a classic American morning meal: an all-day breakfast menu; egg dishes that come out to the dining room in little cast-iron skillets; complimentary containers of house-made orange marmalade on every table; and bottomless cups of really hot coffee… Lou Mitchell’s is only a block away from Union Station, where Amtrak’s new Borealis passenger train from St. Paul arrives in Chicago… The introduction of the Borealis marks the first time in almost fifty years that the Twin Cities has had twice-daily service to Chicago. That makes it possible to get off at one stop to explore and get back on a later train the same day, or to have more options when planning an overnight stay.”\n\nAmerica’s Given Up On Building Subways, But The World Hasn’t\n\n“Cities around the globe are doubling down on transit. Why can’t the United States do the same?” asks Fast Company. “For Americans, state-of-the-art transit systems like the one in Istanbul are about as familiar as the transporter on ‘Star Trek.’ As the United States lavishes billions on highway expansions and subsidizes tricked-out SUVs, other countries are investing in transit systems that are setting new standards for speed, convenience, and technology. Increasingly, transportation is looking like another area of American exceptionalism.”\n\nDINING & DRINKING\n\nFeld Of Dreams: The Thirty-First Course\n\n“There’s remarkable buzz circling the new Ukrainian Village restaurant,” aggregates Eater Chicago. “Overall, the explosive discussions and posts have left Feld’s future [unclear]: [chef] Potashnick’s responses and the feedback it incited demonstrate multiple clear and rapidly widening generational gaps in the Chicago dining community, which are most visible online. There’s an older generation of chefs who believe the best way to navigate the industry is by putting their heads down and working in silence toward their end goals. Meanwhile, some younger chefs and many digitally minded diners (who wield an increasing degree of power, whether it be in social clout or economic stimulation), view social media as the ideal platform for chefs to introduce themselves, their hopes, and their intentions to the guests they hope will populate their businesses.”\n\nTake That Vegas And Nawlins: Montreal Adds Twenty-Four-Hour Drinking Zone\n\n“A growing number of cities around the world are [working to] strengthen their night-time economy,” reports the BBC. “Montreal, Canada’s second-largest city, is planning to take the leap into twenty-four-hour nightlife. Following in the footsteps of Berlin and Tokyo, venues in a new all-night district in Montreal’s city center will be licensed to remain open, and serve alcohol, throughout the night. City officials say the move will bring in hundreds of millions of dollars in additional revenue. Currently bars and clubs in the city have to close by 3am.”\n\nMEDIA\n\nMoneyed Monopoly, Google, Boggled\n\n“A ruling on Google’s search dominance was the first antitrust decision of the modern internet era in a case against a technology giant,” reports the New York Times. “Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,” Judge Amit P. Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said in a 277-page ruling… “The decision is a major blow to Google, which was built on its search engine and has become so closely associated with online search that its name has become a verb. The ruling could have major ramifications for Google’s success, especially as the company spends heavily to compete in the race over artificial intelligence.” The ruling “did not include remedies for Google’s behavior.”\n\nThe Verge adds: “Google’s fate will be determined in the next phase of proceedings, which could result in anything from a mandate to stop certain business practices to a breakup of Google’s search business. Google plans to appeal.” Reuters quotes the ruling: “Sure, users can access Google’s rivals by switching the default search access point or by downloading a rival search app or browser. But the market reality is that users rarely do so… The default is extremely valuable real estate. Because many users simply stick to searching with the default, Google receives billions of queries every day through those access points… Google, of course, recognizes that losing defaults would dramatically impact its bottom line. For instance, Google has projected that losing the Safari default would result in a significant drop in queries and billions of dollars in lost revenues.” (The pdf of the full ruling is here.)\n\nMedia Cuts: Axios, Tampa Bay Times\n\nWhy it matters: You’re fired. Axios is cutting fifty jobs, or ten percent of its staff, reports the New York Times. “The Axios chief executive said in an email to staff that moving forward, the company would increase its focus on national coverage and expand its city-specific newsletters to new locations… The rise of AI… influenced his thinking on how to position his media company, developing a thesis that the only outlets that would survive the technology were ones that had journalistic expertise, trusted content and in-person human connection.”\n\n“The Tampa Bay Times, beset by many of the same revenue challenges facing local news providers across the country, announced it needed to reduce payroll by twenty percent, part of a series of cost-cutting measures,” reports the paper. “The Times, the recipient of fourteen Pulitzer Prizes, said it would offer buyouts to its roughly 270 full-time employees, which includes about a hundred journalists in the newsroom.”\n\nMUSIC\n\nThe Twentieth Anniversary Of The Dave Matthews Band Kinzie Street Incident Is Upon Us\n\n“On the afternoon of August 8, 2004, a charter bus belonging to the Dave Matthews Band drove across the Kinzie Street Bridge and emptied its septic tank over the Chicago River,” reports Block Club. “The sewage ran through the metal grates of the bridge, and rather than landing in the water—itself a health hazard—it splattered onto more than a hundred people on a sightseeing boat operated by the Chicago Architecture Foundation… A few days later, the two Econoline buses in question were identified while parked outside the Peninsula Hotel, where Dave Matthews Band was staying during their Chicago stop. The rest is Chicago history.” Chicago magazine also gets under the bus with an oral history.\n\nGrant Park Neighbors Frustrated By Lolla, NASCAR Summer Takeovers\n\n“After the conclusion of Grant Park’s twentieth Lollapalooza, the festival name still hung in red bubble letters Monday morning above Ida B. Wells Drive. Security guards lined the path to Buckingham Fountain and traffic patrols stood in the middle of major intersections, directing traffic around road closures,” reports the Trib. “Neighbors say they are unhappy with the increase in private events that limit access to the public park during the prime summer months.”\n\nChicago Symphony Principal Trumpet Leaves For Philly\n\n“Philadelphia Orchestra has just signed Esteban Batallán as principal trumpet, starting next month,” reports Slipped Disc. “The Spanish virtuoso, forty, has put in five years in the role at the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, where he was recruited by Riccardo Muti.”\n\nCincy Symphony And Union Reach Agreement\n\n“A five-year agreement with the American Federation of Musicians Local 1 provides a base salary increase of twenty-three percent,” reports Cincinnati CityBeat.\n\nSTAGE\n\nLast-Minute COVID Show Cancellations Return\n\n“This past weekend, the Goodman Theatre called off two performances of ‘Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil’ just before curtain time,” reports Chris Jones at the Tribune. “On Saturday they couldn’t round up enough understudies to cover all the sick cast members; on Sunday they had the same problem with backstage crew… The problem Saturday… was a lack of available understudies after illness occurred in the cast and several cast members called out.” On Sunday there weren’t enough “people in the wardrobe run crew… to make the show happen… Theaters may go ahead with some kind of performance, or offer patrons some kind of compensatory concert staging, but the Goodman elected to cancel… some minutes after the advertised curtain time.”\n\nARTS & CULTURE & ETC.\n\nRick Kogan Muses On The River\n\nA chance encounter with Lollapalooza tourists led to a reverie, writes Rick Kogan at the Tribune. (free link). “I started thinking about this river, cut by ancient waters and first discovered by the people native to this place and I realized, not for the first time, that without the river (and the Lake) we would be Nebraska. Still, the river was not always respected. It was used, to be frank, as a toilet. It was a poor people’s neighborhood, starting in the 1840s when the poorest huddled along its banks, as the wealthy preferred to live elsewhere… Sitting on the banks of the river Sunday as morning came to noon, I remembered the lines that ended a book written by Norman Maclean, the great Chicago writer: ‘Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it. The river was cut by the world’s great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time. On some of the rocks are timeless raindrops. Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs.'”\n\nChristkindlmarket Leaves Wrigleyville; Union Station Cancels Polar Express\n\n“Organizers of the popular Christkindlmarket announced the German-style outdoor market will not return to Wrigley Field’s Gallagher Way in 2024,” reports Block Club, “due to the NHL Winter classic and additional programming.” But “officials with the German-American Events announced the twenty-eighth season set to open November 22 at Daley Plaza in Chicago, and at RiverEdge Park in Aurora,” relays the Trib. Also: Polar Express train rides are canceled this Christmas. “This year’s rides, based out of Union Station… are canceled for 2024 due to ‘extensive city street reconstruction’ above the station, organizers of the event wrote in a Facebook post. Tickets for the rides typically sell out months in advance.”\n\nBuckeye Cannabis Lights Up\n\nRecreational marijuana is now on sale at a hundred locations in Ohio, reports the Tribune.\n\nFor The Love Of Ghosts: Spirit Halloween Stores Now Open\n\n“Spirit Halloween locations across the Chicago area are already open and ready for customers,” reports WMAQ-TV."
