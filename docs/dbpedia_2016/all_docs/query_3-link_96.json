        "text": "According to a recent study published by Apartment Guide, Cincinnati is the best city in the nation for lovers of fast-casual Mexican grill Chipotle.\n\nYes. We are No. 1. So congrats to us.\n\nWe have more Chipotle locations per capita than anywhere else in the U.S. Based on the infographic below, there is 1 Chipotle per 3.5ish red human-shaped things?\n\nTo get their rankings, the site took cities with more than 100,000 people and calculated the number of Chipotle locations in each city, dividing each location's population by the number of Chipotle restaurants to get a per capita ranking. Based on that, if Cincinnati has a population of 301,301 and 18 Chipotles, there is one restaurant for every 16,740ish people.\n\nChipotle has more than 2,000 restaurants across the U.S. but the top 10 restaurants on this list are \"pretty much a Mecca for Chipotle lovers.\"\n\nAccording to the write-up,\n\n\"Cincy's 18 Chipotles are impressive, and you won't find a better per capita ratio in the entire country. Believe it or not, there's even better news. Two words: Drive-thru. Cincinnati also boasts the least expensive rent on our top 10 list, with an average one-bedroom coming in at $1,027. Winner, winner, chicken (taco) dinner!\"\n\nOthers on the list include:\n\nNo. 2: Orlando, Florida\n\nNo. 3: Scottsdale, Arizona\n\nNo. 4: Alexandria, Virginia\n\nNo. 5: Cambridge, Massachusetts\n\nNo. 6: Cleveland, Ohio\n\nNo. 7: Minneapolis, Minnesota\n\nNo. 8: Pittsburg, Pennsylvania\n\nNo. 9: Lakewood, Colorado\n\nNo. 10: Saint Paul, Minnesota\n\nRead more here.\n\n*This story has been updated because that infographic is slightly confusing."
