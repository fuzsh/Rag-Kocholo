That’s good enough for us.\n\nWhere is the nearest Skyline Chili?\n\nUse our locations page to find a Skyline close to home, work or wherever you are right now.\n\nWhat should I order at Skyline?\n\nOur two most popular menu items are our 3-Way Chili and Cheese Coneys. One taste and you’ll know why they have been our best sellers since 1949. Feeling a bit more adventurous? Try a 4-Way with beans or onions, or a 5-way with beans AND onions.\n\nIs Skyline Chili open now?\n\nMost Skyline restaurants are open seven days a week. Different locations have different hours. You can find details for each restaurant on our locations page.\n\nWhat states have Skyline Chili?\n\nYou’ll find our unique chili parlors in Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, and Florida.\n\nWhat are the ingredients in Skyline Chili?\n\nSkyline Chili is made from a secret family recipe passed down through generations. We can’t tell you the specifics, but we’re sure you’ll like it.\n\nWhat is Cincinnati Style Chili?\n\nThe term is used to describe a unique type of chili that originated in the Cincinnati area. Based on Greek family recipes, it is different from Southwestern or Texas-style chili.\n\nIs Skyline hiring?\n\nWe are always looking for qualified workers who share our passion for serving amazing 3-Ways and Cheese Coneys.\n\nCan I own a Skyline franchise?\n\nYes, you can own your own Skyline Chili restaurant.
