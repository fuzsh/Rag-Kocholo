It got its appeal because of its ability to float. After a fire at their first factory, Procter & Gamble moved to a new factory on the Mill Creek and began soap production again, which eventually led to the area being known as Ivorydale. [Writers' Program of the Works Project Administration, \"Cincinnati: A Guide to the Queen City and its Neighbors\"]\n\nCincinnati weathered the Great Depression better than most American cities of its size, largely because of a resurgence of inexpensive river trade. The rejuvenation of downtown began in the 1920s and continued into the next decade with the construction of Union Terminal, the post office, and a large Bell Telephone building. The flood of 1937 was one of the worst in the nation's history, resulting in the building of protective flood walls. After World War II, Cincinnati unveiled a master plan for urban renewal that resulted in modernization of the inner city. Riverfront Stadium and Riverfront Coliseum were completed in the 1970s, as the Cincinnati Reds baseball team emerged as one of the dominant teams of the decade. In December 1979, eleven people were killed in a mass panic prior to a rock-and-roll concert at the Coliseum by the band The Who. In 1989, the 200th anniversary of the city's founding, much attention was focused on the city's Year 2000 plan, which involved further revitalization.\n\nThe completion of several major new development projects enhance the city as it enters the early years of the new millennium. Cincinnati's beloved Bengals and Reds teams both have new, state-of-the-art homes: Paul Brown Stadium, opened in 2000; and the Great American Ball Park, opened in 2003, respectively. Two new museums have opened: the Rosenthal Center for Contemporary Art in 2003, and the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center in 2004. With many delays and political setbacks, the City of Cincinnati and Hamilton County are currently planning The Banks--a 24-hour urban neighborhood of restaurants, clubs, offices, and homes with sweeping skyline views, along the city's riverfront. Cincinnati has received such accolades as \"Most Liveable City\" (1993), Partners for Livable Communities, April 2004; number five U.S. arts destination, American Style Magazine, Summer 2004; was the highest rated city in Ohio for \"Best Cities For Young Professionals\" and 18th overall, Forbes Magazine, June 2007 [ [http://www.forbes.com/2007/06/21/cities-jobs-young-forbeslife-cx_mw_0621realestate.html Best Cities For Young Professionals - Forbes.com] ] ; and inclusion in the top ten \"Cities that Rock,\" Esquire Magazine, April 2004. [The Cincinnati Historical Society]\n\nGeography\n\nCincinnati is located at coor dms|39|8|10|N|84|30|11|W|region:GR (39.136160, -84.503088)GR|1, with a core metro area spanning parts of Southern Ohio and Northern Kentucky. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 79.6 square miles (206.1 km²), of which, 78.0 square miles (201.9 km²) of it is land and 1.6 square miles (4.1 km²) of it (2.01%) is water. The city spreads over a number of hills, bluffs, and low ridges overlooking the Ohio River in the Bluegrass region of the country. Although sometimes referred to as part of the Midwest, Cincinnati is geographically located within the periphery of the Upland South.\n\nClimate\n\nCincinnati is located within the northern limit of the humid subtropical climate and the southern limit of the Humid continental climate zone, with average temperatures by U.S. standards. Summers are generally warm and humid with slightly cooler evenings. July is the warmest month, with an average high of 87°F (31°C) and an average low of 68°F (20°C). Winters are colder, with occasional snow fall. January is the coldest month, with an average high of 38°F (3°C) and an average low of 21°F (-6°C). Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed each month, averaging 41 inches of rainfall and 16 inches of snowfall annually. The highest recorded temperature was 109.0 °F (42.8 °C) on July 21 1934, and the lowest recorded temperature was -25°F (-32 °C) on January 18 1977.\n\nInfobox Weather\n\nsingle_line= Yes\n\nlocation = Cincinnati\n\nJan_REC_Hi_°F = 74\n\nFeb_REC_Hi_°F = 76\n\nMar_REC_Hi_°F = 85\n\nApr_REC_Hi_°F = 90\n\nMay_REC_Hi_°F = 94\n\nJun_REC_Hi_°F = 101\n\nJul_REC_Hi_°F = 101\n\nAug_REC_Hi_°F = 103\n\nSep_REC_Hi_°F = 100\n\nOct_REC_Hi_°F = 91\n\nNov_REC_Hi_°F = 82\n\nDec_REC_Hi_°F = 75\n\nYear_REC_Hi_°F = 103\n\nJan_Hi_°F = 38.4\n\nFeb_Hi_°F = 42.8\n\nMar_Hi_°F = 54.4\n\nApr_Hi_°F = 65.5\n\nMay_Hi_°F = 75.2\n\nJun_Hi_°F = 83.3\n\nJul_Hi_°F = 86.6\n\nAug_Hi_°F = 85.1\n\nSep_Hi_°F = 78.8\n\nOct_Hi_°F = 67.5\n\nNov_Hi_°F = 54.8\n\nDec_Hi_°F = 43.1\n\nYear_Hi_°F = 64.6\n\nJan_Lo_°F = 21.2\n\nFeb_Lo_°F = 24.4\n\nMar_Lo_°F = 34.2\n\nApr_Lo_°F = 43\n\nMay_Lo_°F = 52.7\n\nJun_Lo_°F = 61.5\n\nJul_Lo_°F = 66.1\n\nAug_Lo_°F = 64.2\n\nSep_Lo_°F = 57.2\n\nOct_Lo_°F = 44.6\n\nNov_Lo_°F = 35.9\n\nDec_Lo_°F = 26.7\n\nYear_Lo_°F = 44.3\n\nJan_REC_Lo_°F = -22\n\nFeb_REC_Lo_°F = -9\n\nMar_REC_Lo_°F = -6\n\nApr_REC_Lo_°F = 19\n\nMay_REC_Lo_°F = 27\n\nJun_REC_Lo_°F = 39\n\nJul_REC_Lo_°F = 47\n\nAug_REC_Lo_°F = 43\n\nSep_REC_Lo_°F = 32\n\nOct_REC_Lo_°F = 18\n\nNov_REC_Lo_°F = -3\n\nDec_REC_Lo_°F = -14\n\nYear_REC_Lo_°F = -22\n\nJan_Precip_inch = 2.5\n\nFeb_Precip_inch = 2.5\n\nMar_Precip_inch = 4.2\n\nApr_Precip_inch = 3.7\n\nMay_Precip_inch = 4.4\n\nJun_Precip_inch = 3.4\n\nJul_Precip_inch = 4.1\n\nAug_Precip_inch = 3.7\n\nSep_Precip_inch = 3.1\n\nOct_Precip_inch = 2.8\n\nNov_Precip_inch = 3.3\n\nDec_Precip_inch = 3.1\n\nYear_Precip_inch = 40.7\n\nsource =Weatherbasecite web\n\nurl =http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=090527&refer= |title =Weatherbase: Historical Weather for Cincinnati Ohio, United States of America | publisher=Weatherbase | year=2007 | accessdate=2008-04-05]\n\naccessdate = April 2008\n\nCityscape\n\nDowntown Cincinnati is focused around Fountain Square, a popular public square and gathering place for many events.\n\nCincinnati is home to numerous structures that are noteworthy due to their architectural characteristics or historic associations including the Carew Tower, the Scripps Center, the Ingalls Building, Cincinnati Museum Center at Union Terminal, and the Isaac M. Wise Temple.\n\nThe city is undergoing significant changes due to an influx of new development and private investment as well as the construction of the long stalled Banks project. Currently, there has been nearly $3.5 billion invested in urban core of Cincinnati (including Northern Kentucky), and with a streetcar underway, it is anticipated that even more investment will take place.\n\nConstruction has begun on a new building that will dominate the Cincinnati skyline. Queen City Square is scheduled to be open in 2011. The building will be the tallest in Cincinnati and the third tallest in Ohio, reaching a height of 660 feet.

Prior to 1924, city council was elected through a system of wards. The ward system lent itself to corruption and Cincinnati was run by the Republican political machine of \"Boss\" Cox from the 1880s through the 1920s with a few brief interludes. A reform movement arose in 1923, led by another Republican, Murray Seasongood. Seasongood eventually founded the Charter Committee, which used ballot initiatives in 1924 to eliminate the ward system and replace it with the current at-large system and also to introduce a city manager form of government. From 1924 to 1957, the council was selected by proportional representation. Beginning in 1957, all candidates ran in a single race and the top nine vote-getters were elected (the \"9-X system\"). The mayor was selected by the council. In 1977 Jerry Springer, later a controversial television talk show host, was chosen to serve one year as mayor. Starting in 1987, the top vote-getter in the city council election automatically became mayor. Starting in 1999, the mayor was chosen in a separate election and the city manager received a lesser role in government; these reforms were referred to as the \"strong mayor\" reforms. Cincinnati politics include the participation of the Charter Party, the party with the third-longest history of winning in local elections.\n\nRace relations\n\nBefore the Civil War, Cincinnati was a bordertown between the states that allowed slavery, such as Kentucky, and those that did not, such as Ohio. Cincinnati and surrounding areas played a major role in Abolitionism. The area was a part of the Underground Railroad and was home to Harriet Beecher Stowe. Her characters in Uncle Tom's Cabin were based on escaped slaves she met in the area. Levi Coffin made the Cincinnati area the center of his anti slavery efforts in 1847. [Reminiscences of Levi Coffin, the reputed president of the underground railroad: being a brief history of the labors of a lifetime in behalf of the slave, with the stories of numerous fugitives, who gained their freedom through his instrumentality, and many other incidents. Coffin, Levi, 1798-1877, Cincinnati: Western tract society, Ann Arbor, Michigan: University of Michigan Library] Today, The National Underground Railroad Freedom Center commemorates the era at its center located at 50 East Freedom Way.\n\nIn 2001 a series of racially charged riots occurred after the shooting death of a black male, Timothy Thomas, by police during a foot pursuit.\n\nCrime"
