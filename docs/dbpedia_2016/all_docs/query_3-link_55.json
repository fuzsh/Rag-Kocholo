        "text": "Every day, we all go about our business in Greater Cincinnati. We work. We eat. We shop. We party. We unwind.\n\nBut as we mark things from our neverending to-do lists, how often do we stop to think about how lucky we are to have so much of what we need within a short walk, drive or transit ride? How often do we think about the culture, entertainment and business that Cincinnati has developed over the years? How often do we think about the parks and public spaces that add some serenity to our hustle? And how often do we think about the folks who make it all happen?\n\nThe Queen City is fortunate to have so many people contributing to the region’s vitality in different ways. At CityBeat, we try to highlight many of them in our regular digital and print coverage, but we love to go overboard in our annual Best of Cincinnati issue. In our 2024 edition, our writers are calling attention to the excellence they’ve discovered both in their personal lives and while covering our fair city. Yes, we’ve got our favorite burgers and nightclubs and city improvements, but there also are plenty of surprises in the pages ahead.\n\nBut Cincinnati is vast, and there’s more greatness here than our team will ever be able to count or experience. That’s why we rely on you, our readers, to point us toward Greater Cincy’s unsung heroes who have – in one way or another – become indispensable in your daily lives. Thanks to your votes earlier this year, you’ve helped choose tops in hundreds categories in the 2024 Best of Cincinnati issue.\n\nSo soak it all in, Cincinnati. This is the place we call home, and we’re all the better for it."
