        "text": "An Iowa county has received money as part of a $48.5 million federal grant to protect the rusty patched bumble bee and preserve its habitat.\n\nThe grant is aimed at restoring endangered species and their habitats across the country. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has allocated more than $635,000 to Winneshiek County to protect the bee and its native surroundings.\n\nPam Mackey-Taylor, director of the Iowa Chapter of the Sierra Club, said the rusty patched bumble bee is a critical part of the natural ecosystem.\n\n\"It pollinates prairie plants, pollinates garden plants, fruit trees, ornamental plants,\" Mackey-Taylor explained. \"It's important to keep the pollinator services from the rusty patched bumble bee available and are certainly necessary.\"\n\nThe Fish and Wildlife Service is awarding more than $48 million to 19 states for habitat conservation projects, to benefit 80 endangered and at-risk species across the country.\n\nThe bee lives on prairie and marsh lands and makes its colonies underground. Mackey-Taylor pointed out the grant money will be used to make sure the areas the bee relies on most will be protected from invasive species, which will allow the things they need to thrive.\n\n\"Blooming flowers throughout the spring, summer and fall so that there's a nectar source,\" Mackey-Taylor noted. \"And make sure the bees are protected from sprays, fungicides, herbicides and insecticides.\"\n\nPesticide overspray and drift can often be a problem for Iowa farmers trying to manage weeds and pests, which could affect the bee habitat the grant is designed to protect.\n\nDisclosure: The Sierra Club contributes to our fund for reporting on Climate Change/Air Quality, Energy Policy, Environment, and Environmental Justice.

The treaty also encourages the use of reusable options, such as single-use bags, straws and utensils.\n\nCheyenne Rendon, senior policy officer for the Society of Native Nations, said supporters need to focus on the people the treaty will serve.\n\n\"The United States has already conveyed that they're not willing to operate out of current existing laws,\" Rendon pointed out. \"Although their approach is, they are for the global plastics treaty, it's at the lowest denomination of a treaty as possible. So that's why we have to lead with this with a human-based approach. How are we going to take care of not only our planet, but our people?\"\n\nTexas is one of the largest producers of fossil fuels and plastic in the nation, with most coming from the Houston Ship Channel. It is the second-largest petrochemical complex in the world and surrounded by low-income communities of color. People in the area have life expectancies up to 20 years shorter than those in white communities just 15 miles away.\n\nAmnesty International recently deemed the Houston Ship Channel a \"sacrifice zone,\" meaning residents suffer devastating physical and mental health consequences, along with human rights violations from living in pollution hotspots.\n\nYvette Arellano, founder of the group Fenceline Watch, said they have promoted environmental change at the local and state levels for years. They argued by backing the plastics treaty, they are taking their concerns nationally and globally.\n\n\"We're in collaboration with over 300 other organizations, from grassroots to academics and legal organizations,\" Arellano explained. \"Trying to uplift the severe human rights violations that petrochemical companies and the fossil fuel industry, along with false solutions they're bringing along.\"\n\nArellano added there is no way for people living in the area to escape the poison.\n\n\"Whether we are at home, outside gardening or spending leisure time with family, whether we're at school at the grocery store, at the post office,\" Arellano outlined. \"We're consistently and continuously being poisoned with full and free license to, on behalf of our regulatory agencies.\"\n\nThe groups will testify at the United Nations later this year.\n\nget more stories like this via email\n\nHurricane season is here, and conservationists are shining a light on the role salt marshes play in protecting coastal North Carolina communities.\n\nStudies find that salt marshes absorb flood waters and wave energy, reducing property damage in nearby areas by an average 20%.\n\nCharlie Deaton, a habitat protection biologist at the North Carolina Division of Marine Fisheries, explained what salt marshes do to help areas build climate resilience.\n\n\"They're good at helping us actually mitigate some of the carbon we've released into the atmosphere, and they are good for community resilience, too,\" he said. \"They protect landward shorelines from erosion, and salt marshes' larger scales can actually reduce the impacts of storm surge and reduce flooding from that.\"\n\nNorth Carolina has about 220,000 acres of salt marshes, but the protections they offer are dependent on their health and preservation. Coastal development, pollution and climate change all pose threats to these ecosystems. Deaton said plans are in place to help restore them. The South Atlantic Salt Marsh Initiative aims to save 1 million salt-marsh acres, from North Carolina to Florida.\n\nAs hurricane activity is projected to increase in frequency and intensity, the role of salt marshes in protecting coastal communities becomes even more critical. Deaton said the evidence is clear that restoring these landscapes is urgent if we want to keep them.\n\n\"And if we start to lose our salt marshes,\" he said, \"we're going to start to lose our nursery areas, and that's going to have negative impacts on our fish stocks and our fishing communities that depend on them, not to mention the direct community resilience benefits of preventing erosion and reducing storm surge.\"\n\nAt the state level, North Carolina also has a Salt Marsh Action plan to enhance and rejuvenate salt marshes. Deaton emphasized the importance of coupling these efforts with others that reduce pollution to safeguard coastal communities.\n\nSupport for this reporting was provided by The Pew Charitable Trusts.\n\nget more stories like this via email\n\nSummer temperatures are one more reason for concern by environmental groups about the nuclear waste stored along the Great Lakes.\n\nThere are three nuclear power plants in Michigan and 23 in the Great Lakes watershed. Many of the facilities store their hazardous waste outdoors, in dry-cask storage along the waters in Michigan and Canada. Environmental groups said about 80,000 tons of high-level radioactive waste now rest near the Great Lakes.\n\nKevin Kamps, radioactive waste specialist for the nonprofit Beyond Nuclear, said proximity to major freshwater sources is just one issue.\n\n\"The dangers are, you have to 'radiation field' this stuff constantly, because exposure to a person at close range can deliver a fatal dose of radiation within a matter of minutes,\" Kamps explained. \"You also need to contain it and isolate it from the environment.\"\n\nThe Michigan group Citizens' Resistance at Fermi II is working with other local and national organizations to find solutions. They include promoting renewable energy and demanding authorities such as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission enforce what's known as \"hardened\" on-site storage, which they believe can more safely secure nuclear waste.\n\nDTE Energy, the operator of Fermi II, responded to the concerns in a statement, saying in part \"Fermi's used fuel is stored in hardened canisters, protected per strict federal guidelines and constantly monitored.\"\n\nJesse Deer In Water, community organizer for Citizens Resistance at Fermi II, said many people are under the impression there are no radiation leaks from the dry-cask storage fuel ponds but his organization disagrees.\n\n\"Because it's still hot fuel inside of it,\" Deer In Water asserted. \"It's still highly unstable and for it to be just completely contained without any venting causes it to, like, build up, like a radioactive gas inside of it that can, like, catch on fire and explode.\"\n\nDTE Energy also noted the canisters \"undergo rigorous testing and analysis to ensure they can safely hold up through natural disasters.\"\n\nDisclosure: Citizens' Resistance at Fermi II contributes to our fund for reporting on the Environment, Environmental Justice, Native American Issues, and Nuclear Waste.
