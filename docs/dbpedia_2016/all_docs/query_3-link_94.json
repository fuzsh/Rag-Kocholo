        "text": "Cincinnati's city center is an ever-expanding hub for foodies and nightlife enthusiasts. Here are some of the places that are opening soon — or have recently opened — in Over-the-Rhine, Pendleton and downtown.\n\nComing Soon:\n\nBaüer Market — Baüer Farm Kitchen is set to expand via the culinary wiles of chef Jackson Rouse with a new German-themed coffee and lunch stop. The expansion — dubbed Baüer Markt — will be located on the first floor of 435 Elm St., downtown. Baüer Farm Kitchen currently occupies the subterranean space below it. Baüer Markt will serve “early morning and daytime favorites,” according to a press release. With a full espresso bar, patrons can sip (or chug) everything from cortados to macchiatos. The Markt's coffee will be sourced from Sharonville-based Coffee Make.\n\nCobblestone OTR — This new bar will be located at 1132 Race St. in Over-the-Rhine, across from Washington Park. According to its website, \"Bars are the great intersections of life. They’re where we cross paths to celebrate, relax, meet someone new and connect with old friends, all while enjoying the perfect drink. Stop by to mingle with neighbors, wind down after a day at Washington Park or just to say hi — we’ll be ready with a lineup of your favorite beer, wine and cocktails.\" So expect that.\n\nHoliday Liquor Bar — Located at 1538 Race St. in Over-the-Rhine, this new bar concept from the team behind Senate/Abigail Street/Pontiac (aka the Queen City Hospitality Group) got some backlash earlier this year when it was announced they would be removing the old Olley's Trolley mural when they renovated the building. It will be a \"dive bar\" concept off the main drag of nightlife destinations in OTR and will feature a food menu, though drinks will be the focus. Co-owner Daniel Wright told the Cincinnati Enquirer the food would focus on tacos al pastor and tacos árabes, with a shawarma-style meat.\n\nNorthern Row Brewery — This new brewery will be located in the old pre-Prohibition Christian Moerlein lager house at 111 W. McMicken Ave. in Over-the-Rhine. According to the brewery, the name is taken from an old Cincinnati nickname for Liberty Street and its role in the brewing industry. Northern Row will \"pay tribute to our roots as a historic lager house, committed to revisiting traditional lagers but we also look forward, pledged to bring consistent, clean, and flavorful ales that drive the craft beer world today. Our spirits catalog will similarly mirror our beer portfolio. Old recipes will meet new, combining to push the envelope while also respecting tradition.\" Chef Jose Salazar will be curating the food menu and you can sample some Northern Row beers now at these locations.\n\nOddfellows Liquor Bar and Mikey's Late Night Slice — This Columbus bar is expanding into the Queen City with a dual-purpose establishment at 2014 Elm St., just down the way from Rhinegeist. There will be drinks and pizza.\n\nOTR Bagel Bar — This Findlay Market bagelry is slated to open soon. According to our interview with the team behind OTR Bagel Bar in 2017, the space will take its decorative cue and overall ambiance from a “nostalgic” stance. The tables will have gameboard tops — ’80s board games will be present to play — and colorful chairs have been sourced from elementary schools. A tentative lineup of 10 standard bagels — such as poppy seed, onion, everything and plain — and specialty bagels like carrot cake will grace the menu. They will also be making specialty cream cheeses, like jalapeño and cookie dough, and bagel breakfast sandwiches.\n\nPins Mechanical Co. — From the Columbus-based Rise Brands, the group behind 16-Bit, this new bar at 1124 Main St., OTR will have 25 pinball machines and 10 duckpin bowling lanes, plus other “old school” entertainment options like foosball, bocce ball and shuffle board. The three-story bar will also boast a rooftop patio.\n\nPlatform Brewing Co's LOCOBA — Craft brewer Platform Beer Co., which opened in Cleveland in 2014, has its sights set on Over-the-Rhine. The company is working with local developer Urban Sites to open its third Ohio-based taproom — a 2,500-square-foot space at 1201 Main St. (that navy and red building across from Japp’s). According to a statement from Platform, the Cincinnati brewery will combine beer, coffee and barrel aging.\n\nSam Adams Cincinnati Taproom — Starting Nov. 15, Cincinnati’s brew enthusiasts will have yet another option for social sipping: the Samuel Adams Cincinnati Tap Room in Over-the-Rhine, located across from the Samuel Adams Cincinnati Brewery at the Urban Sites’ Film Center Project adjacent to Findlay Market. The taproom, which features indoor and outdoor space, spans nearly 9,000 feet, offering an array of unique beers brewed both onsite and at the Cincinnati Brewery. These include fan favorites like the Cincinnati-inspired lager 513, Boston Lager and Summer Ale.\n\nSocial OTR — Social O.T.R., a new \"culinary training restaurant\" slated to open next to Findlay Market, recently completed a successful Kickstarter campaign that raised $20,104 thanks to the pledges of 64 backers. Described as a collaborative social enterprise between Findlay Market and CityLink Center, Social O.T.R.'s purpose is to prepare the next generation of culinary professionals for the working world, acting as a 16-week educational program that serves the community's unemployed and underemployed talent pool while still maintaining a fine dining experience in an operating restaurant.\n\nNew:\n\nZundo Ramen & Donburri — This restaurant promises “soulful” ramen — a traditional Japanese dish consisting of a meat or fish-based broth, noodles and a range of vegetables and protein — to foodies in OTR. Zundo also offers traditional Japanese cuisine with a modern twist, like Donburi (a stew that consists of various meats and vegetables served over steamed rice) topped with eel or sashimi, plus a full bar featuring Japanese classics like sake and soju. 220 W. 12th St., Over-the-Rhine, zundootr.com.\n\nMoney Chicken — The team behind Pleasantry has brought a unique spin on chicken to Cincinnati’s Central Business District: a “chef-driven fast-casual” chicken eatery that holds on to values of rich flavor and sustainable sourcing, but operates in a capacity to accommodate downtown lunch and dinner hours. 300 E. Seventh St., Downtown. More info here.\n\nThe Arepa Place — This former Findlay Market booth has transferred to a full storefront space and expanded its menu of South American staples. Find arepas with fillings like chorizo and cheese or black beans, cheese and fried plantains; ground beef, cheese, chicken or potato and eggplant empanadas; and sides like plantain chips. 131 W. Elder St., Over-the-Rhine, arepaplace.com.\n\nMaize OTR — Maize, a new Over-the-Rhine eatery which opened in early July, specializes in a unique fusion menu that honors traditional recipes from across Latin America, with an emphasis on Venezuelan cuisine. The menu is colorful and varied, with dishes from across the region that complement one another while retaining their traditional roots — such as Peruvian ceviche, Mexican street corn and Venezuelan cachapas and asado negro. Read a full review here. 1438 Race St., Over-the-Rhine, 513-381-1608, maizeotr.com.\n\nLouVino — Midwestern Cincinnati got another dose of Southern cooking with the opening of Louisville, Ky.-based LouVino. But that palate comes with twist, says owner, Chad Coulter. Expect small plates to pass around the table. Coulter says that a party of two could order four to five plates between them and expect wide, varied, flavored dishes. You can wash that down wine, because they offer over 60 types by the glass and 17 wine flights. Plus, a wide range of bourbons, cocktails and beer. 1142 Main St., Over-the-Rhine, louvino.com.\n\n13th Street Alley — The new 13th Street Alley cheesesteak walk-up window is located at 126 E. 13th St., Over-the-Rhine. For more info, call 513-813-8000 or visit their Facebook page.\n\nBoom Box Buns — Calling all bun lovers: A new walk-up window serving up warm, doughy, steamed Chinese buns (or baozi) opened in Over-the-Rhine. Boombox Buns currently offers three different bun options; the Pork Bun with hoison peanuts and radish, the Beef Bun with mayo shisho and crispy shallot, and the Veg Bun with sweet potato and Sriracha. In addition to buns, they also have Thai iced tea as a drink option. They are open Friday and Saturday, from 7 p.m. until they're sold out. Follow their Instagram page for updates: @boomboxbuns 1324 Main St., Over-the-Rhine.\n\nPendleton Parlor — Summer has come to an end and fall weather is on its way, but Pendleton's new creamy whip understands that soft-serve knows no seasons. At the new Pendleton Parlor, a bona fide second location of Old Milford Parlor, visitors can order from a diverse menu of creamy whip flavors ranging from strawberry to Thin Mint, but soft serve won’t be the only choice to fill your cup or cone. More adventurous customers can opt for edible cookie dough by the scoop or choose to blend the batter into a shake or sundae. 1216 Broadway St., Pendleton, facebook.com/OldMilfordParlor.\n\nThe Birdcage — The Birdcage is an upscale LGBTQ nightclub and lounge located in the space where Shooters — the Country-themed bar on Race Street downtown used to be. The drink menu reflects the bar’s fresh take. Cocktails are named for tropical birds, featuring “fresh juices and unique spirits.” You’ll get more than a simple lemon twist with that, too — drinks are garnished with candied fruit and lollipops made by local candy makers Minges confectionary. 927 Race St., Downtown. thebirdcagecincinnati.com.\n\nThe Bagelry — This former pop-up has a brick-and-mortar storefront serving New York-style bagels in OTR with flavor options ranging from the classics — everything, asiago and plain — to options like chocolate chip, cinnamon raisin and blueberry. They also make their own spreads in house.1401 Walnut St., Over-the-Rhine, otrbagelry.com."
