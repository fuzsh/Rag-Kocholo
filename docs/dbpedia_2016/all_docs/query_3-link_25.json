        "meta_description": "6 reviews and 7 photos of CITYBEAT'S BEST OF CINCINNATI \"I think this is the best party and best kept secret in Cincinnati.  I've gone to this event twice and it's been great both times!  Every year, City Beat does its \"Best of Cincinnati\" and then, this event, features the winners of food and beverage.  For a $30-ish ticket (depends when you buy) you get admission to a large warehouse with vendors set up on the perimeter ready for you to try their goods.  Portions range from a bite to full slices of pizza and rolls of sushi.  O, and your ticket includes alcohol and a swag bag.  Of all of the 'Cincinnati' events in the year, this is the one I look forward to the most.\n\nLogistics at an event like this can be tricky, and I'd say that they're starting to get it just right.  There are enough vendors that you're not waiting in line for forever.  This year, there was also an outdoor portion with live music.  It was great, but a little chilly; the heaters looked nice but weren't very warm.\n\nPace yourself, there's a lot of great food (and drink) to be had!\"",
