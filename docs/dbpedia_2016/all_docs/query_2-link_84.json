        "text": "Finding His Voice in Poetry - A Q&A with Author Michael Maul\n\nBy Felix Winternitz\n\nWhen Michael Maul first set pen to paper nearly six decades ago, he could little imagine becoming an internationally published poet.\n\nNow he's the author of a widely acclaimed book of collected poems, Dancing Naked in Front of Dogs (Amazon Books). In less than a year following its release, he is now unveiling a chapbook, Birds Who Eat French Fries, available November, 2019.\n\nIn an interview, Maul stresses there's an inherent honesty required by his craft. As one reviewer has noted, Maul \"finds inspiration, beauty and resonance in the cloth of everyday American living. Many of his poems share the stories of people living bravely within very challenging situations. These circumstance include Down Syndrome, generational poverty and child abduction, PTSD, autism and the impact of a mass-fatality tragedy on one community.\"\n\nMaul observes that his themes often involve the emotional toll that life can sometimes take, emerging as stories that document \"the journeys through the ups and downs of lives.\" He embraces a powerful voice as he details the moments that make life memorable. He grasps thoughtful, stark language to best jolt the reader out of any complacency.\n\nEven so, as the poet notes, \"My poetry is very accessible stuff.\" Maul says his work doesn't require a whole lot of soul-searching or detective work on the part of the reader.\n\nSitting down with him last summer, Maul reflected on his writing career, and offered a number of engaging observations while covering an array of potentially sensitive topics: including the process of writing poetry, where ideas come from, how Maul’s work has so quickly found such a broad audience, and new projects he has underway.\n\nHere is that interview.\n\nFW Thanks for taking time to sit down with me. I’d like to begin by asking a question I think I already know the answer to. And that is, my assumption that writing poetry is not a pastime you have taken up very recently. Am I correct?\n\nMM Yes. I’ve been writing poetry for the past fifty-five years. I began at seventeen.\n\nFW Is there any particular catalyst that got you started so young?\n\nMM Just happenstance. My parents moved from Ohio to Florida just before my junior year of high school. I left behind all my friends and whoever I thought I was at the time. Writing poems became a solace from loneliness. A coping mechanism or something of the sort. And it taught me a lesson about where poetry can take you.\n\nFW Which was…?\n\nMM Well for me, it took me to a place that gave space, distance and perspective.\n\nFW It sounds as if your writing began almost as therapy. Did you ever try to publish any of those early poems?\n\nMM First, I still find poetry to be healing. And second, I didn’t try to publish the very early stuff. For the first couple of years I just tried to become more familiar with the medium; words and rhythms and forms.\n\nFW So when did you first begin publishing your poems?\n\nMM I think when I was nineteen. I know it was during my freshman year in college. By then I was publishing both poetry and fiction.\n\nFW So that’s when you began hitting your stride?\n\nMM Not really. In those days, for underclassmen most of the courses you took were required, not elective. So I was suffocating in geology and French and math in which I had zero aptitude and interest. I spent my time writing and sculpting instead.\n\nFW That sounds like a risky solution. Did it work?\n\nMM [Laughing] Of course it didn’t work! But I found an English professor who took an interest in me and became a mentor. I confided in him that I was thinking about dropping out of school. He said “You can’t do that; you’re an artist.” It was the first time anyone ever put a name to what I was. It made all the difference in the world. Really.\n\nFW What was his name?\n\nMM Harrison Butterworth. He helped get me into an experimental program at Ohio University that let me bypass many of the most problematic required courses, matched me with a faculty advisor and introduced me to a community of established, successful writers, and students like me. It was a lifeline.\n\nFW Another question, and it’s one that both readers and writers are frequently are interested in. How do you write?\n\nMM Big question. First, on a granular level, the answer is I write on a laptop, send myself text messages from my phone, leave myself voicemails or scribble notes…really in an emergency I’ll grab anything at hand. If you have lines or titles or ideas trying to get into your head, it’s a big responsibility. The right words are everything. When poet Toni Morrison received the Nobel Prize in Literature in Stockholm, she talked about words and their capacity to liberate, embolden, empower and heal. That’s a lot of currency.\n\nSo if you’re a writer and words, insights, ideas come knocking on your door, you better answer. If you wait to respond, there’s no guarantee they’ll be there later.\n\nFW Voicemails?\n\nMM I’m afraid so. In his poem “How to Be a Poet” Wendell Berry wrote “Accept what comes from silence. Make the best you can of it. Of the little words that come like prayers prayed back to the one who prays.”\n\nSo when the bell rings, you have to come out of your corner. Right then. Simple as that. If you don’t, the words will move on to someone else and you’ll have missed your chance. Before I learned this I lost the handle on so many potentially good ideas for poems. You think you’ll remember what triggered the inspiration, but later you often don’t.\n\nAnother answer to your question is that I frequently write in the first-person. It has advantages and drawbacks. I think the first-person voice makes things happen easier for the reader, it funnels content more directly to them rather than through someone else.\n\nIn terms of drawbacks, people think I’m always writing literally about myself. Which is very often not the case.\n\nAlso, and this may or may not be unusual, I’m always working on multiple poems at the same time. So I have several different horses on the track at once, all racing toward a finish line.\n\nFW Do you find some subject matter to be more conducive to good poetry than others?\n\nMM Not now, but I once did. I used to think I had to write about something big. But as it turns out, writing about everyday things often resonates the most. So, I do both. I wrote a poem about my mother’s death, and I wrote a poem about having breakfast alone on the shore. In the end they had equal power.\n\nFW Does an example come to mind of one the least traditional poems you wrote?\n\nMM Well, I can share this with you. My mother wrote poetry and was a huge influence on me wanting to be writer, too. Years after her death, I found a typed copy of a poem she composed called “Deserted Farmhouse”. I liked it.\n\nIt contained stunning imagery but seemed a little dated in terms of style. Though she had passed away long before, I decided to collaborate with her on it by helping the poem become more contemporary, while remaining true to her soul.\n\nIt now bears both of our names and two author headshots. I’m forty years older in my picture than she is in hers. I plan to submit the poem to a few publications in the near future. And if I ever see her in another lifetime, I hope she's not pissed about the edits I made to her work.\n\nFW On the topic of publishing, this year you have had the successful release of your first full-length collection of poetry, Dancing Naked in Front of Dogs. I have to ask, where did that title come from?\n\nMM Thanks for giving me a chance to set the record straight. We’re not having naked dance parties at the Maul house every weekend. Look, I’ve been a dog person my whole life. I’ve seen people put on airs around other humans, but no one feels pressure to impress their dogs.\n\nI took the title of my book from one of the poems in the collection. The poem is about being willing to honestly reveal your humanness. When it was time to name the collection I thought it could also work as a title for the entire book, saying to the reader this is what we look like, and this is who we are.\n\nFW You referred to inspiration earlier. Do you believe in inspiration?\n\nMM Of course I do! I believe in everything when it comes to successful writing. Hard work, deep concentration, yes inspiration, disembodied voices, magic and mysticism, truth, beauty, honesty, and even luck. I remember Hemingway was quoted as saying \"For a long time now I have tried simply to write the best I can. Sometimes I have good luck and write better than I can.”\n\nThat’s inspiration.\n\nOn the other hand, you can’t wait to be inspired to write. Plenty of credible poems have been written without it. Billy Collins, who is one of the most gifted Poet Laureates America has ever produced, says it’s also about mastering the craft. He points out that good poems have two subjects, the starting subject and then the discovered subject. At some point the poem’s content leaves the initial object and pivots beyond it to something greater. I believe that too, and just knowing it can help aspiring poets a lot.\n\nFW Why do you think the audience for poetry is so small in the U.S.?\n\nMM You know, though I’m prepared to see the market for poetry here as small, by contrast the interest in poetry is surprisingly high. In just the past several months my poetry website has received hits from half of the states in America, along with many countries in Europe, plus cities in Australia, India and Azerbaijan, part of the former Soviet Union which mentioned Dancing Naked in Front of Dogs as recommended reading for students at the college level.\n\nNow that being said, a lot of very smart people in the USA feel uncomfortable around poetry. They have had previous bad experiences, where the end of the poem is like the end of a joke whose punchline they didn’t get. Which makes them feel like they are lacking. And regardless of who you are, that is not a good feeling and you don’t want more of it.\n\nSome other countries (I’d offer Ireland and Scotland as examples) allow poetry to play a larger part in their culture where it has more immediate relevance and far fewer barriers than on our side of the Atlantic.\n\nSo I work hard to make my poetry accessible to everyone. I’m writing about places we all know and people we've all seen. When you sit down with it, you won’t need a thesaurus or a minor in Greek mythology to know what’s going on. It’s straightforward, so if I do my job right we all have the same experience and we all end up in about the same place.\n\nFW How do you know when a poem is done? Or for that matter, whether or not what your have written is any good?\n\nMM That is a legit and difficult question. When involved in the writing process, I’m experiencing the poem as it comes to life. Kind of like seeing fireworks burst while you’re also feeling them in your chest. If it moves me like that, then it’s a good bet it will also have impact for those who read it.\n\nAnd poems that last never seem to lose their juice. When I’m giving a live reading and I can see the impact of my words in people's eyes and on their faces, it means the poem is still evoking. The spirits of readers and listeners are still being nudged.\n\nI’m also a big believer in being a member of writing communities. For years I’ve met monthly with a group of writers in Florida. Still do. We call ourselves The Ringling Museum Coffee House Poets. Everybody brings their work and everybody joins in the critiques. They have saved me from single handedly raising many of my poems through their awkward teenage years.\n\nFW We’re almost out of time, but before I let you go I wanted to ask if there are any new projects you are involved in that you’d like to share?\n\nMM Well I’m winding up work a new chapbook that will be available through my michaelmaul.net website this fall. It will consist of about thirty poems or so. My wife, who is a book artist, is handling its design and production. It will be a small print run, handmade.\n\nI've also been enjoying meeting other poets and readers on a new Facebook page we’ve created. Its name is Michael Maul Poetry. Plus, I’ve started posting more on twitter, at @mmaul414. I’m appreciating more than ever that these are great tools for staying in touch with readers and writers from all over the world.\n\nAnd I’ve been doing more live readings, three so far this year. Two in Florida and one in Ohio.\n\nMeanwhile I’m continuing to publish individual poems in literary journals, reviews, anthologies and online. Most are based in the USA, but not all of them.\n\nFW That’s an incredibly full plate! Don’t forget to breathe, and thanks for making time for this interview."
