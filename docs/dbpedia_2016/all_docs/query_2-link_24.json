I wish the pay was more for sure,” Cole says. “But 2023 was the first year where our digital revenue was higher than our physical revenue. And that’s saying something because we sell a shitload of records. We sold 154,000 records last year, LPs, CDs and 45s. And we still generated more revenue digitally.”\n\nTerry Cole of Colemine and Plaid Room Records, located in Historic Loveland, is featured in CityBeat’s January 24 print edition. Here is the story by City Beat’s Katie Griffith their arts and culture reporter.\n\nOn the Record: How Cincinnati’s Ever-Changing Music Landscape is Shaped by Independent Record Labels\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nKatie Griffith\n\nKatie Griffith is CityBeat’s arts and culture reporter.
