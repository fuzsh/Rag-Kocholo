        "text": "PAR-Projects' Headquarters (HQ) can be found at 1662 Hoffner Street and our recent expansion project — Studeō PAR- — is located directly next door at 1646 Hoffner Street. As part of Northside 45223, our campus is located 1 mile off of I-74, between Hamilton Avenue (BP) and Colereain Avenue (SPCA).\n\nAt HQ, assited by PLATTE Architecture + Design, Team B Architecture & Design, along with faculty, students & staff from UC DAAP's Architecture Program, we're creating a space that utilizes our existing, hundred year old, 6,000 sq/ft building and pairs it with contemporary, shipping-container-based architecture.\n\nAt Studeō PAR-, we've reimagined a 15,000 square foot distribution facilty to serve as a place that supports artistic eduaction, while promoting creative practice in both the visual & media arts.\n\n-\n\nThe video below is a remnent of 2018's Cincinnati 5 project, which brought together Cincinnati-based artists for a one-of-a-kind exhibition.

As educators, we provide workshops & multi-week classes, related to career development & skills training.\n\nOur Adage\n\nBeyond face value.\n\n-\n\nOur Story?\n\nTo say the least, it's complicated. From illegal evictions in the private sector, to the loss of a 30 year lease in the public sector, we've found a way to keep the arts at our forefront and continue pushing forward.\n\nFind a number of our milestones by scrolling through the timeline below.\n\n#AccessGranted\n\nFor more information from over the years:\n\nCheck out our blog. >>\n\nTo support our energy with a contribution:\n\nVisit our donate page. >>\n\nIt takes a TEAM.\n\nLeadership.\n\nStructure.\n\nSupport.\n\nParticipation.\n\nConsultation.\n\nWhat others are saying.\n\n\"Thanks again!\" for print media.\n\nOne Creative Community... via Cincinnati Magazine\n\nAbove PAR Art Events via CityBeat\n\nGood Art in Small Galleries via Cincinnati Magazine\n\nOur director's efforts recognized via Movers & Makers\n\nAbout our Executive Director via Creative Exchange\n\nPlans to start an outdoor theater via The Northsider\n\nOur #MakersMobile Shipping Container via CityBeat\n\nThe start of PAR-Gardens via The Washington Post\n\nJoin our distribution list to stay tuned in to our things and stuff.\n\nLearn more about how you can help."
