        "text": "This article is about the city in Ohio. For other uses, see Cincinnati (disambiguation).\n\nCincinnati (pronounced /sɪnsɨˈnæti/) is a city in the state of Ohio. Cincinnati is the county seat of Hamilton County.[3] Settled in 1788, the city is located to north of the Ohio River at the Ohio-Kentucky border, near Indiana. The population within city limits is 296,943 according to the 2010 census,[4] making it Ohio's third-largest city. According to the 2010 Census Bureau estimate, the Cincinnati metropolitan area had a population of 2,130,151, the 27th most populous Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) in the United States.[5] Residents of Cincinnati are called Cincinnatians.[6]\n\nIn the early 19th century, Cincinnati was the first American boomtown in the heart of the country to rival the larger coastal cities in size and wealth. As the first major inland city in the country, it is sometimes thought of as the first purely American city. It developed initially without as much recent European immigration or influence as took place in eastern cities. However, by the end of the 19th century, with the shift from steamboats to railroads, Cincinnati's growth had slowed considerably and the city became surpassed in population by many other inland Midwest cities, especially Chicago.\n\nCincinnati is home to two major sports teams, the Cincinnati Reds and the Cincinnati Bengals, a major tennis tournament, the Cincinnati Masters, and home to large events such as the Flying Pig Marathon, the Ohio Valley Jazz Festival, and the Thanksgiving Day race. The University of Cincinnati traces its foundation to the Medical College of Ohio, which was founded in 1819.[7]\n\nCincinnati is known for its large collection of historic architecture. Over-the-Rhine, a neighborhood just to the north of Downtown Cincinnati, boasts among the world's largest collections of Italianate architecture, rivaling similar neighborhoods in New York City, Vienna and Munich in size and scope. Constructed mainly between 1850-1900, Over-the-Rhine was the center of life for German immigrants for many years, and is one of the largest historic districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nContents\n\n1 History\n\n2 Geography\n\n2.1 Climate\n\n3 Cityscape\n\n4 Government\n\n5 Race relations\n\n6 Crime\n\n7 Demographics\n\n8 Economy\n\n9 Education\n\n10 Culture\n\n10.1 Festivals\n\n11 Media and music\n\n12 Sports\n\n13 Transportation\n\n13.1 Planned streetcar system\n\n14 Sister cities\n\n15 See also\n\n16 References\n\n17 Further reading\n\n18 External links\n\nHistory\n\nMain article: History of Cincinnati\n\nCincinnati was founded in 1788 by John Cleves Symmes and Colonel Robert Patterson.[8] Surveyor John Filson (also the author of The Adventures of Colonel Daniel Boone) named it \"Losantiville\" from four terms, each of a different language, meaning \"the city opposite the mouth of the Licking River\". Ville is French for \"city\", anti is Greek for \"opposite\", os is Latin for \"mouth\", and \"L\" was all that was included of \"Licking River\".[citation needed]\n\nIn 1790, Arthur St. Clair, the governor of the Northwest Territory, changed the name of the settlement to \"Cincinnati\" in honor of the Society of the Cincinnati, of which he was a member.[8] The society honored General George Washington, who was considered a latter day Cincinnatus, the Roman farmer who was called to serve Rome as dictator, an office which he resigned after completing his task of defeating the Aequians. To this day, Cincinnati in particular, and Ohio in general, are homes to a statistically significant number of descendants of Revolutionary War soldiers who were granted lands in the state as payment for their war service.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1802, Cincinnati was chartered as a village. David Ziegler (1748–1811), a Revolutionary War veteran from Heidelberg, Germany, became the first mayor. Cincinnati was incorporated as a city in 1819. The introduction of steam navigation on the Ohio River in 1811 and the completion of the Miami and Erie Canal helped the city grow to 115,000 citizens by 1850.[8]\n\nConstruction on the Miami and Erie Canal began on July 21, 1825, when it was called the Miami Canal, related to its origin at the Great Miami River. The canal became operational in 1827.[9] In 1827, the canal connected Cincinnati to nearby Middletown; by 1840, it had reached Toledo. The name was changed to the Miami and Erie Canal, signifying the connection between the Great Miami River and Lake Erie.[citation needed]\n\nDuring this period of rapid expansion, citizens of Cincinnati began referring to the city as the \"Queen\" city. In his poem \"Catawba Wine\", Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote that the city was \"the Queen of the West\".\n\nCincinnati depended on trade with the slave states south of the Ohio river, at a time when growing numbers of African Americans were settling in the state. This led to tensions between anti-abolitionists and citizens in favor of lifting restrictions on blacks codified in the \"Black Code\" of 1804. There were riots in 1829, where many blacks lost their homes and property, further riots in 1836 in which an abolitionist press was twice destroyed, and more rioting in 1842.[10]\n\nRailroads were the next major form of transportation to come to Cincinnati. In 1836, the Little Miami Railroad was chartered.[11] Construction began soon after, to connect Cincinnati with the Mad River and Lake Erie Railroad, and provide access to the ports of the Sandusky Bay on Lake Erie.[9]\n\nThe first sheriff, John Brown, was appointed September 2, 1788. The Ohio Act in 1802 provided for Cincinnati to have a village marshall and James Smith was appointed; the following year the town started a \"night watch\". In 1819, when Cincinnati was incorporated as a city, the first city marshal, William Ruffin, was appointed. In May 1828, the police force consisted of one captain; one assistant and five patrolmen. By 1850, the city authorized positions for a police chief and six lieutenants, but it was 1853 before the first police chief, Jacob Keifer, was appointed and he was dismissed after 3 weeks.\n\nCincinnati accompanied its growth by paying men to act as its fire department in 1853, making the first full-time paid fire department in the United States. It was the first in the world to use steam fire engines.[12]\n\nSix years later, in 1859, Cincinnati laid out six streetcar lines, making it easier for people to get around the city.[11] By 1872, Cincinnatians could travel on the streetcars within the city and transfer to rail cars for travel to the hill communities. The Cincinnati Inclined Plane Company began transporting people to the top of Mount Auburn that year.[9]\n\nThe Cincinnati Red Stockings, a baseball team whose name and heritage inspired today's Cincinnati Reds, began their career in the 19th century as well. In 1868, meetings were held at the law offices of Tilden, Sherman, and Moulton to make Cincinnati's baseball team a professional one; it became the first regular professional team in the country in 1869. In its first year, the team won 57 games and tied one, giving it the best winning record of any professional baseball team in history.[11]\n\nDuring the American Civil War, Cincinnati played a key role as a major source of supplies and troops for the Union Army. It also served as the headquarters for much of the war for the Department of the Ohio, which was charged with the defense of the region, as well as directing the army's offensive into Kentucky and Tennessee. Due to Cincinnati's commerce with slave states and history of settlement by southerners from eastern states, many people in the area were \"Southern sympathizers\". Some participated in the Copperhead movement in Ohio.[13] In July 1863, the Union Army instituted martial law in Cincinnati due to the imminent danger posed by the Confederate Morgan's Raiders. Bringing the war to the North, they attacked several outlying villages, such as Cheviot and Montgomery.[14][15][16]\n\nIn 1879, Procter & Gamble, one of Cincinnati's major soap manufacturers, began marketing Ivory Soap. It was marketed as \"light enough to float.\" After a fire at the first factory, Procter & Gamble moved to a new factory on the Mill Creek and renewed soap production. The area became known as Ivorydale.[17]\n\nIn 1884, one of the most severe riots in American history took place in Cincinnati. On Christmas Eve 1883 Joe Palmer and William Berner robbed and murdered their employer, a stable owner named William Kirk. The duo dumped his body near Mill Creek before they were captured. One of the men, William Berner, was spared the gallows in sentencing after his conviction, but the case had provoked outrage and an angry mob formed. The Courthouse Riots began on March 28 when thousands of citizens stormed the county jail and set the Hamilton County Courthouse on fire while seeking Berner. A small group of Hamilton County deputies, led by Sheriff Morton Lytle Hawkins, fought to save the jail from a complete takeover. After losing ground, they succeeded in protecting the inmates from the mob. Two deputies were killed in the conflict, including Captain John Desmond, whose statue stands in the Courthouse lobby. In total, 45 men were killed and 125 injured in the rioting.[18]\n\nCincinnati weathered the Great Depression better than most American cities of its size, largely because of a resurgence in river trade, which was less expensive than rail. The rejuvenation of downtown began in the 1920s and continued into the next decade with the construction of Union Terminal, the post office, and a large Bell Telephone building.[citation needed]\n\nThe flood of 1937 was one of the worst in the nation's history. Afterward the city built protective flood walls. After World War II, Cincinnati unveiled a master plan for urban renewal that resulted in modernization of the inner city. Like other older industrial cities, Cincinnati suffered from economic restructuring and loss of jobs following deindustrialization in the mid-century.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1970 and 1975, the city completed Riverfront Stadium and Riverfront Coliseum, respectively, as the Cincinnati Reds baseball team emerged as one of the dominant teams of the decade. In fact, the Big Red Machine of 1975 and 1976 is considered by many to be one of the best baseball teams to ever play the game. Three key players on the team (Johnny Bench, Tony Perez, and Joe Morgan), as well as manager Sparky Anderson, were elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame, while a fourth, Pete Rose, still holds the title for the most hits (4,256), singles (3,215), games played (3,562), games played in which his team won (1,971), at-bats (14,053) and outs (10,328) in baseball history. On May 28, 1977 165 persons were killed in a fire at the Beverly Hills Supper Club in nearby Southgate, Kentucky. On December 3, 1979 11 persons were killed in a crowd crush at the entrance of Riverfront Coliseum for a rock concert by the British band The Who.\n\nIn 1988, the 200th anniversary of the city's founding, much attention was focused on the city's Year 2000 plan, which involved further revitalization.[citation needed] The completion of several major new development projects enhance the city as it enters the early years of the new millennium. Cincinnati's beloved Bengals and Reds teams both have new, state-of-the-art homes: Paul Brown Stadium, opened in 2000; and the Great American Ball Park, opened in 2003, respectively. Two new museums have opened: the Rosenthal Center for Contemporary Art in 2003, and the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center in 2004.\n\nThe City of Cincinnati and Hamilton County are currently planning the Banks - development of a 24-hour urban neighborhood along the city's riverfront, to include restaurants, clubs, offices, and homes with sweeping skyline views. Cincinnati has received accolades for its quality of life:\n\n1993 - \"Most Livable City\"\n\n2004 - Partners for Livable Communities\n\n2004 - Ranked #5 as a U.S. arts destination, American Style Magazine\n\n2004 - Top Ten \"Cities that Rock\", Esquire magazine, April 2004\n\n2007 - Ranked #1 city in Ohio for \"Best Cities For Young Professionals\" and #18 overall, Forbes magazine[19]\n\n2008 - Ranked #10 as the most walkable city in the United States and #1 in Ohio.[20]\n\n2011 - Ranked #5 in \"America's Most Affordable Cities\" Forbes magazine[21]\n\n2011 - Ranked #1 \"residential remodeling market\" in the United States by Remodeling Magazine[22]\n\n2011 - Ranked #7 as the \"Most Romantic City\" in the United States by Amazon.com[23]\n\nGeography\n\nCincinnati's core metro area spans parts of southern Ohio and northern Kentucky. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 79.6 square miles (210 km2), of which, 78.0 square miles (200 km2) of it is land and 1.6 square miles (4.1 km2) of it (2.01%) is water. The city spreads over a number of hills, bluffs, and low ridges overlooking the Ohio River in the Bluegrass region of the country.[24] Cincinnati is geographically located within the Midwest and is on the far northern periphery of the Upland South. Two-thirds of the American population live within a one-day drive of the city.[25][26][27]\n\nClimate\n\nCincinnati belongs to a climatic transition zone, at the northern limit of the humid subtropical climate and the southern limit of the humid continental climate zone (Koppen: Cfa/Dfa, respectively).[28] Summers are hot and humid, with significant rainfall in each month. July is the warmest month, with highs just above 86 °F (30 °C), reaching 90 °F (32 °C) or above on 18 days per year, often with high dew points and humidity.[29] Winters tend to be cold and snowy, with January, the coolest month, averaging at 29.7 °F (−1.3 °C); however, lows may reach 0 °F (−18 °C) several times a year.[29] An average season will see just above 20 inches (51 cm) of snowfall, contributing to the annual 42.6 inches (1,080 mm) of precipitation, which is somewhat evenly distributed. Extremes range from −25 to 109 °F (-32 to 43 °C) on January 18, 1977 and July 21, 1934, respectively.[30]\n\nClimate data for Cincinnati (Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport) Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °F (°C) 77\n\n(25) 76\n\n(24) 88\n\n(31) 90\n\n(32) 95\n\n(35) 102\n\n(39) 109\n\n(43) 103\n\n(39) 102\n\n(39) 91\n\n(33) 81\n\n(27) 75\n\n(24) 109\n\n(43) Average high °F (°C) 38.0\n\n(3.3) 43.1\n\n(6.2) 53.9\n\n(12.2) 64.7\n\n(18.2) 74.4\n\n(23.6) 82.4\n\n(28.0) 86.4\n\n(30.2) 84.8\n\n(29.3) 78.0\n\n(25.6) 66.4\n\n(19.1) 53.6\n\n(12.0) 42.7\n\n(5.9) 64.0 Average low °F (°C) 21.3\n\n(−5.9) 25.0\n\n(−3.9) 33.8\n\n(1.0) 42.7\n\n(5.9) 52.9\n\n(11.6) 61.6\n\n(16.4) 66.1\n\n(18.9) 64.2\n\n(17.9) 56.8\n\n(13.8) 44.9\n\n(7.2) 35.7\n\n(2.1) 26.4\n\n(−3.1) 44.3 Record low °F (°C) −25\n\n(−31.7) −17\n\n(−27.2) −11\n\n(−23.9) 15\n\n(−9.4) 27\n\n(−2.8) 39\n\n(4) 47\n\n(8) 43\n\n(6) 31\n\n(−0.6) 16\n\n(−8.9) 0\n\n(−17.8) −20\n\n(−28.9) −25\n\n(−31.7) Precipitation inches (mm) 2.92\n\n(74.2) 2.75\n\n(69.9) 3.90\n\n(99.1) 3.96\n\n(100.6) 4.59\n\n(116.6) 4.42\n\n(112.3) 3.75\n\n(95.3) 3.79\n\n(96.3) 2.82\n\n(71.6) 2.96\n\n(75.2) 3.46\n\n(87.9) 3.28\n\n(83.3) 42.60\n\n(1,082) Snowfall inches (cm) 7.8\n\n(19.8) 6.9\n\n(17.5) 3.8\n\n(9.7) .6\n\n(1.5) 0\n\n(0) 0\n\n(0) 0\n\n(0) 0\n\n(0) 0\n\n(0) .4\n\n(1) 1.3\n\n(3.3) 3.6\n\n(9.1) 23.5\n\n(59.7) Avg. precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) 12.6 11.7 12.9 12.5 11.8 11.5 10.2 9.7 8.4 8.5 10.9 12.2 132.9 Avg. snowy days (≥ 0.1 in) 7.2 5.4 2.8 .7 0 0 0 0 0 .1 1.4 4.3 21.9 Sunshine hours 120.9 130.0 170.5 210.0 251.1 276.0 275.9 260.4 234.0 189.1 120.0 99.2 2,337.1 Source: National Weather Service (records)[30]\n\nNOAA[29]\n\nHKO (sun only)[31]\n\nCityscape\n\nMain article: Cityscape of Cincinnati\n\nDowntown Cincinnati is focused around Fountain Square, a popular public square and event location.[citation needed]\n\nCincinnati is home to numerous structures that are noteworthy due to their architectural characteristics or historic associations including the Carew Tower, the Scripps Center, the Ingalls Building, Cincinnati Museum Center at Union Terminal, and the Isaac M. Wise Temple.[citation needed]\n\nThe city is undergoing significant changes due to new development and private investment, as well as the construction of the long-stalled Banks project. Nearly $3.5 billion has been invested in the urban core of Cincinnati (including Northern Kentucky). More investment is expected to take place.[citation needed]\n\nConstruction recently was finished on a new office building that will dominate the Cincinnati skyline. Queen City Square opened on January 11, 2011, at 1:11 p.m. EST. The building is the tallest in Cincinnati (surpassing the Carew Tower), and is the third tallest in Ohio, reaching a height of 660 feet.[32]\n\nGovernment\n\nThe city is governed by a nine-member city council, whose members are elected at large. Prior to 1924, city council was elected through a system of wards. The ward system was subject to corruption and as with any one-party dominance, abuses arose. From the 1880s-1920s, the Republican Party dominated city politics, with the political machine of \"Boss\" Cox exerting control.\n\nA reform movement arose in 1923, led by another Republican, Murray Seasongood. Seasongood founded the Charter Committee, which used ballot initiatives in 1924 to replace the ward system with the current at-large system. They also gained approval by voters for a city manager form of government. From 1924 to 1957, the council was selected by proportional representation. Beginning in 1957, all candidates ran in a single race and the top nine vote-getters were elected (the \"9-X system\"). The mayor was selected by the council. In 1977, thirty-three year old Jerry Springer, later a notable television talk show host, was chosen to serve one year as mayor.[33]\n\nResidents continued to work to improve their system. To have their votes count more, starting in 1987, the top vote-getter in the city council election was automatically selected as mayor. Starting in 1999, the mayor was elected separately in a general election for the first time. The city manager's role in government was reduced. These reforms were referred to as the \"strong mayor\" reforms, to make the city government accountable to voters. Cincinnati politics include the participation of the Charter Party, the party with the third-longest history of winning in local elections.\n\nThe current mayor of Cincinnati is Mark Mallory and the current City Manager is Milton Dohoney. The nine-member city council is composed of Vice-Mayor Roxanne Qualls and Councilmembers Cecil Thomas (President Pro-Tem), Jeff Berding, Chris Bortz, Leslie Ghiz, Chris Monzel, Laure Quinlivan, Wendell Young, and Charlie Winburn.[34]\n\nRace relations\n\nMain article: Race relations of Cincinnati\n\nBecause of its location on the Ohio River, Cincinnati was a border town between a state that allowed slavery, Kentucky, and one that did not, Ohio, before the Civil War. Some residents of Cincinnati played a major role in abolitionism. Many escaping slaves used the Ohio river and Cincinnati to escape to the North. Cincinnati had numerous stations on the Underground Railroad, as well as slave catchers.\n\nIn 1829, a riot broke out as anti-abolitionists attacked blacks in the city. As a result, 1,200 blacks left the city and resettled in Canada.[35] The riot and its refugees were a topic of discussion throughout the nation, and at the first Negro Convention held in 1830 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Riots also occurred in 1836 and 1841.[35] In 1836, a mob of 700 anti-abolitionists again attacked black neighborhoods, as well as a press run by James M. Birney, publisher of the anti-slavery weekly The Philanthropist.[36] Tensions further increased after passage in 1850 of the Fugitive Slave Act.\n\nHarriet Beecher Stowe lived in Cincinnati for a time, met escaped slaves, and used their stories as a basis for her watershed novel Uncle Tom's Cabin. Levi Coffin made the Cincinnati area the center of his anti-slavery efforts in 1847.[37] Today, the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center, located on the Cincinnati riverfront in the middle of \"The Banks\" area between Great American Ballpark and Paul Brown Stadium, commemorates this era.\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, Cincinnati, along with other rust belt cities, underwent a vast demographic transformation. Predominately white, working-class families that had filled the urban core during the European immigration boom in the 19th century moved to the suburbs. Blacks, fleeing the oppression of the Jim Crow South in hopes of better socioeconomic opportunity, filled these older city neighborhoods. Racial tensions boiled over in 1968 with the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. when riots occurred in Cincinnati along with nearly every major U.S. city. By 2001, decades of inner-city neglect, the crack cocaine epidemic of the 80s and 90s, and backlash against several violent incidents involving the primarily white Cincinnati police force and black residents reached another boiling point. In April 2001, racially charged riots occurred after police shot and killed a black man, Timothy Thomas during a foot pursuit.[38]\n\nCrime\n\nMain article: Crime in Cincinnati\n\nBefore the riot of 2001, Cincinnati's overall crime rate was dropping steadily and had reached its lowest point since 1992.[39] After the riot violent crime increased, and in 2005 Cincinnati was ranked as the 20th most dangerous city in America.[40] The police force \"work slowdown\" correlated with this increase. For the first four months of 2007, incidents of violent crime were 15.3 percent lower than they had been in the first four months of 2006. Children's Hospital saw a 78 percent decrease in gunshot wounds, and University Hospital had a 17 percent drop.[41] In May and June 2006, together with the Hamilton County Sheriff, the Cincinnati Police Department created a task force of twenty deputies in Over-the-Rhine that helped reduce crime in downtown Cincinnati by 29%[citation needed]. This substantial decrease had still not reduced crime to levels before the 2001 riots.\n\nThe city attempted to reduce gun violence by using the Out of the Crossfire program at University Hospital, a rehabilitation program for patients with gunshot wounds.[42] Mayor Mark Mallory is a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition,[43] a bi-partisan group with a stated goal of \"making the public safer by getting illegal guns off the streets.\" 2007 saw 68 homicides, nearly a 25% drop from 2006; however, this was still higher than homicide figures in the year 2000.[44] By May 2008, violent crime was down by 12% compared to the same period in 2007; however, by year end, homicides increased 10% from the 2007.[45] As of December 12, 2009 there had been 60 homicides in the city of Cincinnati.[46] In 2009, the CQ Press ranked Cincinnati the 19th most dangerous city in the United States.[47]\n\nIn 2010, there were 72 reported homicides and 41 of them have been solved as of February 2011.[48]\n\nDemographics\n\nHistorical populations Census Pop. %± 1800 750 — 1810 2,540 238.7% 1820 9,642 279.6% 1830 24,831 157.5% 1840 46,338 86.6% 1850 115,435 149.1% 1860 161,044 39.5% 1870 216,239 34.3% 1880 255,139 18.0% 1890 296,908 16.4% 1900 325,902 9.8% 1910 363,591 11.6% 1920 401,247 10.4% 1930 451,160 12.4% 1940 455,610 1.0% 1950 503,998 10.6% 1960 502,550 −0.3% 1970 452,524 −10.0% 1980 385,457 −14.8% 1990 364,040 −5.6% 2000 331,285 −9.0% 2010 296,943 −10.4% Population 1810-1970.[49]\n\nPopulation 1980-2000.[50][51]\n\nPopulation 2010.

The team is a member of the ECHL. Founded in 1990, the team first played their games in the Cincinnati Gardens and now play at U.S. Bank Arena. They are the reigning ECHL Kelly Cup Champions, having won the 2010 Kelly Cup Finals in five games over the Idaho Steelheads, and currently enjoy their 2nd championship reign in three seasons. It is also home to three professional soccer teams, two outdoor teams, the Cincinnati Kings (men's) and Cincinnati LadyHawks (women's), and one indoor team, the Cincinnati Excite (men's). On Opening Day, Cincinnati has the distinction of holding the \"traditional opener\" in baseball each year, due to its baseball history. Many children in Cincinnati skip school on Opening Day, which is commonly thought of as a city holiday.[83]\n\nFans often refer to the city and its teams as \"Cincy\" for short. Even the Reds' official website uses that name frequently.[84]\n\nClub Sport Founded League Venue Cincinnati Reds Baseball 1867 MLB, National League Great American Ball Park Cincinnati Bengals Football 1968 National Football League Paul Brown Stadium Cincinnati Cyclones Ice hockey 1990 East Coast Hockey League U.S. Bank Arena Cincinnati Kings Soccer 2005 USL Premier Development League Town and Country Sports Club Cincinnati Kings Indoor Team Indoor Soccer 2008 Professional Arena Soccer League Cincinnati Gardens Cincinnati Commandos Indoor Football 2010 Ultimate Indoor Football League Cincinnati Gardens\n\nTransportation\n\nCincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (CVG) is the major international airport serving the metropolitan area and is located across the river in Hebron, Kentucky. The airport is the fifth largest hub for Delta Air Lines and the largest for its subsidiary, Comair. The city has four other airports; Lunken Airport, a municipal airfield used for smaller business jets and private planes; the Butler County Regional Airport, located between Fairfield and Hamilton, which ranks just behind Lunken in business jets and has the largest private aircraft capacity of the Cincinnati area; Cincinnati West Airport, a smaller airport located in Harrison, Ohio; and the Blue Ash Airport, in Blue Ash.[85]\n\nCVG Airport, along with the two other regional international airports, Dayton International Airport 78 miles (130 km) north, and Port Columbus International Airport 128 miles (210 km) northeast, form an important regional transportation network. Combined, they anchor the corners of a triangular region that serves about 50% of the population of Ohio and about 10% of Kentucky. The region encompasses over 6,000 square miles (16,000 km2) with about 50% available for development.\n\nCincinnati is served by the Metro transit system, operated by the Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority (SORTA). The Transit Authority of Northern Kentucky (TANK) serves Northern Kentucky and connects downtown at Metro's Government Square hub.\n\nThere is inter-city rail service by Amtrak with ticket offices and boarding stations at Cincinnati Union Terminal. Amtrak's Cardinal train travels to Chicago to the northwest and to Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and New York City to the east. Several freight railroads service Cincinnati, the largest being CSX Transportation which operates a railroad yard west of Interstate 75. Other railroads include Norfolk Southern, which operates a large intermodal yard in the west end neighborhood of Queensgate and the Indiana & Ohio Railroad which operates several small predecessor yards throughout the city.\n\nThe city has a river ferry and many bridges. The Anderson Ferry has been in continuous operation since 1817.[86] Cincinnati's major bridges include:\n\nThe Newport Southbank Bridge (a.k.a. the Purple People Bridge because of its status as a pedestrian-only bridge as well as its color)\n\nThe John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge Opened in 1866, this bridge was the prototype for the Brooklyn Bridge, also designed by Roebling.\n\nThe Daniel Carter Beard Bridge (a.k.a. the Big Mac bridge for its yellow arches, reminiscent of the McDonald's logo) carries I-471 and connects Cincinnati with Newport, Kentucky\n\nThe Brent Spence Bridge A double-decker truss bridge carrying I-71/75 connecting Cincinnati with Covington, Kentucky\n\nThe Clay Wade Bailey Bridge\n\nThe Taylor-Southgate Bridge\n\nThe Combs-Hehl Bridge a twin-span truss, part of the I-275 loop and commonly called \"The 275 Bridge,\" it travels through Fort Thomas, Kentucky and connects to the neighborhood of California, the easternmost neighborhood in the city limits.\n\nCincinnati is served by three major interstate highways. Interstate 75 is a north-south route through the Mill Creek valley. Interstate 71 runs northeast towards Mount Adams and Walnut Hills. Interstate 74 begins at Interstate 75 west of downtown and connects to Indiana.\n\nThe city has an outer-belt, Interstate 275 (which is the longest circle highway in the country), and a spur to Kentucky, Interstate 471. It is also served by numerous U.S. highways: US 22, US 25, US 27, US 42, US 50, US 52, and US 127.\n\nCincinnati has an incomplete subway system. Construction stopped in 1924 when unexpected post-World War I inflation had doubled the cost of construction.[87] As a result, the funds that were originally set aside were not enough to complete the subway system. There have been several attempts by SORTA to utilize the subways for a modern light rail system within Hamilton County. All of these initiatives have thus far failed when placed on the ballot, with the most recent (a $2.7 billion plan) failing 2 to 1 in 2002.[88] Today the subway is used as a conduit for fiber optic and water lines.\n\nThere have been numerous attempts over the past decade[89] to build commuter rail from Milford (in nearby Clermont County) to the Downtown Transit Center in Cincinnati. The most recent of these began gaining support in early July 2007. The $411 million plan currently calls for using and upgrading existing rail lines and new diesel cars called DMUs (diesel multiple units).[90]\n\nAccording to Forbes Magazine, Cincinnatians spend 20% of their income on transit, which makes the city the sixth most expensive city for commuting in the United States.[91] As of 2003 , the port of Cincinnati is ranked 5th by trip ton-miles for an inland port.[92]\n\nPlanned streetcar system\n\nMain article: Cincinnati streetcars\n\nCincinnati is also currently planning a streetcar line to connect Downtown, Over-the-Rhine and the area around the University of Cincinnati.[93] An initial study conducted by Omaha-based HDR Engineers was completed on May 31, 2007 and estimated the cost to be around $100 million. Additions made later, of a connection from Over-the-Rhine to Uptown and a loop through Uptown, have raised the overall estimated cost to $185 million. It is predicted that the system could generate more than $1.4 billion in new private investment over the next 15 years through property redevelopment and attracting new residents.[94] However, the plans have faced opposition from some groups arguing that there are more urgent needs on which to spend public funds.[95] Opening of the first streetcar line would not take place before 2013.[96]\n\nSister cities\n\nCincinnati has eight sister cities:,[97] however one is currently suspended from being a sister city.\n\n- Munich, Germany\n\n- South Kanpur, India\n\n- Tijuana, Mexico\n\n- Liuzhou, Guangxi, People's Republic of China\n\n- Gifu, Japan\n\n- Nancy, France\n\n- New Taipei, Taiwan\n\n- Kharkov, Ukraine\n\nA sister city relationship with Harare, Zimbabwe was suspended in protest of irregularities in the 2008 Zimbabwean presidential election.[98]\n\nSee also\n\nCincinnati Communities\n\nCincinnati Airport\n\nCincinnati nicknames\n\nCincinnati Public Schools\n\nCincinnati streetcars\n\nCity Plan for Cincinnati\n\nGreater Cincinnati\n\nList of Cincinnati neighborhoods\n\nList of mayors of Cincinnati\n\nList of people from Cincinnati\n\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Cincinnati, Ohio\n\nNorthern Kentucky University\n\nThe Athenaeum of Ohio\n\nRoman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati\n\nVine Street, Cincinnati\n\nXavier University\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nStradling, David (2003).
