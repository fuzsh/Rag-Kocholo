        "text": "The Schoolhouse was converted into a restaurant in 1962 by our parents Dr. Donald & Phyllis Miller. They wanted to open a restaurant where families could come together for a meal that was reminiscent of memories of their own childhoods when the family gathered at dinner time, eating around the dinner table family style. It was a time everyday when the busy family could catch up on the day’s events then the kids could go outside to play tether ball or whatever kids do, while the grown ups talked. What a great memory!\n\nOur menu relies on simple, all-American foods that remind us of home. Traditional entrees of fried chicken, roast beef, country fried steak, meatloaf, ham, BBQ ribs, baked cod, and salmon to name a few of our delicious offerings. Our meals are accompanied by balanced meal choices of freshly made salads, creamy cole slaw, fluffy mashed potatoes & gravy, country style fresh green beans, carrots or corn with fresh sweet corn bread. All this is served in the original 1862 civil war era classroom, the menu is featured on the original blackboard, served family style on a big lazy Susan for the table to share.\n\nWe are in the business of making memories. Offering good simple food and drinks, lively conversations with family & friends, a place to celebrate special life moments and staff members who welcome your visit and make you feel at home. Thank you for visiting our website and we hope to see you soon!"
