        "text": "For many years I enthusiastically attended the Humana Festival of New American Plays at Actors Theatre of Louisville. The last festival was in 2019; between the worldwide pandemic, changing priorities for corporate sponsorship and new artistic leadership, Actors Theatre has chosen not to resurrect the annual celebration that brought directors, producers, actors and critics together every year for more than four decades since 1979.\n\nThe Contemporary American Theater Festival, hosted on the campus of Shepherd University in Shepherdstown, West Virginia, actually began presenting freshly minted plays in 1991. Today it continues to be in the spotlight annually with professional productions of new works during the month of July. Some are commissioned by CATF; others have debuted elsewhere in recent years and need to be seen again. According to National Public Radio’s Morning Edition, the festival is a home for “brand new plays in West Virginia’s oldest town.” It’s a charming, historic and scenic destination. This summer, from July 5 to 28, four thought-provoking plays have been presented in three different venues on the campus of Shepherd University and one in the Shepherdstown’s charming Opera House. I had the opportunity to see these fresh new works from July 18 to 20.\n\nI can’t say anyone told me the overarching theme for 2024 has been family. But I have to imagine that as CATF’s artistic director, Peggy McKowen, assembled season together, she had in mind the importance of family. Over the next few days I’ll be posting comments about each production — one about a young, binary filmmaker and his parents, another showing us a pair of lovers who seek to understand one another’s pasts, a third a memoir about a Holocaust survivor and his indomitable spirit, and one that explores the community of Black people living with HIV/AIDS.\n\nI’ll soon be posting comments about each of these shows on my Facebook page, Rick Pender’s Theater Stages & Scenes. I hope you’ll read about them, and maybe even plan your own trip to West Virginia next year! More information at https://catf.org/\n\nHey, wait a minute,” I keep hearing people say. “You wrote a book about the Cincinnati\n\nBengals? Aren’t you an arts journalist? You wrote an encyclopedia about musical theater\n\ncomposer Stephen Sondheim, right? Don’t you give history and culture tours around Cincinnati\n\nand Northern Kentucky? So where did a football book come from?”\n\nIt’s time for some clarification. I grew up in Northern Ohio, near Cleveland. The Browns were\n\nmy boyhood NFL team. I rooted for Jim Brown, Ernie Green, Frank Ryan and Paul Warfield when\n\nhe was a rookie. Even after moving to Cincinnati in 1980, I continued to pull for my old team. I\n\nwas devastated 1996 when arrogant owner Art Modell, who fired Paul Brown from “his” team,\n\nloaded up his franchise and trucked it off to Baltimore.\n\nBy that time, I’d been in Cincinnati for 16 years. I still rooted for the Browns. But I’d spent a lot\n\nof time with the Bengals in my backyard. (I could have attended the Freezer Bowl in 1982, but I\n\ngave my ticket away). I was at the new Paul Brown stadium for the first regular season game in\n\n1999, a game the reborn Browns won. But I suffered through umpteen seasons in the as the\n\nreinstated franchise struggled for success with a revolving door of coaches and quarterbacks. It\n\nwas more than one “lost decade,” twice as sad as the Bengals’.\n\nEven today the Browns tug at my heartstrings. But every year it’s harder. I’d love to see a\n\nwinning team back where my love of professional football started. Just before I moved to\n\nCincinnati I lived in Canton, Ohio, a few blocks from the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The NFL was\n\nsomething I cared about, despite all its rough edges.\n\nNevertheless, I fell in love with the city of Cincinnati as I wrote about the Queen City’s arts and\n\nculture. Then something astonishing happened in 2021: Young quarterback Joe Burrow led the\n\nBengals through a magical season, a string of surprising playoff victories, all the way to Super\n\nBowl LVI. Regardless of past loyalties, it was impossible to live here in early 2022 and not be\n\ninfected with Bengals fever.\n\nDuring the playoffs Josh Stevens, the publisher at Reedy Press in St. Louis who recruited me to\n\nwrite several 100 Things to Do in Cincinnati Before You Die and Oldest Cincinnati, asked if I knew\n\nsomeone who might write a history of the Bengals franchise. I sought a few sportswriters, but\n\nthey were preoccupied with the moment. Josh came back with a proposal: How about co-\n\nauthoring with Jeff Suess, another writer with ties to Reedy Press who also happened to be the\n\nhistorian/archivist at the Cincinnati Enquirer? Jeff had graciously helped me find photos for\n\nOldest Cincinnati, and I knew we could work collaboratively.\n\nWe had to hustle to meet a tight deadline. But through the spring and summer of 2022 we put\n\ntogether and found lots of great photos for an attractive coffee-table book, The Cincinnati\n\nBengals: An Illustrated Timeline. I wrote about the legendary coach and owner Paul Brown and\n\nthe longtime rivalry with his onetime Cleveland team. Jeff and I covered everything from games at UC’s Nippert Stadium in the late 1960s right up to the Super Bowl against the Rams earlier\n\nthis year. Our book arrived in September, just in time for the new NFL season.\n\nSo here’s my confession: I still hope the Browns find success. But I’m really glad to live in a city\n\nwhere NFL football has a bright future. Now I can holler “Who-Dey” just as loud as everyone\n\nelse.\n\nI’ll still be cranking out stories about other things you can learn out via my website,\n\nwww.RickPenderWrites.com. By joining my Facebook group,\n\nwww.facebook.com/groups/rickpenderwrites, you can catch all of my writing — local theater\n\nfor CityBeat (look for monthly round-ups of shows worth seeing), play reviews for Talkin’\n\nBroadway (www.talkinbroadway.com/page/regional/cincy/index.html), noteworthy people for\n\nCincinnati Magazine, and even sports every once in a while.\n\nNow I must get back to writing …"
