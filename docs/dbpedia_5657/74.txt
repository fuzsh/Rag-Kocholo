Apparently William A. Wellman thought that something cinematic should be done to honor John J. Montgomery, who is credited with having made the first successful flight in a glider in this country back in 1883. So Mr. Wellman got himself together, helped to write, directed and produced a film called "Gallant Journey," intended to acclaim that daring man. But a look at the finished product, which came to Loew's Criterion yesterday, leads one to suspect that Mr. Wellman was quite as cuckoo as Montgomery was thought to be. For this curiously ill-constructed picture about a man who was crazy to fly goes bumping around in clumsy circles and ends up in a miserable heap.Except for a few pretty glimpses of gliders sailing across fields and a rather sensational sequence showing a cut-away flight from a free balloon, there is little more in the picture than a succession of shots of Glenn Ford sucking a pipe and looking rumpled and spiritual or not sucking a pipe and making love to Janet Blair. These shots, plus a few painful cut-ups from Charles Kemper as a bouncing Catholic priest, are supposed to combine into a pattern of struggle and tragedy. But they're all so devoid of any essence and the acting is so hopelessly poor that the consequence is a weary jumble of pictures of a man and a girl, of a priest who makes gags that have no humor, of flying machines and of clouds.There is certainly drama and beauty in the struggle of man to fly, but Mr. Wellman has not defined it. His "Gallant Journey" is a limp and aimless tour.
