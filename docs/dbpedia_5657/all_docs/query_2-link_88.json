        "text": "Irene Mayer Selznick, daughter of studio mogul Louis B. Mayer and wife of independent Hollywood producer David O. Selznick, once described film director William Wellman (1896-1975) as a ‘shoot-up-the-town fellow, trying to be a great big masculine I-don’t-know-what.” True, he could be tough-talking and uncompromising. Still, she adored his vision and persuaded her husband to produce “A Star Is Born” (1937), which turned out to be one of Wellman’s as well as one of Selznick’s cinematic landmarks, earning Wellman a screenwriting Oscar. Or, as American movie critic Manny Farber (1917-2008) once put it, Wellman was one of ‘the true masters of the male action film,’ and stated that ‘in any Bill Wellman operation, there at least for four directors—a sentimentalist, deep thinker, hooey vaudevillian and an expedient short-cut artist.’\n\nA decade earlier already, Mr. Wellman had directed “Wings” (1927), the all-time screen classic and first Academy Award winner as Best Picture, launching his career as a leading film director which almost spanned four decades and which included countless memorable films in various genres, such as “The Public Enemy” (1931), “A Star Is Born” (1937), “Beau Geste” (1939), “The Story of G.I. Joe” (1945), “Battleground” (1949), “The High and the Mighty” (1954), and his own favorite “Good-bye, My Lady” (1956). Two years later, though, when Warner Bros. insisted on having a happy ending on his highly personal project “Lafayette Escadrille,” about Americans flying for France during World War I, he decided to retire from the movie business at age 62.\n\nThe former World War I fighter pilot and decorated war hero—a recipient of the Croix de Guerre with two Gold Palm Leaves and five United States citations—was so disappointed about what happened to “Lafayette Escadrille” which he was so passionate about, that he reportedly once said to studio head Jack L. Warner, ‘I know this is your studio, but if I ever catch you in a men’s room or alone somewhere, I’m gonna put you in the hospital for six weeks.” That was Wellman too.\n\n“Wings,” made by Paramount, was set in World War I and starred Clara Bow, Charles ‘Buddy’ Rogers, and Richard Arlen, focusing on two fighter pilots during the War who were in love with the same woman. It launched Mr. Wellman’s career and became his landmark film, but didn’t limit his potential in any way in the years to come: he worked for practically every major studio, with each new contract he found more freedom—and even in the 1930s—he was able to free-lance and bring in his own projects as his stature grew.\n\nAlong the way, Mr. Wellman was instrumental in casting young, fresh and new talent over the years, such as Gary Cooper, Jean Harlow, James Cagney, Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Clark Gable, John Wayne, James Stewart, Donald O’Connor, Evelyn Keyes, Joan Leslie, Susan Hayward, Sidney Poitier, Clint Eastwood and Barbara Stanwyck (from 1931 until 1943, they made five films together).\n\nYet, how could it be possible that this four-time Academy Award nominee and recipient of the DGA’s 1973 Lifetime Achievement Award had been overlooked by critics and film historians for so many years after he passed away in 1975? Let’s ask his son William Wellman, Jr. (b. 1937), the guardian of his father’s tremendous film legacy, who made the documentary “Wild Bill: Hollywood Maverick” (1995), and then authored two highly acclaimed books “The Man and His Wings: William A. Wellman and the Making of the First Best Picture” (2006) and “Wild Bill Wellman: Hollywood Rebel” (2015)—many years after Mr. Wellman himself published his own autobiography “A Short Time for Insanity” (1974).\n\nDuring this 2007 interview with him in a West Hollywood restaurant, Mr. Wellman was in the early stages of writing “Wild Bill Wellman: Hollywood Rebel.” For those who want to keep updated about his personal appearances, book signings, etc., you can check his website here.\n\nMr. Wellman, what could be the reason why your father been so overlooked for such a long time?\n\nWell, after my father retired from directing in 1959, he had never had a film retrospective in his lifetime until I produced one for him in 1973, two years before he died. We showed around forty-five of his films in a commercial theatre, which hadn’t been done before. In those days, people only did film retrospectives in a museum. His autobiography was published at the same time, I also got him on television talk shows, and at Chasen’s, his favorite restaurant, there was a huge gathering. James Cagney came out, Bette Davis was there, Ida Lupino, Charles ‘Buddy’ Rogers,… We had a big party there. A short time later, I went over with him to London; the National Film Theatre did a retrospective of his work. But that’s really the point: he retired in the late 1950s, and he never had a film retrospective and there were no honors being given out. So then I decided to start and show films of his at film festivals and it took me twenty-five years to get a documentary made about his life which was completed in 1995 [“Wild Bill: Hollywood Maverick”]. Since then, I have shown films like “Wings” in several countries, and other films at film festivals in Europe too.\n\nYou had previously written a book about “Wings,” and you’re now working on a complete biography as well. So we’ll be getting the full picture pretty soon?\n\nThe thing that I appreciate about the first book the most are my father’s letters. I love those. His mother saved all kinds of things throughout her lifetime—letters, newspaper articles, and memorabilia of all kinds—and now I can use that for my new book as well. I had eighty-two of his letters, and I used about a dozen of them in the first book. So there are not as many details in my first book as maybe there should have been, but there are a lot more of those in my second book, which is also much more in-depth. I didn’t know that much about my father’s life when he was growing up until I got this box of memorabilia from a relative, so then I could really start to piece together his years all through high school. All at once, I had a lot more information.\n\nHow much appreciated was your father in the 1930s and 1940s as a filmmaker?\n\nOh, at that time, he was a very important director. I think many historians misunderstand my father because a lot of them think, ‘Well, he was just a contract studio director; he directed whatever story they gave him. And then he made it.’ So they downgraded him. Now, he was a contract studio director, but he loved that. He made twenty-one films between 1930 and 1934. Well, if you weren’t a contract director, you would never have that opportunity. At Warner’s, “The Public Enemy” [1931] was one of his favorite projects. Or, let’s put it this way: the writers came to him because nobody was moving on the project, while my father loved it. He then took it to Darryl F. Zanuck, who produced many movies that Warner Brothers was making at that time—he also was my father’s producer—and my father talked him into making that picture. So my father was able to bring some projects in. But most important is that he made thirty-eight movies under contract as a contract director and another thirty-eight as a free-lance director, so I think historians missed the boat on that. If you look at the work he did after 1934, when he stopped being a contract studio director, pictures like “Call of the Wild” [1935], “A Star Is Born” [1937], “Nothing Sacred” [1937], “Beau Geste” [1939], “Roxie Hart” [1942], “The Story of G.I. Joe” [1945], “Battleground” [1949] and so many others, I think those are his best work. And those are pictures that he chose for the most part. Okay, in order to do “The Ox-Bow Incident” [1943], he had to do two pictures for Darryl F. Zanuck at 20th Century Fox, “Thunder Birds: Soldiers of the Air” [1942] and “Buffalo Bill” [1944]. My father would not have chosen those, so he made a few concessions along the way. But pretty much, he was able to make the films that he wanted to make.\n\nHow groundbreaking was “Battleground,” because it was totally different compared to most of the other World War II films made in the 1940s?\n\nThere’s a great story on that because Dore Schary, who was running MGM when “Battleground” was made, had come over from RKO. He had been trying to make “Battleground” for a few years, but so many World War II movies had been made in the 1940s that the studios thought they had made enough and that the public didn’t want any more of them. But he wouldn’t give up. And when he came over to MGM, he wanted to make “Battleground” and talked about it to my father, because he thought my father had made the best war movie called “The Story of G.I. Joe” [1945], and so he wanted him to direct “Battleground.” Then my father decided to do it. In Hollywood, they made jokes about making another war film; they called it Schary’s follies. But it turned out to be a terrific war film, with many Academy Award nominations—it was expected to win the Oscar for Best Picture. But my father was a maverick, a rebel; he didn’t have many friends in high places, so he wasn’t going to get the accolades that he really deserved. He had too many enemies, but I think “Battleground” should have won: it was so successful and such a wonderful film, also considering how much better it was compared to every other war film made in the 1940s by every studio. But anyway—that’s what happened.\n\nWhy do you think he had so many enemies here in Hollywood?\n\nWell, he had so many fights with so many of the moguls that ran Hollywood: they wanted him because he could make any kind of film, always on schedule, on budget, but he also was a wild hair, you know. Even though he had acquired the reputation of ‘tough to control,’ his ability to make all kinds of films on schedule and within budget made him very appealing to other studios and producers, especially if they left him alone. He was only friendly with two people who ran studios in all those years, and they were David O. Selznick and Dory Schary for a period of time. Otherwise, he never socialized with anyone of them.\n\nHow would you describe his approach towards filmmaking?\n\nMy father never cared about self-gratification; he loved making movies and the process of making movies. He was a person with high energy, great enthusiasm, and not much patience. He would do two takes—one for protection. He believed in the spontaneity of the moment; he didn’t believe that if you kept doing it over and over, it would be better. He thought it would be worse. And he didn’t have the patience, for instance, to sit in the editing room for weeks and weeks. Frank Capra was a very good friend of my father, he lived in our neighborhood, and they used to kid each other. One time, Frank Capra spent a year developing a story, writing the script, shooting the film, editing, post-production, and finally, it got released in a year’s time. My father had made three films in the meantime. My father once said he was tired of every film he ever made, and then he couldn’t wait to get to the next picture. So there were certain things that he developed, like editing in the camera. If you look at his movies, you’ll always find shots where all of the action, or at least most of the action, takes place in one camera position. Take the hanging scene in “The Ox-Bow Incident,” if you watch that scene again, the camera is in one position when the order is given to hit the horses and have them run off. The men are hanged, the posse get on their horses, they ride out, and the preacher is on his knees, sitting on the grass. One shot, that’s it, that’s all there is—one camera position. My father liked to do that, a great deal of action in one shot. The reason he developed that technique was that, when he was a contract studio director, often he wasn’t able to stay on a picture through post-production, he wasn’t there for the editing—or very little of it—and he didn’t want the editor to change his vision of how the scene should go. So the editor could only edit what my father gave him, and there was no way to edit a scene in some different manner. He rarely used close-ups; they were like explanation points to him. To be used very rarely. He did like master shots because then the story was not disrupted. You know, you get this one shot, and everything happens in that scene. In real important scenes, he would shoot his men in unusual ways, like having a fight, and all you could see was their feet. Things like that. In “The Ox-Bow Incident,” the reading of the letter, you don’t see Henry Fonda’s eyes; you only see his mouth. He liked to do those things, and you’ll see those in all of his movies. There’s always rain; there’s always a dog… That was my father’s style and humor. He was interjecting humor into his stories; even in some dramatic places, there’d be some kind of bizarre humor.\n\nHow did he collaborate with his actors?\n\nHe would rehearse a scene, and then, when he thought it was right, he’d shoot it. No long rehearsals over and over again. In my documentary, Richard Widmark said, ‘Your father could see the whole movie in his mind before he started on the first day.’ He knew exactly how the movie was going to look. One of the treasures that I have are all of my father’s shooting scripts with his personal notes, going back to the early 1930s. So I can see where he changed a scene, like, for instance, the famous scene in “The Public Enemy” [1931] where James Cagney pushed the grapefruit in Mae Clarke’s face. Okay, now everyone has tried to take credit for that. Darryl F. Zanuck said it was his idea, but if you look in my father’s shooting script, the writers wrote that the James Cagney character was supposed to pick up the grapefruit and throw it at Mae Clarke. That’s what they wrote. With his pencil, my father wrote: ‘Have Cagney pick up the grapefruit and shove it into Mae Clarke’s face.’ He changed it to that point, but they didn’t tell her. She didn’t know it was coming. She thought it would be thrown at her because she was going by the script. So with those things, I can see where my father made changes which I think are very interesting. I think people will like that when they see it in my next book. I wrote the first book in ten months because I had all the source material, but the second book takes me much longer. Before he died, he told me, ‘I lived the life of a hundred men.’ Once you start researching, you realize he did… He had five wives, for instance. His whole life was such an adventure. First, he was a juvenile delinquent kicked out of high school, then a fighter pilot in the first World War, and then he became a messenger boy in Hollywood who moved up to become an actor, assistant editor, editor, assistant director, and director.\n\nIs that the secret why he became such a good director: working his way up the studio ladder and going through all the various stages in the film industry?\n\nI think so. My documentary premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 1996, and Robert Redford—we were pals when we were kids, we were on the same baseball teams and went to the same grammar school—we had dinner at Sundance. He said that directors like my father, or Howard Hawks, John Ford, Raoul Walsh, Victor Fleming—those directors—brought their life experiences to the screen. Nowadays, a filmmaker learns his trades in film schools and books. And I think that’s very true: my father had all these life experiences that he could bring to the screen, from working his way up in the business. Back then, in my father’s time, there were no film schools, so he learned everything firsthand. He was an assistant director on many pictures before he became a director. So by the time he got to be a director, he knew his business. The thing that I appreciate so much about my father’s work is that you can take his films apart, genre by genre, and he will always have films that will be up there with anybody’s films—whoever you think is the best. Whether you’re talking about Westerns, or war films, comedies, drama—whatever type of film you want to talk about—he’s got at least one film up there. Look at two war films like “The Story of G.I. Joe” and “Battleground”: that’s as good as anybody has done. Westerns? All of his Westerns were off-beat Westerns, like “Yellow Sky” [1948] or “Westward the Women” [1951]. They were not traditional Westerns. “Buffalo Bill” [1944] was, but that was not a film he wanted to make. I think that after all the Westerns he directed in his early career, he only appreciated the unusual story of the Western. If you look at his comedies, you got “Nothing Sacred” [1937] or “Roxie Hart” [1942]; adventure films like “Beau Geste” [1939]; aviation films—my God—“Wings” [1927], “Island in the Sky” [1953], “The High and the Mighty” [1954]. Or kid pictures, did you ever see “The Happy Years” [1950]? I love that one! “Good-bye, My Lady” [1956] was one of my father’s favorite films; it’s about an old man [Walter Brennan], a boy [Brandon De Wilde] and a dog living in the country, just a little coming-of-age movie. It’s also one of Sidney Poitier’s first films—a wonderful little film.\n\nHow do you explain that so very often, actors or actresses were nominated for Academy Awards when they appeared in your father’s films?\n\nI think, for the most part, he was an actor’s director. But there were certain actors that he really liked and other ones that he didn’t. A director who’s the perfect actor’s director treats everybody the same, you know. My father had his favorites, some he treated well, some he didn’t. But he got the performances in all his movies. William Wellman movies were known for having fine performances, men and women. He had so much enthusiasm; I am so grateful that I got to work in his last two films as an actor. To see that enthusiasm, that, of course, I knew that he had, but to see it on the set, how excited he was to make a movie. He just loved it, you know, the camera, the shot… It was sad that he quit the movie business after “Lafayette Escadrille” [1959]. He was so disappointed in that movie while he wanted that movie to be his best one. It was all about the guys he knew that he flew with in the first World War—I played him in that movie. That character did a lot of things that my father did. The woman in that film, her character is called Renée [played by French actress Etchika Choureau] and my father—nobody knew this until 1973—that my father’s first wife was a French girl named Renée. She was killed in the first World War, and in the film, that character was based on her. He made her a prostitute, which in real life she wasn’t. But when reading all the letters that my father wrote home from France, I find all the experiences that were put in that movie. They happened! Now, my father wanted James Dean to play the lead, he had talked to Dean’s agent, and James Dean was supposed to have a meeting with him, and then he died. Then my father wanted Paul Newman, a new contract player at the studio, but Jack L. Warner wouldn’t let my father use Paul Newman because Newman was mad at Warner Brothers for making him do “The Silver Chalice” [1954]. Warner wanted to put him on suspension. So my father couldn’t use him, and he was talked into using Tab Hunter. Now you have to keep in mind that Tab Hunter was the Tom Cruise of the 1950s, but he wasn’t right for it. When my father realized it was a mistake, he was already shooting. Tab Hunter wasn’t right for the character as it should have been. It’s not that Tab Hunter gave a bad performance, I think he gave a good performance, but he wasn’t what my father had expected. When the studio saw the film, they wanted a happy ending to keep the fans of Tab Hunter pleased. They took out a lot of stuff and basically ruined the picture, and when it came out, it was a failure. So then my father said, ‘I want out of this business.’\n\nWas he bitter, after the long and successful career he had, to leave like this? Or was it merely a matter of timing, since for several directors of his generation, like Frank Capra, John Ford, and so many others, they all retired in a very short period of time?\n\nHe was unhappy, very disappointed. But by then, he had many physical problems as well; he had very bad arthritis, and also, he felt it was a good time. The studio system was falling apart, and he liked that support system behind him even though he fought with the studio heads. How wonderful it was to be able to make a film, and everything was there for you. You didn’t have to worry about negotiating with an agent for an actor, you got a list of them. Who do you want? You want James Cagney or Humphrey Bogart? The most wonderful actors and actresses were all there; they were all under contract. Everything was there, the entire factory. In the 1930s, Warner Brothers had a department that wrote titles only. They didn’t write stories; they just wrote titles. So if you were looking for a title, or you didn’t like the title, they got you a list of titles. Everything was there for you, so it was wonderful, and my father also used all of that. And when my father retired, the studios fell apart, the moguls went away or were already gone, the studios were run by businessmen who knew nothing about film. Even though my father fought with those moguls—they were like tyrants—he respected them; they knew film, and they made great pictures.\n\nDo you think he got the most out of his career?\n\nI think he did. Turner Classic Movies have thirty-five of my father’s films; they play them all the time. Now there’s a DVD collection out of my father’s films, called “Forbidden Hollywood, Volume 3,” with six of the movies he made in the early 1930s [“Other Men’s Women,” “The Purchase Price,” “Frisco Jenny,” “Midnight Mary,” “Heroes for Sale,” “Wild Boys of the Road”], along with my documentary. Richard Schickel once did a documentary called “The Men Who Made the Movies,” he kind of re-did it; I gave him some pictures, and now he has made individual documentaries about those filmmakers. This collection includes the one he made about my father. My documentary is about the people who worked with my father, talking about him, the icons like Robert Mitchum, Clint Eastwood, Robert Redford, Sidney Poitier, Richard Widmark, Nancy Davis Reagan and Jane Wyman, while on Schickel’s documentary, it’s my father talking about his career. So they go together nicely. Now, he’s more known than in the 1970s or the 1980s, so that’s a good thing. When I read articles in the newspaper about the great directors, my father’s name is among them. For many years, they didn’t mention him. Now they talk about Hawks and Ford, and Capra and Wellman; that didn’t happen before. So the people who care about the old films and who write about them, they can see his films now. They appreciate what he’s been able to do. So I feel very good about this, also about the fact that I will have two books out about him.\n\nHow do you look back to your childhood, growing up in Hollywood?\n\nI had a wonderful childhood. If I wasn’t at school, my father was always taking me on his sets and locations. I loved it; it was magic, you know. I once counted, we had thirty-five celebrities in our neighborhood, and I’m talking about two blocks north, east, south, and west, that’s about it. Gary Cooper, Tyrone Power, Henry Fonda and his family, Deanna Durbin, The Andrew Sisters, Lana Turner, Jennifer Jones, Red Skelton, Peter Lawford, William Boyd, Nelson Eddy, … Only when I got older, I realized that my neighborhood was unique. So for me, and going on the sets with my father, I always thought it was the most wonderful thing you could imagine. The first time I was on the set was “Nothing Sacred” [1937]. I was about six months. Of course, I don’t remember anything about that, but there’s a picture of Carole Lombard holding me in her arms. My first remembrance is “The Ox-Bow Incident” [1943], I was five years old, and I got a lot of pictures from that. I remember going to the studio with my father, driving up to the sound stage, because they had shot the entire movie on a sound stage. So as a five-year-old kid, walking indoors and seeing things that are normally outdoors—rocks, dirt, and trees—it was unbelievable. I remember following this little stream; it all looked so real, the rocks looked so real, but when you looked at the other side of them, you saw they were fake. But they could make everything real. On other sets, “Yellow Sky” [1948] and “Across the Wide Missouri” [1951], I was there the whole time, and my father took the whole family with him, wife, and seven kids. He loved to fish, and he told the production manager, ‘When you hire the crew, make sure they like to fish. Hire the ones who like to fish because that’s what we’ll be doing every day. At five o’clock, we stop shooting, we’re going to fish till the end of the day.’ I fished with Clark Gable three or four times, just the two of us. One day, he asked me, ‘I know where this special lake is. You want to go with me?’ I said, ‘Sure.’ So we walked and hiked to this small, little lake, and we went fishing there. It was all so wonderful. On Sundays, they played baseball, Clark Gable played left field. How wonderful could life be!\n\nWest Hollywood, California\n\nApril 14, 2009\n\n“Battleground” (1949, trailer)\n\nFILMS\n\nTHE WALL INVISIBLE (1918) DIR Bernard J. Durning ASST DIR William A.
