        "text": "William A. Wellman, the nearly legendary Hollywood director who made 82 movies, including “Wings,” “Beau Geste,” the original “A Star Is Born,” “Public Enemy” and the classic anti‐lynching film, “The Ox‐Bow Incident,” died of leukemia late Tuesday in his Los Angeles home. He was 79 years old.\n\nMr. Wellman was a handsome, roisterous, tough‐talking, hard‐drinking maverick, whose own life story might well have served as a screenplay for a film. As a youth he was put on probation for car theft, he dropped out of high school to become a professional ice hockey player, and he was a World War I flying ace as a member of the storied Lafayette Escadrille.\n\nMr. Wellman brought his direct knowledge of aviation to the making of the 1929 air war classic, “Wings,” which gave Gary Cooper his first important movie role, and to several other films on flying subjects, including “The High and the Mighty” and “Gallant Journey.”\n\nOne day in 1931, shortly after the start of filming “Public Enemy,” still considered one of the most vivid gangster movies ever made, Mr. Wellman took the lead away from the originally assigned actor and gave it to a promising stage performer named James Cagney.\n\nDirected Grapefruit Scene\n\nHe also directed Mr. Cagney in a bit of “business” that brought the actor immediate audience attention and set him on the way to a long and successful career. That was the now‐famous scene in which Tom, the movie's title character, having breakfast with his mistress, Kitty (Mae Clark), shoves half a grapefruit into her face.\n\nMr. Wellman was respected by most of the actors and other creative people he worked with. But it was said of him that he directed a picture “like a general trying to break out of a beachhead?” On one occasion, he had a fist fight with Spencer Tracy, who was a drinking pal. And he wouldn't hesitate to dresi down the likes of a John Wayne, with whom he made three movies.\n\n“I had a row with Duke Wayne,” Mr. Wellman told the critic Richard Schickel in “The Men Who Made the Movies.”\n\n“In ‘The High and the Mighty,’” Mr. Wellman said, “he suddenly wanted to become a directer—:he has that inclination. And I yelled ‘cut.’ And in front of a whole crew, which is a big mistake, I . . . said, ‘Look, you come back here behind the camera, and do my job, and you're going to be just as ridiculous doing it as I would be going out there with that screwy voice of yours and that fairy walk and being Duke. Wayne.’ And it quieted him. down . . . And he behaved himself because he's a—sometimes—nice guy. And I doubt very much if I could be included in the sometimes‐niceguy category.”\n\nMr. Wellman's first brush with Hollywood resulted from a friendship he struck up with Douglas Fairbanks Sr. after having landed a small plane on Mr. Fairbanks's polo field. The flier became an actor. He had a featured role in “The Knickerbocker Kangaroo,” a silent in the early 1920's. “I was so frightful,” Mr. Wellman later recalled, explaining his quick switch of interest to directing.\n\nWilliam Augustus Wellman was barn in Brookline, Mass., on Feb. 29, 1896, the son of Arthur and Cecilia McCarthy Wellman. As a youth he was arrested for “borrowing” cars for joy rides. But fortunately for him, the probation officer he was brought before happened to be his mother.\n\nBored with high school, Mr. Wellman played with a minorleague hockey team. In 1917, already interested in flying, be joined a volunteer ambulance corps formed in New York for service in France. Once there, he entered the Foreign Legion of the French Army, learned to fly a plane, and when the United States entered the war he became a member of the Lafayette Escadrille.\n\nMr. Wellman saw much action in the skies over France, and was at one point shot down. He became an ace pilot and came out of the war with the Croix de Guerre with four gold palm leaves and five United States citations.\n\nPostwar stabs at jobs as a salesman also bored him, and he soon became a wing‐walking stunt pilot in a barnstorming air show.\n\nDespite the influence. Mr. Fairbanks wielded in Hollywood, the best he could do for his protégé after Mr. Wellman suggested he'd like to direct films was to arrange a job as a messenger for him. From there Mr. Wellman worked his way up to assistant director. In 1920, he directed his first film, “The Twins of Suffering Creek.” There followed such films as “The Man Who Won” (1923), “The. Cat's Pajamas” (1926) and several Westerns starring Buck Jones.\n\nThen in 1929 came Mr. Wellman's chance to make a movie about the subject he loved best, flying. He became so entranced with making “Wings,” he said years later, “that I all but gave up my principal occupations of the time, which were wenching, boozing and brawling.”\n\nWhile filming “Wings” in Texas, Hollywood legend has it, Mr. Wellman at one point became irritated by the efforts of his stunt pilots. He jumped into a rickety old plane, took it up and performed a series of daredevil stunts, then brought it down and deliberately Crashed it.\n\n“See, do it like that,” he instructed his startled pilots, as he crawled from the mangled aircraft.\n\n“Wings,” with its realistic and breathtaking—for the time shots of air war, was a landmark in movie history, and it won the first Academy Award or best movie of the year.\n\nWith “Wings” under his belt and then, in 1932, the success of “Public Enemy,” Mr. Wellman made hiinself one of Hollywood's most‐wanted directors — all this despite the fact that his personal reputation as a hell‐raiser had not diminished.\n\nDuring a‐ short stay at Metro‐Goldwyn‐Mayer in the mid‐1930's, Mr. Wellman told Mr. Schickel, he was called in Ito finish a Tarzan movie because of the illness of the origmal director. He found the job enormous fun, he said, and when he had completed work on the movie he went to Louis B. Mayer, M‐G‐M's tyrannical president, and asked to make lanother Tarzan movie on his own.\n\n“He said, ‘What are you talking about? It's, beneath your dignity,’” Mr. Wellman related. “I said To hell with it. I haven't got any dignity.’” The incident put him In the Mayer doghouse, Mr. Wellman said, but the story had a happy. ending.\n\nDuring his ensuing idleness at M‐G‐M, Mr. Wellman thought of the basic idea for “A Star Is Born” and with Robert Carson wrote a screenplay for it. The final script was written by others, including Dorothy Parker, but Mr. Wellman shared the writing Oscar it won after its release by David O. Selznick and United Artists (he was no longer with M‐G‐M) in 1937. That same Year he turned out the memorable Carole Lombard comedy “Nothing Sacred.”\n\nMr. Wellman served as cowriter and as producer on a number of his movies, including “Beau Geste,” the 1939 French Foreign Legion drama starring Gary Cooper, Ray Milland and Robert Preston. It was followed by some of the most popular pictures of their time, like “The Light That Failed,” also in 1939, the 1942 Ginger Rogers movie “Roxie Hart” (on which the Broadway musical “Chicago” is based) and “Lady of Burlesque,” 1943.\n\nIn 1943, Mr. Wellman also made the film many consider his finest—“The Ox‐Bow Incident,” a moving, starkly photographed drama about the lynching of three strangers passing through a small Western town for a crime that it turns out, never took place.\n\nMade ‘Battleground’\n\nBut there were many other finely wrought Wellman pictures, including “Battleground,” the 1949 film depicting the hardships of the American fighting men in World War II's Battle of the Bulge, and “The Story of G.I. Joe,” the 1945 picture‐ based on the war reportage of Ernie Pyle."
