        "text": "Robert Montgomery, the actor who after appearing on stage and in dozens of movies went on to become a director, producer and Presidential adviser, died of cancer yesterday at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. He was 77 years old and lived in Canaan, Conn.\n\nMr. Montgomery, on the screen, was known for the flippant, sophisticated characters he protrayed, and he often sought to break out of the mold. ''Anyone who stands still in his business or profession is lost,'' he once said.\n\nAlthough he sought roles more serious than the smirking comedian he usually played, Mr. Montgomery could just as easily poke fun at himself as at anything else. He described some of his early Hollywood roles by saying, ''The directors shoved a cocktail shaker in my hands and kept me shaking it for years.'' Not Satisfied With Acting\n\nWhen he was able to put aside the shaker, he won critical aclaim in deeper roles. His performances as the pathological Cockney murderer in ''Night Must Fall,'' the gangster who inherits a British title in ''Earl of Chicago'' and the ghostly saxophone-playing fighter in ''Here Comes Mr. Jordan'' showed his versatility and drew praise.\n\nBut even a wider-range of acting was not enough. Mr. Montgomery pressed on, and his varied ranged outside the theater. He became the first president of the Screen Actors Guild, was one of the first stars to volunteer for service in World War II and when Dwight D. Eisenhower ran for the Presidency in 1952, Mr. Montgomery was his television coach.\n\nWhen General Eisenhower became President, Mr. Montgomery stayed on in his role as television adviser to become the first show-business professional to occupy an office in the White House. It was on the second floor and had his name on the door. Took Over From Drew Pearson\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
