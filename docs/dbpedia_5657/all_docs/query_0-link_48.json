There I first encountered many marvelous foreign-language films of the period, including Bread and Chocolate, Spirit of the Beehive, Jonah Who Will Be 25 in the Year 2000, and Seven Beauties. But occasionally the department’s interpretation of “international” was opened up slightly, to include films of European-born directors working in Hollywood, such as Billy Wilder and Ernst Lubitsch. And one chilly Friday night in October 1978, the film shown was Fritz Lang’s The Woman in the Window. I became entranced with the movie on the spot, and ultimately it led me to many of the other glorious examples of 1940s film noir, including Lang’s startling Scarlet Street and Max Ophuls’s remarkable The Reckless Moment, both of which boasted the same leading lady, Joan Bennett. Ten years later, by this time launched on a career in journalism, I met Joan Bennett at her home in Scarsdale, New York. My encounter with her was memorable as well as slightly disappointing. She was courteous and charming, but fuzzy on details of her glamorous past, and she seemed apologetically conscious of this. Nevertheless, I was always aware that I was in the presence of a star: although she gave me very little information, her few deeptoned observations, mysterious silences, and long, slow drags on her Carltons somehow made a potent impression on me. I sensed that there was a great deal in what she wasn’t saying, and I decided to find out about it on my own. In the back of my mind was the vague notion that if what I discovered seemed interesting enough, I ix\n\nPreface might try to undertake a book about the entire family. As it turned out, it was, and I did. By the time I began my research in earnest in 1998, I had already read two books that were to be of the utmost importance to me. The first was The Bennett Playbill, Joan’s own history of her family, written with actress-author-director Lois Kibbee and published in 1970. It has proven a very useful guide to the Bennett family history. Matthew Bernstein’s admirable biography of Joan’s third husband, Walter Wanger: Hollywood Independent, surely one of the most painstakingly researched studies of exactly how films get made, was also a welcome anchor as I began work on my book. At numerous archives, my queries were placed in capable and trustworthy hands. For information on Richard Bennett’s early life, I am indebted to Martha Wright of the Indiana State Historical Society and Patricia Al-Wahaili of the Indiana State Library. I spent a fascinating week at the State Historical Society of Wisconsin, where Walter Wanger’s papers are housed; there I received an enthusiastic reception from Maxine Ducey and her staff. I also owe deepest thanks to the staffs of the Film and Television Archives at the University of California at Los Angeles, the Lincoln Center Library for the Performing Arts, the Library of Congress, the Lilly Library at Indiana University, the Sterling Library at Yale University, and the motion picture department of The George Eastman House. Thanks also to Barbara Hall of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Annette Fern of the Harvard Theater Collection, Martin Jacobs of the Museum of the City of New York, Steve Wilson and the staff of the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Collection at the University of Texas at Austin (in particular, my research proxy, Bill Fagelson), Sean D. Noel of the Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center at Boston University, Stephen Reynolds of the Duke of York’s Theatre, and Raymond Wemmlinger of the Hampden/Booth Theater Library of The Players. Special thanks to Ned Comstock of the University of Southern California Cinema and Television Archive. Ned did many special favors for me, including dredging up materials from USC’s Warner x\n\nPreface Bros. archive and tracking down financial reports from Constance Bennett’s RKO years. I was unprepared for the generosity extended to me by many well-respected writers on film. Donald Spoto was among the first to encourage me to write about the Bennett family. I am also indebted to Jeanine Basinger, James Harvey, Roy Moseley, Robert Osborne, Barry Paris, Sam Staggs, James Watters, and most of all to Ronald L. Bowers, who spent many hours recalling his close friendship with Joan Bennett. Ron also telephoned me with numerous leads and ideas, and lent me many out-of-print volumes from his vast collection of cinema books. His enthusiasm for Hollywood’s golden age is boundless. Thanks also to Howard and Ron Mandelbaum of Photofest, Jerry Ohlinger, and Bill Sprague, for providing me with a copy of Barbara Bennett’s hard-to-find film Syncopation, and to Tom Toth, for sharing his print of Constance’s silent hit Sally, Irene and Mary. For help in negotiating the legal maze regarding Philip Plant’s estate, I owe deep thanks to Jackie Zeppieri of the New London, Connecticut, Probate Court, and Helen Falvey and Alice Schroeder of the Groton, Connecticut, Probate Court; Ms. Schroeder was particularly helpful in laying hands on depositions related to Constance Bennett’s 1943 battle with Mae Hayward. Given the fact that so many individuals that Constance and Joan Bennett worked with are deceased, it was crucial that I secure the cooperation of surviving family members. Here I was extremely lucky. The book would not have materialized without the participation of Joan’s eldest daughter, Diana Anderson, who was enthused about the project from the beginning and lent unfailing support. On two different occasions, she opened up her home to me while I was in Los Angeles on fact-finding missions. Together we spent hours talking about all the Bennetts; Diana’s shrewd perceptions and strong family feeling helped immeasurably in creating the backbone of the book. I am also delighted to have had the contributions of all five of her children: Amanda Anderson, Timothy Anderson, Cynthia Anderson Barker, Lisa Anderson, and Felix Werner. xi\n\nPreface I met Constance’s son, Peter Plant, at a birthday party for Diana in New York in 1997. Over the years, Peter had spoken about his mother with only a handful of writers, and then only on very limited topics. Once I described my concept of the book to him, however, he gave me his fullest cooperation. I came to admire his honesty, humor, fairness, and precision; his answers to my questions were always carefully weighed and scrupulously considered, and together we made our way through some of the more baffling episodes in his mother’s life. That I was able to earn his trust means a great deal to me. I am also pleased to have secured the participation of Constance’s two daughters, Lorinda Roland and Gyl Roland, both of whom gave generously of their time—Lorinda at her artist hideaway on Orcas Island, Washington, and Gyl at her Los Angeles apartment. Their perspectives contrasted sharply with one another, but in the end, both were tremendously helpful in putting together a portrait of their complex mother. Thanks, also, to Joan’s second daughter, Melinda Markey, who spoke with me by telephone from her home in South Carolina. I am also grateful to Joan’s two youngest daughters, Stephanie Wanger Guest and Shelley Wanger, who met with me several times in New York. Michael Downey is the oldest and only surviving child of Barbara Bennett and Morton Downey. From the outset, Michael made it clear that he guarded his privacy zealously and that his participation would be quite limited. Once we connected, however, he was willing to share his memories, and I am happy that he was. I met with David Wilde, Joan’s fourth husband, several times at his home in Scarsdale, New York. Sadly, David did not live to see the book reach publication; overcome by depression and declining health, he committed suicide late in 2001. Deepest thanks to the many other people who took the time to speak with me: Iris Adrian, Hartney Arthur, Nancy Barrett, Mary Cooper, Arlene Dahl, Tony de Santis, Carmen DiRigo, Edward Downey, Keir Dullea, Alice Faye, John Frankenheimer, James Fraser, Penny Fuller, Henry Garson, Janet Fox Goldsmith, Louise Gore, xii\n\nPreface James Graves, Jane Greer, Peter Haskell, Helen Hayes, Charles Hollerith, Marsha Hunt, Alexandra Iles, Salome Jens, Marta Eggerth Kiepura, Jack Klugman, Susan Kohner, Florence Kriendler, Paula Laurence, June Lockhart, Patricia Coulter McElroy, Ellie and Victor Morrison, Julian Myers, Patricia O’Connell, Neva Patterson, Jim Pierson, Donald Pippin, Vera Hruba Ralston, Charles Nelson Reilly, Hilda Rolfe, Kathryn Leigh Scott, Daniel Selznick, Harvey Silbert, Erica Silverman, Penny Singleton, Anne Slater, Peggy Sobel, Jan Sterling, Risë Stevens, Gloria Stuart, William Studer, Bazey Tankersley, Audrey Totter, Marie Wallace, Robert Wallsten, Arthur Whitelaw, Victoria Wilson, William Windom, Teresa Wright, and Jane Wyatt. Of all those I interviewed, I am especially indebted to Joan’s good friend Richard Stack. As the book progressed, I leaned heavily on Richard, and always welcomed his insights and points of view. He has in turn become a great friend of mine. Four colleagues at Opera News were of enormous help. F. Paul Driscoll, the magazine’s editor-in-chief, was a valued resource throughout the writing. He possesses an astonishing command of film and theater history, and as the book progressed, he was never too busy to discuss a point that was perplexing me at any given moment. Elizabeth Diggans, Opera News’s associate art director and an inveterate film-lover, lent welcome humor and encouragement along the way. Assistant editor Betsy Mingo helped me with much of the research—always thoroughly, always promptly. Art director Gregory Downer generously provided my jacket photo. Many of the Bennett family’s films I viewed with my good friends Tracy Turner and Arlo McKinnon, who offered insightful comments and, as always, good company. Other friends who helped in a variety of ways include Patricia Adams, Sara Charlton, Craig Haladay, Jessica and Omus Hirshbein, James M. Keller, Brenda Lewis, John Manis, Eric Myers, Karen Kriendler Nelson, David Niedenthal, Rebecca Paller, Monica Parks, Brooks Peters, Cynthia Peterson, Fred Plotkin, Robert Sandla, Helen Sheehy, and James Whitson. I was delighted by the highly professional treatment my book received from the staff of the University Press of Kentucky. Ken Cherry xiii\n\nPreface was enthusiastic about the project from the beginning. And working with Leila Salisbury and David Cobb has been pure pleasure. I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Joel Honig, who died in September 2003 and whose absence is sorely felt. For years, dozens of authors enjoyed the benefit of Joel’s adroit editing, impeccable research skills, and depths of arcane knowledge. He was a busy freelance copy editor (including a nineteen-year association with Charles Scribner’s Sons), and always he labored to make the books he was entrusted with as good as they possibly could be. He was a superb writer himself; for many years, I had the pleasure of working as his editor at Opera News. With The Bennetts, the tables were turned, and Joel played his role with relentless brilliance, always pressing me to go further, to make the story of the Bennetts more incisive, illuminating, and alive. I am lucky to have the sustaining presence in my life of my family. My parents, Jack and Marjorie Kellow, and my brother and sister-in-law, Barry and Kami Kellow, have always encouraged my writing pursuits and my interest in the performing arts, and I am grateful. Most of all, I was blessed to have Bill Braun by my side throughout my work on the book. He endured watching many old movies that he easily could have done without, always asking, in vain, if tonight’s selection might be in color. He didn’t complain while I neglected house and yard to concentrate on research, brought me back to earth when I panicked over deadlines, and endured my need for solitude as I bore down on the final chapters.\n\nxiv\n\nPrologue\n\nPrologue ⟈ “There are only three great actors still alive in America today,” Richard Bennett told a reporter in the early 1930s. “Maude Adams, Feodor Chaliapin, and Lionel Barrymore. Four if you count me!” Bennett could afford to be immodest—at the time he made that comment, he had racked up a record of achievement that few other actors could match. Along with John Barrymore, he was probably the most important American-born stage actor of his generation. Bennett’s stardom had slightly preceded Barrymore’s and would outlast it by several years. Yet by the mid-1920s, when Bennett had reached the zenith of his acting career, he believed that the most glorious era in the American theater had come and gone. To him, the stage was haunted by ghosts: Joseph Jefferson, who had trouped around the country for decades treating audiences to his classic portrayal of Rip Van Winkle, died in 1905. The noble, dark-eyed tragedian Edwin Booth, the most celebrated Hamlet of his day, had been dead since 1893. Charles F. Coghlan, Lester Wallack, Nat Goodwin, and Edward Harrigan and Tony Hart, and dozens of other actors whose work had been an inspiration to Bennett, had long since faded from the scene. Richard Bennett’s own stage debut had come in 1891, and although he might have had every good reason to feel nostalgic for the great stars of the period, the plays themselves were often best forgotten. While Shakespeare, in the hands of actors such as E.H. Sothern, Julia Marlowe, Viola Allen, and Otis Skinner, was a staple on the New York stage to a degree that seems unimaginable to us now, it was creaking melodrama, often running to five acts or more, that provided much of the meat of the American theater scene. 1\n\nThe Bennetts Because so few of the great stars of the last years of the nineteenth century and the first decade of the twentieth have left any permanent record of their work, we are forced to rely chiefly on written accounts from the period to gain any sense at all of what they were like onstage. These tell us, among other things, that it was an age of great personalities, in which player dominated playwright. Many stars became so identified with a single role that their demanding and unimaginative public refused to accept them in anything else. James O’Neill, father of Eugene, once a promising young actor, made such a success in an 1883 production of The Count of Monte Cristo that he became essentially a one-trick pony, doomed to play the same role over and over for the remainder of his career. Phoebe Davies played the role of Anna Moore in Lottie Blair Parker and Joseph R. Grismer’s rip-roaring 1898 melodrama Way Down East some four thousand times during the course of her career. And Bennett’s own father-in-law, Lewis Morrison, played Mephistopheles in Faust, virtually without a break, from 1885 until his death in 1906. Many of the leading stars of this period performed in a florid, heart-on-sleeve style perhaps most accurately described as “heroic,” relying on richly individual personalities, charm, and highly cultivated voices. Joseph Jefferson, one critic commented, “could have recited the alphabet in a way to make his hearers shed sympathetic tears.” They were out to please the public first, last, and always. (Critics, at this time, were of fairly little importance in determining the fate of a play; only later would they ascend to positions of power. One reason Richard Bennett scorned critics during his peak years was because he remembered the early days when they had not mattered so much.) Whatever the caliber of these performers, one condition did make theirs a golden period: they had unprecedented opportunities to perform. By the mid-1890s, New York boasted thirty-nine legitimate theaters. By 1900, the number of theaters spread out over the entire nation totaled approximately five thousand. No matter how modest their condition, these theaters added immeasurably to the cultural life of both small and large towns. In those days, the 2\n\nPrologue road was an integral part of the theater. Both major stars and thirdrate stock players traveled the length and breadth of the country. It was a bountiful era, and in his old age Richard Bennett was consumed by nostalgia for it. Writing about those long-gone days in his unpublished memoirs, from the perspective of an elderly man whose career had nearly reached its end, he insisted that he could “count on five fingers even the near-greats of today. They are not artists . . . nor nearer art than photography is to oil paintings.” This is a curious statement, and perhaps it can be attributed to nothing more than an actor’s bitterness over his failing powers and fading fame. Certainly the 1920s was one of the most remarkable decades the American theater has ever known, and the one in which Richard Bennett reached his peak. True, the rapid growth of the film industry had reduced the sheer quantity of stage productions available. By the time D.W. Griffith’s immensely successful The Birth of a Nation was released in 1915, over six thousand nickelodeons were operating around the country, while the number of professional playhouses had shrunk to something under fifteen hundred. Nevertheless, Broadway in the 1920s was a thriving industry. Exciting and innovative plays would take the theater in thrilling new directions, and the decade’s leading stars did not make only occasional appearances—they were constant, returning one season after another, providing the real backbone of Broadway. If Richard Bennett regarded this embarrassment of riches as a time of artistic bankruptcy, he was slighting some of his own brilliant contributions to the theater—something he surely never would have intended to do. Although he had appeared in many important plays during the first two decades of the century, the 1920s was a vintage period for him. Beginning with O’Neill’s Beyond the Horizon in 1920, Bennett set forth on a series of successes that gave him ample opportunity to display his acting prowess as never before. In 1921, he starred as Andrew Lane in Gilbert Emery’s The Hero, a searing drama set in the aftermath of World War I. There was Leonid Andreyev’s He Who Gets Slapped in 1922, a highly imaginative and lyrical work produced by the Theatre Guild, one of the most enterprising new organizations of the day. While visiting New 3\n\nThe Bennetts York, Konstantin Stanislavsky attended a performance of He and proclaimed Richard Bennett the finest American actor he had ever seen. The following year brought Gerald Du Maurier’s The Dancers, in which Bennett scored another success as Tony, the Canadian saloonkeeper who inherits an English title. In 1924, Bennett starred as Tony Patucci, the Italian-American vineyard owner in the Theatre Guild’s production of Sidney Howard’s They Knew What They Wanted, a work that challenged audiences’ ideas of acceptable morality. Of lesser literary quality, but a success with audiences, was Charles Beahan and Garrett Fort’s Jarnegan (1928), a sensational exposé of Hollywood, in which Richard’s youngest daughter, Joan, was introduced to Broadway. It was an impressive string of achievements, and by the end of the 1920s, few in the profession would have doubted that Richard Bennett would one day take his place among the theater’s immortals. Yet by 1930, his glory days were behind him, and only a handful of stage appearances lay in his future. In 1931, he settled in Hollywood, where two of his three daughters, Constance and Joan, were carving out successful movie careers. (At the time, Constance was billed as Hollywood’s highest-paid actress, commanding $30,000 a week.) Richard went to work in a series of mostly forgettable films. Although he grandly referred to his time in Hollywood as his “noble experiment in the sun-drenched hills,” few of his movies gave him any reason to be proud. He was dismayed to see how quickly Broadway would forget about him, how capably the theater could continue in his absence. Good riddance, he claimed. “My God,” he had said only in the mid-1920s, when his middle daughter Barbara was attracting attention as an exhibition ballroom dancer, “the day may come when I’ll be known as the father of the Bennett girls. It would damn well serve me right!” Speaking of Bought!, a mediocre 1931 movie he made with Constance, he said, defensively, “I wouldn’t give up my part in this picture for anything on Broadway.” In fact, he missed the stage desperately. Like an impulsive lover, he had turned his back on the world that had meant so much to him, and eventually seemed unable to return to it. No show business fame can fade quite so quickly as theatrical 4\n\nPrologue stardom, and year by year, Richard saw his own stunning achievements recede into a dimly remembered past. In the end, Richard Bennett failed to take his place among the immortals of the stage. Theater histories that devote ample space to the accomplishments of the Barrymores, Paul Robeson, and Laurette Taylor often sum up Richard’s career in a footnote, or omit mention of him altogether. By 1940, he was largely forgotten, financially dependent on family and friends, living a sadly reduced existence in southern California. His prediction had come true: to the extent that he was remembered at all, it was as the father of movie stars Constance and Joan Bennett. No doubt he did not feel that such a fate “served him right” at all. It must have seemed an unjust end for someone who had given so much to the theater, and gotten so much in return.\n\n5\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n1870–1900\n\nChapter One\n\n1870–1900 ⟈ Long before he was famous for being the father of Constance and Joan Bennett, Richard Bennett had been famous for the intensity of his stage performances, his heavy drinking, his brushes with the law, his long-winded curtain speeches, and perhaps most of all, for his incendiary temper. He unleashed it freely and often, until it became part of theater legend. It was an age of outsized theatrical personalities, and Richard Bennett often crossed the line between going too far—and farther. Perhaps he believed, as one journalist noted, that any good actor should behave as if the curtain had never gone down. He had an egalitarian approach to picking fights: he feuded with his wives, his daughters, his producers and directors, his leading ladies, with playwrights, politicians, servants, stagehands, and most famously of all, with critics and audiences. The sources of his outbursts included a quest for perfection, contempt for laziness and complacency, an almost adolescent love of creating chaos for its own sake, and a bitter disappointment, suffered his whole life through, that not everyone felt things as intensely as he did. About Bennett’s temper, one thing at least is clear. It was not something that he suddenly acquired as an accoutrement of theatrical stardom; it was present from early childhood. Throughout his years in the theater, the facts of Richard’s birth were jumbled and often contradictory. For reasons of his own, he took pains to obscure his birthplace as well as his birth date. Many official biographies list him as having been born in Deacon’s Mills (as the town of 7\n\nThe Bennetts Deacon was known locally), Indiana, on May 21, 1872, while some put his birth as occurring exactly one year later. In several sources, his birthplace is alternatively identified as Hoover, Bennett’s Switch, and Bennett’s Mills. Joan Bennett’s 1970 autobiography, The Bennett Playbill, further confuses matters; she states that her father’s birthplace was “Bennett’s Switch, which is located near Kokomo and Logansport on the banks of the Wabash River.” (Bennett’s Switch is not on the Wabash.) In Indiana, birth certificates are unavailable for any date preceding 1880, but the matter is somewhat clarified by the 1870 census schedule, which lists Richard’s parents, George Washington Bennett and Eliza Leonora Bennett, as residing in Deer Creek Township, a tiny village in the southwest corner of Cass County, Indiana. Their eldest child, Clarence Charles William Henry Richard Bennett, is stated as having been born in May 1870—most likely on the 21st. (Richard would be known as Clarence until sometime after he was ten years old.) Certainly many actors play fast and loose with the truth about their birth dates, and it is easy to understand why Richard would remove a few years in the hope of extending the period in which he could be considered for romantic leading-man roles. But why lie about where he was born, if he were merely going to substitute one small Indiana town for another? In any case, he probably taught his oldest daughter a trick or two in this respect: throughout her film and stage career, Constance was extremely skilled at fooling the press about her age—and numerous other things. Deer Creek was initially part of the thirty-square-mile Miami Indian reservation. Settled in the late 1830s, its population grew very little over the next few decades. By the mid-1880s, there were only fifteen people in town. Richard’s father, George Bennett, owned and operated a sawmill, like the three generations of Bennetts before him. According to Richard, George carried on another family tradition: he was a circuit rider, an unordained, itinerant preacher who traveled on horseback from town to town, proclaiming the glory of God and the rewards of salvation that lay in wait for any sinner, no matter how far gone. This particular family tradition 8\n\n1870–1900 died with George Bennett’s generation. Although he was made to attend church regularly as a child, Richard harbored a deep-seated mistrust of all religions for most of his adult life. Four years after Richard’s arrival, his mother gave birth to a daughter, Ina Blanche. When Richard was still quite young, the family moved to Kokomo, the principal town of Howard County, along the Peru and Indianapolis Rivers. As a child, he was short for his age, and extremely thin, but far from fragile. He was wild and energetic, and spent most of his time outdoors, swimming, riding ponies, roller-skating on the course between the Union and Main Street bridges, and raiding the plentiful berry patches owned by a local judge. By the time he neared school age, he had developed into something of a holy terror, not unlike the willful Georgie in his fellow Hoosier Booth Tarkington’s The Magnificent Ambersons. “Tip,” as Richard’s family nicknamed him, was constantly getting into trouble; for a small boy, he exhibited uncommonly violent behavior. At six, he hurled a kitten against a fence because it had bitten him. At seven, he kicked an elderly neighbor in the shins because she denounced him as the “meanest boy in town.” That same year, he slaughtered his pet goat because it charged his mother and sister. At eight, he was temporarily thrown out of school for writing obscenities on the schoolhouse fence. At least one of his teachers thought him emotionally disturbed, and throughout his life he exhibited all manner of bizarre behavior. These childhood incidents, strung together, suggest an intriguing pattern: a boy who has already defined himself as some kind of avenger, wildly striking back to wound those who have threatened him or the ones he loves. Apart from his parents and sister, one person Tip adored and felt enormously protective of was his Grandmother Bennett, a devout Catholic whose peaceful, orderly life was constantly disrupted by her young grandson. From an early age, Tip exhibited a pleasing singing voice. Although his grandmother tried to persuade him to pursue private organ and voice lessons, he wanted no part of music, thinking it unmanly. Tip’s aggressive nature continued throughout high school. One day, as he and his father were crossing the town square, George 9\n\nThe Bennetts reprimanded his son for swearing. Suddenly, Tip struck out at him, furiously pounding him in the face with his fists. That incident drew the attention of a friend of George Bennett’s, Sam Carson, a big, lumbering bear of a man who had once had a career as a prizefighter. Carson decided that he should take Tip to live with him at his farm some miles away, where he would put him through a kind of training program, building up his frail body and teaching him how to fight like a professional. Also, it was approaching time to harvest the cornfields, and Carson could always use an extra hand, no matter how young. George Bennett readily agreed; probably the entire family was grateful to have a reprieve from Tip’s stormy moods. Not long after Tip had joined their household, Sam Carson and his niece Mary, a pretty blonde girl, went into the parlor after dinner. Carson enjoyed listening to music in the evening, and his daughter, a competent organist with a pleasant alto voice, began to play and sing “I Know That My Redeemer Liveth” from Handel’s Messiah. Sam joined in, and after a while, the warm family scene began to make Tip feel homesick. Afraid he was going to cry, he joined in the singing. After they had sung “Little Brown Church in the Vale” and “The Old Oaken Bucket,” Sam complimented Tip on his voice and suggested that he continue to work at singing, as it would be a good method of building up his lungs. Sam stressed that while it was important for a boy to become physically strong and learn how to use his fists, it was also important to cultivate other interests, to develop a keen mind to accompany a hard, muscular body. After some months at the Carson farm, Tip began to put on pounds and gain energy; now he could run a long distance without even getting winded. Sam Carson had put together a makeshift gymnasium in the loft over the granary in the barn, where he intended to teach Tip the elements of boxing. He also promised to coach the boy in jujitsu and wrestling, hoping it would not only “make a man” out of him but also help him gain a greater understanding of people who were not as physically strong as he was. Sam was concerned that Tip had developed, at such an early age, into a reckless 10\n\n1870–1900 bully who would take on anyone in any circumstances. Sam explained patiently to Tip that he had no sense of fair play, that “we got to learn you to keep your temper no matter what comes.” Sam Carson was in many ways the strong father figure that Tip had always needed. George Bennett’s soul-saving missions had kept him away from home for long periods; more crucially, he seems to have possessed some of the same arrogance and self-absorption that his son would display throughout his life. George Bennett was a local constable, and in 1881 he was deputized by the Cass County sheriff to aid in the capture of a Dr. Henry C. Cole, Kokomo’s mayor. It ranks as one of the notorious incidents in Kokomo’s history. According to local historian Ned Booher, Kokomo had by the early 1880s acquired a reputation as a lawless town. Henry C. Cole, a Kentucky native, had assumed the office of mayor and announced his plans to clean up the town—but Cole himself was reported to have an unsavory past that included robbery, arson, and murder. The most popular version of the story has it that Cole had plotted to rob and burn one of the town’s biggest flour mills. When he arrived at the mill, armed with a pair of .38 caliber Smith & Wesson revolvers, a group of lawmen was waiting. A skirmish ensued, and the shot that killed Cole was fired by George Washington Bennett. Whatever the details of the case, George seems to have persuaded his son that he singlehandedly took care of the entire gang of outlaws headed by Cole. In 1885, the Bennetts moved to Logansport, a prosperous town of around fifteen thousand along the Wabash. It was in many respects a move up for the family: Logansport boasted handsome, well-built homes, excellent public schools, numerous churches, even a normal college and an opera house—a far cry from uncivilized Kokomo. The town had built its reputation on manufacturing— everything from flour and paper to furniture and leather goods. For a time Tip dabbled at learning the tailoring trade, but never took it too seriously. George did little to encourage him, certain that Tip would take over the family mill business. As Tip matured and began to show signs of restlessness, George decided that it might be best for him to strike out on his own. Once he got a taste of the 11\n\nThe Bennetts world, he would no doubt come running back home in no time. Soon, George had arranged a job for Tip at a clothing store in Indianapolis, run by a couple named Perry and Emily Packet. By this time, Tip was becoming an extremely handsome young man, with a strong, masculine jaw, compelling, deep-set blue-gray eyes, and an expressive mouth. His burgeoning physical maturity had a definite impact on his apprenticeship, for he later claimed that Mrs. Packet provided him with his first sexual encounter. But even more important, Mr. Packet, unaware of his wife’s relationship with his young charge, offered to take Tip to New York to initiate him into the buying end of the business. Nothing in Richard’s cornbelt background had prepared him for his first glimpse of New York City. The dramatic skyline, the multitude of ships, the great rush of horse-drawn trucks, hansom cabs, streetcars with their conductors in spit-and-polished uniforms, the street vendors hawking their goods on pushcarts—for the teenaged boy from Indiana, it seemed nearly impossible to take in. For several days, Tip made the rounds with the Packets, selecting merchandise from wholesale houses and the model dressmaking establishments such as Redfern, Ltd., the Madison Square salon owned by John Redfern, who was later appointed dressmaker to Queen Victoria. At night, while Mr. Packet collapsed into a hot bath and had dinner in his room, Tip was expected to escort Mrs. Packet to the theater. One evening, he and Mrs. Packet took in a performance of Rip Van Winkle starring Joseph Jefferson. After they had returned to their Murray Hill hotel, Mrs. Packet posed a startling question: had Tip ever thought of becoming an actor? When the young man expressed astonishment at such an idea, Mrs. Packet responded that in the short time she had known him, she had come to believe that it was the ideal profession for him. In his memoirs, Richard gives an account of what happened next. The truth of his story is doubtful—though it would account for one of the most bizarre episodes of his early life. He claims that Emily Packet told him that she was carrying his child. Mr. Packet would have to be told about it, since they had not been intimate for 12\n\n1870–1900 some time, and thus it was impossible for her to construct the fantasy that he was the child’s father. She was spared the embarrassment of her confession when Mr. Packet suffered a heart attack on the return trip to Indianapolis (“an act of Divine Providence,” Richard later called it) and died soon after. A few months later, she gave birth to a son, and only days afterward died of peritonitis. When Tip learned of the news, he was so overcome with shock, grief, and remorse that he succumbed to complete physical and emotional trauma. He passed into a semicomatose state, unable to speak. Nearly two years later, he returned to full consciousness in a hospital in Buffalo, New York, unable to remember a single thing that had happened in the interim. Throughout his life, Richard had a wild imagination, and his account of this period virtually begs to be taken for a slightly deranged fantasy. The details, taken all together, are too much to believe: the convenient deaths of both Packets just as things had become impossibly complicated, Richard’s own inability to account for two years in his life. More to the point, Indianapolis city directories from 1879 to 1890 show no Packet listed, and no obituaries are recorded for them. The truth may be simple: Richard wrote his memoirs in the mid-1930s, when he was finding it nearly impossible to get work and was financially dependent on his daughters. Perhaps the strange episode of the Packets was included merely to lure a publisher.\n\n⟈ Although Tip possessed a restless, curious nature, George Bennett never questioned that his son would eventually enter the family business. When Tip reached his late teens, George lost no time in setting him up as night watchman at the family-owned mill in Logansport. From the beginning, Tip loathed the job. It is difficult to imagine a less appropriate task for someone of his extroverted qualities. George was adamant that he continue, learning the business from the ground up, but Tip had other ideas: after all, Chicago, city of opportunity, was only 116 miles away. One day, he announced that he was going to make his own way on the open 13\n\nThe Bennetts road. He went home, packed his things, and, despite pleadings from his mother and denouncements from his father, left Logansport behind. For the next couple of years, Tip roamed around the Midwest, picking up jobs wherever he could find them. It was a hardscrabble life, and there were many nights when he went without eating or had to find makeshift sleeping arrangements, but he exulted in his newfound freedom. For a time he worked as a dishwasher in a Chicago restaurant. Once, when he was down and out, he was picked up by the managers of a touring medicine show and traveled with them for a time. On the street corners of town after town, Richard sang in a quartet, danced, or performed short sketches. Once a crowd had gathered, his boss would move in for the kill, volunteering to extract a tooth from a “stooge” planted in the crowd. The extraction was bogus, of course—the stooge would have the tooth planted on his tongue—but the crowd would be assured that it was painless, provided that a few drops of Hamlin’s Wizard Oil were applied. Then they would be given the precious chance to buy a bottle of it for only fifty cents. The medicine show eventually wound down, and by early 1891 Tip had fallen back on his routine of working at odd jobs. One night he ventured into a local playhouse to see the latest touring attraction. After the performance, he joined two of the actors for a night of heavy drinking on the town. One month later, he ran into them while visiting a burlesque house in Chicago. They were in town playing in The Limited Mail, an action-packed melodrama by Elmer E. Vance. This was a company of the “ten, twent’, thirt’” variety—the term for cut-rate touring shows that played both small towns and large cities, charging an admission fee ranging from ten to thirty cents. Although their repertory was shoddy compared with the productions Tip would have seen during his purported visit to New York with the Packets, he went to see the show a second time. Afterward, while backstage visiting his friends, he met the rest of the cast and the show’s manager. Richard’s friends, who had been impressed with his impromptu bursts of singing during their recent night on the town, recommended him to the manager. By the time 14\n\n1870–1900 he left Haviland’s Theatre that night, he had been engaged to run props, play a few minor roles, and sing in the onstage quartet—all at a salary of twenty dollars a week. On May 10, 1891, shortly before his twenty-first birthday, Richard Bennett—“Tip” was now part of his past—made his first professional appearance on the stage, in a small part in The Limited Mail, at Chicago’s Standard Theater. But he found his stint as property man loathsome because, as he put it, “a property man is a laborer socially beneath the dignity of the artists.” The Limited Mail set out on a rough-and-ready tour of one-night stands at spots along the Union Pacific, including Reno, Virginia City, and Carson City, Nevada, and Cheyenne, Wyoming. The general circumstances were primitive. Much of the audience was made up of local ranchers who poured into town on horseback or in spring wagons, carrying kerosene lamps to light their way. Even the poorest country folk considered the traveling shows enough of an occasion to turn up in their Sunday best. Guns, of course, had to be checked at the door. (Later on, Edna Ferber would characterize this breed of audience in her 1926 novel, Show Boat.) The tour made its way to Los Angeles, then a town with one main street and surrounded by acres of oat and bean ranches. After finishing up its run, the play moved back to Chicago, then on to a string of one-night stands throughout Indiana. When an actor suddenly dropped out, the management asked Richard Bennett to take over the leading role of the train conductor, and after a quick rehearsal he opened in Fort Wayne. It was not regarded as a momentous occasion by other members of the cast, who felt that Richard had rushed through the play pell-mell, with little thought about how he shared scenes with the other actors. Nevertheless, he continued in the part through Logansport, Kokomo, Muncie, and Anderson. Wherever he went, he received a valuable boost of publicity from the local newspapers, which proudly pointed out that the leading man was a Hoosier. By November, he made it to New York, at the Niblo’s Garden, at the time the city’s oldest theater. He was thrilled to be back in the city that had made such a staggering impression on him a few years 15\n\nThe Bennetts earlier. After the tour ended, Richard returned to Chicago, much more secure financially than he had been when he left. All in all, he had been on the road with The Limited Mail for fifty-four weeks. He had emerged successfully from his first theatrical experience and looked forward to enjoying a good long rest while he contemplated his next move. But he had barely gotten off the stage before he was desperate to get back on. “From the time you first cast in your lot with Thespis to the moment when the curtain goes down on your final performance,” he recalled, “ you are under a baptism and your illusions are in a constant state of being shattered. . . . Yet I know of few who would depart from its romance. Its fascination holds as nothing else, no other profession, can.” A few days after his return to Chicago, George Bennett came to visit, sure that now that Richard had some money put away, he would return to Indiana to take over the mill business. But Richard had other plans, and no amount of parental cautioning or cajoling would change that. With his father back in Indiana, Richard tried to figure out what to do next. He missed the camaraderie of the Limited Mail company, and longed to dig into another part. Before long, he received an offer to join the company of another melodrama, The Railroad Ticket, headed for the West Coast. During this tour, Richard began to revise his after-hours habits. He was less inclined to go out drinking, and instead began returning to his hotel room to settle in with a book. Though he had read very little, he soon discovered an unbridled passion for books and went on a selfimposed culture binge, reading everything he could get his hands on. Wherever he traveled, he carried a dictionary and a Roget’s Thesaurus with him. A few months later, when the tour of The Railroad Ticket had ended, Richard concluded that the life of the ten, twent’, thirt’ circuit, playing mostly one-nighters in smaller towns, was a dead end. He made his way back to New York, but was unable to secure work in the theater. With his nest egg vanishing, he took a bartending job in a joint on Houston Street. One day he spotted a newspaper advertisement for the American Academy of Dramatic Art, where 16\n\n1870–1900 his acting ambitions could be legitimized and where he might further his career. He was far too low on funds to afford the tuition that the Academy charged, so he devised a plan. The Academy offered courses in classic dancing but none in show dancing. Since the American musical comedy was becoming an ever-more significant part of the theater scene, Richard offered to teach a class in theatrical dance, in exchange for free acting instruction. As proof of his abilities, he demonstrated a buck-and-wing, waltz clog, and soft-shoe. Present at his audition was Gustave Frohman, the fasttalking producer who, with his brothers Daniel and Charles, had become a major force on the New York theatrical scene in the 1880s. Frohman was so impressed with Richard’s dancing ability and bright, energetic nature that he offered to help him find work. But Richard was adamant that he wanted to put dancing behind him permanently. “I want to be an actor,” he told Frohman, “not just one of those hams you see hanging around, but one whom managers look up to!” Frohman went home and thought the matter over. The following afternoon, he and Richard boarded the train from Grand Central bound for Chicago. Richard was afraid his money would run out, but there was some comfort in knowing that Frohman had arranged a job for him, in the Chicago company of Brandon Thomas’s Charley’s Aunt. This was something different for him: a rollicking farce about a college student, in need of a chaperone, who persuades a friend to pass himself off as his aunt. In one scene, Richard was to enter carrying a shaded lamp, which he was to put on top of a piano. At two consecutive performances, the shade slipped off the lamp, eliciting a huge laugh from the audience. But Frohman was pleased and decided to give him a larger part. Richard learned the role quickly, and Frohman subsequently helped him to get a job as a bellhop at the Palace Hotel. For twenty-five dollars a month and a room, he worked the graveyard shift, from midnight to 6 A.M. After a few hours’ rest, he reported to the theater for acting lessons from Charley’s Aunt’s director. After resting a bit more, he would report to work for the evening performance. Delighted with Richard’s progress, Frohman arranged for him to go 17\n\nThe Bennetts on the road in Charley’s Aunt. “Here I was again,” Richard would recall, “up to my neck in one-night stands. But what did I care? I was with a Frohman show, and being put through my dramatic paces every day.” In 1896, after a few more jobs in stock, Richard made an appointment to see the producer Abraham Lincoln Erlanger. A crass, vain, self-important bully, Erlanger cared much less about the theater than he did about consolidating power. In that year, along with six other managers, including his partner, attorney Marc Klaw, he formed the infamous Theater Syndicate. Originally, the Syndicate’s aims were not unreasonable: it sought to organize road shows, which for years had suffered from the chaotic and haphazard way in which they were assembled. Through the practice of block booking, the Syndicate soon amassed immense power and became a dangerous monopoly, and Erlanger ran his business with the ruthlessness of a Mafia don. The Syndicate would lease major theaters, and essentially get paid twice: once by the theater’s owners for bringing them a play to fill the house, and again by independent play producers for securing a playing space. The men who ran the Syndicate made enemies of some of the theater’s biggest names by decreeing that no star actor could have a successful career without being part of it. If actors refused to sign a long-term contract with the Syndicate, they would find it very difficult to get work, either in New York or on the road. Players such as Richard Mansfield, Mrs. Minnie Maddern Fiske, and Sarah Bernhardt turned their backs on the Syndicate, and attracted huge crowds by playing in local burlesque houses and tents. Eventually, the Syndicate was done in by the combined forces of Sam, Lee, and Jacob Shubert, who went on to form a powerful monopoly of their own. But from the 1890s through the early part of the new century, Klaw, Erlanger, and company were riding high. Richard’s first appearance for Erlanger came in a musical show, The Round of Pleasure, which opened on Broadway in May 1897 at the Knickerbocker Theatre and ran throughout the summer. When Richard had signed to do the play, Erlanger had taken out an option for his future services. During the run of The Round of Pleasure, Erlanger was approached by Charles Frohman, who was 18\n\n1870–1900 searching for a juvenile lead for his new production, The Proper Caper, and thought that Richard Bennett might do. Evidently Erlanger failed to see the same potential in the young actor, as he willingly dropped his option. Unlike Erlanger, Frohman had an abiding love for the theater and its people. As long as his breed of producer existed, star actors’ lives were reasonably secure. Helen Hayes once observed that actors during the early part of the twentieth century “had a double responsibility. If a play was not good, the audience would still come to see you. And you had to make up the difference between the bad and the good play. You felt a responsibility to those people, your public. [Later on,] actors got freed of the producers who enslaved us, and they enslaved us by coddling us and giving us an audience and promoting us. That’s how actors are developed into great stars, and they develop their public.” Throughout his career, Charles Frohman was just such a producer. Born in 1860 in Sandusky, Ohio, Frohman came to New York when he was a young man. He immediately went to work for the New York Tribune, which also employed his brother Daniel, before going into business as a producer of plays. Although in the beginning Daniel produced a tonier line of plays than his brother, Charles soon distinguished himself, both as a gambler and a sound businessman. Occasionally his productions pulled themselves together at the eleventh hour. Legend had it that, once, a foreign theatrical troupe he was presenting docked in New York at 7:30 in the evening and made it onstage in Brooklyn exactly one hour later. But whatever his methods, Charles Frohman quickly became a force to be reckoned with. In one season, he employed 792 actors in twenty-five different stage productions. Frohman always cultivated a low profile. James M. Barrie, whose Peter Pan gave Frohman one of his hardiest successes, once observed that many actors had appeared in Frohman’s productions without ever exchanging a word with him. Always shy and elusive, he was known to dart into alleyways when he saw one of his contract stars approaching on the street. Frohman’s only passion was the theater. He read plays all day long, even while he 19\n\nThe Bennetts was taking his meals. He seldom had a reserve of ready cash, for the simple reason that he perpetually dumped the proceeds from one play into the production of another. When choosing a play, he operated primarily on gut instinct. “A play that has vitality in it will sooner or later get on the stage,” he once said. “It keeps itself alive until the opportunity. I read a play. As I read it, I can see the characters and action in pantomime. That’s a good test. . . . I could not give or analyze my reasons why I choose it. It is instinctive, and that is some of the fascination of the work.” (As Richard matured as an actor, he would choose plays in a similarly intuitive way.) Frohman’s stable of stars included Maude Adams, Blanche Bates, Viola Allen, Julia Marlowe, Otis Skinner, John Drew, Julia Sanderson, and Ethel Barrymore. Many of the stars of the time seem to have succeeded on two levels: they had riveting stage presence, yet they were also capable of suggesting great intimacy with the audience, to make each person in the theater feel that they were playing to him and to no one else. Both these qualities were needed to carry the sentimental plays that the public never seemed to tire of. To be included in Frohman’s select group of actors marked an enormous step forward for Richard; it was an association that would endure for seventeen years. When The Proper Caper opened at Hoyt’s Theater on West Twenty-fourth Street, Richard wasn’t much noticed, but his next part under Frohman’s aegis represented a real breakthrough for him: the role of Dick Beach in The White Heather, a melodrama by Cecil Raleigh and Henry Hamilton that opened at the Academy of Music on Fourteenth Street and Irving Place on January 24, 1898, and ran the entire season. After The White Heather, Richard found that he didn’t have to wait long for offers of work. In the summer months, Richard often toured in stock engagements, and it was on one of these tours in 1901, while playing at Bush’s Theater in San Francisco, that he met a dark-haired, browneyed beauty named Grena Heller. He was thirty-one (at the time, quite well along for a man who had never been married). Grena was only seventeen, and had already studied piano, theory and com20\n\n1870–1900 position, both in her native San Francisco and in France. After a brief courtship, they were married. Within the year, Richard’s life on the road had become an obstacle that their marriage could not withstand, and soon they were separated, although they didn’t file for divorce until 1903. Reference to this early marriage was omitted from many of Richard’s official publicity materials, and he scarcely, if ever, mentioned her in the presence of his three children. Later in life, Grena Bennett had a successful career as a music critic for the New York American (later the Journal-American), a post she took on when she was only twenty-two. As a critic, she gave first-class coverage of events in New York, as well as abroad. She was an advocate of the American singer and seldom missed the opportunity to sail to Italy whenever American artists were performing major roles in the leading opera houses there. Grena was a person of great spirit and resourcefulness, even if she didn’t always hold to the strictest journalistic standards. Once, in 1943, she was assigned to cover Ezio Pinza’s Metropolitan Opera performances of Les Contes d’Hoffmann. Unfortunately, she became ill and was unable to attend the performance, so she secretly asked her close friend Marta Eggerth, the noted Hungarian soprano, to go in her place. “After each act I had to call her,” remembered Eggerth, “and it was wonderful, except for Pinza, who made very bad errors. He did not get good applause; it was not a success with the audience. Now, if I were a critic, I simply could not write anything negative, so I had told her it was wonderful and gorgeous. And she got in the biggest trouble, because all of the other newspaper reviews were bad except for her review in the Journal-American! She said, ‘Marta—never again. It was your debut as a critic, and your good-bye.’” It was easy for Richard to blame the collapse of his marriage on the rigors of touring. But there was another, more important reason. In September of 1900, he had gone into Charles Frohman’s production of A Royal Family, by Captain Robert Marshall. In the supporting cast was another seventeen-year-old girl, Mabel Adrienne Morrison. 21\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n1900–1904\n\nChapter Two\n\n1900–1904 ⟈ From the time they met during rehearsals of A Royal Family, Mabel Morrison was one woman Richard Bennett consistently failed to dominate. No doubt this first-generation actor was somewhat intimidated by Mabel’s distinguished theatrical pedigree. Her father, Lewis Morrison, was one of the most successful actor-managers of his time. Morrison had practically made a career out of touring in one role—Mephistopheles in his own production of Faust—and he had long been one of Richard’s idols. Mabel’s mother, Rose Wood, was one of the most prominent actresses of the 1880s. Rose had enjoyed her first success touring with stock companies in the midwestern and southern United States and had appeared with her husband at the Walnut Street Theater in Philadelphia. But it was as a leading lady at New York’s famed Wallack’s Theatre that she found stardom, in roles such as Lydia Languish in Richard Sheridan’s The Rivals. Rose’s side of the family could boast of having had actors in several preceding generations. Her father, William F. Wood, was one of the most skilled pantomimists of his day. A derivative of the classic Italian commedia dell’arte, pantomime was a thriving art form in the early nineteenth century, a lively combination of song, dance, pratfalls, and biting topical satire, often aimed at leading public figures. Eventually, the material of pantomime moved onto higher moral ground, and here William F. Wood found fame in dramas such as The Cherokee Chief and His Poor Dog Tray and 23\n\nThe Bennetts The Dumb Man of Manchester. Rose’s grandfather, William Wodin (later changed to “Wood”) was a Welshman who traveled to England, where in the waning days of the eighteenth century he became a strolling player—an actor who moved from town to town, performing in whatever space might be available, whether it was country inn or country fair. Mabel was not the only member of her generation to continue the family tradition. Her older sister, Rosabel, had gone on the stage while still in her teens, achieving particular distinction in 1885 as Marguerite in her father’s production of Faust. A graceful and willowy dark-haired beauty, Rosabel was later praised by one newspaper critic as one of the theater’s outstanding interpreters of the doomed Marguerite. Rosabel soon took on additional duties. Rose Wood and Lewis Morrison were divorced in 1890. While Lewis found himself another wife, actress Florence Roberts, the collapse of the marriage triggered a latent streak of emotional instability in Rose. She began to withdraw more and more, leaving Rosabel in charge of her younger siblings—Mabel and Victor Jago. Lewis, away on tour and busy with his new wife, provided unstinting financial support but little else. Rose’s bouts of depression would grow worse as time went on, and she would finish out her life as a virtual shut-in. Perhaps it was the loss of anything resembling a stable home environment that made Mabel so eager to set out on a career of her own. She had made her professional debut at an even earlier age than Rosabel—in 1896, when she was thirteen, in the secondary part of Anita in an adaptation of Prosper Merimée’s Carmen, with Rosabel in the title role. Despite Mabel’s impatience to launch her acting career, it seems that there was little rivalry between the sisters. Increasingly, Lewis Morrison’s frequent absences and Rose Wood’s gradual withdrawal from the mainstream of life assigned Rosabel to the role of surrogate mother to her two younger siblings. For Mabel, this fragmented family life gave rise to a fierce desire for independence. For the youngest child, Victor, the chaos of his parents’ life left him with a distaste for the acting profession; 24\n\n1900–1904 he would be the only Morrison of his generation to turn his back on the theater, opting instead for a military career. Mabel’s performance in Carmen struck her father as so promising that once the tour closed, he began to coach her in the role of Juliet. He reasoned that, unlike many actresses who attempted it, she would be the correct age to play Shakespeare’s heroine. Her subsequent success in the part cemented her father’s belief in her abilities, and for the next few years he included her in the extensive national tours of his own company, in which her greatest triumph came with Rosabel’s old part, Marguerite in Faust. Although she was not under personal contract to Charles Frohman, Mabel had appeared in several of his productions by the time she joined the cast of A Royal Family. Like her sister, Rosabel, Mab, as the family called her, was striking. Sloe-eyed and with a broad nose and a good firm jaw, she was the kind of woman once described as handsome. She wore clothes with great style and favored bright, exotic colors that made her look, according to one reporter, “like a flag flying.” Her temperament was essentially serene, but her surface coolness masked a formidable strength of will. Her warm, cello-like voice and natural aristocratic bearing made her steadily employable in any plays that featured “well-bred” female characters. “Born in the theater and of it,” Richard remembered, “with no small opinion of her ideas, she was much given to having her own way in all things. . . . She was smart. And talk! I could listen to her for hours, watching the fire spring into her brown eyes when she was enthused over some book or hero.” All of these qualities contributed to Mabel’s popularity with men. During the run of A Royal Family, Richard had plenty of opportunity to observe the parade of stage-door Johnnies who came calling for her in their hansom cabs. Richard judged that she was “socially bent,” with “a definite leaning toward the Uptown Blue Book.” When Richard asked her why she seemed to favor him over all her other prospective beaus, her reply caught him off guard. “You are the first person I’ve ever met who cared nothing for anything or anybody. I don’t think you’d care if the world blew up!” These were exactly the words that Mabel’s suitor longed to 25\n\nThe Bennetts hear. One evening, after a performance, Mabel introduced Richard to her father. One might have expected that the rising young actor would put on at least a show of humility when coming face to face with the celebrated Lewis Morrison. But there was no chance of that. “I’m glad to meet you, Mr. Morrison,” said Richard as he stuck out his hand. “I have always wanted to meet you, one of the great artists of our day. Think of being the confrere of people like Booth, Jefferson, Modjeska, Neilson, Rehan . . . the giants of our theater! . . . I wish I could have more opportunity to study their technique. Go to the theater now. What do you see? A lot of nambypambies . . . the spawn of bricklayers and scavengers . . . We have today, in our leading positions, a lot of airy, fairy Lillians!” First impressions notwithstanding, Richard was invited out to the Morrisons’ country house near Peekskill, New York, on the following Sunday. The estate was sizeable, and as Richard drove up in a hired team he saw immaculately trimmed hedges and graveled walks, with young people playing croquet near the carriage house, others shooting on the archery field. Mabel looked lovely and pristine in a crisp white dress, and Richard knew at once that he really was in love with her. “I had never seen anything so beautiful in such a perfect setting,” he remembered. He could not have anticipated what happened later that day. While presiding over tea on the verandah, Lewis Morrison took it upon himself to announce Mabel and Richard’s engagement. “Here I was, hooked high and dry,” said Richard. “I gulped the scalding tea and never noticed it was hot.” Mabel’s intended chose not to debate the matter of the wedding, only the details of where and when it would be. Rather than have a private ceremony at the Morrison farm, as Lewis Morrison had hoped, Mabel and Richard decided to elope and were married by a justice of the peace in New Jersey on November 8, 1903. After a brief honeymoon in Europe, the newlyweds returned to New York. Richard was preparing to go on tour with a play he had recently performed with success in New York, Augustus Thomas’s The Other Girl. Because his weekly salary had been raised 26\n\n1900–1904 to $150, while Mabel’s was a mere $45, Richard suggested it would be less costly for her to forgo the tour and stay at home. If they were touring together, she would expect to stay in more comfortable and expensive hotels along the way; he could stay in cheaper places, and thus they could save a good deal of money. What he hadn’t reckoned on was Mabel’s steely determination to continue her career, married or not. To top if off, she had been offered a contract to support Annie Russell in Jerome K. Jerome’s Miss Hobbs. Richard was livid. A woman belonged at home—but Mabel thought otherwise. She had just begun to make progress in the theater, and she was not about to walk out on a promising career and sit at home, waiting for her husband to return from one of his lengthy tours. A terrible row ensued, and Richard stormed out and moved into a boarding house. Because he had crisscrossed the country for years with his own wife, Lewis Morrison did not share his son-inlaw’s view. Having encouraged Mabel to pursue acting in the first place, Lewis saw no reason for her to give it up merely because she had married an arrogant, hidebound man who had yet to make his own mark in the theater. After giving the matter some thought, Lewis decided to pay Richard a visit. The meeting did not go well. Any good will that Richard might have built up with his new father-in-law vanished, as their discussion degenerated into a frenzy of name-calling. “If all you married my daughter for is to make a slave of her,” railed Morrison, “make her old through bearing children while you prance around the country preening yourself like a turkey cock, then you are not fit to be a husband!” Richard returned the volley, telling Lewis that he was in no position to pass judgment. After all, Mabel had repeatedly told Richard that her father had always put career before family. The argument grew more and more incendiary until Lewis brought it to an end by punching Richard in the nose. Mabel and Richard managed to settle their differences temporarily, and all was serene for a while—until The Other Girl commenced its tour in March 1904. In Baltimore, the play’s leading lady, Elsie de Wolfe, fell ill with bronchitis. There was no under27\n\nThe Bennetts study—in those days, road productions often did without them— and Mabel, sensing that this might be her big chance, asked Richard to use his influence with Charles Frohman to let her go on in de Wolfe’s place. Richard telephoned Frohman, who agreed. This was not at all what Richard wanted to hear. A part this good might put Mabel over in a big way and dash any hopes of keeping her at home. So he decided to lie, to tell Mabel that Frohman was in Boston and couldn’t be reached. Just then, they were interrupted by the stage manager, who showed them the telegram he had just received from Frohman. It read, “PUT MORRISON IN DE WOLFE’S PART. . . . FROHMAN.” Mabel was enraged. “Liar!” she screamed, and ordered Richard out of the room. When he returned, several hours later, her bags were gone. The hotel clerk told Richard that Mabel had checked out and left no forwarding address. Richard hastened to the nearest bar, where he consumed one bourbon after another. When he arrived at the theater, there was a note waiting from Mabel: “All I ask of you is to stay away from me. I won’t grieve if it’s forever.” Still reeling from too many drinks, Richard managed to stagger through that night’s performance. After the curtain came down, the stage manager approached him. Mabel’s performance, he said, had been unsatisfactory, and he was going to send for the regular understudy from the New York company until Elsie de Wolfe recovered. Richard realized that this development would do nothing to repair the damage he had done, and argued that Mabel be permitted to continue. “It’s no use, Dick,” said the stage manager. “She’d ruin our next week’s business in Philadelphia.” Once she was fired, Mabel packed up and returned to New York, to begin rehearsals for Miss Hobbs. When Richard finally reached her on the telephone at the Morrison home in Peekskill, he got an icy reception: “I will not say that I do not care for you. . . . But you have your own idea and I have mine. You stand between me and success. I am tired of living in reflected glory. I never want to see you again.” And she hung up. As the tour continued, Richard wrote daily to try to appease 28\n\n1900–1904 Mabel. She answered him with silence. By October 1904, he was convinced that the battle had been lost and that he would have to get along without her. As the tour was about to end, he decided to seek out Mabel and divorce her for desertion. He was just about to leave for New York when a telegram arrived: “PLEASE COME TO FLAT B AT 457 WEST 123 STREET NEW YORK IMMEDIATELY.” When he reached the apartment, a red-headed Irish maid answered the door. Richard was attempting to explain who he was and why he’d come when he heard a baby crying in the next room. There, in a bed behind a screen, lay Mabel. Richard knelt by the bed, kissing Mabel again and again, and after a few moments they had forgiven each other and admitted that their behavior had been willful and thoughtless. Only then did Richard ask if he had a son or a daughter. “I knew you’d want a boy . . . but it’s a girl, dear,” replied Mabel. “She seems to have your spirit, though.” Mabel’s pregnancy had been a little under two months along when she was fired from The Other Girl. Once a doctor confirmed her condition, she had kept it a secret from Richard, not knowing whether or not she wanted to remain married to him. Once the baby arrived, however, Mabel decided that the burden of raising a child on her own was too much, and sent for her errant husband. Richard leaned over and looked into the bassinet. His newborn daughter was red-faced, screaming away with her fists clenched. She was carrying on so ferociously that Richard at first thought something might be wrong with her, but Mabel assured him, “She is her father’s own daughter. . . . She wants attention, dear.” Richard moved into the apartment with Mabel and their new daughter, whom they named Constance Campbell Bennett. The choice of “Campbell” was a nod to Mabel’s grandmother, Sarah Campbell. The wife of William F. Wood, Sarah had been a successful actress and dancer in her own right. Before she was old enough to have any say in the matter, Constance Bennett was being pointed toward an actor’s life.\n\n29\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n1904–1914\n\nChapter Three\n\n1904–1914 ⟈ Throughout her career, Constance Bennett delighted in confusing the public, friends, and even family about the exact year of her birth. She carried it to extremes, as if it were somehow a point of honor. After they had both become successful Hollywood stars, Joan often remarked that Constance had started out the oldest sister, moved into middle position, and wound up the youngest. In an effort to publicize her tempestuous nature, Constance always claimed to have been born during a thunderstorm, and it is true that New York was hit with heavy rains the day she was born, October 22, 1904, five days before the opening of the city’s subway system. She was an energetic, robust, and healthy baby. As her first summer arrived, Richard and Mabel decided to remove their nine-month-old daughter from the stifling heat in New York, and rented a cottage on a Staten Island beach. Constance spent much of her time outside and immediately took to the sunshine and fresh air. Richard had little difficulty finding work, going from one play to another, continually polishing his technique. Then, unexpectedly, Mabel stepped out of the reflected glory that she had lived in for most of her professional life. She was selected to portray the Indian girl Nat-u-ritch in Edwin Milton Royle’s The Squaw Man. It was one of the colorful, romantic, outdoor dramas of the period that found favor with audiences: Jim Carston, an English aristocrat, flees his country after becoming involved in a scandal. He 31\n\nThe Bennetts sails to America, where he settles out west and promptly makes an enemy of the vicious desperado Cash Hawkins (played by future silent film star William S. Hart). Just as Hawkins is about to kill Jim, Nat-u-ritch, daughter of an Indian chief, shoots him. Overcome by gratitude, Jim marries Nat-u-ritch and she bears him a son. When she realizes that she stands in the way of Jim returning to England and claiming an Earldom, she commits suicide. The Squaw Man opened at Wallack’s Theatre, where Mabel’s mother, Rose, had enjoyed so many of her successes. The New York Times reported that the characters were “never burlesque, even in the comedy scenes, and the play runs through its four acts without a drag. . . . Miss Mabel Morrison as a squaw—a difficult and trying role—won immediate recognition.” The Squaw Man was one of the big hits of the season, running for 222 performances. It would be revived in road productions for years to come, and later made into an important silent film by Cecil B. DeMille and Oscar Apfel. Having a personal triumph of her own meant that Mabel was for the time being much easier to live with. Nevertheless, the notion of his wife having a career was far from settled in Richard’s mind, and he was no doubt delighted when, a few months into the run of The Squaw Man, she discovered that she was pregnant again. Eventually Mabel was forced to give notice, and she settled down to await the baby’s arrival. She missed going to the theater every night, but she felt a definite satisfaction that her point had been made: namely, that she had no intention of abandoning the stage. Surely, now that she had made a hit in The Squaw Man, there would be more offers, and better ones. Meanwhile, Frohman had a hot property lined up for Richard, Charles Klein’s The Lion and the Mouse. A biting comedydrama, it hinted at the sort of changes that would gradually reshape the American theater. The plot concerns a spirited young woman (played by Grace Elliston) whose father, a respectable judge (Walter Allen), has been discredited professionally by a wealthy magnate (Edmund Breese). The woman, under an assumed name, strikes up a relationship with the millionaire’s son (Richard) and infiltrates the household for the purpose of laying hands on the papers that 32\n\n1904–1914 will clear her father’s name. The Lion and the Mouse was one of a number of “problem plays” that were cropping up sporadically in New York—plays in which a conventional love story might be wrapped up in some trenchant observations about the social, political, or economic realities of modern life. Although Richard had the third part in The Lion and the Mouse, Frohman felt it would give an important boost to his career. The producer believed passionately in the script, and he urged Richard to remember that he was surrounding him with a good cast. “You always want to take that into consideration,” Frohman cautioned him. “No matter how good your part is, if you are in a bad play with a poor cast, just throw the whole thing aside.” Frohman’s judgment turned out to be excellent, and the critics heaped praise on the play. Charles W. Collins of the Chicago Tribune found it “a new kind of play . . . with the inevitable love story based on expositions of questions which are compelling the American people to think.” The Lion and the Mouse was one of the runaway successes of the 1905–1906 season, lasting for 586 performances, over twice as long as David Belasco’s big hit, The Girl of the Golden West. With Mabel appearing in The Squaw Man, the Bennetts had a two-hit household, and it was one of the happiest times of their marriage. By the time he acted in The Lion and the Mouse, Richard had developed a specific method of working that he would employ throughout his stage career. He would go through the play learning all the other roles before attempting to memorize his own lines. He edged into his characterization very slowly, as if he were afraid that he might misjudge some facet of it and not be able to correct his mistakes. Gradually, his performance revealed itself to him and to his fellow actors. More than anything, Richard believed that the theater had the potential to depict reality, and this conviction helped him develop his signature style: a fresh naturalism, underscored by the power and presence that he had taken from the earlier generation of actors he admired—the Keans and Jeffersons and Marlowes. During the run of The Lion and the Mouse, the Bennetts moved briefly to an apartment at 1020 Longwood Avenue in the Bronx. 33\n\nThe Bennetts They didn’t stay long. Certain that The Lion and the Mouse would prove equally popular in London, Frohman arranged for a production at the Duke of York’s Theatre with several members of the New York company, Richard included. At this point, Richard became overconfident. Since Mabel was pregnant again, he wanted to see her comfortably settled, and rented a pleasant house in St. John’s Wood. The family sailed for England in the spring of 1906 on the S.S. Baltic, and Constance took her first steps on board the ship. The London experience was a grave disappointment. When The Lion and the Mouse opened at the Duke of York’s Theatre in May 1906, the English critics flayed it. The Times of London sneered, “Mr. Richard Bennett, in the rather thankless part of Jefferson, is one of the neat, round-faced boys with sweet expressions whom America often send us.” At the end of three weeks, the company was notified that the play would close. Having paid three months’ rent in advance on the house in St. John’s Wood, Richard was devastated. He complained so bitterly that the play’s company manager arranged to have him reimbursed for the house rental. The Bennetts sailed back to New York. With the new baby on the way, the apartment on Longwood Avenue would be much too small. They set about looking for a house to buy, and found one in Fort Lee, New Jersey, just across the Hudson River from Manhattan. The house was in a section known as Palisade, a newly developed enclave of Fort Lee, made up of a post office, school, and little more than a dozen houses. The southernmost section of Fort Lee, Palisade adjoined Cliffside Park and the Palisades Amusement Park. Later, in their official biographies, Richard and his daughters would refer to this residence as being in “Palisade, New Jersey,” which is a little like substituting Park Slope for Brooklyn. No doubt Palisade was chosen because it sounded more glamorous than Fort Lee. The Bennetts moved into their new home at 1074 Dearborn Road, which they christened “Benn-Morr,” on July 23, 1906. The month of August brought a number of changes to the family’s life. On August 13, Richard and Mabel’s second child, Barbara Jane 34\n\n1904–1914 Bennett, was born, at the house in Palisade. Five days later, Lewis Morrison died, following complications from stomach surgery. On the advice of the physician who delivered Barbara, Richard didn’t tell Mabel about her father’s death for a few days, and managed to keep the newspapers and telegrams of condolence away from her until she had gained back some of her strength. The third major event was the opening of Richard’s new play, Henry Arthur Jones’s The Hypocrites, at the Hudson Theatre on August 30. His leading lady was Doris Keane, then near the beginning of an important starring career. For his performance as a man engaged to a rich girl who gets a poor girl pregnant, and then tries to wriggle out of his responsibility, the New York Times wrote, “Richard Bennett merits more praise than time or space will permit. . . .” The next few months passed calmly enough. By the time Barbara was weaned, however, Richard and Mabel faced another stormy period in their marriage. Months of enforced inactivity had only strengthened Mabel’s determination to continue with her stage career as soon as she was able. Having learned nothing from his previous battles with his wife over her career, Richard once again stated his objections. He had hoped that after Barbara’s arrival, Mabel would resign herself to being a housewife and mother. Since that was not yet the case, perhaps yet another baby would do the trick. Much as he loved Barbara, he longed for a son; if Mabel were to become pregnant again, he might get his wish. So he began a campaign to persuade her that pursuing a career made her an unfit mother and that she had no business continuing to act; her place was at home with her babies. Generally, Mabel was not given to great emotional displays; if she had been, it is doubtful that her marriage to Richard could have survived for a single year. But she was far from being a pushover. When Richard attempted to use his repertoire of intimidation tricks, her response was a quiet aggression that could become downright unnerving. In this particular instance, she coolly reminded him of her family’s 120 years in the theater, and insisted that she was not about to abandon her calling to stay at home and play house. They found themselves at another impasse, and Richard 35\n\nThe Bennetts decided to seek counsel from Charles Frohman. The producer brought him up short by telling him that he felt Mabel had a bright future in the theater, and went so far as to suggest that she join the touring company of The Hypocrites, playing the role created by Doris Keane. Hearing his mentor assume the voice of reason finally led Richard to acquiesce, provided that they take Constance and Barbara along with them. By this time, the enormous difference in the girls’ personalities was becoming apparent. Constance, once she had learned to talk, did so unceasingly. A headstrong, energetic tomboy, she showed a marked degree of independence at an early age. She hated being fawned over by adults, even her parents, and would frequently squirm out of an enveloping embrace and skitter away “with the affection of a cockroach,” as Richard observed. While Constance seemed to throw tantrums for the pure satisfaction of it, Barbara was shy and introverted, and much easier to handle. The tour of The Hypocrites proved a trying time for both Richard and Mabel. Richard was still uncomfortable with the idea of his wife traveling with him. His resentment of her career ambitions was one issue, but there were other complications: Mabel’s presence on tour made it difficult for him to go on drinking sprees and arrange liaisons with other women, two of his greatest pleasures in being on the road. As the tour wore on, tension between the couple built once more. Richard began to imagine that Mabel’s quiet wilfulness was robbing him of all his natural rights as a husband and father. It seemed to him that he possessed no authority whatsoever in household matters, and he even began to entertain the paranoid fantasy that Constance and Barbara had fixed on their mother as the emotional center of their lives, regarding him as a mere interloper. Richard continued appearing in plays at a steady rate. His status as a Frohman leading man guaranteed him a certain job security, but he was starting to feel restless. He simply wasn’t advancing at the rate he had once hoped. In June 1907, he was back in London at the Duke of York’s Theatre, appearing with Grace George in a revival of Victorien Sardou’s comedy Divorçons, which proved altogether a happier experience than The Lion and the Mouse 36\n\n1904–1914 the previous year. Richard then appeared in a play called Twenty Days in the Shade, which played for sixty-four performances. He didn’t want to do his next play, Cicely Hamilton’s Diana of Dobson’s, starring Carlotta Neilson. He loathed his role of a “sillyassed Englishman.” Rehearsals were difficult, with the director correcting Richard on every move, every line reading. Richard noticed that Charles Frohman was breaking his usual pattern of being an invisible presence during the rehearsal period; the producer frequently showed up at the theater, and seemed to be studying Richard carefully. A week after Diana of Dobson’s opened, Richard experienced a first: he was fired. He flew into a panic. It was the middle of the season, and with most of the other big plays already cast, he had no idea how he was going to support his family. Frohman sent for him, and when Richard reported to his office, the producer told him that he had a new part lined up for him. As he passed the contract to Richard, he hinted that it was the choice role of the season and would automatically elevate him to stardom. There had been some opposition to Richard playing the part, but Frohman assured him that everything would be all right; Richard should go home, read the contract, sign it, and—above all—not worry. Richard did as he was told, but he was troubled that the contract mysteriously avoided mentioning a specific role. Weeks went by, and he came no closer to learning which part he had committed to play. He took Mabel, Constance, and Barbara to Peaks Island, Maine, for part of the summer. One day, Mabel rushed up, holding a copy of the New York Times. In it was an item announcing that Richard would be Maude Adams’s leading man in her next play, J.M. Barrie’s What Every Woman Knows. Frohman had already sent the play on a lengthy U.S. tour, with Hilda Trevelyan and Gerald Du Maurier. Now that it was ready for Broadway, he decided to relaunch it as a deluxe vehicle for Adams. Richard could scarcely believe his good fortune as rehearsals began in October 1908. Frohman prescribed an unusual method of rehearsing his casts: there was no initial reading; the actors simply milled about the stage, scripts in hand, prompted only by occa37\n\nThe Bennetts sional suggestions from the stage manager, until the play slowly began to take shape for them. “It was worse than army drill,” Richard observed, “ . . . you just moved about until the light of comprehension burst forth upon you.” Maude Adams didn’t appear until the fourth day of rehearsals. Never before had he worked with a star of her magnitude. Watching her step onto the stage and hearing the warm sincerity of her greeting to the company, Richard knew in an instant that he had reached a high-water mark. “A small-town, midwest country boy,” he recalled, “ . . . sans education, except such as I had gleaned from my choice of reading . . . now the leading man of Maude Adams, America’s greatest boxoffice draw, under the management of the great Charles Frohman. It was almost too much to believe.” By the time she appeared in What Every Woman Knows, Maude Adams was already the most celebrated actress in America. At the time, it was estimated that she played each year to approximately a half million people, and earned twice the salary of Pres. Theodore Roosevelt. Petite and serene-looking, she was far from beautiful, yet her fame had far outdistanced many of her more glamorous contemporaries. Her mother, Annie Adams, had been a leading lady in stock companies throughout the United States, and Maude had made her first stage appearance when she was only nine months old, in The Lost Child. She made her adult debut at fifteen, and four years later was engaged to support John Drew in a string of plays, including The Masked Ball and The Bauble Shop. One evening, a young Scot visiting the United States caught her opposite Drew in a performance of Rosemary and was so taken by her subtle charm and poetic grace that he set about dramatizing his novel The Little Minister for her. The play opened at the Empire Theatre in 1897, and Adams, in the role of Lady Babbie, suddenly found herself an important star. James M. Barrie figured in her career from then on. In 1905, his Peter Pan became her most successful vehicle ever. However textured her characterizations were, Adams usually conveyed a plainness and gentleness onstage; in this respect, Helen Hayes was probably her natural successor. One writer observed of 38\n\n1904–1914 Adams, “Probably it is true that her art is limited in scope. Horror and the notes of tragedy she does not awaken. She has no grasp of the fierce elemental passions of animal sex. To depict those things does not interest her. The fountain head of her personality is nunlike and virginal.” What Every Woman Knows is the story of Maggie, a plain Scottish girl whose brothers long to see her married. The play’s most memorable speech comes early in the first act. When asked by one of the other characters, “What is charm, exactly, Maggie?” Maggie replies: Oh, it’s—it’s a sort of bloom on a woman. If you have it, you don’t need anything else; and if you don’t have it, it doesn’t much matter what else you have. Some women, the few, have charm for all; and most have charm for one. But some have charm for none. Maggie sees herself as one who has “charm for none.” But her brothers strike a bargain with an ambitious but poor young man named John Shand: if he will marry Maggie, they will finance his education to the tune of £300. Both Maggie and John agree to the arrangement. Six years go by, and John has completed his schooling and run successfully for Parliament—and become arrogant and self-absorbed in the process. Maggie tells him that he need not be bound by his promise, and he nearly leaves her for a glamorous rival. But in the end, he realizes that he will not be half the man he can be without Maggie at his side. As she explains to him, “It’s nothing unusual I’ve done, John. Every man who is high up loves to think that he has done it all himself, and the wife smiles, and lets it go at that. It’s our only joke. Every woman knows that.” For most of the actors in What Every Woman Knows, mastering the Scottish accents that the play required proved a daunting challenge. After several days of rehearsal, Richard found that most of the actors’ lines were so unintelligible that he couldn’t recognize his cues. He sprang into action, searching the piers around the Brooklyn Bridge until he found a longshoreman who was a native 39\n\nThe Bennetts Scot. He took him to a nearby bar and bought him one drink after another, listening to every nuance of the man’s speech until he felt he had mastered the tricky dialect. It was still much too guttural, and he knew that the audience would never be able to comprehend it, so he began to spend long hours talking with a Scottish actor in the cast named David Torrence, who had attended the University of Edinburgh and had only a moderate, upper-class accent. Richard practiced crossing the two dialects in various combinations until he finally came up with a sound that made him feel right as John Shand. As rehearsals progressed, What Every Woman Knows was developing into much more than a vehicle for Maude Adams. Richard’s characterization was probing, intelligent, and beautifully observed. His rich, deep voice had developed to the point where he could project it effortlessly, making it heard in every corner of the theater. Over the years, he had slowly learned one of the things that so many actors find difficult: how to listen. In rehearsals for What Every Woman Knows, it was clear that Richard had mastered the art of listening. His performances had always born the mark of his own naturally fiery personality, but as John Shand, his lyric quality was balanced by a greater sense of realism than he had ever shown before. Many of his most beautiful moments were silent ones. When the play opened at the Empire Theatre on December 23, 1908, it immediately became the hit of the season. Richard was singled out for praise by all the major critics. The New York Times wrote, “The triumph of the night was unquestionably Mr. Bennett’s. His Shand is a perfectly studied and delivered characterization. Its humor is irresistible. It has vigor, force, bluntness—all the qualities, in fact, which Mr. Barrie apparently seeks to show.” (The same critic found that Adams was occasionally “overwrought almost to the point of hysteria.”) Maggie’s “charm” speech was the season’s most-quoted piece of dialogue. The play even inspired a popular song, “What Every Woman Knows,” written by Walter Pulitzer and Eden E. Grenville. When What Every Woman Knows closed temporarily in the spring of 1909, Richard was still uneasy about the situation at home. He felt that he had not spent enough time with Constance and 40\n\n1904–1914 Barbara to establish a sound relationship with them, and he thought that Mabel had indulged them terribly, causing them to become lazy and self-centered. Because he was home with them so little, they frequently talked back to him or ignored him altogether. Now that he was a bona fide Broadway star, he began to exert his will at home more than he had in the past. He persuaded Mabel to join her brother Victor on a trip to Europe, so that he could enjoy some time alone with the girls. During Mabel’s two-month sojourn, Richard finally took the opportunity to break his daughters of some of the bad habits they had developed. Constance, being much more willful and headstrong than Barbara, posed a greater challenge. When she couldn’t get her way, Constance was given to shutting herself up in her bedroom and banging her head on the floor repeatedly. But after two months of orders barked at her day and night, even she began to show a degree of respect for him. At last, he made his presence felt as head of the household. His time alone with the girls produced enduring results with Constance. For most of her life she would feel a profound attachment to her father. Barbara continued to be fearful of his brazen, egocentric personality, but Constance was alternately unfazed and delighted by it. After Mabel’s return from Europe, Richard went to Los Angeles for a season with Oliver Morosco’s stock company. It was a golden time for stock companies in California: the silent movie industry was taking off, and struggling actors had discovered that playing in stock made an excellent springboard for getting into motion pictures. Richard’s fellow actors at Morosco that season included three future movie names: Charles Ruggles, Harold Lloyd, and Fay Bainter. In the fall of 1909, he returned to New York, where What Every Woman Knows was picking up again after the summer layoff. Just as rehearsals were beginning, Mabel told Richard that she was expecting another child. Certain that this time Mabel would give birth to a son, Richard chose the name John— after John Shand. Once again he was disappointed. On February 27, 1910, Joan Geraldine Bennett was born at home in New Jersey. Richard, who was appearing in What Every Woman Knows in Bangor, Maine, 41\n\nThe Bennetts left the company after a Saturday night performance, took an overnight train to New York, and made it to Palisade by Sunday morning. It was a brief meeting; he had to leave almost immediately for the play’s Chicago opening, after which the company would travel to the West Coast. It was nearly five months before he was able to return home for his second glimpse of Joan: “She was lying in her baby carriage on the verandah, looking as beautiful as the rose in the sun, at which she was cooing. She has always been that little rosebud since.” Richard’s sadness at leaving the new baby behind was somewhat alleviated by the success of What Every Woman Knows on the road. It played to capacity houses at every stop on its long national tour. Professionally, Richard was flying high, but he was rapidly growing dissatisfied with his costar. Adams was constantly looking for little things that would improve the play—and Richard’s performance. Richard found her incessant tinkering annoying, and relations between them cooled as the tour progressed. In 1911, Adams starred in the title role of Edmond Rostand’s Chantecler, in which all the characters were barnyard animals. The part had been intended for Otis Skinner until Adams usurped it for herself. Richard sent her a telegram: “I CONGRATULATE YOU ON THE REALIZATION OF YOUR FONDEST AMBITION. AT LAST YOU ARE YOUR OWN LEADING MAN.” In the last years of his life, Richard would speak disparagingly of Adams, calling her “a very much overrated actress,” entirely dependent on Frohman’s judgment, and saying that when he died, she hadn’t the means or knowhow to continue acting. (In fact, Adams did retire from the stage a few years after Frohman’s death, returning only for two isolated engagements much later on.) For The Deep Purple, a melodrama by Paul Armstrong and Wilson Mizner, Frohman lent Richard to producer George C. Tyler. Rehearsals were hectic. The playwrights had heated battles both with Tyler and each other, and scene after scene was rewritten wholesale each day. At the end of three weeks, the script had metamorphosed into “a rather lively, moving melodrama” after its opening at the Lyric Theatre in January 1911. The Deep Purple not only marked Richard Bennett’s twenti42\n\n1904–1914 eth year in the theater but also, in a sense, was a benchmark in his career. Ever since What Every Woman Knows, he had been an established Frohman star, a favorite with critics, and a box-office draw. It was only natural, then, that he would now begin to exert some degree of control over the kind of plays in which he appeared, rather than merely accepting whatever role was offered him. Although he had received only a bare-bones education back home in Indiana, Richard possessed a drive and intellectual curiosity that grew in intensity each year. He continued to read voraciously; his beloved dictionary and thesaurus always within arm’s reach. As he went from play to play, he had formed the opinion that the theater might have the potential to do more than entertain. It might also be used as a means of reaching out to the public and educating them on subjects normally considered taboo. Richard’s attitude toward sex had always been colored by what would now be regarded as a double standard. He believed that sex was intended essentially for the pleasure of men, who by nature were driven to satisfy their appetite; women had to get used to the idea that the men they married would indulge in an occasional affair. Women, on the other hand, were hel"
