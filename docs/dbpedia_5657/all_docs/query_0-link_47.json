All Rights Reserved.\n\n1890 1891 1892 1893 1894 1895 1896 1897 1898 1899\n\n1890-1899 C.E.\n\nThe Gay Nineties Fin De Siecle Open Door Decade, or, How 'bout That Tiger? Since the coming MF-challenged year 1900 can't be the \"real\" Millennium, nobody's talking about Armageddon and everybody's talking about taming the tiger and advancing civilization, causing this decade to produce exciting scientific and technical leaps, incl. electricity, radio, automobiles and airplanes, and movies? Just when it all seems to be for the good (give or take an electric chair or two), X-rays and radioactivity are discovered and played around with a little too innocently, revealing the hidden horrors of scientific progress? France and England celebrate pure Wilde decadence along with Mary Cassatt innocence? A good decade for WWII generals and aircraft magnates to be born? A good decade for criminals and crime fighters named Holmes? The Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee Death Knell Decade for American Indian Independence? A good decade for Salisburys? A bad decade to be born if you don't want to be cannon fodder in WWI? A decade of way too many shipwrecks (16), sending a loud message that nobody hears?

Wells ramps up the white man's escapist genre of science-fiction so that white readers can feel far far away no matter how many Vs them darkies score on their sheets? The Vincent Van Gogh Wheat Field With Crows Year?\n\n1890 The 1889-1890 Flu Pandemic (Oct. 1889-Dec. 1890) rocks the planet, killing 1M worldwide. The Eleventh (11th) U.S. Census reports the total pop. as 62,947,714 (21.2 per sq. mi.); New York City: 1.341M; the German pop. of the U.S. is now at 2.8M, a majority within the German Triangle of Cincinnati, Milwaukee, and St. Louis; 75% of the pop. of Chicago are immigrants or children of immigrants, with Germans topping the list at 29%; since 1820 15.6M people have immigrated to the U.S. through New York Harbor and/or Ellis Island: 4.6M from Germany, 3.5M from Ireland, 2.5M from England, 0.9M from Norway-Sweden, 0.46M from Austria-Hungary, 0.41M from Italy, 0.37M from France, 0.36M from Russia-Poland, 0.33M from Scotland, 0.29M from China, 0.17M from Switzerland, 0.15M from Denmark, 1.03M from British North Am. possessions, 0.61M from all other countries; on apr. 18 the U.S. govt. assumes control of immigration, causing Congress to appropriate $75K to construct the first U.S. federal immigration station on Ellis Island, which originally were part of the Oyster Islands, called Gibbet Island in the 1760s, then acquired in the 1770s by merchant Sammuel Ellis, who leases it to the state of N.Y. in 1794. Beginning this year large numbers of Armenians (100K), Southern and Eastern Europeans begin migrating to the U.S., while other Armenians migrate to the Caucasus - it was worth it for John Belushi? The avg. height of urban U.S. men born this year is 1.5 in. shorter than those born in 1830, showing the dismal working and living conditions; it takes until 1920 to regain the stature. In this decade Paris enjoys the Belle Epoque (Fr. \"Beautiful Era\"), an era of elegance, fashion and gaiety (ends in 1914 with WWI). In this decade the City Beautiful Movement is launched in Chicago, Ill., spreading to Cleveland, Ohio, Detroit, Mich., and Washington, D.C., going on to be called an \"architectural design cult\" by Jane Jacobs. On Jan. 1 the first annual Rose (Tournament of Roses) Parade is held in Pasadena, Calif., where the weather is in the 70s even in winter; each float must be made entirely of organic (living) materials, with no artificial coloring; if New Year's Day falls on a Sun., the parade is held on Jan 2. On Jan. 2 steamship Persia sinks off Corsica, killing 130. On Jan. 11 after pressure from Cecil Rhodes, the 1890 British Ultimatum to Portugal demands the retreat of Portuguese military forces from their Pink (Rose-Colored) Map in Africa connecting their colonies of Angola and Mozambique, incl. modern-day Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Malawi; the spineless submission by Carlos I damages the monarchy and encourages the repub. movement.

Beason that federal laws against Islam, er, polygamy don't violate the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, with Justice Stephen J. Field writing the soundbytes: \"However free the exercise of religion may be, it must be subordinate to the criminal laws of the country, passed with reference to actions regarded by general consent as properly the subjects of punitive legislation\", and \"Swift punishment would follow the carrying into effect of its doctrines, and no heed would be given to the pretense that, as religious beliefs, their supporters could be protected in their exercise by the constitution of the United States.\" On Feb. 4 the U.S. House of Reps. passes the U.S. Exposition Bill authorizing Chicago to host a world's fair to honor the 400th anniv. of Columbus; it is signed on Apr. 25 by Pres.

Lyman Judson Gage (1836-1927) becomes pres. of the board of dirs., arranging the financing; former Chicago mayor (1879-87) Carter Henry Harrison Sr. (1825-93) steamrolls the women's societies and insures that every kind of sin will be in so that the filthy lucre will be made, then gets reelected in 1893 to be in for the fun; Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show gets banned but sets up outside the gates and makes a killing. On Feb. 9 the Weather Bureau (later the Nat. Weather Service) is created within the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture. On Feb. 17 British steamship Duburg sinks in the China Sea, killing 400. On Feb. 21 the First Franco-Dahomean War (ends Oct. 4) begins when the French arrest senior Fon officials in Cotonou and fortify the town, causing word to be sent to Abomey, which sends a force of several thousand, resulting in the 4-hour Battle of Cotonou on Mar. 4 (5:00 a.m.-9:00 a.m.), which is a V for the French, who chase them N assisted by warriors from the Kingdom of Porto-Novo, who are routed, then chase the French back to Porto-Novo; on Oct. 3 Dahomey signs a treaty recognizing Porto-Novo as a French protectorate, and cedes Cotonou in return for 20K francs/year; too bad, another war is simmering. On Feb. 22 (2:00 a.m.) the Walnut Grove Dam in NC Ariz. (begun 1886) collapses shortly after being completed, sending 4B gal. of water down the Hassayampa River, killing 70; shoddy construction is blamed, and the dam designer is found to have no civil engineering training. On Feb. 28 British steamship RMA Quetta hits rocks in the Lorres Straits on the Far North Queensland coast of Australia and sinks, killing 134 of 292 aboard, becoming Queensland's worst maritime accident (until ?).

On Mar. 8 N.D. State U. in Fargo is founded. On Mar. 11 U.S. Rep. (D-Ky.) (1885-9) William Preston Taulbee (b. 1851) is shot on the E staircase of the House wing of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. by newspaper correspondent Charles E. Kincaid, dying later that day at Providence Hospital; blood stains are visible to modern times. On Mar. 18 Kaiser (since 1888) Wilhelm II (probably from jealousy?) forces chancellor (since 1871) Otto von Bismarck (1815-98) to resign, and on Mar. 20 replaces him with Count Georg Leo von Caprivi (1831-99) (until Oct. 26, 1894), making a choice of someone who's ignorant of foreign affairs to take over foreign policy himself, with Friedrich August Karl Ferdinand Julius von Holstein (1837-1909) becoming head of the German Foreign Office (until 1906); Bismarck goes into retirement in Friedrichsruh (20 mi. SE of Hamburg) with the title of duke of Lauenberg, issuing the soundbyte: \"The Kaiser is like a balloon: if you don't keep hold of the string, you never know where he'll be off to\"; Punch mag. pub. the famous cartoon Dropping the Pilot by Sir John Tenniel, which Germans eagerly adopt, titling it \"Der Lotse Geht von Bord\" (The Pilot Leaves the Ship); after the Kaiser visits England in the summer, the Russians and French start getting the idea that Germany is starting to form an entente against them with Britain, lubing the wheels leading to WWI? On Mar. 27 the 1890 Middle Mississippi Valley Tornado Outbreak sees an F4 tornado hit Louisville, Ky., killing 74-120, injuring 200, and causing $3M damage.

Harrison on July 2; only 18 antitrust cases are initiated by the underfunded U.S. Dept. of Justice in three admins. (Harrison 7, Cleveland 8, McKinley 3), and 4 of these are against labor unions. In Apr. the Thunderbird, an enormous flying creature with the body of a serpent, a 160-ft. wingspan, two clawed feet, and the face of an alligator is allegedly sighted by two cowboys in the Ariz. desert, who allegedly shoot and kill it, cut off a piece of the wing and bring it to Tombstone, Ariz., where the Tombstone Epigraph pub. an article about it in their Apr. 1892 issue - a hoax? On May 2 the U.S. Organic Act gives away the remainder of Oklahoma territory (the panhandle) to whites, creates the Oklahoma Territory, and officially declares the U.S. Frontier closed; on May 23 the city of Oklahoma City, Okla. (modern pop. 370K/640K), on the North Canadian River is incorporated; the U.S. now has four state capitals with \"City\" in their names: Jefferson City, Oklahoma City, Carson City, Kansas City - JOCK? On May 6 the Kaiser Wilhelm II addresses the opening of the Reichstag, mentioning the Triple Alliance between Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy, pissing-off the Russians and French; the Reichstag then passes an Army Law increasing the size by 18K men, really pissing them off, and causing mutual feelers to be put out via their military officers. On May 19 the U.S. Supreme (Fuller) Court rules in In re Kemmler that execution by electric chair does not violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, writing the soundbyte: \"If the punishment prescribed for an offense against the laws of the State were manifestly cruel and unusual as burning at the stake, crucifixion, breaking on the wheel, or the like, it would be the duty of the courts to adjudge such penalties to be within the constitutional prohibition\" - what's wrong with the original idea of trial by ordeal, and if God lets him off, that settles it? On May 19 the U.S. Supreme (Fuller) Court rules 6-3 in Late Corp. of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. United States to uphold the 1887 U.S. Edmunds-Tucker Act, disincorporating the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons); Justice Fuller dissents on the basis that \"it is not authorized under the cover of that power to seize and confiscate the property of persons, individuals, or corporations, without office found, because they may have been guilty of criminal practices\"; only $381,812 of $3M in assets are seized, and real property isn't touched because the church acts too fast to prohibit polygamy. On May 19 The Arizona Republic (originally \"The Arizona Republican\" until 1930) is founded in Phoenix, Ariz.; in 2000 it is acquired by Gannett, reaching a modern-day circ. of 321K daily and 538K Sun.

(IBEAC) is chartered to develop the Uganda area (until 1895); the whole thing causes Russia and France to believe that Germany is getting in bed with Britain against them, and must have gotten something under the sheets? - just move forward and let me do the mouse work? On June 29 U.S. Sen. (R-Mass.) (1893-1924) Henry Cabot Lodge Sr. (1850-1924) sponsors the U.S. Federal Elections (Force) Bill (Compromise of 1890), providing for federal protection of blacks trying to vote in federal elections; too bad, the Repubs. cop out and withdraw support in order to put money first and get the Sherman Silver Purchase Act and McKinley Tariff Act passed - is that the good side or the dark side of the Force? On July 1 the first Japanese gen. election for the Diet under the new constitution is held.

Euro investors concerned about the coup in Buenos Aires, leading to the Panic of 1893 - if they only new that Treasury silver is later used to produce the first atomic bomb? On July 17 British-born diamond magnate Cecil John Rhodes (1853-1902) becomes PM #7 of Cape Colony (until Jan. 12, 1896), going on to pursues a policy of \"painting the map red\", i.e., bringing all of Africa under British control, starting by passing the 18995 Glen Grey Act, limiting black vote via financial and educational qualifications, and sending a \"pioneer column\" of settlers and \"police\" into Zimbabwe (he'd prefer to call it Rhodesia?) between the Ndebele and Shona areas; meanwhile the African natives begin to suffer a series of ecological crises such as drought, locusts, and rinderpest (cattle disease) (until 1906).

Benjamin Harrison on Jan. 4, 1893 to issue a Presidential Proclamation granting the 2,451 Mormon plural families in the U.S. amnesty from the 1882 federal anti-polygamy law; that doesn't stop a lot of renegade Mormons from doing it anyway (50K in the year 2000); Congress rejects the name Deseret (\"land of honeybees\") (taken from the Book of Mormon) (in ancient Egypt, Kenet meant black land, i.e., fertile land, and Deseret meant red land, i.e., the desert), preferring Utah, from a Navajo word meaning upper, after the Shoshone Ute tribe; actually, Woodruff didn't prohibit polygamy per se, only \"contracting any marriage forbidden by the law of the land\", meaning that it it still okay for church members when and where it is legal? On Sept. 25 after the U.S. Forestry Movement shifts its emphasis from saving trees to the promotion of scientific forest mgt., the U.S. Congress creates Sequoia Nat.

English nurse-missionary Kate Marsden (1859-1931) is sent by Tsarina Maria Fedorovna on a 2K-mi. journey across Siberia to find a fabled herb that cures leprosy, which turns out not to work; too bad, when she returns, the Victorian establishment hounds her for lesbianism instead of praising her for heroism.
