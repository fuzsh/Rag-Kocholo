        "text": "When we think of filmmaking, we picture directors like Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, or James Cameron and imagine blockbuster movies with million dollar budgets. The reality is that all the big names in Hollywood started somewhere, and it’s an eye-opening experience learning about their journey, especially when they’re on mission to change lives through film.\n\nKindred Image is an LA-based production company already making a splash in the industry with their documentary The Drop Box, a documentary about a South Korean man who created a drop off place for abandoned babies to get a second chance at life.\n\nThese men are living Urbane + Gallant lives, and we had the opportunity to sit down with them to discuss film and masculinity. Continue reading\n\nWith every breakthrough, there’s a story behind it, and this couldn’t be any truer for Los Angeles-based ensemble, Run River North (RRN).\n\nRRN started small playing for a few hometown shows in LA and encountered the typical difficulties any band experiences trying to make a living with music. In these situations, you get creative to build content that brings exposure. The music video “Fight to Keep” they recorded in their Hondas went viral, and Honda surprised them with a performance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!\n\nThanks to the big break, RRN signed with Nettwerk Music Group in 2013 and released their self-titled debut album this past February working alongside producer Phil Ek (Band of Horses, Fleet Foxes, Built to Spill, The Shins). Since then, they’ve been touring, performing at LA’s famed Troubadour, New York City’s Rockwood Music Hall, and at SXSW. They joined the Goo Goo Dolls for their acoustic spring tour while also playing their own headline shows in Boston, New York, DC, Atlanta, and Philadelphia.\n\nThey are phenomenal musicians, but we wanted to learn more about the people behind the music and the impact they want to make through their work. That’s what Urbane + Gallant is about, and we want to highlight men who are on mission. We got the opportunity to sit down with John Chong, RRN’s drummer, after they got back from their tour. He spoke personally and was not speaking on behalf of the rest of the band. Continue reading\n\nWe are excited to announce that the “Urbane + Gallant in Action” series will be coming soon. We will feature men who are striving to live the Urbane + Gallant lifestyle. You will get to hear their story and also see The Wilberforce and other future Urbane + Gallant products being worn on these men. Get ready to see men on mission."
