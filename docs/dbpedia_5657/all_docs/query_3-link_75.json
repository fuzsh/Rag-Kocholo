        "text": "Who knew a product I saw on TikTok a few years ago would lead to this… ? 🤯 3 years ago I came across a video of someone that bought a Paper Shoot Camera 🇨🇦 🇺🇸 🇬🇧 in Taiwan while travelling, and shared it on TikTok. My partner and I had just pivoted our careers due to COVID and were at the beginning of our e-commerce journey. Seeing a product that had that viral element, and realizing nobody in North America was selling it - we knew we had to jump on it. Securing exclusive distribution rights, we put all our efforts into building the brand in the North American market. That decision has taken us all over the world, allowed us to build out an amazing team, and expand our company in ways we could never have imagine. Opportunity is everywhere. Be open minded, take chances and ask for what you want. Not every accomplishment as a business owner comes with a plaque so this is pretty cool, thanks Shopify ! #shopifyseller #brand #ecommerce #founder #amazon\n\nGood content creators are hard to find. There has been this misconception online that being a UGC creator is an easy, low effort job. \"I make $15,000 per month and only work 10 hours a week\" It's become a trend to use some form of this as a hook when talking about content creation. Which attracts the people that want to do very little work, with a huge payout. So places like Upwork & Fiverr are flooded with UGC creators that don't see have the vision and dedication to make a difference in a company. We're expanding our organic content - not only for our brand but we're bringing on more brands that can use the help finding those diamonds in the rough that make a difference in their social media presence. For content creators in the Houston,TX area we have a job posting here: https://lnkd.in/ggPi5dns For brands that want to take their content creation to the next level (paper shoot camera got 13.8 million organic impressions in the past 30 days) - send me a DM. From brand owner to brand owner, I want to help. #contentcreator #hiring #contentcreation #ugccontent #socialmediamarketing #organiccontent\n\nBy FAR my biggest weakness as a leader is... Being too lenient. I don't want to create an environment where anyone is overwhelmed, overworked, can't take breaks or time off etc. If you miss a deadline because you were sick, or your dog was sick, or whatever it may be - I always work around to accommodate you. But not being firm enough in our business processes - can tip the scale in the other direction. And can create a divide in your team culture.. 👉 Missed deadlines mean other team members work is delayed, which causes them frustration. 👉 Copious amounts of time off for a single team member causes resentment by the team members that DO show up every day. 👉 Remote team members not online during company hours makes getting in touch with them hard for your whole team It is such a balance between being an understanding boss, to creating a team culture that doesn't respect the policies we have in place. I truly struggle with that. I always think of the human first. Which sounds like a great thing - but the ripple effect doesn't always end up that way. What are your leadership weaknesses? #leadership #entrepreneur\n\nI have a love / hate relationship with networking events. I love them because I get so inspired by meeting other business owners, talking ideas, struggles, new ventures. It's a whirlwind of incredible talks with incredible people. 🤩 ... but then reality hits when you get back home. The world you escaped from for a week is still waiting for you. As a business owner, my mind constantly wants to wander for the new, shiny project. These events fuel these thoughts even more. I'll walk away from an event with 5 more business ventures. I can't stop myself. 🤣 But with an already overflowing plate, I don't have time to do it all. (anyone looking to partner in some business ventures?) Ship Bob's Fulfilled 2024 event was amazing. What a solid company, great values and growth trajectory. #fulfilled2024 #networkingevent #entrepreneurs\n\nI've lost over 2 million dollars in the last 6 months... 😭 Last August, Amazon shut down my selling accounts. And no, we didn't do any sort of sketchy business practices. It all boils down to my partner's name... My partner has gone by his middle name all his life. Some documents (such as his passport) has his full legal name on it, and some documents (such as our business licence and his credit card) has his middle name on it. Apparently that has flagged \"fraud\" in their system. 😩 Months and months of trying to explain this. Getting our lawyer to change our business documents to have his name match everywhere. Hiring a number of agency's to represent us in our appeal. Nothing has worked. They have officially stopped replying to us. But the one thing I am thankful for through all of this, is that our business did not rely on Amazon. We have built a strong brand, and the majority of our sales has always been on our website. This could have bankrupted us if Amazon was our main source of revenue. Leaving myself and my team without jobs. While I appreciate the security precautions Amazon has in place to protect their customers - when they falsely shut down a reputable business, it opened my eyes to not having all your eggs in one basket if you're looking to build an e-commerce brand. #eccommerce #brand #amazon #founder #eccom\n\nA few days late but reflecting on 2023 - this year was a year full of challenges, lessons learned but a whole lot of fun along the way. 🙌 January - We visited our partners in Taiwan for the first time. February - We took our team to Mexico for a team trip. March - We attended SXSW and sold out of our cameras & made lots of cool connections. April - We got invited to Coachella by American Express to be a part of their AMEX experience May - I visited family & made some connections in the UK June - We collaborated with Focus Features on their film release of Asteroid City & sold out of our exclusive product drop in 3 minutes! July - enjoyed some summer time with my family (can’t work all the time). August - We hosted our Taiwanese partners in Canada & attended a trade show in NYC September - We attended our first European trade show in Paris. October - We attend Austin City Limits with American Express again! November - We had record breaking month of sales with a successful BFCM December - Closed the year strong & celebrated with loved ones. What was your favourite part of 2023? And what are you looking forward to in 2024!?\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with me. I’ll admit, I am guilty of saying things like: “I’m unorganized” “I get overwhelmed easily” “I can't handle it” But I’ve come to realize that sometimes the expectations I put on myself, are beyond what’s reasonably attainable. It’s ok to be ambitious in your career / life, but be reasonable about it. I guess what I’m saying is, don’t set yourself up to fail then put yourself down for it when it inevitably happens. ❤️"
