Reviewing what we had in our inventory, we realized most of these performers were now gone and that the conversations we had with them should be part of their luminous legacy as icons of film history. That’s when we first began to envision combining our interviews for a book that would preserve them for generations of film lovers as a valuable work of oral history. Our notion, using our original tape recordings and written notes, was to re-create the atmosphere of the interviews, describing the conditions under which we met and talked with the stars. These are not reprints of the articles as they originally appeared. We have presented the interviews in a format that expands and enhances them beyond their original presentation in newspapers and magazines. In every case, they’ve been expanded and updated, covering what took place in each actor’s life after we talked. All the interviews included in this book were conducted face-to-face; we have not included press conferences that we attended with the stars. In a few cases, both of us had done separate interviews with the same stars, so we have merged those encounters to enrich the overall content while retaining our separate comments on how our individual chats took place. From the start, we knew we wanted to do this book together because we share a love of classic movies and knew that our approach is basically the same: to accurately reflect the personality of the star and to encourage him or her to take us behind the scenes for the real story of how they made their great films. We sincerely believe that the stars of Hollywood’s golden era were a different breed. Most came into movies while the so-called studio system 1\n\nConversations w ith classic film stars\n\nheld sway. In the golden age of the 1930s, 1940s, and early 1950s, movie stars were groomed carefully by the studios. Some actors had already established public personas if they came from Broadway, radio, or the music business. Irene Dunne, for instance, had starred on Broadway and Gene Autry was a singing star on radio. But most were retrained by their studios, which put them into a variety of roles in B movies or in smaller parts in A movies, a reliable way to discover if they had the appeal to become leading actors. Actors of the golden age had to be pretty versatile if they hoped to survive. The studio might put you on a horse to see if you could handle the lead in a western. Or it might have you sing or dance to see if you could carry a role in a musical. Jane Wyman, for instance, worked in lots of silly comedies and musicals before she was deemed ready for the dramatic roles that made her a major star in The Lost Weekend and Johnny Belinda. Joan Fontaine was given a showcase role as Fred Astaire’s dancing partner in a musical, though she would gain fame as a dramatic actress. And so on. Of course, when the studio finally figured out the groove it deemed right for an actor, that often meant the actor was typecast, perhaps having to risk suspension for a chance to rise out of that studio-determined persona. In our chats with these stars, you can learn a lot about the old studio system by reading between the lines, picking up on their common frustration with the conduct of their careers under studio rule. Austrian Luise Rainer, for instance, rebelled against the trivial roles she was given by MGM even after winning back-to-back Academy Awards. When her marriage also began to fall apart, she left Hollywood for good and virtually retired from movies. However, they weren’t all miserable—and you’ll sense that, too, as you listen to them talk to us in their own words, not the words put into their mouths by studio publicists. As the 1950s wore on, the pervasive new competition from television, the antitrust rulings that forced studios to sell their movie theaters, the rising influence of powerful talent agencies, and the growing strength of the craft unions fostered an economic crisis for the studios, forcing them to jettison most of the exclusive star contracts they had held for a generation. In putting this collection together, we have for the most part chosen wide-ranging interviews that give us a picture of the star’s whole career. 2\n\nIntroduction\n\nBut we’ve also included some that, although less comprehensive, offer some rare insight into a star’s life. We also highlight some character actors who almost always played supporting parts in movies and seldom saw their names above the film’s title. The great Chinese American actor Keye Luke’s memories throw an important light on the experiences of ethnic minorities during Hollywood’s golden age. We wanted also to celebrate the rich contributions of beloved character players like Margaret Hamilton, the unforgettable Wicked Witch of the West in the Land of Oz as well as the talents of B players like Audrey Totter and Marie Windsor, whose work is praised even more today than it was in their working years. James and I have been friends and colleagues for more than forty years, though we come from different nations and wrote for quite different newspapers. But we share a deep love of movies and a respect for the great creative people who combine their diverse talents to make them. We hope you will enjoy these samplings from our combined archives of memories. Perhaps they will enrich your own memories of these truly great performers.\n\n3\n\nI The Silent Era\n\nJackie Coogan Interview by Ron Miller The greatest and most memorable of the silent movie child stars was surely Jackie Coogan. Charlie Chaplin discovered him performing onstage at the Orpheum Theater in Los Angeles. Noticing the boy was a natural-born mimic, Chaplin cast him—at age five—in a small part in A Day’s Pleasure (1919). The boy glowed on camera, so Chaplin put him into his 1921 feature film The Kid and Jackie became an overnight sensation in one of Chaplin’s biggest hits. Director Frank Lloyd quickly capitalized on Coogan’s international fame, casting him in the title role of Oliver Twist in 1922. As Coogan’s winsome appeal continued to grow, he eventually became the centerpiece of a whole new Hollywood approach to child stardom. He became the first child star to get the full product-marketing treatment: dolls, figurines, whistles, recordings, and even a brand of peanut butter bore his image, usually wearing a large cap and a sad-eyed expression. The marketing boom for Shirley Temple a decade later was modeled on the Coogan experience. Coogan also revolutionized legal treatment of the earnings of child stars. After he discovered that his mother and stepfather had usurped most of his earnings—an estimated $4 million, worth about $50 million in today’s dollars—the then twenty-four-year-old successfully sued them. He got only $126,000, all that remained from his parents’ spending spree, but the court case led to passage of the California Child Actors Bill, now commonly known as “the Coogan act,” which requires that a child actor’s employer must set aside 15 percent of his or her earnings in a trust account. The bill also set standards for work-hour limitations and required schooling for child actors. Once he grew out of the juvenile phase of his career, Coogan saw his popularity fade; he was no longer a headliner by the late 1930s. Coogan 7\n\nConversations w ith classic film stars\n\nJackie Coogan with Charles Chaplin in The Kid (1921). Courtesy of Thames Television.\n\nattended the University of Southern California and then Santa Clara University, but did not do well and never received a degree. In 1935, when Coogan was twenty, he barely survived a horrendous car crash near San Diego that killed his father and his good friend the child actor Junior Durkin. With his acting career stalled, Coogan enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1941, before the attack on Pearl Harbor. He transferred to the Army Air Force after the United States entered World War II and became a glider 8\n\nJackie Coogan\n\npilot. With the First Air Commando Group, he flew British troops on raids behind Japanese lines during the fighting in Burma. After the war, Coogan resumed his acting career, this time mostly in the new world of television. He landed the role of Stoney Crockett in the 1952‒1953 series Cowboy G-Men and appeared in a number of other TV roles, but he is best remembered by baby boomers as Uncle Fester, the ghoulishly funny character he played in ABC’s The Addams Family from 1964 to 1966. He appeared in many small roles in movies, including Elvis Presley’s Girl Happy (1965) and John Wayne’s Cahill, U.S. Marshal (1973). His final screen appearance in a movie was in 1984’s The Prey.\n\nSetting the Scene My chat with Jackie Coogan took place in April 1968 while he was playing the role of Boss Finley in a production of Tennessee Williams’s Sweet Bird of Youth in the round at Circle Star Theater in San Carlos, California. I joined him in his dressing room and we talked between his turns onstage with costar Shelley Winters. Our time was limited because he was doing his own makeup, which he did quietly and expertly while we talked. Coogan was then a little heavy and had a receding hairline. He was dressed in a bathrobe over a pair of polka-dot shorts. His face had a good many furrows and creases, but it still retained the look of that sad-eyed little boy adopted by Chaplin’s Little Tramp in The Kid. He was warm and friendly and often seemed to speak of the famous child star as if he had been someone else whom Coogan just happened to know. In the middle of our chat, Shelley Winters came into Coogan’s dressing room, heavily made up for her role as a dissipated former movie star, and remarked to me, “So, you’re interviewing him? Well, that’s good. He’s a hell of an actor!” I thought that assessment, coming from the two-time Academy Award‒winning actress, was a pretty good testament to Coogan’s enduring star quality.\n\nThe Interview Miller: The author Irvin S. Cobb once described you as “the blithest spirit that ever gave unending joy to countless millions.” How did it feel to be adored by “countless millions”? 9\n\nConversations w ith classic film stars\n\nCoogan [chuckling]: Maybe that’s why Lloyds of London insured me for $250,000 whenever I went on a trip. Stars were different then. There was no television, no radio. When a star showed up, the people turned out to see him—by the thousands. Miller: When you became a star, movies were silent, so there was no language barrier and people all over the world could see and appreciate what you did on-screen. As a little boy, did you realize you were world famous? Coogan: When I was around nine, I was taken on a trip to Europe. It wasn’t like a normal kid’s trip to Europe. I met heads of state. I was “received” by royalty. I exchanged photos with Benito Mussolini. I kissed the pope’s ring. Everywhere I went, I was mobbed by fans. I can remember being in a car in Paris when the mob nearly killed me. They picked up the whole car with us in it and paraded us down the street on their shoulders. Miller: What about back home in America? Could you go out and do things in public that a regular kid could do? Coogan: Once I made the mistake of going shopping with my mother. People recognized me and right away there was a huge group of people all over us. We finally had to be rescued by the police. Miller: How did this all begin? How young were you when you made your show business debut? Coogan: My parents were in show business, and I made my movie debut at eighteen months of age in an unbilled part in a picture called Skinner’s Baby. I was still an infant. My dad [John Henry “Jack” Coogan] was a dancer, and I’d gone onstage with him many times. Miller: The legend is that you were dancing the shimmy onstage at the Orpheum in L.A. when Charlie Chaplin, who was in the audience, saw you and thought he detected a special appeal in you. In fact, in his autobiography, Chaplin said your mugging to the audience might have been obnoxious in another child, but that you were “charming and the audience thoroughly enjoyed it.” I guess that was your lucky day because his decision to build The Kid around you made you a star overnight. How do you remember him? Coogan: Chaplin was very nice to me. He would just sit down with me and say what he wanted me to do and I’d do it. If Chaplin didn’t feel right about filming, he just wouldn’t film and I’d go play ball.\n\n10\n\nJackie Coogan\n\nMiller: After The Kid, you did a lot of famous juvenile parts in films like Peck’s Bad Boy and Oliver Twist, but you also did a lot of popular pictures that are forgotten today. Coogan: They made some crazy stuff. When I got my first haircut, it made headlines—and MGM made a movie about it, Johnny Get Your Hair Cut [1927]. Miller: When the talkies arrived, you were older, but were still appearing in some classic kid stories, like Tom Sawyer [1930] and Huckleberry Finn [1931]. Then the roles stopped coming so regularly. How did you feel when you realized you weren’t as “hot” as you’d been as a little boy? Coogan: There was nothing to be sorry about. I had as complete a life as any boy could have had. I was never bitter about it. Miller: I know you had a terrible ordeal in 1935 with the auto crash. Coogan: My father, my best friend, and two of my dad’s friends were returning from a dove hunt in Mexico when our car was forced over a cliff by another car near San Diego. I was the only survivor. Miller: As if that weren’t enough, you then turned twenty-one and learned that your mother and her new husband had used up almost all the money you had made in the movies. Coogan: They even cut off my $6.25 a week allowance. I sued and finally collected what was left. It gave me a serious distrust of “jurisprudence and politics.” Miller: How are things for you today? Coogan: I have four children from my four marriages and a horde of good memories. I’m financially stable, and my wife and I live permanently in Palm Springs. I’ve got damned little hair left, but I’ve been letting what’s left of it grow out for this role. I’ve put on some weight, so some people might mistake me for an out-of-work sumo wrestler. Miller: I think you’re well regarded as a very good character actor these days. Coogan: I’m probably only known by people old enough to remember The Kid or all those kids who watched The Addams Family. That’s all right. I’m happy doing these character parts. I won’t say I can do anything that comes my way, but I could never quit this business. When I lay off, I get way too jumpy.\n\n11\n\nJackie Coogan (second from left) as Uncle Fester in the 1977 TV special Halloween with the Addams Family.

His fourth marriage—to Dorothea “Dodie” Hanson—was the lasting one, from 1953 until Coogan’s death from a heart attack in 1984. The greatest child star of the silent era is honored with a star on Hollywood’s Walk of Fame on Vine Street near Hollywood Boulevard.\n\n13\n\nGloria Swanson Interview by James Bawden If there is one actress who personifies the silent movie leading lady, it would be Gloria Swanson. She was certainly one of the great stars of that era—first as a comedienne, then as a fine dramatic actress. She was also celebrated for her beauty. As if that were not enough, she also had a fine singing voice. But today Swanson is mostly remembered for her amazing comeback performance in Billy Wilder’s 1950 Sunset Blvd., in which she played Norma Desmond, a mentally unstable former silent movie star still living in her own glittering past. Swanson had a stormy love life, which included an adulterous affair with Joseph Kennedy, father of the future president. Kennedy bought a movie studio to give Swanson a new showcase and helped finance her illfated final silent film, the notorious Queen Kelly (1928), directed by Erich von Stroheim. It was a financial fiasco, savaged by censors and barely seen anywhere as talkies dominated America’s movie theaters. Nominated for Academy Awards in both the 1920s and the 1950s, Swanson represents the greatest glory of the silent era and, as Norma Desmond, its darkest vision.\n\nSetting the Scene Gloria Swanson had always been a movie puzzle to me. Sure, I’d seen her in Sunset Blvd. Who hadn’t? But when it came to the hundred or so silent movies she’d made, beginning in 1915, I simply drew a blank. Where was I going to see any of them shown? Then one night in 1972, CBC-TV showed 1934’s Music in the Air, her last really successful movie before her initial fame faded. It was an operetta in which she and John Boles were like a luminous preview of the future pairing of Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy. I was impressed. 14\n\nGloria Swanson\n\nGloria Swanson in Airport 1975 (1974). Courtesy of Universal Pictures.\n\nSo when the invitation came in the spring of 1974 to interview Gloria Swanson before a scheduled TV appearance on the Canadian series The Great Debate, I jumped at the chance. 15\n\nConversations w ith classic film stars\n\nThe Interview Swanson: Dear heart, fashionably tardy, I see. You have arrived four minutes and twenty seconds late. But do not despair. The young like to be fashionably late these days, or so I am told. But not me! I am forever punctual. If I had been fashionably late my first day at the studios, Charlie Chaplin would have given my job to somebody else. But I have more pressing problems, as you can see! Here I am in a supposedly grade-one hotel suite, and look for yourself! The ignominy of it all! No full-length mirror! No chandelier! Must I rough it? Must I? Bawden: The elevator stuck. Swanson: No doubt! No doubt! Excuses! The last time I was in your Toronto, I was onstage in Butterflies Are Free (1970). You saw it? And you adored me? Now you are talking sense. But one night I was desperately sick. Did I make excuses? No! I went out there with a tummy ache and I performed with a temperature of 101 and only the standing ovation at the end made that evening of excruciating pain seem to be worthwhile. Now you sit over there and I’ll sit full profile for your darling little photographer and I’ll place a long-stemmed red rose at my chin. Can I switch to white? Never, sir! Never! Now you may begin your questions. Don’t look so scared. I assure you I do not have a freshly killed corpse floating head down in the bathtub! Bawden: Why are you back in Toronto for one night? Swanson: To appear on the series The Great Debate, hosted by Pierre Berton. It will make for grand TV. I’ll defend the undefendable—namely, we should all eat organically. Bawden: Does it bother you to be so closely identified with Sunset Blvd.? Swanson: Ah, you cut to the chase! Yes and no. I was [as] completely unlike Norma Desmond as one could hope to be. I wasn’t living in a destitute mansion. I had a chic townhome in New York City and several companies, including a line of cosmetics, dress patterns, and a radio show. I was doing live TV in those days and touring in plays. Billy Wilder had first tried to get Mary Pickford, but she was so wealthy why would she do it? He told me Garbo sent the script back without comment, so to fix her he added a nasty line about her that stayed in. They had to paint lines on my face, you know, and I insisted on an extravagant wardrobe. I don’t think Billy truly likes women. Oh, we had great clashes on that set. 16\n\nGloria Swanson\n\nBawden: But you were back at Paramount. Swanson: That’s when the lines got blurred. And Billy added Cecil B. DeMille [to play himself in the movie], who’d given me my first bursts of stardom. And C. B. insisted on calling me “young fellow,” which is what he really did in real life. They added [to the cast] such relics as Buster Keaton and Anna Q. Nilsson, and who could tell where reality ended and illusion began? The shots of Norma at her peak came from Queen Kelly, which Erich von Stroheim directed me in in 1928. And he was playing my former husband here. Who wouldn’t be confused? Bawden: I understand Bill Holden was a last-minute addition. Swanson: Right! It was always going to be Monty Clift, but he was having an affair with Libby Holman at the time and it was too close for comfort, I’m afraid. Monty quit two weeks before filming. Bill was a Paramount contractor but he wasn’t as young as the character Joe was supposed to be. Bill was thirty-four by then. The shoot was fast and economical. We used a real house but not actually on Sunset Boulevard. I got second billing because Bill was supposed to be this big sexy star. And that was that. I think it’s Billy’s best film and I think I have a lot to do with that! Bawden: Do you remember Oscar night? Swanson: Not much because that night I was starring on Broadway in a revival of Twentieth Century with José Ferrer, who was also nominated. He won, lucky man, for Cyrano de Bergerac. I lost to Judy Holliday [for Born Yesterday], and we were all sitting in New York waiting for the announcements and at midnight all I wanted to do was go home to sleep. I told Judy, “Oh, my dear, you have all the time in the world.” But she didn’t. She was never nominated again and she died of cancer in 1965. I was told Bette [Davis, who was nominated for All about Eve] and I had almost tied in votes, and Judy had squeaked forward with only a few more votes to take it. Bawden: Did that typecast you? Swanson: No. I worked where I wanted. Paramount dared offer me another film where I was the mother of a teenaged girl, but I turned it down! Can you imagine! And Joan Fontaine did it [Darling, How Could You?] instead. I finally did one for Warners that was ghastly. Blah! Called Three for Bedroom C. And nobody saw it. I couldn’t even sit through it. Bawden: These days you’re identified with health foods. Swanson: Think what you’ve just said. All foods should be healthy. As a child I ate hard rock candy, not the terrible soft junk they give out these 17\n\nConversations w ith classic film stars\n\ndays. We ate meat without any of the things they inject in cows and chickens these days. Bread tasted like bread. Now everything is refined, teens are fat, people have heart attacks at thirty-nine. Does that make me nuts? Bawden: I only meant to say— Swanson: Please be quiet. I’m trying to tell you my life story and you are interrupting me. I was going to tell you when I met the warden of Alcatraz and I offered to send my bean sprouts diet guaranteed to cure criminality out of the most dastardly mass murderer. I visited the prison commissary and the smell of that gunk they were giving the convicts gave me a headache. He politely declined my services and there still are criminals among us. Bawden: Have you ever been sick? Swanson: In the thirties I was told I had a tumor down there. I met with a surgeon who was puffy faced and sweating and his hands trembled. He said he wanted to cut through my rectum to get at the growth. I stood and shouted, “Physician, heal thyself!” and I simply fled. A pure bean sprouts diet cured me in months and the tumor shrank and disappeared. I rest my case. Bawden: Did you always want to be a movie star? Swanson: No, I wanted to be successful at whatever I was doing. If I’d been a ribbon clerk in a department store, I would have been the best. When I was a little girl, the nickelodeons were quite disreputable. It was the genius of Adolph Zukor [founder of Paramount] who tried to legitimize the business by building those gorgeous palaces and promoting movies that the family could see or ones appealing to women. He really was promoting consumerism, although I doubt he knew it. Mr. Zukor—like Goldwyn, Harry Cohn, Louis Mayer—was an immigrant Jew who was painfully aware of his shortcomings and above all craved respectability. But he never was a producer himself. He always referred to movies as “product.” His company made the movies and exhibited them in his theaters. He invented block booking. Bawden: Did he make you a star? Swanson: No, the public did. They saw something in me. He saw the lineups to my movies and signed me for more. It was C. B. DeMille, who wasn’t Jewish or an immigrant, who built me up in racy movies like Male and Female and Why Change Your Wife? He was a Victorian prude. He loved to show sin first, so he could show the repentance. That and the outlandish fashions and the beautiful sets pulled them in. Audiences gasped 18\n\nGloria Swanson\n\nGloria Swanson with Rudolph Valentino in Beyond the Rocks (1922).

I look at those pictures now and see a chubby teenager. I don’t recognize her as me. Bawden: Did you like yourself and Rudolph Valentino in Beyond the Rocks [1922]? 19\n\nConversations w ith classic film stars\n\nSwanson: It’s a missing [lost] film. But, yes, I did like him—a very shy, miserable young man. He surrounded himself with tough women who bossed him around. Paramount built him up as the sheik, but the papers made fun of his masculinity. He took it personally and developed ulcers. But his quality came from his astigmatism. He was blind as a bat. He would not have survived sound with that effeminate voice and mannerisms. Bawden: Director Alan Dwan, born right here in Toronto, says you got too big for your britches when you moved to United Artists. Swanson: He said that? He’s right. I wanted to be my own boss, so I left Mr. Zukor and I made pictures for UA. The Loves of Sunya [1927] was just awful. Sadie Thompson [1928] was a hit, but the censors really made us change the story line around and we couldn’t use the original title, Rain. And Queen Kelly with its brothel scenes—really! I finally phoned Joe Kennedy, who was my financier, and he stopped production and we released it only in Europe. Talkies arrived around that time. It almost broke me, that one. Bawden: In The Trespasser [1929] you sang up a storm. Swanson [singing]: “Love, your magic spell is everywhere. Yet I feel you but you are not there!” See, I still remember. A huge hit. Mother love stuff. If I’d stuck with that formula, I could have sailed through the Depression. But I was typed as a twenties symbol, although I usually lived in New York and made my Paramount [films] mostly at Astoria Studios [in New York]. After the crash, the banks stopped lending us money and I was in trouble and so were Doug Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, Sam Goldwyn—the whole UA crowd. Bawden: Didn’t Irving Thalberg at MGM offer you a contract? Swanson: Yes! But he had a heart attack soon after I arrived and never truly recuperated. I was on salary for a year, but no pictures ensued. So I went to Harry Cohn at Columbia with a [script for a] tearjerker and he yells, “A girl with a brain tumor? Swanson, yer slipping!” It eventually was sold to Warners and became Dark Victory, Bette Davis’s biggest moneymaker! I went to Fox and made Music in the Air, where I warbled up a storm. The Met phoned with an offer, but I wanted to stick with movies. Then Fox was sold and I was out in the cold again. Bawden: You left town? Swanson: No, Hollywood left me. I was considered old stuff. I moved to New York, started my cosmetics firm, a line of clothing. I was always working. I tried once more with that dog-awful comedy [Father Takes a 20\n\nGloria Swanson\n\nWife in 1941]. But I was second billed to Adolphe Menjou! Me! The director [Jack Hively] came from Pomona. It was awful. Bawden: Do you ever see Mary Pickford? Swanson: No one sees her! She’s locked herself up in Pickfair. She telephones old friends from time to time. Not me! We had a parting of the ways in the thirties. Over United Artists. I’m not saying Mary cooked the books, but she drove others away with her financial diddlings. Walt Disney left. David Selznick left. Even Goldwyn had to. And she said I’d said things about her, and this was simply not true. So I sent her a copy of her own book, Why Not Try God. Hint, hint. But she always seemed so angry fame had left her. Serves her right. She bought up all her old movies and nobody saw them for twenty-five years. Why be angry that Doug Fairbanks left her forty years ago? Why? Bawden: Was there any old silent star who actually went crazy like Norma Desmond? Swanson: Well, Mae Murray used to board the Hollywood Boulevard bus and she’d sing strains from The Merry Widow just to make sure passengers knew who she was. And she’d go into the Academy Awards library and ask for her picture file and start shredding the photos she hated until she was asked to leave. But crazy? Well, Mae went into Larry Edmunds bookshop and asked, “Do you have any pictures of that fabulous actress Mae Murray?” And the clerk said, without batting an eye, “Sorry, Miss Murray, we have nothing new from the last time you asked.” They were scared she’d start autographing them all. Bawden: Do you go to screenings at the Museum of Modern Art? Swanson: You mean of my old silents—those that are left? No! I’m not crackers yet. A lot of strange young men attend and swoon appropriately, but I assure you I’m not camp. Not yet anyhow. Bawden: Didn’t they want you to take over from Katharine Hepburn on Broadway in Coco? Swanson: Oh, yes! I went to a matinee and saw Kate swanning about and thought she was just awful. Imagine a woman who loves to dress in men’s slacks cast as a great French designer! And the audience went wild! But the producers knew when she left attendance would slip. So they invited me on board, but at half her salary. And I said I could guarantee that attendance would rise, not fall—because, after all, I have always set fashion and not followed it. But they refused, so I walked, and they went after Claudette Colbert and offered the same deal. She said no and they 21\n\nConversations w ith classic film stars\n\nGloria Swanson is ready for her close-up in Sunset Blvd. (1950). Courtesy of Paramount Pictures.\n\nfinally hired Danielle Darrieux, who really is French but she’s unknown outside her homeland, and it all predictably failed. The moral is this: one must spend money to make it. And neither Claudette nor I come cheap. Bawden: Didn’t you once write a note to Greta Garbo? Swanson: You’ve done your homework! Yes! I invited her to the League of Former Movie Stars. I’m the president! She’d moved to New York City after the war and people were always seeing her walking about 22\n\nGloria Swanson\n\ntown. I mean, if she really wanted to be alone, why New York at all? I invited her around and said I’d give her lessons on remaining a movie star without ever actually making movies. She never replied. I’m sure she got it; I dropped it off at her apartment block. We could have worked together. Bawden: You once sang a song from Sunset Boulevard, the musical, on The Tonight Show, but nothing more came of it. Swanson: I sang the one song written for it. Around 1966. The producers had a deal with Paramount, which owns the rights. Billy Wilder was furious, but it makes sense. A musical about a silent movie star! What fun! So I phoned up Johnny Carson and he was enthusiastic and he let me do it, but nothing more happened. Nobody would put up the required advance. They twice remade it live on TV, you know, with Mary Astor and Miriam Hopkins. Poor things, they must have needed the money. Bawden: Why not a sequel? Norma is finally released from the funny farm and plots her next career move on TV in a sitcom? Swanson: Seriously? No, you are going too far. Carol Burnett wanted me to parody it on her show, but I can’t and won’t make fun of this woman. So I did my Chaplin imitation and it really went over big. It was sweet revenge on Charlie, who had hired me for my first job in 1916, and then said I’d never make it in pictures. The audience roared with applause. Bawden: I loved you in the TV movie Killer Bees [1974]. Swanson: So you’re the one. Wait a minute—you actually liked it! Why? Bawden: Well, your Swedish accent was perfect . . . Swanson: Dear heart, it was a German accent. How dare you? How do you dare? But as long as you liked it—well, you are forgiven. I played Madame Von Bohlen and I was told my costars would be Kate Jackson, Edward Albert, and John Getz, none of whom I’d ever heard of. I’d heard of Craig Stevens and that was about it. He asked why I was doing “a piece of crap like this”? And I shrugged. There’s good and bad in everything. The ratings went sky high. It was the closest thing I’ve ever done to a horror film. They made it in nineteen days, about the same speed as I’d make one of my silent Paramounts. Bawden: And then I’ve just caught the trailer for the upcoming Airport 1975 [1974]. Swanson: Universal phoned and said they wanted me to play one of filmdom’s greatest stars. I angrily retorted, “One?” And the name given her was preposterous. I said, “I shall simply play myself,” so they allowed me to 23\n\nConversations w ith classic film stars\n\nrewrite all my lines. Director Jack Smight kidded me and said on the set, “Gloria, do you also want to direct yourself, too?” And I said, “Oh, no, you’ve got to earn your salary. Just point me in the camera’s direction and I’ll take it from here.” These disasters are big business these days. On my first day I bumped into Myrna Loy and was stunned. Her skin was like parchment. I ordered her to eat nothing but bean sprouts and chamomile tea for a week and brought over a large jar of my own ointment, and in a week those lines as big as the Grand Canyon vanished. She was ever so grateful. Sid Caesar asked for some, too, but he was beyond saving, and anyways I was running low on the precious stuff. I told Chuck Heston this was going to be his most arduous assignment and he said, “No, that would be parting the Red Sea.” We sat for weeks in a scale model of an airplane and for verisimilitude they even wanted to serve us airport food on trays. Which is when I rebelled and placed an urgent call to Chasen’s for organic delicacies, which were promptly delivered, and Mr. Smight signed on the dotted line, as well he should have. Bawden: Future plans? Swanson: To go on being Gloria Swanson. It’s my life’s work. To keep busy and never feel angry about the past. Because the past is dead. I shall continue my fight for decent food. Maybe I’ll date Frankie Avalon. Maybe I’ll write my memoirs. But everything I’ll attempt will be with a certain style. Now I must prepare for my TV triumph. Even with C. B. gone, I’m still getting ready for my next close-up.\n\nAfterword Swanson won The Great Debate with a spirited defense of organic foods. The poor professor she was debating didn’t have a chance. She was immediately whisked out the door to the waiting stretch limousine. As it moved off into the dark, the window opened and a white glove stained with organic blueberries was spotted waving good-bye. Gloria Swanson was married six times. Her first husband (1916–1919) was actor Wallace Beery. Her second, Herbert Somborn (1919–1922) founded the Brown Derby restaurant. Her third was a French count, Henri de la Falaise (1924–1931). Her fourth was Michael Farmer and her fifth was George William Davey. Though she had a long love affair with Joseph Kennedy, she could not marry him because he already had a wife and nine 24\n\nGloria Swanson\n\nchildren. Still, he financed many of her last films in the silent era. Her sixth and last husband was health food writer William Duffy (1976–1983). Swanson died from a heart attack in 1983 at age eighty-four in New York City. She’d been partying the night before, still loudly proclaiming her status as one of moviedom’s greatest screen goddesses.\n\n25\n\nII The Leading Men\n\nRalph Bellamy Interview by James Bawden Ralph Bellamy was the complete actor. A leading man in his films of the 1930s, he was even more effective in secondary or supporting roles, where his expertise as a character player really came through. He made more than one hundred films, starred frequently on TV, and had a distinguished Broadway career, earning both Tony and New York Drama Critics awards. He was a founder of the Screen Actors Guild and a four-term president of Actors Equity. Though he played many memorable roles, he is probably best remembered as the screen’s most convincing portrayer of Franklin D. Roosevelt, playing the president on Broadway in Sunrise at Campobello, then in the film version, and in the TV miniseries The Winds of War (1983) and War and Remembrance (1988–1989).\n\nSetting the Scene If I had to name an actor’s actor, I’d certainly pick Ralph Bellamy. I became a fan early, watching him in everything from grade B melodramatics to screwball comedy on TV’s Late Show. He seemed to be in every other TV movie made in the 1970s. And he appeared to do it all with such ease. I first met him by chance on the set of a TV movie, 1978’s The Clone Master, at Paramount in Hollywood, and we talked at length. He invited me to call him when I was in L.A., and we met again in 1983 at his home high in the Hollywood Hills. Then in 1988 we enjoyed high tea at his hotel in Toronto while he was making the movie The Good Mother.\n\nThe Interview Bawden: How did you get started in acting and eventually into the movies? 29\n\nConversations w ith classic film stars\n\nRalph Bellamy, circa 1937. Courtesy of Columbia Pictures.\n\nBellamy: I was born in Chicago [in 1904]. My dad was an advertising executive. I was president of the Drama Club in high school. I guess I always wanted to act. I started out in bit parts in road shows out of Chicago. Eventually, in my twenties, I founded my own repertory theater—the Ralph Bellamy Players—and toured in Nashville and Evanston and Des Moines. We’d be alternating two plays at night, and in the day we’d be 30\n\nRalph Bellamy\n\nlearning a new play for the next week. We played in all kinds of theaters, and for me it was the chance to understand modulation, stillness, how to listen, which is the actor’s most important work. When talkies came along, our company disbanded. I made my Broadway debut in 1929. I was a mean bastard of a bootlegger. Even Broadway was crumbling after the crash, so I came west in 1931, like so many other stage actors. Bawden: Your first film, The Secret Six [1931], starred Clark Gable and Jean Harlow? Bellamy: It was my first movie but I wasn’t the star and neither were Clark and Jean. We were all given plum parts as sort of instant screen tests by MGM. And all three of us got $650 a week and thought we were in heaven. Lewis Stone and Wallace Beery were the stars. But as the movie progressed, Johnny Mack Brown’s leading man part was whittled down and key scenes given to Gable. Johnny has a southern accent that limited his range. And Jean, who was red-hot sex on wheels, had her part built up, too. I tried watching it on TV recently and it’s very crude. But Irving Thalberg [MGM’s production chief] thought Harlow would soar and finally bought out her contract from Howard Hughes, and he was the one who determined Clark would go to the top. At the time, Clark looked like Jack Dempsey. MGM tried gluing his ears back but it didn’t work. He had what’s called animal magnetism. Anyway, after filming completed, I’m down in a shady bar swilling down illegal liquor and in comes Clark. He told me he figured he only had a couple of years in the biz before he was found out and he wanted to salt away as much dough as possible. Bawden: Then you made a second movie for MGM, West of Broadway [1931]. Bellamy: MGM did not know what to do with [former silent movie star] Jack Gilbert. He’d signed a six-film contract at $300,000 a film, and they had to pay him off even if they couldn’t use him. Just a grand guy in person. And the stories about his voice are bogus. He had a lovely light Irish tenor. But the dialogue they’d given him in his first talkie was just plain stupid: “I love you” said over and over again. It was the way he overacted in silent style that ruined him, not his voice! So MGM tried to get him to leave. They’d call up at 3 a.m. and order him to report to the studio. Failure to do so would result in dismissal. But Jack showed up, and one night jumped in a frigid swimming pool a dozen 31\n\nConversations w ith classic film stars\n\ntimes as ordered by the director. Then they told him there was no film in the camera and to go home. I hated that and told Mr. Mayer off at length in his office. And he merely said I’d never work again at MGM, and I never did until 1968. Bawden: You got work elsewhere? Bellamy: I got a deal at Fox, another at Columbia. Harry Cohn [head of Columbia] loved to tweak Mayer. Both were very crude guys, but the difference is Harry knew he was crude. He’d belch in the screening room and then laugh. If a picture seemed overlong, he’d shout, “My bum itches!” Stuff like that. Ran a very tight studio. It was the cheapest and located in Gower Gulch. And yes, he had sweeties among the chorines, but so did Mayer. I did a couple of quickies that made piles of dough and I asked for double the salary for my next one and he closed his office door and whispered, “Just don’t tell Jack Holt,” who made quickies like I did but was some twenty years older. Bawden: Let me ask you about a B you made at Columbia as an example. Let me pick Parole Girl [1933]. How fast was it made and how much were you paid? Bellamy: They all were shot in two weeks or less—ten to twelve working days since we worked Saturdays in those days. For the men, you had to supply your own wardrobe, so I accumulated a variety of suits, coats, shoes, etc. Also I had to bring my own makeup kit. The women got stuff from the wardrobe department, but nothing was ever made specifically for them. Eddie Cline was the director here—a terrific guy. He shot at breakneck speed. Sometimes he used multiple cameras. He didn’t shoot as on an A picture: establishing shot, middle shots, then close-ups. He only shot what he needed. Mae Clarke was the leading lady and she was a theater veteran, too, and worked quickly and efficiently. On an Irene Dunne vehicle, they’d take an hour just to light her close up. Not here. The others included Marie Prevost, Hale Hamilton, Ferdinand Gottschalk. Never actually saw that one. I made eleven movies in 1933—I was busy! I’d say I maybe got $1,500 tops for it, perhaps a little less. Then it was on to the next B. Bawden: Why do you think Wild Girl [1932] was important in your career? Bellamy: Because I met Charlie Farrell, who was the star. And we got together and founded the Racquet Club, which is still in operation. I was always founding stuff in those days. I was one of the founding fathers of 32\n\nRalph Bellamy\n\nthe Screen Actors Guild, which did not entirely endear me to the big studio heads. Bawden: But you also did A movies. Bellamy: But not as the lead. That same year I made Picture Snatcher [1933] at Warners with my pal Jimmy Cagney. We were part of the socalled Irish mafia that included Pat O’Brien, Spencer Tracy, Frank Jenks. Jimmy played an ex-con who becomes a photographer for a tabloid. Today they call them paparazzi. The girls were Patricia Ellis, who was all of sixteen, and Alice White, and [Cagney] got to kick and shove them around with glee. One scene we had a fight and I rearranged his mug, broke his nose and teeth. He forgot to duck, I guess. I also did The Narrow Corner with Doug Fairbanks Jr. at WB [Warner Bros.] the same year. It was a South Sea Islands thing based on a Somerset Maugham story. We shot at Catalina and used a lot of back projection that seems so phony these days. Alfred Green shot it and much of the script was written by Darryl Zanuck, who was head of WB production at the time. Bawden: Another A was the Katharine Hepburn film Spitfire [1934]. Bellamy: What a stinker that was! Great Kate was a mountain girl named Trigger who somehow had acquired a Bryn Mawr accent. Bob Young was an engineer who is building a dam and has a romance with her. She doesn’t know he’s married. We shot in Hemet, California, both rural and hilly, and John Cromwell directed. The original male lead was Joel McCrea, but Hepburn had him dismissed, I don’t know why. Anyhow, it’s Saturday night on the last day of the shoot and Great Kate tells Cromwell her contract is over at the stroke of midnight. A contingent of RKO execs arrive and they go into a barn with her and she emerges, but it’s now 1 a.m. on Sunday. Says she’ll finish the last scene of the picture and when I asked why, from her gingham dress pocket she pulls a check made out for an additional $10,000. Pretty smart for a mountain lass, I must say. Bawden: Why did The Wedding Night [1935] turn out so poorly? Bellamy: It was called all over town “Goldwyn’s Folly.” Every studio tried to import a central European actress to vie with Garbo and Dietrich. C. B. DeMille had Franciscka Gaal, Universal had Elisabeth Bergner. There was Gwilli Andre. Warners had Lil Dagover. Sam Goldwyn’s choice was Anna Sten, fairly beautiful, a grand actress. But she had no heart, she had no soul. The public just wouldn’t accept her. That mystical bond with the audience just wasn’t there. Nothing Sam could do could force her on 33\n\nConversations w ith classic film stars\n\nAmericans. He made three expensive flops. Gary Cooper was the big name and even Coop couldn’t bring in customers. You see, the public makes a star, and not the producer. MGM tried with Luise Rainer, who won two Oscars, but the public never warmed to her. And eventually Sam just gave up on Miss Sten. Bawden: The same year you made the delightful screwball comedy Hands across the Table [1935]. Describe Carole Lombard. Bellamy: An angel in terms of screwball comedy. She did not have perfect features, you know. There was a big scar on her cheek, the result of a car crash as a child. But on the set, she was one of the gang. She sat with the crew between takes. No movie star airs for her. She always played jokes on all of us, like placing a squawk cushion on my wheelchair seat. One day she comes to me and asked why Freddie MacMurray didn’t make a pass at her. I said he was in a happy marriage, which floored her. She’d just gotten out of an abusive relationship with Bill Powell, so she didn’t know what a happy marriage was. Most days we laughed ourselves silly and that camaraderie really showed in the film. Bawden: You got your only Oscar nomination for The Awful Truth [1937]. How did this come about? Bellamy: It started out as just another assignment from Columbia. The script was sent to me and I was told what clothes to bring. The character at that stage was a stodgy Englishman. Then new scripts arrived— three—from Mary McCall, Dwight Taylor, and finally Dorothy Parker. All were discarded by our director, Leo McCarey. I’d be reunited with Irene Dunne, who I first worked with in the drama This Man Is Mine [1934]. It became one of my favorite pictures. And Cary Grant I’d never met. The story was constantly being reworked by Leo McCarey—who, by the way, was a complete clone of Cary. Only Cary then took some of Leo’s characteristics and interpolated them into his character. For days we’d sit around swapping stories and Cary, who is so disciplined, finally went to Cohn and said if Harry let him go he’d do two pictures for free. The first day Leo asked if I could sing. I said no, so he had me sing “Home on the Range” while Irene very shakily played the piano. It still gets a laugh when shown today. The result was serendipitous. Irene and I got Oscar nominations; Cary had a new career as the light comedy actor of his day. I wish all assignments could be as wonderful as this one turned out to be. Bawden: Not many directors could improvise. Bellamy: One who couldn’t was Greg LaCava, who was on a down34\n\nRalph Bellamy\n\nward spiral when Irene and I joined him for Lady in a Jam [1942]. He decided he’d do a McCarey and here we were stuck in Phoenix in blazingly hot weather. We shot a few bits from a script that was awful, then Greg disappeared for weeks with a writer and Greg’s psychiatrist. Irene lost her serenity and trashed her trailer—and remember, there was no air-conditioning in those days. And Lady in a Jam was so awful Greg only did one more movie before retiring to Malibu, where he spent his last years shooting seagulls from his balcony window. Bawden: What about His Girl Friday [1940]? Bellamy: Cary just asked for me, and Howard Hawks readily agreed. It was a variant on my Awful Truth character. This is the fastest-talked movie of all time. The lines just fly. Look at all those reporters in the prison scenes, veteran theater actors all: Gene Lockhart, Porter Hall, Regis Toomey, Ernest Truex. All highly competitive. For variety and comparison, Howard told me to talk ever so slow as a dimwit would. I savored every line while those characters chattered all around me. Roz Russell got so frightened at Cary’s glibness she told me she’d hired a gag writer on the side to interpolate bits for her. I first saw it complete with a preview audience. At one point Cary, asked to describe my character, ad-libbed as “He’s like that actor in movies, Ralph Bellamy,” and there was this roar of laughter and I jumped out of my seat! Bawden: You had a lock on these characters. Bellamy: In Brother Orchid [1940] I was a dim chauffeur who was an amateur ornithologist. In one scene where I’m driving in a convertible with Eddie Robinson and Ann Sothern in the back, I’m supposed to imitate all these bird tweets. We did the scene against a transparency, then Eddie rushes to the director, Lloyd Bacon, and barks, “Ralph is interpolating bird whistles not in the script. He’s trying to steal the scene with these tweets.” We all dissolved in laughter but Eddie was dead serious. Bawden: You were serious in a series of Ellery Queen mysteries. Bellamy: I did four of them: Ellery Queen, Master Detective; Ellery Queen’s Penthouse Mystery; Ellery Queen and the Perfect Crime; Ellery Queen and the Murder Ring. Made them for Columbia as Bs with Margaret Lindsay, who was an old pal, and Charlie Grapewin as my dad. Jimmy Hogan directed the last three I did but they became ordinary. I asked for more money and they replaced me with William Gargan. In the first, Marsha Hunt was one of the suspects, I remember, and Michael Whalen and Ann Shoemaker were there. And I loved doing them, although shooting 35\n\nConversations w ith classic film stars\n\nwas very fast. Kurt Neumann directed the first one, but I forget why he was replaced. Bawden: You knew Errol Flynn well? Bellamy: A darling. Couldn’t or wouldn’t take himself seriously. And he drank like there was no tomorrow. Had a bum ticker from the malaria he’d picked up in Australia. Also a spot of TB. Tried to enlist but flunked his medical, so he drank some more. Knew he wouldn’t live into old age. He really had a ball in Footsteps in the Dark [1941]. He was so glad to be out of swashbucklers. In Dive Bomber [1941] all the color shots of Pearl Harbor were shot only months before the Japanese attack. It made a fortune because war was coming by the time it got released. Bawden: I want to ask you about The Wolf Man [1941]. Bellamy: I already know the question. What the hell happened to Warren William? He gets second billing. I get third, but he disappears from the picture early on. The reason: Warren was quite the drinker, even boasted he could outlast John Barrymore. So he went on a bender and never came back to the set. We just worked around him. Craziest thing about that movie—that the diminutive Claude Rains is the father of hulking Lon Chaney Jr. The sets were impressive. They even built a small woods on a soundstage, and the special effects when Lon turns into the wolf took days of stop-action work. I asked Maria Ouspenskaya [the great Russian actress] why she was doing dreck like this and she answered, “Same as you. American bucks.” Curt Siodmak wrote it and he was always around and George Waggner directed. He should have had a long movie career, but wound up doing TV stuff. Bawden: Then came The Ghost of Frankenstein [1942]. Bellamy: Ugh. It sort of picked up the story from Son of Frankenstein [1939]. Lon Chaney Jr. was the monster this time and he really resented that. Cedric Hardwicke was Ludwig Frankenstein, Lionel Atwill was the doctor, Bela Lugosi was Ygor, and Evelyn Ankers, a wonderfully sensitive British lady, was Elsa Frankenstein. The damned dumb director was Erle C. Kenton, complete with whip and an air of pomposity. On one scene he was going on giving Evelyn directions: “Elsa, your father was killed by the monster, your husband dragged off by Ygor. Now what I want from you is one clear emotion—that you’re fed up with it all.” At which moment Sir Cedric lay on the floor howling with laughter and he couldn’t stop for some time. And forever afterwards at Hollywood parties I’d see him and he’d shout, “Fed up with it all?” 36\n\nRalph Bellamy\n\nBawden: The story goes that you were in producer Mark Hellinger’s office and saw on a secretary’s desk a script with a note about you. Bellamy: It said something like, “A wonderfully comic creation, this character dumb as a doornail, clumsy, frightfully daft—perfect Ralph Bellamy part!” At which I got up, walked out, walked out of Warners, and rang my agent to say I was being typecast and I needed a Broadway part right away. And he delivered. Within days it was announced I’d be going back to Broadway in a new play, Tomorrow the World [1943]. And I left Hollywood two years later and I was away for fifteen years with just one picture, 1955’s The Court-martial of Billy Mitchell in all that time. I never missed it. And I don’t think Hollywood missed me. Bawden: So you decided to go back to Broadway? Bellamy: Luckily, I picked a huge hit. Tomorrow the World opened in 1943 and ran over a year. I had a wonderful costar in Shirley Booth, Arnaud D’Usseau and James Gow wrote it, and Elliott Nugent directed and we opened at the Ethel Barrymore. It was all about a little blond boy who is on the last boat out of Nazi Germany before war is declared, and it turns out he’s already been turned into a Nazi. Little Skippy Homeier was the boy, and when they made the movie he was eighteen months older and no longer quite as effective. He then retired to finish high school but then came back in adult parts, but always as a villain. Bawden: An even bigger hit was State of the Union. Bellamy: We opened in 1945. Opening night at the Hudson there was this huge cheering. It was a political play by Howard Lindsay and Russell Crouse, who’d done the monster hit Life with Father. Leland Hayward packaged it all up and Bretaigne Windust directed it. We had quite the cast: Margalo Gillmore, Ruth Hussey as my wife, Myron McCormick, Minor Watson. It was about a captain of industry who is fed up with the mess in Washington. Later on Kay Francis replaced Ruth and we even toured in it. Spence Tracy got the movie part, but the film directed by Frank Capra was a big messy thing. Our version ran 765 times and I did it for years. Bawden: Then came Detective Story [1949)] Bellamy: It ran over 580 times. Opened in March 1949, closed in August 1950, and only because the summer heat that year was horrendous. It was the perfect play, really. I loved our cast: Jean Adair from Arsenic and Old Lace; Ed Binns, his first detective part; Lee Grant, who repeated her dazzling turn in the film; Horace McMahon. A lot of these wonderful 37\n\nConversations w ith classic film stars\n\npeople repeated their work in the 1951 film, but I was replaced by Kirk Douglas. Reason? Box office. Sidney Kingsley directed his own play. How can one argue with the playwright, I ask you? We started at the Hudson, transferring to the Broadhurst, and road companies played everywhere. Bawden: Then came your role as Franklin D. Roosevelt in Sunrise at Campobello, which I understand is your favorite. Bellamy: It’s the reason I’m still active today. I wasn’t in such great shape by then, but I had to play in a chair every night, so I got a great physical instructor in. We had to work on my arm and back muscles. FDR had great biceps, he had to drag himself around. My neck muscles grew. I no longer had backaches. And I’ve continued that regimen ever since. Bawden: What was it like opening night? Bellamy: We opened [in] January 1958. Opening night I took a peek through the stage curtain and the entire contingent of New Dealers were sitting in the first few rows. I nearly had a heart attack. I mean, you have to remember FDR had been dead fourteen years. That’s not a whole lot of time. But Mrs. Roosevelt was sitting right there and the “children,” now all grown up. Mary Fickett was Eleanor, Anne Seymour was Mrs. Sara Delano Roosevelt, a young pup by the name of James Earl Jones was there. Crowds cheered. It was something special in my acting life. We played 556 performances at the Cort, always to the same rapturous reaction. I got the Tony Award as best actor, which pleased me to no end. Bawden: But you told me you hated the movie version. Bellamy: I overplayed to the rafters. We had Vince Donohue do the movie as well as the play, and he had precious little movie experience. I took one look at the finished product and it was awful. There’s no modulation. We’re all shouting our lines, except Greer Garson, who came in as Eleanor and she’s perfect. She was the only one nominated for an Oscar. I certainly did not deserve one. But I got a whole new career playing FDR. He’s been very good for my bank account. And I always thought there was more than a little rich, ripe ham in him. Bawden: Explain to me how you could do eight performances a week and do a live TV series for CBS all at the same time. Bellamy: It’s back to the routine I’d done in repertory. And also I was quite a bit younger. From 1949 through 1953, we played the half-hour detective saga [Man against Crime] on CBS, and that meant live from Grand Central studios. In 1952 we switched to film, which made things easier for me. One night while I was on in Detective Story, I finished the 38\n\nRalph Bellamy\n\nbroadcast exactly at 9 p.m. They’d hold the curtain another fifteen minutes while I cabbed it over to the theater, and I’d just stroll on without makeup. But that night a drunk hit the cab and I had to run for the last few blocks. Dripping with perspiration, I raced in, staggered onstage, and gave what was called my best-ever performance. The filmed shows were made at the old Edison studios in the Bronx. CBS cancelled us in 1953, and we then ran on two separate networks, NBC and DuMont, exactly at the same time, Sundays at 10:30. When I took a vacation in 1951, Robert Preston came on as my brother Pat and kept things going. I loved doing it! Bawden: I have the VHS copy of you and Bill Shatner costarring in The Defenders live in 1957 on CBS’s Studio One series, but when the weekly series started, you and Bill had been replaced. So what happened? Bellamy: Why, I was a bad boy. It took CBS almost three years to decide to do it as a series, and then they wanted to film it in California. They were phasing out live drama. I simply asked for too much dough, and I think Bill’s movie career had heated up. So E. G. Marshall and Bob Reed replaced us and that’s that. I just continued on TV elsewhere. In 1962, I was asked to replace Wendell Corey in the medical series The Eleventh Hour. I did about thirty of those, and then I tried to get on every drama show around. I wanted it all. Bawden: How did you get the choice part of Dr. Sapirstein in Rosemary’s Baby [1968]? Bellamy: Oh, the little man wanted me—[director] Roman Polanski. Very dwarfish creature with a high giggle. After a take, he wouldn’t say, “Cut.” One would just hear a “Tee hee hee.” He used a lot of veterans: Patsy Kelly, Elisha Cook Jr., Maurice Evans, Ruth Gordon, Sidney Blackmer. I knew most of them from way back when. Roman presented everything in [such] a calm, matter-of-fact way that the creeping terror just builds. It’s sheer genius on his part. It’s a very quiet movie where a door creaking can unnerve one. There’s a lot of dark comedy in there, too. He was a very careful director—explained everything, multiple takes, very demanding, very appreciative when one got it right. Loved to talk old movies with me. Bawden: Then he offered you another role which you turned down? Bellamy: Oh, yes, phoned me up when he was starting work on Chinatown [1974]. Told me he wanted me for Noah Cross. I’d be the stern old man who had raped his own daughter, had the illegitimate child and . . . 39\n\nConversations w ith classic film stars\n\nRalph Bellamy as Franklin Delano Roosevelt in TV’s War and Remembrance (1988). Courtesy of ABC.\n\nAnd I said, “Whoa! Wait a minute!” And that was that. It may be a brilliant movie, but I still had to look at my wife across the breakfast table every morning and I had grown children. And Roman said I was afraid of being evil. But that’s not the case at all! Johnny Huston did it, but I don’t think he should have. So I got the little man mad at me and that was that. Bawden: You had another big hit with Trading Places [1983]. Bellamy: Went in for costume rehearsals and Ray Milland, chosen as my brother Mortimer Duke, was having difficulties. Finally he had to bow out just before filming and they got in Don Ameche. The script was choice. 40\n\nRalph Bellamy\n\nFirst morning in the makeup trailer, I said, “Why, this is my seventy-second movie.” And Don answers, “Why, this is my fifty-sixth.” And Eddie Murphy looks embarrassed and says, “Boys, this is my first. Ever.” It broke everybody up, and the movie became my biggest-ever hit. [Years later, in 1988, we talked again over lunch in Toronto while he was filming The Good Mother.] Bawden: As usual, you’ve been busy. Bellamy: I got to play FDR again in The Winds of War. That was challenging. And I’m back at it in War and Remembrance, which comes on next season. I’m still doing my FDR exercises every morning. Then they asked me to join Hotel [1985–1986] as Uncle Jake Cabot. Had a grand reunion with Anne Baxter, who I’d last worked with on Guest in the House in 1944. She bade me good-bye one weekend and went back to New York City and died there of a stroke right on the street. I’m also doing the mystery movies titled Christine Cromwell with Jackie Smith, a great beauty. And here I am in Toronto, my first time here since selling war bonds in 1944. My mother, who was Canadian born, asked me to get her some maple leaves and it was fall, so we got some red ones and pressed them on wax paper and preserved them for her. This part is small but dandy and I’m getting to know and love Teresa Wright, the latest in a long line of wonderful leading ladies. And I just know I’ll continue for a little bit longer at least.\n\nAfterword Ralph Bellamy, eighty-seven, died in a Santa Monica hospital of a lung ailment on November 29, 1991.\n\n41\n\nRory Calhoun Interview by Ron Miller Rory Calhoun was always tinged with a bad-boy reputation in Hollywood because rumors about his criminal youth dogged him most of his professional life. As a result, even the many heroic roles he landed in westerns and dramas were usually men with an element of danger about them. Though he was a handsome, well-built man in his younger years, he seemed more at home playing gamblers or reformed outlaws and seldom took the role of white-hatted action hero as did other leading men of his time. Born Francis Timothy McCown, he had no acting ambitions of any kind as a young man. A high school dropout, he progressed from petty thievery in his teens to armed robbery. He was sentenced to the California Youth Authority reformatory, but busted out and became a fugitive. He was caught after stealing a car and crossing a state line, which earned him a three-year federal prison term in Springfield, Missouri. When he finished his time there, he was arrested on other pending charges and sent to San Quentin State Prison in California. He was finally paroled and decided to clean up his life and make a new start. While riding horseback one day in the Hollywood Hills, he met actor Alan Ladd. They struck up an acquaintance and Ladd asked his wife, talent agent Sue Carol, to see if she could get the rugged, good-looking young man any parts in movies. That led to small parts in several films of the early 1940s, and the erstwhile criminal started learning the acting business. He soon attracted the attention of top Hollywood producer David O. Selznick, who put him under contract. Talent agent Henry Willson gave him a new screen name: Rory Calhoun. His rise to stardom didn’t happen overnight. In many of the pictures he worked in from his debut in 1944 he didn’t even earn screen credit. (One of his showier roles was as heavyweight boxer “Gentleman Jim” Cor42\n\nRory Calhoun\n\nRory Calhoun, circa 1965. Courtesy of Screen Gems.\n\nbett in the 1945 film The Great John L., in which he was billed as Frank McCown.) His breakthrough role came in the hit film about singer Jane Froman’s life, With a Song in My Heart (1952), in which Calhoun played the young airman who saves Froman (Susan Hayward) after their plane crashes during World War II, then later marries her. The studio, 20th Century-Fox, afterward gave him a big buildup, putting him in with some of the bright43\n\nConversations with classic film stars\n\nest stars on the lot, including Marilyn Monroe in How to Marry a Millionaire (1953) and River of No Return (1954). By the mid-1950s, Calhoun had moved up to prominent roles in westerns at other studios, mainly B pictures like Dawn at Socorro (1954), Four Guns to the Border (1954), and Utah Blaine (1957), becoming firmly established as a leading man in action roles. He also tackled a variety of roles in TV, including a dramatic turn in Alfred Hitchcock’s Suspicion series, and in 1958 he landed his own western series, The Texan on CBS, which ran for two seasons. As westerns faded from the scene, Calhoun worked for a few years in European action films, then returned to the United Sates to appear mainly in episodic television. By the 1980s, Calhoun had aged into supporting character roles in films and television, but he still enjoyed some showcase parts—especially his leading role in the 1980 horror film Motel Hell, in which he played a deranged farmer who traps highway motorists and chops them up to make the sausages he sells to tourists. Two other films that gave the aging Calhoun a rich role were Angel (1984), in which he played a wacky Hollywood Boulevard western weirdo named Kit Carson, and its 1985 sequel, Avenging Angel. Also during that period, Calhoun spent four years playing the role of Judge Judson Tyler in the CBS daytime serial Capitol. In his twilight years, Calhoun had a running battle with the tabloids, which reported he was dying of prostate cancer. They had feasted on him throughout much of his career, constantly digging up his criminal past and dwelling on the charges made by ex-wife Lita Baron in their divorce case that he was a serial womanizer. (Superstar Betty Grable, his love interest in How to Marry a Millionaire, was one of the women Baron named.) He was the father of five daughters—three with Lita Baron, one with second wife Sue Rhodes, and one with a woman who won a paternity suit against him.\n\nSetting the Scene I grew up with a special appreciation of Rory Calhoun because he spent much of his youth in my hometown, Santa Cruz, California, and went to some of the same schools before he dropped out. I remember digging his clip file out of the “morgue” of the Santa Cruz Sentinel, where I worked in the first few years of my newspaper career, and finding some accounts of his behavior as a “juvenile delinquent.” That only enhanced my interest in 44\n\nRory Calhoun\n\nan actor I already thought was pretty impressive on the screen—and I saw most of his films because I was a big fan of westerns. I finally met him in the summer of 1983 when I was covering the TV and movie business in the Los Angeles area. CBS, promoting its new daytime soap opera, Capitol, offered a chat with one of its stars—Rory Calhoun. Over lunch, I found him to be a very good-natured “regular guy” who had a great sense of humor, especially about himself. He had gray hair and quite a few wrinkles in his handsome face, but he looked pretty darn good for a man who had just turned sixty-one. I guess we hit it off pretty well because Calhoun asked if I would like to go with him that evening to a screening of Angel before it was released to theaters. I met him at the screening room and together we watched him give one of his best performances in years.\n\nThe Interview Miller: What kind of a childhood did you have? I know that your father was a gambler who died when you were less than a year old and you lived with your mother and stepfather after that. Calhoun: In those days, the early 1930s, people were very transient. We moved from Los Angeles to San Diego to El Centro to Marysville to Santa Cruz. Miller: What did your family do for a living? Calhoun: Stole, mostly [laughs]. My mother was a waitress. My uncle was an underwater welder. The people in my family went where the work was. They were just ordinary working people. Miller: So you were a working-class kid who grew up in mostly small towns like Santa Cruz. What did you think about Hollywood back then? Calhoun: That was a whole other world. All the glamour, the big cars, and all that stuff. That was fairyland. Miller: I know that your youthful flirtation with crime and your time behind bars came back to haunt you once you were a well-known actor and the tabloids went after you. How did all that finally come out? Calhoun: I’d had a few phone calls from guys I did a little time with. I never avoided them, but we got in a few scrapes here and there because they wanted to blackmail me. So we’d have a punch-out. I was in my late twenties and I didn’t fear anybody, but I decided it was time to do something about it and come out with the story. But how and where to do it was 45\n\nConversations with classic film stars\n\nthe problem. I decided Redbook magazine was the place to do a gentle exposé of my past. We were ready to do that when Confidential magazine contacted me. They said they had the whole story, pictures and everything, so did I want to talk to them. I said, “You’re goddamn right I do!” So I did, and what it turned out to be was a success story about how I changed my life. Miller: Does your past still haunt you today? Calhoun: Today it doesn’t mean anything in our society. It doesn’t really hurt you unless you murdered somebody, which I never did. The whole philosophy has changed. Man has become much more permissive. In those days, it was Mama and apple pie. There were certain things you didn’t do that are now common. If you were the “bad boy” in town, nobody wanted to talk to you. Now they want to know how you’re doing. Miller: Is the story about running into Alan Ladd on a riding trail true? Calhoun: Yes. I met him on the bridle trail early one morning. I was working in a lumberyard then. He asked me to lunch and I met Sue Carol, his wife and agent, who took me over to Fox the next day. I did a scene from Heaven with a Barbed Wire Fence, and next thing I knew I was under contract. Miller: That was in 1944 and they put you into a musical with Perry Como called Something for the Boys. What do you remember about that? Calhoun: I didn’t say anything in that picture. I just hung around. Miller: You followed that up with an unaccredited part as “soldier in a truck” in Sunday Dinner for a Soldier [1944] with Anne Baxter and John Hodiak. Calhoun: That was my first speaking part. Oh, I had a hell of a line in that: “Gee, does she have a sister?” They left it in. I wasn’t on the cutting room floor. Miller: You did manage to get a showcase scene in The Great John L., playing “Gentleman Jim” Corbett, who took the world heavyweight boxing title from John L. Sullivan [Greg McClure]. Calhoun: I only had that one big scene where I was dancing around the ring, beating the hell out of John L. Sullivan. I think I had one line where, after I beat him, he tells me to take care of the championship and I say, “I’ll do that, Mr. Sullivan!” But I had a lot of action shots. Miller: Did they tell you they figured you as a certain “type” on-screen? 46\n\nRory Calhoun\n\nCalhoun: They never really told me anything. I made a couple of other pictures where I was in automobiles or just walking around in the big city. But nobody remembers much about those. Miller: What did you think was going to happen after those first couple of little parts in pictures? Did you think you were on your way to stardom? Calhoun: It didn’t really matter to me. I didn’t care what happened because I could go back to the lumberyard. I was making more money selling redwood than I was under my movie contract. I didn’t know anything about acting. The only acting I’d ever done was in front of my creditors or a judge. For me, it was a lark. I had a seven-year contract, but Fox had a sixmonth option and they dropped me after the first year. Said I had no talent. Miller: So what happened then? Calhoun: David Selznick picked me up and put me under contract to him for five years. Miller: Some actors loved Selznick, but others hated being under one of his exclusive contracts because he often didn’t find anything for them to be in. Your take on him? Calhoun: I have a deep affection for the man. He never put me in any of his pictures, but he never did anything bad to me. He helped me constantly. I was with him for five years and when he closed his studio, he negotiated a new contract for me back at Fox and got me eight times the money I’d been making. Miller: While you were with him, he loaned you out for one of the best pictures you made in your early years—The Red House [1947] with Edward G. Robinson and Judith Anderson. Calhoun: That really got me started. That was my first big thrill in movies. I don’t think I’ll ever feel quite like that again unless I do something unlikely, like win an Academy Award or something. Miller: What was it like to be a young actor with no training working with an old pro like Edward G. Robinson? Calhoun: He was magnificent. Two of us made a test for that part. The other guy was a better actor than me at the time. It was Robert Horton. He did a better test, too, but Robinson wanted me for some reason. He knew I really couldn’t handle it, so every night while we were on location he would bring me up to his suite of rooms with his wife and he’d go over my scenes with me. He believed in helping young people along. He also knew that the better I was, the better it was for the picture. I try to do the 47\n\nConversations with classic film stars\n\nsame. I don’t impose myself on the young actors today, but if I see the opportunity to help them make it better, I do it. I think I owe it to them because it was done for me. Miller: Finally, people began to notice you after The Red House. What was that like? Calhoun: For about the first two years, if somebody came up to me and asked for an autograph, I was in shock. I still didn’t grasp the idea since I’d been doing nothing but little bits and stuff. I mean, I still drove a wrecking truck at night. Miller: How did you really learn to act when you were getting just these little parts? Calhoun: Selznick was a wise man. He made me the “king of the tests.” If he heard they needed somebody to do a test with somebody for a role, he’d send me over. I would test almost every week with some big star—Ingrid Bergman, Jennifer Jones, Gregory Peck, Joe Cotten. He gave me experience that way—working with these competent professional people! I would never have had a chance to work with that caliber of actor or actress if it hadn’t been for that. I was in thick with Selznick, though I was still at arm’s length. I sort of did a lot of legwork for him. Like, he’d call me at 11:30 at night and tell me to set him up with a table for twelve at the Mocambo and that he wanted me to be there. He kept me visible and, for me, it really worked well. Miller: Did you ever see a part in one of his films that you really wanted but didn’t get? Calhoun: I’ve lost a lot of parts, but I think the only one that ever got to me was in his The Paradine Case [1948]. I’d just finished The Red House, which was a heavy part, but he brought in Louis Jourdan from France to play the gatekeeper in The Paradine Case. I felt I really was ready for that, but he wanted Jourdan. Louis did a hell of a job on it. Selznick was trying to build a stable of the best people in Hollywood. Miller: He loaned you out to Warner Bros., which put you in That Hagen Girl [1947] opposite Shirley Temple in one of her first grown-up roles. And you also got to work with Ronald Reagan in that film. Your memories? Calhoun: Selznick must have blackmailed them or something—but anyway, I got the part. I didn’t have much to do in it. Reagan was pretty political, even back then. He sent me a nice letter on my birthday. It went right into my scrapbook. 48\n\nRory Calhoun\n\nRory Calhoun comes on to Marilyn Monroe in 1954’s River of No Return. Courtesy of 20th Century-Fox.\n\nMiller: Once you were back at Fox, you really started to get career momentum after your romantic role opposite Susan Hayward in With a Song in My Heart. How was she to work with? Calhoun: She was marvelous—a real pro. God, what a pleasure to work with that lady! Miller: And of course the studio put you into two of its big CinemaScope pictures with Marilyn Monroe—How to Marry a Millionaire and River of No Return. Your memory of Marilyn? Calhoun: She was a phenomenon that I doubt like hell this town will ever see the likes of again. There have been a lot of people trying to copy her one way or another—and to me, they’re third stringers. Miller: In River of No Return, you lost her to Robert Mitchum. Like you, he’s an actor who had his hard times in the tabloids. What do you think of him? Calhoun: He’s one of the greatest guys you’ll ever meet in your whole life. I’m very fond of Bob. He’s a hell of a guy. I guess we could have swapped 49\n\nConversations with classic film stars\n\nroles [in that picture], but he was right for that and I was right for what I was doing because I was more greasy, more slick. Well, let’s face it: that’s where it is. I had this shitty look. That’s what they wanted and that’s what I gave ’em. There wasn’t a hell of a lot of effort involved. Miller: Did you have a hard time getting truly romantic roles? Calhoun: I’m uncomfortable with it. I guess that’s a bridge I haven’t crossed over. I never felt really comfortable kissing a girl in front of eighty people. I’m self-conscious about that. I like to kiss girls—don’t misunderstand me. But you’re always thinking some guy up on the catwalk is thinking, “Hell, I can do it better than him!” And he probably can. Miller: So you’re more comfortable playing heavies? Calhoun: They’re a ball. It’s fun to growl, snarl, and look wicked. They’re fun to do. It’s a game. Miller: When nothing big seemed to be happening anymore at Fox, you left and went to Universal, where you started getting leading roles in their westerns. Calhoun: Fox tried to pull a slick one on me, to keep me on another year for the same salary. But I’d already been over to Universal and they told me that if I could ever get out of my Fox contract, they’d like to use me. So I said no to the deal with no raise and Fox didn’t pick up my option and I went to Universal, where I did five pictures in the first year. I worked so much I was cross-eyed. Miller: Then you began to make pictures in Italy. Calhoun: They were civilized in their filmmaking. You went to work at 11 in the morning. You block out a scene and then you break for lunch for three hours from 1 to 4. You go back and work until 10, then go home, shower, put on some clothes, and have dinner at a sidewalk café at 11:30 at night. And I was being paid for it, too. Miller: And you also began to work a lot more in television. Calhoun: I wanted to try another medium. I was scared to death of the stage. I’d tried a couple of plays and hated it. I did a lot for Dick Powell’s Four Star Theater in those days. I was on a search for knowledge and decided this wasn’t a bad business to be in. Miller: Now you’ve gone from starring in your own TV series—The Texan—to being a member of a daytime drama ensemble in Capitol. What’s that like? Calhoun: They’re kind of easy on me. I do an average of a show and a half a week. Some weeks I don’t work and some others I do three shows. 50\n\nRory Calhoun\n\nRory Calhoun as the Hollywood “cowboy” known as Kit Carson in Avenging Angel (1985). Courtesy of New World Pictures.\n\nIt’s not that consuming—and they give me time off. [Producer] John Conboy is good about that. If you have something to do, he’ll shoot around you. I think this is probably the greatest continuing experience I’ve ever had. If it ends tomorrow, I’ll be richer from having gone through it. Miller: But your movie career now finds you playing much more character-driven roles, not all of them leading parts. Was that hard to accept? Calhoun: There’s a point you have to come to realize after awhile. It hit me sometime after my mid- or late forties. You say to yourself: “Hey, I’m no longer the heartthrob.” You’re gonna get gray hair unless you dye it, and you’re going to get a bunch of wrinkles. So you’d better be prepared to make a transition and be happy about playing a little older part like I’m doing now. Miller: How did you like starring in a horror movie like Motel Hell? Calhoun: I had a ball doing that. Hey, I made sausage out of nice little people! Miller: And now you’re playing a character in Angel that seems to make fun of the western heroes you used to play. 51\n\nConversations with classic film stars\n\nCalhoun: Yes, I’m a character they call Kit Carson, who’s one of the Hollywood Boulevard people. They wanted Slim Pickens for the part, but he wasn’t available, so they came to me. He wears a fringed jacket, a big white hat, and a long gray wig and a moustache. He carries two pistols, boots and spurs, and walks up and down Hollywood Boulevard talking about yesteryear—Tom Mix, William S. Hart, and all that stuff—giving people autographs whether they want them or not. But in the end I shoot the villain who’s trying to kill the girl [Donna Wilkes]. And I shoot him in old-time western style in an alleyway with the light behind me. What’s not to like? Miller: How would you sum up your career today? Calhoun: I’ve been up and down like a yo-yo many times, but I’ve always worked. I have to tell you, I was probably the most naïve son of a bitch this town ever saw. I really don’t know how they ever tolerated me.\n\nAfterword Rory Calhoun died on April 28, 1999, from emphysema and diabetes. He was seventy-six. Calhoun’s last screen appearance was in an episode of TV’s Tales from the Crypt in 1993. He has two stars on Hollywood’s Walk of Fame, one for his movie work and the other for his TV roles.\n\n52\n\nJoseph Cotten Interview by James Bawden Joseph Cotten made a very auspicious screen debut in 1941 in the film most often acclaimed as the greatest-ever American movie: Orson Welles’s Citizen Kane. The talented stage and radio actor went on to become a leading man in scores of important films, including a number of renowned classics, among them Shadow of a Doubt (1943), Gaslight (1944), Since You Went Away (1944), Duel in the Sun (1946), The Farmer’s Daughter (1947), and The Third Man (1949). Cotten worked into the 1980s, even after he had slipped from leading roles to character parts. Though he appeared in quite a few uninspired productions late in life, his legacy on film is one of the richest of any actor of Hollywood’s golden age.\n\nSetting the Scene The first time Orson Welles’s The Magnificent Ambersons was shown on Canadian TV in 1960, I stayed up half the night to watch it. Though it wasn’t easy for me to get up the following morning for my eighthgrade class, it was an experience I had to get used to because Welles’s Citizen Kane, another “must-see” movie, ran not long afterward on late-night TV. Those two classic films made me appreciate the particular talents of Joseph Cotten, who starred in the two Welles masterpieces. But then I also saw him in Gaslight, Portrait of Jennie, Since You Went Away, and I’ll Be Seeing You in rapid succession on late-night TV. In fact, I don’t think I actually saw Joseph Cotten on the big screen of a movie theater until 1964, when Hush . . . Hush, Sweet Charlotte opened. The following year, I saw Cotten in person at a matinee performance of the short-lived play Calculated Risk, costarring his wife, Patricia Medina, 53\n\nConversations with classic film stars\n\nJoseph Cotten, circa 1961. James Bawden collection.\n\nat the Royal Alexandra. That confirmed one fact in my mind: he was a masterful theater actor as well as one of Hollywood’s most versatile leading men, capable of playing romantic leads (The Farmer’s Daughter), villains (Shadow of a Doubt), or heroes (The Third Man) with equal success. Fifteen years later, in 1980, I wrote my final article for the Hamilton\n\n54\n\nJoseph Cotten\n\nJoseph Cotten (right) with Orson Welles in Citizen Kane (1941). Courtesy of RKO Radio Pictures.\n\nSpectator before moving on to the Toronto Star. It was a profile of Cotten, based on my interview with him at his Beverly Hills apartment. I remember how that afternoon stretched into the evening as the then seventy-fiveyear-old Cotten chatted on about his lengthy career as Hollywood’s most dependable leading man.\n\n55\n\nConversations with classic film stars\n\nThe Interview Bawden: Did you always think of a life in movies? Cotten: Never! My parents were well-to-do southerners. I grew up in Petersburg, Virginia. I was born there in 1905, the oldest of three brothers. But I always wanted to act—of course, onstage and not in the flickers. I studied acting at the School of Expression in Washington, but no offers came. So I moved to Miami and was the freelance drama critic for the Washington Herald from 1926 to 1928. I had other side jobs to keep me going while I acted in amateur stock. By 1930, I’d made my Broadway debut, but right then the Depression killed off Broadway as a viable option, so I tried to get as many radio gigs as possible. I’d married in 1931 and I felt any experience was all right. Bawden: Don’t you think it strange you made your movie debut in probably the best American movie of all time . . . Citizen Kane [1941]? Cotten: But I didn’t. It was my second movie. Bawden: So what was your first then? Cotten: The Philadelphia Story. I can see your eyebrows lifting. I’m not in the MGM movie that was released. But I’m in the first one MGM made. Let me explain. Metro bought the rights [to the play] from Katharine Hepburn and decided to film it several times right through and edit that into a movie version. So they rented out our Broadway theater for two performances, had an invited audience, and the cameras rolled. That way they could get an understanding of how the story flowed. And it made for a better final movie with Hepburn, [Cary] Grant, and [James] Stewart because much of the dialogue was cut down by Don Stewart and he also completely eliminated the role of Tracy’s brother. I was C. K. Dexter Haven, replaced by a guy named Cary Grant. And Van Heflin was the reporter replaced by Jimmy Stewart. The photographer, Liz Imbrie, was Shirley Booth, replaced by Ruth Hussey. MGM told me my version is still somewhere in the vaults, but legally cannot be shown. Bawden: How did you meet Orson Welles? Cotten: It was about time. I was “only” thirty-five! I’d originally met Orson Welles in the midthirties when CBS had a producer on Madison Avenue, Knowles Entrekin, and I was in his office with Orson, and Orson dumped his pipe into the wastepaper basket and set it on fire. Now that’s one way of getting known. He was a boy of twenty-one or twenty-two. I had started going to auditions for radio shows in New York and met him 56\n\nJoseph Cotten\n\nwhile he was also auditioning. Days later we were rehearsing a play for School of the Air and the line “barrels and barrels of pith” caused me, Orson, and fellow actor Ray Collins to continually double up in laughter, And Knowles became very red-faced with anger and almost, but not quite, fired us. But when Orson founded the Mercury Theater in 1937, he asked for me to come on board. His first production was a modern-dress version of Julius Caesar, mounted for $5,000. I’d been in such flops as Jezebel with Miriam Hopkins and The Postman Always Rings Twice with Dick Barthelmess. Orson saw me in both, told me I’d never be a good actor, but with my curly hair I’d have to get by as a star. Bawden: Did you get to play in Citizen Kane through your connection with Welles then? Cotten: No, I was brought out to Hollywood by my agent, Leland Hayward, and trotted around to the studios, all of whom turned me down. I was at RKO, so I dropped in to say hi to Orson and he hired me on the spot as Jededia Leland. The name was a combination of Jed Harris and Leland Hayward. Ray Collins, Everett Sloane, Paul Stewart, and George Coulouris had already been set. The script was still being written by Orson and Herman Mankiewicz out at the Mankiewicz home. Orson said he’d already wasted six months on a script for Heart of Darkness that RKO turned down. Bawden: But when did shooting begin? Cotten: In August 1940. I just hung around for weeks, not even getting paid, listening to the fantastic stories Orson and Herman were dreaming up. I was in a wheelchair in my first scene as an old man. I hadn’t seen a finished script until one was presented to me at 7 p.m. I was told to report to make up at 4 a.m. for a rubber mask to be applied. I’d already had an assortment of wigs made for me. At 9 a.m., the buzzers sounded and Orson was in a wheelchair, too, after spraining an ankle at tennis. We went out to a sanitarium; I’m an old senile coot reminiscing about the glory days. Citizen Kane had begun! Gregg Toland [the cinematographer] said to start the cameras and that was that. Bawden: Did anybody know they were doing a film that would be hailed as the best ever made in America? Cotten: Nope. Certainly not me. That first day we shot until 6:30 the next morning. Then it was all junked because my wig wasn’t right. Orson would say, “This is what I want to achieve here,” and Gregg would nod and 57\n\nConversations with classic film stars\n\ngo off and make magic or Herman would trot to a corner to cook up a rewrite. It cost well under $1 million, less than budget. Completely on time. What Orson hadn’t reckoned on was the enormous power of the Hearst press, which refused all ads for the picture. [The film’s main character is a thinly disguised portrait of newspaper baron William Randolph Hearst.] So people across the country did not know it was ever on. RKO told me it would open at the Radio City Music Hall. It didn’t. Hearst phoned the Rockefellers, who owned the theater, and the offer was withdrawn. For years after, any movie I was in, the Hearst papers would “forget” to mention me in the reviews. We got nine nominations, but on Oscar night the audience booed mere mention of the title. It got one award—for best original screenplay. Citizen Kane ended up losing money for RKO. It broke Orson’s spirit. But in an odd way it made me, and I just kept on going even when Orson couldn’t take it anymore. Bawden: Some people think Welles’s follow-up film, The Magnificent Ambersons [1942], was an even better picture. Cotten: We thought that when we were making it. It was more expensive to make and the costumes were expensive. Much of the house was built as a fully working house. I mean, walls wouldn’t move out so our cinematographer, Stanley Cortez, had a hell of a challenge lighting scenes. One problem: it had no stars to entice patrons into the theater. We shot it very quickly, as I recall. I loved my part. Dolores Costello was so beautiful it was easy imagining I was in love with her. Orson wrote the script in two weeks using great gobs of dialogue from the book. When Anne Baxter came from Fox [to play] Lucy, she was accompanied by a guardian [because she was legally a minor]. It was Frank Lloyd Wright, her grandfather, the great architect. Orson showed him the footage already shot and Frank said, “Magnificent architecture. Story so-so.” For the scenes in winter, we shot in an icehouse so you could see our breath. And, yes, it is true—Agnes Moorehead’s hysterical scene on the stairs was shot a number of different ways, all believable. Aggie is that kind of actress, you see. We were shooting on December 7, 1941, Pearl Harbor day. That’s what killed us: American war anxiety. Suddenly the problems of a turn-of-thecentury family in Indianapolis became completely irrelevant. The first preview was before a bunch of louts expecting a Hopalong Cassidy western. Instead they got this strange film without titles at the beginning and an unseen narrator. They hollered back at the picture and the RKO [brass] 58\n\nJoseph Cotten\n\nheard about it and ordered it be cut down to eighty minutes. Bob Wise, our editor, stretched it to eighty-eight minutes, but at least forty minutes was lost. And the picture tanked with the public. Orson’s short reign as a golden boy was over. Bawden: Didn’t you write the screenplay for his next film, Journey into Fear? Cotten: I used so little of the plot the novelist, Eric Ambler, later thanked me, saying he could sell the story again for another movie. By this time Orson was in love with Dolores Del Rio [the film’s leading lady]. The adjective “orchidaceous” applies to her. Being the world’s most beautiful woman made her quite childlike about everything. She lived in a house straight out of Omar Khayyám. It was the last Mercury production. RKO hated it so. [The studio took Welles off the picture, which was finished by Norman Foster.] I thought it was made too fast because Orson wanted to get out of RKO as quickly as possible. And he got his wish. Bawden: How did David Selznick pick you up? Cotten: Blame my agent. Leland shopped me around town. David seemed mildly interested, so I went out to meet him at his Culver City office. Parts of the sets from Gone with the Wind were up all over the lot. I later met him at the swimming pool at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel. David liked to operate out in the open so people could see him. He’d produced two Oscar-winning movies in a row, Gone with the Wind and Rebecca, and then went into this three-year funk. Didn’t make a single movie, but he had all these hot stars under contract—Joan Fontaine and Ingrid Bergman and was about to hire Jennifer Jones and Shirley Temple. Bawden: First impressions? Cotten: A bulky, ugly man. Warts all over the place, bulbous nose, glasses that didn’t suit him. Talked a mile a minute. But he made a grand pitch for me. I told Leland I’d sign and it changed my career. In typical Selznick fashion, he had me making two movies at once: Gaslight for MGM with Ingrid Bergman and Since You Went Away right up the street, for him, with Claudette Colbert. When I’d tell him how tiring it all was, he’d slip me some Benzedrine, which I definitely would not take. I realized he thrived under the pressure of deadlines. Anything less and he’d become positively lethargic. And also he was beginning to fall for Jennifer in a way that surprised and disturbed her. After all, she was married to Robert Walker at the time. Bawden: Gaslight is one of your most memorable films. 59\n\nConversations with classic film stars\n\nJoseph Cotten (left) with Charles Boyer and Ingrid Bergman in 1944’s Gaslight. Courtesy of MGM.\n\nCotten: Well, Ingrid, Charles Boyer, and even teenager Angela Lansbury all got Oscar nominations, and Ingrid even won. But not me. Where did I go wrong? For starters, we all trooped off to the screening room to watch the 1940 original, which MGM had bought and then suppressed. My part really didn’t exist in that. It was played by a very old actor and he was a retired detective who was running some kind of bicycle repair shop, as I recall. And it was very obvious from the beginning the husband was planning to kill the wife. George Cukor [who directed the MGM remake] insisted on a more nuanced interpretation. MGM never did anything by half measures. "
