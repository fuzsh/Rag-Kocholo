Click here for more info!\n\nIsland native Jessica Gallant steps into lead role in Anne\n\nP.E.I. actress Jessica Gallant is about to join an exclusive club.\n\nWhen she steps onto the stage this week in the title role in “Anne of Green Gables - The Musical”, she will become the first — and only other — Island-born actress to play the role of Anne Shirley since Gracie Finley did in 1985.\n\n“I feel a lot of responsibility. But, along with that comes a huge sense of pride,” says Gallant who is making her debut in the 50th season of the musical that previews tonight, opens Saturday and continues in the Homburg Theatre of Confederation Centre of the Arts until Aug. 29.\n\nPlaying the red-haired, freckled orphan, who is possibly one of the most recognizable characters in Canadian theatre, is a “childhood dream come true” for the lively 20-something who grew up in Ten Mile House, P.E.I., and now calls Toronto home.\n\n“I was eight or nine when I saw ‘ Anne’ for the first time. It was so vivid. It was also something that has really stuck with me. It really made a huge imprint on me.”\n\nGallant was exposed to the storybook world of “Anne” early on. Besides watching the popular musical each summer, she read all the novels in the Anne series.\n\n“I love this Island so much because I’ve grown up witnessing the beauty that Lucy Maud Montgomery talks about in her books,” says Gallant, who auditioned for and was accepted into the Confederation Centre’s Young Company after high school.\n\nThat’s where Wade Lynch first spotted the effervescent teenager.\n\nWhen she sang Bring Him Home, the heart-felt prayer from “Les Misérables”, the director was moved.\n\n“She sang it so beautifully, with such commitment and dedication, that when the audition was over, (then artistic director) Annie Allan and I looked at each other and said, ‘ one day that girl is going to play Anne.’\n\n“So, it’s been so amazing watching her come up through the ranks of theatre. Half of talent is hard work and Jessica’s got that in abundance.”\n\nCharlotte Moore, who is also making her debut as Marilla, agrees that Gallant has plenty of talent.\n\nFor Gallant, after that first summer with the Young Company, her own professional journey took her to musical theatre school at Sheridan College, studied at the New York Film Academy in Los Angeles and trained with Second City\n\nThen, three years ago, she returned to Charlottetown to play Anne’s kindred spirit, Diana, for two seasons.\n\nNow in the top role of Anne, she has to keep pinching herself to believe it’s happening.\n\n“I don’t think a lot of people get to fulfil their childhood dreams. So, as you can imagine, my eight-year-old self is bursting. It’s truly an accomplishment.”\n\nAs she prepares for opening night, that eight-year-old self is clearly bubbling through.\n\n“Anne represents everything this Island has always been — beautiful, magical, and larger than life. I am delighted to celebrate being an Islander by portraying my heroine, Anne Shirley.”\n\nJessica Gallant at the trailside cafe\n\nJessica is set to make her debut performance at the Trailside Cafe May 17th! Join her in her home town for this exciting, intimate show. Book your ticket at www.trailside.ca, Back Alley Music or call 902-676-3130. You don't want to miss this!\n\n\"Best way to experience music is within arms reach. The success of the Trailside Cafe’ & Inn was built on this factor. It is music for musicians.

This evening of music will feature current pop hits, old classics, Broadway, rock, folk, and everything in between. The night will showcase an electric band of Island musicians.\n\nFriends since childhood, Bouey and Hastelow moved to Toronto 5 years ago to pursue their careers in the arts and attend Sheridan College. Since graduating they have both been working on stages across the country. They played tragic lovers, Roger and Mimi, in Theatre Sheridan’s production of Rent at Mirvish’s Panasonic Theatre in Toronto.\n\nThe cabaret will also feature Island performers Brittany Banks, Christina Bouey, Jessica Gallant, Nathan Keoughan, Melissa McKenzie, Tessa Mossey, Mark Sampson, and Natalie Sullivan.\n\nTickets are available in person at The Guild in Charlottetown, by phone at 1-866-774-0717 or online at theguildpei.com.\n\n(The Buzz, December 2014)\n\nYour Island Anne!\n\nPEI's Jessica gallant cast as Anne of Green Gables for 2015 Charlottetown Festival\n\nAnne of Green Gables will be played by an Islander for the upcoming 2015 Charlottetown Festival at the Confederation Centre of the Arts.\n\nJessica Gallant, who played Diana Barry in the last two seasons of the festival, has been cast as the title redhead.\n\n“Words cannot express how excited I am to fulfill this childhood dream,” said Gallant. “Anne represents everything this Island has always been — beautiful, magical, and larger than life. I am delighted to celebrate being an Islander by portraying my heroine, Anne Shirley.”\n\nGallant is one of three Islanders who were announced Wednesday in a news release revealing details for the next season of the world’s longest-running annual theatre production. Hank Stinson will play Matthew Cuthbert and Glenda Landry has been cast as Rachel Lynde.\n\nCharlotte Moore, the daughter of the festival’s first artistic director, Mavor Moore, will portray Marilla Cuthbert.\n\nDirected by Wade Lynch, the \"classic inspired from a classic’\" will feature all new leads in the six main roles next year. The roles of Gilbert Blythe and Diana Barry are still to be cast.\n\nGallant will be the 17th performer to play the irrepressible orphan and just the second native Islander, following in Gracie Finley’s footsteps. Gallant is a four-year veteran of the festival, having played Diana Barry from 2013-2014 and appearing in Evangeline; Canada Rocks and with the 2010 and 2012 Confederation Centre young companies.\n\n“It is a great pleasure to introduce P.E.I.'s own Jessica Gallant as our new Anne of Green Gables,” says Adam Brazier, artistic director of the Charlottetown Festival. “Jessica is a shining example of Confederation Centre and the local community building futures together. She was a dedicated member of our young company and soon graduated to the role of Diana. We look forward to seeing her bring her extraordinary skill, spirit and imagination to this iconic role.”\n\nThe daughter of Allan and Darlene Gallant of Ten Mile House, Gallant studied at Sheridan College and appeared on national TV singing the anthems at a pair of Toronto Blue Jays games in past seasons. She will also be seen in the Atlantic Canadian premiere of Alice Through the Looking-Glass at the 2015 festival.\n\nTickets are available at the box office at 902-566-1267, toll free at 1-800-565-0278; or at charlottetownfestival.com.\n\n(The Guardian, October 2014)\n\nGallant To Appear in Toronto's Staged Reading of Dogfight, The Musical\n\nJessica's Toronto Debut\n\nDOGFIGHT, the hauntingly beautiful musical by Pasek and Paul (Edges, James and the Giant Peach, A Christmas Story) and Peter Duchan, will receive it's Toronto debut in the form of a staged reading, December 1st and 2nd at TRANZAC (292 Brunswick Avenue), produced by Kelly Holiff and Jason Spetter.

A very professional but modestly budgeted operation – and their venue The Guild, continuing to defy its architectural limitations by somehow successfully mounting another honest-to-gosh musical within the compact, pillar-studded confines of a former bank turned arts nexus. Much like Charlie Brown’s dog Snoopy playing baseball, it makes no sense, but somehow it works.\n\nThe same could be said of the musical itself. A gag-a-day strip like Peanuts is unlikely musical fodder at best, and Gesner’s day-in-the-life script is more an episodic mix of interlinked vignettes than a coherent story per se, but Schulz’s characters are so vivid and charming that it all adds up to an entertaining whole in spite of itself.\n\nThose characters include lovable loser Charlie Brown (played by David Light), crabby diva Lucy van Pelt (director Brieonna Locche), her precociously wise little brother Linus (Andrew German), Beethoven-obsessed piano prodigy Schroeder (musical director Noah MacDougall), Snoopy (choreographer Tyrell Witherspoon) and Charlie’s little sister Sally (Jessica Gallant), who replaced early Peanuts character Patty in the musical’s cast of characters during a 1999 revamp of the show.\n\nThe cast are uniformly superb, though the ladies lead the pack. Gallant is the most convincingly and endearingly childlike performer of the bunch, and the fiercely funny Loche is so eerily perfect as Lucy it’s like she was genetically engineered in some cartoon laboratory for the role. Then again, Loche’s years playing a flawless Josie Pye in Anne & Gilbert might have something to do with it, too, since both characters are an amusingly volatile mix of vanity, anger and aggressive unrequited love (Josie for Gilbert and Lucy for Schroeder).\n\nLoche also does a great job directing the whole shebang, though the unsung hero of the show may well be set designer Shawn Arsenault. His impressively durable and deceptively simple structures and backdrops fit well into the snug stage confines and perfectly replicate key images from the comic strips, right down to the thick squiggly outlines typical of Schulz’s inking. It’s the perfect packaging for one of the best and most entertaining musicals staged on PEI in years, hopefully the first of many Head First productions.\n\n(The Buzz, March 2014)\n\nA New Kindred Spirit\n\nJessica Gallant changes passion from soccer to musical theatre, Lands Lead Role at Charlottetown Festival\n\nIf anybody had told Jessica Gallant three years ago that she was going to play Anne’s kindred spirit in Anne of Green Gables – The Musical, she would never have believed it.\n\nThat’s because, at the time, the resident of Ten Mile House, P.E.I., was planning to dedicate her life to sports.\n\n“I was playing soccer day in and day out, training with the Canada Games team. I was planning to go to St. Thomas University (in the fall) to study the arts and play soccer,” says the Morell Regional High School graduate.\n\nHowever, her career plans changed after spending that summer with the Confederation Centre Young Company.\n\n“That experience changed my life. It inspired my love of theatre,” says Gallant, who is making her professional debut this summer as Diana Barry in Canada’s longest running musical about the little red-haired orphan girl who finds love and acceptance in the Avonlea home of Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert.\n\nPerforming on stage in Canada’s longest running musical is totally different than playing on a soccer field, she laughs.\n\n“It’s totally exhilarating. It also means so much to perform a role that means so much. I’m working with some of the most talented people in the entertainment industry, people like Chilina Kennedy and Adam Brazier (stars of Evangeline) and Katie Kerr (star of Anne of Green Gables), who has been wonderful to work with,” says Gallant.\n\nThe feeling is mutual, says her on-stage kindred spirit.\n\n“It has been an absolute joy working with Jess this summer. She is so energetic and spunky. She embodies Island life and hospitality in her work and her everyday life. She is Diana personified,” says Kerr.\n\nGallant’s journey to the stage began in the summer of 2010.\n\n“I had always enjoyed watching the young company perform each year. I was always in awe of the people who got to perform on that stage every day. I also enjoyed acting,” says Gallant, who was looking for a summer job.\n\nSo, on impulse, she decided to submit an application for the Young Company.\n\n“Randomly, I was on the Confederation Centre website and it said it was the deadline for the young company — the day you had to have your resume and head shot sent in. So my mother and I raced into (the Charlottetown Festival) office and dropped it off.\n\n“Then I auditioned for it, just on a whim, and amazingly I got in. And that’s when everything completely changed,” she says.\n\nChanging course on her previously charted waters, she applied and was accepted into Sheridan College’s musical theatre program.\n\nThen, after a year at school, she returned to the Young Company to learn even more about the creative process.\n\n“Working with people like Annie Allan and Wade Lynch was incredible. For example, at the end of the summer they would do an audition panel so they could see our growth. That experience helped me get my foot in the door,” says Gallant.\n\nFollowing her graduation and stint with Feast Dinner Theatre, fast forward to this summer, where she is putting all her confidence and skills to the test in one of Canada’s most coveted roles.\n\n“Getting to portray the friendship between Anne and Diana and seeing the reaction of the little girls in the front row is one of the greatest experiences I’ve ever had. Their eyes are so big end of the show. It’s so rewarding,” says Gallant.\n\nThe biggest challenge?\n\nPlaying the scene (which is a favourite one for many audience members), where Anne accidentally serves Diana currant wine instead of raspberry cordial.\n\nIn just five on-stage minutes, she has to go from being a prim and proper 10-year-old visiting her best friend to a giddy drunk, who ends up running off stage to be sick.\n\n“Marsha Kash is such a wonderful director because she let me try new things .... So, I get to explore Diana extremely well in that scene,” says Gallant who plans to take the next step in her theatrical journey when the show closes on Sept. 25.\n\n“I’m planning to go to California for a workshop for film acting. I’m also taking singing lessons because you can never stop learning in this industry. I’ll also audition for the things that I see.\n\n“So we’ll see where things go from here.”\n\nAT A GLANCE\n\nUp close and personal with Jessica Gallant\n\nFavourite food: Her mother’s spaghetti and meat sauce.\n\nFavourite books: The Help or The Alchemist.\n\nFavourite movie: The Lion King.\n\nFavourite part in Anne: The drunk scene, egg and spoon race.\n\nFamily: Allan and Darlene Gallant, two sisters (one older, one younger), brother-in law\n\nClaim to fame: Sang at two Toronto Blue Jays Games at the Rogers Centre last fall.\n\nAdvice to young people considering a career in theatre: “Follow your dreams.

To be working with such an amazing cast and production team is a dream come true.”\n\nThe daughter of Allan and Darlene Gallant of Ten Mile House, P.E.I., Gallant is currently studying at Sheridan College and has spent two seasons performing with the Confederation Centre Young Company (Les Feux Follets, Abegweit: The Soul of the Island). She appeared on national television this past fall, singing the Canadian and American anthems for a pair of Toronto Blue Jays games at Rogers Centre. Gallant will also be cross-cast in Evangeline this festival season.\n\n(The Guardian, 2014)\n\nIslander to sing at blue Jays Closing Game in Toronto\n\nJessica Gallant of Ten Mile House will perform at two games"
