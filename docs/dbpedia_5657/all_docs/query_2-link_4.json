In Apr 1947, according to HR, Byron Morgan filed a $50,000 lawsuit against Columbia, charging that the studio did not give him proper authorship credit in publicity and advertising materials. The outcome of the suit has not been determined.

John's dream of flying is nearly lost one day when he suffers a dizzy spell and collapses. After being told by a doctor that his dizzy spells will preclude him from ever flying, John feels that he has been denied his true passion and becomes despondent. John later regains his confidence in the glider project when parachutist Dan Mahoney, who performs at carnivals under the name \"Professor LaSalle,\" offers to test John's glider by attaching it to his hot air balloon and releasing it in mid-air. With help from Dick and Father Kenton, Dan makes a successful take-off and soars above the clouds before descending to a perfect landing. Though he later receives many letters of praise for his invention, John finds that he is broke. A short time later, Dan is killed during a test flight, and John again becomes discouraged. John's luck turns from bad to worse when a strong earthquake destroys his glider and much of Santa Clara College. The only possession John is able to salvage from the quake is his gold-panning machine, which he sells for $25,000. After marrying Regina, John is sued by a man who claims that the gold machine belonged to him and that John had no right to sell it. The lengthy trial results in a ruling in John's favor, but the expensive trial leaves him broke again. Undeterred by his misfortunes, John rebuilds his glider, and decides to fly it himself. During the flight, John suffers from another dizzy spell and loses control of the plane. The plane crashes, and John dies a few hours later.\n\nLess"
