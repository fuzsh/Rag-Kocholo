        "text": "Earlier this month, British-born but now based in Australia, Lucy Gallant released the sizzling “Devious”, a song about falling hard for the wrong person. It’s a sensual blend of soul-pop, cinematic pop, trip-hop infused with some cool vintage vibes. We were lucky enough last year to premiere the video for Lucy’s track “Rebel”, and are thrilled today to premiere the video for “Devious”.\n\nThe track is about the addictive nature of becoming obsessed with a new partner. He might be the one, but he’s definitely not the right one, as Lucy sings:\n\n“You’re no good for me\n\nYou are devious, you’re no good for me\n\nYou’re mischievous, you’re like a cigarette\n\nYou’re addictive, you’re like Coca Cola, you’re my caffeine”\n\nThe inflection on the vocals is sultry and sensuous. There’s a power and self-awareness to the journey she has embarked upon. “Devious” is a compelling listen. It was produced by the Gold Coast’s award winning producer, Josh Beattie.\n\nAn artist who has been writing songs from a very young age, Lucy gives us an insight into her latest output: “In recent years, I’ve navigated through profound losses and experiences that have deeply shaped my music. My new sound reflects how I’ve channeled these experiences into my songwriting. Stepping into my own power, I’ve discovered a reservoir of confidence. Embracing the strength of my womanhood, I’ve conquered past fears. Now, I’m ready to declare to the world: here I am, crank up the volume and listen closely to my lyrics—I have a lot to say, and I’m not afraid to say it.”\n\nThe clip was filmed entirely on Lucy’s iPhone 15 by her partner, Michael Reisener. It was filmed in the picturesque landscapes of Cairns and Kuranda, in Far North Queensland. Singing directly to the camera, it beautifully captures the intimacy and the emotion of the lyrics. Lucy’s performance, is captivating. It’s passionate, playful and emotive. The stunning background helps to heighten the atmosphere, and is a cracking example of what can be achieved with a phone camera, a good idea and an authentic performance.\n\nIf you are in Europe, then take note! Lucy is about to embark on a tour of the UK, Germany and France, kicking off at The Sound Lounge in Sutton, UK on the 25th July and finishing up in Holmfirth back in the UK on the 27th September. Head to her website for more details."
