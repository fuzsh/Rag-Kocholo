Between the Native Americans who saw their lands getting colonized and those who were determined to settle there, sometimes at any cost, history is being written. In a flamboyant fresco where multiple destinies intertwine, dreams and hopes face obstacles and cruelty to offer a cinematic spectacle of exceptional scope and emotional depth. ” — Logline[12]\n\nPlot\n\nSAN PEDRO VALLEY, 1859\n\nAn Apache war band watches from a cliffside as two surveyors and a young boy begin laying out the plots for the town of Horizon. One of the younger Apache men questions why the men would choose to do this in this spot, and his friend shrugs. Desmarais, a missionary, rides his horse across the open desert in search of Horizon, having been drawn there by a flyer for the new town. He finds a man at a ruined church who tells him that he already passed through the spot; Desmarais returns and discovers the murdered bodies of the two surveyors and a young boy. He buries the bodies and then decides to stay and continue their work. Sometime later in Montana Territory, Lucy arrives at a remote cabin and shoots the sleeping owner, James Sykes, in the chest. She releases his horse and then rides off with her baby Sam. James, barely alive, is brought back to his family’s compound. Mrs. Sykes, the family matriarch, orders James’ sons Caleb and Junior to hunt Lucy down.\n\n1863\n\nA small tent city developed at Horizon, and new settlers continued to arrive. The town celebrates in their dance hall. Frances Kittredge attends with her husband James, son Nat, and daughter Elizabeth before they all return to their home outside the town on the cliff. Late that night, the family is woken up by an attack from the Apache group, who proceed to burn the town to the ground and kill many residents. The locals fight back, with many dying on both sides; a group of locals reach the Kittredge house and help Frances and her family fight the Apache group until they are eventually overtaken. Frances and her daughter hide in a crawl space beneath the house, using a shotgun forced through the ground to breathe. James and Nat prepare to continue fighting outside the safety of the house. Russell, a young local, flees on horseback. The following day, the surviving townsfolk come out of hiding to survey the destruction as the Apache band returns to their mountain village. Russell arrives at nearby Camp Gallant and informs the U.S. Army about the attack. Lt. Trent Gephardt and Sgt. Major Thomas Riordan lead a group of men to Horizon to survey the damage and help bury the bodies; Gephardt informs the surviving residents that the location of the town made them easy targets for the Apache.\n\nAt the Apache settlement, Pionsenay, a younger tribe member, argues with tribe elder Tuayeseh about the attack on Horizon. Tuayeseh is concerned the attack will only lead to retaliation on their tribe, and he prefers peace, but Pionsenay is adamant that he will not live a life hiding in the mountains, and he believes that they must fight back. Tuayeseh banishes Pionsenay from the village along with a group of other men, including Taklishim, who share the same belief. Taklishim argues with his wife about how his actions have led to so many widows and orphans, although she eventually agrees to join him. Tuayeseh is visited by his son, who reveals he has decided to join Pionsenay; Tuayeseh accepts the decision and says they will meet again one day. Tuayeseh then has a conversation in English with a second son about the situation. Riordan informs Russel that his parents have died. Chavez, a Pima Indian scout working with the army, leads a group of men to try and track the Apache group. Chavez returns to town and discovers the crawl space between the Kittredge house, leading a rescue effort that eventually frees Frances and Elizabeth. Gephardt instructs the town’s survivors to leave Horizon and make a new home at Camp Gallant. Elizabeth and Frances discover that James and Nat have died and bury them before departing with the army for Gallant. Elias Janney informs Gephardt that he and a group of men, including Russell, are going to set out after the Apache for revenge and to collect their scalps; Gephardt suggests this is a bad plan but lets them leave as there is no official law in the territory.\n\nLucy, now going by the name Ellen Harvey, lives in a small mining town with her son and husband, Walter Childs; the family shares a home with Marigold, a prostitute. Horse trader Hayes Ellison arrives in town with a group of men, and Marigold instantly sets her sights on him, flirting with him at the general store and letting him know the town’s secrets. Marigold refuses to take no for an answer and persuades Hayes to meet her at her house that evening. Lucy and Walter prepare to leave town for Walter’s business, reluctantly leaving Sam at home under Marigold’s care. Frances and Elizabeth adjust to life at Camp Gallant and thank Gephardt for his help in their rescue. Gephardt and Riordan meet with Col. Albert Houghton; Houghton disagrees with Gephardt’s attempt to dissuade settlement at Horizon, sharing an alternate belief that the white men outnumber the Native population and will one day make it their home no matter what, even if some lives are lost in the process. Lucy and Walter arrive at a cabin for their land deal but are surprised to discover it is a set-up orchestrated by Caleb and Junior. The brothers inform Lucy they plan to take her and her son back to their father, who is still alive. Walter tries to step in, but Caleb hits him in the back of the head, killing him instantly. Lucy tries to escape, but her attempt is quickly foiled, though Caleb and Junior begin to fight as Junior is angry that they now have to bury Walter’s body. Junior sends Caleb to the mining town, where he meets Hayes on the street; Caleb follows Hayes as he walks and taunts him incessantly while Hayes remains largely silent. Caleb follows Hayes to Marigold’s home, and the two engage in a shootout, with Hayes killing Caleb. Hayes flees town quickly and agrees to take Marigold and Sam with him.\n\nWESTERN KANSAS\n\nMatthew Van Weyden leads a wagon train across the Santa Fe Trail. Members of the group include upper-class British couple Juliette Chesney and Hugh Proctor, as well as the extended family of James Kittredge, which includes Owen Kittredge and his daughter Diamond. While stopped for a rest and to fix broken wheels, a horse goes wild, but Diamond steps in to free him from his reign and avoid an accident. Matthew scolds Hugh and Juliette for not helping the group enough; Juliette stands up to Matthew while Hugh quickly demurs and agrees to be more helpful. Matthew discovers two Pawnee scouts are tracking the caravan and decides to be cautious and round up the caravan early for the night to protect them in case of an attack. Juliette uses some of the group’s drinking water to bathe herself and is caught naked by two young men. Hugh tries to convince Matthew to discipline the men, but Matthew instead scolds Hugh and Juliette for using the limited water to bathe. Matthew goes to talk with the two men who refute the accusation and refuse to accept orders from Matthew; later at night, they watch Hugh and Juliette in their wagon from afar.\n\nCast and characters\n\nKevin Costner[13] as Hayes Ellison[14], a loner who attempts to mind his own business.

Production was set to start in Utah on August 29. Casting for the expansive film was to begin in February 2022.[7] On April 18, 2022, it was revealed that Warner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema had joined Horizon to distribute. Costner co-wrote the script with Jon Baird.[8] In a June interview, Costner stated he plans to make four movies out of the premise, and was looking to cast over 170 speaking roles.[29] Production on the film costed around $53,925,008 USD.[10] On June 9, 2022, the website Deseret News reported that five films were in the Horizon film series.[30] On May 18, 2023, in an interview while talking about Horizon, Costner stated, \"I commissioned this story in 1988. Single movie, two-hander. A conventional Western with a beginning, middle, and end. I couldn’t get anybody to make it. Then, right after I made Open Range and it performed pretty well, I had a chance with Disney. We had a $5 million difference. They had had a lot of money success with Open Range, but a $5 million difference kept them from making this movie. Now, I’m stubborn, and I think probably Francis is too. Eight years later, I started thinking about the story, started writing with a partner, and it ended up being four screenplays. So I reverse-engineered everything from 1988. I thought it was really good. But I still couldn’t get anybody to make it.\" Also during the interview, he was asked about releasing the film to which he stated, \"I hope it comes out in the fall. I’d like to take it to the Venice Film Festival.\"[31] On July 10, 2024, following the misfire of Chapter 1 over the July 4th box office frame, the second film has been delayed from the August 16th release date. Given the movie’s 50+ leaning audience and how they’re slow to come to cinemas, the filmmakers wanted to give that audience time to find the first movie whether that be in home or in theaters.[5]\n\nFilming\n\nPrincipal photography began on August 29, 2022 in southern Utah.[7][13] Portions of filming was shot in and around Moab, Utah.[32] Filming also took place in Emery County, Grand County, Kane County, San Juan County, Washington County.[10] Filming concluded on November 18.[33][34]\n\nCasting\n\nIn January 2022, Kevin Costner was set star.[7] In August 2022, Sienna Miller, Sam Worthington, Jamie Campbell Bower, Luke Wilson, Thomas Haden Church, Jena Malone, Alejandro Edda, Tatanka Means and Michael Rooker joined the ensemble cast.[13][20][35][15] In September 2022, Isabelle Fuhrman, Ella Hunt, Jeff Fahey, Tom Payne, Abbey Lee, Wasé Chief, Tim Guinee, Michael Angarano, Colin Cunningham, Scott Haze, Angus Macfadyen, Douglas Smith and Jon Beavers joined the ensemble cast.[24][21][26][17] In October 2022, Will Patton, Owen Crow Shoe and Danny Huston joined the ensemble cast.[23][18][16] In November 2022, Kevin Costner revealed that his son, Hayes Costner would appear in the Horizon franchise. \"He's very good,\" says Costner. \"Hayes plays the namesake character that I actually play in the movie. He's 13 years old and the screenplay's been around longer than that.\"[27] On June 30, 2023, Austin Archer was revealed to have been cast in the franchise. Archer has already shot his scenes for the first and second film.[28]\n\nMusic\n\nMain article: Horizon (soundtrack)\n\nThe film's official score was originally composed by American-Turkish rock band HIV and composer Lisbeth Scott.[36] In August 2023, John Debney was revealed to be scoring the film, which has a 1950s-syle musical score.[1][9]\n\nRelease\n\nHorizon: An American Saga Part 1 was released theatrically on June 28, 2024 in the United States, being distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures.[4] The film was originally set to be released theatrically in 2023.[36] Kevin Costner stated that he wanted the first film to be released in the fall, at the Venice Film Festival in Italy ranging from Wednesday, August 30, 2023 to Saturday, September 9, 2023.[31] Costner revealed that his intention is for the films to come out every three months.[28] In October, it was announced that K5 International, the recently relaunched international sales arm of K5 Media Group, would handle international sales on the film at the American Film Market.[2] In April 2024, it was announced that the first part of the film would premiere out of competition at the Cannes Film Festival on May 19, 2024[3], where it received an 11-minute, 40-second ovation after the credits began rolling at the Grand Théâtre Lumière.[37][38]\n\nOn July 16, 2024, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment released Horizon: An American Saga – Chapter 1 on digital streaming platforms such as Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV.[5] It will possibly stream on Max in the future.\n\nReception\n\nBox office\n\nAs of July 5, 2024, An American Saga – Part 1 has grossed $18.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $552,834 in other territories, for a worldwide total of $19.1 million.[39][40]\n\nIn the United States and Canada, An American Saga – Part 1 was released alongside A Quiet Place: Day One, and was projected to gross $10–15 million from 3,334 theaters in its opening weekend.[41][42] The film made $4.1 million on its first day, including $800,000 from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $11 million, finishing in third behind Inside Out 2 and A Quiet Place: Day One.[43] In its second weekend the film made $5.4 million (a drop of 51%), finishing in sixth.[44] Losing nearly 750 theaters in its third weekend the film made $2.4 million, finishing in seventh.[45]\n\nCritical response\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 47% of 121 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.6/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Kevin Costner doesn't lack for ambition as he sketches this frontier saga across the widest of canvases, but Horizon's first chapter proves too diffuse in scope for it to satisfy as a self-contained endeavor.\"[46] On review aggregator Metacritic, the film was assigned a score of 48 out of 100, based on 45 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[47] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B–\" on an A+ to F scale.[43]\n\nBilge Ebiri of Vulture gave a reservedly positive review of Chapter One, likening its incomplete nature to the 2021 film Dune: Part One and stating that \"Its stately pace never feels boring, so it doesn’t feel like it should have been shorter. But it also doesn't really work on its own.... And it feels impossible to judge this film, because, in some weird way, it doesn't feel like anything has really happened yet.\"[48]\n\nA review at RogerEbert.com wrote, \"Even with the cataclysmic scenes of death, the first hour does little to endear these characters. They’re disparate people whose connections aren’t immediately clear and only become vaguely obvious toward the picture’s conclusion.\", and further noted,\"While the first film in the possible “Horizon” series does well in setting up future pictures, continuing the momentum Costner gained before he left “Yellowstone,” this single film is a chore to sit through. It rarely gives viewers what they want: seeing Costner on the open range. It gives us few memorable characters outside of Costner: I can’t remember the name of a single figure without looking at my notes.\"[49] Forbes was more positive and found the film had a \"great sense of place\"[50] while The Guardian found the film was \"an unapologetically old-school western\".[51] The BBC website was very critical and described the film as a non-film: \" It's like the tantalising pilot episode of a television series – but a pilot episode that drags on and on for three hours.\"[52]\n\nA mixed review in Esquire, however, expressed hope about the sequels.[53] Addressing the duration and the serialization of the film, Owen Gleiberman of Variety adopted the opposite approach: \"Yet I think the idea is that the design of it all will come into focus as we see “Horizon: An American Saga — Chapter 2” (later this summer), and then, at some point, “Chapter 3” (which is now scheduled) and maybe, if all goes according to plan, more chapters. I seriously hope not. I’m not sure how much juice there is to squeeze out of these characters, but even if there is some I don’t want to see movies turn into television. Just about every Western of the studio era came in at two hours or less, and so did most of the revisionist Westerns (and some of those were complicated). There’s a reason for that. It’s all the time they needed.\"[54]\n\nSequels\n\nIn June 2022, Costner stated he plans to make four Horizon films in total, shot back-to-back.[29] In November 2022, Costner confirmed that the first film had been completed, and that the second had been greenlit, set to be filmed in Spring 2023.[55] Production for the second film was commenced by April 2023, with Glynn Turman, Kathleen Quinlan and Giovanni Ribisi joining Costner, Sienna Miller, Sam Worthington, Ella Hunt, Will Patton, Luke Wilson, Isabelle Fuhrman and Thomas Haden Church who continue on, while director of photography J. Michael Muro, production designer Derek R. Hill, editor Miklos Wright and costume designer Lisa Lovaas also return.[56] The second film finished production in Summer 2023, with the production of the third and fourth film being paused because of the 2023 WGA writers and the 2023 SAG-AFTRA actors strike.[57] One month following the completion of the previous installment, Costner began filming a montage sequence that features scenes from Chapter 3.[58] Costner stated that principal photography commenced on May 13, 2024; explaining that production had initially been planned to commence on April 25, before being moved to May 6 in order to accommodate funding.[59] Chapter Four is currently in production.[59]\n\nIn June 2024, Costner stated that Giovanni Ribisi's character, H. Silas Pickering, appeared in the ending montage of the first film as a way to tease what's next in the saga, while saying that H. Silas Pickering will be a supporting character in the next film, but will become a main character in the third and fourth films, potentially as the villain of the saga.[60]\n\nNotes & Trivia\n\nTBA\n\nGallery\n\nPosters\n\nPromotional\n\nCharacter portraits\n\nBehind the scenes\n\nVideos\n\nHorizon: An American Saga – Chapter 1 on Wikipedia\n\nHorizon: An American Saga Part 1 on the Internet Movie Database"
