        "text": "cal drama frames a remark\n\nable performance by Olivia de\n\nHavilland.\n\nOlivia plays the dual role of twin\n\nsisters, identical in appearance and\n\nopposed in character. Her interpre\n\ntation is so thoughtful and subtle\n\nc—r- a -i-i- that each girl becomes\n\nO I A I l a clear-cut personality\n\nearly in the film. That\n\nproduction trick of identity jewels to\n\ndistinguish the pair is unnecessary.\n\nIn fact, Olivia's is the Academy Award\n\nwork of the year — whether she wins\n\nor not.\n\nThe Dark Mirror itself, from Uni\n\nversal-International, is a quiet, dis\n\ntinguished production, which obtains\n\nan extraordinary amount of suspense\n\nwith the minimum of action. I have\n\nonly one quarrel with the script: it\n\ngives the game away too soon.\n\nRobert Siodmak's clever, low-keyed\n\ndirection is as unusual as his cast.\n\nThe psychiatrist who solves the mys\n\ntery — which twin committed a mur\n\nder — is played by Lew Ayres. Four\n\nyears older, graver and thinner, Ayres\n\ndoes a fine, sensitive, and charming\n\njob.\n\nThomas Mitchell, as the detective\n\nwho asks the psychiatrist's help — the\n\npolice know that one of the twins is\n\nguiltv from the start — is in excellent\n\nform. But then, it's a long time since\n\nMitchell has had so good a story.\n\nTo Sum Up: One of . the best in\n\nits class.\n\nDanger Signal\n\nIT'S ABOUT: A scoundrel.\n\nYOU'LL SEE: Zachary Scott\n\nAS an encore for Mildred Pierce,\n\nWarners make Zachary Scott\n\nagain a vicious philanderer — in a\n\ndarkly inferior melodrama. Its story:\n\nr- k a i-m i-\\ r- Zachary insinuates\n\nEMPIRE himself into a fam-\n\nily, makes love to\n\ntwo sisters in turn, takes a toss over\n\nthe cliff. Most peculiar points: the\n\n. corny dialogue, the bad work of Faye\n\nEmerson and Mona Freeman. Re\n\ndeeming points: Zachary, and the\n\ngame psychiatrist of Rosemary de\n\nCamp.\n\nTo Sum Up: Tut-tut."
