        "text": "Key dates in NBA history:\n\nJan | Feb | Mar | April | May | June | July | Aug | Sept | Oct | Nov | Dec\n\nMarch 1, 1978\n\nJohn Drew of Atlanta committed 14 turnovers in a game at New Jersey, an NBA record. Jason Kidd of the Phoenix Suns tied the record by committing 14 turnovers against New York on November 17, 2000.\n\nMarch 1, 1981\n\nCalvin Murphy of the Houston Rockets missed a free mthrow in San Antonio, ending his NBA record consecutive free throw streak at 78. Murphy’s record was broken by Minnesota’s Micheal Williams, who put together a streak of 84 consecutive free throws through the end of the 1992-93 season. The streak eventually grew to 97, before Williams missed a FT attempt early in the 1993-94 season.\n\nMarch 1, 1986\n\nThe New York Knicks retired Hall of Famer Earl “The Pearl” Monroe’s uniform No. 15. Monroe starred on the Knicks’ 1973 NBA championship team.\n\nMarch 1, 1996\n\nAtlanta’s Lenny Wilkens became the first coach in the NBA to reach 1,000 career victories when the Hawks downed the Cleveland Cavaliers 74-68.\n\nMarch 1, 1998\n\nMiami head coach Pat Riley became the fifth coach to record 900 career wins with a 85-84 win over New Jersey.\n\nMarch 1, 1999\n\nPhiladelphia’s Larry Brown coached his 1,200th NBA game as the Sixers defeat the Washington Wizards 104-91. Brown becomes the 12th coach to coach 1,200 NBA games, joining Pat Riley, Don Nelson and Lenny Wilkens as the only active coaches with 1,200 games coached.\n\nMarch 1, 2009\n\nDeron Williams of the Utah Jazz dished 20 assists in a 112-104 win over the Golden State Warriors.\n\nMarch 2, 1951\n\nIn the first NBA All-Star Game, held at Boston Garden, “Easy” Ed Macauley of the Celtics scored 20 points to lead the East to a 111-94 victory. Macauley was named the game’s MVP.\n\nMarch 2, 1962\n\nWilt Chamberlain of the Philadelphia Warriors scored 100 points, the most ever by an NBA player in a single game, during his team’s 169-147 win over the New York Knicks in Hershey, Pennsylvania. Chamberlain shot 36-of-63 from the field and 28-of-32 from the free-throw line, to go with 25 rebounds. His 50.4 ppg scoring average in 80 games during the 1961-62 season remains an NBA record.\n\nMarch 2, 1988\n\nThe flaming basketball is adopted as Miami’s official logo from over 1,000 entries. Mark Henderson submitted the winning entry.\n\nMarch 2, 1993\n\nDenver retired the No. 7 jersey of long-time Nugget Alex English, who spent 10 1/2 of his 15 years in the NBA in the Mile High City, scoring a career total of 25,613 points.\n\nMarch 2, 2024\n\nLeBron James becomes the first player in NBA history to reach 40,000 points in a 124-114 loss to the Denver Nuggets. James drove past Michael Porter Jr. and hit a layup with 10:39 left for the historic basket in 1,475 regular-season games.\n\nMarch 3, 1985\n\nKevin McHale of the Celtics connected on 22-of-28 field goal attempts and scored a team-record 56 points in a 138-129 victory over Detroit at Boston Garden. Nine days later against Atlanta, Larry Bird set a new Celtics single-game scoring record by hitting for 60 points.\n\nMarch 3, 1986\n\nMark Aguirre of the Mavericks scored 42 points, giving him back-to-back games of 40-plus points, as he led Dallas to a 139-138 double-overtime win over Phoenix.\n\nMarch 3, 1995\n\nPhoenix forward A.C. Green moved past former NBA great Dolph Schayes and into third place on the all-time consecutive games played list, with 707, after playing 38 minutes and scoring 13 points in the Suns’ 122-118 overtime win over visiting Seattle.\n\nMarch 3, 1999\n\nMilwaukee’s Dell Curry reached 1,000 3-pointers made in a 106-78 win over the Golden State Warriors.\n\nMarch 3, 2014\n\nLeBron James of the Miami Heat scores 61 points in a 124-107 win over the Charlotte Bobcats. James made 22 of 33 shots from the field, including his first eight 3-point attempts. He had 24 points at halftime, then added 25 in the third quarter. The record-breaker came with 5:46 left, when James spun through three defenders for a layup that fell as he tumbled to the court.\n\nMarch 3, 2020\n\nSan Antonio Spurs legend and Hall of Famer Tim Duncan makes his debut as an NBA coach, serving as the Spurs’ acting head coach in a 104-103 road win against the Charlotte Hornets. Duncan was filling in for coach Gregg Popovich, who missed the game due to personal reasons.\n\nMarch 4, 1982\n\nSan Antonio’s George Gervin racked up 48 points, surpassing 19,000 career points, in a 110-101 loss to Boston.\n\nMarch 4, 1996\n\nUtah’s John Stockton hands out 11 assists during the Jazz’ 110-87 victory over Phoenix, becoming the first NBA player to collect 11,000 career assists.\n\nMarch 4, 1998\n\nArbitrator John Feerick upheld the NBA’s suspension of Latrell Sprewell for the 1997-98 season, resulting in a monetary penalty of $6.4 million, finding that the NBA’s investigation was “done in good faith and was fair and adequate.” Feerick also found “that the NBA complied with the standards of industrial due process.” He reduced the NBA’s suspension to the extent it had included approximately one month of the 1998-99 season. However, the arbitrator reinstated Sprewell’s contract with Golden State for the 1998-99 and 1999-2000 seasons, finding that the combination of a one-season suspension and a contract termination would not be appropriate under all of the circumstances.\n\nMarch 4, 2012\n\nDeron Williams of the New Jersey Nets scores 57 points in a 104-101 win over the Charlotte Bobcats.\n\nRajon Rondo of the Boston Celtics dished 20 assists in a 115-111 win over the New York Knicks.\n\nMarch 4, 2016\n\nDamian Lillard of the Portland Trail Blazers scores 50 points in a 117-115 loss to the Toronto Raptors.\n\nMarch 5, 1983\n\nGolden State’s Joe Barry Carroll scored 52 points in a 127-121 Warriors victory over the Utah Jazz.\n\nMarch 5, 1996\n\nDallas sets a then NBA record for 3-point field goal attempts (49) in a game during a 127-117 win over visiting New Jersey. George McCloud makes seven threes in an NBA record-tying 20 attempts. Michael Adams of Denver also attempted 20 3-point field goals against the Los Angeles Clippers on April 12, 1991. The mark was surpassed by the Rockets on Jan. 16, 2019 as Houston attempted 70 3-pointers.\n\nMarch 6, 1982\n\nThe Spurs defeated Milwaukee 171-166 in triple-overtime in San Antonio in what was then the highest scoring game in NBA history. The mark of 337 points was erased when Detroit beat Denver 186-184, also in triple-overtime, on December 13, 1983 for a total of 370 points.\n\nMarch 6, 2000\n\nShaquille O’Neal of the Los Angeles Lakers scored an NBA season-high 61 points to go with 23 rebounds in the Lakers’ 123-103 triumph over the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nMarch 6, 2001\n\nThe Portland Trail Blazers retired the No. 22 jersey worn by versatile guard Clyde Drexler, who played for the team for more than 11 seasons from 1983 to 1995.\n\nMarch 6, 2019\n\nWith a driving layup in the second quarter against the Denver Nuggets, LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers surpassed Michael Jordan’s 32,292 career points. In doing so, James became the fourth-leading scorer in NBA history. Despite his efforts, though, the Lakers lost the game, 115-99.\n\nMarch 7, 1974\n\nThe New Orleans Jazz (who later moved to Utah) became the NBA’s 18th franchise.\n\nMarch 7, 1995\n\nDominique Wilkins of Boston scored 19 points in the Celtics’ 115-110 loss at New York, moving him past 25,000 career points, the ninth NBA player to reach that plateau.\n\nMarch 7, 1996\n\nWith seven assists against Sacramento in the visiting Lakers’ 102-89 victory, Magic Johnson becomes the second NBA player to register 10,000 career assists.\n\nMarch 7, 2001\n\nThe Phoenix Suns retired the No. 7 jersey worn by Kevin Johnson, the immensely popular point guard who played for the team for 12 seasons and retired sixth on the NBA’s all-time assists list.\n\nMarch 7, 2017\n\nRussell Westbrook of the Oklahoma City Thunder scores 58 points in a 126-121 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nMarch 7, 2017\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks’ Dirk Nowitzki becomes the sixth member of the 30,000 all-time points club in a win over the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nMarch 8, 1971\n\nThe Milwaukee Bucks defeated Seattle 104-99 to run their winning streak to 20 straight games, the second-longest winning streak in NBA history, behind the 33 consecutive games won by the Los Angeles Lakers during the 1971-72 season. Milwaukee finished the 1970-71 season with a 66-16 record and went on to capture the NBA championship.\n\nMarch 8, 1994\n\nChicago’s Scottie Pippen and Pete Myers became the first set of teammates in NBA history to convert four-point plays (3-point field goal and free throw) in the same game, with both turning the trick in the fourth quarter of the Bulls’ 116-95 win over visiting Atlanta.\n\nMarch 8, 1996\n\nUtah coach Jerry Sloan won his 500th career NBA game after the Jazz defeated visiting Houston 109-89.\n\nMarch 8, 2006\n\nIn the first major professional sporting event in New Orleans since Hurricane Katrina devastated the city more than six months earlier, the Lakers defeat the Hornets, 113-107. A sellout crowd of 17,744 shows up at New Orleans Arena, which encountered flooding problems following one of the worst hurricanes in American history on August 29, 2005.\n\nMarch 8, 2008\n\nAtlanta defeats the Miami Heat in the first NBA “do-over” game in a quarter-century. On December 19, 2007 Atlanta’s scorer mistakenly fouled out Miami’s Shaquille O’Neal with 51.9 seconds left in overtime and the Hawks up, 114-111. Miami appealed and the league ordered the end of the game to be replayed. The game ends in anti-climactic fashion, as neither team scores. Despite having only five fouls, Shaq does not play in the redo, having been traded in the interim to the Phoenix Suns.\n\nMarch 9, 1958\n\nGeorge Yardley of the Detroit Pistons became the first NBA player to score 2,000 points in a single season.\n\nMarch 9, 1960\n\nThe Boston Celtics defeated the New York Knicks 148-128 at Boston Garden, giving the Celtics their 59th win of the season, topping the previous NBA high for wins in a season by seven. The Celtics also set NBA records during that 1959-60 season for the most field goals made per game (49.9) and field goal attempted per game (119.6) and the most rebounds per game (71.5). All three records still stand more than 40 years later.\n\nMarch 9, 1979\n\nDetroit’s Kevin Porter handed out a franchise-record 25 assists as the Pistons defeated Boston 160-117 at the Pontiac Silverdome. Porter finished the 1978-79 season with 1,099 (13.4 apg) assists, becoming the first player in NBA history to garner over 1,000 assists in a season.\n\nMarch 9, 1985\n\nFat Lever of the Denver Nuggets set an NBA record for steals in one quarter when he notched eight against the Indiana Pacers.\n\nMarch 9, 1988\n\nLos Angeles Lakers coach Pat Riley recorded his 400th career victory in a 104-99 win over the Knicks in New York, reaching the 400 victory plateau faster (540 games) than any other coach in NBA history.\n\nMarch 9, 1997\n\nUtah’s Karl Malone became the fifth player in NBA history with 25,000 points and 10,000 rebounds during a 115-106 vicotry at Minnesota.\n\nMarch 9, 1999\n\nHouston’s Hakeem Olajuwon blocks career shot No. 3,500 in game against Denver. He finishes the game with 3,503 career blocks and is the NBA’s all-time leader in blocked shots, an official statistic beginning with the 1973-74 season.\n\nMarch 9, 2000\n\nWilt Chamberlain, who played one season with the Harlem Globetrotters before moving to the NBA, has his No. 13 retired by the Globetrotters when they play at Overbrook High School in Philadelphia, Chamberlain’s alma mater. Chamberlain, who is the first Globetrotter to have his number retired, is one of five people with Globetrotters ties to be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. The four others are William “Pop” Gates, Connie Hawkins, Marques Haynes, and founder Abe Saperstein.\n\nMarch 9, 2011\n\nWith 16 points and 21 rebounds in a 101-75 win over the Indiana Pacers, Minnesota Timberwolves superstar Kevin Love records his 52nd straight double-double, breaking Moses Malone’s record for the most consecutive double-doubles since the NBA-ABA merger.\n\nMarch 9, 2016\n\nFour-time NBA All-Star Clyde Lovellette dies at the age of 86.\n\nMarch 10, 1961\n\nWilt Chamberlain of the Philadelphia Warriors became the first NBA player to score 3,000 points in a season.\n\nMarch 10, 1963\n\nWilt Chamberlain, playing for the San Francisco Warriors, scored 70 points in a 163-148 loss to Syracuse, one of six 70-plus point games in his career.\n\nMarch 10, 1985\n\nDallas coach Dick Motta became the fourth NBA coach to record his 700th career victory as the Mavericks beat New Jersey 126-113.\n\nMarch 10, 1987\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar became the NBA’s all-time leader in personal fouls committed when he charged into Denver’s Danny Schayes with 4:23 left in the first quarter of the Lakers’ 143-107 victory over the Nuggets. Referee Bruce Alexander blew the whistle on the 4,194th foul of Abdul-Jabbar’s career, which moved Abdul-Jabbar past previous leader Elvin Hayes (4,193).\n\nMarch 10, 1987\n\nRon Harper of Cleveland sets a franchise record and NBA rookie record for steals in a game with 10 during the Cavaliers’ 100-91 loss to Philadelphia at Richfield Coliseum.\n\nMarch 10, 1998\n\nHouston forwards Charles Barkley and Kevin Willis both played in the 1,000th game of their NBA careers.\n\nMarch 10, 1999\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers lost their 17th straight game to begin the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season, tying the NBA record for losses at the start of a season set by the Miami Heat in the 1988-89 season.\n\nMarch 10, 1999\n\nUSA Basketball announced the first nine players of the 1999 USA Men’s Senior National Team.

Dumars, who won two NBA championships with the Pistons, becomes the seventh member of the club to have his number raised.
