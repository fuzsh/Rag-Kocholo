        "text": "\"We'd been waiting for this case to be uncorked.\" A chilling look back at a major moment in Boston history. HBO Docs has revealed an official trailer for a documentary mini-series streaming on Max at the end of this year titled Murder In Boston: Roots, Rampage & Reckoning. Set to debut for streaming in just a few weeks in early December. From the director of Michael Jordan's \"The Last Dance\" doc series, this next one explores a polarizing 1989 murder in Boston, Massachusetts. On October 23, 1989, Charles \"Chuck\" Stuart places a frantic 911 call reporting that he and his pregnant wife, Carol, a white couple, have been shot by a Black man in Boston's Mission Hill neighborhood. This one murder case had a huge impact on the city's race relations and wider society, which is documented in detail in this doc. Made in association with The Boston Globe newspaper, the series explores the enduring, painful toll the 1989 Stuart case had on those involved, Boston race relations, and how a community can be severely affected in a rush to justice. Take a look below.\n\nOfficial trailer for HBO's doc series Murder In Boston: Roots, Rampage & Reckoning, on YouTube:\n\nThe series covers the infamous 1989 Stuart case, where, on October 23, 1989, Charles \"Chuck\" Stuart placed a frantic 911 call reporting that he and his pregnant wife, Carol, a white couple, had been shot by a Black man in Boston's Mission Hill neighborhood. The ensuing investigation proved to be a lightning rod for the city, igniting decades-old racial tensions & brutal targeting amidst a media firestorm. Thoughtfully braiding extensive archive coverage of the incident, the years leading up to it, and its aftermath, with more than a dozen present-day interviews of people affected at the time including residents, community members, journalists who covered the case, Bennett family members, city officials, and a retired Boston police officer, HBO's doc series Murder In Boston: Roots, Rampage & Reckoning chronicles the complex history of race-based hostilities in the city and explores the enduring, painful toll the Stuart case has had on the families involved, on Boston race relations, and how a community is brutalized in a rush to justice."
