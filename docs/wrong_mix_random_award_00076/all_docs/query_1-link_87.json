        "text": "So, Michael, firstly, congratulations on your debut you’ve done an amazing job, but you know that!\n\n*laughs* I know I worked hard, but you never know how people are going to receive it but I'm glad people feel like it impacted them.\n\nOh, definitely. I think it's put another level onto a sports film – sometimes they can be quite cliché, but you definitely added another element.\n\nThank you.\n\nBut while I was watching I saw what I would call the “Coogler Touch.\" You've obviously been working with Ryan for years and years and years, so I wanted to hear about how he's influenced your directing abilities right now.\n\nI mean, a lot of people influence my directing abilities, just being on set for such a long time. But seeing Ryan direct when we did Fruitvale Station gave me the confidence, I think. Seeing that representation to be able to see a guy that looks like me, close to my age, a young Black man, shooting a feature film was like, “Wow okay cool, I can do that” And he told me, “Hey, Mike, you can do this too” back then. So I think that idea and confidence grew and evolved over time. And obviously, doing the first Creed with Coog, he set the fabric and the blueprint for this, and I’m just trying to keep the essence of what the movie is, but at the same time making it my own. So it was a beautiful thing.\n\nSo you’ve spoken about how he inspired you, are you thinking about now how you're inspiring other young Black boys? I recently read that you said looking back at where you came from, you didn't think you'd be able to leave that situation and come to where you are right now. So are you looking at the people that are looking at you right now, and how they're pulling inspiration?\n\nYeah, I think naturally I try to be a good role model. I know in the position that I'm in, the eyes that are on me, and that attention and the responsibility that comes with being a filmmaker and a person that's “of interest,” or whatever you want to call it.\n\nIt's not why I really got into it, but you have to understand where you stand and I love that, so that’s why I have mentees and fellowships. I'm really big on the next generation and giving them opportunities and showing them the way, sharing information, and whatever wisdom I can impart, I try to do it. That's the only way that the world is going to change and change for the better. I want to inspire as much as I can and lead by example.\n\nI'm really following your example. I don't know if you're looking at me and thinking that you're looking in the mirror because right now I'm doing a challenge where I train like you for 30 days.\n\nThat's what I'm talking about!\n\nSo our body types at the same, right? We look identical. So what would you give to people as words of motivation when it comes to pushing on?\n\nIn life, just find something you're obsessed about. I think passion and having something you care about is extremely important, and finding out what that is can really change somebody's mindset. Just be relentless, be relentless. Life is short, we don't have a lot of time and we can't get it back, so just try to use it wisely. I try to apply that to my relationships with my family, with friends, and with things that I'm spending my time doing. Sometimes you’ve got to do what you got to do until you do what you want to do. But just know that the time you have is precious and take advantage of it."
