        "text": "AIR is the “true” story of how the Air Jordan shoe brand came to be. Those who were not adults (or in existence) in the ‘80s, like myself, may not be aware that Converse was once the top-worn shoe in the NBA. In fact, the public viewed Nike as a brand strictly for joggers. The AIR movie is the classic American underdog tale where grit overcomes all odds and leads to a successful ending. Ben Affleck, the film’s director, takes us through the inception of Nike's Air Jordan, with strong notes of wit and nostalgia, as well as an ensemble cast to die for.\n\nBut can you really make a movie about Air Jordans without Michael Jordan?\n\nI do agree with what Ben said in his interview on The Drew Barrymore Show. Affleck made the right call in not casting someone as Michael Jordan because it would be too distracting. I would be sitting there just thinking umm… that's not Michael Jordan, bro. Not to mention the story is really about Nike’s journey going from a company with practically no presence in basketball to dominating the market globally.\n\nI would, however, recommend that Netflix’s Last Dance (2020) be considered a prerequisite to seeing the AIR movie. Any Michael Jordan or basketball sports fan watched the Last Dance series during the COVID-19 pandemic at least once. If you haven’t seen it, stop reading immediately and get on that. If for no other reason than to know where the classic MJ “And I took that personally” meme came from. With all the knowledge and context from Last Dance, Jordan’s absence isn’t really that big of a deal in AIR. We already are well aware of what MJ looked like at this age, his life at the time of the draft, and how involved his parents were at this stage of his life.\n\nIt also helps to know that MJ personally signed off on the movie. Jordan has admitted that he would have practically sold his soul for a red Mercedes 380 SL at the beginning of his career. It was his mother, Deloris Jordan, that was the shrewd mastermind behind the Air Jordan deal between MJ and Nike. As for the AIR negotiations, it was MJ himself who ultimately gave Affleck his blessing to make the movie with the condition that Viola Davis play his mother. She did a phenomenal job as always.\n\nOne question that remains after seeing AIR is this, why couldn’t they cast MJ as MJ? Stay with me here, I understand that the movie is set back in the 80s and Michael Jordan has aged, with the passing of time, like all of us mortals. But what about technology? I am no Hollywood exec, but was it possible for Affleck to fit de-aging tech into the film’s budget? Marvel gave us a Robert Downey Jr. straight out of the ‘80s in Captain America: Civil War (2016) and we saw young Brad Pitt in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008). Not to mention young Charles Barkley in commercials. A commercial!\n\nIf deepfake recreations weren’t Affleck’s jam, he could have tacked on a modern day ending where we see a glimpse of the present day Jordan, putting a bow on the topic once and for all.\n\nWhy wouldn’t you just give us actual MJ as MJ? I am not sure Affleck justifies that one.\n\nEither way, AIR is definitely worth the watch. I would 100 percent see it again. I will admit I am biased toward the Boston bestie duo, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, ever since Good Will Hunting came out. Following their bromance over the years, they have not disappointed. Well, I guess except for The Last Duel, that was pretty rugged. AIR may just prove to be a new sports classic, move over Money Ball.\n\nAnd because Ben Affleck is my spirit animal I have to share a picture of my all-time favorite meme.\n\nThe ups and downs of Affleck’s life hit hard. After making some of his first real money for Good Will Hunting, he was broke again in six months. You know what, I respect it. He got some bag and had a ton of fun until he was back where he started. He is a scumbag Boston boy just like I am a scumbag Philly girl. Then to watch Affleck go from his picture-perfect life with Jennifer Garner and their three beautiful kids, to chain smoking and multiple stints in rehab, and now with JLo, but still ripping darts, this is a story we can all relate to.\n\nGo ahead and tell me I am wrong @emmiwitdahoops on IG and Twitter."
