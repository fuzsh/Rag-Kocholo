        "text": "Michael Jordan isn’t in the movie “Air,” but his influence is throughout the film.\n\nNot in the sense that the basketball legend had a role in creating the film. He didn’t. But how could director and actor Ben Affleck even consider making the film without speaking to Jordan?\n\nAffleck admitted he and Jordan are closer to acquaintances than friends. But while they don’t spend days together, Affleck, who plays Nike founder Phil Knight in the movie, said a film focusing on Jordan without Jordan’s feedback would be incomplete.\n\n“I idolize the guy, and every now and then I’ve had the chance to spend time with him,” Affleck said. “It’s been very memorable for me; he’s probably forgotten it. So, I had enough of an in to say, ‘Hey, can I come see you and run this past you?’”\n\nRegarding the movie, which tells of Nike’s recruitment and signing of Jordan to the company, Affleck said Jordan wasn’t worried about himself. His focus was on others who were influential to his career, including Howard White, a then-Nike executive who is now vice president of Jordan Brand, and George Raveling, a longtime Nike ambassador who persuaded Jordan to join Nike over other brands in 1984.\n\nLanding Jordan over more established basketball brands like Converse and Adidas changed the shoe business forever and made Nike a leader in the industry.\n\n“He wanted to make sure other people who were meaningful were included in the story,” Affleck said.\n\n“Air” premiered in theaters April 5 and grossed an estimated $20.2 million in its first week. The movie features three Academy Award winners: Affleck, Matt Damon and Viola Davis. Damon plays Sonny Vaccaro, a leader in ultimately signing Jordan to Nike. Davis plays Deloris Jordan, Michael’s mother, whom Vaccaro said was his primary lifeline during the recruiting process.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nSonny Vaccaro's belief in Michael Jordan, changing Nike, shown in new film 'Air'\n\nThe movie is a dramatization, not designed to be a detailed historical account, but Affleck wanted to be sensitive to aspects of the story and what Jordan would find important. Affleck said he would have halted the project if Jordan didn’t approve the idea of the movie. Instead, he found Jordan “gracious.” He said he asked Jordan to tell him what was “fundamentally important or true.”\n\nIn a chat with Jordan, Affleck also learned how important Deloris’ role was in the signing. Jordan is considered the greatest basketball player of all time, but the reverence he holds for his mother was clear.\n\n“Ben said, ‘He had this look on his face when he spoke about his mom that I’d never seen before,’” Damon said.\n\nJordan had a special request: He wanted Davis — one of only 18 individuals to achieve an EGOT (winning an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony) — to play his mother. To make the movie, Affleck had to create a role that one of the world’s most decorated actresses would consider.\n\n“I tried to believe it was me,” Affleck said, “but a lot of it was, ‘Michael Jordan wants you to play his mom.’”\n\nDavis was flattered from Jordan’s request and said she wanted to channel the steadiness of Deloris to do the role justice.\n\n“I do go in with a sense of, ‘Do I belong?’ imposter’s syndrome,” Davis said. “So, it’s nice to feel wanted. Then, the next thought is, now I’ve got to step into the role.”\n\nDavis’ husband, Julius Tennon, was cast as Jordan’s father, James, who was murdered in 1993. Tennon saw James as a man who was supportive of his wife and protective of his family.\n\nDavis said the dynamic in the film between her and Tennon mirrors their real life. Tennon wanted to bring dignity to the role.\n\n“He was just a simple man, blue-collar guy, and I just wanted to depict that,” Tennon said.\n\nJordan wanting to include White’s role in his recruitment to Nike meant actor/comedian Chris Tucker would be highlighted in the film. Tucker spent hours speaking with White and people from White’s childhood. He also spoke with other athletes mentored by White, including Charles Barkley.\n\nWith the film being a dramatization, Tucker was able to inject his trademark humor into White. He wanted White to come off as a positive person who had a lot of fun.\n\n“I really got a lot of information to embody his spirit,” Tucker said. “Everybody said he was like Confucius. He’s just this nice guy (who) thought about the world (as) glass half full instead of half empty.”\n\nMarlon Wayans plays Raveling and received the call about his role on a Friday. He had to be ready on set by that following Monday.\n\nHow does one prepare for a role on such short notice?\n\n“Crash course on YouTube,” Wayans said.\n\nRather than imitate Raveling, Wayans said he had freedom to be more of himself in the role.\n\nJordan not being portrayed in the film worked because so many others from the story were able to shine. Affleck likened “Air” to a parable because it was taking liberties with the story of how Jordan Brand became what it is today.\n\nDamon said the goal was to tell a good story.\n\n“We were really trying to capture the spirit of these people and this time more than anything,” Damon said. “All the people on the Nike side talk about this time with such nostalgia, and that was what we were trying to create. They were the underdog, which is a weird way to think of Nike now. The characters all had this kind of infectious energy.”\n\n(Photo of Ben Affleck, Viola Davis and Matt Damon: JC Olivera / GA / The Hollywood Reporter via Getty Images)"
