        "text": "Bova's Bakery in Boston has been open 24/7 for the last 97 years, but you won't be able to get their famous Italian bread or award-winning tiramisu this week because Matt Damon and Casey Affleck are coming to town.\n\nThe popular shop, which is located at 134 Salem Street in the middle of Boston's historic North End, announced it will be temporarily closed Monday through Friday to accommodate filming.\n\n\"I can't believe it,\" said Lauren Bova-Cole. \"First time in history that we’re closing, five days.\"\n\n\"I think it's pretty amazing,\" she added.\n\nThe family-owned bakery thanked its customers for their loyalty, patience and understanding, saying they'll see everyone on Saturday, March 25. Any online orders placed during March 20 through March 24 will not be shipped until Monday, March 27, the website noted.\n\nBoston natives Damon and Affleck will be in the city to shoot scenes at Bova's for \"The Instigators,\" an upcoming movie in which the two actors star as thieves who must go on the run after a robbery goes awry, Deadline reported.\n\n\"They go on the run with their therapist, I don’t know exactly the scene,\" Bova-Cole said. \"They're breaking some glass, doing some crazy things in there.\"\n\nLocal\n\nIn-depth news coverage of the Greater Boston Area.\n\nThe Boston Globe reports the bakery will specifically be the backdrop of a scene where an officer demands answers on a recent bank robbery.\n\n“He starts smashing all the showcases and food until someone talks, and no one says anything,” owner Ralph Bova told the Boston Globe of the production’s plans for the space. “They’re taking all my showcases out, and they’re putting in their prop showcases, but they still want my food.”\n\nThe Bova family tells us they won't be in the film but confirmed they were asked to bake some of their products to fill the pastry cases that the Hollywood stars will smash, so it really will be lights, camera, cannoli.\n\nBova admitted to the Globe that will create more work for him, joking, \"Can’t you just use a prop cannoli?”\n\nThose working on the set Monday said it will be quite the scene.\n\n\"We're doing the ovens in Bova's, and the movie is going to be Wednesday over here, they’re going to smash cases and have a good time over here,\" said Scott Stewart, with Scott Sheet Metal.\n\nJokes aside, Bova told the Globe that he's \"happy\" to let production use his space, though he's admittedly a little nervous about closing for the first time, too.\n\n“I don’t want to deprive my customers,\" he told the Globe, while also acknowledging that a little publicity never hurts.\n\nBova's wouldn't tell us exactly what they were offered to close but it's enough dough that all of their employees got to take a paid week off this week.\n\n\"I'm really excited to see the movie because it's my family's bakery,\" the youngest Bova said.\n\nBova's family bakery has been featured in movies before including “Fever Pitch,” starring Jimmy Fallon and Drew Barrymore, and “What’s Your Number,” starring Anna Faris and Chris Evans.\n\nNorth End residents and business owners previously received a notice that a feature film -- “Quincy” -- would be filming in the neighborhood, with both interior and exterior scenes shot at Bova’s Bakery. The notice said there will be parking restrictions and road closures during the time filming takes place.\n\nAccording to Deadline, “The Instigators” is an Apple original and will be produced through Damon and Ben Affleck’s recently-announced studio, Artists Equity.\n\nBova's isn't the only Boston location being featured in the film, either. NBC10 Boston cameras were rolling as they set up to shoot at City Hall over the weekend."
