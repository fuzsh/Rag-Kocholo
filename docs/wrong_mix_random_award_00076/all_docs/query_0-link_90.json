        "text": "CHICAGO - One way to measure Michael Jordan's greatness is simply to look at a photo of anguished, opened-mouthed faces.\n\nUtah fans, their expressions frozen, are cringing and grimacing as Jordan's final, championship-winning shot hangs in the air. They know the inevitable is a mere second away - the ball going in the basket as it did so often when he took a last-second shot.\n\nIt was that kind of dominance, determination and unmatched skill that earned Jordan his selection as the top basketball player of the century by a six-member panel of experts assembled for The Associated Press.\n\nOscar Robertson was second, followed by Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell and Magic Johnson.\n\nJordan's wrist-dipping follow-through after the shot against the Utah Jazz in the 1998 NBA Finals was the most fitting goodbye to a 13-year career: It defined what he did best.\n\nAs he carried the Chicago Bulls to six NBA championships, No. 23, his tongue wagging, his familiar pate shiny and sweaty, always wanted the ball when the outcome was in doubt. He felt no one could stop him and few could.\n\n\"I am truly honored by my selection as AP's basketball player of the century and feel fortunate to be considered in the same breath as people I consider to have been the greatest in this sport - Oscar Robertson, Dr. J., Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell, and others who blazed the trail that made my success possible,\" Jordan said.\n\nJordan highlights abound - from his 63-point performance in the 1986 playoffs against Boston, to his 55-point outburst against the Knicks in his fifth game back after ending his first retirement, to his 38-point game against Utah in the 1997 Finals when he was so sick he had to be helped to the bench during timeouts. Then a year later, a steal and game-winning, final-second jumper to sink the Jazz again.\n\nHe scored at least 50 points 37 times, slicing through a defense for an air-defying dunk early in his career, falling back to lift up an unblockable jumper during the Bulls' second run of three titles.\n\nHis competitive fire was unparalleled and his pride unwavering. His reputation soared like his body. His jersey and likeness beamed across the world on TV. And through a series of multimillion-dollar endorsements, he became perhaps the most recognizable figure on Earth.\n\n\"I've been asked who's the best player who ever played,\" Russell said when presenting Jordan his fifth MVP trophy in 1998. \"I will say this about you: I cannot imagine anyone playing any better than you do.\"\n\nRussell received one first-place vote and was also an AP panelist. Robertson got the other two first-place votes.\n\nThe versatile \"Big O\" could pass, score and rebound with any player, once averaging a triple-double for an entire season.\n\n\"Nobody ever did what I did for the years I did it,\" said Robertson, who starred with Cincinnati and Milwaukee in the 1960s-70s.\n\n\"Michael Jordan, when they started marketing the league, he was the king.\"\n\nThe powerful, 7-foot-1 Chamberlain was the game's greatest rebounder and once scored 100 points in a game. Russell's team play, rebounding and brilliant defense changed the game and led the Boston Celtics to 11 titles.\n\nJohnson was the game's premier open-court passer and leader of the Lakers' glitzy fastbreak offense that won five NBA titles.\n\nAt No. 6 was Larry Bird, who led the Boston Celtics to three titles. His friendly but intense rivalry with Johnson was credited with resurrecting the league in the 1980s.\n\nThe final four in the voting were: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the greatest scorer in league history with his unstoppable sky hook; the smooth and powerful Lakers forward Elgin Baylor; Jerry West, \"Mr. Clutch\" for his precise play and timely baskets; and \"Dr. J\", Julius Erving, who made dunking an art, first in the ABA and later with the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nRussell and Jordan shared a common approach. Their quest to win was obsessive and their presence inspired their teammates.\n\n\"I never thought you put the shoes and uniform on and took the night off. The thing I really, really enjoy is watching when things aren't going the way you like, and I watch you figure out ways to win,\" Russell told Jordan in 1998.\n\n\"I feel like you're a soul mate.\"\n\nJordan didn't take a night off, but he did take a 17-month respite after retiring in October 1993 following Chicago's third straight championship. Mourning the murder of his beloved father, he turned to his childhood sport of baseball.\n\nWhen that unremarkable fling ended, he returned to basketball for the end of the 1995 season, when the Bulls were knocked out in the second round of the playoffs.\n\nBut when he came back for 1995-96, so did Chicago. The greatest season in NBA history followed, 72-10, and so did three more championships.\n\nPerhaps Jordan's biggest achievement of all was proving he could leave, return and regain the top again.\n\nWhen he retired a second time in January 1999, Jordan had five MVP awards, had claimed the NBA Finals MVP trophy all six years he played, captured 10 scoring titles and finished as the No. 3 scorer in NBA history with the highest regular-season (31.5) and playoff (33.4) averages ever."
