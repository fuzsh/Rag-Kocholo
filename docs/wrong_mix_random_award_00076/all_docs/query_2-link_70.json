        "text": "Creation Entertainment does not advertise any talent without written permission from the talent or their representation.\n\nBe sure of which day a guest is doing photo ops/autographs before purchasing your admission tickets.\n\nYou must have an admission ticket for the day of your photo op and/or autograph.\n\nThanks to our fellow fans, weâve loved bringing the stars direct to their audiences for over 50 years! Join the celebration and be part of the unforgettable Creation family.Â\n\nUnlike so many other fan conventions, Creation Entertainment has a strict company policy not to \"oversell\" our conventions. In other words, every patron, no matter what bracket of ticket they purchase, will have a seat in the main auditorium where the major guests appear and events take place.Â\n\nCreation Entertainment has the right to refuse service to anyone who interferes with the safety and well-being of other patrons, staff, actors, Creation Entertainment and the establishment itself. This includes, but is not limited to, harassment of any kind both in advance and/or at a particular event, illegal activity, unreasonable rowdiness, patrons lacking adequate hygiene and inconsideration to others. Refusal of service shall never be based on race or color, National origin or citizenship status, religion or creed, sex, age, disability, pregnancy or genetic information, Veteran or Military status, marital status, sexual orientation or gender identity, medical condition (excluding infectious diseases), political affiliations or activities, or status as a victim of domestic violence, assault or stalking."
