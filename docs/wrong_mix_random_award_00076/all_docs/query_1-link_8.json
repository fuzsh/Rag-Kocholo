        "text": "Ben Affleck likes to say “Air,” his new movie about Nike’s game-changing signing of Michael Jordan, is a family-style affair with old friends, including Matt Damon, in front of and behind the camera.\n\nBut it’s Affleck, 50, who’s done the lion’s share of work. He produced, cast and directs this, his fifth film, and also wins laughs as Nike’s legendary and legendarily eccentric founder Phil Knight.\n\n“Air” has already won acclaim for its storytelling, humor and heart. Damon, 52, carries the saga as Nike marketing agent Sonny Vaccaro who ferociously advocates — against intense Nike indifference — to signing rookie Michael Jordan.\n\n“This was a group of people that I knew and had a lot of respect for and worked with often and adore and admire,” Affleck said during a Zoom conference. “This movie is a massive failure if it’s just my voice.”\n\nWhile “Air” did not buy rights to Jordan’s story, Affleck wanted the legend’s blessing. “I didn’t understand the movie until I went to talk to Michael. I had to say, ‘Can I run this past you?’ because from a selfish point of view, the stupidest thing would be to make a movie that tells part of his story and if he was opposed to it, there was no movie.\n\n“I found he’s very gracious. I said, ‘Look, this is not historically accurate. It’s a fable, a parable, an inspiring story, so I’m going to take liberties. But I don’t want to violate anything that’s true to you.\n\n“He wanted to make sure other people were accounted for. That’s why Howard White” – a Nike Air Jordan basketball executive and Jordan’s personal friend – “is integral to this. Chris Tucker came in and created this role of Howard White.\n\n“Initially,” Affleck added, “I was to make it a story about Michael himself saying [during negotiations], ‘This is what I deserve.’ His parents weren’t part of the story. But when he said, ‘I didn’t want to go to Portland’” – Nike’s headquarters – “and this is an intimidating powerful man! It’s like being around someone as close to a deity as you’ll find. At this movement I saw awe, adoration and respect when he talked about his mother.\n\n“When I heard it I realized right away this is the story about Deloris Jordan! She’s emblematic of so many mothers of athletes and entertainers. It requires an enormous amount of guidance.\n\n“And who should play your mom? He said, ‘It HAS to be Viola Davis’ – it has to be the very best. And it was incumbent on us to create a role she would say yes to.”\n\nHe did.\n\n“Air” opens April 5"
