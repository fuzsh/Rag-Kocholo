        "text": "No one is too cool for a Slurpee. Not even a Tony and Emmy Award-winning actress and singer.\n\nBroadway star Kristin Chenoweth gushed over the iconic treat this week at, of all places, a Boston 7-Eleven. On Slurpee Day 2024 (which fell on the eleventh day of the seventh month), Chenoweth whipped up her ideal version of the carbonated slushie: half dragonfruit, half Coke.\n\nIt was perfection. Chenoweth was beyond pleased.\n\n\"This is a beautiful, clean 7-Eleven in Boston,\" she told her Instagram audience. \"Boston, y'all rock. I love it here.\"\n\nChenoweth is in Massachusetts rehearsing for The Queen of Versailles, which will have its pre-Broadway premiere at Boston's Emerson Colonial Theatre July 16 to August 25.\n\nREAD MORE: New Bedford Woman Taught Barbra Streisand to Dance on Broadway\n\nThe show, based on a book and documentary, is a musical exploring fame, fortune and family. It reunites Chenoweth with Steven Schwartz, who created the music for Wicked. Chenoweth was the first to play Glinda in that long-running Broadway success.\n\nFrom computer engineer to Mrs. Florida to billionairess, Jackie Siegel sees herself as the embodiment of the American Dream. Now, as the wife of David \"The Timeshare King\" Siegel and mother of their eight children, she invites us to behold their most grandiose venture yet: building the largest private home in America - a $100 million house in Orlando, Florida, big enough for her dreams and inspired by the Palace of Versailles. But with the Great Recession of 2008 looming, Jackie and David's dreams begin to crumble, along with their lavish lifestyle.\n\nChenoweth managed to sneak some time away from the stage to enjoy one of life's simple pleasures. A Slurpee and a skilled opera singer might seem a strange combination, but Chenoweth has a sincere obsession with 7-Eleven.\n\nDuring an appearance on The Kelly Clarkson Show in 2023, the peppy Oklahoma-born star raved about the Slurpee and the chain's other offerings.\n\n\"You can get all kinds of food, any snack you want. You can get a light bulb, a piece of pizza. You can everything at 7-Eleven,\" she said.\n\nAs Chenoweth showed off the Boston Slurpee station to her 1.1 million followers, a big smile on her face, Belinda Carlisle's \"Heaven Is a Place on Earth\" could be heard on the 7-Eleven sound system.\n\nThe powerhouse performer couldn't have scripted a better moment."
