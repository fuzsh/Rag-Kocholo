        "text": "Fast Film Reviews on talkSPORT radio\n\nThis was recorded Sunday, April 16th: THE SUPER MARIO BROS. MOVIE continues to be a phenomenon at the box office. RENFIELD is a new release that barely made a dent. I talk about both on UK-based talkSPORT. My segment begins 5 minutes into the 2:30-3:00 segment (about 25 minutes from the end). Enjoy! Source: Live […]\n\nFast Film Reviews on talkSPORT radio\n\nThis was my Sunday, April 9th appearance on UK-based talkSPORT. AIR (in theaters) reunites Ben Affleck and Matt Damon in a sports drama about how the Air Jordan came to be, and OPERATION FORTUNE is a spy thriller (available to rent) starring Jason Statham. My segment begins 2 minutes into the 2:30-3:00 segment (about 28 […]\n\nGuy Ritchie’s The Covenant\n\nEven though The Covenant noticeably includes the filmmaker’s name in the title, this is not a typical Guy Ritchie movie. The designation was ostensibly done to differentiate itself from others with similar titles. The most well-known being a Renny Harlin-directed flick in 2006 about high school boys descended from colonial witches. Ritchie’s latest may be […]\n\nHow to Blow Up a Pipeline\n\nHow to Blow Up a Pipeline is as incendiary as it sounds. Originally a 2021 nonfiction book by Swedish author Andreas Malm whose politics on climate change have been described as Marxist. He advocates eco-terrorism; that is, he maintains that economic sabotage is an effective form of environmental activism. It’s a controversial opinion. How to […]\n\nBoston Strangler\n\nThe Boston Strangler was an infamous serial killer who, in the 1960s, allegedly killed 13 women in Boston, Massachusetts. This saga concerns the investigative journalism surrounding that true crime tale. Our chronicle narrows its focus to the trailblazing ladies who broke the story. The picture boasts two talented actresses. Keira Knightly is Loretta McLaughlin. Loretta […]\n\nRenfield\n\nRenfeield is a modern update of an old tale. This version is based on characters from Bram Stoker’s 1897 novel Dracula, but it also relies on the visual look of the 1931 movie starring Bela Lugosi. Nicholas Hoult is R. M. Renfield, the obedient servant of Count Dracula. Nicolas Cage embodies the legendary vampire from […]\n\nFast Film Reviews on talkSPORT radio\n\nOn Sunday, April 2nd, I was UK-based talkSPORT radio. I discussed DUNGEONS & DRAGONS: HONOR AMONG THIEVES, a fantasy with Chris Pine and Michelle Rodriguez, and THE LOST KING, a true-life drama starring Sally Hawkins. My appearance begins 4 minutes into the 2:30-3:00 segment (about 26 minutes from the end). Enjoy! Source: Live Radio, Breaking […]\n\nFast Film Reviews on talkSPORT radio\n\nThis was my Sunday, Match 26th appearance on the radio for UK-based talkSPORT. I spoke about CHAMPIONS starring Woody Harrelson — a feel-good sports comedy in theaters, as well as BOSTON STRANGLER, a crime drama starring Keira Knightley streaming on Hulu. My appearance begins 19 minutes into the 3:00-3:30 segment (about 11 minutes from the […]\n\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with giving people what they want. This is sometimes necessary when adapting a video game into a feature-length film. A collection of references only a connoisseur could appreciate satisfies a fundamental requirement. The Super Mario Bros. Movie honors the original entity, which makes it far better than the infamous 1993 adaptation Super […]\n\nAir\n\nThe NBA’s official profile of the Chicago Bulls legend begins, “By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time.” So it’s a testament to his all-consuming legacy that the movie Air is about a Nike salesman and his desire to sign Michael Jordan so they could market a shoe that nears his […]"
