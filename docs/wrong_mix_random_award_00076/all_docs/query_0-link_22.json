        "text": "Editor's note: In June 1985, Michael Jordan made his first visit to Springfield for a Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame enshrinement. The Chicago Bulls rookie of the year helped the city open its new Hall of Fame building on West Columbus Avenue (subsequently replaced by the current building in 2002), and also signed autographs at Symphony Hall - the site of his enshrinement as a Hall of Famer on Friday night. Here is the story from the June 30, 1985, Sunday Republican detailing his visit:\n\nBy LARRY SILBER\n\nSPRINGFIELD - Michael Jordan denied being in Springfield just to make an early mortgage payment for his eventual housing in the Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\n\"I'm here to give my (All-American High School Basketball Team) jersey to the Hall of Fame and represent McDonald's,\" said this year's National Basketball Association rookie-of-the-year for the Chicago Bulls during an autograph session at Symphony Hall Saturday.\n\nBefore Jordan gave his jersey to new Hall of Fame executive director Joe O'Brien, it seemed like he served up more than 50 billion autographs.\n\nRELATED ENSHRINEMENT STORIES\n\nMichael Jordan brings Air of royalty to Springfield\n\nHall of Fame Reunion brings back memories of early Enshrinements\n\nCOLUMN: Jordan's hard work made Portland's 1984 draft pick a blunder\n\nDavid \"The Admiral\" Robinson earned his new rank: Hall of Famer\n\nVivian Stringer's impact reaches beyond the court and into the Hall of Fame\n\nCoach's coach Jerry Sloan rates a place in the Basketball Hall of Fame\n\nDurability, selflessness place John Stockton into Basketball Hall of Fame\n\nWith Michael Jordan, the king arrives at the Hall of Fame\n\nRed Sox manager Terry Francona remembers Michael Jordan as the quintessential baseball player\n\nOn Jordan's left, with pen in hand, was Julius Erving - the former University of Massachusetts great and present Philadelphia 76ers star who is a virtual lock to make the shrine. On Jordan's right was guard Michael Ray Richardson of the New Jersey Nets.\n\nOutside, it was raining lightly, but that didn't faze the hundreds waiting to get into Symphony Hall to secure the autographs of Jordan, Dr. J and Hall of Famers like old Boston Celtic \"Easy\" Ed Macauley and Bob Kurland.\n\n\"Could I handle Michael Jordan?\" asked Macauley. \"Let me put it this way. The ballplayers are a little better today and nobody can handle Michael Jordan today.\"\n\nKidded Bertha Teague, the Byng (Okla.) High School girls basketball coach who posted a 1,152-115 record and who will be inducted Monday as one of the first women in the Hall: \"He could play for me. You know, I have 20-20 vision for these tall 'girls.'\n\n$?\"\n\nO'Brien laughed when asked if he could have used talents like Jordan and Erving when he coached at Assumption College. \"I think so. It would have made coaching a heck of a lot easier.\"\n\nThe shrine's chief executive-to-be also made sure to note how the city has made everything that much easier for the Hall of Fame, which officially opens its new facility today at 2 before Monday's enshrinement ceremonies and annual dinner.\n\n\"So far, it's been a fantastic weekend,\" said O'Brien. \"The city of Springfield has turned a grand opening into a gala.\"\n\nJordan, a 6-6, 197-pound guard out of the University of North Carolina, managed to have a gala time in the NBA this year as he 360-degree dunked his and Chicago's way into the playoffs. He even was rated by computer as the top player in the league this year over two-time MVP Larry Bird of Boston.\n\nPeople feel that Jordan's the most exciting player to come into the NBA since Erving.\n\n\"I just hope I can have the type of career that he's had,\" said Jordan.\n\n\"He's not bad at all,\" Erving, 35, returned the high praise for the high rising 22-year-old.\n\nIt was only four short years ago in New Orleans when Jordan, as a freshman, hit the game-winning shot to lift North Carolina to the national championship over Georgetown and another freshman named Patrick Ewing.\n\n\"That's the foundation. That's where it (the publicity, the success) all started,\" said Jordan, who went on to be named college-player-of-the-year twice before starring for the 1984 gold-medal winning Olympic team in Los Angeles.\n\nIt was the fulfillment of that gold-medal goal along with the NCAA title and the player-of-the-year awards which pushed the Wilmington, N.C., native to exit Dean Smith's program one year early and enter the NBA hardship draft.\n\n\"I achieved everything I could on the college level ... it was time to leave,\" said Jordan, who since has returned to school in Chapel Hill to continue working for his degree in culture geography.\n\nWhen questioned of his immediate goal at the pro level, Jordan threw back quickly \"an NBA championship.\"\n\nJordan does not talk tongue-in-cheek. And, he certainly doesn't even shoot that way. In fact, his tongue waves like Old Glory in a strong breeze when he's trying to score.\n\nHowever, that's not how Jordan really wants to be remembered.\n\n\"I'd like people to think of me as someone who tries and who never gives up,\" he said. \"And one who cares ... just a very caring person.\""
