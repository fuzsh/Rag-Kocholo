        "text": "What is Michael B. Jordan's Net Worth?\n\nMichael B. Jordan is an American actor who has a net worth of $50 million. Michael B. Jordan is best known for the films \"Fruitvale Station\" (2013), \"Creed\" (2015), and \"Black Panther\" (2018), as well as the television series \"The Wire\" (2002), \"All My Children\" (2003–2006), \"Friday Night Lights\" (2009–2011), and \"Parenthood\" (2010–2011). Michael has won dozens of awards for his acting work, including 3 BET Awards, 5 NAACP Image Awards, and a National Society of Film Critics Award. In addition to his film and television work, Jordan has appeared in music videos for Pleasure P, Jay-Z, and Snoh Aalegra, and his voice can be heard in \"Gears of War 3,\" \"NBA 2K17,\" Wilson's Heart,\" and \"Creed: Rise to Glory\" video games.\n\nEarly Life\n\nMichael B. Jordan was born Michael Bakari Jordan on February 9, 1987, in Santa Ana, California. He grew up in Newark, New Jersey, with his mother, Donna (a high school career counselor), father, Michael (a caterer), older sister, Jamila, and younger brother, Khalid. Michael studied acting and played basketball at Newark Arts High School, which he graduated from in 2005. During his childhood, Jordan did modeling work for Toys \"R\" Us, Modell's Sporting Goods, and several other companies and booked his first acting role when he was 12 years old.\n\nCareer\n\nJordan made his acting debut in a 1999 episode of HBO's \"The Sopranos,\" and that year, he also appeared on the CBS sitcom \"Cosby\" and the film \"Black and White.\" In 2001, he landed a role in \"Hardball,\" co-starring with Keanu Reeves and Diane Lane. The following year, Michael appeared in 12 episodes of the critically-acclaimed HBO series \"The Wire,\" and in 2003, he replaced future \"Black Panther\" co-star on the ABC soap opera \"All My Children.\" Jordan stayed on the show until June 2006, appearing in 59 episodes and earning award nominations from the \"Soap Opera Digest\" Awards and the NAACP Image Awards. He guest-starred on crime dramas \"Without a Trace,\" \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,\" and \"Cold Case\" before playing a lead role in the 2007 film \"Blackout.\" In 2009, Michael appeared in the film \"Pastor Brown\" as well as episodes of \"Burn Notice\" and \"Bones.\" That year, he also appeared in all 13 episodes of the Canadian sitcom \"The Assistants\" and began a 26-episode stint on the NBC football drama \"Friday Night Lights.\"\n\nIn 2010, Jordan was featured in \"Nylon\" magazine's Young Hollywood Issue as one of the \"faces of the future,\" guest-starred on \"Lie to Me\" and \"Law & Order: Criminal Intent,\" and joined the cast of NBC's \"Parenthood,\" appearing in 16 episodes. In 2012, he guest-starred on Fox's medical drama \"House\" and appeared in the films \"Red Tails\" and \"Chronicle.\" Jordan earned several awards for his performance as shooting victim Oscar Grant in 2013's \"Fruitvale Station,\" and both \"People\" and \"Variety\" singled him out as an \"actor to watch.\" \"GQ\" and \"Entertainment Weekly\" both named Michael one of the breakout stars of 2013. In 2015, he played Johnny Storm in \"Fantastic Four,\" which was considered a flop, but later that year, he earned critical acclaim when he played the son of Apollo Creed in \"Rocky\" sequel/spin-off \"Creed.\" The film grossed $173.6 million at the box office, and its sequel, 2018's \"Creed II,\" out-earned it with $214.1 million.\n\nIn 2018, Michael played villain Erik \"Killmonger\" Stevens in \"Black Panther,\" which earned 7 Academy Award nominations and grossed an astounding $1.347 billion at the box office, making it the year's second-highest-grossing film. He reprised the role in 2022's \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.\" Jordan also starred in and produced HBO's \"Fahrenheit 451\" that year; he served as an executive producer on the 2019 animated web series \"Gen:Lock\" and Netflix's \"Raising Dion\" as well. In 2019, he played defense attorney Bryan Stevenson in \"Just Mercy,\" which tells the true story of a man who was falsely convicted of murder and earned an NAACP Image Award for his performance. In 2018, Michael was cast in \"Without Remorse,\" a film based on a Tom Clancy novel, as former Navy SEAL John Clark; the movie was scheduled to be released in 2020 but has been delayed until February 2021 due to the Coronavirus pandemic. He made a cameo as himself in \"Space Jam: A New Legacy\" before returning as Adonis Creed for \"Creed III\" in 2023, which also marked his directorial debut.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nMichael has reportedly dated singer Iggy Azalea, actress and model Catherine Paiz, model Ashlyn Castro, and actress Kiki Layne. In November 2020, he began a relationship with model Lori Harvey, daughter of comedian Steve Harvey. The couple split in June 2022. Jordan has been a fan of anime since childhood, and in 2019, he designed a line of anime-inspired products for Coach.\n\nIn December 2022, Jordan became part-owner of the English football club AFC Bournemouth.\n\nAwards and Nominations\n\nIn 2013, Jordan won a Hollywood Film Award, Gotham Award, National Board of Review of Motion Pictures award, Satellite Award, and Santa Barbara International Film Festival award for his performance in \"Fruitvale Station.\" In 2015, \"Creed\" earned him awards from the African-American Film Critics Association, the Boston Online Film Critics Association, the Black Reel Awards, and the National Society of Film Critics, and in November of that year, Newark mayor Ras Baraka presented Michael with a key to the city.\n\nIn 2018 and 2019, Jordan earned a Best Villain MTV Movie & TV Award, a San Francisco Film Critics Circle award, a Seattle Film Critics Society award, a Teen Choice Award, and an Online Film Critics Society award for \"Black Panther,\" and he shared a Screen Actors Guild Award with his castmates. In 2019, Michael also received the Cinema Vanguard Award at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival for his work in \"Black Panther\" and \"Creed II.\" He has also been honored by the Acapulco Black Film Festival (2014), the BET Awards (2016, 2019, and 2020), the Black Film Critics Circle Awards (2015), and the Black Reel Awards (2016 and 2019). Jordan won NAACP Image Awards for \"Creed\" (2016), \"Fahrenheit 451\" (2019), \"Black Panther\" (2019), and \"Just Mercy\" as well as their Entertainer of the Year Award in 2016.\n\nReal Estate\n\nIn 2016, Jordan paid $1.7 million for a 4,627-square-foot house in Sherman Oaks, California, and lived there with his parents. He still owns this property.\n\nIn 2019, he moved into his own place, a 4,530-square-foot home in the Hollywood Hills that he purchased from model/entrepreneur Daisy Fuentes for $5.8 million. Michael placed this home on the market in March 2022 for a tiny bit under $7 million. He ultimately accepted $6.95 million in May 2022. Here's a video tour from the listing:\n\nIn May 2022, Michael B. Jordan paid $12.51 million for a newly constructed, 12,300-square-foot mansion on a half-acre lot in Encino, California. For some reason, just six months later – in January 2023 – Michael listed this home for sale for $12.998 million. During his time owning the home, Michael reportedly spent $500,000 upgrading the home's security systems and air conditioning units. He also changed the exterior color from white to a mix of grey and black. The property has a substantial guesthouse, pool, cigar bar, outdoor kitchen, cabana, and much more. Here's a video tour from before Michael bought the property and painted the exterior grey and black:"
