        "text": "RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nSo LeBron James is not called the King of the Court for nothing. The star of the Cleveland Cavaliers is at the peak of his career. And just last night, he led his team to the NBA finals for the seventh straight year.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nWow. And now he's doing something most people don't get to do. He's getting to be like Mike.\n\nMARTIN: Actually going just a little beyond Michael Jordan, breaking one of his records. LeBron was a kid in the '90s when Michael Jordan was at his peak, winning six championships, setting records, starring in a movie with Bugs Bunny.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nLEBRON JAMES: Now, when you're growing up and you're seeing Michael Jordan, you - it's almost like a god. So I'd have never believed I could be Mike. I never thought that you could get to a point where Mike was.\n\nINSKEEP: LeBron James says he wore short-shorts like MJ, copied his moves. And now he is passing Jordan in the record books.\n\nMARTIN: Last night, the Cavaliers beat the Boston Celtics and will go on to face the Golden State Warriors in the NBA finals. James scored 35 points in that game, including this 3-pointer.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: James...\n\nUNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: There it is.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: ...For three.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: There it is right there.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: Just passed Michael Jordan.\n\nINSKEEP: That gave LeBron James 5,989 career points in the playoffs, two more than Michael Jordan, the most all time.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJAMES: The biggest thing for me sitting here today after breaking the all-time scoring record in playoff history is that I did it just being me.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"SPACE JAM\")\n\nQUAD CITY DJ'S: (Singing) Yeah, all right...\n\nCopyright © 2017 NPR.
