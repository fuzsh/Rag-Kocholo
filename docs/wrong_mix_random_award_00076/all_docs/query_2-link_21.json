        "text": "Boston STAR –Boston Services for Trauma and Resources for families (STAR) –is a program dedicated to providing mental health services to Boston Medical Center patients from birth to 17 years old who have experienced traumatic events. We provide evidence-based trauma treatment that is individualized for each patient’s needs, challenges, strengths, and goals. Our team works closely with children and adolescents, their families, and the social environment such as schools and community supports to strengthen and enhance supports and reduce trauma symptoms to improve overall well-being.\n\nTreatment through Boston STAR may occur via telehealth or in-person at Boston Medical Center, as clinically appropriate and accessible to the family, and can include referrals for additional clinical supports as indicated.\n\nTreatments and Services\n\nPsychotherapy: The Boston STAR team utilizes evidence based treatment for childhood trauma, including Trauma Systems Therapy (TST). TST is a well-researched and highly flexible approach to trauma treatment that is individualized to fit each patient’s needs, strengths, challenges, and goals. Treatment focuses on understanding a child’s in the moment responses and working closely with the child’s family and environments (home, school, and community) to support new and more adaptive coping. Your child’s clinician will spend time with your child, as well as with you and in communication with others who know your child well, to gain a deep understanding of what supports and strategies may work best for your child, and will support you and your child together as you move through treatment.\n\nMedication: Every child reacts to trauma differently. There may be instances in which medication is needed to support the child/adolescent. Child and adolescent psychiatrist will evaluate by speaking to the child/adolescent, therapist, and anyone else who works with the family and child/adolescent in order to make the best recommendation for medication.\n\nContact Us\n\nCall Nicole Ciccone, LICSW, Program Director, at (617) 414-3820 or email us at BostonSTAR@bmc.org for questions about the Boston STAR program including:\n\nRescheduling an appointment\n\nDirections to our offices\n\nHearing more about any of the services we provide\n\nOther questions about the program\n\nBoston STAR Team:\n\nNicole Ciccone, LICSW\n\nProject Director, Boston Service for Trauma and Resources for families\n\nBehavioral Health Clinician, Child and Adolescent Psychiatry\n\nClinical Supervisor, Adult and Child Psychiatry Sarah Valentine, PhD\n\nPrincipal Investigator, Boston Services for Trauma and Resources for families\n\nAssistant Professor of Psychiatry, Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine\n\nDirector, Program of Research in Implementation Science, Minority Stress, and Mental Health (PRISMM)\n\nDirector, The Recovery from Stress and Trauma through Outpatient care, Research, and Education (RESTORE) Center Ashley Jackson, LICSW\n\nBoston STAR Trauma Specialist, Boston Services for Trauma and Resources for families\n\nOutpatient Behavioral Health Clinical, Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Liza Katz, LICSW\n\nBoston STAR Trauma Specialist, Boston Services for Trauma and Resources for families\n\nOutpatient Behavioral Health Clinical, Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Lillian Gomes, BA\n\nCultural broker and Community Healthcare Worker, Boston Services for Trauma and Resources for families\n\nJean-Louise Reichman, MA\n\nProject Evaluator, Boston Services for Trauma and Resources for families\n\nResearch Program Coordinator, Department of Psychiatry Nandini Agarwal, MPH\n\nProject Evaluator, Boston Services for Trauma and Resources for families\n\nResearch Data Analyst, Department of Psychiatry\n\nPatient Resources\n\nWhat is Child Trauma?
