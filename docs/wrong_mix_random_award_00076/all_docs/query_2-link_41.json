This time I’m older and it means something special to me and my family. She is always a good influencer. I’m counting on this show to save me I feel lonely without gregg allman. I know 100 %. This is the most sought after show on the world. You drive me to new heights & your amazingly fast. I’m a fan for lifer.\n\nMarlene Kramer from Sarasota, Florida\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMEND\n\nGreat show. Amazing costumes and costume changes. I don't know how they did that. The acoustics and sight line were great. Would see it again.\n\nKaren Rohde from Utica, New York\n\nTHE CHER SHOW\n\nThe show was amazing, very well written and the actors were all incredible. Total 5 Star\n\nJimmy Mercedes from Boston, Massachusetts\n\nFUNNY, HEARTWARMING AND INSPIRATIONAL\n\nThis show has it all! From beginning to end it made me laugh almost made me cry and inspired me to never give up on a dream. The cast was amazing the costumes were wonderful and vivid. The show takes you on a musical journey of the ups and downs of Cher's life and career. The writing and performances are something to remember. I will see it again and invite a few friends because the Cher Show is an experience that shouldn't be missed.\n\nJG from Kansas City, Missouri\n\nOKAY. NOT BAD.\n\nCast was good. Songs were Cher songs. It moved along well. I liked it perhaps better than I thought I would. I’m not a Cher fan. My wife enjoyed it more. I love live theater and I am glad I went. However, I don’t feel the need to see it again."
