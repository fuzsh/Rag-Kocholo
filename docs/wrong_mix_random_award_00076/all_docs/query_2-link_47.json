        "text": "REVIEW: Turn up that jukebox for Reagle Music Theatre of Greater Boston’s lively musical comedy ‘All Shook Up’\n\nPosted on\n\nMeet Chad, a would-be Elvis big on swagger, sideburns and love for the ladies.\n\nFrom that electric Jailhouse Rock opening, All Shook Up soaks up the nostalgia and the lighthearted side of the ‘Fabulous ‘50s.’ Adding humor, fun frivolity and amazing choreography, All Shook Up boasts powerful vocals and plenty of love to the beat of Elvis’s greatest hits. Turn up that jukebox. It’s time for a ride down memory lane.\n\nWith exuberant direction by Arthur Gomez, tight and sweeping choreography by Larry Sousa with upbeat music direction by Mindy Cimini, Reagle Music Theatre of Greater Boston presents All Shook Up live and in person at the Robinson Theatre in Waltham, Massachusetts through July 21. This engaging musical comedy is approximately two hours with one 15 minute intermission and not for young children. Click here for more information and for tickets.\n\nVibrantly charged in florescent blue and red by Frank Meissner Jr, Reagle Music Theatre of Greater Boston brings the 50’s back to life with Janie Howland’s vintage set design of Main Street USA which includes Sylvia’s Honkey Tonk, Jim’s Service Station, Main Street Museum and appropriately Town Shoes which is a hint for those blue suede shoes. Each locale plays an integral part in roustabout Chad’s wild journey.\n\nBoasting a Bye Bye Birdie vibe with Grease energy, All Shook Up looks at a small Midwestern town’s perspective on a summer day in 1955 when Chad, portrayed distinctly by Christopher Lewis, makes an instant impact. Lewis shakes up Main Street USA for the better while unearthing a guitar-tinged bebop vibe that self righteous and plotting Mayor Matilda, depicted with sharp comedic timing by Janis Hudson in a performance reminiscent of Joan Cusack, is determined to stop. In cat eye glasses and alongside James Turner the III as suspicious Sheriff Earl, Hudson shines in the fierce and catchy number The Devil in Disguise, humorously posing and barking out orders with zeal and authority.\n\nAll Shook Up is full of deadpan jokes and clever quips with Elvis song titles and lyrics. When a townsperson points out Chad’s blue suede shoes, Chad casually warns to lay off them. Part impersonation with the vocal chops to match, Chad embodies the larger than life qualities of Elvis, but takes it one step further making the part his own exemplified in a resonating rendition of I Don’t Want to demonstrating Lewis’s own unique and dynamic range.\n\nA storm of unrequited love and love triangles taken from a mix of Shakespearean comedies, this ‘50s musical comedy infuses a lot of elements into this lively tale and it works. Christopher Lewis as Chad makes a powerful impression on everyone he meets. Gwynne Wood as Natalie is the mechanic and is looking for more excitement than this little town can hold. Wood is endearing as Natalie who is sensible, timid, and resourceful with a powerful belt for One Night with You. Wood shares some charming chemistry with Jackson Jirard as best friend Dennis who only has eyes for Natalie. Jirard also shares some amusing scenes with Lewis, Wood, and Alfred-Jean Chavier’s Jim as the voice of reason.\n\nTader Shipley as vampy blond bombshell Miss Sandra also makes her own impression with a soaring rendition of Let Yourself Go and alongside the cast for a sassy take on Teddy Bear/Hound Dog.\n\nCarolyn Saxon brings sincerity and candidness to Sylvia and shares a varying yet sweet rapport with her daughter, Lorraine, depicted by Amaris Rios and Jean-Alfred Chavier as forthright and apprehensive widow Jim. Saxon performs a stunning rendition of There’s Always Me.\n\nThe production also flips the script in more ways than one while staying faithful to the Shakespearean twists. Rebellious Lorraine and Preston Karp as dutiful Dean share exciting chemistry and their rendition of It’s Now or Never is a delight alongside Sousa’s innovative bus choreography.\n\nC’mon everybody is a classic and vintage showstopper weaving in classic dance moves as Emerald City Theatrical does it again in vintage gleaming colored costumes ranging in plaids, bowling shirts, and gorgeous fit and flair crinoline dresses.\n\nAll Shook Up is bright, catchy and a lot of fun with an inherent message within an array of beloved Elvis hits that might lighten the weight of this world for awhile.\n\nWith exuberant direction by Arthur Gomez, amazing choreography by Larry Sousa with upbeat music direction by Mindy Cimini, Reagle Music Theatre of Greater Boston presents All Shook Up live and in person at the Robinson Theatre in Waltham, Massachusetts through July 21. This engaging musical comedy is approximately two hours with one 15 minute intermission. Click here for more information and for tickets.\n\nREVIEW: Embrace life and pursue the ultimate wave with Gloucester Stage’s summer soaked world premiere comedy ‘Wipeout’\n\nPosted on\n\nIt is never too late to try something new.\n\nMargaret nicknamed Gary, is ready to take risks. Whether throwing caution to wind by neglecting to wear sunscreen or a seatbelt, Gary is finally embarking on a lifelong dream – to ride the ultimate wave for her 77th birthday in Santa Cruz, California…having never set foot in the water before.\n\nWith innovative and at times hilarious direction by Shana Gozansky as well as inviting lighting by Kat C Zhou, Gloucester Stage could not have chosen a more perfect time in its 45th season to unveil the world premiere of Aurora Real de Asua’s comedy Wipeout continuing live and in person at Gloucester Stage in Gloucester, Massachusetts through July 28. The production contains a mix of important and needlessly explicit language, adult themes and runs approximately 100 minutes with no intermission. Click here for more information and for tickets.\n\nSurrounded by brightly colored beach balls on an aqua draped landscape, three women and one handsome teenage Santa Cruz Surf Skool instructor take to the waves depicted in a wooden pool like structure with sea turtles and various marine life painted on its perimeter. The absence of water in Jenna McFarland Lorde’s immensely exuberant set design embellishes the humor and endearing moments in this production as rolling chairs carry surfboards. Infuse Aubrey Dube’s immersive Pacific Ocean sounds and Wipeout transforms into one lively surfing safari.\n\nWipeout’s excellent physical comedy is hysterical as the group carefully wades through the ‘water’ in scrupulous and urgent strokes while each character balances on their individual board. In water shoes and matching surf skool t-shirts by Jennifer Greeke, Gary, depicted with captivating depth and bawdy audacity by Karen MacDonald, is excitable, adventurous, and a playful prankster but there might be more to that than meets the eye. MacDonald’s more serious moments are equally adept in a glassy-eyed grimace or squirming consternation. Supportive, wise, cheerful and grounded school teacher Claudia portrayed beautifully by Cheryl D. Singleton, shares true companionship with Noelle Player as haughty and glamorous with a bit of a chip of her shoulder Wynn and Gary through the manner in which they share memories, meanderings, insecurities, inside jokes, gossip and bawdy references at times with Golden Girls flair. They embody a solid, longtime, and intimate friendship through thick and thin. This engaging trio fumbles to find common ground with Thomas Bilotta who is instantly likable as their patient, enthusiastic, and compassionate teenage instructor Blaze which is met with intriguing results. Wipeout is full of surprises as well as stirring and authentic life lessons as each character explores instinct, life’s unpredictability, mortality, and what is really means to embrace life to the fullest.\n\nWith innovative and at times hilarious direction by Shana Gozansky and inviting lighting by Kat C Zhou, Gloucester Stage could not have chosen a more perfect time in its 45th season to unveil the world premiere of Aurora Real de Asua’s dramedy Wipeout continuing live and in person at Gloucester Stage Company in Gloucester, Massachusetts through July 28. The production contains a mix of significant and needlessly explicit language, adult themes and runs approximately 100 minutes with no intermission. Click here for more information and for tickets.\n\nREVIEW: Teatro Chelsea’s ‘Fade’ a tense cautionary tale\n\nPosted on\n\nTanya Saracho’s Fade proves the daily grind should always contain some chic choreography.\n\nAccented by Desiree Salvo’s multicolored and club-inspired lighting and Armando Rivera’s intense and Latin-inspired upbeat rhythms, two people energetically tackle their workday. These eclectic and lively dance breaks provide a clever reprieve and gradually become more meaningful afterhours inside a television station where drama takes a front seat.\n\nDirected thoughtfully by Armando Rivera with playful chorography designed by Movement Director Audrey Johnson, Teatro Chelsea presented Tanya Saracho’s Fade live and in person at Chelsea Theatre Works through Sunday, June 30. Though it is not necessary to understand both Spanish and English to enjoy this production, those who understood some of the dialogue in Spanish have a bit of an advantage.

Fade turns the tables a bit to focus on an individual who is not necessarily a likable figure. Mexican-born novelist Lucia (Lus-sea-a), portrayed with fiery anxiousness by Luz Lopez, is the new scriptwriter at a television station and is not quite sure where to begin. When Lucia meets quiet yet observant Mexican-American custodian Abel (A-bell) in an absorbing portrayal by Cristhian Mancinas-Garcia, she seemingly sees a like minded individual, but they soon realize that they are not exactly on a united front.\n\nLucia, feeling under qualified and insecure, is chatty, nosy, and opinionated as she rants about how unfair life has been for her living in California. She is anxious about success and blames everyone but her own abilities for the work she has done. To some points, she is justified working in a primarily white male environment. She jumps to conclusions, is a sneaky rule breaker and hotheaded while Abel is mysterious, reserved and reluctant to speak with her. However, their conversations progress from awkward to tense as focused, humble, and patient Abel cannot help but politely comply as Lucia uses guilt and pressure in order to have her way.\n\nLopez delivers a convincing and bold portrayal as Lucia who would be easy to sympathize with if she was more respectful of Abel’s wishes. Lopez’s Lucia is dramatic, persuasive, and a clear spark exists between her and Mancinas-Garcia as Abel. Mancinas-Garcia’s Abel is an immediately sympathetic character, forthright, and brutally honest which seems to be good for Lopez’s Lucia. However, delving into everything from family to politics and everything in between, things get complicated the more they learn about each other.\n\nLuz Lopez and Armando Rivera make a visually compelling statement in Lucia’s clothing which reflects her gradual character transformation from low key basic attire to lavish and flattering accented with a patterned scarf while Mancinas –Garcia’s Abel’s uniform remains the same.\n\nThere lies a twist in this tale and it is startling even if it is one you might see coming. A tense workplace drama tempered by some comedic and upbeat flair, Fade tackles many topics including intuition, integrity and where you place your trust.\n\nDirected thoughtfully by Armando Rivera with playful chorography designed by Movement Director Audrey Johnson, Teatro Chelsea presented Tanya Saracho’s Fade live and in person at Chelsea Theatre Works through Sunday, June 30.

Guys and Dolls is lighthearted and bustling with some of the most popular songs of Musical’s Golden Age such as Luck Be a Lady, Fugue for Tinhorns, I’ve Never Been in Love Before, Sit Down You’re Rockin’ the Boat and its beloved title track.\n\nDirected and choreographed by Ceit Zweil, Greater Boston Stage Company continues Frank Loesser’s musical comedy classic Guys and Dolls live and in person at Greater Boston Stage Company in Stoneham, Massachusetts through June 30. This slick production is approximately two hours and 30 minutes with one 15 minute intermission. Click here for more information and for tickets.\n\nSet on Broadway between Times Square and Columbus Circle, Greater Boston Stage Company reveals a little cozy but snazzy set by John Savage including vintage 1950s illustrated signs lit by marquis lights and an illuminated moving cityscape back drop. With lively music direction and conducted by Dan Rodriguez, this glitzy version of Guys and Dolls has a bit of a concert vibe with the orchestra performing center stage amidst all the action.\n\nThe show is as zippy as these fast talking gamblers ready for the next crap game. In stylish hat and a pinstriped suit, Arthur Gomez as lovable but scheming Nathan Detroit is always cooking up a plan and usually one step ahead, but now he is short on money to hold his next floating crap game. Enter Jared Troilo as smooth talking and high stakes gambler Sky Masterson and suddenly, Nathan has a new and seeming surefire plan to win big and finally marry his long suffering girlfriend, Miss Adelaide. However, Sky discovers he is in for much more than he ever bargained for.\n\nGuys and Dolls is a classic for a reason. Not only did the 50s film adaptation star Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra, but it’s an upbeat musical full of charm about love, the Big City vibe, taking risks and saving souls not necessarily in that order. The characters are all likable in spite of their shady ways because most of them can humorously talk their way out of just about anything.\n\nIn glasses and a bowler hat, Stephen Markarian captures the cheery and good natured charm of Nicely-Nicely Johnson from the slick and catchy harmonies in Fugue for Tinhorns with Mark Linehan as Benny and Christian David as Rusty Charlie. Their goofy chemistry and antics set the stage well along with the title track and bookended by Stephen Markarian’s exuberant and exciting classic number Sit down You’re Rocking the Boat which is not to be missed.\n\nSara Coombs as Miss Adalaide could easily have entered over the top caricature territory, but Coombs sticks with dramatic yet a bit more realistic subtlety for Adelaide’s Lament. Hailing from Rhode Island, Miss Adelaide is not to be underestimated and knows exactly what she wants playing a long game of her own as Nathan’s girlfriend. She shares some endearing chemistry albeit with some understandable bickering with Nathan as they perform a quick paced and intense rendition of Sue Me. Alongside Hot Box dancers Hannah Shihdanian, Allison Russell and Abigail Martin, Coombs delivers some flirtatious and humorous scenarios decked out in Dierdre Gerrard’s timely, sparkling and playful costumes kicking off with a country coy Bushel and a Peck. Russell and Shihdanian both perform triple roles with Russell notably as the infamous big time, tough talking gambler Big Jule.\n\nIn a blue pinstripe suit and gleaming white shoes, Troilo depicts Sky Masterson with smooth talking swagger and shares some great scenes with Lisa Kate Joyce’s straight-arrowed and head of the Save-a-Soul Mission band, Sarah Brown. Joyce’s angelic and silvery soprano vocals nail the delightful If I were a Bell and I’ve Never Been in Love Before alongside Troilo in a lovely duet. Joyce also has a brief but memorable scene with Chip Phillips as lovable Arvide for the tenderhearted number, More I Cannot Wish You.\n\nJared Troilo shines in My Time of Day, but nothing beats Troilo’s determined earnestness teetering toward desperation with the rest of the cast for Luck Be a Lady embellished by Ceit Zweil’s tight choreography and Corey Whittemore’s vivid and flashy lighting which just about brings down the house.\n\nDirected and choreographed by Ceit Zweil, Greater Boston Stage Company continues Frank Loesser’s musical comedy classic Guys and Dolls live and in person at Greater Boston Stage Company in Stoneham, Massachusetts through June 30.

It seems a typical day in the lives of The Goodman family as they roam around the house, caught up in an average school morning. The mundane and stressful routines do not hint of what is in store for Diane during the bustling and humorous number, Just Another Day. However, this particular day will be different and it will affect everyone around her.\n\nAstutely directed and symbolically choreographed by Pascale Florestal with excellent musical direction by Katie Bickford, Central Square Theater co-produced by Front Porch Arts Collective continues the Pulitzer Prize-winning and multiple Tony Award-winning rock musical, next to normal live and in person at Central Square Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts through Sunday, June 30. This fascinating production contains adult themes and is approximately two hours and 20 minutes with one intermission. Click here for more information and for tickets.\n\nWith significant Easter eggs floating above Erik D. Diaz’s meaningful and multi-tiered set connected notably by a spiral staircase and a central door, most of the scenes take place inside the Goodman household with the exception of the living room that doubles as an office space. Mark Clark Wonson’s evocative lighting pulses and radiates on this production’s veering emotional journey and Kiara Escalera’s vibrant costumes often complement each other in stripes, patterns and shades between Anthony Pires Jr. as Dan and Marcelle and most notably in shades of blue later depicted between Cortlandt Barrett as Natalie and Dashawn McClinton as Henry.\n\nNext to normal is a well paced and revealing musical journey about a troubled family who hides it well. It delves into dysfunction and disorders with a bittersweet and relatable gusto and Brian Yorkey’s thought provoking script with dynamic and captivating music by Tom Kitt work together to unravel the nature of Diane’s illness and how each character is affected in Diane’s struggle. I have seen quite a few great performances lately, but helmed by Sherée Marcelle as Diane, this is a powerhouse. Each one of the next to normal cast delivers compelling performances with the vocal chops to prove it while conscientiously revealing their unique way of managing the complexity of their lives.\n\nWith glassy eyed confusion and shaking fingers, Sherée Marcelle as Diane is overwhelmed by her life. Marcelle evokes the anxiousness, disillusionment, trauma, and the submersion Diane faces as bipolar and her yearning vocals unleash the suffering she endures living in her head searching for relief in I Miss the Mountains. Marcelle is amazing as Diane who feels trapped wherever she is. Numb or overdrive where reaching for normal never feels quite right.\n\nThe catchy and dark satirical parody, Who’s Crazy / My Psychopharmacologist and I paints and infuses humor into a reeling picture of her battle while also providing a peek into how this affects those around her like her concerned grounded husband portrayed charismatically and sympathetically by Pires Jr. as Dan whose patience is quickly unraveling in his search for answers. Ricardo “Ricky” Holguin in a dual role is hilarious as a deadpan doctor, wild, then later poignant full of compassion and concern.\n\nPires Jr. and Marcelle is an enthralling pair mastering complex and rhythmic harmonies as well as visceral emotions with zeal and intensity. In one of the production’s lighter moments and next to normal contains as much humor as it does drama, Pires Jr. nails the giddy and quick-paced number It’s Gonna Be Good in helpless wonder and perfect harmony with the rest of the cast.\n\nCortlandt Barrett’s impressive vocals expel a painful cadence as the struggling, often neglected and perfectionist daughter, Natalie. Barrett and Marcelle share their frames of mind in Wish I Were Here and with the cast in an absorbing Make Up Your Mind/Catch Me I’m Falling. Barrett also shares warm chemistry with Dashawn McClinton as persistent and earnest Henry who is instantly lovable in an intriguing rendition of Perfect for You. Diego Cintrón is lively and memorable, especially in an eerie rendition of There’s a World and with Marcelle and Barrett for a poignant and revealing rendition of Superboy and the Invisible Girl.\n\nNext to Normal has a few bombshell revelations and the production not only paints an authentic and educational picture of mental illness, but love’s carefree but oftentimes arduous journey with humor, heart and hope. Mental illness makes it difficult to escape from inside one’s head so it shuts people out. As the daughter of a person with depression, it was eye-opening to see a reflection of these challenges within the family and to witness someone so well loved struggling for the strength to see beyond the pain and find the other side.\n\nAstutely directed and symbolically choreographed by Pascale Florestal with excellent musical direction by Katie Bickford, Central Square Theater co-produced by Front Porch Arts Collective continues the multiple Tony Award-winning rock musical, next to normal live and in person at Central Square Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts through Sunday, June 30.

The challenges that face this particular group of people may be the only thing that turns the tide.\n\nDirected and choreographed by Rachel Bertone and adapted from James A. Michener’s Pulitzer prize-winning novel, Tales of the South Pacific, Reagle Music Theatre of Greater Boston kicked off its 55th season with Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Golden Age musical classic, South Pacific live and in person at the Robinson Theatre in Waltham, Massachusetts through Sunday, June 23. This family-friendly production is approximately two hours and 30 min with a 15 minute intermission. Click here for more information and for tickets.\n\nRodgers and Hammerstein’s South Pacific focuses on love, sacrifice, and survival during a turning point in World War II, but also features many lighthearted and humorous moments under Rachel Bertone’s direction and mix of delicate and energetic choreography from the endearing Dites-Moi featuring graceful Penelope Rhoads as Nguana and Lola Rhoads as Jerome to the high-spirited There is Nothing Like a Dame to the carefree comedy of Honey Bun featuring charismatic, wisecracking but well-meaning Luther depicted impressively by Brendan McGrady with a smirk and thick New York accent. With strong and engaging vocals navigated by Music Director David Coleman, South Pacific boasts a long list of Rodgers and Hammerstein’s revered American Standard classic tunes.\n\nJanie E. Howland’s breezy, tropical, and wicker-infused set includes painted tropical flowers, towering palm trees, and signs of significant locations as well as a surprising special effect with a helicopter. Blended with Frank Meissner Jr’s radiant lighting, South Pacific illuminates compelling landscapes from dawn to daybreak as well as a gleaming aqua coastline. Emerald City Theatrical’s terrifically retro costumes range from vintage cheerfully colored casual wear to authentic looking uniforms.\n\nJennifer Ellis blends effervescence and effortless charm as Nellie Forbush, a GI nurse from Arkansas who quickly falls for Christopher Chew as Emile de Becque, an older, worldly and mysterious Frenchman who resides on an island plantation. Both are incredibly curious about the other and consider each other way out of their league. Chew and Ellis share romantic tension-fueled chemistry, making it sweet to witness their awkward conversions. There is warmth between these two and Chew’s marvelous vocals deliver a beautiful rendition of Some Enchanted Evening after Ellis shares her lighthearted nature in an enchanting rendition of Cockeyed Optimist.\n\nEmile and Nellie seem to have a mature love that is often tested as the production progresses. This show is less about love triangles, but more about love at first sight and the challenges that each one of them face as war hangs in the balance.\n\nAnother captivating yet fiery presence is Lisa Yuen as determined, practical and shrewd businesswoman Bloody Mary. Yuen’s candid, direct and persistent demeanor as a Tonkinese woman attempting to find success is excellent, especially as she outsmarts some GIs she encounters for a deal. She has a wonderful rapport and chumminess with the GIs, especially during the number Bloody Mary through Bertone’s lively choreography. Yuen shares a funny first encounter with Blake DuBois as cool, collected and enigmatic Lieutenant Joseph Cable who delivers a memorable rendition of Younger than Springtime. Yuen’s Bloody Mary just might be the most earnest and levelheaded individual in the production, her haunting vocals on full display in Bali Ha’i and heartfelt alongside Calico Valasco as Liat in Happy Talk.\n\nSome aspects of South Pacific still seem dated and a little cloying and with much respect to Rodgers and Hammerstein, South Pacific is not as emotionally charged as their other works and often found myself questioning the motivation of some of these characters. For example, Ellis as Nellie seems impulsive and indecisive just as quickly as she seems so certain. Perhaps it was just a different time. Otherwise, Reagle Music Theatre of Greater Boston’s South Pacific is a memorable, family-friendly day at the theatre with a strong and timeless inherent message.\n\nDirected and choreographed by Rachel Bertone and adapted from James A. Michener’s Pulitzer prize-winning novel, Tales of the South Pacific, Reagle Music Theatre of Greater Boston kicked off its 55th season with Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Golden Age musical classic, South Pacific live and in person at the Robinson Theatre in Waltham, Massachusetts through Sunday, June 23.

Boasting an illuminated brass backdrop layered with firework shaped gold lighting as well as multi-colored imagery, Boston Symphony Hall welcomed a large crowd for this highly-anticipated, 30th anniversary event for one night only on Saturday, June 8 live and in person in Boston, Massachusetts. Click here for more information and more on upcoming Boston Pops events including Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular featuring The Mavericks, Kelli O’Hara, and much more.\n\nEach year, Gospel Night features a special blend of acclaimed musical guests, a variety of beloved songs delivered by the Boston Pops Gospel Choir as well as an array of memorable performances.\n\nWarmly greeting the crowd and the orchestra was accomplished conductor, pianist, and composer Charles Floyd, who has been conducting Gospel Night for the past 28 years. Click here for a closer look at Charles Floyd and his career.\n\nDistinguished looking in a white tuxedo with black pants and a bow tie, Charles Floyd gave an appreciative wave before opening this joyous concert with George W. Chadwick’s spirited Jubilee which boasts a rush of excitement and anticipation as well as a mix of beautiful yearning and striking rhythms. Duke Ellington’s Caravan was an incredibly robust and exhilarating experience delivering drum-infused, head bobbing rhythms featuring Edmar Colón, David Rosado, Jeriel Sanjurjo and Gabriel Santiago on percussion and featuring Balla Kouyaté with an incredible sound on Balafon.\n\nTen-time Grammy Award-winning a capella gospel group Take 6 highlighted the event as they returned to Gospel Night for an uplifting set of impressive performances. Made up of a half a dozen captivating members which includes Claude McKnight, Mark Kibble, Joel Kibble, Dave Thomas, Alvin Chea, and Khristian Dentley in suits and tailored shirts, Take 6 took the audience on a wide and inspirational journey to provide encouragement and share their joy including the catchy harmonies in Feels Good, an upbeat, yet moving rendition of the Charlie Chaplin’s cover Smile, a fiddle-infused Lullaby and a nostalgic rendition of Ambrosia’s Biggest Part of Me. As cloud shaped lighting hovered above the orchestra, Take 6 also shared a divine rendition of David Bloom’s You deserve it steeped in echoing and acapella harmonies.\n\nThe second half of Gospel Night is a rousing celebration encouraging everyone to let loose and dance with the energizing Boston Pops Gospel Choir. In a beautiful black dress and pearls, Katani Sumner encouraged the crowd to get on their feet for Smith’s All Praise which was further emphasized by Ray Martin in an uplifting rendition of Hallelujah You’re Worthy. Ida Kamrara elevated the celebration with Lord You’re Great and Brittany Wells and Loraine Adeymi joined together for a horn infused, expressive and high-powered duet of Wonderful is Your Name/I’m So Thankful as the energy escalated onstage culminating in Zion Rejoice with Sherylynn Sealy.\n\nHowever, after the encore is the after party.\n\nLed with incredible enthusiasm and sharing a few dance steps, The Boston Pops Gospel Choir Artistic Director and Brother Dennis L. Slaughter gears up each year for a grand, spirit-fueled finale after the finale. It is a toe tapping after party that usually could go all night long, if only they could. Whether it is due to the current state of the world, remnants of pandemic numbers, people buried in discouragement or a combination of all three, the audience’s response was not as enthusiastic has it has been in past years. The finale usually has everyone on their feet and Gospel Night was not as full as it has been in past years.\n\nEarlier on during their set, Take 6 delivered an earnest and eloquent message of persistence and resilience before launching into a smooth and touching rendition of Over the Hill is Home. It spoke volumes about overcoming the heartache of life’s challenges and having faith to pull ourselves over that hill to a day that ‘shines so bright.’ We can all use encouragement in these dark times and Gospel Night uniquely brings home that exuberant and electrifying resolve each and every year if we let it sink in.\n\nREVIEW: Sullivan Rep’s ‘A Little Night Music’ soars\n\nPosted on\n\nLove is in the air among the rich and glamorous…elusive and oftentimes fleeting.\n\nElegantly directed and choreographed by Daniel Sullivan with excellent music direction by Jenny Tsai, Sullivan Rep is in the middle of unveiling its first ambitious season and recently presented Stephen Sondheim’s classic, Tony award-winning musical farce, A Little Night Music live and in person at Newton Town Hall in Newton, Massachusetts through Saturday, June 8. This production was not for children and ran approximately two hours with an intermission. Click here for more information and to take a closer look at Sullivan Rep’s upcoming productions.\n\nHaving never seen A Little Night Music before, it was with great anticipation to witness another classic Sondheim production. A Little Night Music was first staged on Broadway in 1973 and was revived on Broadway in 2009 starring Angela Lansbury as Madame and Catherine Zeta-Jones in her Tony award-winning performance as Desiree. Send in the Clowns is one of my favorite Broadway songs and it was exciting to finally see it performed in the context in which Sondheim intended.\n\nSet in 1900s Sweden, Sondheim’s A Little Night Music has bit of a soap opera vibe focusing on the jaded love lives and lifestyles of the upper class emphasized in the number, The Glamourous Life which is sung by some questionably moral aristocratic characters who lead anything but a mundane daily routine and where absolutely nothing is out of reach. In a black dress and burgundy sash, accomplished matriarch Madame, cleverly and amusingly portrayed by Veronica Anastasio Wiseman, decides to advise her granddaughter, an adorably precocious Libby Sweder, in the ways of the world. Surrounded by several love triangles, Sweder soon learns that the world is far more complicated, especially among the privileged.\n\nThe Newton Town Hall, though the acoustics had a bit of an echo that muffled some lyrics, was an ideal setting for this sophisticated production with its sterling piano, marble floors, a candelabra and the full orchestra refreshingly set above the stage and cleverly utilized in a brief play-within-a-play scene. An opulent table setting and a countryside picnic arranged by cast members are part of Rick Grenier’s ornate properties design. DW emphasized this regal atmosphere with upscale Edwardian attire featuring lace, stately coat tails, and long silk gloves embellished by ritzy and sparkling jewelry and adornments.\n\nA Little Night Music’s refined cast have a sense they are a cut above the rest and prove it mastering complex harmonies, powerful vocals and droll comic timing. Led by Veronica Anastasio Wiseman as Armfeldt matriarch Madame, Wiseman huffs and admonishes with the best of them musing about today’s Liasons with rapier wit, ‘Where is the style? Where is skill? Where is forethought? Where is the discretion of the heart?’ knowing full well she leads this glamorous life for good reason. Wiseman and Sweder share an intimate and knowing camaraderie and it is fascinating to see how Sweder responds to her surroundings.\n\nWith a shriek and bubbly childishness, Rebekah Rae Robles impressively embodies lively and youthful teenager Anne who happens to be married to much older, wealthy and experienced attorney Fredrik, enigmatically depicted by Brian Higgins. It is not immediately evident Fredrik’s motives for marrying her and it is strangely comical to see them together in her innocence. Fredrik’s eyes shine fondly with former love, Desiree for a reflective rendition of You Must Meet My Wife.\n\nIn glasses and a sweater vest, Jacob Thomas Less depicts smart, ambitious and neurotic Henrik, son of Fredrik. Awkward and sweet, Less meaningfully conveys Henrik’s sincere and frustrating invisibility in this world of excess and longs to be understood demonstrated in an earnest rendition of Later, part of a vocal trio for Now/Later/Soon.\n\nAndrea Giangreco is a standout as Charlotte with wonderful dark humor and enchanting vocals as Anthony Rinaldi as Carl-Magnus’s long suffering and conflicted wife. Everyday a Little Death with Rebekah Rae Robles as Anne is a solemn and tender duet and Giangreco’s witty and sympathetic portrayal and solid vocals makes it easy to root for her. Giangreco shares some very funny moments with scene stealing Rinaldi as plotting and conceited military dragoon Carl-Magnus as he storms and struts around the stage with an entitled air and an over the top sneer emphasized in a soaring rendition of In Praise of Women.\n\nAs a big fan of Into the Woods, there is a gleam of similarity to where Sondheim might have been inspired for his later works in A Little Night Music. For example, the contemplative duet It would have been Wonderful featuring Brian Higgins as Fredrik and Anthony Rinaldi as Carl-Magnus share lighthearted and humorous reflections similar in comic tone to the Into the Woods’s duet in Agony featuring two rivals that may share more in common than they think. Higgins and Rinaldi’s absurd reasoning keeps their ridiculous rivalry interesting.\n\nNora Sullivan masters the quick paced vocals prevalent in Sondheim’s works in a commanding rendition of The Miller’s Son as flirtatious and spontaneous Petra who savors each passing day. In tight red curls, Carly Evans portrays renowned actress Desiree who falls for an old love which quickly becomes much more complicated than she ever anticipated.\n\nAs for Send in the Clowns, Evans as Desiree delivers a moving rendition that is winsome and rueful, reminding me why I love that song in the first place.\n\nElegantly directed and choreographed by Daniel Sullivan with excellent music direction by Jenny Tsai, Sullivan Rep is in the middle of unveiling its first ambitious season and recently presented Stephen Sondheim’s classic, Tony award-winning musical farce, A Little Night Music live and in person at Newton Town Hall in Newton, Massachusetts through Saturday, June 8.

It does not take long to see that Khonen will go to the ends of the earth and beyond seeking that voice chiming in its ethereal splendor.\n\nUnique, haunting, funny, charming, spiritual, and exceptionally creative, The Dybbuk: Between two worlds is a mesmerizing must-see theatrical experience.\n\nI never use the term ‘must see’ lightly, but it nonetheless fits this particular production in all of its unexpected and immersive twists and turns set exclusively inside a Jewish synagogue. Brimming with unconventional creativity and cultural tradition, The Dybbuk is a spectacular journey and a dark tale steeped in meticulously timed and atmospheric special effects as it unveils a thrilling and enchanting piece of ancient Jewish folklore.\n\nImaginatively directed by Igor Golyak, written by Roy Chen, and based on the original play by S. Ansky, Arlekin Players continues The Dybbuk: Between two Worlds live and in person at The Vilna Shul, Boston’s Center for Jewish Culture in Boston, Massachusetts through Sunday, June 30. This semi-interactive theatrical experience is not limited to the stage and runs 1 hour and 50 minutes with no intermission. Click here for more information and for tickets.\n\nThe Dybbuk: Between two worlds tackles love, marriage, life, death, grief and the in between as well as the significance of a synagogue that still stands after all the turmoil it has endured. As the play observes describing a synagogue, ‘The walls are damp with tears.’ A synagogue can be the center of sorrow or great joy, but above all, a sanctuary of hope when all seems lost.\n\nWhat makes this production so exciting, beautiful and so downright impressive is this complex and powerful tale is wrapped in a riveting experience. The Dybbuk is a grand and exhilarating journey, but it also depicts sweet moments of simplicity from Andrey Berkovskiy as Khonen and Yana Gladkikh as Leah with finesse. Both characters shine in their perspective roles but Berkovskiy’s wondrous curiosity, playfulness, mischievousness, passion and anguish boast a spellbinding charisma. While his good intentions radiate in the smallest of gestures, Berkovskiy’s wide eyed wonder of this world and his boldness are often at odds as he agonizes over his fate. Gladkikh as Leah demonstrates a beautiful vulnerability and conflict in her delicate and porcelain like features infused with a soothing and melodious voice that she also uses to sing. Gladkikh’s Leah is delightful, innocent, romantic, and naïve sharing with Berkovskiy a captivating, giddy, and endearing playfulness in a situation that is eternally complicated.\n\nThis enthusiastic cast blends intensity and humor and although this is an ancient tale, Golyak strings together elements of the traditional and the contemporary. Wearing a string of pearls and a black dress, Deb Martin portrays Leah’s grandmother with a rigid frame yet bold and heightened awareness. Shrewd and protective with a dry sense of humor, Martin as Frade is not to be underestimated.\n\nThe Dybbuk’s immersive and unpredictable setting is fueled by ingenious creativity in Jeff Adelberg’s luminous lighting design seamlessly paired with Fedor Zhuravlev’s robust sound that animates this dark, mystical and ancient world filled with rustic crystal chandeliers and scaffolding that sit beneath a vast skylight by scenic designer Igor Golyak with Sasha Kuznetsova. The Dybbuk’s emotive light and sound deliver an ominous quality, humor, and awe-inspiring surprise nothing less than magical. The transformation of a simple piece of plastic is just a sample of the inventive flair that helps to piece together this often poetic tale.\n\nImaginatively directed by Igor Golyak, written by Roy Chen, and based on the original play by S. Ansky, Arlekin Players continues The Dybbuk: Between two worlds live and in person at The Vilna Shul, Boston’s Center for Jewish Culture in Boston, Massachusetts through Sunday, June 30.

The devotion, the stats, the storytelling, and Stone’s very nature is engrained in this exciting sport and that is only the beginning of Toni Stone’s story.\n\nBased on a true story and engagingly written and directed by Lydia R. Diamond with innovative choreography by Ebony Williams, The Huntington continues Toni Stone live and in person at the Huntington Theatre in Boston, Massachusetts through Sunday, June 16 and streaming online through July 14. The show runs 2 hours and 20 minutes including one intermission. Click here for more information and for tickets.\n\nToni Stone, depicted in this performance by understudy Eunice Woods, approaches baseball with a fearlessness and blind ambition that would inspire anyone to pursue their dreams. A historical figure and natural athlete willing to do whatever it takes to fit in while ignoring the naysayers, Stone possesses the kind of determination needed to become the first woman to play baseball professionally on a regular basis. However well Stone knew baseball though, other areas in life came with uncertainty.\n\nAt the center of this production is Woods as Stone who wittily and engagingly recalls what brings her to the plate playing for an all-male Negro League called The Indianapolis Clowns. The collective team, which Stone affectionately refers to as ‘my boys,’ share a teasing and genuinely likable rapport as they transform into other roles in Stone’s recollections. In a pinstriped suit, Jonathan Kitt portrays smooth and mysterious Alberga with enlightened charm and protectiveness while Stanley Andrew Jackson’s wise and nurturing Milly delivers a number of the show’s well timed dry humor and encouragement.\n\nFrom a bar scene to a steel mill factory to a picturesque stadium setting with flood lights and absorbing lighting by Brian J. Lilienthal, Scenic Designer Collette Pollard’s nostalgic and functional set makes the most out of the Huntington stage as Woods shares Stone’s time jumping memories. The impressive set is likened to a little piece of vintage Fenway Park as the green worn wooden stadium with bleachers display billboards for Stetson and Gimbel to reflect the late 1940s and early 1950s. Aubrey Dube’s rich sound design echoes the swing of the bat, the roar of the crowd, and the sonic play-by-play announcer while Lucas Clopton’s big band and jazz-inspired original music resonates with the ‘Nifty Fifties.’ Bold colors enhance the Indianapolis Clowns in authentic style uniforms right down to the striped baseball stirrups while other costumes add a hat or a subtle touch as members of the team play multiple roles by Costume designer Mara Blumenfeld and Wig, Hair, and makeup artist Earon D. Nealey.\n\nEbony Williams’ dynamic choreography combines athleticism and a touch of Broadway while infusing sweeping 50s era dance moves starting with the swooping opening chorography that not only depicts Stone’s laser focused passion for the game, but the very essence of why people love baseball. After all, Boston is a city steeped in baseball history and known for its avid fans, so it is no surprise that Boston would be an ideal location for this groundbreaking individual to share her story.\n\nThough I do think the show would be further appreciated by fervent baseball fans, Toni Stone’s story is essentially about an individual who is discovering who she is and who she wants to be beyond what society expects from her. Often misunderstood from childhood, Stone faced an uphill battle with few who shared her vision, but never took her eyes off of her heart’s desire. Woods not only depicts Stone’s unconventional and confident persona, but also in braving racism, segregation, and harrowing obstacles and challenges with a combination of anxiety yet unshakable faith that she can do anything with enough persistence. Woods as Stone is funny, lively and confides in the audience like we are old friends.\n\nBased on a true story and engagingly written and directed by Lydia R.
