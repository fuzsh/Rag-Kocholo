        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nInsider broke down the best first-time movie directing efforts by actors.\n\nMichael B. Jordan is the latest actor to have an impressive directorial debut, with \"Creed III.\"\n\nHe joins a list that includes Jordan Peele, Tom Hanks, Olivia Wilde, and Robert De Niro.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"A Bronx Tale\" (1993) — Robert De Niro\n\nInspired by Chaz Palminteri's one-man play about his own youth, \"A Bronx Tale\" follows a kid (Lillo Brancato, Jr.) as he's drawn into the mob and guided by his father (Robert De Niro) to stay away from that life.\n\nLegend has it De Niro saw the play and rushed backstage afterward to tell Palminteri that he wanted to make it into a movie. It marked De Niro's directorial debut, and Palminteri played mobster Sonny, who befriends the boy.\n\nDe Niro has only directed one more movie in the years since — 2006's \"The Good Shepherd.\" Honestly, there's no need for him to direct another. The legend knocks it out of the park with the drama and tension in \"A Bronx Tale.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"A Star Is Born\" (2018) — Bradley Cooper\n\nLady Gaga and Bradley Cooper play the leads in the latest remake of this story about an unknown singer (Gaga) who finds fame and love after being discovered by an aging star (Cooper). Though their chemistry is red-hot on-screen, it's Cooper's directing that is the really impressive thing.\n\nCooper will try to go two-for-two with the upcoming Netflix movie \"Maestro\" in which he plays Leonard Bernstein.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Antwone Fisher\" (2002) — Denzel Washington\n\nTo take the directing reigns for the first time, Washington told this true story about a young Navy officer (Derek Luke) who is forced to see a psychiatrist (Washington) after violent outbursts. We uncover that the man has lived a life filled with hate and abuse.\n\nWashington has continued to direct, with credits including 2007's \"The Great Debaters,\" a 2016 episode of \"Grey's Anatomy,\" and the big-screen adaptation of the Broadway hit \"Fences,\" which earned Viola Davis an Oscar win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Away From Her\" (2006) — Sarah Polley\n\nPolley cowrote and directed this touching look at a husband (Gordon Pinsent) coping with his wife's (Julie Christie) Alzheimer's disease and the complications that arise after she's brought to a home and begins having feelings for another patient.\n\nChristie and Polley were each nominated for Oscars (for best actress and adapted screenplay, respectively.)\n\nPolley has continued to direct acclaimed works like 2011's \"Take This Waltz,\" 2012's \"Stories We Tell,\" and most recently \"Women Talking,\" which earned Polley yet another adapted screenplay nomination at this year's Oscars. The movie is also a best picture nominee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Booksmart\" (2019) — Olivia Wilde\n\nOlivia Wilde instantly made a name for herself as a filmmaker to be reckoned with when she made this high-school comedy that follows two academic-focused seniors (Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein) as they decide to party hard the night before graduation.\n\nThe movie's female-focused feel is a refreshing addition to the genre.\n\nBut let's not bring up Wilde's sophomore effort, \"Don't Worry Darling.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Caddyshack\" (1980) — Harold Ramis\n\nRecounting their memories as golf caddies during their youth, director Harold Ramis and costars Bill Murray and his brother Brian Doyle-Murray forged a hilarious script along with National Lampoon's cofounder Douglas Kenney to create an instant classic.\n\nRamis' directing efforts would be beloved for decades as he helmed \"National Lampoon's Vacation,\" \"Groundhog Day,\" and \"Analyze This\" — all while also being known as one of the Ghostbusters. He played Egon Spengler in the beloved franchise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Citizen Kane\" (1941) — Orson Welles\n\nAfter dazzling audiences with his acting on stage, then literally horrifying listeners on the radio with his \"The War of the Worlds\" broadcast (some really thought aliens were invading), Welles could do anything he wanted in Hollywood.\n\nIt led to him poking one of the biggest living titans at the time when he and screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz used the life and times of newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst to create Charles Foster Kane (played by Welles).\n\nThe movie would go on to be regarded as one of the greatest movies ever made (Welles and Mankiewicz even won the Oscar for best original screenplay).\n\nWelles' battle for control led to fights with studios and fantastical journeys for financing the rest of his life.\n\nThough often he never got it, it still resulted in some acclaimed work (though not fully realized until long after the movies were released) like \"The Magnificent Ambersons,\" \"The Lady from Shanghai,\" \"Touch of Evil,\" \"The Trial,\" and \"F for Fake.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Creed III\" (2023) — Michael B. Jordan\n\nThere's always some fear when you hear an actor is going to direct, especially when their first time in the chair is for a franchise.\n\nBut Michael B. Jordan will make you a believer in his abilities as a storyteller with this movie.\n\nHe doesn't just elevate an already-successful franchise. but does it by getting in some elements that have never been seen in previous movies.\n\nIt's not known yet what he'll direct next, but we'll be the first in line to see it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Dances With Wolves\" (1990) — Kevin Costner\n\nCostner quieted his detractors who criticized him for making a three-hour Western as his directorial debut by scoring 12 Oscar nominations for the movie and winning best picture (a controversial choice seeing it beat out Martin Scorsese's \"Goodfellas\").\n\nCostner has directed two other movies, 1997's \"The Postman\" and 2003's \"Open Range,\" which both found mixed reviews.\n\nHe's currently working on his latest directing effort, \"Horizon,\" an epic set around the Civil War.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Easy Rider\" (1969) — Dennis Hopper\n\nAfter years of being a bad-boy actor, Hopper sat down in the director's chair and sparked a renaissance in Hollywood in the process.\n\nThis low-budget look at two drug-running hippies as they navigate through the US on their motorcycles was nothing anyone had seen before and people couldn't stop watching it.\n\nThe movie wasn't just a hit — it helped pave the way for the likes of Francis Ford Coppola, Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, and Brian De Palma to lead the auteur era.\n\nHopper never found the success as a director that he did with \"Easy Rider,\" but had impressive works with 1988's \"Colors\" and \"The Last Movie,\" a film he made after \"Rider\" but got lost for decades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Eighth Grade\" (2018) — Bo Burnham\n\nAfter becoming known for his stand-up work and then landing roles in movies like \"The Big Sick\" and \"Rough Night,\" Burnham went behind the camera for this tender coming-of-age story about a girl (Elsie Fisher) navigating her social anxiety as she finishes eighth grade.\n\nSince then, Burnham has directed comedy specials for himself (2021's \"Inside\"), Jerrod Carmichael, and Kate Berlant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Frailty\" (2001) — Bill Paxton\n\nBill Paxton has been in front of the camera for plenty of memorable thrilling movies, and one of them also marked his directorial debut.\n\nThis Lionsgate release stars Paxton as a father who believes he's been condemned by God to kill demons disguised as people. Matthew McConaughey plays one of his sons all grown up.\n\nIf you have never seen this, seek it out.
