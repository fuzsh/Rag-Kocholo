        "text": "Sportswriters spare no superlatives on Michael Jordan, a 6'6\" shooting guard whose unearthly talents took him to the heights of commercial celebrity and dominance in the sport of basketball and made him oft-labeled the player of all time. Jordan leapt onto the national stage with a last-second jump-shot to seal UNC's 1982 NCAA Championship.\n\nDrafted by the Chicago Bulls in 1984, he lit up the National Basketball Association with gravity-defying dunks and acrobatic scoring bursts. He became the league's perennial scoring leader, but it would take the mentoring of coach Phil Jackson to add substance to Jordan's flash. He morphed into a true team player in leading the Bulls to their first-ever title in 1991.\n\nJordan drove the Bulls to five more championships through 1998, interrupted only by Quixotic mid-career \"retirement\" to take a shot at big-league baseball. A true celebrity, he became a ubiquitous presence in advertising and even starred in a big-budget film alongside Bugs Bunny. After retiring and taking a front-office job with Washington Wizards, he suited up again in 2001 for a much less successful stint with that team.\n\nIn 2010, he bought majority ownership of the Charlotte Bobcats, but his tenure would be much-maligned. A one-man marketing institution, 14-time All-Star, five-time NBA MVP, ten-time scoring champion, six-time Finals MVP and the only athlete to grace the cover of Sports Illustrated 47 times, Jordan left an almost superhuman legacy.\n\nHe was born Michael Jeffrey Jordan on Feb. 17, 1963 in Brooklyn, NY, the fourth of five children of James and Deloris Jordan. Not long after, the family moved to Wilmington, NC, where Michael would grow up. He developed an early affinity for sports, particularly baseball, and became a standout Little League pitcher, tossing no-hitters when he was just 12 years old.\n\nHis team even came within a game of making it to the Little League World Series. He began honing his basketball talents in efforts to compete with older brother Larry, who routinely beat him in one-on-one games. It was just one catalyst in Jordan's development of a fierce competitive streak.\n\nAnother came at Wilmington's Laney High School when he failed to make the varsity basketball squad his sophomore year as a 5'11\" guard. Michael grew four inches in the off-season, worked obsessively on his game, and returned to the team the next year, transformed into a 20-plus points-per-game scorer.\n\nAs a 6'5\" senior, Jordan torched opponents, averaging what was normally a rare on-court performance for any other player, a triple-double: 29.2 points, 11.6 rebounds, and 10.1 assists per game. Named a McDonald's All-American, Jordan was heavily recruited by major universities but chose to stay home and join coach Dean Smith's storied program at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.\n\nMatriculating at UNC in 1981, he scored 13.4 points per game and earned the Atlantic Coast Conference's Freshman of the Year laurel. The star-studded UNC team went to the NCAA Final Four and, ultimately, the championship game against Georgetown. Jordan put an exclamation point on the game with a late jump-shot to give the Tarheels the lead and the title.\n\nHe would up his average to 20 ppg and be voted a First Team All-American in 1983 and 1984 and garner the Naismith and Wooden College Player of the Year awards in 1984. His college stat-line would later inspire the joke that the best defense ever played against Jordan was Dean Smith's offense. Jordan declared for the NBA draft after his junior year and was selected by the Chicago Bulls with the No. 3 overall pick.\n\nHe joined the U.S. national team that summer and helped it win gold at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. Donning a Bulls uniform, he dazzled sports media and fans as a slashing, soaring scorer - with a curious trademark of sticking his tongue out as he made his moves - and averaged 28.2 ppg in his first season.\n\nHe became such a media spectacle that, upon Jordan's selection to the East team for the NBA's annual All-Star Game, Detroit Pistons point guard Isiah Thomas reportedly coordinated a \"freeze-out\" amongst a contingent of East players, who agreed to not pass the young upstart the ball. It was the beginning of a bitter rivalry between Jordan and Thomas. For all of Jordan's firepower, the Bulls struggled as a team.\n\nAfter breaking a foot, he missed the majority of the 1985-86 season. He healed in time for the playoffs, where the Bulls drew perennial Eastern powerhouse the Boston Celtics. The Celtics swept the series, withstanding Jordan's playoff-record 63 points in Game 2. The Celtics' future Hall-of-Fame forward Larry Bird told reporters after the game, \"That was God disguised as Michael Jordan.\"\n\nAthletic-wear marketer Nike further built his iconic status by featuring him in some of the edgiest advertising of the time, as paired with filmmaker Spike Lee in the guise of his film character Mars Blackmon, the ultimate smack-talking fan. American youth anticipated annual new designs of Air Jordan sneakers each fall as if an automotive new model year, and Nike eventually expanded the imprint into an apparel sub-brand.\n\nJordan averaged 37.1 points per game in the 1986-87 season, becoming the only NBA player other than 1960s great Wilt Chamberlain to score 3,000 points in a single season. But it bespoke an imbalance to the Bulls offense as the team failed to reach a .500 win percentage and again suffered a first-round playoff loss. He led the NBA in scoring again with 35 ppg in the 1987-88 season and dug in as a defender, averaging a league-best 3.16 steals a game as well as 1.6 blocked shots, an unheard of figure for a guard.\n\nWith the Bulls improving to a 50-32 record, Jordan earned his first MVP trophy as well as the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year Award. The Bulls made it to the Conference Semifinals and a shot at the Pistons, then known as the \"Bad Boys\" for physically tough play, led by Thomas, center Bill Laimbeer and forward Dennis Rodman. The Pistons sent the Bulls packing in what became an annual rite for the Eastern Conference playoffs.\n\nConference Finals rematches with the Pistons in 1989 and 1990 ended in bruising losses highlighted by cheap shots and almost-brawls, as the Bad Boys went on to win back-to-back NBA titles. But with young forwards Scottie Pippen and Horace Grant developing, catalyzed by the firing of head coach Doug Collins and promotion of Phil Jackson to the job, the team had begun to gel.\n\nIn spite of Jordan's proliferating product endorsements - he appeared in voluminous ads for Gatorade, Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Wheaties and Hanes - and correlative Boy Scout image, professionally his ego grew with his skills and he developed a reputation as a trash-talking terror on court and a me-first player as a teammate.
