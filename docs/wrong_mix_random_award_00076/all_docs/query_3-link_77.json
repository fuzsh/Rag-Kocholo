        "text": "The most valuable role player in “The Last Dance” isn’t Steve Kerr, John Paxson or Toni Kukoc. It’s the music. Music supervisor Randy Chung and director Jason Hehir expertly assembled and sequenced the soundtrack to ESPN’s epic and entertaining Michael Jordan/Chicago Bulls docuseries.\n\nThis spring with sports taking an extended timeout due to coronavirus, “Last Dance” gave fans something to help fill the void. It also mercifully prevented trashy Netflix sensation “Tiger King” from being 2020′s sole pop monoculture. Although, at times “The Last Dance” steps over documentary filmmaking’s metaphorical free throw line and into puff piece-dom.\n\nBy the time the 10 -part series concludes, \"Last Dance\" doesn't just remind us how much more watchable Jordan and '90s NBA was than LeBron James and contemporary pro basketball. It also put a slew of vibrant tracks, mostly from that era and often rap, back on our playlist rosters. There are some unexpected alt-rock selections too, including Pearl Jam and Soul Coughing tunes.\n\nInspired synchs to Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman being awesome on-court also evokes how much fun peak MTV was. When song and sight combined to become more than the sum of their parts. Kind of like an elite team.\n\nAll told, 40 or so songs were featured in \"The Last Dance.\" The 10 best are below.\n\n[On a side note, my AL.com colleague Roy Johnson appears in “The Last Dance,” with insightful commentary from his days covering Jordan for the likes of New York Times, Sports Illustrated, etc. Roy’s recent column about his experience thereof is also fantastic.]\n\n10. “Sirius”\n\nBy: Alan Parsons Project\n\nReleased: 1982\n\n\"The Last Dance\" episode: 3\n\nIntense ambience by former Beatles recording engineer Alan Parsons' band, repurposed as the Bulls' intro theme. Various other sportsball teams, from the NFL's New Orleans Saints to NCAA's Nebraska Cornhuskers, followed suit.\n\n9. “Connected”\n\nBy: Stereo MC’s\n\nReleased: 1992\n\n\"The Last Dance\" episode: 6\n\nBrit electronic crew's hypno-hit scores episode in which tell-all book \"The Jordan Rules\" seems to pose a bigger threat to a Bulls threepeat than Charles Barkely's Phoenix Suns.\n\n8. \"The Choice Is Yours (Revisited)\"\n\nBy: Black Sheep\n\nReleased: 1991\n\n\"The Last Dance\" episode: 5\n\nJazzy cut flows like the triangle offense, as the Bulls vie for their first back-to-back title.\n\n7. “I Feel Free”\n\nBy: Cream\n\nReleased: 1966\n\n\"The Last Dance\" episode: 4\n\nThe soundtrack smartly leans on period-correct rap/R&B, but classic rock gets called off the bench for an episode focusing on Phil Jackson, a cerebral tripper who put the \"head\" in head coach.\n\n6. “How Ya Like Me Now”\n\nBy Kool Moe Dee\n\nReleased: 1987\n\n\"The Last Dance\" episode: 4\n\nPunctuates a sequence in which Jordan’s Bulls vanquish playoff nemesis Detroit Pistons after years of getting knocked around by Bad Boys like future freakazoid teammate Rodman and unlikeable center Bill Laimbeer. Kool Moe Dee’s syncopated bark and a vintage James Brown sample are the track’s co-MVPs.\n\n5. “Can I Kick It?”\n\nBy: A Tribe Called Quest\n\nReleased: 1990\n\n\"The Last Dance\" episode: 5\n\nArt-rap gem built on a sample of Lou Reed’s 1972 underbelly anthem “Walk on the Wild Side.” The musical highlight of Dream Team chronicling episode five, also boasting choice cuts from Special Ed and OutKast, as well as the “Be Like Mike” Gatorade jingle.\n\n4. “I’m Bad”\n\nBy: LL Cool J\n\nReleased: 1987\n\n\"The Last Dance\" episode: 2\n\nSynched to Jordan torching Boston Celtics for 63 in the playoffs, the blaxploitation intro to LL’s relentless braggadocio induces goosebumps. True story: I saw a concert on LL Cool J’s tour in support of the album “I’m Bad” appears on, “Bigger and Deffer.” His set that night opened with LL being shot out of the cassette deck of a giant boom box onstage. Not even MJ can beat that entrance.\n\n3. “Hip Hop Hooray”\n\nBy: Naughty By Nature\n\nReleased: 1992\n\n\"The Last Dance\" episode: 6\n\nA sonic victory lap smooth as an MJ fadeaway.\n\n2. “Partyman”\n\nBy: Prince\n\nReleased: 1989\n\n\"The Last Dance\" episode: 3\n\nIt's easy to forget how big a deal Prince's soundtrack to Hollywood's first big-budget \"Batman\" adaptation was back then. Probably because Prince's masterworks (\"1999,\" \"Sign O' the Times,\" \"Purple Rain,\" etc.) drown out some of his other worthy records, and superhero movies became ubiquitous. But decades later, \"Partyman\" still raises the roof like a posterizing dunk.\n\n1. “I Ain’t No Joke”\n\nBy: Eric B. & Rakim\n\nReleased: 1987\n\n\"The Last Dance\" episode: 1\n\nRakim’s vocal tone is rap’s equivalent of Miles Davis’ trumpet sound. Or an audio version of Air Jordan in flight. Poetry in motion. DJ Eric B. was a genius at reimagining classic soul samples into new head-bobbers. Like Jordan, in their day this Long Island duo were undisputed merchants of cool to anyone who experienced them.\n\nMORE ON MUSIC\n\nWhat it was like being at Little Richard’s funeral\n\nLittle Richard’s deep, slightly complicated Alabama roots\n\nThe top 10 solo stars to play guitar for ever\n\n25 must-hear live albums from the last 25 years"
