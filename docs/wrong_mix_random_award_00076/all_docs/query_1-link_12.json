        "text": "Air, a blockbuster movie that tells the story of the athlete-inspired Air Jordan trainers, opened in theatres everywhere on Wednesday 5 April.\n\nIt is created by one of Hollywood's longest-running and most special friendships: Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. Affleck is the director and also stars alongside Damon, while helping to write the screenplay with Alex Convery.\n\nThe film tells the story of Nike's bet on a rookie at the time, Michael Jordan, to make the basketball starlet the best basketball player of all time and the brand the leader and reference in sports footwear.\n\nUndoubtedly, they revolutionised the business and sports world with the new line of shoes, but what surprises many is that in the film there is no trace of one of the key player: Michael Jordan.\n\nHe's too big for anyone to imitate\n\nIn the midst of promoting the film, Ben Affleck has given an interview to the Hollywood Reporter, where he explained the conscious and excellent decision for the star not to appear in the film.\n\n\"When you become much more than a hero, an athlete or even an icon, you start to be an idea to people. You touch them and you start to represent hope, excellence and greatness. You are unique,\" he began.\n\n\"There was no way I was going to ask the public to believe that someone other than Michael Jordan was Michael Jordan. It was a deliberate choice. I thought he was too majestic for anyone to imitate. Jordan is too big,\" he continued.\n\n\"I said 'Mike, I'm not going to make the film if you're not OK with something about it. I'm just not going to do it. I just want to know what's important to you'. I was very clear,\" Affleck concluded about how important it was to him that Michael was satisfied and happy with the story."
