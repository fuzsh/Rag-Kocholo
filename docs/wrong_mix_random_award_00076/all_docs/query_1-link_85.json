        "text": "Michael B. Jordan is set to direct the fourth installment of the \"Creed\" film franchise, according to producer Irwin Winkler. This comes after Jordan's directorial debut in \"Creed 3,\" which premiered in theaters earlier this year and broke box office records with a $58 million opening weekend.\n\nWhile MGM has not yet commented on the development of \"Creed 4,\" it is clear that the franchise is expanding and exploring new possibilities. Back in March, Variety reported that Jordan and Amazon were in talks to expand the \"Creed\" universe with new film and TV projects. This was following Amazon's acquisition of MGM, which opened up new opportunities for the franchise.\n\nWinkler shared his excitement for the upcoming film, saying: \"We're planning to do 'Creed 4' right now - it's in the works - and we think we have a really good story, a really good plot.\" He also mentioned that plans were delayed due to the industry-wide strike, but they are aiming for pre-production to begin in about a year.\n\nIt all started with Stallone's 'Rocky'\n\nThe \"Creed\" franchise has been a successful spinoff of the \"Rocky\" series, with Jordan playing Adonis Creed, the son of Rocky's former rival Apollo Creed. Sylvester Stallone reprised his role as Rocky Balboa in the first two \"Creed\" films, but did not appear in \"Creed 3.\" Jordan has been praised for his portrayal of Adonis and his work as a director in the latest installment.\n\nFans of the franchise are eagerly anticipating what \"Creed 4\" will bring to the table. With Jordan at the helm as director and a promising story in the works, it is sure to be another hit for the series."
