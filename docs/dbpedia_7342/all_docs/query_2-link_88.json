        "text": "So I asked for mailbag questions a few days ago, when it was a billion degrees. Nothing pairs better with weather that horrendous than, essentially, asking someone else to do your job.\n\nNow it’s nice again — go figure — but the point stands. It’s summer. Let’s hang out for a little.\n\nIn your experience, where is the best public restroom in Pittsburgh?\n\nSam W.\n\nI started with this one for a reason: If there’s one thing to know in life, it’s that virtually every hotel lobby has a good bathroom that you can use, no questions asked. Hotel toilets — one of our nation’s great untapped resources.\n\n1. Walk in with a purpose.\n\n2. Don’t unnecessarily talk to anyone. You don’t need a backstory.\n\n3. Give a “head nod” or “hello” to the desk attendant, if the situation dictates it.\n\n4. Look for the signs. You probably won’t need to ask.\n\n5. Take care of business.\n\nThat applies in, like, a Holiday Inn Express. It’s even more hassle-free at your nicer hotels. That’s why my pick — and by proxy, the official stance of The Athletic — is the William Penn. Such luxury!\n\nAlso, the Red Lobster on McKnight Road has a pretty nice setup.\n\nWhich current penguins prospect are you most looking forward to seeing get a shot in the NHL and why? Let’s take Poulin off the table just for the sake of discussion.\n\nGliz/@frank_gliz\n\nPersonally, I’d like to see Zachary Lauzon if only because of how rough the last couple years have been for him. He seems like a nice kid, and it’d be cool to see things work out for him.\n\nBeyond that, how about Calen Addison? Maybe I’ve got a soft spot for small-ish defenseman with that sort of offensive ability. He’s a great skater, by all accounts, who has averaged nearly a point per game for two straight seasons. Great skating, maybe more than anything else in hockey, is fun to watch. Same goes for high upside. He fits both descriptions. I know it’s been more than a year, but Jesse Marshall’s post-draft write-up is a great starting point.\n\nOne of my favorite fluff things you wrote was the story of the rogue catfish-tosser in the 2017 Stanley Cup playoffs. Do you have a favorite weird happening you’ve written about or witnessed?\n\nSheryl/@Serenade_az\n\nOther than your pick, probably the 2012-13 lockout. It wasn’t a fluffy topic overall, obviously, but the sheer length of it combined with the daily need to actually, y’know, report and write stuff led to people losing their marbles. The peak was probably in November, when one of the federal mediators assigned to the situation was removed because he had a bunch of weird tweets, including one that involved the hashtag “#assmode.”\n\nMind you, my only job back then was covering hockey, so waking up every morning and knowing that you had to cover hockey when there was no hockey — for months — was, at times, surreal.\n\nAlso, the Penguins’ 2017 parade.\n\nPlease provide a taste test and definitive ranking of all Turner’s Tea products.\n\nRyan/@euromicitisus\n\nI’ll tackle the full question at some point, but for now: Don’t buy the “Black and Gold” Arnold Palmer-style drink buy itself. Get one normal iced tea and one lemonade, and combine them to your preferred proportions. I go with 3/4 tea, 1/4 lemonade.\n\nIf Pittsburgh got an NBA team, what would you name it?\n\nBen Wright/@BenWrightATL\n\nAh yes, a question I’ll never stop thinking about. Pipers is the obvious answer. More people remember the Condors, probably, but what were they if not the Zombie Pipers? So you’ve got positive history, alliteration and another bird name that begins with ‘P.’\n\nReally though, long as it wasn’t a weird collective noun like “Power” or “Furnace,” I’d be good. Also, I generally don’t need any more references to the steel industry unless you call them the Barons in honor of Andrew Carnegie. “Pinkertons” would be too on-the-nose.\n\nHow many bloomin’ onions can you eat in one sitting?\n\n@ErikBlevins\n\nA classic B.O. has a little less than 2,000 calories. I could put down three.\n\nPlease put together a playlist of walk-up music for as many Pgh athletes as you see fit (not limited to Pirates).\n\nBill West/@Just_BWest\n\nAnother thing I think about all the time. Back in 2009, I got it in my head that Mellon Arena should’ve played “Hair of the Dog” by Nazareth whenever Bill Guerin scored. It made almost too much sense.\n\nAlso, the fact that Josh Bell moved away from “Keep Their Heads Ringin’” still boggles my mind.\n\nWhat happened to the Eat N Park cookie? Did they cheap out on it or did we just grow up?\n\nNick Case/@Nick422\n\nThe overall point is that stuff you like as a kid doesn’t carry over to adulthood as your preferences change. Which, yeah — try eating a Fruit Roll-Up or something. It won’t be the same. Same goes for Milwaukee’s Best.\n\nThat said, Smiley Cookies stay trash. The right move was always to just eat the eyes then throw it away. Stale is stale.\n\nhow come everyone hates on phil kessel?\n\n@WebstarVanCity\n\nWhere are all these people that hate Phil Kessel? I sincerely haven’t come across anyone here who hates the dude. Lots of people love him, and a much smaller amount of people — important ones, in some cases — got sort of sick of him. But honestly, he’s largely a hero in these parts, as he should be. Were there some people who, maybe, appreciated him less than they should’ve? I guess. Did anyone hate him? I honestly didn’t see it.\n\nNow, “hating on” is a little bit of a different set of qualifications. The root of that: He’s been a great player unlike, really, any we’ve seen in a while. It’s a question of optics. He could pass for a dude at a bus stop, and I think that can break peoples’ brains.\n\nFavorite arena in Pittsburgh?\n\nMichael Pegula/@MikeyBlueEyez86\n\nFor sheer aesthetics, we don’t really have a choice here, do we? Pound for pound, I’d still rather spend a day in the sun at PNC than any of the other places. I still really like going to the Pete, and I’m glad the games are on track to be fun again at some point.\n\nBeyond the obvious ones, everyone should go see a game at the Wolvarena in Turtle Creek. To me, that’s what high school football is all about. Also, CMU’s football stadium does something for me. Might be because my track team practiced there in high school, but I still run over there pretty regularly.\n\nIs it ok to buy a caps or flyers jersey if its, like, Jagr, Tocchet, or another pens legend?\n\nSurm/@RickNebraska\n\nYou’re an adult. You can do what you want. I haven’t bought a jersey since college, but that’s just because I started thinking I looked dumb in them, then got a job where wearing jerseys around would be sort of weird. Do whatever.\n\nThat said, I don’t see how wearing a Flyers or Caps or Rod Woodson Ravens jersey or basically anything like that would be worth it. You’re gonna get hassled no matter who is on the back. Constantly. The closest thing that’d be worth trying to pull off: an Andrew McCutchen Phillies jersey. That rivalry isn’t the same as the ones you’re talking about, though.\n\nWill the Penguins make the playoffs?\n\nJohn Zivkovic/@Zippy587\n\nYeah, I think so. Even if you think the Islanders, Caps and Hurricanes can pull off similar seasons, the Rangers are a lot better — as they should be, given that they added Artemi Panarin, Jacob Trouba and Kaapo Kakko — and the Blue Jackets are a lot worse.\n\nBeyond that, the Devils improved, but not 25 points’ worth. The Flyers will benefit from a full season of Carter Hart, but … are you really going to pencil them into a wild-card spot? Because I’m not. I think the Penguins are still solidly somewhere in the Metro’s top four, and beyond that, I think the division is more likely than not to get five of the eight playoff spots, anyway.\n\nWhat PS4 games have you been into lately?\n\nKelly W.\n\nI was basically a year late getting into “Spider-Man,” and I feel stupid about it. It’s got an MCU-caliber story, definitely the best I’ve seen in a comic book game. If it were the plot of a movie, I’d be A-OK. The melee combat is a blast, and the best part of the whole deal is just swinging around Manhattan. That sounds like a complaint; it isn’t. I’m going to hit 100 percent completion on it and play all the downloadable content, and I don’t know the last time I did that.\n\nAny chance Jaylen Samuels gets work almost like a pass catching TE or is he strictly a back?\n\nJoel S.\n\nYeah, I think so. Eddie Faulkner, the Steelers’ new RBs coach, was Samuels’ coach at N.C. State, and they used him that way a whole bunch. Plus, the Steelers’ backup tight-end situation isn’t great. Whatever you think of Xavier Grimble as a No. 2, the third-stringer is going to be someone wholly unproven, and Vance McDonald isn’t the most injury-proof guy on Earth. I don’t think it’s going to be a 50/50 split for Samuels or anything like that, but why draft a guy with that sort of versatility and not use it? Faulker certainly didn’t sound opposed to it at minicamp.\n\nFavorite mid-Atlantic City to visit?\n\nJack G.\n\nLast fall, my answer would’ve been Ocean City, N.J. solely because of the Golden Nugget sports book. Lost most of a weekend there. I can do that down the street now, though.\n\nI’m looking for a spot with good shows, great food and cool neighborhoods — so I’m going Philly, baby. The Tommy DiNic’s roast pork/Dalessandro’s steak double-header is something I’ve done before and will do again. Also, I want to eat at Zahav. Mix all that in with a great music scene and a really good NBA team, and I’m good to go.\n\nWhich Pittsburgh sports owner would be the most likely to get fooled by Lyle Lanley and build a shoddy monorail to their respective stadium?\n\nMichael S.\n\nI almost fell in an obvious trap here, then realized the odds of any Pittsburgh sports owner willingly paying for something like that themselves is true madness. Also, all three are already are served by a shoddy monorail. Checkmate, my good man.\n\n(Top photo of Calen Addison: Shelley Lipton/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)"
