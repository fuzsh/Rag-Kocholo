        "meta_description": "James Russell Howard III (born March 26, 1984) is an American professional ice hockey goalie who is currently playing for the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League (NHL). Howard was runner up in voting for the Calder Memorial Trophy following the 2009–10 NHL season as the NHL's rookie of the year.\n\t\n\tOn April 14, 2010, Howard played in his first NHL playoff game, a 3–2 loss to the Phoenix Coyotes. On April 20, he recorded his first career playoff shutout, making 29 saves in a 3–0 win over the Coyotes. The Coyotes were eliminated by the Red Wings when Howard's first NHL playoff series went to seven games. The Detroit Red Wings were then eliminated by the San Jose Sharks in five games. Howard recorded a 2.75 goals against average with a .915 save percentage during the postseason.\n\t\n\tHoward was also a 2010 Calder Memorial Trophy finalist, but was runner-up to Buffalo's Tyler Myers. Howard won the 2010 Detroit Red Wings-Detroit Sports Broadcasters Association Rookie of the Year Award.\n\t\n\tHoward recorded a 21 save shutout in Detroit's season opener against the Anaheim Ducks to kick off the 2010–11 NHL season. On February 28, 2011, Howard signed a two-year contract extension with the Red Wings worth $2.25 million per season.  The Red Wings lost in seven games to the San Jose Sharks in the 2nd round of the playoffs.\n\t\n\tOn January 23, 2012, in the Red Wings 49th game, Jimmy Howard recorded his 30th win of the season, before the All-Star break. The win was Detroit's 17th consecutive home victory and kept them in first place in the standings. Howard would win only five more games after the All-Star break, because of a broken finger on his stick hand suffered on February 3, 2012, that made him miss eight games, and a reoccurring groin injury later in the season that scratched him in seven other games.\n\t\n\tDuring the lockout-shortened 2012–13 NHL season, Howard recorded a 21–13–7 record as the Red Wings eventually clinched their 22nd consecutive playoff berth. On April 16, 2013, Howard signed a six-year, $31.8 million contract extension with the Red Wings.\n\t\n\tDuring the 2014–15 NHL season, Howard recorded a 16–7–7 record, with a 2.11 GAA and a .921 save percentage prior to the All-Star break. Howard was named to the NHL All-Star Game, however he was unable to participate due to suffering a groin tear on January 10, in a game against the Washington Capitals, and missed five weeks of the season. Following his return from his injury, Howard recorded a 7–6–4 record, with 2.99 GAA and a .896 save percentage.\n\t\n\tHoward's performance declined further in the 2015-16 season, and youngster Petr Mrazek got more starts throughout the season than Howard. However, on April 6, 2016, Howard recorded his 22nd shutout victory in franchise history against the Philadelphia Flyers in a 3-0 game at Joe Louis Arena moving him to fourth.\n\t\n\t<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Howard\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Howard</a>\n\t\n\t<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_...</a>",
