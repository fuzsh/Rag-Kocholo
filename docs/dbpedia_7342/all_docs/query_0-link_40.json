        "text": "The Pittsburgh Penguins re-signed veteran agitator Matt Cooke for three years, the club announced on Tuesday.\n\nThe Penguins said that the average annual value of the deal for the 31-year-old Cooke is $1.8 million US over the term of the contract.\n\nCooke scored 15 goals 30 points with 106 penalty minutes in his second season with Pittsburgh. He added four goals in 13 playoff games — tied for third on the team — to go with two assists.\n\nThe Belleville, Ont., native has previously played for Vancouver and Washington.\n\nCooke was suspended two games for a hit to the head on Artem Anisimov of the New York Rangers the past season, and later in the campaign put Marc Savard out of action for several weeks with a hit that caught the Boston Bruins centre unawares.\n\nCooke did not get suspended for the Savard incident, but the play was a catalyst for new penalties regarding blindside hits.\n\nThe Penguins announced a deal Monday for young defenceman Ben Lovejoy, to also run through the 2012-13 season."
