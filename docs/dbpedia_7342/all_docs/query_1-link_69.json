        "text": "The NHL GM of the Year award is a new honor in the league, first given in 2009-10. The recipient is selected annually by a vote of all NHL team general managers, five NHL executives and five members of the media. Award winners to date are:\n\n2009-10 — Don Maloney, Phoenix Coyotes\n\n2010-11 — Mike Gillis, Vancouver Canucks\n\n2011-12 — Doug Armstrong, St. Louis Blues\n\n2012-13 — Ray Shero, Pittsburgh Penguins\n\n2013-14 — Bob Murray, Anaheim Ducks\n\n2014-15 — Steve Yzerman, Tampa Bay Lightning\n\n2015-16 — Jim Rutherford, Pittsburgh Penguins\n\n2016-17 — David Poile, Nashville Predators\n\n2017-18 — George McPhee, Vegas Golden Knights\n\nAbout the NHL GM of the Year Recipients\n\nHere is what the award recipients accomplished in the year they were selected.\n\nDon Maloney guided the (then ownerless) Coyotes to its best regular season ever in 2009-10. From Lindsay, Ontario, Maloney played for the New York Rangers, Hartford Whalers and New York Islanders. He scored 29 goals for the Rangers in 1982-83.\n\nMike Gillis, from Sudbury, Ontario, steered the Canucks to the best regular-season record and to the Stanley Cup Final in 2010-11.\n\nDoug Armstrong guided the Blues to their first 100-point season with a club that broke several team records in 2011-12. From Sarnia, Ontario, Armstrong started his NHL front office career with the Dallas Stars in 1991.\n\nRay Shero, who became Pittsburgh GM in 2006, accumulated one Stanley Cup, two Cup Finals and seven straight postseason appearances when he won GM of the Year honors in 2012-13. From St. Paul, Minnesota, Shero is the son of Fred Shero, who won the first Jack Adams Award for Coach of the Year in 1974.\n\nBob Murray built a strong contender in the Ducks, with division titles in consecutive seasons and their best record in team history in 2013-14, with 116 points. From Kingston, Ontario, Murray played most of his career for the Chicago Blackhawks, with 132 career goals.\n\nSteve Yzerman’s Tampa Bay team won a team-best 50 regular-season games in 2014-15, and also led the NHL with 262 goals and 32 home-ice wins. From Cranbrook, British Columbia, Yzerman had a stellar playing career for the Detroit Red Wings, winning three Stanley Cups with the team (he won one more as GM of the Lightning in 2008).\n\nJim Rutherford made a number of major personnel moves in 2015-16 that ultimately led to a Stanley Cup victory for the Penguins. Born in Beeton, Ontario, Rutherford was GM and part owner of the Carolina Hurricanes when they won the Stanley Cup in 2006.\n\nDavid Poile, with more than 35 years as an NHL general manager, is the longest-serving GM in league history. His player trades in 2016-17 helped produce a Stanley Cup Final appearance for the Predators. From Toronto, Ontario, Poile is also the winningest GM in NHL history.\n\nGeorge McPhee led the Vegas Golden Knights to the Stanley Cup Final in its first year as a franchise — enough said. From Guelph, Ontario, McPhee played in the NHL for the New York Rangers and New Jersey Devils.\n\nSide note: If you want to win the NHL General Manager of the Year award, it helps to be born in Ontario. All but three award recipients hail from that province."
