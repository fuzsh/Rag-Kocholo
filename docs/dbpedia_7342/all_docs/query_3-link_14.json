        "text": "Ask anybody in Pittsburgh about the Penguins, including the Pittsburgh Penguins themselves, and a similar refrain is heard: “It’s been a long summer.”\n\nNot since the mid-2000s had Pittsburgh known a lengthier offseason than the one that followed a chaotic, franchise-altering last season.\n\nBut the Penguins’ historic trio of captain Sidney Crosby and longtime alternates Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang — the three longest-tenured teammates in modern North American sports history — are determined to push together for another Stanley Cup run past another presidential election.\n\nIt won’t be easy. It might not be probable. But that’s the plan in Pittsburgh, and everybody from the big three to Fenway Sports Group to new hockey head Kyle Dubas has gone all in on chasing another championship. Reasonable people can disagree about this strategy, but Dubas didn’t hook Erik Karlsson, keep Tristan Jarry or make over the bottom six for the Penguins to gently pass into the night in so far as being contenders.\n\nInternally, expectations are high. Externally, the Penguins are forecasted to be a trendy Stanley Cup pick, a fringe playoff team or somewhere in between.\n\nMore than in past seasons, this one arrives with a sense that anything could happen. What follows are storylines we expect to play out for the Penguins.\n\nConstant bottom-six tinkering\n\nDubas said he will weaponize waivers to improve the Penguins. He might have already done that when picking up Jansen Harkins during the final week of training camp. Clearly, offseason additions of veterans such as Lars Eller, Noel Acciari and Matt Nieto did not sufficiently remake the bottom six to Dubas’ satisfaction.\n\nThose three are locks to start the season with firm support roles. So, too, is Jeff Carter and probably Drew O’Connor.\n\nStill, it doesn’t feel like only one bottom-six spot is available. With a renewed prioritization of stocking AHL affiliate Wilkes-Barre Scranton with NHL-capable veterans, Dubas has given coach Mike Sullivan sufficient options in case players who begin the season in the bottom six struggle.\n\nFans should turn on their social media notifications for Penguins transactions. — Rossi\n\nIt’s not the power play that becomes a cause for concern\n\nOh, the power play will be the focus of much attention. A club doesn’t add one of the NHL’s greatest offensive defensemen to a power play that includes three future Hall of Famers and avoid the spotlight.\n\nBut what about the penalty kill?\n\nAlthough just outside the top 10 in terms of PK efficiency this decade, the Penguins were under 80 percent last season. Eight of the 14 clubs that killed penalties at a rate above 80 percent made the playoffs, and 10 Eastern Conference teams finished ahead of the Penguins on the PK.\n\nTheir failure to adequately stop opposing power plays played into the Penguins’ missing the playoffs by a point. Presumably, Dubas’ focus on adding defensively conscious forwards to fill out the bottom six was an acknowledgment that more penalty killers were needed for a return to contender status.\n\nThere is only so much those new forwards can do, though. And with Karlsson not exactly known for defending, the Penguins figure to rely a lot on Marcus Pettersson, Ryan Graves and Letang — the latter perhaps too much, especially if he’s going to see significant power-play action. If the roster lacks anything, it’s probably enough defensemen to adequately fulfill the needs of the PK. — Rossi\n\nCrosby’s last good shot at another Hart Trophy\n\nOnly seven players have won the Hart Trophy at or after their age-33 seasons. The last was Dominik Hasek, who was 33 when he won in 1997-98, and the two players who won at age 35 (Herb Gardiner, Eddie Shore) in 1926-27 and 1937-38.\n\nCrosby is 36. The odds are against him, as days contending for a scoring championship — the traditional route to a Hart Trophy — are admittedly past him.\n\nA juicy narrative can drive a Hart Trophy campaign. Would there be a juicer narrative than an aging Crosby — likely robbed of more Hart wins because of the concussion and jaw injuries that wiped out large portions of his 2010-11 through 2012-13 seasons — leading the Penguins back to the playoffs the season after their streak ended?\n\nCan’t think of one.\n\nA lot of things would have to happen. The Penguins would need to make the playoffs. Crosby would probably need a minimum of 35 goals/90 points, and putting together a Selke-caliber season wouldn’t hurt.\n\nBut all of those things aren’t inconceivable. If the hockey stars align, Crosby winning his third Hart Trophy — only Wayne Gretzky (nine), Gordie Howe (six) and Shore (four) have won more — in the same season in which another generational talent, Connor Bedard, debuts could catch on among Professional Hockey Writers’ Association voters. — Rossi\n\nHow does it end?\n\nThe aging stars stay surprisingly healthy, Jarry finds top-five form in the net, the power play (after a slow start) goes off starting in January, and the Penguins find themselves with home-ice advantage in the opening round of the playoffs. They make unexpected quick work of the New York Rangers, exorcising some postseason demons, and that momentum carries them to the conference final. And then … who knows? — Rossi\n\nIs Jarry the right goalie?\n\nOh, he will be in the spotlight this season, and in a big way. How can he not be?\n\nJarry looked fine in training camp, and I believe he’s healthy following last season’s medical mess. My question is whether he’s mentally equipped to be the goaltender for this team. We’ve already witnessed Jarry having some mental breakdowns in big games over the years.\n\nNow consider that the Penguins will be playing high-scoring games night after night. You know that 7-4 preseason win in Buffalo on Friday? Get used to seeing games like that this season. It takes a goaltender with a certain kind of temperament to tolerate playing on a team that puts that much pressure on him. This isn’t some great defensive team.\n\nLet’s see how he holds up. — Yohe\n\nDoes Guentzel get a new contract?\n\nJake Guentzel turned 29 on Friday. In this franchise, that makes him a kid.\n\nHe’s Crosby’s favorite winger ever. He’s good for 30-40 goals every season. He’s a playoff monster. I have every reason to believe he wants to stay in Pittsburgh.\n\nSo you have to lock him up, right?\n\nProbably. But then, he’s coming off a second major injury in his career, he is a year from 30 and he’s frail. It’s fair to wonder how he’s going to age into his 30s. He’s not all that fast or big. Will he still be this effective at 33, when Crosby will be 40 and potentially retired?\n\nIt’s a fascinating situation for Dubas. My guess is that Guentzel gets a new deal. If the object is to win in the short term, signing him makes sense. — Yohe\n\nWill Carter be more effective in a lesser role?\n\nCarter is on the decline, you might have heard.\n\nI realize what the numbers say, and I’m hardly defending how he played last season. But I don’t blame Carter for what happened. The coaching staff used him far, far too often in important situations. It wasn’t fair to him or the team. But last season’s roster was so bad that Sullivan had only so many options.\n\nHe has more choices this season. Can Carter, the fourth-line right winger, be reasonably effective? — Yohe\n\nWill Dubas do a good Rutherford impersonation?\n\nDubas was extremely aggressive all summer. He also looks up to Jim Rutherford quite a bit, for what it’s worth. I wouldn’t be shocked to see him make several moves throughout the season. The Penguins could use another sound defenseman for the third pairing, and though the bottom six is better than it was, it’s not Stanley Cup-caliber. I’d expect Dubas to keep us checking our phones all season. — Yohe\n\nHow does it end?\n\nI’d be surprised if the Penguins didn’t make the playoffs. They have another star in Karlsson, their bottom six is better, their top four is better, their goaltender is healthy and they have a considerably better general manager. That’s a lot of positives.\n\nThe real question is do they have another Stanley Cup run in them? Anything is possible, but the daunting Eastern Conference will make such a run difficult to accomplish. Are the Penguins better than the New Jersey Devils or Carolina Hurricanes? I don’t think we can objectively say that. Maybe Dubas will make them better between now and then.\n\nThey’ll be a playoff team, though. And they’ll be more fun to watch than they have been in years. So, enjoy the ride, and let’s see if the big guys can push the sun back into the sky for another year. — Yohe\n\n(Top photo: Timothy T. Ludwig / USA Today)"
