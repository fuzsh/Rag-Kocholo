        "text": "HANOVER, N.H. - For the second straight season, seven former Dartmouth players suited up for National Hockey League action. Despite the work stoppage, the NHL got underway in January with five Big Green players on opening-night rosters, the most among all Ivy League and ECAC Hockey teams.\n\nT.J. Galiardi '10 - San Jose Sharks\n\nPlayed in 36 regular season games for the Sharks, registering 14 points on five goals and nine assists. Played his 200th career NHL game on March 10 at Colorado. Had a goal and an assist in the final game of the season on April 27 at Los Angeles. Scored his first goal of the season on Feb. 26 vs. Colorado.\n\nTanner Glass '07 - Pittsburgh Penguins\n\nPlayed in all 48 games in his first season in Pittsburgh, helping the Penguins to the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference. Scored one goal during the regular season and had two points while leading the Pens in hits (125) and PIMs (62). Picked up his first career Stanley Cup Playoffs goal against the Islanders in Game 1 of the first-round series. Went over 300-career NHL games in the shortened 2013 campaign.\n\nNick Johnson '08 - Phoenix Coyotes\n\nAfter signing with the Coyotes in the offseason, Johnson suited up for 17 games with the big club around stints with the Portland Pirates of the American Hockey League (AHL) and the Idaho Steelheads of the ECHL. Registered four goals and two helpers for six assists in his NHL stints, including a two-point night (1g/1a) against Nashville at home on Jan. 28.\n\nDavid Jones '08 - Colorado Avalanche\n\nRe-upping with Colorado for four years last summer, Jones will be a part of the young Avalanche core for the immediate future. Missed some time due to injury, but did appear in 33 games, registering nine points on three goals and six assists. Scored his sixth career regular-season overtime goal on Feb. 20 vs. St. Louis, moving into third all-time in franchise history behind only Milan Hejduk (9) and first-ballot Hall of Famer Joe Sakic (7). All six of those OT winners have come since Jan. 1, 2011, the highest total of any NHL player during that time span.\n\nBen Lovejoy '06 - Pittsburgh Penguins / Anaheim Ducks\n\nTraded from Pittsburgh to Anaheim on Feb. 6, Lovejoy suited up for 32 games with the Ducks after the move. Registered 10 assists in the regular season with Anaheim after going scoreless in three games with the Pens prior to the trade. Helped the Ducks to the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference. Despite a seven-game series loss to the Detroit Red Wings in the first round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs, Lovejoy had a solid series. He helped set up future Hall of Famer Teemu Selanne with a one-timer while on the power play late in the third period of Game 1, while eluding two defenders in the offensive end to set up Nick Bonino with the game-winner in overtime of Game 5.\n\nLee Stempniak '05 - Calgary Flames\n\nBecame Dartmouth's all-time leader in NHL games played as he suited up for his 553rd contest on April 5 at San Jose. Having played in 47 games his second full season with the Flames, Stempniak is an eight-year veteran who has dressed for a Big Green record 564 career contests en route to passing Carey Wilson '83 as the program leader. He began the year by scoring Calgary's first goal on Jan. 20, one of his nine tallies on the season. He would also add 23 assists for 32 points in the work-stoppage shortened season, leading the league with three shorthanded helpers as well.\n\nJ.T. Wyman '08 - Tampa Bay Lightning\n\nWas recalled by the Lightning for one game during the season, an April 14 contest at Buffalo. Wyman played in 76 games for the Syracuse Crunch of the AHL, Tampa's top minor-league affiliate, during the regular season. In those games with Syracuse, Wyman posted 13 goals and 25 assists for 38 points, good for sixth on the team in scoring. He would play in all 18 postseason games as the Crunch made it all the way to Game 6 of the Calder Cup Finals against Grand Rapids. During the run to the final round, Wyman scored three times and added four assists."
