        "text": "Defensemen Back From Brief NHL Call Up\n\nCEDAR PARK, TX – The Texas Stars, proud American Hockey League affiliate of the Dallas Stars, announced today that Dallas has returned defensemen Carl Sneep to Texas after activating defensemen Trevor Daley from injured reserve.\n\nSneep, 25, returns to Texas after being recalled by Dallas on Sunday. The Brainerd, Minnesota native has split time this season between the AHL's Stars, the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins (AHL) and the ECHL's Wheeling Nailers. In 13 games with Texas, he has 3 points (1 goal, 2 assists), six penalty minutes, and a plus-5 rating. He skated in his only NHL game on Dec. 17, 2011 against the Buffalo Sabres where he earned an assist and plus-1 rating in the contest. The 6-foot-3, 220-pound blueliner was Pittsburgh's second-round selection (32nd overall) in 2002. He was acquired by Dallas in exchange for a conditional seventh-round pick in this year's draft on Jan. 24, 2013.\n\nThe Dallas Stars take on the Nashville Predators tonight at Bridgestone Arena at 7:00 pm CT (TV: NBC Sports Network; Radio: 1310 The Ticket).\n\nThe Texas Stars will complete their eight-day, four-game road trip on Tuesday, February 26th against the Oklahoma City Barons at 7:00 p.m. at Cox Convention Center. The Stars’ next home game is on Friday, March 1st at 7:30 p.m. against the Chicago Wolves for another Texas Lottery Lucky Row Night and a $3 Beer Night.
