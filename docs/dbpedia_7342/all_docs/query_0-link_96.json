        "text": "May 24, 2012\n\n2012 Season Ticket Application Form\n\nLEWISBURG, Pa. -Bucknell University's graduation took place this past Sunday, concluding the 2011-12 academic year. Now, it is time to look ahead to 2012-13. The 2012 Bucknell football season kickoff is just 107 days away and on Thursday Bucknell head football coach Joe Susan announced the Bison's 27-man recruiting class that will be freshmen this fall. The group features players from 10 states, including 10 incoming student-athletes from New Jersey and eight from Pennsylvania.\n\nOf the 27 incoming players, 19 are projected to play on the offensive side of the ball, while eight are expected to join the defensive unit.\n\n\"The young men who we recruited in this class give us a chance to continue to build our program,\" said Susan, who led the Bison to a record-tying five-win turnaround this past year. \"We are fortunate that we were able to satisfy many of our position needs. This class represents a group of young men who are student-athletes. They will benefit from their experience at Bucknell. They will also benefit Bucknell by their presence on our campus. We are excited about this group and are looking forward to them coming into our program.\"\n\nBucknell posted a 6-5 record last fall, registering its first above-.500 finish since 2006. The Bison will return 13 regular starters (six offense, seven defense) in 2012. Bucknell's first game this coming fall is Sept. 8 at Marist. The Bison will be home for the first time when they host Lafayette Sept. 22 in a Family Weekend game that will be televised live on CBS Sports Network at noon.\n\nName Pos. Ht. Wt.
