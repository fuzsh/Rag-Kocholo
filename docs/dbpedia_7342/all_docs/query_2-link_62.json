        "text": "Since tonight kicks off Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Finals, I thought it would be fun to do a very quick and dirty cluster analysis of the league based on regular season performance.\n\nTonight, the Chicago Blackhawks square off against my hometown team, the Boston Bruins. Even though it was a lockout-shortened season, the Blackhawks started off by playing 24 consecutive games without a loss. Given this incredible start, I was eager to see how statistically similar the Bruins were relative to their opponent and other teams they faced in the playoffs.\n\nThe process is as follows:\n\nCrawl the 2012-13 regular season data for each team\n\nNormalize the statistics and create a distance matrix\n\nUse hierarchical clustering to group the teams\n\nOf course, all of this will be completed in my language of choice, R.\n\nThe image above shows 3 dendrograms using 3 different methods.\n\nI will let you draw your own conclusions, but I find it interesting that:\n\nChicago and Pittsburgh (the team Boston defeated to go the Stanley Cup) are basically isolated in 2 of the trees\n\nUsing Average linkage, Chicago/Pittsburgh stand alone from the pack, but so does Boston from the group of other playoff teams\n\nBy and large, the techniques were able to isolate the majority of teams that did not make the playoffs\n\nJust in case you are trying to learn R, here is the code."
