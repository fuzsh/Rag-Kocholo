        "text": "A blockbuster NHL trade Friday between the Pittsburgh Penguins and Carolina Hurricanes ended up affecting Portland Winterhawks defenseman Derrick Pouliot.\n\nThe Penguins\n\nto Carolina and received center Brandon Sutter, defenseman Brian Dumoulin and the eighth overall pick in the NHL Entry Draft, which the Penguins used to take Pouliot –-\n\nat the Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh.\n\nPouliot became the second Portland defenseman in two years to be selected in the first round by the Penguins, who used the 23rd pick last year to land Joe Morrow.\n\n\"I'm extremely excited,\" Pouliot told reporters. \"I couldn't be happier to come to Pittsburgh. Colorado was probably my favorite team growing up, but it's definitely Pittsburgh now.\"\n\nThe draft continues Saturday with the final six rounds, beginning at 7 a.m.\n\nAfter the Edmonton Oilers selected right wing Nail Yakupov of the Ontario Hockey League’s Sarnia Sting with the first overall pick, six of the next seven picks were all defensemen.\n\nThe Western Hockey League was well represented among those picks with Everett’s Ryan Murray going second to Columbus, Edmonton’s Griffin Reinhart fourth to the New York Islanders, Moose Jaw’s Morgan Rielly fifth to Toronto, and Red Deer’s Mathew Dumba seventh to Minnesota before Pouliot went to the Penguins.\n\n“It was special here,” Portland general manager and head coach Mike Johnston said by phone from Pittsburgh. “When the Penguins' pick was announced, the whole building erupted. And it’s pretty neat for a player like Derrick to get drafted at No. 8 when he was projected to go around No. 13, 14 or 15, and also go to the home team.”\n\nPouliot, from Weyburn, Saskatchewan, has developed a reputation as a fleet-footed, offensive-minded defenseman who is strong with the puck and can quarterback the power play. He’s also considered a bit undersized at 5-foot-11 and 192 pounds, and is likely to need more seasoning at the major-junior level before making the jump to the pro ranks.\n\n“The Penguins got two very different defensemen in Joe Morrow and Derrick Pouliot,” Johnston said. “Joe is all about power with his shot and his skating and physical play, and Derrick is about controlling the puck and controlling the tempo of the game.”\n\nPouliot became the 26th player in Portland history to be taken in the first round and the fourth in the last three years to be chosen among the top 13 picks, joining Ryan Johansen (fourth, Columbus, 2010), Nino Niederreiter (fifth, New York Islanders, 2010), and Sven Bartschi (13th, Calgary, 2011).\n\nWinterhawks defenseman Troy Rutkowski was among the first to chime in on Twitter, writing: \"Congrats to @dpouliot51 on getting picked by the Pens, joining @JMorrow7. Pretty good first-round picks if you ask me #ppstars.\"\n\nPouliot and Morrow will go to training camp in September with the Penguins, who probably will reassign Pouliot to Portland for the 2012-13 season, while Morrow is expected to either stick in the NHL or get assigned to Pittsburgh’s AHL affiliate, the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins.\n\nJohnston said he met with Penguins coach Dan Bylsma Thursday, but at that time didn’t know that Pittsburgh had a strong interest in drafting Pouliot.\n\n“Primarily, Dan was asking me about Joe, but at the end of the conversation he asked a couple questions about Derrick,” Johnston said. “I compared Joe and Derrick and talked about what Joe needed to work on and how good he was going to be for them. I didn’t even think that they were going to trade up or try to get Derrick, but that’s probably why he was asking those questions.”\n\nJohnston had suggested that Pouliot could end up paired with 17-year-old rookie Seth Jones to form one of the WHL’s most formidable defensive tandems.\n\n-- Jim Beseda"
