        "text": "Last time I did this I was looking at which front office people were still with the Pittsburgh Penguins organization after Ray Shero was fired and who was brought in specifically by Jim Rutherford. I wanted to look at it in more detail, what the team looked like before Craig Patrick left in 2006, what changes Shero made over the years, and what has happened since Rutherford took over in 2014.\n\nI’m looking at the GM’s immediate subordinates, the Assistants and Associates who helped run the team and were in charge of the AHL club and overall player development (as well as having a hand in scouting, particularly in regards to the Draft). I’m also looking at the various staff responsible for coaching player development at various levels, and the hierarchy of the scouting staff.\n\nI’m not trying to get too much into specifics like I did with the last one, it is really hard to find out what regions a scout is assigned to, especially ones from so many years ago who are no longer with the team. There is also a lot of overlap, some of the upper management help scout too, and even the professional scouts can sometimes be called upon to watch a few amateur games that happen in their area. Not to mention some travel to other areas in order to get more than one pair of eyes on a player, especially when it comes to the big international tournaments. So instead we are looking at the broad picture this time.\n\nGeneral Managers\n\nThe GM has had one or more Assistants who help with various tasks in the daily running of the team. The primary Assistant GM was tasked with being GM of the AHL affiliate Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins as well as being in charge of both the scouting and development staffs and managing personnel. Any additional members of the staff have their own specified roles, although everybody has a little overlap as they assist in all aspects of team management.\n\nBack in 2005-06 Patrick had just one Assistant GM, Eddie Johnston.\n\nWhen Shero took over in 2006-07 he too had just one Assistant GM, Chuck Fletcher, however the team did retain Johnston as a Senior Advisor, although what his exact role with the team was is uncertain, he may have just been kept on as a Friend-of-Mario.\n\nIn 2007-08 Shero brought in two new upper management staff. Jason Botterill was named Director of Hockey Operations and helped with all aspects of player management (scouting, development, and contracts). Tom Fitzgerald was named Director of Player Development and helped with managing the team’s prospects. The 4 of them remained in these roles until after the 2008-09 season.\n\nFollowing the Stanley Cup win Fletcher left for Minnesota and Johnston retired, thus for the 2009-10 season Botterill was promoted to Assistant GM (and GM of WBS) while Fitzgerald was given the title Assistant to the GM. They still maintained the same roles that they had previously and remained as such until Shero was fired after the 2013-14 season.\n\nWhen Rutherford took over in 2014-15 he promoted Botterill to Associate GM and Fitzgerald to Assistant GM, again with the same general roles that they had since joining the team. He also added a third Assistant when he promoted Bill Guerin, who was utilized as a liaison between players and management. Fitzgerald left for New Jersey for the 2015-16 season and they went back to having two Assistants.\n\nPlayer Development\n\nWhen Patrick was in charge in 2005-06 there was no specific player development staff, all they had was Johnston who ran the AHL team and a scout Giles Meloche who occasionally also worked with the team’s goaltenders.\n\nWhen Shero took over in 2006-07 he still just relied on Fletcher running the AHL team for development, but he did assign Meloche as a full-time Goaltending Coach. From 2007-08 through 2010-11 the development staff was just the Assistants Botterill and Fitzgerald (and Fletcher before he left).\n\nIn 2011-12 Shero added a full-time development staff. Guerin was hired as Player Development Coach and Mike Bales as Goaltender Development Coach who worked with Botterill and Fitzgerald in developing the team’s prospects. Guerin was Player Development Coach until Shero was fired after 2013-14, while Bales was promoted to replace Meloche as Goaltender Coach during the 2013-14 season. Shero brought in Mike Buckley to replace him as Goaltender Development Coach.\n\nWhen Rutherford took over in 2014-15 and promoted Guerin he hired Mark Recchi as the new Player Development Coach. He also added a fourth coach to the development staff in 2015-16 as Sergei Gonchar was brought in as a Defensemen Development Coach.\n\nScouting\n\nThe structure and role of the scouting staff is rather complicated. For instance the Assistant GMs also assist in scouting when they are in an area with games to be covered, and Botterill is ostensibly in charge of the entire unit. Each scout has a specific region they are assigned to, but there is overlap so that more than one set of eyes can cover any individual target, and at times professional scouts will also view amateur players in their area and vice versa. The European scouts watch both amateur prospects and older free agent options, while having to travel extensively since there are only so many of them trying to cover an entire continent. Plus for the big tournament type events they have all sorts of different scouts come together to watch.\n\nDepartment Heads\n\nWhen Patrick was in charge in 2005-06 they had Greg Malone as Head Scout, although in reading about his role he was primarily in charge of amateur scouting as when he left he cited wanting to branch out into professional scouting as one reason for leaving the team. 1 European scout, and 7 amateur scouts.\n\nWhen Shero took over in 2006-07 he hired Jay Heinbuck as Director of Amateur Scouting. The following year in 2007-08 he promoted Dan MacKinnon to Director of Professional Scouting, with the two of them serving together as heads of the scouting staff through the end of the 2008-09 season. In 2009-10 MacKinnon was promoted to Director of Player Personnel, ostensibly the head of the entire scouting staff, although his role was still listed as primarily dealing with professional scouts. For 2010-11 Shero promoted Derek Clancey to Director of Professional Scouting and brought in Randy Sexton as Assistant Director of Amateur Scouting with the 4 of them in charge of scouting through the end of the 2011-12 season. In 2012-13 he then promoted Patrik Allvin to Head European Scout while in 2013-14 Sexton was promoted so that he and Heinbuck would both be Co-Director of Amateur Scouting, the 5 of them working together through Shero’s final two seasons.\n\nWhen Rutherford took over in 2014-15 he left Shero’s staff in place but he shook things up in 2015-16 by demoting Heinbuck and making Sexton the lone Director of Amateur Scouting. For the 2016-17 season MacKinnon has decided to leave to rejoin Shero in New Jersey, so as of now they no longer have a Director of Player Personnel.\n\nProfessional Scouts\n\nThe scouting staff under Patrick in 2005-06 had 3 professional scouts, with only 1 remaining with the team after he was fired.\n\nWhen Shero took over in 2006-07 he added two new ones to keep it at 3. The following year in 2007-08 when he promoted MacKinnon one left and he brought in somebody new to replace him, so the team was reduced to 2 professional scouts. But the year after in 2008-09 he brought in another to bring it back up to 3 again and they kept this in place through the 2009-10 season. After Clancey was promoted in 2010-11 they once again dropped to 2 professional scouts, but brought in a new one again and were back up to 3 for 2011-12. However the last remaining professional scout from Patrick’s staff left the team after that so for Shero’s final two seasons in 2012-13 and 2013-14 the team had just the 2 professional scouts.\n\nWhen Rutherford took over in 2014-15 he opted to get rid of both of the former professional scouts and switched a former amateur scout over to be the lone man covering professional scouting for the team, so far he has been on his own through the end of the 2015-16 season.\n\nEuropean Scouts\n\nThe scouting staff under Patrick in 2005-06 only had 1 European scout who was let go after he was fired.\n\nWhen Shero took over in 2006-07 he increased the staff to 2 European scouts and kept it at that through the end of the 2011-12 season (although 1 left after 2010-11 and a replacement was brought in for 2011-12). After he promoted Allvin in 2012-13 he was once again down to 1 European scout, but he added a new one and brought in back up to 2 European Scouts in his final season 2013-14.\n\nWhen Rutherford took over in 2014-15 he kept the same European scouts Shero had used, although one left and was replaced for the 2015-16 season.\n\nAmateur Scouts\n\nIn 2005-06 Patrick had 7 amateur scouts working on his staff, 2 of which remained in their same roles after he was fired and 1 who was moved to a new position as full-time Goaltender Coach.\n\nShero’s first season in 2006-07 he had just 6 amateur scouts, but he added one and brought it back up to 7 for the 2007-08 season, with 2 leaving (one being a carry over from Patrick’s staff) and then being replaced to keep it at 7 in 2008-09. In 2009-10 they added another person to bring them up to 8 amateur scouts and used the same staff through the 2010-11 season. For 2011-12 they lose 2 more (one of whom was a Patrick hire) and only brought in 1 new replacement, dropping back down to 7 amateur scouts, while in 2012-13 they replaced 2 more and still remained at 7 amateur scouts. They added a new guy in 2013-14, once again bringing them back up to 8 amateur scouts.\n\nWhen Rutherford took over in 2014-15 he retained Shero’s entire amateur scouting staff, the only change he made was that 1 was shifted to the newly vacated professional scouting role and a new guy was brought in to replace him, thus remaining at 8 amateur scouts. However, in 2015-16 they added yet another new guy as well as demoting Heinbuck, which brought them up to 10 amateur scouts. So far for the 2016-17 season 1 has departed, dropping them back down to 9 amateur scouts, and it is possible they will be back down to 8 if they fill the now vacant Director of Player Personnel role."
