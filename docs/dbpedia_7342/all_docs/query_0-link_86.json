        "text": "Griffz_42\n\nEric Tangradi, in his first season in Grand Rapids, leads the Griffins with 10 goals and is tied for the team lead with 16 points heading into Wednesday's home game.\n\n(Taylor Ballek | Mlive.com)\n\nGRAND RAPIDS, MI - Eric Tangradi has the best stats on the Grand Rapids Griffins, but at age 26 and with his fourth organization in four seasons, the left winger doesn't expect numbers alone to get him back to the NHL.\n\nTangradi's name has been mentioned as a possible call-up to the injury-depleted Detroit Red Wings, and he has the experience with NHL stops each of the past four seasons with three teams. But he also has a different perspective this time around.\n\n\"I just wanted to get out of that hole and get back to who I am as a player and as a person and what I can offer,\" he said. \"I've really focused on the mental aspect, and because of it right now I feel like I'm playing the best hockey of my career.\"\n\nTangradi, on a one-year contact, has a team-high 10 goals, is tied for the lead in points with16, and is third among forwards with a plus-5 rating.\n\nThe Griffins, winners of eight in a row, host Milwaukee at 7 p.m. Wednesday.\n\nAt 6-foot-4, 233-pounds, Tangradi fills a need up front for the Griffins, who were light on big bodies a season ago, and he likes to play fast.\n\n\"My expectations for him were high when he got here and I think to this point he has accomplished them,\" coach Todd Nelson said. \"He complements our forward group very nicely and he just wants to win. He's put himself in a good position, and who knows what's going to happen up top (in Detroit)?\"\n\nTangradi was fast-tracked to the NHL after being a second-round pick in 2007. He made his AHL debut with Wilkes-Barre-Scranton in 2009-10, got into one game with the Pittsburgh Penguins late that season and then got a longer tryout with the Penguins 2010-11 when he had goal and three points in 15 games.\n\nAnother shot in 2011-12 produced two points in 24 games, then five games and zero points into the 2012-13 season got Tangradi traded to Winnipeg. After a six-point season with the Jets in 2013-14, he went through the waiver process, was dealt to Montreal, but spent the majority of last season at Hamilton.\n\n\"I felt like there was a lot of pressure on me in Pittsburgh,\" Tangradi said. \"I was kind of touted as a top prospect and expected to make an impact at 21, 22 years old. Looking back, maybe I was a guy who needed to be groomed in the minors a little longer. Maybe I was forced a little, maybe not.\n\n\"But for whatever reason I was never able to get my confidence there and to be the type of player that I knew I could be and others thought I could be as well.\"\n\nAs he looked at his options for this year, Tangradi wanted someplace stable.\n\n\"It was a tough offseason for free agents like me who are in that 'tweener spot,\" he said. \"But I thought I had come to the point in my career where I needed to look around and find an organization where I thought my game would truly fit. And, if my services were needed in the NHL, that there was a competitive team in the AHL where winning was the first priority over some other organization where it's just developing and nothing else.\"\n\nTangradi, who had never played before in Grand Rapids, signed July 8 and the Pittsburgh resident has fit right in.\n\n\"He has a pretty big personality and new guys who've played (in the NHL) can have a huge impact,\" said center and occasional linemate Andy Miele. \"It usually can go two ways - hurt the team or help the team. Obviously he is helping the team so much now on the ice, but he also has a positive attitude and shares his knowledge with the younger guys.\"\n\nTangradi tries to bring a difference perspective to young players such as Andreas Athanasiou, who is back in Grand Rapids after a successful one-week stint with Detroit in November.\n\n\"Every day when I wake up, I believe I can still play in the NHL,\" he said. \"If I didn't believe it, I'd be in Europe somewhere. But the difference opposed to when you're young is you learn patience. That's where I try to help guys in the locker room, to understand about sticking to the course, that there is a process.\""
