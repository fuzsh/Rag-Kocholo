        "text": "NHL PLAYER, Sean Monahan\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nBorn Oct 12, 1994 -- Brampton, Ontario, Canada\n\nSelected by Calgary Flames round 1 #6 overall 2013 NHL Entry Draft\n\nSean Monahan (born October 12, 1994) is a Canadian professional ice hockey player for the Calgary Flames of the National Hockey League(NHL). He is a first round selection of the Flames, sixth overall, at the 2013 NHL Entry Draft and played junior hockey with the Ottawa 67's of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) where he served as team captain.\n\nHe was selected by the Ottawa 67's in the first round, 16th overall, at the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) Priority Selection draft. Monahan's junior hockey career began with difficulty as he suffered a sprained wrist in his first training camp with the 67's, resulting in a slow start for him in the 2010–11 OHL season. An invitation to play in the 2011 World U-17 Hockey Challenge, in which he was a key performer for the gold medal-winning Team Ontario, allowed Monahan to regain confidence; he completed his first OHL season on the 67's second line and recorded 47 points in 65 games. Monahan played in his second international tournament following the season. He joined the Canadian Under-18 National Team for the 2011 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament and scored a goal in the championship game to help Canada win a fourth consecutive gold medal at the event.\n\nPlaying alongside NHL prospects Tyler Toffoli, Shane Prince and Cody Ceci, Monahan was one of the OHL's top scorers in the 2011–12. He finished tied for 15th in league scoring with 78 points. He was named to the OHL's Second All-Star team and was the 67's representative on the league's All-Scholastic team. Monahan's third season in Ottawa was a transitional one for the franchise. The 67's had won three consecutive East Division titles between 2010 and 2012, but the graduation of top players caused the team to enter a rebuilding phase. The 67's finished in last place in the 2012–13 OHL season with just 16 wins. Monahan served as the team's captain, sharing the role with Ceci in the first half of the season until the latter player's departure in a trade. He finished the season with 31 goals and 78 points.\n\nMonahan was one of the top-ranked prospects for the 2013 NHL Entry Draft: The NHL Central Scouting Bureau ranked him as the 5th best North American skater in its final ranking while International Scouting Services ranked him 9th overall. Among OHL draft prospects, the league's coaches rated Monahan highly for his intelligence on the ice, playmaking and stickhandling, and for his faceoff ability. He was selected in the first round, sixth overall, by the Calgary Flames. Upon his selection, the 18-year-old centre expressed his confidence that he was ready to immediately play in the NHL. He earned a spot on the Flames roster to begin the 2013–14 season and made his NHL debut on October 3, 2013, against the Washington Capitals. Monahan scored his first career point in the game, assisting on David Jones' goal in a 5–4 shootout loss. He then scored his first goal the following night against goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky of the Columbus Blue Jackets in a 4–3 win.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nNEWS"
