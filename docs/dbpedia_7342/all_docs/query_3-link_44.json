        "text": "The Philadelphia Flyers are widely recognized as having one of best, if not the best, fans in all of hockey. That’s not hard to believe, particularly when you hear or read the passion and loyalty that Flyers fans exude on blogs, message boards, and talk-radio.\n\nHowever, is Pittsburgh actually a better hockey town than the home of our beloved Broad Street Bullies? That’s what some Pittsburgh friends of mine recently boasted. If so, that would hurt. We know Philly is a better baseball town. And, if Pittsburgh is a better football town, that’s okay, too given the history of the Steelers franchise. But hockey?\n\nTo begin here are some basic population numbers for the respective metropolitan areas:\n\nCity Metropolitan Area Population PHILADELPHIA 5,965,343 PITTSBURGH 2,359,746\n\nPhiladelphia is 253% larger in population than Pittsburgh. Again, this is metropolitan populations, not city limits, so the entire Delaware Valley is included. Keep these numbers in mind as we compare the two cities hockey attendance, TV ratings, jersey sales, Twitter and Facebook activity.\n\nATTENDANCE:\n\nLet’s look at the attendance of the two franchises. The Penguins play in the Consol Energy Center, which has a hockey capacity of 18,647. The Flyers’s Wells Fargo Center has a hockey capacity of 19,750. [both figures according to wikipedia]\n\nDue to the capacity limits, we know that the Flyers should have a higher attendance for hockey, which they do according to ESPN.com. However, as you can see in the table below, the Penguins average capacity per game is slightly higher than that of the Flyers, 101.4% to 101.1%\n\n2012-13 Attendance Home RK TEAM GMS TOTAL AVG PCT 1 Chicago 12 258,912 21,576 109.4 2 Toronto 11 213,027 19,366 102.9 3 Minnesota 11 203,743 18,522 102.5 4 Buffalo 11 208,611 18,964 101.5 5 Pittsburgh 10 186,471 18,647 101.4 6 Philadelphia 11 217,250 19,750 101.1 7 Vancouver 12 227,820 18,985 100.5\n\nTake that stat for what it’s worth. Perhaps a greater indicator would be television ratings.\n\nNHL SEASON OPENER TELEVISION RATINGS:\n\nThe most accessible ratings available are for the NHL 2013 Season Opener. Here are the overnight ratings for the NBC 2013 NHL Regular Season debut:\n\nTOP FIVE MARKETS (Rating/Share)"
