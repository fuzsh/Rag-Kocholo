        "text": "PITTSBURGH — Nail Yakupov grew up idolizing Pavel Bure. The 18-year-old Yakupov is already one up on the Russian Rocket.\n\nThe Edmonton Oilers selected the dynamic forward with the No. 1 pick in the NHL draft on Friday night, hoping Yakupov is the next piece of a core that includes center Ryan Nugent-Hopkins and winger Taylor Hall, the top picks in the previous two drafts.\n\nBoston had the 24th pick in the first round and selected 18-year-old goaltender Malcolm Subban, the younger brother of Montreal Canadiens defenseman P.K. Subban.\n\nBut the big news of the early first round was Pittsburgh's trade of Jordan Staal to the Carolina Hurricanes.\n\nThe Penguins' third center behind Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin this week turned down a 10-year contract extension and told the team he would like to join his brother Eric in Carolina.\n\nThe Penguins acquired forward Brandon Sutter in the deal. Sutter. Pittsburgh also got top pick and used it pick to select defenseman Derrick Pouliot of Portland in the WHL.\n\nYakupov, 18, will join an Edmonton team that is studded with young stars but was unable to rise above last place, which led to the departure of coach Tom Renney last month.\n\nYakupov is a crowd-pleasing right wing.\n\nPlaying with the Sarnia Sting of the OHL in 2010-11, he was named Canadian junior rookie of the year after scoring 49 goals and 101 points and breaking the club scoring records set by Steven Stamkos.\n\nThe early selections in the draft held to form, starting with the expected pick of Yakupov.\n\nThe Columbus Blue Jackets tried to address their woeful defense by taking Ryan Murray of the Western Hockey League's Everett Silvertips with the second pick.\n\nThe 18-year-old Murray became the youngest player since Paul Kariya in 1993 to play for Team Canada in the World Championships this spring.\n\nBefore the draft began, Boston general manager Peter Chiarelli said that goaltender Tim Thomas agreed to waive his no-movement clause, potentially allowing the Bruins to trade him and save a major salary-cap hit next season.\n\nThomas, who said he plans to take a year off from hockey, is on the books for $5 million for 2012-13, though his actual salary is only $3 million.\n\nThe 38-year-old is entering the final season of a four-year contract he signed after winning the first of his two Vezina Trophies in 2008-09.\n\n\"At the very least he's being cooperative in that sense,\" said Chiarelli of a possible trade.\n\nChiarelli said several teams have contacted him about acquiring Thomas.\n\nChiarelli said he still hasn't gotten a 100-percent statement from Thomas that he will not play next season.\n\n\"It's probably 95 percent,\" said the GM.\n\nThe Boston Herald contributed to this report\n\nBoston had the 24th pick in the first round and selected 18-year-old goaltender Malcolm Subban, a 6-foot-1, 195-pounder who played for Belleville in the Ontario Hockey League. He was the No. 1 ranked North American goalie in the draft, according to Central Scouting. He is the younger brother of Montreal Canadiens defenseman P.K. Subban and played for Team Canada at the 2011 World Junior Championship.\n\nBRUINS' TOP PICK"
