        "text": "NHL PLAYER, Jean-Gabriel Pageau\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nBorn Nov 11, 1992 -- Ottawa, Ontario, Canada\n\nSelected by Ottawa Senators round 4 #96 overall 2011 NHL Entry Draft\n\nJean-Gabriel \"J-G\" Pageau (born November 11, 1992) is a Canadian professional ice hockey player currently playing for the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was selected by the Senators in the fourth round, 96th overall, of the 2011 NHL Entry Draft.\n\nBorn in Ottawa and raised in neighbouring Hull, Quebec (now Gatineau, Quebec), Pageau played junior hockey with the Gatineau Olympiques and Chicoutimi Saguenéens of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL).\n\nSelected by his hometown Ottawa Senators in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft, Pageau began his professional career in 2012–13 with Ottawa's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Binghamton Senators, registering 7 goals and 29 points in 69 games before being called-up to Ottawa on April 10, 2013. Pageau stayed in Ottawa for the remainder of the season, registering two goals and four points in nine regular season games. On May 5, 2013, he scored a hat-trick in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals series as the Senators defeated the Montreal Canadiens 6–1. In so doing, he became just the second Senators player to score a hat-trick in the playoffs, Daniel Alfredsson being the first.\n\nFollowing the season, Pageau was honoured by his hometown; on June 18, 2013, he signed the official guestbook at the start of the Gatineau City Council meeting and received a plaque. Mayor of Gatineau Marc Bureau called him \"a true ambassador for the city\".\n\nIn June 2015, it was announced Pageau signed a two-year, one-way contract with the Senators worth an annual average of $900,000. Pageau would play in all 82 games during the 2015–16 season and achieve career highs in goals (19), assists (24) and points (43), and led the NHL in short-handed goals with seven. Pageau scored four goals in Game 2 of round two of the 2017 playoffs against the New York Rangers, including the game-winner in double overtime.\n\nOn July 17, 2017, the Senators re-signed Pageau to a three-year, $9.3 million contract worth $3.1 million annually, avoiding arbitration.\n\nOn April 12, 2018, Pageau was one of the 18 players to be named to the 2018 IIHF World Championship to represent Canada, where he scored one goal and tallied three assists.\n\nPageau was traded to the New York Islanders at the NHL trade deadline in exchange for a conditional first-round pick and a second-round pick in 2020 and a conditional third-round selection in 2021 on February 24, 2020. He was subsequently signed to a six-year contract extension to remain with the Islanders through 2026.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nNEWS"
