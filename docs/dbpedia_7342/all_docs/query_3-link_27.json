        "text": "Presented by Karen’s Print Rite\n\nBack on November 4th, Joe Pavelski and Craig Smith were in the lineup for the Dallas Stars during a game in Vancouver. The Canucks' skaters that night included Brock Boeser and Mark Friedman. It was a rare situation – perhaps the first – where four Waterloo alumni played in the same NHL game.\n\nNot so long ago, it was a notable occurrence when just two former Hawks played in the same contest. As recently as 2010/11, there were only four Waterloo players who skated at the NHL level during the entire season. In less than three months this year, the number for 2023/24 is already up to 13, accounting for 237 player appearances.\n\nThe Canucks had the best of it on November 4th. They blanked the Stars 2-0. However, Dallas will have another chance next week. Mark your calendar for a potential four-Hawk game on Thursday, December 21st in Dallas.\n\nMeanwhile here's and update on all 13 of this season's NHL alumni:\n\nMikey Anderson – Los Angeles Kings\n\n(Waterloo: 2015/16 – 2016/17)\n\nSteady, reliable defense continues to define Anderson's play in Los Angeles. He has appeared in all 25 Kings games this season, logging at least 20 minutes of ice time in each of the last 12. His 25:12 on ice during last Sunday's 4-1 loss to the New York Rangers was second only to teammate Drew Doughty and just shy of the season-high 26:16 he logged on November 16th against the Florida Panthers. Anderson is +5 over his last 12 games and ranks fifth on the team at +11 for the season. He also has a goal and eight assists.\n\nBrock Boeser – Vancouver Canucks\n\n(Waterloo: 2014/15)\n\nA four-goal game to open the season set the tone for 2023/24. Boeser's latest scoring outburst was a Tuesday night hat trick during a 4-1 victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning. That gives the 26-year-old his sixth multigoal game of the season. It also pushes him up to 21 tallies in 29 games, and that means that Boeser is tied with Auston Matthews for the NHL lead. With four months remaining this season, he has already eclipsed the 18 goals he scored last season. A few more multigoal nights would boost Boeser very close to the career-high 29 goals he scored in 2017/18.\n\nJack Drury – Carolina Hurricanes\n\n(Waterloo: 2016/17 – 2017/18)\n\nThe numbers don't pop out as much as Boeser's, but Drury is already having a career year. In 28 games, he has recorded three goals and six assists; in 2022/23 he produced eight points (two goals, six assists) in 38 appearances. The trends have been particularly positive lately: the 23-year-old has a point in five of his last seven games (two goals, three assists). Tuesday against Ottawa, Drury recorded his first power play point of the season, assisting on a goal by Martin Necas. Drury is +3 this winter and now +9 in 68 career NHL regular season appearances.\n\nMark Friedman – Vancouver Canucks\n\n(Waterloo: 2012/13 – 2013/14)\n\nFriedman has been out of the Vancouver lineup for the last five games. Even so, a trade from Pittsburgh earlier this season has provided vastly more opportunities. The defenseman is only eight games shy of matching his 26 appearances in 2021/22, which represented a career high. Friedman's average ice time has been a little over 12 minutes per contest, including a season-best 17:24 at San Jose on November 2nd. He logged an assist in that game and was +2. That contributes to Friedman's +4 plus/minus figure for the season.\n\nVinnie Hinostroza – Pittsburgh Penguins\n\n(Waterloo: 2010/11 – 2012/13)\n\nThe Penguins have played 18 games since November 4th, and Hinostroza has been in the lineup for 11 of them. He has put at least one shot on net every time he has played and recorded a season-high six shots Tuesday. All those chances came in only nine minutes, 30 seconds as Pittsburgh topped one of Hinostroza's former teams, the Arizona Coyotes. Coincidentally, Hinostroza was a Coyote the last time he had that many shots on one night: it happened in a matchup against the Anaheim Ducks on March 14, 2019. He was credited with eight shots in that game.\n\nJacob MacDonald – San Jose Sharks\n\n(Waterloo: 2009/10 – 2010/11)\n\nFrom November 30th to December 10th, the Sharks played six consecutive road games, going 3-2-1 and breaking out with 26 goals. MacDonald had three of them, all coming within a 72-hour span. Traveling to New Jersey on December 1st, he scored twice; it was the first multigoal game of his career. Visiting the Rangers at Madison Square Garden two days later, MacDonald was rewarded with power play time and capitalized. He now has four goals this season after tallying three while playing parts of four prior NHL seasons.\n\nBrandon Montour – Florida Panthers\n\n(Waterloo: 2013/14 – 2014/15)\n\nAs the result of offseason shoulder surgery, Montour's season debut was delayed until November 17th when the Panthers edged the Ducks 2-1. The 29-year-old played over 24 minutes that night in a sign of what was to follow. Montour has logged at least 21 minutes in every game since, picking up where he left off last season as Florida's leader in average minutes. He continues to seek his first goal of this season but had assists against Ottawa (November 27th) and the Islanders (December 2nd). Montour will see former Waterloo teammates Boeser and Friedman in Vancouver Thursday.\n\nTom Novak – Nashville Predators\n\n(Waterloo: 2014/15)\n\nOn December 7th, Novak returned after an 11-game absence. His upper body injury stalled an excellent beginning to 2023/24. Prior to getting hurt, Novak had six goals and six assists during Nashville's first 14 games. Through four games back on the ice, Novak has been held without a point. However, he is approaching a career milestone: the 26-year-old needs just four more games for 100 during his NHL career. He could hit that mark on Thursday, December 21st when the Predators visit Philadelphia.\n\nJoe Pavelski – Dallas Stars\n\n(Waterloo: 2002/03 – 2003/04)\n\nPavelski has not gone longer than back-to-back games without a point for Dallas. A goal on Monday during a 6-3 victory against the Detroit Red Wings gives him 26 points this season (12 goals, 14 assists). He continues to climb among the most successful Americans to ever play at the NHL level. This season, Pavelski has passed Bill Guerin and Brian Rolston, moving up to 10th in games played by a U.S.-born skater (1,277). Among that group, he ranks sixth in goals (461), 14th in assists (566), and ninth in points (1,027), just behind Brian Leetch (1,028) and Doug Weight (1,033).\n\nCal Petersen – Philadelphia Flyers\n\n(Waterloo: 2010/11 – 2013/14)\n\nA combination of injury and illness led Philadelphia to call up Petersen in early November. He played in two games, both against the L.A. Kings who had traded him to the Flyers over the summer. The Kings won Round One on November 4th, but one week later in California, Petersen made a stellar return to the building where he had spent his first five NHL seasons. The 29-year-old stopped 35 of 37 shots during a 4-2 victory. Petersen was reassigned to the Lehigh Valley Phantoms of the American Hockey League after that win.\n\nDylan Samberg – Winnipeg Jets\n\n(Waterloo: 2016/17)\n\nThrough one-third of Winnipeg's schedule, Samberg has perfect attendance. He played in his 100th career NHL game on November 30th, plus all five since then. Samberg has seven assists and a +5 plus/minus differential during his 27 contests in 2023/24. Two of those assists came on November 24th against the Florida Panthers in a 3-0 win. It was the second multipoint game of his career. At the other end of the rink, Samberg's 40 blocked shots place third on the team. The Jets play five more games before Christmas, including tonight in Los Angeles.\n\nZach Sanford – Arizona Coyotes\n\n(Waterloo: 2013/14)\n\nLast night in Pittsburgh, Sanford made his second appearance for the Arizona Coyotes. He was called up on an emergency basis and played 6:21 during a 4-2 road loss. Sanford had played in one earlier game, notching an assist during a 5-4 loss to Los Angeles on October 27th. Arizona returns home for games this weekend against San Jose and Buffalo. If Sanford remains with the Coyotes for those games, he will have the chance to record the 50th regular season goal and 100th point of his career.\n\nCraig Smith – Dallas Stars\n\n(Waterloo: 2006/07-2008-09)\n\nOnly 80 Americans have ever played in at least 900 NHL regular season games. Smith could join that group in late January or early February. The veteran has been on the ice for 25 of 27 Stars games during his first season in Dallas. That has been enough to overtake Jason Blake (871 games) for the second-most ever by a Waterloo Black Hawk. In that regard, only Smith's current teammate Pavelski has more. So far, Smith has two goals and an assist during his first season with the Stars. Dallas hosts Ottawa on Friday.\n\nWhere Are They Now features are presented by Karen's Print Rite, 2515 Falls Avenue in Waterloo."
