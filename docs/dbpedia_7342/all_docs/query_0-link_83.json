        "text": "WHEELING — The Wheeling Nailers are the longest-tenured organization in the ECHL, which at the time of the franchise’s birth was referred to as the East Coast Hockey League.\n\nWith longevity, of course, comes history. And, boy, do the former Thunderbirds turned Nailers have plenty of that. As a way to celebrate the past, the club, with the help of a fan vote and input from local media have selected the Wheeling Nailers All-25th Season Team.\n\nBelow is a capsule look at that squad.\n\nCoaches\n\nDoug Sauter (1992-1995)\n\nEqually as adept at talking horses as much as he is hockey, Sauter was sort of the father of hockey in this community. With a mischievous smile that was often covered up by his signature moustache, Sauter quickly became not only a winner in Wheeling, but a fan favorite.\n\nIn three seasons behind the Thunderbirds bench, the native of Fairlight, Saskatchewan, won 124 games and lost 56, including advancing to the finals in his first year. After leaving Wheeling, Sauter spent the next 14 seasons with the Oklahoma City Blazers of the CHL, winning a pair of championships.\n\nSauter is a member of the Wheeling Hockey Hall of Fame.\n\nClark Donatelli (2011-2016)\n\nA former captain of Team USA in two Olympic Games, Donatelli arrived in Wheeling as an assistant coach. But when head coach Stan Drulia left for a job in the AHL in the middle of the season, Donatelli found himself in charge of the ship.\n\nA native of Providence, R.I., ”Clarkie” took control, leading the Nailers to the playoffs. During his tenure, Donatelli became the franchise’s all-time leader in coaching victories.\n\nHe’s currently the coach of the Pittsburgh Penguins’ AAA affiliate, the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins.\n\nGoaltenders\n\nMike Condon (2013-14)\n\nThe single-season shutout record holder in Wheeling (six), Condon was only here for one season. But what a season it was for the Needham, Mass., native.\n\nCondon posted a 23-12-4 record to go with a 2.18 goals-against average and a save percentage of .931. He also won six playoff games, including two shutouts, and was tough to crack down the stretch with a perfect 8-0 record.\n\nCondon played 55 games last season for the Montreal Canadiens and on Thursday was claimed by the Penguins off waivers.\n\nTomas Vokoun (1995-96)\n\nThe 226th overall pick in Round 9 of the 1994 NHL Entry Draft by Montreal, Vokoun began what would be a long and fruitful hockey career as a Thunderbird. A native of Karlovy Vary, Czech. Rep., Vokoun appeared in 35 games for Wheeling, producing a 20-10-2 record as well as a 3.67 GAA and a .881 SVP, helping lead the team to the playoffs.\n\nLater that year he was called up to Fredericton of the AHL. Vokoun arrived in the NHL in 1998, playing 37 games with Nashville.\n\nVokoun went on to play for Florida, Washington and finally Pittsburgh in the NHL before retiring.\n\nAndy Franck (2005-07)\n\nWhen picking a team such as this, record-holders always come to the front. Franck was a workhorse for the Nailers during his two seasons.\n\nIn recording an overall record of 60-41-9 in Wheeling, Franck appeared in a combined 114 games. He holds the top marks marks in franchise history in most games started in a season (59), most minutes in a season (3,470), most saves in a season (1,736) and most wins in a season (33). In fact, he holds the top two in all of those categories with the exception of most saves, where he ranks first and third.\n\nDefensemen\n\nBrock Woods (1993-96)\n\nWoods loved the area so much that he never left. Brock married his wife, the former Cari Fato, here and they have three children.\n\nOn the ice Woods had a nasty side, as his 639 penalty minutes in three seasons attest. A native of Belleville, ONT, Woods also scored 37 goals and assisted on 85 others for a total of 122 points.\n\nWoods took part in six games in the IHL, split between Houston and Atlanta, before spending the final five games of his career with the Huntington Blizzard.\n\nPaul Bissonnette (2005-2008)\n\nBiznasty as he’s known to his legions of Twitter followers, was quite the character. He once beat up an opposing player and the next time the teams met, Bissonnette entered the ice with a replica WWE championship belt.\n\nBut Paul wasn’t all talk and no action. He was an ECHL All-Star while in Wheeling and literally fought his way to the NHL, where he has played with Pittsburgh and Phoenix.\n\nIn parts of three seasons with the Nailers, Bissonnette racked up 141 penalty minutes to go with 69 points (16g-53a). He is currently playing in the AHL with the Ontario Reign.\n\nDoug Schmidt (1999-2002)\n\nA native of Grosse Ile, Mich., Schmidt spent parts of three productive seasons with the Nailers, beginning in 1999 after coming over from the South Carolina Stingrays.\n\nAn eighth-round draft pick (217th overall) of the Colorado Avalanche in 1997, Schmidt did a little bit of everything — score, hit and defend.\n\nIn 124 games with the franchise, Schmidt scored 15 goals, handed out 49 assists and racked up 393 penalty minutes.\n\nAfter leaving Wheeling as a player, Schmidt spent time in the UHL and AHL. He resides locally.\n\nMathew Maione (2015)\n\nThough he didn’t spend a full year as a Nailer, the diminutive (5-foot-10, 195 pounds) Maione made a big impression. Big, as in being named ECHL Defenseman of the Year.\n\nA midseason acquisition from the Brampton Beast — for a player to be named later, no less — Maione led the league in scoring by defensemen with 54 points (11g-43a). He added another 23 points (6g-17a) in the postseason, helping Wheeling advance to the Kelly Cup Finals.\n\nMaione is in Slovakia, playing for Banska Bystrica HC 05, where he has 15 points (3g-12a) in 11 games.\n\nTim Roberts (1992-96)\n\nMan, could this guy skate.\n\nA native of Boston and an eighth-round selection (153rd overall) by Buffalo in the 1987 NHL Entry Draft, Roberts was a scoring machine. He was more than a point per-game player for the Thunderbirds, which is a rarity for a defenseman at any level.\n\nIn 215 games in a Wheeling uniform, Roberts racked up 230 points by scoring 50 goals and assisting on 180 others.\n\nBut Roberts’ biggest helper came March 29, 2012, when he and the Wheeling Amateur Hockey Association partnered with the Regional Economic Development Partnership to purchase the Nailers and ensure they remained a staple of Wheeling.\n\nTerry Virtue (1992-94, 2005-2006)\n\nHe liked Wheeling so much that he came back for a second go-around and is one of just a handful of players in franchise history to wear both a Thunderbird and a Nailer sweater.\n\nA rough customer in the highest regard, Virtue racked up 2,499 penalty minutes during a 17-year professional career that spanned 16 teams and four leagues.\n\nDuring his 119 games in Wheeling, Virtue scored 15 goals and handed out 77 assists for a total of 92 points, while accumulating 245 penalty minutes.\n\nHe went on to coach in the WHL with Tri-City and the OHL with Owen Sound.\n\nT.J. Reynolds (2002-2005)\n\nThe toughest of the tough, Reynolds was a guy you loved to have on your team and hated to see come to town when playing for the opposition.\n\nHe entered the league like a wrecking ball, amassing 371 penalty minutes in his rookie season with Wheeling.\n\nReynolds followed that up with 247 the next season.\n\nAll told, the Kitchener, ONT, native spent 2,181 minutes of his professional career, which ended in 2012-13, in the penalty box.\n\nPeter Merth (2010-14)\n\nA former team captain, Merth was a classic stay-at-home defenseman for the Nailers.\n\nA graduate of R.P.I. and native of New Westminster, BC, Merth split 2010-2014 between the AHL and the Nailers. His best season in Wheeling occurred in 2011-12, when Merth registered 12 points (3g-9a) in 50 games and was a plus-20.\n\nThe 6-4, 225-pounder who retired following the 2013-14 season, is perhaps best known for the ”Merth Effect” during an 11-game stint with Wilkes-Barre/Scranton in 2011. When he was in the lineup, the AHL Baby Penguins rarely lost.\n\nForwards\n\nZack Torquato (2011-2016)\n\nHe was known as ”The Mayor” of Wheeling, partially because of spending parts of five seasons in Wheeling, but also due to the fact Torquato ingrained himself in the community.\n\nA native of Sault Ste. Marie, ONT, and a former sixth-round (178th overall) pick of the Detroit Red Wings, Torquato is a veteran 355 professional games. During his time in a Nailers uniform, Torquato scored 195 points (66g-129a).\n\nTorquato’s best season here was 2014-15, when he scored 59 points (19g-40a) in 57 games and accumulated 108 PIMs. ‘Torq’ added seven points (4g-3a) in seven playoff games that year.\n\nTorquato is in Europe, playing for Cortina SG.\n\nRiley Brace (2014-16)\n\nA talker of the highest magnitude, Brace has picked up several nicknames along the way.\n\nFrom the ”Woodlawn Warrior,” an homage to his home as well as his gritty style of play, to the ”Big Ticket,” you can call Brace whatever you choose, so long as the reference includes difference-maker.\n\nBrace followed up a regular season that included 67 points (26g-41a) last year by notching 27 points (5g-22a) in 26 playoff games, as the Nailers made it to Game 6 of the finals. His overtime winner to eliminate rival Reading in Game 7 at WesBanco Arena will live forever in Wheeling hockey history.\n\nBrace in Europe playing for the Ravensburg Tower Stars.\n\nDarren Schwartz (1992-94, 98-99)\n\nIf there’s a Wheeling version of ”Mr. Hockey” Schwartz would certainly be it. The numbers he put up while here are staggering.\n\nIt’s one thing to be a scorer or a fighter in the game of hockey. But both? At the same time? The answer is ‘yes’ if your name is Schwartz.\n\nIn 197 games with Wheeling — both as a Thunderbird and then in his final season as a Nailer — Schwartz scored 262 points (143g-119a) while also accumulating 561 penalty minutes.\n\nSchwartz’s best season here was 1992-93, when he scored what is still a franchise-record 62 goals and 114 points overall, while garnering 212 PIMs. Schwartz is a member of the Wheeling Hockey Hall of Fame.\n\nChaz Johnson (2013-2015)\n\nIf one tried to pinpoint a singular person who changed the culture and the way hockey in Wheeling is perceived, it would have to be Johnson. Once the target of fans’ chirps when he came to town with the opposition, Johnson immediately became a favorite here. Not only that, but he made it cool to play in Wheeling for those inside the hockey community.\n\n”The Dark Knight” as he refers to himself, spent the last two seasons of his career in a Nailers uniform and was a success on and off the ice. In 128 games with Wheeling, Johnson scored 31 goals and handed out 32 assists while racking up 268 PIMs. When Johnson was on the ice, the opposition showed a high level of respect for both he and his teammates.\n\nVadim Slivchenko\n\n(1993-95, 99-00, 07-08)\n\nA native of Kharkov, Ukraine, Slivchenko had three separate stints in Wheeling, first with the Thunderbirds and later the Nailers.\n\nAn offensively gifted winger, he blistered the league while here. In 145 games with Wheeling, Slivchenko racked up 187 points (88g-99a).\n\nSlivchenko’s best season — in Wheeling or otherwise — occurred in 1993-94, when he scored 85 points (39g-46a) in 45 games.\n\nSean Collins (2005-2007)\n\nKnown simply around these parts as ”The Captain,” Collins was a fan favorite from the time he stepped foot on WesBanco Arena ice.\n\nHe played 174 games for the Nailers, scoring 208 points (69g-139a) to go along with a plus-28 rating. Collins led Wheeling to the playoffs in 2005-2006, where he accumulated 16 points (seven goals) in nine games.\n\nDuring the 2005-06 and 2006-07 seasons, Collins had identical totals of 27 goals, 49 assists and 76 points.\n\nDevin Edgerton (1992-93)\n\nWhile Edgerton spent just one season here, he lit the league on fire during that time.\n\nIt was during the team’s inaugural year — 1992-93 — when Edgerton became a household name. That season he registered a career-high 117 points (46g-71a), teaming with Schwartz for an unstoppable 1-2 punch.\n\nEdgerton played mostly in Europe during a 16-year professional career that ended in retirement following the 2007-08 season.\n\nTim Tisdale (1992-1996)\n\nA native of Shaunavon, SASK, Tisdale was a 12th-round (250th overall) pick of the Edmonton Oilers in 1988. After successful stints in the WHL and then later with the Cape Breton Oilers of the AHL, Tisdale arrived in Wheeling for the 1992-93 season.\n\nTisdale spent 198 games of his career in a Thunderbirds jersey, piling up 271 points (105g-166a) before retiring after the 1995-96 season. His best year was 1993-94, when Tisdale scored 31 goals and handed out 57 assists for 88 points.\n\nJason Jaffray (2003-2005)\n\nA 35-year-old who is currently playing in Europe, Jaffray was a popular player during his time in Wheeling, which encompassed parts of two seasons.\n\nJaffray, who has 49 games of NHL experience to his credit, scored 86 points (43g-43a) in 77 appearances in a Nailers uniform.\n\nA native of Rimbey, ALTA, Jaffray has spent the majority of his career in the American Hockey League.\n\nAndrew Lord (2008-2011)\n\nAnother fan favorite during pieces of three seasons as a Nailer, ”Lordo” is currently a player-coach for the Cardiff Devils in the United Kingdom, where he has been a member of the organization for four years.\n\nLord, who served as a captain here, was a tough customer who made himself into an all-around player. In 165 games in Wheeling, Lord put up 104 points (42g-62a) to go along with 397 PIMs.\n\nLouis Dumont (1994-96)\n\nA member of the ECHL Hall of Fame, Dumont spent 13 of his 17-year professional career in the league, including two with the Thunderbirds.\n\nAll told, Dumont scored 890 points in the ECHL, including 324 goals.\n\nDuring his stop in Wheeling, Dumont was credited with 121 points (49g-72a) in the regular season, to go along with another five points in nine playoff games.\n\nStefan Brannare\n\n(1997-01, 00-01, 03-06)\n\nA native of Sweeden who stands 5-foot-10 and weighs 190 pounds, Brannare wasn’t afraid to trade punches during his three stays in Wheeling. Actually, it’s four stays since he resides here.\n\nAs a member of the Nailers, Brannare accumulated 667 penalty minutes in 231 games. In addition, he racked up 27 goals and 46 assists for a total of 73 points."
