        "text": "(born 1987). Canadian ice hockey player Sidney Crosby led the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League (NHL) to three Stanley Cup championships (2009, 2016, and 2017). When he was named captain of the Penguins in 2007, he became the youngest captain in the history of the NHL.\n\nSidney Patrick Crosby was born on August 7, 1987, in Cole Harbour, Nova Scotia, Canada. The son of a goaltender drafted by the Montreal Canadiens, he was able to skate by age three. He began playing ice hockey competitively with local youth clubs and quickly developed in the sport. While attending high school in Faribault, Minnesota, he attracted widespread attention by scoring 72 goals and making 90 assists in 57 games during his sophomore year. Rimouski Océanic, a Quebec Major Junior Hockey League team, drafted Crosby in 2003. Over the next two years, he totaled 120 goals and 183 assists in 121 regular-season games. Each year he was named Canada’s top junior player.\n\nIn 2005 the Penguins selected Crosby as the top pick in that year’s NHL draft. By the end of his first season (2005–06), Crosby had become the youngest NHL player to score at least 100 points (goals plus assists) in a single season. During the 2006–07 season he led the NHL with 120 points, becoming the youngest winner of the Art Ross Trophy for highest scorer and the second youngest player (behind Wayne Gretzky) to receive the Hart Trophy for most valuable player. Crosby led the Penguins to the Stanley Cup finals in 2008, though the team lost to the Detroit Red Wings in six games. The following year Crosby once again guided the Penguins to the finals against the Red Wings, and this time the Penguins won the championship in seven games.\n\nCrosby suffered a concussion from an on-ice hit in January 2011. After a prolonged rehabilitation, he rejoined the Penguins’ lineup in November, but he played for just two weeks before he was again sidelined by a recurrence of concussion-like symptoms. He returned to the Penguins in March 2012. Though he missed 12 games of the 2012–13 NHL season because of a broken jaw, he still managed to lead the league that year with 1.56 points per game.\n\nCrosby won his second career Art Ross Trophy for leading the NHL in points (104) during the 2013–14 season. That feat also earned him a second Hart Trophy. He tallied 85 points during the 2015–16 season and led the Penguins to another Stanley Cup championship. He earned the Conn Smythe Trophy as the postseason’s most valuable player. Crosby led the NHL in goals scored (44) during the 2016–17 season, when the Penguins again advanced to the Stanley Cup finals. The Penguins defeated the Nashville Predators in six games. Crosby—who had scored eight goals and made 19 assists over the course of the play-offs—won a second consecutive Conn Smythe Trophy."
