        "text": "While the NHL and the NHLPA are still hammering out details on a new collective bargaining agreement, it's still business as usual for the league as on Thursday morning the national television schedules for the 2012-13 season were released, including those on NBC and NBC Sports Network. (Here are the CBC, RDS, TSN, NHL Network US schedules.)\n\nHere are the NBC highlights:\n\nAre you ready to welcome Pierre McGuire back into your life?\n\nAfter the jump, a team-by-team breakdown of the love shown to them by NBC.\n\nHere are the team-by-team totals for the NBC/NBC Sports Network schedule for the coming season, including NBC Flex Games, in which the NBC game selection for that date will depend upon the game that NBC chooses for its broadcast window. This is all the potential appearances for the teams. In brackets are the total number of appearances last season from the initial schedule.\n\nAnaheim Ducks: 1 (6)\n\nBoston Bruins: 17 (14)\n\nBuffalo Sabres:: 15 (11)\n\nCalgary Flames: Zero (Zero)\n\nCarolina Hurricanes: 1 (4)\n\nChicago Blackhawks: 14 (11)\n\nColorado Avalanche: 6 (9)\n\nColumbus Blue Jackets: 1 (2)\n\nDallas Stars: 8 (7)\n\nDetroit Red Wings: 17 (14)\n\nEdmonton Oilers: Zero (Zero)\n\nFlorida Panthers: 3 (1)\n\nLos Angeles Kings: 9 (6)\n\nMinnesota Wild: 10 (9)\n\nMontreal Canadiens: 5 (6)\n\nNashville Predators: 3 (2)\n\nNew Jersey Devils: 8 (7)\n\nNew York Islanders: 1 (1)\n\nNew York Rangers: 13 (16)\n\nOttawa Senators: Zero (Zero)\n\nPhiladelphia Flyers: 13 (11)\n\nPhoenix Coyotes: 4 (4)\n\nPittsburgh Penguins: 17 (14)\n\nSan Jose Sharks: 7 (5)\n\nSt. Louis Blues: 12 (8)\n\nTampa Bay Lightning: 7 (11)\n\nToronto Maple Leafs: 4 (2)\n\nVancouver Canucks: Zero (2)\n\nWashington Capitals: 12 (14)\n\nWinnipeg Jets: Zero (1)\n\nHere is the 2012-13 NBC schedule:\n\nHere are the total number of appearances for each NHL team on the NBC Sports Groups networks, including exclusive broadcasts:\n\nSome winners and some losers ...\n\nWinner: Los Angeles Kings. They've gone from having 1, 5, 6 and now 9, respectively, nationally televised games over the last four seasons. My, what a wonder the Stanley Cup does, huh? The Kings will also host two games at Staples Center on NBCSN, up from zero games total broadcast from the state of California a year ago between them, the Anaheim Ducks and San Jose Sharks.\n\nLoser: Steven Stamkos. The Tampa Bay Lightning see a drop in games that will feature the reigning Rocket Richard Trophy winner. The 1-3-1 doesn't sell, Guy Boucher.\n\nWinner: Minnesota's richest hockey players. The additions of Zach Parise and Ryan Suter will get plenty of American-focused coverage on the network and despite four straight seasons without making the playoffs, the Wild will see double-digit games.\n\nLoser: Canadian fans living in the U.S. who don't root for the Toronto Maple Leafs or Montreal Canadiens. Sorry, Flames, Oilers, Canucks, Senators and Jets fans. You're shut out this year.\n\nWinner: More hockey. Hockey Day in America in February is now a triple-header and Sunday through Wednesday nights featuring regular puck. The more the better.\n\nLoser: Aggressive Jim Rutherford. The Carolina Hurricanes GM made his mark on the offseason by bringing in Jordan Staal and Alexander Semin. There's buzz around the Canes, but it's only paid off in one national game after four the previous two seasons.\n\nNow, if only there was a definite reason to believe we'll be watching these games starting in a little over a month ...\n\nWhat are your impressions of the 2012-13 NHL schedule on NBC?"
