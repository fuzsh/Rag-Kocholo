There was originally an enemy under the horses foot. It is naturalistic with portrait likeness yet it is idealized. The only reason it survived was because it was later mistaken to be a statue of emperor Constantine who was the first christian ruler so the later Christians let it stay. Title- Arch of Constantine Period- Roman location- Rome date- 312-315 CE additional info- Constantine, the son of one of the four techtrarchs, erected this to commemorate his \"victory\" over becoming emperor rather than his competition, Maxentius. It has three barrel vaults and is much larger than previous triumphal arches. It is made with concrete and in Corinthian order. It is propaganda to boast about Constantine being emperor. Constantine was the first Christian Roman emperor, but for a good bit of his reign before he made Christianity the national religion he allowed for anyone to practice any religion. Some of the reliefs were spolia, or reused material. They were taken from three separate monuments to previous emperors. The upper reliefs are from Marcus Aruleus, The sculptures on top and some other minor reliefs were from Trajan, and the tondi, or circular reliefs, are from Hadran. Title- Tondi Reused on the Arch of Constantine Period- Roman location- Rome date- 130-138 CE additional info- These spolia were from the memorial of Hadran, and are thus stylistically diffrent from the reliefs below as they were created in the greek classical style. The tondi on the left shows Hadran and his officials hunting a boar representing his courage and physical strength. The tondi on the right pictures Apollo atop a column and Hadran and his officials giving offerings to him to represent his dedication and gratitude to the gods. However, The heads of Hadran had been cut off and replaced with carved heads of Constantine to show him with all these virtues and depict him as a successful emperor. The style of the relief below however is more blocky and abstract with less movement and depth. What is a catacomb?
