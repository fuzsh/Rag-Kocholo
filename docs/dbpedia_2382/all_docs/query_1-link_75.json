        "text": "This winged head of a youthful Hermes, made in the 1st century AD, during the period of Roman rule [1], is a copy of a type from the mid 5th century BC, probably after the Diskophoros (disc carrier), Doryphoros (spear carrier) or Herakles of Polykleitos the Elder of Argos. It is therefore often referred to as the \"Hermes Diskophoros\".\n\nSee also a very different representation of Hermes on the previous page.\n\nIn Greek myth Hermes (Greek, á¼ÏÎ¼á¿Ï; also á¼ÏÎ¼ÎµÎ¯Î±Ï, Hermeias; known to the Romans as Mercury), god of dexterity, messenger and guide, was the son of Zeus and the nymph Maia, daughter of Atlas and one of the Pleiades. He was born in a cave on Mount Kyllene (or Cyllene; Greek, ÎÏ Î»Î»Î®Î½Î·), Arcadia, in the Peloponnese. He was the father of Pan and Hermaphroditus.\n\nShortly after his birth he is said to have killed a tortoise and used its shell to make the first lyre. He later gave the lyre to Apollo as compensation for cattle he had stolen from him (see more about Hermes, the tortoise and the lyre on Stageira gallery page 19). He was also credited with inventing language itself.\n\nApart from being inventive, a trickster and a thief, he was a swift messenger and errand boy of the gods, and is often shown with wings on his head, on a cap, petasos (ÏÎ­ÏÎ±ÏÎ¿Ï, a broad-brimmed sun hat) or helmet, or on his ankles or sandals (see illustrations below). His other symbol is the caduceus (Latin; known in Greek as ÎºÎ·ÏÏÎºÎµÎ¹Î¿Î½, kerukeion, herald's staff or wand), a wand entwined with two snakes, and sometimes with wings, which he used to induce sleep and healing.\n\nHe was the second youngest of the Olympian gods, which may account for the fact that the elder deities were always sending him on errands. He is often portrayed as a protector of his younger half-brother Dionysos.\n\nHermes was given several epithets, and there were so many stories about or involving him, and so many statues and herms of him on roads, at markets and gymnasiums, outside houses and other buildings, that it seems obvious that he was a very popular deity for all classes of people. However he was not worshipped or honoured with temples in the same grand style as other gods such as Zeus, Apollo, Athena or Artemis; sanctuaries of Hermes were usually quite modest.\n\nLike many of the Greek gods, he was endowed with numerous skills, attributes and responsibilities as patron of various human professions and activities, including trade, thievery and travel - in this world and the next, as he also guided the dead to the underworld (as Hermes Psychopompos, á¼ÏÎ¼á¿Ï Î¨Ï ÏÎ¿ÏÎ¿Î¼ÏÏÏ, Guide of Souls, see image below). Thus he was associated with death as well as sleep and dreams.\n\nHermes' association with markets and commerce may have developed from his more ancient role as the master of animals, wild and domesticated, a herdsman and tender of horses and mules. According to Hesiod, he also regulated the number of animals owned by farmers; animals and their products were among the most important indicators of wealth and purchasing power, especially before the introduction of coinage.\n\nHis multi-skilled and multi-tasking existence leads one to think that he was a composite or replacement for various earlier pre-Olympian and local deities. His attributes and responsibilities also overlapped with those of other deities, for example Hypnos (á½ÏÎ½Î¿Ï, Sleep) and his brother Thanatos (ÎÎ¬Î½Î±ÏÎ¿Ï, Death) who are also depicted with wings on their heads, as well as Morpheus (ÎÎ¿ÏÏÎµÏÏ) the god of dreams.\n\nThe winged head of Hermes from Pergamon and similar statues portray the god as young, clean-shaven and athletic. However, this head and the smaller version in Izmir (see photo, above right) show him as well-fed, even chubby (puppy fat?), and not quite the lean, mean Olympic machine. Perhaps the Pergamese preferred their god of merchants and shop-keepers to carry a bit of fat as a sign of prosperity.\n\nSee also:\n\nMore photos and infromation about Hermes on\n\nthe Hermes page of the MFP People section.\n\nA relief of Hermes with his caduceus on a column drum from the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, on Selcuk gallery 1, page 2.\n\nReliefs of Hermes on Kuretes Street, at the Ephesus\n\narchaeological site, on Ephesus gallery 1, page 9."
