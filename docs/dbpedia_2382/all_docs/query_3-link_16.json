The god declares that the young man can paint a picture similar to that of the cathedral as it has a pure heart. For the table of an angel, Hypnos comment Alone has not yet put his eyes in color. The young man said he had not found the red he wants. Hypnos tells him to go into the forest to find a true color and not an illusion due to the light.\n\nTwo years later, Alone is taken to the cathedral by Pandora. Hypnos awaits them at the entrance. Alone can finally see the painting of the saint. To his amazement, he sees that he has the same face as him. He also discovered the bodies of his friends Maria, Anna, and Caro. Pandora said they died because Alone paints their portraits made a few days ago. Hypnos tell Alone must not look away. Must look at the picture: the children are happy as they no longer suffer in death. Alone becomes the new receptacle of Hades.\n\nTwo Brother[]\n\nHypnos and Thanatos appear to Pandora at the Cathedral of Hades.

They want to shut Hades in a special workshop to remove the disturbing elements and it focuses on the realization of Lost Canvas.

Veronica fails again, Manigoldo happens to track the god with the trace left by the god cosmos. Manigoldo interrupts chess twins and said he wanted to face the god of death himself!
