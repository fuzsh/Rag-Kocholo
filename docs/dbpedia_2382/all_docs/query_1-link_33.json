        "text": "On Hypnos, Medea and Moros and artificial Persona users.\n\nHypnos:\n\nHypnos/Somnus (sleep) is the God of Sleep and son of Nyx and Erebos and the twin brother of Thanatos. Accroding to Hesiod his mother gave birth to him herself.\n\nHypnos and Thanatos live in the Underworld (Hades) or Erebos. According to a legend Hypnos lives in a cave where day and night meet and which is the origin of the river Lethe (forgetfulness). Herbs which make you fall asleep grow in front of the cave. According to Homer Hypnos lives on the island Lemnos which is an island of dreams. His children/or brothers are Morpheus, Phobetor and Phantasos who are gods of dreams also called the Oneiroi.\n\nHypnos is rather described as a calm and kind hearted God who helps people in need and who has power over the lives of humans since humans do have to sleep a lot.\n\nHypnos is very often drawn asleep and with opium poppies as a wreath or with wings of a bird. He also often carries a horn which is filled with dreams an sleep or he carries a poppy stem or a branch symbolizing the River Lethe. Similar to Thanatos he is also depicted with inverted torches. He is often depicted with his twin and is a motif for graves.\n\nAccording to some stories Hypnos is very often connected to the Endymion myth making Endymion fall deep asleep so that he remains young forever to stay with Selene. He also gave Endymion the power to keep his eyes open so that he can watch Selene.\n\nHera asked Hypnos two times to make Zeus fall asleep: One time while hunting down Heracles, another time when Hera asked Poseidon for help due to the Trojan War.\n\nThe word hypnosis derives from his name and means sleep like condition (hypnos “sleep” + -osis “condition”).\n\nConnection to Takaya:\n\nTakaya’s Nyx cult is kinda hypnosis like. Like Hypnos Takaya lived in darkness and doesn’t fit in with society.\n\nTakaya is also closely conneted to Nyx via myth and Hypnos having a twin with Thanatos in myth is most likely a reference to Takaya being a fake/imitation of a saviour.\n\nMedea:\n\nMedea was the daughter of King Aeëtes of Colchis, a niece of Circe, granddaughter of the sun god Helios, and wife to the hero Jason, the leader of the Argonauts.\n\nMedea is often depicted as an enchantress and a priestess of the goddess Hecate. Very often other people apparently saw her as scary and witch like.\n\nWhen Jason and the Argonauts wanted to retrieve the Golden Fleece, Medea fell in love with him.\n\nHer father Aeëtes promised to give Jason the fleece, but only if he could perform certain tasks. For example, Jason had to plough a field with fire-breathing oxen that he had to yoke himself. Medea is the typical helping maiden in these stories\n\nMedea gave Jason an unguent with which to anoint himself and his weapons, to protect him from the bulls’ fiery breath.\n\nThen, Jason had to sow the teeth of a dragon in the ploughed field and the teeth sprouted into an army of warriors. He was forewarned by Medea, however, and threw a rock into the crowd so that the soldiers attacked and killed each other. Finally, Jason fought and killed the sleepless dragon that guarded the fleece. Medea put the dragon to slepp with narcotic herbs, Jason took the fleece and sailed away with Medea.\n\nMedea distracted her father as they fled by killing her brother Absyrtus who she dismembered (in other versions he is killed by Jason.)\n\nWhen the Argo reached the island of Crete, guarded by the bronze man, Talos Medea drove him mad with drugs or hypnotized him.\n\nJason later saw that his father Aeson was too aged to participate in the celebrations for the fleece. Medea withdrew the blood from Aeson’s body and infused it with certain herbs which made him seem much younger. She slit Aeson’s throat, then put his corpse in a pot and Aeson came to life as a young man. Pelias’ daughters saw this and wanted the same service for their father.\n\nPelias who occupied the throne in Iolcus (it would have rightfully belonged to Jason’s father Aeson) and who sent Jason to retrieve the fleece was hated by Hera who arranged that Medea should fall in love with Jason so that Pelias dies.\n\nMedea thus conspired to have Pelias’ own daughters kill him. She told them she could turn an old ram into a young ram by cutting up the old ram and boiling it in magic herbs and demonstrated it. The girls cut their own father into pieces and threw him into a pot. Jason and Medea thus had to flee to Corinth.\n\nJason and Medea were married for ten years: Their sons were called Alcimenes, Thessalus, Tisander, Mermeros and Pheres and their daughter Eriopis.\n\nKing Creon however offered Jason the hand of his daughter Glauce. Glauce was certainly younger than Medea and Medea wasn’t very popular with the people in Korinth. Jason then said that he will keep the children, but Medea should go. Medea avenged herself by sending Glauce a coronet and a dress drenched in poison. The poison burned Glauce as well as King Creon who tried to save her.\n\nThen Medea to ultimately punish Jason killed her children and rode away in a chariot sent by Helios.\n\nMermeros and Pheres are sometimes killed by her or since they helped her they were murdered by Corinthians. Tisander and Alcimenes were also murdered by her. Thessalus escaped being murdered by his mother and later became king of Iolcus.\n\nIn some versions her children are just killed by Corinthians.\n\nShe fled to Athens and married King Aegeus with whom she had a son. That changed when Theseus the long lost son of Aegeus appeared. Medea wanted to convince Aegeus that Theseus is a threat and she handed Theseus a cup of poison, Aegeus however recognized Theseus and knocked the cup from Medea’s hand and accepted him as his son.\n\nMedea returned to her home, Colchis. Her father Aeëtes had been deposed by his brother Perses which led to Medea kililng her uncle, and restoring the kingdom to her father. Other versions say that Medea had to flee to Asia (Iran).\n\nConnection to Chidori:\n\nBoth Chidori and Medea can be violent when dealing with problems. Medea killed her children and Chidori cuts herself thus both kinda hurt themselves. Chidori’s gothic lolita outfit is probably a reference to Medea being seen as strange and a witch. Similar to Medea Chidori does have magical powers as you can see when she revives a plant and sacrifices herself for Junpei.\n\nMedea also betrays people quite often which is why Chidori switches sides at the end.\n\nI am also sure that Medea’s ram like appearance is a reference to the Golden Fleece which was the fleece of the gold-hair winged ram, which was held in Colchis.\n\nMoros:\n\nMoros (destiny, doom) is the god of doom and the spirit of depression. He is a son of Nyx and is a brother of Thanatos, and Hypnos.\n\nConnection to Jin: Just like Takaya, Jin is connected to Nyx via myths. I guess his Persona represent that Takaya encouraged him despite Jin being the rational one. He is essentially Takaya’s side kick and just waits for the impending doom with the result of him dying young.\n\nArtificial Persona Users:\n\nArtificial Persona Users are people who are forced to develope a Persona. It is not natural thus it’s never used to overcome your Shadow and get along with society like a Persona actually works.\n\nThe Persona user might be taken over by a demon or end up as a Shadow.\n\nIt was already mentioned in Eternal Punishment since you find a document written by Takahisa Kandori how to artificially create Persona-users.\n\nIn Tatsuya’s scenario Shiori Miyashiro was turned into a Joker and the New World Order experimented on her which led to the demon Wendigo taking over her body.\n\nThe Kirijo Group used Kandori’s idea to create their own artificial Persona-users. Thus people like Takaya, Chidori and Jin must take suppressants/drugs so that their Persona doesn’t kill them however they still suffer due to side effects."
