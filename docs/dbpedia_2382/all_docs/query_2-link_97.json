Crafted from bronze and standing at a height of 21 cm, this masterpiece is housed in the prestigious British Museum in London, UK. The Head of Hypnos represents an auxiliary deity associated with Hades, known as the god of sleep. In this depiction, he takes on the form of a winged youth who uses his wings to gently fan those who are weary into slumber. This sculpture beautifully captures both the ethereal nature and tranquility that sleep embodies. Discovered in Civitella d'Arno, Italy, this artifact holds immense historical significance as it provides insight into ancient Greek mythology and Roman artistry. The intricate details and craftsmanship evident in every curve and contour make it an exquisite example of sculpting during its time. As we gaze upon this image captured by Bridgeman Images, we are transported back to an era where gods were worshipped and mythological tales held great power over human imagination. It serves as a reminder that even centuries later, these timeless works continue to captivate our hearts and minds with their enduring beauty.\n\nRate this comment thumb_up thumb_down\n\nMADE IN AUSTRALIA\n\nSafe Shipping with 30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nFREE PERSONALISATION*\n\nWe are proud to offer a range of customisation features including Personalised Captions, Color Filters and Picture Zoom Tools\n\nSECURE PAYMENTS\n\nWe happily accept a wide range of payment options so you can pay for the things you need in the way that is most convenient for you\n\n* Options may vary by product and licensing agreement.
