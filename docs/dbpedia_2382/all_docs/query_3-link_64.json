        "text": "In the fascinating realm of Greek mythology, not all gods possessed the same human-like qualities as the Olympian gods. Instead, many served as personifications of specific fundamental forces and ideas. Hypnos was one of the children of the primordial gods and was regarded as the personification of sleep. The Greek god Hypnos not only represented specific aspects of human existence, such as sleep, but also of oblivion. Let’s find out more about Hypnos’ facts, Hypnos’ symbols, and the myths associated with him, such as the story of Hypnos and Thanatos.\n\nThe Mythology of the Greek God Hypnos\n\nNameHypnosGenderMaleSymbolsPoppy, Cottonwood, and River LethePersonalityCalm and gentleDomainsSleep and oblivionParentsNyx or Astraea and ErebusSpouseCharis Pasithea\n\nAccording to Hesiod’s poem the Theogony, the Greek god of sleep was one of the many offspring of Nyx, who was a primordial goddess who represented the night. She was a terrifying and formidable goddess. There are a few different accounts concerning the origins of Hypnos. According to certain versions of the tale, he was Nyx’s fatherless son.\n\nNight and Sleep by Evelyn de Morgan (1878); Evelyn De Morgan, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nAccording to some accounts, he was the son of Erebus and Nyx. Erebus was the personification of absolute darkness. Based on certain accounts by Seneca, though, Hypnos was believed to be the son of the enigmatic deity Astraea.\n\nAccording to one legend told by the Roman grammarian Fronto, the god of Sleep known as Somnus in Rome had been created by Jupiter and had no true parents. Regardless of his lineage, most versions of the myth maintain that the Greek god Hypnos had a twin brother, Thanatos, the personification of death. The majority of scholars believe that Hypnos and Thanatos resided in the Underworld. More precisely, legend has it that he resided in the Erebus Valley, in a damp cave near the River Lethe.\n\nLethe was one of the underworld’s five rivers in Greek mythology, and its waters induced oblivion and memory loss.\n\nDante and the River of Lethe by Gustavore Dore (1880); Gustave Dore, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nThere was an ebony bed in Hypnos’ cave. Poppies and other sleep-inducing vegetation flourished at the entrance. No noise or light could enter the cave, enabling Hypnos to fall asleep. His residence was appropriate for his responsibilities, establishing his purpose and function within Greek mythology. Homer, an ancient Greek poet, provides another account of Hypnos’ living arrangement. Hypnos was believed to reside on the Aegean island of Lemnos in Homer’s Iliad. His island was very dreamlike and helped sustain his children’s lives.\n\nIris Delivering a Message to the Kingdom of Hypnos by Giulio Carpioni (between c. 1655 and 1660); Giulio Carpioni, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe Children of the Greek God Hypnos\n\nHypnos, like many of the Greek gods, had offspring who helped him achieve his aims. Hypnos married Pasithea, one of the Greek Charities, who were also known as the Graces. Pasithea embodied meditation, relaxation, and hallucination, which made for an ideal partnership with Hypnos. In certain versions of the Hypnos tale, the two gods had several sons. They were referred to as the Oneiroi. These sons, according to Greek mythology, were the bringers of dreams.\n\nHypnos would put mankind to sleep, while the Oneiroi would bring a range of dreams.\n\nThe Kingdom of Hypnos by Giulio Carpioni (between 1660 and 1665); Giulio Carpioni, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nMorpheus, Phantasus, and Icelus were among the best known sons of Hypnos. Morpheus was responsible for dreams regarding humans, whereas Phantasus and Icelus delivered dreams about inanimate things and animals. One son was also the source of nightmares. He was known as Phobetor in Ovid’s Metamorphoses. However, whether or not the Oneiroi were Hypnos’ sons is debatable, depending on which version of the tale you read. The Oneiroi are Nyx’s sons and Hypnos’ siblings in the Theogony.\n\nThe Role of Hypnos\n\nHe was in charge of putting all living things to sleep, both human and immortal. As a result, he was considered as an exceptionally powerful divinity. According to Hesiod, he walked calmly across the land and the vast sea and was compassionate toward humanity. The deity would usually approach individuals from the air and could put them to sleep using an assortment of tools, including his wings, a twig, a wand bathed in the River Lethe’s waters, or a horn loaded with sleep-inducing medications.\n\nFresco from Delos depicting Hypnos covering a sleeping woman with a curtain or veil; Zde, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nHypnos could also put gods and humans to sleep by covering them with a curtain or simply being present. However, when he attended the wedding of Cadmus and Harmonia he intentionally left his wand at home to ensure that the couple would not spend their wedding night asleep.\n\nHypnos has a dual nature. On the one hand, he was a peaceful, benevolent force – the personification of pleasant sleep and a liberating force from stress and anxiety. On the other side, Hypnos was strongly associated with death – after all, Thanatos, the personification of death, was his twin brother – and could therefore be frightening. Furthermore, as the Greek god of sleep, Hypnos was often seen as a deceiving god. He was thought to be a Dionysian in some later versions. He was also regarded as Eros’s companion in some versions.\n\nAttributes and Personality of the Greek God Hypnos\n\nHypnos was recognized for inducing peaceful rest and dreams that were pleasant. He employed a careful approach, utilizing his wings to discreetly and softly descend on individuals, enabling them to drop off to sleep. Hypnos was seen as a source of relief and refreshment, providing an escape from the anxieties and grief of the waking world. While Hypnos was primarily portrayed as a beneficent individual, he did have the capacity to deny sleep to those he thought unworthy and to utilize his skills to manipulate dreams in different ways.\n\nHypnos (Dream) by Gyula Benczúr (1920); Gyula Benczúr, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nIf offended or if it served the purposes of the gods, he was also able to produce nightmares or unpleasant visions.\n\nHypnos was strongly affiliated with the domain of darkness and the shift from being conscious to being asleep as the son of the goddess of night, and the brother of death personified. His peaceful mindset symbolized the required balance between the awake and sleeping phases. Though seldom shown as particularly active or forceful, Hypnos was held in high reverence and respect by the other gods. Even great deities like Zeus and Hera sought his assistance, as they understood the significance and role of sleep and dreams in the universe.\n\nPhysical Attributes and Depictions in Art\n\nHypnos is sometimes represented with wings on his temples or shoulders, illustrating his power to quickly descend on a person and put them to sleep. These wings signify his ethereal nature and his capacity to travel between the gods’ and mortals’ realms. Hypnos is often depicted grasping a poppy blossom or encircled by poppies. These blossoms were connected to sleep in Greek mythology and were known to have sedative effects, therefore they were an appropriate symbol for Hypnos.\n\nRoman statuette of Somnus/Hypnos with winged head, holding poppy seed heads in his left hand while pouring sleep from a horn in his right hand; Ad Meskens, CC BY-SA 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nHypnos is typically depicted with a serene and tranquil expression, which reflects his gentle and calming personality.\n\nThe Greek god Hypnos is often portrayed as a young deity, illustrating the concept that sleep rejuvenates. He tends to appear with an invigorated and serene visage, reflecting the state of renewal that sleep provides. Hypnos is depicted in flowing robes or clothing that drapes around his body. This lightweight clothing evokes the dreamy, intangible characteristics of sleeping. The Greek god Hypnos was also often represented alongside his brother Thanatos, particularly in early artwork.\n\nAn episode from the Iliad in which the two brothers carry the body of the dead hero Sarpedon back to his hometown in Lycia was a popular subject for Greek vase artists.\n\nAttic white-ground lekythos showing Thanatos and Hypnos carrying Sarpedon’s body from the battlefield by the Thanatos Painter (c. 440 BCE); British Museum, CC BY 2.5, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nThanatos and Hypnos statues were also featured in ancient Sparta’s citadel. They were represented as children in Nyx’s arms on the famed Cypselus Chest. He was regularly depicted with healing gods like Hygieia and Asclepius. There was a sculpture of Hypnos lulling a lion to sleep in an Asclepius temple near Sicyon. The scene where the god Dionysus finds Ariadne who has been sent to sleep by Hypnos was also a favorite topic in ancient art.\n\nA bronze head of the Greek god of sleep, currently housed in the British Museum in London, is one of the most renowned works of art portraying Hypnos. Wings emerge from his temples, and his hair is intricately arranged, some strands tied in knots and others hanging freely from his head.\n\nBronze head of Hypnos (1st – 2nd Century CE); Carole Raddato from FRANKFURT, Germany, CC BY-SA 2.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nHypnos in Greek Mythology\n\nWhile the Greek god of sleep is a lesser-known deity in Greek mythology, he was well-liked by the ancient Greeks. He was regarded as a peaceful and calm deity. Mortals did not fear him, and instead, they felt they owed the god half their lives because of their need for sleeping and dreaming. Let us find out what role he played in the Iliad.\n\nHypnos and Zeus\n\nHypnos utilized his abilities to deceive Zeus in one tale. Zeus had promised the sea-goddess Thetis, mother of Achilles, that he would make the Greeks regret their disrespectful behavior towards her son by making them lose to the Trojans during his absence from the battlefield. Hera was enraged by this and devised a scheme to tip the scales back in favor of the Greeks. Hera summoned the goddess of love, Aphrodite, and requested a talisman that would assure the success of her deception. However, in order to obtain the talisman, she had to lie to Aphrodite who favored the Trojans. She explained to Aphrodite that she needed a talisman to stop herself and Zeus from fighting. Aphrodite eventually consented to Hera’s request.\n\nHera was nearly ready to deceive Zeus, but she required the assistance of Hypnos, who had previously helped her when she wanted to punish Herakles behind his divine father’s back.\n\nHera summoned Hypnos and urged him to assist her by putting Zeus to sleep. Hypnos was hesitant since the previous time he put the deity to sleep, Zeus awakened enraged and embarked on a rampage in search of Hypnos. Hypnos avoided Zeus by hiding in the home of his mother, Nyx. This made Hypnos hesitant to accept Hera’s proposal and assist her in deceiving Zeus on this occasion too. Hera initially presented him with a stunning golden throne that would never break apart and a footstool to match.\n\nBell-krater with a depiction of Hera conspiring with Hypnos while Europa pleads with Zeus to spare the life of Sarpedon (c. 400-380 BCE); Metropolitan Museum of Art, CC0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nHypnos turned down the initial offer, but Hera ultimately persuaded him with the promise that he could marry Pasithea, one of the younger Graces. Hypnos had made vows by the river Styx and summoned the gods of the underworld as witnesses in order to assure that he married Pasithea.\n\nHera went to visit Zeus atop Mount Ida’s highest summit, Gargarus. Zeus was enamored with her and detected nothing while Hypnos was cloaked in a dense mist and hiding behind a pine tree. Hera told Zeus the same lies she had told Aphrodite when he questioned what she was doing there and why she had come from Olympus. She told him she was going to try to help her parents to stop fighting, but she paused to consult him since she didn’t want to leave without him knowing and have him be unhappy with her when he eventually found out. Zeus stated she could come whenever she wanted and that she should put off her visit and remain with him so they could take pleasure in each other’s company. Zeus informed her that he had never loved someone as much as he did her at the time.\n\nWith Hera in his arms, he embraced her and Hypnos then subsequently put him to sleep.\n\nWhile this was going on, Hypnos went to the Achaeans’ ships to inform Poseidon that he was able to assist the Greeks by providing them victory as Zeus was still deeply sleeping. Hypnos exits the legend here. The fight shifted in favor of the Greeks as a result of Hypnos’ assistance in fooling Zeus, and Zeus never found out that Hypnos had deceived him again.\n\nHypnos and Endymion\n\nEndymion was an attractive mortal shepherd who caught the eye of Selene, the moon goddess in this myth. Selene fell in love with Endymion and asked Zeus for a favor. She begged Zeus to provide Endymion with perpetual sleep and endless youth so she could see him every night without ever getting old or waking up. Endymion fell into a perpetual slumber on Mount Latmos after Zeus granted Selene’s wishes. Selene descended from the sky each night to be with Endymion, looking at his sleeping body and showering her love on him.\n\nHypnos enters the story at this point was in charge of initiating and sustaining Endymion’s eternal sleep.\n\nDetail of a sarcophagus showing Hypnos pouring sleep from a horn onto Endymion while Selene looks on (early 3rd Century CE); Louvre Museum, CC BY 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nHypnos kept Endymion in a perpetual state of sleep, which enabled Selene to visit him without disturbing him or waking him up. The myth’s inclusion of Hypnos emphasizes his function as a facilitator of sleep and dreams in Greek mythology. He contributed to the continuation of Selene’s love affair with Endymion by keeping Endymion perpetually sleeping without being influenced by the passage of time. Endymion’s tale represents the eternal and unattainable nature of idealistic love. It romanticizes the idea of perpetual sleep, in which Endymion’s beauty has been frozen in time, permanently captivating Selene.\n\nIn some versions of the myth it was Hypnos himself who fell in love with Endymion and had him sleep with his eyes open so that he could gaze into his lover’s eyes all the time.\n\nHypnos and Dionysus\n\nThere were also more serious and darker myths about Hypnos assisting Dionysus with some of his sexual endeavors such as lulling gorgeous nymphs to sleep so Dionysus was able to sneak up on the nymphs and rape them. He first did this to the nymph Nicaea, and then afterward to the nymph Aura.\n\nAura had made the mistake of questioning Artemis’ virginity, claiming that the goddess was too curvaceous to be a virgin. Artemis intended to punish Aura by taking away her precious virginity.\n\nShe enlisted the assistance of Nemesis, the goddess of vengeance, and the god of love, Eros, who made Dionysus fall madly in love with Aura. While Dionysus was stalking the virgin nymph, Hypnos lulled her to sleep.\n\nFresco from Pompeii depicting Dionysus discovering Ariadne asleep with Hypnos at her side (1st Century CE); Sailko, CC BY-SA 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nHypnos and Thanatos\n\nDuring the Trojan War, an important incident involving Hypnos and his brother, Thanatos, is recounted in Homer’s poem, the Iliad. Many of the gods had sons who fought in this war. Zeus noticed his son Sarpedon’s plight on the battlefield during a critical juncture in the Trojan War when Sarpedon was engaged in combat against the hero Patroclus. This occurred during a juncture when Zeus had decreed that Patroclus should be momentarily victorious, before his ultimate demise at the hands of Hector.\n\nZeus sympathized with his son’s situation and considered saving him. However, Hera warned him that if he were to prevent Sarpedon from dying, all the other gods would want their sons to be spared death as well, and the natural order of things would be disrupted.\n\nZeus instructed Thanatos and Hypnos to carry Sarpedon’s body away from the battlefield to Lycia, so that he could be buried in his homeland.\n\nKrater showing Hypnos and Thanatos directed by Hermes to carry the Body of Sarpedon to Lycia by Euxithéos (potter) and Euphrenios (painter) (c. 515 BCE); Jaime Ardiles-Arce (photographer). Krater by Euphronios (painter) and Euxitheos (potter)., Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nHypnos and the Indians\n\nIn Nonnus’ epic poem, the Dionysiaca, Hypnos assists the Indians in their battle against the child Dionysus. In one episode, the Indians, headed by their monarch Deriades, revolted against Dionysus, who was portrayed as a young and strong divinity. The Indians attempted to defy and overthrow Dionysus because he represented a threat to their territory and customs. Recognizing Dionysus’ strength as well as his divine abilities, the Indians sought aid from the gods.\n\nTheir cries were heard by Hera, who sympathized with their plight. Hera decided to help the Indians and enlisted the help of Hypnos.\n\nUnder Hera’s direction, Hypnos entered the conflict by momentarily knocking Dionysus out with his sleep-inducing skills. Hypnos lessened Dionysus’ heavenly influence and reduced his influence on the battlefield by lulling him to sleep. The Indians took the upper hand in the conflict while Dionysus was briefly immobilized. They launched powerful strikes and advanced on Dionysus’ supporters, certain that they could vanquish him. However, the centaur Chiron, Dionysus’ companion, and tutor, stepped in.\n\nMosaic depicting the Conquest of India by Dionysus (c. 200 – 300 CE); Jona Lendering, CC0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nChiron recognized the threat that Hypnos’ involvement posed and managed to rouse Dionysus from his slumber. Dionysus, now rejuvenated from his sleep, resumed his task and quickly shifted the course of the war. In the subsequent conflict, Dionysus defeated the Indians and triumphed. The intervention of Hypnos ultimately failed to prevent Dionysus’ influence, since he is a deity who embodies the forces of life, fertility, and ecstasy.\n\nHypnos in Western Psychology\n\nThe term “hypnosis” first appeared in psychology in the late 18th century, established by a Scottish pioneer in the study of hypnosis, James Braid. The phrase was derived from the Greek word “hypnos”, but it particularly refers to the state of centered relaxation and heightened suggestibility achieved during hypnosis.\n\nHypnosis is a condition of altered consciousness characterized by enhanced suggestibility, focused concentration, and heightened relaxation.\n\nMan Hypnotizing a Woman using the animal Magnetism Method engraving after D. Dodd (1802); See page for author, CC BY 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nIt has been used as a form of treatment to assist people in accessing and processing subconscious ideas, emotions, and memories. In the field of psychology, hypnosis has been used to induce relaxation, manage pain, relieve anxiety and phobias, conquer addictions, and address a variety of mental and behavioral issues.
