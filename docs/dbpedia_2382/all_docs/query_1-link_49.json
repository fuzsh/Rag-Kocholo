But Sleep roams peacefully over the earth and the sea’s broad back and is kindly to men; while Death has a heart of iron, and his spirit within him is pitiless as bronze: whomsoever of men he has once seized he holds fast: and he is hateful.\n\nHesiod, Theogony (Origins of the Gods), c 750-650 BC\n\nImage courtesy of © 2012 Thinkstock\n\nIn the fables\n\nthey are twins,\n\nHypnos and Thanatos,\n\nsons of Night.\n\nShe reigned\n\nbefore light breathed\n\nupon the waters,\n\nbefore electricity,\n\nthat’s sure,\n\nDarkness primordial,\n\na force to be reckoned with —\n\nfor besides\n\nSleep and Death,\n\nNight brought\n\nDoom into the world,\n\nStrife and\n\nRetribution:\n\nWhat a brood!\n\nSleep was the younger brother,\n\nand as youngsters do,\n\nhe imitated his elder,\n\nwhich is why\n\nthe sleeping and the dead\n\nare look-alikes:\n\nlimbs slack,\n\nmouths agape —\n\n“sleeps like the dead,”\n\n“dead to the world,”\n\nwe say of sleepers —\n\nexcept that sleepers\n\nwake back up.\n\nIn the old paintings\n\nHypnos snoozes in a cave,\n\nLethe, the river of forgetfulness,\n\nflows nearby,\n\nwhile all about\n\nnod poppies\n\n(even then, humankind\n\nknew about those poppies),\n\nand I have seen him\n\ndepicted with wings\n\ngrowing out of his head.\n\nWhy wings?\n\nPerhaps because\n\nhe’s fleeting,\n\nnever deigns to stay\n\nfor long\n\n(not with me, anyway),\n\nwhereas Death\n\nholds you forever,\n\nthat iron grip of his.\n\nAn altogether gentler deity\n\nis Hypnos,\n\nkinder to mortals,\n\nyet no sacrificial altars\n\nburn to him,\n\nno voices rise in supplication,\n\nno Orphic hymns,\n\nas to his fierce twin —\n\nand isn’t that always the way it goes?\n\nThe mower-down of men\n\ngets cast in bronze,\n\nthe nice guy never gets\n\nthat kind of esteem.\n\nI even hear it said,\n\n“Sleep is for sissies,”\n\n“You snooze, you lose” —\n\nsuch disrespect!\n\n(I guess\n\nhe does look a little silly,\n\nthose wings\n\nsprouting out of his head.)\n\nBut take care!\n\nSleep has powers\n\nas mighty as his twin:\n\nthe way they\n\nseize us,\n\nspirit us away\n\nto an underworld\n\nthat confounds all sense\n\nof who we are —\n\nfor I can say, “I die,”\n\nbut if “I” am not there\n\nto say it,\n\nwhat “I” are we talking about?\n\nAnd so it is with Sleep:\n\nI am not “I” in sleep,\n\nthat “I”\n\nI know myself to be,\n\nconscious, cognizant, in control —\n\nthat self gets\n\nchecked at the mouth\n\nof Hypnos’ cave,\n\ndrowned in the waters of oblivion.\n\nBut if death is an undiscovered\n\ncountry\n\nfrom which no traveller returns,\n\nSleep is a realm\n\nfrom which we do return,\n\nemerging dazed\n\ninto day’s light,\n\nrubbing sleep from\n\ncrusted lids,\n\nshuffling back into\n\nour mortal coils,\n\nknowing not\n\nwhere we’ve been\n\nnor how we were\n\ntransported\n\nthere or back,\n\nnor who we were\n\nin the time\n\nwe were away,\n\nand the tales we return with\n\ntell more about ourselves\n\nthan the regions we’ve traversed.\n\nAnd here’s the paradox:\n\nthat “I” —\n\nthat wakeful self\n\nI pride myself on being,\n\nsapiens, sentient, self-aware —\n\nneed this stupefaction:\n\nwithout it,\n\nI’m a tattered rag,\n\nwith Sleep,\n\nI am myself again.\n\nMen of science\n\nin these enlightened times\n\nadmit that they know\n\nnothing,\n\nneither the how of Sleep\n\nnor the why.\n\nThey speculate it may be\n\ngamma amino-butyric acid\n\nin concert with\n\nthe ventrolateral preoptic nucleus\n\nthat >flips the switch,\n\ntheir terms describe,\n\ndo not explain:\n\nThey cannot tell us\n\nwhat goes on\n\nin Hypnos’ cave\n\nthat restores us\n\nto ourselves\n\nor say how Sleep\n\nknits up\n\nthe ravelled sleeve of self —\n\nThey say\n\nSleep is a mystery.\n\nAnd so\n\nSleep is a province\n\nas fit\n\nfor philosophers\n\nwith their imponderables,\n\nand for poets\n\nwith their paradoxes,\n\nas it is for scientists,\n\nwhose scrutiny\n\nSleep gives the slip:"
