The absorption of some earlier cults into the newer pantheon versus those that resisted being absorbed is suggested as providing the later myths.\n\nChthonic (UK /ÀàkŒ∏…ín…™k/, US /ÀàŒ∏…ín…™k/ from Greek œáŒ∏œåŒΩŒπŒøœÇ khthonios [k ∞t ∞√≥nios], ‚Äúin, under, or beneath the earth‚Äù, from œáŒ∏œéŒΩ khth≈çn ‚Äúearth‚Äù)[1] literally means ‚Äúsubterranean‚Äù. The translation of meaning discusses deities or spirits of the underworld, especially in Greek religion. The Greek word khthon is one of several for ‚Äúearth\"; it typically refers to the interior of the soil, rather than the living surface of the land (as Gaia or Ge does), or the land as territory (as khora (œáœéœÅŒ±) does). It evokes, simultaneously, abundance and the grave.\n\n1.1.2 Ambiguities in assignment The categories Olympian and chthonic were not, however, completely separate. Some Olympian deities, such as Hermes and Zeus, also received chthonic sacriÔ¨Åces and tithes in certain locations. The deiÔ¨Åed heroes Heracles and Asclepius might be worshipped as gods or chthonic heroes, depending on the site and the time of origin of the myth.\n\nMoreover, a few deities aren't easily classiÔ¨Åable under these terms. Hecate, for instance, was typically oÔ¨Äered puppies at crossroads‚Äîa practice neither typical of an While terms such as ‚ÄúEarth deity‚Äù or Earth mother have Olympian sacriÔ¨Åce nor of a chthonic sacriÔ¨Åce to Persesweeping implications in English, the words khthonie and phone or the heroes. Because of her underworld roles, khthonios had a more precise and technical meaning in Hecate is generally classed as chthonic. Greek, referring primarily to the manner of oÔ¨Äering sacriÔ¨Åces to the deity in question.\n\n1.1 Chthonic and Olympian\n\n1.2 References in psychology and anthropology\n\nSome chthonic cults practised ritual sacriÔ¨Åce, which often happened at night time. When the sacriÔ¨Åce was a living creature, the animal was placed in a bothros (Œ≤œåŒ∏œÅŒøœÇ, ‚Äúpit‚Äù) or megaron (ŒºŒ≠Œ≥Œ±œÅŒøŒΩ, ‚Äúsunken chamber‚Äù). In some Greek chthonic cults, the animal was sacriÔ¨Åced on a raised bomos (Œ≤œâŒºœåœÇ, \"altar\"). OÔ¨Äerings usually were burned whole or buried rather than being cooked and shared among the worshippers.[2]\n\n1.1.1\n\nIn analytical psychology, the term chthonic was often used to describe the spirit of nature within; the unconscious earthly impulses of the Self, that is one‚Äôs material depths, however not necessarily with negative connotations, see also anima and animus or shadow. As well, the chthonic has connotations with regard to gender, in cultural anthropology; del Valle‚Äôs Gendered Anthropology describes there being ‚Äúmale and female deities at every level... men associated with the above, the sky, and women associated with the below, with the earth, water of the underground, and the chthonic deities.‚Äù[3] This was by no means universal; in Ancient Egypt the main deity of the earth was the male god Geb, his female consort was Nut, otherwise known as the sky. Greek mythology likewise has female deities associated with the sky, such as Dike, goddess of justice who sits on the right side\n\nCult type versus function\n\nThe myths associating the underworld chthonic deities and fertility was not exclusive. Myths about the later Olympian deities also described an association with the fertility and the prosperity of Earth. Thus Demeter and Persephone both watched over aspects of the fertility of land, yet Demeter had a typically Olympian cult while Persephone had a chthonic one. Also, Demeter was worshipped alongside Persephone 1\n\n2\n\nCHAPTER 1.

[2] ‚ÄúThe sacriÔ¨Åce for gods of the dead and for heroes was called enagisma, in contradistinction to thysia, which was the portion especially of the celestial deities. It was offered on altars of a peculiar shape: they were lower than the ordinary altar bomos, and their name was ischara, 'hearth'. Through them the blood of the victims, and also libations, were to Ô¨Çow into the sacriÔ¨Åcial trench. Therefore they were funnel-shaped and open at the bottom. For this kind of sacriÔ¨Åce did not lead up to a joyous feast in which the gods and men took part. The victim was held over the trench with its head down, not, as for the celestial gods, with its neck bent back and the head uplifted; and it was burned entirely.‚Äù (Source The Heroes of the Greeks, C.

Her name means quite speciÔ¨Åcally, with her sister Isis in funerary rites[2] because of their role as protectors of the mummy and the god Osiris and as the ‚ÄúLady of the [Temple] Enclosure‚Äù which associates her with the role of priestess. sister-wife of Set. This title, which may be more of an epithet describing her function than a given name, probably indicates the association of Nephthys with one particular temple or some speciÔ¨Åc aspect of the Egyptian temple ritual. Along with her sister Isis, Nephthys represented the temple pylon or trapezoidal tower gateway entrance to the temple which also displayed the Ô¨ÇagstaÔ¨Ä. This entrance way symbolised the horizon or akhet.\n\n3.1 Etymology\n\n3.2 Function At the time of the Fifth Dynasty Pyramid Texts, Nephthys appears as a goddess of the Heliopolitan Ennead. She is the sister of Isis and companion of the war-like deity, Set. As sister of Isis and especially Osiris, Nephthys is a protective goddess who symbolizes the death experience, just as Isis represented the (re-)birth experience. Nephthys was known in some ancient Egyptian temple theologies and cosmologies as the ‚ÄúUseful Goddess‚Äù or the ‚ÄúExcellent Goddess‚Äù.[3] These late Ancient Egyptian temple texts describe a goddess who represented divine assistance and protective guardianship. Nephthys is regarded as the mother of the funerary-deity Anubis (Inpu) in some myths.[4][5] Alternatively Anubis appears as the son of Bastet[6] or Isis.[7] As the primary ‚Äúnursing mother‚Äù of the incarnate Pharaonic-god, Horus, Nephthys also was considered to be the nurse of the reigning Pharaoh himself.[8] Though other goddesses could assume this role, Nephthys was most usually portrayed in this function. In contrast NephNephthys - Mus√©e du Louvre, Paris, France thys is sometimes featured as a rather ferocious and danNephthys is the Greek form of an epithet (transliter- gerous divinity, capable of incinerating the enemies of 5\n\n6 the Pharaoh with her Ô¨Åery breath.[9] New Kingdom Ramesside Pharaohs, in particular, were enamored of Mother Nephthys, as is attested in various stelae and a wealth of inscriptions at Karnak and Luxor, where Nephthys was a member of that great city‚Äôs Ennead and her altars were present in the massive complex.[10]\n\nCHAPTER 3. NEPHTHYS ation with the kite or the Egyptian hawk (and its piercing, mournful cries) evidently reminded the ancients of the lamentations usually oÔ¨Äered for the dead by wailing women. In this capacity, it is easy to see how Nephthys could be associated with death and putrefaction in the Pyramid Texts. She was, almost without fail, depicted as crowned by the hieroglyphics signifying her name, which were a combination of signs for the sacred temple enclosure (hwt), along with the sign for neb, or mistress (Lady), on top of the enclosure sign.[13] Nephthys was clearly viewed as a morbid-but-crucial force of heavenly transition, i.e., the Pharaoh becomes strong for his journey to the afterlife through the intervention of Isis and Nephthys. The same divine power could be applied later to all of the dead, who were advised to consider Nephthys a necessary companion. According to the Pyramid Texts, Nephthys, along with Isis, was a force before whom demons trembled in fear, and whose magical spells were necessary for navigating the various levels of Duat, as the region of the afterlife was termed. It should here be noted that Nephthys was not necessarily viewed as the polar opposite of Isis, but rather as a diÔ¨Äerent reÔ¨Çection of the same reality: eternal life in transition. Thus, Nephthys was also seen in the Pyramid Texts as a supportive cosmic force occupying the night-bark on the journey of Ra, the majestic sun god, particularly when he entered Duat at the transitional time of dusk, or twilight. Isis was Ra‚Äôs companion at the coming of dawn.\n\n3.4 Nephthys and Set Though it commonly has been assumed that Nephthys was married to Set and they have a son Anubis, reTriad of Isis, Nephthys, and Harpocrates. Early Greco-Roman. cent Egyptological research has called this into question. Walters Museum Levai notes that while Plutarch‚Äôs De Iside et Osiride mentions the deity‚Äôs marriage, there is very little speciÔ¨Åcally Nephthys was typically paired with her sister Isis in fu- linking Nephthys and Set in the original early Egyptian nerary rites[2] because of their role as protectors of the sources. She argues that the later evidence suggests that: mummy and the god Osiris and as the sister-wife of Seth. Less well understood than her sister Isis, Nephthys was no less important in Egyptian Religion as conÔ¨Årmed by the work of E. Hornung,[11] along with the work of several noted scholars. ‚ÄúAscend and descend; descend with Nephthys, sink into darkness with the Night-bark. Ascend and descend; ascend with Isis, rise with the Day-bark.‚Äù Pyramid Text Utterance 222 line 210.[12]\n\n3.3 Symbolism\n\nwhile Nephthys‚Äôs marriage to Set was a part of Egyptian mythology, it was not a part of the myth of the murder and resurrection of Osiris. She was not paired with Set the villain, but with Set‚Äôs other aspect, the benevolent Ô¨Ågure who was the killer of Apophis. This was the aspect of Set worshiped in the western oases during the Roman period, where he is depicted with Nephthys as co-ruler.[14]\n\n3.5 The saving sister of Osiris\n\nIn the funerary role, Nephthys often was depicted as a kite, or as a woman with falcon wings, usually out- Nephthys plays an important role in the Osirian mythstretched as a symbol of protection.

No cult is attested for her there, though she certainly Ô¨Ågured as a goddess of great importance in the annual rites conducted, wherein two chosen females or priestesses played the roles of Isis and Nephthys and performed the elaborate 'Lamentations of Isis and Nephthys‚Äô. There, at Abydos, Nephthys joined Isis as a mourner in the shrine known as the Osireion.[16] These \"Festival Songs of Isis and Nephthys\" were ritual elements of many such Osirian rites in major ancient Egyptian cult-centers. As a mortuary goddess (along with Isis, Neith, and Serqet), Nephthys was one of the protectresses of the Canopic jars of the Hapi. Hapi, one of the Sons of Horus, guarded the embalmed lungs. Thus we Ô¨Ånd Nephthys endowed with the epithet, ‚ÄúNephthys of the Bed of Life,‚Äù[17] in direct reference to her regenerative priorities on the embalming table. In the city of Memphis, Nephthys was duly honored with the title ‚ÄúQueen of the Embalmer‚Äôs Shop,‚Äù and there associated with the jackal-headed god Anubis as patron.[18]\n\nNephthys - Greco-Roman era painted image on a linen and tempera shroud - c. 300-200 B.C. - Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nNephthys was also considered a festive deity whose rites could mandate the liberal consumption of beer. In various reliefs at Edfu, Dendera, and Behbeit, Nephthys is depicted receiving lavish beer-oÔ¨Äerings from the Pharaoh, which she would ‚Äúreturn‚Äù, using her power as a beergoddess ‚Äúthat [the pharaoh] may have joy with no hangover.‚Äù Elsewhere at Edfu, for example, Nephthys is a goddess who gives the Pharaoh power to see ‚Äúthat which is hidden by moonlight.‚Äù This Ô¨Åts well with more general textual themes that consider Nephthys to be a goddess whose unique domain was darkness, or the perilous edges of the desert. Nephthys could also appear as one of the goddesses who assists at childbirth. One ancient Egyptian myth preserved in the Papyrus Westcar recounts the story of Isis, Nephthys, Meskhenet, and Heqet as traveling dancers in disguise, assisting the wife of a priest of Amun-Re as she prepares to bring forth sons who are destined for fame and fortune.\n\nIsis - Greco-Roman era painted image on a linen and tempera shroud - c. 300-200 B.C. - Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nIt is Nephthys who assists Isis in gathering and mourning the dismembered portions of the body of Osiris, after his murder by the envious Set. Nephthys also serves as the nursemaid and watchful guardian of the infant Horus. The Pyramid Texts refer to Isis as the ‚Äúbirth-mother‚Äù and to Nephthys as the ‚Äúnursing-mother‚Äù of Horus. Nephthys was attested as one of the four ‚ÄúGreat Chiefs‚Äù ruling in the Osirian cult-center of Busiris, in the Delta[15] and she appears to have occupied an honorary position\n\nNephthys‚Äôs healing skills and status as direct counterpart of Isis, steeped, as her sister in ‚Äúwords of power,‚Äù are evidenced by the abundance of faience amulets carved in her likeness, and by her presence in a variety of magical papyri that sought to summon her famously altruistic qualities to the aid of mortals.[19]\n\n3.6 New Kingdom cults of Nephthys The Ramesside Pharaohs were particularly devoted to Set‚Äôs prerogatives and, in the 19th Dynasty, a temple of Nephthys called the ‚ÄúHouse of Nephthys of Ramesses-Meriamun‚Äù was built or refurbished in the town of Sepermeru, midway between Oxyrhynchos and\n\n8 Herakleopolis, on the outskirts of the Fayyum and quite near to the modern site of Deshasheh. Here, as Papyrus Wilbour notes in its wealth of taxation records and land assessments, the temple of Nephthys was a speciÔ¨Åc foundation by Ramesses II, located in close proximity to (or within) the precinct of the enclosure of Set. To be certain, the House of Nephthys was one of Ô¨Åfty individual, land-owning temples delineated for this portion of the Middle Egyptian district in Papyrus Wilbour. The Ô¨Åelds and other holdings belonging to Nephthys‚Äôs temple were under the authority of two Nephthys-prophets (named Penpmer and Merybarse) and one (mentioned) wa'ab priest of the goddess. While certainly aÔ¨Éliated with the ‚ÄúHouse of Set,‚Äù the Nephthys temple at Sepermeru and its apportioned lands (several acres) clearly were under administration distinct from the Set institution.[20] The Nephthys temple was a unique establishment in its own right, an independent entity. According to Papyrus Wilbour,[21] another ‚ÄúHouse of Nephthys of Ramesses-Meriamun‚Äù seems to have existed to the north, in the town of Su, closer to the Fayyum region. Another temple of Nephthys seems to have existed in the town of Punodjem. The Papyrus Bologna records a complaint lodged by a prophet of the temple of Set in that town regarding undue taxation in his regard. After making an introductory appeal to ‚ÄúRe-Horakhte, Set, and Nephthys‚Äù for the ultimate resolution of this issue by the royal Vizier, the prophet (named Pra'emhab) laments his workload. He notes his obvious administration of the ‚ÄúHouse of Set‚Äù and adds: ‚ÄúI am also responsible for the ship, and I am responsible likewise for the House of Nephthys, along with a heap of other temples.‚Äù[22] As ‚ÄúNephthys of Ramesses-Meriamun,‚Äù the goddess and her shrines were under the particular endorsement of Ramesses II. The foundations of the Set and Nephthys temples at Sepermeru Ô¨Ånally were discovered and identiÔ¨Åed in the 1980s, and the Nephthys temple was a selfsustaining temple complex within the Set enclosure.[23] There can be little doubt that a cult of Nephthys existed in the temple and great town of Herakleopolis, north of Sepermeru. A near life-sized statue of Nephthys (currently housed in the Louvre) boasts a curiously altered inscription. The basalt image originally was stationed at Medinet-Habu, as part of the cultic celebration of the Pharaonic ‚ÄúSed-Festival,‚Äù but was transferred at some point to Herakleopolis and the temple of Herishef. The cult-image‚Äôs inscription originally pertained to ‚ÄúNephthys, Foremost of the Sed [Festival] in the Booth of Annals‚Äù (at Medinet-Habu), but was re-inscribed or re-dedicated to ‚ÄúNephthys, Foremost of the [Booths of] Herakleopolis.‚Äù A ‚Äúprophet of Nephthys‚Äù is indeed attested for the town of Herakleopolis in the 30th Dynasty.[24]\n\nCHAPTER 3. NEPHTHYS\n\n3.7 Chief goddess of Nome VII Nephthys was considered the unique protectress of the Sacred Phoenix, or the Bennu Bird. This role may have stemmed from an early association in her native Heliopolis, which was renowned for its ‚ÄúHouse of the Bennu‚Äù temple. In this role, Nephthys was given the name ‚ÄúNephthys-Kheresket,‚Äù and a wealth of temple texts from Edfu, Dendera, Philae, Kom Ombo, El Qa'la, Esna, and others corroborate the late identiÔ¨Åcation of Nephthys as the supreme goddess of Upper Egyptian Nome VII, where another shrine existed in honor of the Bennu. Nephthys also was the goddess of the ‚ÄúMansion of the Sistrum\" in Hwt-Sekhem (Gr. Diospolis Parva), the chief city of Nome VII. There, Nephthys was the primary protectress of the resident Osirian relic, of the Bennu Bird, and of the local Horus/Osiris manifestation, the god Neferhotep.[25] Nephthys was most widely and usually worshipped in ancient Egypt as part of a consortium of temple deities. Therefore, it should not surprise us that her cult images could likely be found as part of the divine entourage in temples at Kharga, Kellis, Deir el-Hagar, Koptos, Dendera, Philae, Sebennytos, Busiris, Shenhur, El Qa'la, Letopolis, Heliopolis, Abydos, Thebes, Dakleh Oasis, and indeed throughout Egypt.[26] In most cases, Nephthys found her typical place as part of a triad alongside Osiris and Isis, or Isis and Horus, or Isis and Min, or as part of a quartet of deities. It is perhaps in this way that Nephthys best fulÔ¨Ålled her role as an important national deity whose ideal function was to provide powerful assistance to her associates in a great variety of temple cults‚Äî a truly ‚ÄúUseful‚Äù and ‚ÄúExcellent‚Äù goddess, as her primary epithets reÔ¨Çect.\n\n3.8 References [1] Or /Ààn…õfŒ∏…®s/.

Hecate or Hekate (/Ààh…õk…ôtiÀê, Ààh…õk…™t/; Greek ·ºôŒ∫Œ¨œÑŒ∑, Hek√°tƒì) is a goddess in Greek religion and mythology, most often shown holding two torches or a key[1] and in later periods depicted in triple form. She was variously associated with crossroads, entrance-ways, dogs, light, the moon, magic, witchcraft, knowledge of herbs and poisonous plants, ghosts, necromancy, and sorcery.[2][3] In the post-Christian writings of the Chaldean Oracles (2nd3rd century CE) she was regarded with (some) rulership over earth, sea and sky, as well as a more universal role as Saviour (Soteira), Mother of Angels and the Cosmic World Soul.[4][5] She was one of the main deities worshiped in Athenian households as a protective goddess and one who bestowed prosperity and daily blessings on the family.[6]\n\nmon practice in English to pronounce her name in two syllables, even when spelled with Ô¨Ånal e, well into the 19th century. The spelling Hecat is due to Arthur Golding's 1567 translation of Ovid's Metamorphoses,[13] and this spelling without the Ô¨Ånal E later appears in plays of the ElizabethanJacobean period.[14] Noah Webster in 1866 particularly credits the inÔ¨Çuence of Shakespeare for the thenpredominant disyllabic pronunciation of the name.[15]\n\n7.2 Representations\n\nHecate may have originated among the Carians of Anatolia, where variants of her name are found as names given to children. William Berg observes, ‚ÄúSince children are not called after spooks, it is safe to assume that Carian theophoric names involving hekat- refer to a major deity free from the dark and unsavoury ties to the underworld and to witchcraft associated with the Hecate of classical Athens.‚Äù[7] She also closely parallels the Roman goddess Trivia, with whom she was identiÔ¨Åed in Rome.\n\n7.1 Name The etymology of the name Hecate (·ºôŒ∫Œ¨œÑŒ∑, Hek√°tƒì) is not known .

The goddess is seated on a throne with a chaplet bound round her head; she is altogether without attributes and character, and the main historical value of this work, which is evidently of quite a general type and gets a special reference and name merely from the inscription, is that it proves the single shape to be her earlier form, and her recognition at Athens to be earlier than the Persian invasion.[16]\n\nIn Egyptian-inspired Greek esoteric writings connected with Hermes Trismegistus, and in magical papyri of Late Antiquity she is described as having three heads: one dog, one serpent, and one horse. In other representations her animal heads include those of a cow and a boar.[18] Hecate‚Äôs triplicity is elsewhere expressed in a more Hellenic fashion in the vast frieze of the great Pergamon Altar, now in Berlin, wherein she is shown with three bodies, taking part in the battle with the Titans. In the Argolid, near the shrine of the Dioscuri, Pausanias saw the temple of Hecate opposite the sanctuary of Eileithyia; He reported the image to be the work of Scopas, stating further, ‚ÄúThis one is of stone, while the bronze images opposite, also of Hecate, were made respectively by Polycleitus and his brother Naucydes, son of Mothon.‚Äù (Description of Greece 2.22.7) A 4th-century BCE marble relief from Crannon in Thessaly was dedicated by a race-horse owner.[19] It shows Hecate, with a hound beside her, placing a wreath on the head of a mare. She is commonly attended by a dog or dogs, and the most common form of oÔ¨Äering was to leave meat at a crossroads. Images of her attended by a dog [20] are also found at times when she is shown as in her role as mother goddess with child, and when she is depicted alongside the god Hermes and the goddess Kybele in reliefs.[21] In the Argonautica, a 3rd-century BCE Alexandrian epic based on early material,[22] Jason placates Hecate in a ritual prescribed by Medea, her priestess: bathed at midnight in a stream of Ô¨Çowing water, and dressed in dark robes, Jason is to dig a round pit and over it cut the throat of a ewe, sacriÔ¨Åcing it and then burning it whole on a pyre next to the pit as a holocaust. He is told to sweeten the oÔ¨Äering with a libation of honey, then to retreat from the site without looking back, even if he hears the sound of footsteps or barking dogs.[23] All these elements betoken the rites owed to a chthonic deity.\n\nTriple Hecate and the Charites, Attic, 3rd century BCE (Glyptothek, Munich)\n\nThe 2nd-century travel writer Pausanias stated that Hecate was Ô¨Årst depicted in triplicate by the sculptor Alkamenes in the Greek Classical period of the late 5th century BCE [3] which was placed before the temple of the Wingless Nike in Athens. Greek anthropomorphic conventions of art resisted representing her with three faces: a votive sculpture from Attica of the 3rd century BCE (illustration, left), shows three single images against a column; round the column of Hecate dance the\n\n7.3 Mythology Hecate has been characterized as a pre-Olympian chthonic goddess. She appears in the Homeric Hymn to Demeter and in Hesiod's Theogony, where she is promoted strongly as a great goddess. The place of origin of her following is uncertain, but it is thought that she had popular followings in Thrace.[24] Her most important sanctuary was Lagina, a theocratic city-state in which the goddess was served by eunuchs.[24] Lagina, where the famous temple of Hecate drew great festal assemblies every year, lay close to the originally Macedonian colony\n\n16\n\nCHAPTER 7. HECATE\n\nof Stratonikeia, where she was the city‚Äôs patroness.[25] In According to Hesiod, she held sway over many things: Thrace she played a role similar to that of lesser-Hermes, namely a governess of liminal regions (particularly gates) and the wilderness. Whom she will she greatly aids and advances: she sits by worshipful kings in judgement, and in the assembly whom she will is distinguished among the people. And when men arm themselves for the battle that destroys men, then the goddess is at hand to give victory and grant glory readily to whom she will. Good is she also when men contend at the games, for there too the goddess is with them and proÔ¨Åts them: and he who by might and strength gets the victory wins the rich prize easily with joy, and brings glory to his parents. And she is good to stand by horsemen, whom she will: and to those whose business is in the grey discomfortable sea, and who pray to Hecate and the loudcrashing Earth-Shaker, easily the glorious goddess gives great catch, and easily she takes it away as soon as seen, if so she will. She is good in the byre with Hermes to increase the stock. The droves of kine and wide herds of goats and Ô¨Çocks of Ô¨Çeecy sheep, if she will, she increases from a few, or makes many to be less. So, then, albeit her mother‚Äôs only child, she is honored amongst all the deathless gods. And the son of Cronos made her a nurse of the young who after that day saw with their eyes the light of all-seeing Dawn. So from the beginning she is a nurse of the young, and these Hecate, Greek goddess of the crossroads; drawing by St√©phane are her honours.[26] Mallarm√© in Les Dieux Antiques, nouvelle mythologie illustr√©e in Paris, 1880\n\nHesiod emphasizes that Hecate was an only child, the daughter of Perses and Asteria, a star-goddess who was The Ô¨Årst literature mentioning Hecate is the Theogony by the sister of Leto (the mother of Artemis and Apollo). Hesiod: Grandmother of the three cousins was Phoebe the ancient Titaness who personiÔ¨Åed the moon. Hecate whom Zeus the son of Cronos honored above all. He gave her splendid gifts, to have a share of the earth and the unfruitful sea. She received honor also in starry heaven, and is honored exceedingly by the deathless gods. For to this day, whenever any one of men on earth oÔ¨Äers rich sacriÔ¨Åces and prays for favor according to custom, he calls upon Hecate. Great honor comes full easily to him whose prayers the goddess receives favorably, and she bestows wealth upon him; for the power surely is with her. For as many as were born of Earth and Ocean amongst all these she has her due portion. The son of Cronos did her no wrong nor took anything away of all that was her portion among the former Titan gods: but she holds, as the division was at the Ô¨Årst from the beginning, privilege both in earth, and in heaven, and in sea.[26]\n\nHesiod‚Äôs inclusion and praise of Hecate in the Theogony has been troublesome for scholars, in that he seems to hold her in high regard, while the testimony of other writers, and surviving evidence, suggests that this may have been exceptional. One theory is that Hesiod's original village had a substantial Hecate following and that his inclusion of her in the Theogony was a way of adding to her prestige by spreading word of her among his readers.[27] Another theory is that Hekate was mainly a household god and humble household worship could have been more pervasive and yet not mentioned as much as temple worship.[28] In Athens Hecate, along with Zeus, Hermes, Hestia, and Apollo, were very important in daily life as they were the main gods of the household.[29] However, it is clear that the special position given to Hecate by Zeus is upheld throughout her history by depictions found on coins depicting Hecate on the hand of Zeus [30] as highlighted in more recent research presented by d'Este and Rankine.[31]\n\n7.3. MYTHOLOGY Hecate possibly originated among the Carians of Anatolia,[24] the region where most theophoric names invoking Hecate, such as Hecataeus or Hecatomnus, the father of Mausolus, are attested,[32] and where Hecate remained a Great Goddess into historical times, at her unrivalled[33] cult site in Lagina. While many researchers favor the idea that she has Anatolian origins, it has been argued that ‚ÄúHecate must have been a Greek goddess.‚Äù[34] The monuments to Hecate in Phrygia and Caria are numerous but of late date.[35]\n\n17 the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, where the priests, megabyzi, oÔ¨Éciated.[36] Hecate also came to be associated with ghosts, infernal spirits, the dead and sorcery. Shrines to Hecate were placed at doorways to both homes and cities with the belief that it would protect from restless dead and other spirits. Likewise, shrines to Hecate at three way crossroads were created where food oÔ¨Äerings were left at the new moon to protect those who did so from spirits and other evils.[37] One interesting passage exists suggesting that the word ‚Äújinx‚Äù might have originated in a cult object associated with Hecate. ‚ÄúThe Byzantine polymath Michael Psellus [...] speaks of a bullroarer, consisting of a golden sphere, decorated throughout with symbols and whirled on an oxhide thong. He adds that such an instrument is called a iunx (hence ‚Äújinx‚Äù), but as for the signiÔ¨Åcance says only that it is ineÔ¨Äable and that the ritual is sacred to Hecate.‚Äù[38] Hecate is the primary feminine Ô¨Ågure in the Chaldean Oracles (2nd-3rd century CE),[39] where she is associated in fragment 194 with a strophalos (usually translated as a spinning top, or wheel, used in magic) ‚ÄúLabour thou around the Strophalos of Hecate.‚Äù[40] This appears to refer to a variant of the device mentioned by Psellus.[41] Variations in interpretations of Hecate‚Äôs role or roles can be traced in 5th-century Athens. In two fragments of Aeschylus she appears as a great goddess. In Sophocles and Euripides she is characterized as the mistress of witchcraft and the Keres.\n\nHecate by Richard Cosway\n\nIf Hecate‚Äôs cult spread from Anatolia into Greece, it is possible it presented a conÔ¨Çict, as her role was already Ô¨Ålled by other more prominent deities in the Greek pantheon, above all by Artemis and Selene. This line of reasoning lies behind the widely accepted hypothesis that she was a foreign deity who was incorporated into the Greek pantheon. Other than in the Theogony, the Greek sources do not oÔ¨Äer a consistent story of her parentage, or of her relations in the Greek pantheon: sometimes Hecate is related as a Titaness, and a mighty helper and protector of humans. Her continued presence was explained by asserting that, because she was the only Titan who aided Zeus in the battle of gods and Titans, she was not banished into the underworld realms after their defeat by the Olympians. One surviving group of stories suggests how Hecate might have come to be incorporated into the Greek pantheon without aÔ¨Äecting the privileged position of Artemis.[27] Here, Hecate is a mortal priestess often associated with Iphigeneia. She scorns and insults Artemis, who in retribution eventually brings about the mortal‚Äôs suicide. There was an area sacred to Hecate in the precincts of\n\nIn the Homeric Hymn to Demeter, Hecate is called the ‚Äútender-hearted‚Äù, a euphemism perhaps intended to emphasize her concern with the disappearance of Persephone, when she assisted Demeter with her search for Persephone following her abduction by Hades, suggesting that Demeter should speak to the god of the sun, Helios. Subsequently she became Persephone‚Äôs companion on her yearly journey to and from the realms of Hades. Because of this association, Hecate was one of the chief goddesses of the Eleusinian Mysteries, alongside Demeter and Persephone.[1] The modern understanding of Hecate has been strongly inÔ¨Çuenced by syncretic Hellenistic interpretations. Many of the attributes she was assigned in this period appear to have an older basis. For example, in the magical papyri of Ptolemaic Egypt, she is called the 'she-dog' or 'bitch', and her presence is signiÔ¨Åed by the barking of dogs. In late imagery she also has two ghostly dogs as servants by her side. However, her association with dogs predates the conquests of Alexander the Great and the emergence of the Hellenistic world. When Philip II laid siege to Byzantium she had already been associated with dogs for some time; the light in the sky and the barking of dogs that warned the citizens of a night time attack, saving the city, were attributed to Hecate Lampadephoros (the tale is preserved in the Suda). In gratitude the Byzantines erected\n\n18\n\nCHAPTER 7. HECATE\n\na statue in her honor.[42]\n\n‚Ä¢ Soteira (savior)[51]\n\nAs a virgin goddess, she remained unmarried and had no regular consort, though some traditions named her as the mother of Scylla.[43]\n\n‚Ä¢ Trimorphe (three-formed)[48] ‚Ä¢ Triodia/Trioditis (who frequents crossroads)[48] ‚Ä¢ Trivia (Roman form)\n\n7.4.1 Goddess of the crossroads Cult images and altars of Hecate in her triplicate or trimorphic form were placed at three-way crossroads (though they also appeared before private homes and in front of city gates).[9] In this form she came to be known as the goddess Trivia ‚Äúthe three ways‚Äù in Roman mythology. In what appears to be a 7th-century indication of the survival of cult practices of this general sort, Saint Eligius, in his Sermo warns the sick among his recently converted Ô¨Çock in Flanders against putting ‚Äúdevilish charms at springs or trees or crossroads‚Äù,[52] and, according to Saint Ouen would urge them ‚ÄúNo Christian should make or render any devotion to the deities of the trivium, where three roads meet...‚Äù.[53]\n\n7.5 Animals\n\nTriple Hecate\n\nAlthough associated with other moon goddesses such as Selene, she ruled over three kingdoms; the earth, the sea, and the sky. She had the power to create or hold back storms, which inÔ¨Çuenced her patronage of shepherds and sailors.[44]\n\n7.4 Other names and epithets ‚Ä¢ Apotropaia (that turns away/protects)\n\n[45]\n\n‚Ä¢ Chthonia (of the earth/underworld)[46] ‚Ä¢ Enodia (on the way)[47] ‚Ä¢ Kl√™idouchos (holding the keys)[48] ‚Ä¢ Kourotrophos (nurse of children)[48] ‚Ä¢ Melinoe[49] ‚Ä¢ Phosphoros (bringing or giving light)[48] ‚Ä¢ Propolos (who serves/attends)[48] ‚Ä¢ Propulaia/Propylaia (before the gate)[50]\n\nThe Triple Hecate, 1795 William Blake\n\nDogs were closely associated with Hecate in the Classical world. ‚ÄúIn art and in literature Hecate is constantly represented as dog-shaped or as accompanied by a dog. Her approach was heralded by the howling of a dog. The dog was Hecate‚Äôs regular sacriÔ¨Åcial animal, and was often eaten in solemn sacrament.‚Äù[54] The sacriÔ¨Åce of dogs to Hecate is attested for Thrace, Samothrace, Colophon, and Athens.[9] It has been claimed that her association with dogs is ‚Äúsuggestive of her connection with birth, for the dog was sacred to Eileithyia, Genetyllis, and other birth goddesses. Although in later times Hecate‚Äôs dog came to be thought of as a manifestation of restless souls or demons who\n\n7.6. PLANTS\n\n19 Aelian told a diÔ¨Äerent story of a woman transformed into a polecat: \"\"I have heard that the polecat was once a human being. It has also reached my hearing that Gale was her name then; that she was a dealer in spells and a sorceress (Pharmakis); that she was extremely incontinent, and that she was aÔ¨Ñicted with abnormal sexual desires. Nor has it escaped my notice that the anger of the goddess Hekate transformed it into this evil creature. May the goddess be gracious to me : fables and their telling I leave to others.‚Äù[58]\n\nA goddess, probably Hekate or else Artemis, is depicted with a bow, dog and twin torches.\n\naccompanied her, its docile appearance and its accompaniment of a Hecate who looks completely friendly in many pieces of ancient art suggests that its original signiÔ¨Åcation was positive and thus likelier to have arisen from the dog‚Äôs connection with birth than the dog‚Äôs underworld associations.‚Äù[55] The association with dogs, particularly female dogs, could be explained by a metamorphosis myth. The friendly looking female dog accompanying Hecate was originally the Trojan Queen Hekabe, who leapt into the sea after the fall of Troy and was transformed by Hecate into her familiar.[56] Another metamorphosis myth explains why the polecat is also associated with Hecate. From Antoninus Liberalis: ‚ÄúAt Thebes Proitos had a daughter Galinthias. This maiden was playmate and companion of Alkmene, daughter of Elektryon. As the birth throes for Herakles were pressing on Alkmene, the Moirai (Fates) and Eileithyia (Birth-Goddess), as a favour to Hera, kept Alkmene in continuous birth pangs. They remained seated, each keeping their arms crossed. Galinthias, fearing that the pains of her labour would drive Alkmene mad, ran to the Moirai and Eleithyia and announced that by desire of Zeus a boy had been born to Alkmene and that their prerogatives had been abolished. At all this, consternation of course overcame the Moirai and they immediately let go their arms. Alkmene‚Äôs pangs ceased at once and Herakles was born. The Moirai were aggrieved at this and took away the womanly parts of Galinthias since, being but a mortal, she had deceived the gods. They turned her into a deceitful weasel (or polecat), making her live in crannies and gave her a grotesque way of mating. She is mounted through the ears and gives birth by bringing forth her young through the throat. Hekate felt sorry for this transformation of her appearance and appointed her a sacred servant of herself.‚Äù[57]\n\nAthenaeus (writing in the 1st or 2nd century BCE, and drawing on the etymological speculation of Apollodorus of Athens) notes that the red mullet is sacred to Hecate, ‚Äúon account of the resemblance of their names; for that the goddess is trimorphos, of a triple form‚Äù. The Greek word for mullet was trigle and later trigla. He goes on to quote a fragment of verse ‚ÄúO mistress Hecate, Trioditis / With three forms and three faces / Propitiated with mullets‚Äù.[59] In relation to Greek concepts of pollution, Parker observes, ‚ÄúThe Ô¨Åsh that was most commonly banned was the red mullet (trigle), which Ô¨Åts neatly into the pattern. It 'delighted in polluted things,' and 'would eat the corpse of a Ô¨Åsh or a man'. Blood-coloured itself, it was sacred to the blood-eating goddess Hecate. It seems a symbolic summation of all the negative characteristics of the creatures of the deep.‚Äù[60] At Athens, it is said there stood a statue of Hecate Triglathena, to whom the red mullet was oÔ¨Äered in sacriÔ¨Åce.[61] After mentioning that this Ô¨Åsh was sacred to Hecate, Alan Davidson writes, ‚ÄúCicero, Horace, Juvenal, Martial, Pliny, Seneca and Suetonius have left abundant and interesting testimony to the red mullet fever which began to aÔ¨Äect wealthy Romans during the last years of the Republic and really gripped them in the early Empire. The main symptoms were a preoccupation with size, the consequent rise to absurd heights of the prices of large specimens, a habit of keeping red mullet in captivity, and the enjoyment of the highly specialized aesthetic experience induced by watching the color of the dying Ô¨Åsh change.‚Äù [62] The frog, signiÔ¨Åcantly a creature that can cross between two elements, also has become sacred to Hecate in modern Pagan literature.[63] In her three-headed representations, discussed above, Hecate often has one or more animal heads, including cow, dog, boar, serpent and horse.[64]\n\n7.6 Plants Hecate was closely associated with plant lore and the concoction of medicines and poisons. In particular she was thought to give instruction in these closely related arts. Apollonius of Rhodes, in the Argonautica mentions that Medea was taught by Hecate, ‚ÄúI have mentioned to you before a certain young girl whom Hecate, daughter of Perses, has taught to work in drugs.‚Äù[65]\n\n20\n\nCHAPTER 7. HECATE\n\nThe goddess is described as wearing oak in fragments of Sophocles‚Äô lost play The Root Diggers (or The Root Cutters), and an ancient commentary on Apollonius of Rhodes‚Äô Argonautica (3.1214) describes her as having a head surrounded by serpents, twining through branches of oak.[66]\n\nwhich she stood guard and to protect the individual as she or he passed through dangerous liminal places, Hecate would naturally become known as a goddess who could also refuse to avert the demons, or even drive them on against unfortunate individuals.[74]\n\nThe yew in particular was sacred to Hecate. ‚ÄúGreeks held the yew to be sacred to Hecate... Her attendants draped wreathes of yew around the necks of black bulls which they slaughtered in her honor and yew boughs were burned on funeral pyres. The yew was associated with the alphabet and the scientiÔ¨Åc name for yew today, taxus, was probably derived from the Greek word for yew, toxos, which is hauntingly similar to toxon, their word for bow and toxicon, their word for poison. It is presumed that the latter were named after the tree because of its superiority for both bows and poison.‚Äù[67] Hecate was said to favor oÔ¨Äerings of garlic, which was closely associated with her cult.[68] She is also sometimes associated with cypress, a tree symbolic of death and the underworld, and hence sacred to a number of chthonic deities.[69] A number of other plants (often poisonous, medicinal and/or psychoactive) are associated with Hecate.[70] These include aconite (also called hecateis),[71] belladonna, dittany, and mandrake. It has been suggested that the use of dogs for digging up mandrake is further corroboration of the association of this plant with Hecate; indeed, since at least as early as the 1st century CE, there are a number of attestations to the apparently widespread practice of using dogs to dig up plants associated with magic.[72]\n\n7.7 Places Hecate was associated with borders, city walls, doorways, crossroads and, by extension, with realms outside or beyond the world of the living. She appears to have been particularly associated with being 'between' and hence is frequently characterized as a \"liminal\" goddess. ‚ÄúHecate mediated between regimes ‚Äî Olympian and Titan ‚Äî, but also between mortal and divine spheres.‚Äù[73] This liminal role is reÔ¨Çected in a number of her cult titles: Apotropaia (that turns away/protects); Enodia (on the way); Propulaia/Propylaia (before the gate); Triodia/Trioditis (who frequents crossroads); Kl√™idouchos (holding the keys), etc. As a goddess expected to avert harmful or destructive spirits from the house or city over\n\nIt was probably her role as guardian of entrances that led to Hecate‚Äôs identiÔ¨Åcation by the mid Ô¨Åfth century with Enodia, a Thessalian goddess. Enodia‚Äôs very name (‚ÄúIn-the-Road‚Äù) suggests that she watched over entrances, for it expresses both the possibility that she stood on the main road into a city, keeping an eye on all who entered, and in the road in front of private houses, protecting their inhabitants.[75] This function would appear to have some relationship with the iconographic association of Hecate with keys, and might also relate to her appearance with two torches, which when positioned on either side of a gate or door illuminated the immediate area and allowed visitors to be identiÔ¨Åed. ‚ÄúIn Byzantium small temples in her honor were placed close to the gates of the city. Hecate‚Äôs importance to Byzantium was above all as a deity of protection. When Philip of Macedon was about to attack the city, according to the legend she alerted the townspeople with her ever present torches, and with her pack of dogs, which served as her constant companions.‚Äù[76] This suggests that Hecate‚Äôs close association with dogs derived in part from the use of watchdogs, who, particularly at night, raised an alarm when intruders approached. Watchdogs were used extensively by Greeks and Romans.[77] Like Hecate, \"[t]he dog is a creature of the threshold, the guardian of doors and portals, and so it is appropriately associated with the frontier between life and death, and with demons and ghosts which move across the frontier. The yawning gates of Hades were guarded by the monstrous watchdog Cerberus, whose function was to prevent the living from entering the underworld, and the dead from leaving it.‚Äù[78]\n\n7.8 Festivals Hecate was worshipped by both the Greeks and the Romans who had their own festivals dedicated to her.\n\n7.8.1 The Deipnon The Athenian Greeks honored Hekate during the Deipnon. In Greek, deipnon means the evening meal, usually the largest meal of the day. Hekate‚Äôs Deipnon is, at its most basic, a meal served to Hekate and the restless dead once a lunar month on the night when there is no visible moon, usually noted on modern calendars as the\n\n7.10. SURVIVAL IN PRE-MODERN FOLKLORE\n\n21\n\nnew moon.[79] The Deipnon is always followed the next day by the Noumenia,[80] when the Ô¨Årst sliver of moon is visible, and then the Agathos Diamon the day after that.\n\n7.10 Survival in pre-modern folklore\n\nThe main purpose of the Deipnon was to honor Hekate and to placate the souls in her wake who ‚Äúlonged for vengeance.‚Äù[81] A secondary purpose was to purify the household and to atone for bad deeds a household member may have committed that oÔ¨Äended Hekate, causing her to withhold her favor from them. The Deipnon consists of three main parts: 1) the meal that was set out at a crossroads, usually in a shrine outside the entryway to the home [82] 2) an expiation sacriÔ¨Åce,[83] and 3) puriÔ¨Åcation of the household.[84]\n\nStrmiska notes that Hecate, conÔ¨Çated with the Ô¨Ågure of Diana, appears in late antiquity and in the early medieval period as part of an ‚Äúemerging legend complex‚Äù associated with gatherings of women, the moon, and witchcraft that eventually became established ‚Äúin the area of Northern Italy, southern Germany, and the western Balkans.‚Äù[93] This theory of the Roman origins of many European folk traditions related to Diana or Hecate was explicitly advanced at least as early as 1807[94] and is reÔ¨Çected in numerous etymological claims by lexicographers from the 17th to the 19th century, deriving ‚Äúhag‚Äù and/or ‚Äúhex‚Äù from Hecate by way of haegtesse (AngloSaxon) and hagazussa (Old High German).[95] Such derivations are today proposed only by a minority[96] since being refuted by Grimm, who was skeptical of theories proposing non-Germanic origins for German folklore traditions.[97]\n\nModern etymology reconstructs Proto-Germanic *hagatusjon- from haegtesse and hagazussa;[98] the Ô¨Årst element is probably cognate with hedge, which derives from PIE *kagh- ‚Äúhedge, enclosure‚Äù,[99] and the second Hecate is now Ô¨Årmly established as a Ô¨Ågure in perhaps from *dhewes- ‚ÄúÔ¨Çy about, be smoke, vanish.‚Äù[98] Neopaganism,[85] which draws heavily on folkloric traditions[86] associating Hecate with 'The Wild Hunt',[87] witches, hedges and 'hedge-riding',[88] and other themes 7.11 Cross-cultural parallels that parallel, but are not explicitly attested in, Classical sources. The Ô¨Ågure of Hecate can often be associated with the Ô¨ÅgShe is worshiped by people who have reconstructed and ure of Isis in Egyptian myth. Lucius Apuleius (c. 123 ‚Äî revived the indigenous polytheist religion of Greece, c. 170 CE) in his work The Golden Ass associates Hecate Hellenismos, such as groups like Hellenion and YSEE.[89] with Isis:\n\n7.9 Modern expressions\n\nHecate is mentioned in Act 2, Scene 1 by the character Macbeth, known as the 'Dagger' soliloquy, in William Shakespeare's play of the same name: ‚ÄúWitchcraft celebrates pale Hecate‚Äôs oÔ¨Äerings...‚Äù.[90] Hecate is also one of the ‚Äúpatron‚Äù goddesses of many Wiccans, who in some traditions identify her with the Triple Goddess‚Äô aspect of the \"Crone\". In other circles Wiccan witches associate her with the ‚ÄúMaiden‚Äù, or the ‚ÄúMother‚Äù aspects as well, for Hecate has three faces, or phases. Her role as a tripartite goddess, which many modern-day Wiccans associate with the concept of ‚Äúthe Maiden, the Mother and the Crone‚Äù,[91] was made popular in modern times by writers such as Robert Graves in The White Goddess, and many others, such as the 20th century occultist and author, Aleister Crowley. Historical depictions and descriptions show her facing in three diÔ¨Äerent directions, a clear and precise reference to the tripartite nature of this ancient Goddess; the later Greek Magical Papyri sometimes refer to her as also having the heads of animals, and this can be seen as a reference to her aspect of Motherhood; in this portrayal she is known as ‚ÄúMistress of Animals‚Äù. Modern Hellenic polytheists honor Hecate during the Deipnon.[92]\n\n'I am she that is the natural mother of all things, mistress and governess of all the elements, the initial progeny of worlds, chief of powers divine, Queen of heaven, the principal of the Gods celestial, the light of the goddesses: at my will the planets of the air, the wholesome winds of the Seas, and the silences of hell be disposed; my name, my divinity is adored throughout all the world in divers manners, in variable customs and in many names, [...] Some call me Juno, others Bellona of the Battles, and still others Hecate. Principally the Ethiopians which dwell in the Orient, and the Egyptians which are excellent in all kind of ancient doctrine, and by their proper ceremonies accustomed to worship me, do call me Queen Isis.[...]'[100] In the syncretism during Late Antiquity of Hellenistic and late Babylonian (\"Chaldean\") elements, Hecate was identiÔ¨Åed with Ereshkigal, the underworld counterpart of Inanna in the Babylonian cosmography. In the Michigan\n\n22\n\nCHAPTER 7. HECATE mentioned, were oÔ¨Äered to Hecate at crossroads, which were sacred to the goddess.[104]\n\n7.12 Nature of her cult Regarding the nature of her cult, it has been remarked, ‚Äúshe is more at home on the fringes than in the center of Greek polytheism. Intrinsically ambivalent and polymorphous, she straddles conventional boundaries and eludes deÔ¨Ånition.‚Äù[9]\n\n7.13 See also ‚Ä¢ Asura (Buddhism) ‚Ä¢ Janus ‚Ä¢ Amphisbaena ‚Ä¢ Lampade\n\n7.14 Notes\n\nIsis and her various other names and symbols from The Golden Ass.\n\nmagical papyrus (inv. 7), dated to the late 3rd or early 4th century CE, Hecate Ereschigal is invoked against fear of punishment in the afterlife.[101] Before she became associated with Greek mythology, she had many similarities with Artemis (wilderness, and watching over wedding ceremonies)[102] Dogs were sacred to Hecate and associated with roads, domestic spaces, puriÔ¨Åcation, and spirits of the dead. They played a similar symbolic role in ancient China, where dogs were conceived as representative of the household sphere, and as protective spirits appropriate when transcending geographic and spatial boundaries. Dogs were also sacriÔ¨Åced to the road. As Roel Sterckx observes, ‚ÄúThe use of dog sacriÔ¨Åces at the gates and doors of the living and the dead as well as its use in travel sacriÔ¨Åces suggest that dogs were perceived as daemonic animals operating in the liminal or transitory realm between the domestic and the unknown, danger-stricken outside world‚Äù.[103] This can be compared to Pausanias‚Äô report that in the Ionaian city of Colophon in Asia Minor a sacriÔ¨Åce of a black female puppy was made to Hecate as ‚Äúthe wayside goddess‚Äù, and Plutarch‚Äôs observation that in Boeotia dogs were killed in puriÔ¨Åcatory rites.
