        "text": "Hypnus\n\nUnlike some of the more fearsome gods, Hypnus was a gentle figure. Often depicted as a winged youth, he personified the peacefulness of slumber. His presence brought a temporary escape from the worries of the world, a much-needed solace for gods and mortals alike.\n\nResidence: The Underworld\n\nSymbols: Poppy\n\nParents: Nyx and Erebus\n\nConsort: Pasithea\n\nSiblings: Thanatus, Nemesis, Eris, Keres, Apate, the Moirae, Oizys\n\nChildren: Oneiroi\n\nRoman equivalent: Somnus\n\nHypnus, the embodiment of sleep, resided in Erebus, a realm of perpetual darkness nestled beyond the gates of sunrise. Each night, he would rise with his mother, Nyx, the goddess of night, and ascend into the sky, his presence blanketing the world in slumber. Hypnos wasn’t alone in his nightly task – he was often accompanied by his twin brother, Thanatus, the personification of peaceful death.\n\nArt"
