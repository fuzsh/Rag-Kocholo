        "text": "How are Eros (Love), Pothos (Longing), Himeros (Desire), Hypnos (Sleep), Dream and Death? And what about Envy, Evil, Slander, human passions and emotions personified? How about heavenly bodies (stars and planets), continents, islands, mountains and rivers? But also institutions, cities, fairness and unfairness, Justice and Injustice?\n\nPersonified concepts and meanings with human or animal form and allegorical stories, all placed together and becoming visible in the Acropolis Museum's exhibition titled NoHMATA ‘Meanings’. Personifications and Allegories from Antiquity to Today.\n\nThis exhibition forms a unique Tetralogy, where the greek word NoΗΜΑ (meaning) becomes a NΗMA (thread), and includes various artworks – statues, reliefs and vases, coins, jewellery and icons, paintings, uniting for the first time Antiquity with Byzantium, with Renaissance and Modern Art. A mix of artworks in marble, clay, metal, canvas and colour, most of which are travelling for the first time and come together to delight and inspire, to puzzle and to make you think. Among the artworks that will be presented is the painting of Rubens from the Museo del Prado showing Cronos, the personification of Time, devouring his children, the personified Painting of Bourdon from a private Collection in Rome, the bronze statuette of Hypnos from the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, the famous Nike Sandalbinder from the Acropolis Museum, a vase by the Meidias Painter from the British Museum, the mosaics of Sea and Ocean from the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki, the Allegory of Divine Ascension from the Byzantine & Christian Museum of Athens, the sculpture of Eros and Psyche from the Musei Capitolini in Rome, the Seasons from the National Archaeological Museum, alongside the Seasons of Yannis Tsarouchis from a private Athenian Collection, the Allegory of Slander by Botticelli and his botega, etc.\n\nTime, Nature, Deities, Man & Human Nature, Institutions and Allegories, are uniquely interwoven in the exhibition sections, leading to the final part of the exhibition with the bronze Chimera from 400 B.C., from the Archaeological Museum of Florence. An exhibition, a Chimera, like all things human.\n\nCuration: Professor Nikolaos Chr. Stampolidis and his associates at the Acropolis Museum.\n\nEXHIBITION SECTIONS\n\nTIME\n\nIn truth at first Chaos came to be... From Chaos came forth Erebus and black Night; but of Night were born Aether and Day...\n\nHesiod, Theogony 116, 124-125 [Transl. by Hugh G. Evelyn-White]\n\nThe first Unit of the Exhibition presents Time, the way it is divided and set in periods. Time was given by Chaos during the creation of the universe, as a “necklace of Harmony”, a jewel to the world as the philosophical mind perceives it. This Unit presents the Allegory of Time, the Seasons, the Months, the rosy-fingered Eos (the first morning light of Dawn), Selene (Moon) and the starry Night.\n\nNATURE\n\nAnd Earth first bore starry Heaven, equal to herself… And she brought forth long hills…But afterwards she lay with Heaven and bore deep-swirling Oceanus...\n\nHesiod, Theogony 126-133 [Transl. by Hugh G. Evelyn-White]\n\nThe Exhibition’s second Unit commences with celestial bodies, dominant powers governing humans, such as Helios (Sun), Selene (Moon) and Aphrodite (Evening star). These bodies take up, early on, a human form; they are personified and consequently deified. Moving on from the celestial bodies and their personifications on earth, a series of allegories and personifications of the Four Elements of Nature appear; Air with the North and North-West Wind; Water with the personifications of the Ocean, the Sea and Rivers and lastly, Earth with the Mountains, Continents, Countries and Islands.\n\nDEITIES\n\nAnd with her [Aphrodite] went Eros, and comely Himeros (Desire) followed her at her birth at the first and as she went into the assembly of the gods. This honor she has from the beginning, and this is the portion allotted to her amongst men and undying gods, the whisperings of maidens and smiles and deceits with sweet delight and love and graciousness.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 200-206 [Transl. by Hugh G. Evelyn-White]\n\nThis Unit both in characterisation and selection of the exhibited figures contains a series of conceptual meanings, which were personified and deified early on, and thus received worship in antiquity. Moreover, with the passing of time they were unified with other deities, claimed their attributes and created complex and intriguing combinations. The deified concepts of this Unit begin with Nike (Victory), Eris (Discord), Tyche (Fortune), Hygieia (Health), Ploutos (Wealth) and end with Aphrodite’s “children”, Eros, Himeros (Desire) and Pothos, meaning carnal love, sexual attraction and other related notions, such as Peitho (Persuasion).\n\nHUMAN & HUMAN NATURE\n\nAfter [she bore] Deceit and Friendship and hateful Age and hard-hearted Strife. But abhorred Strife bore painful Toil and Forgetfulness and Famine and tearful Sorrows, Fightings also, Battles, Murders, Manslaughters, Quarrels, Lying Words, Disputes...\n\nHesiod, Theogony 224-229 [Transl. by Hugh G. Evelyn-White]\n\nThe fourth Unit showcases personified concepts that relate to Human and Human Nature. The personifications presented here are but a small sample of the perishable nature, of the virtues and shortcomings of humans: Geras (Old Age), Hypnos (Sleep) and Thanatos (Death), Phyche (Soul), Arete (Virtue) and Eugeneia (Politeness), Arete (Virtue) and Kakia (Vice), Human Passions, Sloth, Envy, Deceit, Frenzy, Mania, Madness, Pain, Good Fortune, Pleasure, Memory, Epic Poems, Satire, Comedy and the Arts...\n\nINSTITUTIONS\n\nAlso deadly Night bore Nemesis （Indignation） to afflict mortal men…Lawlessness and Ruin, all of one nature...\n\nHesiod, Theogony 223-224, 23 [Transl. by Hugh G. Evelyn-White]\n\nThe fifth Unit of Institutions has as centre of attention personifications and allegories of communal and not of individual human activities, meaning the activities of organised societies that have homogeneity and unity, in other words have a public, social, political and civic character. Themis, Justice, Dike and Injustice, Eunomia (Order), Hybris and Punishment, Nemesis. And also City, Demos, Senate, Gerousia, Processions and Ceremony compose a small panorama of the institutions governing human societies.\n\nALLEGORIES\n\n...ὁ γὰρ ἄλλα μὲν ἀγορεύων τρόπος, ἕτερα δὲὧν λέγει σημαίνων, ἐπωνύμως ἀλληγορία καλεῖται...\n\nThe same word, when used with its real sense, cannot give away its meaning. Because the way of talking about one thing, while implying something different from what is spoken, is rightly called an allegory.\n\nHeraclitus, Homeric Problems 5.2\n\nThe last (6th) Unit presents various artworks with, usually, mix references that include personifications, attributes, symbolisms, metaphors and allegories. Allegory aims to provide an explanatory image of a concept or idea in order to make it understandable to the general public. Overcoming the primary notion of the image, an allegory seeks the hidden, deeper meaning. Its creator tries to visualise an abstract concept, always aspiring for an educational result. Therefore we can characterise it as a form of expression by which we strive and succeed in concealing the true meaning as much in written words as in the visual arts. One of the most educational allegories from antiquity and the Renaissance is the Calumny of Apelles.\n\nEPILOGUE\n\nShe [Echidna] was the mother of Chimaera who breathed raging fire, a creature fearful, great, swift footed and strong, who had three heads, one of a grim-eyed lion, another of a goat, and another of a snake, a fierce dragon; in her forepart she was a lion; in her hinderpart, a dragon; and in her middle, a goat, breathing forth a fearful blast of blazing fire.\n\nHesiod, Theogony 319-324 [Transl. by Hugh G. Evelyn-White]\n\nIn antiquity, the monster with the hybrid body comprised by miscellaneous animals seems to have been interpreted as an allegory of evil and destruction. In Plato’s Republic, Chimaira appears to receive a political notion, as she interrelates to tyranny, a degenerate example of government. She is similarly presented in Vergil’s Aeneid where the allegory refers to anarchy and chaos that result from civil wars.\n\nToday, the allegorical meaning of Chimaira signifies something out of fantasy, dream and utopia, as well as something unattainable. As an expression of self-irony this Exhibition could also be perceived as a chimera.\n\nThe statue of Chimaira (ca 400 BC) from the National Archaeological Museum of Florence will travel on 13 March 2024.\n\nPARTICIPATING MUSEUMS, EPHORATES OF ANTIQUITIES AND COLLECTIONS\n\nAustria\n\nWien, Kunsthistorisches Museum\n\nGreece\n\nMINISTRY OF CULTURE: Directorate of Archaeological Museums, Exhibitions and Educational Programmes\n\nAcropolis Museum\n\nArchaeological Museum of Thessaloniki\n\nBasil Papantoniou Foundation, Nafplion\n\nBenaki Museum\n\nByzantine and Christian Museum\n\nEphorate of Antiquity of Chalcidice and Mount Athos: Monastery of Iviron, Monastery of Vatopedi\n\nEphorate of Antiquities of the City of Athens: Museum of the Ancient Agora, Museum of Kerameikos\n\nEphorate of Antiquities of Corinth: Archaeological Museum of Ancient Corinth, Archaeological Museum of Sikyon\n\nEphorate of Antiquities of Dodecanese: Permanent Archaeological Exhibition in the Grand Master’s Palace\n\nEphorate of Antiquities of Ilia: Archaeological Museum of Elis\n\nEphorate of Antiquities of Kavala: Archaeological Museum of Philippi\n\nEphorate of Antiquities of Pieria: Archaeological Museum of Dion\n\nKIKPE Numismatic Collection / Social and Cultural Affairs Welfare Foundation\n\nNational Archaeological Museum\n\nNational Gallery - Alexandros Soutsos Museum\n\nPrivate Collections, Athens\n\nThe Alpha Bank Numismatic Collection\n\nItaly\n\nAquileia, Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Aquileia\n\nBari, Soprintendenza di Archeologia, Belle Arti e Paesaggio per la città metropolitana di Bari\n\nFirenze, Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Firenze\n\nFirenze, Museo degli Uffizi\n\nLipari, Museo Luigi Bernabò Brea\n\nMilano, Museo Poldi Pezzoli\n\nNapoli, Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Napoli\n\nPalermo, Museo Archeologico Regionale \"Antonino Salinas\"\n\nProvincia di Caserta, Museo Provinciale Campano\n\nRoma, Collezione Privata, O.
