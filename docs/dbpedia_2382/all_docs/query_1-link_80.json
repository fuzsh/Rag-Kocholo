        "text": "The 1881 Distillery, located in the grounds of Peebles Hydro Hotel in the Scottish Borders, is named after the year when the Hydropathic Spa first opened here, offering Therapeutic treatments using water from its own Shieldgreen Spring.\n\nThe Victorian Spa tragically burned down in 1905 but was rebuilt, and with an ethos for health and wellbeing, became a popular tennis destination. In the 1920s, Peebles Hydro had more tennis courts than Wimbledon and hosted tournaments and the Scottish Championships.\n\nIt was this tennis heritage when G & T was served on the lawn in the summer sunshine, which inspired the idea a few years ago to create a Gin distillery at the Resort. Built above the former swimming pool, the 1881 Distillery opened in October 2019.\n\nCharlie Leckie, Brand Manager, is a sixth generation member at the family hotel: “We’re proud of the heritage of Peebles Hydro which is embodied by the 1881 Gin, a blend of carefully chosen Scottish botanicals and distilled in the heart of the Borders.”\n\nWith the tagline, ‘Spring to Spirit,’ water is sourced from the local Shieldgreen spring which had traditionally been used for the Hydropathic Spa treatments. ‘Felicity’, the copper Still makes five distinctive gins – London Dry, Pavilion Pink, Honours, Rafters and Tiffin, each with their own logo and bottle illustration paying homage to the heritage of Peebles Hydro. Tonic 81 is also made at the Distillery, Premium, Light, Pink Grapefruit and Elderflower, the perfect mixer for each gin.\n\nHydro London Dry Gin (40% ABV)\n\nThe botanicals include juniper, bay, hawthorn berries, cardamom, cassia, birch bark, fir needles, grapefruit peel, grains of paradise, milk thistle – many grown in the Peebles Hydro gardens – then blended with the pure Spring water.\n\nDistillery notes:\n\nNose: Fresh, piney juniper and fir, with grapefruit citrus and aromatic cardamom.\n\nPalate: Hawthorn, birch and fir back up an initial wave of juniper, giving way to warming cassia and bay.\n\nFinish: A long, smooth, citric finish with bay leaf and subtle earthiness from our local botanicals.\n\nServe: a large measure with a wedge of pink grapefruit and a splash of premium tonic water.\n\nThe Hydro G&T is available RTD in a can, perfect from summer picnics to Christmas parties.\n\nThe Taste Test: If popping a cork of Champagne should sound like a maiden’s sigh, my ice-chilled can of G&T opens with a loud fizz, which I poured into a large glass over ice and slice. A subtle flavour at first with floral and earthy juniper notes but then an underlying aromatic ginger spice kicks in, which is sharp and refreshing.\n\n1881 Pavilion Peebles Pink Gin (40% ABV)\n\nThe 1881 Pavilion Pink Gin is a classic gin with the addition of wild Scottish red berries and a hint of floral hibiscus, named in honour of the hotel’s historical tennis pavilion.\n\nDistillery notes:\n\nNose: Silky red fruits, juniper, spice and citrus\n\nPalate: Fresh raspberry complemented by strawberry, hibiscus and gentle spice from cardamom and grains of paradise\n\nFinish: Creamy fruit fading to citrus, pine, red Berries\n\nServe: A few fresh raspberries, a sprig of mint, tonic and ice.\n\nThe 1881 Pavilion G&T is also available ready to drink in a can.\n\nThe Taste test: Floral, fruity and fragrantly perfumed with a honeyed sweetness. An ice cold summertime drink or served with dessert: raspberries / strawberries & cream, Eton Mess, Strawberry Pavlova, or Scones and jam for a decadent Afternoon tea.\n\nRafters Subtly Smoked Gin (40% abv)\n\nIn the Summer of 1905, a spark in the roof space caused a devastating fire at Peebles Hydro. But within a few years the hotel was thankfully restored with grand Edwardian architecture and art deco style. To commemorate the Phoenix rising from the ashes is Rafters Subtly Smoked Gin, with its stunning image depicting the hotel billowing with smoke.\n\nDistiller’s notes:\n\nNose: Subtle but distinct sweet oak smoke, followed by our signature profile of juniper, cardamom and grapefruit.\n\nPalate: Warming smoke and spice intermingle to create a savoury gin suitable for sipping or mixing. The palate develops into juniper freshness backed by citrus.\n\nFinish: A lengthy finish of warm citrus and wisps of smoke draw you back for another sip.\n\nServe: Sip neat, over ice, or in a G&T with a wedge of lime and a slice of chilli pepper.\n\nThe Taste test of pure, neat gin: The aroma of oak smoke followed by earthy juniper and citrus sweetness. Then the first taste – distinctive bonfire wood smoke and a blend of spices to create a savoury gin with a lingering juniper freshness. Warming cardamom, fruity citrus and delectable smokiness.\n\nWow! This has the X factor, utterly divine and one of the most delicious, dynamic, dramatic gins I have experienced.\n\nThe verdict from the Masters of Malt\n\nDistilled using a variety of gin botanicals including piney juniper and tart pink grapefruit. An undertone of smoke supports vibrant grapefruit citrus, a touch of cinnamon and a strong juniper finish. Best served over ice with a classic tonic to enjoy the complex, smoky spirit with a garnish of lime and ginger. Subtle hints of smoke on the palate make this a distinctive spirit which stands up particularly well in cocktails, including a Negroni.\n\n1881 Rafters Negroni\n\n50ml Rafters gin, 25ml sweet Rosso vermouth, 25ml Campari. Orange garnish.\n\nThe simplest of cocktails to make at home without the need of a shaker – just pour all these ingredients into a chunky Rocks glass with a large ice cube. Stir gently and add a wedge of orange. The bittersweet aroma of the Campari blends perfectly with the Rafters gin to make a delicious and very special smoky Negroni. The Count would certainly approve!.\n\n1881 Dry Gin Martini\n\n50 ml Rafters gin, 15 ml dry vermouth.\n\nAdd to a cocktail shaker with lots of ice and stir or shake gently. Pour into a cocktail glass or champagne saucer with a garnish of olive. The smokiness enhances the typical bone-dry punch of a Martini with such an elegant, smooth taste.\n\nAs we are heading into dark, chilly nights of winter, why not ring the changes of a Whisky hot toddy and add Rafter’s gin instead ?\n\nHot Gin Toddy\n\n300ml water, 1 ginger teabag, 2 cinnamon sticks, 4 cardamom pods, 4 whole cloves, 1 tablespoon clear honey, freshly squeezed orange juice, 100ml 1881 Rafters gin (serves 2)\n\nAdd the water, ginger teabag, cinnamon, cardamom pods and cloves to a saucepan and simmer for 5 minutes; stir in the honey and citrus juice and gently heat for few more minutes. Remove from the heat and add the gin. Strain off the spices, if preferred, or keep the cinammon stick to stir and pour into two large mugs, with an orange or lemon garnish. A winter warmer after a bracing walk in the snow.\n\n1881 Distillery news:\n\nThis festive season, the 1881 Distillery offers gift boxes of four gins in two sizes, 5cl and 20cl. – Hydro London Dry, Pavilion Pink, Rafters and Honours Navy-strength Gin.\n\n1881 Distillery won Silver award for Flavoured Gin of the Year at the recent Scottish Gin Awards 2021. Tiffin Gin incorporates light aromatic, warming spices to achieve its distinctive taste, with notes of cumin, cardamom, and kaffir lime.\n\nVisit the 1881 Distillery and Gin School\n\nThe 1881 Distillery at Peebles Hydro has the largest residential Gin school with a classroom of 26 mini-stills, offering a range of day and overnight Experiences to learn about distilling gin and craft your own spirit, Tours and tastings.\n\nFor more information on Peebles Hydro, 1881 distillery, on line shop and the Gin School:\n\n1881 Distillery,\n\nPeebles Hydro, Innerleithen Road, Peebles, EH45 8LX\n\ninfo@1881distillery.com\n\nwww.1881distillery.com\n\nwww.peebleshydro.co.uk\n\nThe Inn on the Mile\n\n82 High Street, Edinburgh\n\nEH1 1LL.\n\nhttp://www.theinnonthemile.co.uk\n\nOn the corner of North Bridge and the Royal Mile, you’re not likely to miss finding this Pub with its outdoor tables. Formerly the Bank Hotel, it’s had a makeover to create a brash, bold new Bar-Bistro, with nine deluxe bedrooms upstairs.\n\nThe decor blends traditional architectural features with modern urban style. Designer Jim Hamilton decided to open up the space exposing bare brickwork, wood and metal girders for an industrial look. Couchettes and cosy booths offer comfy seating to relax over speciality craft and cask beers, whiskies, wines alongside hearty gastropub food.\n\nThe cool and contemporary Inn on the Mile is the perfect new name for this Pub with Rooms. This is the latest addition to the collection of restaurants and hotels in the G1 group (including Murrayfield House, Grassmarket Hotel in Edinburgh, as well as Glasgow and Aberdeen).\n\nUpstairs to the bedrooms, each floor is decorated with Timorous Beasties’ iconic, handprinted wallpaper of buzzing bees and colourful thistles. Rooms are designed with individual flair, gorgeous roll top baths or power showers, luxury White Company toiletries and artistic touches. Homely essentials – tea/coffee, bar drinks, hair straighteners, Wifi, Sky TV.\n\nNo need to splash out the tartan, believed Hamilton – the décor is minimalist white and grey to create a fresh, smart modern space. Scottish heritage can be found outside around the Old Town. The aim for G1 property design is “striking the right balance between the building’s history and its modern function.”\n\nSo now down to the Bistro Bar for supper. We sat at a large booth with polished copper table top, and on this early evening the mood is warm and welcoming, busy and buzzing with locals and city visitors.\n\nThe Bar specialises in Scottish craft beers, whiskies and an ingenious selection of cockt-ales – where beer replaces the spirit in fruity alcoholic concoctions.\n\nNot sure what to order from the extensive drinks list, I chose a Beer Flight – three small glasses from a choice of six.\n\nI tasted Flying Scotsman, Bitter and Twisted and Schiehallion, all labelled and served on a wooden tray. What fun was this! No. 1, dark rich, hoppy, No. 2, sharp bitter at first with sweet aftertaste, No. 3, oaty, light, refreshing.\n\nKen selected an Innis & Gun Rum beer which was the colour of raspberries with a very distinctive flavour.\n\nThe food menu features everyone’s favourites – fish and chips, haggis (veggie haggis too) Caesar salad, burgers, steak pie, macaroni cheese, rump steak., soup and paninis. I selected 2 very fishy, softly cooked Smoked Haddock fishcakes served on a wooden board, with extra portion of fat chips. Ken very much enjoyed his Fish Supper, traditionally served in newspaper on a plate, so that you could eat with fingers or knife and fork.\n\nTwo generous portions of quality homely food, both simply delicious. No room for pudding, but those with a sweet tooth could choose apple pie, ice cream or fudge cake.\n\nRecent reviews from international visitors staying at the Inn:\n\n“Super friendly staff, amazing décor, funky, relaxed atmosphere, the food is hearty and filling. We would return in a heartbeat!”\n\n“Great location to stay for exploring Edinburgh. Will definitely be returning to The Inn On The Mile”.\n\nThe Caledonian Waldorf Astoria\n\nPrinces Street, Edinburgh, EH1 2AB\n\nt. 00 44 (0)131 222 8888\n\nwww.thecaledonianedinburgh.com\n\nLocation\n\nThere are several reasons why a visit to Edinburgh should be on your bucket list in the near future. At the recent World Travel Awards, from a short list of major cities including Venice, Florence, Paris and London, Scotland’s capital was named Europe’s leading destination.\n\nWhere to stay? The new look, revamped Caledonian hotel, a long time favourite of James Bond (aka Sean Connery), is now part of the world class, 5 star Hilton Waldorf-Astoria collection. Known locally as The Caley, the hotel has been a turreted redstone landmark at the West End of Princes Street since 1903, designed as a Grand Hotel to cater for increased tourism thanks to the Steam Railway.\n\nA little History\n\nThe Caledonian Railway company was established in 1845, first linking Carlisle to Glasgow and Edinburgh, then within three years providing the first through service from Scotland to London. This was a major achievement, as until then travellers would have to take a ship from Glasgow to Liverpool, then onwards by train to London. Now with the opening of the cross border mainline, passengers would be able to leave Edinburgh in the morning and dine in London the same day.\n\nThe Edinburgh terminus, Princes Street station was gradually developed during the 1890s to create a network of seven platforms handling 250 trains a day. Before the era of car or air travel, journeys by train ruled supreme across Britain. Tourism in Scotland was proving very popular thanks to Queen Victoria, for wild landscape, golf, shooting and fishing. The newly completed Forth Rail Bridge would soon allow train travel to the Highlands.\n\nThe directors of the Caledonian company were astute businessmen who were not content in just running a railway. They believed that once they had ‘the traveller in their pocket’ then they should aim to keep and look after visitors at the end of the journey. With this vision, several city-centre railway hotels were planned for Aberdeen, Inverness, Glasgow and most importantly Edinburgh.\n\nThis was major investment requiring serious finance but finally the doors opened on the magnificent, pink Permian sandstone Caledonian Hotel in December 1903. Built above and around the station concourse overlooking Edinburgh Castle, with 205 bedrooms, restaurants and ballroom, this marble-pillared Palace offered a taste of opulence from décor to hospitality. The hotel’s Telegraphic address was simply “Luxury Edinburgh”.\n\nDressed in gold brocade, the ornately painted Pompadour Restaurant (named after Louis XV’s mistress) opened in 1925, soon established as the most fashionable hotspot in town for dinner dances and haute cuisine.\n\nThroughout the 20th century, The Caley welcomed visiting stars of stage and screen: Charlie Chaplin, Bing Crosby, Gene Kelly, Elizabeth Taylor and Sean Connery; from Edinburgh Festival performers to members of Royal Families across the world.\n\nIn 1965 it was the end of an era with the closure of Princes Street Station after nearly a century. But this gave the opportunity to expand the hotel with a new wing of bedrooms built over former platforms. Hilton took over the management of the Caley in 2000, ensuring a fresh modern start in time for the centenary.\n\nThe Caley Today\n\nFast forward to Autumn 2012: the Caledonian is reborn once again after a £ 24 million restoration and glamorous design facelift. Now within the Waldorf Astoria brand, the Caledonian joins the elite collection of elegant hotels from New York to Paris.\n\nWelcomed by the doorman in tartan trews and top hat, enter the reception lobby with its crystal and amber chandelier, then through to the hallway with the sweeping transatlantic liner–style staircase.\n\nThe Art Deco heritage has been re-created with polished bronze, gold leaf, crafted rosewood with quirky Scottish motifs, thistle wallpaper and soft plaid tweed.\n\nWhat is simply fabulous is the artistic theme of travel which embraces the life and times of the old Railway Hotel with the nostalgic ambience of the 1920s/1930s. The old station clock now hangs in a magnificent, glass-roofed Atrium, Peacock Alley, the place to sit and be seen for morning coffee, Afternoon tea, champagne and cocktails. And of course, classic Waldorf Salad is included on the food menu. It was devised in 1896 by Oscar Tschirky, the Maitre d’ at the New York Waldorf, and celebrated by Cole Porter in his love song, You’re the Top.\n\nThe 241 bedrooms and lavish suites are imaginatively designed for supreme comfort and style: WA monogrammed linen, vintage photographs of train stations, faux crocodile-skin “luggage-trunk” cabinets, Ferragamo toiletries in spacious bathrooms.\n\nBars and Restaurants follow the enhancement to create a classy, refined lifestyle throughout the hotel. The Caley Bar has booths and armchairs to encourage a leisurely drink – a cool Martini or speciality 1903 cocktail (whisky, honey, orange twist) with popcorn and tortilla snacks on the side.\n\nDining at the Caledonian is now under the culinary care of the Galvin Brothers who run the Michelin-starred Windows at the London Hilton. Upstairs on the Entresol floor the Pompadour, decorated with flowers and exotic birds, is a sumptuous Parisian Belle Epoque-style restaurant.\n\nFirst an aperitif in the intimate salon next door as you study the gourmet French menus, such as Ravioli of Rabbit, Seared fillet of Angus Beef, Poached Turbot, Tarte Tatin. Scottish seafood, beef and lamb are complemented with speciality produce from France.\n\nI sampled a salad appetiser of tender slices of scallops, potatoes and artichoke, shaped like a flower on the plate, Roast Lobster, (from Scrabster, Caithness), stuffed with tiny sweet girolles, and a platter of French and Scottish cheese. This was a gastronomic experience and I can’t wait to return. Friends of mine have visited several times in the past few months, and booked again for their wedding anniversary. The Pompadour is certainly one of the top dining rooms in Edinburgh – romantic setting, exemplary service, divine cuisine.\n\nThe attractive wood-panelled Galvin Brasserie de Luxe beside Peacock Alley offers a Prix Fixe menu and classic dishes: Oysters, L’Escargots, Lemon Sole, Coq au vin, Steak, Tart au Citron.\n\nA breakfast feast with a buffet counter as well as freshly prepared dishes to order, start the day with your favourites, from coffee and croissants to Eggs Benedict; Le Petit Dejeuner is also served in the Brasserie.\n\nEat well, keep well. Workout in the Fitness centre with a swimming pool and for pampering relaxation visit the new signature Guerlain Spa, the first in the UK. Designed as a tranquil sanctuary to escape the city, experience specialist face and body treatments such as the exceptional Orchidée Impériale rejuvenating facial.\n\nThe Caledonian Hotel is a model of timeless elegance. This glitzy, glamorous renaissance now shows off its grand Edwardian splendour with a touch of contemporary pizzazz, as this much beloved Grande Dame prepares to celebrate her 110th birthday.\n\nGuoman Cumberland Hotel\n\nGreat Cumberland place,\n\nLondon W1H 7DL\n\nTEL 0871 376 9014\n\nhttp://www.guoman.com\n\nPrime Location.\n\nJust around the corner from Marble Arch tube station, this is the ideal place to stay if you wish to explore the heart of the Capital’s shopping and West End theatre districts. From the front door, wander along Oxford Street with its famous department stores and browse the designer boutiques of Bond Street.\n\nOriginally opened in the 1920s, The Cumberland was the first London hotel to have direct-dial telephones and en-suite bathrooms. Modern interior design and facilities have kept pace through the century, starting with the entrance lobby with the Wow factor: the vast, minimalist art gallery space with two imposing, impressive sculptured figures. Leading off at each side is a choice of stylish, contemporary bars and restaurants.\n\nAccommodation\n\nThis palatial hotel has around 1,000 luxurious bedrooms, suites and apartments, including the Jimi Hendrix suite. Great Cumberland Place was the last known address of rock ‘n roll musician, Jimi Hendrix when he conducted his last ever interview with music journalist at the hotel, just days before his death in 1970.\n\nBedrooms come in all shapes and sizes, with views of Oxford Street, Park Lane and over to Hyde Park. Be sure to reserve the style and situation of your preferred accommodation. The bedroom I was initially shown on the first floor was immediately above a busy intersection of buses, taxis and rush hour traffic, with no double glazing. I asked if I could possibly move to a room higher up or with a quieter outlook and I was offered a junior suite with lounge area, (sofa, armchair, 32” plasma TV), and deluxe bathroom (bath and power shower), bathrobe, slippers and soft towels.\n\nAll rooms have tea and coffee tray, wi fi internet and free access to the cardiovascular gym. Guests in executive bedrooms and suites have complimentary use of the Guoman Club lounge with PCs, newspapers and magazines for a quiet retreat or business meeting.\n\nAn Urban Resort –wining and dining\n\nWith a choice of Bars – the Patron, the cutting-edge Carbon nightclub and Momentus Champagne lounge bar – this is more like a Leisure Resort on an exotic island than a London city hotel. Over an aperitif in the low-lit Patron Bar – famous for Tequila cocktails and chill out sound track, I study the Brasserie menu of British favourites listed in simple shorthand manner – Beetroot, Macaroni, Mussels, Duck, Risotto. Moving through to the restaurant, I sit on a comfortable, long banquette, with tables well spaced out. To start I sample a generous portion of lightly sautéed Scallops on a bed of creamy risotto, followed by whole Lemon Sole served on the bone – (sufficient to share between two) with a side order of hand cut chips (naughty) and a green salad (healthy).\n\nBreakfast is served in the Market which took me a while to locate downstairs, along a corridor around the corner, hidden in the depths of the basement level. It’s a barn of a place to cater for hundreds of guests all wanting their coffee, toast and eggs at the same time.\n\nBe prepared to a self service experience with few waiters on duty to assist or clear tables, except for pouring mugs of tea and coffee from large flasks. While it’s more like McDonalds than a Hotel dining room, the range of British, American and Continental breakfast dishes is extraordinary. Allow time to wander around each buffet table and kitchen station to select your choice of fruit, cereals, pastries, omelettes, eggs, bacon and pancakes. Noisy and crowded it may be, but you can certainly enjoy a hearty breakfast to keep you going.\n\nOverview\n\nWith all facilities for leisure and business traveller, The Cumberland ticks all the boxes offering an exceptional choice of upmarket bars and restaurants, private hospitality, meeting rooms and conference suites. At Marble Arch, it’s the perfect district for shops, galleries, and city visitor attractions: “Great location if you want to shop,” says one recent guest, “ almost too convenient if you want to restrain the wife’s spending!”\n\nSee the website to check out special offers. Who could resist the Guoman Shopping package with a £ 50 Selfridges gift voucher thrown in. Also upgraded accommodation, Club Lounge and dining deals such as Pre-Theatre Dinners and Romantic Stays with bottle of champagne and breakfast in bed.\n\nGuoman Charing Cross Hotel\n\nThe Strand, London WC2N 5HX\n\nt. 0871 376 9012\n\nwww.guoman.com\n\nWhere is it?\n\nYou could not choose a better location than Charing Cross Hotel – and it’s a fact. Outside the door is a replica of the original Eleanor Cross the point from which road distances are measured to the centre of the London. The Grade II listed property was designed with a magnificent façade in French Renaissance style and opened on 15th May 1865, directly above the grand Station. Victorian railway companies were wise to build Station hotels as a way of “keeping passengers in their pocket.” Today, that ethos continues with direct access to train and tube transport right next door. Staying on the Strand, your are within walking distance of Theatreland, National Galleries, Soho, Covent Garden and Thames Embankment.\n\nClassic and Contemporary\n\nThe Guoman Collection has five distinctive hotels in London, as well as property in Shanghai, all part of a growing portfolio. Charing Cross Hotel was given a fabulous makeover a few years ago, preserving the original elegant features, grand staircase, rich wood and marble, now complemented with smart, sleek furnishings and facilities for the 21st century traveller. Unlike some global hotel brands, a unique, distinctive image is designed for each Guoman property.\n\nFrom the moment you step inside the compact, oval Reception lobby, this does not feel like a large, city centre hotel (239 bedrooms and suites). The ambience is welcoming, friendly, intimate, like a Boutique design hotel. A short corridor leads to the lift and within minutes I am in my Deluxe double bedroom with windows overlooking the rooftops and lanes behind the Strand and beyond is the Thames.\n\nFurnished in shades of soft cream, coffee and terracotta, the room is an impressive space with two armchairs, desk, plasma TV (Freeview), walk- in shower and bath, bathrobes and slippers, mini bar and hospitality tray. BT Openzone wifi is available at a charge. An umbrella in the wardrobe later proves useful. Bedding is exemplary: Egyptian cotton sheets, supersoft duvet and mattress comforter. The best aspect is the fact that I can turn off the AC overnight as it emits a loud hum. I can also open the window for fresh air. I feel relaxed and settle in.\n\nThe Buckingham Wing is an Executive wing of 85 suites for business and leisure guests, offering extra special VIP luxuries, hospitality, internet access, Hypnos beds, dedicated check-in and concierge service.\n\nThe Guest Experience\n\nVisiting London on a business trip, the location is ideal, having arrived here quickly by tube from King’s Cross. A small business centre has the use of two PCs if you don’t bring your laptop. (A problem with logging on was quickly dealt with.) The exclusive Club Lounge on the ground floor is a quiet space to read a paper, sip a coffee or meet colleagues. Guests also have free unlimited access to the fitness gym. The Concierge was always at the front door greeting and meeting – and who could not be more helpful with requests and directions.\n\nThe Terrace Restaurant on the first floor is a sun -filled Brasserie with high windows overlooking the Strand, with a café-bar lounge next door. The Terrace is a popular meeting place for guests and non residents for coffee, lunch, afternoon tea, pre-theatre suppers and dinner serving modern British and international cuisine. The ornate Betjeman banqueting hall and function suites are ideal for Corporate events, private dinners and weddings.\n\nThe General Manager, Riddian Davies, (with a wide hotel and hospitality background in Fiji and South Africa) is young, enthusiastic and clearly passionate about creating an exciting, smart-casual lifestyle experience at Charing Cross. The emphasis is on a simple interior design to enhance relaxation and entice the senses. The use of light, sound and fragrances to create the atmosphere of an urban Spa is the underlying concept. This might sound like corporate marketing speak but after an overnight stay, the subtle manner in which atmosphere and accessories change between day and night is quite magical.\n\nArriving back at 10pm after an evening out, the grand white hallway is lined with a river of warm, welcoming Tea lights. The softly lit Terrace Lounge Bar with its leather club chairs and buzzing with people sipping wine and cocktails, is friendly and inviting. Later, from the appetising room service menu, blending modern dishes with old favourites, I enjoy a tasty late night supper.\n\nThe following morning I am amazed to see how the Terrace Bar and Restaurant have been simply transformed with draped white tablecloths into a Parisian-style Café for a leisurely breakfast.\n\nIn a nutshell …\n\nThis is no ordinary London city centre hotel: Here the guest is treated with personal attention from arrival to departure without all the 5 star formality and fuss. Bedrooms offer space, home comforts and a hint of luxury for complete rest and relaxation. Attention is given to cool design, smart attitude, quiet ambience and fine hospitality. Just like the 19th century travellers arriving by train at Charing Cross station, the timeless, ever-fashionable Charing Cross Hotel is an oasis of calm in the true heart of London. A Destination hotel indeed.\n\nBrand new to the UK is the launch of the Motel One collection of Budget Designer hotels.\n\nThis German hospitality brand (with 42 hotels in Germany and Austria) has opened in Edinburgh, right in the city centre just a two minute walk from Waverley Train Station, and the Airport bus terminus on Waverley Bridge.\n\nThe tag line for Motel One hotels, is “great design for little money”. As I come through the door into the Lounge – Lobby area, the first impression is Wow!. Furnished with bucket chairs and window seats with soft fabrics in tweed, leather and sheepskin, this is a place to relax day and night. A recurring colour scheme throughout the hotel is the signature Turquoise-blue and Mushroom-taupe – cool and contemporary. Johnstone’s Cashmere were commissioned to create the Motel One tartan for the Edinburgh hotel. The colour links through to the fashionable staff uniform too. A neat touch.\n\nThe Lobby – with two gorgeous Jacobsen Egg chairs – for a welcoming check-in, and up to my minimalist but freshly decorated, white, blue and taupe bedroom on the 7th floor, overlooking Princes Street Gardens. Furniture is practical with desk, stool and armchair which you can move to where you wish to sit. Brilliant idea. Shower-room, TV (multi-channels), Tea/coffee tray, proper (not fixed) hangers, soft pillows/duvet, AC controls, and well positioned lighting.\n\nOne Lounge, the café bar on the ground floor is where a self service Continental breakfast is served – cereals, apples, toast, croissants, cheese, boiled eggs, tea/coffee machine. The intimate Bar – good selection of beers, wine, whisky and snack menu – is dressed in a snazzy style featuring vintage crystal glass lampshades, tartan tweed stools and quirky drinks tables made from old whisky casks. Open to non-residents too, so I shall return!\n\nLike Ryanair, Motel One offers No Frills – no telephone or Mini Bar, but what it lacks in 5 star facilities is made up for by smart design and exceptionally low room rates for the city visitor. (Summer 2014 – £ 69 single/£84 double). There are 208 bedrooms within this tall, turreted Old Town building, of all shapes, sizes and views, including a spacious Accessible room with Wet Room, alarm cord.\n\nCity life and Eating Out? Restaurants, pubs, prime heritage sites from the Castle to Palace, art galleries, shopping and night clubs are all to be found nearby.\n\nJust open for 6 months, Motel-One Edinburgh Royal has already proved to be an innovative, trendy, affordable concept for international leisure and business visitors. A second Motel One will open here on Princes Street later in 2013. Future hotel plans are London in 2014, then other UK and European cities.\n\nBrowsing through guest reviews, the recurring verdict is the same: great deal, excellent location, comfort, friendly staff. A Swiss couple wrote “ We will stay in no other Edinburgh hotel from now on. Love it!.”\n\nHaving experience an overnight stay here, Motel One Edinburgh-Royal passes the good sleep Pillow Test. I also enjoyed a relaxing glass of wine before going out for dinner in the cosy bar, and the casual DIY breakfast was fun. The smart, savvy world traveller should certainly plan to stay here for a budget tariff and spend the money saved on having a fabulous time around the city.\n\nwww.motel-one.com t. 0131 220 0730. 18-21 Market Street, Edinburgh EH1 1BL"
