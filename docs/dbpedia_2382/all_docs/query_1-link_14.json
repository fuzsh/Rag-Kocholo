        "text": "Information on Hypnos, the Greek god of sleep and gallery of cameos and other objects which incorporate his persona. In Greek mythology the winged youths Thanatos (Death) and his brother Hypnos (Sleep) were the children of Nyx (Night)Â and Erebus, the god of darkness. He is often portrayed as a baby in the arms of his mother, Nyx.Â Both had attributes – objects traditionally associated with them in images. Hypnos is often shown with an owl and a poppy, denoting night time and the drowsiness induced by the narcotic plant, or with wings attached to his head. Reference:Â Victoria & Albert Museum.\n\nHypnos appears in numerous works of art, most of which are vases. An example of one vase that he is featured on is called “Ariadne Abandoned by Theseus,” which is part of the Museum of Fine Arts in Bostonâs collection. In this vase, Hypnos is shown as a winged god dripping Lethean water upon the head of Ariadne as she sleeps. One of the most famous works of art featuring Hypnos is a bronze head of Hypnos himself, now kept in the British Museum in London. This bronze head has wings sprouting from his temples and the hair is elaborately arranged, some tying in knots and some hanging freely from his head. Reference:Â Wikipedia"
