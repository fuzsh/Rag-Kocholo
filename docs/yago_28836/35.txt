Jane Wyman (born Sarah Jane Mayfield January 5, 1917; died September 10, 2007) was an American actress.

Biography[]

Wyman began her film career in the 1930s, and was a prolific performer for two decades. She received an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in Johnny Belinda (1948), and later achieved success during the 1980s for her leading role in the television series Falcon Crest (1981-1990).

Wyman was the first wife of Ronald Reagan, marrying him in 1940 and divorcing him in 1948, long before he became U.S. president or ran for any public office. She was the only woman to have been an ex-wife of an American president until the inauguration of Donald Trump.

When Marty McFly told Dr. Emmett Brown that the President of the United States in 1985 would be Ronald Reagan, the skeptical Brown scoffed at the idea that such a famous actor would hold a government office and, apparently unaware of their divorce, sarcastically suggested that Wyman would be the First Lady.
