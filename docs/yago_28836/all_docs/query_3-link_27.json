Two vintage photographs of actors Jane Wyman and Ronald Reagan in 1940, holding their newly received marriage license in one photograph and descending the stairs of the Wee Kirk o' the Heather Church in Glendale after their wedding in the other. Both with mimeo snipes on the verso.\n\nAfter starring together in \"Brother Rat\" (1938) and its sequel \"Brother Rat and a Baby\" (1940), Reagan and Wyman were married in 1940. The couple divorced in 1949, a decision purportedly attributable to Wyman's difficulty with marriage to a Democrat, which Reagan still was at the time.\n\nOne photograph 10 x 8 inches, one photograph 8 x 10 inches. Very Good plus, with light edgewear and toning to the verso.\n\n[Book #148087]"
