        "text": "He doesn't meet Nancy Davis or Dr. Loyal Davis. Does his acting career continue sinking into oblivion without a political career?\n\nI know Reagan joked that he was old, \"I knew Thomas Jefferson\" and all that...but I don't like this belongs in the pre-1900 section.\n\nHe doesn't meet Nancy Davis or Dr. Loyal Davis. Does his acting career continue sinking into oblivion without a political career?\n\nDon't you mean to ask, How long would Reagan remain in acting if he remains married to Jane Wyman? Would he go into politics and could he be successful if married to Jane Wyman?\n\nAnd speaking of Jane Wyman, would she still portray Angela Channing on Falcon Crest if married to the President of the United States?"
