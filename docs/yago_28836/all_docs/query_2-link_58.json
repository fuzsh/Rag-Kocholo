        "text": "Served: January 20, 1981 – January 20, 1989\n\nBorn: February 6, 1911\n\nBirthplace: Tampico, Illinois\n\nDied: June 5, 2004\n\nOccupation: Actor\n\nPolitical Party: Republican\n\nSpouse: Jane Wyman (1940-1948), Nancy Davis (1952-2004)\n\nHow a Former Actor Became President\n\nBefore Ronald Reagan became the 40th president of the United States, he was known for his governorship in California, where he served from 1967 to 1975. Additionally, Reagan had been an actor, appearing on radio, television, and film.\n\nDuring his first term, Reagan focused largely on domestic issues, especially economic reform. His economic policies were named “Reaganomics” and included reduced tax rates, deregulation, and reduced government spending. Reagan also had an assassination attempt on his life, which he survived.\n\nThe Life of an Actor\n\nReagan attended Eureka College and graduated with a double degree in economics and sociology. Immediately after graduation, he began working as a radio host and DJ until he moved to Los Angeles to start his acting career.\n\nAs an actor, he made several films and then moved on to being a television actor. He was never known as an A-list actor, but he was a well-known B-lister. Later, he became president of the Screen Actors Guild.\n\nIn 1937, Reagan enlisted in the Army Reserve as a private. His first active duty assignment was in Fort Mason, California at the San Francisco Port of Embarkation, where he was Port and Transportation liaison officer. In 1942, he transferred into the Army Air Force, assigned to the public relations department.\n\nReagan married actress Jane Wyman in 1940 and they had three children, one of whom was adopted. In 1948, they divorced, making Reagan the only U.S. president to have ever been divorced. In 1952, Reagan remarried actress Nancy Davis, and they had two children together.\n\nAn Interest in Politics Leads to the Presidency\n\nBy 1966, Reagan had become interested in politics and ran for governor of California. He was elected to two terms before deciding to run for president, defeating Jimmy Carter in 1980.\n\nIn Reagan’s first term as president, he announced a war on drugs; by his second term, he had refocused on foreign affairs. Reagan strongly supported anti-Communist movements throughout his presidency. His second term was mired in the Iran-Contra affair.\n\nCheck out this video of Reagan’s “We the People” Speech, his farewell address to the nation in 1988:\n\nDid You Know…?"
