        "text": "Eleanor Roosevelt’s Wedding Gown\n\nEleanor Roosevelt, who is the daughter of President Theodore Roosevelt’s brother, married Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who was the president’s fifth cousin in 1905. Their initial meeting was back when Eleanor was 14 and he was 18. After losing touch for a few years, they reconnected when they ran into one another at a horse show in Madison Square Garden.\n\nF.D.R finally proposed to Eleanor when she was 19 and he, 22. Both sides of the Roosevelt family were in attendance. It may seem like a Roosevelt-Roosevelt marriage was odd, but it was not uncommon. On her wedding day she wore a high collared gown with puffy fabric shoulders and an elegant hat.\n\nJackie Kennedy’s Last-Minute Wedding Dress\n\nIn 1953, Jackie Bouvier gave fashion designer Anne Lowe the task of making her wedding dress. Unfortunately, ten days before the wedding, a water pipe broke and tragedy hit at Lowe’s studio on Madison Avenue. In total, it ruined 10 dresses for the wedding, including Jackie’s dress which took two months to create.\n\nLowe was on a time crunch to re-create Jackie’s dress. She ordered additional ivory French taffeta and pink silk faille. With a team of seamstresses by her side, they were able to remake a dress just in time for the wedding. Jackie’s dress had a classic neckline and bouffant skirt. It was so beautiful that it is considered to be one of history’s most iconic wedding gowns.\n\nBarbara Bush Borrowed Her Future Mother-In-Law’s Veil\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush and Barbara Pierce met when they were teenagers in 1941. In a documentary titled 41, he discusses how they first met. In the documentary he says, “They called it a holiday dance at Christmas time and here she was in this red and green dress. I said, ‘Who is this good-looking girl, that beautiful girl over there?’ ‘That’s Barbara Pierce from Rye, New York.’ So then a guy named Wozencraft introduced us. And the rest is history.”\n\nA few years later, the two married in 1945 at First Presbyterian Church in Rye, N.Y. George’s mother wore a veil when she got married and gifted it to Barbara for her ceremony.\n\nThe Obama’s Throwback ’90s Wedding Photo\n\nSimilar to Hillary and Bill Clinton, the famous Barack Obama met his future wife, Michelle Robinson in the law field. The two met while working at Sidley Austin law firm located in Chicago. At first, Michelle was against dating a colleague because she knew that could make for a messy work environment if things didn’t work out. However, eventually he convinced her to go on a date in 1989. They obviously really hit things off because the pair married three years later.\n\nThe two were married at the Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago. It was as sweet as can be when Michelle’s brother walked her down the aisle, and a dance to “You and I” by Stevie Wonder followed. Michelle’s dress of choice was white, with pointed sleeves on her shoulders accompanied by a veil.\n\nRosalynn and Jimmy Carter- Since 1946\n\nRosalynn and Jimmy Carter were fairly young when they married on July 7, 1946. At the time she was only 18 and he was 21. The wedding was located in their hometown, Plains, Georgia. At first, Rosalynn turned down the proposal of the future 39th president but changed her mind once he graduated from a wartime class at the U.S. Naval Academy.\n\nIt doesn’t come as a surprise that Jimmy wore his Navy uniform. Rosalynn chose a knee-length dress and paired it with a set of gloves, a hat, and a corsage. In 2016 the couple celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary. Now that is something you don’t hear very often.\n\nMamie Eisenhower Was 19 When She Married\n\nGeneva Doud who was only 19 at the time married Dwight Eisenhower on July 1st in 1916. At the time of their marriage, Dwight was 25 and a lieutenant in the Army. The two wed at Mamie’s parents’ home in Denver, Colorado.\n\nFollowing the wedding, the two enjoyed their honeymoon at a resort nearby.\n\nBess Truman Had a Good Sense of Style\n\nOn June 28, 1919 Elizabeth Virginia “Bess” Wallace married Harry Truman who eventually would become president of the United States. As a young child Bess would’ve been best described as a tomboy by those who knew her. However, as she grew into a young woman, she became more feminine and enjoyed fashion-particularly hats. A friend of Bess said, “Bess always had more stylish hats than the rest of us did, or she wore them with more style.”\n\nHarry and Bess met prior to him leaving for World War I and proposed in 1911, and unfortunately, she said no. He decided that he wanted to be able to provide a comfortable living for her before proposing again. At their wedding, Bess wore a beautiful brimmed hat.\n\nLou Henry Hoover’s Unconventional Wedding Gown\n\nLou Henry was an extremely smart and interesting woman. In her free time, she enjoyed camping with her father, and collecting rocks and minerals. She was also a proficient taxidermist. She met future President Herbert Hoover at Stanford University where she graduated with a B.A. in Geology. An interesting fact about Lou is that she was fluent in Chinese and was the only First Lady who was able to speak the language.\n\nIn February of 1899 Lou and Herbert tied the knot at her parents’ home in Monterey, California. Just like the groom, she chose to become a Quaker, but interestingly enough, they were married by a Roman Catholic priest. Instead of wearing white or a lighter color, Lou chose to wear a dark-colored gown.\n\nLucy Hayes’ - A \"Genuine Woman\"\n\nOn December 30, 1852, Lucy Ware Webb married Rutherford Richard Hayes at her family’s home in Cincinnati, Ohio. You may not know this, but Lucy had several suitors before she finally settled down with Rutherford. Lucy had a strong moral character and came from a religious background which made her seem like the perfect match for Rutherford according to his mother.\n\nIn 1851 Rutherford wrote in his diary, “I guess I am a great deal in love with L(ucy)…Her low sweet voice…her soft rich eyes.” He also referred to her as a “genuine woman.” Together the couple had eight children and as you can tell from the photo above, the pair both wore dark clothing on their wedding day.\n\nNancy Reagan Tried to Hide Her Baby Bump\n\nNancy Davis was a well-known actress in the 1940s and 1950s. Prior to meeting Ronald Reagan, she dated a man named Clark Gable. Nancy met Ronald in 1949 which was when he was the president of the Screen Actors Guild. Ronald was not someone who was big on marriage to begin with, but especially not after his divorce from Jane Wyman.\n\nHowever, after three years of dating, Ronald and Nancy married in 1952. To avoid running into any issues with the press, their wedding was very last minute, and the only people who attended were the best man and matron of honor. The ceremony took place at the Little Brown Church located in Los Angeles. Nancy was also pregnant at their wedding so she wore a very simple, no-frills dress in an effort to conceal her bump.\n\nLaura Bush Chose a Simple Tan Dress for Her Special Day\n\nGeorge Bush and Laura Lane Welch met at a backyard barbecue in July and got engaged just three months later. The two met on November 5, 1977, at her childhood church in Midland, Texas. The new couple took pictures with the future president’s parents, Geroge H.W. Bush and Barbara Bush.\n\nLaura’s mother wore a fancy, traditional gown but she chose to wear a very simple tan dress she bought off the rack to her wedding. Bush was the Governor of Texas from 1995-2000 and became the President of the United States the following year.\n\nGlover Cleveland's Courted Frances Folsom When She Was a Young Girl\n\nIn Today’s world, the union between Frances Folsom’s marriage to Glover Cleveland would not be socially acceptable. Grover met Frances when he was 27 and she was just a small child. He had his eyes on her from a very early age and he bought her several gifts to woo her. Frances’s father passed away when she was only 11 in 1875.\n\nHe didn’t have a will set in place, so Grover became the administrator of his estate. It was when Frances was in college the two became involved. In 1886, the two married when she was 21 and he was 49. At her wedding, she wore a white dress with orange blossoms and laurel leaves.\n\nBetty Ford Didn’t Wear White At Her Second Time Around\n\nElizabeth Anne “Betty” Bloomer married Gerald R. Ford in Grand Rapids, MI, in 1948 at the Grace Episcopal Church. Although most brides choose to wear white on their wedding day, Elizabeth did not. She looked absolutely beautiful in a shiny dress with a pair of pumps to match. Prior to her marriage to Gerald, she was married to a man named Willian G. Warren, but due to his alcoholism, they divorced in 1947.\n\nThe two of them delayed their marriage initially because he was running for the U.S. House of Representatives. According to the New York Times, “Jerry was running for Congress and wasn’t sure how voters might feel about his marrying a divorced ex-dancer.”\n\nHelen Louise Herron Taft’s Got Married in the Comfort of Her Home\n\nHelen Louise Herron “Nellie” Taft and William Howard Taft married on June 19, 1886. The wedding ceremony took place at Nellie’s parents’ home in Cincinnati, Ohio. Her dress was a short-sleeved gown with her hair styled into a beautiful up-do with a decorative accent that matched her dress. While on their honeymoon, the two visited New York City and Sea Bright, New Jersey. Following that, they traveled to Europe for a total of three months.\n\nHelen had become the First Lady of the United States when Cleveland took office as the president in 1909 and served through 1913.\n\nMelania Trump’s Luxurious Wedding Gown\n\nMelania Knauss married Donald Trump in 2005, prior to him becoming president. Her dress of choice was made by the designer Dior and had 300 feet of tulle. The dress came with a hefty price tag too. It was somewhere between $100,000 and $200,000 to create. Not only was the price large, so was the dress.\n\nThe dress was so heavy that she was told to have a full meal before walking down the aisle so she could handle carrying the weight of the fabric and its accouterments. It had more than 1,500 pearls and rhinestones. The dress was so big that she couldn’t even sit in a chair, she had to sit on a bench instead.\n\n550 Hours Went into Melania’s Wedding Gown\n\nTo elaborate further on Melania’s dress, it obviously took quite a while to create. According to Vogue, it took the Christian Dior brand 550 hours to make her dress. Meeting the strict deadline and with it being a high society event, it was not easy to do.\n\nHer train alone was 13-feet long and a 16-foot veil. The dress weighed a total of 60 pounds - insane! We aren’t surprised that she didn’t wear the dress after the reception.\n\nMelania Wore Vera Wang for Her Second Dress\n\nOnce the two had exchanged their wedding vows, Melania stepped out of her amazing Christian Dior gown and stepped into a Vera Wang dress. Of course, her Dior gown screamed everything extravagant, but the Vera Wang dress showed off her very model-like figure.\n\nIt hugged her body ever so perfectly and went straight down to the floor, with a slit that came up to her knee.\n\nEdith Wilson Was One of Her Husband's Advisers\n\nPresident Woodrow Wilson met Edith Bolling Galt a year after his wife passed away. She was also married but her husband had also passed away in 1908. The two married on December 18, 1915, in Washington, D.C. It was thought by many that Wilson would not be elected for a second term due to his quick courtship to Edith.\n\nHowever, he was inaugurated for the second time in March of 1917. Edith proved to be an invaluable advisor to her husband during his second term, which included the beginning of WWI.\n\nLyndon Baines Johnson Proposed on the First Date\n\nLyndon Baines Johnson, LBJ for short met Claudia Alta, “Lady Bird” Taylor through a mutual friend. Sometime after Lady Bird made a confession that she felt drawn to LBJ “like a moth drawn to a flame.” Wildly enough, he proposed to her on the first date and she accepted about two weeks later.\n\nThe two married in San Antonio, Texas on November 17, 1934. A honeymoon to Mexico came after the wedding. LBJ became the 36th president of the United States in 1963 after John F. Kennedy was assassinated.\n\nLong Before the Watergate Scandal\n\nThelma Catherine “Pat” Ryan and Richard Nixon fell in love after meeting at an audition for a community play.

Nixon became president after his second presidential campaign. As you may already know, Mr. Nixon was a part of one of the biggest American political scandals in modern history.\n\nAmerica’s First Presidential Wedding\n\nWhen George Washington was 26, he married Martha, who was 27 at the time on January 6, 1759. They married at the White House, which was a plantation at the time.

The bride wore purple silk shoes with spangled buckles, which are occasionally displayed at Mount Vernon.” Her dress was also blue, to coordinate with Washington’s.\n\nA Snapshot of Barack and Michelle Obama's Garter Toss\n\nIn 2018 Michelle posted this intimate photo from her wedding reception of her and Barack on Instagram. In her caption, she shared with her followers that he had been sick with a cold in the morning but felt better when he was at the altar.\n\nShe recalled: “We ended up dancing almost all night. Twenty-five years later, we’re still having fun, while also doing the hard work to build our partnership and support each other as individuals. I can’t imagine going on this wild ride with anybody else.”\n\nThe Reagans on Their Wedding Day\n\nRonald Reagan was so in love with his wife, and one of the ways he showed this was by giving her thoughtful gifts. He would complete drawings that he created and signed (I love you more than anyone ‘in the whole wide world. Who knew that Ronald was such a romantic!\n\nMr. Reagan’s Best Man was William Holden, the Academy-Award winning famous for films like Sunset Boulevard, The Wild Bunch, and Sabrina. His wife’s Maid of Honor was his William’s wife, actress Brenda Marshall.\n\nLaura Bush Was George Bush's \"Best Decision\"\n\nMarriage is such a beautiful thing because it’s a union of two families coming together. In Laura Bush’s case, she would also be gaining siblings, which was unknown to her because she had been an only child her entire life. She was truly thrilled to know that she would be gaining five brothers and sisters-in-law when she married George.\n\nGeorge W. had later said that marrying Laura, who has now been his wife for four decades, was the “best decision of his life.”\n\nGrover Cleveland Was the Only President to Get Married at the White House\n\nAt the time of Grover Cleveland’s marriage Frances Folsom in 1886, he was the first and only president to be married at the White House. They celebrated their beautiful wedding in the summer of 1886. Prior to Frances becoming the first lady, Grover’s sister served.\n\nFor whatever reason, reporters were so fascinated by the President’s honeymoon that they followed the two around with binoculars. The couple had five children in total together and remained married until he sadly passed away in 1908.\n\nThomas Jefferson’s Wedding\n\nThe famous Founding Father, Thomas Jefferson married Martha Wayles in 1772 who was a widow.

Kennedy married on September 12, 1953, the entire Kennedy family turned out in Newport, Rhode Island. The two invited roughly 800 guests to attend the ocean-front wedding at Saint Mary’s Church. It sounds like an amazing wedding, we can’t imagine anyone not going to it.\n\nJackie had a total of ten bridesmaids, not including her maid of honor. All of them wore pink taffeta gowns to the ceremony. Her bridesmaids included her sister Lee, her stepsister Nina Auchincloss, John’s sister Jean, sister-in-law Ethel, and Jackie's former roommates, Nancy Tuckerman.\n\nJackie Kennedy and the Best Men\n\nYou’d assume that JFK would include his brothers in his bridal party, and he did! In this photo, Jackie is with the men of the family, including Robert and Edward Kennedy who are standing on either side of John.\n\nAt the time, JFK was a United States Senator, and his Senate colleague George Smathers, brother-in-law Sargent Shriver, cousin Joe Gargan, and brother-in-law Michael Canfield were all in his wedding party.

This is another dress that was designed by Ann Lowe and is now iconic for American brides. Jackie’s dress is probably one of the best-remembered gowns of all time.\n\nJackie kept it simple and wore very little jewelry with her dress. The bouquet she held had pink and white spray orchids and gardenias. If you want to go see Jackie’s dress, it’s on display at the Kennedy Library which is located in Boston, Massachusetts. You can also see many of her other popular outfits there.\n\nThe Royal Wedding, American Style\n\nThere wasn’t a single person who didn’t want to attend the amazing Jackie and John wedding. Why? Because it was similar to a royal wedding. Life photographer Lisa Larson wrote, “Their wedding turned out to be the most impressive the old society stronghold had seen in 30 years.”\n\nTheir wedding was so special that even the pope blessed them. After two years of dating, JFK proposed to Jackie with a 2.9-carat ring with a matching emerald.\n\nA Woman of Faith\n\nJackie and John shared the same similar Catholic beliefs, and she was the first Catholic woman to serve at the First Lady of the United States. She was baptized at a church in Manhattan called the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola.\n\nIn this picture, the two are kneeling together in the century-old church of St. Mary’s. It was the happiest day of their lives. It was 1953, before JFK’s successful campaign for the presidency, before the Vietnam War, and before Robert F. Kennedy was killed. Unfortunately, Jackie would become a widow about ten years later.\n\nPresident Johnson’s Daughter Tied the Knot in the East Room\n\nTwo daughters of President Johnson got married while he was in office.

Rumor has it that her dress cost right around $25,000.\n\nThe Gluten-Free Wedding Cake\n\nAs you can imagine, security was tight at her wedding, but certain details about the even have come to the surface. For example, Bill Clinton toasted his son-in-law during the reception, saying that he was “looking forward to having some company because I’m outnumbered.”\n\nIt’s been said that Chelsea and Bill danced to a song by Frank Sinatra, and he was crying a bit, and we don’t blame him! Afterwards, the 400 guests who attended were treated to a 500 pound, gluten-free vanilla sponge cake.\n\nWoodrow Wilson’s Daughters Married in the White House\n\nEleanor “Nellie” Wilson was lucky enough to have her wedding in the White House while her father was in office.

Once the couple married, they settled down in the suburbs of New York and lived a pretty down to earth life with their son.\n\nAmy Carter Belonged to No One\n\nAmy Carter was one of the most independent women out there. She married James Wentzel in a smooth sailing ceremony which was held in Plains, Georgia, in 1996.\n\nAmy obviously grew up in the White House, but she didn’t let that change what she wanted her wedding plans to be. She also didn’t let Jimmy give her away, saying that “she belonged to no one.” It comes as no surprise that she kept her own name.\n\nDorothy Bush- The First Presidential Daughter to Marry At Camp David\n\nDorothy Walker Bush was the daughter of President George H.W. Bush and the sister of George W. Bush. She was the first daughter to be married at Camp David which is a very private presidential retreat, located in the woods of Catoctin Mountain Park, Maryland.\n\nIn 1942, President Roosevelt turned it into a presidential retreat. The facility is named after Dwight David “Ike” Eisenhower. Dorothy married a man named Robert Koch in 1992.\n\nAlice Lee and Theodore Roosevelts' Rocky Marriage\n\nAlice Lee Roosevelt was the oldest daughter of President Theodore Roosevelt.

Nicholas was 14 years older, and Alice wasn’t quite ready to settle down. Because of this, she ended up having an affair with a Senator. The two had a daughter together.

This was another wedding that was a huge event.\n\nOnce the couple tied the knot, they settled down near Mount Vernon at Woodlawn which was adjacent to Washington’s Mount Vernon estate.\n\nDavid Eisenhower and Julie Nixon\n\nBelow, we see young couple Julie Nixon and David Eisenhower on their wedding day, December 22, 1968, in New York. Julie is Richard Nixon's youngest daughter, and in a political match made in heaven, she married former president, Dwight D. Eisenhower's only grandson, David Eisenhower. The entire wedding had been planned to the last detail when in 1968, her father was elected president; obviously, this changed things for the young couple.\n\nRichard Nixon recalls trying to convince Julie to change her wedding venue and get married in the White House. After all, the wedding was set to take place seven weeks after election day, and why would Julie not want to be part of the very small and exclusive list of people to get married in the White House? But Julie declined. They didn't want their marriage to become a public and political spectacle. The couple has been married for over 50 years, and are still together today.\n\nMargaret Truman and Clifton Daniel\n\nMargaret Truman, President Harry S.

They had two daughters, but unfortunately, both passed away at a very young age. Already having a fragile, nervous personality, this tragedy led to Ida's slow demise; shortly after their deaths, Ida started to develop epilepsy and became very dependant on William.\n\nThe couple had a strong bond. In fact, opposite to what was accustomed at the time, President Mckinley always insisted that Ida sit beside him at state dinners, instead of at the opposite side of the table. Sadly, McKinley was murdered in 1901, and Ida passed away 6 years later, in 1907.\n\nJulia Gardiner and John Tyler\n\nJohn Tyler was the tenth president of the United States, from 1841 to 1845. Tyler became president sort of \"accidentally\", after being Vice-President to his predecessor, William Harrison, who passed away one month into his presidency.
