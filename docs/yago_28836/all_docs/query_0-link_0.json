        "text": "American actress (1917–2007)\n\nNot to be confused with Jane Wyatt.\n\nJane Wyman ( WY-mən; born Sarah Jane Mayfield; January 5, 1917 – September 10, 2007)[1] was an American actress. A star of both movies and television she received an Academy Award for Best Actress (1948), four Golden Globe Awards (1948, 1950, 1951 and 1983) and nominations for two Primetime Emmy Awards (1957 and 1959). In 1960 she received stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for both motion pictures and television. She was the first wife of President Ronald Reagan.\n\nJane Wyman's movie career began in earnest in 1934 at Paramount Pictures as a chorus girl dancing for LeRoy Prinz. Bryan Foy signed Wyman to her first studio contract with Warner Bros. in 1936 at 19. Over a protracted apprenticeship at Warner Bros. Wyman progressed from bit parts and B films to supporting Maureen O’Sullivan (The Crowd Roars, 1938), Alice Faye and Constance Bennett (Tail Spin, 1939), Olivia De Havilland (My Love Came Back, 1940 and Princess O'Rourke, 1943) and Betty Grable (Footlight Serenade, 1942) in major studio releases.\n\nAfter more than a decade on screen the post-war success of The Lost Weekend (1945) finally established Jane Wyman, then 28, as a movie star. More dramatic vehicles followed including The Yearling (1946), Johnny Belinda (1948), Stage Fright (1950), The Blue Veil (1951), So Big (1953), Magnificent Obsession (1954) and All That Heaven Allows (1955). She received four nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress between 1946 and 1954, winning for Johnny Belinda (1948).\n\nIn 1955 at 38 Jane Wyman transitioned into television forming her own production company Lewman Productions Ltd.(co-owned with MCA Inc.) and assuming responsibility for producing the next 3 seasons (1955-1958) of the already popular filmed anthology series the Fireside Theatre from Hal Roach Studios for NBC. She served as producer, host and frequent star of the series from 1955 to 1958.\n\nIn her early forties Wyman continued to work in both film and television, enjoying a certain level of visibility from the syndication of The Jane Wyman Show but no longer in demand as a leading lady.\n\nAfter a couple of periods of virtual retirement between 1963–1968 and 1974–1978 she returned to prominence on the prime-time soap opera Falcon Crest (1981–1990), portraying the role of villainous matriarch Angela Channing.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nSarah Jane Mayfield was born on January 5, 1917, in St. Joseph, Missouri, to Gladys Hope (née Christian; 1891–1960) and Manning Jeffries Mayfield (1895–1922). Her father was a meal company laborer and her mother was a doctor's stenographer and office assistant. Wyman was an only child. Her birth parents were married in March, 1916 in Jackson County, Missouri. The 1920 census showed her to be three years old on January 15, 1920, and living in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[citation needed]\n\nIn October 1921, her parents divorced and her father died unexpectedly three months later. After his death, her mother moved to Cleveland, Ohio, leaving her to be reared by neighbours, Emma (née Reiss)[2][3] and Richard D. Fulks, the chief of detectives in Saint Joseph.[4] She took their surname unofficially, including in her school records and on her marriage certificate to first husband Ernest Wyman.[5] The Fulks’ had two older children whom were sometimes referenced as siblings.\n\nHer unsettled family life resulted in few pleasurable memories. Wyman later said, \"I was raised with such strict discipline that it was years before I could reason myself out of the bitterness I brought from my childhood.\"[6]\n\nIn 1928, aged 11, she moved to Southern California with her foster mother. In 1930, the two moved back to Missouri, where Sarah Jane attended Lafayette High School in Saint Joseph. That same year, she began a radio singing career, calling herself Jane Durrell and adding three years to her birthdate to work legally because she was under-aged.[7][8][9][10][1]\n\nAfter dropping out of Lafayette High School in 1932 at age 15, she returned to Hollywood, taking on odd jobs as a manicurist and a switchboard operator.[11]\n\nBeginnings\n\n[edit]\n\nJane Wyman began her 60 year show business career as an extra on The Kid from Spain (1932), Gold Diggers of 1933 (1933), Elmer, the Great (1933), and Harold Teen (1934). She had taken classes with Edward Albert Prinz (Dad Prinz) at Prinz’s Dancing Academy back in St. Joseph, Missouri. Dad Prinz’s son LeRoy Prinz was now a successful Dance Director at Paramount Pictures.\n\nPrinz hired Wyman for the chorus of College Rhythm (1934), Rumba (1935), All the King's Horses (1935), Stolen Harmony (1935), Broadway Hostess (1935), and Anything Goes (1936). In between pictures at Paramount she did King of Burlesque (1936) and George White's 1935 Scandals (1935) at Fox.\n\nShe then went to Universal Studios for My Man Godfrey (1936).\n\nWarner Brothers, part 1\n\n[edit]\n\nJane Wyman signed her first contract with Warner Bros.in 1936 [citation needed] and stayed for the next 2 decades. Miracle in the Rain (1956) would become the last film she completed under contract to the studio. It was released on April 7, 1956 almost exactly twenty years after she signed her inaugural contract.\n\nAt Warner Bros, Wyman was in Freshman Love (1936) and Bengal Tiger (1936), Stage Struck (1936), Cain and Mabel (1936), and Here Comes Carter (1936).\n\nWyman had her first big role, both singing and dancing in a Dick Foran Western The Sunday Round-Up (1936).\n\nWyman had small parts in Polo Joe (1936), and Gold Diggers of 1937 (1936) but a bigger one in Smart Blonde (1936), the first of the Torchy Blane series. She appeared in Ready, Willing and Able (1937), The King and the Chorus Girl (1937), and Slim (1937). She had the lead in Little Pioneer (1937), a short, and parts in The Singing Marine (1937).\n\nWarner Brothers, part 2\n\n[edit]\n\nBy the time Wyman starred in Public Wedding (1937), a \"B\"picture, she was already divorced from first husband Ernest Wyman. She retained use of the surname for the remainder of her career.[5]\n\nShe had a supporting part in Mr. Dodd Takes the Air (1937) and was the female lead in some \"B\" films, such as The Spy Ring (1938) (at Universal), He Couldn't Say No (1938) with Frank McHugh and Wide Open Faces (1938) with Joe E. Brown.[15]\n\nWyman was borrowed by MGM to play a supporting part in The Crowd Roars (1938).\n\nBack at Warner Brothers, Wyman was cast as one of the leads in Brother Rat (1938) for Hal B. Wallis. It co-starred Ronald Reagan, Priscilla Lane, Wayne Morris and Eddie Albert.\n\nWyman was borrowed by 20th Century Fox for a supporting role in Tail Spin (1939), followed by The Kid from Kokomo (1939) with Pat O'Brien and Morris. She played the title role in Torchy Blane..Playing with Dynamite (1939).\n\nNow established, Wyman was cast in Kid Nightingale (1939) with John Payne, Private Detective (1939) with Foran, Brother Rat and a Baby (1940) with Reagan, An Angel from Texas (1940) with Albert, Flight Angels (1940), and Gambling on the High Seas (1940) with Wayne Morris.\n\nWyman had supporting roles in \"A\" films such as My Love Came Back (1940), starring Olivia de Havilland and Jeffrey Lynn. She and Reagan were in Tugboat Annie Sails Again (1940). Wyman was a supporting role to Ann Sheridan in Honeymoon for Three (1941) and was Dennis Morgan's leading lady in Bad Men of Missouri (1941).[16]\n\nWyman made The Body Disappears (1941) with Jeffrey Lynn and You're in the Army Now (1941) with Jimmy Durante; in the latter she and Regis Toomey had the longest screen kiss in cinema history: 3 minutes and 5 seconds.[17][18]\n\nWyman did Larceny, Inc. (1942) with Edward G. Robinson, and My Favorite Spy (1942) with Kay Kyser.\n\nAt 20th Century Studios, Wyman was a supporting actor to Betty Grable in Footlight Serenade (1942) then back at Warners supported Olivia de Havilland in Princess O'Rourke (1943).\n\nWarners teamed Wyman with Jack Carson in Make Your Own Bed (1944) and The Doughgirls (1944), then she was top billed in Crime by Night (1944). She was one of many stars to cameo in Hollywood Canteen (1944).[19]\n\nLeading Lady (1945-1955)\n\n[edit]\n\nJane Wyman finally gained critical attention with The Lost Weekend (1945), made by the team of Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett. Wilder had wanted Katherine Hepburn or Barbara Stanwyck for the female lead but Brackett had been impressed by Wyman’s performance in Princess O'Rourke. Wyman called it \"a small miracle\".[15]\n\nWyman remained a supporting actor in One More Tomorrow (1946), and Night and Day (1946).[20] However Wyman was borrowed by MGM for the female lead in The Yearling (1946), and was nominated for the 1946 Academy Award for Best Actress.\n\nShe was leading lady for Dennis Morgan in Cheyenne (1947) and James Stewart in RKO's Magic Town (1947).\n\nHer breakthrough role was playing a deaf-mute rape victim in Johnny Belinda (1948). Wyman spent over six months preparing for the film which was an enormous hit and won Wyman a Best Actress Oscar.[15] She was the first person in the sound era to earn the award without speaking a line of dialogue. In an amusing acceptance speech, Wyman took her statue and said only, \"I accept this, very gratefully, for keeping my mouth shut once. I think I'll do it again.\"[21][11]\n\nWyman was now a top-billed star. She did two comedies, A Kiss in the Dark (1948) with David Niven and The Lady Takes a Sailor (1949) with Morgan, then made a thriller in England, Stage Fright (1950) for Alfred Hitchcock.[16]\n\nShe played Laura in The Glass Menagerie (1950), and went to MGM for Three Guys Named Mike (1951), a popular comedy.\n\nFrank Capra used her as Bing Crosby's leading lady in Here Comes the Groom (1951) at Paramount, then she had the lead role in RKO's The Blue Veil (1951), a melodrama that was a big box office hit and earned her an Oscar nomination.[citation needed]\n\nWyman was one of many stars in Warner Bros' Starlift (1951). She was the female lead in The Story of Will Rogers (1952) and Paramount reunited her and Crosby in Just for You (1952). Wyman expressed interest around this time of doing no more \"weepy\" roles.[22]\n\nColumbia cast her in a musical, Let's Do It Again (1953) with Ray Milland, then at Warners she was in So Big (1953), a melodrama.\n\nWyman had a huge success when producer Ross Hunter cast her alongside Rock Hudson in Magnificent Obsession (1954). It earned her another Oscar nomination.\n\nWyman and Hudson were promptly reteamed on All That Heaven Allows (1955). Pine-Thomas Productions put Wyman in Lucy Gallant (1955) with Charlton Heston. She did Miracle in the Rain (1956) with Van Johnson. Wyman was meant to follow this with Annabella but it appears to have not been made.[23][24]\n\nRecording career\n\n[edit]\n\nJane Wyman's brief recording career with Decca Records extended between 1951 and 1953. She recorded a few solo tracks along with duets and novelty songs achieving three Billboard top 30 hits and appearing on one #1 album.\n\nDecca Albums\n\nSelections from the Paramount Picture \"Just for You\" (1952): Bing Crosby, Jane Wyman, The Andrews Sisters, Jud Conlon's Rhythmaires and the Dave Barbour Orchestra\n\nStudio cast recording of the music from the film Just for You (1952)\n\nDanny Kaye sings Hans Christian Andersen (1952): Danny Kaye with Jane Wyman, Gordon Jenkins and his Chorus and Orchestra\n\nThis studio cast recording of the music from the film Hans Christian Andersen (1952) spent 17 weeks at #1 on the Billboard “Best Selling Popular Albums Chart” in 1953. Wyman is featured most prominently duetting with Kaye on the track \"No Two People\" and is also credited with contributing vocals to other tracks.\n\nDecca Singles\n\n\"In the Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening\"/\"Misto Cristofo Colombo\" (1951): Bing Crosby and Jane Wyman with Matty Matlock's All Stars and the Four Hits and a Miss, from the film Here Comes the Groom (1951)\n\n\"In the Cool...\" peaked at #11 on the Billboard charts.

In its first season it was known as Jane Wyman Presents the Fireside Theatre then the Jane Wyman Theatre and finally The Jane Wyman Show. Wyman hosted every episode, acted in half, and was a producer.[29]\n\nWhen The Jane Wyman Show ended Wyman was no longer a film star, but she remained in demand. She replaced the ailing Gene Tierney in Holiday for Lovers (1959) for Fox, and next appeared in Disney's Pollyanna (1960) and Bon Voyage! (1962).[30]\n\nWyman continued to guest star on TV shows like Checkmate, Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre, The Investigators, Wagon Train, and Insight.\n\n\"Something happened in the sixties,\" she later said. \"it seemed that the time didn't permit women to be part of it except in a sort of secondary sort of way which I resented. I kept telling myself 'I didn't want to play Whatever Happened to Baby Jane.\"[29] So she went into semi-retirement around 1962.\n\nRe-entrance (1968-1973)\n\n[edit]\n\nWyman focused on painting. She made the occasional acting appearance, mostly on television.\n\nIn 1966, Reginald Denham announced Wyman would appear in a play Wonderful Us based on the Parker–Hulme murder case but it was not produced.[32]\n\nShe returned to films with How to Commit Marriage (1969).\n\nWyman continued to work in the 1970s, guest starring on My Three Sons; The Bold Ones: The New Doctors; The Sixth Sense; and Owen Marshall, Counselor at Law and her first film for television, The Failing of Raymond (1971). She starred in a pilot for a TV series Amanda Fallon but it was not picked up.[33]\n\nShe was offered roles of \"murderers, old ladies that were senile – they were awful. The weirdest kind of writing.\"[29]\n\nTelevision, part 2 (1978-1993)\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter 5 years of retirement living in Carmel painting and focussing on her philanthropic work she took her first acting role since 1974. She accepted a featured role in the television movie, The Incredible Journey of Doctor Meg Laurel (1979). She then guest starred on Charlie's Angels and The Love Boat.[citation needed]\n\nIn the spring of 1981, Wyman's career enjoyed a resurgence when she was cast as the scheming Californian vintner and matriarch Angela Channing in The Vintage Years, which was retooled as the primetime soap opera Falcon Crest. Wyman said she wanted to make it as it was a change from \"the four handkerchief bits\" she was known for. \"You just can't miss on a thing like this,\" she added.[29]\n\nThen relatively unknown Lorenzo Lamas appeared as Angela's irresponsible grandson, Lance Cumson. The on- and off-screen chemistry between Wyman and Lamas helped fuel the series' success.[citation needed]\n\nFor her role as Angela Channing, Wyman was nominated for a Soap Opera Digest Award five times (for Outstanding Actress in a Leading Role and for Outstanding Villainess: Prime Time Serial), and was also nominated for a Golden Globe award in 1983 and 1984. She won in 1984 for Best Performance By an Actress in a TV Series. Later in the show's run, Wyman suffered several health problems. In 1986 abdominal surgery caused her to miss two episodes. She was plagued with fatigue during the 1988–1989 season, and her health continued to deteriorate. Later in 1989 she collapsed on the set and was hospitalized due to problems with diabetes and a liver ailment. Her doctors told her that she should end her acting career. Wyman was absent for most of the ninth and final season of Falcon Crest in 1989–1990.\n\nAgainst her doctor's advice, she returned for the final three episodes in 1990, even writing a soliloquy for the series finale. Wyman appeared in 208 of the show's 227 episodes.\n\nFinal role\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter Falcon Crest, Wyman acted only once more, playing Jane Seymour's screen mother in a 1993 episode of Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman.[35] In all, Wyman had starred in 83 movies[citation needed] and two successful TV series, and was nominated for an Academy Award four times, winning once.\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nMarriages\n\n[edit]\n\nJane Wyman was married five times,[5] to four men. Her last marriage to Fred Karger ended in 1965 and she never remarried.\n\nErnest Wyman\n\n[edit]\n\nAt age 16, Wyman married salesman Ernest Eugene Wyman in Los Angeles, California, on April 8, 1933. She recorded her name as 'Jane Fulks', foster parents Emma and Richard Fulks, and her age as 19 on the wedding certificate. Though the couple divorced after just two years, she retained the name Wyman professionally for the rest of her life.[5]\n\nMyron Futterman\n\n[edit]\n\nWyman was 20 when she married dress manufacturer Myron Martin Futterman in New Orleans on June 29, 1937. She wanted children but he did not, and they separated after only three months.[36] They were divorced on December 5, 1938.[37]\n\nRonald Reagan\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1938, Wyman co-starred with Ronald Reagan in Brother Rat (1938). They were engaged at the Chicago Theatre,[38] and married on January 26, 1940, at the Wee Kirk o' the Heather in Glendale, California.[39] She and Reagan had two biological daughters: Maureen in 1941, and Christine in 1947 (born prematurely and died the following day). They adopted a son, Michael, in 1945.[40]\n\nIn the aftermath of the premature birth and subsequent death of their infant daughter Christine on June 26, 1947 Wyman separated from Reagan. Wyman’s divorce from Reagan was granted on June 28, 1948 and finalized on July 18, 1948. Wyman leased a home in Palm Springs, California.[41] Wyman, who was a registered Republican, said that their divorce was due to political differences; Ronald Reagan was still a Democrat at the time. But this really wasn't the case, she was cheating on him with actor Lew Ayres. She left Reagan for Ayres.[42]\n\nWhen Reagan was inaugurated as president on January 20, 1981, Wyman became the first ex-wife of a U.S. president in American history. Although she remained silent during Reagan's political career, she told a newspaper interviewer in 1968 that this was not because she was bitter or because she did not agree with him politically:\n\nI've always been a registered Republican. But it's bad taste to talk about former husbands and former wives, that's all. Also, I don't know a damn thing about politics.[43]\n\nWhen Reagan died in 2004, Wyman issued a statement, saying, \"America has lost a great president. And a great, kind and gentle man.\"[44]\n\nFrederick Karger\n\n[edit]\n\nOn November 1, 1952, Wyman married German-American Hollywood music director and composer Frederick M. \"Fred\" Karger at El Montecito Presbyterian Church, Santa Barbara. They separated on November 7, 1954, and were granted an interlocutory divorce decree on December 7, 1954; the divorce was finalized on December 30, 1955.\n\nThey remarried on March 11, 1961, and Karger divorced her again on March 9, 1965. According to The New York Times' report of the divorce, the bandleader charged that the actress \"had walked out on him.\"[45] Wyman had a stepdaughter, Terry, from Karger's marriage to Patti Sacks.[46]\n\nWyman, who had converted to Catholicism in 1953, never remarried.[47] She was a member of the Good Shepherd Parish and the Catholic Motion Picture Guild in Beverly Hills, California.[48]\n\nLater life\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter Falcon Crest ended, Wyman made a guest appearance on the CBS series Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman and then completely retired from acting; she spent her retirement painting and entertaining friends.
