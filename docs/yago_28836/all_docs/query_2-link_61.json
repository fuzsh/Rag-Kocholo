        "text": "WASHINGTON -- Jane Wyman divorced Ronald Reagan 'because she found him to be a bore' whose movie career was sinking while her screen career was rising, Parade magazine reports.\n\n'The truth about the Wyman-Reagan marriage is that she dumped him simply because she had fallen out of love with 'Ronnie,'' Lloyd Shearer wrote in the Sunday supplement's copyrighted 'Intelligence Report.'\n\nShearer said Reagan was 'bitterly opposed' to the 1948 divorce.\n\nNeither Reagan nor his former wife have talked about their publicly about their failed marriage, but a spokesman for Parade said Shearer 'has known both Reagan and Wyman for years.'\n\nReagan and Jane Wyman were Hollywood co-stars when they married in 1940, she for the second time, he for the first. They were parents to two children, Maureen and Michael, before their divorce in 1948.\n\nFour years later, Reagan was wed to Nancy Davis, another actress who was to become first lady. Their daughter, Patti Davis, is now an actress, and son Ron is a ballet dancer.\n\nIn the issue of Parade appearing in this Sunday's papers, Shearer gave this account of the marriage:\n\n'In the early years of their marriage, she found him open, buoyant optimistic, blessed with a bright and sunny disposition.\n\n'Six years later, she found him a bore who talked incessantly about union politics -- he was president of the Screen Actors Guild -- and other subjects in which she had little interest.\n\n'Moreover, her career was flourishing, his was declining, and her assessment of their marital status, she magnified their differences in temperament and outlook.'\n\nWhile Reagan has gone to the White House, his first wife has become the star of the successful television series 'Falcon Crest,' now in its second season.\n\nShearer said Jane Wyman earns $35,000 an episode, $770,000 for 22 episodes. Reagan as president has a salary of $200,000 plus expenses."
