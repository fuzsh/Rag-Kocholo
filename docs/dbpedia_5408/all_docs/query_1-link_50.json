If you are a freshman, sophomore, or junior, I recommend starting to apply now. Here are some tips I used to secure my internships a year and a half before the start date: -Find the recruiter by searching \"Talent Acquisition Recruiter at [Company]\" or \"Campus Recruiting Specialist at [Company],\" and add the location of the internship. Send them a quick linkedin message asking them for their email. Once you have their email ask them to give you more information about the internship. Many are willing to meet up with you through Zoom. -Tailor your resume according to the internship. When I applied to a BIG4 compared to a financial/banking services company, I completely changed and organized my work experience to fit the description. I also examined their values and the profiles of other interns to get an idea of what they were looking for in a candidate to see what skills I needed to highlight. -Talk to senior students in your class and ask them about their internship experiences. They know the recruiters and whom to contact, so reach out to them. Utilizing your network will help you significantly. By following these steps, I was able to secure multiple internship offers for my sophomore and junior year. A reminder that this process is very stressful and sometimes you just need luck on your side. Here is a picture of me meeting Deloitte's US CEO\n\nMy internship as a Financial Analyst Intern at Jain V and Company was an incredible journey into the world of pre-IPO processes. Here are some of the most rewarding aspects: â€¢ Financial Modeling Mastery: I had the opportunity to refine my financial modeling skills by building forecasts for a range of companies. This hands-on experience solidified my understanding of financial analysis. â€¢ Deep Dive into Due Diligence: I actively participated in the due diligence process for upcoming IPOs, particularly focusing on those involving Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). This involved a meticulous examination of financial statements to identify potential risks and opportunities for these companies. IPO Knowledge Unlocked: Throughout the internship, I gained a comprehensive understanding of the entire IPO process, including in-depth analysis of DRHPs (Draft Red Herring Prospectus) and the unique considerations for SME IPOs compared to traditional offerings. This internship truly fueled my passion for the world of finance. I'm incredibly grateful to Jain V and Company for providing such a valuable platform to learn and grow. #finance #financialmodeling #ipo #duediligence #internship #JainV&Co."
