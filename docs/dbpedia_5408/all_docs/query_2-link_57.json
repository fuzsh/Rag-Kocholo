If it's Liverpool's intention to sign a short-term replacemen for Lucast, Flamini would be a decent option. Saying that, I still think that they'll persist with Spearing in the meantime.\n\n09 Jan 2012 22:37:42\n\nBirmingham midfielder Enric Vall�s on trial at SPL side Kilmarnock.(5)(10)That's why he played a reserve game today?\n\n09 Jan 2012 23:06:17\n\nIf you have any rumours on st.mirren please reply(1)(12)Swindon town have enquirer about the availability of Paul McGowan and a bid is imminent\n\n09 Jan 2012 23:04:03\n\nChristian Dailly 6 month deal at Kilmarnock(14)(12)\n\n09 Jan 2012 23:01:33\n\nCardiff city to bid once again for noone but after the carling cup semi final tomorrow!

McGregor will only be sold for £6m plus should stay until the Summer. McCoist is planning double swoop on St.Johnstone for Sandanza and Davidson but wages have been laughed at. Loan for Chelsea youth player but don't know name.(21)(8)Also heard this about Davis and heard he is gutted because he is the captain of his boyhood heroes! Without him the league is gone!Your club might be gone soonTwo million for davis ? we paid three million for him and he has just penned a new five year deal so get a grip and stop talking pish timothy !!St Johnstone shall be looking for at least 1500000 for the 2 of them something rangers do not have as they are about to go bustUtter rubbish. The board has set the price for Jelavic and they will only sell at that price. All this nonsense about Rangers going bust yet there storys in the paper today saying McCoist wants to splash 2mm on Javi Guerra\n\n09 Jan 2012 19:11:01\n\nHi Ed, do you know of any Norwich transfer rumours? Or do you know if any of these rumours are true; Snodgrass, Matt Philipps, Jordan Rhodes, Nicky Maynard, Chris Gunter, Wilfried Zaha? Just names I have heard, and would love to know if you know if there is any truth behind any of these. Also do you know anymore about the young German player? {Ed003's Note - Phillips has been watched by a lot of teams and at least 2 offers have been turned down,the others I dont know,sorry }(9)(8)No way Zaha will go Norwich, bigger clubs looking at him and he signed a 5 year deal 2 weeks ago.\n\nAnd yes im a palace fan, not hating #justsaying^ this isn't twitter?You have no hope of getting Snodgrass, he wants to join CelticHope snograss does join glasgow celticPhilips to norwich what garbage is this if he goes and only if, it will be to a big club his manager said chairman said and so did the player so give it a rest fool.\n\n09 Jan 2012 22:03:46\n\nPodolski to arsenal 9 million\n\nPato to arsenal 40 million\n\nRhodes to arsenal swoop with afobe\n\nArshavin to zenit\n\nFabianski to norwich-loan\n\nAfobe to huddersfield(12)(8)Yeeeeeeeee right , pato whos injury prone for 40 mil , so who sits on the bench van persie, ur crazay , a crazay man u r whos just .... carazy\n\n5 gold starsBelievable apart from PatoYou won't get pato podolski or Rhodes keep smoking the good stuffHudders will want more than afobe he is there RVP at least �4m and then maybe afobe aswell!Afobe not bad player. lot younger the rhodes but rhodes going to be a lot better player, afobe couldn't hit barn door last season butstill young would expect 4-5m plus afobe! UTTWhy would Norwich want another keeper? Fans have every faith in Ruddy and have 3 good young keepers at the club so no keeper will be bought at carrow for some time\n\n09 Jan 2012 21:58:54\n\nPeople are saying that Dobbie is part of a swap deal for Maynard between Swansea and Bristol City, but the talk going on around Swansea is that Leroy Lita is the player involved in the deal and not Dobbie. Lita is not playing much game time at the Swans and may be would be up for a return to Bristol City.(4)(13)No chance of Leroy returning to Bristol, he would be in too much trouble of the pitch for it to be sensible.It is on the back page of the Bristol Evening Post about the Maynard - Dobbie and cash deal. i would not want Lita back at ashton Gate, very lazy, useless and over ratedNow reported on the BBC website too\n\n09 Jan 2012 21:41:19\n\nthat was a bit convenient, henry unmarked and scores the winner, I bet that there was a few big bets placed on that one?r(20)(7)From where I was sitting it looked offside, but as it was Henry it was over-looked. Too busy cooing over him. Yes I am a Leeds fan and yes Arsenal deserved to win, they had enough blooming chances to win comfortably. However I do feel like it wasn't going to be their night and would have welcomed a draw, just so we could have another go at them with the likes of Snodgrass and some new transfers.Henry wasn't offside...aidy white played him on\n\n09 Jan 2012 21:40:15\n\nLeeds to offer Henry a loan move after a drab game at the emirates, master bates having a wet dream over the night(12)(28)\n\n09 Jan 2012 20:56:08\n\nLeyton Orient are signing ex Charlton centre back Jonathan Fortune on a 6 month deal after he impressed on trial today(4)(4)I hope he'll do well at Orient, not a bad player at all.\n\n09 Jan 2012 20:52:26\n\nleicester to sign\n\ncameron stewart and billy sharp\n\nsouthampton to sign gary hooper and nicky maynard\n\nwest ham to sign jordan rhodes and vedran corluka(19)(34)Dream on about hooper hes to good for the championship and hes out of ur price range!!Cameron doesn't want to go and Hull don't want to sell so Leicester are wasting their time.All these players are far 2 good for the camp. This is utter rubbishDonny and Leicester have already agreed a fee for Sharp just awaiting personal termsSouthampton and Celtic have agreed a fee for HooperWhy is it ppl think that hull wont sell 2 leicester? its utter bcks! bye far the richest club in the championship FACT! if pearson desperately wants sum1 then he will get him end of!! BLUE ARMYHow can you judge if Hooper is to good for the Championship when he only plays in that piss pot SPLLeicester are nowhere near the richest club in the Championship, their owner barely makes the top half of the table, he just seems to like wasting his money. They might get Sharp, they won't get Stewart.If you are judging \"richest\" club by the wealth of its owner, you may want to check out who own Southampton FC and how much they are worth.Im a celtic fan hooper wont be sold for any priceSharp isn't going to leicesterCameron Stewart is going nowhere! He as pledged his alligence to Hull City, so quitter Pearson might as well look elsewhere eh!\n\n09 Jan 2012 20:51:19\n\nBradford City keen on taking Watford striker Joe Garner on loan to add to their firepower. Garner is out of favour at Vicarage Road with Sean Dyche looking at loan options instead of the former Forest man.(2)(5)\n\n09 Jan 2012 20:49:09\n\nYoure mad, wolves dont pay big wages, and are not in debt at all, old firm arent a force and couldnt hack the pace of the prem.(11)(5)It is easy to slag the old firm, but rangers got �2m for winning the title last year,when the team that finish bottom of the epl get �35m. Just remember that is every year. Given a level playing field rangers and Celtic would blow wolves out of the water. Just remember that rangers took 150,000 fans to Manchester, no other team in the\n\nWorld could have done that.\n\nI don't think 150000 have even Heard of wolves {Ed003's Note - It was 100k yesterday,but you have to remember you play under a different affiliation, I just dont get it myself nobody from other affiliations try to compere themselves with the EPL ? }Behave of course the old firm could cope in the pl. Might take a couple of seasons to get some money but could defo compete. The money in the pl is ten fold to the spl and we have some I the largest fan base in the ukI'm a wolves fan, but I have to say if Rangers or Celtic were given the chance to play in the Premier League and had the money that that goes with it they would grow and become a force within a few years. The size of the clubs there fan base's are huge they have massive gates compared to English clubs like Wigan. This is one of the main reasons that they should never be given the oppurtunity because english clubs would suffer in the long run.I am not being funny, but the EPL is shown all around the world to possibly even billions of people if you think about it in Asia, so even if 'knowing' about Wolves is only a by product of playing against some of the so called better teams in the world, it is still more coverage than what the SPL gets, I am not sure of exact numbers, but the supporter numbers (people who have bought tickets), are in the 200 thousands, so even taking in the fact a few people will have 1, 2 or possibly even 3 numbers, that could accumulate up to at least 125k people buying tickets alone, there are also quite a number of fan clubs around the world who follow Wolves, and also the general support who dont go to games, so I do believe 150000 have at least heard of Wolves.\n\nJust to add, I think you would struggle to begin with in the EPL as if you were a championship club who has just been promoted if you look at your squads as they are (Players who couldnt make it in the EPL, and those who are untested Championship players or those who haven't left Scotland yet. You have a few exciting young players coming through, dont get me wrong even your national side will be decent in a few years time, but just 1 thing you will struggle to compete with in the EPL, and that is to attract players, who wants to go to Glasgow, when there are alot better cities on offer in England, from an outsider looking in I know where I would go, and almost anywhere in England is better than Scotland (I stress not everywhere).\n\nSo to conclude, until you actually do start playing in the EPL, we will never know how you would do, and since this is almost certainly not going to happen, I think and more discussion on it is pretty pointless?Wolves fan is talking sense. we would compete and it would be hard for a season or two but we would have the fan base and the ability to attract big players. After a few years they'd be up neat the top.'A force' doubtful, midtable at best.SPL sides would only be half decent in the championship, there best players are of the same calibre of kyle lafferty who couldnt even hack the championshipThe two sticking points with this are,\n\nWhere would Celtic & Rangers,Conference?\n\nBlue Square? they could not be expected to\n\njoin the football league without having to progress through the divisions on merit,and what would happen to the SPL\n\nwithout the revenue that the Big Two generate.Although there are some good points being made here they are completely irrelevant as it will never happen, although you could ask the question as to why the EPL has Welsh teams in it?\n\nBobbybuffonThe Welsh teams were in there from the start or at least very early on!\n\n09 Jan 2012 20:47:25\n\nbournemouth to sign Swindons Matt Ritchie for 1.5 million plus add ons........ Big things happening at the south coast club thanks to russian investment with the club already having spent over 2 million on permanent deals for their loan signings acording to Steve fletcher (Bournemouth striker) who I was chatting to in the gym tonight(6)(27)Disregard this one.....He wasn't in the gym. He was on twitter posting pictures of him playing darts on the xbox with his daughters. Check for yourselves.....the truth is out there.Total rubbish for a start Bournemouth wouldnt pay 1.5 million and Ritchie wont go to Bournemouth as he sees Swindon and what is happenning there a bigger club than Bournemouth.He'll sign eventually, not for �1.5m though. League two players are not worth that much. Swindon might get some sign on clauses but if the lad is that good he's going to want to move to a club on the up.I'll bet you 1.5 million he doesnt go to liitle Bournemouth and any Russian who is a pal of your chairman has to be iffy how many times has his company gone bust - oh Yes that s it just the SEVEN TIMES. - and apparently he is proud to call his current building company seven building\n\n09 Jan 2012 21:47:18\n\nLiverpool linked with any player who has a pulse!(48)(12)Its better to be linked, and lost, than never to be linked at all. Everton take note.\n\nynwaAnd all of those players are willing to walk bare footed as they are Liverpool fans and are coming for a quarter of the asking price because everyone wants to be part of the club.I think you are mistaken its Tottenham who are linked to any living species in the world..........and a fair few that don'tWell maybe not ipswich players, not that many of them belong to them!

Tottenham,Liverpool and Arsenal are all thought to be interested in Ba who has a £5m release clause and i'm sure we will hear about this clause nearly every day until the 1st of February but a January move appears highly unlikely while a summer move to moneybags PSG who need a forward seems very likely.(25)(15)Already in talks\n\n09 Jan 2012 20:57:03\n\nJunior Hoilett deal almost done as kk sees him as the ideal player to fill RW position. Liverpool to also bid for stokes tuncay sanli and/or Demba Ba of Newcastle. Kk also needs to bolster the midfield and will target chiek tiote.

And also Portsmouth have agreed to sign simon Cox and Marc_Fortune with either Ben Haim or Luke Varney going the other way, depending on their choosing. Also Darcy Blake has agreed to join Portsmouth for a fee up to £250,000 depending on if pompey get a owner by then! any other pompey news uve heard pleasee reply and tell me what that is!;)(5)(25)Ipswich are 60 million in debt no more moneyI'd heard that Pompey need to get rid of Ben Haim, Kitson, Varney and Lawrence before the window shuts to drastically reduce their wage bill. If they can't and don't get new owners pretty quickly they won't be able to pay January's wages. And whoever buys them is going to need to rebuild the ground having paid Gaydamak �15 million or so for the land around Fratton Park first, find and build a new training ground (instead of renting a school field in Eastleigh) and then build an academy from the ground up. Although would anyone invest all that in a club only getting average gates of 15,000?Any news on the takeover15.000 is good for a 20.000 stadium given were now in the championship. And we don't owe 15 million to gaydamak for the land at all. He owns the land around the ground I.e the car park which is a few mill tops. There's a lot of money to be made at Pompey it's wether the right people invest or not. Could make huge profit long term. Plus we have the best fans in England fact.10 Jan 2012 09:03:44\n\nwww.twtd.co.uk/news.php?storyid=19872&title=clegg_reiterates_backing_for_jewell\n\nRead it\n\nMarcus Evans has and will continue to back jewell with Money and it's not Ipswich in that much dept it's how much Evans has lost! :)Surely if you had the best fans in the country every home game would be a sell out, would it not?, please enlighten me as to how anyone can make a profit from Portsmouth. You need to wake up and smell the roses mate, PFC are in trouble BIG TIME. Now that's a FACT!I would have thought that �500K was about right for Kitson, also Haden Mullins for around the same fee, at least they wouldnt have to worry if they were going to be paid each month, I cant see for the life of me who would invest in Pompey, I think they have been delt a raw deal when Harry took over, well over spent to get their success and now its biting them back big time, I do hope someone comes in and brings some stability to Pompey they dont deserve all this crap that they and the fans have been dragged through.\n\nIpswich Town FanJust like there was money to be made out of Chelsea and any other team that's been tarted up and rolled in glitter. Pompey have fantastic fans and are feeling the pinch like everyone else. I would say 15.000+ is very good for them considering where they are at the moment. They'll be fine I like Pompey always have done. Very passionate people and I hope they finally get right owners that treat them right? And get them back to the prem etc\n\n09 Jan 2012 19:42:33\n\nOli Johnson will join Gillingham,as will Jo Kuffour.(12)(5)Oli johnson of frankie goes to hollywood?\n\n09 Jan 2012 19:20:42\n\nHI ed , any news on chesterfield signings or goings ?(3)(8)OUT Rats allways leave a sinking ship.

Wilbraham to Ipswich and is well documented in papers already, but will only happen if Lambert gets a fourth striker in for 1st team squad.The De-Laet could be a possible, because he has suffered a few injuries, but NCFC would still have to pay his salary through end of season, so it will only happen if Lambert has a replacement loan he desperately wants to bring in, because its an expensive option.\n\n09 Jan 2012 17:31:31\n\nLeicester city close to bringing emile heskey back to where it all began.Nigel Pearson's a long time admirer of the prolific striker's speed and ability to poach a goal out of nothing,a nominal fee is all that's required.Pearson's also hoping to recruit Kieran Dyer on a pay as you play deal to form a lethal partnership with heskey!(13)(12)AHAA \"prolific\" and \"poach a goal out of nothing\", have you been watching the same Heskey as the rest of us! ha too funny!Also heard this but with hargreaves in cm just for guaranteed strenght over 40 games a season!Dyer,s out for the seasonNot a hope of this happening heskey is out for the next monthHeskey taught messi all he knowsShrewd business from pearson,sleepless nights ahead for championship defences facing smash n grab,once they hit a purple patch no one will handle their pace and power,a lethal combination!He can trap a ball further than some can kick it\n\n09 Jan 2012 17:31:08\n\nmy dad saw daniel levy at a conference, he asked him about anyu transfer rumours, he said there's a few irons in the fire, on of which being tim howard... his contract runs out in the summer too(4)(10)Everton goalie please no hes rubbish !Oh yes, because when a random person meets Levy, someone that Levy has never met, he will go and tell him a player who he is interested in, one that he hasn't told anyone else about.Going nowhere, + has three years on his contract, so a liar or very ill infomed.Daniel Levy would not be telling people who he was looking to buy and even if he did he wouldn't be looking at Tim HowardI doubt he would have said anything, are you mad?So he has Friedel, Gomes, and Cudicini, who are all better than Howard in my opinion.But Tim has a higher goals to chances ration than most of the spurs team\n\n09 Jan 2012 17:31:05\n\nSource from inside the club that Southampton had a bid of 4.5M for Gary Hooper rejected and as a result won't go over 6M as they don't want a bidding war and Hooper could want more then the 20k per week wage cap at St Mary's(9)(19)The wage cap at Saints is less than 20k it 12k and i keep telling you Saints fans about all these strikers you are tlaking about signing you will have a team of strikers according to you lot.\n\nSo again i will tell you Cortese wont buy players for silly money and wont pay more than your 12k wage cap- i know trust meI'm fairly sure Lallana is on 22 or 23K a week as it is, so I don't think the wage cap is 20K.12k? Ok, you clearly know nothing. Lallana and fonte for example, are both way above that. 22k is the wage cap. Get your facts right, and yes we maybe linked with a few strikers, a good manager doesnt go for one, he has back up plans, so yes alot of inquiries will be made. So think before you post. All it takes is a bit of logic.No FR know's what the wage cap is, if any, unless you have inside information, which so many people seem to have on here. Saints will sign players if it is for the good of the club, they wont pay silly money for any individual player. We have had our finacial problems before as most people are aware. Under Cortese this will not happen again, it not a lack of ambition, it is being sensible. Ask Pompey what happens when you try and buy success.The top player at Southampton is actually 17kWAGE CAP IS 20k per week 5k bonuses\n\nLee has agreed a 800k per year contractWell i know someone senior at Saints and im telling you the wage cap is 12k as i've told you lot before but you come out with these saints stories which are all fairy tales.\n\napparently you were getting Billy Sharp but looks like hes going to Leicester as both clubs have agreed a fee and i told you that as well.

Are you insane, Hooper would be exactly the player we need along side Lambert. I know this is very very unlikely but I hope it's true.Yea lets drive from Glasgow to Southampton.

Ps said in the daily echo paperGuys, has anyone thought that he could have been picked up from Southampton airport in a black Merc, 90 min flight from Glasgow.\n\nRumour has it that Lennon wants to un- load him because of his wage demands to be paid top rate at club, this would release funds for him to bring in another striker, may actually be some truth in this story.\n\nCeltic may get 60,000 in for big derby's but their share of TV money in Scottish league is poor, they get less than Championship clubs, so unless they get a goods run in euro cup they and Rangers struggle to get the really top players, they just can finance them.For a start, why would we be willing to sell our top scorer while we're attempting the treble, and the fact that we don't need to sell anyone?\n\nLennon has also said in the past day or so that no-one will be going anywhere unless crazy money is offered.\n\nand where this nonsense rumour about hooper wanting to be top paid player comes from, i dont know. hooper has stated himself that any talk of contract extensions is being put off till the end of the season so he can focus on the games ahead without niggling worries\n\nhe's not going.....END OF!\n\n09 Jan 2012 17:20:59\n\nBournemouth to bid for Matthew Ritchie again after refused a new contract at Swindon and they will be bidding the same as last time 500k(2)(16)You can bid 500k for Ritchie if you want which is mickey mouse money as you wont get him for that not when Championship teams are hovering for him and going to offer more money plus the fact he says he wants to stay as he loves playing under Paolo and he can see the club really progressing under him.\n\nWith all due respect to Bournemouth you are a smaller club than us and we will soon be overtaking you. Ok you've got your Russian guy come in with some money but how long for as he could be another dodgy guy as Pompey had especially if he is a friend of your chairman.So muppet when did Ritchie refuse a new contract thats news to me as he still has two years left on this one.So just to put your nonsense rumour into context your manager says he wants one stiker in this window so that counts Ritchie out plus contract talks havent even been discussed with Ritchie so again total nonsense story and STFC have already stated he wont go for less than 1.5 - 2 m and Bournemouth wont pay that.Dream on mate 500k would not buy his bootsNo-one will pay that cos he's not worth that much.Then he will stay and see out his contract, because thats how much he is worth to us...\n\n09 Jan 2012 17:10:16\n\nZamora to leave fulham, with fulham singing Carlton cole to replace him!\n\nSamba to go to spurs(8)(17)Would have believed it more if they'd both been left out of FA cup teams this weekend (Zamora & Cole)BZ will only leave if there is a better, younger replacement available - ie not Donkey ColeCole didnt play along with 6 other 1st teamers wont be sold unless u offer silly money or he puts in a transfer request to important to push for epl for us\n\n09 Jan 2012 17:10:05\n\nallagui is much better than fleck anyway so yous can forget about\n\nsighning him(6)(2)\n\n09 Jan 2012 17:06:47\n\nTwo days before it was officially announced that we were in liquidation.

There not, so unless its a PFC supporter this is pure fantasy... Ive heard the deal that was 48hrs away last tuesday has collasped...The above post is wide of the mark. When the debts are paid the ground and surround will be redeveloped at a significant profit. Much needed student accomodation will be part of the new development, among other regegeneration projects. A new ground coupled with training facilities will be developed concurrently including hotel and conference facilities. The club's new owners will also set out to provide a sports science academy.If there was so much profit in building a new ground and developing the surrounding area why has none of the previous owners done it?? Im a property developer and there is certainly no profit in spending 80-100m on a new ground and hopeing student accomadation and a few flats will make you a return,it wont...The land at fratton isnt big enough for anything like whats needed to interest any savy investor unless you knoch FP down and that isnt going to happen or is it?Yes, well read. The entire historical parcel of land including will be redeveloped including Fratton Park. It will not be a few flats but hundreds of attractive student lets in a block. plus other regeneration projects. One part at least will ne a run by a Community Interest Company. The new ground will outside the city one of two sites. This will faciltate ease of access to much larger away support contingents in the future. The sports science college will emerge here also.

But 500k? Well if anyway is stupid enough to pay that much for him it would be 1p5wich! Hope they do sign him, can only help them get relegated really! Poor player is WilbrahimovicNot sure your opinion of Wilbraham being a poor player is fair, he Joined Norwich as a back up to Holt at a diff level of football, and then we signed Morrison, who has kept Holt out of the team sometimes this season, so he has not had much of a chance to show his worth.He's not worth �500, never mind �500k, I'd be surprised if he wasn't allowed to leave on a free if anyone would take him.\n\n09 Jan 2012 16:51:55\n\nWatford, Charlton and Portsmouth all want Karleigh Osborne after he rejected a new contract with Brentford.

But the situation is, Norwich are a premiership club, Leeds are championship, and it will be this way next season aswell. So if Norwich came in for him and had a bid accepted, I have no doubt Snodgrass would leave.The fact of the matter is, yes you may be bigger, in the way that around the world you are more well known, and that you have won more than us. But we are a premiership club, and will be next year, you are a championship club, and will be next year.Now I know most Yorkshire folk a not the sharpest tools in the box, So lets try and keep this to works of less than three sylabuls. YOU ARE A VERY SMALL CLUB WHO ARE LIVING ON THE HISTORY OF DAYS LONG GONE BY.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen knocking aforementioned Yorkshire folks lack of intellect it would help if you manage to spell your comments correctly you massive tool!\n\nEither way this rumours nonsense!To the guy insulting \"Yorkshire Folk\".\n\nThe word you were looking for is WORD not work and it's also syllable.\n\nOh and history is three syllables his-to-ry.\n\nKeep it up. You're really portraying all Norwich fans in a positive light and really educating us Yorkshire folk.\n\nSnodgrass would cost anything from 3 - 8 mill by the way.Snodgrass woudl easily choose a contract offer from Norwich over one from Leeds. But don't agree with the fee though, Bates would never accept that. Considering we can get him on a free in the summer, i don't think we should pay any more than 2.5-3 million if we do sign him this month8 million? He has 6 months left on his contract, no club would pay that. But knowing Bates that's what he probably wants, even though he'll be joining us on a free at the end of the season. OTBC!He signed a 4 year contract in Aug 2009. I think you'll find that his contract will end in 2013.\n\n3 - 8 mill and you can have him.Guys, I am a Norwich fan, and while I agree he will not leave for �1.5M, he will almost certainly leave at season end if not before, will he eventually come to Norwich who knows?, But Lambert is keen on him.\n\nBut before you start on the educational prowess of Norfolk Folk, please consider toning down your responses then you will find others respond in kind. The site is meant to allow rumours to be posted in a general forum, not to trade cheap insults about each other's club, after all we all clearly love football that's why we use the site....I think the original post about him joining up with ex-colleagues, is referring to him joining up with hoolahan and Paul Lambert.\n\nthe 3 of them were together at Livingston.\n\n09 Jan 2012 16:03:12\n\nhey ed ... i keep hearing about torres putting transfer request in , firstly have you heard anything and secondly , he supposed to only want to come back to anfield or athletico which makes me suspicious over the rumours as he could go and may want to go to a bigger spanish club and not just move for sentiment ... anything on the grapevine ...cheers {Ed001's Note - it's just rubbish.}(4)(12)\n\n09 Jan 2012 16:09:57\n\nScouts coming to look at Motherwell midfield playmaker Law, left disapointed , but were impressed by the Humphrey cameo, creating two goals in less than 20 minutes. 7 Championship scouts at the match, in including Forest and Leicester City. Cheeky bids to test the water anticipated.(9)(4)I like the look of Humphrey, not helped at Motherwell buy the useless Striker they have there, if he finds a club who move the ball quickly, it will suit his game, Forest or Leicester would be a great move for him.They can take him he's rubbish anyway!\n\n09 Jan 2012 15:58:35\n\nShrewsbury Town striker James Collins is to join league 1 Orient for a fee of £75k...(7)(7)\n\n09 Jan 2012 15:58:18\n\nManchester united to get sneijder in a swap with nani .(12)(39)Not true. Sneijder will not be leaving Inter Milan while they are in the Champions League. A possible exit could come in the summer if Inter are still struggling.Rubbish !Not a man u fan ok\n\nbut this is rubbish why would united get rid of there best wing.Best winger obviously you dont watch utd and dont watch him playing he is crap the balls he sends over are sh-t even rooney thinks so valenciar gives the best crossesClearly you dont watch football or nani play. he is the best winger at the club and has been the best player this season. okay he hasn't been great the past 3 games, but name a utd player who has!His crossing is not great but his general wing play is Good and yes i would agree he is your best winger. and fyi his crossing he was uniteds (and i think the leagues) top assists last season\n\nyao\n\n09 Jan 2012 15:57:46\n\nRangers to get Graham Dorrans on loan untill end of season .(13)(19)Very good player- would be a good signing.I love rangers wish we could get him but dont think we could afford his wagesDorrans wont be going to Rangers due to the injury situation at the BaggiesCant see Dorrans heading on loan to the SPL.\n\n09 Jan 2012 15:39:56\n\nCheltenham Town have turned down 2 bids for Marlon Pack and Sido Jombati. The Pack bid has come from Reading for £175,000 plus a choice of loan players. Jombati bid of £70,000 coming from Wycombe. Both bids have been turned down by Cheltenham.(7)(5)\n\n09 Jan 2012 15:38:25\n\nAston Villa have now joined the race for Gary Hooper of Celtic after a possible snag with insurance for loan move of Robbie Keane. Mcleish has told coaching staff around the club they need a ''fox in the box'' to which Hooper certainly is the best out there under 10 million.\n\nExpect a bid to match Southampton's (not yet formerly bid but will happen in coming days) and again as stated earlier watch some movement from Sunderland.(2)(21)Fox in the box ha ha,far to slow for eplUnder 10m..., says who exactly?\n\ncos i guarantee celts wont sell for anything less than 10mSurely Darren Bent qualifies as a fox in the box type of striker?\n\nWe don't need any rubbish from north of the border thankyou!I think you will find your captain came from north of the border, clown!\n\n09 Jan 2012 15:36:32\n\nCardiff city will up their bid for noone to 900,000-1m with maybe a player going the other way. If Malky does not succeed with him he will look at kebe. Then will look at bringing in cox and mucgugan in! With cox on loan for rest of the season(3)(7)\n\n09 Jan 2012 15:36:11\n\nArsenal and Liverpool are favorites to sign Nathan Redmond from Birmingham City a fee around £7 million.\n\nBirmingham are willing to cash in on England under 21 goalkeeper Jack Butland but want upwards of £3 million. If they fail to get a buyer they will allow him to return on loan to Cheltenham Town to gain more experience before making him 1st choice next season.(4)(15)Redmond is a Villa fan and wants to join them but birmingham have also asked for 17 million and Jack Butland also wants to join cheltenham on loan utv and utcNathan Redmond is a Birmingham city fan.\n\nBcfc have put a �10 million price tag so your wrong on both accounts.\n\n09 Jan 2012 15:11:10\n\nHi Ed. Do you see any truth to the rumor that Alonso Is coming back to Liverpool and maxi and kuyt are on the way out? {Ed001's Note - no, yes and yes.}(10)(11)Xabi Alonso is happy at Real Madrid and has no intention of leaving this season although that could change if Real lose the league. Kuyt could be out of the door providing Liverpool find a suitable replacement. Ivica Olic's name has come up on more than one occasion since the Bayern man is out of favour and is looking for first team opportunities. however if Liverpool are to make the move, they would have to stump up 7-15m and also face a battle with Lazio for his signature - ATYes and if he does leave Real Madrid because they don't win the league he is going to go back to Liverpool because they have a great chance of winning the league and also being in the champions league next year haha!\n\n09 Jan 2012 15:28:21\n\nGary Hooper\n\nMartin O'neil has expressed his interest in the 23 year old Celtic striker and has been forced to bring forward his meeting regarding the player after learning of Southampton's aggressive move for him. A bid has not been made yet for Hooper but expect one in coming 2 days in the region of 6.5 million for the south coast side.Sundeland will feel they have the edge wages wise in a possible battle for his services but Gary is keen to move closer to his family if he leaves Parkhead.\n\nCeltic are secretly welcoming a big money move for their hitman , but PR wise will continue to say he is not for sale and try and pin it on Hooper wanting to leave which he doesn't....just wants a new contract in line with the high earners in squad.(7)(17)Hoopers valuation should be around 10 mill plus, if Rangers value Jelavic at 9-10 mill, then Hooper is roughly the same value or more as he is a better all round player\n\nonce again, rubbish english clubs with no chance of winning anything or even playing in europe, trying to get players on the cheapCortesse is too shrewd to part with that sort of cash for that particular player.....Hooperman will stay celt 100%What a lot of mince!Total rubbish in one way he wants to be nearer his family and then you say he doesn't want to leave which one is it?I don't even think there are any players in Scotland even worth anywhere near 9-10mill?! Nobody North of the border can compare quality in SPL to EPL? Eg. David Healy & Anthony Stokes couldn't even get a game for SAFC reserves, yet they start every week for Rangers & Celtic! Enough said.What is southsmptons aggressive move if they have not even bid yet!! Not exactly aggressive!!\n\nAlso, �10 million! You having a laugh? He is a player from the Scottish prem! He came from league 1, where players like sharp and fryatt had a better record. Sharp is going to Leicester for �3 million and fryatt is joe average at Hull and worth barely a �1 million fee!\n\nJust because he has played for Celtic it doesn't mean he automatically commands a big fee! Put it this way, Boyd and McDonald scored goals for fun in Scotland but in the championship were both average to rubbish!Answer to all your replies.... Hooper would be sold for 7 million and that really is good business for Celtic...Martin O'neill has been researching and scouting Hooper for last 3 weeks...I stated that if Gary was leave Celtic he would rather be nearer his family . Celtic have refused all contract negotions over last 3 weeks with the player ...that isn't something you do to keep a prolific striker on a contract far inferior to 4-5 of the other team players.\n\nArthur4m absolute tops!! Bar the Old Firm the rest of the SPL is the equivalent in quality to League One in England. That's not a dig, just a fact. Any more than 4m then we're better off bidding for Rodrigues from Burnley, The Duke from Coventry or looking outside of Britain.More BS....give it up you lot, hooper's going nowhere this window, and certainly not for less than 10m. like it or lump it, thats the price you're going to have to pay.Hooper has played and scored in european competition, think this is a step up from the championship, so would be worth more than the Sharps and Fryatts you mention...Oh, i forgot to add, he had a better scoring record than your 35m tattie Carroll, and if i'm not mistaking, both played in the same division at the same time, carroll has got even worse, whereas hoopers game has improved immensely, so shove your pathetic valuations up yer jacksie10 Jan 2012 08:57:24\n\nAston Villa, Sunderland and Southampton are after Celtic's Gary Hooper\n\n09 Jan 2012 15:27:26\n\nWolves are in the market for a new keeper as it looks imminant that a big money move is on for Wayne Hessnessy with both Manchester clubs and Chelsea interested. Possible targets identified as Chris Kirkland and Lukas Fabianski.(8)(17)Kirkland is fecked and has a dodgy back & We do not need or want Flapianski.\n\n09 Jan 2012 15:27:24\n\nDoncaster are targeting 3/4 new signings this window with\n\nFabien Robert\n\nMoustapha bayal Sall\n\nCarl Ikeme\n\nHerita ilunga (set to extend his stay)\n\nFormer man city striker Jo is top of that list\n\nBilly sharp has rejected Leicester in favour of a move\n\nTo a prem club\n\nJason puncheon is training with rovers(13)(8)Were did you get your information from about billy sharp (fool)!Funny that he was at saints training ground at 12.00 today.Big news on sharp then! Must be headlines that he is the first human to be in two places at one time! Sharp was actually at Leicester again today where he has agreed his contract. He will be officially unveiled on weds. Sorry saints fans, done deal! You lot all speak about the players that you are going to sign on here, Leicester actually go and get them!I dont think we ever made a move for him this jan. He made it clear he wasn't gonna move south in the summer.Jo? he's happily playing in brazil isn't he? why on earth would he go to doncaster? he'd easily get in half of premiership clubs...\n\n09 Jan 2012 15:27:15\n\nheard a rumour that suddenly swfc think there a massive club again......unreliable source! only people saying it our owl fans! huddersfield for auto spot, blades to wallop owls in playoff final 3-0(11)(12)Hudders fans should look forward to their 11th yr in the 3rd tier next seasonWho has got the biggest support in lg 1\n\nI rest my caseYour club is as big as your supportSheffield Wednesday are MASSIVE,fact.\n\nIn Gary Megson we trust.Huddersfield will come no where once Rhodes goes and believe me he will go,just a matter of time.Also Roberts to come to the mighty owls.Only time will tell but defo not worried about swfc, blades maybe!

Super Mick McMcarthy sees Emile Heskey as the ideal goal scoring partner for Fletcher in the region of £2.5 million. It is not known whether Mcleish is willing to sell his star player.(8)(13)Isnt he injured?Star player? good one. He's out of contract in the summer, take him he's yours.Heskey and ideal goal scoring shouldnt be used in the same sentence\"star player\" is that a joke?Doyle and ebanks blake are so much better than Heskey, if he was villa's star player he'd be worth like �20m upwards you fool!You silly steptoe\n\n09 Jan 2012 15:15:40\n\n06 Jan 2012 11:57:46\n\n\"As part of the Scout team at West Brom, i have heard about the Comings And Goings. Most Players are happy at WBA at the moment so they will not be many departs but Roman Bednar will leave for Brighton for a fee around £1mill, and Billy Jones also Departing too the Championship with Doncaster. West Brom will make a few bids, Hodgson will delve into the market and make a 2Mill bid for Jason Puncheon, followed by trying to gain a loan deal for Owen Hargreaves and Frimpong. they will also make a sneaky bid for newcastles james perch and Rangers Kyle Lafferty. Overall they are only willing to spend £9Million\"\n\nWho is the pathetic little boy who really thinks we believe he is a member of WBA scouting network? If you really were, do you have any idea how counter-productive it would be detailing transfer targets on a rumour website? You an absolute plonker and a compulsive liar who makes a mockery of this site. You're not a scout, people who scout for premiership clubs dont sit in there parents spare room revealing supposed transfer dealings, which by the way are clearly Bs because frimpong has signed elsewhere.

Javier Mascherano has been monitored by other clubs in recent months but it is very unlikely that Barcelona will sell without buying a viable replacement as his departure would leave them light in that area. I haven't heard anything about Maxi Rodriguez but Atletico Madrid are close to signing a deal for the return of Reyes. As far as I know, he is the only returning player AM are looking at. - ATHAHA I'd love Alonso back considering he's nominated for the best player in the world along with Messi and Ronaldo. He ain't going NOWHERE!It's Xavi Hernandez that's nominated for the ballon d'or, not Xabi alonso. And neither would move to Liverpool from their respective clubs. Ever.Alonso is a key player for Madrid this is never gonna happen son! he is arguable more important than Ronaldo as there is no1 that can replace him where as there are a mass of attackers (not at Ronaldo's level obviously but that would bag alot of goals)No need of macheranoSorry girls to disapoint you but a spanish paper with strong conections to real have conformed alonso is being edged out and he would love to play in england again maybe chelsea city or would he return to anfield -dont think they av that money about but you never know.\n\n09 Jan 2012 14:11:02\n\nTom Taiwo will join Burnley this week after Carlisle accepted an offer over the weekend in the region of around 500,000 plus extra if Burnley go up(1)(5)Tom Taiwo moving to Sheff Utd\n\n09 Jan 2012 14:06:24\n\nLeon Cort to Charlton on a permanent deal this January.(6)(5)Probably true, BFC have terminated his contract by Mutual ConsentHe is returning to Crystal Palace F.C\"He is returning to Crystal Palace F.C\" Good he looked a bit brittle to me.\n\n09 Jan 2012 14:01:21\n\nFulham are poised to make a move for Fiorentina defender Lorenzo De Silvestri.\n\nFiorentina are wanting £5m for the 23 year old.\n\nA deal for Derek Boateng is looking ever uncertain so Fulham could look to london rivals Tottenham for Tom Huddlestone on loan for the rest of the season.(8)(5)\n\n09 Jan 2012 13:57:29\n\nBrighton are set to make a move for out of favour striker 'Nathan Delfouneso' with 'Alex McLeish' keen for the youngster to get some experience(4)(7)Please take him!

Lochray ,who is being considered to represent Scotland u18s through paternal links, is being scouted by a number of football league clubs .(11)(3)Hope so 1 of the best if not the best academy in the countryI saw him play for Cowdenbeath reserves last year, saints would do well to sign him\n\n09 Jan 2012 13:31:07\n\nI have heard from reliable sources that these moves should be completed in the couple of days James Tomkins-Tottenham Jordan Rhodes-West Ham Sebastian Bassong-Aston Villa Robbie Keane-Aston Villa David Hoilett-Liverpool Saloman Kalou-Arsenal Gary Cahill-Chelsea Alex-Santos Thomas Rosicky-Wolfsburg.(11)(22)Well done you.... whos ur reliable source the papers? rhodes aint going anywhere this season!Nor tomkinsThere is no way Tomkins will be allowed to leave WHUFC for the scum at white heart lane !!!!!!Allardyce has said that Tomkins would only go for 'mega bucks'.\n\nHarry Redknapp is naive to Tomkins' ability and therefore too stubborn to pay the amount Allardyce will want for him. Therefore no such deal will take place.Fairly certain Rhodes will be leaving Huddersfield, but not to West Ham. He'll be in the Premiership come February, probably with either QPR, Norwich or Swansea.Naive to tomkins ability? typicial bloody west ham fan.. just because he's a player and he's decent it doesn't mean he's amazing i think redknapp a PROFESSIONAL football manager with trained scouts will know better than you...Rhodes to Norwich for me if he goes anywhere hope not but pilks went there and clarky would probably rather him go to norwich - ed u know any replacements for jord? {Ed001's Note - I don't think he will be going, but I know Huddersfield have an interest in Vardy in case he does.}West ham are the only team to put in a bid for rhodes\n\n09 Jan 2012 13:28:01\n\nsimon grayson in line for QPR job(6)(19)No chance, Leeds thru and thru.What Planit you on mate !Possibly one that can spell a touch better than you, but he is talking b@llocks, why even bother it's going to be Hughes I expect in the next 48 hours max\n\n09 Jan 2012 13:27:33\n\nUnited will look to bolster their attack by making a bid for German superstar 'Mario Gotze' with the deal thought to be worth around £43 million(8)(25)As were Arsenal, Liverpool, Chelsea, Real Madrid, AC Milan and Juventus, that is until Gotze said he loved Dortmund and didnt want to leave, before extending his contract till the end of 2014. So I really don't like your chances there.Highly unlikely since Mario has already agreed to fulfil his contract with Dortmund until 2013 with an option to extend by a year some time soon. A lot of young German players are doing their best not to move abroad pending the outcome of the Euro 2012 competition. If Germany win, there's every chance the DFB will want to shield the league's best young Germans from foreign clubs prying eyes. Furthermore, the signing of Marco Reus from Gladbach signals intent from Dortmund. They are not a selling club and other BuLi sides have sat up and taken notice. It's going to be very difficult for clubs to pry away talent from Germany now. - ATThe glasers are skint youve no chance in 5 years youll be were liverpool are or have been or were glasgow rangers are close to being please wake up and small the coffee\n\n09 Jan 2012 13:24:39\n\nbrighton are going to snatch billy sharpe at the last minute with a 2.3 million bid\n\nsource: groundsman at the keepmoat(6)(24)Ye he told u in confidence then u put up here for whole world to see jepoardising his job?...............DOUBT IT!Various reasons why this wont happen - 1. Billy Sharp will not be sold for 2.3 mill - he is worth more than that\n\n2. He will not come south - simple as that.\n\n3. I cannot see Gus parting with that sort of money to be honest.\n\nI would love to see Billy Sharp come down here, but cannot see it happening. As usual, bush rumours on here - try posting some with a little bit behind them!Right because the bloke that cuts the grass is always involved in contract talks,And the groundsman would obviously know that?????\n\nStop making bullst up!\n\nHe will be going to Leicester, otherwise it would not of gone public\n\n09 Jan 2012 13:10:03\n\nbrentford are lking at jason euwall.and richard lee signing for palace. jaytabb signing on loan(11)(6)\n\n09 Jan 2012 12:59:44\n\nChelsea ready to step up their move for QPR talisman Adel Taarbat. The deal thought to be worth around £20 million with Josh Mceachran go on loan to QPR for he reminder of the season(11)(20)Swansea just agreed a loan deal for Mceachran.Chelsea are not looking to sign any midfielders this January, they are considering Mordic or Moutinho for next summer and Josh McEachran has just agreed a 6-month loan deal to Swansea.20 mill give us the money now as your getting mugged, but hopefully you might get Liverpool involved then and they are used to overpaying for playersThe way Taarabt has played this season I wouldn't pay 20pMordic? Does he have the one true ring to rule them all?20million!!! u must be getting high whilst typing that. proved v.good at championship level. done nothing this season if anything going t franceLies lies liesNot a chanceGod they must be desperate\n\n09 Jan 2012 12:50:42\n\nSiphiwe Tshabalala will sign for crystal Palace on Thursday after already impressing on trial. Palace have agreed a fee of around 125k with Kaiser chiefs for the Bafana Bafana Star.(10)(7)Kaiser chiefs described rangers' offer of �100k and insult. he will not go for that littleThey wanted at least a �1m when Forest took him on trial in the summerHis contract runs out in May so its either 125k now or free in 4months\n\n09 Jan 2012 12:49:29\n\nJelavic will move for £8/9mil. Broadfoot for\n\npennies really, we will bring in HOPEFULLY,\n\nSandaza £400,000, Russell £500,000, and a\n\ntop drawer european striker like Jelavic for the\n\nsame £4M he cost, then the funds left can help\n\nmoney problems.(9)(29)I wish but thats not happening...i will pay for broadfoot to go anywhere and drive him there myself...even let him in the front seat if hes luckyCant see any big signings at ibrox. �1m deals may happen but nothing ig until the tax case is heard. also see company suspended from trading on the stock exchange. not looking good.Lmao......Rangers getting 4m to spend on a striker. Read the news, the club is bankrupt, little of any of the �5-�6.5m that Jelavic goes for will be spent on players......Lmao......Rangers getting 4m to spend on a striker. Read the news, the club is bankrupt, little of any of the �5-�6.5m that Jelavic goes for will be spent on players......There is no chance of getting 8/9 million for Jelevic. Interested parties have baulked at the asking price, no offers on the table at present. Maybe towards the end of the window when clubs get desperate Rangers can screw a few more quid out of interested parties but i cant see a fee being more than 6/7 million. There are also suggestions that Rapid Vienna also have a 30% sell on clause so no money to spend even if he does go!\n\nLets face it, Jelevic is off form and clubs want players bang in form in the January Window. 7 goals this season(not counting penalties) is hardly setting the SPL alight!\n\nYou are right about Broadfoot - Pennies!\n\nAbout 700K for Edu is about right tooThis Broadfoot rumour won't go away. Just hope he goes to Leeds and not to Ashton Gate - We don't want him either.Russell for �500K? I very much doubt it. When are Rangers fans goning to realise that they can no longer force Scottish clubs into selling their best prospects for pennies when they can sell them to lower league English clubs for more money? Get a grip, lad!Il tell you right now Rapid Vienna DONT have a 30% sell on clauseTake a lot more than the change of that to sort rangers money problems, may sell the stadium!Sandaza is the only player to be linked with Rangers so far in the current transfer window.Source SSN�500,000 for Johnny Russell - who are you kidding blue boy? Away to your room where you and your Action Man can dream some more. IF Russell goes anywhere it will be down south - both for money and real career prospects. The days of young naive Scottish footballers being duped into thinking that signing for Rangers is in any way going to strengthen their reputation are, thankfully, well and truly over. By the way, big man, youse have been banned from trading - Happy New Year!\n\n09 Jan 2012 12:39:43\n\nFormer Walsall manager Richard Money is set to be appointed as Bristol Rovers manager within the next few days(2)(14)\n\n09 Jan 2012 11:45:26\n\nHi ed yer i thought the hooper rumour would be ott what about lukas jutkiewicz then ? {Ed001's Note - he seems to be the most likely signing, as things stand, for Southampton.}(7)(7)\n\n09 Jan 2012 12:33:19\n\nNorwich about to make rys williams ist signing this window a fee of 2 half million.(9)(10)Waste of moneyIf half of the rumors about Norwich transfers were true they would have signed half of the players in the championship by now.^Haha. I'm a Norwich fan, and we do seem to be the team that everyone decides to make up rumours about. Lambert hasn't even given any idea of any players he's interested in.\n\n09 Jan 2012 12:31:30\n\nHammil to sign with Hull within the next 48 hours(11)(22)Would be surprised regular member of Wolves matchday squadReally? dont think so ... hes not happy not happy at wolves but why would he go down a step?Really? dont think so ... hes not happy not happy at wolves but why would he go down a step?Not a chance,he is in 1 st team plansBarmby put some money in for billy sharp he really wants to come to hull so please put some money in for him\n\n09 Jan 2012 12:30:18\n\nBlackburn are eyeing french winger Wahbi Khazri if Junior Hoilett decides to move.(9)(5)\n\n09 Jan 2012 12:26:08\n\nNoone to Cardiff ? Well, if they table a figure around the £1,500,000 mark maybe. However Noone loves it at Brighton, Brighton don't need the money and frankly, have Cardiff got that sort of money ? Cardiff might have a few more points currently but they are likely to struggle in the doubtful event of them getting promoted unless they get a large injection of cash to offset their current debts. Brighton on the other hand are very solvent, due to incrase their capacity by 30% in the close season and not having any debts thanks to Tony Bloom.\n\nCardiff would be at the very best, a step sideways.(7)(13)You know nothing of cardiff's finances ...and why are they likely to struggle...the malaysians have paid off quite a bit of debt and PMG have converted 6million into shares...dont speculate ...NOONE WILL BE OURS\n\nAND IT IS DEFINITLEY AN UPWARD STEP...FA CUP fINALISTS 2008 SEMI FINALSTS LEAGUE CUP 20102...2PTS OFF TOP.....A step sideways? Cardiff are challenging for promotion, and unless Poyet stops trying to force players who clearly aren't good enough to play like Barcelona, to attempt to play like Barcelona then Brighton may well get relegatedI can see Noone coming to Cardiff personally, in exchange for another player and moneyCardiff are owned by two malaysians one being vincent tan worth an estimated 1.2 billion and dato chan worth 700 mil havent got money , obviously not . on a good note where heading upwards are your clearly heading the other way . hell when we beat palace this week we only need to get man city in the final win or lose to guarentee a uefa cup spot , step sideways i think not .Cardiff are backed by a multi billionaire so we are so much better off than solvent\n\n09 Jan 2012 12:23:35\n\nMadine to Huddersfield from Sheffield Wednesday to Huddersfield quoting Ive always wanted to play for a massive club like Huddersfield (11)(19)Really?? he wants to go from playing infront of 18-20k+ fans every week to struggling to get 14k??? massive club yeah, that why they have never been in the premiership and sepnt the last 6 years or so in the same division!I think you will find Wednesday are a bigger club than HuddersfieldYea of course he did.no one could ever call hudders anything but a small club in a small town.I'm a blade so hate to say it but, Wednesday are a much bigger club than huddesfield will ever be.\n\nSo dream on..My quotes were totally mis-interpreted.

They can probably afford quite a few �190,000 players now!The poster that says Bournemouth can't afford �190,000 needs to do their homework.\n\nBut it's not Eastwood anyway.\n\n09 Jan 2012 12:16:35\n\nJunior Hoillet to Stoke for 8m and Pennant going the other way.\n\nUpson to leave due to lack of first team football.\n\nKenwyne Jones to Wolves and Fletcher/doyle coming the other way.(10)(12)Fletchers next move will certainly not to be a poor team like stoke...they r too small time for a flying scotsmanUpson knows hes back up, Jones nor pennant aren't going anywhere and hoilett will go to Liverpool or spurs, stoke will only sign Michael uchebo and possibly Jimmy kebeAnd wolves the championship ping pong side arent\"poor team\" ?\n\nYou mean financially, or football wise ??\n\neither way, you're full of st...lol\n\nFinancially - Owned by Peter Coates and his family - who also own a little company you might have seen during the ads on, well, pretty much EVERY top flight football match shown in the UK..
