Thrombosis may occur in arteries and/or veins.\n\nAntiphospholipid syndrome is more common in patients with lupus, but it can also occur on its own. It often presents with isolated large vessel vascular occlusions (e.g., DVT or PE).\n\ncatastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS)\n\nCAPS is a severe manifestation of antiphospholipid syndrome that involves accelerated and widespread thrombosis, which may lead to multi-organ failure.\n\nCAPS appears to involve a vicious spiral of progressive complement activation, leading to microvascular thrombosis and tissue damage. Three general factors seem to be involved in generating this spiral:\n\n[1] Antiphospholipid antibody.\n\n[2] Genetic mutations which predispose the patient towards dysregulated complement activation. (31812994)\n\n[3] Triggers that stimulate complement activation (e.g., acute infection).\n\nCAPS may be conceptualized roughly as a combination of a thrombotic microangiopathy plus a cytokine storm. (38320593)\n\nepidemiology & precipitating factors\n\n(back to contents)\n\noverall epidemiology\n\nCAPS is extremely rare.\n\nCAPS is the initial manifestation of antiphospholipid syndrome in about half of diagnosed CAPS patients. Remaining patients will carry a history of pre-existing antiphospholipid syndrome.\n\nRelationship to other rheumatologic disorders:\n\nMost patients with CAPS have isolated antiphospholipid syndrome.\n\n~30% of patients also have lupus. (32819183)\n\nOther associations include rheumatoid arthritis and other rheumatologic disorders.\n\n70% of patients are women. (32819183)\n\nPatients are often relatively young (~40s), but there is a broad age range. (32819183)\n\na precipitating factor is present in about half of cases\n\nInfection (49%):\n\nRespiratory.\n\nUrinary tract.\n\nSkin.\n\nGastrointestinal tract.\n\nSurgery or trauma (17%):\n\nMalignancy (16%):\n\nEspecially hematologic: Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, acute lymphocytic leukemia, angiocentric lymphoma, chronic myelocytic lymphoma.\n\nSolid tumors: Most often lung or colon adenocarcinoma.\n\nAnticoagulation withdrawal, or subtherapeutic anticoagulation (8%).\n\nPregnancy complications or initiation of oral contraception (8%):\n\nHELLP syndrome.\n\nPlacental infarction.\n\nPelvic thrombosis.\n\nMedications (5%).\n\nFlare of underlying autoimmune disease (e.g., lupus)(3%). (29779928)\n\nclinical presentation\n\n(back to contents)\n\nAKI (acute kidney injury; 75% of patients)\n\nHypertension may result from renovascular occlusion.\n\nPatients with AKI usually have a very abnormal urinalysis:\n\n[1] Proteinuria occurs in 97%. (32819183) The mean protein loss 3.7 grams/day, usually falling within a nephrotic range (>3 g/day).\n\n[2] Hematuria is seen in 79% of patients. (32819183)\n\nMost patients with AKI have evidence of hemolysis.\n\nHistopathological lesions include mostly thrombotic microangiopathy (85%) as well as proliferative glomerulonephritis (35%). (32819183)\n\nrespiratory involvement (60% of patients)\n\nARDS is a common initial presentation of CAPS (occurring in ~20% of CAPS patients overall). ARDS may occur due to a variety of different mechanisms, including:(32252584)\n\nPneumonia may be the initial trigger of CAPS.\n\nDAH (diffuse alveolar hemorrhage), which is associated with thrombotic microangiopathy. (38320593)\n\nPulmonary embolism is common.\n\nneurologic involvement (50% of patients)\n\nEncephalopathy, sometimes to the point of coma. This may relate to either: (38320593)\n\ni) Diffuse microangiopathy (similar to thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura).\n\nii) Cytokine storm.\n\nSeizure.\n\nStroke (large vessel infarction in ~10%).\n\nCerebral venous occlusion.\n\ncardiac involvement (50% of patients)\n\nSystolic heart failure may relate to a variety of causes, including:\n\nMyocardial infarction.\n\nThrombotic microangiopathy causing microvascular occlusions (despite a normal-appearing cardiac catheterization).\n\nMyocarditis.\n\nTakotsubo cardiomyopathy.\n\nNoninfectious, Libman-Sacks endocarditis (especially lupus-associated CAPS). (38534211)\n\nAdrenal insufficiency occurs in 15%, which may contribute to shock.\n\nskin manifestations (~45%)\n\nLivedo reticularis (40%).\n\nCutaneous necrosis with digital gangrene (~15%).\n\nPurpura or splinter hemorrhages.

However, if seen schistocytes are usually scanty (unlike the abundant numbers seen in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura). (29779928)\n\nLow haptoglobin.\n\nRenal failure, often with proteinuria and hematuria.\n\nHypocomplementemia (60% of patients). (38320593)\n\nðŸ’¡ CAPS may clinically resemble and/or overlap with complement-mediated TMA (thrombotic microangiopathy).\n\nDIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation) (~25%)\n\nPTT prolongation due to lupus anticoagulant may also be seen.\n\nsystemic inflammation\n\nElevated ferritin levels (>1,000 ng/ml).\n\n[#2/2] laboratory testing for antiphospholipid syndrome\n\nlaboratory tests\n\nAnti-cardiolipin antibody (IgG & IgM).\n\nThese are less specific (e.g., found in 1/3 of patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia).\n\nAnti-beta-2-glycoprotein type I (IgG & IgM).\n\nLupus anticoagulant may be evaluated in 83% of episodes. (32819183) ðŸŒŠ\n\ntest interpretation\n\nNonspecific:\n\nAntiphospholipid antibodies may be present in a variety of disorders, including infection, malignancy, and autoimmune disorders. (38320593) Thus, the mere presence of antiphospholipid antibodies doesn't establish the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome\n\nIn these conditions, antiphospholipid antibodies are generally present at low levels and only transiently.\n\nAmong CAPS patients, antibodies will usually be present in high titers. (29779928) However, it is also possible that antibodies can be consumed by thrombosis, leading to low levels.\n\ntissue diagnosis\n\n(back to contents)\n\nDefinitive diagnosis of CAPS requires biopsy evidence of small vessel thrombosis, but this is often not possible (due to the patient's instability and coagulation abnormalities).\n\nIf skin lesions are present, these may be biopsied to demonstrate thrombosis.\n\nThe risk/benefit ratio of pursuing biopsy of other organs is unknown. (29978552)\n\ndifferential diagnosis\n\n(back to contents)\n\nclosest mimics of CAPS\n\nMicroangiopathic hemolytic anemia:\n\nTTP (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura).\n\nHUS (hemolytic uremic syndrome HUS) & atypical HUS.\n\nHIT (heparin induced thrombocytopenia).\n\nPurpura fulminans.\n\nMedication-related thrombotic microangiopathy.\n\nMalignant hypertension.\n\nDisseminated malignancy.\n\n(Further discussion here: ðŸ“–)\n\nSepsis.\n\nAdrenal insufficiency (note: CAPS may cause adrenal insufficiency).\n\nEndocarditis.\n\nVasculitis.\n\nCholesterol emboli. (30504326)\n\ndiagnostic criteria\n\n(back to contents)\n\ndiagnostic criteria for CAPS\n\nInvolvement of three or more organs, systems, and/or tissues.\n\nDevelopment of manifestations simultaneously or within less than a week.\n\nConfirmation by histopathology of small vessel occlusion in at least one organ or tissue.\n\nLaboratory confirmation of the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (i.e., lupus anticoagulant and/or anti-cardiolipin antibodies).\n\ndefinition of CAPS:\n\nDefinite CAPS requires all four criteria. Sources disagree about whether it is necessary to demonstrate that antiphospholipid antibodies persist for six weeks after the initial episode (if anti-phospholipid syndrome wasn't previously diagnosed).\n\nProbable CAPS may be reached in a variety of different ways:\n\nAll four criteria, except that only two organs/systems involved.\n\nAll four criteria, except for absence of laboratory confirmation due to early death of a patient never tested for antiphospholipid antibodies.\n\nCriteria #1, #2, and #4 (everything except pathological confirmation).\n\nCriteria #1, #3, and #4 are met, with the development of a third event within 1-4 weeks after presentation (despite anticoagulation).\n\nTreatment for CAPS is poorly defined, due to the rarity of this condition (no RCT-level evidence exists). To make matters more confusing, treatment often needs to be started before the diagnosis is entirely certain.\n\ngeneral measures\n\nIdentify and treat any underlying cause, e.g.:\n\nTreat any underlying infection.\n\nAggressive antihypertensive therapy (uncontrolled hypertension may worsen intravascular hemolysis).\n\nAvoid intravascular catheters (especially arterial lines), as these tend to clot off.\n\nheparin anticoagulation\n\nHeparin is probably the most important treatment (correlating most strongly with good outcomes in retrospective series). Heparin may exert some anti-inflammatory and complement-inhibitory effects. (38534211)\n\nHeparin infusion is used initially, although low molecular weight heparin also seems to work.\n\nIdeally, heparin infusions should be titrated against anti-Xa level (because many patients will have lupus anticoagulant, which artificially increases the PTT).\n\nEventually, heparin should be transitioned to oral anticoagulation with warfarin (DOACs are inferior to warfarin among patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome). (38534211)\n\nIf heparin is contraindicated for reasons other than bleeding, antiplatelet agents as an alternative strategy are recommended. (38534211)\n\nsteroid\n\nRationales for steroid use:\n\nCAPS typically involves a pro-inflammatory state.\n\nSteroid could treat some underlying rheumatological disorders (e.g., lupus), potentially decreasing the production of anti-phospholipid antibodies.\n\nThe CAPS registry shows that steroid was used in 99% of cases. Unfortunately, there is no high-quality data to support steroid use.\n\nThe optimal steroid dose and duration are unknown.\n\n[1] Traditionally a pulse of methylprednisolone is used (e.g., 1,000 mg/day for 3-5 days), but it's dubious whether such a high dose is actually needed. For example, 250-750 mg methylprednisolone daily for three days could be sufficient. (29779928)\n\n[2] This is followed by a steroid taper to achieve short treatment duration (typically 4-6 weeks). (38534211)\n\nThe McMaster guidelines recommended against steroid monotherapy, but did recommend steroid in combination with heparin and IVIG or plasmapheresis. (29978552)\n\nplasmapheresis and/or intravenous immunoglobulin\n\nThese are both nonspecific therapies aimed at reducing the activity of anti-phospholipid antibodies. Plasmapheresis removes antibodies directly, whereas intravenous immunoglobulin may increase antibody turnover.\n\nWhere these therapies should fit within an overall treatment strategy remains unclear. To date, retrospective case series suggest the best outcomes occur when treatment includes steroid, heparin, and either plasmapheresis or IVIG. (29779928, 29978552) Available retrospective data doesn't show any mortality difference between plasmapheresis versus IVIG. (38320593)\n\nPlasmapheresis:\n\nPlasmapheresis might be preferred over IVIG in patients with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia or renal dysfunction (given the risk of kidney injury with IVIG). (29978552)\n\nIVIG:\n\nIVIG might be preferred over plasmapheresis in CAPS patients with immune thrombocytopenia, given evidence of benefit in that condition. (29978552)\n\nTypical regimens include 0.4 g/kg/day for five days or 1 g/kg/day for two days.\n\neculizumab\n\nEculizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds and inhibits complement protein C5.\n\nTraditionally eculizumab has been reserved for more refractory cases. However, increasing insight into the pathophysiology suggests that complement activation is a primary driver of the illness, suggesting that eculizumab may be beneficial if initiated earlier. (31812994)\n\nEculizumab may be especially useful in patients with prominent features of thrombotic microangiopathy. (38320593) There may be significant clinicopathological overlap between CAPS and complement-mediated hemolytic uremic syndrome.\n\nSeveral case reports describe efficacy at initial doses of ~900 mg weekly (analogous to the regimen of eculizumab for atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome). (32252584)\n\nEculizumab increases the risk of meningococcal meningitis by ~1,000-fold, so meningococcal vaccines and antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered.\n\nadditional immunosuppression\n\nRituximab:\n\nB-cell suppression may be a rational strategy, with a goal of reducing anti-phospholipid antibody production. Rituximab causes elimination of anti-phospholipid antibodies in half of patients. (32252937)\n\nRituximab may be considered for refractory cases. (29978552)\n\nCyclophosphamide is considered for patients with CAPS in the context of lupus. (32252937)\n\nMortality is 40%. (38534211)\n\nLupus-associated CAPS has a higher mortality (~50%). (38534211)\n\nRecurrence can occur, but is rare (<5%).
