        "text": "Netflix releasing viewership numbers is going to have massive repercussions in content licensing. Media Owners will get to see the retention value their libraries bring to streaming platforms and adjust prices accordingly. It provides a benchmark for renwed residual discussions to occur, along with the inevitable fight between creators and shareholders as to who should pony up or go without. This is not the new of the streaming evolution, nor is it even the beginning of the end, but it might be the end of the beginning. Media and storytelling future is going to be bright. https://lnkd.in/gZr9Nxw9\n\nAs a fan of both football and innovative media strategies, I can't help but tip my hat off to Manchester City's latest venture. Their documentary, \"Together: Treble Winners,\" is not just a testament to an incredible season. It's a showcase of how the City continues to lead the way in commercialising sports content. In an exciting time where global fans crave insider and behind-the-scenes access, international and global sport teams are pushing boundaries to satisfy this demand. Manchester City, through their in-house production company, City Studios, has raised the bar on this one by bringing fans around the globe closer to the heart of the action. With sports teams worldwide enhancing their media capabilities to offer unprecedented access and content, it prompts us to consider the future of this trend. As embedded media teams become ubiquitous, finding unique ways to captivate fans becomes a challenge. In a market increasingly flooded with behind-the-scenes glimpses and personal stories, how will sport teams continue to stand out? Will we see a shift towards more interactive experiences, possibly leveraging augmented reality (AR) or virtual reality (VR) technologies, to deepen fan engagement or will we see a sports team double down on deep storytelling by enlisting a blockbuster film director to elevate their narrative? This achievement by City Studios also opens a broader discussion on the evolution of sports content. The ongoing battle between traditional cable TV and new-age streaming giants is reshaping our consumption habits. With streaming platforms potentially securing exclusive content deals, the question arises: How will traditional broadcasters adapt in this competitive landscape? This dynamic rivalry is set to dictate the future trajectory of sports media, possibly ushering in innovative shifts in how we consume sports content. As a passionate sports fan, the prospect of these developments gets me excited. The sports content war between traditional cable TV and the streaming giants of the world is heating up. Will streaming services continue to acquire bespoke packages to attract new subscribers, or will traditional cable demonstrate resilience, proving ‚Äúthis dog still has some fight‚Äù relevance in the digital age? Disclaimer: It pains me‚Äîa Manchester United fan since I was an ankle-snapper‚Äîto write this. Yet, credit where credit is due, and in the spirit of football and innovation, hats off to Alexandros Cuschieri and the City team for this one.\n\nIf you are wondering about what to watch next on Netflix, take a look at this detailed list of the most watched shows. \"Starting today we will publish What We Watched: A Netflix Engagement Report twice a year.
