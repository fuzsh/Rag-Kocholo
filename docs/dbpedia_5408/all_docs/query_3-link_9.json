McCarthy, LSU's Jayden Daniels and Ohio State's Marvin Harrison Jr., among others — enter the NFL sphere cashing in on childhood dreams.\n\nAnd while the length of contracts is set in stone year-by-year by the NFL's collective bargaining agreement (CBA), curiosity rises each year as to how much each player will make in the NFL, depending on his respective draft pick.\n\nMORE: Watch the 2024 NFL Draft with Fubo (free trial)\n\nHere's what you need to know on projected slot values for each of the 257 picks for the 2024 NFL Draft along with how rookie contracts work in the NFL:\n\nHow long are NFL rookie contracts?\n\nTerm lengths for NFL rookie contracts are \"fixed\" and \"unalterable,\" according to Article 7 of the NFL's collective bargaining agreement. Players who are drafted in the first round receive a four-year contract with a fifth-year club option, which means the player's base salary will be fully guaranteed.\n\nPlayers who are drafted in rounds 2-7 receive just a four-year rookie contract, while undrafted free agents receive a three-year contract when they sign with a team.\n\nAs stated in Article 7 of the NFL's CBA, \"a rookie contract for a drafted rookie may not be renegotiated, amended or altered in any way until after the final regular season game of the player’s third contract year.\" So those on rookie contracts are not able to receive an extension until after their third NFL season.\n\nLength for first-round draft picks: Four years, club option for fifth year\n\nLength for draft picks in rounds two through seven: Four years\n\nLength for undrafted rookie free agents: Three years\n\nHow much do first-round picks get paid in 2024 NFL Draft?\n\nAll figures below based on estimates courtesy of Spotrac and
