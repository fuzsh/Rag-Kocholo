        "text": "VANCOUVER, BC â In a tense match at BC Place, Vancouver Whitecaps FC were defeated by Pumas UNAM by a 2-0 margin as the âCaps bowed out of the 2024 Leagues Cup.\n\nThe match began with both teams having early flashes at goal. Cesar Huerta drilled a shot wide of the post while Sebastian Berhalter did a clever cut inside from the left before firing a shot high after losing his footing.\n\nThe âCaps were denied a brilliant chance in the 24th minute. Fafa Picault chipped in a beautiful cross from the left into the Pumas box for Levonte Johnson to peel away from his marker and volley a strike towards goal. The goal-bound shot was then miraculously denied by Julio GonzÃ¡lez, who, at full stretch, kept the scores level.\n\nJohnson was rebuffed once more by GonzÃ¡lez just a few minutes later, after being sent in behind by Brian White. Johnson bore down the middle, going one-on-one with GonzÃ¡lez but after trying to place his shot hard and low, was stopped by the hand of the Mexican âkeeper. Not to be outdone, Yohei Takaoka performed his own piece of great goalkeeping in the 34th minute, getting a hand on a shot from the edge of the box after a short corner.\n\nNot long later, Pumas drew first blood in the 37th minute. Pedro Quispe dribbled into the box and set Cesar Huerta up to smash an effort into the side netting for 1-0.\n\nThe second half started with Whitecaps FC raring to get an equalizer. White hit the target after being found near the penalty spot by Ali Ahmed, but his shot went straight into the hands of GonzÃ¡lez.\n\nWhile the 'Caps searched for a goal, Pumas went on and doubled their lead in the 57th minute. Huerta sent in Ruben Duarte on the left, and Duarte drilled a ball across goal for Jorge Ruvalcaba to tap-in for 2-0.\n\nDespite being two goals down, the âCaps stayed true to their task and were relentless in their search for a goal. Ryan Raposo had a chance to halve the deficit around the 75th minute, when Ahmed found Picault in the box, whose touch set Raposo up for a snapshot volley that had to be punched out by GonzÃ¡lez.\n\nMathÃ­as Laborda flashed a header above the bar after rising to meet a Pedro Vite free kick in the 85th minute as the âCaps continued to search for a way back into the match.\n\nThe 'Caps kept the pressure up for the remainder of the match, trying to get one back on Pumas. White was sent in behind in added time, lifting the ball up and over GonzÃ¡lez just outside the box but was unable to direct it towards goal before it was cleared.\n\nIn the end, Pumas held onto their two-goal lead until the final whistle, securing their place into the next round of the Leagues Cup.\n\nWhitecaps FC are scheduled to return to MLS action at home versus Los Angeles FC on Saturday, August 24 at BC Place. Kickoff is set for 4:30 p.m. PT.
